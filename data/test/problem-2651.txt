“Sometimes people make mistakes. Like Father and Lucius did about following the bad man. Or like I did, leaving our rooms without talking to Father.” Merlin, the connections that Harry made. Remus rubbed his forehead, trying to organize his thoughts.
Shadow walked into the bathroom and rubbed up against Harry's legs before standing up on his back feet and planting his front paws on Harry's knees.
“Mother, please can Harry stay the night? Please, please?” Narcissa glanced over at Lucius and they came to an unspoken agreement.
*****
“If you like, Harry, you could call me Aunt Cissy. I know we are really cousins, but it would be easier to say than ‘Cousin Narcissa’ all the time.” She made big eyes at him, and he giggled.
Rowle had never been able to get the attention from the Dark Lord that Severus or Lucius had. He didn't have vaults full of money, or political influence, or a talent with Potions unmatched anywhere else in the world. But what he did have was an old estate, far off from anywhere and unknown to almost everyone. He'd never hosted revels there, or the Dark Lord. If he were able to capture the Boy-Who-Lived and keep him until the Dark Lord's return, he would be the most honored of all of his followers. All he needed was a distraction...
“No, thank you. For letting me spend time with him. He’s welcome here anytime.” Severus nodded, and reminded Harry that they still had Christmas dinner. Harry handed the book back to Remus.
Severus turned back to Harry.
The journal went back into the safe, and the two men went back to the reception room. They started to discuss how to destroy the Horcrux without hurting Harry. After an hour and a half, they hadn't figured out anything. Severus shook his head.
“Off. I am going to help you out today, just to make sure that you know what you are doing. If you don't want me in here from now on, and I know that you can do it yourself, then I will let you bathe alone.” Harry nodded and began unbuttoning his pajama top. He got undressed and let Severus help him get into the bathtub. Harry giggled at the sensations of the bubbles, and let Severus wash his hair with some very nice smelling shampoo and conditioner and helped him wash the rest of him.
“Do you hate my father?” Remus blinked in surprise. He briefly wondered if Severus had to field the unexpected questions all the time.
“A little. But not because of that. And my feelings about Remus aren’t fair to him, which is why I wanted you to spend time with him and figure out how you felt about him all on your own.” Harry smiled.
“Master Harry, Tippy will be taking the dishes to the kitchen to be cleaned.” Tippy stepped around Harry and gathered the dishes together. “Tippy will be back around lunch time with more food.” She popped out of the room with the dirty dishes, and Harry looked around the room, lost for a moment in being alone and not being afraid for the first time. He chewed on his lower lip, trying to get up the courage to do one of the things that Sev... no, his Father had suggested.
My apologies for the long wait for this chapter. Now that summer is over, updates should be much more frequent.
“Oh, look at your hair. Poor thing.” She began to run her fingers through his hair. “I don't know if you knew this, Harry, but you and I are related.” Harry looked up at her in surprise. He didn't think that he had any other family other than his father. “Oh yes. Let me think... Dorea Black was your grandmother, and my great-aunt. So that would make us... second cousins.” She kissed him gently on the top of his head. “Hello cousin. I can also honestly assure you that the hair trouble comes from the Black side of the family. Merlin knows that Bellatrix and Andromeda had the worst time controlling it, although not like Bellatrix tried.” Narcissa pulled and elegant pale wand from her sleeve and waved it over Harry's head. His hair felt like a breeze went through it, and he saw his father breathe what looked like a sigh of relief. Narcissa put her wand back up her sleeve with a look of supreme satisfaction.
“Did Arthur ever fight a dragon?” Narcissa smiled. Her son was almost always predictable.
Draco had Harry by the hand and kept walking. They went up stairs and down hallways and Harry had no idea where they were.  Eventually, Draco stopped in front of a door that had his name engraved on a plate.
“So he is. Serves him right, kidnapping a child. Really was too bad he stepped on that viper nest.”
The two of them were looking at the other families in the book when the fire in the fireplace turned bright green and a small, blond haired boy came running through.
Harry thought about this, then looked up at Severus through his lashes.
Rowle made his way down the terrace steps and into the gardens that surrounded Malfoy Manor, keeping a tight grip on the little boy that was his ticket to power and respect. He could hear the start of the chaos he had left behind him, and one of the other brats crying out for Harry. He ducked into the garden, letting the hedge hide him and the squirming child from the manor. He leaned down and whispered next to the boy’s head.
Also, thank you so much for reading, and the amazing comments telling me how much you enjoy. As this is my first story, I am amazed at how much I have written, and how much further I have to go. This is a shorter chapter, but I didn't want to leave you guys hanging.
“No, Remus was never a bully. But I think, because he didn’t want his friends to get mad at him, or stop being friends with him, he didn’t stop him from bullying other people.” Harry nodded.
“Lupin. May I come in?” Remus moved back and let Severus come in. He had expected Albus to come and check and see if he was settling in, or perhaps Minerva, but never Severus. He figured that they would exist in a solid state of Severus’s snide and spiteful comments and his own calm patience while he was at Hogwarts, but apparently he was mistaken.
He was feeling full already, and thinking about his relatives made his tummy hurt, so he put his spoon down. Severus saw the pained look in his son's eyes, and his heart hurt because he knew that it was going to take a long time to heal.
“Now Severus, that’s not fair. James grew up to be a good man, and at one point in time Lily was your best friend. Taking care of their child will be a challenge, but I think it will be good for you. Perhaps it will help you move past your resentment of the past.” Albus was very proud of himself for thinking of it. Severus would keep Harry under wraps and humble, if only because of his seething resentment for James Potter and Sirius Black.
“But… my aunt and uncle and cousin were family too, and they never wanted me…” Harry whispered quietly. “And… they did bad things.” Narcissa blinked back the tears that welled in her eyes at how small and scared Harry felt.
For as long as he could remember, Harry had known that he needed to be as quiet as possible and take up as little space as he could. Take up too much space, and Uncle Vernon would get angry and yell and sometimes hit upside the head. Make too much noise, and Aunt Petunia would hiss at him that he was drawing too much attention and pinch him on the under side of his arms. As soon as Uncle Vernon got home, she would tell him that 'The boy had been acting out." and then Uncle Vernon would get mad. Either way, Harry knew to stay quiet and small and not argue with anything. Like when all he was given to wear was Dudley's too big clothing, or when his aunt made him sleep on the floor with only the very thin blanket that had been his since he was a baby. Sometimes he dreamed of a woman with red hair  singing to him softly or a man with messy hair and glasses making him laugh. Harry already knew at his young age that dreams weren’t real.
Shadow sat on the edge of the bed closest to Harry and made a “Merrt” sound. At that exact moment, the dragon figurine chose to pounce on Shadow's flicking, fluffy tail. Shadow's “merrt” changed halfway through to a surprised yowl as he jumped an impressive three feet in the air. He twisted in mid-leap to land facing his attacker. The tiny dragon tumbled onto his back and waved his claws in the air, and Shadow gingerly sniffed towards the offender with wide eyes and flattened ears.
Harry sniffled and wiped his face with the sleeve of his pajamas again. He sure had cried a lot tonight, but for the first time in his life he wasn't crying because he was hurting or sad. His dream of someone helping him had come true, and he didn't know what to do or think.
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus cleared his throat.
The beginning of the new week had to come eventually. Severus made sure that Harry was up and dressed in a reasonably nice outfit (although none of Harry's new clothing was less) and made sure that he had a good breakfast. Once Harry was ready Severus took him to the Floo.
“Oof! Who is that! Whatever student is there better drop the spell immediately, or I shall have to take points! You know spells aren’t allowed in the corridors!” Minerva McGonagall wasn’t going to mince words with rule breakers. Severus sighed, and then grinned to himself. Having Minerva in his corner when dealing with the Headmaster would make keeping Harry with him much easier.  He quickly dropped the charm.
“I am so proud of you Harry. You were so brave, and I know that it was scary.” Severus wrapped his arms around both boys. “I had hoped to protect you from having to deal with bad people, but you did so well.” Harry hugged Draco and relaxed against his father.
Draco looked up and saw the parents.
“Tippy, this is my son, Harry. You are going to be spending the days with him while I am teaching. You are to make sure that he has activities to occupy his attention, and make sure that his meals are delivered at the appropriate times. He is also not to leave the chambers unless I say so.  Is this understood?” Tippy nodded. Harry turned a little red, shy at having been introduced as Severus's son.
“Welcome, my son, to Diagon Alley.” Harry's eyes were wide with wonder, and Severus was glad that he had taken the time to allow Harry to experience the opening of the portal. Harry had almost no experience with magic, and Severus wanted him to get used to it as quickly as possible.  The two of them walked past Slug and Jiggers, where the students got most of their school potion supplies. Harry made a face at the smell coming from the open door, but his head kept turning back and forth looking at the shop full of owls and the bookstore with books flying around the front windows. He also seemed captured by the posters in between the shops. They moved on their own!
“You got a kid? Who'd let you knock them up, Snape?” Rowle threw back. In Severus's opinion, Rowle had always had more balls than brains.
“Your mother and I lived a couple of houses away from each other as children. The rest of your mother's family didn't have magic, but your mother did. We met one day at a park, and I saw her perform accidental magic. Since my mother was a witch, I already knew about magic. I told your mother, and we became friends very quickly. It gave her someone to hang out with that wasn't your aunt, since they didn't get a long, and it gave me someone to spend time with away from my Muggle father, who was not a nice person. A lot like your Uncle Vernon, actually.” Harry completely understood, and scooted a little closer to his father. He liked feeling like Severus understood.
Narcissa swept in, looking perfect as always. Since they had all been taking their lessons seriously (and Lucius and Severus had them ingrained) everyone stood when she came in the room, but she quickly waved them off. She walked over to Lucius and pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek.
“We will take him.”
“Congratulations, Severus. It's a boy.” Severus scowled at her, and Minerva suppressed a chuckle. “I will leave you to get better acquainted.” She slipped her wand back up her sleeve and made her way out of the infirmary. Severus looked towards Poppy.

Severus came back down to Lucius’s study, using his wand to dry his clothing. Bathing two boys hyper on chocolate had been an experience. He couldn’t say if it had been good, as he had been soaked by the time they were clean, but there had been laughter from both boys that was so innocent that he couldn’t hold back his own smiles. He was even smiling a little when he entered the study. Lucius was reading over the book that Narcissa had brought them earlier.
“So… Rowle’s dead.”
In order to protect the man that he had raised, Merlin took the wounded Arthur to the mythical Island of Avalon and placed him in an enchanted sleep to heal. Arthur would wake when Brittania needed him the most. The sword was given back to the Lady of the Lake, and one day would be gifted to someone worthy and pure of heart. The scabbard disappeared into myth.
The following morning seemed very busy to Severus, who wanted nothing more than to sit with Lucius and go over what he learned about his son in detail. Instead, Harry went to his lessons and Severus had to deal with the student body of Hogwarts chomping at the bit for the start of winter holidays. Luckily it was the last day of lessons, and Severus was content to pass out the graded finals and force the students to take notes instead of attempting to get them to brew. Severus did have Harry leave his new friend, who had informed Harry that her name was Nala, in her basket and next to the fireplace so she didn’t get cold.
Severus noted that while Harry had an obviously hungry look on his face, he didn't pick up a fork and start eating. Making a mental note on the list of things to work with Harry on, he remarked “Please, Harry, eat. You don't have to wait for me to say it's okay.” Harry picked up his fork and began to eat slowly, making sure that he was being neat.
“You are more than welcome to ask me whatever you like. If I don’t know the answer, I can try to research it.” Harry looked down at the Occamy, who had curled up in Harry’s lap. She was about a meter long, and seemed content to doze in the heat of the room.
“If you think that I am going to let MY son spend time around…” Narcissa came into the room, interrupting whatever insult Severus was going to throw at Remus. All of the men stopped speaking when she stepped in, Lucius standing up behind his desk but not putting down the glass of fire whiskey that he had obviously poured to enjoy the argument between Severus and Lucius.
“My darling little boy, I don’t think you understand how different things are.” She lifted him up and sat down on a plush chair, cuddling him against her as he curled up like a kitten. “When Severus adopted you, he wasn’t just saying that you are his son. The spell that he did, that means that you are as much his son as if you had been born to him. And he loves you, Harry, more than I could possibly put into words.” Narcissa could feel Harry crying almost silently against her, and she ran her hand up and down his back soothingly. “He’s not the only one. You are family to us, love. All of us. Lucius and I, Draco, even Mr. Lupin. You are family, and we would never let you leave or mistreat you the way that you were before.”
My sincere apologies for the long delay in this next chapter. Life came at me hard, and I am finally through with it and have time to get back to writing. I hope that this new chapter is everything that you wanted it to be, and look forward to continue with this amazing story.
“Go ahead and look around. If you want a closer look, give a holler.” Severus nodded, and headed deeper into the shop. He looked at Harry. “We are going to find you a companion, so you aren't alone all day. We need to find something that you have a connection with. Like you did with the little dragon.” Harry nodded, and began to peer into the cages. He walked past cages with rats, and snakes, and puppies who had two tails. They were passing through cages of puppies and kittens when a lone black paw came out and caught a claw on the edge of Severus's sleeve.
I couldn't leave you guys on a cliffhanger like that! Here you go! Also, thank you so much for all the amazing words, I can't tell you what they mean to me.
“She said that she don’t know how long she was waiting, just that her mom told her that she had to wait until she could feel her Master coming. Then she went to sleep. She said that when she went to sleep it was very loud, like many pieces of stone being moved and placed on each other.” Severus nodded again, and estimated that the serpent had been sleeping since Hogwarts was built.
“I… went to school with Mr. Lupin when we were children. We didn’t get along. It’s hard to change opinions about someone when you have had them for a long time.
“I will try.” Severus nodded.
“Thank you, Minerva. Please, just post something on my door letting the students know that classes are canceled for the day. You don't have to watch them all.” Minerva nodded, and wished Severus a good rest of his night.
“He’s got Harry.”
“Alright, Harry. Would you like to try something right now?” Harry looked up and then smiled and nodded. “Lucius pointed at the salt shaker in the middle of the table. “We are going to try to move the salt shaker. In any direction. I want you to think about your magic. Feel it through your body, in your blood. It's almost like a buzzing under your skin. Now try to push it out, and push the shaker.” Lucius wasn't expecting anything, but he wanted Harry to get an idea of what his magic felt like.
“Yeah. Too bad. Want me to call the Aurors?” Lucius looked at Remus in surprise. Remus had an inscrutable look on his face.
“It was the blanket that came with me when I was a baby. It's the only thing that I have from my parents... it's the only thing that's mine.” Severus nodded, understanding now why it was so important.
“I was thinking Smoke, Father, since he has smoke when he sleeps.” Harry pointed at the little dragon, who had smoke curling from his snout.
Severus was stunned, and didn’t know what to make of this new development. A mythical creature, once thought a god by members of a Mesoamerican tribe, had decided that his son was going to be it’s ‘Master’.
“You are more than welcome to be part of Harry's magical lessons, once we have figured them out. But don't be surprised, Draco, if you cannot do anything yet. This is a very rare ability. “ Draco nodded, but smiled and nudged Harry. He wasn't going to be excluded.
“Can your friend let me know if she knows if she is poisonous?” Harry hissed something, and the serpent hissed back.
“Well, I want to go with you.” For someone so small and, until a couple of minutes ago, scared to tears, Harry seemed quite determined.  Severus nodded, and then nodded to Minerva to begin. Severus moved closer to the bed so he was standing next to Harry.
“There is so much, but I should start at the beginning…” Despite his discomfort, Severus laid out everything. How he and Lily had reconnected, how he had misgivings about Albus and how his entire purpose for Harry was as a pawn, a figurehead for the side of Light. He explained how Albus had sent him to Surrey the night that Severus found Harry, and how Severus had manipulated Dumbledore into letting him adopt Harry so that there was no way that anyone could use him or abuse him again. He went over Harry’s scar, and how he wanted to use the research of the Wolfsbane potion to find a way to help Harry. At some point during his explanation, Remus got up and got both of them a tumbler of scotch and began pacing as he listened to Severus explain that he had secretly started lessons with the Malfoy family, how Draco and Harry were close friends and the Malfoy’s considered Harry family. He continued with detailing how they had found out Harry was powerful enough to perform wandless magic, and finally, how the night that Remus met Harry he had gone to a chamber no one knew about… and the resulting revelation of Harry as both a Parseltongue and the Promised King.
“Hello, Father.” Not ready to see Harry flinch at his touch, Severus  suppressed his urge to run his fingers through Harry's messy hair and instead stood up.
Severus stopped reading for a moment and picked up the figurine.
Severus felt his stomach drop at the thought of letting the monster that almost ate him while he was a student anywhere near his son. He focused on keeping his occlumency shields in place and his mask over his expression, so the only outward sign from him was a sneer.
“I know that this makes you sad. It makes me sad too. But the fact of the matter is that no one knows what happened to that evil man. There are some people, like myself, who think that the man might come back, and that would put you in danger. Or that people who followed the evil man might want to hurt you. That's why it's so important to me that you get lessons with Draco and Narcissa. Because they are going to make sure that you understand the wizarding world better, and help you know how to protect yourself no matter the situation.” Harry looked at Severus for a minute, then threw his arms around Severus's neck.
“Is there anything else, Potions Master?” Severus shook his head in the negative, and the creature popped out of the room. Harry jumped at the noise again.
Draco makes a decision, Severus gets interrupted in class, and Harry has an exciting and scary day.
“Harry, do you think that we could try a little right now?” Harry set his fork down and nodded, excited. He loved magic. Severus held his hand up, palm up, and Harry's fork raised a couple of inches off the table.
“Shows what you know. This is my ticket out of here.” Rowle pulled a knife from somewhere and held it against Harry’s throat. All three men stopped in their tracks. Severus could see the tear tracks on Harry’s face, and how Rowle was holding him by his hair, and the knife at Harry’s throat, and felt a rage like he had never felt before. He had been angry at the Dark Lord when he killed Lily, but it was matched measure for measure with pain and sorrow. There was no pain and sorrow here, only rage for the monster who put their hands on his son.
“Hello?” Said a tiny voice. Harry blinked at the egg a couple of times, and then down at Shadow, who was no longer paying attention to Harry or the egg and was cleaning his tail.
**********
“It tickles!” Poppy blinked and glanced at Severus. Diagnostic spells were the gentlest of all charms, just by their nature, and Harry should not have been able to feel them at all. Severus was beginning to think that he was going to have to start training Harry to control his magic sooner rather than later.
“Can I come in? We need to talk.” Remus opened the door and backed up so Severus could come into his room. Not wanting to put Remus’s back up, Severus requested that Remus place wards around the room to prevent anyone from hearing the conversation. Remus raised an eyebrow, but did as requested.
By the time Harry and Severus were ready to leave, they had more toys, puzzles, games, and books than Harry had ever seen in his life. Everything was placed into bags and shrank down small enough to fit in Severus's pockets. Included in this was a large stuff dragon who's colors matched the tiny figurine who had chosen Harry as his owner. Severus was getting ready to take them back to Hogwarts when something occurred to him. He knew what he was about to do was probably going to make a great deal more work for him, but he also knew that it would help Harry a great deal. He paused for a moment, causing Harry to stop and look up at him.
“Tippy, has Remus Lupin been moved into quarters yet?” Tippy nodded, her ears flapping.
“I recognize that look. It was the same look that Narcissa and I had when we realized that the Dark Lord was a threat to Draco. That is what happens when you feel protective for your child. And we will figure out what we need to do to protect Harry. I do believe that part of why he is so powerful has to do with the connection to the Dark Lord. And there may be other things that crop up, just so you are forewarned.” Severus nodded.
“Can you teach me how to protect our family too? I told father that I would protect him like he said he wanted to protect me. I don't want him to die like my mom and dad did.” Narcissa was now sniffling elegantly into her napkin and using it to dab tears from the corners of her eyes before they could fall. Lucius looked startled and proud.
Pansy didn't want anything to do with Harry, but would not leave Draco alone. She wanted to tell Draco all about her new hairstyle and new dress and wanted him to pay attention to her. She very quickly started pouting when Draco wouldn't pay attention to her, and only wanted to hang out with Harry.
“I understand, Father. I won’t talk to anyone about the chambers, or the Promised King, or the talking to snakes. I will help keep you safe.” Severus ran his hand through Harry’s hair affectionately, and they left the chambers, the torches going out behind them.
“Oh, love. The way your cousin acted, and his friends… that was never your fault. They were bullies, and being mean made them feel stronger. Draco, Blaise, and Theo just want to be friends with you, they don’t want to bully you.” Harry’s eyes filled with tears.
“Thank you both. I will bring Harry by at the end of the week to meet you properly. Please let Draco know ahead of time. I would hate to have to distance myself from him because of enmity between the two.” Narcissa and Lucius nodded, and Severus took a handful of Floo powder from the crystal bowl on the mantle.  A moment later, he was gone.
“Harry, please, are you hurt?” Harry shook his head, unable to speak around the tears. “Please come out. You aren't in trouble, I am just worried about you.” Harry climbed out of the wardrobe, and Severus immediately wrapped his arms around Harry. He held him close and sighed. He was glad that Harry was okay, and wanted to do everything to sooth his son and make him stop radiating fear.
The next several hours were busy with Aurors coming to take away Rowle’s body and interviewing everyone who had been involved. Lucius and Remus escorted the Aurors to Harry’s room, where Severus sat by his bed. Severus explained that Harry had been taken, and when Rowle had been attacked by the snakes, he had passed out from the stress. He said that he didn’t know if Harry had been hurt by Rowle, but that all diagnostic spells had come back negative. Severus told the Aurors that he was sure that Harry was fine, he just needed rest after his ordeal. He kept a cloth covering Harry’s forehead to keep the Aurors from asking too many questions or being too interested in his son. As this was a clear attempted abduction attempt, and there was no evidence that anything had been done to him except for the snake bites and venom, the Aurors quickly finished and left with the corpse. Once the Aurors had taken their leave, Remus bid Severus and Lucius good evening and left himself.
“It was an accident, Uncle Vernon, I swear!” Harry’s uncle wasn’t interested in his excuses, and slammed his fist into the side of Harry’s head. Harry whimpered again, and realized that he was losing control of his bladder after holding it from so long. It only took a moment for Vernon to realize what was going on, and his face got even redder as it contorted in fury.
Lucius thought over what Severus had told him. There was something at the edge of his memory, something darker than Dark. He took a sip, then froze as the memory shot to the front of his mind. His face grew pale as he quickly processed the implications. He hadn't been lying when he told Harry that he thought of them as family. Lucius stood quickly and motioned for Severus to follow him.
“This is a book of genealogy, and has family trees for all of the well known families in the British Isles.  The first family that we are going to be looking at is mine, and now yours, the Prince Family.” The book had pictures of people's faces, arranged so that you could see couples and their children.
“Harry, I think Tippy might need a hug. She looks worried.” Harry gave Severus a small smile, and slid off Severus's lap. He walked over to Tippy and wrapped his arms around her. Severus was amused to note that they were about the same size. Her ears wiggled and she wrapped her arms around Harry.
“That’s very smart and fair, Father. Can I bring Shadow and Nala?” Severus raised an eyebrow. Harry pointed at the Occamy.
“Minerva, please calm down. I am sure that it wasn’t that bad. Corporal punishment is, while not our way, very common in the Muggle world…” Albus didn’t get the chance to finish what he was saying before Severus interrupted him harshly.
“Lucius... said that you were going to learn wandless magic.” Severus said quietly. He now had an idea of what Lucius wanted to speak with him about. A child as young as Harry, before his magic matured, showing potential for wandless magic, was improbable. Some might say impossible. But Lucius wasn't the type to have said anything unless it was true. Severus was able to do to small wandless magics, but had only been able to start practicing after he was an adult and his magic was fully matured.
“Hey, hey, it's all right. I wasn't changing my mind. And I wasn't upset because you were crying. I just didn't want you to think that I was the only person that you could go with. Everyone here wants to make sure that you are happy and safe.” Severus looked over at Minerva and Poppy, and both ladies nodded in agreement.
“Why was he returned?” Severus replied, barely containing his sneer.  The young man realized that he had said the wrong thing, changed his approach in hopes that he could make the sale.
“It seems that someone picked up a stray. Who's the new whelp?” He asked with a sneer on his face.
Thank you everyone who has left such wonderful messages. It's assisting with keeping me inspired and motivated to keep writing. I have plans, sooo many plans. I hope that everyone is enjoying, and please keep reading!
“You too Harry.” Severus walked out of his quarters and went to get read for class.
Severus snapped at the 7th year who had bungled their NEWT level potion.
“Did you have a good day, Harry?” Harry nodded, enthusiastically.
I personally think that little Draco is ADORABLE.
Once again, everything belongs to JKR. I am merely here, playing with the characters and coming up with my own stories.
“Yes, when you mentioned the scar, and nightmare, and reaction, I came to the same conclusion. I know how to destroy the Horcruxes, but not without destroying the vessel. I also know that this is not the only one. The same time I was given this, the Dark Lord gave a necklace to Regulus and a cup to Bellatrix. And given the Dark Lord's obsessions, I would not be surprised if there were 6 total before Harry. I don't believe that Harry was intentional.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, that poor boy. This is just awful. Well, he certainly cannot go back and live with his relatives any longer.”  Albus appeared to think for a moment, before his eyes settled on Severus and seemed to lighten with an idea. “Severus, as you were so kind as to bring him to us, I am placing Harry in your care. Permanently.” Severus kept his mind impassive, let a sneer cross his face and put as much resentment as he could into his voice. “You mean to saddle me with James Potter’s whelp?” Internally, he was dancing with joy. Being given the chance to take care of Lily’s child was like light coming down from the heavens to bless him. This way, he could be closer to the only part of her that remained.
“I was worried about you, Harry. I went to your room, and you weren’t there. I was so scared. Please don’t ever scare me like that again.” Harry could tell how upset his father was, and felt tears welling up. He didn’t want to disappoint his father.
My apology for the long wait. Life got a little crazy. I am hoping to get chapters up much more often. I hope you enjoy reading! Thank you everyone for all of the wonderful comments!
“What about Draco? Or Blaise and Theo?” Harry asked. Severus thought about it.
“Alright, Severus, what else? What other surprises does young Harry have for us?” Narcissa said as she served herself a serving of scotch. Severus sighed.
“I am SO excited that we are taking lessons together! We are going to have so much fun!” Draco grabbed Harry's hand and started leading him out of the room as Harry smiled. They passed Narcissa on their way, Harry smiling and waving at Narcissa as Draco continued to chatter. Narcissa smiled back, nodded, and continued into the room to greet Severus.
Severus moved the books to the side table and knelt down next to the couch.
Lucius's mind was racing a mile a minute. He thought back to when Narcissa had been talking the other evening. He recalled what she had said about the toys following Harry, and how he could feel minor healing magic. Having perfect recall was a skill that he was very careful to keep close to his chest. But he knew that the amount of power that Harry had was only going to grow as he got older, and that was almost a terrifying thought. He knew now that just aside from supporting Harry as his family, he would support Harry to help him become both powerful and responsible. Knowledgeable in people, and manipulations, so that his power would never be taken advantage of. Not by the Dark Lord, or Dumbledore. He knew that he was going to have to speak with Narcissa and Severus as soon as possible. He also knew that he was going to have to do some research to see if there was any history of wandless magic being used in someone so young.
Harry felt much more comfortable in this room already. It was very clean, but Harry could see little dings in the furniture and on the walls as if there had been rough playing going on, and it felt lived in. Draco pointed out the open door that led to the bathroom and Harry admired the walls, which were painted with a mural that looked like forested mountains.  On one side of the room was a giant canopied bed, and on the bed was a stuffed dragon like the one Harry had at home. The dragon was green and silver instead of green and purple.
Out of the inner pocket of his coat he produced Remus’s letter. He would have been far more careful had he not been a wizard, and hence completely capable of repairing said letter, if something was to happen to it. It was sort of worth the look on Draco’s face, and it felt good to for once in his life be prepared. “I suppose it’s a bit of a Romeo and Juliet story, but he wasn’t ever really a Death Eater-...” He stopped himself when he realized that the others wouldn’t understand his muggle references, and hence shrugged and gave Narcissa the letter.
Their laughter spread to the other, prompting them both to laugh with more excitement, until they both worried that they might wake the children above.
Unlike what he had expected, Professor Slughorn blinked at him and then relaxed. He settled back into his chair with a satisfied nod, appearing highly pleased with himself. “I take it you were raised by him as he implemented the Lycanthropy potion every month to remain sane?”
“Either way,” Colin continued on as if he hadn’t just spoken for werewolf supremacy. His eyes focused on the wheelchair. “I still don’t know what to do with this thing.”
“Is a dog evil for dragging mud into the house?” Pat continued, leaning forward slightly.
“Of course I’d listen to you, but you didn’t really listen to me last time when I tried to talk to you.” Fred huffed as he leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. He was not yet defensive, but not quite comfortable with the topic.
The siblings experienced an unwillingness to come home, and then they disappeared, leaving the baby making process to start once again and fill the empty home. Leaving more siblings to grow up neglected.
Tom grins, “I’m pretty sure stars are in some way not Christian enough. It will be a good way to learn that those limits I had before aren’t part of my life anymore.”
Sirius shuddered. “No way. I’m quitting. School’s out for today.” He jumped onto the railing and slid out of sight. “Dementors suck…-!” Bonk!
Harry gaped at his dad before nodding as a small smile spread over his lips. “I will, but you have to promise me the same thing.”
Harry turned to look at Draco, curious about what type of reaction he would have to the two joking about his former ideals. However, Harry realised with a choking feeling that Draco wasn’t by his side where he was supposed to be. What met him when he turned his head was nothing but an empty space which only enforced the fact that his best friend had moved on to a place which Harry couldn’t reach. Harry felt as if he couldn’t breathe when he reached for his snake ring, which he squeezed tightly as the conversation continued on around him.
“Indeed, he was chosen for the task. When he moved to Hogwarts, Fawkes came with him.” Al looked towards the bird, smiling at the memories which were likely returning to him. “Fawkes has been with us for a very long time. I began to care for him as El left for America, and he also saw Tom grow up. Whenever I was distracted with work or other engagements, Tom would care for him. I would like to think that Fawkes could recognise him, but I also think that too many deaths and rebirths have passed for this old bird to recall.”
I can’t tell if he is lying or not. I can never tell with Tom.
“Go ahead and laugh… I was dumped!” Lavender sobbed into her hands. “You have a boyfriend and I don’t. Ron doesn’t want me, he wants Draco Malfoy!” She wasn’t screaming, but she was most definitely raising her voice.
She reached the summit of the hill, sweating, panting and most definitely not thinking about anything but the burning feeling in her thighs. Pat stopped and leaned over, allowing herself to breathe for a few moments before she began making her way around the school and towards the Quidditch facilities. She liked those showers better than the ones in her dormitory, not to mention that she would likely be alone there.
Harry, Blaise himself and Parkinson all found the insinuation that Mrs. Zabini had murdered her previous partners, mostly husbands, to be less humorous than Professor Slughorn did.
There was a TV there, and a VHS player, and because there was, Harry had earlier headed to a muggle store to find movies, figuring that movies were a generally good distraction for him.
“Was Remus a bully too?” Harry asked.
“Lucius. Where’s Harry?” Lucius handed him a glass of Fire whiskey.
“Harry, come here please.” Harry moved towards his father, giving the stranger a wide berth. “I was worried. I know that you know you aren’t supposed to leave our quarters alone, especially at night. I was very worried about you. I called Mr. Lupin to help look for you when I found you missing.” Remus’s eyebrows shot up. He had expected Severus to blast Harry with his temper, but instead he was calmly explaining everything.
Severus and Lucius started to make their way towards the buffet table that had suddenly started to collapse when his spy experience kicked him in the face, and he turned towards the corner where the kids are, searching for Harry’s messy head of hair. Seconds later, he heard Draco yell Harry's name and run towards the terrace door. Severus grabbed Lucius’s arm in a death grip.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, I am going to leave to go teach class now. Please promise me that you will listen to Tippy and that you will not leave my chambers.” Harry nodded, and Severus nodded back to him, smiling. Severus stood and walked to the entrance of the chambers, throwing a last look back at Harry before leaving for the day.
“Minerva, my apologies for waking you, but I need your assistance for an adoption ceremony for Harry. Albus couldn't be bothered.” Minerva's face tightened, and she nodded curtly. Both of them headed in. Poppy waited for Severus and had spent the past half hour comforting Harry, who was almost incoherent with the idea that he would never have to go back to his aunt and uncle's house.
“I wanted to tell you first hand before you heard it from anyone else, especially after Draco's unexpected visit this evening. I have adopted a child, a young man around Draco's age.” Lucius' mouth dropped open and Narcissa's eyes widened comically. Severus internally smirked at having left two of the most composed people he knew gawping. If his first announcement left them startled, he was about to break their composure completely with his second. “That child... is Harry Potter.”
Remus sat in front of his tiny fireplace, drinking a cup of tea laced with whiskey and staring at the fire. He had known that his werewolf would react protectively if Harry was in danger, but he was a little concerned that should Harry ever be hurt, he wouldn’t be able to stop his wolf from taking over and ripping the arms off whoever hurt him. Which, Remus thought, may not be a bad thing, given rumors that Voldemort’s disappearance was only temporary.
“Harry, I want you to promise that you won’t talk about this chamber, or anything that you have learned tonight with anyone but myself and the Malfoys. How you can speak with snakes is okay to speak with Mr. Lupin, since he already knows, but everything else… it’s part of keeping you safe. I know that I am asking a lot, asking you to not talk about things.” Harry smiled in his old-man smile.
Harry focused on finishing his food, and then, feeling kind of odd about talking to empty air, called for Tippy. Tippy appeared next to Harry.
“I am going to need to do some research, and I may have to spend more time around the werewolf than I wanted to, but if it saves Harry…” Lucius nodded.
“See you tomorrow, Draco! Thank you for being my friend.” Draco hugged Harry back.
“How bad?” Severus’s eye glittered in the torchlight as he quickly thought over Lupin’s reaction. Perhaps Severus could use Lupin again the Headmaster, as he did Minerva and Madam Pomfrey. Having more people between Harry and the headmaster would be all for the better, no matter who they were. Severus was willing to sacrifice almost anyone to protect his son.
“I don’t want you to spend time around Mr. Lupin because I don’t trust him. He reminds me of all the terrible parts of being in school. But he was a very good friend to your parents, and it’s important that you develop your own opinions about people based on how they treat you and your feelings about them.” Harry chewed on his lower lip.
Severus arrived back at his quarters and slammed the door shut. As soon as he knew that he would no longer be observed, his mask came down and he ran a shaking hand over his face. Having to have his son spend time around Remus was one of the hardest things that he ever had to do. Severus knew that his fear of werewolves was bias because of his sixth year, but he had never got over how close he came to dying.
“Harry, there is going to be a party in a couple of days. There will be a large number of people here. Some of them still feel... they still believe in the man who killed your parents. You don't have to attend, but there will be some children your own age attending. I thought you might enjoy meeting them.” Harry gave him a serious look,  as if he was trying to gauge if Severus wanted him to go to the party or not. Severus continued. “If you do go, there are a number of things that you will not be able to talk about with anyone. The Founder's Rooms, for example, and wand less magic, or being able to speak with serpents.” Harry gave Severus his old man look, old beyond his years.
“The first thing that I am going to do is make sure that you are not alone all day. Tippy!” There was a pop, which made Harry jump in surprise, and a small creature about the same size as Harry appeared and promptly bowed to the two of them.
“Aunt Cissy said that the spell you did when you adopted me means that I am yours like I was for my parents who died, and you won’t want to get rid of me. Even if I make you mad.” Severus knew now what Narcissa had been talking to Harry about, and why she looked so sad.
“Tippy was very worried. Tippy couldn't find Master Harry.”
“Let’s find our boy.”
“Father, can I have him?” Harry's eyes were pleading, and his other hand stroked the back of the tiny dragon. A quiet rumble came from the dragon on Harry's palm, and Severus realized that it was purring. Severus blinked a couple of times in surprise. The animals and other animated figures in the shop were charmed to act like they would in real life, but they didn't have their own personalities. Most of the dragon figurines were standoffish and ferocious, and this one was curled up on his son's hand like a cat who had claimed his owner.
“I am glad. I have a couple of things for you this morning.” He reached into the chair on the other side of him, and pulled up a small bundle. He handed it to Harry, and Harry realized that it was his blanket. He cuddled it to his chest and smiled at his father. It was the first time that Severus had seen Harry smile so big, and it warmed him up in an amazing way.
“I’m… I’m sorry father…” Harry said, as he started to cry. Severus pulled Harry against him, and cradled him on his lap.
“Draco!” Severus's sharp tone of voice immediately made Draco stop in his tracks and turn to his godfather. “You will immediately return home. I will be speaking with your parents about Harry shortly, and it will be up to them to tell you, if they wish.” Draco was so confused. Severus had NEVER spoken to him like this. Draco always got to come first with his Uncle Sev, and he didn't know what to do. Blinking back tears, he turned back towards the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo powder from the side table next to the fireplace.
Harry shook his head determinedly. “No. I’ll be alright. It went away pretty quick last time.”
, of course. Your pain is my pain, but I’d like the rest of you, if you want me. I don’t need what you’re not willing to give. Just… Us. As we are, right now.”
She shook her head, laughing softly. “If you’re sure.”
Potter had given as good as he’d got, which was to say he’d made a half-hearted joke about ferrets before turning to leave, looking defeated as ever. Draco couldn’t remember seeing him happy for as long as they’d been back at Hogwarts and he refused to admit that he cared about why, instead focused on keeping Potter’s attention on him. It had only been for a split second, but as the Stinging jinx made contact with Potter’s left shoulder blade Draco saw the hint of a smile cross over his features.
Waking as a tortured scream ripped its way out of his throat, Draco jolted upright on the hard stone floor. The flash of green light he’d just witnessed seemed to be branded inside his eyelids and he curled in on himself underneath the thin, ragged blankets with a heaving sob.
“What? I’m only speaking the truth. Those of us at the Ministry were quite astounded when the news broke.”
“You alright, mate?”
Hope lingers in the doorway
“I wish you would stop calling us that,” Harry said as he raised his head to look at Draco standing across the table. “Besides, it’s not your fault if I choose to leave her. It doesn’t even matter if it’s because of you—”
She placed a hand over his gently as she nodded. “I know. I wouldn’t suggest it if I wasn’t worried about you, you know.”
“The bloody hell there isn’t!”
“Right, well, good afternoon then?” Cursing as his greeting came out as a question, Harry watched Hermione’s jaw tense.
“Not in a bad way!” Harry rushed to say, words practically falling out of his mouth over the top of each other. “It’s not a new concept. I just—you always seemed so—” He stopped there, hands coming up to cover his flustered face. “You should talk to Luna about it,” he added as a muffled afterthought.
“I’d say not. I’m the only one of us left alive.”
“Last night… Oh,” Harry groaned, a hazy memory of scrawling a letter as he nursed a nightcap at the kitchen table before bed. “Sorry about that. I was a bit—“
He nodded, not trusting his voice at that moment. Seeing her smile even as tears threatened to spill from her eyes, he turned his head to allow her a moment of discretion before clearing his throat.
There it was, clear as day. An announcement that a Malfoy heir had been born, healthy young boy by the name of Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Harry’s vision went a bit hazy and he couldn’t make himself read past the first sentence, giving up after the fourth attempt.
Nodding before letting out a heavy sigh, Draco let his eyes fall shut on the scene before him. “
Harry hadn’t heard much of Narcissa Malfoy since the war, but he still felt he partially owed her his life and besides that, the pain was written clear as day across Draco’s face. “I’m so sorry,” he said, reaching over to squeeze Draco’s glove with his own. “I can’t even imagine.”
Waving goodbye, Draco turned to meet Harry’s eyes as the corners of his mouth pulled up in a slight smile. “I think we’ll do the lights again this year. Care to join us?”
There was a slight tremble to Draco’s hands as he lifted his coffee for another sip. “What else would you have done?”
“Master is calling for Kreacher?”
Her voice was kind as she spoke this time, less authoritative. “It doesn’t take a trained Legilimens to have a good idea of who might be plaguing your thoughts, Harry. I don’t think this is something of too much concern, though I’m sure it feels like it at this point.” Healer Benson adjusted the web of colours above him slightly before meeting his eyes. “You’ve been taking a lot of Wideye and putting pressure on your body that isn’t natural, which is enough to cause some disruption in your mind. Hallucinations aren’t overly common this soon, but they’re also not unheard of. A few days off the stimulants and good rest will put an end to it, I’m almost certain.”
Barely having the chance to blink before Hermione’s wand was out, Harry froze in shock for all of two seconds before doubling over in peals of laughter again. “Did you just…charm my…bloody tree…gay?” He was wheezing, not making a sound as air came silently into his laughing mouth between broken words. “What am I going to tell Ginny?”
“Harry, you can’t just show up on their son’s first night back.”
“Well, they could give you Dreamless Sleep while you’re there. I think you’ll need to get checked after taking so much Wideye though. Your heart is likely working twice as hard as it has to.”
“We’re getting Scorpius a crup for his birthday. I’ll be heading to Eeylops next.”
Draco didn't forgive his father for his choices, and he had lost respect for him quite a long time ago. He pitied him really. But like any child who is raised in his father's image, always wanting his praise and attention, it was a hard relationship for Draco to dismiss entirely. He wasn't sure he would have made any decisions differently had he been in his father's position. Lucius had never really been a great man to model himself after, but he was still Draco’s father and it was hard to make that separation sometimes.
—but after a few days nobody spared more than a sideways glance, the rivalry not being anything new. Draco found himself gravitating more and more towards Potter, frequently showing up outside classes that weren’t his and taking up new study locations just to occupy the same space. It didn’t escape his notice that Potter was doing precisely the same thing.
He trailed off as Draco reached the top of the staircase and left his sights without so much as a backward glance. It was only that broken syllable playing on repeat that kept Harry from chasing after him, demanding answers. Needing something, anything.
“Can wait.”
Sighing, Harry rolled his eyes and watched Ginny stick her tongue out at him in response. “Well, you said Scorpius’ dad told him about me. Did he say anything else about that? About his dad?
Grumbling, John snatched his arm away from Harry. “Can’t believe you’re defending him. I thought you were on our side, boy.”
What chance do you have
marriage would have to mean that you…”
“Mmm?”
“Maybe this isn’t just about you, Draco. Not everything has to be about you!” Harry was frustrated, running a hand through his hair as he speared Draco with a meaningful look. “If I’m trying to save anything, it’s this. Us.”
“Why does the way you emphasise those words make it sound like so much more than it is?”
“What a shame,” he said with an understanding nod. “Perhaps next year?”
And now it was Draco closing the distance between them, Harry’s eyes fluttering closed as their lips met, hesitantly at first before Draco’s fingers found their way into the messy strands of hair at the nape of his neck and tugged, urgency finding its way into their kiss. This kiss was equally as heated as their first had been gentle, the years of pent up aggression and repressed emotion taking over as they pulled closer. Their unspoken words were poured into soft moans and desperate lips, hands finding whatever bare skin they could and staking their claim. It was everything Harry had wanted for yet never dared to dream of, and he kissed as if he were a starving man and Draco Malfoy was to be his last meal.
Confused, Harry reached out a hand and then thought better of it, dropping it awkwardly between them. “Why do it then?”
“Is it alright if I take Al and Scorp up to my room? We won’t wake Lily on the way, I promise.”
, he thought. Perhaps this was his opening to ask Draco outright and be done with the guessing games for good.
And so he remained, fervently in denial until he had an armful of excited Edward Lupin back from his first term at Hogwarts, and there was no Draco Malfoy to be seen.
“I think you’ve found your… Can I call that an owl?”
“Cracking open the fancy wedding gifts?”
“Al, if you throw one more at Lily while she’s on the ground I’ll leave you at home next time!” Harry called out, shoving Draco lightly as he laughed beside him. Turning to look at him, Harry smiled. “They seem to be enjoying themselves. Even James,” he added with a laugh. “I was worried he would kick up a fuss.”
,” he heard distantly as his body was jolted upright.
“I can’t. But I do know that it’s been a bloody long time now, and while we can’t predict the future, I’d say it’s a pretty good indicator of how things might go.”
Ginny sighed. “I’m not going to stop you. I just know that you’re only interested in one person and he’s determined to stay in his marriage and raise his son.”
Taken aback by how unfortunately accurate both women were in their logic, Harry stood there incapable of retorting, staring open-mouthed at both of them. Enough time passed that they laughed in harmony, before launching into teasing recollections of how insufferable their respective dates had been over the past two years. While reassuring to know that he wasn’t alone in his feelings, the entire conversation was beginning to feel quite demeaning, or perhaps simply too brutally honest for his broken heart.
“You can stop if you’d like.” Draco shrugged, looking down. “Or you could continue rambling. I don’t mind.”
It didn’t take long before grief gave way to seething rage and all he could see was red.
“You don’t have to do what I say.” With a pointed look, she shrugged at him. “Anyway, it’s not like you’ve ever listened to me where Malfoy’s concerned.”
“Hard to trap someone who’s actively avoided you for two years.”
“Not a real dragon,” Malfoy muttered.
Regent Street seemed more magical every year. Not in the sense that there were more witches and wizards around, though Harry was sure that was also the case, but in how it made him feel. Every visit transported him to a place that felt otherworldly and held comforting memories, like the first time he’d laid eyes on Hogwarts. More than that, he could be himself without fear of press harassing him—many muggle destinations were good for this reason—but he could also be with Draco in public, even if they couldn’t be particularly affectionate in front of the boys.
Sauntering across the room to join Teddy by the tree, Malfoy threw an amused smirk back over his shoulder. “Helps to have the right connections, Potter.”
Harry gulped, voice low. “I’m not suspicious of you any more, Malfoy.”
“Er…” Was all Harry managed before the rainbow appeared above him once more and resumed its intricate movement patterns. Again, his eyes were drawn to the tight gold tangle and he realised with a sinking feeling in his chest where he had seen such unforgiving golden colours before: in most of Voldemort’s horcruxes. A shiver ran down his spine as he tried to tear his gaze away but the slowly moving pulsation of the colour captivated him entirely.
Harry felt himself reflecting Draco’s annoyed expression. “Is this some pureblood thing? Or do you genuinely not care about love? I don’t understand.”
He could feel it answered in the fingertips that had slipped under his shirt gripping so tight that he could feel the bruises forming, the soft sigh of his name turned moan that was swallowed between them.
, Hermione started down the stairs and Harry fell into step behind her. Happy just to have made it out of Grimmauld without a proper argument, Harry pocketed the bag of galleons along with his wand and resumed humming the tune from earlier, drawing a snort from in front of him.
Great, now Malfoy was looking at him like he’d lost the plot and maybe he had, honestly. Nothing much surprised him any more. With a sigh, he kicked at the snow beneath his feet.
Potter seemed to be the only other exception to this. Still taking his every meal with Weasley and Granger, now joined by an assortment of eighth-years and the occasional younger Slytherin, Potter could almost be mistaken for enjoying himself as everyone else was. But Draco had spent too many of his waking hours watching Potter: this was very carefully masked suffering, all too relatable for his liking. For both of their sakes, he was determined to do anything possible to pull Potter out of his pity party and hopefully hitch a ride out while he was at it.
Mirroring her, Harry glanced around to see many watchful eyes quickly turn away from them, clearly eavesdropping. He sighed, wishing that the public would take less interest in his life.
Eyes opening of their own accord, Harry broke out into a grin as the familiar warmth washed over him from head to toe and the electrifying feeling that accompanied it started to run through his veins. He felt
hope everyone is having a lovely festive period! next two chapters will be up by tomorrow morning x
“…You seriously don’t do that here.” Her tone was cold, syllables even, and somehow that made it all the more terrifying.
Over the past years he’d sought out solitude more than ever before, despite being surrounded by schoolmates and houseguests at every turn. Draco had become an expert at Occlumency out of necessity—though he had already been excellent after years of forced training from extended relatives and his head of house—and knew better than anyone the importance of clearing your mind when people may be listening. He didn’t think there was much chance of needing to block out unwanted visits here but instead was thankful for the knowledge he’d gained, because now he could apply it to himself. The possibility of spending years in this cell was more time than Draco cared to spend alone with his thoughts and the longer he could prolong the onslaught of emotion, the better. He knew it was only a matter of time until he truly had to process what he had experienced but for now, this was the course of action.
“Oh.” Draco tried to keep a neutral tone, realising that his mother’s story had more truth to it than he’d initially suspected. He watched as Harry kept a stoic face, the movement of clenching in his jaw the only sign he thought about this more than he was letting on. “Want to go there?”
"I've received word from Dr. Wolff that you will be staying here until you feel comfortable leaving," Malfoy said instead.
“It’s not as if I’m asking
Potter acted the same the next day. After an uncomfortable check-up wherein Potter barely looked or talked to him, Draco enlisted the help of Betty. He found her in the employee lounge with Leo (he felt very proud sometimes, seeing them get along so well and spending so much time together) and sat down at the table across from them.
Worry turned to surprise turned to annoyance.
“Don’t worry, I’m used to pretending to be normal,” Harry said smilingly.
He moved to the other side of the table in record time and sat down in the seat next to Draco. He took Draco’s hand and squeezed it tight, unable to articulate what he wanted to say. He watched as Draco’s mouth worked soundlessly until finally his eyebrows pinched together and he whispered -
He wiped his palms down his jeans, finally managing to make eye contact with her once more. Her face was still perfectly neutral, reminding Harry of Malfoy.
It was only two PM, but Draco had been at work for nine hours already. He wondered if he could leave early. He’d already finished with his rounds, after all, and he had tomorrow off, barring emergencies. He could feel himself crashing, the caffeine only leaving him with a headache and tired eyes.
Harry’s face must have darkened, because Hermione asked tiredly, “What is it, Harry?”
and loved him?
“No worries. Harry told me what had happened.”
Draco breathed on Harry’s ear, the ghost of a nibble making him shudder with want, but Draco stepped away, a smirk on his face.
“Really?”
“So why’d you become a Healer in the first place? Did you always want to be one?”
“It’s about Potter.”
“Oh, I think it was Two Years Since Harry James Potter Broke Up With Me In A Drunken Rage,” Ginny answered without missing a beat. “You’re right, split-versary is much better.”
“Right, I’ll take my leave, then,” Ira said. “Goodbye Betty. And Draco, don’t be so hard on yourself.”
Draco gave a short laugh at that. "You loved it."
Draco slowed; he recognized Potter’s voice immediately, but he didn’t know if he actually wanted to talk to him. The last time they’d seen each other, they’d both admitted to things one usually didn’t admit to – especially to someone they had such a (rocky) relationship with.
“I can relate,” said Samuel, the man who had spoken earlier. “I’ve also been rather anxious about school and work. It’s only a few weeks into the term but I’m already nervous about several of my classes. It’s worse than usual, so I’m hoping it’ll die down once I get used to things again.”
“I understand it’s someone’s birthday tomorrow!” Kathy smiled brightly and turned to Samuel. “Your favorite is strawberry shortcake, right?”
Harry hadn’t thought that far ahead.
The door opened and a second later, Leonel was seated at the corner of his desk.
“That’s quite all right, Potter.” Malfoy sounded amused. Add that to the list of things that made Draco Malfoy a mystery.
“How are you feeling?
He then heard Draco offer his congratulations. Hermione smiled at him and thanked him warmly, as Ron flushed.
“It’s alright,” Potter was saying. “It’s alright, Malfoy.”
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco sighed exaggeratedly and slid off Harry. Harry sat up.
“Even better,” Potter laughed. “You’ll get to see how much you’ve grown, and Hermione might feel better.”
Harry’s heart thudded sickeningly in his chest. “It’s – it’s fine, Draco. We can just forget that it happened, do it right –“
“I.” Potter shook his head. Stepped back. “I don’t know.”
“No, I don’t think so,” Draco said. “It’s still quite new.”
Leo frowned at him a bit but kept his tone light and concentrated on a paperweight he’d picked up from Draco’s desk.
“No one,” Draco said hurriedly. “And he’s not,” he added for good measure.
“Come on, Harry,” Ginny said, her voice softer now but still firm, “You’re smarter than this. You’re
“Er, nice to meet you. And it’s no problem.”
"Oh," breathed Hermione.
“Fine.”
Harry looked mortified.
“But then you wouldn’t do it for me,” Potter grinned cheekily. Draco bit his lip to keep from smiling.
“It’s not so bad,” Draco said, slightly offended, “Once you get past all the formulas.”
Ron’s jaw was clenched and Harry could tell he was chewing on words that threatened to escape. Harry partially wanted Ron to just spit it out and get it over with, but the other part didn’t know if he could handle his best mate yelling at him on top of everything else.
“Draco, if you’re trying to be discreet, you need to take a look at yourself in the mirror before going out in public,” said Pansy as she turned toward him, hands already reaching for his hair. She smoothed it out patiently with skilled fingers. “There. You nearly look acceptable now.”
Then tentatively, Harry slid Draco's sleeve up, exposing the marked forearm. He glanced up, and Draco nodded tensely.
Draco tried to be alright with it, he really did, but then he found himself asking, “Don’t you care if people see?”
“Don’t apologize,” Draco said as he threw it over himself.
The expression on her face sent an icy dagger through Harry's heart, dissolving the happy memory. He'd disappointed Hermione before, but never like this. Never to this extent. His jaw clenched as he nodded.
“No, it was...uh,” he mumbled, squinting at a spot to the right of Harry. “He just doesn't mind.”
“Really, Potter, it’s flattering that you pay that much attention to me,” he said, rolling his eyes at Potter before starting up the stairs again.
Harry thanked her and Flooed back to Malfoy’s office. He tumbled out, landing gracelessly on his hands and knees on the cold tiled floor. It smarted slightly, and he winced.
“I can’t risk it. And at any rate, it would be a waste of everyone’s time. Pomfrey can’t do anything about it;” –
“The entirety of the female population of the wizarding world,” said Ginny as if it was obvious.
to say that I had to work to get him to like me. It didn’t happen instantaneously! I had to be extra nice,” she explained, fixing Leo with a stern look. “So maybe you were just not being nice enough.”
I don’t have time for this, Draco almost said, but he realized Potter would just capture him again. Draco hesitated. He wished he had something to do with his hands, or better yet, that he wasn’t here at all. He settled with leaning his back against the cold wall and crossing his own arms.
Ginny stopped short, and he knew it must have been written all over his face.
When Harry got home that evening, he sat on the couch in the living room for a bit just to think. Kreacher asked if he could get Harry anything, anything at all, but Harry declined. He had to review what had happened. He needed to remember every detail. He just had to think.
Leonel put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, his face solemn. Draco tensed infinitesimally but let it stay there, allowing himself to briefly enjoy the feel of physical contact from another person.
But Harry didn’t think he could bear to see the disappointment and pain again in Hermione’s face, in Ron…in Ginny. He’d let them down so many times by saying he’d stop, saying that this was the last time, swearing that he was clean and sober and
Pansy’s face was both curious and worried.
"What else, Harry?"
“It’s nice.”
Blaise walked in front of them, his eyes scanning the room, undoubtedly in search of the alcohol. Draco wondered if that was a better way to relieve oneself of their sorrows than smoking. It was a toss-up, he decided.
“Alright,” said Harry, up for the challenge. He counted them off on his fingers. “He’s rude, arrogant, patronizing, dismissive – and he was a prejudiced wanker ‘till just a few years ago.”
“It was,” Harry insisted, though he knew it must have sounded silly. “We – God, we were always fighting and competing…just being general shits to each other. We were in these houses, each with our own sports teams, and we’d get points for doing well in classes or lose them for breaking rules. I’m sure you can imagine what that led to. It, er, got out of hand at times.”
"Well, that's unexpected. But what's this have to -"
“So, who would like to go first today?” Kathy asked, looking around at the group. Unlike last time, no one volunteered. With a smile on her lips, she continued scanning the room, evidently trying to pick a “volunteer.” Her brown eyes landed on Malfoy. “Draco, would you be willing?”
Hermione seemed at a loss for words.
“I’m an idiot,” Harry repeated.
“Yeah,” he managed to say despite the lump in his throat. Wanting to move away from the topic, he asked Hermione, “You told Ginny?”
“Tea. Chamomile, if there’s any,” Potter answered.
Pansy stood and walked around the table to reach Draco. She looked at him evenly with pursed lips, like she already knew what to expect from him.
Encouraged, Draco began moving up and down Harry’s cock, working his tongue in different ways. His hands found Harry’s thighs and he rubbed and squeezed them, wanting to feel more of him, wanting to get more out of him. He slid his tongue across the length of the cock, focused on the head, and went all around, trying to find what Harry
"Oh please," she said as if it was obvious. "I'd be the perfect girlfriend. And you wouldn't be competing against someone who could be a bloody model."
– scanned them all before his eyes landed on one number in particular.
He was hit with a wave of self-loathing, a hatred for himself that was so visceral that Draco felt sick with it. He pushed his sleeves down with more force than necessary.
Not that he blamed her at all. No, he knew he was a rubbish boyfriend. What with the insomnia and panic attacks and dreamless sleep and alcohol, he was a nightmare to live with. He absolutely commended her for sticking with him for so long. He hoped he wouldn't drive her away this time, too.
A soft cough interrupted his thoughts; Draco jumped and turned, expecting Pansy or Blaise. Instead, Potter was standing there, swaying a bit with a drink in hand.
He was so different from the boy Harry knew at Hogwarts. He was no longer callous and rude, calling out insults or choreographing out ways he could hurt Harry. This Malfoy was straight-forward, dedicated, and intelligent. He clearly cared for his patients and coworkers. He could still be a bit of a git, sure, but he was generally patient and understanding - even with Harry, and he knew that he had to have been a nightmare the first few days he'd been in St Mungo's. Harry thought that he had a good enough reason to be, but he was still embarrassed by his behavior. Despite this, Malfoy didn't relinquish his duties, and Harry was grateful for it. Treating Harry seemed to be Malfoy's priority, putting their old rivalry to rest.
“You’re anything but,” Draco agreed, though this didn’t do much to assuage Harry. He sighed. “You really don’t feel that we’d be moving too fast?”
They’d made it to the eighth-year dormitories; Draco muttered the password to the portrait and gone through the portrait hole as soon as it’d opened, leaving Astoria dumbfounded and alone in the corridor.
could live, so
“I want you to be happy, Draco,” she said. “I don’t want you to hang around these people if they aren’t making you happy. You come first.”
Potter cocked his head. “What d’you mean?”
“Is that what you were doing last year? Looking for these…Horcruxes?”
Draco nodded, his mouth set in a slight frown.
Without a word, Johnny passed the note to Harry, still sniffling and staring at the ceiling. Harry's brain was already buzzing with excitement as he knelt over the table –
For the next two weeks, Potter ignored him.
“Yeah,” said Harry distractedly, who was now searching for his glasses.
Weasley joined her, his face pale and leg bouncing up and down where he sat.
Draco watched Leonel as he concentrated on the television. Leo was enraptured, his eyes glued to the screen, his chin dug into the palm of his hand. Draco could barely bite down his smile as he stared at the other man, enjoying the now rare sight of Leo relaxing at home.
Wolff nodded. "That's good."
It was a Saturday, and Draco had pretended to be asleep long enough for Blaise to leave for breakfast without him.
“I just didn’t want you to have the wrong impression from me,” Draco said again. “That’s all. I…admire you, Potter, and I liked the way we actually got on for a moment there. Still, nothing can come of it because – “
When he’d come back with a latte and an éclair, Ginevra was gone. Potter looked at him glumly.
Draco began thrusting slowly, his cock tight and warm, and placed his hands on Harry’s arse, taking hold of him. Harry shuddered underneath him.
“It’s killing you slowly,” Potter said. He seemed frustrated. “Why wouldn’t I care?”
Harry pulled back and collapsed next to Draco. Draco thought about how fortunate he was, considering their past, Draco’s actions, his position in the war, his instability…he remembered his actions today and felt a twinge of guilt. Draco sighed, his gaze leaving Harry.
he was hung. Draco had almost forgotten.
“It makes sense, Harry. You shouldn’t be ashamed of feeling this way,” Luna said kindly. “Would you like to fight with Draco again?”
“No, moment’s passed. Better luck next time, Potter.”
“So it’s Greengrass then?”
“I just still can’t believe you’re all so chummy with the Slytherins.”
“No, I.” Draco took a deep breath, trying to work up the nerves. His tongue was already looser than usual, but it was still difficult to voice his thoughts. But Potter had to know; Draco owed him that much. “I understand. It feels wrong to me too.”
He brushed his fingers against the love bite he had just given Harry, who shivered in response.
He signaled the bartender over and ordered another drink. He needed to get over his slump.
Astoria rolled her eyes. “Don’t be a prat. I’ve half a mind to take you to Pomfrey.”
“I don’t know, because you love to suffer?”
“Yes,” Harry gasped.
It’d started off a normal day.
“No, you were right. I know he’s changed,” Harry said truthfully. “But then I think about everything he’s said and done and I just – it’s a bit confusing going from thinking you know someone to realizing you don’t know them at all, and you haven’t for years.”
“I dunno.”
“And follow me?” Draco asked, bemused.
“Look,” Harry said. “I know my limits. I know what I can talk about. I know what I want to tell you – and there’s a lot, to be honest. I…feel like I can tell you anything.”
"Yes, and...?" Draco turned back around to the sink and his reflection. There was still a hint of smeared blood on his face, though it was quickly drying. He washed his hands.
It was like it wasn't even his body. He wasn't real. A little bit of blood had dribbled down to his upper lip again, and he wiped at it.
going to get into a snit for such a trivial thing. He just had to relax.
Harry’s heart was beginning to race. “Oh yeah?”
He was just starting to sit up again when the door opened and Healer Estrada came in.
“Don’t worry, Harry,” added Abbott.
“Yes, you prat. You’re my boyfriend.”
His heart lifted ever-so-slightly when Potter grinned at that.
“Morning, Ernie. Mind if I sit here?” he was asking as Draco drew close.
Potter nodded, his ability to speak apparently having gone away.
“I didn’t understand it at first, either, but when I see them together, it makes much more sense.”
. I swear to God, I feel the most alive when I’m with him and I know it doesn’t make sense but it’s
Harry wiped the sweat off his palms on his trousers and tried to keep a neutral face as he met Malfoy’s gaze. Malfoy was doing a better job of it than he was, Harry was certain, with his grey eyes indiscernible and mouth set in a familiar line.
“Ron,” Harry answered excitedly. He finished securing the note and waved his arms at the small owl. “Go, Noc, go!”
curious. He wondered what kind of witch would study what was widely a Muggle profession.
The fact that Potter was showing real emotion sent a strange thrill through Draco. The fool Gryffindor was gritting his teeth and looking around as if
“Draco?” Harry asked his retreating back, but Draco kept walking towards the kitchen, his hands curling into fists. He stood up as well but froze where he stood, unsure if he should approach Draco. “I’m sorry – was that too much? I’m not used to this, I haven’t done
"Yes, of course I can take him," she said after she had finished, and closed the files and returned them to Draco. "Pass along my contact details to him and we will arrange an appointment whenever you deem appropriate. I’d also like a copy of your institution’s files, whenever it is convenient."
“When you manhandled me and forced me to talk to you,” Draco put in.
Finally, she beckoned him to follow as she went to return it to the bookshelf.
“And yet,” repeated Harry in a resigned way.
Sharing a pained look with Hermione from where he sat in the armchair opposite hers, Harry shouted—in his inside voice, of course—at James to stop encouraging Rose while giving himself whiplash trying to spot where Albus had disappeared to. This was most Thursdays for the two of them: she took an early mark to give Ron a half day with George in the shop and brought Rose and Hugo over for a playdate. Their two youngest were down for a nap, thankfully, but they were rapidly discovering new reasons as to why it was called the Terrible Twos.
Opting to ignore pleasantries in place of bluntness, Harry stood across the desk from where he sat and squared his shoulders, trying to exert more confidence than he felt at seeing Draco again. “Albus told me you’re divorced,” he began, the accusation clear in his voice.
They spent some time after that in silence, Harry hoping for a breakthrough on this case while Ginny perused the weekend headlines and decimated gingerbread cookies. When he was halfway through his cup of tea, Harry looked up to see Ginny watching him.
“I think you should leave.”
He felt another involuntary gulp coming as he tried to form the words in his mouth. Swallowing it down, Harry exhaled and dropped his gaze. “Er. A lot, I guess.” Lifting his eyes to her again he saw her brow furrow before quickly adding, “I’m sorry. I should have seen you sooner. It’s just… I’ve been busy, Gin.”
She’d gotten stronger with all the Chaser training, it seemed. Harry’s head screamed in protest from where it had made contact with the wall and he frowned, unsure what he had done to deserve this rough treatment.
That seemed to cheer Dean up enough as both men cheered, drawing a toothy grin from Harry as he stepped down off the barstool. Flicking them a thumbs up he made his way through the crowded pub and squeezed past the cluster of stools at the end of the bar, finally stepping into the bathroom and able to draw the sheet of names from his pocket along with a whittled down pencil stub that he could barely get his fingers around.
“Mm. Oh, almost forgot to tell you! Dean’s chuffed about your suggestion. He got chatting with Pansy last night and let me just say, I don’t think there’s going to be any issues there.”
“They still can be,” Harry whispered, gloved hand brushing against Draco’s. “They are, actually.”
“Harry James Potter.”
chapter warnings: mulled wine!
“Oh.” Harry was more confused than ever, unsure what this meant about last Christmas. “How would that even work?”
he thought. “Have you been avoiding me?”
Harry turned, coming face to face with Astoria as expected. He tried to smile as he watched her eyes rake over him, but it seemed like a tight grimace was all that his face was capable of.
Merlin, he needed help thinking this through. He was never one to turn to others for assistance though and he doubted that now would be his time to start. There was just so much struggle and confusion buried underneath the surface of his defeated Death Eater exterior that he didn't know what to do with.
Hermione shot him a sympathetic smile as she handed galleons over to Seamus. “Oh, Harry. You wouldn’t have listened to a word we said.” Turning to the rest of them, she sighed. “That’s enough now, leave them to it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He swore as he considered this. Why couldn’t things ever just be normal for him? When he left the house this morning he hadn’t intended on ending up in St Mungo’s. He certainly hadn’t intended to get put on a strict no stimulant order without a solution to his nightmare situation.
“Is this about what Astoria said?” Harry gulped, seeing Draco’s shoulders flinch slightly at his words. “Because I don’t care—”
“Tell him. Even if you realise you don’t want anything at all, Potter, just bloody tell him. Make sure you tell him soon and don’t expect him to wait around if you mess it up now, because Merlin knows he’s been waiting a while for you to stop being such a fool.”
“Stop looking at me like the world is ending and it’s all your fault. I’m a big girl. Also, you’re not allowed to hurt me and then make it all about you.”
“Are you going to reach out?”
“I suppose?” Harry turned back towards them, realising that his hair piece was long gone. “It felt like I did, but when I tried to come closer, I couldn’t move. Snake anatomy appears to be something I have to figure out before that.” He frowned as he spoke. “I became a snake, huh… It really doesn’t feel real.”
Bill, who was not too fond of ‘being a Weasley’, nodded. “I guess I am. Call me Bill, though.”
“Please, I overcame that when I was twelve,” Draco laughed weakly and shook his head. “You’ve improved my mental health quite some this year through the knowledge that you’ve kept Harry company when he needed it. Not that he is a puppy who demands constant company or anything, but it was very emotionally calming to know that he had someone as reliable as you to keep him company.”
“Are you threatening me?” Lucius’ grey eyes widened as he baffledly attempted to understand the words which had been directed at him.
Harry tried to softly bite down on his lips to stop from smiling, but it didn’t quite work so he averted his gaze as well, trying to regain his composure. Colin had obviously just flirted with him, which was both flattering and thrilling, although it didn’t really mean anything more than that Harry had appreciated the gesture more than he had disliked it.
“Weak,” Sirius grinned at Harry as he pushed the lettuce closer to him.
Thus it was that Neville came to sit next to Harry on the sofa, as Professor Slughorn returned the armchair to the other end of the table so that he could focus on them fully. Harry wasn’t convinced that this was a good idea, but he trusted Neville enough to go along with his plan, and he told Professor Slughorn about the manner in which he was expected to act, and what people he had modelled himself after in his efforts to act collected and pleasant, yet not unprofessional. Neville drank his tea, but Harry had mostly forgotten it as he spoke.
“You mean the world to me as well, dad,” Harry assured him as he returned the hug, smiling into the man’s chest.
“Severus, how pleasant to see you.” The Dark Lord greeted him as he stepped inside the room, before slowly and painstakingly gesturing towards the bed itself, inviting him to sit down as there was no chair or stool next to the Dark Lord’s bed.
Molly could not accept such a thing.
“Yeah, I have, but I felt sort of guilty about it,” Teddy pushed Harry’s book towards him, reminding him that he needed to bring it with him as they left the classroom.
Sirius clicked his tongue as he avoided the other man’s gaze, he wasn’t quite able to face that reality just yet. “Hey, were you friends with Reg back then? I never cared to keep track of him or his friends.”
“Speak to me!” Lavender Brown pleaded as she held onto Ron’s pale yet still Quidditch equipped hand. “Tell me what you need,” she whispered as her eyes yet again filled with tears.
“Ask the man I’ve been tasked to kill if I should kill him or not…?” Draco scoffed and shook his head. “That will never work…”
While George was still uncomfortable with his twin wanting to spend time with Angelina Johnson, he was not uncomfortable with the young woman herself. She was evidently happy with Fred, and Fred was very much in love with her in return. George could see that they were having fun, and he wasn’t even all that jealous of the fact that he wasn’t really needed in their lives for the moment. What did make him uncomfortable, and what he wanted to speak to Fred about, was the future of their joke company.
The Head of the Slytherin House signalled for Draco to speak, thus, he continued.
Even then, Tom had never done what Crabbe was currently doing.
“You did it, wonderful indeed,” Draco agreed with Neville.
Her friend clapped her hands, grinning from ear to ear. “You got it!”
Harry had told Draco the news, and the two of them had subsequently made an effort to retell it to all their friends so as to not have anyone be removed from the knowledge of the group. Harry had called Colin to inform him of the new Headmistress while Draco had written to Luna to inform her and thank her for the holiday card which she had made for all of them. It had been sent to Malfoy Manor for the sake of reaching all of Luna’s friends. The card itself depicted a complicated piece of magical pop-up art, depicting a lion, snake and eagle sleeping together, with a badger napping close by. Luna had written within the card that she included the badger since she hadn’t wanted it to feel left out.
Harry spun around after he was fully braided. He beamed at his boyfriend who returned the smile. “How do I look?”
“Ted and Nyhm are my family now. If you want to be family again, you’ll have to work for it.” Andromeda winked at her sister. “In return, I will of course try the same. It is not only up to you. These things do go two ways.”
I pull myself free and follow him, feeling the emotions cluster in my throat as I chase after the child who I should have no right to comfort. Behind me in the living room, my dad and my brother begin to argue about El but I can’t hear them, I’m busy with Tom. I hear his running steps in the stairs and I hear a door slam. When I reach the top of the stairs, I notice that the bathroom door is locked and I know where he is.
Harry shoved them in his mouth before he could talk himself out of it, dry-swallowed, put the bag back into the pocket of his jeans, and Apparated back home.
will you tell me how you two know each other?”
“We all did,” Harry said quietly. “I can tell he’s changed. It’s just – strange.”
Harry paused, then asked, “How long
(and Draco’s nearly worthless life).
When he was finished, Harry crawled up to lie next to Draco, who was panting, his hair awry. Harry made to cuddle but Draco stopped him with a hand to his chest.
“I don’t know about mates. We’ve definitely gone out together, Malfoy, Blaise, and me. Sometimes their friends join us, and sometimes it’s Ron and Hermione. He’s really not that bad. He can be funny, you know, and he’s dead serious about his job. And you know I
Malfoy passed him the menu. “This place has exceptional carbonara, if that’s your taste.”
She didn’t finish either of her sentences before withdrawing her hand and standing up. Harry dimly watched Ginny leave the room and recognized the distant
“I’ve waited longer,” Draco said, stopping to undo Harry’s shirt as quickly as he could with shaking hands.
“Perhaps,” he said uncomfortably. “Do you?”
, Ginny,” he said, slightly annoyed but honestly, he couldn’t blame her. He added, “He’s a he, by the way.”
“So would you say your animosity towards him is gone for the most part, at least?”
Draco blanched. “And suffer the inquisitive eyes of Granger and Weasley? No thank you.”
“Fine, yes, as long as Blaise comes.”
Harry was able to keep the ruse going for another week and a half before it all went to shit.
“And obviously, I chose to go back, but sometimes…it feels like I should have stayed,” Harry finished quietly.
Shivers went down Draco’s spine. He let go and sat up straight.
He wanted to banish himself from the world.
“Ah,” said Draco guiltily. “And how are they?”
Ginny moved from the chair to the bed, sitting next to him so their thighs touched. She took Harry’s hand in her own and leaned her head against his shoulder, the smell of her hair wafting up towards Harry’s face. He squeezed her hand, and she squeezed back.
Pansy made a face. “He’s with that dreadful Ginny Weasley. You should have seen the way they were on the train, all over each other without a care in the world.”
The look on Ginevra’s face was inscrutable.
"I can't believe you think I would've done that."
He cast an apologetic look at Draco, who just grew pinker. Hermione shifted.
“Sorry to disappoint you,” Draco drawled.
He was (and Harry hated even thinking this) cute. Draco Malfoy was cute.
“Yeah. But we had a heart-to-heart,” – Ginny muttered ‘
“At least you recognize that.”
“You did it again,” he said. “So who’s this ‘someone’? Must be pretty important if they’ve been distracting you
“Good morning, Ira,” Draco greeted, straightening up a bit in his plastic chair.
Draco dug his hands into Leo’s shoulders and screwed his eyes shut as Leo swirled his tongue around Draco’s cock, his own hands grasping Draco’s thighs. Leonel sucked him off like an expert, taking him whole and sucking hard and licking and swirling and –
Harry felt his face heat up as he remembered where he was, and why, and with who.
Draco blinked in surprise. A strange confrontation, weeks of silence, and now a proposal of friendship? He was dreaming. Or Potter’s logic didn’t work like the logic of most people. Or both.
Wiping them impatiently on his trousers, Harry left the safety of his room and closed the door shut, hearing the tiny click as he did so.
"I’ll be right back, Mr. Potter," said Estrada before leaving promptly.
There were a few tense moments before Malfoy stiffly said, “It’s alright, Potter.”
“Yes, I did,” Malfoy said, his face rather expressionless. “Do you feel any pain?”
“I know.”
Draco’s hands went to the bottom of Harry’s shirt; he had to see him. They parted so Draco could pull it over his head, and Merlin, he’d never get used to the sight. He wondered how Harry stayed so toned, and when it had happened. He’d been so scrawny as a teenager.
Hermione’s mouth dropped into a near-perfect ‘O,’ and Ron continued his visual examination of Draco.
“Potter? What’s he have to do with anything?”
Draco answered with a hard smack. Harry moaned and Draco slapped his arse again, harder this time.
Harry’s brows furrowed. “Oh, Ginny? No, not really. We really didn’t date for that long. As long as she’s happy, I’m happy.”
Draco nodded, looked at Potter once more, and left.
“Draco, that’s all you did for six years,” she said, rolling her eyes. “But really. I’m happy for you. You look better.”
to talk about it.”
“I didn’t know you cared about your appearance,” said Draco, but his grey eyes ran up and down Harry appreciatively. Harry shifted uncomfortably, tugging at the sleeve of his dark emerald sweater. “You look more than alright, Harry. I could fuck you senseless right now.”
Draco pulled back reluctantly. Harry raised his eyebrows but complied, lifting himself off Draco. He moved so Harry could lay down. Draco took in the sight as he positioned himself over Harry’s hips. Draco could hardly believe this was happening; Harry Potter was underneath him – how many times had he wished for this, thinking it was a desperate, sick fantasy?
“Can I tell them?” Harry asked Draco, who nodded curtly. He then said to his two best friends, “At group.”
“Are they what your nightmare was about?”
They ate and watched as the true story of a triple-murder unfolded before them, complete with second-rate reenactments and poorly done narration.
“Thanks, Harry,” Draco mumbled sleepily, and Harry thought his heart might burst.
didn’t have enough mental power to deal with this right now. He forced himself to focus on what she’d said.
The way they said ‘dream’ made Draco feel dirty.
“Just try, alright?” Potter asked so gently, so uncharacteristically tender, that Draco nodded instead of trying to fight him.
“Just you? What do you mean, just you?”
“I assure you that it’s quite the opposite, Potter,” Draco replied, taking care to keep his tone professional and neutral. “This is no laughing matter.”
Draco was standing over Harry now, who was staring up at him with an unreadable expression.
Draco’s courage was worth it to see Harry’s reaction.
Hermione nodded, her eyes wary and deep in thought. She snapped back into it and invited them to sit down. They complied; Harry and Draco on one side of the table and Ron and Hermione on the other. The former pair helped themselves to some of the steaming food, and Harry was suddenly very hungry. The latter watched them eat, Ron’s visual investigation much more obvious than Hermione’s.
Harry nudged Draco with his elbow, then said, “Anyway, anything’s gotta be better than last Christmas.”
“Well,” Draco said, taking it all in, “I’m glad I could be a small part of that.”
“You’re next,” he smirked devilishly, pushing him down on the bed.
“I know, Draco, I’m just making simple observations.” He turned away. “Anyway, hurry up if you want to get breakfast.”
When he didn’t respond, Harry asked, “Draco?”
“Mr. Potter
"You shouldn't have to do this. You should be with Zabini, and I should be a normal person."
"Well, it was good of you to come. Especially with the distance..."
Samuel gave a lopsided smile, but it faded slightly.
“Oh.” Harry wondered if it was true. “Erm, thanks. I guess group is helping.”
“I –“ began Draco before flushing and clamping his mouth shut.
“Not really.”
, staring at him with concern in his curiously green eyes. Potter, standing in front of him with messy black hair and a still too-skinny frame and an oversized jumper.
They stood like that for another minute or so before parting. Pansy looked up at him.
Harry blinked, processing. He had only spoken to Damien a few times, and Harry didn’t think he’d made that good of an impression.
Draco looked him square in the eye, meeting the other man’s gaze even as more tears fell down his cheeks. He bit his bottom lip to keep it from quivering. Potter looked back at him unflinchingly, steadily. There was a softness in his eyes, and Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen them so up-close. And then he was reaching out at Draco.
Draco let out a shuddering breath. This incredible man, someone who had been through so much, had
Malfoy stepped back so Ginny could enter the room, and with a final nod, he left and closed the door behind him.
force you.”
"What's that?" Ron was asking quietly, but Harry's pulse was so loud that he could barely concentrate on what they were saying.
“Fuck, I’m going, I’m going to-“
Malfoy eyed him, though there was no ice in his stare.
Malfoy frowned but stood and withdrew his wand.
“I’m still annoyed at you too,” Ron said stubbornly. “She’s fine, she’s at the Burrow.”
"It's Saturday morning, Harry," she explained, guilt on her face. As it sunk in, she bit her lip and continued. "And you didn’t come for drinks yesterday either, so when you didn't come this morning, I got worried and came over..."
. Well, it’s true, and Potter was using it to follow me around in the dead of night.”
"Good," Ron said, giving a tense nod of his own.
It was only when he looked into the mirror that he saw that his nose was bleeding. He touched a finger to it and looked down at it in slight surprise. He'd never seen that before.
Draco swallowed thickly and tried to shake himself out of his stupor. This was definitely not the time nor place for thoughts like those. He really didn’t want it to happen. There were hundreds of different situations in which this would have been equally as shocking and confusing, but still at least twelve times better. You are not supposed to be attracted to someone who’s circling around a murderer, someone who may be fearing for his life, Draco scolded himself silently. What’s wrong with you? What would your mother say?
“Alright,” said Draco. “If you do, you always can.”
“Oh yeah? And how do you reckon I’ll start that conversation?” Potter asked bitterly. “Hey Ginny, how are things? Also, I never told you, but I died in May.”
He flipped it open to his favorite picture of his parents – the one of them dancing. Harry stared hard at it, blinking back tears, and studied it for the thousandth time. They’d been so young,
Harry shook his head.
“Oh no,” she said, blue eyes wide. “I’ve only tried
Draco thought that he had about five drinks. He wasn’t even sure what kind of drinks they were, to be honest. Something cheap and Gryffindor-like. There were so many Gryffindors here.
“Well, it’s too late now,” Ginny scowled. She looked up at Luna. “Did you know about this, love?”
It had to have been before Ron had given him a stern talk about Not Drinking to Relieve the Pain of Existence, because Harry was now very careful when drinking while in pleasant company. He didn’t want to end up completely sloshed and yelling about how he wanted to die in front of old classmates.
Weasley was glaring at Pansy but kept silent.
“Oh, Harry. You should try to focus on recovery. That's the most important thing for you right now, and nothing should jeopardize you getting better. Especially when you're so close to getting released. Maybe...maybe you're having these feelings for Draco because you're around him so much, he's been helping you and guiding you and you've sort of latched onto him...? He is the person you've been seeing and talking to the most recently."
Weeks passed, then months. Draco wasn’t sure if he was losing weight – he knew he was only seeing a distorted image of himself. Still, he studied his reflection any chance he got. Touching, squeezing, grasping his skin, his
Pansy’s eyes flickered over to Draco in annoyance.
He gave a little sigh that might have shaky.
Leo released him obediently, and Draco let out a shuddering breath. His neck was still burning.
“Yes,” Draco said, his face still warm. “She did.”
“Yeah?” said Harry, excited at the prospect at seeing Draco’s flat for the first time. “Let’s go. I haven’t been to yours before.”
Harry backed away and turned on his heel, nearly barreling back into his room, back into safety.
Harry Potter. Even after eight years, it all comes back to him. Draco didn’t even know why he spent so much time dwelling on the prat. It’s not like he was even thankful, or nice…
“How do you always look so good, Potter,” Draco asked as he bent forward, his breath tickling Harry’s ear. “Even when you throw on week-old clothes, you still look so
“Is that…?” Draco walked closer and took it from Harry.
Harry kissed back gently, slowly; he seemed to be savoring it just as much as Draco. Too soon, they came up for air and Draco’s face felt hot as they stared at each other. Even now, Draco grew flustered when Harry looked at him that way – he still couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that
Harry smiled at them and wondered when Ron was going to propose. They were, quite honestly, meant for each other.
“Good luck, mate,” Ron said, clapping Harry on the back. He glanced over at Malfoy, then back at Harry. “And don’t kill him.”
Samuel nodded while Draco said, “Yes, it was.”
“Oh, er, well.” Potter scratched his head nervously. “Do you remember during the battle, when a Death Eater was trying to hurt you but someone stopped them? And then you got punched?”
They were almost done with the first stage of the process when Potter responded.
, I’m gay. Does that satisfy your curiosity?”
Harry reached up to cup Draco’s face and Draco couldn’t help the little gasp that came out of his mouth. His eyes were even more startling this close, surrounded by thick lashes Draco was a bit jealous of. Draco’s heart was thudding in his ears so loudly he could barely focus on how Harry was coming closer, closer...
“Draco,” Harry said, “I’ve never – never – not with a bloke. Or anyone.”
"Christ, don't remind me of that," Harry mumbled.
“What are you thinking about, Harry?”
“Potter, if you know what’s good for you, you’ll be quiet,” Draco threatened, though there was an amused smile on his face.
“You’re most likely dehydrated. Shall I get you a glass of water?”
Harry didn’t even know what to say. Luckily, he was saved in the nick of time by Samuel approaching the group. Damien smiled his wide smile and greeted Samuel with a pat on the back.
“I’m just thinking about the last time we were here,” Harry said, and relished in how Draco’s cheeks flushed pink, “And how it all began.”
“You make a face when you’re about to say something clever,” Harry told him through laughs. “Or something you think is clever, I should say.”
Wolff watched as he spoke, nodding at the right intervals. She wrote something down, and then said,
The dream left Draco shaken. He wanted desperately to forget it – Potter was a
“That was five days ago.”
He waited for Wolff to respond, and when she didn’t, he continued.
“Alright, lads?” she asked, a knowing smirk on her face.
“I…” said Harry and trailed off weakly, unable to think of a counterargument.
Hermione squealed, and Ron let out a loud, excited laugh.
“Harry, mate...” Ron finally said weakly, “When will this obsession with Malfoy end?”
Harry exhaled. One more week before he was released back into the world. Before he was released as a sober man with what felt like an impossible task: staying sober.
possible if you leave tomorrow.”
"Please sit down. Would you like some tea? Coffee, perhaps?"
“Good,” said Draco weakly.
Draco snapped his head up and immediately regretted it, his head aching with a newfound vengeance and his vision swirling. He blinked at the figure approaching him and could make out…of course.
“It’ll get easier,” Ginny had said before patting his shoulder and walking away.
“That’s fine, Harry,” she said.
Harry did as he was told, and Draco shuddered. His trembling hands ran from Harry’s shoulder, covered in the thin cloth, to his arse, bare and ready for Draco.
about himself?”
Malfoy had aged quite well - scratch that, incredibly well. His eyes seemed warmer somehow, reminding Harry of Sirius now more than anything. They used to be so hard and cold, but now they seemed softer. More open. Was that even possible? It all could’ve just been in Harry’s head - in fact, it probably was.
Harry didn’t know what to say to that so he took another sip.
Johnny tightly rolled a five-pound note and bent over the table. Harry watched as he snorted one of the four lines quickly, straightening his back and tilting his head up.
"...was really upset," Estrada was murmuring, his dark brows pulled together.
a recovering addict, after all. There were plenty of things happening in Potter’s life right now – there was certainly no shortage of stress factors. Maybe it was, in fact, conceited of Draco to think that it was his fault, his doing.
A light cough snapped him out of his daze. Harry looked up and his eyes widened in surprise; Malfoy was standing next to him. He wondered when they had last stood so close.
hated himself.
Instead, he watched Betty wave her wand and mumble something under her breath. The warmth that blossomed unnaturally in his chest was familiar by now, as were the numbers that appeared in the air above him. Her eyebrows furrowed as she noted them down on the files at the foot of the bed.
“Yes, perfectly fine, thanks.”
“I will.”
Halfway through, Kathy released them for break. Harry turned to face Samuel in his chair.
Draco never failed to disappoint.
“You’re really calling me a coward?” Potter yelled back. Draco flinched infinitesimally. “That’s rich, considering it’s coming from Draco bloody Malfoy!”
Harry remembered himself. He took his hand back and opened the door, his face hot once more.
“Is there perhaps a place where the two of you could meet in the middle? Someplace that reminds her of your old life together, and someplace that doesn’t hold such negative memories for you?”
They stood in silence for a few moments, the wind whistling past them and making them shiver.
Draco woke the next morning disoriented, feeling unsettled for whatever reason. It only took a few moments for him to remember that it was because of the awful text message he’d sent Potter. He lay in bed a few moments, wishing that he’d never sent the stupid text in the first place. He’d never listen to Ira again.
“It’s ok, Draco, I believe you,” Leo said earnestly. He studied him for a moment, and then said, “Is he why you don’t want to get back together?”
He sighed in exasperation, knowing the battle was already lost.
, for Salazar’s sake, and Leonel was no longer his. But no matter how hard he tried to focus on other things, the image of Potter staring at him tenderly floated to the forefront of his mind. It was just his luck that the one dream he wanted to forget insisted on staying, refusing to fade away like they usually did.
She blinked at him. “You look
Ginny shrugged. "Everyone's got their thing."
It barely worked.
,” Harry cut across him, eyes flashing. Draco’s words died in his throat; this was the Harry who was confident and powerful - the one who had saved the world. “Don’t worry about it.”
“The first one is fine,” he said, raising his head and handing it back to Malfoy. “10 on Monday.”
“I know.”
“Oh? You’re obsessed with me?” Harry asked, eyebrow raised.
“Well,” Draco said slowly, “You’ve found me.”
“Oh, they’ve both left,” Cait said. “They regret not being able to say goodbye.”
Potter laughed loudly, his green eyes bright and unsettling Draco all the more.
“What do you mean by ‘a feeling of dread’?” Draco asked.
They made their way over to the kitchen, leaning against the counters as Hermione poured water into the kettle. Draco stuck close to Harry, obviously uncomfortable. Harry inched closer to him, sliding a hand into Draco’s own.
“I’m afraid to tell you that there were numerous potions in Mr. Potter’s system, all of them having to do with inducing sleep or calmness. Fortunately, since many of them have the same sort of ingredients, there isn’t too great a risk. However, the lavender in the Sleeping Draught may have had a bad reaction to the syrup of hellebore in the Draught of Peace, both of which were found in Mr. Potter’s system. It isn’t mortally dangerous, but it would be best to cleanse his system as soon as possible to avoid any permanent damage.
“You’ve got enough on your mind right now, Potter,” Draco said sternly, “And more than enough to keep you busy. You’ve got to focus all of your energies on – “
He’d got himself a laptop and Internet connection a few years after moving in. He often wondered how the Blacks (most of them, anyway) would have felt about the person who’d killed their beloved Dark Lord bringing Muggle technology into their Most Ancient and Decrepit Home.
“No, I can’t,” Harry said, suddenly sounding very tired. He looked up, finally meeting Draco’s eyes. Merlin, it hurt seeing Harry like this. So dejected – so beaten down. “I can’t forget any of it. It – it
“I never would have imagined! That’s horrible.”
, Harry. You should be alive and happy - you deserve that much after everything.”
"Well, either way...I'm honored. Thanks for trusting me with it, Harry."
Everyone he used to be close with were gone. Pansy and his mother had left the country, and Draco missed them terribly. He even missed his father some days. Growing up, Draco was never alone – he always had company, whether it was his parents, their many guests, or the parade of house-elves in their employ.
“What, Greengrass?” he drawled. “You beg to differ?”
He looked down at the food again. Despite his slight nausea, his stomach betrayed him by growling loudly enough for Potter to hear. Draco glared at the git when he’d raised a judgmental eyebrow.
“Yes please,” she said, finally speaking.
“Wouldn’t it be better to just get it over with instead of rushing to get a terrible job done in a week?”
Draco gave a humorless laugh. “Right.”
Ron’s eyes were concerned but he nodded anyway. His gaze drifted over to the clock on the wall.
“Complicated how?” asked Hermione.
“Room fourteen,” Betty answered.
Potter’s green eyes widened slightly, but he didn’t say anything. He must’ve wanted Draco to keep talking, and the words that had been stuck in him for so long fell out.
“I’m not sure,” frowned Draco. He took his wand and cast
Draco flinched at the name spoken so boldly from Potter’s lips and looked down at his lap. Underneath his left sleeve, his forearm seemed to burn. His stomach lurched at the thought of the Dark Lord’s cold voice and stale breath in Draco’s ear, the way he’d talk Draco into torturing people, the threat of his parents’ death and his own hanging over his head all the time.
That time Draco could blame it on the Dark Lord. It was out of fear for the lives of his family that he couldn’t utter a word about what he had to do. That time, it was clear who the guilty party was.
“Do you think you can come back to mine?” Harry asked breathlessly.
Draco turned at her voice.
He breathed out shakily, and continued looking at that spot.
Don’t worry about it, his arse.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. “I’m – I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine what that must have been like, for them to make you feel that way…but Harry, you’re not useless. You matter
“’Adore’ might be too strong a word, White,” Draco seethed. He turned to Betty, who seemed even smaller than usual. “Betty, I just wanted to ask if you gave Potter that nourishment potion.”
“No, it isn’t.”
Draco was once again too stunned to speak by Potter’s honesty.
Draco almost felt grateful to his attacker, in a way, because it’d gotten Potter to talk to him again.
“Christ, Potter, you don’t really think I’m going to leave you to go home like this, do you?”
Harry was surprised by Estrada calling Malfoy by his first name. Not the Head Healer, and not even Healer Malfoy. Just 'Draco.'
. “Remember when you beat my face in after that match in fifth year? As if kicking my arse in Quidditch wasn’t enough, you had to
Draco took the pack of cigarettes out of his coat and shook one out. He placed it in his mouth and used his wand to light it. He took a shaky breath in, savoring the instant relief it gave him.
“I, er, we were. But now we’re…er, boyfriends, I guess,” Harry stepped in, cringing a bit at the word. He turned to Draco, ignoring Ron’s bewildered expression. “I don’t really like – er, how would you feel about partners instead?”
Warning: choking
“Malfoy,” Potter said.
“You say that every year, Draco, and I ignore your advice every year,” Pansy said. She moved closer to the table to gather all the textbooks and slam them shut. “This year won’t be any different.”
Draco considered. He really didn’t want to tempt himself, but he also needed the practice. He’d gotten weak, careless.
"I'm glad. And I’m glad that you're alright."
"I think you might want to keep an open mind. That’s all I can suggest.”
Harry sighed. “You sure?”
Harry shrugged and turned back onto his stomach, allowing Draco free reign over his back. He felt Draco's careful hands run over the inked skin.
,” Daphne said accusingly, pointing a finger at her sister. “We know how to handle our drink perfectly.”
“Do you really drink that?” he asked, looking down at the glass Ira had pushed him with distaste.
Gathering his waning courage, Draco met Potter’s gaze again.
“That sounds like an excuse to me.”
Draco withdrew his hands obediently and watched as Harry pulled off his trousers. He focused his gaze on Harry as he then pulled off Draco’s underwear, feeling his face heat up as his cock came into view.
“Stop saying that,” Draco said, his gaze dropping to his hands, remembering how they looked covered in blood. He curled them into fists. “Nothing I did helped anything – I might as well have identified you.”
Harry shot him a glare.
And then Kreacher appeared, his small mouth wrinkling into a surprised smile.
Harry laid back down, relaxing at Malfoy’s reassurance but still unhappy with the situation. The last thing he’d need right now was for Rita bloody Skeeter to catch wind of this whole thing.
His gaze drifted from Ginny to Hermione and Ron. They’d never yelled at him, which was sort of shocking, thinking back on it. The only thing they ever did was look at him with some horrible mixture of pity and revulsion; they spoke gentle but stern words to him, as if he were a child that was prone to misbehaving.
They were both breathing hard with their eyes trained on each other. Potter seemed to be considering something, deciding if he should say whatever he wanted to.
Harry laughed. “You snitched on me, so I reckon we’re even.”
Even worse, the patient in question was the same person Draco had fancied in his formative years.
“Morning, Hermione. Thank you,” Harry said, stepping to embrace her in a hug. She hugged back, though tensely. “Morning, Ron.”
Draco let out an empty laugh. “And what if that’s what I want?”
?” Draco asked, his tone teetering between angry and bored. God, it was so hot.
“It’s a two-way street, Potter.”
“Is something the matter?” Draco asked, still a bit shaken from seeing Wolff.
“How interesting,” said Harry. “Neither am I.”
“That’s what I thought.”
“Hope you don’t mind Luna’s here,” Ginny said, sitting down and wrapping her hands around her mug.
“We’re best mates,” Weasley said, and Merlin help him, he looked hurt. “You can tell me anything.”
“What?” he asked defensively, stowing his wand away.
, then he would take it.
, what does that have to do with what’s happening now?”
It had never occurred to him that people could like both. That people
“I’m gonna –“
“Alright…?”
For Draco had suddenly made an
“Eleven.”
Whatever progress he had made in the past day was gone, it seemed – Potter looked nearly as bad as he did when he first came in. He was covered in a thin sheen of sweat with heavy bags under his eyes, his hair greasy and unkempt. The ends of his hair curled and stuck to his cheeks. And then, as if to greet Draco, Potter promptly vomited into the bucket at the side of his bed.
“But if you had said you were gay
Harry’s own hands were traveling down Draco’s back and arse, grabbing at him eagerly. His moans reverberated through Draco, the sounds going straight to his cock and making him more and more impatient.
They got to the new patient’s room; Draco knocked on the door and went inside, Betty at his heels. Leonel was tending to the unconscious patient who was laying weakly on the bed.
“Just one thing, and I’ll leave you alone.”
“Well-spotted.”
“I don’t know what I’ll do if I fuck up again.”
Potter slipped away. Draco went back to smoking and gazing into the distance, feeling colder than before.
Draco and Harry went back to Grimmauld Place a half hour later, congratulating the newly-engaged pair yet again before disappearing into the fireplace.
