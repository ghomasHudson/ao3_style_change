“I would. You’re the Director of the Auror Department, use your excellent deductive skills and figure it out yourself, Mr Potter,
Love,
Draco dithered for a few seconds.
Well, here we are, I finally have a new chapter for you.
“Better than good, it was mind-blowing,” he said.
Harry had left the clamps quite loose, but because of the length of time, Draco had been wearing them, his usually already sensitive nipples were now hyper-responsive to the smallest of touches. Harry removed the clamps with the highest level of care and Draco whimpered softly.
Unable to control his annoyance, Draco had thrown a plethora of colourful expletives at Harry, who’d laughed until he’d nearly fallen off his broom. Threatening to hex him, Draco had drawn his wand and promised murder. In response to that, Harry had dared him to chase him with a series of stinging hexes and much to Draco’s lingering exasperation, he’d out-flown every single curse.
(See the end of the chapter for
Scorpius immediate reaction was to stick out his bottom lip in a persistent but utterly adorable pout.
“Director Potter, Sir, I’ve just got a few questions I’d like to ask you. If you wouldn’t mind telling the court, approximately, and please be as precise as you possibly can, how often do you personally appear at a crime scene?”
“Will you be good for me, my love?”
Strangely enough, neither Granger nor Harry ever intervened and stopped them from having a go at each other. Although, Harry had promised him, threatening a harsh spanking with a wooden paddle, that drawing wands and challenging each other to a Wizarding Duel would be taking their petty quarrels one step too far. Harry’s guarantee that he would most definitely not enjoy said spanking but cry bitter tears was enough of an incentive for Draco to control himself to the best of his abilities. He couldn’t help but wonder whether Granger had, perhaps, given Ron similar motivation.
Whenever Harry brushed over a particularly sensitive area of Draco’s marked body, Draco shuddered and sighed softly.
Instead, he firmly reminded himself to stay in the here and now.
Glowering, Draco kept silent.
Rose’s eyes may have sparkled before, but now they shine brighter than the sun. She nods with enthusiasm.
“Nah, you just got started on preparing tea the second we stepped into the kitchen. If I didn’t know that you’re such a chatterbox, I wouldn’t have said anything.”
Draco shook his head from side to side and chuckled.
Giddy, Harry pushed Draco onto his back and eased on top of him.
Harry deliberately hesitated for at least ten seconds, then smirked.
Narcissa chuckled.
The hint of mockery in his eyes ignited Harry’s desire to discipline him, and what Draco had just said only served to egg him on even more. To his delight though, this time, those feelings felt right, and he knew at once that he’d gotten his mojo back. Harry revelled in the mood for a moment, letting it consume him. A very familiar itch in the palm of his right hand caused him to curl and flex his fingers. He shoved his hand into one of the pockets of his jeans and pressed it firmly against the side of his thigh, then breathed deeply and controlled his urge. Now was neither the time nor the place to think about slowly turning the pale milky skin of Draco’s taut arse red.
“No, but I have several ulterior motives.”
’ or a variation thereof. He couldn’t even make heads or tails out of the fact that Potter seemingly always knew when he was at the Ministry either.
Harry’s whispered words of comfort instantly relaxed Draco and his mild bout of panic dissipated and disappeared.
“What a good boy you are, my little prince, using
He took a moment to settle his mind, then launched into a detailed recount of his and Molly’s earlier conversation, watching with amusement as Draco’s eyes widened steadily in complete and utter disbelief.
Draco’s heart thumped wildly in his chest, and slowly ripping the sealed envelope open, he reached inside, and he pulled out a single folded parchment. As he opened it up, his hands began to shake, and he had to take a deep breath to calm himself.
It didn’t often happen that he got to watch Liam put his clothes on.
“Let’s not forget the complete cock-up you made of the series of dates I arranged for you, or the fact that you’ve just been nominated Britain’s Most Eligible Bachelor for the fourth year running.”
“You are insane.”
Draco moaned into the kiss, and in response, Harry tightened his grip and applied even more pressure to Draco’s wrist, silently hoping to leave red marks behind. He knew that whatever marks he was bound to leave on Draco’s milky pale skin, weren’t going to linger for very long but it was the thought of them that ignited something fierce inside Harry’s chest. The secret knowledge of his mark on Draco, however faint, a claim, a sign of ownership; Harry wanted that more than anything.
Harry blinked and straightened up a little more.
Love,
“You two are the perfect pair, I’m going upstairs to have a shower. Any chance I might find tea on the kitchen table when I come down again?”
Given a choice, Harry usually preferred to slowly nurse a tumbler of single-malt whiskey, neat, but tonight, Caleb had convinced him to give Honey Dew Ale a try, and since the alcohol content was low and it wasn’t as heavy as most beers, Harry was rather enjoying himself.
Stefan winced.
Potter grumbled under his breath and defiantly crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco turned his back on him and steeped the tea, then carried the two full mugs over to the table and set them down on coasters. He sat down opposite from Charlie and reaching across the table, Charlie took Draco’s hands and squeezed them lightly, offering more physical comfort.
“I was naughty and didn’t listen when you told me to stop.”
Nodding, Harry abandoned his apple and left the kitchen to head upstairs to check on Draco. He took the stairs two at a time and arrived at the door to his and Draco’s bedroom feeling just a little out of breath. A few deep breaths regulated his pounding heart, and pushing the door open, he walked inside. Draco was indeed awake. He’d curled into a foetal position and looked at him from under lowered lashes.
Harry laughed.
“Who knows?”
Instead, he drew his wand, mumbled a few spells in rapid succession, and left it up to magic to clear away the remnants of Harry’s and his dinner. He didn’t have the head for doing the dishes or anything else.
He paused a few steps short of the large white corner sofa and shoved his hands into the pockets of his black jeans to stop himself from fiddling.
“No. I won’t, at least not in that way. My boy doesn’t like that sort of pain. But I can wrap the fall of my whip around him without leaving the tiniest mark on him. Instead of a nasty red welt, it’ll feel like a tickle.”
It takes Harry about half an hour before he finds a coffee shop that sells good quality coffee, and he immediately heads inside to fuel his ever-prevalent caffeine addiction. Some Auror habits apparently die hard ― not that Harry has any intention of ever giving up on his beloved coffee or limiting how much he drinks of it. The heavenly black stuff, is, after all, his only vice in life and he’ll be damned before he lets anyone take that from him. Even Hermione, who has been on this crazy and exhausting health trip ever since she gave birth to Hugo four years ago―and Harry can’t understand how Ron, with his notorious sweet tooth, copes with it―understands that.
Harry raised an eyebrow at him, and clicking his tongue, he rather impatiently tapped his fingers against his biceps.
Tifereth (
“Please don’t, Director Potter, Sir.”
He shuddered, completely gave in to the pleasurable feeling of Harry wanking him, and spilt his come all over Harry’s hand and the abandoned pillow beneath him. This time the muscles inside his tight channel contracted out of their own accord, and they sent a shiver of intense excitement through Harry.
Harry laughed.
Right this moment, Harry was in charge; he controlled the scene; he called the shots.
A warm rumble of laughter escaped past Draco’s parted lips and his eyes danced with mirth, then he blinked, and a stream of silent tears rolled down his cheek. At the sight, Harry felt himself well up.
“It’s Azkaban for you, my friend, and although you don’t deserve it, I shall be kind enough to bring you before the Wizengamot. These days, even scum like you gets a fair hearing in front of our criminal courts.”
A deep frown creased his forehead, and he chewed on the inside of his lower lip.
Draco sighed.
Stefan huffed out a breath of hair.
Draco knew that his son hadn’t understood anything of what he’d just said. While Scorpius knew who Harry Potter was, had even met Potter on several occasions, he wasn’t privy to the ins and outs of Potter’s fondness of ignoring what was sensible and diving headfirst into trouble instead. In Draco’s humble opinion, Scorpius adored Potter a little too much. But―and Draco thanked his lucky stars for that―he’d yet to discover the finer points of Potter’s past, especially the parts of it that concerned Potter’s blatant disregard for authority and his love of doing precisely the opposite of what he’d been told.
Draco’s hand slipped from his chest to his stomach, and he swallowed. His eyelids fluttered and falling closed, he wished he could wrap his fist around his cock and stroke it slowly, matching the rhythm of the toy. His fingers curled into a loose fist, and vaguely aware of the sound of a scraping chair, Draco heard familiar footsteps.
He placed his hand on the back of the empty chair across from Lily and tilted his head ever so slightly to the side.
I hope you enjoy this chapter.
Draco set the pot of coffee down on the table and ruffled Teddy’s hair affectionately.
Scorpius looked positively cross, and despite wanting to take his son seriously, Draco couldn’t help but chuckle.
“Would you like to join me in the playroom, my little prince?”
“I like it. What would the scene entail?”
suitable for suspension and in the chapter, Harry doesn't actually use any rope to tie it, but he makes Draco place his hands in that position.
“Bloody tease.”
“Look at me,” he whispered softly and waited patiently for Draco to open his eyes.
Draco hummed softly.
“Whatever have I done to you to deserve such a punishment?” he lamented. “Isn’t it enough that I’m on my deathbed already?”
The second blow landed almost immediately after the first, and this time Draco did more than just hiss. He yelped and squirmed, flexing his toes and fingers as he did. Harry hadn’t struck the exact same spot, but Draco could still feel the burn from the first blow and the second one only served to intensify and add to it.
Draco nodded.
Forcing Draco to edge himself with a cursed dildo and some charmed lube had been another one of those temptations; he kind he didn’t know how to resist or simply didn’t want to even try. Edging Draco had been the result of his own wicked deviousness, and he’d enjoyed absolutely every second of it. He loved it when Draco was thoroughly needy, desperate to come, and willing to do just about anything to get permission to climax.
Harry smirked.
A moment of silence past between them both and Harry wondered whether he’d managed to wrap Draco around his little finger or whether he’d have to try a little harder. He decided to put in a little bit more effort, just to be sure.
Following the bite, and after shifting back into his human form, Potter should have either succumbed to his injuries―
A wretched sob tore through Draco, and he stared up at him, open-mouthed, gulping for a breath of air, with a perspired, blotchy face and his hair in complete disarray. It was damp and stuck out in all four directions, and Harry smiled.
These days, Harry was, always, aware of what was going on around him. Even when it didn’t seem like it. He’d mastered the art of appearing to be miles away yet―at the same time―be mindful of his surroundings.
Harry positively delighted in the way Draco’s pupils dilated, and he swallowed hard. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he did so and with a thoroughly devilish glint in his eyes, Harry decided to take things a bit further.
“Me tripling your caseload?”
Harry found it quite irresistible and rather happily surrendered to it.
“Kinky.”
Vaguely aware of the fact that Harry was trailing kisses down the entire length of his spine, and therefore kneeling behind him, Draco curled his toes against the matt that prevented him from slipping on the wet marble floor tiles.
“Great. I’m looking forward to the wedding. Should be fun.”
Draco couldn’t help but somewhat admire Brenda’s professionalism, and he decided to ignore her earlier prying question. He erased it from his memory, smiled more sincerely and prepared to answer her question.
“I’ll work something out,” he said, opting for a somewhat Slytherinesque response.
When Harry paused again, Draco thanked him.
“Don’t.”
While rounding the sofa, his eyes locked with Harry’s and he paused for a second.
“You can count on me.”
At this moment in time, he was excited, and since he didn’t know what Harry had planned, he had no way of calming his enthusiasm.
Harry continued to caress every inch of milky white skin he could comfortably reach and felt Draco relax. In no rush to move things along, Harry checked the ropes, tracing his fingers along the knots and murmuring the incantation to a spell, he channelled the beat of the music, and let it flow through the rope, causing gentle vibrations to surge through his elaborate ties.
Draco was breathless and gulped down as much air as he possibly could.
“Liar. You did tell him.”
Only his.
“No, an actual wolf. You know, like a dog, only from about 40,000 years ago.”
Somehow, and Harry had an extraordinary talent for that, the harness fitted him so perfectly that he could barely feel it.
He captured Draco’s lips in yet another kiss.
Instead, he turned his head and arched an eyebrow at Hermione.
“And did you?” Harry asked.
“How are your knees, my love?”
was a euphemism for and while he usually thoroughly enjoyed it when Harry edged him, he didn’t like it one bit when Harry did it to discipline him.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the little elf.
He parted his lips a little further, licked them with the tip of his tongue, and stood perfectly still.
Harry added a tiny little more zest to his bite, and Draco’s already alluringly beautiful reaction turned into an open-mouthed whine that turned into a bit of a cry when Harry pulled his teeth off Draco’s neck without relaxing his jaws first. He soothed the abused and marked skin with his tongue and a generous amount of warm saliva, digging the tip of it into the rather prominent little dibs his teeth had left behind in the dark-red almost purple flesh.
Fastening his towel properly around his waist, Harry extended his hand to summon his glasses, which he’d placed on top of the cupboard next to the sink in the en-suite bathroom before his shower. He pushed the round black steel-framed spectacles onto his nose and blinked once or twice. His eyes adjusted and the hazy blur, with which he perceived the world whenever he wasn’t wearing his specs, disappeared. He crossed the room and leaning forward, Harry placed his right hand flat on the bed to support himself.
Draco chuckled softly under his breath in response to Caleb’s charmingly attentive introduction and reaching through the tiny gap between the heavy triple-layered burgundy velvet curtains, he stepped through it and out onto the stage.
Harry mouthed the words rather than actually saying them, and Draco’s smile grew broader.
“Did you plan this?” Draco asked quietly, looking directly at Harry.
Racking his fingers through his messy hair, Harry growled into the empty winter garden, and staring at a small and upcoming palm tree, he dropped his arms to his sides and sighed. This endless vortex of emotions was driving him around the bend, and he wished they would just disappear already. They seemed determined to bring him down and although he was trying his hardest not to let him, continuously having to fight them off was exhausting.
He reached for the rope, slowly moved behind Draco, and squeezed Draco’s forearm. His fingertips pressed into the Dark Mark, and he gave the arm a tiny tug, a gentle invitation for Draco to surrender to him.
“Just promise to remind me to send Molly a gift basket tomorrow. I know she’s pleased as punch that she got her way after all, but I’d better make it up to her before she holds a real grudge. That woman is a scary dragon.”
“Crude,” he said.
Scorpius tilted his head up and blinked.
The first time, he merely says it to try and mildly intimidate his faithful companion. The promise to put Walter into a Full-Body-Bind for the next hour or so leaves Walter decidedly unimpressed and not at all convinced that Harry has any ability to gain the upper hand.
Teddy put the parchment down and crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco’s blush intensified once more and Harry leant in to capture his lips in a soft kiss, which he gradually deepened until his tongue had found its way into Draco’s willing mouth. He let it dance around Draco’s tongue, delighting in teasing him and only pulled away after several long minutes of heated kissing and when they both struggled to fill their lungs with adequate amounts of oxygen.
When his mother chuckled in obvious amusement, he rather abruptly rose from his chair, stalked over to the large double-glazed French windows and turned his back on Harry and her.
“Say it, my little prince,” he said, his voice warm and encouraging.
The bait had worked.
A little over a year and a half ago, the mere idea of anyone knowing, or finding out, what kind of deviance Harry was capable of, had terrified Draco.
“Humour me, Draco, darling. I’m an old romantic at heart, and I want to see you happy and in love for the rest of your life, but if it’s too much too soon, I’ll keep quiet about it.”
Harry grabbed his chin and forced him to lift his head, and Draco relished in the possessive force of Harry’s rough touch.
Smiling, Harry squeezed Draco gently.
“Yes, Sir. I’m ready.”
“There’s a bottle of lube and a toy beside you. I want you to fuck yourself with it, and I want you to put on a proper show for me. But, a small word of warning, it’s not your average toy, and it’s not your average lube. Also, don’t even think about touching your cock. If you do, I’ll transfigure that crop back into a cane, and you’ll get the beating for a lifetime.”
, an animated musical that had just started on one of the kids’ channels. He shuffled on the sofa and moving closer to Draco, he curled up beside him, boldly claiming Draco’s thigh as his pillow, and using the large blanket to cover the rest of him.
Molly smiled and nodded.
Caleb chuckled.
Caleb laughed.
Harry thought about the ring he’d placed on Draco’s finger and revelled in the pure excitement that made his chest swell.
The frown on Harry’s face was priceless, and Draco chuckled softly.
Harry smiled.
If Draco wanted to experience a stricter version of himself, Harry more than willing to give his little prince a taste.
He blinked, swallowed, and felt his eyes fill with tears.
Harry grinned.
Draco groaned.
In response to the question, Draco dragged his bottom lip into his mouth and chewed on it; however, despite his hesitation and silence, the way he squirmed in his chair and the dreamy look in his eyes told Charlie everything he needed to know. He didn’t need to know any of the details of Draco’s and Harry’s play to work out that whatever Harry had cooked up inside his devious little brain, Draco had thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
It was empty.
Harry bit his shoulder and moved his finger inside of him, pulling it out and pushing it back inside. He teased and tormented Draco for several long minutes, then reached for the last ice cube and taunted Draco’s hole with it. He dragged the ice over and around Draco’s tight hole and eventually pushed it inside.
Shacklebolt was practical, down to earth, and possessed the kind of humour that made Harry laugh for hours on end. He was also understanding, tolerant and the type of person who couldn’t care less about Harry’s background, his involvement in the war or his fame. Granted, in public, Shacklebolt behaved differently, but Harry could tell the difference between the necessity for a glamour and the man that hid behind it.
Harry didn’t immediately answer Draco’s question.
Harry took a step back, and Draco felt the way Harry devoured him with hungry eyes. He felt exposed, open, and vulnerable, but instead of trying to hide, or turning away, he let Harry look.
Draco’s lack of protective barriers was precisely why Harry always succeeded in worming his way under Draco’s skin. There was nothing that blocked his way, and if Harry was absolutely honest, there never had been. Back at Hogwarts, Draco had always been on his mind. He’d always stood out, and Harry had always noticed him. They’d had that conversation over breakfast a couple of weeks ago, and after Harry had shared his thoughts, Draco had smiled at him over the rim of his coffee cup and nodded.
There was something about Draco Malfoy, a strange kind of instinctual desire that kept pulling him into his direction, kept him coming back for more, and Harry wasn’t inclined to think too much about that. It ignited certain thoughts and feelings in him, and those had the distinct ability to spiral right out of control and drag him deep into a rabbit hole, he had no idea how to climb out of. He didn’t ignore the sentiment per se, but he also didn’t chase after it. Mostly for his own sanity, but also out of his aspiration to try his best to keep the relationship between him and Draco professional. Yes, they were friends, but within the walls of the Ministry, they seldom made that obvious. Inside Harry’s office, with the door firmly closed, that was a different story. However, despite their familiarity, there was still a noticeable distance between them, one that, on Harry’s part, took conscious effort to maintain.
“And why is that?” Harry asked.
A deep frown creased his brow.
“We should definitely go for that walk, and you should tell me all about it.”
Harry grinned.
“Bring it on, Director Potter, I’ll give you sass like you’ve never seen before.”
Draco begged and whimpered, and Harry’s smile grew into a devious smirk.
“Put the kettle on for me, pet,” Caleb said, “I’ve had enough coffee for today, I fancy me some Earl Grey.”
“Harry.”
“Do it,” Draco whispered.
It made Harry forget all about his second attempt to apologise for having been an inattentive and absentminded boyfriend who’d ignored his duties as the Dominant partner in their relationship.
Harry considered Draco’s request for a few minutes.
Harry smirked.
He let his head fall forward, and Harry ran his thumbs along the length of the back of Draco’s neck. He pressed the tips of his thumbs to the base of Draco’s skull and massaged the tender muscles there carefully, applying just the right amount of pressure to enable him to untwist the tiny sore knots.
“Who doesn’t, mate? Even I like a bit of romance, in small doses. Now stop getting your prick in a twist, I’m just messing with you, Potter. As always, it’s just way too easy to rile you up. I’ll give you a bit of space and go say hi to a few people.”
Right now, the signs were all there. Even if one didn’t know Draco, one had to be entirely oblivious not to pick up the various signals Draco was emitting. Some consciously, but most unconsciously and purely because he was struggling to control his emotions.
“One lunatic at a time, Malfoy, I can’t handle two at once.”
’, which, just, so you know, is absolute tripe. I can think of a way or three to scare your pants off.”
“180cm by 200cm, wonderful. If you gentlemen would like to follow me down to the basement? We’ve got quite a few choices to select from.”
Eirwen is a Welsh name composed of the elements "Eira" (snow) and "Gwen" (fair, holy, white) hence "Snow White". I found the name fitting, given the description I gave of the woman.
Draco arched his back, and this time he pressed his erection against Harry’s chest. Harry’s heart swelled, and his chest expanded. He peppered Draco’s chest with kisses, covering every inch of it. Draco continued to roll his hips, clearly desperate for the friction and Harry found yet more places to kiss and thoroughly tease.
“No, Sir.”
“That sly little―”
Harry smirked.
“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about.”
Potter frowned.
Harry watched as Draco’s upper arms flexed and his muscles bulged, but instead of allowing that to distract him, he secured the rope, then reached for the rope that connected Draco’s futomomo to the bamboo above. He unlocked the rope, tugged on it, and forced Draco’s higher up into the air. Holding the rope steady, Harry unlocked the rope that secured Draco’s double-column tie. As he gradually loosened it up, Draco, aided by gravity, lowered his upper body until his shoulders were in line with his waist.
Harry’s habit of repeatedly circling his thumb over his pulse point always helped him to calm down and relax, especially when he was nervous or worried about something or other.
“You and Andrej got serious pretty fast,” he said.
Harry nodded against his cheek.
“How much do you want it, my little prince?”
Draco shook his head.
Draco shuddered.
“Just, please, Potter, don’t fuck this up, OK? Those traps, I know we beat them once, but that doesn’t mean we’ll be just as lucky a second time around. We’ll need to remain focused on the task at hand, so whatever is distracting you, just please leave it until after we’ve finished presenting, OK?”
“We’re looking for a new mattress for our bed. Unfortunately, it’s been delivered without one, and the company has been rather unwilling to supply us with the missing piece.”
“You’re good for him, you know, Draco.”
Today’s exceptionally well-flavoured and peppery steak was accompanied by a small bowl of grilled okra with a spicy chipotle dipping sauce, and a large plate of crispy salt and vinegar potatoes. Harry couldn’t wait to indulge in the earthy and undeniable green flavour of his vegetables and the potatoes wildly addictive saltiness. It blended so perfectly with the vinegar’s acidity that Harry instantly postponed his plans to get dressed and walked over to the table instead. He pulled his preferred chair out, slumped onto the soft upholstery and immediately reached for his steak knife and a fork.
Caleb snorted.
After several minutes of truly mind-twisting, heart-stopping, toe-curling teasing, Harry stopped, allowed Draco to regain a tiny portion of his composure, then shuffled and summoned a simple dark-grey broad silk band. He slipped it over Draco’s eyes and tied it at the back, then kissed Draco’s cheek.
Harry’s question cut Roísín off, but she didn’t seem to mind.
Harry raised one eyebrow at Draco in a silent question, and Draco nodded.
Harry remained silent, and Draco didn’t push the matter.
He offered the chocolate to Draco, who willingly parted his lips and accepted the offered treat. He loved it when Harry towered over him like this and fed him. The gesture in itself was sweet and loving, but the domination behind it was intense and powerful, and Draco thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
“Stop corrupting him, brother mine.”
An electric jolt of excitement zapped down the length of his spine, and when it reached his groin, Draco thought a streak of lightning had struck him right in the centre of his crotch. Something red-hot and fiercely intense unfurled inside of him and spread out through the rest of his body, setting it on fire too.
I think I started on the finishing touch for this chapter around eight-thirty am this morning. It's now just gone three pm in the afternoon, and I can't wait to hit post. I'm really excited for you to read this.
The look on Harry’s face screamed,
They tingled pleasantly at the memory of yesterday’s passionate snog. As he delved deeper into his mind, Draco felt himself blush but still allowed himself a moment to relive the sensation of Harry pulling away from the kiss, cupping his face with his strong hands and staring deep into his eyes.
“Always. Remember, a firm tug is all it takes for those ropes to disappear, don’t force yourself to wear them for any longer than you’re comfortable.”
His cock twitched excitedly, and he wanted Harry inside of him more than anything else. There was literally absolutely nothing he wanted more. He wanted Harry to fill him, with his tongue, his fingers, his cock, a toy, anything. If Harry wanted to claim his hole and fuck him raw, he was more than okay with that.
Number eight followed almost immediately after and a fresh wave of tears rolled down Draco’s cheeks.
Draco babbled a bunch of reassurance nonsense, ran his fingers through his hair and Harry cried until he no longer had the strength to do so. He slowly ran out of tears and blinking; he tightened his hold on Draco and enveloped him in a bone-crushing hug.
He shuddered a little.
Harry gave voice to his astonishment, and although he’d merely whispered the words, Draco had heard them loud and clear.
This time, it was Draco’s turn to laugh. He leant in and placed another kiss on his mother’s cheek, then shooed her away. She gave him a pointed look, but turned and crossed the room. At the door of the library, with her hand already on the handle, she turned and looked at him.
“Neat, please.”
James, Harry’s eldest, had always had his own room but in the last two years, he’d often taken the time to hang out with his younger sister, spending as much time as he possibly could with her. He’d even gone as far as sleeping on the floor in her room a few nights a week to keep her company.
“I know,” he mumbled. “I thought we could do it as a family project of sorts. The three of us, you know. What do you think?”
, Draco told himself, and letting his eyes settle, he focused on the person sat across from him, behind the desk.
He summoned a towel, dried himself and his hair but didn’t bother to comb through it. It made no difference anyway; his hair had a mind of its own, and he’d come to terms with that a long time ago. He did stop in front of the fogged-up bathroom mirror though, and after clearing it and his glasses up, Harry ran his fingers through his messy hair and briefly contemplated whether he could be bothered to shave or not.
“I’ll just go sleep in the guestroom,” he mumbled.
“Well, Caleb came up with this exciting new idea of organising a series of speaking events at the club. He wants to do it in one of the larger function rooms, and for now, he wants to do a gathering every month and if it gains traction, perhaps more. There won’t be any scenes or nudity. It’ll be an evening of story-telling and education. Basically, he plans to have people come up on stage and share their experiences with the audience.
Harry’s rejection had stung.
“No, Sir, please, please.”
His entire being was thrumming with nervous energy, and the pacing helped him to focus. Despite his anticipation and mild trepidation, Draco’s walk wasn’t erratic. He moved at a steady and consistent speed and each time he turned; he felt his prosecutor’s robes billow around his ankles.
He didn’t bother with socks, and heading back into the bedroom, he walked up to the bed, sat down beside Draco, and ran his fingers gently through Draco’s hair. He caressed his cheek, then leant down to press a lingering kiss to Draco’s temple.
“Is there any chance at all you might be open to taking this relationship beyond the rock-solid partnership we already have?”
Since that day, a thick ball of want and desire had taken up permanent residence in the centre of his chest, and right now, Draco could feel it thrum to life. Deep down inside he knew that Harry would never drop him in the deep end, would never fully suspend him without giving him more time to get accustomed to the sensations―he wasn’t the irresponsible kind―but a small part of Draco craved the thrill of it. The idea of being utterly vulnerable, open, and entirely at Harry’s mercy, thoroughly excited him.
Scorpius reluctantly stopped pouting.
Harry rolled his eyes and nudged Draco’s upper arm.
Draco keened.
He grabbed his wrist and dragged Harry from the kitchen and up the stairs into their bedroom.
“How odd, anyone could think you didn’t want me to have treacle tart tonight, my love.”
Harry chuckled.
Scorpius grumbled something incomprehensible, then pulled back and reached for the paper. He pointed at Harry and titled his head to the side.
He also had that look in his eyes.
On Monday morning, Harry had slept past his alarm, which never happened before. He’d also complained about muscle aches and a dull headache, and instead of making coffee and breakfast for them both, Draco had informed his legal assistant that he’d be in late and then proceeded to turn the kitchen into a potions’ lab. He brewed a fresh batch of Pepper-Up in the hope that it might stop Harry from getting sick.
“You know my answer, Draco,” he murmured.
“Fuck, Draco, you’re burning up.”
every single parchment that currently cluttered up his desk. He checked his wristwatch for the time and decided that he absolutely had enough of pouring over report after report.
“I’d be my honour, Sir.”
Everything Draco had just said to him, he knew, but that didn’t change the fact that he loved hearing Draco tell him all this. Draco often about his feelings and what his submission meant to him in his journal, but listening to Draco tell him all these things set every inch of him on fire. That wild thing inside of him, the one had melted into a gooey puddle a few minutes ago, slowly reformed, and a familiar sort of possessiveness gripped Harry’s heart.
Also, he was far too distracted by the fact that Draco’s skin was warm to the touch and oh so soft; soft and velvety smooth. Harry slowly dragged his finger up, over one of the knuckles, trailed over the back of Draco’s hand and let about half of his finger slip under the hem of the sleeve of Draco’s grey cashmere jumper as well as the loose silver leather band of the expensive Muggle wristwatch, Draco insisted on wearing. Lingering there, Harry lifted his gaze, and as he locked eyes with Draco, he allowed a crooked grin to tug at the corners of his mouth.
It didn’t often happen that Draco got
As the cubs patted over to their mother, Harry watched in awe and forgetting himself completely, he felt his body move. His insides rearranged themselves as he gradually shifted back into his human form. Harry cursed the fact that the werewolf in him affected his emotional responses so profoundly that it controlled his shifts into and out of his animagus form, and somewhat worried, he glanced at Accalia. Since she’d seen him in his human form before, she remained entirely unfazed by his sudden change, and Harry relaxed.
“Do you want to kneel for me, my little prince?” he teased.
Harry’s reaction to his words hadn’t exactly left him unaffected, but he was Slytherin enough not to give himself away and therefore keep the upper hand.
He had no intention of ever sharing it with anyone, not even Harry. This was a private conversation, and he intended for it to stay that way. Draco valued trust, and opening up like this meant that he had a great deal of confidence in him. Charlie did not want to jeopardise that. It wasn’t in his nature to spill other people’s secrets. That was also the reason why Harry had made him his Secret Keeper. It had taken nearly two years for Bill, who’s curse-breaking skills were a force to be reckoned with, to find a way to break the old Fidelius Charm that protected Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
“OK, good.”
“You’ve got this, sassy one,” he murmured.
A small part of Harry continued to urge him to take control, but he didn’t act on it; his desire to do so wasn’t quite strong enough just yet.
It took Draco several attempts to open his eyes completely.
Harry didn’t even hesitate. He resolutely straightened himself up, squared his shoulders, and stepping into the room, he grabbed the remote control from the coffee table in front of the sofa and pointing it at the television, he switched it off, then carelessly tossed the remote onto the couch.
“Sir.”
Instead, he pressed his thumb against Draco’s pulse point. It took a minute or so before the familiar and calming touch took full effect, but eventually, Draco lifted his head again and looked at him with a faint smile ghosting around the edges of his mouth.
Love,
Then he blushed.
“Are you enjoying your sweet treats, my love?”
“Cut it out, Potter, you don’t scare me, never have and never will,” he said.
Harry smiled fondly.
The feeling got so fierce that Harry had to take a deep breath. He held it in for several seconds, then exhaled with a soft smile.
Harry kept a firm hold on him and leaning back, he watched, bemused, as Draco tried with all his might, to free himself.
“Potter. Give. Me. That. Photograph. You. Absolute. Fucking Wanker.”
Draco parted his lips but didn’t speak.
He’d wanted to bend Draco over his desk, drag his expensive tailormade trousers down and spank his arse until those perfect milky globes glowed red and burned with the lingering sting of his smacks.
Harry’s first reaction was to cough, then he took a deep breath and a rather large sip from his wine.
Draco exhaled softy and relaxed.
Tonight’s Ministry function was a fundraiser disguised as a ball, and it was a maddeningly dull event. Draco’s attendance wasn’t strictly required, but since he didn’t like the idea of Harry suffering alone, he’d offered his company and Harry had gladly accepted it.
“Told me you’d be coming by but wouldn’t tell me why. Everything alright between you and Harry? No plans to kill each other yet?”
“You’re doing this on purpose, Malfoy.”
, Harry thought fondly and crossing the room, he sat down on the large brown leather sofa. He made sure that his lower leg pressed up against Draco’s upper arm, and watched Draco curl his socked feet into the crocheted rug’s many tassels. Draco aimlessly toyed with the napkin, he had yet to fold into an actual origami swan.
Most days, the
“My perfect little prince.”
These days, though, she rather enjoyed all of Ron’s affections and even reciprocated with small acts of love of her own.
Draco rolled his eyes.
The first time he’d likened Scorp, Al, James and Lily to different types of coffee, Harry hadn’t been able to stop laughing. He’d laughed so hard that he’d doubled over at the breakfast table, holding on to his sides as he’d laughed and snorted and laughed some more. Eventually, he’d slid off his chair and ended up on the floor, though instead of feeling embarrassed about that, he’d simply remained there and continued laughing.
. You nearly got it right once there, see that you don’t forget or I’ll make you remember. I’m rather fond of my title, and if you want me to listen to your pathetic attempts of talking yourself out of trouble, you’d better make sure not to forget.”
“Harry―”
When it came to those things, nobody dared to mess with her, not even her husband. With everything else, all Molly wanted was for her children to listen. She was a smart woman and an excellent argument often managed to change her mind, but stubborn behaviour and sulky expressions hardly ever got you her attention. Although, it did often result in a whack around the head with a dishtowel.
Harry felt Draco tense, but before his little prince had the chance to react, Harry swiftly moved his arm and placed his hand on top of Draco’s thigh, squeezing it firmly.
“Apologies. Thank you, Director Potter, Sir, for your detailed recount―”
“Try again, my little prince. Do you like it when I touch you like that? When I drag my nails down your spine and grab your arse to make you mine…”
Crossing his arms over his chest in complete annoyance, Harry shook his head.
Charlie rolls his cobalt blue eyes at him, and Harry feels like he’s being mocked for choosing to remain single after a string of failed relationships. A small part of him tries to tell him that he’s still young and that he should actively try to find a partner, but he shuts that thought down before it has the chance to grow roots.
“Aye, we did, young man. Gustav took it very seriously too. It’s been rather lonely without him these past three years. I used to make these toys for all the children in my family, but he insisted that I turn it into a business. A jolly good idea it was too, if I may say so. Of course, at the time, I thought he was mad as a hatter, but the world’s been kind to me and my craft.”
“Hush, my love. Just do as you’re told.”
“Yes, you know that. And they know that too. But the bad decisions of my past sell papers, just like me putting bad guys into Azkaban sells papers. When it suits them, I’m the reformed death eater, when it doesn’t, I’m the guy who turned Harry Potter gay.”
As he did so, he closed his eyes and let his hand slip into the right pocket of his leather jacket.
Draco smiled.
He eventually turned his head slightly, and as he focused on him, Harry smiled.
As for tonight, Draco was prepared to go all the way, or at least as far as Harry wanted him to go. If a quick shag or his best oral skills ensured that he’d be able to get his revenge on Harry for stealing his wand with a whip of all things, then he was most definitely ready to commit every part of himself to make sure the evening ended with a lesson, Harry would remember for quite some time.
In response, Harry combed his fingers through his hair, then kissed the top of his head.
“Yes, Sir.”
“Draco.”
“Fine, be a drama queen,” he said and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Draco opened the fridge and reaching inside, he retrieved another bottle of chenin blanc from the Loire Valley of France’s Anjou region. It was his favourite white wine to serve and enjoy with a classic British fish pie. While the chenin blanc wasn’t the most expensive or most exquisite wine one could serve with fish pie, it had a certain kind of tension which meant that it offered up a variety of exciting layers. Draco liked to compare the wine’s versatility to white mist rolling across a landscape, constantly changing the view.
They instantly came to life and flooded the entire room with a soft golden light.
Harry smiled.
Harry looked at him for a moment, then shrugged.
He had to walk about one hundred feet to cross the anti-apparition barrier, he’d cast around the cottage when he’d first bought the place. Once he was in the clear, he took a deep breath, concentrated on his destination, and promptly disappeared into thin air.
“Beg.”
“Fuck you, Potter.”
“How are things?”
He mouthed a silent ‘
When he dragged his fingers an inch closer to Draco’s nipples, Draco gasped, and his eyes widened.
“You belong with him, he belongs with you, you’re his sweetheart, you belong with him, he belongs with you, he’s your sweetheart…”
Harry laughed.
“Tom, Tom, Tom, that watch was a gift from a dear, dear friend. I don’t take kindly to you destroying it.”
Narcissa clicked her tongue, tsking at the elf.
“Yes, Teddy?”
“My dragon.”
“I hate to break it to you, my love, but when we bicker, we absolutely bicker like an old married couple. Your mother isn’t the first person I’ve heard that phrase from. Charlie and Caleb have both said it on several occasions. Ron said it, and every time I mention your name in Gin’s presence; she calls you my husband.”
“You do realise that I can tell that you’re fucking me with your eyes.”
“My great-great-great-grandmother, Ysabeau Robine Malfoy, on my father side loved roses. She suffered from depression, although back then they didn’t have a proper name for it, let alone an idea of how to treat it. When she resided at Malfoy Manor, her condition was called melancholia. She was perpetually sad, hardly-ever smiled, and would sometimes vanish for days at a time, intentionally getting lost on the grounds when her lady’s maid accompanied her out into the gardens for a relaxing afternoon stroll.
was even more exquisite.
Love,
Harry chuckled.
“That’s quite enough now, Potter,” he snarled.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco huffed out a breath of air.
They settled on a lazy rhythm and perfect mixture of thrusts and slow and deliberate hip-rolling. Draco moaned into their kiss and very slowly breaking away from the deep and possessive kiss, Harry trailed wet kisses along Draco’s jawline and peppered his neck with tiny nips, bites, licks, and kisses. He gnawed at Draco’s earlobe, exhaled hotly and revelled in the full-body shiver that surged through Draco.
Draco chuckled.
Draco swallowed hard.
Harry briefly cupped his cheek, traced the line of his cheekbone and then dropped his hand.
“I’m glad I’ve got my uses, my love.”
Draco closed a shaky hand around the glass, slowly brought it up to his lips and took a few sips, then rested the glass in his lap.
Harry’s words washed over him just as his third orgasm tore through him and gasping for air, Draco squeezed his eyes shut and let the tears fall.
“No, please,” Draco begged.
“Aren’t you a delight tonight?” he mumbled under his breath.
Draco noticed the way Harry paused for a moment, giving Roísín the opportunity for his words to sink in and for her to process them so that she might respond accordingly.
“What a lovely nickname, I wholeheartedly approve.”
His reaction instantly reminded him of Draco and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. What he’d just done was something Draco would most definitely do and the thought of how interwoven their lives had become over the last two years filled Harry with a strange sort of glee. It didn’t exactly make his heart skip a beat, and his stomach didn’t fill with butterflies either. Instead, what he felt was more of a serene calmness, a sort of physical ease that most definitely contributed to his wellbeing. Despite the exasperation that filled him at the thought of the complete and utter nonsense he was dealing with today, thinking of Draco and how some of his little prince’s habits had rubbed off on him made him feel content and happy.
Draco whispered the words into the small space between them, and Harry drew him in for a brief kiss. He lingered a moment, then pulled back.
Narcissa’s expression instantly softened, and her warm smile surprised him.
“Hush, my little prince, I know you don’t want people to watch, I won’t make you.”
Draco nodded.
“Precious, I love watching you come, my little prince. Let’s do it again, yes?”
“You dare, my love.”
Teddy abruptly fell silent. He turned his head to look at the TV and a few minutes of silence past between them, then he looked back up at Draco.
“One day,” Draco affirmed, then closed his eyes and buried his face deep in the crook of Harry’s neck.
“Harry’s Auror robes may have been involved,” Draco continued.
Harry patted the back of her hand in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture, then let go and took his robes from Libby, thanking her for her patience. She shuffled her feet, making her embarrassment quite apparent, then bowed deeply.
―children.
“Thank you, my little prince. Thank you for your precious gift.”
Potter said nothing, didn’t even react to his blatant bait, and Draco briefly wondered whether, on top of having lost his marbles, he was now also losing his touch. He’d always managed to get a rise out of Potter and the fact that he hadn’t managed to achieve that goal just now thoroughly irked him.
“I’ll never say no to that, Master, you know me.”
Caleb raised a curious eyebrow at him, then reached for his pint.
“That’s what strengthening charms are for. I’m sure you heard of them?”
Harry Potter, Wizarding Britain’s Saviour and the Ministry’s pride and joy, being a skilful and accomplished Animagus was enough of a sensation for the papers. The fact that Harry Potter was also a werewolf, well, those were news that had the potential to rock not just Britain but the entire world and not just for a couple of months but quite possibly indefinitely. Draco was relatively convinced that such a bombshell would result in Potter’s immediate dismissal from his position as Head Auror. Things had changed a lot in the last decade, but Draco didn’t think that Britain was ready to accept the fact that the leader of the Auror force was a werewolf. Would they ever be quite this open?
Harry smiled.
Finally, rustic wood beams on the ceiling tied in with the now natural feel of the room and a staggered glass six-light chandelier brought a bit of sleekness and shine to the place. The plain brown dresser was the last to go. Draco replaced it with a black twelve-drawer double dresser the width of the bed, then took a few moments to admire his handiwork only to eventually nod in approval.
Complete and unadulterated trust.
“I’m afraid Draco doesn’t share recipes; he guards them like precious gems. I’m not even allowed to look over his shoulder.”
The intensity of their earlier scene had left him feeling drained. Post-orgasm, he’d been floating on cloud number nine, and still felt floaty now, but it had also exhausted him and the idea of having to make even the simplest of decisions terrified him.
It was something for Draco to concentrate on when his life turned itself upside down, and he still remembered the first time Harry had done it. He’d been in his office, close to having an epic meltdown, fervently trying to come up with a way to fix his former legal assistant’s monumental cock-up in a desperate attempt to ensure the prosecution didn’t lose their case.
The box was larger than the box his engagement ring had been in and unable to resist the twitch in his palm, which extended out through his fingers, Draco flexed them, then clenched them into a tight fist. He dug his nails into his skin and hissed at the searing pain that shot up his arm. Uncurling his fist somewhat, he stared at the box and gulped. The case was decidedly larger than a ring box but not big enough for a collar.
One more tender kiss, then Harry slowly dragged Draco’s trousers off his hips and smiled when he noticed that Draco hadn’t bothered with underwear.
“Only if it’s not some super-sweet cocktail concoction.”
Before Malcolm could answer his question, Kona returned and placed a thoroughly soiled stick at Draco’s feet. He eyed it with some disdain but crouched down anyway, and picked it up. As usual, Kona tried to wrestle it from him, but he was faster, and tossing it back into the nearby pile of leaves, he watched Kona leap after it with enormous enthusiasm and several loud barks.
He reached out, and pulling Draco’s grey wild leather collar from underneath the pillow closest to him, he let his finger slip through the O-ring at the front and dangled it in front of Draco.
“Hm, I think I’d very much enjoy that, my little prince.”
She’d drawn her wand and was levitating a large tray with a teapot, a coffeepot, and a set of four matching mugs and saucers, as well as all the cutlery for the desserts.
, he reminds himself.
Draco hummed, mumbled some sort of gibberish, and with a smile, Harry drew his wand, swished it, and conjured his Patronus. A swirl of silvery mist erupted from the tip of his wand, and a moment later, an impressive corporal stag appeared beside the bed and pawed the ground with his right forehoof, then tilted his head to the side in a silent question.
“Bullshit, Malfoy.”
“You can’t fault me for asking,” he said.
Harry nodded.
Andromeda rose to her feet at once but waited for him to properly step into the room before she engulfed him in a hug. Harry inhaled her familiar scent and lingered in her embrace for a while, then pulled back.
“I know. Listen, can we relocate to the kitchen and chat over a cuppa tea?”
“I gave you my word.”
“Come with me then, sweet one.”
“Please, let me,” Draco murmured into his chest.
His mother’s cool tone sent a shiver down Draco’s spine, and he silently watched her add another piece of brown sugar to her favourite tea. She stirred it carefully and until the sugar had dissolved completely, then elegantly placed the small teaspoon beside the glass saucer. She lifted the tea glass off the table, brought it up to her lips, then paused and glanced at him over the rim of the crystal cup.
For a moment, it appeared like Draco might roll his eyes at him, but in the end, he did nothing of the sort. Instead, he inhaled slowly, then exhaled.
“Grow a pair,” Charlie says firmly.
“Nope, didn’t even go in. Coordinated from the outside with my lieutenants. A perk of being a battalion chief.”
The boy nodded.
“Potter, you look utterly ridiculous trying to pull off this poppycock act of moral excellence. What time is it anyway?”
Post-Ginny, there had, of course, been others. Muggles mostly, but no relationship had ever made it past the six-month mark. The realisation that, when it came to his partners, gender didn’t matter much, had certainly somewhat contributed to Harry’s desire to remain unattached, but it hadn’t been the driving factor. That had been something else, or rather
Harry smiled.
“My tummy hurts,” he mumbled.
“I keep you safe, Mummy.”
Harry effortlessly slipped his wielding hand through the flogger’s wrist strap, adjusted his grip on the handle and relaxed.
Where subspace was involved, one needed to be especially cautious when using the Riving Spell to reverse the effects of a sudden blackout. While the charm couldn’t bring anyone back from the dead, it was instrumental in counteracting the impact of a Stunner or a simple temporary loss of consciousness.
“Then I’m afraid I’ll just have to pretend that I didn’t hear anything you said after ‘
“Fucking hell, Potter, it’s a bit early for those shenanigans,” Draco reprimanded him but rose to his feet, walked over to him and firmly patted him on the back.
Not about
“I’ll do it. A fortnight of wellness will do me a world of good. Especially if you’re planning to edge me repeatedly and we’ll be doing a roleplay scene.”
That’s not good.
"Pansy, I must request that you calm down."
So Harry pulled on his Quidditch Robes and headed out to the field with his Firebolt in hand.
His eyes were wild, and it was the expression of someone who was utterly helpless, terrified, worried, hopeless, and scared.
O M G, I'm so sorry, I've been gone for WAY too long. Like, three+ weeks? Okay, so here's what you guys should know. Two hours ago I had no intention of completing this fic, it was dead to me. And, somehow, it came back to life? Idk, guys.  So please enjoy this short chapter, knowing that this fic could have been COMPLETELY abandoned. I'll write a longer one later. Love y'all!
Hey guys! I spent three hours on this chapter, so please enjoy it for me! REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW!
best,
He was really confused now.
“Again, Blaise, that’s besides the point.” she spits in my direction, fiddling with her emerald ring.
“She’s right, mate.” I say quickly, because having Ron mad at me is a lot easier than ‘Mione being mad at me.
Shall we start there?”
That’s a bit too much for my brain, at the moment, and I just nodded, and then said, “Only if you’ll help me, ‘Mione.”
"Firewhiskey, please."

The time seems to hurtle forward, and suddenly, I'm at the Hogsmeade station, getting on a carriage to go to Hogwarts, walking into the castle...
He looks a bit shocked, and his eyes are wide.
"Okay, first of all, YOU EXPECTED ME TO DROP MY GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE OF YOU! Second of all, YOU EXPECT ME TO DROP SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS? Third of all, YOU EXPECTED ME TO DROP MY DAILY DOSE OF HUMOR, ALSO KNOWN AS WEASEL? Fourth of all, YOU EXPECTED ME TO DROP ONE OF THE SWEETEST GUYS I'VE EVER MET? And fifth of all-"
"What? What do you mean,
"Weren't you drunk?" he said, his voice cracking a bit.
I might actually make it out of this.
"Hey, Healer Weasley," Harry said, deciding to be polite and call her by her official name. She smirked at him, and said, "Please, Harry I ask that you refrain from that shit well in my office." Harry laughed, and she laughed right along with him. Good to know that his old Quidditch Captain was still herself. “Would you like some coffee, Harry?” she said, swivelling her chair so that it faced the opposite direction from her desk, and facing a small plastic folding table that had a coffee machine on it, along with some styrofoam cups and some cream. Harry muttered a, “Yes, please,” and Angelina poured some coffee into a styrofoam cup and asked, “Cream?” Harry shook his head, and Angelina handed it to him. He took a big gulp, downing all of the coffee in the small cup in one go.
I just want to end it at this point.
said a small voice in his head. He watched as she gave him a beautiful smile.
Christmas is over.
Blaise’s smirk became even wider (If that’s possible) when Draco noticed the chocolate. He picked them up, and then popped one in his mouth. Crabbe ran out of the room, laughing, and Draco said, “What’s his problem?” I just shrugged, trying to keep the smile off my face.

There was probably some fucking magic behind it. But he just kept trying. And trying. And trying.
happened...
She looked down at her combat boots, and muttered something.
“YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED, ‘MIONE!” Ron shouts, and I think the whole castle would of heard him if ‘Mione hadn’t done a silencing charm.
Literally.
He had landed as soon as he thought that Harry looked at him when he landed... and decidedly not looked at him again. He didn't want to see him that happy without him. It hurt.
(Bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc.)
I'M BACK FOR THE SECOND TIME TODAY! Well, folks, this chapter is shorter than I'd like, but I had SO much fun writing it. The more serious stuff'll come later. Anyway, I have a warning for this chapter.
“Harry, you need to heal him.” I hear Granger say, and I question her mental health. I know that Harry’s almost as bad at healing charms as I am, and I know that Granger is quite good at them. She should be a healer.
(We used to hang out together when Harry and I were together. I mean, technically we still are. Kinda.) I
"Yes." Draco muttered.
"What the fuck do you think you're doing here, trying to sit next to us, ferret?" Hermione hissed at him. Draco looked over, and was surprised at what he saw. Hermione was sitting right next to where he was standing, and her eyes were completely clear.
I gave him a dramatic sigh, and cast a levitation charm on my trunk. I started to storm out of the room, but not before grabbing Harry's hand to drag him alone with me. Oh, I am

I stormed down to the common room, tugging Blaise along behind me.
“And I will

that I shouldn't swear. But I don't fucking care.
“Dammit, Blaise! What the fuck are we going to do?!” Blaise shakes his head, and he looks as if he’s in shock.
When Draco was in the shower, he felt more relaxed. He let the hot water work it’s magic, and it always calmed him down. The familiar scents were comforting, and it felt nice to wash his hair. But, of course, Draco was busy remembering the time that Harry had washed his hair, and how nice it had felt. How he had slowly worked his fingers through his hair, rubbing his skull, and then rinsed it out gently. He had pulled Draco close, and the warm water hit his back as he stood there, rubbing circles over Draco’s shoulders. It had felt so nice…

"What's wrong, Pansy?" I asked quickly.
She smiled, and then took a huge bite of hashbrowns.
“Ang has an Omega-”
She gave me a box of one of my favorite Honeydukes sweets, Caramel Cobwebs. I smile, at least I still can be friends with Pansy when I go back. I know she's got my back. Same with Blaise.
Harry got lost in the thought of that…
Is there a point of living anymore?

Pansy was practically bouncing around the room. She stopped, gave me a serious look, and said, “Is that a problem?”
I've gotten a bit better since... that day. I've gotten to the point where I can eat a bit, sleep a bit. No more than two hours, though. Mostly a mix between nightmares, memories, (Mostly of being deflowered) and, well, just Harry. Mostly nightmares that involve Harry, though. Fuck.
I look through the packages, and I finally come up with a few.
“And you’re planning a wedding in a
In a fancy jumble it says,
I sighed, locking the door behind me.
The Slytherin Beaters seemed to have noticed him diving, and one of them sent a Bludger at him with astounding force. Thankfully, Jimmy happened to notice, and knocked it right out of the way, straight at a Slytherin Chaser. Harry sped forward, closer, closer,
“Mmmm… Are you sure that I have to go?” I ask Harry, my face an inch from his.
Hermione locked eyes with Draco. You couldn't have looked away from her intense gaze if you wanted to.
I've been thinking about how I'm going to break up with him. I don't want to come back and kiss him, make him think things are fine. But I don't want to break up with him the second I see him. So... I could... I could...
I feel like it should be canceled. I mean,
Oh fuck. We’re in for a wild ride today.
I shook my head, I was completely confused as to what just happened. "Pansy, no." I said quietly. "If this is what he wants... I'm not going to make him do anything he doesn't want to." I just looked down at my shoes, biting my lips. Ron muttered, "Fucking ferret..." and Blaise just said, "Asshole." Hermione was alternating between looking at me and Pansy. She let go of Pansy's hand and gave me a hug. Pansy looked a bit shocked, but she had a murderous look in her eyes. I don't know what happened to Pansy. She walked over and
do a good job. Everything is mostly back to how it was pre-war. Except for the fact that Second genders were back. Those had been gone for at least a century, and when the first teenager presented, they started sending out warnings for people who were twenty-six and under, because twenty-six is the latest someone has ever presented. Unspeakables are still trying to figure out why, but Hermione thinks that it has something to do with the major drop in population, and ancient magic kicked in and is trying to get us to start making more children. (If that’s the case, then it’s
That was a huge monument in our relationship. Were I trusted him enough to… well, I hadn’t placed much trust in him until then. I didn’t fall once that day.
“Crisis averted. I’d be honored, Pans. But, I have one question. Why aren’t you asking Draco? I know for a fact that he’s higher up on your list, no offense to myself.”
I open the package, and it's an amazing eagle feather quill. I think she must have seen me eyeing Harry's... I love it.
He sobbed out, his body shaking.
It was a lopsided sort of grin, the kind that made his eyes twinkle with unspoken mischief.
He moaned, and Harry repeated the action a second time and then a third.
Draco pretended to zip his lips.
“Somewhat off-topic, but please satisfy my curiosity. How is it that you manage to balance two full-time jobs, a baby, quality time
“No, we’ll crawl into my blanket fortress, and you’ll read me something.”
“I am― I just―”
Harry’s voice…
“Blast you and your wolf,” he mumbled without parting his lips.
“Apart from mum’s home-baked one, he’s utterly in love with the treacle tart from that place.”
Mesmerised, Harry took a step into the room and with his eyes still glued onto the tattoo, he watched the leaves move, giving away to the weight of the water droplets continuously falling from above. Harry’s attention shifted to the tree’s fruits, though he was sure that the complicated designs were anything but that. All of them were silver in colour, sparkled as bright as a unicorn’s hide, and against the backdrop of the tree, they stood out like beacons. Every one of the intricate shapes consisted of lines of varying degrees of thickness. There were no sharp corners or edges but twisted knots and curls that seemed to follow a strict set of rules. Harry’s curiosity overwhelmed him at once, and he desperately wanted to know what those marks meant. Somehow, his sixth sense told him that they were more than just decoration. They had a meaning, a purpose, and Harry wanted to know exactly what that was.
Draco had heard the rumours, of course, about the way Potter’s Muggle relations had treated him growing up, but the blasted Gryffindork had done a complete one-eighty when it came to his fashion sense. He was almost entirely unrecognisable. Potter’s clothes finally fitted him properly!
Draco elegantly stepped out of one of the designated Ministry fireplaces, and brushing off his prosecutor’s robes, he straightened them with the utmost care. They were neither crumpled, nor was there a speck of dust anywhere on them, but over the years, both actions had become a habit, and he performed them almost without noticing. If he did become aware of it, he hardly ever stopped himself.
He could not.
He pressed the tip of his finger firmly against the clasp, pressing it into Draco’s skin, and closing his eyes, Draco felt and listened rather than watched as Harry mumbled the incantation to activate the locking charm. It was an ancient spell, one Draco had never heard before, but some of the words were familiar. Many wizards and witches, mostly from the old pureblood families, chose to use them in marriage ceremonies. While the younger generation preferred more modern customs, bond rituals had never gone out of fashion and Draco didn’t expect them to do so any time soon. In magic, traditions were everything.
He dragged the tresses over Draco’s back one last time, then stopped adjusted his grip on the iron bar above him. He shifted ever so slightly, and then simply waited.
“And in which universe is reaching for a cup of coffee considered a strenuous exercise?” he asked.
Harry smiled.
Harry looked up from the paperwork; he’d spread out all over the kitchen table, and smiling at Draco, who stood in the kitchen doorway, he put his quill down. Draco’s hair was tousled, and his cheeks were flushed and rosy from the cold outside. Harry wordlessly reached out and motioned for him to come closer.
“Yes, my love?”
“Don’t tell on me, I’ll be in the dog house.”
Harry taunted his opponent, who threw a spell at him which Harry blocked with ease.
Potter whimpered softly and frowning, Draco to a few seconds to try and work out what that response might mean. He decided to try his luck and guess.
A quite mischievous smirk hugged the edges of his mouth, and his eyes sparkled with an endearing sort of deviousness. It was the kind of sly Slytherin wickedness, the type that had attracted him to Draco from the very beginning.
Draco yelped and groaned.
Just a tiny dose of
His voice sounded a bit raspy and full of sleep and walking over to the sofa, Draco set his coffee mug down on a coaster and placed his case file next to it. He sat down on the sofa and ruffled Teddy’s hair affectionately. Teddy’s lips curled upwards and into a soft, sleepy smile.
He nodded and with a smile, he wrapped the fingers of his right hand around the handle of his mug and brought it up to his lips to take a careful sip. He did this while carrying the other cup over to the kitchen table where he placed it on a coaster in front of Malfoy, who promptly reached out for it and wrapped both his hands around the mug, using it as a heat source.
Draco’s whispered plea sent a shudder through Harry, and he threw one leg over Draco’s thighs and wrapped both his arms around him.
Draco could tell that Scorpius didn’t really care and leaning back in his chair, he took another sip of coffee, savouring the rich and creamy taste of it.
Clenching his fist together, Draco stared into the empty sink and worried his bottom lip with his teeth. He closed his eyes, swallowed past the desire to sink to the ground and burst into tears, but couldn’t help wondering whether Harry’s and his relationship was falling apart.
