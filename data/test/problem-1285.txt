"have you seen the daily prophet today?" his mother asked, her eyebrows cocking up; her face (as usual) cold.
"yes! thank you!" she giggled.
he didn't want to see his mother over morning tea, he knows thats probably a terrible thing to think, but he couldn't help it. no one was good enough, at least no one that would come to the manor was.
draco could hear movie scoring playing in his head, the smell of pumpkin spice and apple taking him in.
narcissa was sitting at the table they usually had dinner parties, or drank tea. she was holding a tea cup head tightly in her boney hand. her hair pulled back in its normal style.
"what?" he curled his lip back at her, obviously not wanting to be outside of the manor.
"just leave." he said coldly, still not looking into pansy's hurt eyes.
"baby, it's not that ugly.." pansy looked the shirt up and down, slowly. "no, yeah, its wretched." pansy shoved the top back onto the rack of the muggle clothing shop.
draco felt his cheeks heat up with anger . who the fuck does potter think he is? he is literally the one who started all of this. he didn't take his hand, not the other way around. draco will never forget that. this isn't his fault, it couldn't be.
"im not sure if mistress would be happy to see you in this house, mr. malfoy. your father was a coward." kreature grimaced.
she ran the rest of the way up the stairs, her dress slightly riding up in the back. as soon as she reached the last step she threw her arms around zabini's neck, she hugged him like she hadn't seen him in months. draco wouldn't be surprised if everyone in this party heard her high pitched giggle.
draco couldn't believe that he was standing at the foot of grimmauld place for the second time in a month. why was draco listening to the note anyway? he could be in grave danger for all he knew. that's why he came alone.
he ripped the paper carefully, not knowing what could be in the parcel. but to his pleasant surprise, it was just a note.
draco felt his whole body go hot, his entire body was practically turning red. he felt every single set of eyes on him.. again. his hands felt even more clammy then they were before. and the cherry on the cake, oh the cherry on the cake was that harry potter was staring at him as well, waiting for him to get up and get in that closet.
draco couldn't think about that without it ripping at him. but one thing he did know was that in the end, he would have never gave harry over the dark lord. he was proud of himself for that.
a huge crack shook the ground, draco was sure something terrible had happened. alice slid back into the fountain as soon as possible, not wanting to break their law of secrecy between them. draco turned around as soon as alice was silent and completely removed from him.
pansy was begging draco malfoy to come to the hogwarts reunion party. she was trying excruciatingly hard to persuade him that "no one will remember anything!" and "no one will act like they did in year three, draco." yeah right!
"did i laugh? does that sound like a joke? i'm serious!" draco spat, he stood from his sitting position on the tattered bed  his fists were balled up ridiculously tight.
he nearly laughed at the fact that pansy obviously wanted to shag one of his closest friends tonight. but it wasn't like this was a first, draco couldn't even count the amount of times he had walked in on pansy and blaise back in the dorms at hogwarts. it was honestly vile, just go to the room of requirement like everyone else did.
"draco, what are you staring a-, oh shit." pansy nearly shouted. can she just ever be quiet?
"i'm not upset with you, i'm just nervous to go see my past. that's all."  draco mumbled, giving harry's hand a generous squeeze.
draco had realized that there was no one else
"yeah, i hate you too."
"there is not a single person i'd rather be with." harry smiled, he turned his head to kiss draco's hand.
they stood there, faces three inches apart for many seconds, they didn't almost were able to ignore what was happening in this split second. just savoring each others eyes, each others scent. their faces did still have their angry expressions on them, but their eyes didn't. but soon enough they realized that they were looking into each others eyes for far to long. draco shoved himself back.
"draco , i really didn't mean it like that." harry got up from the tattered bed as well. he took slow steps toward the crumbling figure of draco malfoy. not knowing what to do next, he just did what he was already doing.
"for um.." pansy thought hard to find something he could have possibly done to her, but draco
as he felt these butterflies inside him, he finally began to look his sexuality in the face. he knew that he liked potter, but he didn't know how to label himself, people always did that
harry intertwined his hands into draco's hair. the smell of expensive dior cologne touching his tongue. he didn't understand anything that was happening, but he didn't need to. all he knew is that draco malfoy was pressing his body against him for the second time in his life. the feeling of draco cupping his cheeks as he kissed him with so much sentiment, yet so timidly, it  made him feel like there was nothing more that he needed. he would've done anything for him to never stop feeling the way he was feeling now. the feeling of needing to fling himself onto him never fading away.
harry began to feel claustrophobic; he felt the walls closing in around him as he covered his eyes. his whole body began to feel hot, sweat building up on the small of his back. the memories began flooding into his mind. not thinking about malfoy for months didn't make him forget anything that happened .
"thanks? i guess.." draco squinted, the burn of the fire whiskey still lingering in his throat.
"yes, hopefully it goes well." pansy said, she was never the best at apparating, she was the first person to splinch themselves while learning.
this was the bad kind of silence though, awkward, uncomfortable. all draco wanted to do was walk away, he wanted to disapparate out of here, he wanted to be in his bed, alone. but his feet kept him glued, he tried to lift them but they wouldn't budge, he tried to speak but nothing came out; his lips wouldn't move. this was one of the most umcomfotable moments of his existence. they continued to stare into each others eyes, this felt like it would last forever.
he took a hard right, walking down the run down hallway leading to a random guest room. he guessed that was where he was supposed to be.
or so draco thought.
"draco! come down stairs please!" he heard his mother, shout.
"alice, i think i have feelings for harry potter." he said as calm as possible. it was the first time he had ever say it out loud, it felt like the ropes that were binding his body finally loosened a bit.
draco waited for her to respond, his face hanging over the water. but thankfully, all of the sudden, his face was soaked with water.
but of course  draco malfoy can never get what he wants, can he?
he felt so good about what alice said, she was right. he didn't owe anyone anything, he could figure himself out in time. he didn't have to label himself, not now, not ever. that felt so refreshing. he felt this giant weight lift off of his back.
"hey, you know you don't have to label yourself. this world has this norm that you have to confirm everything about yourself. but in reality, you don't have to do that. if you prefer to label yourself, than that's great, and if you don't, thats okay too."
"oh shut up you big baby, you haven't seen him in five years. it's just water under the bridge now." pansy said, she had obviously heard him anyways.
"i still fucking hate you, potter." draco spat, furious with the man standing before him.
"harry, are you feeling bad for malfoy? " ron's voice suddenly appeared in his ears.
"get off me!" draco complained, he rapidly pushed her away.
draco slipped his shoes onto his feet, thinking about how he couldn't believe that he was going to see gryffindors right now! he tried to best to make a vow to himself that he would only see them in the daily prophet from now on. pansy knew about this oath, that's why she had a smirk plastered across her face.
what does this mean for him? he felt like he had always known that he was attracted to men too, but actually facing his sexuality was terrifying. he always just pushed it aside and pretended he was straight. it felt like it was the only option, considering how awful his father was.
he hated thinking about anything that had to do with hogwarts. he absolutely hated the person he was then, even though he probably hasn't changed that much. he still likes to be petty and cold whenever he gets the chance. he seems to like it that way, he always has.
draco didn't know if he should be upset, or laugh. why was harry taking this so seriously? it's not like others haven't said it before.
"okay, good. we don't want people to think anything too foul." she smiled without her eyes . looking straight back down at her feet.
"hello, darling." narcissa mumbled, looking up at her son and his suspicious behavior. "why are you trying to sneak around the house, draco. you know that i know you have more secret ways of getting your way around."
draco didn't bother wrapping a towel around his lower half, he didn't mind the house elves seeing him, they have several times before.
"will we be apparating then?" draco asked her, he stood up from his sofa. as soon as he did he was relieved of the uncomfortable pain of  his silver serpent belt stabbing his stomach.
"but alice... im also kind of confused about all of this. i like potter, but i also have been attracted to women before. its all just this big confusing mess!" draco slammed his back into the gravel and dirt. he could feel little sharp pebbles scratching against him.
"yes, i mean me..." harry pointed his finger into his own chest. "and you.." he did the same to draco, his long finger digging into his sternum. "we need to go back." harry smiled tenderly at him.
he was seriously dreading this moment, everyone he ever knew at hogwarts was probably going to be up those dirty stairs. there probably wasn't one person he wouldn't recognize, but there also probably wasn't one person that wouldn't recognize him.
draco walked over to her and took her hand, feeling the warmth of her skin around his. draco tried his best to concentrate on "hogwarts reunion party" without getting too distracted about what he was about to walk into.
so..." harry blinked, they let the silence fall over them.
"because i don't want company today." he turned over onto his back aggressively; finally letting his lungs have the air they craved.
"as i heard. pansy came through here like a tornado, stomping her way out of the manor. that girl can be ridiculous sometimes." she smiled, but without her eyes. but she took draco's hint, as soon as she finished her sentence, she walked into the next room over.
"everything will be different now, i promise!" pansy parkinson laughed. yeah, what a load of crap.
he flopped onto his clean bed, moaning into his pillow. hes never wanted so badly to slip into dreamless sleep.
he felt harry squeeze his hand as he continued to giggle, tears appearing in his eyes from the laughter.
also a part of him just wanted to explore a bit, see if the gryffindor common room could somehow be entact. maybe even visit the slytherin common room for the second time in his life. he was also curious of what ravenclaw and hufflepuff looked like.
he heard harry say jumbled words, he was standing three feet away from him and he still couldn't hear. but, he decided to follow him. draco wasn't really looking where he was going, he was just following the dark blue blur that were harry's dark wash jeans. he was staring off into space, wondering, how could harry not be upset with him right now?
the most petty and cold person she had ever met, it wasn't that hard.
draco knew straight away why she would ask this. i mean, if it was the other way around, draco would be asking her the same thing. but sadly, pansy wasn't wrong. draco indeed got highly drunk last night; wanting so hopelessly to stop thinking about scarhead.
"you have got to be fucking kidding me." draco muttered under his breath, he didn't feel like making pansy scrutinize him.
"give me the evidence, baby." she said, using the same comforting voice she had been using with him for over a decade.
"out of all people, I know what it feels like to have people talk about your dead relatives in a negative way..." harry trailed off. the opacity of his words becoming more clear with every letter he spoke.
"now come on! its happening!" the boy laughed, dragging draco by his hand once again.
suddenly draco's eyes were glued to him too. the silence between them quite comfortable. so many thoughts were going through draco's brain; but none of them included the note. harry twiddled with his hands on his thighs, feeling the sweat build on them . they both knew they would never forget this moment. but they would be forgetting the last time they saw each other completely; like it never happened.
he wanted him out of his head so badly. at this point, he needed to take dreamless sleep potion. he didn't want to dream about anything that has been on his mind. as he stood there, his  thoughts were suddenly interrupted.
of course
thank merlin potter’s warm smile was making him feel better about this whole thing. he knows that the moment he gets back to hogwarts, all of the memories will start coming back to him.
"i have nothing to say to you draco malfoy!! you left me remember!! whatever you have going on in your life now, you can deal with yourself." she spat into his face. the water ignited with light as she talked.
malfoy felt his cheeks heat up. he twisted his fingers into the dusty quilt with all of his strength. he wanted to disapparate out of the situation, but something kept him. someone kept him. harry turned his head slowly to stare a draco. the vibrant green eyes staring through him. he saw an ear to ear smile form on harry's face, out of the corner of his eye of course.
as soon as draco saw harry's head turn toward him, he looked away. everything speed itself back up again, his hearing returning to the sharp way it usually was. his feeling of euphoria faded away, a new feeling, stress, replaced it. he needed to get out of the middle of the room.
he yanked his hand away from her, giving her a look of disgust. he ran his other hand through his hair, trying his best to fix the shape without looking in a mirror. he looked down at his body, he was wearing a simple outfit he wore all the time; black dress pants, a black collared dress shirt, black dress shoes, and his signature serpent belt. he actually was being brave today, he decided to spice it up woth silver some rings.
"there is no way in hell i'm going to this party." draco laughed, he was tired of her trying to convince him over, and over and , ove-
she dragged draco up the steps, his arm nearly limp with regret. the cement pulled at the bottom of his shoes as he tried to resist pansy's strength, but he finally gave in. as he was pushed through the door frame the scent of fire whiskey brushed against his face, it burnt his nostrils. he felt kind of dizzy actually, the smell was just that strong. pansy took hold of his arm, trying balancing him out.
"blaise will be there! please draco, do this for me! besides, you kind of owe me anyways." she looked down at him.
began to slip away. the cold ocean breeze turned into a dull musty smell. the sunset behind him began to fade into what looked like his bedroom. harry's figure grabbed for him, trying to hold on, but he began to turn into dust, into nothing.
harry smiled to himself, feeling the hatred flood into his veins. he just could't believe they were acting like this, even after not seeing each other for years, they still acted like children.
"unfortunately." harry admitted, he didn't want to meet eyes with a single person in the room.
"YOU KISSED HARRY POTTER?! FINALLY!" she cut him off, so much water erupted that it hit draco nearly 8 feet away. did she know this was in the making??
he slammed it, keeping his eyes facing the ceiling. the hairspray like mixture burned his esophagus, it felt amazing; the relief was deafening. he continued to take in this feeling he felt as someone inched behind him, the presents spiked his reflexes.
sometimes he wondered why he kept her around. but he figured he admired pansy, maybe he loved her. after all, she had always been there for him in his darkest of times. he considered her his friend, well most of the time he did.
they both felt it, draco knew they did. he felt that he knew what harry was thinking...
the music boomed from the windows. the muggles were still not able to see this particular party taking place.
he looked down at the beautiful man in front of him, he was naked, his body was small but still had muscle; his tan skin glistened in the sunlight coming through the open french doors. the sweet smell of ocean flowed through his nostrils as he took a deep breath in, draco felt the breeze hitting every inch of his body. he wanted to look at him forever, he felt like there was no concept of time when he was there. they stood there for awhile, until draco realized he was naked as well, he flinched.
"what happened next??" alice said, excited out of her mind.
"oh please, kreature. shut your mouth." draco spat
"don't be embarrassed, its nothing i haven't seen before." the man reached up and curled his loose platinum hair behind his small ear. the smooth skin of his warm hand feeling amazing against his skin.
"pansy!" ginny giggled, leaning slowly out of her chair.
harry felt like he was back in 4th year all over again, draco taking every single chance he had to make fun of him. he suddenly laughed out of anger, he really thought he had let all this go ages ago, maybe he didn't.
rather be with either.
"aren't you hot?" draco asked, eyeing potters flannel once more. the belt around harry's waist looked painfully tight.
the very sound of his voice somehow oiled his joints, he sprung into almost a fast walk. so many things were going through his mind right now, what would they talk about? would they even talk? would they even make a sound?
he rolled out of his bed slowly, the light coming through his curtains hurting his eyes due to the deep sleep he just ensued. he walked over to his bathroom, he took one look into the mirror; he was revolted. had pansy seen anything? any part of him? had he said anything in his sleep that would make her upset? or was he perhaps just overthinking? he finally convinced himself, over brushing his teeth, that he probably was.
draco stood slowly, making dead eye contact with potter. his eyes were reeling him in but he just couldn't move. again, his feet wouldn't let him. he felt like the tin man when his joints hadn't been oiled, he felt like he was in a glass box and everyone was examining him. he felt like he couldn't breathe.
draco pulled his lips away from harry's slowly, pressing his forehead to his. he took deep breaths, trying to control his lungs after screaming for air. he could feel harry breathing out of his nose rapidly, his warm air hitting was hitting draco's chin. harry giggled quietly, making his cheeks turn rosy.
"harry?" draco asked. snapping harry out of his trance by sliding his pale hand into his much smaller one.
draco pushed the two of them out of the way so he could finally finish the steep steps. when he emerged into the light, he felt all eyes move in his direction. its really not like he didn't expect that though, he was who he was. he threw his hands into his pockets as he scanned the room, every head pointing at him. he saw people he actually never wanted to see again, longbottom, loony lovegood, granger, the weasley's..
"dumb bird." he joked, he untied the ribbon bonding the letter to the owl.
the light was suddenly blocked by the figure standing in the door frame. it was blaise, his childhood dorm buddy, pansy's ex-lover. blaise reached his hand out to them.
"and what do i owe you for?" draco rolled his eyes.
"what are you giggling for?" draco smiled, pulling his forehead away from harry's.
"hi!" pansy smiled, she took his lonely hand.
she reached for his hand once again, draco let her slide her fingers in between his. he was very reluctant, but he knew he wouldn't go up the stairs if she didn't drag him there.
"i love you too. now, what are you going to do about this little crush? or more of a big crush but-"
thank god for ginny weasley in this instant, draco could nearly hug her. well.. maybe not. the weasley's are revolting to him, but he could at least listen to what she was about to say, he'll at least give her that. now that his feet could move, he turned his body toward her; potter did the same.
"we have to go back to hogwarts."
she was.
what would he say next? draco wasn't friends with any of his friends, so it wouldn't be a social gathering or anything of the sort.
water under the bridge? is she serious? harry potter is hands down the person he was the meanest to during his underwhelming adventures at hogwarts. sometimes he actually felt a little guilty for how he treated potter. well... he didn't exactly feel guilty, he would say he just felt
"lets go.." harry mumbled, he began to walk toward the ocean. draco was to delirious to get in the water.
malfoy grasped harry's cheeks, throwing his body at him.
she stood up, throwing her arms around draco's neck. she shoved her nose into his cold neck, the sequence of her dress scratched the pale skin of his face.
"... i-i actually really hoped you wouldn't show up tonight." harry whispered nervously, not wanting anyone to hear what he was saying. his whole body shook profusely.
draco thought that if he went to this party, it would be the last time pansy would be able to use this excuse. it was a small price to pay in his mind, one more big party instead of one hundred more small ones.
but the one thing he wanted more than anything is to go back in time. you know what he would do? he wouldn't seek his fathers approval so much, he knows now where that got him.
draco understood that she wanted him to leave now; he quickly strode back up the stairs, he wanted to get to his room as quickly as possible.
and it was true, draco already did know what she was going to say, he knew this entire time what she would say next. he just needed to hear it from her to really know.
he felt harry's fire whiskey scented breathe hit his face. he tried his best to back up more but he was already against the wall. they stood in absolute silence. draco was surprised that he couldn't hear the others speaking about what might he happening in here.
have to be?" draco said frantically, he grabbed harry's hand; moving closer to him again.
why would harry even say that? i mean if it was the truth, then it was that simple. but he seemed okay with draco out there. he actually came up to him himself! if harry potter tried to blame this on him he would lose his mind!
hey everyone! this is my first chapter! i hope you enjoyed! if you did, i would love some feedback in the comments! thank you <3
they both knew what the crack was; anyone could determine it. someone had apparated to malfoy manor.
"well isn't it pansy parkinson and draco malfoy." a familiar voice boomed.
"..hey!! i have a question!!" ginny weasley shouted over all the voices in the room; she stood on a brown faux leather chair.
even his body faded into nothing, he felt someone shaking him. he didn't want to open his eyes. he didn't want to see the reality of who it really was. he didn't want it to end. he wanted to be back on the beach with harry. he didn't want to come back to this undesired reality.
"what?" draco said, disgust and fear clouding his face. thank god harry couldn't see it.
"whats got your wand in a knot?" pansy scoffed. draco continued to look up at the ceiling, trying so hard not to meet her gaze.
harry looked draco in his gray eyes in that moment and wanted to disappear, they both did. they both were dreading these short seven minutes. but time wouldn't start until they were in there so, potter began turning the knob slowly, obviously not wanting this either.
"why? where do
harry was certain that taking draco back would bring back so many memories; he didn't know if they would make him happy, or sad. it was a mix of both for harry.
had been eavesdropping on their conversation.
draco didn't want any memories to be coming back, but they did. he pictured third year harry potter, walking toward him.
"harry, i don't know what you want me to tell you. i know that you are seeking reassurance that you were in the right. but how can i provide that when you know i would be lying?" she responded, this was exactly what she was thinking. that is why harry always relied on hermione, she told the real truth.
harry whipped around, a smirk plastered across his tired face. the intoxication taking over every inch of his body. was harry drunk when he sent to note too? or did he just have to get drunk to deal with what
he felt like he could forget everything that had happened to him; anything but this moment, anything but harry potter.
"you guy want to play seven minutes in heaven?!" she shrieked, the annoying side of her seeping through her voice.
he opened his eyes to see a stubble covered face inches away from his own. more feathers flew all around the persons head, the sun peaking out from behind their dark, soft, messy hair. their dimples flexing as their smile somehow grew bigger. his heart swelled as he saw their glowing face staring back at his, the sheet covering their shoulders.
"WHAT???" she erupted. "LIKE THE CHOSEN ONE HARRY POTTER? THE HARRY POTTER THAT YOU ARE ENEMIES WITH??" draco had learned to back up from the fountain when he dropped news like this. every single word that she just yelled made the water splash up.
was at the manor, draco had been asked to identify him.
draco has felt sweaty and flustered ever since he battled with his own mind in his king size bed; that was only two nights before. all he wanted to do was make everything around him disappear; never to have another feeling again. he was so stressed out about what happened, he just chose to try and not think about it.
all of this made harry nervous. was draco mad at him? or was he mad at the fact that he was going to be surprised? was that scary for him?
he took his first step out into his garden with pride, but he needed to get to the middle as soon as possible. he needed her to tell him what to do.
"hurry up, we don't have all night, malfoy." harry boomed toward draco.
draco swore to god if pansy picked him he was going to kill her! the last thing he wanted right now was another awkward experience with a random girl. he just wanted to go hide in a guest room until this night was peacefully over.
"harry, i'm sure what you said isn't as terrible as what malfoy said. he has always had something to say about all of us." hermione opened her book slowly, not wanting to look like her attention was somewhere other than the conversation they were having about the blond man they knew of so well, but actually knew so little about.
emerging from the shawdows was the most ragged looking house elf draco had seen in years. his skin looked like leather, aged, and dirty. his nose was flopped down across his face, nearly covering him entirely. but his eyes matched him perfectly, crystal blue, much like draco's own. the house elfs eyes were sad, his eyelids were drooping down. but draco recognized him somehow, he looked like none other than ruddy old kreature.
"no girl has ever loved me, doubt one ever will." malfoy swiped his hair out of his eye, his cheeks glowing red with embarrassment and sadness.
harry knew he had to talk at some point, so he might as well get it over with. he slowly turned his head to see draco staring back at him, waiting patiently, for the first time, to hear what harry had to say.
he sat on the disgusting bed, waiting for a sign of the person who wrote the not. but there was nothing for nearly an hour and a half. he stayed to the point where he was tired and needed to leave. so he stood up, but has he turned the door kno, a person on the other side did too. he dropped his hand from the knob,  he didn't know if he wanted to see the person on the other side. but of course the door was pulled open as soon as he let go.
"no .." draco trailed off, moving his hand out of harry's grasp. draco's cold action shot shivers down harry's spine.
"alice! please! i need your help! im so sorry i haven't said anything in so long. i just haven't had something important enough to tell you, until now." draco shrieked. he was desperate for her to awaken.
lucius malfoy, his story was honestly sad. he was executed due to his crimes a few years back. the day it happened draco felt a loss and a victory. he felt like he could be himself with no judgement; be whoever he wanted to be. but that still didn't excuse the fact that his father was just killed. it was a bittersweet pain, it really was. seeing his mother sad was the worst part.
"what are you smirking at?" he spat, he knew exactly what pansy was thinking. he always knew what she was thinking, she was the most predictable person ever.
he finally felt like he could
anything but the feeling of kissing him.
"maybe." draco mumbled, ashamed of himself even though pansy didn't
"draco?" pansy asked, laying her warm hand on draco's cold, but moist cheek.
"i pick, harry potter and..." thank merlin, draco thought " draco malfoy ! "
the sea breeze hit him hard in the face as he dragged him out the doors. he was looking at the white sand on the beach, it felt so good on his feet, it felt foreign.
"draco .. i didn't-"
"im not." draco pushed out.
he was sitting in his favorite leather chair; most of the furniture in his flat were dark colors. pansy on the other hand, it seemed like she hadn't sat down in ages.
he felt feathers hugging him as he laid. he snuggled into the clean comforter, the corners of his lips turning up as his consciousness seemed to seep back into his body.
"oh... nothing." she laughed, running a hand through her shiny black hair.
he moaned and turned his face into his pillow. at last, pansy stopped touching him with her sticky hands. he couldn't breathe, but he didn't care, he didn't want to breathe air that wasn't the near ocean. but he could still feel pansy's presence sitting beside him on the bed. he just wanted to be alone in his loneliness.
"they are indeed upstairs."  a raspy voice said from the corner. the voice was coming from inside the dark.
"it got out of hand." harry shook his head, remembering what him and malfoy had said the night before.
"hermione, i asked him if his father would 'hear about this now'." harry admitted. he felt terrible for saying that, even to malfoy.
"oh, sorry." harry mumbled, pulling his hand from draco's.
draco wiped the sweat off of his neck. his arm falling limp at his side in tiredness.
"i just feel bad. i know shouldn't have said it, i know what he's feeling now." harry wiped his forehead of his own sweat, his mind continued roaming.
"you're kidding right? no name?" draco hissed, he threw the letter into the corner of his room.
shit. who told the prophet about this? whoever is was, draco had a thing or two to say to the-
"what did?" hermione said as soon as she swallowed her gulp of tea.
a tan figure stood in the doorway, the smell of firewhiskey grazed draco's nostrils.
"potter?"
he walked out of his bathroom into his closet, he still enjoyed wearing his black suit every once in a while; he didn't understand why though, it had so many bad memories attached to it. he pulled the black blazer, black turtle, and black dress pants off of the hangerhe slipped them on as slowly as possible.
draco thrashed around in his bed. his sheets pulling at his slicked with sweat body. why couldn't his mind stop roaming? he hated when he did this to himself, he hated how he over-thought every single thing that happened in his life, it was his biggest weakness. he wished he could just leave himself alone.
harry felt shaky, he couldn't believe that someone as nice as ginny would even have the idea to do this. he stood up, walking over to very the closet on the other side of the room. harry felt his ears go numb as soon as he touched the cold door knob to his own extra closet. now all he needed was his chosen buddy, malfoy. but harry didn't have terrible feeling about the pale man anymore, he let everything go a very long time ago. at least he thought he did.
"you think i'm hot?" harry giggled, throwing himself onto the bed beside draco.
done with.
"what do you mean finally?? alice.." draco's cheeks began to heat up from the fact that alice might have known all along, she has known this whole time.
"you haven't called me for years draco!! years!! and now you think you can just come back?? its not fair!" alice screeched, she was so loud that the crows flew away. she splashed more water into draco's face.
"probably upstairs." he glanced over at the old, black steps that lead up to his inevitable immature doom.
draco's face cringed as he took in what kreature had just said. he could feel pansy's gaze on him, she squeezed his hand tighter; sometimes she just wished that draco would let her comfort him. but this was just the same as always, draco tugged his hand away.
he was remembering the night in the astronomy tower. the night he regretted more than anything. he was indeed the chosen one, but he still couldn't do it. the dark lord
all harry wanted to do was apologize, apologize for everything he said back in the closet. he didn't mean it, or least he didn't want to mean it. he could see the sadness still laced in draco's eyes, he looks the same he has always looked, aside form the tattoo on his thumb; harry didn't notice it until now. it was a colorless daisy, they used to have tons of them at hogwarts, there was an entire field full of them.
malfoy interlocked his fingers with harry's, causing him to now have a better grip on the boy who lived. he dragged him over the the full size bed, forcing him to sit. draco sat beside him, harry didn't try to break the grasp. he doubted that he had the strength to do so.
harry looked down at their still interlocked fingers, he rubbed his thumb with his own, the soft skin soothing his nerves. he looked back up at malfoy, once again seeing the gray eyes staring back at him.
Coming home from his Auror work, with a heavy heart, Harry knew what he had to do (not necessarily on his to-do list that he attached to the front of his fridge, but important nonetheless). He had recently found out that he was gay though over the course of time, Harry has wondered if he always knew he was gay but was just to afraid to admit it. Admit it to friends, to Ginny. But he knew that the time in his relationship with Ginny was up and that it needed to end. Walking through the fireplace of their shared apartment after a very long day at work, he startled Ginny as she was sitting on the sofa in front of it. She opened her mouth to say her greetings but Harry quickly rushed to the bedroom to get changed out of his Auror uniform and to ready himself for the onslaught ahead. Changing into his most comfy jeans and a red t-shirt, he slowly walked back to the open plan living area (Harry preferred open spaces so he knew and felt like he wasn’t confined to such a small space, like his childhood cupboard). Ginny was already standing and staring at him, the look on her face will always remain engraved into his brain. It made him feel guilty.
And there he was. Draco Malfoy in all his glory, a look of pure bliss on his face. His hair was a little longer at the front than when they were at school and it wasn’t slicked back. He had grown taller and had become more muscled from what Harry could see from sitting down at the bar. He was also dancing quite intimately with a man in front of him.
The music started to end and Malfoy removed his hand and mouth from Harry’s body, much to Harry’s dismay. Harry turned around to face Malfoy, who again grabbed his hand and led him back to the wall.
“Well, I’ve already completed quite a lot of the paperwork without you.” Seamus stared at Harry as he reached into his bottom drawer of his desk. He withdrew a large, grey bottle.
“Is that all you came here for?” Seamus shouted as Harry opened the door to the rest of the department.
“G’night.” Ron replied before returning to the open door of his bedroom before shutting it.
“It has taken you so long to get your head out of your arse to actually realise that you were! We all had a bet to see how long you’d deny it and then finally accept.”
Hermione shook her head, “I’m sorry about him? And what happened after that?”
Hermione’s eyes were wide open and she was leaning forward, elbows on her knees and her head resting in her hands, listening intently.
Harry wanted to stick to the walls of the apartment, away from everyone else. He wanted to get this over as quickly as possible.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated
“Like I said, I don’t want to see you around here again” and with that, Malfoy removed himself from Harry’s presence, took the other man’s outstretched hand and walked towards the exit.
Hello everyone,
“Come on in. I hope you brought some boxes. I have a few but..”
Making a final decision, Harry cautiously ventured inside.
Ron and Hermione turned towards each other and gave each other a look. Harry could quite make out what they were trying to communicate without words but Harry could tell it wasn’t in his favour.
“God, finally!” Seamus laughed.
Any mistakes throughout this fanfic are mine.
Malfoy slipped his arm into the crook of Harry’s elbow. “I’ll walk you there.”
Harry’s grip around his glass tightened as he watched Malfoy sway to and fro with the other men. It did seem to Harry very strange that Malfoy, any Malfoy could smile like that. The Malfoys that he knew kept their cool, collected masks on at all times, preventing even the tiniest slip of emotion. The Malfoy that he was watching had removed that mask. He was smiling widely, his eyes full of joy, the harsh lines of his face subsided with the smile only leaving a relaxed individual who was just having a good time.
He finally made it to the office. He opened the door to find Seamus swamped with paperwork that over the piles of it, you could only see the top of his head.
By his third drink, there was no glimpse of blond hair anywhere in the gay bar. Not getting a drink, not on the dance floor, nowhere. Perhaps Harry had missed his chance. Gloomily, he swallowed the rest of his drink. He was about to return his glass to Jack and then leave, when movement from the entrance caught his eye.
Seamus held up his hand to stop Harry from talking. “Stop. Now, what were you doing at a gay bar?”
Sorry for not updating sooner. There has been a lot of work and I just haven't had the time.
“Yes. I’m not entirely sure when. But, soon.”
“Even if you finish getting your things quickly Harry, we still have to wait for Hermione and Ginny to finish.” Harry continued diving into the cupboard.
“Will you be returning here, Ben?” Malfoy asked quietly, his tone somewhat hopeful.
Harry silently moaned as he moved his head even further back and he started to take control of the movement downstairs. It was a weird, wet, warm sensation and Harry seemed to not get enough of it. Malfoy smiled against Harry’s skin and moved further upwards, his lips attaching to the sensitive part behind Harry’s ear which he didn’t know existed. Malfoy’s hands stopped moving up and down Harry’s sides and went in search of bare skin. Harry’s t-shirt wasn’t tucked into his trousers anymore so Malfoy casually slipped his hand underneath. Without looking, his long fingers outlined each one of the muscles that lay there. From when Harry looked in the mirror at Ben’s image before he headed out, Ben had some muscle there, not as much as Harry but he had a flat stomach and defined muscles. Harry moaned a little louder this time, also because Malfoy started to add biting and licking into the mix of things he was doing to Harry’s neck.
Alcohol was the most obvious choice, even though it was a Tuesday and he had work at the Ministry the next day. Meetings with the other Aurors and paperwork, just thinking about it gave Harry the foundations for a headache. Yes, alcohol will have to do, he just hoped that there were some Hangover potions at Ron and Hermione’s apartment as Harry couldn’t and wouldn’t show his face back at his own place, not after leaving Ginny to cry the evening away as he was now. He would just crash on their sofa, as he has done numerous times before.
Harry groaned as he sat up, his hand immediately going to rub his eyes, the intense pain behind them. He reached out to where Ron was holding the bottle and grabbed it, swallowing the entire contents of the potion in one. The effect was instantaneous and the headache subsided.
“So?” Ron left the question lingering.
“Ginny floo called us that you two had broken up. And the reason.” Hermione whispered.
“All the ministry departments, especially the DMLE, have been curious as to why the Malfoy name has suddenly disappeared from the Wizarding World. We’ve all been waiting for something to pop up and give us clues as to where the hell they are. And now, I finally have that clue!”
Ron swallowed his mouthful.
“Sorry to tell you that. But really, how long do you think you can last with just the outfit you wore when you came to us?” That was Hermione talking, Harry thought to himself.
“Who was that guy Draco?”
Harry stopped to stare at both of them.
Thanks everyone
Taking a few deep breaths, he emptied the sink, grabbed a towel to wipe his face and left the bathroom to go to bed.
Seamus’ eyes seemed to grow, as if Harry had suddenly grown 3 heads.
“Whiskey please.” Harry imagined Ben to be polite when asking for something. He didn’t really know though, he’d never met the man.
Anyways, enjoy. Kudos and comments are always appreciated!
For a brief moment, a look of sadness fell over Malfoy’s face. But it was replaced quickly with a mask of contentment.
“No. I don’t. But with the amount of people that actually enjoy my company here, and the fact that I am extremely wealthy and powerful, it seems like I do. Everyone who works here knows me and likes me.” Malfoy nodded to someone across the bar and Harry started at his line of eyesight. Jack was pouring tequila shots for a rowdy group down the bar. When he saw Malfoy’s nod, he responded with a simple wave and smile before returning to work. Harry inwardly groaned.
There was a part of him that wanted to go and see which picture they were looking at. Whether it was that time he and Ginny went to Paris on holiday and Ginny brought with her a stereotypical French person costume and forced Harry to go out in it (those memories shall never be re-lived), or whether it was the permanent marker drawings that Seamus drew on his face while he was asleep. But the other part of him was screaming to just get this done and over with.
Harry slowed down to a more productive pace and helped Ron with folding and putting the clothes away in the boxes that Ron had provided. A comfortable silence fell upon the two. It was nice. Harry didn’t feel like talking anyway. There was nothing to talk about. Actually there was. There was something really interesting to talk about. But Harry didn’t think that Ron would want to get into a conversation about a certain blonde.
No, no, no, no, Harry’s mind was screaming at him. He wanted to let go of Malfoy’s hand but his limbs weren’t working. He held onto Malfoy tighter as they made their way to the middle of the floor. Some people moved out of the way, making space for Malfoy and his new partner. He does hold some power over these people, Harry thought.
“Where?” Ron replied, his tone suddenly turning angry.
“No, but because he is there so often and he is rich and powerful, he feels like he does. And all the staff and regulars know him, respect him. It’s really strange.”
They walked in comfortable silence, both occasionally looking at the other when they weren’t looking. Harry could finally get a good look at the man he wanted to find this evening. Malfoy’s hair was longer, a little bit curled at the ends, his face was still pointy but it didn’t make him look like a skeleton, more regal. His eyes were still as grey as ever, shining so brightly the sun had competition. Harry had to admit, Malfoy was very handsome, beautiful.
“A gay bar at that. Well, I must say congratulations. Welcome to the club.” Malfoy said sarcastically. Harry could tell that Malfoy was quite drunk, on what, he didn’t know, but he wanted some. He continued drinking.
“Tell us everything, Harry.” Hermione had recovered from her earlier choking and was now actually curious. Ron grumbled, muttered something under this breath about death eaters and left to clear the table of plates and glasses. Once Ron was out of earshot, Harry started talking.
Harry gulped nervously. Oh no, he thought, is Seamus going to be disgusted or…
“Shhhh.” Harry whispered out loud.
He looked very similar to when he was here the last time Harry was. A white button down with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, exposing his mark to the crowd and tight black leather trousers which emphasised his arse. Harry stared at him as he made his way to the bar, ordering some sort of complex drink to Jack and waited. He leaned forward on his pointy elbows, head resting in his right hand and a look of boredom on his face from where Harry was standing.
“Thanks.” Harry reached into his jacket pocket to get his wallet.
“A Malfoy? Nice? Never in a million years thought I would hear those two words together.” Ron joked while Hermione continued looking at Harry.
And Harry left. With the bottle safely stored in his coat pocket, he headed towards the lifts once more, his devious plan to spy on Malfoy already forming in his head.
“So you think he is up to something?” Ron asked, still with a tone of annoyance.
“Well at least he’s now got his way of getting Muggles to basically worship him at his feet!” Ron’s voice could be heard from the kitchen.
“You two, you’re not… um… disgusted?” Harry was already starting to tear up.
The night air was very cool and much needed. It cooled down Harry’s skin that was still on fire after Malfoy had kissed it and touched it. It was windy however so he still felt hot. Especially when Malfoy was hanging off his arm.
Finally, after what seemed like hours, Malfoy had arrived.
“The train station, just a few minutes up the road.” He had told Ron and Hermione that he would crash there again.
~~~~~
“Not like sixth year, Harry.” Hermione looked at Harry wearily.
“Jump forward a couple of minutes, Malfoy came up to me at the bar because he noticed me staring at him on the floor. He talked about how he never wanted to see me in that bar ever again and…”
“What!?” He rounded the desk so he was standing in front of Harry. “Where?”
Malfoy winked at the man, making him flush a bright shade of red before returning to Harry.
“She will be alright, Harry. Hermione said. “And so will you.”
“What’s your name?”
To his surprise however, Ginny slowly took his hand in hers and squeezed reassuringly. The tears started to overflow from behind his eyelids.
“You want me to start at the top of my list of why you should be?!”
Seamus rubbed his eyes and thought about it.
“Haha, very funny. Hermione? Ron? Can we please finish up?” Harry stared at the three of them sitting in front of the fireplace, having no idea that Harry was addressing them.
“Stevens and Watford wanted to give us their recent case on the smuggling of illegal potion ingredients in Knockturn because they can’t get anymore leads. I agree but seriously, I didn’t think there would be this much paperwork!” Seamus gestured to his entire desk.
“Surprised to see you here, Potter” the familiar drawl coming from behind. He sounded the exact same from when he last talked to him in the Room of Requirement.
Yes, how did Harry get such supportive friends?
“What? You…”
“So I am if you really are that blind!” Seamus joked but Harry could see that he was trying to rile it back in.
Harry didn’t know how to respond. He should have gotten another drink so he would have something to do. He looked at his glass many times before Malfoy got the hint. He waved at Jack, clicking his fingers at the same time.
Malfoy pressed his chest against Harry’s back and his arms slid around Harry’s body. There was a sudden moment of tension in Harry’s body. No one had ever done this before, not even Ginny, his one and only past lover. It felt nice. It didn’t feel like a death grip. It didn’t feel like someone was trying to strangle him or kidnap him. It felt like someone was looking after him, making sure that he felt alright. Comfortable even. Harry relaxed into Malfoy’s arms, putting a bit more of his weight onto Malfoy’s shoulder. As soon as he felt him relax, Malfoy pressed his entire body behind Harry and started swaying from side to side. His hands had now moved to his waist with one hand stroking his side. Harry moved with him, his body starting to actually dance instead of move like a robot. The music kept a steady beat and Harry and Malfoy swayed in time. Then, Malfoy did something that Harry didn’t quite expect. His hips started moving upwards, against Harry’s. Oh my god, Harry thought. Harry didn’t want to tense up, especially at this point, he didn’t want to break character nor stop Malfoy because it felt really good.
Harry removed the jacket from his body, exposing his arms to the chill to get a better look at the mark. It was on his left side of his neck where it meets the shoulder. It was bright purple, everyone could tell that it was a hickey. Harry carefully rubbed his fingers against it expecting it to hurt or at least feel sore. It did a bit but nothing he couldn’t manage. Harry was a little bit mesmerised by the mark. In some sort of perverse way it was like Malfoy marked him like an animal, like he just put a big sign on top of Harry’s head that said “mine”. Harry didn’t know how to feel about that.
“Thank you for this evening Draco.”
“But she also wasn’t disgusted, neither did she sound surprised.”
The door was still wide open and many people walking by looked at Harry with concern.
But was Malfoy really his enemy anymore? That was another thought for another day.
“At a Muggle gay bar. It was quite weird actually…”
It had rained earlier in the day and puddles littered the cobbled street. Harry, not really realising where he was going, abruptly stepped in one, covering his entire right foot in freezing water.
They all stayed like that for several minutes, trying to calm Harry down. Without leaving Harry’s side, Ron levitated the food being cooked onto plates and guided them to the coffee table in front of them. There was the clinking of glasses and the sound of splashing and 3 glasses of orange juice found their way to the table as well. Harry’s sobs subsided into just sniffles and rubbings of his nose. He looked at the platter of bacon, toast, eggs and sausages as well as the orange juice that Ron had put to the table and he suddenly realised how hungry he was. Thinking about it, the day before he didn’t have lunch nor dinner then he went to a bar and drank his little heart out.
“Don’t drink too quickly” and he went away, serving other people who had now entered the bar.
Words seemed to have been caught in Harry’s throat. Unable to respond verbally, he settled for a nod.
It was much colder in the bathroom than Harry expected but it was welcomed. The air cooled down his skin and briefly distracted him from the sharp, stabbing pain he felt in his chest.
Yeah right, a voice sarcastically spoke in the back of his head.
“Yeah. Ginny was in on it too.” Seamus laughed even more, doubling over.
“Where are you going?”
The music subsided again with the accompaniment of people clapping and cheering. Harry sensed that someone was walking towards him. He didn’t want to turn around and know exactly who but he had a hunch.
“No you haven’t. Even if you are gay, you could have gone to any bar to have a drink.” Malfoy leaned in closer but still far enough away so he wasn’t entering Harry's personal space. “What did you really come here for? To dance and have fun? To find someone?” Did Malfoy’s voice suddenly get huskier?
Harry turned towards the mirror and ran the water. Staring at himself in the mirror, he looked more dishevelled than he thought he was. His hair, now completely black, was messy (messier than usual) from all the dancing and the hands. His cheeks had a slight flush from the cold (or most likely from the kiss with Malfoy but Harry wasn’t going to dwell on that) and his neck was properly bruised.
“Harry!” Hermione practically screamed. It was the dead of night and usually Hermione would be very quiet and respect her neighbours' sleep, however that idea went completely out the window.
“What is all this?” Harry pointed at all the paperwork, turning over a few pages on top of Seamus’ pile.
Harry decided, somehow through his hurricane of emotions, that the first bar that actually sparked some interest in him, he would go and drink. It seemed like hours, just walking, just walking through Muggle London, not really knowing where he was going.
But then, remembering what had happened last night, he wasn’t alone.
“Woah, someone’s getting a bit touchy?” Malfoy’s voice was practically dripping with mockery. “How many of those have you had? You should probably stop.” He gestured to the whiskey in Harry’s hand.
Discreetly, he made his way to the door and started walking down the corridor to the stairs. The apartment building did have a lift and it would have been easier for Harry but he wanted some time to himself and didn’t need anyone else in the lift with him.
“Nothing.” He quickly replied before returning to his folding of the last few items of clothing. In the silence, Ron and Harry had finished collecting Harry’s clothes and had them neatly (or at least to the boy’s standards) in the boxes. After grabbing the boxes, they went to exit the bedroom and into the living room where the girls were packing up the kitchen and living area. By the time they made it into the living area, both Hermione and Ginny were giggling. This made both boys rather concerned.
You really shouldn’t be thinking of your enemy as beautiful Harry, he thought.
“Are you going to go back there” she eventually asked.
“Neither of us think that this is a good idea.” Ron placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder, “But if Malfoy just even insults you, I will hex him into next year.”
Now, the main question was where. The Wizarding world was still yet to fully accept gay wizards and witches so drinking in the Muggle world was the only option. That did mean no Firewhiskey though so maybe he might be alright for work tomorrow. At this point in time, Harry didn’t care where he drank, as long as there was some strong whiskey and a chair or high stool at the bar where he could drown his worries away.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted. That really wasn’t what he needed at the moment. Nobody was around to hear him anyway.
Ron tried to get rid of the tension by sticking his thumbs up in the air and trying to smile and laugh it off but Harry felt down. Real down. He had tried not to think about Ginny since they broke up. He wasn’t ready to go back to that apartment just yet. He didn’t want to see Ginny’s face just yet.
He needed to go back to the bar to see Malfoy but he couldn’t ask Hermione to get some of Ben’s hair again without being questioned nor could he ask Seamus for more polyjuice potion. Just before heading back to the crazy lunatics who still probably hadn’t started packing, Harry had a plan. A devious one at that but, what could he do.
The bar was up ahead and he made his way towards it. At the back, there were rows and rows of bottles of alcohol; whiskey, gin, wine, everything. In the state that Harry was in, he could drink the whole lot.
“Wait, what?”
“I need to get out of here. Need some space. I’m so, so sorry Ginny”
~~~~~
“If it didn’t Hermione, I wouldn’t be sitting on his sofa.” Harry raised is voice in annoyance of how stupid the question was but it was night and people above and below him were trying to get some sleep.
“Who you talking to, mate?” Ron looked at him puzzled, surprised with the sudden sound.
“I’m just gonna make this blunt because I don’t want this to be harder than it already is. I think that we should break up” Harry choked around the final words and he heard Ginny gasp slightly.
“See, you weren’t terrible at dancing.” Malfoy said, a smile starting to bloom across his face. His lips looked much redder from when he first came in and it seemed from Harry’s point of view, his trousers had gotten tighter as well. Harry blushed.
“So you can slow down mate. Also, I’m rubbish at folding clothes neatly anyway.” Ron joked to diffuse the tension. It helped.
~~~~~
Thinking back, Harry probably shouldn’t have left so suddenly. He should have comforted Ginny as she did briefly for him, wait for her to go to sleep, leave a note on the kitchen island and then go. But with his emotions through the roof, the alcohol was more tempting. Tending to his whiskey, Harry took a large gulp, the burn was smooth going down the throat and left him feeling a little better.
“How was she, when she called?”
Malfoy’s drink appeared, he paid, drank up quickly then took to the dance floor. It looked like a routine that he had done that thousands of times. The beat of the next song started to pick up and Malfoy joined the wave of dancers.
Elle x
This went on until the next song, Malfoy still grinding from behind, moving his hands up and down Harry’s sides, Harry still leaning against his shoulder. He was starting to go to the point of no return. His trousers were getting tighter, his eyes were closing in pleasure. Even if it was Malfoy doing this, Harry was enjoying himself. Enjoying dancing. Now there’s a thought he never thought he’d make.
After walking past what seemed like all the bars south of the Thames, Harry was starting to regret his decision of trying to find a bar that interested him as he was starting to lose the battle with his emotions. Many of the bars he passed that he had passed were probably adequate. They all probably served decent alcohol that could get Harry off his nerves. Maybe this was a really bad decision, Harry thought. Maybe he should have just gone straight to Ron and Hermione’s, Ron probably had a bottle of Firewhiskey on hand, even if while drinking Hermione would give him the evil glare as well as the face of a comforting friend.
Hermione moved herself out of the doorway so Harry could enter. The polyjuice potion was starting to wear off. His hair was now in splotches, a mixture of sandy brown and raven coloured hair. His skin was starting to return to normal colour and he could feel himself shrinking very slowly as he walked. Not by much though. Harry closed the door behind him and found his way to the sofa. Flopping back, he laid his head on the back of the sofa, resting his slightly throbbing head from the alcohol. He hadn’t drunk enough to be wasted but he was definitely tipsy. Harry wanted to rest his eyes and go to sleep when he remembered his two eagle-eyed best friends staring at him in front of the sofa.
“The spare bedroom is still yours.” Hermione pointed down the corridor to the door opposite Ron and Hermione’s bedroom. She got up, placed a kiss on Harry’s forehead before heading over to Ron.
“Harry…” Ginny started but Harry stopped her with a wave of his hand.
“But I should go back!” Harry got off the sofa and started pacing the space between the sofa and the opposite wall. “I can tell Seamus that I’ve sighted Malfoy and go undercover.”
Harry woke up to the feeling of cool leather underneath him. It was the same leather sofa that he had slept on on numerous occasions, most common being that he was drunk and couldn’t make it home safely. His senses were starting to wake up as he could now smell bacon and eggs wafting through their flat. He could hear the distant traffic outside and Ron and Hermione mumbling to each other. Harry, very slowly, opened his eyes and immediately shut them as the bright light coming from the window was blinding and was starting to increase his headache tenfold which had also woken up. He could now sense someone was kneeling in front of the sofa, trying to get his attention.
“This is only my second.” He downed the rest of the drink, still looking up at Malfoy.
“So, why have you come here tonight, Ben?” Malfoy asked, turning his body so he was facing Harry but still leaning against the wall. Harry gestured towards his drink, thinking that it was a perfectly valid answer to Malfoy’s question.
“Malfoy” Harry said back casually, returning to his glass and swallowing another mouthful of whiskey. The burn was much needed if he were to continue in this conversation.
“Coming right up.” Jack went away to grab one of the numerous whiskey bottles on the back shelf and filled up two fingers of whiskey. Sliding a few Muggle notes across the bar, Harry took his drink with a nod and left the bar to stand by the far wall, to be able to watch the dancers. To try and find the man he was looking for.
“I ran into Malfoy last night.” Harry spoke suddenly, string straight ahead at the opposite wall. He then heard Hermione choke on her drink.
Harry's feet kept taking him up the Muggle street and into a busier section of London. He had no idea where he was going. He just needed to rid himself of his troubles and let go of everything in his mind.
“Harry, you up mate? Here, drink this. Will make you feel better.” Ron held a potion bottle in front of him.
Upon hearing the door, Seamus stood up from his desk and glared at Harry.
Malfoy huffed in amusement to that response. Now, the moment had come, leaving. It was like that awkward moment at the end of a date when nobody had a clue what to do. They both stared at each other, a look of longing in each other’s eyes. To Harry’s surprise, they leaned in at the same time. Harry had never kissed a man before but he didn’t think that it would be as gentle as this. Malfoy’s lips were soft, not chapped compared to Harry’s, well, Ben’s. It wasn’t rough, it was rather pleasant. Although it was only a chaste kiss, it still left tingles all over Harry’s body when Malfoy stepped back. His pupils had dilated, most likely the same as Harry’s.
“Thanks Ron.” Harry returned the clap to the shoulder before heading for the door, grabbing his coat along the way and walked out of the flat.
“Then he left with the man he was dancing with. The other guy looked quite giddy and very blushed.” Harry grimaced at himself for silently thinking what happened after they left the bar.
“So you really weren’t lying when you said you wouldn’t dance.” Malfoy laughed.
“This may sound quite abrupt, which it is, I’m not hiding from that fact. But, this relationship is not going to work out. I’m,” he didn’t think that actually saying it out loud would be that much of a big of a deal. “gay.” Silence swept into the room.
Not wanting to go looking for the man in question just yet, he went to the bar where he spotted Jack. Harry nearly went up to say hi but he wasn’t himself tonight. He was Ben. Ben had never come here, he didn’t know anyone. Harry just sat on one of the bar stools casually and waited for Jack to serve him.
After being pulled upright, Ron felt Harry and most presumably returned to the kitchen. Although the hangover potion did its magic, it didn’t cure Harry’s tiredness even though he must have slept for at least 8 hours. He held his heavy head in his hands and rubbed his eyes continuously, trying to wake himself up. Harry felt the sofa dip next to him.
“Also mate, just a heads up. Ginny floo called earlier asking if you can come and get your things from your old place.” Harry was about to interrupt Ron but Ron put his hand up. “Don’t worry Harry. You can stay with us until you can find your own place.”
“Well, Jack was right about how he acts like he owns the place and that everyone does nearly everything for him.” Harry could see out of the corner of his eye Ron shuddering.
Here is your chapter for the week. Now, this chapter is a bit more saucy. I know my friend is going to be reading this and for the love of God, please don't judge me (anymore than you do already, haha).
Shaking his foot to try and remove most of the cold water droplets, he raised his head and something caught his eye. The bar was sneaked away around the corner but definitely appealed to Harry’s needs at this moment in time.
“Jack! Over here please!” Malfoy spoke to Jack, gesturing towards Harry’s empty glass. Jack nodded with a smile and went on his way to get another glass of whiskey.
“That doesn’t make me feel any better!” Harry shouted, “Anyway, we are getting off topic. I saw Malfoy at a gay bar, dancing with a Muggle and I really need to find out more.”
“Shhhh.” Harry shut the door promptly. “I was in a situation…”
However, it seemed like he would have to be on that floor sooner or later because Malfoy had spotted him staring at him during his dancing. It was like last time, except Malfoy didn’t have a partner. Harry tensed up as Malfoy, still smiling from the dancing, walked towards him.
“Where the fuck have you been Harry?!” Seamus nearly screamed.
After stripping down, the covers welcomed him into comfort. Harry didn’t realise how tired he was until his head touched down onto the pillow and he was taken away into the comforting darkness that was sleep.
“Ben. Yours?” Harry already knew the answer but he had to play his character off.
“Of money and power, yeah, yeah.” Harry interrupted him. Malfoy must have told this story to many, not just Harry. But Malfoy’s warning and threat weren’t enough to deter Harry from his goal so he raised his glass to Jack, “Another if you will, please.”
“Goodnight Harry.” Hermione said as she walked down the small corridor with Ron following her at the heel.
“Hermione. Shhhhh” Ron groggily said, raising himself from the sofa. Both him and Hermione had pyjamas on, meaning they stayed up all night waiting for Harry. That thought touched Harry a little bit.
“Go and talk to Seamus.” was all Hermione said before she left the room.
“Hey. What will it be sir?” Jack asked Harry happily. Merlin, he must have really liked his job Harry thought.
Seamus knew where this was going, “But you want to go back so you…”
“Yes, Ron. It's not that difficult to get your head around.” Harry was starting to regret his decision in telling them this.
They had just broken up. With the realisation and dawn of his new sexuality, Harry couldn't remain in his current relationship for any longer. It would be a burden for him and unfair for Ginny. Luckily, she was thinking the same and they both agreed that they were better off as friends anyway and would leave on good terms. Breaking up with someone, even if they were the wrong person, still stung painfully as if his heart was being attacked by hundreds of bees.

Making his way slowly down the stairs, his thoughts started to wander to last night. He remembered the way Malfoy held him as they danced together, remembered the way Malfoy spoke to him with no facade or mask and how he looked. Free. Enjoying himself. Harry remembered the way Malfoy’s lips attached to his neck and how those lips kissed him softly at the end of the night when Malfoy walked him to the train station. Harry, well Ben, promised that he would return and see him again. And Harry wanted to, not because of his nosy investigation but rather he actually wanted to go. He wanted to see Malfoy again. Wanted to dance with him and be held by him again. His mind started providing pictures of how his night could end if all went well but Harry shook those thoughts away.
Oh shit.
“Thank you. Draco,” that word was so difficult to fall from his lips, “I have to go now.” Harry knew what he wanted to do and had a pretty big hunch of what Malfoy wanted to do, but he didn’t want his own personal mission to be finished just yet. He wanted to find out more about Malfoy and sleeping with him, especially under polyjuice potion was a bad idea.
Hermione was quiet for a while, processing everything that she had just heard. To Harry, she didn’t look concerned, upset, disgusted or angry, unlike Ron who had now returned to the living room and leaned against the opposite wall facing the sofa.
Seamus returned to sitting in at his desk, still giggling “Why don’t you just go back?”
“I’m Harry.” He actually found some words. Harry accepted Jack’s hand quickly and returned to glancing around the bar. The music was starting to pick up slowly again and people, mainly couples, were starting to move to the floor.
“We have plenty, don’t worry Ginny.” Hermione interrupted her as she reached into her coat pockets and withdrew small, brown boxes then spelled them back to original size.
Harry shrugged off Ron’s comment and stood up.
“Anyway, I was watching the people on the dance floor and saw a guy with really blonde hair. His back was towards me so I didn’t originally realise that it was Malfoy. But as soon as I saw the mark on his arm, I knew it was him. And he was dancing with a man, quite intimately I remember.” Harry blushed slightly. “And his partner was also a Muggle.”
Well that was sudden.
“What?” Ron asked defensively, putting the boxes that he was carrying onto the kitchen island. Hermione scrunched up her face as much as she could to stop her from laughing and Ginny turned away and covered her mouth with her hand.
The doors pinged open with the usual sound of “Welcome to Department of Magical Law Enforcement”. Harry walked quickly towards his shared office with Seamus Finnegan. Ron was originally his Auror partner and they worked really well together but Ron decided to call it quits and help George out with the joke shop that was still very popular. He and Seamus had been Auror partners for nearly 8 months now and although he wasn’t Ron, Seamus still made Harry’s work life enjoyable, especially during the really boring cases.
“Well, I went to this particular bar because it interested me from the outside. So I went in, ordered a drink and thought about the recent event.”
“Whiskey. The strongest you have.” Harry replied firmly. He did come here with a mission after all.
“Harry, please look at me” Ginny whispered softly. When Harry made no move to turn his head, she took her finger, placed it under his chin and tilted his head gently so they were eye-to-eye.
“Harry, how are you feeling?” Hermione’s soft voice spoke next to him. “You passed out as soon as you got into the car. Ron had to carry you up the stairs.” There was slight amusement in her voice, trying to lighten the situation.
“You’re welcome Ben. Was that your first time there?”
“So, you’re really kicking me out? Merlin, Malfoy! I’d actually believe you if I was a bit drunker, which by the looks of things, you’re not gonna allow me to do. You’re acting like you own the bloody place.” Harry finally turned away to face the bottles of alcohol once more.
“I don’t really know. Not to find someone,” Harry lied, “and certainly not to dance. I’m awful at dancing.” That part was true. Harry drank deeply from his whiskey. He turned his head minutely to get a glance at Malfoy. He was staring at Harry’s throat as it worked on swallowing his drink down. Malfoy caught him looking and straightened up.
Ginny only nodded while Hermione went to go whisper something in Ron’s ear. Upon hearing what Hermione told him, Ron ran to Ginny to look through the photo book before promptly laughing as well. So there he was, Harry, in his old apartment, holding two boxes stacked on top of one another, staring accusingly at his so called “friends” laughing their asses off from looking at most likely the most embarrassing or jarring pictures of Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But nobody did it because they had to or that it was Malfoy. They actually did it because they like him?” Harry was still trying to answer that question.
“Draco. Draco Malfoy”
Being alone, Harry could gather his messed up and crumpled thoughts together. Although he didn’t intend to, he replayed this evening's events in his head.
Harry obliged and faced away from Malfoy. He didn’t know what he was doing but he had an idea of what Malfoy was going to do next.
A few minutes later, Jack came up to him.
“I personally don’t think that going back to that bar is going to help anybody.” Hermione said quietly. She really is like a mother isn’t she, Harry thought to himself.
“Big guy?” Even the thought of Malfoy being the “big guy” made Harry feel grossed out.
“Ha. You can blame my parents for that. Very traditional, liked to keep the family trait of naming their children after constellations.” Malfoy replied smoothly. He acknowledged Jack when he arrived, handing the drink to Harry.
At least I will be like everyone else, Harry thought.
“I don’t know.” was Harry’s response. “Still adjusting.”
“Go on.”
“Did you interact with him?” Hermione asked.
While stumbling to the station, Harry had already made up his mind that he would return to that particular bar in order to find Malfoy again and find out what he was up to. Nobody had heard of the Malfoy name since the Deatheater trials so they must have shut themselves up and removed their burdens, that being themselves, from the Wizarding ear. So it was an extreme surprise when Harry just suddenly found him again, albeit not intentionally, at a gay bar in the middle of Muggle London. The only way that he would be able to successfully find out what Malfoy was doing nowadays was to go in disguised. The most obvious option was under the cover of polyjuice. Harry could easily pick some up from work as Aurors sometimes used polyjuice potions undercover to get closer to criminals. Yes, that was the plan, to go back to what Jack had dubbed it as “Draco’s bar” and discover who Malfoy now really was.
Thanks everyone for reading, I hope you all have a fantastic week.
Confusion. Confusion, anger, sadness is what Harry felt as he stumbled out onto the Muggle streets of London. It was night, the darkness was welcoming. The sounds of oncoming traffic could be heard but only slightly over the heavy beating of Harry's rapid heart. Tears had threatened to spill from his eyes but he blinked them away. Harry's feet quickly moved him away from the apartment building, his and Ginny's apartment building.
“Excellent, are we done here? I need my sleep and you Pans dear, need to fix your atrocious nails. Really that shade of blue does nothing for your complexion” Draco really needed his annoying friends out of the room before he dug himself further into a hole.
Draco was only young when he realised that nothing was ever as it seems. The light doesn’t hate the dark, the fire craves the water, love grows off of pain. Why he thought this happened, was an entirely different matter, perhaps one day he’ll understand that burning passion, the longing for something that he shouldn’t have. But all he could think of is the look in Potter’s eye earlier that night and he knew he would come to know. Eventually.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter.” He climbed down the stairs on the astronomy tower, the white glow of the moon following him as the door closed behind him
He truly loved his friends, but Salazar he would never tell them that their ego was far too large already.
The figure wasn’t particularly tall, definitely more of a muscular build, hair that looked extremely messy from what he could see. They stepped into the light as Draco groaned internally. Of course, it was bloody Potter.
“Nott.” Draco greeted.
Potter moved, making the hand Draco was using on his back dropped to his shoulder.
Draco sighed internally, he knew Potter would ask one day but he had hoped he would’ve come up with a believable answer by then.
i literally posted a chapter yesterday, and now there's another, please clap for me.
Theo looked worried as his eyes flashed back towards Blaise who was shaking his head at Pansy used to her ways.
Dinner gradually finished, as Pansy rambled about some irrelevant drama she had heard about from a random Ravenclaw in the hall. Blaise occasionally gave a noise of agreement in the correct places, like the good boyfriend he was. While Draco on the other hand had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, he lost track ten minutes ago when she had barely started.
Theo laughed at the nickname, which turned into a cough at Draco’s glare,
Draco rolled his eyes at the dramatics, nudging the arm from his shoulders and entering the library.
“It’s time like this where you should wish to be a Slytherin, Potter” He scoffed, “Don’t scoff,” Draco said, “Snape would’ve believed you in a heartbeat no matter if you were Harry Potter or not.”
“I think he was telling the truth at the end of the tournament, I mean when has Potter ever lied successfully, and also why the fuck would he murder Diggory. There’s no bad bone in Saint Potter’s body. Except maybe his intolerable face…”
As he reached the bottom, Draco realised that he had in some way enjoyed talking to Potter. It was a different company than he was used to, the retorts were still the same and it was sort of like the old interactions Draco had had with Potter but there was this new underlining friendliness to it. Which surprisingly Draco didn’t oppose, he almost longed for another chance to talk to Potter in that way.
wtf why does this look longer on google docs IM SO SORRY THIS IS SO SHORT
“I’m so honoured that you’re using such a rare possession to meet lovely old me on the dusty top of the astronomy tower.” Draco purred, eyes flickering away from Potter to look at the lake below.
ok this did take me far too long to write, i keep skipping ahead and writing later chapters because i get ideas and then i come back to these earlier chapters and im like fuck what do i write this is so boring, but here we are. it's so late also i am meant to be revising for my chemistry exam since im failing atm oh well yolo.
Draco glanced up out of his thoughts at the approaching sound of footsteps, to catch Theo’s dark hair poking around the corner, the immediate panic that rose as he heard the sound, flooded out of him.
Potter faced him, in a strangely calm manner, since when was Potter calm Draco wondered. This situation couldn’t get any weirder, however, it did, “No Seamus, I just chose to not respond to idiots who believe the fucking Prophet. Go blow a cauldron up or something.” Potter replied smoothly.
Draco’s eyes flashed in the light still beaming through the glass windows, of course, that’s what Potter thought he was doing, Potter is just as prejudiced as he remembered. Just like the rest, believing that the Slytherins were up to no good twenty-four-seven.
“And Potter. Five points from Gryffindor for being out after curfew,” Draco called behind him as he walked around the corner to the staircase down to the dungeons.
“Thank you.” Potter held his gaze for a few more seconds before leaning back into Draco’s side.
Draco held the gaze for a few moments before he narrowed his eyes at Potter who seemed to be ignoring whatever Granger was whispering into his ear.
Draco pushed the chair opposite him in a blatant move of assurance, looking up at Theo with a nod,
And with that said, Draco span and left Potter to stare at the back of his head.
“Your trial for underaged magic?”
However, before he could even utter a single word, Draco stood, downing the remainders of his water before strolling out of the Great Hall without a second look back. He could feel the eyes of numerous people on his back as he reached the doors including those of Harry motherfucking Potter.
Draco turned to Pansy, raising an eyebrow at the amused look in her eyes, she raised an eyebrow, eyes flickering to the side and back multiple times. He glanced back to where she was obviously trying to make him look, and spoke into the newfound silence that fell again after Finnegan ran away, “Well that was entertaining.” Turning his gaze onto Potter, grey meeting green in the corridor for a moment before he spun away from his eyes and strolled down the hall without a second glance at Potter, Pansy, and Blaise following behind him not at all surprised at his dramatics.
Until one day, Draco was walking down to the library with Pansy and Blaise for one of their study sessions that often just turned into Pansy gossiping about whatever she had gotten her hands onto that day.  Potter and his crew were walking only a few meters ahead of Draco when he saw Umbridge peer out of the abandoned classroom she had discreetly tried to hide in and watch the students go past. Potter was none the wiser, the Gryffindork was in a world of his own as he strolled past her position.
Draco enjoyed the fact Theo didn’t pressure him into telling what was wrong even though he clearly knew something was up, Draco supposed they weren’t as close as him, Blaise, and Pansy but they were close enough that Draco would suspect Theo to be questioning in a similar way the others were.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant Draco congratulated himself, this is exactly why he was sorted into Slytherin. Pansy and Blaise would not know what hit them.
Draco cursed inwardly, as he pushed the door fully open to unveil himself to Potter.
“Yes, but I knew what you were thinking, prat.”
“Still fucking barmy as hell,” Draco said standing following Blaise to their common room in the dungeons, “Why did I think we were going to get any information out of the daft bat?”
this chapter definitely makes no sense fyi.
also yes this is love story for the chapter name. taylor's version only... APRIL 9TH IS LEGIT LIKE NEXT WEEK, don't touch me.
“I didn’t know if you wanted company or not, but the common room was far too loud to work,” Theo sat down, pushing Draco’s shit aside to place his book down,
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco scoffed at the bastard, “Mmmm it is.”
Potter looked disturbed at the prospect of being a Slytherin or was it the fact Snape was not as evil as he thought, Draco couldn’t tell,
“His face, oh Merlin. He’s so confused by you Draco.” He chortled, “Just what are you doing to the poor guy.” Draco pushed the door open, “I’ve never seen him look so baffled at anything ever.”
“How nice of you to join us Draco,” Pansy drawled, walking towards Draco and Theo,
“Alright, I get it! I have been acting strange today, and oh well I was feeling nice today that’s all.” Draco lied, best not to draw attention to his inner crisis.
“You know Theo, you don’t have to ask to join me in the library, you can come whenever,” Theo raised a dark eyebrow, “Just don’t tell the other two, they would heckle me for days.”
As the door closed up behind them, Blaise bellowed,
Draco wondered how Potter was able to sneak around to meet him without getting caught. He turned to retort to Potter before he noticed a sad glint in the green eyes avoiding his face. Weirdly Draco had an unbearably urge to make Potter smile, to remove the sadness from his eyes.
“That’s where I learned the single healing charm from. He’s quite useful sometimes.”
“Anyway,” Draco returned to his point, “I think they’re starting to believe I’m not actually me, but rather a polyjuiced version.” He snorted in remembrance of his friends' dramatics.
“Pansy, dearest Theodore.” He grumbled at his full name, “It's about time we were on a first-name basis. Since you’ve been keeping sweetest Draco company through his ever so hard times” Pansy smiled devilishly as Theo, who was looking back at her like he had never seen anything like it.
“Oh.” That did make sense now that Draco thought about it. Merlin he really needed to start irritating Potter again.
He still wanted to say something to Potter, whether it was the light of the moon on his skin or the way Potter stared longingly out onto the Quidditch pitch illuminated by the tiny specs of light, making him act this way. He didn’t know.
Fuck.
Draco cleared his throat, “So Hogsmeade this weekend?”
He rolled his eyes, no way was he being dragged into it if he didn’t need to be.
“Draco your casual act may work on plebeians but did you really think it would work on us” Pansy questioned.
The door creaked behind him, he spun his head round to see Potter pulling off a cloak, a surprised look on his face,
draco waxing poetry about harry's eyes... delightful
Draco raised one eyebrow, his expression clearly reading ‘of course you were’ indicating at the scene he walked into not short of twenty seconds ago. He wouldn’t put it past the nosy gits though, he knew they were watching him closely lately, but it wasn’t any of their business whether Draco was hiding in the library, in the far back behind the books no one reaches for, of course, he wasn’t. But still wasn’t any of their business if he was.
Draco distractedly answered, “Theodore.” Before he headed in the direction of Pansy and Blaise.
Pansy took pity on him, “He means that Potter is probably wondering why you aren’t antagonising him,” She sighed, like Draco was a complete idiot, “Which is probably why he looks perplexed every time he looks at you.”
Every. Single. God. Damn. Time.
Pansy’s face twisted in sympathy at the mention of his father, they were both aware of how demanding and rather intimidating Draco’s father could be when he wasn’t happy with Draco, which was quite frequently actually when he thought about it.
“There’s the Draco we all know and love.” He remarked, “How lovely to have you back with us.”
Well if Draco was thinking like the clever man he believed himself as, he really didn’t think there was a spell involved which caused Draco’s head to go into complete disarray… it was probably the fact that Potter was acting weirdly. Yes, that’s it.
draco sucks at comforting bc i suck at comforting. i had no idea how to write a person comforting someone else which is why that part sucks.
Draco turned to Theo as they entered shortly behind Pansy and Blaise,
“Potter,” He began, “I know what it’s like to feel the pressure, even if it’s not in the same way as you. I know also that it’s so fucking tiring putting up an act for the whole world to see.”
“When is he not.”
The great hall was just as Draco remembered, so fucking loud. But this year there was heavy anticipation in the air which Draco could only narrow down to being Potter. Of course. The majority of the Hogwarts houses kept throwing glances at the doors as if the answer to all their questions would walk through it at any moment, Draco couldn’t blame them he was also waiting for answers in the form of Harry Potter and his crew.
Blaise cut in, “You also haven’t ranted about his awful hair, awful eyes, awful-”
The tears seemed to have reduced but Draco still softly spoke,
“And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?”
Potter snorted, grinning at Draco’s dramatics.
Draco’s hand flew to his hair, which wasn’t slick back thank you very much, he told Potter as such, But the bastard just laughed at the scowl formed on Draco’s face.
It shouldn’t be so hard to be mean to Potter’s terrible face and then be some degree of nice to him when they were alone. Even when he said it in his head, Draco knew how utterly ridiculous it was.
“ DETENTION, Mr. Potter!”
The music’s beat was starting again and people were starting to move with the rhythm. That included Malfoy. He raised his hands into the air, just like everyone else and swayed his hips sensually to the music. It was quite arousing. Meanwhile, Harry stood there like a lemon having absolutely no fucking clue what to do. He tried to move his arms like everyone else was but that just made him feel very self conscious. What if he hit someone? He tried to move his feet and swayed a little bit before returning to basically a statue. His face said it all. He was not a dancer. Malfoy looked at Harry with pity and leaned in towards his ear so he could be heard.
Mr. Harry James Potter of number four Privet Drive was proud to say that he was perfectly normal…well, for a young wizard, that was…and the only problem with this viewpoint was that the rest of the wizarding world had disagreed with him on that point since before he even knew about the wizarding world. Or, truthfully, before they even knew anything of actual fact about him. And all they'd known was that he'd somehow become the only person to survive the killing curse, and as a baby at that. However, even he had to change this opinion about himself upon his 16th birthday. That was, of course, when something so completely unordinary happened that even he, unobservant as he normally was, could not ignore it.
Harry took no note of that though as he and his Mate leapt to each other across the room, the lightning bolts carrying them, cradling them, and they heedless of the danger it should have posed to them and instead focused solely on their need to be with each other.
He couldn't see it in the way his vision now was focused on them but the enchanted ceiling above had gone from a beautiful clear night to show a storm instead. And, for the first time in Hogwarts history, the weather it reflected became what happened inside of Hogwarts Great Hall as lightning bolts made from pure magic started striking from the ceiling, missing all students and striking the tables, banners, and floor.
And that was what Harry was currently doing. Staying up, and watching the clock tick down to his birthday, just as he'd done ever since he realized birthdays were normally celebrated by people back when he first started primary school, and realized that not only was his name not Freak, but that he was apparently weird in addition to being freakish because he didn't even know his own birthdate (Aunt Petunia at least had been nice enough to tell him his birthdate, then had slapped him for disturbing her a few days after Thomas in his first year of primary public school had asked him when he'd be celebrating his birthday, as that had been his birthday and the class had all sung happy birthday to him and everyone in class had gone around telling their birthday, except for Harry who hadn't known when his was). At least that was one thing he could have control over by learning enough to be normal, so this tradition was very important for him. It had also come in handy on his eleventh birthday when his staying up late had meant he'd been able to see all of his friend Hagrid's entrance into his life, and with that, his entrance into the wizarding world. Which had been one of the best birthday presents he'd ever received, to be able to go somewhere where he wasn't reminded every single day of how non-normal he was. At least in the wizarding world he was normal enough to have a name, even if he was rather not-normal to have so many people know it before he introduced himself to them. When he'd first started going to primary school in the muggle world, he had felt hurt, sad, and decidedly exactly like the Freak that his relatives had decided he was as far back as he could remember and which he'd swiftly deduced that first day in school was an insult and not normal for him to think his name to be when roll call had been done and he'd been shocked to hear that he had a different name: Harry James Potter. And, knowing how his relatives plainly told him they absolutely loathed, despised, and hated him…it wasn't hard to figure out "freak" was not a name anyone should have, and that had only been confirmed when he'd asked the teacher during break time what the meaning of the word freak was. It had been mortifying to hear the whispers and giggles when the teacher had to use process of elimination when he hadn't responded to that name and had been the only one who hadn't responded to any name by the time she'd finished roll call. Thankfully she just thought he hadn't understood her instructions to say "here" or raise his hand or nod when she'd told them what to do during roll call, and he'd been quick to simply nod his head when she'd told him it was okay to be shy, and to try tomorrow to respond while she was still getting used to remembering everyone's names. After all, it would have just made him stand out more if he'd told her she'd said the wrong name, especially when he realized how the Dursley's had confused him after finding out what the actual meaning of the word Freak was, and that she had said the right name for him.
"get out, pansy." draco spat into his fluffy pillow, not being able to see her reaction.
"how dare you speak of my father that way?!" draco yelled, shoving harry into the wall. now not caring what the people outside the closet might be thinking.
he walked slowly onto his balcony. the cold air thrashinh him in every single possible place on his lily-white body. the scars across his chest where standing out more than usual, he tried not to look. he instead looked over the entrance to the manor. his mind wondering all over the place. all over a certain wizard.
this was very true. over the years draco has found plenty of ways to sneak around the house; but he didn't feel like sneaking around today, he just wanted to get where he needed to be. he didn't want to sneak around anymore.
draco contemplated for ten minutes whether or not he wanted to go inside. but in the end, of course his curiosity came over him.
"i came to get you of course." he laughed, walking closer to draco.
"okay, who wants to pick the people first?" ginny asked in almost a whisper. of course pansy parkinson's hand shot up first .
so many emotions flew through draco at once. he felt a sense of loss due to harry's skin not being against his anymore. he was so touch deprived, he never wanted to let potter go. but there was on thing that he knew for sure..
"it's a surprise." harry said in a high pitched voice. he spoke the sentence all in one breath, he obviously didn't want to upset draco.
just that one simple feeling fading, would change everything.
"oh shut the fuck up malfoy! how about we talk about your past huh? weren't you were a death eater? will your father hear about this now?" harry crossed his arms, his voice got louder with every word.
"wow malfoy, you've grown to be so..." a deep voice tried hard to figure out the perfect word to represent what he had just seen draco do, "tolerant."
she began to lean down towars him, he arms moving toward his neck. just as draco was scared of what she was about to do, pansy unbuttoned the top button of his black dress shirt.
but suddenly,
"nothing, it faded into nothing. that bitch pansy woke me up." he spat. he hated pansy right now, she ruined the whole experience that he was loving so dearly.
the moment felt like it could last forever, but of course it couldn't, nothing could.
"well we can't stay." harry looked at his mud-covered shoes, digging them farther into the gravel. mud covering the entire toe of his boot.
"for what?" pansy smiled, she dragged her fingertips down the toned muscle of malfoy's back; she tickled him into chills in the process.
"that's a first." ron laughed as he walked right past him.
"you can't keep doing this to yourself. you look terrible." she pulled his messy platinum hair out of his eye, the skin below was sticky.
the look on harry's face changed without him knowing. the only reason he found out was because of what draco said next.
"well, let's go in then." pansy clapped, she grabbed his hand again. can't she take a bloody hint?
across the store he saw the one person that has been on his mind for every second of the past two days.
"you've got to be fucking kidding me." draco’s lips curled. obviously not happy at the thought of going back to the castle.
"come on!! we can't miss it!!" they grasped draco's hand, pulling his body from the fluffy mess that was the bed.
kreature looked back up at him, trying to see his face better. when he caught a glimpse od draco he was almost surprised to see mr. malfoy at his house, even when his school enemy has taken over.
"what are you doing here?" draco tried to desperately not to smile, but he just couldn't help it. he was so happy to see him here, he was the only person he cared to see.
he walked over to his window and unlocked it slowly. a loud barn owl bolting into the wall.
hermione granger hadn't changed a bit since their adventures. she still fact checked every little thing, she still questioned harry. but, harry has to admit, her bushy hair did lie on her head a little neater that it did in first year. he also still had to admit that he still loved her endlessly, he wouldn't last two minutes without her.
"what's wrong, mother?" he said in a calm voice, hoping nothing absolutely terrible was going to come out of her mouth.
when he looked up from his body he saw a sight that he least wanted to see, he and pansy were standing in front of 12 grimmauld place.
harry whipped his head around to stare right at draco. neither of the boys could move an inch, they didn't know if they even wanted to.
the fountain stood tall, a fleur-de-lis stood high on the top. it was covered in moss and dirt; but the water was crystal blue, the only objects that weren't blue in the water were all the muggle coins draco had found in london. on the second level on the fountain, draco planted multicolored flowers, it took him all day to figure out the spell to stop the water flow going into the second level, he was only 13 at the time. he has had to replant the flowers several times since then; they were much overgrown no, but draco liked it that way. vines coiled up the entire thing, some had thorns, some didn't. at the end of the day, this was draco's prized creation, a fountain.
suddenly he felt like he was being sucked through a tight rubber tube. it felt like his skin was being scraped down a glass window, his face distorting in the most frightening way. draco always liked to open his eyes exactly when he would disapparate. it looked like he was in a giant ball of lint, except the lint had a flashing light somewhere in it. but as soon as the adventure started, it ended. he felt his shoes smack against the ground, his hair nearly losing its shape from the wind he created.
"someone is happy to see me." the other boy smiled, now wrapping his arms around draco's waist, in someway pulling him tighter.
"have you ever had a secret love affair?" harry asked, rubbing the soft skin of dracos thumb, trying to desperately to understand what it meant; who it was for.
he ran into his room and slammed the door in fear. what if his mother finds out he just lied? what would she think? what would
he stood on his tiptoes to reach draco's lips. he placed a soft, gentle kiss onto them. he took his hand into his once again.
hermione didn't respond to him for seconds. her throat clogged by the surprise that harry would say such a surprising thing. she wanted to tell him that it wasn't a foul thing to say, but she would be telling a lie.
"draco, since i can't be there for you in the flesh, i want you to have everything. so go for it, be brave. go where you heart is guiding you and don't be afraid to lose in the process; you can't be afraid." alice's voice felt like ice splashing into his ears. she had said exactly what he thought she would say, but it was exactly what he needed to hear. she was always here, hopefully it would be like that forever.
"its beautiful." he smiled, squeezing his hand softly.
and he still couldn't follow through with the plan. he felt like nothing, he felt weak. he felt like his father would never speak to him again. in those months, he was at his lowest point.
"wake up! oh my fuck draco!" pansy shook him a little harder. her nails digging into his bare torso.
he reached for both his hands and intertwined their fingers, the temperatures always working so well together. he looked into his green eyes, as he moved closer to him. their lips connected like it was nothing, like it was effortless. it felt so familiar, but still so exhilarating; it felt like he never needed anyone else in his life, no one but him.
think?
as soon as he his foot finished climbing the steps, he saw familier sticky bodies jumbled together, not seeing anyone who really caught his eye. he just wanted to get this over with, wanted to get whatever
thank god he wasn't bothered by kreature on his journey up to the second floor. the floor where draco and harry had been stuck in a closet together for seven painful minutes straight.
him. the straight, pureblood malfoy he was born to be.
draco was glued to the hardwood floor once he saw the bloke. his shiny black hair a mess on top of his skull (as it always was). he was wearing a forest green crewneck, it was loose against his tan body. his plump lips were smothered in lip balm. he was holding a pair of red plaid pajama trousers. his glasses looking the same as they always have, round, a little crooked.
"there you are." harry smiled, he curled his messy hair behind his ear, fixing his glasses again.
had draco's wand in a knot. he might be underestimating the word when he thinks this, but that is how it feels. he wanted his entire life to be different. if he could go back to hogwarts, he would change everything. he would change every single last thing.
his hands shook with embarrassment. he looked down at his feet, he couldn't decide if he wanted to tell the truth or tell his mother a flat out lie. he decided to go with the more noble route.
"alice! please, alice!" he screamed as he ran to the fountain. he hit his pelvic bone on the granite when he finally arrived. he looked deep into the water.
harry's face instantly dropped, his cheeks somehow heating while he facial expression dropped cold. he hadn't forgotten he sent the note, he just hadn't wanted it to come up. harry sent the note because he couldn't bare the guilt anymore, he couldn't sit in grimmauld place and pretend he didn't feel bad for what he said to draco back in the closet. he was so afraid for what would come next that he just stared into his own oblivion of thought.
draco would bet her 1,000 gallons that hermione granger will give him a cold look, cho chang will give him side-eye, and ron weasley will scowl at him. he didn't get along well with the kids from his hogwarts days, or at least the kids from the other houses. he really could only stand talking to ravenclaws and hufflepuffs.
he turned his body to face the much shorter man. he raised his hands to cup his face. harry snuggled his cheek into his grasp, he held onto his forearms. draco slid his hand into the black hair above harry's ear. he saw the happiness lay behind harry's dilated pupils, im sure harry could see the same thing behind his own.
but draco couldn't keep himself still, he was walking to slow. he ran as fast as he could to close the 10 foot gap between their bodies. he slammed into him with everything he had, wrapping his arms around his neck. he shoved his cold nose into his blazing neck, making small happy noises as he did.
as soon as he was fully clothed he opened his door, trying not to make any noise in the process. but of course, as soon as he left the house elves went in to clean his room. he walked down the massive black staircase on his tiptoes, again, trying to make as little noise as possible. but of course, he can't do anything in this house without someone seeing.
"why?" that's all draco could get out, so many reasons were racing through his mind.
"is anyone there?" draco shouted into the nothingness of his garden trails. the flowers were still shaking from the impact of the crack. alice was in the fountain as still as if there was no wind to push her, had this person heard anything?
"well maybe you should read the cover." his mother shot at him, throwing the paper across the table. he picked it up.
when their lips connected, draco saw sparks behind his closed eyelids. harry's warm lips felt so good against his cold ones, the temperatures working so well together. it felt as if the cold months were slipping away and the sun was finally shining through the clouds. he felt as if they were laying in the middle of a field full of daisies, reading rainbow rowell novels, never looking away from each other or the page. he felt like this was what he has longed for; now that he finally had it, he felt like he could breathe.
"don't listen to him draco, lets just go upstairs." pansy looked up at him, her eyebrows furrowed with what she would count as empathy.
"how much did you drink last night?" she questioned.
"wake up! wake up draco!" he heard a familiar voice shake him, feathers flying all around him.
as soon as he walked in, the musty smell hit him the the face. there was black dresser that was in the corner of the room, it was covered in dust. honestly the room looked like it hadn't been occupied in years. the quilt that laid on the bed was orange with blue and white squares on it. there was lamp on the corner of the dresser illuminating the room with yellow light. the walls were covered with a run down gray-blue wall paper. why can't potter take care of his damn house? the only real thing that really suck out to draco was the black rocking chair in the bottom left corner of the room. the chair had a white floral pillow sitting on it.
"you know what, you will be the end of me pansy." draco said, he quickly stood up and summoned his jacket, shoes, and belt over to him.
he dismissed the owl out the window.
"pansy, this is single handedly the ugliest shirt i have ever seen." draco nagged at pansy. she was holding a navy blue button up top with boats on it.
know why.
everyone in the room cheered, except for draco. of course, the one time he decided to listen to a weasley this is what comes out of her mouth. he felt like he couldn't speak, the mix of the confusion of harry, and the anger at ginny not mixing well in his brain.
"yes." he whispered.
"talking about the past. i assumed it would be water under the bridge now, but it just came out. i wanted to stop myself, but i still have so much anger toward the creepy bloke." harry rubbed his eyes aggressively, not wanting to look into hermione's.
"you didn't talk to me for two years after the war!" she smiled, inferring draco doesn't feel the best for not keeping in touch after he left.
harry took hold of draco's hand once again, the ice cold temperature cooling his sweat covered skin once again. of course he took the hand that had the tattoo, wanting to analyze it more. harry didn't understand why he was so deeply fascinated by the daisy, maybe it was because he was to afraid to ask about it. he didn't want to make malfoy more upset than he already was.
"yes, i know you do, mother. i just want to get where i need to be today. and i'd just like to be alone." he said, terrified of what his mother would say next.
"what do you mean 'go to hogwarts'? isnt it still in ruins?" draco scrunched his face up as he talked.
enough company.
why was pansy so mad anyways? it was just one time he asked her to get out, it certainly wasn't the first time; it won't be the last either. maybe he forgot about something that they were supposed to do today. but he didn't care, he either wanted to be alone, or with
"alice, i know. im so sorry, but this is an emergency!" he yelled inches above the water, he needed her to tell him what was going on with him, with his feelings.
well, shit.
"well i had a dream.. he woke me up in a bed full of feathers, he looked so handsome. he pulled me out of bed, we were both naked and admiring each others figures. then he dragged me onto the beach. alice, there was the most beautiful sunset, i wish you could have seen it. then he kissed me and told me there wasn't another person he'd rather be with..." draco smiled to himself, the heat of his cheeks amplifying even more.
“Suspicious like you” Blaise grumbled under his breath.
His hand reached Potter’s shaking arm as the coolness of his fingers drew Potter to look at him. The green eyes stared at him, the tears making them glisten in the white glow of the moon.
Potter spun, turning to face Draco’s direction, any sign of pain disappearing off his face, the hand he was clutching falling behind his back.
Potter protested, attempting to yank his hand from Draco. Draco was taller than Potter which led to his attempts of escaping failing quite miserably. Draco turned the hand and saw something which frankly shocked him.
“Yes?”
“Malfoy,” Potter snorted, “Why am I not surprised it's you?”
“Oh sure.” Draco drawled, elbowing Pansy in the side at the remark.
Potter hadn’t appeared to have noticed Draco's presence, and at closer inspection, he was acting weirdly, face pulled into a grimace of pain and one hand clutched in the other.
Grinning was a much better expression on Potter’s face than sadness or anger he decided. The side of his lips lifting slightly at the sight.
“Mmmm okay if you say so Malfoy,”
Weasley of course was the first to jump in and defend his best friend,
As he stood, Draco caught green eyes for half a second, before he strolled out of the hall. At the moment he had locked eyes with Potter, he saw exactly what Pansy was talking about, there was obvious bewilderment there. Gryffindor’s weren’t known for being subtle about their emotions, which is how Draco ended up with Blaise snorting about Potter’s confusion the whole way down to the common room.
Draco acted without a second thought, casting the only healing charm he was capable of. His magic fizzled into Potter’s skin, as he squawked in protest of being at the end of Draco’s wand. The words were still a red prominent sentence against the tan skin, but they weren’t bleeding any longer and the pain would have subsided. If Draco looked at Potter he would’ve seen multiple emotions flicker across his face, relief, suspicion, and mostly confusion, but he daren’t. He had no explanation as to why he just healed his enemy in the moon-lit halls, and he rather Potter didn’t ask him what the fuck he was doing.
Draco knew the situation was completely out of hand if oblivious Potter was aware of how strange this whole thing was.
Draco wondered as he walked down to the floor he usually came across Potter on, if he was getting some kind of awful karma from his past life. He arrived later than normal, wasn’t on purpose but he didn’t object to potentially missing Potter this time. But no. There, sat on the window ledge with his legs swung over the edge looking over the moonlit courtyard, was Potter.
“That’s the thing. Malfoy told me that I shouldn’t go back to that bar ever again and he will probably be on the lookout for me.” Harry said, a hint of sadness in his voice.
After buying his ticket, he got on the correct train which miraculously just arrived and sat down. It was late at night and there were only a few people in his carriage. He was giddy. Harry lifted his fingers to his lips, the kiss still remaining there. As the train started moving out of the station, Harry thought to himself. He was in for a whirlwind of a ride.
~~~~~
Harry quickly looked away. He didn’t want to be staring at something that intimate, in the open air just yet. Remember what you came here for. Harry’s whiskey had been forgotten while he was staring at Malfoy on the dance floor. Now, not only did Harry need to drink to forget Ginny and his relationship problems, he also needed to forget Malfoy who was only dancing about 10 metres away. Another big gulp should get him started at least.
Harry was carried out of his thoughts when he heard a car horn in the distance and somebody shouting his name. He must have gotten to the station quicker than he thought. He could make out in the distance Ron waving drastically at him, his way to try and get his attention. Harry continued walking towards him, and hopefully some hangover potion.
“So, what will it be Harry?” Jack said a little louder than before.
A strange thought then occurred to Harry. Why was Malfoy, in all his pure-blood glory, dancing to Muggle music, surrounded by Muggles and dancing with a Muggle in a gay bar? His question was soon answered as Malfoy turned his head and found Harry staring. A complete look of surprise, and possibly disgust was placed on his face. But, as quickly as he saw Harry, Malfoy’s well trained smirk made its way onto his lips and he wrapped his arms casually around the shorter man’s neck from behind and lowered his lips to the man’s exposed shoulder.
“First time” the barman said while cleaning a glass. He didn’t sound like he was mocking Harry for being a first timer. The music by now had quieten so there was no need to shout.
Harry merely snorted at that. How will he be alright? He had just lost his girlfriend, he is gay, will probably never find love again and be alone forever and the Wizarding World will be nipping at his heels even more than they already are.
Harry nodded slowly, “He was there.”
“Thank you.” Harry choked out before sobbing his eyes out. Hermione’s fast reactions enveloped him in a tight hug so he could cry on her shoulder. Harry heard scuffling on the hardwood floorboards and felt Ron’s arms encircling them both in an even tighter embrace.
“Yes, just tell Head Auror Robards that I was ill.”
When they reached the station, Harry turned around to look at Malfoy.
“Of course! He probably decided to remove his name from Wizarding mouths because of all the bullshit that followed in his wake!” Harry could tell Ron was getting quite angry from jst hearing the name, Malfoy. In his friendship group, nobody has mentioned the Malfoy name for 5 years. They all wanted to put the war and everything related to that behind them, start on a clean, new slate. So, to suddenly bring the name back up when you’ve just had a breakdown and everyone is in a melancholy mood was probably not the best move.
