"DON'T TOUCH ME!" Harry growled, flinching away from her touch. Fire in his eyes. The calming potion unfortunately dulled his senses, making him more compliant, and harder to throw her off a second time.
She had made him look like those old pure-blooded wizards that just reeked of money. Not unlike Malfoy Snr. Long curly hair tied at the nape of his neck. Clean shaven, with horrid glasses, That again spoke of money. Harry loathed to think what his Gringots vault would look like, once she'd had her way with it.
Ginny pulled away slightly, staring at him like she couldn’t hardly believe, what she could see, feel and smell.
“Montey! What do you think you’re doing?” Soren, the warden of Azkaban boomed. Harry could see through his dirty hair from his place on the wall. The stick thin man was making his way towards them. His brown greasy curls slicked back on his skeletal head. Yet his beard was growing wild.
"No. not leverage, insurance she called it. She kept saying that word. I didn't know what she meant until I held that innocent little girl in my arms. She couldn't help the way she was made. I knew then she would come for her. I tried to stay awake. Fuck! I tried to stay awake. Spend as much time as I could with her."
A loud crash of thunder woke Harry up later that night, actual drops of rain falling through his small window. With a yawn he placed a hand on his chest to cradle his daughters small head. But it want there. With a jolt his eyes shot open as he sat upright, looking at his empty bed.
Harry rubbed at his head. His ears ringing. “No! No! Your not! I’m Harry Potter!” His voice nasily and high pitched. He clasped a hand to his throat in confusion.
It was as Draco had predicted. The war ended not with a battle, but with diplomacy. Bones was gone. Sent to Azkaban for treason to the ministry and orchestration of war. The evidence against her inestimable. She was to receive the kiss by end of week. The last of Azkaban prisoners to receive it till Hermione had the dementors disbanded, and sent to a sanctuary specially designed for them.
He wasn’t thinking as he raced through the tent to Draco’s potion cabinet, instead of just summing them to his side, he wasn’t think because Draco was laying on their bed with Half his right arm hexed off.
"Are you deaf? You've got a visitor. Now, hurry the fuck up, and put your hands on the wall." He boomed. loosing what little temper he had.
"Then how? How! Could you not tell me, that they were taking her. How?" Harry Cracked. Emotion finally showing on his face.
The daily Azkaban routine got a little more bearable, it didn't fix the ache in him entirely. But hey he wasn't getting up out of spite anymore. conversing with each other, at dinner sharing facts about each other, the one Harry could share, what with the curse. It helped him bit by bit each day.
Tonight however was different. Along with his insomnia he felt the intense need to vomit. So he was up and to the loo, heaving his guts up.
Malfoys eyes bulged. He'd seen a woman's water break before, at one of his parents gala's, His father had looked on in disdain as the witch had dirtied his ballroom floor, while his mother had rushed to her aid. She had always had a fondness for babies. Having not gone to help his mother, the birthing bed being no place for a man, as his mother said, he had little to no clue, on how to help potter.
Despite Dawlish closing statement, Harry assumed it was meant to sooth him, it actually had the opposite effect.
"Is that so? Well. Then. Right this way, Mr. Potter. Let us show you to our finest cell." Rick gestured with a wave of his hand. As Wools pushed him into the other guards hands. and taken into the depths of Azkaban.
Ron appeared beside them. A moment later slapping Pansy on the back like everything was normal. Though his face was pained he soldiered on taking Hermiones hand in his own.
They were the ones Harry waited for. It took a month in this fashion before Harry couldn't stay mad at Malfoy anymore. And if he was truly honest he never was. Malfoy was there so he could direct his anger at him. It's what he'd done at school, when the real person he was angry with was himself.
After that. When the guards would come in the night. Not every night or even week. Harry would throw the apple. And Malfoy would catch it, And Harry would stay silent, until he was ready to talk.
He didn't push though. Malfoy that is. He didn't speak again until the lunch slop popped in, spouting another random fact. That harry, reluctantly found quite interesting.
Pansy had left in his body, where he didn’t know. Probably to take his identity and take over his life. He wondered if he cared.
When he was taken back to his cell, one word played over and over in his mind, As Draco attempted to get him to speak. Not until the morning after, when their breakfast slop popped! into being did Harry speak.
James grin grew. ‘Thanks dad. Mum and gran weren’t receptive to the idea. Said I was wasting my potential.’ He scoffed.
“Potter?” Parkinson replied. Looking wary. Her pug nose still looking down on him as if she was better. How she pulled of entitled, scared and oddly excited, baffled Harry.
There had been many changes to the city, in the years he had been gone. New shops lined walkways. Old shops had disappeared, strange technology advertised in window displays.
Harry almost choked, head whipping over to face the blond, watching in fascination as he reblat his hair.
So naturally Harry contained his mirth at seeing Draco splash a scooping of beans on his plate with a scowl. A scowl that did not go with his hair net that held a French braid.
“What are you doing!” He panicked. Then his world went black. A sensation not unlike a port key making him feel like he was hurdling through time.
"NEVER! Call me that again. You lost the right to ever even speak to me again, when you watched them take my daughter. AND DID NOTHING!"
But now here Ron stood with the news it was over. Hermione had taken the ministers seat and was now minister of magic
“Harry. Darling! It’s been to long.” Harry turned, to face himself. With an uncharacteristic grin, his voice said. “How I’ve missed that face.”
"You wouldn't." He spat, the look she gave him, said otherwise. "Of course you would. What have you done to her."
He then proceeded to tell his school nemesis all that transpired after the battle. Excluding some parts. Not even he wanted to remember that.
The moonless night turning the stained glass windows dark. Ginny had insisted on them when the two of them had begun the gargantuan mission of  turning Grimuald into something even close to liveable.
owners. A large pile appears in front of Harry, and those he sat with. Harry looked over at Draco just in time to see him place a neat pile of envelopes inside his neatly pressed uniform, close to his heart.
Rising from his knees he guided a pliant potter over to the arm of the lounge, turning him around so his naked arse was on show and limp member between his legs, Draco’s member twitched in anticipation at the sight, as he freed it from the confines of his pants.
Harry didn’t know why he made them dinner, maybe for the illusion of normalcy but the two sat at the table staring at nothing as their food sat before them growing cold, Harry found himself rising from the table and heading the the lounge and setting it up for Draco to sleep on. Before making his way to his room and closing the divider.
The Grifyndor side of him felt the need to go towards the ever growing sounds of what was most definitely a couple, in the throws of, he didn’t want to know what. The other rational side of him told him to stop trying to ruin whoever was having a wonderful snog, and to go inside and fix things with his wife so he might have that with her again.
‘Oh Harry. You do so know how I hate it, when you ignore me in favour of your maps.’ Draco smirked as he towers over a bound Harry, that lay spread eagle over his map table.
“They would if I told them.” He mumbled in reply. “Darling the ministry is corrupt and governed by a bunch of imbecilic old men. Who will see to it that all those linked to the dark lord are ak’d where they stand. Or chuck us Azkaban with the key to our cells tied to a rock and dropped to the middle of the sea. I for one do not intend to live my life behind bars!” She explained.
"They ent an'ther un en." She groans. Her speech coming out slurred and undefinable, through the witches missing teeth. "an other 'ure blud en?"
The first one he would be celebrating with his family in way to long. So Harry had begun shopping in the muggle world. Where he would be free to take his time, without the added annoyance of every witch and wizard gawking and the man who lived.
"For the thousandth time Malfoy! I'm not Pansy! How many times do I need to tell you, before you get it through that thick pureblooded head of yours." Harry groans in frustration, flushing the loo as he does so.
Many lives were lost that day. More so if Harry hadn't sensed the oncoming wave of bombadas, that rained down. He’d cast the strongest protago charm ever recorded, and if not for his quick work Harry had no doubt that he and those in the area of diagon he was in that day would not have survived.
His mind felt like it was short circuiting his head bowed so as to release the strain on his neck. He felt robes being pushed to the side and he kicked out at her, as she roamed her hands over a body that was once hers.
‘I’m doing this, because of what we just went through. We now have a chance to turn the table of this war. There wont be diplomacy till the corrupt are gone we have the means to collect information under the radar. Trust me Draco. It’s the only way.’ Harry pleaded.
He did know. But there was one thing she did have a right to know. Something he couldn’t hide from her.
‘Look dad, I don’t mean to be rude or anything. But. You haven’t really got any business coming back after three years, and have any say on how we are living. Because up until an hour ago we though you were dead!’ James scolded.
"Well, I Can't exactly have a repartee While you were..incapacitated. Shall we say." She explained. Popping herself down onto the moth eaten chair across from him, with a cocky air.
Looking up at her in disdain. “You won’t get away with this. My friends will figure out what you’ve done.” He stated with conviction.
Every surface held a memory, even the smell brought all those moments he was trying to suppress, over him like an out of control fiendfire.
"I can't say the same for yours." Harry replied tersely. Taking stock of the amount of changes Parkinson had made to his appearance.
Harry turned to face the grandfather clock which had just chimed 11pm, he used to stay up longer than this, but by now he and Draco would be pitching the tent.
“I don’t know.” He whispered back, eyes downcast. Not allowing himself to hope. Though wishing he could take Draco’s hand in his own. Draco had the same idea. Pushing his luck and trailing his thumb, down Harry’s cheek. Harry relished in the quick touch. Before Rick, smashed down his bat on Draco hand. Harry thought he heard a crunch, before Draco pulled his hand back, cradling it to his chest.
‘Well. Um. It only happened last night, well... early this morning I should say. See. Um. See......’
Harry found himself beneath Draco’s blood stained body, the two frotting feverishly against one another. It wasn’t enough though.
‘I..ugh....know...I....fucking....love...it....when..you...make them talk.’ Draco gasped. Grasping Harry’s hands to make them go faster.
“IM HARRY POTTER!!!” He screamed, as they disaperatted from Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and wizardry.
"Why come at all? It's been..." How long had it been? He just assumed the days but in actuality he had no clue. "Why, now?"
‘Oh, um well. Ive been helping out at the joke shop while uncle Ron’s been gone. And well, I want to take it over for uncle George he’s ready to retire. Mind, that probably wont happen for years yet. But he knows that Fred II and Rox are more into flying then the shop, so that’s, well that’s my plan.’ He finished, shooting Harry an uncertain smile.
Draco felt his throat close up and his head shake, trying to physically remove the image from his mind.
"Just do it Potter." He barked. Getting off his shity bed, and over to the bars. Surprisingly, he did as he was told without question.
"I'm terrified of pigeons." Harry replied. Malfoy lifted his head of the floor in astonishment. Harry expected him to make a big deal, but as was becoming habit, he surprised him.
‘So..’ Ginny broke the silence. ‘How does this work?’ She wondered, leaning forward on the couch they shared.
"Up. or down?" Tristyn asked when they clambered into an elevator of some sort, though from what Harry could see there was no buttons.
"She's a crazy pint. And war changes people. often times not for the better. If you tried to look for your friend in her now. I doubt you would find her."
"It's me, or rather, you. That I've done done something to. A simple variation of notice me not charm. My father invented." She said with a bragging air. "You see he was quite apt at inventing new spells, and modifying old ones. A skill he passed on to me, but enough of that. The spell is what you want to know about. And this one makes those under its thrall, see what the recipient wants them to see. causing them to miss whats right under there noses. And that dear Potter. Is why your tedious little friends have not come to save you." She said with a triumphant grin.
Wools laughed. "Oh. Haven't you heard Rick. This one here ain't no death eater. It's Harry Potter. " He laughed, in that feminine way of his.
While visiting the Weasley’s he found that he felt odd like a stranger peering in at a new unit that had been changed and reformed to excluded him. Not directly of course, but it didn’t discount how he felt.
Rick, placed the cuffs on him, pushing him out the cell, slamming the bars behind him. Waking the prisoner, across from him, as he did so. The blond bolting upright in his bed, before facing them.
So like often happens when he doesn’t know how to react. His mouth ran away from him, speaking before his heart could catch up.
Draco, and Luna he assumed. She was the only one he could think of who saw things for what they really were. Not what they looked like. That's not what stumped him though.
They lined the hall from left to right. each one they passed, filled with a pathetic looking witch or wizard. Caked in blood and dirt. Some talking to themselves others sleeping, but all looking half mad and one step away from death.
Though, it seemed time to break the news to him, on his tumor as he, oft called the rounded swell of Pansy's child.
Harry threw up, into the filthy loo. That rested in the top right hand corner of his cell. His cell!! In Azkaban!!! A place that didn't seem to be agreeing with him. Though.. He doubted it agreed with anyone.
Clutching each other close the two spent the rest of what was rest of the night crying in each others arms till exhaustion overcame them.
A glint lit up Draco’s eyes as he took the proffered hand. ‘I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks.’ He smirked.
Draco had gotten distracted during their mission, and the target had turned her wand on herself after hexing Draco. That happened if the enemy found themselves about to be tutored for questions. They ended it before the enemy could even try.
Ron laughed, hitting his head lightly. ‘No, you great tit. No come on mum will have my head if I don’t help with the dishes.’
"You need to go to medi." He pointed at his hand. Draco looked down at it and shrugged. A filthy habit, he called it. one he had picked up from Harry. "I've had worse." He replied.
Harry was glad his son had a life. He’d fought for exactly that. So why shouldn’t his son reap the benefits of his sacrifice.
I run the Daily Prophet for merlins sake. I can tell when someone is hiding something from me. And Harry..... he’s hiding something.’
“Teaching.” Was Ricks reply. Still pressing Harry’s face into the wall. Soren, pulled out his wand, placing it at Ricks neck. Making the fat fuck, who never stopped reminding him of Dudley, to step back. Arms up in surrender. Finally allowing Harry to breath properly, coughing up the blood, that had been filling his mouth.
“Arms on the wall. You know the drill.” Rick ordered, upon entry. Harry turned without a fight, knowing what he would receive if he didn’t comply. Though he contemplated it, just to prolong seeing his visitor.
The early hours of the morning while the sun still slept, found Harry sitting in a steel tub that resided in his tent.
‘I have to agree with Malfoy. This sounds a bit barmy mate. Treasonous even, and need I remind you that Hermione is on the gamot. You know, my wife.’ Ron exclaimed, hands thrown wide. ‘Just how do you plan on executing this plan of yours.’
Naked the began to kiss only stopping to come up for air. In no time Draco had Harry on his back, Harry relinquishing all control for one last time.
‘You never lost him.’ He lied. Making his way up the steps, embracing her. And planting a kiss on her cheek.
The most prominent. The snow covered tent that sat before him. Well the biggest problem, besides that fact that the two had been apart for three years, presumed died for one.
he felt her lean down even closer to his face, "Tell me how does it feel rotting away in here. While I live the life you should be living." Her breath blowing into his ear.
"I don't know?" Harry panted. "Distract me. Tell me what to do!" He grunted moving over to his bed, resting his outstretched arms against it edge, doubling over as the pain came, then subsided, before returning after a minute or two.
‘I just don’t know what to do Luna!’ Harry heard Ginny attempt to whisper. ‘He sleeps out there most night’s. What am I saying, it’s every night. And he wont even let me anywhere near that tent of his. The last time I tried, he had a fit.’
‘Good. I’ll set everything in order for both of your returns. You have one night Harry. That’s all I’m giving you.’ Grabbing his jacket he pulled out his wand. ‘One night.’ He repeated.
It was the woman’s turn to laugh now. “Like we would be foolish enough all death eaters were given An antidote to the serums power by Severus Snape. It was one of the ways they infiltrated the ministry. So if you want to prove yourself tell us something only Weasley and Granger would know about.” She ordered.
"What luck? I could wax poetic about the life I've had If I could. But my Imposter stole my ability to do that. Wasn't that lucky!"
"Yeah. I did that to, after it happened. That was the first time, I wished that Voldemort had actually killed me. But. I thought the same way you are now. I'm Harry Potter. Voldemort was died, I wasn't, though I thought I would be. My Parents sacrificed their lives for me, so many countless others, had lost their lives. For me. I couldn't just, give up. But then I got thrown into Azkaban, and a month ago discovered that the Bitch who raped me, made sure I would never forget it. Made sure that she had leverage over me." He paused another of those humorless laughs escaping him.
The two had passed the time catching up on each other’s lives. James showing his dad the new inventions he’d created for the joke shop. Harry knew his son was gifted but to see it channeled into something constructive. Brought him more joy then he could possibly know.
‘Why start now then.’ Harry murmured into his shoulder. Silence encompasses them. ‘It’s best we don’t.’ Harry said lamely.
Malfoy seemed to be contemplating his next words carefully, as he threw his hair up into a messy bun, wisps of silver blond framing his handsome features. Harry liked when he put his hair up like that.
"Remember.." Harry tried to say, before the spell rendered him mute. He knew that Draco would know what he was about to say. He always knew.
‘An old friend. From the war. He wants to meet up in two weeks.’ He supplied. Writing the time and date onto the fridge calendar, and sending off his reply.
From his point of view she seemed to be anxious and determined, looking behind her as if to see if she was being followed. Though she also looked like the war hadn’t touched her. Her robes pristine. She had been locked in the dungeons.
It was after one particularly gut wrenching fit, as Harry held him, the man high on pain relievers that Draco asked the forbidden question they had been avoiding for near on a year.
The guard walked them through halls, past rooms Harry had no hope of remembering. Harrys, hairs started to raise, when he noticed them walking past, the visitors chambers. Where he saw husbands talking to disappointed wives, parents talking to disappointing children. It looked a strange sight to an outsider. Both joy and bone crushing despair. Harry took one last look, at the saddening sight of a broken family, before they were on the move again
Malfoy startled at his words. He didn't like where this was going, nor did he like to put into words what happened to him, nearly every month.
Harry dared not hope. As he looked upon the gamonts dower faces. "Due to the disbanding and eradication, of the dementors. The accused will not. Be receiving the kiss."
Subconsciously he heard a rustle but his body refused to see what it was, continuing to stare at the blooms of steam. The water sloshed around him and the feeling of a skin on his back greeted him.
With a grunt Draco came just after Harry pulling out only once Harry ha milked every last drop. Before placing the man back on his feet.
"Yeah." Was his simple reply, before he got lost in his daughter. Maybe? Maybe he would be okay if he had her.
"What..What do you mean.. she's gone." He fretted getting up from his bed to the bars, startled at the lack of pain that should have accompanied such an abrupt movement. The sensitivity in his breast remained though. He rubbed at the still naked appendages stunned to find them leaking.
Some times Harry forgot that there was more then just him and Malfoy. Held up in the dank cold cells of Azkaban.
‘Lucius.’ Was his simple reply. Rons eyes widened. ‘So this is all some sick form of revenge?’ He whispered back.
Of course that wasn't to be. That night, as a storm raged and the guards and medi-witch came to his cell, the medi-Witch tended to the babe as Harry slept on the exhaustion of birth wiping him of his energy. The medi moved on to Harry healing the afterbirth and what would normally follow in the months after.
The guard remained silent. simply moving deeper into the dark heart of Azkaban. Soon coming to a halt, in front of a peeling black door. It opened and he was forcefully pushed in. The door slamming behind him, Harry turning to face the door when he heard the distinct sound of a locking charm being placed.
His kids were ecstatic to have him home, and they seemed to be one of the few things that gave him any joy of late, but they were grown now. They didn’t need their dad much anymore. They had learned to live without him.
‘And then I took over the prophet and merged it with the quibbler. Luna well lets just say she copes with the loss in a different way.’
With a flourish of the crones wand, that looked more like a twig, then an actual wand. Papers were filled out and a prick of blood was taken from Harry. Before being dropped on the box Pansy wand now resided in, for the next fifteen years. Glowing then seamlessly ceiling shut.
He doubted she knew he was there. Having told her he would be out this afternoon to visit Kingsley about getting his old job back. Half way to the visitors entrance he found himself apperating home. He didn’t want to fight anymore. He’d done enough of that already.
The pain becoming sort of numb as the bodies rocked back and forth in a repetitive motion. Grazing his cheek rapid pace as it was trapped between a the wall.
‘He’s not a death eater!’ Harry whispered angrily, so as not to alert those arriving in the mess for their secondary debriefing.
“Then where would we be.” Harry quipped. “Come.” He repeated. And again he was on his way to the private unguarded room that only he was privy to.
Looking down Harry realised he to was naked as the day he was born. Summing his robe, he followed Ron into the dining area.
‘I don’t know Ron. I keep fucking up. Everything I’ve done since coming back, has just been one big fuck up.’ He lamented, head in his hands.
With another sigh, Draco got up from his bed, to do his daily exercises, Harry remaining stoic on his mattress. Despite Potters words. When the dinner popped into appearance.
He wandered around aimlessly a few hours more, till he couldn’t bare to be away from his children one second more.
Not wanting to spend anymore time there he left. Making his way to the great hall. The night had fallen again, he’d spent nearly the whole day.....
In the years following Hogwarts, Maps had become something of a hobby to him. The Marunders map sparking this new passion of his.
He began to scream for help as his underwear was ripped off. “NO! STOP! HELP! HELP HERMIONE! RON! SOMEONE! HELP ME! HELP ME!” Tears of frustration and fear trailed down his face, as his pleas went unanswered.
‘I thought you were dead! When I heard where we were going and the platoon that...’ he pulled back getting a good look at Harry, before hugging him again. ‘Thank Merlin your alive.’
"We, the wizard gamont. Find you guilty, of the following war crime. Attempting to hand over the hero of the wizarding world, Harry Potter. And have sentenced you, to the kiss." Acting minister for magic kingsley Shacklebolt Announced to the chorus of enthusiastic cheers.
Upon entry, Harry almost slipped on the black rocks that surrounded the building, as the surly auror lead them straight through the stones and into cramped entryway. Harry was loath to discover that the inside was no warmer then the winds that whipped outside. A skeletal woman with patches of missing hair sneered at them as they approached the lone desk that sat in the far right corner of the small room.
‘Come on Potter. Ive known for quite some time. This war is because of me. We make quite the pair don’t we Potter. They should call us some pithy name, like....The war starters, or some such rot.’ He laughed weakly, humourlessly. ‘Yes, Potter. Looks like you have some competition for undesirable no.1’
The two stayed staring at each other, till Harry shoved the three repairing potions down Malfoy's throat. Removing the bonds around his arm
‘I wasn’t joking. That horrid tattoo would be gone and everyone would quite staring at it.’ He stated, eyes following Harry.
Harry shouldn’t have been so surprised the Malfoy knew he had done exactly that. The two of them had both been through a lot since the War started two years ago
Malfoy flushed in what Harry knew to be embarrassment. "Oh, Shut your trap, Potter." He whined. "Its not those womanly issues again is it?"
When the sun rose into the sky, tell the world it was time for a new day, the two went about there morning routine as usual. Packing the tent away for the last time.
leaning on the table in mock concern, she coked her head in confusion. "I thought you'd want to know darling. Aren't you proud?”
‘Potter.’ Harry glared at him in obvious annoyance. ‘Take a break. Eat something. You know I wont ask again.’
‘But. Your right. I don’t have the right to tell any of you how to live your lives. So why don’t you tell me about yours.’
The battle had ended and the Aurors, had descended, rounding up those who hadn’t fled. The ones that knew, the fight was over.
Draco let out another whimper in return. As Harry continued rinsing the wound, applying alcohol before another sanitising potion.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Spectacular Potter. Most of us can't sleep at night, in this hell hole." There was a chorus of groans from the other prisoners at the statement.
Harry had complete faith in Draco no matter the outcome of today, Harry just knew Draco could get them out of this, beside's Herm.... Well he was the smartest person he knew. He was also the only person Harry trusted. But He also knew that Draco knew all this. It wasn't the plan Draco had doubts over.
Greenwitch opened his with relish, the sender written on the envelope caught Harry’s attention. Looking around the mess wondering why Donaldson would send a letter when he was in their platoon.
He hasn’t seen his wife in 3 years, and they hadn’t spoken for one. What did one do when reconnecting with ones wife? Probably stoped referring to themselves as one. He thought.
Which is how he found himself in an office that could rival Umbridge for worst decorated office in history.
Turning over to get a glimpse of that freckled face. He used to know everything about that face. But like most everything since he left, it was subject to change.
Draco smiled back, sitting on the floor as he rested against the bars. Holding his hand close to him. It was bruised now. Purple and blue, against the pale ghost white of his skin.
"In case it has escaped your notice. We a both in locked cells! In Azkaban! Not exactly the dream local for raising a baby." He scoffed.
He let out another scream of anguish. "That was an open and shut case. Three years ago! I've been a model inmate since then. Zero infractions on my prison record. And she testified in my defense. I don't believe that you have nothing to do with this."
In that mundane endless cycle Harry had going, Malfoy had his own. Every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He would try to get Harry to speak. Nothing he said worked though. It often went through one ear and out the other. Drowning out his constant nattering had become a new skill Harry had perfected. Until one day, Malfoy changed the game.
Rick's face looked thunderous. "Why you little bitch! I'll teach you to make fool of me." he raised his bat, ready to slam it down on Harry's face. Harry flinch getting ready for impact, but mid swing the bat was caught by Tristyn.
The weight of Pansy pressing his body onto his new form made him stop cold. The warm breath on his ear making him shiver in fear. He’d faced Voldemort, Bellatrix, Fenir. Dragons! But Harry had never felt so helpless or terrified then when the sound of his own voice breathed in his ear. “No one can hear you scream Potter!”
With his head thrown back, so all Draco could see was his bearded neck bobbing, Harry came and Draco swallowed down every salty drop.
"you mean to tell me." He began calmly, "That you watched. As the guards took my daughter. And did nothing?"
"What?" Harry shrugged back, discarding the garb completely. There was a cool air, which gave him goosebumps, making his brown nipples perk. It was down right sunny compared to most days on the rock of misery though.
His eyes looked up in an instant. Harry knew that voice. he could be in a crowded room and still know that voice. Because there, across the small expanse of hall. In all his pureblooded pratiness. A former shell of himself was:
"I don't know why you spend money on those whores. when you've got your pick of the prisoners." Rick, took hold of Harry arm leading him over to the shower, and chaining him to the wall. with the rusty shackles that lay there. Harry felt as if he was going to hyperventilate. chained to a wall naked, with a  man who just admitted to raping the prisoners. He was amazed he was still standing.
Throwing out his food while people weren’t looking, was an anxious habit Harry had picked up after the battle of Hogwarts. Harry tried to stop but he’d never quite shaken it, the years with the Dursley’s not helping much either. It was only a matter of time before Draco badgered him about it.
The two rudely showed him what to do. Harry moving where he was told, and turning when asked. Before the plank was snatched off him and they were on the move again.
On the groggy trip to the spare he passed James open room, noting it was empty. His son spending most evenings at the flat above WWW or at Teddy’s.
"Well. It's not Lily if thats what you thought. As if I would name her after a mudblood. No, even though she's just a half blood, I thought to give her a pure name. Though, your do gooder friends sure tried to get me to change it."
Hardening his resolve, he turned the squeaky tap, the water trickled out pathetically. Cupping his hands under it he took a swig. Swirling it around his mouth before spitting it out, before repeating the process, drinking it this time though. It wasn't so bad.
‘We are.....ugh..that much....closer to ending this...Agghhhhh!’ Harry filling himself with Draco that much more.
His double laughed again mockingly. “No. Darling I think you’ll find that your not.” And with a flourish of Harry’s wand his double transfigured a piece of rubble into an intricate mirror. Letting it float in front of his face.
Harry couldn’t help but feel like, if only he’d defeated Voldemort sooner, there would be fewer loses. Would Fred still be alive? Remus? Tonks?
The young boy couldn’t have been more than twelve his face screwed up in pain, as she tended to the stump that was his left leg. Harry had no doubt that skelegrow wouldn’t heal it.
Banging on the bars, making them vibrate with his bat. He never went anywhere without it. Harry hatted that fucking bat. He was just lucky he wasn’t the one who caught his attention.
"We'll take it from here Wools." Huh? So that's his name. "I'm sure she wont be the last death eater scum, you'll be bringing us today." the guard with a bat, and.. was that blood? on his boots. Joked.
‘Harry.’ She whispered. ‘You don’t have to do this anymore. The war is over, you don’t have to keep running.’
Harry swore. Rattling the bars of his cell. Malfoy watching him from across the way, having a break down.
‘Yes. But that is only due to the fact a certain scar head has been M.I.A since our debriefing, and has missed dinner.’ He drawled. ‘Here.’
Harry, watched as the water dropped from the cracked ceiling. One after the other, each little drop.
"Are you telling me that Pansy made you gay? That bad was she." Harry tried to joke. But bile began to rise in his throat, at the thought of Parkinson sleeping with anyone after. Well after what...
‘Prat!’ Harry smiled, before it slowly slipped of his face. Draco’s falling with it. ‘I have a bad feeling about tomorrow Malfoy. I cant explain it, my instincts tell me that something is wrong, and they have never let me down before.’
With determination and that Gryffindor fire that still burned. No matter how low the flames got. He stared her down. "I will one day. And it will make killing voldemort look like child's play."
With a wandless spell cast Harry’s way, he was stretched and ready for him. A well placed thrust and he was inside the brunet, Draco’s left hand wrapped around his neck as he panted beautifuly with each new thrust.
"Oh. Potter. you know that's not how these meetings of ours go." she laughed. "It amuses me, you think you can get out of this so easily."
He just. He looks so much like his dad. And when him and Albus were together. Well its like it could have been them. Him, and Draco.
The sound of climax. And a heat pouring into his new appendage. Continuing to rock long after it had finished.
“Potter!” He spat mockingly. Harry glared in reply. “You’ve got a visitor.” Harry’s heart stopped. He only ever had one visitor. “Get your skinny ass up, before I make you.” He bellowed. Opening the cell with his thumb on the lock. The guards weren’t allowed wands in the cells, though that didn’t stop them sometimes.
With that, Harry got into bed, drawing the dirty sheets over his naked form. Back to Malfoy and body aching for the child that was taken from him, not twelve hours after her birth.
"Better?" His face smirked back at him. Harry scowled, before hesitantly making his way to one of the rickety upholstered chairs in the room, he found himself having difficulty standing to long these days.
"However." Kingsley began again. "We can not allow the accused crimes to go unpunished." A round of 'hear, hear' was heard. "Pansy Parkinson. You, are sentenced. To life! In Azkaban. Pending a retrial for early release, if warranted. In Fifteen years."
He cleaned him slowly and gently glad that what little of his mind he did have thought to perform a staisis on the tub before he got in.
"Mad. Pint, has been screaming herself hoarse in the holding cells. Telling everyone shes Potter. I Recon she wont last a month in here."
With a bemused chuckle Harry reluctantly grabbed his plate and headed over to the worn coach that stood in the corner of his tent. With a humph they two sat in comfortable silence as Harry ate. Draco often did this with him, knowing if left on his own he would likely throw out his food.
‘We. got. info.’ Harry panted, as he rode himself up and down Draco’s cock. His nails scratching into Draco’s skin for purchase.
Harry avoided looking, his attention captured by a falling fleck of paint, drifting softly to the floor. The hand on his stomach, and the sound of his voice talking to it, a mumbled sound that was just out of reach. There went another fleck.
For once he actually listened to him and kept his mouth shut, Harry doubted that there wouldn't be repercussions for his outburst though.
After that all he remembered were flash’s of looking down on himself like it wasn’t happening to him but someone else.
He was home now with family. The war was over. That part of his life. His life with Draco. Was over.
Malfoy shut his mouth. And harry pushed through the pain for another ten minutes before a voice piped up from the shadows.
Harry had stopped eating. The only timed he would stir from his bed, was when he felt the urge to drink or use the loo.
So Harry did as Malfoy asked. Playing with his apple for about half an hour, throwing it up in the air, and catching it, as he lay on his bed. Staring up at the cracked ceiling as he did so. It had started to rain again. So as it often did, the ceiling began to leak.
He was shoved again when he denied, giving an answer, to the intelligible question. The two of them stared him down before the witch, reiterated in disdain "Name!"
‘This morning Potter, pay attention. I was at Dawlish tent when I heard a row coming from inside, so naturally I listened’
"Pigeons? Really?" was his reply. "Peacocks? Really?" was Harry's. And just like that. It was as if they had never stopped speaking.
Draco however had no such qualms, releasing himself from his grasp, stepping out on the tub dick hard and summing a towel, which soon found itself around his waist. Another towel flew into his hands, standing in front of harry he spread out the towel for him to climb into.
"Calm your Threastels Potter. I Haven't done anything....To them at least." She smirked. Harry cocked his head in concern and confusion. "Potter, that look relay does nothing for my face. You'll give me wrinkles." she motioned at his forehead.
‘Malfoy. I want you to do something for me on this mission. And I need you not to ask me why.’ He requested leaving no room for argument.
It was only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago! That he was living in here, with Draco. Fucking on any available surface they could get to the fastest.
Harry shot Malfoy a hesitant look, doing what the man said. Harry was unsure if he should trust the man, but if he helped him through this then what would be the harm.
‘That’s what I thought solider. And though I have no reason to tell you such information. And despite what you may think. I have no say on where we are stationed or sent. Though I have a small amount of sway, my orders come from the gamot. And they have ordered this platoon use its full force for this operation. I hope that puts your mind, or as Malfoy puts it, your gut. At ease. Now take your leave mister Potter.’ With a nod that said we’re done here, Dawlish turned his attention back to his papers.
He could deal with any fall out later. For now the place he called home for almost three years was there beckoning him to enter.
In a flash Harry had summoned his fathers cloak, knocking himself and Malfoy to the ground and pulling the cloak over them. Just in time, as the protection charms fell. The rain came crashing down around them. And the enemy attacked.
That isn’t me he wanted to scream. why wasn’t he? He was t going to let her just get away with it. He was about to march over. when his hands were suddenly bound behind his back.
When asked later neither man could tell who made the first move, but it was fast and oh so heated, the rest of their cloths soon found their way to the floor.
“WHAT THE FUCK!” He screamed, crawling backwards away from his double. “Who are you?” He splutterd till he hit the underside of a fallen table.
He shook his head and headed back onto his lumpy ‘mattress’, laying down and staring at the ceiling, tracing the crack that split through it, with his eyes.
‘Yeah, but let’s catch up. I’ll send you an owl.’ Turning to leave, before doubling back. ‘Take care of yourself Potter.’ He smiles, leaving Harry to his thoughts on the muggle streets of London.
‘What’s the problem Potter.’ Draco said, unbraiding his silver white hair, with long nimble fingers.
Their coupling was rough and frenzied, with absolutely no finesse. Draco having to find Harry’s entrance once or twice in his impatience. But fuck it if it wasn’t the best sex they’d had.
Why. Why was he always so difficult. A traitorous little voice, inside his head. Told him, he had done the same thing about Pansy. So why was it so odd for Malfoy to want to forget.
"Ame n wan." The Scary old witch ordered. Harry looked at her in confusion. "What?" he asked, dumbfounded as to what she'd said.
He wasn’t prepared for the onslaught of memories that assaulted him from the mere sight that greeted him.
"It's not stealing if your her mother." She smirked up at him. "Or should I say father? Well she likes to call me daddy, It was her first word you know." Her smirk widened.
"They wont. Not with her on the gammot. She wont let you leave." He reassured. Absentmindedly folding and unfolding his daughters prefect letter.
A condescending laughed boomed through the room. Harry hated that his voice could sound that way. "Perdition! You've been spending to much time with Draco."
He was just about to enter his old office when the sound of the floo flaring to life, filled his ears. Heals sounded on them hardwood floors, and the clinking of glasses being moved about drew Harry down the stairs.
Malfoy actually laughed. A rare sound in the cells of Azkaban. It made Harry smile. "No potter. I do not think they have gotten bigger. They will unfortunately be seared into my brain for all eternity. But they have not gotten bigger." He chuckled.
‘Take care Harry.’ He said, on his way out, pausing at the exit to turn back eyes locked on Harrys. ‘Oh an Harry. When the war ends. This thing you’ve got going with Malfoy, it ends to.’ Brooking no room for argument.
Still It came as a surprise. Parkinson had mentioned something about a new Minister, Harry doubted they weren’t under her thumb.
‘How do you expect me to stay quite when my best mates alive.’ Ron implored, finally releasing harry from his Bear hold.
Harry stared at the stump that was Malfoys right arm, pressing into the bloody area a little to hard.
Upon entering the spare, he jumped right into bed, pillow clutched tight to his chest, his eyes closing instantly upon impact. That is until they immediately opened looking up at the uninteresting ceiling.
Looking down at his... Well, Parkinson's boob's. They were always itchy, and aching. Usually he didn't pay them any mind. Which in hind site was kind of odd. But today, he thought they looked, well. Bigger.
Entering the kitchen he found Ginny. Her back to him as she searched through the fridge. Pulling out a bottle of elf wine.
‘You already know everything about our relationship because of unauthorised biographies and what witch weekly has said about it..’ Harry snapped.
looking down at his larger (he swore.) Breasts, then back up at Malfoy in confusion. Why was he being so... Well, chivalrous?
“That’s all well and good Potter! But I wanted you dead.” She admitted. Chilling Harry to the bone. “I seriously doubt that the Aurors or the ministry will see it your way. Darling!” She said closing the space between them.
‘It’s usually meant to be moving.’ Harry snickered. Waving his hand, and casting a slight confunduss on the muggles below, as he tuned it on.
Thirty minutes later, harry found himself outside under the glow of the stars. Running away from his wife, and Hermione. And basically anyone who thought it was a brilliant idea to talk about his and Ginny’s failing marriage.
He turned to find two Aurors, red robes fanning out behind them. One had a scar across his face and the other had her wand pointed at him.
Ron helped rid the room of the smell, turning on the shower and washing, the remnants of Harry’s stomach down the drain.
Harry was beginning to wonder the same thing. He’d actually been throwing up for the last month. It was like a nice little cherry on the shit show his life had become.
Harry scowled, "Have I been sent to an alternate reality where Draco Malfoy. Has lost all his pureblooded wit and inelegance. Or are you being purposefully, idiotic."
Across the way, Harry was resting on the grimy wall, back to Malfoy, hand still clutched on his stomach, panting hard.
Harry was indeed very much alone. Planning to wallow in his hotel room with his racing thoughts. But Harry was never one to stay still for long, so he took himself for a stroll around muggle London.
Harry cut him off with a scathing glare. "In case it has escaped your notice im not exactly in my body. Now am I!"
A ringing permeated the awkward silence, Donaldson phone, going off. He gave a quick apology to Harry before answering it.
‘Two more targets and you will have your answer. The Norwegians were jut pawns in her game, but from what I’ve gathered..’ Harry paused, looking over his shoulder the sound of the water running having stoped.
Harry rolled his eyes at the stupid question. "That's. What I’ve been trying to tell you! After the battle..."
‘Do I really look that different? I can shave the beard if that helps. I didn’t have one the last time you saw me.’
Though just because, Harry wasn't speaking to Malfoy didn't mean that the ponce wasn't trying to speak to him.
And in the two Years he had been working at Azkaban, Draco had made it his mission to get ride of him. Not in the way in which he would spend the rest on his days on this piece of shit rock. But just in a way in which he could no longer flirt with Potter.
“Looks like it’s time for another trip to medi. Aren’t you lucky.” He sneered. Taking Harry’s arm once they passed the entry gate of their wing of Azkaban. “Saved yourself, what happened last time.” Rick goaded.
Probably sensing he wouldn’t get a rise out of Harry that way, he moved on to who he knew would get under Harry’s skin.
‘Your still up.’ Harry pointed out, tapping his wand on the map in front of him, lighting up all the hidden areas the battlefield held.
Once he was clean Harry, turned around to return the favour. He gently undid Draco’s braid, trying not to get his fingers caught in the dried blood and he brushed his hands though the stained strands and pouring the jug over him.
"Fine! The Ministry has reviewed your bail." A silence stretched. "They have refused you bail." she grinned. turning his features into an ugly smirk.
What was he hearing, Draco thought. This was Harry Potter he didn't just role over and die. He fought, he held on till the end he didn't just give up.
Malfoy however wasn't listening. He was more interested in Harry's, or Pansy's stomach. It looked, well it looked like...
Harry became pliant then, he didn't know why he still fought her. He knew how these meetings always ended.
she seemed to be getting bored now, done with her little mind games. "Tell me darling. Why do you think, He has figured it out. And your best friends." she said mockingly, in a disgusting baby voice. "Haven't come to your recuse."
"No. Don't you dare. don't you fucking dare. Sit there and tell me your sorry. She is the only family I have. Probably the only family i will ever have. I ached for her, I'm not talking emotionally, though Merlin know that my heart feels like it's been ripped from my rib-cage. I’m Talking about my body physically aching for her. Do you know what its like to have your body leak for a child that's not there. To have to feel it dry up and stop because there was no one to feed.
The sound of his voices moans. That he knew all to well from when he indulged in a good wank. That voice. His voice, made it all the worse.
It was an odd sensation. Having a little being suck at his chest like he was a cow. He didn't know what to think about her until her little hand grasped at his breast and she looked up at him.
Soren rose an eyebrow. “Is that a threat.” He pondered. “A warning.” He stated. Soren smirked. “Come. Best not keep him waiting. I could lose my job.”
They ate their meals in silence. Though every now and then, Harry would open his mouth as if to say something, before closing it again. After the thirtieth time he had done this. Malfoy had, had enough.
‘Run away with me.” Draco repeated. Taking Harry’s slack hands in his. ‘Everyone already thinks we’re dead. We can leave. Go anywhere, be anything. Run away with me Harry.’ He pleaded. Eyes full of hope.
Malfoys face grew hard. "I don't believe I know what your talking about Potter." He stood abruptly. his tray clanging to the floor then disappearing with a pop!
Unwittingly his scared hands wrapped themselves around the pouch that still hung around his neck. The one that housed that Merlin awful, musty, smelly, wonderful tent.
Harry sent him a glare, before using the wall he rested on, to pull himself up. Blood trickling down his leg.
When she removed his hand from his rolling stomach, he felt a pain ripple throughout his body. Not like those that were located in his stomach. The ever growing mass wreaking havoc on Pansy body. He guessed it was a tumor. A big one. That little voice in his head. The dark one. Hoped it would take him in his sleep. It was getting harder to ignore that voice.
Went the cell doors, as Harry found himself back in his cage. The guard making another BANG! As he left the cell block.
"No! You fool! You can have fun after its been to medi." Rude. Harry though. "For now. remove it's dam cuffs. It wont be going anywhere." he grinned meaninglessly, pulling out his wand.
‘I know. Maybe I should have us see someone. A mind healer perhaps. If not for us, than at least for him. I love him Luna. I cant bare to see him like this. And I know I haven’t been the most attentive of him since he came back. Godric, I barley have time for myself of late. But that seems to be my underlying problem, its not about me. He fought in a war. He needs more time than I’m giving him to assimilate back to....’
And it was at that moment that the tell tale sound of the guards approaching rang through their cell block, that Harry's so called luck ran out.
Harry shied away from the touch, feeling guilty and embarrassed. Is he okay? No not really. How do you tell someone that you saw their husband die in front of you.
"Morning Potter." He greeted, as he scooped another hand full. Harry coked his head in confusion. Malfoy was acting like.. well like nothing happened.
‘It’s this assignment. They want the whole platoon!’ Harry voiced, Draco running his fingers through his hair to loosen the remaining tied strands, as he listened to Harry intently.
He doesn’t feel much like Christmas shopping after that. Deciding to walk home, it not far from where there’s a park nearby that cuts right through to Grimuald.
"All of it." he heard. His eyes opening bewilderd. And disgusted to see that tristyn pants had tented. The man was in his late thirty's at least. Scum bag. "And the shoes." Rick added.
He didn’t know how long he stayed there like that. Numb to the world around him. Till he was pulled from his stupor when the sound of footsteps echoing down the corridor, looking up he found the familiar figure of Pansy Parkinson.
"Why, Potter. what are you trying to imply. I should get the guards in here, for that display." She threatened, sarcastically. Though Harry knew that she didn't make those idly.
‘Gonna make you come to hard Dr....Darling.’ He panted, slowing on his stumble. Before picking up the pace.
Harry looked at the squealing thing he had caught in his hands, covered in blood and still connected to him. With the little strength he could muster he crawled back painfully, resting himself against the bed. Not really felling it when the placenta was birthed.
‘When we don’t make a direct A.K, when we apprehend they never go for me. They always target Draco, sometimes I feel as if I’m not there to them. At first I simply brushed it off, but it kept happing. We have been at this a year we know how to sense a wand on our backs. And Ron there is one on Draco’s.
‘No. Draco. I know what you are going to say, but diplomacy wont work if the body is corrupt. I know you are still apart of the gamot. But face it Malfoy, this war keeps pointing back to the gamot.’ Harry interrupted.
He didn't slip again after that. But Malfoy no longer went in one ear and out the other. Day after day the new cycle continued. Breakfast a history fact, lunch a random fact that only Malfoy would know. And Dinner. Well, dinner was Harry's favorite.
Both looked up at each other in shock. Before morphing, Harry mortified that Malfoy had finally made him break his vow of silence. Malfoy looking like the kneazle who got the snidget.
‘James?’ Harry stared in awe. Pushing past the threshold and embracing him in a bone crushing hug. So happy he wept.
“You are in no state to be making demands of me. I’m the one with the power now.” She picked him up like he was nothing smashing him against the wall. Winding him in the process. She smirked at his loss of breath. “Your stronger than your frail arse looks Potter.”
‘Nonsense James! Fred and George got told that by Molly, more then once and look what they made for themselves. The Weasley name will be remembered for years to come because of them. This is in your blood. On both sides actually. And not to brag or anything but I was actually their first investor.’ Harry beamed.
"Potter. She was free to take every penny under her's and fathers name. But...Father and I... Well. I'm here aren't I." He snarled.
The hug was all encompassing, warm and welcoming. Harry had missed them. Oh how he had missed them. But he couldn’t stop a part of his brain from telling him, that there was something slightly off about them. To...soft.
Malfoy huffed leaning his head against the stone. "I don't want to talk. Okay Potter! I'm not some blushing virgin, if you must know. I didn't have my first time stolen from me... Last night wasn't the first time that's happened. And it wont be the last. And I will deal with it, how I see fit. So, if it happens again. I can avoid, this... Unwanted pity session."
"explain it to me again." Draco ordered. One can never forget just how he was raised when he spoke like that. Harry hitting the back of his head against the wall in annoyance.
And before he knew what had happened. She’d yanked his hand towards her and cast a cutting hex on his hand, then her own. Clasping there bloody hands together and placing them on the strange object. Beginning to chant an unknown spell he had never heard before. A flash of bright white light escaping from it.
"Did you know, in ancient Greece. Throwing an apple to a woman, was a symbolic deceleration of love? And if they caught it, it meant they returned that love." Malfoy said.
Harry could still feel the presence of the dementours in every fiber of his being, and they weren't even in the cells yet. A shiver ran through him at the thought, of spending the next fifteen years here. In a Cramped cell. the remnants of dementours staining the foundations. He wondered how he would last. Having spent the better parts of his childhood in a cupboard under the stairs. It was any wonder he had developed a rather intense case of claustrophobia.
With a yawn and a quick once over his uniform, Harry let down his tent with a swish of his wand and placed the now shrunken piece of cloth into the pouch around his neck, the same one Hargrid gifted him those many years ago.
First came his shirt, flinging it to the floor as he sat on the edge of the bed, hands between his knees breathing heavily.
Harry tried not to laugh, at the threat. what with that squeaky voice. He doubted the man would go through with it. But just to be on the safe side. Harry didn't push his luck. So he stayed quite, for the remainder of his check in, into the Hotel Del La Azkaban.
A quick quotes quill, floating impatiently beside the plump witch. As she watched them from her couch, overstuffed with pillows and adorned with random doilies. Seemingly waiting for them to speak first.
Draco and him used to do their best work on nights like this. Under cover of the blacking abyss of uncertain night. Harry knowing the way though, with the help of his maps. Draco... well being Draco.
Harry got up and kicked his bed. Wondering if it was worth it, to fling his dingy mattress around the cell. One of the perks to sitting in a cell all day, you have plenty of time for cardio. He opted for punching the wall instead, until his knuckles bled. Before falling to a heap on the floor.
Not ten minutes after he had fallen asleep, he found himself jolting awake to the sound of his own screams.
As he walked past Malfoy cell, who was paying him no mind, staring at the ceiling. (He had been visited again, last night.) Harry began to wonder, who had come to visit him? Who had come to this hell hole to see him. Had one of his friends finally seen through Pansy's lie? Was it Hermione or Ron. Maybe even ... Ginny. Or he could just be getting his hopes up, and it was just one of Parkinson's friends or family.
‘Than I die. After all...’ he pointed at his doppelgänger that lay prone and lifeless on the grass. ‘I’m already dead.’
Harry smirked up at him in the middle of a push up, pansy’s breast brushing the floor at each press down.
The grass looked better then half the places they had set up camp in their time as AK’s. what could it hurt to pitch it.
‘That’s not funny.’ Harry barked. Wrapping the stump just below Draco’s elbow, in a pain relieving paste. Harry noted his features relax almost immediately.
Harry raced towards it. trying to get there before it shut. "NO! WAIT! YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG PERSON! I'M HARRY POTTER! I'M HARRY POTTER!" He screamed till his throat was hoarse. Shaking on the bars.
"Look at those tits." Rick jeered. Tristyn huffing at his comment. As Harry took off his shoes, standing on his discarded cloths, so as not to catch whatever deaeses where living on the revolting floor.
"I'm guessing it didn't go as you'd hoped. " Malfoy gently coaxed. Harry shook his head in agreement.
"I've never seen you before." He stated, placing his hands onto the grimy wall. Catching a glimpse of black gelled back hair, and a well defined chin. "Are you with M.A.C.U.S.A?"
Harry found himself picking up the pace, until they both came together. Harry panting hard as he slipped out of Malfoy tight hole. Getting up and resting against the grandfather clock that stood nearby.
Unwarranted images flashed through his mind at the thought of draco. Sweat soaked skin, long blond locks, that left unattended looked like waves as they fell down aristocratic shoulders.....Shaking his head he tried to clear it off those images.
As the rest of the platoon made their way in for the debriefing, Harry made his way out to find Draco.
Another laugh left his/her throat. He didn’t know how to differentiate between them. It would be easier to just say her even though she was in his body. It was still Pansy in there.
"Hold this. You whore!" Rick sneered. Shoving a plank with numbers and rune on it, under which had the name Pansy Parkinson.
She glared at him. As she clutched the strange object harder. Seeming to grow impatient with him. Harry took a steely breath. “I just wanted to say.... I forgive you for what you did. I know what it’s like to have Voldemort.” She flinched. “In your head, so I don’t blame you for wanting to protect yourself.” He finally managed to get out, if a bit awkwardly.
"Im guessing the Malfoy boy, knows what awaits you tonight. And best you prepare yourself for it." Bayard croaked.
His hands clutched his agonizing stomach. It had grown progressively worse, since his time with Pansy, he'd kept it quite while in her presence, but now in his solitary cell, he could no longer keep his anguish contained.
“Must you Potter!” Draco huffed, turning away from the sight of a naked potter, he really had no love for Parkinson’s body, and  Harry had it on constant display. If he needed anymore proof of his queerness, wanting to physically vom at the sight of a naked woman was all the proof he needed.
"Listen Harry. This is no joke Pansy must have.." He didn't get to finish, as Harry started to shake his head in incredulity. Shouting out:
His face looked back at him in manic excitement, letting a peak of laughter escape his lips. “Oh Potter. I would have thought you figured that out by now. But you’ve always been so blissfully oblivious. So let me spell” she chuckled. “It out. I’ve switched our bodes. I’m Harry Potter saviour of the wizard of world. And you. You. Are Pansy Parkinson. Wanted accomplices to death eater activity, and the one who was ready to hand the saviour of the wizarding world.” She grinned back with his face.
‘That’s. well its a long story, and i would really rather tell everyone together, than have to repeat myself.’ He explained.
Harry finally turned to face him. Draco tried not to gasp at the way he looked. His face gaunt and pale .
Harry waved his hand, with a soundless spell, letting Ron in. As he sat on the edge of the tub, Ron opening the door and shutting it with a slam behind him, that made Harry’s head ache all the more.
He just wanted it all to stop. See his family again. Remus, Tonks, Sirius, Mum, Dad. He blinked slowly as his thoughts raced through his head. They didn’t give up their lives so he could lay there in the dirt after avenging them. And saving the wizarding world.
The billowing scream, waking Malfoy from his fitful sleep. Not having realized, that Potter had left he knew he was back though.
‘Of course there are. But he wont tell me what they are! And I’m starting to think it has to do with someone else.’
The guards led Harry this way and that, Till Harry was shoved into the room where harry first meet Parkinson. And that was who greeted him upon entry.
‘Harry. This is the tenth time in less than two weeks. I don’t want to be the bitch who tells you this after all you’ve been through. But I Have a big meeting in the morning and I need my sleep. So either you go to the spare room or I do.’
It was funny now he thought about it. In the year that they had been “dead”. This tent had become their home. And tomorrow, they would take it down for the last time.
"Hey, Tristyn. You reckon we should get the newbies to take the mugshot's. Teach 'em the ropes." Rick, piped up a couple minutes into there walk down the whistling halls.
Malfoy chose that moment in time, to look up from his stationary apple, at the naked Harry. "Fucking hell! Potter!" He screeched, trying to avoid eye contact.
"Do you feel like you need to push?" Harry nodded. "Okay, get on the bed don't lay down. Get on your hands and knees."
The day started like any other. Breakfast slop arrived, today it was served with a slice of stale bread. This promoted Malfoy to say. "Did you know. In medieval times, because some peasant crops weren't ready, they used old rye to make bread, often times it was infected with a fungus called ergot. And caused Hallucinations and death."
"Strip." Rick ordered. Letting go of him with a push. Harry stared at the guards in horror. "W-what?" he spluttered.
"Don't answer that Thatch. You learn quick here, that inmates are not worthy of answers." Rick the dick sneered. "Especially, this inmate. What do they teach you at M.A.C.U.S.A."
‘So, what time does your mother get home?’ Harry scratched the back of his head staring down at the sandwich James made them.
She smirked in reply. "I couldn't very well have the only person, who could see through my ruse walking around free. Now could I? Well, second The other ran off to Norway With the grandson of Newt Scamander. So that solved that Problem."
It was dark, and once again Harry found it hard to sleep.He often found himself Sleeping through the day, just to make it go faster. Plus the fatigue that he had been experiencing of late, had thrown his sleeping habits out the barred windows. He often found himself just nodding off while Draco was talking to him. He still hasn't heard the end of that.
He turned away from her gaze, staring at the peeling paint on the wall, thoughts consumed with his daughter. Where she was, what she looked like. what her name was.
Harry looked at him wonder struck. Then his Jaw clenched and he was filled with a rage like he had never known. His knuckles again turning white as they gripped the bars.
Kingsley raised his hands for silence. The crowed simmering down somewhat though still noticeably irritable. "The wizard gamont, though already having come to a verdict, where given a late missive from one Harry Potter. Requesting that the accused be granted amnesty from the death potion." The crowed was signing his impostors praises at this.
‘So. Ive been thinking it might be favourable, if we went to see a mind healer.’ Ginny declared, over another James free dinner.
Harry took that time to cast a quick, wandless and wordless spell to clean his mouth out. Without the muggles catching on as they wondered around them.
‘Donaldson!’ Harry beamed, embracing him. Pulling back to get a look at him, he couldn’t keep the grin off his face. He was alive, he was... a widower.
But he wasn't at the gate anymore. He'd retreated further into his cell. Harry thanked him anyway. In the darkness of the cell the old inmate smiled for the first time in twenty years.
Harry was in the dark corner off his bed a clear view through the bars though. His eyes finally adjusting to the dark. If there was one thing he could say he liked about being in this body, it would be that he could see. Though he wished for his terrible eye sight back at this moment in time. He could see a figure looming over Malfoy.
"You know what it's like to be raped?" Harry asked. His back to the blond, staring at the slime on the wall, it had grown in the days he'd stopped, caring if he lived or died.
Now standing in the wooded area they had called home for who knew how many weeks, the two lifted the protection charm that surrounded their little eden.
“Whatever freaky Friday shit you’ve pulled undo it now!” He demanded. Crowding her space it was an odd sight seeing yourself look down at you in such a menacing way. It sent a shiver down his spine.
Turning towards the bars that confined him, he waited for the guard to pass by, or stop at his cell. The dragon hide boots clicking down the halls. They all wore dragon hide.
‘I KNOW. I know... we are this close to ending the war the intel we have on the gamot. The puppet master, two more jobs and we will have everything we need to end this war. You all set on your end.’ He queried.
"I..I dont know, whats..wha... Hap-happening. These, pains. they just..." He winced, as a gush of liquid started to rush down his legs. He looked down at the puddle in mortification. "And now I've pissed myself." he whimpered uncharacteristically.
Harry played with Draco’s hair for what felt like hours, the water grown dirty with the filth of the day before, the two of them both pruney, but harry still didn’t want to get out, it was to much because once he got out of the tub that meant dealing and Harry would really rather not.
Ron flicked his head back an forth between the two. ‘You fucking barmy Harry! I’m a neutral party. I am not to inter fear in warfare.’ He seethed, turning his back on Harry, and onto Draco. ‘And you! You aren’t actually thinking of going along with this madness.’
They had planned for this, but planning and reality are two entirely different things. He should know after the year he, Ron and Hermione were on the run.
Fuck! He hasn’t pitched the tent. He got up and sprinted outside to the backyard. Begging to cast protective charms around the perimeter of the yard.
‘I’ll talk to Dawlish before we head out. I’ll hand myself over to the Norwegians, before I doubt Harry Potters Magical instincts.’ Draco smirked, patting Harrys knee as he rose from the lounge. ‘Now get to sleep Potter or I’ll steal all your maps.’
On their last hit, they had been given intel that a strike on Hogwarts had been called. After all that’s where Scorpius was. The ultimate way to lure out Draco.
‘Yes, James. I will be here when you get back.’ James turned back and gave him one last hug, before closing the door behind him.
Tristyn laughed. " like I don't know what you got in that beloved bat, of yours." well, thought Harry. That was useful information.
‘Hadn’t you heard? Greenwitch and him eloped when we were stationed in Flåm three months ago. We haven’t seen much action since then so they thought they would be fine. But then Donaldson found out he was pregnant, so he was given a honourable discharge.’ He said through a bite of beans on toast, making a face after he swallowed. ‘Ugh! I can not cook, Potter can you pass the salt.’
Pansy looked at him calculating. Harry felt his skin prickle. His instincts telling him to to run. Even more so when she smiled. A sense of foreboding filling his chest.
Harry took his head out his hands, shooting Ron a weak smile, grabbing his out stretched hand, pulling himself up.
So he waited. In his cell, trying to keep the nausea at bay, while the wizarding world tried to put it self to rights. Purging any trace of Voldemort and his followers. Unluckily for him. He was now in one of those bodies.
"Malfoy?" he replied, grabbing his slop, and Oooh an apple, Harry thought. That's new. He picked it up, smelling and feeling it. Just to make sure it was real.
“So..I...err..I just wanted.” He babbled as he rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably, lost for words, why the hell did he try and talk to her again? “I just.”
‘Former. I am a solider now Potter. Charged with keeping the chosen one alive, and..... following orders.’ Draco grinned back.
He was hesitant to wash his mouth out, from the grubby sink that was on top of the toilet. It was that or taste vomit all day. Frankly he wasn't sure which was worse.
‘I just. Diagon, she’s to blame for it. The platoon, the war. Everything. What was the motive, why all this death. Destruction. Why even bring the Norwegians into it all.’ He pondered.
"You and Parkinson were friends. More than that from what I saw during school. There's no way you haven't seen these." he took a squeeze of them. "Oww. Before?" he winced. "Are all boobs achy and itchy." He rubbed at them in question.
Harry simply rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Honestly Malfoy I don’t much care, this is a big prison you have no way of knowing he doesn’t have a favourite on every level.”
‘I know that. But to everyone else its a symbol that I could turn on them at any second. I loved our platoon, I was friends with most everyone int it. But they would star, I saw in there eyes, “can I trust him”.’
With an irritated huff, she got up from her place on the chair, crouching in front of him. A hand reaching out to touch his distended stomach.
"Have you ever loved something so much, that if they were taken from you. Your life just wouldn't be worth living?"
But later that night, before the fair people pulled it down, Harry apperated the two of them to the highest seat. The both of them laughing as the wind blew them back and forth.
Dawlish, eyed him in a rage bubbling to the surface. ‘And I am your commanding officer. You mister Potter. Will treat me with respect. I don’t much care for the rank in which the ministry assigned you. You will do as I have commanded and do so without causing a stink. That. Is an order!’ Dawlish commanded, eyes bulging and bald forehead sweating despite the chill in the air.
A freezing five minutes later, Harry found himself cuffed again, and being dragged naked! Through the halls, to medical. Receiving rude gestures when the other guards that patrolled Azkaban strolled past. He also got a rather untoward sneer from the only female guard they passed.
without the constant conversation with Malfoy. Prison was well boring. Despite this rather depressing drawback one of many in Azkaban. Harry still had to get up least he waste away and let pansy win. It seemed the only thing keeping him going was pure spite, he tried to find hope at seeing his daughter as motivation, and it was slightly. But in a prison built to crush that out of you, spite was the only thing actually keeping him going.
"How. In the name of blast ended skwerts. Would I know? Do I look like I've got them. And that body, was enough to turn me off the female species for good." Malfoys eyes seemed to widen at that. Harry spotting his slip, as his head shot up from touching the two lumps on his chest.
‘Wow!’ She sighed, hugging him close. ‘Either sex was never any good, or Ive been celibate for to long, because that was..’
"Twats aren't for me. But that Ass. If only she had a cock." Rick stated. A hand flew to Harry mouth, the need to spew returning.
It was worse than the first time, somehow. Like he had given up, actually consented to what she was putting him through. He planned to just lay there and let her do what she wanted, that was until she pulled at his hair and snarled in his ear.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, leaning on the grimy wall, waiting for Parkinson to get on with her yearly tortures.
Time skips and smut I what your in for this chap, also I feel like my reason for the war is lame I honestly couldn’t think of any other reason for it.
‘Don’t move Malfoy. Just. Just stay there I’ll go get some potions.’ Harry struggled to get out, adrenaline and panic coursing through him.
"Stand there." he pointed. to a blank looking wall. "Adam!" Tristyn called, and a skinny bloke entered to room.
After that first night it was something the two indulged in after a mission. Though... it had begun to grow to every night, or whenever the mood struck them.
It was no secret to Harry either, in fact he seemed to take pleasure in Draco’s rather public hatred of him.
So many things had changed. Members of his family, who had been together before he left for the war, now had not talked to each other in months. There was a new Diagon Alley, And family activities they once did religiously had now fell by the way side.
Harry couldn’t watch. So he’d left the great hall, and Ginny and Ron, to mourn their loss. He to was grieving. But both he and Hermione thought it best to leave the family. Hermione went to tend the wounded. While Harry found him self at a loss.
Sticky footprints could be heard through the silence of the tent has Harry made his way to the kitchen, as Malfoy sat at the dining table, neither one noticing or caring that they were both covered in blood.
The sound unlocked something in Harry. It was if he was being transported back, to two months ago. He covered his ears and closed his eyes. As if that would stop the pictures running through his head.
He sounded defeated. Harry wanted to ask. Oh how he wanted to. But he held his tongue for some time before he couldn't anymore.
Draco looked on in sadness, Harry didn't deserve this. He was supposed to be free. Marry the weslette, become an auror and spend the rest of his years with a horde of ginger children, not wasting away in prison, longing for a child he didn't even get to name, in a woman's body slowly turning mad from PTSD.
‘It’s a standard mission that five can complete, we have done several missions exactly like this, and we do not need the whole platoon. It just boggles my mind, its a retrieval mission, you want to go under the radar not, swarm in wands blazing with the whole bloody platoon! It’s reckless and unnecessary.’ He lamented, slugging off his dragon hide boots, and throwing them Merlin knew where.
"Tell me how you expect me to strip! If my hands are cuffed. You great pillock!" He sassed, lifting his hands for emphasis.
‘Please be there when I turn around.’ She pleaded. Spinning swiftly to face him. ‘Your alive!’ She gasped. Sprinting into his arms.
Harry glanced up to see Malfoy enter his tent, flicking a quick lumos over his work bench as he did so. With a nod he once again found his attention drawn back to his work.
The grey eyes piercing Harry’s. “Potter?” He said up at his bars now. “Where are you going?” He asked while his eyes screamed with knowing. “Visitor.” Harry replied. “Do you think..?” He trailed off.
It was as he walk passed a Harrods that he pumped into someone, almost sending them flying, if not for his seeker reflexes, they would have.
Harry hated to think what he'd be like after a year. Let alone fifteen. But the plus side was at least there weren't any dementors.
Harry, fell to the floor when he reached his cell. Slamming his fists on the moldy stone, as the cell door clanged shut.
Once he'd finished, a familiar sound reverberated around his cell. The entry gate had opened. It was dark so he couldn't see much. And for once the winds outside, were quite, so his other senses took over. He could hear dragon hide boots on the hard stone. Harry felt like the worst griffyndor alive, as he hid out of view.
‘Don’t tell me. I’ve, I’ve already missed three years of their lives. James will have graduated by by now, and Teddy has probably started a life with Victorie. And Lil’s, little Lil’s. I’ve missed so much...’
“I think you’ll find they won’t. You see I don’t leave any loose ends. While the battle raged I had the time to plan what I’d do once the heathens descended. And there was no way I was going to Azkaban or getting the kiss. So I made a fail safe while locked in the dungeons. Now I was going to pick a random student. But then who do I find but you.
‘Well, when you do let me know would you mate.’ Ron said resigned to the fact that he knew Harry wouldn’t tell him, as he made to get off the floor. ‘I’m here for you Harry. Always.’
The Bitch grinned at him, in that awful way. He Hated seeing his face do that. "Believe what you will. I have another reason for coming."
Then they would go back to their tent, and fuck. That was their world the two of them and that musty, smelly, Merlin awful tent.
‘Well.’ Ginny turned to face him, never one to back down from anything, no mater how humiliating or painful. ‘The tent Harry.’
"I know but. Last night. I was awake." he prodded. giving Malfoy a look as if to say 'I was awake when the guard..'
‘So, Ginny I’d like to hear from you what seems to be the problem at the moment, look at your partner and tell him what’s been on your mind.’ Dr dollie, said sweetly.
The fact still stood though. Draco was free. That meant Harry had to get things moving on the inside, while Draco tackled the outside.
‘I wont disagree with you there mate. Ginny told Hermione, who told me about your disaster of an appointment at the mind healer the other week. But that’s not what I’m talking about. Why did you just throw your guts up, in me mums bath?’
Harry was more miffed, well he was more than miffed. With the fact that Pug face was there and he wasn't. like so many other moments he should have been apart of.
