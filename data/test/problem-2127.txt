Malfoy fidgets with his notebook, but brings out an old version of a Pompion Pumpkin Latte that Harry knows he had perfected two weeks ago.
“Ugh, fine,” Draco says, crossing his arms and sulking, and obstinately refuses to help any further.
Potter just moans louder in response, his lips tightening around Draco’s cock, and Draco’s hips automatically snap forward on their own accord as he comes unexpectedly. His body curves gracefully over Potter as he comes, his hands tightening in Potter’s hair, groaning as he rides out the last waves of ecstasy that rack his body.
“...and this sets out the penalties if you breach the agreement, which includes a sudden and random outbreak of adult acne once a month for the rest of your life, a million Galleons payable on demand, and the naming rights to your firstborn child.” Malfoy leans back, sounding extremely satisfied, and Harry can finally think again.
Cheng Wu looks between the two of them, an amused expression on his face as he informs Potter helpfully, "Draco’s single. Very single. No boyfriend in sight, pity that. And this is my last day in London actually, I’m Porting back to Hong Kong tonight."
“Bruised Alihotsy leaves. And a lower flame when bringing the potion to a boil,” Malfoy says slowly.
"Some of us aspire not to be like you, you absolute disaster of a human being." Draco flicks a scornful finger at Potter’s messy hair, currently made worse by his bedhead, and Potter merely grins in reply.
“Here?” Harry says, as Malfoy leads the way to the bathroom.
Disappointment rises up and sits heavy in his stomach as he walks back, until he rounds the corner and sees Malfoy sitting on the bench in front of his locker, his left arm tucked protectively against his chest. Malfoy’s still in the same clothes as before, his right arm resting across his knees and his head bowed low as he curls into himself.
. Maybe it’s all those weeks with Malfoy, messing around in the lab and laughing over the antics of the Portraits, but Harry has stopped seeing Malfoy as a mystery to investigate, and has started seeing him as an actual person. An amusing person with ridiculous opinions and outrageous ideas, but a person nonetheless.
“Yes, but hang on, just give me a minute—”
Malfoy looks extremely pleased with himself, that smug evil-doer, and it speaks to the inner child within Harry that his first response is: “They aren’t my minions. Ron and Hermione are my best friends!”
They used to giggle about the double innuendo, Draco recalls. He exchanges a look with Blaise now, both of them snickering into their drinks as Potter begins to laugh.
It takes Harry a second to come back to himself. “What? Oh. I mean, what’s intriguing?”
The question of
“You’re welcome. And Harry, that package you were waiting for is in the broom shed. Now shoo! Leave me in peace to get dinner ready.”
. Mercifully, the cupboard this time round is slightly larger so they actually fit in relatively comfortably, although Draco still ends up pressed up against Potter, because the lust potion is starting to take hold again. It unfurls like a flower, heat spreading throughout his body, and he shudders with need, his body almost shaking with it.
jurisdiction and
Malfoy enters the bath with a splash. After he’s sure that Malfoy’s fully submerged, Harry allows himself to glance over. Malfoy’s body where he leans against the side of the tub is covered by a thick layer of foam and bubbles.
” Malfoy says eagerly, and beckons Harry over impatiently. “Come on Potter, we’ve got work to do!”
a wanker.” Harry says, but there’s no heat behind his words. He smiles at Malfoy without meaning to, then stops when he catches himself at it, then finds himself smiling again in wonder as Malfoy lifts a lazy hand and fashions a quill out of thin air. It’s a fancy bit of magic, and Malfoy pulls it off effortlessly, his long fingers shaping itself around the quill until it solidifies in his hand.
“Huh?” Sirius says, sticking his head in through the doorway, still struggling with the Luggage. There’s a loud thump and Sirius yelps in pain, withdrawing to let out a stream of curses as he kicks at the Luggage. “Goddamnit,” Sirius says loudly, and Remus sighs.
“Is that what you think I would do?” Harry demands, stung. “Leave my partner alone and in pain and get a drink with my mates?”
“Not at all,” Draco says. “The modern models are very safe. There’s a speed limiter and a height restriction, so they can’t fly as high or as fast as some of the brooms we used to have when we were young.”

Harry’s face scrunches into a frown. “From last week? Who almost cursed our noses off when we tried to confiscate that cursed jewelry box in his attic? Of course I do, it took ages for us to talk him down. Why?”
“He isn’t in.”
“Perfect,” Potter says, and smiles down at where the Horntail’s trying to bite his fingers. Privately, Draco wonders whether Potter’s a masochist. Potter had one of the greatest dark wizards of their time as his own personal nemesis, is constantly getting himself into situations where he ends up injured, and on top of that, has now procured himself a pet whose primary function appears to be the maiming of his fingers.
There’s a long silence. “Oh,” Potter says finally. “I… wasn’t aware of that.”
"Malfoy," Potter says slowly, as if talking to a young child, "this
It’s actually pretty genius, although Harry’s not about to say that. What he does say instead is, “Malfoy, you’re absolutely bonkers,” and then as an aside, muttered under his breath, “I call her the Queen Liz.”
“Malfoy, you massive nerd,” Harry says, laughing, and Malfoy flushes scarlet. “No, I didn’t mean it in a bad way. This room is amazing, and I’m not making fun of that. I’m making fun of you actually being, well, smart. Although that’s kind of impressive? I, mean, er—” Harry flounders and stops, trying to put his jumbled thoughts in order.
Draco’s intrigued to find that he likes Potter this way, all broken and desperate for him. Potter babbles nonsense as Draco wraps around a hot hand around the base of Potter’s cock, gives it an experimental short stroke. Draco’s still hard. He palms himself through his trousers with his other hand, squeezing his cock gently through the material, but there isn’t enough space in the cupboard for him to work them both, so he turns back his attention back to Potter.
to punish me? I thought you said we were fine.”
Right now, the tinsel’s cycling through shades of sea-foam green, and the light that fills the room that has that strange, shifting quality that makes it feel like they’re underwater. Draco helpfully points out, "That’s where I sit."
The front door to Pansy and Ginny’s house bangs open for the fifth time in an hour, and Draco looks up in the middle of his conversation with Blaise just as Potter sweeps in. He brings with him a cold gust of wind that swirls around the living room, which causes someone to cry out, “Shut the door!”
Malfoy gives up on pulling on the door and opts instead for smiling at Harry in a manner that unnerves him. “Why, of course, Potter, do come in so that I can list in
Draco finds the tiny dragon sleeping on the staircase leading up to the astronomy tower.
“Fine. Alright, my bedroom then.”
“Stay back,” Harry says, loud and commanding, and concentrates on St. Mungo’s. There’s the sharp crack as he tries to apparate with Draco, and they flicker out before reforming again.
He finishes, and turns to set beakers aside when the Amortentia catches his eye. It seems to shine faintly with its own glow, and he brings a beaker up to eye-level to examine it more carefully. A dim memory of Slughorn lecturing them on it floats up from the dim recesses of his memory, on how the potion only creates obsession, not love.
Fossey takes over then, explaining what they’ve been up to this last month: the joint task force they’ve set up with Hong Kong; the triads; the raid of the warehouse. Finally, Fossey gets to the heart of the issue: a press conference at two o’ clock this afternoon, to announce the success of the international task force.
He hurries down the steps as Malfoy calls out, “Hang on, just give me a second,” and so Harry’s left standing in the middle of the bathroom, facing the opposite wall to give Malfoy some privacy and listening to the splash of water.
He thinks,
“Uh huh.” Harry looks at the row of cauldrons bubbling away on the table and is so certain that he’s close to uncovering
part of the evening. “You’re plastered.”
Potter makes a face at the mess he's made of their jumpers, and casts a quick
Potter swallows down as much as Draco’s come as he can, but a little bit spills over and runs down his chin. Draco moans again as his over-sensitive cock slips out of Potter’s mouth, and he opens eyes that he didn’t realise were closed to watch as Potter wipes his chin with a finger. Potter holds Draco’s gaze as he slowly brings his finger to his mouth and sucks it down to the last knuckle.
Harry gapes as he follows Malfoy in, staring. A constellation of stars are scattered across the walls and ceiling of the room, so numerous that the room is lit with an almost unearthly glow from their twinkling. A luminous orb hangs motionless in the middle of the room, filling the room with a soft golden glow.
“—that a house-elf is tied to the house? No, that’s a common misconception. House-elves devote themselves to a family, and a family is more than a house. Although interestingly, there have been recorded instances where if the house has been passed down through the family for several generations, house-elves begin to consider the house as an extension of the family. Probably because of the familial magic. It’s a poorly researched topic, although extremely fascinating.”
Potter doesn’t return for the rest of the day, and Fossey’s door remains firmly closed. There’s a restless, uneasy energy in the office that unsettles Draco, and he’s glad to leave it behind when the end of the day finally rolls around. He goes home to a dark house and no one waiting for him. He stands there for a long time in the empty parlour, staring into the shadows gathering in the corners, listening to the Portraits muttering sleepily to themselves, and, for the second time in a month, feels incredibly alone.
"Come on," Cheng Wu says, nodding towards Fossey’s closed door. The rest of the office stares at them curiously as Potter knocks on Fossey’s door, Fossey’s disembodied voice tells them to come in.
Draco drinks his Firewhiskey until he’s sure his face is flushed from the alcohol (and not embarrassment), while Blaise sips his drink and watches, amused.
“Oh,” he breathes, slightly dazzled, because how has he not noticed how very green Potter’s eyes are? From this distance, he can see the tiny flecks of gold in Potter’s iries; can count every individual eyelash.
"Are you single, and is your Division hiring?" This last one is screamed out by a very eager journalist who has jumped to her feet, and the whole room laughs.
Draco goes into work the next day to find that Robards has, as usual, tried to portray it as an Auror win. Fossey’s raging in her office as she yells down the phone that this is
Potter’s already rising from the bench, and reaches out a hand to the dragon. It eyes them both balefully for a long second and doesn’t move from where it’s sprawled out across the table. Potter starts making a clicking noise with his tongue in an attempt to coax it over, which it promptly ignores.
“It seems to like you,” Potter says quietly. “And I know you won’t hurt it.”
and whatnot, while Mother would clutch her wine glass and pretend she didn’t understand what was going on.”
“We’re disclaiming all liability, and you unconditionally and irrevocably agree to the settlement of all liabilities, claims, actions, suits or disputes whatsoever that you may or anytime have against Espresso Patronum or any of its employees relating to, arising from, or in connection with the incident,” Malfoy says. He parrots what’s written down on the document so perfectly without looking at it that Harry has a dark suspicion that this isn’t the first time an incident like this has happened. “Basically, you agree that nothing happened in the shop today and that you’re absolutely fine and you’re not going to sue us.”
He whirls around and heads for the elusive door that leads to the back room, and Harry sees his chance. He follows hot on Malfoy’s heels, and shoves his foot into the gap as Malfoy’s about to close the door.
Suspicions confirmed, Harry makes his way back to the counter, trying to hold back laughter. Predictably, Grim Graham doesn’t bother to look up at his approach.
“Nothing compared to what I’ve seen before? Malfoy, this tops
"These dragon parts are worth millions; we can’t just let them walk out with it. What if the Sun Yee On spot the spells and dismantle them? It’s too risky," she says, shaking her head when they come to her with their idea. But they have no other leads, and when weeks go by with no progress, she grudgingly gives in. Draco doesn’t tell her that they implemented Cheng Wu’s plan the day she turned them away–now that they have official approval, there’s no need to ruffle her feathers unnecessarily.
, he knows it, he just has to find out what secrets Malfoy’s hiding in this laboratory. He looks around the room, carefully avoiding Malfoy’s smug gaze as he works it out. If the potions that Malfoy is brewing are legal, then that’s not what the license covers. Then he gets it.
transferred me out for that," Potter finally yells back, sounding extremely cross.
, the light chasing away whatever fleeting moments of tenderness that they had in the darkness.
“For me?” Draco says. He sets the mugs down on a nearby shelf and steps forward, running his hands over the top of the box. It’s oak, and it smells like vanilla as his fingers trace the wood grain.
“Hey,” Harry says, turning around in irritation, and stops short when he sees Draco smirking back at him, tossing the apple into the air in one hand. “Malfoy-?” He glances around the coffee shop, as if checking to confirm his surroundings, then looks back at Draco again, surprise clearly written all over his face.
"Yes," Draco whispers, shaky. Potter presses one warm, large palm against the obvious bulge in Draco’s trousers and gives Draco’s cock a brief squeeze. Draco’s cock twitches in response, and Potter’s quick fingers make short work of Draco’s trousers, pushing them down to his knees.
Malfoy snorts again. He’s a warm presence by Harry’s side, and he’s standing a little too close as he dips a ladle in the cauldron, but Harry doesn’t move away.
It’s when Cheng Wu and Draco are in the midst of arguing over when to use ‘whom’ versus ‘who’ that Draco looks up and realises that Fossey and Potter have slipped out of the room. He can hear low voices in Shacklebolt’s office, but doesn't give it any more thought when Hannah tells Cheng Wu dreamily, "You’re absolutely right. Wow, did anyone ever tell you that you’re really smart?"
It’s close to midnight when everything’s finally over and done with, and when Cheng Wu finally Ports away from the Ministry’s official Portkey point with the last prisoner. Draco stifles a tired yawn as he walks down the quiet hallways, and enters to find an equally silent office, lit only by the soft blue of the Christmas tinsel on the wall.
“Oh, well. Alright then,” Draco says, trying to play it cool. He knows he hasn’t succeeded because there’s a wide grin on his face, and Potter’s smiling back at him. On his shoulder, the dragon’s begun nibbling on his ear.
,” he says pointedly, which Draco waves away with a dismissive hand.
Malfoy’s thrown off for a second, his face blank with surprise. But he recovers swiftly enough, and winks easily back at Harry as he says, “Absolutely. Did you notice you’re sitting up a lot taller? And your shoulders are thrown back instead of hunched over. How does it taste?”
“Good,” Malfoy says, relieved.
At that thought, Draco snaps back to reality and flings open the cupboard door again and stares at Potter, still struggling to comprehend the sight in front of him. "No, hang on," he says, "why are you standing in a cupboard? Have you decided to move in and make this your home?"
The days inch away slowly until finally, Saturday rolls around. The Portraits quieten down as soon as he steps foot into the shop, which is not a good sign. All of them are watching him intently, so he goes straight to Queen V, who eyes him with a smug smile.
been poisoned when his heart begins to pound and his breath quickens. Abruptly, he’s all too aware of Harry’s large, strong hand around his waist and pulling him close, and how warm Harry feels, pressed up against him.
Harry watches as he writes something down in his notebook, worrying at his lower lip the entire time. There’s a particular lock of fair hair that falls forward to hang over his eyes, no matter how many times he pushes it back. Harry watches Malfoy shove at it impatiently, the cheekbones of his face lit up by the pale shine of the potion.
“It’s so flavourful,” Harry says, sipping at it again. The coffee feels like liquid satisfaction sliding down his gut, and he closes his eyes for a second to concentrate on the flavour. “There’s a lovely crisp, rich flavour, with a hint of cherries, I think? It tastes a bit fruity. Maybe a bit of grapefruit in there? And something floral that I can’t pinpoint.”
They stop and smile at each other, and Draco says, “
“See you tomorrow,” Harry says, and it sounds like a promise.
Susan laughs. “Well, that’s mild for them. And did they lie? You have been ordering the same thing for the last couple of days. Why not try something new? Our menu goes far beyond Dreamless Cold Brew, you know. In fact,” she looks around before lowering her voice conspiratorially, “Draco’s actually working on a new flavour right now. Between you and me, I’m pretty sure it’s going to be an instant bestseller. Mark my words, there’s going to be another write-up in the Daily Prophet.”
"Took you long enough, Malfoy. What, did you get sidetracked fixing your hair?" Potter says amicably, and Draco scowls at him.
The next day dawns bright and cold. Draco is ten minutes late—“
What he had expected was for Malfoy to get flustered and come up with all sorts of excuses as to why that would be a bad idea, but what he gets instead is Malfoy lighting up immediately and clapping his hands together in delight.
Potter’s still standing in the same spot as if he were rooted to it, his head bowed oddly, his wand hand lax at his side.
He goes in to work the next day still in a pensive mood, and steps through the door to find a smiling Potter waiting for him at his desk as if the last few weeks never happened. His breath catches in his chest for a moment, but he doesn’t falter as he walks over.
was trying to impress
“Hopefully, a Confidence Cafe Au Lait. If I get this right, I predict that this will become
“Potter, if you don’t mind,” Malfoy hisses, trying unsuccessfully to pull the door closed. He looks at once both astounded and offended, which Harry privately thinks is a good look on him.
“Nothing,” Harry says, blinking in surprise in the face of Draco’s fury. “I... Just, be careful.”
Potter does an awkward shuffle on the spot, shifting his weight from one leg to the other before he finally says, “Fancy going down to Hogsmead with me tomorrow to pick one out?”
“Get off,” he snaps, harsher than usual because his partner is dying and there’s an assassin trying to kill them and he has no time for niceties. They make it to the door.
“Right,” Harry says, snorting again.
I already know I'm going to expand this one too.
“Of course,” Harry says at once, even as his heart does a strange little flutter against his ribs. “Of course we are. Friends.”
amount of money for this drink.”
Draco shrugs helplessly. "You’ve seen our offices," he reminds Potter. "You know how many people we have."
“Up to evil-doing. This early in the morning?” They both look over to the Slytherin table where Draco’s grumpily pouring himself a cup of coffee, scowling down at some first-years laughing at the end of the table. They stop immediately, cowering under the force of his glare.
“Would I risk being quartered and hung from the rafters for forgetting?” Potter says, and holds up a Saintsbury plastic bag. “Of course I did.”
The rest of the Portraits have all edged away, because Queen Liz tends to carry on once she gets into one of her moods. Harry nods and tunes her out as she carries on monologuing. He’s flipping through the morning newspaper and not paying much attention, so it comes as a surprise when he takes another sip of coffee and finds himself inadvertently smiling down at an article depicting the gruesome details of the latest victim of the Loch Ness up in Scotland.
“Did he now,” Harry murmurs, his mind racing.
Malfoy busies himself with staring into his glass as he mutters, “50 points to Gryffindor.” It’s muttered low enough that Harry’s fairly certain that Malfoy didn’t intend for him to hear, but he did.
That’s when the sharp, bright green of the Killing Curse flies over their heads, striking the wall next to the door.
He tenses as footsteps approach the cupboard, and prepares himself for the possibility of death. He’s had a good run, these last couple of years, and a crazy moment with Potter in a cupboard. He has no regrets. It’s a good way to go. Absently though, he wishes he had more time.
Malfoy stays silent, and just as Harry’s wondering what to do next, Malfoy finally says, “What do you mean, ‘giving the Slytherins a second chance’?”
,” Harry exclaims a bit too forcefully, except that Draco’s laughing, a little too gleeful.
“Well, did he deserve it?” Potter asks, a slight grin on his face.
Everyone’s gone–including Potter.
“Malfoy, your back says otherwise. It looks like you fought a Troll and lost. And if it wasn’t a big deal, you would have told me from the start.”
“Leave it, Potter. It should sort itself out by next week,” Malfoy says, but sits patiently as Harry runs two more variations of the healing spell. He chuckles quietly as Harry hisses in frustration when none of them take hold.
“You’re brewing Amortentia?” Now it makes sense: why Malfoy’s in an unusually serious mood for Saturday, and why he’s got double the number of wards up. And really, Harry should have identified it straight off from the potion’s distinctive sheen, but he was distracted by Malfoy and his damn fingers.
"Not now, I’m afraid." Potter’s clearly distracted, still looking over his shoulder at the hive of activity going on in the office, and Draco takes that as his cue.
“This is foul,” Harry says as soon as he sets the cup down. He wrinkles his nose in disgust, and Malfoy frowns.
“Oh,” Draco says again, stunned. He searches Potter’s face for hints that he’s misheard, but there’s only Potter’s smiling at him, a smile as warm as the sun and bright like starlight, a hopeful question in his eyes. “Did you say dinner?”
, of who he was working to
Then the rumours were that Malfoy was starting a zoo full of magical creatures (which Harry thought was highly unlikely but duly investigated anyway), which then morphed into Malfoy experimenting on magical creatures.
Draco gets the ping in the middle of the night. A faint, insistent buzz permeates his dreams, and when he finally opens his eyes, his room is filled with a soft, golden light, and his wand is vibrating. Instantly, he knows that the wards have been breached and the exhibits are gone.
Malfoy gives Harry a confused look. “I gave you a mis-brewed fusion coffee, and then acted improperly when you had no choice but to ride out the effects of something that I inflicted on you. Why wouldn’t I be apologising?”
"Alright then," Draco says wearily, and unthinkingly, claps a friendly hand on Potter’s shoulder as he makes his way past. "Thanks, Potter. I’ll see you around."
It’s a pleasant morning, so they take their freshly baked croissants and steaming cups of coffee outdoors, to where the bakery has a single table and pair of chairs set up on the pavement. The buns are soft, warm and honey-sweet, and out of the corner of his eye, Draco watches Potter’s face morph into one of pure bliss after he takes his first bite. As he eats, Potter gives Draco a quick update: they suspect that the gang that infiltrated the Ministry had inside help, and they were definitely after some rare exhibits that the Division had in their evidence room.
“Cheers!” Harry says, and throws back the coffee.
“Well I mean I did, but they were always hand-me-down clothes that Dudley grew too fat for.”
"Oh right," he says stupidly, still in a sleep-deprived haze of confusion, "terribly sorry. Right. I'll leave you to your cupboard then." And he shuts the cupboard door on Potter's face once again. Behind the closed door, Potter makes a sound like he’s dying, and then the door abruptly opens.
But this thing—where he avoided Harry, and didn't allow Harry to heal his injuries—this was new, and Harry didn't know what to make of it. This was at odds with the Malfoy he knew, the Malfoy who had always played up his many little injuries, who had cheerfully complained as he made a giant production of his bruises and cuts, and who made Harry buy him a round at the pub in compensation. And here they were now, with Malfoy insisting that he was fine, except that he clearly was not.
“A Laughing Latte,” Harry says shortly. He always tries to keep interactions with her to a minimum.
“Yes, what about brooms, Draco?” Blaise echoes, smirking. Draco ignores him, the pest.
Now that he’s gotten one foot in the door, Harry takes the time to have a careful look around. The elusive back room appears to consist of two rooms: a larger one that they’re standing in, which is filled with crates upon crates of coffee beans apparently sent in from all over the world, and an unmarked door at the side. Harry easily picks out the tell-tale golden shimmer of a ward over the door, and he knows instinctively that whatever Malfoy’s
Fossey takes up the slack then, explaining that they’re a division of six with a miniscule budget, and Shacklebolt nods in understanding. He knows just as well how the Ministry works; Communications won’t deal with any of the smaller Divisions on the basis that their work is either too unimportant or uninteresting to merit any press, and leaves them to fend for themselves.
The next day, Draco comes into work late. He steels himself for Potter’s silence; for Potter to ignore their usual breakfast routine, and is relieved when Potter’s seat remains empty. He opens his case files and keeps his head down, works diligently at sorting out the remaining paperwork for the dragon case; at filing the appropriate forms for the transfer of the exhibits to Hong Kong for the triad trials.
“Absolutely not! Unhand me this instance: Malfoys do not get
“Thanks to you spoiling the market,” Draco says. He gives Potter a friendly shoulder bump, and is delighted when Potter blushes. “No five year old needs a toy racing car! At the very least, you should have warned me when I showed up with a toy bear, like a complete pillock. He’ll think I’m the boring cousin now.”
Malfoy immediately tugs his shirt down, but not before Harry sees it: a pattern of bruises starting from somewhere underneath Malfoy’s shirt, which creeps halfway down his left side. The bruises blossom against his pale skin like a poisonous flower in varying shades of green and yellow.
Malfoy finishes writing and looks up. “Well?” A smile. Not quite warm, but friendly enough, and one that Harry never would have thought would be directed at him.
Potter tries an
“It’s our galaxy,” Malfoy says before Harry can ask. “I went through a phase where I was really into astronomy at one point, and Mother redid my room as a Christmas present for my fourteenth birthday, and I know, I know, what twenty-eight year old still has astronomy wallpaper tacked up in his room, right?” He gives a short, embarrassed laugh. “Anyone would have taken it down ages ago, but it took Mother a tremendous amount of effort to do, and anyway, I like the reminder that there’s something bigger than us out there, and I guess I should probably stop trying to salvage my reputation here.”
this could come under the jurisdiction of the Aurors. I’ll speak to Robards about it."
Harry’s voice, when he finally finds it, comes out angry and clipped. “Who did this to you?”
“It smells so familiar. Like broomstick polish...and treacle tart,” Harry says thoughtfully. “And something smokey. It’s probably one of those trial coffees that I’ve tasted or smelled before, I just can’t quite put my finger on which one.”
, but of course that doesn’t do anything, so he crouches down and pulls out a rolled up leather kit from the endless depths of his Auror bag. "Sirius’ old lockpicking kit," he says in explanation and gets to work. After a minute, the lock finally turns with a satisfying click.
"Oh for Pete’s sake," he says in exasperation, after Draco makes another veiled insult about Weasley’s family and certain similarities to rabbits, and Draco scowls and demands, "Well what did you expect? What great plan did you have in mind, other than, ‘oh, let’s put them together and force them to get along?’"
“Nothing,” Harry lies, because he knows exactly how gossipy she is. Besides, the other Portraits are listening in, even though they’re all looking away and pretending they’re not.
"No, I was trying to apologise for last night, you git!" Potter has no such qualms about keeping his voice down, and his face is red with emotion. "That wasn’t how I wanted the first time I kissed you to turn out, and I was afraid that you thought that I only did it because of the potion!"
Cheng Wu calls in for more backup, and then everything’s done and over in another hour: the goons are locked into the Ministry’s holding cells and Unpetrified; the exhibits are safely returned to the evidence store; and Robards gives in to the combined pressure of Potter, Draco and Fossey, and sends a team of Aurors to join Draco, Potter and Cheng Wu’s team in staking out the warehouse for the rest of the day.
“Mr. Malfoy’s arresting grey eyes are wide with disbelief. ‘I always knew Harry harboured strong feelings for me,’’’ Draco says in a falsetto, holding one hand to his chest and completely ignoring Harry. “‘I just never knew that the intensity of his feelings was actually…
They head down the street to Draco’s favourite bakery. It’s a tiny place: the main shop is crammed with rows of baked goods on display, and a small dining room is tucked away in a corner that has enough seating for five. Potter shoots Draco a look that Draco pretends not to see when the owner greets him warmly by name.
“I’m dead serious, ask any of them. Don’t tell them I told you though, I’m not supposed to know. Here, take this.” He passes Harry a potion cleanser to drink. It looks and tastes exactly like room temperature water, but a cold shiver runs down Harry’s spine as he swallows. When he finishes, the world has gone back to normal.
. I’ll take your suggestion to Fossey, but I can already tell you her answer’s going to be that we simply don’t have the manpower."
“Daphne’s dating one of them,” Blaise says, as if that explains everything. He catches Draco’s elbow and steers him carefully away from the Gryffindors, who, as usual, have congregated around the food like a horde of hungry wild animals.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Well, why haven’t you put a magical collar on it yet? That way you’ll know where it is all the time, so you don’t have to hunt for it. Mrs. Norris will know that it’s a student’s pet and not to be harmed, and the collar will let it know to come to you when you want it. You could have gotten one at the pet store at Hogsmeade.”
Draco hesitates for a moment, before admitting, “I was thinking of getting a hot chocolate, actually.”
He watches as Potter’s face lights up, how his whole being radiates joy. Potter reaches out a hand and tugs Draco to him, and Draco goes willingly, disbelieving to Potter’s side.
Malfoy doesn’t answer for a moment. “No one,” he says evasively. “I did it to myself.” At Harry’s incredulous look, Malfoy sighs and elaborates: “Every time we spar and I hit the wall, or land on the mats.”
Prompt given was "Drarry - breakfast in the Great Hall".
Besides, there’s so many people in here, you’ll never notice an extra addition. Or five.”
“Well, alright then,” Malfoy says uncertainly. “Next Saturday then? Same time?”
“Go right ahead, Auror Potter,” Malfoy practically purrs. “You’ll find that the potions I’m brewing are fairly run of the mill, which any first year in Hogwarts should be capable of.” He waits a beat, smirking.
"You might want to head on home," Potter says, glancing over his shoulder at the rest of the team, who have begun to levitate the frozen human statues towards the door. "It’s going to take us a while to sort through the place before we can let you back into the office. Magical traces, you know. It’s a pain sorting everything out." He sounds a little apologetic, and Draco scrubs a weary hand through his hair.
It doesn’t take long until Potter’s cock twitches in his hand, and Potter gasps out, "Draco, I’m -"
“What?” Harry says, the world narrowing to a pinpoint as he looks at Malfoy. There’s a mischievous glint in Malfoy’s eye, but surely he wouldn’t be suggesting…?
Potter’s fast, but not quite fast enough. A bit of smoke gets trapped inside the shield charm, and Draco can’t help but breathe it in. It’s sickly sweet and cloying, like too much perfume all at once, and it makes his head spin for a moment. At first, Draco thinks it’s because Potter’s Shield charm is strong–it’s as if he’s looking out at the world through a thick layer of invisible jelly, everything slightly distorted and out of focus. But he feels it the moment his body abruptly relaxes and his mind begins to drift as he watches the smoke spread and fill the warehouse.
“As long as you’re on the grounds, I won’t poison your Butterbeer, but it doesn’t mean I won’t be rude to you.” He doesn’t add that rudeness is technically frowned upon, since the whole idea of neutral ground is to try and foster common understanding, not start a verbal riot.
. This cupboard is roomy, and fits the two of them easily.
It goes on for more than that. Harry spends a few minutes watching Malfoy struggle with an immovable tap before he finally gives up, glaring at it like it had mortally offended him.
“Yes, yes,” Sirius says comfortingly, “I’ll let you.” He waves his wand and turns off the lights, and is asleep within minutes.
Potter hesitates for the briefest moment, his lips inches from Draco’s mouth, his face hooded in shadow from the wandlight backlit against the floor, and then he leans in, closing the gap, his hands tightening almost painfully around Draco’s wrists. Draco feels the burning under his skin quiet down as soon as Potter touches him, as soon as Potter’s lips brushes his. Potter catches Draco’s bottom lip, sucking and mouthing it until Draco’s breathless, and then he licks his way into Draco’s hot, open mouth. Potter slides his tongue against Draco’s, and then licks up, over and over until Draco’s left shuddering up against the cabinet, mouth swollen and wet.
“What happened here?” Harry says finally, once he’s managed to find his voice. “Have you finally decided to give up on the coffee business?”
“Am I?” Harry had said.
Time passes by in a whirlwind of events after that: a mad rush as they get ready, Hannah briefing them on what to say and what not to say. Two o’clock rolls around, and they hold the press conference in the usual press room in the Ministry, Fossey standing up on stage next to Shacklebolt as he details the setting up of a successful joint task force with Hong Kong. The next part is unexpected–Shacklebolt pauses, looking around at the throng of eager journalists and the cameras flashing, and turns to Fossey and says, "I’ll let Director Diana Fossey tell you the details of the operation."
"Oh yes,
It doesn’t matter; Harry’s read and re-read the article so many times that he can quote it back almost verbatim. He grins at Malfoy, who narrows his eyes at him.
- send me characters and a letter and I'll write you a mini-fic.
Potter laughs at that, and pulls over a chair. His demeanour is decidedly warmer once he sits down and orders.
"A sensible suggestion," Draco says, which is how, for the second time in his life, he ends up finding himself in a cupboard with Potter.
. That was—well. He couldn’t very well yell at his boss for being far more perceptive than Harry gave him credit for, but it didn’t mean he couldn’t be annoyed about it.
“What’s wrong?” Queen Victoria says, and Harry looks over his shoulder to find her peering down at him as she adjusts the ruffles around her neck.
Draco turns, both surprised and unsurprised to see Harry standing there, firelight glinting off his glasses. “Potter,” he says icily. “What do you want? Isn’t it enough that you and your fellow louts have already crashed this party? Have you also come to witness my downward spiral into alcoholism?”
, Harry thinks. He drinks some more, and continues reading, and finds himself giggling at the financials that chart the rise and fall of the latest wizarding stocks. It’s dull and boring and a section that he normally skips, but somehow he can’t help laughing as he looks through a row of meaningless numbers.
“I’ve got the article framed up,” Harry says innocently, waving the Tattler at him and laughing when Malfoy makes a horrified sound.
Draco doesn’t need any more convincing. He all but shoves his way in and slams the door closed behind them, which Potter locks with a flick of his wand. Another flick for a Silencing Charm, and then it’s just them, and darkness, and silence, and
“Potter. Please.”
Draco thinks, and then abruptly drops that thought like a hot potato before it develops any further. He hasn’t seen Potter since the day he gave Potter a coffee in the lifts, and firmly refuses to wonder where Potter has disappeared to.
"Oh his plans are usually terrible," Weasley says, blithely throwing Potter under the bus. "He just goes charging in like he’s got nine lives, and it’s all
“Honestly Draco,” Blaise says, his sharp voice cutting through the chatter filling the Great Hall, “you’re an addict. No one below the age of twenty needs three cups of coffee to start their day. That’s just wrong.”
Fossey tells him, and Shacklebolt shakes his head. "We’ll have to look at that again, that’s just outrageous. That’s the Aurors’ yearly welfare budget," Shacklebolt mutters, and behind him, a Quick-Notes Quill starts flying across the page. Fossey gives them all a triumphant look and blows out her breath in a sigh of relief.
“–and the seeker has the best record—
“Oh Merlin, who let the Gryffindors in,” Draco says, appalled, when he catches sight of a familiar mop of black hair. Harry turns around just in time to meet Draco’s glare, a cup of Butterbeer in his hand, and gives Draco a fearsome scowl in return. “Sound the alarm, man the doors, we have intruders!”
It doesn’t take long for them to settle into a routine. Harry pops everyday in for his morning coffee, but that’s more out of habit than because he suspects Malfoy is
“Oh he does not,” Potter says, but he’s smiling. “He adores you.” Now it’s Draco’s turn to blush.
He thinks that’s the last that he’ll see of Potter, and doesn’t understand why he feels strange about it. They don’t owe each other anything, and it’s not as if they’re friends–they just grab the occasional breakfast and save each other’s lives every now and then, that’s all. And so what if he’s come to enjoy Potter’s company, and has gotten used to Potter’s shocking habit of flinching his food–it doesn’t mean anything.
Cheng Wu has to head back to Hong Kong for the press conference, so Draco volunteers to escort him to the Port points. Potter doesn’t say anything, just darts them a look and follows Fossey back to the office silently.
A month ago had been their last good day. And now everything’s shot and gone to hell, and he doesn’t even know what happened, and he’s alone again. Draco breathes out slowly and closes his eyes, cataloguing thoughts and moments: Potter’s hands on him, warm, and steady, and sure. Potter’s voice in his ear, ragged and rough as he asks quietly,
"Fine," Draco says with a calm sense of fatality, and expects the entire lunch to blow up in their faces. It comes dangerously close; Weasley makes little snippy remarks, and Draco finds himself falling back into that insolent manner that he used to put on in school, and Potter gets cross with the both of them.
“It goes on like that for a while. I used to spend ages trying to touch every one and memorize as much information as I could. It’s how I got top marks for Astronomy, you know. Well, that, and also because I am a natural genius.”
“I’ll keep that in mind.” Harry says, striving for calm and cool and collected. He mostly succeeds, he thinks.
“Oh, of course you have,“ Draco says, smirking, "on hindsight it’s obvious, isn’t it? You copied my every move, right down to two minions. Ooh, this is one for the papers, this is. I can see the headlines already, Boy-Who-Lived Confesses to Stalking Former Schoolmate. Exclusive interview with the harassed victim on page 2.”
“Fine!” Malfoy throws up a hand in exasperation. “I didn’t want you to worry, alright? You have better things to focus your attention on. For example, like getting a shower and then pissing off to the pub like the rest of our colleagues.”
A tendril of suspicion begins to uncurl itself, though muted under the general mood of cheeriness that descends upon him like a fog. He’s lucid enough to cast a quick counter-spell on himself, just in case someone Cursed him, but that doesn’t do anything. It has to be the coffee. Testing his theory, Harry pulls out the obituaries and finds himself giggling uncontrollably over the death of poor old Mr Lester Fisherman, who found his way back to the Veil whilst engaging in his favourite pastime of de-Gnoming his rose garden.
Based on a
!—in the league, he’s caught the Snitch—
"I’ve got one in mind." Potter grabs his hand and pulls him down the next corridor, then up a flight of stairs, and halfway down another corridor. He stops in front of a non-descript door built into the wall, and opens it up to another cupboard.
There’s no other word to describe the set-up that Malfoy’s got going on. A long wooden table sits in the centre of the room, filling up most of the space. On it are six cauldrons lined up side by side in a neat little row. Each has a number etched into the side, and all of them are bubbling merrily away under the protective shimmer of a ward. The cauldrons are matched by six small notebooks that lay open before them, and the air is thick with a mixture of exotic scents that Harry can’t quite identify. The rest of the room is filled with bottled ingredients, neatly labelled and carefully arranged alphabetically on shelves that span the entire length of the room. Harry turns, his eyes travelling down the shelves, and realises that Malfoy’s been watching him when their gazes meet straight on.
“No, I’ll try a Laughing Latte this time,” Harry says. His conversation with Susan is still at the back of his mind, and he’s oddly conscious of the wall of Portraits watching (and judging) him.
Harry laughs, and pulls Draco in. “Don’t,” he says, rubbing Draco’s back comfortingly. “It doesn’t matter anymore. Just, indulge me, okay?”
handprint. "
. He’s learnt over the course of several weeks’ observation that Malfoy is not usually a morning person, and on the few occasions that he does see Malfoy in the front of the shop, Malfoy’s always harried and half-awake as he checks on something or the other.
“How dare you, I’m brilliant,” Draco says automatically. Then he remembers who he’s talking to, and says, carefully, “well, you’re not too shabby yourself, Potter. Although I think you need to work on your compliments. You’re not very good at giving them. Although I do think I am very good at receiving them.”
“Was the taste off? Too much potion, not enough coffee?”
“Oh, we’re perfectly aware of that,” Draco says, exchanging a knowing look with Harry.
, and Draco gives him a slight shake of the head. Blaise shrugs indifferently, and turns away.
"Oh Merlin," Potter says, and a wave of nausea rolls over Draco at Potter’s tone. At the dismay lying underneath the words, like a landmine, at what they’ve
They Apparate into the middle of a street flanked by a long row of warehouses that sit silent and dark on each side like squat little toads. Potter hurries them into the shadows, and Draco immediately sends out Scrying spells. Little red tendrils tentatively sprout from the end of his wand before cutting off and disappearing into the shadows like smoke, drifting and twisting as they slide in under shuttered doors and through the cracks in the windows. They wait until each tendril comes sliding back, all of them white as they wind themselves back against Draco’s wand and slowly sink back into the wood.
Remus isn’t won over. “If you hog the covers,” he says as he gets in, “I
“And then you’ll sign?”
"I don’t speak English, sorry!" Cheng Wu yells back as he breaks into a jog.
. Told him it wasn’t; he ordered a Laughing Latte, and now he doesn’t like it.”
“Hi,” Potter says to it, and then to Draco, “how was dinner?”
“I didn’t
“A foolish name,” Queen Liz proclaims. Privately, Harry agrees. She goes on. “Utterly unbecoming for an establishment of this esteem, as I said to the young Mr Malfoy. But wisdom is a curse for the elders, for did he take heed? No!”
“I did. And I don’t mind.”
"Potter?" Draco says, and Potter looks up, a look of dazed confusion on his face that abruptly clears when his eyes meet Draco’s. A jolt of something hot runs down Draco’s spine, and he’s moving towards Potter before he knows it, his feet carrying him there of their own accord. His fingers are burning to touch Potter’s skin, to tear off Potter’s fitted white shirt and–
“Be careful? Be
“Oh,” Harry says. For some reason, his stomach does a funny little flop. “Alright.”
"Hang on, I’ve got to–" Potter says, and then he’s fumbling for his wand, tucked away in his back pocket. And then the moment’s broken and gone as Potter casts a wordless
His voice comes out slightly huskier than usual when he tells Malfoy, “All done.”
“How about your bedroom?” Harry says. “Do you have a tub in the bathroom?”
“Right,” Harry says, a bit uselessly. Disappointment rises in him now that he’s done what Malfoy’s asked him to and he no longer has a reason to be here. He puts the towel back on the rack as Malfoy stands, running a hand through his hair, and fully expects to be dismissed.
“I don’t care about Grim Graham,” Harry says impatiently, and Malfoy very unsuccessfully tries to choke back a laugh. “I’m going to need more than that. Have you been holed up in here all this while? If you were, how did you know what was going on outside? And what the hell is all this?”
“Open it,” Potter says from behind him, sounding eager.
Things more or less go back to normal after that. Malfoy gets the necessary license for two more Restricted potions after the success of the Confidence Cafe Au Lait goes viral. The Daily Prophet writes a glowing write-up, and the Tattler Magazine proclaims him one of the
“What’s your poison?” Malfoy says, nodding to the trolley of drinks that rolls up silently between their chairs.
Potter lets out a soft huff of a laugh as his gaze travels slowly up Draco’s body, until he locks eyes with Draco. A layer of Potter’s messy fringe falls into his eyes as he kneels there, his gaze dark and intent and full of promise.
“You don’t even know what I was going to ask,” Potter objects, but he’s grinning, and continues, “I was going to say, do you think you’d like to have dinner with me on Friday?”
"You wouldn’t just take," Draco finishes, and Potter glares at him and jerks his head in a sharp nod. They’re both panting, chest heaving with emotion as they glare at each other, and then abruptly, they both move at the same time.
Draco doesn’t react at all. “Did he?” he says blandly, and eats his dinner like his heart isn’t suddenly racing. “I really wouldn’t know.”
They open the door to the back garden to find it blanketed in white. It’s snowing again. Their shoes crunch on the frozen grass and fresh snow, chilled hands wrapped around their mugs of steaming hot chocolate. A flurry of snowflakes drift down to land in Draco’s hair, melting against his flushed cheeks. He sips at his hot chocolate as Potter fumbles with the bolt on the shed one-handed.
Still, he can’t help but laugh at the look on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy stares at him some more, his lips twitching. It’s strange to see Malfoy very obviously trying to bite back a smile, and Harry laughs again, because Malfoy looks incredibly pained as he does so.
"Oh, stop looking at me like that, I’ll get you another cup," Potter says, and Draco chews frantically and swallows his mouthful of food so that he can look down his nose at Potter disapprovingly.
"To a division under the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures," Shacklebolt says doubtfully. "Right. I see." It’s quite clear that he doesn’t.
wanted to impress
“No, that’s mad,” Harry says, laughing. “You’re having me on.”
Malfoy openly sneers as he says, “Oh please, Costa
“Ah.” Malfoy shifts slightly, his eyes darting from side to side. “Yes, well. Alright, there might have been something that I
Their wands clatter to the floor as their bodies come together in a rush of limbs. Hands tangle their way into hair, and then Potter twists them around, and shoves Draco right up against the row of cabinets with a dull clang that echoes throughout the warehouse. Potter’s got Draco’s wrists in a vice grip and pressed up against the cool metal of the cabinets as he leans in, his breath hot against Draco’s cheek. A thread of anticipation begins to thrum under Draco’s skin, intense and uncontrollable, like wildfire, like a collapsing star.
, of all people, wants him. In reply, Potter presses his growing erection against Draco’s thigh, and Draco breathes, "
Susan remarks on it one day, in one of the rare times when she’s behind the counter. “It’s so nice to see them making a friend. Well done, Harry.”
Now, Potter’s eyebrows lift, even as he begins to smile. “Isn’t five a bit young for a broom?” There’s a teasing lilt to his tone, and he looks oddly smug. Draco can’t puzzle it out.
“Potter, destroy that at once!” Malfoy squawks. Harry steps neatly aside as Malfoy makes a grab for him. He dangles the magazine just out of Malfoy’s reach, laughing, and Malfoy immediately fires off a wandless
After a few days, Potter casually asks Draco to join him for lunch with Weasley. Draco looks at him, raising one eyebrow incredulously, and Potter just looks back at him steadily.
"You git! Did you know?"
“Oh,” Malfoy says, flushed pink with pleasure. He smiles at Harry again, the uncertainty dropping away, and something warm blooms in Harry’s chest. He watches as Malfoy turns away and busies himself with turning on the taps and checking the temperature of the water as he readies a bath. There’s all manner of bottles lined up against the side of the wall that Malfoy takes and empties in. Teal-coloured foam begins to rise, streaked through with hints of silver.
"What– how–" Draco hugs him back, too relieved for words, and is startled to discover that he’s trembling from tension and the adrenaline.
Malfoy says it casually, but Harry can tell that he’s unhappy about his current state. Harry says at once, “of course. Anything you need.” He’s still damp from the shower, towel still wrapped around his waist, but he doesn’t give a second thought to his state of undress. “Let me see.”
he’s right, Potter’s a pain freak.
"So it wasn’t just because of the potion?" Draco demands. His heart is hammering in his chest like a hummingbird in a bone cage.
Harry carefully sluices water over Malfoy’s hair, and takes his time to lather the shampoo in his hands. Malfoy’s shampoo smells like lavender and pine, and the scent of it fills the room as Harry gently works his hands into Malfoy’s hair.
“Not if I see you first!” Is what Harry wants to reply, but he can’t quite get the words out around his mouthful of apple. He chews frantically, but of course Malfoy’s vanished by the time he’s finally ready to retort.
It doesn’t bother Harry, who spent eleven years waking up to a torrent of criticism and abuse from his relatives every day. Oddly enough, that makes the Portraits warm up to him, once they realise that he’s impervious to their taunts. The good thing about becoming sort-of friends with the Portraits is that they’ll shout verbal abuse at anyone who tries to sit at Harry’s table or approaches about getting an autograph when he’s just trying to spy on Malfoy in peace. The bad thing about being sort-of friends with a bunch of snooty Portraits is that they don’t spare Harry from their cascade of insults, although they’re far more tempered with him.
that leaves Draco feeling clean and chilled. He moves back as far back as he can as Potter tucks his soft cock back into his boxers and zips up his pants, feeling more and more like he’s been dismissed, like a transaction that’s just been concluded.
"Oh," Potter says again. "No, that’s alright, I don’t want to intrude."
," and it’s that little catch in his voice that spurs Draco on.
“It doesn’t hurt to double check,” Harry says, even as the spell confirms what Malfoy’s saying. What he thinks but doesn’t say is,
Harry considers, looking around the lab. “Every time I look at something, it feels like there’s a spotlight on it. Like I’m zooming in on that object and that object only, and all my senses are focused solely on it. Is that supposed to happen?”
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out as he turns the corner. He stops short at the sight of Malfoy, with his shirt rucked up halfway, trying to pull one arm through the sleeve of his shirt. Harry sucks a quick breath in through his teeth, and Malfoy twists around awkwardly at the sound.
“A cow’s diarrhea would have tasted better than that swill you just fed me,” Harry says meanly. “And if I had wanted to have cow shit, I would have gone to Molly’s.”
“What did you brew up this time?” Harry asks.
“I’ve got to go,” he says, more to himself than to the Portraits. They’re all too busy yelling at each other to pay any attention as he leaves.
“Uh huh,” Harry says faintly, and rips his gaze away with an effort. He stands up mechanically, and dumbly follows Malfoy back to the laboratory.
“Thanks,” Malfoy says, sounding amused. The next time when he taps Harry on the shoulder, he’s dressed in a white long-sleeved button down and loose grey pants. His hair is still wet and dripping, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind as he rolls up his sleeves.
pampered and spoiled,” Harry says, but there’s no bite in his words. He keeps working his fingers into Malfoy’s hair, running them carefully through the silky strands as he says contemplatively, “You drove me crazy in school, you know. You were the first kid I’d ever met from the Wizarding World, and I wanted so badly to impress you.”
Sighing, Harry picks up his coffee—the entire reason he came in the first place—and eyes it ruefully. Everyone says that Espresso Patronum’s coffee is magical, and it’s only now, on his third visit that Harry finally gets it. Susan had taken one look at the dark bags under his eyes and had recommended that Harry try the house speciality, an Espresso Patronum, and now Harry’s glad that he took up her recommendation.
Potter laughs. “Vomit is Teddy’s love language,” he says. “He’s remarkably consistent about it too, he always seems to be able to spit up just when you think you’re clear.”
"That would be the latter, actually," Potter says, grimacing, but doesn’t bother to elaborate further. He changes the subject then, asks them about the dragon smuggling case, and nods thoughtfully as Draco gives him a quick rundown on it. "So what happens once the tracing spell’s triggered?"
“It’s like a Christmas shop threw up in my mouth,” he says, once he rinses his mouth.
you.”
A few Saturdays later, Harry comes in to find the most intriguing scent wafting from underneath the door.
Draco snorts again. “I said I
“From a... friend,” Draco says evasively, smiling secretively down at the Horntail.
“No.”
“Oh my god, you lot would have made terrible spies,” Draco says flatly. Everyone ignores him.
Potter has kept his hair long and shaggy this year, and it curls in at the nape of his neck. The Horntail plays with it; snapping at stray locks and tugging at it with its snout until Potter winces. It’s entertaining to see how Potter lets his dragon get away with the most ridiculous behaviour, and Draco’s so caught up in watching this tiny lizard terrorize Potter that he doesn’t even notice the stares and whispers of the other students as they make their way out of the Great Hall and down a corridor.
Weasley nods at him, says, "Well, this hasn’t been
“The Manor doesn’t have a house-elf anymore,” Malfoy says, as they climb the staircase. “Tilly went with Mother to our villa in France. Mother needed taking care of more than I do, and Tilly was happy to go. She’s been serving the Blacks since Mother was born, you know.”
Next to him, Hermoine looks up from buttering her toast. “Is he?” She says in tones of faint surprise.
Draco ignores Potter as best as he can, pushes away the feel of Potter’s hand on him, Potter’s grip gone tight. Draco’s own grip on his wand is sweaty, and his pulse is rabbiting under his breastbone. There’s the sound of shuffling outside, muffled whispers, and then a distinct set of footsteps breaks away and grows louder as it approaches their location.
Harry gently sets Draco on the floor, head tilted back, and gives him two drops as directed. It doesn’t seem to make a visible difference, but Draco begins breathing easier, and something tight begins to loosen in Harry’s chest.
“Hm.” Harry scans the document, but he doesn’t understand half of what he’s reading. “I don’t understand half of what I’m reading.”
"Tell me," Draco says, because he can’t quite believe it, can’t quite believe that
Harry takes it and takes an unwillingly sip. It clears his mind instantly, the overly cheery mood that had loosened his inhibitions vanishing as if it was never there. He drinks until he’s sure he’s back to himself. “Malfoy, what the hell was that?”
!—over twenty-five—
"I-" Draco has never been in an actual wand fight, much less an ambush. "Yes," he says firmly, after Potter shoots him an impatient look, and the words have barely left his mouth before Potter grabs his arm and drags him into the cupboard and quickly closes the door.
That odd tingling sensation under Draco’s skin immediately flares up at the loss of contact. It starts from somewhere behind his chest, a tug that runs bone deep and down the length of his arms, and out of his fingertips. Potter must feel it too, because an odd, glazed look settles back over his features and he reaches out for Draco again with a frustrated growl. It isn’t until his hand touches Draco’s and their fingers lace together that Potter comes back to himself again, staring down at their joined hands.
In the end, guilt and a lack of imagination sees him turn up at the shop the next Saturday. He gloomily prepares himself for another tortuous morning, and opens the door to the smell of Christmas morning, six test beakers already waiting for him on the desk, and Malfoy beaming madly as he looks up from his notebook. There are dark circles under his eyes and ink all over both hands, but he’s practically radiating with excitement.
Malfoy picks up his eclair with his bare hands and bites into it. He hums happily as he closes his eyes in contentment, and Harry has to look away. He doesn’t know how he makes it through Malfoy eating an entire eclair with such obvious enjoyment and his chest on display through his translucent shirt, but somehow, he does.
“Oh shit,” Harry says, just as the glass slips out of his fingers and hits his leg before shattering on the floor. There’s a large wet patch on the calf of his jeans, and Malfoy’s staring at him, visibly annoyed.
“Well, if you’re done trying to pass beyond the Veil, shall we head back to the laboratory then?” Malfoy stands and stretches, lifting his arms overhead. The sunlight behind Malfoy has turned his entire shirt transparent, and Harry tries not to let on that he’s very obviously staring at the long lines of Malfoy’s body.
“Did you see what those petty charlatans at the Tattler did,” is what Malfoy says indignantly when Harry comes in on Saturday, a spare copy of the magazine tucked under one arm.
“Malfoy, I really don’t care about the state of your room,” Harry interrupts, holding up a hand before Malfoy can embark on another one of his tangents. “I just care about whether there’s a working bathtub in your bathroom.”
“Looks like he’s in a bad state,” the Crying Boy says. He wanders into the side of Queen V’s frame to peek down at Harry, and is promptly chased out by a flurry of indignant shrieks from Vicky. This sets off another round of bickering between the Portraits. Harry keeps his eyes closed as he listens to them argue, and keeps on breathing in the scent of broom polish, treacle tart, and the smoke of freshly roasted coffee beans.
Draco startles, and sits up. He had been so entranced by the dragon that he hadn’t heard Potter’s footsteps coming up the staircase, or noticed that the light slanting in through the tower windows had began to change.
“Can I get you a refill?” Potter says, which is when Draco realises that his glass is empty.
“Oh my god, Malfoy, are you brewing drugs?” Is the first thing that slips out of his mouth, unbidden, and Harry claps a hand over his mouth even as he cackles away. It’s a disturbing sound that he didn’t realise that he could make.
It turns out that Malfoy is still some ways from a best-seller. The first two versions make Harry’s eyes water as steam shoots out comically from his ears. It also makes his hair stand up from the top of his head, which sends Malfoy into hysterics.
He doesn’t really. Malfoy knows it, because he shakes his head and mutters something disparaging about Harry’s lack of respect for the fine art of potion-making under his breath before explaining, “When your base is unstable, it has the potential to turn into any number of different potions. Add an ingredient out of order or stir the potion one too many times and you could end up with a Shrinking Potion, or an Awakening Elixir, or something else entirely. That’s why potions like these are so hard to make. And that’s why I’m going to charge people an
“Right then,” Draco says, and he’s horrified to discover that he’s wobbly on his feet.
“Goddamnit Potter. Did any of that get in your mouth?” Malfoy says, setting down the beaker and grasping Harry’s chin with a thumb and a forefinger. He pulls Harry’s head down and peers into Harry’s eyes, checking his pupils. Malfoy’s too close. Harry’s brain explodes with incoherent yelling.
Potter laughs, but grabs two mugs of steaming hot chocolate off the table and hands one to Draco, who reaches past him to grab a handful of marshmallows piled up on a plate. Harry watches and copies him, and they grin at each other as they leave the kitchen. Draco takes a large sip of his hot chocolate, and is delighted to find it thick and frothy, just the way he likes it.
“It’s incredible,” Harry says again. Beside him, Malfoy beams at the praise.
clean it myself.”
Across the rows of lockers that stand between them, Malfoy sighs, a soft sound that stretches out into a muffled groan. Harry can hear the edge of pain that laces through it. Malfoy had taken a particularly brutal throw during the last round of their sparring. He had twisted in the air in an attempt to land on his feet, but had badly misjudged the angle and had ended up landing on the floor instead of the mat. There had been an audible crunch where Malfoy had slammed shoulder-first against the hard floor.
"I’m not trying to be nasty," he tells Potter quickly. He’s still confused, still holding his empty mug. "I only meant that you can’t move in here: I need my pot of coffee. You need to change this cupboard back to the pantry. Please," he adds politely as an afterthought, because Potter is looking at him like he's deranged, and he doesn't want the first time that they speak to each other after five years to end in a fight. Not now, not like this, over a cupboard of all things, when Draco just wants his coffee and maybe a good night's sleep, and to not feel like he’s delirious.
"And you’re apparently my stalker Potter, but we all have our crosses to bear.”
Potter wraps one hand around Draco’s cock and strokes, and Draco can’t help but let out a soft gasp, his hands tightening around Potter’s arms. Potter swipes a thumb over the tip of Draco’s cock, and Draco shudders, gasping again. Potter does it again, and again, eliciting a faint moan from Draco, and Draco can almost
“No, wait.” Malfoy grabs Harry’s arm. “You took me by surprise, that’s all. Wait.” He takes a deep breath to steady himself. Says, “When?”
Draco glances at Harry, and catches Harry smiling back at Hermione across the room. She’s giving Harry the same quizzical look, head slightly tilted, and he smiles at her, warm and fond, and shakes his head and turns back to Draco.
, and certainly this lot doesn’t seem the type to be inspired by any evil-doing. They’re all young, and jaded, and restless. Mostly, they keep to themselves and stay firmly behind the counter, so there’s no reason to talk to them unless it’s to order. They’re not rude, but they’re not friendly either. Despite him trying his best, he can’t get a single useful thing out of them.
Then he tips his head back and swallows. The coffee goes down sweet and easy, and he feels it kick in almost at once. Malfoy’s muttering, “I always knew he was prone to dramatics,” so soft that Harry shouldn’t be able to hear, but does.
"Found a cupboard we can try and hide in," Potter says, and Draco looks up from where he’s picked up a vial filled with a clear substance to examine the threads of faint green, silver and blue running through it.
A trail of lights immediately flick on, going up the large marble staircase that curves up to the second floor.
“The shampoo’s over there. Mind the mascot, he’s a saucy one,” he says, lifting one soapy arm to point, and Harry retrieves the bottle. It’s a French brand, and the mascot on the front—a shirtless man who keeps running his hands through his long, flowing black hair—gives Harry a little wink and a cheery wave. Harry settles himself on the top step, and sits at the edge of the tub. There’s a pitcher of water at the side, and Harry’s surprised to find a slight tremble in his hands when he picks it up.
“Besides your successful attempt in ruining my shirt, I’m fine.” Malfoy glances down at himself and plucks the wet fabric away from his skin with a grimace. Harry has to turn away at the sucking sound the material makes as it parts from Malfoy’s skin. “Don’t Scourgify that, by the way.”
It rolls over and gets up, arching its back like a cat as it stretches, and opens its mouth in a giant yawn to reveal rows and rows of sharp, tiny teeth. Then it spots Potter, and trots over happily, unfolding its wings as it does so. Draco watches with undisguised envy as it nuzzles Potter’s knee—if it could be called nuzzling—butting its head against Potter’s jeans; yellow eyes fixed firmly on Potter.
Blaise rolls his eyes. “I never agreed to those rules,” he says, but fills Draco’s cup anyway. Harry watches as Draco eyes the coffee greedily, a small smile tucked into the corner of his mouth. Draco’s always had an expressive mouth, a mouth made for sneering, for smirking, for snarling. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever noticed Draco smile before, not until now. It softens his face; makes him look gentler than he actually is. Harry can’t stop staring.
Draco went, and had, within the first five minutes, tripped over one of Teddy’s toys and broken it. Teddy had screamed and cried and thrown up on him in retaliation, and he had left feeling absolutely sure that he wouldn’t be invited again, except that Aunt Andromeda wrote asking if he would like to have tea the next week at the same time, and had added in a postscript that Narcissa was invited too, if she would like to visit. It had taken Draco a week’s worth of persuasion, but Mother somehow found the time in her alarmingly empty social calendar to attend. Mother was icily formal and stiff during the entire visit, until Teddy sat quietly in her lap and looked up at her with those big eyes of his, his hair flicking through colours as she gently stroked his head. She had thawed rapidly after that, and Draco had left feeling lighter and happier than he had in years.
The meeting with the Hong Kong officials goes well–they arrange to set up a joint task force, and send over a liaison to London for a month. Draco’s counterpart, Jin Cheng Wu, is competent, efficient, and handsome. He’s got a thick mop of dark hair that flops into his eyes–
that ripple down the table, wings outstretched and flared, and glares around at his housemates in as menacing a manner as a five inch dragon can pull off.
Harry scans the shop, but it’s just Susan behind the counter. Now that he’s had a chance to take a good look around, Harry realises that Espresso Patronum is subtly decked out in the Slytherin house colours. Sure, it’s got the usual wood paneling that every hipster joint west of Shoreditch seems to have, but the booth seats are a dark, muted green that matches the trim on the walls. In what Harry can only assume passes for a Slytherin’s version of humour, the door to the shop is located at the far end of the shop. Every customer who comes in is forced to walk past an entire wall of stern-looking Portraits, who murmur amongst themselves as they ruthlessly critique the patrons’ outfits.
“Not at all! Potter, what do you take me for?” Malfoy presses a hand to his chest in a display of shock that somehow Harry doesn’t buy. Malfoy continues, lifting a finger every time he makes a point. “One, we have a valid license. Two, we’re in solid compliance with every single Ministry regulation to date. Our books are audited every quarter by an independent third party appointed by the Ministry. And three, we
?” He looks at Harry, who looks completely taken aback, and nods to himself. “
Harry sends an Owl the next Saturday, pleading illness. He gets a concerned note back, with Malfoy offering to come over with food and potions. Malfoy’s tawny owl does not look impressed as it stands on Harry’s windowsill, watching as Harry scribbles out a lie that Ron and Hermione intend to pop by shortly with both, and not to worry.
“I’m watching Draco for signs of evil-doing,” he announces to the table at large.
"I did. Those were wards to keep us
Not that he hasn’t checked, mind you. Over the years, rumours had abounded of Malfoy swanning about in Monaco and spending vast amounts of the family fortune in one of the many casinos that had sprung up over the last decade like weeds. The casino had a vague connection to the family, or so went the rumour, and there were dark whispers of money-laundering. It was persistent enough that Harry had taken a proper look at it on his own time, and found nothing despite two months of quiet investigation and research. The rumours had died a natural death, and then rose up again several months later. This time, that Malfoy was in Asia, meddling in politics and signing deals with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. It had even made it to the front page of the gossip rags, but Head Auor Robards wasn’t interested enough to even bother entertaining the possibility.
, judging by the line of customers every morning. “Isn’t this illegal?”
to get away with free stuff again?” There’s a heavy emphasis on the word ‘fame’, his mouth curling in a familiar gesture as he eyes Harry disdainfully.
Fossey gestures for them all to be quiet, and they settle down after a few more raucous moments. "Thank you all for your very sudden and enthusiastic interest in the important issue of trafficking of magical creatures," she says, very dryly, and they all laugh. "I have one more important announcement to make, and then I’ll let my colleague Cheng Wu–that’s spelled C-H-E-N-G space W-U, family name is J-I-N–take over. I’m very pleased to announce that Harry Potter has put in a formal application to transfer from the Aurors over to the Trafficking of Magical Creatures Division, and that Minister Shacklebolt has approved his request. As of today, I’m pleased to welcome Harry Potter to the Division."
Then, whatever it is abruptly burns itself out and the smoke dissipates. The whole thing is over in less than five seconds, leaving the warehouse as clear as it was when they had first came in. Draco mutters a quick counterspell and breaks Potter’s shield charm, still thinking odd thoughts about Potter’s body, and all the things that he wants to do to Potter after pushing him up against a wall.
: they’ve been in the cupboard for only fifteen minutes, although it feels like it’s been hours. Draco’s still embarrassingly hard, but Potter doesn’t comment on it, nor does he offer to help. He just slips an arm casually back around Draco’s waist, and Draco doesn’t know what to make of
? I think not!”
the exact secrets of my formulas. Would you like a live demonstration as well? Perhaps I can direct you to a Floo later, so you can run straight to my competitors and tell them all you know!”
Malfoy looks slightly taken aback at how fast Harry assents. He slants a quick glance at Harry, his eyes sliding down Harry’s body, which reminds Harry that he’s still shirtless and clad in only a towel. He’s suddenly unsure of what to do with his arms, and crosses them defensively over his bare chest as Malfoy’s lips quirk up.
Except that he comes in the next morning, and Potter’s there, yet again, spinning around in Draco’s swivel chair as Draco comes through the door.
Malfoy barks out a laugh at that, his eyes flying open as he looks up at Harry. “
“No,” Malfoy says after a moment, which Harry knows means
. From Hong Kong. He’s on the dragon trafficking case." He doesn’t add
"Me?" Potter says, fury rising in his voice as he takes another step forward, and right into Draco’s personal space, until they’re practically nose to nose. "
“What’s the difference?”
Harry’s laughing again because Malfoy is ridiculous, and there’s a small smile playing on Malfoy’s lips. He shakes his head fondly at Harry, says, “Come on,” and walks across the room to open a side door that leads to the bathroom.
Narcissa had squeezed Draco’s hand, her grip almost painful, and Draco knew then that even Potter, cloaked as he was in all of his shining hero glory, would be hard pressed to save them. The wizarding world needed someone alive to pin the blame, and they were convenient scapegoats. On the whole, Draco couldn’t really fault them.
“Dinner was fine,” Draco says, swinging one leg over the bench. “What was not was your dragon being an absolute terror. Honestly Potter, it’s got no manners whatsoever! I think it nearly took Nott’s finger off at one point.”
“Figures,” Draco says, looking fondly down at the dragon, who is tossing its head in a manner that is very obviously designed to draw attention to the golden collar shining around its neck. A dragon after his own heart,
Remus tosses and turns for a while, trying to find a comfortable position. The mattress is old and creaky, and the springs squeak every time he turns. After a few minutes of this, Sirius sleepily throws an arm around him, anchoring Remus to him, and mumbles, “go to sleep, Moony.”
“How can I help?”
Draco ends up getting a faceful of carpet, and only realises the toll that the last few sleepless nights have taken on him when he reaches for his wand, fumbling between his robes, and it feels like he’s moving underwater, every movement slow and sticky. The air is filled with the sharp smell of seared lighting and singed ozone as spells fly overhead, hot and intense. By the time he gets his wand out and gets warily to his knees, it’s all over. Potter and a team of other Aurors are standing in a rough circle around three masked figures, who are frozen–literally–into various fighting positions, and the entire office is trashed.
“I may? How generous of you,” Harry says, teasing, and laughs. Draco would frown, because he doesn’t see what was so funny about that, except that Harry’s already pulling at his hand.
Cheng Wu’s team are clearly used to working together, and they separate into pairs and set about tackling different parts of the warehouse. Once they’re sufficiently recovered from their adrenaline-fueled laughing fit, Draco works together with Potter on the half-done potions that litter the table.
“Work here? Potter, I own the place.” Malfoy says it airily, like owning the second most popular coffee joint in London is something that everyone does.
"That’s not worth risking your life for," Potter says quietly.
“Brilliant observational skills, thanks for that, Potter. ‘
Draco carries on as if Potter hasn’t spoken. "–think you’re one to speak here. This is my case, and I should be able to handle it how I see fit."
“Oh,” Harry says, flushing once the full implication of what Malfoy said hits him. He looks around a bit uselessly. The locker room is as empty as it was a half hour ago, and it’s just him and Malfoy, and how would this work? Was Malfoy intending to strip off all his clothes? “Here? Now?”
At the end of it, Malfoy says, “Cheers Potter, that helped immensely. I don’t suppose you’d ever consider giving up the Aurors in favour of coming to work for me, would you?” He clearly means it as a joke, because he’s laughing at the notion even as he says it.
Harry fully intends to take a quick shower and Floo straight to the pub to drown himself in drinks like Malfoy had presumed, but the hot water turns out to be a soothing balm for his tired shoulders and his bad mood. It washes away both the dirt and the irritation that settles over him, and he doesn’t think about Malfoy, or about why he’s so irrationally annoyed at Malfoy keeping things from him. Harry stays underneath the hot spray, his mind a blissful blank, until his fingers begin to wrinkle.
"Sorry," Potter whispers, and there’s something frayed and desperate in the way he says it, in the way he tugs Draco closer, his hands skittish on Draco’s hips. Draco can feel it, the potion working underneath their skins, hot and itchy and demanding more.
Draco does. It’s a children’s game set of Quidditch, and comes with a child-safe version of Quaffles, Bludgers and the Snitch. There’s even a set of child-sized Quidditch robes, and Draco smiles as he shakes it out. It’s exactly Teddy’s size.
