"Right. Let's just...get on with it then I suppose." Harry grouched and sighed. "Four minutes to tell you my whole life story." He snorted. "The bloody rats in the walls know my whole life story better than me at this point."
Which meant Harry would probably have to either—Obliviate them or perform some other alterations on their memories.
Potter's eyes were soft when he looked at Draco and Draco didn't dare meet them. He should not have done this.
Draco couldn't believe how much his life had changed in the span of a single night. Couldn't believe he'd be fretting over Harry Potter, while sitting with the Weasleys in their home and being fussed over like a kid who'd scraped his knee.
Potter's hands slid down from Draco's arms to around his waist and he pressed them together, biting his lip again as his eyes searched Draco's face.
He'd have to pull quite harshly to get himself out of this predicament, which would probably wake up Malfoy, which would be such a shame, he looked so—gentle, the way he slept. Harry appreciated the sight.
Malfoy's breathing was quick and shallow, and his robes were torn at his shoulders, held up only by his arms pressed to his chest as he remained glued to the wall behind him. His shoulders were coming in and the seemingly infinite amount of feathers was tearing and molting out from the wings springing from his back. His eyes were wide and unfocused and he was trembling.
was. It was always deliberate, whether forced or genuine. There was nothing forcing anything, which meant that this had been a—
"Alright, fair, you have a point there, but it's something worth considering. He's been acting awfully buddy-buddy with you lately hasn't he? It's possible he might be harboring a bit of a crush."
"So sensitive." Malfoy grumbled under his breath, but Harry couldn't find it in him to get huffy over it. There was too much else to worry about.
He barely spared the dorm's decor a second glance. There were two beds with two nightstands between them, two desks and chairs, one couch and an adjoined bathroom. Pretty standard Hogwarts dorm, though they could've shoved Harry into a pigsty den and he wouldn't have cared.
Draco breathed and pulled away with a grin, and Harry's face fluttered, he pressed a long kiss to Draco's lips as he skated his palms lower and lower, parting Draco's pale thighs gently and skating his fingertips around his rim, carefully pressing around.
"In the olden days or arranging marriages, such bonds were created to kill one or both parties involved if broken to keep from any shame befalling the family's names."
Potter's face did many a thing after Salazar had spoken. He went pale, then green, then purple, before it all flushed out of him and he just looked sick. Sick, and silent.
"Oh yeah. I've set up a room in the attic. I'll allow the wards to let you back through when you need it."
Malfoy's eyes had gone wide again, one of his hands curled away from himself to sort of reach, as if he was reaching for something. Or someone. For Harry.
fucking moving again. Potter whimpered into Draco's mouth, the sound igniting something fierce and deep inside the blonde.
"I'm alright. Azkaban isn't nearly as bad since they abolished Dementors as guards." He shrugged and curled the arm she was holding at the elbow.
he was here, worried Harry might be dead, working with his best friends to try to save him, angry to hear he'd been mistreated when he was little—already considering him a
And seeing as Draco had looked so torn and glazed when Harry had seen him, Harry felt as though he should let some things lie for now, so he didn't exactly ask. He didn't know what was up anyways, so it would be okay to let it go for a bit, eventually he'd find out the truth he was sure.
It wasn't a story to tell the grandkids (if they ever got that far of course, right now things were still unclear, Draco shouldn't get ahead of himself, happy and excited as he was), but if nothing else, at least it was unique.
Turning back to look at Harry one last time before he locked him up, Ron's heart clenched at the sight of his best mate sitting on the floor chained to walls. He closed the door and clicked the lock.
"Hello." He said, for a moment able to imagine that Harry was there in front of him, responding and smiling. A deep ache twisted within him. "How have you been, Harry?" The wind breezed past Draco, only response to his pointless questions. "I've been—" What to say though? How had he been? He'd say he was fine, yet it appeared as though Ron disagreed, based on what he said yesterday. Did it really matter?
Harry held up his hands in a calming manner, about a thousand bricks falling from his shoulders now that he'd managed to wake the blonde up:
Sam wouldn't give this up yet. He didn't quite know why he wanted to push this through to the bitter end when Draco had been a right bastard, but he supposed he just wanted to stop the maniac before he fucked his way into his own alcohol induced grave.
"There's plenty of people. For one, there's you." It was a bit self-deprecating and pitiful, but Harry couldn't help it.
"So, I take it you've found a solution?" Lucius intoned as soon as he was sat down by his wife's side.
"I'll hex you?" Malfoy tried, but all his pretense of being serious dropped and he huffed: "Bloody hell, when I was turned into an animal." He gave up and puffed it all out.
Harry knew the feeling of his own heart tearing itself apart each time Draco whimpered in his sleep, him being unable to bring it up in conversation the next day too well.
sorry Harry—Should've told us about it—I—" She stuttered through her apology, and Harry lifted his head to shrug halfheartedly at her:
"Kreacher where the fuck is he?" Harry snapped when anxiety sharpened into blades within him and cut into his insides.
"Did you hear what we have to do you wanker?" Potter insisted on speaking, pulling Draco from his thoughts once more.
Murmurs of the break room wavered over him as he walked towards the counters. He gripped the kettle and filled it with a muttered Aquamenti, then set it to boil. Harry has a favorite cup—an ugly, Gryffindor red, chipped old mug. Draco pulled it from a small drawer the Ministry installed for such commodities, and stared down at it for a discombobulated moment. What was he doing? Harry is—The soft hum of the kettle interrupted his thoughts and he set the cup down on the counter, a ragged exhale past his lips, then poured the water in. Finally, he dropped in two teabags of peppermint tea. It was disgusting, but Harry loves the strong flavor—it wakes him up and lights up his eyes in the softest of ways.
The velvet night sky loomed high above Draco's head, stars like little white pinpricks in the endless dark. Cold, damp breeze wrapped around his lungs as he breathed, his city's cobbled walls rising all around him.
Harry figured that what mattered was that they resolve the conflict before it escalated into another duel, and he could feel guilty later.
Then again, he ought not to compare himself to Harry, he told himself for the thousandth time, their circumstances were vastly different after all.
"Where was the door to the Ancestral wing when you first saw it?" He asked, eyes darting around the house.
Harry slumped a little at ease. For a moment there he thought he'd have to go out and just buy a brand new bed if Malfoy was going to really stand against the idea, but he'd agreed in the end so things should be fine.
The blonde didn't say anything as a minute or two passed, he let Harry decompress a bit on his own pace, until he was finally ready to step into the living room light so that Draco could properly see him.
It was bittersweet and very underwhelming—the way nothing really happened, though Harry knew better than to expect anything to come off it, they'd only really taken the job so they could see Draco and Astoria again anyways, but it still ached a bit.
Harry had no idea, nor did he care particularly much either. He was happy being in love and that was all that mattered.
Draco headed to the break room, strode right past his office, just like he did every morning. Harry wasn't coherent until he'd had some tea. And he was a lousy partner when he wasn't coherent, so Draco made him a cup every morning. It was as easy to follow as breathing—though Draco found breathing quite difficult at times. Only when he thought about Harry too long. Which was always. His chest shrunk further, pressing into his lungs.
He looked at it closely and then incendioed it, erasing all traces of its existence. It was all the memories and plans of reporting and samples of magical signatures rolled up and squashed into one ball and extracted from the man's head, only to be replaced with the implant memories.
"Uncle Harry says it was dark and scary, when the bad guys caught him and auntie Mione and uncle Ron, they wanted to give them to Volde—" Teddy's brow furrowed deeply as he battled the word. "Voldremot." He settled on decisively, as if it was even remotely right. Draco certainly wouldn't correct him. "To Voldremot, but auntie Mione was smart and disguised Harry's face just in time!" Teddy paused for dramatic effect. "Then he says they were caught, and he says he was so scared he couldn't even move or fight them."
Hearing no response from her, he stood and stretched—went to the door himself. He wasn't in the mood to entertain any stuck up Pureblood assholes that might've come over for a visit to his parents, but it appeared as though he'd have to put a brave face on.
"Shut up." Draco hissed with no real heat in it, his face buried in Harry's wild hair. He held on tight. "What should we tell the public about your sudden disappearance?" The blonde mumbled when he realized that back in his world, this will be a huge scandal.
"You think that's weird? I'm such a lightweight I once got entirely drunk on grape juice, then proceeded to skin dip in the Great Lake, upon which the Great Squid attempted to eat me."
"They're still on his arse?" Ron piped in while devouring toast rather inelegantly. "Watching him now he acts more like an overgrown toddler than a dangerous Death Eater." After Ron's first initial angry outburst, he'd mellowed out as he listened to Harry and watched Draco himself.
"Harry's in trouble—You gotta come with me to help!" Ron forced fake urgency into his voice, feeling only the slightest stab of guilt for lying to his flatmate.
Suddenly the full moon comment made so much more sense. Of course Draco would more acutely feel that need on the full moon, when Harry was stripped down to the most barebones of himself.
Just so, Malfoy had finished his story, his cheeks tinted a slight pink—he seemed to wait for a comment.
"You'll leave here completely disfigured if you keep this up." Harry pointed out, but Malfoy's glare shut him up. It was sad to see really, how much of himself Malfoy felt the need to hide and lie about.
"Think about it! Draco fidgets around me, he's jumpy and sort of defensive and vague. He stares at me
"Yes, exactly. I don't think we can pull it through somehow though." Ginny reflected his own thoughts from earlier and Harry bit his lip. He rubbed a hand down his face:
"I want to take you out." He informed Draco, who then lost the battle with the dopiest, most struck smile Harry ever did see and grinned.
"The day I first came to Hogwarts. It felt..." He trailed off, but that was okay, because Harry knew the sentiment.
idea—?!" Draco hissed as he threw off his shoes and coat, storming through the house. "You can't just— just shove a
He was in an incredibly dark, spacious wing, with shelves of books and various artifacts arranged in wide spirals and circles around.
"Bloody hell Malfoy, you scared the shit out of us." Weasley muttered as he pulled Harry towards him. "Thanks for err, bringing him here."
Draco was sitting next to him, promptly ignoring all of them, and Harry did not know how to console his friend.
"What's happened to you? The sun's setting already, why were you gone so long?" Weasley nattered, his brow furrowed.
His body walked him along of its own accord towards a door Draco didn't recognize until it was too late and he'd already knocked.
"I'm a Gryffindor Malfoy, y'know, blind bravery and painful honesty and all that." She waved a dismissive hand. "Would I have offered if I wasn't serious?"
"Alright. So, in order to figure out what went wrong with the bonding, I'll have to experience it myself." Potter explained. "That is to say, I'll have to take Astoria's place and replay the bonding."
Draco pressed his lips together and glared a hole through Potter's skull, the bastard's eyes shining with amusement. Little shit.
Not to say she wouldn't of considered it otherwise, because she, out of all the returning eighth year students wanted peace most, it was just that she found it hard to conceive how she would manage such a feat as—
It was just that he now felt bad leaving Draco alone for so long at a time, especially since he'd most likely be out of range to stop any immediate outbursts.
Harry was silent for a moment, then, just like a stone dropping upon the calm surface of a lake and disturbing it, a decision was made within his heart.
Harry considered what to answer for a moment. He was well-aware anything regarding the war was a touchy subject, especially for the two of them, but they needed to sort this out first and foremost.
Draco reached out to wrap his arms around Harry's shoulders and pulled him down to kiss him, to touch him more, keep him solid and
Harry had actually planned on getting him some Dreamless sleep to ease the nightmares after the first time, but then Draco had actually began sleeping soundly through the night when they started sharing the bed that Harry had forgotten about it completely since it seemed entirely unnecessary.
No sooner had Harry decided to let sleeping dragons lie, did the entire house begin to violently shake. At first Harry was too confused to process the trembles and tremors going through the floor and walls, the rattling tables and furniture, but then it struck him that something must've gone extremely wrong with the magic of the ancient home for it to be quivering like this.
Harry's eyes wandered back to Draco of their own accord. When didn't they? He looked tired and—small, the way he was slumped over in the chair. Usually, Harry wasn't much for cold, hard reason and logic, he trusted his feelings and gut to guide him. But the tightness of his chest and the slow lump in his throat when he looked at Draco were not feelings he could trust. For all his Gryffindor, he didn't dare. To their credit though, most of the time they weren't there.
Draco felt the moment his skin went icy, entire body going rigidly numb. He knew what those wedding bonds were like, he himself would have had to take one had there been no war and he had gone on to marry the girl his father picked for him.
Certainly not the Weasleys. Perhaps some motel or something of the sort? Goodness that would be awkward, not to mention incredibly unsafe for everyone else there. If Malfoy was to have another outburst like this one, which Harry was certain would happen at some point, Harry would have no
Harry was left contemplating this. He was still hard and in pain, skin prickling with need, but looking at Draco didn't feel like he was drowning this morning, the way it usually did. So, there was some truth to Kreacher's statement that the bond wasn't as restless, but, Harry didn't understand why. His brows furrowed as he struggled to understand it. From what he knew, the only way to settle it is to have sex, but—
And Draco missed him. He missed him so desperately at times he couldn't breathe from it, but things would be okay regardless. He still had the feel of Harry around him to comfort and cling to when he'd feel the acute tang of loneliness too deeply.
As the ball went on, the girls lost sight of the boys, but they didn't particularly care at that point. They'd done all they could do and if the idiots couldn't cross the last few steps themselves—they didn't deserve any help anymore.
"Potter made his choice Draco. It is not your fault." He spoke somberly, calm as ever, as if he was wholly unaffected.
Christ, it would have almost been okay to make such observations about anyone else in their sleep, but Malfoy? It felt strangely predatory of Harry, like he was taking advantage of Malfoy somehow by—well, looking at him. Which was ridiculous now that Harry thought about it.
Echoed through the Hogwarts castle, loud and clear as a Sonorus. Everyone present in the halls and classrooms stopped and turned their heads about to find who had screamed that at the top of their lungs.
When their work day wrapped up, Draco made haste to leave. The day was tiring, mindless, just like all of them were nowadays. Besides, Draco didn't want to risk another exchange with Ron about matters that did not need discussion.
"Sure." He agreed easily and curled up into Draco. "I think it'll be time soon..." He muttered, voice a quiet tremble.
Kreacher shook his head, voice grating on annoyed for all the explaining and running around he'd been doing the past while:
He shook his head. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and set up a wand alarm to buzz after four minutes pass:
Harry took another deep breath and gripped his wand tighter for just a second longer, then pushed it into Malfoy's hands.
Currently, she was telling Malfoy about Harry's bad habit of leaving his things around and then forgetting where they were—and he was listening intensely.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle, "Well alright, fine, fine, you clambered up there to rescue a kitten, that's all well and good, my question is, why have you
The raven stretched and glanced at the shackles and chains, that Draco was only now noticing for the first time.
"Alright students, the class is coming to a close so it's time to wrap up. I won't be assigning you mountain loads of work for this course, because there's so few of you here therefore there's no such need. I do, however, want you and your partner to prepare an essay about the Internet for next time and turn it in. If you discover and talk about your favorite website, you get extra credits. That's all, you're dismissed," the professor waved her hand as the lesson ended.
Harry held himself against the edge of his wards, keeping himself inside the battlefield and making sure everyone else was kept out. He counted his breaths and kept his eyes shut tightly, wincing at every hex thrown about, every curse and insult exchanged. He gripped his wand tightly, but he didn't interfere.
awkward. He wasn't particularly good with kids. The last time he had to deal with them was when he was seventeen and well, that was frankly horrifying.
"How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people's?"
"He'll start Hogwarts soon, he'll get out there more and people will talk, about you and his family, me and his parents. I just want him to know the truth before any of that gets to his head."
An eruption of gasps echoed as all the Death Eaters drew their wands, though none cast anything, seeing as Malfoy's wand was pressed to Harry's neck, just like they'd planned. Voldemort stood, red eyes flashing with hatred, and Harry swallowed an onslaught of terror.
"Potter?" He finally managed to stutter—a longing rising behind his ribcage. He hadn't seen Potter since Hogwarts....
Harry sat on the bed, and thought about where to go from here. He was a bit miffed that they still weren't at least on talking terms. Things seemed to be at least partly okay now, at least for Harry, he was comfortable around Draco. At this point, it felt as if things were just stuck in place, and Harry wanted to move on from it. He felt as though things would revert back to being stiff and awkward the way they were at the start if nothing was done, and that was just walking backwards, which he was not down for.
However, the moment he touched it, he found himself recoiling as a mild Stinger caught his fingers. He looked up enraged at Draco—who was gritting his teeth with wide eyes.
After that night, the days seemed to melt by seamlessly, slowly bleeding into months until the day came they were all boarding the Hogwarts Express to head back to their school and start their 6th year.
Hermione, how could you have done this?" Pansy shook her head and scooted over to Harry to pat his back in a sad attempt at comfort.
Draco wasn't sure what to expect from the inside though. From how Hermione always explained it, it sort of felt as if Harry was always hugging them, his same energy radiating through the house and its magic, now that he was merged into it.
"The fact someone was trying to get in means it was necessary." He protested. "Besides, I said nothing when Ron was picking a fight earlier. That counts, doesn't it?" Harry mumbled as he sat down opposite Draco, who was still looking at him archly.
"There was a fight among the recruits. I tried to break it up but they wouldn't listen to me. One of the higher ups then came down and grilled me over it. He didn't even let me explain." He sucked in a breath.
"Let me get you a drink." Potter hummed and disappeared, without even asking Draco what he preferred, though Draco would likely drink anything Potter gave him.
"Are you going to say anything, boy?" Salazar tilted his head to the side after a full minute had passed by.
that Draco's part of the bond was untangled from Astoria's, it surged in a completely different direction, desperate and frantic—it rushed Harry, to snatch him and pull him in. Harry only had a split second to react as he opened his eyes and let go of Draco, cut off the connection between them and forced proximity into a wall. However as the bond had been flowing towards Harry—it slammed into the empty space and unsettled the air into rippling into a shockwave that flung Harry off his feet, straight into the wall behind him.
"Something about forced bonding and some such drivel—Honestly, I was swooning more so than I was listening." Tori laughed self-deprecatingly.
"Just because he physically isn't here does not necessarily mean he isn't still here in some other way. His magical signature is still traceable within the house so he's still here—somehow." McGonagall interrupted, pushing her spectacles farther up her nose, a crease in her brow.
They both knew how much Draco suffered nowadays. He barely left his and Astoria's wing of the Manor—event though the Manor is the last place he wanted to be. Narcissa knew this, she noticed and Lucius either didn't notice or didn't comment. She hedged her bets on the latter.
"Earth to Potter?" Draco was waving a hand in front of Harry's face and Harry startled from his reverie. They were sitting on the floor, drawing the rune circle necessary when it hit Harry abruptly what the linchpin of the ritual actually was in full force.
Whatever it was that Potter was doing, Draco couldn't be bothered with, as long as Potter didn't attempt to talk to him or Heavens forbid, befriend him.
Light fizzled from the tip of his wand and sunk into the chains, but nothing happened. That wasn't right...? The spell...the spell should have turned blue, not...What?
When they arrived Narcissa greeted them at the door and led them in. She had them sit down while she went to call everyone else.
Harry's heart twisted and he whirled around searching for Ron, who was attempting, and failing miserably to push everyone back and get them to stop fucking staring.
Harry endeavored to lift his injured arm, a sore ache throbbing through him as he pulled the motion, staring at his heavily bandaged arm up to his wrist, leaving his palm free. The bandaging was tight, but the finishing was sloppy. Panicked.
Potter was right there, smiling wide after he'd said it, the corners of his eyes crinkling with the genuineness of his lopsided grin. Draco wanted to trace that smile with his lips.
Just so, with such new determination, he pushed up on his elbows and had himself sit up. Something wet and sticky oozed down the back of his head, but Harry hadn't the time to worry about it.
Draco stared at them and thought about it for a moment. He needed a way to reverse the charms inlaid into the chains, to loosen when a spell is cast on them instead of tightening. How though...?
"Alright. Now." Potter murmured as he pulled his wand with his other hand and adjusted his grip on it. Slowly, he pressed the tip of his wand to the crook of his own elbow and started muttering incantations under his breath as he ran it down the length of his arm and towards their joined hands.
It occurred to Harry that maybe Draco thought Harry was ashamed to be seen in public with him. Because of Draco's past.
Harry had really hoped he could spend the rest of the summer break after the Ministry trials in peace, preparing for the repeat year of school ahead of him and laying the past to rest. Yet here he was, a week after those same trials, back in the same brightly lit office that made his eyes hurt, in the same chair he'd been in when he requested to testify for the Malfoys, being offered
Draco wasn't back in Azkaban, by any means necessary, and that was all Harry could stand to comfort himself with as of now.
Too much was at stake for Draco to gamble with luck, the price to pay was too great. Too many variables, things out of his control.
Draco's heart melted with a pang as he relaxed and drooped his weight further into Harry. He was so sweet and bright, even when faced with something like this, he looked at all the ways to make it easier. The swell of affection that flooded Draco was a dangerous one, so he opted to consider Harry's inquiry instead of paying it any mind.
It managed to mollify him, but Pansy knew that as the game got more heated, that lie would quickly grow null.
Because no matter what the girls did, if the two idiots didn't spend some time together, nothing would ever come of it.
Harry's good mood vanished however, when he walked onto the floor and found about two dozen of his colleagues huddled around something, whispers and murmurs tapering between them. What was that all about? As Harry approached and pushed his way through to the front, his blood ran ice-cold.
This had happened to him a fair few times in his previous department. They'd receive a call to the scene on a supposed Veela emergency, when in fact all the Veela wanted was to offer to be Harry's mate.
"Hello." He nodded his greeting, took a seat on the couch while Clara went to get Snowflake. She was wearing gloves for some reason Harry couldn't quite understand. As she carried him in, Harry noticed he had a small, blue vest on. There where words woven into it in bold white.
Slowly, Draco built speed, slowly he pumped quicker and harder and deeper, Harry grabbing at him desperately from beneath, seeking closeness, even still, even now.
Grimmauld was silent for a long time. Harry decided to start walking again. He was feeling more comfortable here now, almost as if he
He leaned over Draco then, slid a hand under his head and tilted it backwards, slipping the other Pain relief down his throat, then the relaxant.
Unfortunately these mobile thingamabobs were incompatible with magic but Hogwarts had managed to get a couple tweaked and operable for this programme, which the professor handed out to each pair as she talked more about the buttons on them and what did what, how it worked, yada yada.
That's when he heard a series of choked sobs off to his side. He slowly sat up and looked at Draco's bed. Draco was on his knees on his bed, bent over, hands clutching the sheets. He was crying, quite obviously.
"How did you do it?" Zach immediately sprung up like a bullet, and Harry sighed, but indulged his partner anyways:
This week: It’s time to play the Snatch Game! Our dolls face down some balls in the mini challenge, and show off their best cosplay on the runway.
“Portkey, please,” a wizard said to him, and Draco handed over the little rubber duck he had traveled with.
“Have your things sent to my room and I’ll clean them for you,” Draco told her, not seeing a big deal out of the situation. She had watched enough seasons of
Other queens seemed to recognize Ivana’s experience in this department, and started asking her more questions.
“Condragulations, my queens!” RuPaul continued afterward. “Oh, and remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an amen!”
As the closing music played, Draco danced with the others, grateful to once again have been spared from elimination. She still had no idea how far she could go in this competition, but she started to feel like she might have a future in drag — regardless of what the other queens thought.
“James, Al, and Lily were away at Hogwarts,” he continued, explaining to the grandchildren (and a few great-grandchildren who had snuck into the room when the responsible adults weren’t paying attention. “Draco had already lost his own wife, Victoria--”
“The judges said my look was too basic,” Lorena complained. “But I’m not into cosplay. I just wanted to look sexy.”
Last week on DDR: The queens lip synced and performed pole-dancing routines in a Rusical about '80s and '90s movie heroines! Draco did all right playing Cher from Clueless, but her "red carpet realness" runway look was...well, carpet.
Millicent Bulstrode peeked her head in. “So, drag can be about celebrity impersonation, can it?” she asked, a calculating gleam in her eye.
“That’s so stupid,” said Crabbe. “Ghosts aren’t that dumb.” This only made the ladies laugh harder. Aunt Aura fell sideways in midair and clutched at her sides.
“Ladies! You were all total stalkers! But one of you proved you’ve got total schmooze control...Venus Flygirl!”
He thought about the other queens’ strengths as comedy performers. Lady Cakes was a shoo-in, of course. Venus and Goldie had also proven themselves to be funny in the Snatch Game challenge, so they were also strong contenders for this challenge. Steve, Paris, and Lorena, on the other hand, were fishy, fashion-forward queens who had struggled to be funny. As for Kali — well, Kali hadn’t done well in either the costume challenges
Venus took a moment to consider the queens lined up in a row. “I’m going to go with...Kali Sister!” Kali preened to polite applause from the others and bounced over to stand next to Venus.
“It’s too quiet in here,” Paris declared at one of the stillest moments. “Someone start running their sewing machine so we can at least have some white noise.”
After what felt like an eternity, the not-Knight-Bus finally stopped in front of a hotel and Dave got out, opening Draco’s door and going to the back to remove his luggage. Draco closed his eyes and breathed slowly, never more grateful to have stopped moving. It took him a minute to figure out how to release himself from his chair strap before he could be free of the muggle vehicle of almost-death and escape its terrifying maw.
All the queens stopped to look at two men who leaned against a wall as the group was passing them by on the sidewalk. One of the men pushed away from the wall and faced them. He stood menacingly over Goldie, who started to tremble. Goldie, the smallest of all of them, in that moment reminded Draco of a little fish that knew it was mere seconds away from being eaten by a bigger fish.
magic. Even when she used actual spells, she was manipulating a silly plastic stick. The whole thing was just theatre.
He wanted to warn her that Kali knew that he was a wizard and needed to be obliviated. He wanted to find out if there was an update on his case before the Wizengamot. His mind continued to churn, overthinking and wondering what was happening back home.
The funny thing about trying to translate a phrase like “turn it on and back off again” into a language that didn’t have a concept for on/off is that every single person I asked gave me a completely different translation. Linguistically, it’s fascinating, and I’m grateful for every suggestion, even if I could only use one of them.
He brushed a tiny mote of soot off his robes and walked into the shop’s main room facing the muggle street, squinting as his eyes adjusted to the much brighter lighting.
Pansy leaned across the table. “Nearly every Slytherin of our generation was perved on by Melvin at the windows, though the merfolk tried to keep him away,” she explained to Harry.
“Hem, hem.” No one acknowledged the fake cough from Draco-as-Umbridge on stage. “HEM HEM! MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION!” she bellowed. “I seem to have lost my cat. Has anyone seen my pussy?” The audience laughed. “Why are you all laughing? Now, I want everyone to help look for my pussy. I LOVE PUSSY!”
“Now, ladies!” RuPaul called the queens back to attention. “For this week’s maxi challenge, you’ll need to razzle dazzle, mystify, and amaze — as you star in your very own...
Draco fell backwards into a death drop. From across the stage, she saw Queenie rip off her wig in a frenzy of passion. For a fleeting second, she wondered whether she should maybe remove her wig at some point, too, until she saw RuPaul and Michelle narrow their eyes at Queenie in disappointment. That settled that question — well, that and the fact that she had surreptitiously used a semi-permanent sticking charm when no one had been looking. That wig wasn’t going anywhere without a countercharm.
“Now, for the rest of you, it’s time for the judges’ critiques.” Acacia, Draco, Steve, Intoxia, and Lorena exchanged nervous looks.
Draco made tiny steps, almost hopping forward. She stopped halfway up the runway. With a dramatic movement, she strained her arms until the ropes broke. (They had been designed to be broken easily, of course.) She reached behind her and pulled at the stake, which turned out to be none other than her old Nimbus 2001 broomstick. She stepped away from the pile of twigs, held her broomstick confidently up in the air, and laughed wickedly.
“Now, your first mini challenge is going to be a time-honored tradition,” he explained. “You’ll each have a photo shoot with our photographer, Mike Ruiz,” Ru explained. The queens all clapped and cheered appreciatively.
“I thought they were love letters!” Harry cried, throwing his hands up in the air. “I take all of my pink and purple mail that comes in February and burn it without reading it first.”
Maybe being present for this conversation was Draco’s punishment for the crimes of his youth. He looked around the room for the Golden Trio. If he could approach them and bring up Crabbe’s request, maybe they could take care of the ritual quickly and he could make his escape. He saw Granger and a man who looked like a balder, paunchier Weasley talking with some Hufflepuffs whose names he didn’t remember — but no Potter.
“This was a stupid challenge anyway,” Cindy argued, wearing a tight, mustard-yellow catsuit with a thick dirty-blonde mane. “Who does RuPaul think she is, using
“Ladies, if you think you’re gonna barf, please aim for Donald Trump’s star. Thank you,” Venus advised. The other queens all cheered.
Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. How long had it been since he had last spoken with either of them? He hadn’t even been aware that they were having marital problems.
“She may not have had as much to work with as some of the other queens, but she backed it up with a funny little social commentary, and I like that about her,” Ross defended.
“She’s going to have a hell of a time finding someone on such short notice, isn’t she?” Scorpius added.
“Oh my God, who are you and what have you done with Draco?” Venus laughed. “This queen is acting goofy as hell! I have never seen her laugh so much. It’s like she’s never seen a magic trick before in her life.”
Harry paid up, took his seventy-five-galleon to-do list, and left Woodletter’s office feeling worse than when he had started.
“They read her for wearing a rectangle,” Lady Cakes explained, then laughed again. “So then Draco starts going on about how people look at rectangles every day or something and that’s why she made her outfit that way.”
“I think Steve is going to be in the bottom, too,” Intoxia said. “Her Statue of Liberty was a total mess.” She adjusted her own Liberty crown, as if to prove hers the superior look. Acacia raised an eyebrow at her from under her own, more elaborate Lady Liberty crown.
The queens each had a turn dancing to one of RuPaul’s latest singles (now available on iTunes, of course). It had a twangy quality completely alien to anything Draco had ever heard before. She cheered the others as they boot-scooted and performed all manner of moves that may or may not have had anything to do with country dancing.
“I’m afraid I can’t stay,” Narcissa continued. “But I wanted to let you know that I’ve been watching your performances. I’m so
Draco glared at the stuffed animal, as if it were hiding the answers he needed. “I honestly have no idea.”
RuPaul just laughed. “Well, we’ll leave you to it. Just find a way to be funny,” he advised, and walked away with Bianca to turn the spotlight onto Goldie.
“Yeah, the owls are a problem.” Villareal sighed. She had approached Draco just minutes after he had started flying around the San Adra Quidditch Park for his morning laps.
She probably should have warned Harry about it first, however. It was too late when the other wizard entered the room and gasped in shock. His face went white and he absently rubbed the back of his hand.
“That’s brilliant,” Draco said absently. His knees were starting to get sore from kneeling on the stone hearth. If Crabbe’s afterlife was largely spent listening to muggles read novels, it’s no wonder he was ready to off himself all over again.
“May they enjoy an eternity in each other’s company, with plenty of goth romance and ghost sex,” Draco added, then frowned. What had possessed him to talk about ghost sex?
“That’s right! For this week’s maxi challenge, you will each present three different looks on the runway. Hash tag: #DragRace.
Most of them were quite dark even for Malfoy standards. He had found multiple instructions on rites for preventing someone from moving on to the afterlife when they died for various nefarious purposes — the weirdest of which was on using spirits as sources of energy in the kitchen.
Once everyone stood in a single line, RuPaul held out a hand mirror. “Now, let’s take a look at each of your faces!”
The queens laughed and applauded. Katya waved and headed for the door. “Goodbye...goodbye...goodbye,” she smiled maniacally as she exited.
, and now we have hot, sexy manmeat and balls flying all over the place.” He laughed. “How are we supposed to concentrate on the rubber balls again?”
“When Voldemort killed me,” Potter clarified in a way that wasn’t any clearer at all. “Of course, when I saw Dumbledore in King’s Cross Station afterwards, he said he didn’t think I was dead. Maybe that’s why it was so easy for me to come back to life.”
One by one, each queen looked in the mirror and assessed their partner’s work. The reactions varied.
By this point, Draco found the script page that showed a photo of the character in question. Draco was ready to be a team player. Draco was up for any challenge.
“Ladies, I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul told them. “Goldie Hanako, you are safe.” Goldie nodded and went to the back of the stage.
Last week on DDR: Draco wins the reading mini-challenge! The queens prepare stand-up routines for the main challenge, and Draco has to learn how to use a microphone. Kali wins, Steve sashays.
“It’s important to represent one’s country well,” Draco explained. “I’ve heard some Americans have what they call a tramp stamp, so I’ve got myself a little slag flag to show my national pride.” The judges chuckled. “What’s not to like?” she added.
Hermione Granger and Millicent Bulstrode strode purposefully into Draco’s drag room at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, both of them smiling broadly as Millicent slammed a small flyer onto Draco’s vanity.
“Welcome back, ladies,” RuPaul addressed the queens when they returned to the stage. “The votes have been tallied. Lady Cakes McMansion, you created a character who was ahead of your time...but your look on the runway tonight felt...dated.” Lady Cakes nodded. “You’re safe.”
Malfoy’s left eye twitched. He stared at Harry for several long, pointed seconds, while Harry tried not to squirm. Why was Malfoy making him feel this nervous?
“Draco! Watch me! Look, I can death drop! Draco! Are you watching?” Teddy flopped backwards onto the floor. “Did you see it?”
The runway theme that week was Parisian Chic. Draco had opted for a full-length art deco-style gown embroidered with golden peacock feathers and a line of silk roses along the bottom hem. She had styled her wig into an elaborate French twist.
The judges turned their attention to the six remaining queens, who represented the top three and bottom three for the challenge. Draco quickly looked at the others from the corner of her eye. Goldie and Lady Cakes had both managed to turn out stunning garments, and the judges appropriately praised their looks. The other queens’ looks weren’t impressive to Draco’s eye at all, however. Maybe, despite her worries over not having enough fabric and not knowing what to do with that blasted koala, Draco had made it to the other top three slot after all.
Draco started rifling around the werkroom in search of a pen. After a few minutes, he plucked the pheasant feather out of the hat he had worn in the Red Carpet Realness challenge. He grabbed a pair of scissors, and, taking one of the scissor blades, began shaving barbs off the bottom few inches. He then cut a small bit off the bottom at an angle until it resembled a writing quill.
“Well, I’m not religious, you see,” Draco tried to explain. “So I’m not one to say things like ‘Thank God’ or the like. While I’m on this show, I want to keep my exclamations drag relevant.”
The rest of the trip back to the hotel was uneventful. Draco crashed hard for a painfully limited amount of time before having to get up again for Elimination Day. He had never felt more grateful to have doses of hangover potion and pepper-up potion on hand as he did that morning.
Harry seemed to sense her discomfort and slipped his hand around hers. She gave him a weak smile in return.
“Hey there, presidential squirrelfriends!” RuPaul entered the workroom with an older blonde woman in a pantsuit. She smiled and waved at the queens.
“I’m fine,” Lady Cakes muttered, struggling to remove a lumpy black leather fingerless glove. He hissed.
And so, Draco had started slinging cake like a five-year-old throwing a tantrum. He had to admit it wasn’t a very dignified look. And an even worse first impression, especially considering how the act had come to bite her in the arse during the sewing challenge. No, he had to credit the muggle queen for winning that round.
“You can be sexy, just don’t deep-throat a chicken on national television, okay?” Michelle explained. This didn’t make Lorena feel much better, as she had been counting on chicken fellatio to be her biggest contribution to the commercial.
“Maybe we should tell them,” Paris said, then turned to the audience. “Do y’all want to know what happened?”
“Oh my god, what happened to the mirrors?” Kali Sister exclaimed. A few queens gasped in horror. All the mirrors in the werkroom had been covered in black paper.
Draco frowned. He vaguely remembered seeing a letter from Hogwarts on the mail tray the day before, but assumed it was the list of materials Scorpius would need for school shopping. He groaned internally.
Draco looked up to see Cindy Sanchez looking over at his table. She pointed at something on Draco’s small piece of white fabric. Draco looked where she was pointing and saw a big brown smudge about a third of the way from the edge of the fabric.
Steve laughed. “What? No I didn’t! It was just me and Ivana and Draco. I would have remembered if we saw an owl!”
“Kali is serving Jameela Jamil by way of Dick Van Dyke,” Lady Cakes laughed. “It’s a jolly ‘oliday with Kali!”
“Don’t worry, no one’s gonna go hungry,” Lady Cakes interjected. I’m gonna be feeding everyone with my

(And please vote in the local elections too, because not voting is how we get so many fuckwits on city councils and in judges’ seats, let alone the White House.)
“This is all very creative, but we need to avoid mentioning the Smurfs,” Michelle told him. This time, Draco looked confused. “I don’t think we can get the copyright clearance for that.”
“The koalas are getting smarter,” Draco continued. “Every time you open your mouth, a koala reaches in and steals another tiny handful of your brains.” The others laughed.
Draco felt...odd. This wasn’t really happening. Potter wasn’t supposed to...what? Approach him? Talk to him like a friend? Ask him out for drinks like this was some kind of date?
“I don’t think it’s going to work,” Granger-Weasley said. “I think the room is too glitchy to make it happen correctly.”
surprise her were the sickles and knuts that a few wizards and witches tossed onto the stage during her number.
The next morning, Auror Heather Villareal was waiting for him at the San Adra Quidditch Park when Draco went out for his morning fly.
“So, who do you think will be in the bottom two?” Draco asked once they were seated in the Untucked lounge. She took a genteel sip of her drink.
Draco frowned. Goyle hadn’t mentioned anything about being haunted by their late friend. Not that they had really spoken with each other in a while, though. How long had it been?
The camera panned out to reveal that Narcissa was sitting on a sofa next to Draco’s Aunt Andromeda, who smiled and waved. Next to her was Teddy, practically bouncing in his seat, smiling and waving as hard as he could from underneath a turquoise bouffant. And next to him was Harry — Harry, who continued to stun Draco with his unflagging love and support.
Harry was experiencing a private internal meltdown, too distracted by those pink lips and the little vee of Malfoy’s neck not obstructed by his collar to fully process what the other man was saying.
“A small, controlled burn should do the trick,” Granger-Weasley answered. Maybe she had read his mind. “There’s not much left in here to burn, anyway.”
“I think it’s sad that so few people in the LGBT community are registered to vote,” Paris added. "The people leading this country are making decisions that affect our civil rights, and even our very lives, and we can’t afford
“RuPaul, I am a man in my eighties. And at my age, I find that I don’t care as much about formal titles as I used to,” he explained. RuPaul nodded. “So you can call me Jiggly, just as long as you call me.” RuPaul laughed.
“This song isn’t about shablams,” Draco explained. “It’s about being so crazy, stupidly in love that you see everything through rose-coloured glasses. It’s about finding a love that gives you so much hope after you’ve lived through a really dark time, and you don’t care if it makes you look like a fool.”
After a few more episodes, Draco had settled into the pattern of challenges and felt more at ease in her ability to excel as a drag performer. True, she had delivered a train wreck of a performance in the cooking challenge, but she had been distracted by her concern over the court case and losing his identity as a Malfoy. That was now over and done with, and there was nothing left but to move forward and give her full concentration to
She beamed at the panel of judges as she glided down the runway, arms stretched gracefully out to either side like a dancer. Her dress was a panel of lightweight white fabric with a small gold chain clasping at both shoulders and wrapping around the neck like a halter top, pooling in front to create a draping neckline. A gold belt cinched it at the waist. The skirt hung down to mid-thigh. Her blonde wig was swept into a curly updo
“Dean! Mariah!” Harry called out, rushing heroically into the storefront, pulling Draco by the hand. He thrust Draco’s phone onto the counter. “We got your message. What do we do?!”
,” Draco continued, wrinkling her nose, “It seems I have a bit more studying to do. Do excuse me while I run through my Lady Goggle lyrics a few more times.” With that, she got up and wandered over to a vanity, where she picked up a glowing rectangle and extendable ears (or whatever the muggles called them) and tuned out the other queens.
Paris-as-Beyoncé fixed RuPaul with a chilly look. “I care not for the affairs of these mortals. I just wrote down
A few minutes later, Team Paris went to their own rehearsal, and Team Venus collapsed into chairs and took off their heels, rubbing sore feet.
“Hey ladies!” Ross Matthews greeted them from a director’s chair behind the camera. Next to him was Michelle Visage.
” Lady Cakes sniffled softly into his shoulder. “I don’t know what’s in that stuff you gave me, but my wrists feel a hundred percent better this morning.”
“If you couldn’t make Carrie Fisher funny, maybe you should have chosen someone else to impersonate. I thought about doing Lizzo,” Lady Cakes admitted. “She is glamorous, talented, and bootyful!” The others laughed as she made a hand gesture toward her own generous figure. “But I had trouble making her funny when I practiced it, so I went with Nicole Byer instead.”
“Kali Sister, you are safe. You may join the other girls.” Kali cried and thanked RuPaul before walking back.
“For my beach blanket realness look, I’m going for practical attire,” Draco explained. “The sun is not my friend, so it’s important to cover up.”
,” Draco interrupted. “Starsss. Galaxiesss. Bitch, I have my own constellation!” With that, Draco crossed her left hand to her right hip and began tracing the arc of the constellation Draco up, over her head, down the other side, and back up, ending with a snap of her fingers.
Draco dressed in a floral-print blazer with a pale pink scarf and ear-length gray-blonde bob. She had painted her face with lines to imitate the wrinkles of an octogenarian woman. Next to a name card that read “Mary Berry” in a pretty cursive was an oversized wine goblet that appeared to hold an entire bottle of chardonnay.
Draco sat delicately on the edge of a fainting couch. In front of her, a tea set complete with a platter of chocolate cake and tea for two sat on a little tea table.
Draco smiled. “Thanks,” he said. “Now cut it out, I’m trying to apply eye makeup.” The other queens laughed.
Draco turned her head when she felt Harry slip his hand in hers under the table. She squeezed back, releasing a faint gasp when she saw the look on his face.
“And then Theo, Blaise, Millicent, Pansy, Daphne…” Crabbe counted on his fingers. “Marcus, Anthony — you know, he used to help me with Charms — and, oh yeah, George and Ron.”
“Hello, Granger-Weasley,” Draco replied. “I was hoping to talk with the three of you, actually.” He looked at Potter and Weasley in turn. Weasley looked up from his food. “And Goyle,” he added. Goyle looked up and came closer to their little circle.
For a lot of the queens, this challenge seemed to imply fairly pedestrian outfits and belts with oddly shaped little bags on them. Intoxia and Goldie both wore giant mouse ears.
“None — they all had heart attacks and died the moment they saw her walk out here,” Carson Kressley quipped.
“Indeed! These are all going to be fixed in a circle, and you’ll see Stonehenge as it’s meant to be seen, complete and pristine.”
Which is why Draco now frowned at the Buffy the Vampire Slayer costume on his clothing rack. The idea of playing that type of character felt like a slap in her face. But what other choice did he have? It’s not like he knew that many fictional characters in muggle culture. Almost all of his exposure to muggle arts had been reality television programming.
Goldie tossed a little red parasol off the stage as Lorena posed, her profile facing the judges. The
One week later, Harry received the owl to let him know that Malfoy had the documents ready for his signature, and to come to his office.
“Thanks! I swear it won’t happen again.” Kali grinned. “So, what do you think we’ll have to do for this week’s episode? I hope it’s not another sewing challenge!”
Intoxia, despite the name, had turned out to be a lightweight, and threw his arm over Draco’s shoulder as they stumbled out of their last bar. Draco had to half drag him along as they trailed behind the others on the walk back to the hotel.
As the queens got out of drag and prepared to go back to the hotel for the night, Draco looked around the room. The past several weeks had felt like an intense journey in multiple ways. His approach to drag had grown and stretched with each challenge, for one. He wasn’t sure he would even recognize the queen who had entered the workroom in the first week.
“Is that really Kali’s idea of a British accent?” Draco asked in disbelief. He smirked. “I say, maybe she’s from western Britain —
“You’re so pale,” he commented, contouring lines onto the blond’s face. “When you go outside, does your skin just, like, burst into flames or something?”
know of any spell that would help a ghost move on to the spirit realm, or wherever else they might end up?” Draco asked. He didn’t have much faith in getting an answer, but he might as well cover his bases.
audition,” Draco told Blaise by way of an explanation as they heard loud clanking and rattling of pots and pans as they approached.
take the fun out of it, wouldn’t it?” Draco sighed. He hastily finished his business and left, leaving Crabbe to float after him down the hallway.
Draco spent much of the next day ensconced in the Malfoy Manor’s extensive library surrounded by books on rituals dealing with ghosts. He wasn’t entirely sure why he was so willing to help Crabbe move on. Maybe it was because Crabbe had been so helpful to him during their Hogwarts years, when Draco was young and felt like he needed a bodyguard. Maybe he felt that helping Crabbe was the least he could do after forcing him to polyjuice into a first-year girl so often while he was fixing the vanishing cabinet in Sixth Year. Or maybe he didn’t fancy the endless haunting Crabbe would inevitably pursue until he got his way.
Malfoy jerked his face back towards Harry and schooled his features. “Let’s meet again tomorrow morning after you’ve collected the forms.”
“All right, ladies,” RuPaul said, “Loretta Lynn would be so proud. But two of you really danced the barn down: Venus Flygirl—” Venus shimmied her shoulders prettily as the others hooted and applauded— “and Paris Davenport.” Paris preened as she received her own applause.
“I’m giving you Stonehenge as it was meant to be seen,” Draco said. “This is no pile of fallen rocks, but a vibrant work of art.”
Draco had no idea what any of it meant, but she did as asked, serving her best duckface while posing in front of a ballot box.
“Yeah, you’re giving me this romantic mitosis fantasy moment — or is it meiosis?” asked special guest judge Neil Patrick Harris. The judges laughed. “I can’t remember my biology!” He shook his head. “Anyway, I’m living for it.”
Draco scoffed. “I can’t recommend being in the bottom,” she said. “Especially not in the first week! I was half ready to start singing ‘Ru Save the Queen’ if I thought it could have kept me from going home.”
“It’s not a bustle; it’s a bum roll!” Aura retorted as she followed Burbage and Crabbe through the closed window.
“When’s the last time we talked?” Goyle countered. “I’ve lost touch since you didn’t come to my last graduation party.”
At the front of the runway, Draco spun around once before pretending to dip, her right side facing forwards while arching backwards gracefully. She rose back up and tangoed out to the right side of the stage, then spun and tangoed to the left side and bowed. Draco then tangoed back to the middle and performed an elaborate triple spin before tangoing back up and offstage.
“Oh, don’t worry about it — just a few of the old crowd speculating on whether you’d show up tonight.” He maneuvered Draco until they were in the Great Hall. “Look who’s here, everyone!”
“Welcome back to Smells Like Fish!” Acacia began again. “Today, I’m here with Draco, who’s going to show us how to make a basic hangover
That left Draco and Ivana Mann as the last two queens. The Rusical episodes were typically challenges that required a lot of dancing and physicality. Surely Draco’s lip sync performance had proven her abilities to the others. And considering that she was half Ivana’s age, that had to count for something, right?
Carrie Fisher. I didn’t want to disrespect her memory by making a lot of stupid jokes at her expense,” she huffed.
“Let’s talk about this ritual,” Granger-Weasley said. As much as Draco was grateful for the change in topic, this wouldn’t do.
“I am positively floating down the runway, and I am determined to convince the judges of what I can do with just a little fabric,” Draco told the camera. “My look is a Greco-Roman-style chiton with a halter neckline, and I know I am showing my naturally exquisite body in its best light. My outfit makes me look like a goddess in the front...and just a bit naughty in the back,” he added with a sly grin.
“Draco!” A very drunk Theo Nott cheered. “Good to see you, old chap! I was just stepping out for some fresh air, but now you’re here, I need to show you off. I won the betting pool!”
“All right, it’s time to hear the candidates’ closing statements,” RuPaul said. “Let’s begin with Venus Flygirl.”
“I’m afraid that’s not a match. Nicole Byer, those sexy Kardashian sisters are starring in a new sci-fi epic, called Star
“All of you are safe,” RuPaul told them, “None of you are the worst — but none of you are the best, either. Try harder next time. Now, leave the stage.” Each of the safe queens exited in single file to the Untucked lounge.
“If I go home on a comedy challenge, I’ll never live it down,” Lady Cakes told the camera. “I have got to lip sync for my motherfuckin’ life!”
Steve, on the other hand, received criticism for her failure to lead the group — partly by letting Acacia get away without cooking anything, and partly for not doing a better job to control the train wreck that was Draco’s part of the act. It seemed unfair to Draco, but Steve then received high praise for her eighteenth-century Parisian courtesan look on the runway.
“Bugger,” Harry sighed. He set the bottle and tray on the vanity. “In my defense, it’s really hard to talk to you in that costume!”
Draco raised a delicately painted eyebrow. “You can take it off of me later,” she purred. Harry gave her a feral grin.
“All right, just between us squirrelfriends, what do you think?” RuPaul asked the other judges. “Let’s start with Draco.”
“Say, shouldn’t you have a Hogwarts reunion coming up?” Professor Burbage tapped her finger on her chin.
Draco decided that she might as well go full-on Trelawney, as her main source for psychic fashion, and smeared on some messy makeup before adding a tangled dirty-blonde wig and enormous glasses.
“Girl, you need to fix that bottom seam, ‘cuz that meaty tuck of yours makes you look like you’re wearing a diaper!” Cindy Sanchez laughed.
“That’s crazy. I’m gonna be the youngest, most beautiful candidate ever,” Lorena preened, stroking imaginary hair above her shoulder.
I’ll confess — writing this chapter was definitely a challenge! Now I get why so many funny queens have gotten really freaked out about choking on the Snatch Game. It’s one thing to come up with something that you think is funny, and if other people laugh, that’s great — but it’s not always easy to know that other people will laugh. And writing that other characters are laughing at the jokes is such a gamble because readers might think, “Hmm, that’s not funny,” and then the whole mood goes down the toilet. But with any luck, hopefully you all found something to enjoy in this attempt!
“I’m going to say...Kali!” Kali grinned and walked over to where Venus and Lady Cakes were standing.
In this episode: It’s time for the reading challenge! Next, the queens will have to try their hands at stand-up comedy. Draco reconnects with his Slytherin heritage and learns about the muggle magic of microphones.
Steve’s bottom lip quivered as she clasped her hands in front of her face. Tears poured from her eyes.
RuPaul doubled over in laughter. “It’s always the children who suffer most when a drag family splits up,” he noted in mock seriousness. “Now there’s something I’d like to know about you. You’ve only been doing drag for a very short time, but I can tell that you are a very creative person. How did you express your creativity before you discovered drag?”
“Excuse me, what did you just say?” RuPaul interjected. The other queens on the stage shared looks with each other.
“To Professor Binns,” Draco tapped his cup against Potter’s. He smiled. “And to reuniting with old enemies.”
That was apparently enough to change the energy of the room. Venus, Kali, and Paris started chatting about actors they found attractive, while Lorena and Goldie slipped away to practice their lip syncs, feeling assured they were in the bottom.
. It felt like his brains were struggling to catch up. His heart rate sped faster than was probably healthy.
Goldie and Lorena were both safe, leaving Steve, Kali, and Ivana as the bottom three. They each faced RuPaul nervously.
Steve had opted to wear a burlesque outfit for her comedy routine. It showed off her fishy physique, but there were gaps along the sides of her leotard where the seams were coming unglued. Some of the ostrich feathers in her headdress were hanging at an odd angle. She crossed her arms and huffed.
The light remained green for several more seconds before turning yellow. “Er, well—” The light turned red. Draco closed her eyes and pressed her lips together before rolling them into a dissatisfied pout.
“He’s right,” Granger-Weasley said, and took the book back. She slid her finger down the page with the ritual, scanning the instructions. “If I understand correctly, this is essentially going to reboot his afterlife.”
Nor, unfortunately, did he learn about those non-magical necessities of magical life, such as paying Wizard taxes.
Myrtle appeared to be considering this. “Well, I suppose if you must, you must,” she sighed. “Though it would be such a waste. We don’t have many teenage ghosts around here.”
Draco took just a few minutes to put on some blue eyeliner that brought out the faint flecks of blue in his silver eyes. He grabbed his wand from the dresser and stuck it up the holster under his sleeve.
. I am launching a new set of products, and I’m entrusting each of you to help me market them. I need you to create thirty-second commercial campaigns. You will be working in teams of three. Now, pick your partners!”
Special guest judge Kumail Nanjiani quipped, “The English really will colonize anything, won’t they?”
After some more writhing around on the stage floor, she gracefully rose up to her feet and resumed the pose she had begun the song on.
"Since your family served me so obediently for years,-" Draco could swear he heard sarcasm in His voice"- you will be able to make a name for both you and your parents, and the whole family of Malfoys."
Draco wants to look at Potter and tell him to fuck off, but he can't bring himself to do that, it's like his body is not listening to him. If he only could move his hand, but it just won't move!
Oh. So he was not confused that Draco corrected himself and didn't call people coming from non-magical background mudbloods.
Most importantly, Draco is stupid, because Potter will find about it sooner or later since Draco is going to tell him if it turns out that Potter's intentions are genuine.
"I'm- I'm sorry, Malfoy. But I just- I just had to. If it weren't for- If we hadn't spent these past years fighting, I wouldn't have done it."
"I told you- Listen, you're a fucking wreck. A fucking wreck of a human. You've just had a panic attack, a fucking panic attack, Malfoy, and before you had even fainted, so clearly there's something very wrong! I may hate you, but I know things like this don't come because of some light issues. Especially panic attacks. And maybe-" he looks down-" Maybe you're not going to tell me what is it that got you into such a state, but I'm not going to take the responsibility if you do something to yourself, okay? Or you faint again in one of the corridors and die and become a ghost, you're going to scare the kids. I'm not having any of that." He locks eyes with Draco. "So I'm taking you to Madame Pomfrey, she'll give you something to calm you down."
"Won't you say anything, Draco?!" A note of hysteria in Bella's voice, who has got up by now, made Draco even more paralyzed.
He fiddles with the pack, trying his best not to glance at Potter. Draco clears his nose, feeling awfully awkward, while Potter is looking around the room, seeming as awkward as Draco.
"I have spent enough time here. Remember my words, Draco." He glared at Draco in a way that made him feel transparent. "I cannot take any more failure from Malfoys. And I hope you understand that this commission- It must remain a secret. If someone besides the three of you who are present in this room right now- "He moved his eyes on Narcissa and Bellatrix- "acquires the knowledge about this strictly confidential matter, you will bear the consequences. Come, Nagini."
Draco turned to Him as well, only now realising how tense his mother was. They were standing arm in arm, all three of them, Narcissa, Draco, and Bella. Aunt seemed to be utterly pleased and more relaxed with every second. With wide eyes beaming with adoration, she was ogling her lord, not even truly acknowledging the presence of her sister and nephew.
Potter didn't even blink once. Draco has been looking into his eyes for such an unusually long time now, these past couple of days- So much staring and now-
"It took me so much," Draco sniffles, "so fucking much to trust you, I'm trying- If you know the Dark Lord so well, and you are aware of what the Death Eaters are capable of- You know what, judging from how you treat me I'm fucking certain, Potter, that you have no idea! No fucking idea what's going on there! You don't have a family of Death Eaters, none of your friends are Death Eaters! You think it's so easy to be either the good one or the bad one, but it's not!"
"I just want you to know-" It's harder than Draco thought. Potter leans forward just the slightest bit and stares at him expectantly. Draco tries his best not to turn his eyes away. "This whole situation made me revalue some things and I'm not who I used to be. That's all I want you to remember, Potter."
“You’re implying I’ll get the chance to leave, Potter,” Draco said, recovering well enough to arch a pointed brow.
Draco swallowed the irritating lump in his throat as his eyes fluttered open. Potter was still staring, his gaze a ravenous green. Well, time to fix what he’s bollocksed up. “You aren’t going to embarrass me by ordering something atrocious like Pistacho, are you?”
Malfoy’s free hand squeezed the back of Harry’s neck again. It still felt unbelievably good. “Something we should’ve tried years ago, Potter.”
“Potter, remain calm,” Malfoy whispered, his lips barely moving while he strode towards the exit. “Someone has slipped you a potion, and I need to get you out of here. I assume you’re feeling the effects quite strongly now?”
Harry struggles to breathe as the wind is knocked out of him when he crash-lands on the cool grass. The problem isn’t helped when Draco immediately falls on his chest, his pointy chin banging into Harry’s shoulder. Draco’s body seems to relax into a state of dead, unconscious weight. Brilliant.
Sure, he is still scared for his life, but that's normal. Fear has been breathing down his neck for a couple of months now. Fear lives in his head. He's grown familiar to it.
"I'll kill you if you aren't there." She whispers so close to his ear he can nearly feel her lips against his earlobe, and it makes little shivers run down his spine.
"You can buy another bottle. Because this one-" Aunt Bella raised the bottle up and pointed at it with her chin" - I'm keeping it."
Draco tries his best to yet again, amidst everything, appear composed and confident. Which is funny, because he's lost all of his dignity before the other boy a while ago.
He knows he should trust Potter. He knows the boy swore on the most important people in his life, yet that still isn't enough for Draco to feel entirely safe and calm.
Draco looks to the side and ostentatiously takes a loud bite of his very crispy toast, letting Pansy know he's not in the mood for talking. She catches on that and with disgruntlement written all over her face, she initiates a conversation with Zabini, who's definitely more eager to talk to her than Draco.
"She told me you hate this all. And that you're scared, and that you feel lonely and you have no one to turn to, and you just want to-"Potter spills the words in one breath. He inhales loudly-" You just want to protect your family, and she said you wouldn't tell her what this all was about, but you didn't want to do it. And to be honest, I think that if it wasn't me who had asked, she wouldn't have said anything. She trusts me for some weird reason. So don't think she betrayed you or something."
"Go, right now." He urgently hissed as he made a show of struggling against the Death Eaters already grabbing him.
Harry was so focused on what Kreacher's words that he didn't notice that the attic was rumbling. When Kreacher swayed on his feet and toppled over suddenly, Harry's head jerked up to find that Draco was pacing, the air around him shimmering and wavering.
"Not that that's that bad of a thing, mind you." He mumbled, more so to himself than Malfoy, then cleared his throat. "I think I'd like to know something more about myself, because that's useful information to me. Can't change the past or anything so it's pointless to ask that, but if I learn something deeper about myself I can work to improve, that's always good yea?"
But, at night, while he slept in Draco's bed with the blonde pressed to him, Harry often wondered whether there was any truth to Ron's words.
Most of the time, the physicality of it Harry was able to feel in the back of his mind, where all of it sort of faded and buzzed about, no longer so forceful or at the forefront of his being. Amidst everything else he was finding himself busy with, he could almost say he was accustomed. Almost.
"Grimmauld 12, I'm sure you can find it." Potter's lips quirked up. "See you tomorrow Draco." He threw over his shoulder as he took Teddy's hand and walked away.
"Well, ever since his speech I knew this was bound to be an interesting year, but I never would've assumed
The pressing arousal borne of the bond only choked Harry farther by his dream, his head fogging and glazing with the ghosting shivers in his skin that ached to go to Draco—to touch and be touched. Harry's throat hurt, felt too parched and dry, as if he'd been screaming or speaking in his sleep.
Harry pressed a hand over his mouth while his poor mind worked hundreds of miles a minute to try and figure this out. Things around Grimmauld were ruined worse than Harry had expected, he was pretty sure they won't be able to repair a torn out fridge or broken down doors by themselves. Harry might have to call in someone to perform all the necessary repairs, now that he has seen the breadth of all the damage. Which meant he and Malfoy would have to move out for a time period.
Turns out though, the finale, as it were, was sort of anti-climactic. There were no dramatic exclamations of love, like both Salazar and Godric would've assumed based on how vigorously they were yelled at.
Harry hadn't a clue what it could be—or how it related to himself, so he supposed he'd have to drop it.
"I know it's a lot, let's just talk." And like that, Harry sat next to Draco and sidled as close as he could get before he leaned in and began to talk quietly enough no one else could hear him.
Harry could barely take a breath to try to think through this—air was a luxury he felt too poor to afford as he choked on the deep, vicious hurt that tore and clawed at his chest. He felt as though a clamp was prying his ribcage open, pulling him apart and delving deeper, into his heart, his lungs, his diaphragm, biting and ripping everything in sight. The blithe agony made his knees crumple, he fell to the floor.
"We're both—men. Wizards can't have kids. Can't we break the bond on account of that?" He pleaded there was a loophole such as that that they could exploit.
Hermione's face melted into something sweet and compassionate and she reached over and patted Harry's hand:
Kreacher popped in with a heavy, thick leather tome in his wrinkly hands. The bloody thing was nearly wider than he himself was, and certainly just as bloody tall.
Draco finally moved and pet Snowflake, a small jolt travelling through the both of them. Snowflake's demeanor changed as the bonding spell connected, he immediately curled tighter against Draco's palm petting him. He didn't squirm or protest when Draco picked him up to peer closer at his vest.
As Draco looked upon it, the king of the night sky, he felt even more assured that there was a reason for everything. A design to this world, an order.
"I want to have you at least once." His voice broke with unshed tears as his mind processed the fact there really was no way to pull Harry free from here—not even magic could save it this time. This was all he'd get. All
"I've captured Harry Potter." Malfoy announced to the room and pulled up Harry's fringe, to flash his scar to everyone. "I'm willing to hand him over." He continued, voice calm and collected, a feat Harry was frankly proud of him for accomplishing. "On one condition." He finished.
unhealthy.” He fixes Harry with a stare, then nods to himself before picking up his next scone. “Also, you promised Hermione that you’d stop months ago. I don’t wanna listen to her spiel about how sex work is unethical any more than you do, Mate. Do us both a favour, yeah?”
Harry and (his) Draco seem to have come to a telepathic agreement as they stay silent and avoid each other’s eyes while holding onto the Time-Turner together as it spins.
So far, they’ve managed to dip out before seeing anything too graphic. Unfortunately, their luck has finally run out. They land on a practice mat in the DADA classroom, while MV Draco and Harry are on the mat right beside them with their professor robes hiked up at the waist. Since they’re having clothed sex.
Draco understood that the newly opened primary school was Wizard owned and operated, but considering the fact that it was to be the first Muggle-born friendly school in their country, surely they could bear to get with the times. How were Muggle parents meant to communicate in return? Buy an owl six years earlier than they really needed to? Some Muggle-born children didn’t even show signs of accidental magic by their fifth birthday anyway, to even be eligible to attend.
It was extra annoying today since Harry could be skiving off for a cuppa before his next clinic case instead of entertaining this shite. “Draco?”
Biting his lip, Draco looked up to find Potter staring at him with an expression he couldn’t decipher. All he knew was it felt intense — enough to trigger his blush response.
They pop into the next universe, uncomfortably close together, squeezed into one side of a small booth in what looks like a Muggle coffee shop. It takes a few minutes of quiet and the odd crawling feeling of
“Please, Papa?” Scorpius whined, clutching onto Draco’s plum henley with his — thankfully clean — hands. His scrunching would still leave wrinkles that would need to be pressed out magically, and they didn’t have time.
Draco raised a snooty brow at Harry, leaving him to believe that no one else was buying his unvoiced insistence. Perhaps, he was panicking a little. “Calm down, Potter. It doesn’t take us forwards or backwards in time. My new Time-Turner takes us to an entirely different universe. We
“Why does she look scared?” Scorpius asked, his voice entirely too loud for the not quite empty hallway.
“Bulstrode doesn’t even move, though,” Ron said, between bites. “She just does that eye thing. ‘S creepy.”
Harry panics once he realises he’s not alone in the Muggle sex shop. He isn’t worried about being outed or judged for his purchases. He’s sweating at the possibility of being recognised by Draco.
Potter slowly straightened up. He seemed to study Draco with the same scrupulousness that had been paid to him. Taking in every detail that stayed the same — whippet-thin, poise and good posture, that single inch taller — and denoting every change. His silvery blond undercut with the top left long enough to look enticingly tousled. A few metal hoops and studs distributed across his ears and a ring in his right nostril. Henley sleeves pushed up to reveal a faded scar on his left arm, barely noticeable among the tattooed narcissus flowers, bright against pale skin. Potter’s eyes had fallen to his left hand that was missing a ring. It was now lovingly draped on his son’s shoulder to gently nudge him forward.
’ed a quill and his prescription parchment, huffing as Draco barely gave him space to write while opening his trousers and pulling them down to mid-thigh. The ink didn’t even have time to dry before Draco tried to snatch the slip from Harry, who was quick enough to raise it over their heads. “There are
“I can’t. It’s so much.” And it was. Harry’s head hit the cabinet behind him with a thunk as he slumped down. This couldn’t possibly be happening, except it was, and now Malfoy was being
Draco and Harry pop into the same sitting room of Grimmauld Place as before, only they’re on the loveseat this time and MV Harry is kneeling on the rug by the fireplace.
MV Harry pulls his fingers free with a loud squelch and picks up what looks like Floo powder, only it’s a fluorescent shade of green instead of the normal grey. He quietly mumbles a spell in place of an address before tossing it into the flames. Almost immediately, the flames soar, then lower to the edge of the hearth’s floor. A long, flushed cock slides out of the fireplace, looking identical to the erection attached to all of the previous MV Dracos.
“No.” Malfoy withdrew his fingers with a noisy squelch and a satisfied smile. Then scooped up the semen on Harry’s stomach and fit them back inside, moved them in and out until they both moaned.
“He bumped into a table he was instructed to steer clear of, spilt a few potions, caused a fuss,” Malfoy lied, hooking his elbow around Harry’s arm to pull him out of his seat. “Notice how Millicent is in perfect health? She always behaves during joint meetings. Perhaps you could take lessons from your partner.”
Harry can feel the nasty grime of sweat building up in his armpits, his hairline, and the back of his knees. Of all the different ways he’s imagined reconnecting with Malfoy off the clock, this is not one that he planned for. Nor, is he prepared for this level of confidence. The collected slope of narrow shoulders, bright eyes peering down at him from above, an eyebrow arched in a teasing manner.
Harry whined high in the back of his throat and rubbed his cheek on a pillow, his sparse week-old scruff causing a similar sensation, no doubt. Draco pinched both nipples through the fabric, then alternated between treatments until Harry’s irregular hip twitching morphed into a steady thrust up, his fully formed erection seeking any possible friction but coming up empty.
“Hello, Mr Potter. It’s nice to meet you,” Scorpius said, enunciation steady and practiced. It filled Draco with pride.
(His) Draco makes a noise beside him that sounds suspiciously like a sniffle before he silently reaches for his hand. Harry squeezes it tightly as they spin in time again, without a single word exchanged. This glimpse is too pure for any snide remarks or fighting.
“—and send the PT Healers chasing after you like an escaped toddler,” Harry said, as bored as the day is long. “If you’re taking more of the Pain Potion than what was prescribed, I can’t help you.”
Snorting, Draco rolled his eyes so dramatically that he seemed in danger of pulling a muscle. “Obviously. Everything here is in French unless it’s in Spanish. That’s why they went over the Language Conversion Charm during breakfast this morning. Or were you and Weasley not paying attention?”
“You haven’t seen the new schedule?” Draco nipped at his ear and unfastened his belt, the soft clink of metal barely registering in Harry’s mind. “We won’t have a night alone until June at the earliest.”
“Here we are. After you,” Draco said, with a large, heavily ringed hand placed unnecessarily on the small of Harry’s back to guide him through an open doorway. Then his ears felt like they were on fire when soft lips grazed the skin as Draco whispered, “We can sit at that table in the back.”
“Like someone’s trying to suck my soul out through my knob?” Harry asked between clenched teeth. It was getting stronger by the second and it wasn’t even pleasurable anymore. Like a build-up that would never plateau.
A long, deep sigh did nothing but press on Harry’s patience. “I’ve been very poorly as of late,”  Draco said, his tone wavering like a wireless voice actor.  “It’s affecting my beauty sleep now. It’s the pain, you see. I swear, it feels like a herd of Hippogriffs are stomping on my bad knee, digging their claws into my muscles and ripping my tendons from my flesh—”
Harry isn’t sure which part of his brain goes offline at the suggestion, but he follows it up with his own proposition. “We could share. You know, to make sure we get every crevice one hundred percent clean.”
“They can sort your paperwork at the front desk, then direct you to the Apothecary for pick up,” Harry said, his words coming out in a rush. He offered a hand to help her down from the raised patient bed, then Levitated her moleskine pouch into her grasp. “It’s probably better if you—“
“Malfoy, you fucker!” Harry shouted, weakly reaching for his robes and Spelling his door shut before any prying eyes could see inside.
Nostrils flaring, Harry stepped in closer, with his wand clutched tightly in one hand and his wrinkled parchments in the other. “Hermione’s really brilliant! She’s the best in our year and always has been.”
Thankfully, MV Harry doesn’t let him win so easily. “Shut up, Malfoy. Let me suck your dick in peace.”
“Rose, please stop telling people they’re late,” said a tiredly fond voice that was even more familiar.
(His) Draco avoids Harry’s gaze. He tucks his arm around him, mumbling under his breath as he spins the Time-Turner. “You need a special powder and an unofficial spell, technically.”
“Harry, you have a problem.” Ron finishes off his scone before pointing a crumby finger at Harry. “You’ve gotta stop staying up so late to watch Malfoy do his camera wank web shit. It’s been almost two years now that you’ve been watching Malfoy without him knowing it’s you. You know it’s bloody creepy
“Yes, like Seokjin,” Draco promised, ruffling his son’s hair. He had Draco’s shade of ice blond but took after Astoria’s effortless beachy waves, a constant time saver in the mornings when styling by hand wasn’t an option and Scorpius was too tender headed for a Brushing Charm.
Draco had accepted the terms of returning to Hogwarts for an ‘Eighth Year’ in lieu of formal probation.
He used the fabric to caress Harry’s hand and the awful words etched into his skin, trailed up to the knife wound on his arm. With care, he slid warm wool over a bite mark on his other side, then over the locket shape left above his heart. Draco paused and focused on centering his breathing, giving Harry a moment to catalogue the sensation. To guess what might come next.
Potter smiled wide enough for his eyes to crinkle at the corners and Draco felt his entire stomach drop out of his body. He was fucked.
“Yes. Just follow the instructions on the parchment insert they’ll give you on the ground floor,“ Harry explained to the witch sitting on the patient bed in his office. “In about five days—“
Actually, it felt more like when Wood paid him back. Better even. The ghost of touch trailing his inner thighs, hot breath panting against him. Harry swore he could feel a tongue swirling around the tip and—
Harry suddenly worried about retaining a single idea from today’s class, regardless of any Language Charms.
Harry licks his lips and finally finds it possible to speak, stuttering as he asks, “Is that even possible?”
Harry splutters and turns red, yanking the Time-Turner out of (his) Draco’s hand so they can leave this universe before anything else incriminating happens.
A small mercy, considering the invisible wanking had kicked up a notch, and Harry felt shiny all over with sweat. “But how — did you — oh shit!” That was definitely a mouth on his cock. A very wet, warm, suckling mouth.
He couldn’t even attend his Arithmancy lessons or Magical Runes. Draco only had his school books for learning, which he had already finished reading.
. “Oh.” Draco closed his eyes and tried to will away the oncoming flush of heat he felt gathering in his ears, his neck, his cheekbones. Bloody fantastic, now he’s made himself look like a right twat.
“So you’ll do me a little favour?” Draco followed up his request with that magic trick of his, kissing just the right spot on Harry’s neck, and he folded.
Harry could almost confuse this teasing for flirting if Malfoy wouldn’t seem to be paying his new toy more attention than him.
“It’s Mr Potter in class, Rose,” Potter corrected, rather uselessly. Rose was already chatting Scorpius’s ear off about uncles and dragons. “Erm, sorry about that…”
Harry pulled the damp wool away and dropped it over the edge of the bed onto the floor, then stretched and sighed. Draco felt Harry relax under his weight and ignored the erection between them for now, content with being nestled half against Harry’s side and half on top of him. With clumsy fingers, Harry took off his makeshift blindfold and blinked as his eyes got used to the low lighting.
Draco had even accepted the fact that he was stuck with Longbottom as a roommate for the year, and that every single weekend would be spent under McGonagall’s sharp eyes while they worked to repair parts of the castle that had still been in disuse after a long summer of reconstruction.
They’re unceremoniously dumped on the steps of a shop near the dodgiest end of Knockturn Alley. Draco casts a drying charm over them both as soon as Harry shakes his curls like a dog.
Due to his international travels, parenthood and odd hours worked while holed up in his potions lab, he hasn’t seen or made awkward small talk with Potter at Ministry events in over seven years. Time has certainly been kind to him. A full beard, longer curls — currently tied back, amber complexion glowing with a recent tan. Shoulders broad and pushed back with confidence that was earned and not faked. While Potter had put on a little necessary weight as a Junior Auror at nineteen, it seems he’s packed on another three stone in solid muscle mass since then and carried it into his retirement. About one month prior if Draco’s memory of the Prophet’s hysteria was accurate, some international trial or other. The point was - Potter was massively fit now, in a way Draco preferred his men.
“You know of it? No, yeah, of course. You said… yeah, Muggle shoppes, alright.” Potter rubbed his beard with his free hand - he’d yet to let go of Draco’s arm - then pinned Draco down with a
Paused in the doorway, Draco studied the tiny girl blocking their path with her hands set on her hips with an air of self-importance. Her combination of excessive freckles and dark, bushy curls looked eerily familiar, and it caused a feeling like a stone sinking in his gut.
Draco gave Harry’s foot another squeeze then dragged the wool up his calf, ruffling the dark leg hair along the way. He returned to trailing the fringe along sensitive inner thighs, amusedly watching the muscles tense and jump underneath his ministrations. Harry flat out whimpered and began to clamp his legs shut on either side of Draco until a wool-covered palm smacked the outside of one thigh in punishment.
Or maybe it was the thick, forest green sweater he was dressed in. Until Potter shifted to pat Rose on the shoulder and the beginnings of a soft stomach were apparent under the fabric’s stretch. Draco needed to remember which thoughts were particularly inappropriate for a classroom full of five-year-olds. He could feel the start of drool gathering on the sides of his tongue.
“That curse settled into your wound for years without treatment,” Harry closed his eyes and began rolling his hips to meet Draco’s grasp. “Pain Potions won’t heal you. It’s only… it’s only, fuck, it’s temporary. A short fix. No real… solution.”
The real Harry spasms and knocks his elbow into Draco’s ribs. “We need to leave, right now. No Silencing Charms are strong enough for this.”
Draco was falling off track. He licked his lips to regroup, then gently ran the wool across the width of Harry’s stomach, playfully dipping into his navel. Harry squirmed and tried to pull the scarf away but a hand around the wrist stopped him.
MV Harry and Draco are screaming at each other and gesturing wildly with only one arm each because they’re both handcuffed together by the other wrist. Magically handcuffed if the glowing and mildly alarming, purple sparks are anything to go by.
A monstrous wolf sails over the balcony ledge and transforms in mid-air, leaving an equally naked Harry to land on two bare feet.
Finding some mercy, Draco abandoned the stimulation to his chest and dragged the length of the scarf down Harry’s torso, narrowly avoided his prick. Using the wool as a barrier, he fondled Harry’s bollocks and pressed on his perineum, smiling at the increase in response.
Both Dracos run their eyes up and down MV Harry’s muscular body, with (his) Draco’s lips curling up on one side while he fiddles with his hair. “You look fairly naked yourself,” he teases.
Before Harry could blink, all sticky slow from a pre-orgasmic haze, Draco plucked the prescription parchment from his loose fist and hobbled out of the room faster than should be humanly possible with a bum knee. His poor bollocks were still trying to empty as the full force of a ruined orgasm hit him like the Hogwarts Express. And all whimpering was drowned out by the noise of Draco cackling farther down the hall, and no doubt pleased with himself for getting exactly what he wanted.
There isn’t any time to make a plan or run away. In the second it takes Harry to inhale, Malfoy has wrapped elegant, non-lube covered fingers around a sizable, dark green dildo — with a fat knot built into the base.
Potter looked completely wrongfooted for a few seconds before his mind appeared to latch onto the most likely conclusion. His expression cleared up as Scorpius took a step forward and offered a tiny hand.
A scantily clad MV Draco is leaning against the building across the street from them, smoking a cigarette while the loud thunder of a motorcycle grows nearer. It turns out to be MV Harry who slows to a stop in front of MV Draco. The engine is never turned off so Harry can’t hear the words exchanged, but he clearly sees a bag of Galleons exchanged that prompts Draco to climb on board behind him.
Malfoy snorts, a terribly unposh thing to do, then turns to presumably give Harry a piece of his mind. Instead, Harry receives a look of shock, which quickly morphs into suspicion, calculation, amazement. Which then slides into that sultry smile that has been burned into Harry’s mind with how often he’s seen it on camera.
Then he watches Malfoy jerk off on camera while using his new gift and gets thanked for it personally, during the show. He tries to enjoy the high of endorphins, honestly.
MV Draco is sitting in a squishy oversized chair, alone, typing rapidly on the macbook in his lap. He’s dressed in Muggle clothes and nearly indistinguishable from all the other college students who are supporting the coffee shop. There’s even a metal ring circling around his lower lip at the corner of his mouth. His tongue keeps flicking out to touch it.
Without thinking, Harry grabs a belt loop and pulls them down farther. “See, it’s right there,” he insists, accidentally touching the mole while pointing at it.
The longer Draco ruminated on all of this, the closer he felt to going into a snit about it, and they simply didn’t have the time.
Draco is gaining more fans by the week and when a new viewer drops a HollyWood80 sized tip on the cam site, they both take notice. Draco’s eyes widen and his smile turns coy.
He wrinkled his nose before he smoothed out his face, determined to not let a sneer take root. Draco used to be a bigoted twat, but he wasn’t anymore.
Before he can wonder how Draco pulled it off, two Seekers are zeroing in on the Snitch, flying right towards them. They’re going to crash onto the pitch and don’t seem to care if they take out civilians or not. “Draco, move, now!”
“I suppose if you need to be so crass.” To add to the humiliation, Malfoy cast a Cushioning Charm on the floor, then sat down beside Harry. “I’m afraid you need to work through this as quickly as possible to end your suffering.” He showed the first bit of compassion all day, gentling his tone and squeezing the back of Harry’s neck in a way that felt just right. The supple leather gloves felt like butter on his skin. “Come on, out of your pants.”
The Time-Turner spits them out onto Neville’s bed in the Gryffindor’s boy dorm room, where MV Draco and Ron are playing an intense game of chess. While wearing matching house ties. Sitting unbearably close together, MV Harry tenderly brushes a loose curl from MV Draco’s face and tucks it behind his ear. Then stares at him, looking absolutely besotted.
Draco’s breathing is heavier than it was, and this time he’s brave enough to make eye contact while he sets the collar of Harry’s robe to sorts. “We really need to go down to the basement lab and go through the process of a decontamination shower,” Draco says, his voice almost scratchy.
“Scorpius, it’s your first day. You need to be focused on being friendly to the other kids instead of playing with toys by yourself.” Draco kissed Scorpius on the forehead, then he gently scooped him up. “I know you’ve been sad since Seokjin moved away, but his Mum had a special job here with Aurors. They could only stay a few months for her case.” Truth be told, He dearly missed their previous neighbours. Single parenting was easier with a support system nearby. Sighing, he levitated the Spider-Man backpack and sent it bobbing along behind them on the walk to the living room Floo. Draco barely remembered to hit the light switch on his way out. “But that doesn’t mean all your new friends are going to leave, okay?”
Harry was spread out on Draco’s bed in their shared 8th-year dorm room, completely nude except for the green silky Slytherin tie that was wrapped around his eyes and served as a blindfold. He was laid out on his back, his head on a pillow, his hands curled in loose fists around his thumbs. His legs were open wide so Draco could kneel in the vee. His lips were parted and his breathing loud — the only sound in their room, behind the curtains that were spelled shut. Draco himself had set their privacy wards. He wasn’t worried about being disturbed.
Draco coughed. It wasn’t a delicate cough, either.  It was more like his saliva had launched backwards in an attempt to choke him to death in order to avoid further embarrassment.
“Well, hello there, Draco!” RuPaul greeted as he and Warren approached Draco’s work table. “Tell me, how are you planning to approach the Frock the Vote challenge?”
“Do you mind if we do some rewriting for our act?” Draco asked Goldie and Paris. “I’ve had a burst of inspiration.”
Lady Cakes sat down and allowed Draco to help get the wrist braces off. Draco gently smeared generous portions of the salve on each wrist.
They finished walking along the Walk of Fame, which failed to impress Draco (why would anyone feel honored to have people put their dirty feet all over one’s name?). But he’d had enough tequila by that point that the idea only made him laugh.
“Erm,” Harry coughed and turned beet red. “I was going to tell you all that supper’s ready, but I seem to have stepped into the wrong universe. Excuse me,” he said, and left.
“Because you’re still my baby boy,” Draco told him. Scorpius rolled his eyes. “This is the last year we’ll be able to make this outing together before you leave Hogwarts. Let’s make the most of it.”
She had been given the hardest stunts in the pole-dancing segment, and had questionable ability to pull off some of the maneuvers. Carmelita was a very feminine pageant queen, more accustomed to posing the house down than performing athletic dance numbers.
Draco held the parchment up and pointed to it emphatically, as if it explained all her feelings in the song. It was a letter from Harry wishing her good luck on
“My family is very conservative,” he explained. “Family was always very important to me, but I was only important to family so far as I lived up to the right ideals and obligations.
“Why hello, Draco!” RuPaul greeted as he approached Draco, who was styling a blonde bob wig at his work table. “Tell, me, who is this going to be?”
“It’s behind you, sweetie!” Michelle called out as Draco pretended to look around the stage through her binoculars, seemingly oblivious to the koala on her back.
“Intoxia Madison, Venus Flygirl, Lady Cakes McMansion, Draco, Acacia Davenport: you are all safe. You may leave the stage.”
“Lorena Gucci,” RuPaul went on. “Your witch look had us gagging. But in the challenge, you...choked.” Lorena nodded stiffly.
“Mostly, I just drew everyone’s name out of a wig,” Draco laughed. “Girl, I don’t have any agenda! Who do I look like — Shangela?”
“Finally, sign here to acknowledge receipt of my services and allow Gringotts to send me seventy-five galleons in payment thereof.”
. Both queens pantomimed a trumpet solo before leaping into a series of fast-paced dance moves as the drums kicked in. Draco was unfamiliar with the song, but she was impressed with the way both queens handled the lyrics and beats flawlessly.
special, with that sorry ass ballet outfit you got on.” Lorena clapped back. Draco shook her head and flipped her off in the American style. American queenly manners were starting to rub off on her.
That was the moment when the real Harry Potter wandered into the room. Harry Gryffindor froze. All eyes turned to the newcomer, who stood in the doorway and gaped.
Paris and Goldie shook their heads. “None at all,” Draco replied. He snuck a glance at Paprikah, who was standing just off the screen and watching with interest while holding some type of camera equipment.
“No, I don’t think that will be necessary," Draco replied. “In fact, I—I just had an idea. Miss Act, if you please, stand over here—” she gestured at a spot in front of the tea table. “—And face the camera.”
Draco was about to respond when they heard an angry voice yell, “All you fags need to get AIDS and die!”
“Nevertheless, I think I can help,” Malfoy continued. “I have an opening tomorrow morning at ten. Come to my office with your papers from the Ministry and the Black estate, and I’ll see what I can do. Can’t have the Savior of the Wizarding World fall behind on his taxes!” He grinned and handed Harry a small card with his floo address.
Draco’s mask designs had been his crowning artistic achievement as a teenager. Not only were they each individual masterpieces of design, but for a brief moment they had helped him win the very rarely bestowed respect of his father and the Dark Lord.
A wisp of magic swirled in front of him as the room responded and created a giant potato shaped like a fainting couch.
“Draco,” RuPaul called as they approached. “A little bird told me you were having some trouble earlier,” he said. “What have you got here?” he asked, gesturing curiously at the quill.
“Aaahh, this is gorgeous! I LOVE IT!!” Lady Cakes practically screamed as he lifted yards and yards of sequined royal blue fabric out of his box. “Latrice Royale, thank you!”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco caught Herb Kong watching from offstage. They made eye contact, and Draco waited for a short moment to see how he would react. The man shrugged and motioned for Draco to keep working with Jones.
With that, she flew up and dived into a toilet. Draco’s jaw dropped in disbelief. That meeting hadn’t gone the way he thought it would.
Draco felt lucky to discover that old Persian rug in the attic at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, and in the right color, to boot. Once again, his Black ancestors had come through for him.
“Well, thanks anyway,” he said, turning to the others. “I know you tried, Draco. But maybe this is for the best.” He flashed another grin at Myrtle. “Goyle, I know you were just trying to help me find some way to pass the time, but you can keep your muggle books.”
“I guess being a prat turned out to be good for something after all,” Draco overheard Ron Weasley say in Harry’s ear. He gave the redhead his favourite salute.
win!” Lady Cakes McMansion grinned from ear to ear as she removed her Wonder Woman headband and wig. “Crown it, baby!”
“Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul continued. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your
“I’m not just a posh Brit,” Draco continued. “I’m also willing to rule over you like a queen.” She picked up a small British flag from her podium, waving it emphatically. “A vote for Draco is a vote for the British queen, and a return to the monarchy!”
“Excellent. Now that’s settled, I have a very weirded-out boyfriend who needs to be convinced why this is a good idea.”
Harry had spoken at the trials for both Draco and Narcissa, explaining how they had helped him during the war. As a result, Draco had gotten off with a mere one-year house arrest sentence and Narcissa had gotten just a slap on the wrist.
; it’s a constellation; and it’s one exquisite drag queen — me! My drag style is refined elegance. My goal in this competition is to sweep the judges off their feet with my perfectly charming demeanour.”
He was a little worried that this ignorance would catch up with him sooner or later. But for now, he would continue to rise to the challenges as best as he could.
“Well we don’t need to hear you bragging about it!” Lorena snapped. The other queens exchanged shocked looks.
“Wait a minute,” Granger said. “Do you mean to tell me that they had men telling women how to look like men pretending to be women?”
Draco had resolved to tell Villareal about his conversation with Kali the next morning, when they usually saw each other at the Quidditch park. But she failed to appear this time. Draco flew around the park, feeling the soft Pacific breeze as the early morning sun still sat low in the sky. He cursed softly. When he wanted to be alone, she was there to remind him that he was being watched. Now that he actually wanted to talk to her, she was missing.
“Why, Ru, I got all the booty you need!” Lady-Cakes-as-Nicole-Byer got up and turned around, bending over at the waist so her derriere was on full display.
“Good evening, I am Puerto Rico — um, I am Lorena Gucci, and we need more Puerto Rico in US government. And sexy. Vote for me and Make America Sexy Again.” Lorena smiled stiffly at the camera and lifted her hand in a pageant wave.
In reality, there was a tiny battery inside the wand and Draco had simply touched a tiny button on the tip.
“I agree,” Draco grinned. “Now, I really must begin to get ready for tonight’s show. Will you be there?”
“But any other queen could have taken what she got and turned it into something more complicated,” Michelle argued. “This was a sewing challenge, and she barely even sewed!”
reviewed the previous episode. Seeing Draco openly express his love for Harry in the lip sync, and Harry’s love letter to Draco, helped convince more than a few people that he wasn’t simply with Harry for personal gain.
“But I’m loving this new side of you,” Ross continued. “I believe that you really could kill us all if you wanted to.”
“Well done, ladies!” RuPaul cheered. “Now, Steve’s show will be called ‘Smells Like Fish’ and Intoxia’s will be called ‘Two Piece and a Biscuit.’” Lorena grimaced.
“Morning, Racers!” RuPaul chirped from the viewscreen. “Are you a beach blanket bimbo? Or do you prefer a Rocky Mountain High? Well, I don’t know about you, but I NEED A VACATION!”
Draco was washing his hands in the loo when a wizard he’d never met suddenly apparated into the room.
There hadn’t been any sign of trouble in the pub, either, even after the threatening letter. Draco wasn’t sure whether that had more to do with Harry and Weasley’s careful watch as aurors on duty, or the lack of anything potentially revealing about magic in this episode. Either way, Draco counted it as a win — at least, for this week.
After a few more minutes, Draco had found a bottle of green dye and poured it into a little bowl. He dipped the makeshift quill into the dye, tapped it against the side of the bowl to remove excess drips, and began scribbling notes on his notepad with a sigh of relief.
“There’s no record of anyone casting the charm on a living creature, let alone themselves, so I’m testing out ways of combining it with some transfiguration spells for animagi,” Draco explained. He sagged into his vanity chair. “I’ve yet to successfully split my entire body. With some more practice, I think I can get there, but I can only do so much at a time before I get a massive headache.”
Lady Cakes hooted with laughter. “You know, I’m a big girl so we all knew I was gonna get knocked out first. I don’t mind because now I get to watch, but honey, I need popcorn, ‘cuz we got some major martial arts dance off going on in here!”
Draco better not have lied about their new schedule because it would take at least that long for Harry to settle down and not want to break his nose for this stunt.
need to work on their nonverbal communication because Harry can’t understand any of the hand signals Draco is throwing his way.
Harry tries not to feel bitter when he realises this exact scene played out ten years ago during their real eighth year at Hogwarts. (Minus the kissing and secret relationship between star crossed lovers.)
With forgiveness in his heart, Draco let the wool trace a tiny crooked line over Harry’s nose, then a line across his throat that ended near his left shoulder. His lips curled into a proud smile when Harry gasped and realization filtered over his face, evident even despite the blindfold covering that deep jade eyes. Slowly, Draco continued to trace invisible lines across Harry’s torso, lines that matched his own Sectumsempra scars. He ran the wool over a nipple, crisscrossed over both hips, over one diagonal line which spanned his entire rib cage. Draco hesitated at Harry’s left wrist, then pressed firmly when he travelled up the length of his forearm. Harry sniffed loudly when it was followed up by a dozen horizontal lines over the same space.
Harry’s jaw drops, and he turns to look at (his) Draco who also looks confused and sleepy but less surprised. (His) Draco cups his hands around his mouth and yells, “Hello,” but neither Seeker acts like they can hear him, even though they’re less than a metre away.
“Hurry up. You’re impeding on important Healer business. The state of modern medicine and wizarding life depends on it. And tell the useless desk help that Potter is not to be disturbed for at least 30 minutes!” The uptick in volume was hardly necessary since Draco stayed on her heels like a hostile crup, until his body blocked all view of the outside realm.
Harry felt two fingers sink into him like velvet and moaned like a Knockturn whore. He spread his thighs wider and rocked back shamelessly. Malfoy was inside him and around him and under him, the faint scent of rosemary wafting into space between them. He could nearly taste it on his tongue as he ascended higher and higher.
Harry coughs and rubs sweaty palms on his thighs while MV Werewolf Harry climbs onto a shiny piano and lays on his back, legs spread obscenely wide for the whole room to see. “We don’t need to stick around for this, Malfoy.”
Harry isn’t ready for this and he can feel himself withering on the spot. He has to say something, quickly. “My wand is gay.” Preferably not
Groaning, Harry drops his head down to knock on his desk. Then lifts it back up to argue his case, vehemently. “I know, alright? I know and I’m upset that everything happened this way. That Lucius used his blasted Imperius ruse to stay out of Azkaban. I’m mad that they were only banned from the manor for five years. I’m mad that he and Narcissa can stand to live in Bellatrix’s creepy old farmhouse, and Malfoy can’t. I’m mad that Malfoy moved in with Theo’s fit Squib cousin. I’m mad that Malfoy found the Muggle internet and learned how to use it. I’m really fucking pissed that Malfoy looks so good when he’s wanking off and—”
The one and only time, Draco had tried to Accio the lego transformer that Scorpius seemed to favor, was an unmitigated disaster. Due to the nature of lego pieces — being so easy to remove or break apart — and the fact that Scorpius frequently rebuilt his transformer to include whatever blocks he fancied that day, Sir Bumblebee had been temporarily disassembled in seven parts. All of them flew towards Draco’s person at once, along with all of the lego pieces that were actually intended to be a part of the yellow toy. The pain of the incident only came second to
Harry stomps up to the side of Draco’s station and holds the file out, his demands crystal clear. “The case can’t wait. It’s crucial!”
They turned another corner, and Malfoy pulled him in closer, waving off a curious passing witch with his usual no non-sense cue — Unspeakable Business — move along.
(His) Draco wheezes and Harry turns to face him, feeling just as peaky as Draco looks. “Do you want to stay for this, too?” Harry gambles.
“Not yet,” he hissed, nodding politely at several Wizengamot members they passed on their way out of the canteen. Once they were in the empty hallway, Malfoy sped up his pace.
It was bold, but a Malfoy never backed down from what they wanted… Unless a better option became available.
Harry had teased him a few days ago, made a crude joke about Draco’s Slytherin scarf that he couldn’t even remember at the moment, but it had led to this. To Harry naked on his crisp white sheets, green eyes masked by a green tie and waiting for Draco to follow up on his promise. That he could make this scarf Harry’s favourite thing in the world.
Meanwhile, his timetable for the new year consisted of a list of classes alphabetised by subject title instead of accompanying time stamps. Also, in French.
“You are aware that demolishing this castle won’t help Hogwarts rebuild any faster?” drawled a bored voice behind him.
Until he finally climaxed, and everything went orange and his body spasmed, back arched and pulled tautly. His eyes squeezed shut, and Malfoy swore loudly, and every muscle within him hurt. And then relaxed.
Harry is so entranced by how beautiful MV Merman Draco is, that he keeps leaning in closer to get a better look and tumbles into the water as consequence. (His) Draco dives after him and manages to grab onto his torso as they break the surface and the Time-Turner spins.
“Well, I suppose he isn’t wrong about that.” The giant, colorful numbers and letters painted throughout the corridor seemed a bit more in line with reception. It gave enough leeway for that small but still rude part of Draco to wonder again if this was all a terrible mistake. That inner voice reasoned that wasn’t too late to turn around and hire a private wizarding tutor for Scorpius, like the one he had growing up. After all, Draco turned out exceptionally intelligent.
Draco sighs and relaxes back into Harry’s arms, looking torn between defeat and utter pride. Harry should really let him go soon. “I was working on a modified Time-Turner, Potter. You spilled potion on us both and knocked me over so it began spinning. Unfortunately, it seems to have taken us both along for the ride,” Draco said.
“Modified how? We can’t be seen, it could change the fabric of time!” Harry was not panicking. They didn’t have time to panic. They had to fix this.
Harry snorts to cover his own feelings and turns to look at (his) Draco, his pale cheeks now rosy with a blush that’s visible through a fine layer of dust. “Aw, did you and your mum leave the Death Eaters for me?” Nothing recovers his dignity quite like insults and cruel teasing.
Harry can’t tell where they go after, since (his) Draco grabs him and spins the Time-Turner hurriedly, spluttering with red cheeks about how he isn’t a cheap companion of the moonlight.
And who would knock on their door anyway? On a cool Sunday morning, a drizzling rain quiet as it pelted their window. The rest of the castle was asleep, calm, unlike Draco’s heart which was beating unsteady in his chest and sounding loud in his ears. He had all of this bare, olive skin in front of him, ready to be touched, caressed and worshipped. Where to even start?
There was no discernible overlap that he could see. Harry drew in a deep calming breath then turned his map upside down. Still indecipherable. Which led him to feel justified in kicking the stone wall in front of him until his toes were sore inside his trainers.
MV Harry breaks the silence with a worn out, “Fuck it.” He sits up and straddles MV Draco with seemingly practised effort, then leans down to kiss him, while MV Draco moves up to meet him. Apparently, Draco tries to get the last word in every universe, this one included. “What happened to ‘never happening again’, Potter?”
MV Harry and Ron are on the other bed, with Ron speaking none too quietly, apologising to Harry for McGonagall’s stubbornness and refusing to swap out Draco for Ron as Harry’s roommate. The term ‘interhouse unity’ is spoken with the same disgust that is usually held for spiders. Ron slides off the blankets and heads out of the room without so much as a nod of courtesy thrown Draco’s way.
. Because offline, in the real world, they’re still Potter and Malfoy to each other. Nothing more than a routine check-in every six months, so Malfoy can have his wand scanned for dark magic use while serving out his probation.
No, Draco wasn’t sorry for barging into Harry’s office; he wanted something. And all the reforming in the world couldn’t erase the sense of entitlement that sunk into the marrow of his bones. That spoilt tilt of his chin that never entirely left.
It was just Draco’s luck that by the time he and Potter enjoyed playing house, Professor Flitwick was able to break the Charm of sentient castle magic that kept them locked up inside.
“Don’t touch that!” Draco yells, not in time to keep Harry from closing the vial completely. Acting quickly, Draco swipes up the disfigured Time-Turner and takes a step back from the chemistry set, pulling on Harry’s sleeve so he also vacates the workspace.
