"You are married?" Camilla asked suddenly. Harry glanced at her, before staring out at the water ruefully.
“Aren’t you a little young to get married?” Harry asked, trying his best not to wince at the mention of marriage. After all, he was only here talking to this sweet child because of his disastrous failure of a wedding.
Draco shrugged. “I guess I’m used to it. My office is fairly isolated so I don’t often have to face what people think of me.”
He sat down on his bed, considering his options. He didn't really want to leave the small village, and his new friend behind. But the point of travelling was to see and experience new things, wasn't it?
“Stop thinking about the what-ifs,” he chided himself softly. “Silverthorn’s files are bound to have some evidence.”
“Um, it’s really hectic here at work, and I don’t think I’ll be able to get away for lunch today. I spoke to Teddy, but he has the same problem.”
Member Pertinger nodded as his wife slumped against him. Clearly they’d been sitting here worrying all night. Instructing them to find a strong cup of tea and get some sleep, Draco headed off to do the same.
Just then, an owl tapped at the window. Agent Phi leaned over and let it in, accepting the missive that was clearly not for them.
“If all else fails, you can try a chafing ointment from any licensed apothecary. You won’t need a prescription for it. Good day, Potter.”
“Scorpius?” he called, wondering if his son was even home. Surely an Auror would have come to investigate the sound of someone coming through the floo by now? He glanced around for any clues as to where Scorpius might be, but the place was very sterile. It felt almost unnatural in a way. Scorpius wasn’t a slob, but he wasn’t the neatest person either.
"I'd like to try football," Harry told him. "I haven't played since I was a child, though, so I know I'll be terrible at it."
Draco’s eyes widened at his statement, reminding Harry of a polished sickle. He was tempted to just let himself get lost in those eyes again, but he forced himself to remain focused on the serious conversation.
"Hi. I have a reservation for Potter, but we have two extra guests. Is it possible to get a table for four instead?"
He wasn’t quite sure how to explain that to his friends, though. Sometimes he thought about just getting it over with and finding someone to go out on a date with. But there was something holding him back that he couldn’t quite pinpoint .
“It seems you have a lot of thinking to do, Draco. To decide between the man you love and your career is not an easy task.”
Scorpius was still reeling a little from having seen his father that morning, but receiving Head Auror Clearwater’s implied permission to look into the case once more had given him courage. He’d spent the day reading the transcripts of the trials and was shocked to find that almost no one had spoken in favour of his father. He hadn’t even had a defense lawyer. The trial had taken less than an hour, proving that he had been in the warehouse that was used as the murderer’s home base in the weeks leading up to the plot, and that the notes about polyjuice potion found in the makeshift lab were written in Draco’s handwriting. His father hadn’t said a single word during the whole process, though the transcripts did mention that he seemed to be crying through the whole thing. It had broken Scorpius’ heart to imagine the scene, and not for the first time, he wondered what on earth had driven the man to return to black market potions, especially for such a nefarious plot.
“Why didn’t you have a normal life?” Bryan asked curiously. Harry hesitated, not sure how much he wanted his new friend to know.
, even if it wasn’t much. I don’t know why he went back to it. Over the years I’ve thought of so many different possibilities, but none of them make any sense. Some time after you turned seven, he started acting distant. He’d be out late every night, and he barely spoke to me whenever he was home. At first I thought he was having an affair. Merlin, now I wish it had been that simple.”
“Come in.” Scorpius knew before he even opened the door that his dad had been crying. He made his way into the dimly lit bedroom and sat down at the foot of the bed. His dad was curled up under a thick blanket, and watching him warily. They sat in silence for a moment, before his dad spoke.
“I assure you, I am no such thing anymore. Muggle brands are less delicate on the skin simply because Muggles cannot weave charms into the tissue. If you’re willing to be cheap about it, I’m sure you could find equally abrasive magical brands.”
“After you passed out, we just let you sleep in the booth while the rest of us kept dancing,” Bryan explained, when Harry pointed this fact out. “Don’t worry about it though, we all know you’re not used to partying so hard. But now, you gotta go get dressed, we’re going to participate in another partying ritual, eating away the hangover.”
“What is going on here?” Malfoy asked, lifting an eyebrow and glancing curiously at Harry before turning his attention to the receptionist.
He stepped into the lobby, having received a Patronus from the Auror liaison that there had been another Transfiguration attack and that the victim was being brought straight to the emergency department. They didn’t seem to have arrived yet, and so he looked around, only to see…
"Can we go swimming?" Scorpius asked. "It's really hot here, and when it's hot, you're supposed to go swimming."
Scorpius returned to the courtroom the next morning thinking that he had a good handle on his nerves. He’d stayed with Teddy the night before, which had allowed him to spend the whole evening ranting and crying and rehashing every moment of the trial. They’d talked long into the night, and Scorpius hadn’t been the only one to realise that if Draco was going to be released, he’d need a place to stay. Teddy had offered that Draco could stay with him, but Scorpius knew that wouldn’t be a permanent solution. Teddy had suggested telling Harry, but something was holding Scorpius back.
He assumed Draco was in the bedroom again. He thought about calling out for him, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to say his name. Merlin, he was being a coward. His eyes strayed to the fridge as he wondered if he could simply heat up the casserole and leave. Was he really that scared of his ex-husband?
“That’s good. I was looking at a few recipe books this morning, and I found a nice lentil soup that you both might enjoy.”
“Healer Malfoy!” he called out, waving his arms wildly. Harry turned to find Malfoy walking toward them, looking confused. He sighed in relief at his luck—who knew how much longer it would have taken to get an appointment through this clueless receptionist.
Scorpius grabbed hold of his father's hand and with the other reached out for Harry's. He hung between them as they made their way down the hall to the children's activity area. Scorpius seemed to be getting really excited at the sounds of other children playing and laughing, but as soon as they rounded the corner, his face fell.
It didn’t take long for Draco to rule out any possible cause of itching in a man’s nether regions. His Diagnostic Spell revealed no infection of any sort, which matched what Potter said about never having a sexual partner. He ran his fingers carefully over Potter’s skin, even in the most intimate areas, trying to feel for any cuts or bumps, but his skin seemed perfectly fine. Satisfied that he’d done everything to make sure he wouldn’t be getting slapped with a malpractice suit for misdiagnosing the world’s saviour, Draco straightened up and removed his gloves.
They decided to walk, and Harry was just enjoying the fresh evening air when Camilla slipped her hand into his. It was soft and small. For a moment, he had a bitter flashback of walking down Diagon Alley with Laura, back when they had still been "in love", but decided to push it out of his mind. Laura was in the past now. He was supposed to be moving on.
"I brought you a present," he said excitedly, pulling the hastily wrapped spoon from his bag. She accepted it curiously, turning it over in her hands before carefully peeling back the wrapping paper. She stared at it in shock for a moment, before carefully looking back up at Harry.
“Nah, you have your own work to do. I’m just whinging, but it’ll get done. Speaking of your work, though, did you find anything new today?”
"It means the egg got stuck inside a stone for hundreds of years, until a few dragonologists found it and dug it out," came a voice from behind them. They turned to find a stern looking witch standing there.
But in the end, Harry knew he wasn’t going to refuse his son. He’d barely agreed to help before Scorpius let out a grateful “thank you!” and ended the call, clearly in a rush to deal with whatever was happening on his end.
Aside from the ill-advised drinking game, I thought last night was great too. There are very few things in this world that I love more than messing with the press and all those high-society snobs. I have to admit, I thought you were one of them not too long ago, but last night definitely set me straight. You have a wicked sense of humour, and I find I can be relaxed around you too. Dancing with you, it was the first time I didn’t pulverise my dance partner’s toes by stepping on them. I’d love to accompany you to lunch today. If you think Ellen is insufferable, I can assure you, you don’t know Tom well enough. I definitely won’t be “having a go” with him anytime soon; I was just being polite because he said he knew you.
“He looked ill,” his dad finally said. It sounded like a statement, but Scorpius heard the concerned question underneath.
Harry was having so much fun with her, that it was an odd surprise when he knocked a stack of papers off his bedside table one day, and read on the itinerary that he was supposed to go to Oslo the next day. He'd completely forgotten about that leg of the trip.
“Evil megalomaniac out to kill me, governments and major media outlets trying to defame me, deadly tournaments. You know, the usual. Now stop stalling, and let’s get going.”
"Your parents will be so mad!" he blurted, realising belatedly that that shouldn't have been his first concern when a girl he'd only known for a couple of weeks was kissing him. But that was the thing, wasn't it? They'd known each other for a couple of weeks now, and he had to admit that he liked her very much. Heck, he'd bought her something called a "love spoon" as a souvenir. No wonder she was kissing him.
So my proposition is this: come with me to the Gala next weekend. It's the biggest event of the year and I’m supposed to be meeting with a new director while there. It won’t do for me to go alone and having you on my arm may benefit us both. We let the press think we’re dating and all the scrutiny in the press will fall on us when we’re together. That means no more speculations over lunch meetings or outings with friends and it means we can both quietly attempt to date without the papers blowing things up before they’ve had a proper chance to start.
What was really alarming him, however, was that Potter knew he’d helped the girl. The story had been all over the papers, but thanks to the media liaison for the department, Draco’s name had been kept out of it. He had to talk to Potter and figure out why the man was so insistent on speaking to Draco, but he didn’t have time to “examine” Potter’s arse right now—there was an urgent case coming in. It was a shame… Potter did have a rather nice arse.
"If she asks for something, money for example, are you willing to give it to her, or do you want me to fight it?"
“It’s a matter of patient confidentiality. If you didn’t insist on meeting outside of the castle, our conversation could have been much more secure,” he pointed out.
Draco nodded, staring down into his bowl of soup. They were straying into a dangerously emotional conversation, but now that they were talking, Harry didn’t want to stop.
Draco beamed with pride at that. After sitting together for a few more minutes, Draco finally got up with Scorpius nestled safely in his arms.
It was a thrilling ride, though it reminded him a bit of the Chamber of Secrets. All too soon, Harry splashed into the pool, spluttering for a minute before he managed to right himself. He found that he could just stand with his chin above the water, and understood why the lifeguard wouldn’t want Scorpius to reach the bottom on his own. He glanced up at the platform and waved at the lifeguard, indicating that he was ready to catch Scorpius. With a nod, the lifeguard gave Scorpius, who was already seated and ready to go, a little push, and off he went. He screamed the whole way down, before splashing into the water right next to Harry. Harry reached out and grabbed hold of him, lifting him quickly out of the water. He was alarmed to see Scorpius coughing and spluttering.
“My room is almost as clean as yours!” Bryan pointed out. “And at least I don’t sleep until one in the afternoon every day.”
Draco looked up from the form he was filling out when an owl tapped on the window of his St Mungo’s office. He waved his wand to open it and the owl landed neatly on his desk. He untied the letter and offered the owl a treat, wondering if it could sense the magic that had brought it from the sixth floor of the hospital to the bowels of the Ministry.
“I’m not sure how Scorpius will feel about me moving out of here,” Draco said slowly. “Especially if what you said about him being scared of losing me is true.”
“It’s alright,” Harry replied, giving Scorpius a big smile. “I’m glad our rooms are connected, so we can have fun together all week!”
“After all the shit I see, all the ridiculous reasons people get married—and yes, I do count myself among the idiots for having married Astoria in the first place—I feel like I need to believe in true love. I need to hold on to that hope that there is someone out there, and that we’re not destined to be lonely and bitter forever. It helps to remind myself that for every ugly marriage I see, there are at least a hundred out there that don’t need my services, and that’s a wonderful thought.”
He was distracted all throughout the break, not touching the coffee Teddy bought him or participating in the conversation the others were having. His mind kept drifting back to the members of the Wizengamot, and how he really hadn’t been able to discern from their expressions what they were thinking. This was a closed case, which meant no reporters or members of the public were allowed in the courtroom unless they were directly related to the case. Scorpius had been really grateful that Harrisson had had the foresight to ask for this, since he hadn’t yet figured out how to tell his dad about all this. It suddenly occurred to him that if his papa was released from Azkaban, he’d need a place to stay. Would his dad be open to having him come home? Surely he’d be understanding of the fact that Draco had been threatened, right?
He was still in Azkaban though. The thought sobered Scorpius instantly. His father had tried to protect him, and now he was paying the price. He’d suffer for the rest of his life if they didn’t do something about it.
Scorpius suddenly realised that Teddy was talking about his mother and father. Had they been good at Quidditch? Scorpius knew so little about them, it hadn’t ever occurred to him to wonder about normal things like their hobbies.
“I still want to know how you guys went from hexing each other over Quidditch rivalries to this,” Ron said, with a general wave in their direction.
“Well, Teddy identified it for me. He’s also the one who figured out what the modifications were. That was quick thinking on your part,” he added. Scorpius knew from his career how tricky it could be to improvise under pressure. Modifying such a complicated potion would have taken a lot of concentration.
“Apparently you did. Though considering how many shots Linda convinced you to do last night, I’m not surprised.”
And there was that smile again, the one that lit up Harry’s entire face. It made Draco’s heart pound in a way that was at once terrifying and exhilarating. Inexplicably, Draco’s thoughts drifted to the most secretive of his now ex-colleagues. The Unspeakable team who studied Love Magic really did deserve more applause for their work—matters of the heart were complicated.
"Well, I'm going on vacation," Harry said quickly, not wanting to break Scorpius' heart and explain that his divorce was now final. "How about I bring you back a souvenir?"
“Actually, in terms of your wedding, everything worked out quite easily. Your friend, Hassan, had already been working on the whole thing for you.”
Draco checked his watch, and realised he did have about half an hour before he needed to make his way to the hospital. He was about to accept Harry’s invitation, when he realised that he shouldn’t be encouraging things. Harry had made it clear tonight how much he cared about Draco. Going over to his place could only make it worse.
Now it was Draco’s turn to be stunned. Could this Warren bloke be the wizard he was looking for? It seemed too good to be true—the solution to a case rarely dropped into an agent’s lap like this. But he wasn’t one to look a gift Abraxan in the mouth.
“Harry?” Teddy asked, sounding scared. As Harry’s vision cleared a little, he realised he’d actually broken two windows, one with magic, and one with his bare hands. He took a few deep breaths as Teddy slowly drew his wand, healing Harry’s hands and fixing the windows. He let Teddy guide him back to the sofa, feeling a little guilty at having lost control like that.
“I know you’re gonna lecture me about spying on the Department of Mysteries,” Harry started once her office door was closed safely behind him, not even giving her the chance to start lecturing him. “But—”
Scorpius hesitated—it was only 11 in the morning, and tea could only prolong this interview. But something niggling at his brain told him that humouring this man would solve the case sooner rather than later, and anyways, those biscuits looked delicious.
menu sticking out from behind the second page. He’d been perusing it yesterday, hoping to decide in advance what to order on his date with Malfoy. The less he had to focus on the date, the more attention he could put into questioning Malfoy.
"Papa likes roast beef sandwiches," Scorpius said helpfully, causing Draco to finally look up from his papers.
“So did they finally figure out how to help her?” Hermione asked. “Luna’s right that it’s an incredibly difficult piece of magic to cast an attack like that. Transfiguring her back into a human must have been just as challenging.”
“Well, when a patient is ill enough that we don’t have another cure, there’s usually an issue within their magical core, or else within their genetic makeup. Transfiguring their body into a healthy one wouldn’t last because the issue would reappear and make them ill once more. In fact, most Healers theorise that the body would degrade even faster the second time round.”
Ten minutes later, his express owl had been sent, tea had been poured, and Draco was curled up on the sofa in his office and watching the sun rise over the city. Having grown up in the countryside with no buildings other than the Manor visible for miles around, it had been a shock to suddenly work and live in downtown London. The sheer number of people could get overwhelming, which made Draco grateful for the isolation he usually worked in. But as time went on, he’d got used to the bustle of the city and it had eventually become exciting to him.
Malfoy contemplated Harry as the server set the crême brulée on the table and offered them both spoons.
“You don’t believe that,” Scorpius insisted, tears forming in his own eyes. He hated seeing his parents in such pain. “I know you’re angry, and shocked, and hurt, but you don’t believe that. He loved you. He still does.”
“Oh, um, you don’t have to,” Draco said quickly. “I only thought… but I mean… if you have somewhere else to be, you don’t…”
“The man took an emergency portkey around the world with his son in tow to help you file a few papers that I’m sure he could have just mailed to us. The way he was talking about you, he really knows you, and he cares a lot too.”
Draco laughed. “Trust me, being in an above ground building does nothing to guarantee you get time outside every day.” He shrunk his broom and put it in his pocket, before nodding toward the small town just down the lane. “I’d love to take advantage of the nice weather today. Fancy a stroll through the village?”
He did not expect to find the man standing there holding a set of formal robes and nattering away about something or other. He barged into Harry's room, making the bed with a flick of his wand before laying the robes out on top of the covers.
Harry, I hope you don’t worry about the confusion you experienced here. Everything has, thankfully, resolved itself. However, I also don’t want you to worry about why Zare picked you. I know you’ve been told it was an opportunity for her to change her life, and that you weren’t the man for her. But that shouldn’t impact your self esteem. I know you are hard on yourself, and I want to remind you that you are a beautiful man, both inside and out. You need to trust yourself and have faith that things will work out, because I am sure they will. You deserve good things, and they will come to you.
“Isn’t that an unfair deal, seeing as you want emergency shifts now?” the Head Auror asked, though she was laughing anyhow.
“Beats me. I spent all morning trying to find some kind of pattern in them. I put them there in case you’re able to spot something.”
“But we didn’t actually get married, right? There was no ceremony or anything,” Harry questioned. Hassan worried his lip, which in turn worried Harry.
“Yeah. It’s going to be a lot of work maintaining a long-distance relationship. But I’ll tell you another secret, Harry. You’re absolutely worth it.”
St. Mungo’s was bustling as usual, but Scorpius didn’t stop to gaze curiously at the odd conditions people seemed to arrive with. He raced down the halls toward the East wing with Teddy right behind him. They only stopped to consult a Medi-witch, who led them to Draco’s room. He was sitting on a hospital bed, looking around curiously as Adella cast a variety of diagnostic spells on him. Scorpius stood frozen in the doorway as she finished, unsure if he was allowed to go sit next to his father or not. Clearly feeling more confident about the situation, Teddy wandered into the room and plopped down on a chair next to the bed.
“No. I don’t like sand,” he insisted. Harry looked helplessly at Draco, unsure what else he could suggest. He was surprised to see a determined look on Draco’s face.
“Very well, we’ll join you in San Francisco. I guess someone has to keep you from getting married, yet again.”
Draco shrugged. “I think small amounts would be okay, but Scorpius seems to be very cautious these days. Not that I’m complaining,” he added hastily. “I really am grateful for everything he’s doing for me.”
Harry brightened considerably at that. Draco made a mental note that this was an interesting development. Harry seemed a lot more comfortable around him compared to their first date, and now he wanted to share this with his friends? It seemed Harry wasn’t very suspicious of Draco anymore.
Scorpius stared at Harry, clearly stunned at this revelation. Behind him, Draco’s secretary chuckled under her breath.
Harry laughed at that as well, waving goodbye to Draco, and then to Scorpius and Priscillia, before stepping out into the sunshine in Diagon Alley. For the first time in over a month, he wasn't thinking of Camilla.
Draco's mind was reeling. Here, in his hands, was a sheet of paper, signed by Harry Potter, stating that he owed Draco 300 thousand Galleons. For a moment he had the crazy idea that he should write to Potter and tell him he'd made a mistake. There was no way he could accept so much money.
"Scorpius, darling, I need you to please sit quietly right now," Draco said sternly. Scorpius nodded and turned his attention back to his sandwich.
"Um, very tasty. Yummy?" he tried, but nothing seemed to ring a bell with her. He rubbed his stomach and made another appreciative noise, and suddenly, she seemed to understand.
The smile Draco gave him was brilliant, and Harry was happy to get lost in it. But Ginny and Seamus had started making gagging faces across the table, and Harry was getting annoyed. He was about to tell them off, when Neville started laughing.
“I… well, I meant to,” Harry said, trying to avoid Draco’s gaze. He could tell he was going to get a lecture about this later. “I, uh… well I got distracted talking to Draco.”
After a week in the city, Harry had visited most of the destinations on his itinerary and could quite proudly say that he now knew his way around Oslo very well. He was slated to spend another week here and then head back to England, but the travel agent had said that he could easily extend his trip if he wanted to. He sent out a couple of international owls, one to the travel agent to ask him to rebook the hotel up north for another two weeks, and another to Hermione and Ron, to let them know where he was and how he was doing. Satisfied that he had seen as much of the city as he wanted (and anyways, he would have to come back here for his international portkey home whenever he decided to leave), he packed his bags and hopped on a train headed right back up north.
“Common sense is uncommon in common people,” Agent Eta pointed out. “How did you suddenly get all the information you gave us? Selpie wasn’t listed in the records I gave you.”
“The case has been solved,” Agent Eta reminded him. “And he’s no longer sneaking around trying to catch you out. You said the relationship was strictly for professional purposes. There’s no need for it now.”
Over the course of the next couple of weeks, Harry met Camilla quite regularly. Sometimes he'd meet her in the market, and she would show him all kinds of lovely spots for lunch. Sometimes he'd take her out to dinner, always inviting her parents along, though now that they seemed to trust him, they didn't usually accept the invitation. One time she'd even taken him to a fesitval where they'd listened to lively music while munching on the Norwegian equivalent of a hot dog, washed down with beer.
“Your honour, we are here today to discuss a case that was rushed due to external political influence, where evidence was overlooked, and where due process was not observed. I have requested that this be a closed court on behalf of my client, to avoid said issues recurring. For this case, I have testimony from expert witnesses as well as new physical evidence to submit to the court.
He tried to remain discreet as he glanced around at everyone in the vicinity. Unfortunately, it was a crowded room and with no other clues to rely on, Draco was at a loss. The feeling of the familiar magic was already dimming.
“Are you okay?” he asked softly. Bryan just shrugged, reaching over to sign the receipt the receptionist handed him.
“From what I’ve heard, it also has a play area for kids, and each burger comes with a little toy. It has enough space and is lively enough that they could move around and play with each other. At Harmony Table they had to sit still and speak softly, which to be honest they could do anywhere. It might be a lovely experience for people like us, but it was nothing special to them.”
It took considerably more effort to get Teddy set up on the stand. He had apparently brought diagrams and stacks of notes along to get his point across, and there were also several pieces of evidence to submit, including the journal and a little vial. Scorpius had first realised that Harrison was worth the money he was paying her when she had suggested that they look at the physical evidence for Silverthorn’s case to see if anything from there could help them. It had turned out that his flask of Polyjuice was still stored in the evidence locker, and Teddy had been able to analyse the sample, proving it had been brewed with Draco’s modified recipe. They had thought long and hard about including it, since it proved that Draco had in fact brewed the potion that was used, but in the end, Harrison had explained that in a court of law it was never a good idea to outright lie. They simply wanted the truth to be told, since it put Draco in a much more positive light than where he currently was.
This set up the family for another little bout of rapid conversation, in which it seemed like Camilla was once again at odds with her father.
“Oh, no, we’re fine,” Scorpius assured him. “I packed some pasta this morning, and Teddy has underlings to go pick up food for him. I was actually wondering… well, could you go check on Papa? I left a casserole in the fridge, but he’s still not quite strong enough to carry it to the oven and heat it up for himself yet. Usually one of us goes home to help him, but—”
“I’m going to recommend that you stay here for at least a week, Mr. Malfoy,” she said to Draco. “Your joints seem to have deteriorated a lot over the years, so I’ll start you on a course of potions for that, and it seems your body is having a lot of trouble regulating its temperature right now too.”
“I do love healing. But being the Unspeakable Liaison at St Mungo’s, I was doing a lot more surveillance and investigation than healing. I convinced myself that it was the only way to work in my dream career, since St Mungo’s wouldn’t hire me directly, but I wasn’t doing what I love.”
Harry shook his head, grinning wickedly. “Come on, tell me. Did you find the one neat guy in all of America and scoop him up?”
“The two of you must have been dating longer than I thought if he’s paying for your education. I’m surprised it took this long for everyone to find out. Though I imagine he’ll miss you if you’re in France for the next two years.”
Scorpius’ anger seemed to be ebbing away, but he remained silent, and another thought occurred to Harry.
Harry thought for a moment, then nodded. Draco handed him a sheet of parchment and a quill, and he started to write. Twenty minutes later, and with a fair amount of help from Draco, he had written what seemed to be a suitable apology letter to Camilla. He handed it over, along with the now signed contract, and Draco sealed it in an envelope labelled "Express Portkey Mail".
The American Museum of Dragonology and Creature Heritage was enormous. In hindsight, they should have expected it, seeing as they housed multiple activity centers and entire dragon skeletons, on top of the gift shops and restaurants. It took Drago almost five minutes of staring at the map to figure out where they were going. Harry had meant to help, but then Scorpius had sucked him into a game of patty-cake. They were still playing when Draco folded up the map and gave them an exasperated look.
Silverthorn’s files didn’t interest Scorpius nearly as much as his father’s had. Maybe it was because Silverthorn was just another faceless criminal, but by the time the other Aurors started trickling out for their lunch breaks, Scorpius was fed up with the reading in front of him. He turned gratefully to the floo as it chimed, but the incoming case wasn’t difficult to deal with, and within five minutes it had been handed off to MacMillian. Twiddling his thumbs, Scorpius glanced around for something to keep him occupied, before deciding to pick up his father’s journal once again.
“Here!” Scorpius called out, jumping up from his chair and point at Harry and Draco on either side of him. Draco hissed at him to sit down, but it was too late -- the wizard in purple robes had spotted them.
I know you’ve had your fair share of headlines written about you—as have I—and I don’t mean to presume to know how you feel; but if we feel the same about it then you are just as tired as I am with it all. The fact that I can’t have tea with a friend or meet for lunch to discuss a new project without being romantically linked to the individual I’m with is utterly exhausting. Lately it feels as though if I breathe too near someone the press thinks we’re shagging. If I’m being really honest, the worst thing is how utterly and completely wrong they have it. It's been such a long time since my last attempt at dating, and I’m extremely reluctant to drag someone else into this circus
His Aunt’s house looked nothing like the manor had, with its opulent décor and aristocratic features. It looked like an ordinary house, cosy and personal and with a surprising number of muggle touches. He belatedly remembered that her husband had been Muggle-born. He offered to help her out in the kitchen since she clearly didn’t have any elves, but was quickly shooed out into the hall to play with Teddy. Draco smiled when he found Teddy drawing pictures with the colour-changing markers Harry had given him earlier that week and readily accepted one of the markers. They chatted about the nonsensical things eight year olds liked to talk about while drawing pictures, and before long, Teddy was making up all kinds of games with the markers, such as cauldrons and wands (which he soon found out was really just a fancy way of saying x’s and o’s) and drawing competitions. Draco was surprised at how much fun he had engaging with his cousin and couldn’t help feeling a little guilty that he probably wouldn’t see the kid very much over the next two years.
Harry could tell that Draco was nervous. It was actually quite sweet, if he was being honest. Draco had arrived at Harry’s place dressed in beautifully tailored trousers, paired with a black turtleneck and a navy blue blazer. The dark colours contrasted with his silvery blond hair, reminding Harry a little bit of an angel. The thought felt sacrilegious, however, because Draco looked
“I wonder who would do such a thing,” Dean mused. “Do you think it had to do with the Wizengamot member?”
"Oh, no reason," he said quickly, sitting up straight and diverting his eyes. Unfortunately, his gaze landed right on her father, who scowled at him before grumbling something to no one in general.
As he led Scorpius inside, Mr. Taber continued rambling on about the annoyance of having Aurors show up at his door every other night insisting that he was being assaulted or robbed.
“Papa where does this door go? Hello, anyone home?” he called, knocking on the door that connected the two suites.
After a few days of nagging, the intern at Alternate Entrance Management had finally fixed the spell that connected Draco’s office at St Mungo’s to his lab in the Department of Mysteries. Draco could do it himself, of course, but as the Unspeakable Liaison to St Mungo’s (or Unspeakable spy, as the Unspeakable spies called themselves) he had more important things to do. Like figuring out who was Transfiguring people into animals.
“You want us to join your vacation? But wasn’t the whole point of travelling to spend time on your own?”
“It sounds like you’re going to be busy,” Harry said. Draco could tell he was trying to appear casual, as if hiding something that was bothering him. “And living so far away too…”
are boring,” Malfoy said easily. “But when I asked about your day, all you could mention was payroll auditing.”
Trying to push thoughts of Laura out of his head, he offered Camilla his arm, and they walked through the village to the restaurant together, Camilla telling him an adorable story of two children who had come to her stall during the day. They had just reached the restaurant, where the host was waiting to greet them at the door, when two pops of apparation sounded next to them.
“Okay, I’ll admit, I chickened out and only asked for three, which to be fair is still more than what I was initially going to ask for. But, he misunderstood me.”
He’d made it to the office just in time, he thought as he slipped the cloak into his bottom drawer. But when he looked up, there was Hermione, arms crossed and an expression that made it clear she knew exactly where he’d just come from.
“The court calls to order the appeal hearing for the sentencing of Draco Lucius Malfoy, arrested 15 years prior for unlicensed brewing of controlled potions, attempted terrorist plots, and accessory to the assasination of the one hundred and seventy-fourth Minister for Magic. This case was reopened by Head Auror Penelope Elizabeth Clearwater, justified by the discovery of new evidence. The Wizengamot will hear the new evidence from the accused’s council, and then review the charges as necessary. Council, your opening remarks please.”
Draco gave Harry another one of those looks before standing up and striding over to the stage. Harry hurried to keep up, casting one last glance back at Scorpius who looked incredibly excited to be seeing his two travel companions participating in this activity.
As had been the case with their first date, the conversation was surprisingly pleasant and easy. They meandered their way through a farmer’s market, down a bustling street not unlike Diagon Alley, and finally decided to sit on a patio outside the local coffee shop, chatting all the while. It wasn’t until Draco started lecturing him about how unhealthy the sugary syrups in Harry’s blended drink were that Harry remembered why they were there in the first place—he was supposed to be keeping an eye on Draco.
“You don’t.” Agent Phi was nothing if not direct. “You’ve become attached, and frankly, so has he. I know it’s going to hurt, but waiting is only going to make it worse. You need to break up with him.”
doing shots, regardless of whether they could perform magic or not. He’d been warned that it was a very quick way to get drunk, and had therefore avoided it for the past few days. But last night, he’d been feeling brave, and agreed to join Linda for one. Unfortunately, one turned into two, and then three, and… well, Harry didn’t remember what happened after that, but he was sure it must have been painful.
“No buts, Harry!” Hermione cut him off. “I don’t know what else I can do to get you to stop this obsession with Mysteries. Do you know how long it took me to convince Magical Maintenance to increase the temperature in that hallway to such an unbearable level? They hate doing anything that’ll piss of Mysteries. And yet that still didn’t deter you!”
With one last hug goodbye, Harry made his way into the airport, paid for the next flight to London and settled into the lounge to wait. The flight was uneventful, and he managed to sleep through most of it, his worries about his new marriage having been eased a bit by what Hassan said. He’d made it all the way home, unpacked, and even sent an owl to Priscillia requesting another appointment, before one of his biggest worries finally hit him in the face:
“Well, the thing is… um, Papa can’t… y’know…” Scorpius trailed off, trying to gauge his dad’s reaction. Surprisingly, Harry prompted him to continue.
That did make sense, but Harry couldn’t help feeling a little guilty about it all the same. They spent a few more minutes discussing details and catching up on the less shocking parts of Harry’s trip. All too soon, the two men were standing and Draco was holding the door open for him.
“And you will find it Harry. I know you’re feeling down on yourself because none of your marriages worked out. I know it seems a little hopeless, like no one will ever love you. But that’s not true.”
“Where is Harry? Is he coming here as well?” Scorpius didn’t miss his hopeful tone, and it made what he was about to say next so much worse.
He still seemed to be sleeping, so Harry closed his eyes and lay back against the soft bed, trying desperately to remember the events of the previous night. They'd been at the club, dancing sinfully close to each other, and then Bryan had kissed him. After someone had yelled at them to "get a room", they'd both made their way over to the bar, and snogged some more. Harry also remembered ordering more drinks, but that was where his memory started failing him.
He wandered back into the living room, wondering if his suspicions about Draco these days were just a leftover product of their childhood rivalry. Was he just so used to being wary of Draco’s actions that he couldn’t believe the man was innocent anymore? Harry didn’t like the idea that he was becoming a suspicious old fart—he wasn’t even 30, for Merlin’s sake. Hermione was probably right that he had a perfectly reasonable reason for visiting the Department of Mysteries that day. He really should learn to just give Draco the benefit of the doubt.
He shot a gentle smile at the receptionist, who smiled back shyly. “I’ll take it from here, Carly, thank you.” He gestured for Potter to follow him off to the side.
Harry groaned and rolled over in bed, pulling his pillow over his head to drown out the knocking on his door.
A few days later, Harry set out bright and early in the morning, catching the first portkey to Las Vegas. He hadn’t originally planned to start his travels there, but there had been a sale on portkey tickets and he’d decided to take advantage of it. Since America was such a big country, and he planned to see as much of it as he could, he’d decided to be a little frugal on his trip. Of course he could afford to do the entire trip first class if he wanted to, but the travel agent had assured him that staying in a hostel was an experience in itself, and that he’d meet fellow travellers that way.
“How dare you—how can you even—what the fuck did you just say to me?” Harry demanded. He wasn’t sure why it rankled him even more to see Teddy sitting calmly on the couch.
Harry considered his son’s request. Scorpius had seemed more and more comfortable lately in bringing up Draco in their conversations, and Harry hadn’t done anything to discourage it. He’d meant it when he’d said that he didn’t want Scorpius keeping secrets from him, but even more than that, he found he was starting to look forward to hearing the small snippets of how Draco was doing. Of course, hearing about him and seeing him were two very different things.
Scorpius couldn’t help the gasp that escaped him. It had been 15 years since his father was arrested. That meant that—
"Ooh, to Noway? It was really pretty when we went last week, but it was cold, and we didn't see any reindeer. Why are you going back?" Scorpius asked. It took a great deal of willpower not to laugh at the kid's mistake in pronouncing the country's name.
It was overwhelming, to say the least, and so it was with great relief that he returned to Draco’s office at the end of the week, having received an owl that his lawyer had returned and would like to speak with him.
“We’ve known each other since Hogwarts,” Draco pointed out. “Well, actually, we met once before that, at Madam Malkin’s, but neither of us knew who the other was at that point.”
Malfoy nodded. “You have your own way of helping people just like I have mine. If everyone who wanted a career where they could help people became a Healer, a lot of them would quit very quickly.”
“I… I owe you an apology too,” Draco said reluctantly. He’d been avoiding the topic, but his time in Azkaban had given him a lot of time to think, and he’d come to the inevitable conclusion. “I should have told you what was happening. I should have trusted that you’d be able to help me. I was a fucking idiot who was too proud to ask for help, and it ruined my life. It ruined
“How are you doing?” came Head Auror Clearwater’s voice from beside him. He startled before looking up at her, and noticed Teddy and Harrisson approaching them as well. Scorpius had been made to sit in the spectator gallery for this case, rather than with Teddy and the Head Auror as an expert witness. Harrisson had pointed out that having the accused’s son run the investigation cast a lot of doubt on the results, and so the case had been handed off to the Head Auror.
“Regardless, I’m investigating what happened so a list of people capable of this attack would be helpful.”
“That’s the same dragon we were smuggling out of the castle in our first year,” Harry said, pointing up at the replica.
But if his plan wasn’t working out, then why was Harry dating him? It would probably make more sense to end things now, and solve this mystery a different way. He had to admit, though, Draco was attractive, in more ways than one. In just two dates, he’d shown that he was clever, charming and considerate, and Harry was genuinely enjoying his company. He couldn’t actually fancy Draco Malfoy… could he?
Draco was greeted by sheer noise as he stepped into the Bronze Head Tavern. He would have preferred a more quiet place for their discussion, but he was quite sure he was no longer welcome in either The Three Broomsticks or The Hog’s Head. Trying not to dwell on that, he made his way over to a booth in the back where McGonagall was already sipping on a Gurdyroot infusion.
“Bryan, you know we couldn’t have had anything long term, right? I mean, I live in another country!”
Teddy nodded, already seated at his desk and pouring over the pages. Scorpius recognised that expression—Teddy was now focused on his work and probably wouldn’t reemerge until his timer startled him out of it. Deciding to leave him be, Scorpius turned and rushed off to the cafeteria, hoping he had time to grab a sandwich before getting back to work.
There was an awkward silence for a moment, before Scorpius spoke again. “I’m really glad to see you again, Papa. I’ve missed you.”
Harry was stunned. Had posh, wealthy Malfoy just ordered the cheeseburger? Clearly oblivious to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy resumed the previous conversation.
Agent Delta scowled as they marched down the sterile hallway. Interns were the worst. Logically, Agent Delta understood that as department members were lost to other opportunities, or retirement (or worse—there was no telling in this line of work), their positions would have to be filled by new members. But that didn’t make the interns any less awful.
“Perhaps one day. For now, the lodgings at the castle will be enough, I’m sure. If today’s students are anything like you were, I’m sure I won’t be having much free time anyway.”
Harry looked up at Draco with tears in his eyes, and he could tell from Draco’s gentle expression that he knew exactly what the letter said.
“I don’t think so,” Scorpius said kindly. “He’s been a bit awkward with me, but he hasn’t gotten mad.”
As he walked through the front door, Scorpius was greeted by the scent of something rich, and the sound of a Quidditch match on the wireless. He racked his brains as he shed his robe and shoes, wondering what match could possibly be playing tonight. It wasn’t until he walked into the hall room, where Teddy was wrapped in a large, purple Puddlemere United blanket, that he remembered tonight was the big Arrows versus Puddlemere match.
Draco bit his lip, staring at his son who was now beaming at the idea of spending the afternoon doing fun things with Harry.
If you’re amenable to this idea then please owl me back quickly as there will be much to prepare before the Gala. If you’re not, well, then let's blame this silly idea on the bottle of Ogden’s I’ve been sampling and pretend I never made it.
though, and Harry soon found himself out partying every night. He hoped it was just because they were in Las Vegas, a city known for its partying, and that moving on to San Francisco, and eventually across the country to New York city, he’d be able to take advantage of more touristy options that wouldn’t cost him dozens of galleons in hangover potions.
would at least make great memories and hilarious stories for him to take home. He smiled at his host, who was waiting eagerly for his answer.
Teddy nodded. “Anytime,” he called over his shoulders as he wandered off, stealing the last of Scorpius’ Pepper Imps as he went. Scorpius took a moment to mourn the loss of his candy, before deciding that it was a reasonable price to pay for his cousin’s help.
“Wrong! She didn’t predict anyone would be drafted, she went on a tangent about Squeaky Plimpies or something in the locker room showers.”
He put an arm around Harry’s shoulder, and Harry felt himself relax a bit. He’d got defensive about their jokes, but if he was being honest, his friends probably had a fair point. Draco had always been at the forefront of his mind at school, not unlike how things were these days.
Everyone nodded in agreement. They stood around for another moment, before Harry’s stomach rumbled again.
“And you,” she said firmly, rounding on Teddy. “Stop lazing around and make yourself useful. You can go get some warm clothes for your cousin, as well as a toothbrush and a couple of books. Grab me a coffee while you’re out.”
Harry seemed to be calming down now that he wasn’t talking himself into a frenzy, but he didn’t look any less saddened by the consequences of his work. Draco knew there wasn’t an easy fix to that one—Mind Healing took patience, and feelings of guilt were no exception. He conjured a glass of water for Harry, not wanting to go wandering around such a large house looking for a kitchen. Harry seemed lost in thought as he sipped the water.
Harry was still thinking about it as he made his way home. Logically, it seemed like the perfect plan, but there was still that bothersome voice in the back of his mind reminding him that he’d never dated anyone before. Not properly, anyway—neither he nor Ginny really considered their brief two months at school a proper relationship.
“You didn’t play little-league? You were good enough to get onto the house team in third year though!” Teddy pointed out.
“So if I had Transfigured her into the Hippogriff and then back, she would have been perfectly fine?”
There was a series of gasps and shocked muttering at that. Scorpius had read in his history books that many of the Death Eaters tried immediately after the great war had not received legal advice, either because they’d had difficulty in finding someone willing to represent them, or because of the negligence of the Aurors processing them. These days, however, anyone coming to trial without a legal advocate, no matter how heinous the crime, was unheard of.
“And why do you care anyway?” Scorpius cried, clearly having found a second wind. “You spent 15 years not caring about Papa. You didn’t give a shit that he was sitting in Azkaban, scared, and alone, and
“They’re fine,” Linda said, sitting down with an equally large plate of dessert. “They recuperate their profits from wimps like you who barely eat anything.”
Scorpius nodded, unsure what to say to that. As she packed her things with a wave of her wand and turned to leave, Scorpius turned his attention back to his Papa, who was watching him warily.
If you can call it that. Merlin, when I woke up this morning my head felt like there were 10 tiny bludgers bouncing around on the inside of my skull. I don’t think I’ve ever drunk that much in my entire life. My mother would be appalled. All I can say is thank Merlin for hangover potions. I wasn’t sure if you had any, but if you feel anything like I did upon waking, you’ll need it. Consider it a thank you for accompanying me last night. When we met to discuss the details, I must admit, I didn’t expect it to go anything like THAT.
"No," he croaked, sliding off the bed and fetching the dress she had dropped on the floor. He handed it to her and she snatched it away, holding it against herself as she tried to cover her modesty, curled in a heap on the bed. He averted his eyes, instead moving to his rucksack, where thankfully the majority of his belongings were still packed. He grabbed the few clothes that were strewn about and shoved them in, turning back to find that Camilla had redressed, and was crying softly on the bed.
“Attention please!” The chatter in the courtroom quieted down as the Chief Warlock stood for opening remarks.
“Luna. How are you?” Draco seemed to gravitate toward Luna, and sat down next to her. Harry took the seat on his other side.
“What’s on your mind?” Bryan asked, sitting down next to Harry on the edge of a fountain at their third hotel. Everyone else was taking pictures of brighty lit orbs hanging from the ceiling, but clearly Bryan had no interest in that.
Scorpius glanced around the dark living room, wondering where his dad might be. Teddy had mentioned him storming up to his room, so Scorpius headed toward the stairs.
I have to be true to myself and admit that I really want the chance to get to know you better and see where this goes.
“You think I’m being overbearing?” Scorpius demanded. “You’re out of line, Dad! After years of wondering where my father was, what went wrong, and why he was taken away from me with
“Billy Burgers is not a nice restaurant,” she pointed out. “It’s got hard plastic benches, is garishly coloured, and the food is cheap and greasy.”
He had discharged the second patient two days ago, after deciding that his organs were all stable, and there was no more information to be gleaned from questioning him. He’d been cooped up in his office ever since, requesting documents that might provide useful clues, and mulling over the information he’d collected.
“You have to admit, it’s suspicious! He’s a Healer—why would he be going into the Department of Mysteries? Maybe he’s bribing them into researching something Dark! Or what if they’re doing experiments on people at St Mungos? Oh Merlin, Hermione, this is bad!”
“Smith. I see you’ve met my son, Scorpius,” Harry said, his tone making it clear he’d heard everything Smith had just said.
The server looked like she had a retort for him, but a look of recognition suddenly crossed her face. Harry usually hated being so famous, but he was definitely going to take advantage of it here. He held her gaze as she seemed to be deciding between being rude to the ex-Death Eater or acquiescing to the saviour’s wishes.
Rook agreed with Elderberry. "It's quite possible that this is some kind of odd manifestation of PTSD, but we wouldn't be able to tell for sure until he decides to come in for a thorough examination. Personally, I feel that this kind of things should be at least a mandatory discussion with his general healer, but since he's technically not harming anyone, there's not much we can do about it. If you're reading this though, Potter, I urge you to send me an owl."
Harry shook his head. "I didn't get too close to them, but someone I met there said she got to meet them once." His heart twinged a little bit as he remembered Camilla's story about seeing a reindeer in the forest once, when she'd gone camping with her Pappa.
“Shall we?” Teddy asked, motioning toward the door. Only on-duty Healers and Aurors were allowed to apparate in and out of courtrooms, so Teddy and Scorpius would have to take the floo.
“It’s not that you’re doing a bad job, Scorp. You’ve taken such good care of Draco, and you should know he really appreciates it. But having him come stay with me just makes sense. Your flat isn’t designed for two people, and you have to work all day anyway. If he comes to live with me, Draco won’t have to be alone all day anymore, and you can always come visit whenever you want.”
Harry nodded, and took the opportunity to look around as Malfoy flagged down the server. He didn’t pay much attention as Malfoy placed their drink order, though by the time the server returned with the bottle and two menus, Harry’s attention had shifted to the man in front of him.
Harry spent the rest of the morning thinking about the same things that had been running around his head all night. He’d been sure that Scorpius would have ranted to Teddy as soon as he got home the night before. Scorpius wasn’t the type to keep his frustrations to himself, and he wondered if Draco would have heard of their argument.
That made Agent Delta chuckle. “I’m pretty sure he is, actually. But this way I can control how much information he has rather than having him snoop around the hospital. I’ve already had to Confund two receptionists.”
Harry turned to look at him, surprised. "Didn't the reception desk tell you I've booked a room for you both?"
“I did. I have the training of a Healer, and I admittedly do a lot of the same work as them. But in reality...” He hesitated, before chiding himself for being so cowardly. “I’m an Unspeakable. I was assigned to St Mungo’s, as a spy of sorts, to be able to keep an eye on what was happening there and manage very high profile or complex cases.”
“We’re going for lunch!” came a voice that Harry recognized as Bryan. Bryan was his next door neighbour in the hostel, but he was from somewhere near New York city, and much more familiar with the customs here. Apparently he was also much better at holding his alcohol than Harry, because he was usually the one dragging Harry back to the hostel and getting him into bed whenever the others convinced him to get absolutely sloshed.
Draco nodded, and followed Harry up the stairs. He smiled when Harry didn’t try to take his bag, allowing him to levitate it behind him instead. He didn’t blame Scorpius for not understanding his need for independence—he’d only been a child the last time he’d lived with Draco. Harry, who’d already known about Draco’s stubborn desire to do things for himself, seemed to have an easier time adjusting to it. Draco knew it was a bit of a stupid quirk, but after all the times he’d been left powerless in his life, that little bit of control was reassuring.
Just then, Harry’s stomach grumbled, causing both boys to laugh. He was definitely ready for some food, and trooped off to the common bathroom for a quick shower, and to get dressed. Bryan was still sitting on his bed when he got back, reading a sheet of paper (that had been another adjustment for Harry. He remembered paper from his primary school, but these days, he was so used to parchment that the light material felt rather odd in his hands).
“He modified the potion to thwart them!” Scorpius exclaimed suddenly. “Silverthorn started transforming back into himself before making it out of the Minister’s office. I thought it had been some kind of miscalculation, but Papa must have done it on purpose, so that Silverthorn would be caught!”
“I found those tucked into the journal when I took it out of storage,” he explained. “They weren’t catalogued, but I don’t see how they would have changed anything.”
By Friday morning, Harry was a nervous wreck. He’d been letting his brain run wild over the past few days, considering all the
Harry nodded. “It’s okay. Like you said, I’m here to experience the fun things I couldn’t do before. So let’s get going, instead of sitting here and exchanging sad stories.”
“Say, now that I think about it, you look familiar,” Smith said suspiciously. “What’s your name? Have we met before?”
dating, after all. It was probably in his best interest to keep this whole thing a secret. Harry was rather famous, and if it became public knowledge that they were dating, it would become very difficult for Draco to end things.
“I keep grousing about how I wish Draco had trusted me back then, how he should have told me the truth about what he was dealing with. But instead of learning from how I was feeling, I turned around and did the exact same thing to you. I should have trusted you with the information you wanted, especially as you got older.”
The first week and a half of Harry's trip was fabulous. He spent his days out and about with Hassan, visiting tourist attractions but also experiencing the local day-to-day life. Harry loved the bustling heat of the city, especially the outdoor markets. Hassan was surprisingly patient with him as he browsed through the stalls, especially considering that everyone around them seemed to be incredibly rushed. He examined dried herbs and spices, beautiful textiles, fresh fruits, potions ingredients and kits, and even a wide selection of toys. The bright creations reminded him a little warily of Camilla, but he pushed on, thinking instead of Scorpius, and how much he'd enjoy the multicoloured kite Harry had bought for him. Harry couldn't help the smile on his face as he imagined Draco and Scorpius running about in a park, pulling on the string of the kite as it flew higher and higher. Knowing Draco, Harry was sure he'd probably use a few subtle spells to get it as high as it could go.
Harry started eating in a bid to put off having to respond to that. If he was honest, he was still a little angry with Draco for not having trusted him all those years ago, and he was sure that Draco could feel it. But he wasn’t as angry as he’d been a few weeks ago. Spending time with Draco was making him face the fact that he couldn’t spend his life wallowing in his pain. Draco had more than suffered for the mistakes Harry was angry about. Wasn’t it time to move on?
This time it was Agent Eta’s turn to scowl. “You know full well that my job involves much more than pulling files. Anyway, Agent Phi was already examining the financial records when you asked. It’s not our fault you’re one step behind.”
“This dragon walks on two legs, like a human. The extra leg is just there for balance, like when he lands from flying.”
This piece has been such an adventure to create, and I'm so glad with how it turned out and that I got to share it with you, dear reader! I hope you enjoyed your stay at the Humdinger as much as I did <3
“Do you need…” Harry trailed off as Draco looked up at him. Harry crooked his elbow, indicating what he was offering, and Draco clearly understood from the way he shook his head.
“I don’t think that’s true,” Draco said with a frown. “I do believe that we have our true loves out there somewhere.”
Camilla groaned, and Harry turned to look at the couple, who turned out to be Camilla's father, and an elderly woman who looked strikingly like Camilla. As Camilla started arguing with her father once more, Harry turned to the lady he assumed to be her mother, giving her a bright smile and shaking her hand.
“Well, the thing about being a Healer is that regardless of any specialty or regular practice, all Healers are well versed in the various facets of Healing and medicine. Just like anyone else working at St Mungo’s, my skill set lies in everything from biomechanics to epigenetics, from endocrinology to pharmacology. Many people who knew me as a teenager tend to assume I work in potions, because of Snape’s mentorship, but overall my work lies in modern tertiary practice.”
“That’s quite clever of you to have noticed that Scorpius.” Scorpius beamed at his father’s praise, and not for the first time, Harry found himself falling in love with the obvious adoration Draco showed his son. He was clearly an attentive father, always taking the time to explain things to Scorpius or to make sure he was comfortable. It was obvious that Draco was making an effort to ensure his son grew up without the same prejudices and ignorance he had, and Harry couldn’t help feeling so proud of that.
Harry smiled at that. His mind suddenly conjured a hilarious image of Draco threatening a five year old girl in much the same way Camilla's father had just threatened him.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “And just how much time have you spent stalking around in front of their door to know that?”
“Is there anything else you need?” Harry asked as he wrapped up the remaining casserole and put it back in the fridge. He was both relieved and disappointed that this awkward lunch was over.
“Do you want any?” he asked, holding the pepper mill above Draco’s plate. Draco accepted the barest sprinkling of pepper, and no salt or cheese, despite Harry covering his plate in all three. He gave a satisfied hum at the improved lunch, and Draco seemed to perk up a bit as well, even though so little pepper could barely have improved the taste.
And then an idea occurred to him, and in that moment, Draco knew that he absolutely would accept so much money, and that he'd damn well put it to good use.
As he picked up a couple and offered them to Draco, an apology ready on his lips, he noticed that the pages he was holding were blank. Looking around at the others that he hadn’t picked up yet, he found that they were all blank. His apology melted away as the curiosity took over.
"My goodness Harry, you got a boardroom and catering just for our meeting?" Draco asked, finally realising where they were.
As soon as they got back to the city, Harry announced that he was going to leave on the next flight out. Hassan didn’t argue, and so it was with a heavy heart that Harry packed up his things. The ride to the airport was as silent as the ride back from the festival had been, but when the time finally came for the two men to part ways, Hassan pulled Harry in for a hug.
The portion of Silverthorn’s statement that was submitted into evidence ended just as he was leaving the office, where the story was picked up in the interview with the Minister’s secretary. Having already read that, Scorpius again started to focus on the Wizengamot members rather than the case itself. A lot of them were taking notes of the evidence being presented, which told Scorpius that they were actually interested. He’d seen too many trials where the court paid no attention to the case, and it never ended well for the defendant.
Olivia somehow managed to look alarmed and curious at the same time. Putting her folder down, she took his, flipping it open to read the header. She bit her lip, and glanced back at her own robbery case, before snapping the goat folder closed and spinning on her heel.
Harry shook his head, still grinning. “I was the type of student who usually found a single bent, leaking quill in the bottom of his bag about three minutes before the start of the exam. Or I borrowed one from Hermione.”
“Was it you who taught him to cook?” Draco asked casually. Harry tried not to grimace. Did Draco also think this casserole was tasteless? If so, admitting that it was him who taught Scorpius to cook would make him look awful. On the other hand, he couldn’t really think of anyone else who could plausibly have taught their son such life skills.
“Actually, I think Draco might have been the first person I really met in the wizarding world. Aside from Hagrid, of course.”
“Sneaking a magical creature into someone’s house was harder than Transfiguring an unsuspecting victim into one?”
Harry looked up at Hassan, who looked so genuinely excited at the thought of bringing Harry to the festival. It did sound like fun, and it must be a great cultural experience. He figured dressing up and dancing, and
show. An actor's Hamlet can be so defining and to have the opportunity to do it with Geoffrey Tennant! The man is a genius, and now that he’s left New Burbage to do some work in London; it's just such an incredible opportunity. (I mean—I’d work with him anywhere, but who wants to go to Canada?) I didn’t even know he had ties to the magical community!
“Harry, look, we have muggle things in our room!” Scorpius interrupted excitedly. “Look, Papa said this is a— a—”
Harry shook his head. “I think you’re doing an incredible job with him. You put so much care into even the simplest interactions with him, making sure he has the space and safety to learn, and it’s obvious that he feels the love. He’s a brilliant kid, and it’s entirely because of you.”
“Harry,” he said, putting his spoon down. “I need to make it clear that I can’t be your Healer. I don’t take general appointments to start with, but it’s also strictly unethical to date a patient. You really should register with a different General Healer.”
Draco pushed a piece of broccoli across his plate, mumbling “lentils sound great right now”. Harry chuckled at that.
“Thank you for inviting us on this trip, Harry,” Draco said, once the Telly had been switched off. “I’ve always wanted to give Scorpius experiences like this, but it’s difficult as a single parent. I can’t help wondering if I’m holding him back.”
McGonagall considered him. “As of this moment, I’m the only non-Unspeakable who knows about the monitoring program, correct?”
Harry shrugged. “There’s not much to tell. It’s mostly just reviewing financial documents and writing reports to bureaucrats explaining that they’re wasting money.”
“Teddy is a Potions Master?” his papa sounded equally surprised and delighted at the thought. Scorpius groaned internally as he realised that they were bound to spend countless hours talking about boring potions theory. As awful as it sounded to him, the thought made Scorpius smile. He hoped his papa would be comfortable having conversations like that.
“I took a lot of calming draught before you came home,” he admitted. “Definitely more than the recommended dose. I knew we had to talk about this, but I can’t do it when I’m sober. It hurts too much. You need to move on, Scorpius, because I’m never going to be able to talk to you about this without taking calming draught again, but I’m prone to potions addiction, so this is going to have to be the last time.”
“Of course, you’re also more than welcome to come home,” he said gently. “I know you only found this place because Draco was being released. That whole spiel about wanting to learn to be independent was just an excuse, wasn’t it?” Scorpius had given Harry a very well rehearsed speech about growing up and learning life skills when he'd moved out, backed by his highly independent cousin. Harry had simple laughed at it at first, having heard almost the exact same speech from Teddy when
“I tried my best to make sure they were reassigned to good positions,” Harry was still babbling. “Like the Creature By-Product Inspection Group! They didn’t need so many people anymore, since most creature by-products are imported these days. But I recommended they get transferred to The Department of International Magical Cooperation, to do quality inspection for imports!”
He thought back to their conversation last night. Harry had asked how much he should pay him, and Draco had blurted 300 Galleons.
“Okay, I really do need to get upstairs, but how about we regroup for dinner in the main dining room?”
"Oh my god!" he suddenly cried. "You're that guy! The one who ended that war! Harry, you're a hero!"
They sat down in the front row, though the trip there was not a smooth one. It seemed that everyone in the church wanted to meet him. He guessed it must have something to do with him being an outsider, and simply smiled and nodded as Camilla's father apparently introduced him to the entire community. Finally, they were seated, with two empty chairs on Harry's other side. He turned in his seat to glance around, finding that most of the church already seemed to be full. He thought about putting his scarf, or his outer robes, over the two chairs next to him to save them for Camilla and her mother, but at that moment he noticed them coming in. Camilla looked stunning, wearing a lacy white dress that came to her knees and a pink rose in her hair. She smiled at him, taking his hand as she sat down next to him. Harry glanced at her parents, but they didn't seem to mind, so he relaxed and just let the ceremony flow around him.
Without a backward glance, Harry marched back into the sitting room and through the floo. He hesitated for a moment when he stepped out into his own sitting room before letting out a loud “What the fuck?”.
"Okay, so we'll have to submit a formal statement to the courts to dissolve the marriage. We can start with your address," Draco added, pushing one of the notepads provided by the hotel and a self inking quill toward Bryan. Bryan picked up the quill clumsily—clearly, he was the type of guy who used pens - and scratched out his address. His handwriting wasn't very neat—Draco actually squinted at the page for a moment, before frowning again.
Hermione waved her hand vaguely. “It wasn’t a serious suggestion. Just stop obsessing about Malfoy.”
Figuring it would take a little longer for a new flat to look lived in, Harry decided to take a look at the bedroom while he was here. He’d imagined his son giving him a tour of his first flat, rather than having to show himself around, but it was interesting to see what Scorpius had chosen for his own home. He’d taken very little from Harry’s house, so Harry had no clue what to expect when he pushed open the bedroom door. Whatever he might have imagined, however, it did not involve Draco sitting on the bed, wrapped in a dark blue throw blanket and reading a book.
He should have known that this would be the conclusion a Healer would come to. He was sure talking about sex was no big deal for an experienced Healer, but it was for Harry.
Scorpius gave him a kind smile. “I’m sorry, I really must be getting back to the office. However, I recommend that you introduce your new crup to your neighbours, so that they’re not worrying about you every time you call him.”
It didn’t take Harry long to become friends with all of his neighbours in the hostel he’d chosen. They all seemed to be enamoured by his accent, especially the girls. Harry kept a safe distance from them, his last three disastrous trips in mind. Thankfully, despite the difference in accents, there was pretty much no communication barrier. They spent the entire first morning he was there teaching Harry how to count out Dragots, Spinks and muggle dollars. If Harry had thought that Galleons, sickles and knuts were odd, it was nothing compared to American currency. It turned out that wizards in America accepted muggle currency as part of their own, and Harry was constantly having to convert first from Galleons to Dragots, and then from Dragots to dollars.
“I refuse to eat another broccoli casserole,” Harry declared, opening the container and pouring the contents into a large pot. Harry’s suspicion had originally been that Scorpius was asking him to come help Draco as a ruse to get them to spend time with each other. While he still hadn’t ruled it out entirely, he was at least certain that Scorpius was extremely busy at work. Draco had told him last time that Scorpius often came home late and exhausted, and every time Harry had come over, the same broccoli casserole had been sitting in the fridge, waiting for Harry to season it. The last time he’d come over, even Draco, who was so careful about his diet, had begged for a bit of cheese and a sprinkling of parsley on his plate.
“I know. That’s why I wanted to see you all today. Once we’re done here, I’m going to end the lease on my apartment, and I’m meeting Teddy and Andromeda for dinner. Then I’m on the first Portkey out tomorrow morning. I’ll do all my shopping tomorrow when I get to France, since no one knows me there and therefore won’t kick me out of the shops, but at least I won’t have to sell your beautiful outfits.”
"Do you still need help decorating your new apartment, Harry?" Scorpius asked when he spotted them. Surprised, Harry shook his head.
“Very well. Remove your trousers and pants, and put this on,” Malfoy said, handing Harry a gown. “Let me know when you’re ready.”
“How old are you buddy?” the lifeguard asked, peering at Scorpius. Scorpius puffed out his chest, announcing proudly that he was five years and seven months old. Harry couldn’t help smiling at that, though the smile quickly disappeared when he realised the lifeguard was biting his lip.
“So you know those pictures I found in the journal? Head Auror Clearwater recognised the words on the back.”
“I don’t think any of you have bad intentions,” he said quickly. “From the little I know about him, I agree completely that he should be enjoying his money instead of feeling like he doesn’t deserve it. But that’s the thing; he doesn’t seem to be enjoying it. Did you know he’s terrified of heights, but because everyone pushed him to own the most expensive suite in London, every window of his shows him a dizzying 350 foot drop? You told him and Teddy three days ago that they couldn’t go to a restaurant they both wanted because it wasn’t expensive enough.”
Draco took longer to finish than Harry did, his hand wobbling a bit with each bite. When he finally finished, Harry stood to clear the dishes, but Draco stopped him.
"Come, time for eating!" she said. Harry smiled, trying to ignore the fact that he had basically invited himself over for dinner. They seemed happy enough to host him, and if he hadn't just returned from Oslo, he probably would have made dinner plans with Camilla anyway.
The shopkeeper gave him an odd look when Harry placed the four spoons on the counter and fished out his money bag to pay. Harry didn’t think much of it. The man was probably just curious to see a tourist in his shop. Thanking him with a bright smile, Harry grabbed hold of his wrapped up purchases and headed back to his hotel feeling oddly cheerful.
“Well, we don’t know for sure why Pertinger’s daughter was targeted. But Goldhorn brought up an interesting point when I was chatting with him yesterday. He said being turned into a creature made him think of the recent decision to cut funding to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. But that department is so big—who could possibly have taken such offence to the reduction in funding?”
He sighed in relief as he noticed the faint glow of a lamp from under his dad’s bedroom door. It had been a hell of an afternoon, and he hadn’t been looking forward to possibly chasing his dad throughout London.
Seamus and Neville sniggered from across the table, clearly amused by Draco’s discomfort. Harry glared at his friends—he’d made it clear that he wanted them to be polite to his date—but that only seemed to make them laugh harder. Dean and Ginny both had their hands over their mouths, as if they were trying not to laugh.
Ah, shots. He’d seen a few people do them on occasion at a couple of the clubs he’d frequented in London, but they weren’t a popular concept for British witches and wizards. American folk, however,
Deciding he needed something to take his mind off of Draco, Harry made his way upstairs to get dressed. He flipped through his selection of shirts, wondering if he should wear the dark green one Teddy had bought him for Christmas. Draco had always said that Harry looked good in darker shades of green, and this shirt would match his favourite black jeans. He laid the clothes out on the bed, and even cast an ironing charm at his shirt before he realised he was dressing to impress. This was the kind of outfit he’d wear to a nice dinner, or on a date (not that he ever went on any of those). He was just going to go heat up a casserole at his son’s house. A fancy shirt was probably overkill.
“Oh yeah, that restaurant menu was also mixed up in the pages,” Hermione pointed out. “Are you planning to go there?”
“You can go down the slide first instead of taking the stairs,” the lifeguard suggested. “That way you can show him the right way to do it too.”
Harry was stunned. He’d never quite thought of it that way. No wonder he’d been feeling out of sorts this past week.
“My question, to this day, is why. Why did he do it? I thought it was money at first, but the terrorist group who was behind the attack never transferred anything to his account, or mine. Some people suggested it was political, but that doesn’t make sense either—he voted for that Minister. I even sometimes wonder if he was threatened. But I’m sure he would have told me if that had been the case. He would have let me help him.”
“I only have half an hour for lunch. I’m guessing from this mess that you haven’t eaten either. Take a break with me and you can rant all you want about whatever mess you’re dealing with now.”
“Oh, okay. Well I guess I’ll just…” he trailed off awkwardly, and seeing no more reason to delay, he made his way over to the floo.
“Well, look who decided to join me,” Draco drawled, earning another set of giggles from Scorpius. “And right on time too. Look what I think I just found.”
“I tried to tell him to stop being so overprotective,” Harry admitted. “But he got angry at that. He’s scared that I’m going to poison you with lentil soup.”
Harry hesitated, but then nodded. There wouldn’t be much need to see Malfoy at the hospital if Harry was dating him.
“Human to animal Transfigurations are illegal,” she pointed out. “Not to mention incredibly difficult to do.”
“He would have been an amazing mentor to Teddy. They should have spent every night for the past fifteen years discussing potions theory. He should have been there for him, and for you.”
“The woman who picked you from that festival, I found out that her name is Zare. It turns out she picked you because she assumed you would take her back to the city with you. Apparently conditions have been getting more and more difficult for the tribe recently, and certain members have been seriously considering leaving their rural lifestyle and going to the city. She wanted to do the same, but her parents refused, and she didn’t think it was safe for her to go alone.”
Bryan was still mouthing something at him, and Harry had to squint through the darkness to make out what he was saying. It still wasn't clear, so Harry leaned in, hoping he'd be able to hear. It seemed Bryan had other ideas though, because as soon as Harry leaned closer, Bryan tightened his hold on Harry's back, and kissed him.
“I did not,” Harry protested, trying to ignore Draco grinning like the cat that got the cream. He wasn’t the only one either—everyone else was also smiling.
“I know. I was just hoping it could be less of a one night stand and more of a summer fling, especially when you mentioned you were planning to be in New York for a couple of weeks. I really like you, Harry, and I really wish I’d had a chance.”
“Scorpius has always been a compassionate person,” Harry said, trying to justify Scorpius’ decision. “He cares deeply for everyone he meets, and even more so for the ones he loves.”
“Well I obviously wouldn’t put too much spice in it. They can taste great with just a little salt and chicken broth mixed in, or a few fresh herbs. Those should be light enough for him.”
“I’m sorry, I feel like I often end up crying in your office,” he mumbled, wiping his eyes hastily on his sleeve.
“Will do, boss,” he teased. “Anything else you want me to get while I’m out?” he asked Draco, who shook his head. Satisfied, Teddy sauntered out of the room, and after conjuring glasses of water for both Scorpius and Draco, Adella left too.
"What do you think will be good?" Harry asked, looking down at his menu after the server had returned with the wine. He glanced up at her, and smiled at the look of intense concentration on her face as she bit her lip and contemplated the menu. He didn't even hear what she ordered for him, choosing instead to just enjoy the atmosphere and the company.
Camilla's mother snapped him out of his thoughts, coming out into the yard and saying something to her daughter. Camilla blushed, but nodded and stood up.
, the Strategic Director at Gringotts Bank, and even the Chair of the National Quidditch League—all of them were Unspeakable spies who kept an eye on the major institutions of the wizarding world and handled any major problems that arose. He knew that Harry, who had built a career in ethics review, would never approve of such a system. It was a little discouraging, but Draco was a professional who had a case to manage.
He didn’t want the emergency shift, but he did want the time to read. He was about to nod, when a pompous voice interrupted their conversation.
It made sense to Harry. Everyone contributed to the world in their own way—he and Hermione kept the Ministry in line so that it could continue to serve the magical population the way it should. Ron kept the community safe as Head Auror. And Malfoy healed people when they needed it. He Transfigured animals back into humans, and helped people who… well, Harry wasn’t sure, but now seemed the perfect time to find out.
Draco nodded. He took another sip of his wine, hoping against hope that she wouldn’t ask how. That hope was dashed within seconds.
Bryan grinned, grabbing Harry’s hand and dragging him along to join the others. As the afternoon wore on into evening, Harry found himself enjoying his trip and his new friends more and more. They danced with a bunch of impersonators, watched a light show in a giant pool at yet another fancy hotel, and as usual, rounded out the night in yet another club.
"You will have fun," she stated blandly. Harry could tell she was disappointed, and cast around for something to say to cheer her up. It was then that he had an idea.
“Are you carrying around a folder of blank pages?” he asked, reaching down to gather more of them. Draco got down next to him to help with the task.
Scorpius could recognise that his thoughts were spiralling into what-ifs again. He stood up for a moment to stretch, then put the journal aside and re-opened one of Silverthorn’s folders. He set aside the catalogue form of other potions that had been in the warehouse, and turned to the next document, which was an interview with the Minister’s secretary about what had happened that afternoon. It seemed pretty straightforward. She’d been confused to see Silverthorn coming out of an office that was supposed to contain only Harry Potter and the Minister, and had stunned him before raising the alarm and calling the Aurors. They’d arrived just as Silverthorn was completing the transformation back to himself, and had seen just enough to conclude that he’d Polyjuiced as Harry Potter. Not that the deduction had been necessary—they’d found the vial of polyjuice in Silverthorn’s pocket, mostly empty but with enough traces left that the Ministry experts had been able to identify it.
Harry blushed at that. “I, um… I’ve never been very trusting of Unspeakables, if I’m being honest. They’re the only department at the Ministry that we don’t have oversight over, and that’s always made me a little suspicious. I may have… well, I did a little spying of my own.”
Draco stared at the page, unsure what he'd just read. He'd never heard of asexuality and had no idea what it actually was, but surely it wasn't as messed up as Skeeter had made it out to be (because of course it was her who'd written this). Even the picture of Harry that they'd included with the article was unflattering, showing him from a side profile looking angry and stressed. No wonder the man had fled London.
"I think I have to go home soon," he said to Camilla as she pushed open the front door. She looked a little sad, but nodded.
“I want to tell him the truth. I don’t want to be lying to him anymore. Unspeakables… we don’t usually have relationships. And if we do, it’s usually with other Unspeakables. I’ve thought about trying to recruit Harry to the department, but he wouldn’t want that. But if I tell him, doesn’t that create a precedent, that all Unspeakables can tell their significant other about their work?”
“So I was the consequence of not completing the goal? I guess the goal was to create polyjuice with Dad’s hair.”
“It’s time to head back,” Harrison said, watching carefully as Scorpius abandoned his now cold coffee and stood up. He was still worrying about the logistics of his papa potentially being released from Azkaban as he resumed his seat in the courtroom. Chiding himself for worrying about things that weren’t certain yet, he turned his attention back to the proceedings.
Draco gestured to the room at large, trying to dispel the awkward pause as they both remembered the incident in the hospital cafeteria. They’d been on a couple more dates since then and while Harry had continued to ask all sorts of probing questions, they hadn’t talked about Draco’s colleagues any further.
Ron shrugged. “Probably. We didn’t see who did it though. The initial call was just that there was a Hippogriff in the family room, not that there was an attacker.”
Agent Delta let out an undignified snort. “I’m the one who’s doing all the work. Agent Phi just signs the paperwork.”
Over the past few months, Harry and Scorpius had spent many days together, shopping for and decorating the empty apartment. Harry had originally invited him as a way to take him off of Draco’s hands for a while, but as the weeks turned into months, his relationship with both Malfoys had bloomed. Harry now had a very cheerful and well thought out apartment that he was sure Scorpius considered to be a second home by now. Draco had already mentioned that he was looking for a place in London, since the Manor was inconveniently far from both Scorpius’ charms school and his office. Harry had finally gone out last night and made a second copy of the key to the apartment, and had wrapped it carefully in golden paper, along with three other gifts: a poker chip he’d nicked from a casino in Vegas, a string of beads he’d brought back from Chad, and the extra love spoon he’d bought in Norway all those months ago. Since their return from San Francisco, Draco had been helping him understand that all these symbols for love didn’t have to end in marriage. They were just more ways that humans had come up with for expressing their love, and they were all beautiful in their own way. While Harry wasn’t sure if he ever wanted to get married again, he was planning to ask Draco to move in with him after Scorpius went to bed tonight.
Draco couldn’t help laughing at Harry’s confession. This must have been when Alternate Entrance Management botched the connection between his office and his lab.
“Everyone is surprised at my presence?” Draco muttered, turning to glare at Harry. “You said you told them!”
"Prayer," she said simply. Harry wondered why no one else in the church was coming up to the front. Maybe it was because he was the newcomer?
“The group that Draco made Polyjuice potion for 15 years ago threatened to kill Scorpius if he didn’t cooperate with them. The recipe that Draco brewed was analyzed recently, and it shows that he purposely changed it so that the murderer would get caught. The Wizengamot decided that he had served enough time for his role in the crime, and released him.”
Harry nodded along, intrigued. He hadn't played football since he was a little kid at primary school, and even then Dudley and his gang had often made sure that Harry got as little playing time as possible. Perhaps he could try it here?
What was really interesting to him, however, was the personal notes or comments Draco had left about his daily life. Every so often Scorpius found a little grocery list, or a reminder on the corners of the pages, such as “Ministry Gala tonight” or “mow lawn this weekend”.
"She wanted it in writing. I've drawn up a contract for you, stating that you will pay all the related fees for her to attend the University of Oslo, and in exchange, her minister will perform the marriage dissolution. You don't have to go back for it—just sign and you'll be rid of her for good."
“Paperwork sucks,” Scorpius agreed. “I’d offer to help, but I’d definitely be more of a hindrance than a help.”
Scorpius nodded happily. “It went higher than the Manor! Grandma had to magic more string for it to keep going up!”
Draco couldn't help beaming at that. When was the last time anyone had been proud of him? As they left the station, hand in hand, Draco realised that it didn't matter. The past was the past; he just had to keep moving forward. It was a bit of a scary thought, but with Harry by his side, it was going to be wonderful. With Harry by his side, everything was going to be okay.
“Um, well, there’s not much he can eat. He has to be really careful about his diet, because of his joints, and because he’s not used to… well, you don’t exactly get curry in prison.” It had been a shock to Scorpius when Adella had explained to him how strict Draco would have to be about what he ate, at least until he regained some strength. He’d never been faced with the reality of what inmates in Azkaban ate until he’d seen his father vomit from a plate of roast beef and gravy—it had been too rich for him to stomach.
“And of course the new intern panicked and called St. Mungo’s, even though I could easily have handled salamander blood burns on my own. So that meant I had to waste an hour at St. Mungos, answering mundane questions about what caused the explosion, and what was in the potion, and what I’m allergic to, as if Adella doesn’t already know my entire medical history.”
“Help. His name is Help. Odd, isn’t it? Part of me wants to train it out of him, but I don’t want to erase that history either.”
Scorpius shook his head. “That’s what’s confusing me. These instructions result in a potion that wears off
“Thank you for bringing me home, Harry,” he said softly. Harry was about to reply that he was happy to do it, when Draco leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on his cheek. It was such a chaste gesture, but at the same time it was so intimate, that all Harry could do was choke out a strangled goodnight and escape into the Floo. The spinning sensation distracted him for a moment, but by the time he stepped onto his own hearth, he had to face one inescapable fact—he was definitely falling for Draco Malfoy.
Harry stood up and crept toward the door. He listened for the sound of approaching footsteps, but when he heard nothing, he stepped out into a sparse hallway with grey walls. There were a few doors to the left, with light coming from underneath one of them—that must be the washroom. To the right was the only personal touch he’d seen in this flat so far—Draco’s broom, which was leaning against the wall next to the front door. It was the same broom he’d brought on their second date, a sleek Nimbus 3000. The competition from that afternoon had brought back a feeling of excitement that Harry hadn’t felt since Hogwarts. There had always been a unique thrill in challenging Draco, whether it was on the pitch during a game of Quidditch, or in the halls of Hogwarts as they taunted each other mercilessly.
“Yes please,” Harry said, nodding at the witch. He glanced back at Draco. “See? It’s the one you wanted.”
The obvious solution was to go ask Teddy, but after knocking for a few minutes, Harry concluded that he wasn’t home. He racked his brain trying to think of where else he could get Scorpius’ address. He had one idea, but he wasn’t quite sure how well it would work...
I apologize. I was a bit drunk and I suppose my alcohol-addled mind really wanted to stick it to the press and conveniently forgot that there were no reporters outside your front door.
As they sat down at the table, Harry held out Camilla's chair for her, which earned her father a glare from her mother. Harry glanced around and was relieved to see that the restaurant was as nice from the inside as it was from the outside. He took a moment to wonder why he was so worried about impressing this girl and her family when they'd only met a couple of days ago, but pushed it out of his mind. She seemed sweet, and he enjoyed doing nice things with friends.
Harry nodded, feeling proud of his son for being so mature. It was at that moment that Draco returned from the floo, and after a series of goodbyes, and promises from Scorpius to come visit whenever he could, Harry took hold of Draco’s elbow and together, they stepped into the floo.
Harry shook his head urgently. Hassan nodded in agreement. “I do not think they will give you any trouble once everything is explained, but if you still need help, I would be happy to offer my assistance.”
“One day, Draco decided that he would go looking for Harry. He got up from his nest and set out to find his friend.”
They finished eating and cleaned up the kitchen, before heading into the bedroom to pack Draco’s things. It turned out that he only had a few sets of clothes, his toiletries, and a small collection of books—everything else that he used belonged to Scorpius.
Teddy had returned just as his papa had finished explaining what happened, confirming that he’d explained things to Harry, who had said he wanted some time alone. Scorpius had managed to wait exactly four hours and thirty-seven minutes before racing into the floo, hoping to talk to his dad.
"But I don't wanna go to school, Papa!" Scorpius whined. "If I go to school, then I won't see Harry when he comes to visit anymore!"
“Watch carefully, Scorp. You have to do it the way I do it so that you don’t get hurt. I’ll go first, and wait to catch you at the bottom.”
“Come on, let’s go join everyone!” Joel called. Without waiting for a reply, he downed his drink  and stood up, wandering out into the crowd and quickly attaching himself to a girl they’d never seen before, but who seemed quite pleased with the attention nonetheless.
He must have been staring at her for too long, because her expression slowly started to shift from amused to concern.
“I think you might have confused a couple of words there,” Draco pointed out. “Epigeneology is a thing, but it’s not common at St Mungo’s. Generally, when a word has the suffix ‘-ology’, it means the study of something. For example, Magizoology is the study of magical creatures. Healing classifies a lot of disciplines this way such as physiology, which is the study of how humans bodies function, or psychology which deals with mental processes. As Healers, we apply these fields of study to diagnose and heal our patients.”
“You can’t tell her you know,” Draco said conspiratorially. He knew it would come out eventually, and that Hermione would kill him when it did, but he couldn’t bring himself to care about that at the moment. The fact that Harry was taking this so well was making him deliriously happy. “But it’s actually she who reviews our work. She’s just bound to secrecy.”
His dad gave him a small smile. “Don’t worry, you won’t be sent out to arrest me for being drunk and disorderly in public or anything like that. I only did it because there was a war happening. A war that’s been over since before you were born, so please promise me you won’t get mixed up in any leftover tensions from it?”
"It... yeah. It got to all of us. Um, how about we try to find some breakfast? I doubt we'll have any hangover potion here."
“But you’re not going to come anymore, are you? You’re going to go home with that posh lawyer and his adorable kid.”
“If that’s Teddy’s room,” Draco said slowly, “and that’s Scorpius’ room… did you build a fourth bedroom?”
Harry smiled at her. “Of course I know. Anyway, I don’t think I would have been any better at partying when I was 22 either, so it doesn’t really matter.”
“I’ve also been learning that it doesn’t have to be instant,” Draco continued, staring blankly at the TV. “Turns out, it’s possible to fall in love with someone over a long period of time. One day it’s their smile that you can’t stop thinking about. Then a month later, it’s some careless mannerism of theirs that keeps you up at night. Then weeks after that, it’s their generosity in inviting you on a trip that makes your son so happy he looks like he’s going to burst, and their active participation in making his life as wonderful as possible, that makes you realise you’ll never want to spend your life with anyone else.”
Luckily Draco seemed to have a lot more tact than Harry, and picked up on what was happening right away. He stepped forward, accepting the hug for a moment, before turning once again toward the door.
Once Scorpius had declared his dragon “complete”, the attendant returned with a little bronze plaque, charming his name and the date on it, before levitating the dragon into the display case full of hundreds of other misshapen dragons. Scorpius was admiring it proudly when a wizard in long purple robes swept into the room.
The other bonus to working for Millicent would be that he no longer had to work as a prostitute. It cheered him up immensely to think that he would never have to have sex again. As he thought about it, he realised that he should probably contact his aunt, and take her up on her offer to get to know his cousin. Now that he could honestly say he worked a normal (and safe) job, he wouldn't have to lie to her about his life.
“I have to find something to prove all this, but Head Auror Clearwater said I can probably reopen the case if I do.”
They sat there in silence for a little while, and Scorpius contemplated telling his dad that he was looking into the case, that it had been handled by an incompetent kiss-arse, that he was bound to find some answers soon. But then his dad started speaking again, and he realised that telling him about the case would have been a mistake.
Aside from his second date with Harry, he hadn’t flown in ages. Truth be told, it was a little boring on one’s own. He had been riveted by the thrill of chasing a Snitch and racing Harry around the countryside that day, and was longing to do it again.
"Are you the only one in your family who knows English?" Harry asked her one evening as they sat in the yard, digesting another delicious dinner.
Harry bit his lip. He wondered if she knew that the reindeer he'd purchased from her on that first day had been for Scorpius. He wondered if she'd expected them to have kids of their own.
Harry’s jaw dropped as he realised what Draco was saying. He wasn’t sure how to respond, but didn’t need to when Draco kept talking.
Agent Delta hesitated. It was standard protocol to exchange plans and updates with Agent Eta, in case either one was ever compromised—that way the other could take over their assignments. But Agent Delta’s recent decision had been a little… unorthodox.
Either way, if you find need for it, I hope you enjoy the hangover potion. It’s my own variant, not that store bought sludge.
“I’m Draco and this is Harry,” Harry said quickly, grinning at the sound of Scorpius’ roaring laughter from the front row. Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t bother to correct Harry’s cheesy joke.
“If Draco’s going to be here for a week, you’d better start looking for a flat asap. Unless you want to tell Harry?”
"Very soon," she whispered, biting her lip. It looked like she was trying to make a decision, but finally nodded.
“Thanks for that, Dad,” Scorpius said softly. “And for lunch,” he added, smiling as he opened it to find two individual sized chicken pies, along with a bunch of snacks and a thermos full of coffee.
Harry gave a large huff of frustration, but he knew he wasn’t going to get anywhere with Hermione right now. They had pub night with Ron tonight—perhaps she’d be a bit more amenable with a few drinks in her.
"Kroom-ka-kay?" he repeated, unsure of his pronounciation. She laughed, but didn't bother to correct him, instead shaking the box in his face. Laughing with her, he took one and bit into it. It was delicious. The cone tasted similar to a waffle ice cream cone from Fortescue’s, and was filled with a delicious cream filling.
He flipped to the page with the notes about salamander blood, and confirmed that his dad had in fact written the number eight, and not 3.
Teddy’s hair turned green, the way it always did when he was gearing up for a speech on potion’s theory.
“I wish I could show him that I’m okay. I really do appreciate everything he’s doing for me, but it’s really stressing him out.”
“Well, my advice would be to call out “Fire!” if ever there’s a real emergency, just to attract peoples’ attention. It’s something we teach a lot of children as well, because people often disregard a cry for help from a child as part of a game.”
“Why are you requesting an appointment with me, Potter? I’m sure you already have an assigned General Healer.”
“I… a little bit,” Scorpius admitted. “I’m sure things will start to slow down again soon. I’m doing okay though.”
But it still sucked. Perhaps they should stop at the Head of Secrecy’s desk and explain exactly how unsafe and inconvenient this commute was. After all, Agent Delta now had to travel by public Floo. The indignity of it was unacceptable.
Ginny and Harry glanced at each other and rolled their eyes. Head Auror Ronald Weasley wouldn’t have taken someone to St Mungo’s if they were a victim of a Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes prank—it was an open secret that he did development for them in his spare time, and was quite familiar with all of their products.
"Nonsense! You stay here!" she insisted. Harry considered her for a moment, before deciding to accept.
Harry nodded, trying to absorb all the information. He didn't know if everything Draco was saying made complete sense, but he'd gotten the important part; she was okay with the divorce.
“I don’t think your mum was ever on a team, but Draco said she was a pretty good flier. Draco and Harry were Quidditch rivals when they were at school. They were easily two of the best seekers in their generation.”
"Well, have a good trip, Harry," Draco said purposefully, clearly trying to prevent Scorpius from asking anymore embarrassing questions.
Congratulations on your performance, it really was very well done. If I remember correctly, your talent for drama was nurtured from a young age (don't even try to deny that you were a dramatic little shit) and I'm glad to see it's served you well in adulthood. I guess it goes to show that practice really does make perfect.
“That’s true, but looking back, he was absolutely right. I should have trusted him, at least when he got a little older. I thought I was protecting him, but…”
He was glad to get a chuckle out of her for that. He glanced at the clock on her mantle and was surprised to find how late it was.
“That’s wonderful, Draco,” Luna said, handing his wand back. “Did you ask him for a good amount like we discussed yesterday?”
“Um, Harry left Draco, not the other way around, gentlemen,” the host said, and realising their mistake, Harry and Draco rushed to switch positions, making the audience chuckle.
McGonagall sighed. “While human to animal Transfiguration is complex, it is manageable by most people who do their NEWT in Transfiguration. Part of our intrinsic magic records the original state of the human, so that when they are transferred back from the animal state, the caster’s magic restores them exactly as they were, without conscious thought from the caster.”
"I brought you liquorice chocolates, actually," Harry said, handing the neatly wrapped box to Draco. "They're considered a delicacy there."
noticed about Malfoy was that he somehow still looked like a wealthy aristocrat in his lime-green Healer’s uniform. Most Healers Harry had met wore simple trousers and a plain shirt under their robes, but Malfoy was dressed in shades of grey—an ash grey pinstripe waistcoat over a light grey shirt matched with solid ash grey trousers. Harry would never have thought to pair a navy blue tie with grey and lime-green, but it seemed to be working for Malfoy.
There was a little murmuring among the Wizengamot members as she said this. It was the same type of worried discussion that broke out among older witches and wizards anytime Death Eaters were mentioned.
“I’m so glad you were both able to join me,” Harry said, leaning back against the pillows. “All my travels so far have been great, but San Francisco has been the best trip so far.”
Draco nodded eagerly, surprised at how easily everything seemed to be falling into place. As he reached across the table and shook McGonagall’s hand, he couldn’t help thinking that it was about time.
"It's a thing here, you can get married at pretty much any chapel on the street. People come here to elope all the time," Bryan explained. "It's one of the things Vegas is famous for. I just don't know what we're gonna do now."
“Yeah. The magic involved was a little different from the first patient I treated since this is an adult, but overall things have been going smoothly.”
At that moment, the server reappeared, ready to take their orders. Harry glanced quickly at the menu to double check that the ravioli was still an option before placing his order.
“Wait!” Harry called as he watched Draco walking away. He got up and ran over just as Draco turned to look at him in confusion.
Just then the server slid the bill onto the table between them. He was discreet, but it drew their attention anyway.
Scorpius nodded along as he decided to order green curry for himself. Adella had been Teddy’s best friend at school, and was now a Healer at St. Mungo’s. She often ended up treating both Teddy and Scorpius whenever their work sent them to the hospital.
“I’m going back to my own room where there’s no gross kissing!” he declared. He marched off through the door that connected both rooms and clambered onto his own bed, hiding under the cover for good measure. It was too much for Harry, who started laughing at Scorpius’ antics. He turned to find Draco laughing as well.
"Oh, that's a good one," he chuckled, helping himself to yet another chocolate. "Accidentally got married. Hah!"
“I don’t mind,” Draco said, still grinning at him. “If I’m being honest, these days I’m fairly obsessed with you too.”
“I’m sorry too,” he said finally. “I shouldn’t have made you feel guilty last night. Even if you had stood up for Papa, I don’t think you would have been able to do much. They would have still sent him to Azkaban. You were trying to protect me, and you did your best in a shitty situation.”
"How did we even...? I don't even remember... huh?" Harry was stunned. The whole point of coming to America was to pick an English speaking country so that he wouldn't get married by accident. And yet...
He also fared well enough in a lot of the physical races. While he wasn’t used to running on sand, he’d mostly been able to keep up with the other guys, many of whom were much taller than him and therefore had longer legs. The real curveball, however, had been the camel racing. Harry had been terrified at first, when the tall creatures had walked up to him, but as Daneri showed him the different commands the camel had been taught and how to hold himself up, sitting between the neck and the hump, Harry started to realise that this wasn’t much different from having ridden buckbeak, or the thestrals, or even a dragon (though he couldn’t imagine anyone ever putting a harness on a dragon). Shaking his head at the ridiculous things he’d done in his school years, he set off, bouncing on the camel’s back as he followed the others.
“Merlin, I hope it’s actually an unregistered Animagus,” she grumbled, marching away. Scorpius chuckled, sighing in relief as he opened the folder. It seemed to be a typical case of someone having moved into a new apartment and not updated the wards right away, which provided a prime opportunity for someone to break in and steal a family heirloom and a money bag full of gold.
Harry smiled at that. “I remember feeling like that myself, the first time I lived on my own. I kept fretting about having a theme or something to decorate around.”
Harry laughed. “I don’t even know if I’m a decent seeker anymore. Can’t remember the last time I had a proper game if I’m being honest.”
After a little tussle with Camilla's father over who would pay the bill, and a short walk to accompany them all home, Harry said goodnight to the little family, feeling satisfied in a way that he didn't quite think was due to the food.
“I’d better get back then,” Scorpius said softly, standing up and straightening his trousers. He glanced back at his dad, who was watching him carefully.
Harry looked up to find Draco scrutinising the marriage certificate and comparing it to some notes he'd laid out. He wasn't paying attention to Harry at all.
"Let's ask him now," Harry said, standing up and offering her his arm. A few minutes later, he found himself in her parents' living room, being shouted at by her father. Clearly he didn't find the idea of going to Oslo nearly as lovely as his daughter did.
“I’m not!” Agent Delta exclaimed, a little too quickly. Some secret agent they were. “It’s to be able to keep an eye on him, to know how far he’s digging.”
A moment later, the door to his room creaked open, and Camilla slipped in, still wearing her formal clothes, though her hair had been let down. She closed the door, then made her way over to the bed. Confused, Harry watched as she undid her zipper, and let the dress fall to the floor. She was just climbing onto the bed when his brain kicked in.
“Do your other colleagues in the hospital behave like this?” he demanded. “You should report her behaviour! She has no right to treat anyone like that!”
Draco nodded. “There’s a lake near the castle. But there’s also a giant squid in the lake, and if you’re not careful, he might reach onto your boat and snatch your passengers!” Draco teased, snaking a hand up the side of the floating and tickling Scorpius’ foot. Scorpius squealed in delight and turned to Harry.
Harry nodded. “He said a few things that… well, he just gave me a lot to think about. But you don’t need to worry about it now. Go ahead and get your work done, I’ll take care of lunch.”
Harry stopped walking and turned to face Draco. They were standing much closer than was probably appropriate for a public street, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to step away.
"Whe—where are you going?" he managed to stutter out. Draco kneeled next to his son, rubbing his back in an attempt to calm him down a bit.
“I asked Teddy to go over the potion for me once I realised it had been modified. It turned out that the changes made the potion wear off faster. At first I thought it had been designed to allow for a tight window of use, but after reading the case files, I realised that Silverthorn, the guy who actually cast the killing curse, hadn’t expected the potion to wear off so soon. Thankfully he didn’t suspect that it had been Papa’s doing, otherwise who knows what his partners would have tried to do to you and me.”
“Um, there was a war, in Britain. It technically went on for decades, but it got really heated while I was in school. A lot of us ended up fighting in it. When you’re trying to make sure you and your friends don’t get murdered, partying and having fun tends to take a back seat.”
"What?" Harry demanded, scooting forward on the bed even though his stomach was turning. He pushed up against Bryan, leaning on his back to read over his shoulder.
“No wonder you didn’t want to wake up this morning,” Draco sighed. Harry looked up to find him leaning against the door to his office, looking exhausted. “Scorpius, I’m going to borrow Harry for a few minutes, and then you can continue talking his ear off.” Harry couldn’t help grinning at the fondness that always came through whenever Draco exaggerated about his son. He followed Draco into his office and watched as he collapsed into his chair.
“It’s not easy, being a parent,” Draco pointed out. “You can’t always tell what the right decision is in the moment.”
“Oh yeah, you’re a Healer, right? Why were you at the hospital, Harry?” Ginny asked worriedly. “Everything okay?”
“Teddy!” Draco exclaimed, turning to look at his cousin. “Merlin, you’re all grown up too. Has it really been 15 years?”
“I… this wasn’t my fault, Dad. Anyway, I wouldn’t have said anything if he hadn’t interrupted our conversation and started insulting my boss.”
have fought for him, even if it ended up being fruitless. I should have trusted him, and tried to figure out what had happened, instead of jumping to conclusions like everyone else. He was my husband—I shouldn’t have let him go so easily.”
“He has very advanced arthritis. Azkaban is very cold, and damp. He’s been sleeping a lot since he was released. It’s only his physical strength that was affected, though. His mind is still wicked sharp. I bet you he and Teddy are arguing about potions theory right now.”
“Polyjuice,” she confirmed, identifying the potion much faster than Scorpius had. “Have you managed to figure out this code in the margins?”
His dad frowned, glancing at the pot, and Scorpius could already tell that he was going to be sent home with the leftovers.
“I… you… that wasn’t…” Potter spluttered, clearly not having expected Draco to start flirting with him.
Draco bit his lip. How could he explain his solitary lifestyle to Harry without giving himself away?
Harry nodded. "More than anything. I meant it when I said I really enjoyed spending the afternoon with Scorpius. And with you," he added, satisfied that his comment made Draco blush.
Draco seemed equally embarrassed at the misunderstanding. Harry definitely didn’t have anywhere else to be these days—he would have probably just gone home and moped about for the rest of the afternoon. It made sense that they should both eat lunch together. After all, how could he know for sure that Draco wouldn’t hurt himself cleaning up after he ate? Yes, Harry decided. He should stay, for Draco’s safety.
He led Scorpius over to the plush sofa and picked up the remote. The screen lit up to reveal a channel guide, and Harry quickly navigated to a kids station. Draco joined them on the sofa, and father and son both seemed captivated by the bright colours and the animated characters. Thankfully, the show was just starting, so they were able to understand the gist of the story. Since he hadn’t watched TV in quite a long time, Harry was unfortunately unable to answer most of Scorpius’ questions. When he found that no one really had the answers he wanted, Scorpius started focusing more on the show, and eventually the questions died down.
“Well, he’s here now,” Scorpius said, giving him a small smile. “I’m glad you guys have been getting to know each other again.”
It seemed to pay off today, however, as he heard graceful footsteps approaching at the far end of the hallway. Harry squeezed himself up against the wall and held his breath as they got closer. The hallway was quite wide, but it was a leftover instinct from his Hogwarts days.
"What are we doing tomorrow?" Harry asked curiously. They hadn't planned much of an itinerary beyond today, but Harry had assumed that by now he would have seen all the big attractions and would have a better idea of how he wanted to spend his remaining week and a half here.
Draco drew his wand and cast a bunch of complex Privacy Spells over their table. McGonagall raised an eyebrow at him.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Vegas is a classic case of people getting hitched without thinking it through. I should have known to warn you about it."
Thankfully, it wasn’t hard to locate. Scorpius found it in the same filing cabinet that his father’s case had been in. The problem was, Silverthorn’s case file was actually three files, all of which were substantially larger than his father’s. With a sigh, he pulled them all out and headed over to his desk, resigning himself to another couple of days of reading.
"Won't your parents be joining us?" he asked, smiling at the elder couple. Camilla looked stunned for a moment, before turning and explaining the situation to her parents. They both looked stunned as well, before her mother reached out and pinched Harry's cheek.
. That’s what Draco did, though. The Polyjuice that the killer used to get into the Minister’s office wore off before he could get out, which was why he was caught. If he hadn’t been caught, they would have thought it was you, which would have set off a major international incident. This way, the political situation was mostly contained, even though it cost the Minister his life.”
"Okay, I think it's time to find a primary school for you, Mister. You're like a sponge—sitting here is doing you no good whatsoever."
“Oh man, I heard about that. Our history professor mentioned it at school one day, and there was a bit about it in the papers too. Apparently it was a teenager who finally ended everything?”
Two hours later, Harry found himself slumped in his chair at the tacky restaurant, regretting every decision he’d made that had led him to this point. He was
Harry shook his head. “I’d really rather see Healer Malfoy. It’s more about trusting the Healer than their specialisation. Surely he can squeeze me in somewhere?”
“Look at the fishes!” Scorpius called one afternoon, hanging off of Harry’s arm as they admired a mural of street art.
“Well, I’ll get out of your hair then, now that that’s been cleared up,” Scorpius said, putting his tea cup down.
Draco let out a bitter laugh. “Not with the way things have been going for the last seven years. No, I’m just glad she wasn’t here to witness it.”
For the first time in his life, Scorpius didn’t groan about being stuck on emergency duty. The emergency Aurors spent the day sitting around the Aurors’ emergency floo line and post box, waiting for calls from the community. They then distributed them to whichever Aurors weren’t already out in the field, or the MLE interns if it was of low enough priority. The thing was, they were living in relatively peaceful times, so aside from the odd robbery or accident out on Diagon Alley, or old ladies whose crup climbed a tree and couldn’t get down, it basically meant a very boring shift. Most Aurors would bring their other case work to do while sitting at the emergency post, but they were only allowed to leave for urgent washroom breaks and a late lunch, when someone else was available to cover them. Scorpius usually spent emergency duty shifts bored out of his skull, but today he was glad for it—it would give him time to keep studying his father’s file.
