It takes an agonizing few minutes for him to sort through the magically automated file-books at his disposal, but when he does, he tells Harry the room that Draco is in, and watches with wide eyes as Harry tears through the hospital’s anti-apparition wards on his way up to the fourth floor. Several green-robed eyes turn to face him with frightened looks, though they calm the smallest bit when they see his dark robes, and part easily for him as he storms down the winding hallways to Draco’s room. Many red-robed Aurors are stationed outside of certain rooms--likely protections for high-profile patients. The Auror standing by Draco’s room is Auror is standing half-asleep if her crossed-arms and nodding head are any indication.
“Thank you,” Draco grits out, gratefully accepting the cloth. He presses his heated nose into the cool fabric and breathes in.
Draco knows that he has a not inconsiderable amount of influence. Having a parent in the inner circle alone would have seen to that, even without his respected lineage. This, though, is undeniable proof that people are paying attention to him. It’s scary. It’s flattering. It will undoubtedly be interesting. Above all, it may get his mind off of the looming sense of doom that has made its home in the back of his head.
“Excellent spellwork, darling,” Sonja says, gently pushing a chipped teacup into his hand. She fills it with an
He can’t help himself. He dispels his charm and makes a beeline for the house. He has only seen it in photos taken by Colin, who regularly checks in on Lowtown at Harry’s request.
“Ah, Messrs Potter,” Blishwick says. “I do hope you’ll accept my sincerest apologies for my servant’s assault on your person,” He adds, bowing to Draco.
“The imperial eggs are limited edition and the Dark Lord owns most of them, so I don’t have any more of those to give you. But I thought this would be a lot better,” Harry says.
It only took a few minutes until Harry was close, then, trying desperately to ward off his orgasm, a couple more minutes before he was sobbing in desperation.
weird. Ever since Nate had found out about Draco’s long-standing crush on the Saviour (beginning around fourth year and covered up with immature arguments and drama sprouting from the war) as well as all Draco’s guilt-ridden and embarrassing associations, he’d committed to almost constantly torturing Draco with it during play.
After sharing a school with the man for seven years, a war, and a rivalry, he was surprised there was much more to learn at all.
Harry… Harry had no idea what to say. What to think. He wasn’t thinking. He was just staring and trying really hard not to be scared. “
thinking about the discomfort of his position, legs wider than natural, cock straining and desperate, back cold, neck stiff. He doesn’t notice these things.
Draco had to dig his nails into his own palms to keep from grabbing his cock through his pants or rubbing up against Nates palm. Next, Harry slipped his thumbs under them hem of his knickers (Draco seriously couldn’t get over Harry Potter in knickers) and slinkily pushed them down his thighs.
Their crotches were still pressed together and Draco let himself thrust up, once, the movement small enough that the Dom’s might not catch it (but what was the fun in that?). Harry’s eyes widened and he mouthed a scandalized ‘

“Spread your legs.” The instruction is pressed into his skin, muffled and quiet and Harry almost misses it. Misses their meaning anyway. “If you want.”
he didn’t know much about what was happening, but he couldn’t deny the 16 points of pressure along his body pulling him
Harry tried to gauge how serious Draco was. Articulation wasn’t Harry’s strong point, but the embarrassment that came along with dirty-talk always made he blood race and tingle. And he could understand Draco’s curiosity, he shared it, after all. He struggled to get his thoughts in order, and not be quite so distracted by the pleasure zipping up and down his prick.
As they eat, they speak lightly, there’s a lot to dive into and work through still, but not yet. They’re not in scene so everyone’s relaxed and acting as themselves. And Harry thinks about how the Doms must have known, like Josh knew, what was going to happen, last night and this morning. How they saw an opportunity and set the whole thing up. How they made it so Draco and Harry would wake up together, naked, in the same bed and more or less on the same page.
Then came the tongue behind his ear and the rough promise: “I’ll spank you later if you do.”As if to prove he would, Draco bit down harshly on the tendon stretching between Harry’s neck and shoulder as he scratched at his rim.
Draco had been muttering in his ear, but Harry wasn’t focused enough to listen until the other man traced the knickers and his arse crack, then begun nudging his way between Harry’s cheeks. But the skin was dry and tense, and Draco could do little more than prod and rub as Harry desperately tried to ignore the way pleasure and anticipation was zipping up his spine and down his legs.
reminding him. And any reservations or doubts he’d had about Potter had disappeared months ago with Nate’s steady understanding and acceptance.
This time he blushes a little less. Focuses a little more. Manages to keep his head a little longer.
Draco had forgotten about the collar around his neck when Harry had led him to this room. Now it felt tight enough to constrict his breathing. Whatever they asked of him, he would deliver, but he wasn’t so sure he’d be able to preform to their standard. He was back to playing the game, punishment was a possibility if he stepped too far out of line or forgot his place. And usually that was a good thing, but now, punishment might be leaving. Punishment might be being forced to watch Harry and not touch him. Punishment might be a blindfold, and missing out on all the shinning potential this night held.
He lays back, waiting for the glow to fade. When he opens his eyes, Draco is right there, leaning in for a kiss. Harry gives it to him. But when Draco slides his tongue into Harry’s mouth, he realizes Draco didn’t swallow. The kiss is wet and dirty and heavy with the taste of sperm, but Harry takes it. He cups the back of Draco’s neck and silently asks for more.
And there, in all its ruddy, stubby glory, was Harry Potter’s cock. It was dark with blood and slightly shorter than average and thick enough to fill Draco’s mouth. It was nestled in coarse hair and Draco could see his balls hanging tight between his legs.
Harry. I love how pretty you are.” Harry felt the tickle of a finger gliding up the back of his leg, brushing behind his knee and tracing the lace. Then pressing against one of the inlaid, dark green jewels, smaller than his finger tip. Harry could read the appreciation and pleasure in Draco’s voice and face, clear as day. His hand travelled upwards again, fingers swirling along the crease of his arse, and the cheek behind that. “Love how you dressed up for me. Are you still sore?”
So now Nate knew everything. Which made it especially weird when he started keeping something from Draco, usually he practiced what he preached.
And then he’s close. So ridiculously close that Harry’s brain is already anticipating lube and fingers and penetration because that’s what being this close leads to but it’s not. It’s new a different and uncomfortable in the best way.
“Do you need opened up again?” He could feel Draco straddling his thighs through the thin netting covering them, and he could hear the slick sounds of him lubing up.
But there are differences too. The way he’s angled towards Harry, and not just the wall. The way his hooded eyes aren’t closed, but glued on his. His lips swollen and red thanks to the attention he’d paid on Harry’s still-wet-and-tingling neck. Tongue pressing into the point of his canine, slipping between his teeth, eager in arousal. His coat is open, long and framing his already lean body, narrow hips. Hair like it’s glowing in the dark, falling into his eyes.
This time, the afternoon speeds by in a second, and Harry finds himself back in front of that alley without really having time to prepare
Still, Draco had been in a power relationship with this man for two and a half years and knew when he wasn’t saying everything. He was a Slytherin after all, he knew how to read people. When Draco had pressed for more information, he never got any. The other day he’d pressed a little too hard, and gotten a flogging instead of answers.
Harry did what he was told, pushed away his pillow, and reached up to hold onto the bars slatted in the headboard (there for obvious reasons). Draco gave his throat another good suck (Harry was sure there was a bruise there by now) and then began fucking him like it was the last time he’d get to in his life.
“C’mon Harry” Draco whined quietly into his ear. “Slick me up, I know you can… I know you want to.” Harry could picture it, the way Draco would slide in, wet and and pushy, in front of everyone. How he’d take what he wanted and damn the consequences. How he’d use Harry and make sure he loved it.
The kiss Draco plants on him is one of their better ones, less a manifestation of whatever power dynamic they’re exploring, less an extension of whatever kink they’re enacting, and more an expression of the excitement that’s suddenly jumping between them like electricity. It’s deep and rushed and a bit giddy and…
Harry sought out Draco. Draco, who was now slightly across the room, tied up, stripped, and leaning over a padded bench getting what looked like the club’s whipping of the week. Harry’s mouth salivated at the snap and imprint of leather across Draco’s exposed arse, Nate’s imposing stance and Draco’s hot squirming making him sweat.
Harry isn’t too torn up by the whole thing, so he lets Draco do as he pleases. “Is that why you became a sub? Because you’re selfish?” he asks, thrusting into Draco’s hand a little.
Or, he tried to. Until Draco’s whining got ridiculous and the pureblood stopped taking no for an answer. But still, they didn’t talk about it. And they walked down the same little cobble street like nothing had ever happened.
He’s entirely focused on Draco asking, “Ready?” and Harry really should ask for clarification. He doesn’t need to though. “Slow, remember? Just like last time. But this time…” He smirks, “Front row seat.” His hand goes to his cock.
The whisper was quiet and harsh in his ears, but the thought of being tied up, chest throbbing under the nipple clamps made him shiver. Nates large hand settled over Draco’s aching prick, not offering any pressure or friction, but owning him just by being there.
) were the cheeky kind, over half of his arse cheeks were bare and available for Draco’s perusal. His thighs flexed visibly beneath the stockings and his feet were pointed and crossed daintily as he spun. The way his shoulders rose and his chin was ducked made him look sheepish and shy, a complete reversal of what Draco remembered about his childhood rival.
The familiar sights and smells of the kitchen is a comforting heat, some familiarity amidst all the tense changes they’ve been undergoing. Scorpius can see something heavy leave Dad’s shoulders, and feels similarly. The staff for the day greet them cheerfully, and Scorpius gets his hair ruffled more than a few times.
Draco’s nostrils flare. “I’m pregnant, you utter harpy! When I used that curse, I thought only to protect my baby. What would you have had me do, give my best curtsey and say why yes, thank you, madam, please proceed to murder me and my unborn child?”
Draco breaks into guilty laughter. “She would, at that. Mother says she sent her a letter that just said,
Harry cups the back of his thighs and pulls him forwards with the casual kind of strength that always has Draco purring up a storm. He’d be embarrassed by the wet slide of his bottom against the plush chair if not for the way Harry takes his cock into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks as he takes him in, to the root. It takes a little maneuvering, and then he’s soothing the ache of emptiness curling in Draco’s gut by sliding two fingers into his hole, meeting very little resistance. A warbling cry falls unbidden from Draco’s lips. He presses his hands onto Harry’s shoulders, at once trying to pull him close and push him away, hips restlessly bucking into his hold. Harry’s tongue curls at where precome is oozing out of Draco’s slit, and then he’s gone, whimpering and shaking. The pads of Harry’s fingers--and they always feel so much better than Draco’s own, thicker and stronger and imbued with tingling magic--score across Draco’s prostate, pulling another pulse of climax from him, so powerful it almost hurts.
He kisses Draco's slick inner thighs, and then licks away what's left of Draco's release, very deliberately ignoring where Draco's prick is bobbing an angry red before him. Then he pauses, dips his nose into the light blond curls at the base of his shaft, and breathes in. Draco covers his face with his hands, skin tingling with warmth. Some deep, instinctual thing in the back of his mind is filling him with smugness. His Alpha likes his scent. He's seeking out the places where it's strongest and taking him in, humming contentedly into Draco's skin. He's so busy battling with his thoughts that he doesn't have time to process Harry sucking him into his mouth, all wet, rippling heat.
-The Death eaters reference sacrificing muggleborn foot soldiers for an invasion, the death of children (both past and present), and chemical warfare
“I make calls and entertain guests and attend parties. You’d call me a househusband, I suppose, and I’ll be a mother soon. That’s good enough for me.” He eventually says.
They’ve nicked each other during more rowdy duels, sure, but they’re always ready with a healing spell and quick to apologize. Healing of any kind is not allowed while contestants are in the ring. Each round is a war of attrition in its own right.
One contestant is introduced as one of the many children from the sprawling Rosier family, a severe-faced Beta girl named Nia. Draco whispers that he remembers her for her short fuse from childhood gatherings. The other is an Alpha Half-Blood from Lowtown going only by the moniker of Watcher. He’s sponsored by one of the side branch Fawley men, who stands up not far from them and waves pompously. The third is another Alpha, a man Harry vaguely recognizes from countless raids--something Yaxley. The last is a Muggleborn, a young Beta by the name of Elias Smith. He’s just blond and plain enough that he could easily pass as one of the Purebloods by the same name, but the gig has likely been up for a while. His sponsor has chosen to remain anonymous, and for good reason, too. A Muggleborn hasn’t secured a sponsor in nigh on eight years.
“You don’t mean that,” Harry calls in reply, as Draco leaves the study. He scoffs and waves a hand over his shoulder.
“I’m fine,” Draco says, clearly lying through his teeth. “I just can’t shake the thought that that could have been you.” He's red faced and frowning.
“I want you to fuck my mouth, Draco,” he hums, leaning down to kiss along Draco’s pelvis. Then he dips down and pulls one of Draco’s balls into his hot mouth, humming lowly. The sensation has his thighs trembling.
“And I’m not sitting around letting my friend stay in jail,” Weasley continues, a strange thickness in his voice. “I’m not--I’m not bumping elbows with people who want to kill me. I’m not playing pretend in my big fancy houses and traveling the world on murder missions.”
He playfully wiggles his arse, pushing it back until it nudges against Harry’s throbbing erection. Harry hisses as the drooling head drags over warm skin. They kiss and talk aimlessly about their plans for the coming days. Draco reaches behind him and takes Harry’s erection in hand, stroking him slowly, twisting over the head on each pull.
“Please, can I come? Please, Daddy?” The words burst from his mouth as Harry begins to jerk him, not even bothering to match the pace of his snapping hips.
Harry’s found his way to Draco’s chest, plush lips pursing around his right nipple. The flimsy bralette is at once an irritating barrier and a lovely source of wet friction. Harry’s free hand cups him briefly, thumb playing over where precome is beading from the slit of Draco’s cock.
“You know, you should be careful. That’s awfully pretty,” Harry says, hesitantly. Hermione gasps but doesn’t turn around. “You can’t be sure someone won’t steal it.”
“It would be helpful if we had access to school records. The Pureblood children within should be protected,” Thicknesse says. “If they are young enough, it is possible they can be rehomed to families who will have them if their birth parents have been corrupted.”
“Carrow, I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve never made an Omega come in your life,” Greyback says, serenely.
Every other person in Harry’s life has been some odd mixture of horrified and confused by the development, and Draco’s parents haven’t spoken to him since they got the news. It’s for this reason that Harry can’t be entirely angry with the old Alpha for his excitement, even if it’s most certainly something he’s going to write into the ham-fisted tell-all memoir he’s been crowing about writing for ages. He’d certainly been happy to ignore Draco after his father’s arrest, and Draco’s brush with Azkaban after the war was well publicized. But on the very first day of their repeat term, Slughorn waved them in, seated them together, and then gleefully asked if the rumors were true. It’s difficult to lie when your scents have begun mingling, so they’d politely endured his gushing until the class began, and now share amused looks every time he smiles over at them. It’s a little thing, but Slughorn’s constant acknowledgment of them--of their validity--is comforting in its own strange way.
They keep toys in the bedroom bench, but crawling to the foot of the bed to get some feels like too much work. He shucks his underwear, rolls onto his stomach, and reaches up for a pillow. He folds it and slides it between his thighs, and the friction of getting it into place is just enough to have him whining and shooting weakly onto it. For just a moment, the restless need he's feeling quiets, and then it surges right back up with a vengeance. He ruts happily against the pillow until the fog in his head clears two more orgasms later. He's still too afraid to try his magic, so with a shudder of embarrassment he throws it on the floor.
This seems to surprise Rodolphus. His almond shaped eyes widen the smallest bit. “Why would you need to discuss it with him?”
“Harry,” Draco sighs, and it’s such a rare and lovely thing when he drops the pet names in favor of Harry’s name. His chest tightens, and when Draco slides a hand into his hair, more to feel than to guide, it sends another wave of warmth rolling through him. The potion hasn’t done anything other than make him especially aware of how he always feels, he thinks.
Its centerpiece is a golden medallion. The relief of a stag with its head turned takes up its entirety, the single outward-facing eye a small, glittering ruby.
“Yes, and I’m trying to find him, actually, so if you’ll excuse me,” Draco murmurs, dipping into a barely polite curtsey and stomping off, not even waiting to hear her reply.
“Oh,” Draco says, and then he leans close enough to the wall to pillow his face in the inside of his elbow, both to wipe away the bothersome tears and to hide how shyly pleased he is by the admission.
After a beat, Draco says, “I’m unsure of what I should say. You haven’t asked me a proper question. All you’ve done is state well-established facts.”
After a little while, Draco lets out a pained puff of air. “Maybe now is the time to stop wearing heels... No,
“Well I don’t like it. But I figure if, if. If he doesn’t have a lot of time left and it might be good for Father, it could be worth it. And I mean, he doesn’t like us tainted half-bloods, anyway, maybe he won't talk to us,” He says, in a weak attempt at humor.
Finally, a word: While I’m serious about that character death warning for other characters (including ones that didn’t die in canon), please rest assured that I'm not killing Harry or Draco off. This fic is very self-indulgent and our main couple is one of the biggest examples of that. Remember when I said this read like a harlequin romance? Haha. The kind of relationship they have here is one that I desperately wanted to read more of (including kink and dynamic wise LOL), and I just wasn’t seeing a lot of it, so I wrote it myself. I've been tiring of reading fics about pining and interpersonal turmoil and developing relationships. This is not to say I don't love them, I wouldn't be much of a Drarry fan if I didn't, but that I wanted a change of pace. While these two will be going through a lot, both together and alone, death isn't one of those things. My outline is complete so this is something I don't mind spoiling even if it may cheapen some story beats. I would want to be warned about something like that as a reader.
“Not that I know of. The boy he’s sponsoring is, as you know. I was supposed to be supporting him as he made his way up.” Anezka answers. “Why, do you think he might be?”
“Of course, love,” Harry says, not looking away from Thicknesse’s benign stare. “Well… be seeing you.”
He slots his knees onto the back of Draco’s, widening his stance until Draco’s legs are bracketing his. After a shift, he squeezes Draco’s cheeks, pulling them aside for easy access. Soon enough, the head of his cock pops into Draco’s rim. He’s stretched wide enough that the burn is minimal, and as Harry presses in, splitting him open, he slides into place like he belongs there and snaps his hips forward at a slow, heavy pace.
And then he watches, frozen, as Draco shifts his weight (that’s all it takes, it should probably be harder then that, for the impact it leaves) and groans at the scratch of denim on his foreskin (must be like fire) and leaves those few rare drops of piss to sink into the cloth tight over Harry’s crotch. He feels the press and rub right through to his cock.
And then, Harry was reading in the sitting room one Sunday morning, tea at his elbow and Molly’s knitted quilt tucked in beside each knee, only paying half attention and awaiting Draco’s weekly storm-through-the-floo-and-demand-Harry’s-company-to-France-before-forcing-him-into-‘
Draco catches his eye and must see the subspace Harry’s fallen into once again because he says “Come on. Let’s get out of here.” And then there are arms and a pop and another. There’s the bed and warming charms and all their clothes on the floor. There’s rutting and clutching and panting and absolutely nothing else.
He was just inching up to his own orgasm when the he felt Draco go stiff, he ground into Harry hard for a couple seconds with a groan and went still. Harry held his breath and he heard Draco give a breathy laugh above him, along with another push of his hips.
“Put those in his mouth, I have a job for you.” Draco was surprised at Josh giving him a direct order (that’s Nate’s job) and the order itself. Draco was a sub, he wasn’t accustomed to stuffing things in people’s mouths, but looking back to Harry, spread and wanton below him, he thought exceptions could be made.
Until one summer day, once again dragging Harry along, Draco’d decided he’d wanted an extra lemonade with his meal, and a second tea with his pastry. On their way back to the subtle corner they (traditionally) apparated to and from, Draco suddenly veered off into a shadowed alley, tugging Harry along without even stopping his tirade about the pros and cons of French fashion.
Draco pulls away despite Harry’s hand and holds Harry’s jaw open at the hinge. That’s when Harry realizes Draco doesn’t intend to swallow at all. Harry lays below Draco, mouth wide, as the other man spits what remains in his mouth directly into Harry’s. Then he closes Harry’s mouth himself and patronizingly pats his cheek with a smug smirk.
look indecent. And Harry, watching from behind, could almost feel it: Draco’s hand loose around his prick, directing the line away and towards the wall, his other hand tucked into his waist-coat pocket, pulling the fall of his coat aside. He could hear the shallow, quiet moan Draco gave at the slide of liquid up his urethra, the subtle itching-sting as it pushed its way through and stimulated all those sensitive nerves. Tense because of the need, about to be satisfied.
The situation wasn't exactly unfamiliar to Draco, they’d attended orgies and made house calls before. For today’s event, whatever it was, Nate had forgone Draco’s usual affinity for leather and dressed him in his tightest black pants and his usual collar. He’d also taken some time to line Draco’s eyes in dark pencil.
Draco look to Nate, who nodded expectantly. It took five whole minutes for Draco to process this and find an answer, but the Dom’s waited patiently. The question grounded him, gave him a task at the direction of his Dom, and gave him a choice.
Nate was leaving Draco off now, he set the lube aside on the bench, and from the same table as before, pulled out a bowl of condoms and a little placard. Harry’s heart sped up again, they were in for a show. He knew from previous visits to the club that those signs only said one thing:
This was the game tonight: they were to put on a show for their Doms (and whoever else happened to enjoy it), they were to dance and touch but no more. They’ve been at it for an hour now at least, and Harry was beginning to think that if he’d been here with some other ridiculously hot sub, one with a bit more self-control, or patience, this would be an easier task to. As it was, Draco was selfish and ruthless and deliciously addictive.
It felt different. More dangerous, strange and unpredictable. Perhaps for the first time since his foray into BDSM Harry had found himself fascinated and attracted to something he truly never expected of himself. All the discipline and orders and submission and sex, it had always been there, simmering somewhere under the surface. But piss? (Watersports, Josh told him.) He hadn’t expected this at all.
“Good, now rub me off.” Harry was past trying to resist. He got to work on opening Draco’s flies and wrapping a hand around Draco’s cock while the other man got to opening him up properly.
They were good like that, contrary and compatible: when Harry pulled, Draco pushed, where Harry was gentle, soft and slow, Draco was rough and hard and couldn’t take his time if it bloody killed him.
“What?” He’s panting. His body feels like it’s melting slowly. Overwhelmed by anticipation and sinking into submission instead. “Dra- Why?”
Draco’s smile turned dirty but he didn’t answer in any way other then fingering the hem of the sheet where it lay along Harry’s mid-back.
He’d been making the trip since he was a child, originally with his mother, and had done so so many times he no longer required a port-key to make it across the English Channel. He just Apparated, first to Hastings on the coast, and next directly into town.
Another moan sounded, Harry distantly recognized it as his own, this one louder and longer than the first, dipped in pleasure by the phantom friction he could feel down below. In a second the whole night came back to him: the good fucking and orgasm that had lulled him to sleep, the shear black stockings that were still clinging to his thighs, this dynamic they’d found that was still so new and unlikely… the owner of those burning sliver eyes.
And the lighting isn’t good but Harry can imagine the way his slit is splitting open, sensitive and that stinging-itch as it bears down and lets go.
Their Doms either planned it out to the last detail or had a shared appreciation for hot subs in black eyeliner because the coal around Harry’s eyes matched his own.
Draco switches hands, sucking on the head of his cock. He keeps jacking Harry off, fast and hard, while his other hand snakes around back to Harry’s arse. He roughly hooks two fingers into his hole and pulls at his rim, stretching the wet, sensitive skin and making Harry’s hips buck. He comes in an instant, right into Draco’s mouth with a groan, arching his back.
This gave Harry pause, he gasped a little, like the question was too much in and of itself. His eyes raked over Draco, taking in every inch of him, kneeling on the floor, Draco could feel I like fire. “I—” He shook his head.
Harry wanted… Well, that’s the problem isn’t it? Harry doesn’t know what he wants. Is so desperate, and the panic’s saying ‘GoHomeNow’ and everything else is pulling him in different directions that all seem to inevitably end up in the back of that alley.
Not waiting a second, Draco pushed a finger, then two past Harry’s rim. He spent a short moment circling his prostate in reward causing Harry’s knees to go weak and his arms to slip over Draco’s shoulders for extra support.
Josh chuckled. “Then as your punishment, I’ll do the spanking, and it won’t be so much fun with a cock ring on. Since we’re going to be working on restraint.” Heat shot through Harry as the burly Dom came with a loud groan in Draco across the room.
The only other odd behaviour Nate was showing was his near-constant questioning about Harry Potter. Though, if Draco was being honest, even that wasn’t
He thought about years of animosity and mirrored roles in a war. He thought about bad decisions and mistakes that weren’t actually choices that still haunted him some nights. He thought of burning green eyes and all those things Nate whispered in his ear when he’s getting fucked within an inch of his life.
Draco’s terribly specific order makes both of them smile. He’s desperate to try the spaghetti bolognese, which is fine, but he wants an eclair specifically to cover in shredded cheese, and he doesn’t care that Harry will have to walk to the children’s table to get him a cup of gillywater.
Of all the things Harry was expecting to hear, this was certainly not one of them. “Draco, I could never hate you.”
He hooked a hand under Draco’s knee and pulled his leg up and off Harry, holding it up in the air, bent so his ass was more open than before. He deepened his thrust and took advantage of the position, hitting Draco’s prostate every motion forward and sending ripples of pleasure through him. His nails dug into Draco’s thigh, and he bit down hard on Draco’s throat, scraping his teeth against the skin.
Looking at Nate always gave him a sense of being under his control, but the normal zing of arousal was overtaken by the shock and pleasure of suddenly having Harry Potter’s tongue in his arse, knickers no where to be seen. Draco clenched his eyes closed and felt his own legs kick out and his arms fight against Nates hands on his wrists, a move that got his forearm pinched red and white.
“I’m fine. Draco asks after you quite often, you know,” Harry says. As he was hoping, some of the tension in Theo’s bird-boned shoulders eases, fondness lessening whatever fears he must be feeling. “You might give him a floo call to check in. One of the first things he asked for when we settled in London was to ask for you all to be keyed into the wards.”
“I know, I just… I can’t help feeling like he’s disappointed he ended up with us. You know that thing Nan used to say all the time, ‘Children are a gift?’ I feel like we were regifted.”
(Green is her color, Nan said, mostly because it made her hair pop and her eyes gleam, so Lily takes to wearing it after her passing. She doesn’t miss the dresses or the bulky robes, but she’ll keep the color.)
“Like that,” Draco gasps, “I’m coming, please, Daddy, I’m coming—” The last word lengthens into a moan, and his come smears over his fingers and across his chest as he cries out Harry’s name. There’s another resounding thud as Draco’s writing desk slams back down to the floor, followed by every other article of mess.
Draco lets out a shocked little laugh and then latches on the obvious attempt to lighten the mood with gusto. “I showed you that in
“So we wanted to ask you if you wanted the same thing. If you would be interested in playing with him.”
Nothing about the room or the man in it stood out to Draco as odd when they stepped through the fireplace, Draco behind Nate. And neither did anything give away what they’d obviously been planning.
And on display they were. Every time Harry peeked over Draco’s shoulder he spotted three more people staring at them. It was beginning to feel like the majority of the club was watching. While Harry felt timid, Draco was clearly loving all the extra attention. The longer they danced, the more his hands roved Harry’s body, the tighter he gripped and the harder he got. His hands would slip under Harry’s shirt to scratch at his stomach or lower back, then pinch at his nipples, causing Harry to whine into the skin of his throat. He’s pull at Harry’s hair to get him to mouth at his throat and sink his palms down to grope at his thighs, his arse… his balls.
Harry realized Draco was asking for his explicit consent, and his heart tripped at the how respected and treasured it made him feel. He smiled wide, then put on his best sub-voice, allowing some desperation to spill in and sighing theatrically. “
Draco took stock. He was more than overwhelmed, but that was normal. He was still a little worried, but only about Harry and how he might react to Draco. Nate says they’ll get to that.
He reached out with his foot slowly, just enough to slide his toes over Harry’s ankle. They got a good five seconds of skin on skin contact, lighting zipping between them, and jostled by the vigorous thrusts while Draco bit his own lip. Then Nate inevitably realized what he was doing.
The alley was narrow, borderline claustrophobic, crowded in parts than deserted in others. It wasn’t particularly long, but it only opened into the bright, sunlit street on one end, closed off with bricks on the other.
She helps him out of Harry’s coat, folding it neatly over her arm. The moment he’s out, she sighs in appreciation over the fine silk robes beneath. She helps him pull the strap of his handbag back over his shoulders, chuckling softly about how tall he is, and how he’s already got the pregnancy glow, and how lovely his hair looks now that it’s growing, does he plan on keeping it long? She spends a few moments fussing appreciatively over his beauty. The familiar ritual makes his eyes sting. When he was younger, he’d sneak into her rooms while she readied herself for the day, talking at length about how he couldn’t wait to look just like her. Sometimes she would hold out her perfume and spray it in the air for him to walk through, all the while cooing over his nice robes and sweet face as the cool little droplets hit his face. He’d feel so lovely by the end of it that he would spend the rest of the day convinced he was about ten feet tall.
He deflates. Harry shouldn’t encourage it, but he snorts out a little laugh and tells him to get to work. Draco’s scent is broadcasting contented omega like a drug anyways, and they grade in comfortable silence for hours. Draco’s lovely hair looks burnished gold by the candlelight as he bends over his sack of parchment.
It’s a simple and terrifying thing, detailing the instructions for a short, magic-sharing ritual and the recipe for a potion that will induce a temporary rut. Harry’s brows climb his forehead when Draco shows it to him, but he gives his consent with a smile, leering badly enough that Draco reddens and shoves him lightly. Draco spends a week making it. He has always been a deft hand at potions, but he hasn’t had the chance to practice in some time. The proximity to all that steam makes his hair curl up, much to his dismay, but Harry’s so pleasantly surprised by it that Draco tentatively abandons the straightening charms he has been using for almost a decade. He supposes loose curls are a favorable enough inheritance from the Black line. It’s this or the madness, and Aunt Bella has enough of that to go around.
His sweaty palms have him slipping, losing purchase, but the change in angle is tender and perfect, and he’s chanting, “
their thick picnic blanket in anticipation of a sleepy spell, and sure enough, Draco curls into his side and quickly falls asleep, soft and warm in Harry’s arms. A good meal always sends him right off, and Harry’s keen to help him get good sleep where possible.
When called, most of the house elves on call arrive relatively unharmed, and mournfully report the deaths of much of the human staff. Many of them were Muggleborns without family and Half-Bloods with family scattered to the winds; almost all of them were brought to London from Newcastle, cheerfully excited to explore the city in their limited free hours. The guilt is powerful. Harry makes a mental note to make sure each of them is accounted for. He’s relieved to learn that Neville is injured but okay. Then, with the help of the elves, he and Colin wade into what remains of their London home.
“So I hexed him.” Draco continues. Harry laughs darkly, sighing down at their joined hands. “I hexed him and I didn’t answer his question. On Imbolc, he apologized for being too forward, and I thought that was the end of it. Then Father called me to the Manor and said Mr. Thicknesse made the same offer to him and he wanted me to think about it, though I don’t think he knows about, erm...”
She wakes up with a warbling, whining cry growing in her throat, and there’s a beat of silence before all of the low string lights she keeps in her bedroom flicker off and then burst, fragments tinkling down all around her. She flinches as it falls, and is considering attempting a banishing charm--she hasn’t quite mastered it yet and had banished James hair clean off his head the last time he tried to help her--before her door creaks open, and Daddy is staring at her with wide eyes.
Kreacher gives them both a little bow and then scuffles off. They’re all used to his visits, his sporadic cleaning and muttering, the visits he makes with the portrait no one in the family had the heart to get rid of, even after they’d destroyed what Daddy insists was a truly macabre collection of dark artefacts and suchlike.
“But--how? We had the scan in the hospital, and then the last ultrasound, and nobody noticed.” Harry splutters. “We've only heard one heartbeat!”
First, I’d like to thank you guys for your support on my last note. I'm doing my best to keep going. Second, as I mentioned I was thinking of doing in the interlude, I’ve changed the summary. Hope it wasn’t confusing!
It’s ringing in the back of Scorpius’ mind the next time he talks to Grandfather, over a peaceful enough time spent listening to Lily playing on the harp for them, her tongue sticking out the way it does when she hasn’t mastered a new song yet.
Then he tries, fingers scoring gently through her scalp. She lets her eyes fall closed. After a moment, Father leans over to inspect it. He declares it absolutely dreadful, which makes her giggle, and breaks the odd hesitant tension lingering over the three of them as they laugh too.
“For the past few weeks, Father and I have been discussing some of the intelligence shared by one of Mr. Dolohov’s contacts. As you know, we learned that the Koldovstoretz school of magic rests in the center of an enchanted forest, which redirects the ill-intentioned until they are either lost or killed. I am suggesting that we use the poison Father and Headmaster Snape are working on to kill the forest before we even think of invading, in order to avoid unnecessary losses.”
The reminder is sobering. Pureblood or not, family of Death Eaters or not, he is still an Omega. With Harry’s stalling, there is no way the other people from that day have not been thoroughly questioned, and no way of knowing if they were truthful about what they saw. The risk of being caught in a lie is too great. Voldemort, erratic on a good day, has been closely monitoring the various investigations surrounding the bombings. Will his hate for rebels override his firm stance on an Omega’s role, even with Harry’s heir on the line? Harry wouldn’t dare try to predict him.
Cold, dry fingers cup his chin, tilting his head up. Another hand sweeps over his neck, grazing over his healing bond mark. “My, but you
“Still! And the little Mudblood? Why, she should be—she should be brushing your hair, not eating your food!”
She pats him on the knee, still giving Harry an arch look with those deep almond shaped eyes of hers. She couldn't care less about his fame. Harry confessed to liking her immediately, for that.
“I’ve got you,” Harry grits out, his slow rocking faltering even further at the feeling of Draco clenching down on him in a wave. He feels an answering rush of slick meet him and lets out a disbelieving laugh. “You’re going to be the death of me.”
He nods over Draco’s shoulder. Draco glances back to see his parents standing nearby, faces pulled into familiar neutral masks. Draco is sure that he’s shattered them by walking forward and wrapping his arms around Father in a hug. Father gently, if briefly, hugging him back is worth it.
He dips into a bow and grins at the wave of raucous applause that meets him. Draco looks around at the other people in their section with poorly disguised disapproval as they slam their hands. Harry rubs a thumb along the vein on the back of his hand. A lot of unwritten rules of decorum are abandoned in these duels, by unspoken agreement.
“Would you like to be the baby’s godfather?” Draco asks, after the silence has stretched into the awkward.
3: With my semester coming to an end, I'm hoping to have more time to write, but I simply cannot promise a regular schedule of updates with my erratic life. I'm seriously considering withdrawing from my Master's program for my long-term mental health. If I do, that will require a lot of restructuring, planning, and money saving (I.E. more work hours). Hope this double update will make up for what might be another long break.
. “Nothing substantial. Father has been nattering on about it. He’s so proud. I don’t think he’s ever been so proud of me.”
Draco steps close, clearly in need of comfort. He squeaks in surprise when Harry lifts him up into his arms, heading for their quarters, then wraps his arms around Harry’s neck. “It just doesn’t seem fair.”
, baby,” Harry breathes out, his thumbs pressing along Draco’s rim on either side. “Is that for me?”
It’s all downhill from there. When the term starts, Harry learns many things about Draco that are endearing and contradictory. He’s got an incorrigible sweet tooth, which his friends and family indulge. He likes children and is kind to the nervous first year Slytherins, who quickly learn to go running for him if they are lost or need support. Harry regularly hears other professors marveling over his hard work, a few of them tutting about how such a brilliant mind will go to waste if he ends up being pushed into the traditional marriage he’s no doubt been raised for.
He didn’t mean anything by it--he’s just a merchant making a sale, but Draco still fails to tamp down on the sadness his words invoke. It worsens when Father nods imperiously and sets it aside for purchase. Draco has no doubt he’ll have it appraised and then send it off to the Newcastle estate. Swallowing, Draco does what he does best, and maintains the aimless chatter until Father is content with his haul and bids Borgin goodbye.
“So I’d appreciate it if you’d take a couple of steps back. It’s a wonder we haven’t woken him up already. I don’t want your scent to disturb him.”
“No, it’s not that. I just remembered all my clothes and accessories were at St. Savior’s,” Draco mumbles. “It’s such a silly thing to be upset about, but I lost so much of it, and we’re here…”
Draco slides slender arms around his waist and squeezes tightly. “I know. Just promise me you won’t let him find out. Please.”
“Shower first, then we’ll soak all you want, okay? Should I get some of your lavender?” Harry asks, correctly guessing what Draco really wants. He could swear his heart swells about three sizes larger.
“It’s just that… I know you don’t like exercising your rights. But if I had to give you my honest advice, and this is from what I’ve seen
Draco nods in affirmation. Harry slots his teeth over Draco's faded bond mark as he lifts Draco's top leg over his strong thigh. Then he's pressing one of Draco's cheeks to the side and sliding back into him, starting up the hard fucking that Draco has been craving, filling him up so well. Each heavy, insistent thrust chips away at every worry, every bit of loneliness that was building, every empty ache. Harry's teeth sink into his flesh, renewing his bite in a burst of pleasure pain. By the time his ears stop ringing, he can hear Harry's grunts of exertion in his ear, and it's that that pushes him over the edge again--knowing the effect he's having on his Alpha.
“Listen, we’ll be stationed at the estate of one of the Dark Lord’s supporters. I’ll ask for access to the floo and we’ll talk through the private one here in our room, how does that sound?”
James doesn’t remember much from when Dad was an Auror. He’d made history with how early he quit. He had a truly promising record, one that Uncle Ron says is still held over the heads of new Auror recruits.
“I know some of you are eager to return home,” Voldemort says, eyes lingering on Harry. A smile curls on the corners of his thin lips. “You may go.”
Draco gives him one of those looks. Scorpius calls it the "yeah, right" look. Al hides his nervousness by leaning in for a kiss, sighing in pleasure and relief when Draco cups his cheek and returns it, tongue flicking out to meet his. It's a short kiss, because Draco soon pulls back, smiling wryly as Al lets out a whine of loss.
He’s a short Alpha man with this impish kind of humor on his face, like he knows a secret that other people don’t. Harry had disliked him immediately, as he feels like a walking embodiment of the Auror Department’s corruption, all swaggering confidence, and comments just this side of invasive. His partner, a calm-tempered Beta woman by the name of Beauregard, is a bit more tolerable, though Harry still doesn’t trust her.
He wants to tell the truth, and desperately, but he knows he can't be the cause of more trouble for Harry. Not now, after everything he’s done. If he tells Harry what happened, he will march right out of the room and do something foolish, no matter how much their relationship has changed, because Harry hates a bully. Who is to tell what consequences he will have to endure? So now, faced with one of the most intense looks Harry has given him in weeks, Draco decides to trade one truth for another.
Ever since the night in the Dark Lord’s quarters, the two of them have made a game out of asking each other questions about the other before bed. They talk about their pasts, how they’re feeling, silly little joke questions about nitpicking opinions. It had been Draco’s idea, after a night full of tossing and turning, and he’d been nervous Harry would gently shut him out. To his pleasant surprise, Harry has committed to it with an openness he hadn’t even realized they’d been missing.
“I understand,” says Rodolphus, smiling indulgently. This is the most Harry has ever seen him emote in all the years he has known him.
Harry backs away from the door. He’s listened enough, and it’s clear that this isn't a conversation he would want Harry to hear. He crawls back into bed, heart in his throat. Even though he’s terrified, a smile is stretching across his face, completely unbidden. He throws the blanket back over his head and pretends to sleep until Draco patters into the room an hour later with a tray of (house elf made) food for him, gently asking if Pansy can stay the night.
Harry tucks himself back into his trousers, and then he’s pressing Draco back onto the mattress, his tongue sliding past Draco’s lips. Draco nips at him, giggling when Harry pinches his side in playful reproach.
Draco shudders, vacillating between wanting to chase the pleasure-pain of Harry’s hand on his length or shy away from it. Either way, it doesn’t matter, because Harry does not let him escape, hitting his prostate with a single-minded focus.
“It’s just a heads-up. What I’m saying is that you’re underweight for your height. It’s really important that you gain a steady amount of weight as the pregnancy progresses. Have you been struggling with morning sickness?” She asks.
Harry removes the scarf he’s been wearing and lifts it over Draco’s head, pleased at the thought of his scent broadcasting their bond. Draco flushes and stands still as Harry arranges the fabric around his slender neck.
A few more shaky thrusts and one kiss later, Harry is grunting and pushing his knot past Draco’s rim, and his cock jerks and a low groan sounds in his throat as he comes.
“Of course I did,” he begins, and then wants to kick himself when Draco preens, and sways closer to him, “but I’m too old for you. You have a lot ahead of you. I can’t steal your youth from you.”
Nan always called them by their first and middle names, sing-songy and loving, as close to a nickname they’d ever get from her. Al and the rest have speculated wildly on whether or not Lucius ever paid any real attention to all the photos and stories she took home. Being confronted with evidence that at least some of it got through makes Al fold the clipping and shove it into his pocket.
Harry immediately shushes him and then asks if he’s alright. He nods and wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, digging his nose into loose black curls. Harry instructs him to hold on tight and lifts him from the chair with his hands underneath Draco’s thighs, grunting softly when Draco locks his legs around his waist.
A short silence stretches between them. Harry’s giving him an attentive look when he glances up, so he breathes in and continues.
He asks because he can feel the greed seeping in, loosening his grip on his focus. The part of him that wants to cover Draco with his body and rut mindlessly is gnashing its teeth for freedom.
They’d migrated to the dining room table to play a leisurely game of exploding snap as Kreacher prepares a light lunch for them.
Draco hums, squeezing his knot, and this is enough to send him over the edge. Harry’s bitter release fills Draco’s mouth in spurts. He swallows what he can and then pulls off, heart fluttering as the last of Harry’s release lands on his cheek. Harry collects it with his thumb and Draco sucks it in, swirling his tongue around it until it’s clean.
Harry lets out a relieved chuckle. “I think that’s what happens when you frolic around outside at night in December. Do you want to just skip the celebrations today? I’m sure I could make our excuses.”
The Healer strongly recommends that Draco avoid heavy magic use for another few days. He also hands Harry a list of recipes for prenatal potions, which Draco eagerly snatches up, excitement clear on his face as he paces back and forth, mouthing the ingredients to himself.
They settle in for their multi-course brunch, a veritable swarm of house elves popping in and out to serve them.
Draco pulls off of him with a pop, and with one last loving kiss on his tip he rises from the floor. He fails to hide his pained wince as he goes, and Al nonsensically reaches out to rub them with his hands, even though the redness of that pale skin--the evidence of what he'd just done--is delightful in a way he can't quite pinpoint.
Father, for all that he is a consummate professional and a shrewd businessman, can be quite dramatic when it comes to Draco. He’s the first Omega the Malfoy bloodline has seen in generations, and Father won’t let anyone forget it. While Father is a very severe person, Draco knows that he is an object of love and pride.
“I wish you’d just tell me what happened between you two. It can’t be so serious as all that,” Harry says.
gone through with what you thought their plan was, nothing would have changed.” Harry says, pressing his palms flat on the table.
The question catches him off guard. He nods his head. Anezka breathes in deeply and continues talking. “We were friends. She saved me from some bullies in my first year and I started following her around. I was so annoying! She tried her best to get rid of me but she couldn’t. We would meet in secret, she’d help me with my homework, we’d talk.”
He walks over towards the small table to place the tray down. He hears Fred’s sharp inhalation of breath at the sight of him, and it makes the nails of his fingers dig into his palm, hidden by his curled fists.
“Listen, Sirius. I just found out that I lost someone, a little while ago,” Harry begins. “Someone that I really cared about. I didn’t try hard enough to save him and now he’s being put to death. But you--I have it on good authority that you might have a chance. Would you allow me to try and help you? I was an orphan and you’re the closest thing I have to family.”
Draco laughs into their kiss, locking his arms around Harry’s neck. His belly has grown just large enough that Harry can feel it between them, something that shouldn’t make him laugh, but there’s no other way to express the tight knot of joy bubbling up inside.
“I didn’t know,” Draco admits. “It usually doesn’t come on like this. I swear. I’m sorry, I would have told you—”
“Yes, but it is important to form alliances. Friendships should work to mutual benefit.” Is grandfather’s exasperated answer, his neatly manicured fingers drumming a tattoo on his desk.
“Say your rebels had taken you all hostage, and for some reason the Dark Lord wasn’t able to send some of us to get you all back. That’s highly unlikely, but let’s just say that happened. He would have ordered us to kill the rebels, and never mind if we had to run through you to do that. Then, he would have ordered the Ministers of other countries in the dominion to send over some Purebloods in search of marriages.” Harry scoffs, looking towards the window.
His food tastes abruptly like ash in his mouth. He pushes his plate aside and reaches for his drink. When he was young, Mother told him that it was impossible to swallow and cry at the same time. He isn’t sure how true that actually is, but the method has always worked in the rare moments when his emotions have gotten the better of him in the company of others.
He rolls onto his side, reaching out. Harry takes his place behind him, propping Draco's head up on his arm. He kisses the top of his head. Draco tilts his head back to meet him, and they kiss messily for a few lovely moments.
“It is good to see that you are in good health,” Father says, as they make their way back towards the Leaky Cauldron.
“I don’t know what I’m going to do, right now,” Harry admits, shrugging a shoulder. “Though I do ask that you stay put for the time being after we talk today. Surely I don’t need to tell you how bad it would look for you if you tried to disappear.”
They don’t exchange any more words. Once the tea is finished, they share another tight hug of farewell, and Harry leaves with his ears ringing.
Nan wrote letters for all of them, and she still hasn’t opened hers yet. It’s still tucked into her Steinway’s strings, not heavy enough to disrupt them very much, but sometimes she needs to press a key just a little harder than usual and it makes her think about Nan’s breathy laugh.
Anezka is beelining towards them, looking perfectly pretty and also miserable in her Imbolc dress. She gives Harry a small, hopeful smile as she approaches, and though he gets the feeling he’s going to regret it, he gives her a short nod.
“You don’t come unless I tell you to. You hold off as much as you can… you let me know when you’re close, and I just might tell you no,” Harry’s voice is thick with hunger. Draco tilts his chin up, and Harry easily captures his lips, tongue sweeping into his mouth with purpose until Draco’s burning chest forces him to pull back and take a breath. Harry whispers against his lips. “And then, when I finally tell you to let it go, it’ll be really intense.”
He takes the sample up, pretending that he doesn’t see the curious looks aimed his way. Eighth years share their classes with Seventh Years, and it’s hard to miss their starry eyes (Save Luna, who is his friend, and Smith, who makes a contrarian effort not to be impressed by anyone). It’s also hard not to miss the irritation that dances across some faces as Harry collects both his things and Draco’s, leaving enough space for Draco to link their arms together. As they head for the door, Draco holds his head high, aristocratic nose in the air. He’s such a little snob.
This elicits a chorus of jeers, enough to draw Voldemort’s attention. Harry pats him on the cheek and stands, just in time for Voldemort to address them. “Please save your enthusiasm for this little nuisance.”
Harry lets out a nervous laugh. “Sorry, I probably could have said it at a better time, but I just think it’s important that you know. I love you and I will fight for you and I will do one of those stupid blood magic spells to make it happen. I will summon some... crazy... Wild Magic… creature or something and make this work. Do you understand?”
“Draco,” he says, gently. “I’m not stupid. You’re lovely, but I shouldn't have entertained this for as long as I have.”
“No, I figured I’d run a bath and give you a few more moments to rest. Left you some Pepper-Up on your table.”
Draco can feel his ears heating up. He'd taken Rose into the kitchen to help him "oversee the stirring of the curry," which was largely just an excuse to hold her, especially because it's Harry who does most of their cooking. Draco could quite possibly burn water. Harry regulates him to simple kitchen tasks in an effort to keep Potter Cottage from burning down once again.
Draco gestures towards his ribs with a frown and lets out a miserable sound when Harry makes a tutting noise of sympathy. Together they get him propped up against a few pillows, and when he settles, Draco holds one of Harry’s hands between his with all of his strength.
“How could I possibly give you a rash with this baby-smooth face of mine? You keep pretending you want me to shave! It could be so much worse.” Harry grumbles.
“If they have, they wouldn’t have shared it! Many Purebloods claim relation to Salazar Slytherin, but few can prove it. There hadn’t been a parselmouth for generations before the Dark Lord rose. His connection to Slytherin was seen as proof of both his strength and purity of blood. Until just now, I thought he was the only living parselmouth on this island, like every other Pureblood. Do you understand where this is leading?”
“We can’t have expected you to have the taste needed for such a trip, can we?” Grandfather asks, and it’s mean, but it’s also the first time Lily thinks she’s heard them exchange words, so it makes her smile anyway.
It’s a familiar intimidation tactic. Harry has participated in many quiet interrogations in this very room, standing menacingly along the walls with other Death Eaters, all of them with their wands on careful display. Harry has never seen it in proper lighting. It’s filled with amorphous shapes and whispering corners. Governmental leaders have surrendered entire nations here.
The first time we met, he told me that if I disappointed him, it was Azkaban or worse. I couldn’t let him win by wiping us all out.” Harry says, sweeping his hand out in a fierce movement.
“It couldn’t hurt, in any case. We’ll be drawing blood next month when you hit sixteen weeks, but I think you should consider exercising both your magic and your body and see where it takes you. Don’t hesitate to floo or telephone if you’re worried in the meantime. And eat more! Now, I think you ought to check on Mr. Potter before he frets himself into a heart attack,” she adds, with a wry grin.
“You should be resting up anyways,” He says, gently moving Draco to the side as the Citadel’s house elves snap what remains of their belongings into the foyer. “But how about I take you to replace them, hm? We can make a day of it, stop by a tailor and a jeweler and wherever else.”
Harry snickers, and Draco lets out a few soft laughs of his own, so Harry knows he’s not upset in any way that matters. Harry thrusts his fingers inside, firm and insistent, fingers pressing over the swollen nub inside. Draco’s laugh peters off into a throaty cry. By now, he knows not to hide his face in pillows, lest Harry snatched them away, and it’s satisfying to hear those desperate sounds again. Weeks with only his hands and memory for company in some noble’s cold castle had nothing on this.
“Sometimes you may never get the answers to the questions you conjure up in your head. Allowing yourself to be held hostage by the past can be your undoing. Move forward with confidence.” Lucius speaks lowly enough that Al has to strain to hear him.
“Oh yeah? Well, what would your findings be? What do you have to add to the canon of fancy ponce research?”
“I want to make new memories with you,” Draco admits. He swallows against the tightness in his throat at the thought that they may be some of the last.
Draco obeys, finding himself seated between his fourth great-grandmother Taliesen on the right (the last Omega born to a Malfoy head of house before Draco), and the ever-snoozing portrait of his husband Hieronymous, who’d given up his birth name of Yaxley in his eagerness to marry into the Malfoy family.
The joke shocks a trembling laugh out of him. Sonja holds him tightly, then releases to tilt his chin up. She flicks his nose.
“You’re so spoiled, sweetheart. Gonna really make you beg one day,” Harry tells him. “Get you on your knees and make you suck my cock until you’re crying.”
Lily is this close to telling the truth about what happened that day. She’s been harboring the feeling that maybe it’s her fault. The dreams don’t make it any better, and Grandfather’s quiet presence has cemented some ugly feeling in her chest. Instead, she asks Aunt Andromeda to tell some stories of her and Nan’s childhood.
Harry laughs, then smiles up at him. His smile widens when Draco gently straightens his glasses. “Just a bit.”
“Even the most experienced mothers feel lost,” she says. “Time, practice, and love. That’s all it takes to give your children the very best you can give.”
“But--my family. No one else that came before me ever had any issue with it.” Draco says, sitting up to give Harry a pleading look.
young, dear boy,” but then she’d brought the neatly folded Daily Prophet with her the next time she visited. It was a brief interview on her engagement to one Lucius Malfoy. She’d been surprised when he asked if he could keep it, had cupped his cheeks and murmured about how sentimentality ran in the family. He’d been eight years old.
Harry leans in towards his mouth, and then redirects himself to Draco’s neck, snickering when Draco smacks him upside the head for teasing. He melts when Harry nibbles at the angry red of their fresh mark, though, and curls a soft hand around his wrist to guide Harry’s hand to his chest.
Draco’s nodding before he’s even done talking, but the sound of shuffling has him casting a furtive glance around the room. He doesn’t think he was imagining the alpha Lady Prewett restlessly adjusting her lap (she’d been one of the first people Father wanted him to marry, Draco remembers, and not too quietly displeased when the talks ended), or the covetous look that Daphne Greengrass’ widowed omega mother is shooting Harry’s groin. Possessiveness and lust swirling in his belly, Draco pushes Harry back on the bed and begins shuffling up Harry’s body. Harry curls his hands around Draco’s hips, and then helps him lower his cunt onto Harry’s mouth.
“It’s very normal, dear,” Healer Ouedrago says, puttering around her office with a steaming cup of tea in hand. “Though if you’re noticing your baby’s magic this early on they must be strong indeed.”
Assembling so many people in Koldovstoretz would have been such a clever idea if they hadn’t been betrayed by so many people. Now it has only worked against them: the iconic Death Eater robes separate them from the cramped population inside. It is obvious that the school’s defenders were put through some kind of training, for they move in formations and always as groups when possible, but it is clear they weren’t expecting such a viciously coordinated attack. Harry’s search takes him beyond one-on-one duels and terrified Muggles cradling guns and motionless bodies dangled tauntingly in the air by levitation charms.
By the time he’s done, he’s trembling and kneeling over his work, either from blood loss or heat fever or both, but he’s still upright, and that’s all that matters. He stares down at the completed array, nervously comparing every aspect to the one in the book. For several long minutes, it seems as though nothing is going to happen. Feeling his eyes fill with tears, Draco reaches for the diary, only to cry out in shock at the sight of an eerie purple light filling the corner of his vision.
Harry recognizes the route Draco’s leading him on--it’s a sizable classroom that’s mostly used for Flitwick’s Frog Choir, something that’s only joined by overeager underclassmen these days. The room is taken up largely by aged, creaky choral risers, with scattered desks pushed into a back corner. There’s a chalkboard at the back, a record player on a small table beside it, and a large grand piano that Draco’s played for him a few times. It’s a talent that suits his long, elegant fingers, for all that he complains that he’d been forced to learn.
He covers himself in a disillusionment charm and takes a seat at the back of the large drawing room to listen in, curious about where the conversation will go.
“Choose who you interact with wisely. Your namesake was known to prattle on at length about the power of love, and perhaps he was right, in the end. But always remember that it just might kill you someday.”
Draco nods. Harry squeezes his shoulders, disturbed at the description. Most of the birds had been killed or vanished by the time Harry returned from Russia.
The words hit him as harshly as any physical blow, and the hurt is quickly soured by the anger that won’t leave him.
“Absolutely ridiculous. James loved your mother from the first day he saw her, but she thought he was a little snob--she was right, of course. But when they finally came together… it was a love story for the books. Inseparable, and all the more insufferable for it.” Black says.
Harry takes his place by Voldemort’s side. No more words follow. They don’t need them. By now, this rhythm is familiar. A hail of counter enchantments strip the protections, and when a chorus of rattling shrieks sounds from the barn, they crouch nearly as one and creep forwards. A hooded figure emerges from the barn, flanked by pale figures in tattered clothing. Their sneering lips are painted red, unnaturally large on wart-covered faces. Hags. Not the strongest magic users, but burdensome after an especially hearty meal. The hooded figure must be one of Steppe Witches Dolohov once spoke of, Harry remembers, as he draws his wand. They provide food for hags in exchange for protection, spreading their will between them like some twisted hive-mind through a series of archaic soul binding spells.
Draco shoves him weakly in the shoulder. “I think the world of you! Do you really think me so shallow?”
personal if I don’t write something you suggest! So don’t be shy and don’t despair! I'm a full time grad student and I also work full time (why do you think I usually post updates at like three or four in the morning?), so I take my fun where I can get it these days.
He shrinks back at the narrow-eyed look this gets him. Dad says, “He’s got a lot of time to think about it.”
A chorus of respectful greetings follow, but Harry can hear some of them falter. He looks up in curiosity, half expecting to see some poor half-dead person spread out on the war table--it wouldn’t be the first time--and only just stops himself from reacting visibly to the change in Voldemort’s appearance as they all file into the room. He’s never looked properly human, not in all of the years that Harry has known him. He has undergone some changes over time, but they’d been gradual things, like an extra brightness in blood-red eyes on the tail end of some sabbat ritual, or the flattening of his nose. The twin rows of sharp, curved teeth, however, are entirely new. After the initial shock passes, Harry briefly closes his eyes and reminds himself that he has seen worse, and will likely continue to do so.
“How could that be?” Harry asks. “There are so many people living here, Draco. You mean to tell me no one else can do this?”
“Winny is sorry for scaring you!” The elf repeats, squeaks, twiddling its spindly thumbs. “Winny is asking if Mr. Potter would like a sweet treat.”
Harry pulls him down and wraps an arm around his neck, the other over his upper back, and takes his pleasure with a relentless rhythm. He growls into Draco’s ear when he tries to move, and Draco stills, taking what he’s given. He’s aware of Harry pushing his knot up into him with a low moan, and then the overwhelming surge of ecstasy that rushes up makes him black out.
“Look. How about we go. If! You let me cover your eyes if I feel like something bad is going to happen.”
“Where’d you learn how to do that?” Draco gasps, hips swiveling restlessly when Harry dips his tongue along his slit.
After a while, he begins scribbling increasingly ridiculous grocery lists for the servants, who wouldn’t dare question him, but aren’t very good at hiding their baffled expressions. He spends three days ducking into corners around St. Savior’s so he can gorge himself on feta cheese straight from the container. Mother despises the stuff because she’s convinced it’s fattening. After catching him one too many times, one of the elves kindly informs him they’ll find a way to incorporate it into some of his meals until he grows sick of it. He finds himself ordering gillywater each and every time he stops by a restaurant, and Sonja begins to order some to her home especially for him, amused by the craving. The taste is nearly indistinguishable from water with some cucumbers thrown in, but he swears the extra hint of sweetness makes the world of difference.
They bicker playfully, trading ideas of increasingly ridiculous tasks to prove their love. It is a conversation Draco will not forget for the rest of his life.
No promises, but feel free to drop some prompts (along with comments)! I may fill some when I need inspiration! It doesn't need to be Drarry.
At Draco’s soft noise of protest, the furrow between his brows softens, and he kisses Draco’s forehead. “You’re sweet. How about we get to bed?”
He presses it into Draco’s mouth, and then reaches down to pinch his nipple, the wet sensation drawing a shudder. After a few heated seconds of teasing, his hand glides lower and rubs over his belly. He takes Draco in hand and tugs quickly. The shock of sensation has him gasping into Harry’s neck, his hands fisting against Harry’s chest.
There is no wait today. Voldemort spells the doors to the war room open, and they take their usual seats. To Harry’s surprise, Theo is quick to take a seat beside him, clasping white-knuckled hands together as his father briefly pauses and sits on his other side.
Draco nervously breathes in and nods. They go through a list of necessary but slightly intrusive questions about his health and family history, Draco’s face flushing deeper and deeper with each one. Whatever images and graphs and words that are projected before them when the scans begin is all Greek to Harry, but the Healer’s serene expression is a good sign. After a few moments of silence filled only by Healer Ouedraogo’s humming and the scritch-scratch of her bouncing quill, she finally speaks up.
Al knows they’re a little sheltered. After everything their parents went through, how could they not be? The Potter cottage has been under fidelus charm for as long as he can remember, and he has one too many early memories of being accosted by especially advantageous members of the press. His first year, he’d cried for half the journey to Hogwarts because it meant not having Dad’s home cooked food, and no family quidditch, and especially no sleepy sideways hugs or Father’s distracted forehead kisses. Being the child of famous people builds a thick skin, but he still has moments where he wishes things were a little easier.
There’s a frantic need to the way Draco opens him up, holding his wrists tightly to the bed with one hand, the stretch of his piano fingers a welcome sensation. He kisses Harry like he might find the answer to something between his lips, welcomes the tide of his body with greed and reverence. They’re so impatient that they don’t make it through their usual careful prep, but Harry cherishes that, and the slight burn when Draco pushes in, groaning and dropping his head onto Harry’s neck. He shuffles restlessly around, then shoves a pillow underneath Harry’s hips, and it only takes a few searching thrusts for the head of his cock to score strongly over the aching nub of his prostate, drawing a wanting sob from his lips.
Harry laughs, and Draco can feel him run a hand up and down his blanketed arm as he passes the fainting couch on the way to a bookshelf.
Draco tilts his head back for a kiss, sighing in pleasure as Harry’s tongue slides past his lips, warm and dominating, exploring him with casual, infuriatingly arousing entitlement. When they part, Harry kisses his bond mark, projecting warmth and pride, and Draco follows him out to the gardens with a silly smile on his face.
“Daddy, I’m going to come,” Draco’s announcing it in a slurred murmur, at first too low to hear, then desperate and tinny with each thrust.
Harry gives her a small smile. “Listen, I know I don’t have any right to ask this, but please don’t give up on Draco.”
He finds every excuse to linger after class, clutching his books to his chest and asking Harry wide-eyed questions about his time at Hogwarts, and even the war. At first, Harry’s convinced he’ll be reading his own tales in the Prophet, but he soon learns that Draco’s genuinely interested. Over time, he starts sitting on Harry’s desk, robes riding up to reveal darling mary janes and lacy stockings. They’re the latest fashion, now that muggle-inspired clothing is making its way into a wizarding world euphoric over having survived a war, and they suit Draco well, lovely designs stark against his milky skin.
“We have a deal, but I would feel a lot better if you would rethink not allowing me to see his body… He is asleep, after all…”
“Why on earth would I feel that way, love?” Harry asks, not sounding the least bit bothered. He summons a washcloth, and dabs at Draco’s sweaty brow.
On the fifth day of their post-victory planning, Voldemort drags the Russian Minister of Magic, Dima Sokolov, into Bolotin’s meeting room by the scruff of his neck.
Harry tilts his head back. Ron and Neville’s potion looks distinctly green. Neville raises his brows in a show of wry amusement, mouth twisting. Harry snorts, reaching out to pat Ron’s shoulder.
Al shrugs a shoulder, giving what he hopes is his best charming smile. He's too embarrassed to say he lost track of time flying. It sounds childish, somehow--unbecoming of a newly minted curse-breaker, and most importantly, of an Alpha. "Lost track of time."
Draco slides onto the floor, resting his hands on Al's knees. Al mutters a low curse, which earns him a smirk. "You kept me waiting, Alpha. What do you have to say for yourself?"
At first, silence. And then the voices rise to a near shriek. A firm pressure encloses Draco’s wrist and raises his hand into the air. It pries his trembling fingers apart, and the signet ring floats into the air. It glows with that same purple light and then shatters into a million glittering pieces. Draco grits his teeth and swallows the reflexive cry of dismay. He wouldn’t dare question the Dark in such a way.
. They quickly overwhelm Yaxley, pressing him to the ground with heavy kicks. It’s a dirty tactic, but there is only one rule in these duels: not to use the easy cop-out of an Unforgiveable. Fawley smugly collects his winnings along with the other wizards who voted the same way, and the two contestants are hurried to the back to make way for others.
Today Harry sees more Ministry employees than visitors, though he is surprised to catch sight of the crimson robes of an Auror. He’s scarcely seen the force do anything other than argue and investigate in the past few weeks, taking their meals during furtive fifteen-minute breaks. As if sensing his gaze lingering on their back, the Auror glances over their shoulder as he approaches the table with a tray in hand. He recognizes the aristocratic nose and smiling mouth.
“No need,” Sonja interrupts. “I recognize your partner from his park patrols. It is good to see you, Auror Wood.”
“It’s a duet. Play with me. It needs to be a duet.” She says, snapping her fingers impatiently in Draco’s face on the way by.
In any case, Harry was right about seeing Father. He’s never tolerated Draco’s rare shows of disrespect, and he doesn’t think being a married adult will change that. After he’s fully dressed, he snatches one of Harry’s lighter jackets on a whim, completing the ensemble with a simple handbag--he’s half a mind to stop by Diagon, just to clear his own mind. Then, with a sigh of trepidation, he makes his way towards the first floor.
Theo clears his throat loudly. Cowed, they fall silent. Pansy reaches over and rubs her hand up and down his arm, and he knows there is no real bad blood between them.
They trade a few more niceties, and Harry wonders just how long this woman has been ingratiating herself to Voldemort’s side. Has she taken the mark? She certainly has money--she lives in a castle. It’s of modest size, but a castle nonetheless. And she undoubtedly has connections. Voldemort seems to like the thrill of playing at trying to convince people to his side before conquering them. Creating the illusion of choice is him playing with his food. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if she sold out her fellows to gain favor, but that’s just an educated guess. In the end, it doesn’t matter.
It’s always a pleasure to let Draco set the pace, to take in his little discoveries and bursts of determination. He closes his eyes and presses one hand onto the headboard for better leverage, the nails of the other digging into Harry’s shoulder, and begins a quick, rocking rhythm. He never pulls up far enough to let Harry slip out, velvety heat clenching tight. Harry cradles his hips, more to enjoy the feeling of his movement.
Biting the inside of his cheek to suppress the laughter bubbling up, he elbows a snorting Harry in the side and joins Mother and Father by the fireplace. He pulls Mother into a quick hug, then smiles as Father places his flute of champagne on the mantle and takes his hands, leaning forward to exchange polite air kisses. His grip is tight.
Harry dips his head down, whispering in Draco’s ear. “You know, I was here when I first got your Father’s letter about you.”
It’s not proper, certainly, for a Pureblood omega to spread himself out the way Draco is. It’s not proper, to ride the greed that’s rising in his chest and pushing him to dig his heels into Harry’s back and fuck himself onto those fingers, babbling about how he needs more, that it’s so good, that it’s not enough. But it sure feels right. Harry releases his cock with a pop, curling his free arm around Draco’s leg to drag him forward even more, and then he’s vanishing his trousers and lining himself up and pushing in and Draco can taste himself on Harry’s lips as he leans forward for a kiss and murmurs out, “I love you, Draco,” and it’s too much, it’s
He half expects to find Draco rifling through the cupboards, but the small upstairs kitchen is empty. After setting the owl up with strips of chicken, Harry takes the letter in hand. The envelope is unmarked, but Harry recognizes the handwriting of the letter within as if it’s been yesterday since he’s seen it.
He blossoms in the best way when they make love, and then squirms in deep embarrassment if Harry tries to ask him about it later--if he wants something more, if there are any fantasies Harry can fulfill. When Voldemort first mentioned the “gift” of this marriage to Harry, it hadn’t been proposed as a choice. He’d privately raged about it for months, and then all of the anger left him in a rush when Draco arrived for their private wedding trembling like a leaf. When the time to consummate their union came, Harry resolved to at least make it enjoyable. Everything Draco ever learned about sex painted it as something to endure, and Harry felt obligated to disavow him of every single notion. He wasn’t expecting the sweetness of Draco’s submission, or his shy enthusiasm, once the fear wore off and he realized Harry wasn’t going to treat him poorly. Every opportunity to expose him to something new is a bright spot in Harry’s days.
“I know you are! I was so proud of you when you stopped flinching around the servants.” Harry chuckles.
It wasn’t helping that Draco’s hands had zeroed in on the the stitched hole in his knickers, sewn right above his arse hole and large enough to stretch around even his largest dildo. (Josh, of course had made them specifically, knowing how much Draco would love them, and Harry consecutively.)
The Dom’s weren’t done, though. Nate had let his leg go, shifting to better angle himself into Draco, practically on top of him, and gripping his hip. He was sucking at the stinging bite on Draco’s neck, sending small flares of pain through his fogged mind. It felt like he was using Draco, taking what he wanted without concern for Draco’s feelings and it made Draco want to give it. To roll over and present himself for whatever his Dom desired.
His cock is hard and rebelling against his zip and spreading his legs only makes him shorter, makes Draco loom more, makes the blonde place an arm on the bricks behind Harry, elbow above his shoulder and fist above his head and if the alley wasn’t claustrophobic before it is now.
Sometimes Harry hates Draco’s tendency to speak in abstracts as much as he loves it. Knows Draco can be unbearably explicit when it suits him but enjoys watching Harry while he puts it all together and realizes what it is Draco wants. Harry wants.
signed the new contracts, the ones that said Dom’s only had power over their original sub during play, unless the other wasn’t Dom present. And that whenever there was a scene, anyone in their group could participate if they were there. The contracts covered, in
The oncoming anxiety attack was stopped swiftly and smoothly by Nate’s hand on his shoulder. Draco had just enough mind to take a breath and keep from panicking while he listened to what Josh said next.
Harry let Josh have his way with Harry’s skin, arms tight around his waist, and he watched Draco’s punishment unfold. Soon, Nate was finished with the whip. Draco was still naked, his hands tied behind his back. Out of one of the clubs little side tables, Nate pulls out a bottle of lube.
So Nate’s heightened focus on Potter wasn’t the weird part, his questions were. Especially the hypothetical ones. He’d asked Draco just the other day what his ideal scene with Potter would look like. Draco had already been tied up and kneeling at that point, so he answered without preamble, but he’d wondered afterward what exactly the point had been. And on it went, Draco felt like he was being prepared for a test.
Obediently, and with a coy smile, Harry took his place on Josh’s lap, impaling himself as he went down. Soon he was settled and Josh went back to sipping whatever drink he had in his hand.
He wasn’t one for participating in impact play, but he loved watching it and the intense effect it had on people.
that’s what Harry had seen in his eyes earlier, just as he was waking, Draco staring him down while he slept like he’d be able to claim him with the look alone. The look was intensified by the left-over, smudged eye-makeup.
know about Draco, but only for less than a week, and that it was Draco sitting here deciding about him. And Josh had said that Harry
Draco sat on the bed where Harry directed him, a little out of his element now that Nate was no longer with him, but happy for the chance to speak with Harry none-the-less. He asked what had been nagging at him since Harry stepped out in lingerie and thigh-high stockings. “Is it all true? You really want this?”
He didn’t want to come. He didn’t want to disobey, but doing so felt impossible pinned between these two people who effected him so powerfully. He started to beg. Half-formed words and whimpers falling from his mouth in hopes that Josh would be merciful (Harry knew he wouldn’t be), “I can’t” and “I’m close” and “Please, please,
Josh had him practice saying it out loud. Only when it’s just the two of them at home, cuddling and talking and taking comfort in one another, the way doms and subs do. He has Harry repeat it over and over again, asks him questions he now knows the answers too, but still struggles to say aloud. ‘
A lot has changed since Hogwarts, Draco remembers Harry as having two awkward and stiff left feet at the yule ball. He crossed his arms to pull the shirt over his head, slow and bashful and blushing. They planned this too
His fist thought was who was most likely staring him down as he woke and how far away his wand was. But as the sleep cleared from his brain, he realized he probably wasn’t being held hostage in some dark-wizard’s basement. He thought it might be Sunday, and therefore unlikely he was even on call for the Aurors.
