“What do they say?”
I merely looked at Harry dubiously.
They finally surfaced, Draco almost ripping off his mask in haste.
“Don’t remind me.” I felt Potter give a little shudder. The small motion made me want to wrap my arms around him. “I still get a mountain of letters from them on my birthday.”
Harry ignored the twinges of desire that flared like sparks of electricity. He brushed back his hair, trying to affect an air of casual pleasantry
“Of course, dear,” my mother said, looking up from her conversation with Potter about my Aunt Andromeda and her grandnephew – who also turned out to be Potter’s godson. I had forgotten about that. “You’re always welcome to come look at the books in the library. I think you’re the only one who takes out those dusty things.”
“How about this,” Potter said, breaking our eye contact. He looked a little embarrassed. “I can teach you how to duel while I wait for clues to turn up.”
Which was what? — gratitude? Awe? The emotion on Malfoy’s face looked rather like fear.
Faded, but not entirely disappeared.
“You got me there.”
I didn’t know what it was. I knew one part of me desperately wanted it to be more than a kiss, to ascribe meaning to it that the logical part of me knew did not exist. I looked down at the book.
Of course, Draco thought dryly, that’s only if you survive.
Potter made a face at me. “I’m hungry. Going through all these makes me ravenous.” He paused, taking in the number of books, now organized into neat stacks by me. “How much more do we need to go through?”
“Ah.” I felt a little stab of guilt, though it was washed out by the relief that crashed through me. I was not mentally prepared to face him or what we did last night.
Harry picked up the folio and opened it.
“Thank you for tonight,” Draco said, as they reached the porch of Harry’s house.
I thought about it. Blaise was beautiful against my sheets, long and dark and lean. Anyone would be a fool to turn him down. But I was tired suddenly, though my cock wasn’t, and I wanted nothing more than to sleep.
“Why are you so happy?” Draco panted. That was it — he really needed to visit his old gym in London again. Or have one installed at the Manor. “We’re about to get caught in a battle and hit by friendly fire.”
The existence of the Shield was a reality not to be denied, however, and whatever Draco made of the fleeting impressions when he had held it in his hands, Rosier’s theory made the most sense.
“I’d hope not,” Draco said quickly, before Harry sunk into his memories. “I think our resident psychic here,” – Draco gestured at Madam Rosa’s caravan – “will come out screaming bloody murder if any untoward happens.”
Harry seemed surprised. “I always felt you had a strange reluctance to use them,” he said.
I also needed to ask Potter for some clothes, if I were to stay here for the time being. I sniffed at myself and made a face. And where the bathroom was. I had fallen asleep in these clothes, too exhausted to think, and they were now stained and wrinkled, smelling of smoke and sweat.
I waved my wand. The ash reformed into a sturdy black rope that coiled around Cross.
Draco shrugged, trying to affect ease. “I have good karma.”
Greyback made a face. “I like to make my own scars.”
Potter laughed. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Harry started. None of his alarms had been triggered, and he hadn’t been pushed into combat reflexes as his bio-enhanced system was meant to do with a threat.
I had to resist. Too messy, too many feelings. If a simple kiss caused this much consternation, an involved relationship would tax my emotional reserves to the limit.
“Don’t be ridiculous. I know we haven’t gotten along in the past, but no one in there wishes you harm. Mr. Weasley was asking because you were out of sorts at dinner, not out of spite.” Unlike your father, Granger left unsaid.
And information like this was easily verifiable. Not to mention Mr. Weasley with his well-meaning demeanor did seem concerned about Draco.
Potter came in with a tray of a full English breakfast and the enticing aroma of coffee. “I wasn’t sure what you usually had for breakfast, so I had Kreacher prepare everything.”
My steps faltered as I walked past the boarded-up storefront where Fortescue’s Ice Cream used to be.
I wanted to slap myself. Here was Potter being amiable beyond all expectations, and here was I, making cracks at a wound that must be still fresh.
True to her word, Granger had brought over piles of books from the Ministry on anything relating to memory magic. They filled one of the rooms on the second floor that I turned into a second study.
True to his word, I felt the force preventing me from leaping at Cross dissolve as soon as he Disapparated from the room. I tried the door. It was unlocked.
“What do you plan to do now?” Draco asked. He checked his watch. “It’s almost time to get off work, right?”
“Like the hydra,” I said.
“It is a bit creepy, isn’t it? We tried to clean it up over the years when it was the HQ for the Order, but I don’t think the house really wanted us to.”
“No, it’s fine.” Potter shook his head. “It’s not money. I just hate sitting around, waiting. I get so restless. I can’t imagine what it’s like for you.”
“What do I do now?” Riddle asked.
“That’s why there’s alcohol,” I said, lifting my wineglass. White liquid sloshed within. I made a face at the taste. Too dry.
Searing heat flashed across my cheeks, replaced quickly by the wet warmth of blood. Cross looked at me, his expression pitilessly unperturbed. I felt my body freeze, my muscles refusing to move despite my efforts.
“Shut up, Wormtail,” Dolohov snapped. He regarded Draco. “I think we might need to rethink our plan of taking him with us.”
Draco just wanted a warm drink right now. Laughter and conversation bubbled inside. But he could not face being among them right now.
“Just before noon. You snored.” Malfoy set down the tray. “And don’t think me bringing you breakfast is going to be a usual thing.”
There was a mass of algae that registered on the camera screen like clump of black. Draco squinted. This might be it. It was about the same size and shape, though it was obviously difficult to tell.
“Just what the fuck is going on, man?” Someone else had stepped out of the Humvee. “Our targets are on the move, and we need –”
“I suppose I should congratulate you on your big coup,” he said, his voice low. There was the slightest hint of amusement, though the edge was gone now. “Eleven thousand galleons — that’s an absolute fortune.”
When he came out, Granger was holding a handgun distastefully but professionally, and both Ron and Harry carried rifles. Not the type that one used in hunting, but the type soldiers carried on the battlefield. Like the ones Draco had seen not so long ago in the deserts of Afghanistan.
“Nothing.” Draco didn’t want to voice what he was thinking. “You are ready for this, aren’t you?”
Suddenly, Draco had an urge to vomit. His mouth was still full, cutting off air, choking him. The room shrank, the walls closed in.
I laughed. “It’s nothing serious. The curse is very specific. It only applies to the seventh son of the fifth daughter of a farmer who was born on during a full moon. And its effect is to make you only give birth to girls.  I don’t think you need to worry about it.”
Draco listened, trying to make sense of this conversation. What was Dolohov talking about? Harry couldn’t possibly know this ‘master’ that Dolohov kept on about. Certainly, Harry understood what was happening here far better than Draco, but that was his job. Like a stockbroker knowing the Nasdaq or Draco being able to ballpark with precision the range from when a stele might date from. But Harry wouldn’t have a deeper familiarity than a professional awareness….
“Hmm. Well in cases like these, the typical Auror protocol would be to open an investigation. If I were the investigating officer, I would look for clues at both where you were attacked and at your flat. But I expect if you’re telling so late, that the scene where you were attacked is probably cleaned up by now. And your flat –”
Draco reached for it, his hands trembling. From the cold, he told himself firmly. The box was one he recognized; it was his father’s. An 18th-century French gold and mother of pearl casket, with the initials LM engraved in bold flourishes.
It didn’t look that difficult to Harry. Just blank.
“Of course. You must be late after waiting for me.” Fletcher inclined his head, a gracious apology. “I would recommend the bone marrow fries as starters. They’re very well done here.”
“He just bulldozed over the Healer who wanted him to stay longer for examination,” Granger had told me when she and the Weasley brought him back to Grimmauld Place. “I think it’s best he stays here instead of at his flat. You and Kreacher can look after him if you don’t mind. Do you?”
I wandered around, trying to familiarize myself with the surroundings. I appeared to be a house that was similar to the hideout we raided. Blandly furnished (if one considered having torches placed at odd intervals furnished), it seemed to be unused for a long period of time. There was no clue or anything that could be deemed useful to be found. One aspect of the house held it apart from others: it had no doors or windows leading outside.
“Where do you want to start?” Harry regarded Draco with a patient expression. “You kissed me first, remember?”
“Yes,” Harry said. Finnegan gave Harry a look of amusement. Finnegan, too, had experienced more than once these kinds of odd looks. “Lead the way, sir.”
He wondered if it was serendipity or fate that led him to the Shield. He had been a young student once, reading the Greats at Oxford, when he first heard of the Shield’s legend. It had resonated with him, the fabled object that belonged to both Achilles and Alexander the Great, two of the world’s mightiest warriors.
“No, I drink it black.” The words came out automatically. Potter moved so naturally in my space, like he belonged here. I gave myself a little shake. “Why are you still here? I lost track of time. Sorry.”
He laughed. The ropes disappeared.
“Hermione! What the hell are you doing here?”
“They watched me in action, they liked me, and they recruited me. I considered what they had to offer, and I thought that I would make more of a difference with them, so I joined.” Harry sat down opposite Draco. Now that Draco managed to collect some of his bearings, he could pinpoint the subtle, less noticeable changes: there was hardness to Harry’s eyes that hadn’t existed before, a brittleness to that easy smile. Physically, there were additional scars and a tightness around his lightning-shaped scar that was the tell-tale sign of plastic surgery.
It was a funny thing, freedom. One only noticed its lack – rather like oxygen. I had not chafed at such restrictions on my movements when I voluntarily stayed indoors.
“Our main priority should be escaping,” Harry had said after a heated debate. “If we find the Shield, fine. But that’s not number one on our list.” It was an uneasy compromise that they had no choice but to accept.
It was somehow comforting to know that, even after death, he was still here, watching over us, even with that slight moue of distaste which he regarded Harry.
Target straight ahead, Hedwig reported. His spectacles helpfully highlighted it. It still tore at a breakneck rate. Harry endeavored to match it.
“Get a room, you two,” Millicent said. She looked at Blaise and me, her hair tousled. I noticed rather uncharitably a curl sticking up behind the ear.
“Activate full immersion,” Harry said.
To her credit, Luna only furrowed her brows thoughtfully. But then again, this was Luna Lovegood, the woman who was still convinced about the existence of the Crumply Horn Snack or such after five futile expeditions.
“Makes sense,” Granger said. “No one knows about this place compared to Grimmauld Place, and these men probably only came because they followed Harry.”
Potter squinted at it through his eyes. “Doesn’t look like much, does it?”
A burst of concentrated photons jetted out, hitting one of the propulsors. The car skidded, careening –
There was stillness.
“Well,” Draco said, “that’s what keeps this world from disintegrating into a complete hellhole.”
“You’re not seriously thinking of having an owl carry grilled chicken.” My mother looked at me incredulously. “He’ll eat it before you can even tie the package on. Send something else. And how is dear Harry?”
They grabbed the cleaning supplies from the cupboard before entering the lift.
“Right.” The edge of panic faded. Harry spoke in rapid bursts of words. “Call Kingsley. We need backup. I’m going to get out of here, into traffic and then to somewhere safe. Can you handle that?”
They left the cleaning supplies at the landing of the stairs. It was too much of an irritation to carry it two flights; Draco would have flatly refused and made Harry do it if Harry had insisted.
It was a long way from their public-school days when they couldn’t stand to be in the same room without sneers and insults. Then they encountered each other again in Iraq. Draco was with a group of British Museum archaeologists trying to track down looted artifacts from the Iraqi Museum in the aftermath of the American invasion. Harry had been the military detail assigned for their protection. Even now, the sight of Harry in fatigues stirred his desire – back then, it hit him like a train. Draco liked to tell himself it was a combination of the desert heat and enforced celibacy from long hours, but who was he kidding? Harry was attractive, a drink from an oasis in the middle of all that dust and danger.
“Alright. I mean, he is paying for this.”
Theo examined Harry with an experienced eye. “Ex-military?”
“I suppose it is a clock,” Draco said, crawling out of the water. He used his finger to wipe off the seaweed. “A clock and a calculator.”
The two men stepped out of the clearing. One of them spoke urgently into his handheld while the other scanned the area.
Malfoy snorted. His lips parted and his tongue flicked out quickly, a slip of pink.
“Yes.” I couldn’t keep the surprise out of my voice. “Like the Gaunts. I didn’t take you as someone who paid attention to wizarding genealogy.”
Draco read rapidly: “Draco, if you’re reading this, then it means I am dead and that you have discovered what I have been involved in for the last years of my life. I had not told you about the location of the hideout, though it has been a Malfoy secret passed from father to son generation after generation. If you are reading this, I had rather vainly hoped to keep this from you so that you would have the chance to live a normal life without the complications I have brought upon myself. Here, next to this note, are the papers from one Professor Rosier analyzing the findings of an archaeological artifact that the people I have been working with coveted.
Draco didn’t want to think about the morass of red tape that surrounded these archaeological findings. There was a reason why he wasn’t a solicitor.
I could imagine him chuckling as he slipped a finger in my hole, holding me tight so I didn’t thrash uncontrollably from the mix of pain and pleasure. I groaned. Fuck, I was close. My own erection strained hard for attention as I continued to jerk, the warm water a small recompense for the lack of warmth from another’s attention.
“My past is rather boring,” Draco said. “Public school boy with daddy issues and, well…” he gave Harry a once over, “a complicated relationship with an impossibly handsome man who infuriate the hell out of me. But someone that I can’t live without.”
A sharp sensation, like an electrical shock, shot up my hand, into my entire body. I saw clusters of stars amidst the night sky, the ocean waves parting and crashing onto the shoals, trees shaking. Then, out of the chaotic jumble of images, the image of a book swam before my eyes.
Harry hadn’t been kidding about the house being secure. Not only did it have a highly sensitive alarm that would snare a fly sneaking in through the window, but all the entrances were able to be sealed by bulletproof barriers. The front door in particular was welded steel, the same kind bank vaults used. Cameras ringed the perimeter.
“True. I didn’t plan on you being the actual leader, of course.” Amusement colored his voice. “You would have been a mere tool. But at least you and your loved ones would be safe. But now –” Wisps of black vapor issued out of his wand, hissing like a thousand snakes as they flew towards me.
The city of London was on their side, it seemed, using its never sleeping traffic to mask Harry’s car from being noticed by the quarry.
Finally, the sounds stopped. Draco peeked out.
The path, though, was very clearly marked. It was surprisingly incongruous to the woods’ atmosphere, that I almost wondered if someone deliberately placed it for us.
Dolohov surged forward. His hands grabbed the gun. Draco closed his eyes.
Then – an awful keening cry.
“You did much more than I would have expected out of anyone, even out of some of my partners. You showed more initiative and quick thinking than someone more experienced in the field did. Or you had better luck.”
“He might run the moment I do,” Harry growled.
Blaise noticed. He wrapped his arms around me. He wasn’t much warmer but being held was always a pleasant sensation. I sighed, relaxing into his hold.
“Well, when you’re holding it up to the light like that, it’s rather easy. See, the luster is much brighter, compared to silver, which is more of a dull gray in comparison. It also isn’t as tarnished by spending much of the past two or so thousand years ago under the sea, which is a quality of platinum. Silver tarnishes much easier than platinum.”
Shacklebolt reached into his breast pocket. Draco stiffened, half-expecting the man to draw a gun.
“Want to get out of your robes?” I breathed out. It came in gasps and hitches as Blaise continued to work, his hand kneading and pulling at my cock. I tugged at the waistband of his briefs as he slipped out of them.
“Fuck, that feels good,” Potter breathed out as I rocked back and forth. My hands were a startling white on his chest. “You have a great arse.”
“I’m sure you heard the alarm,” Draco said in a calm voice. “By now, backup will be on the way. You’re outnumbered right now too. It’s two against one.”
They both blushed.
I collapsed onto my ruined couch, not caring that I ripped the tear even more. It was safe.
“Where would she even manage to get one?” Harry asked. “I doubt the Magical Creatures Sanctuary would even loan a baby one.”
Draco had to trust that Harry was nearby, shadowing them somehow, hidden by dark arts which mere mortals like him couldn’t penetrate.
A spark of arousal shot into my groin.
“You do realize I wasn’t the one complaining just now?”
I glared at him. That incident seemed to bring him endless mirth. “No. If you must know, she highly recommends your services, though your professionalism seems a bit lacking.”
“It’s platinum,” Theo interrupted.
“That’s classified –” Dawlish said, but Shacklebolt raised his hand.
“I resent that.” Draco scowled at Harry. “I tipped very generously, I’ll have you know. Every time.”
Harry spat out flecks of blood. “You’re not so tough, only beating up someone who can’t fight back —”
“You’re sure it’s safe to wander around here?” Draco asked again. He spoke in a whisper despite the fact that they were alone and that the hallway was cheerily lit. It added even more to the disconcerting unbelievability that they had broken into the Gherkin in the middle of the night.
So far, Draco counted his blessings that they did not run into anyone. Dolohov had been left lying on the ground, but he hadn’t been unconscious, and was likely organizing the search for them at this very moment. They needed to get out in the open, where at least light and the terrain would allow them more freedom to move. That outweighed any tactical advantage in these tiny, narrow spaces where he and Harry were unfamiliar with.
“You can sleep for a bit, sir,” Finnegan said, his eyes on Harry. He had worked with Harry long enough to know the tell-tale signs of fatigue. “I can wake you when we get to our destination.”
“Yes?” she asked evenly. “Why are you pointing your wand at me, Draco?”
“I’m a historian,” I said. “Not an Auror. I’m not equipped to deal with secret societies and dangerous conspiracies. I never was.” An image of a suspended body over our dining table flashed in my mind, the hiss of a snake as it slithered around. And the eyes, glassy with terror.
We had a quick but filling breakfast at the inn’s dining room. I mentioned how I found the front door unlocked last night to the innkeeper’s daughter, and she apologized profusely.
I took out my wand and tried to approach as stealthily as I could. I prayed it was just a thief with a particular liking for bone china and not another one from the group that was after me.
“Did you replace sex with food?” inquired Blaise. “That’s how you always used to sound when you were in my bed.” He gave me a wicked smirk.
“Nothing as good as here.” Blaise slid a glass in from of Harry. “Here. My treat.”
That’s only for emergencies. Hedwig sounded stern.
“I wouldn’t call something that concerns my livelihood and my life pedestrian,” Harry snapped. “How did you know about this anyways?”
“I still correspond with him, you know. He still disapproves of you and your insufferable arrogance.”
“This is what you call good at dueling?” I yelled at Potter over a loud crash as the intruder’s spell shattered a light fixture.
“Er ... no.” Draco has read up accounts and asked some of his colleagues— discreetly — but that was the extent of what he knew.
Potter leaned in. “And what ‘service’ do you require from me?” His voice was low and husky. It touched deep and I wanted to hear it whisper dirty things in my ear.
I could get used to this …. Then I laughed at myself. I had several days to get used to it, and I still had not. He was magnificent in the moonlight, lithe and lean, sleek like a panther on the prowl. He gave me a look through hooded eyelids, one that lingered and hungered even as I craved him.
“Take this off.” Draco wrenched ineffectively at Harry’s shirt with one hand.
“Is that …” Finnegan sounded just as disconcerted as Harry felt.
Potter blinked. “I hadn’t expected you to say that. We’re not schoolboy rivals anymore, but you haven’t seemed so keen on me since – well, you know.” He gave a hopeless wave.
“My father’s reformed,” I snapped. “He’s not a Death Eater anymore.” He’s not that reformed, a voice in my head whispered. He’s just had to accept a new reality in which he no longer has the power to enact his ideals.
“I want this,” Malfoy said. “You’re not forcing anything.”
“Why did you burst in like that?” Draco asked. “I had everything under control.”
He walked away. My eyes remained on his back. The other patrons had already turned back to their own work. But I was still fixed in place by the librarian’s tone and behavior … the danger in his posture and voice ….
And waited.
“I mean, it’s easier for me to protect him,” Harry said. The man who had just taken down a half a dozen men almost singlehandedly shifted nervously. “I’m going to take him back to Grimmauld Place tomorrow. It’s secured, right?”
“You would be too if you were attacked and kidnapped,” I retorted, tearing it open. I unfolded the letter.
“Oh, yes. They live in London, don’t they? I’ve been meaning to reach out to them, but ….” My voice trailed off. I knew about the circumstances which befell their family. I was not sure if they wanted to see me, a reminder of the War and the scion of a family that abandoned them.
“It’s not your fault,” Potter said gently. “You’re not responsible for this. That man — Cross — he is. You weren’t the one who decided to attack or start the fire.”
My coffee table had been upturned, the upholstery of the couch slashed and ripped, the cushions dumped onto the floor. The paintings on my wall were thrown onto the ground with enough force that the frames splintered. I saw that my coffee machine was likewise on the hardwood, the broken pieces still rolling. Shards of crockery littered my kitchen and the cabinets were open, ripped ajar by someone in a hurry.
“Can’t say I’ve been poorly.” It was so hard to speak so civilly to each other like strangers. Draco cocked a small smile. “Can’t say all this hasn’t been interesting. Second time I’ve had to visit a war zone to recover and verify stolen artifacts.” The mythical aspect of the artifact in question was new, and Draco’s pulse rose at the idea of it. It was what drew him to history and archaeology in the first place: finding and unraveling the mysteries of the past. It was the puzzle, the detective work, fitting together bits and pieces of disjointed information to reveal the truth, whatever that may be.
It flashed by. My father remembered himself and kept civil, though his barbed comments made my grip my glass. Even Potter, despite his composure, started to feel the strain, downing more than a few snifters of brandy.
It was the restaurant where they had their first date in England. It was busy; a small queue wound its way around the lamppost, and the interior was filled with patrons, the staff milling around them like bees around flowers.
Harry cursed, ducking under a piece of metal, pushing up the engine. He knew the Firebolt could go at least five times this speed, but he wasn’t sure he would be able to control it.
“I think I found something,” Harry said in hushed tones. Draco crawled towards him, disinclined to stand. His trousers streaked with dirt and dust.
Theo nodded. “I’ll have to sail a bit closer to the coordinates for that current you sent me, but this is pretty near. Once we get there, you’ll get into the water with the DPVs and get to where you think the shipwreck is.”
“It isn’t any of your business,” I said, unfathomably irritated by his fixation on Blaise. I knew he had an effect on people, and Potter was only human, but still – I had expected him to be more resistant.
“Mmm.” I heard his grin as he kissed me back, his hands grabbing my waist.
Harry squinted at Draco. Whether it was from anger or exasperation, Draco wasn’t able to distinguish. He chose to believe it was the latter.
My father had his wand out in an instant. “How did you get in here?”
That voice was easily familiar. The speaker was Malfoy. Harry gaped at him.
This time, I did not refuse his offer.
I snorted. “Your mind simply cannot comprehend the genius of my intellect.”
A cold panic twisted my insides. He couldn’t die on me – he couldn’t.
I was so deep in thought that I failed to see the buffet table.
“I’m afraid those will have to stay on for the moment, Draco,” Dolohov said. A wild gleam of anger returned to his eyes. “I remember how good you are with your fists. Surprising, that. Didn’t expect Lucius with his soft hands and pressed suits to have a son like you.”
“Relax, Malfoy.” Potter laughed. It was deep and toe-curling; I wanted to listen to it all day. “I’m just teasing.”
“Do you really think you’ll be able to hold me?” she asked, her voice silky. Draco recognized this – she was playing for time, the same tactic he had used earlier. No doubt she was trying to distract Harry too, so that in the off-chance he fell for it, she could escape.
Harry made a face. “How long have you been sitting here?”
Malfoy awarded Harry with a look that plainly said he thought Harry was an idiot. “I still glance through them when they get updated so I can be up to speed if I’m ever consulted again, and I would know if there are any significant alterations from what is on file. This,” he gestured, “is different.”
“Hello again sir,” Finnegan said. “You and the commander over there look like shit, pardon my language.”
Potter squinted. “I think so.” His glasses slid a little on the bridge of his nose. It was an endearing sight. “I never really paid much attention in Astronomy.”
“Hmm …” Malfoy slipped his wand out from his sleeve, tapping it against the side of the table. A display rose. “What do you think, Metis? Have any of them been to the Leaky before?”
Luna cocked her head at me. “A journalist never reveals her sources, Draco. Though in this case I’m not the journalist, and I actually don’t know. But it’s a thrilling tale, isn’t it? Lost magical books, ancient societies and conspiracies, a love story blossoming. Oh! That reminds me.” She handed me a white envelope. “I wasn’t originally planning to come to the party, but this came for you, and I thought might as well enjoy some free food and booze while I make my delivery.”
He wiped his eyes angrily. He really needed to make that appointment with the groundskeeper.
“The Manor,” I said. “It has records of Dark Magic and artifacts as old as any in the libraries. I cited some of them in my articles actually. I can’t believe I forgot.”
“No thanks,” he shouted from my bathroom. “Stuffy books aren’t my thing.” His voice was cut off by the sound of running water.
Potter grinned at that. “That sounds fun,” he said. “I wasn’t allowed to be in the gardens without supervision when I was young.” His voice was faraway, as though remembering a distant past that was not as long-ago as he imagined. Perhaps it wasn’t.
“Yes,” Finnegan said, cuffing the man with a smart blow to the back of the head. The man went limp.
I leaned back, sipping my tea. My mind spun from my calculations. I had been — intrigued — by Cross’ offer. But the more he said, the more I realized I would be a fool to trust him. He’d discard me as soon as I outlived my usefulness.
“No – wait, what?”
It wasn’t that I distrusted them; we had been through too much to be suspicious of each other. Rather, I wasn’t sure what I would say. I found a magical book that gives me visions? It would only set them off fretting and clucking with concern. Besides, I was perfectly capable. I have an advanced degree and seven N.E.W.T.s; I could handle a book.
A black sedan pulled up in front of the warehouse. A woman stepped out. The harsh yellow light caught in her hair.
“Your body language, your way of speech, and the way you’re dressed,” the man said. “You’re from Above, aren’t you?”
“Then probably a general reading.” Madam Rosa spread out the cards into a fan. “What do you know about the tarot?”
And was answered by a volley of fire.
“While the clientele of the Leaky are varied,” Metis said, “this man stands out because he had arrived almost without detection and held himself apart from the crowd until the dead Unspeakables came in. If my security system weren’t so sophisticated, I would have missed the hooded man. He has some sort of jammer field around him. It’s good, but not as good as me.”
“Yes. Lucius’ son. Draco Malfoy. He is, I believe, currently an appraiser with Christie’s, though he has some field experience as an archaeologist working with the UNESCO task force in Iraq in 2003.”
Goyle met Harry at the corner, looking shifty-eyed and unkempt, giving the cam-eyes behind Harry a suspicious look.
“Draco.” They shook hands. Perhaps it was her demeanor, but Draco settled down somewhat. She reminded him of a psychiatrist, with her nonjudgmental openness. It was easier to think of her as such, in any case, as opposed to an actual fortune-teller.
Gradually, in what seemed like a lifetime, Draco untangled from the knot of terror. He still gripped Harry’s hand so fiercely it would’ve broken a lesser man’s. Harry didn’t even flinch.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You’re shameless, you realize that?”
“Malfoy,” Potter sat me down. “I’ll make you a cup of tea and call Hermione.” I twitched as he tenderly pried my hand off. I had left nail marks.
A list of names and addresses was projected by Shacklebolt’s console system. “Analysis: all these listed have one factor in common.”
“Pettigrew and Dolohov?” That was Malfoy. He still sounded dazed, but the sharpness that he had displayed earlier was back.
“What?” Draco turned away. “I’m fine.” Damn that his voice tripped on the last word.
“So it’s code then,” Shacklebolt said. “We’ve experience with these groups using literary allegory as code. They do it often, in case regular communications were intercepted.”
Draco stepped into the room. He made certain to keep the light from the flashlight pointing out.
“Ron, go upstairs and get some clothes for Draco. I’ll go and get the guns. How many? Three?”
Harry scowled. “I was injured.”
My father’s face glared at me in the fireplace.
Draco eyed Harry in annoyance. “Of all things, you remember this?”
Then, as suddenly as it came, the light disappeared. I blinked several times, trying to clear my sight, before I saw Potter’s prone figure lying in front of me.
Draco hung up and grinned. Some people never changed.
“Your doorman let me up,” Harry said, feeling sheepish and annoyed at himself for doing so. He was here on legitimate business, he reminded himself fiercely.
“Let them try,” Harry said fiercely. “I have scores to settle with them.”
“It sounds like you want museum pieces,” Fletcher said. “Or pieces that museums would want to obtain.”
Inside was a stereotypical setting so cliched it could have been a movie set. Thick velvet curtains partitioned the sitting room from what Draco assumed to be Madam Rosa’s living quarters. A circular table sat in the middle, overlaid with a delicately embroidered tablecloth. A mirror stood in the corner. Draco took a look at himself and tried to rearrange his hair, mussed from the light spring wind.
I sniffed. “You were obsessed with me. Admit it. Our sixth year … you were constantly following me around. Like some sort of deranged fan.”
I allowed her to prattle on about the difference between reptiles and dragons, only half listening. I was wondering how to delicately extricate myself as beads of sweat were beginning to form under my collar when she said: “Oh! But how are you? Sorry. I get overexcited with my work.”
“Thanks,” I exhaled. “Not a good accessory. Doesn’t really fit the look I’m going for.”
He gritted his teeth – and broke the glass.
“I’m sorry I got you mixed in this,” Harry said. He didn’t look at Draco. “If it were up to me, I would have never allowed you in this country in the first place.”
“A man of the world,” Draco said drily. He settled back in his chair once he was sure Fletcher wasn’t going to run. Harry settled next to Draco, standing like an angry shadow. Draco decided he rather enjoyed this, Harry’s protective – and frankly, possessive – side. “Please feel free to take a seat.”
“Yes.” Draco looked at Harry. “Don’t worry. I’ll be fine. I’m not going to do anything reckless.” He waved at the printout of his father’s papers, the ones he had already read on his laptop. “I have that to keep me occupied for a good week or so.”
“Just kill me and spare me your taunts,” Harry spat. He gave Draco a tortured look.” And leave Draco out of this. He doesn’t know anything. He’s not involved in this.”
“No! The memory’s triggered by blood ties! To Slytherin. That’s why the Circle wanted me to have the book, because they aren’t related to him and there aren’t any other living descendants left. Well, apart from my parents. That’s why they wanted the Dark Lord! He was a direct descendant of Slytherin.”
‘I know you can kill me, but then you’ll lose a great opportunity,’ the man said. ‘And I promise you, it’ll be a bargain that benefits both of us.’
Shot, shot, shot. The driver had been shot. And that meant that –
And we needed to know what my father had seen or heard, either personally or from whispers, about the Dark Lord’s ties with the Circle. My father, as much as I hated the fact, counted amongst his inner circle. The Dark Lord did not confide in anyone, but Lucius Malfoy would never be so inattentive to the currents of power.
It was always odd for an adult to return to school; it was even stranger, given the storm my last year had been. I forced myself to avoid recollections of the past and focus on my current environment. I had never been in the Headmaster’s Office before, and the details of it were fascinating enough to distract me.
“No. Honesty is generally – though not usually – the best way.” Rosa folded her hands in her lap. “Do you want to pick another card?”
“The elf’s bringing in a tray.”
I stilled and concentrated on calming myself the way that I learned in yoga. I pressed one thumb over my left nostril as I breathed in through the other, then released and exhaled. I repeated the process several times until the tingle of terror faded.
“Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa are waiting for the young masters Draco and Potter,” the house elf waiting for us squeaked. “If you will follow me, the dinner is in the Small Room.”
“I didn’t want you to get caught up in this,” Harry said, and he had dropped to a whisper now. “I didn’t want to see you doing what you’ve just done. I didn’t want to be the cause of why you have to sacrifice your principles or put yourself in danger just for me.”
“You can just pick one for me,” Potter grumbled, but he followed me inside.
But he didn’t. Harry had made it clear — he wanted nothing to do with Draco, and it was not so much a hint as it was a full-page advert.
I glanced at Potter. I wasn’t sure if it were Potter’s presence or my father just felt recalcitrant today, but this approach wasn’t working.
“Well ….” Draco didn’t want to say that wasn’t far off the mark, especially given her work as a professor of the history of the occult. “You’re not bound by the narrow thinking of some of your colleagues.”
We had politely refused McGonagall’s offer of dinner, as time was of the essence, and we needed to leave for Godric’s Hollow as soon as possible. Despite this, neither me nor Harry could resist the temptation to wander the grounds of Hogwarts one more time, even for only briefly.
Draco kicked at Harry. His legs were just long enough to touch the edge of Harry’s shoes.
It was strange, how much had stayed the same since I knew him from our school days. The same obstinacy and determination to do right by others that used to annoy me so much were now qualities that exerted a magnetic pull. Perhaps I just needed maturity to appreciate those traits.
Well, Harry supposed a tenuous lead was better than no lead at all.
Draco glared at Harry. “I know you must be talking about Granger, because you sure as hell are not talking about me.”
“So come with me,” I said. “You watch my back, I’ll watch yours. But you know Granger’s right. This might be the only chance we get to see what Cross is up to.”
“Listen to me,” Harry continued earnestly, “this might be related to the drug proliferation. You can’t possibly be unaware of that, can you? And the deaths of Unspeakables related to this top-secret Ministry project with our SIs – this is bigger than you or me. I know you dislike and distrust the Ministry, especially after the way it conducted itself after Voldemort’s coup, but we need your help on this.”
It shone, a sparkle of gold and silver that one didn’t need infrared to see clearly.
Harry stopped with a chastened expression. “Sorry.”
My hand was met with a terrible burning that threatened to sear off my flesh. And yet I could not let go. I did not want to.
Potter nodded, as if I had merely relayed to him the weather instead of a theory based on circumstantial evidence and thin conjecture.
“You look good,” he said at long last. “Should I have dressed nicer?” He had changed out of his training clothes into a long-sleeve tee and jeans that made me sneak a look at his arse.
They burst into action, flinging out their explosives. The resultant bang deafened Draco’s ears as the two men charged into the ensuing melee under the cover of smoke and dust.
“Well, seeing as how Blaise was gonna leave this man with nothing, I’d reckon I’d take pity and leave him at least a bit of his senses so he can make his way back.”
“I mean – that is – it sounds lovely,” Draco said, recognizing how stilted he sounded. “I look forward to seeing how horrendous it is on the inside too.”
“Malfoy –”
Harry stared. “Even an outdated Auror bio-enhancement system has jammers and encryptions to prevent that from happening.”
“Thanks,” Harry said. “I think that’s all that’s here, right? If that’s the case, then I’ll exit out of the sim now.”
Harry wanted to pursue this intriguing avenue of inquiry when Fudge, seemingly recovered, intervened.
The Circle was still active, though, a voice quietly reminded me. Cross is or was not the only member. And now you’re one of the targets.
“What’s there to talk about?” This damn family bible moved with geriatric speed. “You, me, lips, touch. That’s all a kiss is.”
Potter touched my shoulder. It was a gentle gesture, and yet I felt in it all the strength he could convey to me. I stopped myself from instinctively leaning into it. I had to be strong. And yet, every gesture and every word peeled back the layers of my attraction to Potter from merely being physical to something more visceral.
Potter laughed, a ragged sound that still contrasted in its mirth against the tension. “I thought you were going to follow my lead.”
“Go call your doctor right now,” I commanded. “He can’t be moved in his state. I know a bit of healing – I’ll stay with him until help comes.”
That meeting with Malfoy had been enlightening – and raised even more questions.
Granger froze. “Would this be near roughly after lunchtime? We had reports of an incident. Our Memory Charm squad and Muggle-worth Excuses Office are already working on it.”
“This is the best I can do,” Metis said. “The jammer around the man will degrade the image if we zoom.”
I fell to my knees. My breath came in choked gasps. Potter dropped the man and rushed to my side.
“He’s helping me with a research project.” I fastened my cloak and looked at Potter.  Blaise was already settling into my couch, summoning a bottle of wine and a glass to him. “Are you just going to stay here and drink my wine?”
‘What do I have to do?’ the Dark Lord asked. He did not look cowed by the two. ‘I could make you tell me. I can break your mind and leaving you wishing you had died if you defied me.’
“Voice identification verified as Shacklebolt, Kingsley, Auror Force Head,” the console said. “Granting permission to Potter, Harry, Commander, Auror Force, for Case Number 7A.”
“Harry, what the hell –”
It had the desired effect. Fletcher widened his eyes and grabbed the wads of cash and the watch.
“Only if they know about it. But who could think of the audacity of such an action?”
Harry probably shouldn’t goad McLaggen like this. He knew that it was unsporting of him, particularly when it was rumored that McLaggen might be shunted off to the side when the next quarterly evaluation came. The man was under immense pressure to show results, and no matter he blustered, tin could only be polished so much and still never resemble even silver.
“Poor little rich boy,” Harry laughed and even Shacklebolt appeared amused.
It had been swiftly replaced by Lucius’s typical mask of patrician arrogance. Lucius had hurriedly rushed the man out of the Manor before returning.
“Come in closer, then.” Draco was ready. He never thought he would miss this, having filed this part of himself away when Harry left. It was too painful a recollection.
Draco cordoned off those emotions, focusing on the lady now laying out her pack of Tarot with professional precision.
“I think I know where this is going.” I draped the covers over me to present a hopefully more composed appearance. “You’re going to ask me to work for you, aren’t you?”
“Galleon for your thoughts,” Blaise murmured, sliding into the seat next to me. Across from us, Milly and Goyle were in their own little world.
Annoyance was mounting under the smile plastered on. Fletcher was not poor dinner company, but Draco was tired. He wanted to finish this. The sooner the entire business with the Shield and Riddle ended, the sooner Draco could stop looking over his shoulder every minute.
Draco shook his head. “I’m fine.” They walked under the electric hum of the streetlights.
I dumped out its contents on the floor. Parchment, quill, ink bottles rolled with a clamor, the books falling out of the bag with a much more solid bang.
Then Harry pulled back. There was a moist pop. Draco licked his lips.
“Hello, Draco,” Harry said, when Draco didn’t respond. “Do you want sit down and close your mouth before a fly slips in?”
“Aren’t you the family historian, Draco? Shouldn’t you have a better grasp on these matters than me?”
“You didn’t want to.” Blaise’s sexual appetite was legend. He craved variety, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t countenance the idea of sharing my lover with anyone else. I didn’t blame him – I also had no idea how to be a loving partner back then. I still didn’t.
If he were to help. Somehow, I doubted he would.
Draco scowled. He had almost forgotten about Dawlish entirely until the man showed up tonight. Apparently, Dawlish was responsible for monitoring the Secret Service’s worldwide activities and thus had been the first to receive the call.
“We should come back more often,” I said, non sequitur. “I dunno about McGonagall’s offer to lecture, but I do want to visit again. It’s been a long time … ten years….”
None came.
“I don’t think we could have made a difference, sir,” Harry said. “Creating a viable presence in Underground is the purview of the Law Enforcement Agency. We’re not exactly equipped to resolve social problems, are we?”
“What you did here was impressive,” the Healer said. “I’ve never seen someone hold an Animus Inpertio for so long. Most people would have collapsed by now.”
Potter shook his head with amusement. “No, and I’m afraid to ask.”
Draco jerked up from his plate in surprise. “He’s fine. He’s his usual self.” Mr. Weasley never spoke to Draco directly before. Unlike the others, he treated Draco with an awkward distance that bordered on courtesy. He seemed more uncomfortable than anything else with Draco’s presence.
Fletcher nodded. “They provided several pieces which fit the description you gave. I … ah, allowed them to think you wanted all of them.”
He wasn’t just about to let matters rest. It was too easy to let Riddle just win like this. Draco might not be able to think of any way to resist Riddle’s demand by himself, but maybe with Harry, it would be possible for a solution to present itself.
It was nice of Blaise to allow them use of his Gulfstream on such short notice. Draco thought he might have needed to blackmail Blaise by spilling the details of that night in their fifth year where they had snuck into Dumbledore’s office.
I stifled a cry – it burned – heat attacked my hand, and I felt the skin rending and curling into a crisp –
“Thanks for coming with me,” Harry said as we returned to the inn. The door was unlocked, though both the innkeeper and his daughter were nowhere to be seen at the front desk. I shook my head at their lack of proper security. Even in a small town, they should have much better sense.
Not to mention the ramifications. If a criminal syndicate ever obtained this ….
“Do that.”
“I had no idea that the Ministry would allow a family like Malfoys to hold so many important patents,” Harry mused.
“’The obvious’?”
“You’re making a deal with the devil. And you know what happened to Faust.”
Wormtail hazarded a thought. “Perhaps we could use his help, master?”
He sat on a gilt-edged armchair. “Tell me, Draco, don’t you ever feel tired of people on the streets looking at you with disdain? That you’re still cut off and ostracized by most of society for something that happened ten years ago?”
“Get out of here, Harry.” Seeing Harry drowned me in a tempest of emotions – relief, anger at him for being so stupid, always needing to play the hero, hope. My heart drummed a staccato beat. I wanted to shout at him, drive him away.
“Aren’t we worried about destroying evidence?” I asked him.
Once Draco had stuffed himself reasonably full with chicken masala and naan, he told Harry his findings today.
I was older now than when I had taken the Dark Mark. I knew the pain of loss, the suffering of those who would be caught in the middle. I understood how to use power, far better than the Ministry or whoever’s hands the Grimoire might fall into. Certainly better than the Cross and his Circle minions.
Harry paced back and forth the room, his face thunderous.
Ron opened his mouth to object, shutting it again from Granger’s glare.
The crack of the bullet against the window made Draco wince.
Damnit. Rather than experiencing the stirring hope that I found my hero, I felt like a damsel being delivered to the mouth of the dragon.
“Where?”
“It’s true what she said, isn’t it?” I said to Harry, after we checked out. She had pointed out the quickest path to the woods as we departed for the cave, clearly under the impression that we were a simple couple with a particular proclivity for the outdoors.
“I’m studying it,” I said finally. “I brought it from a bookstore in Knockturn Alley. It has valuable insight into my research project.”
“I don’t think I need to guess what his answer was,” Potter interrupted acerbically.
But I was tired of living under the shade of my past. It had been ten years – in that time, I had traveled to four continents, earned my doctorate, and had achieved something of a name for myself. Yet my heritage chased after me – or, I was not ready to let it go.
I could tell she was intrigued by this, the prospect of a historical discovery. I grinned; it was the academic in her.
“You’re such a tease, Draco,” he said. He pushed me over, his hands twitching on my thighs as he mouthed kisses down from my neck. One hand held my hips in place as the other pulled at my erection.
Her sergeant handed me a flask. “What’s Anima Imp – Life-Sharing Spell? I’ve never heard of it.”
It hurt to say that to Potter. His face tightened.
“Harry’s not affiliated with the Aurors anymore,” she said. “He started his own security firm. It won’t draw any attention from within the Ministry that he’s helping you, and I know he’s been itching for things to do.”
“We only need a rough idea if the artifact is real,” Dawlish said. He appeared to be unenthused about Draco’s potential involvement as Draco himself. “I’ve made my objection to involving a civilian on record and I think it’s better if we have one of our trusted operatives intercept the handoff. We can handle the delays.”
Draco glowered. “Stop making so much sense. You’re making me dislike you.”
Blaise nodded, getting off me. I padded after him, giving my living room a quick scrutiny. It needed cleaning; our activity on the couch had knocked some cushions onto the floor. My coffee table was still a mess, the cup from earlier and my tote bag heaped on it. The magic book was there too, one among many.
Old wounds left scars.
I was wrapped in his arms. We were both slick with sweat and come.
And now here they were.
I looked around in a panic as memory of what happened rushed to me. I was in a luxuriously appointed room, on a plush bed with plump pillows, but it was curiously impersonal. There were no effects that revealed any intimate details, nor were there any distinguishing sense of style. It gave the impression of a guest bedroom in a hotel.
Wormtail nodded mutely.
“I need a drink,” I muttered. I rubbed my temples; every time I used Legilimency always resulted in a headache.
Malfoy, face aloof as the last time Harry had seen him, walked down the stairs.
Draco didn’t deign to take Harry up on that point. “I was never a prat. Just misunderstood.”
I stopped until I was in my suite. I headed straight into the bathroom — my stomach heaving and my head spinning — I emptied out my dinner into the toilet.
“It just sounds so … intimate.”
Draco stood. His eyes stung. It was stifling in the house. It was like an invisible vise squeezed his ribs until he was short of breath, and his skin crawled until all he wanted to do scratch it off.
For a while there was nothing, only the faint clicks of the gears and the shallow breaths of anticipation.
“Ron, you go deal with him,” she said, after he had tossed a pillow at her for lecturing him on taking his potions. “I can’t handle him right now.”
“We’ll tell you the full story soon, Mr. Malfoy. But first, we want to know: did these men manage to take anything?”
“Except the credit,” Draco reminded him. “I did go down there and find it.”
“You can’t do that.” Goyle scoffed. “They’re suspicious enough of strangers as it is. And the moment you open your mouth, they’ll know you’re an Aboveworlder.”
Neither of them had discussed the possibility of living together in the four months they had been dating, but in all this time, Harry had become less of a visitor and more of a fixture in Draco’s flat. Draco enjoyed it, despite his previously ingrained preference for solitude. His presence made the space seem … warmer, albeit messier.
“You can let go of the spell now,” she said. “We have him.”
He slammed the door open, ready to shout – and halted.
“That’s a first,” the Weasley grinned. “Hermione not taking an advantage to give us a lesson.”
“The Burrow? No, it was because after Dumbledore died, some of the house’s protections were compromised, and –” Potter stopped upon seeing my expression. The old familiar emotions of shame and fear rushed through me. “Sorry, I don’t mean to bring up the past.”
Potter shook his head. “Nothing. The fire had gotten rid of any traces, and what was left was cleared away by the elves. Hermione’s team had already been through the scene too, and they didn’t find anything.”
“This was why I left,” Harry said, still in that low voice. “That day at the Burrow. This was why I left.”
There was the muted splintering crash. Draco knew enough to guess it was the door being forced.
“You mock,” Dolohov said, his face entirely without mirth, “but it was with this that Achilles and later Alexander became the most powerful men of their times. And now, it is time for my master to follow in their footsteps.”
“Everything in my life is going fine,” Draco said tightly. “I’m in a happy relationship, I have a good job lined up, and what more can you ask for?” It was a rosy picture, and there was no dishonesty to it. He was happy with Harry, minor issues notwithstanding, and he was excited about his upcoming position. It would finally show Draco’s father that he was wrong, that Draco wasn’t wasting away his talents.
“I don’t either.” This was not something that could be overcome with brute force. I had never wielded such powerful magic in my life. And with a start, I realized this was what people desired when they searched for Slytherin’s Grimoire. Imagine being able to have this at one’s beck and call … I would be unquestioned. No one would ever dare look askance at my presence or turn his nose down at me ….
The words came out before Draco realized they came from himself. Shacklebolt looked gratified.
“I suppose,” Harry said. His back was firm against the leather seat. Harry had managed to sleep for an hour before his alarm, and it was getting to him. His energy was flagging. “At least it means I get to skip the presser today.”
They still needed to air out their issues, Draco knew, but it was a solid step on the road to reconciliation.
“We have to be cautious. But Harry, maybe you should let Fletcher go.”
“In some ways, it did. I don’t think I realized how much the discourse around the War was in terms of black and white – Light and Dark, good and evil. Oh, I can see that my father and the Death Eaters were carrying out horrific deeds. But that wasn’t born in a vacuum, and neither was the Dark Lord’s rise. And understanding that helped, in a way, to understand how much I was at fault.”
“And you were an insufferable showboat,” I said. “‘Oh, look at me. I can catch the snitch with my mouth.’”
“Think about it,” Cross said. He stood up. “When I leave, you’ll have free run of this room. This house, actually. But just the house. You of course will be watched and there are spells preventing your leaving. When you decide to help me, just let me know. And we have already owled Potter. He’ll come.”
With a fresh cup of coffee – even just smelling it woke me up – I fished out the book from my bag and stretched out. It was a relief to for blood to circulate in my legs. I leaned back on the cushions.
Draco wanted to lean into Harry like in the old days. The tension of the moment was upon him; it was achingly poetic, and Draco only had to close his eyes and surrender to it, to pretend that everything was as it should be….
“Let’s just say I have seen material which makes me a convert to the belief of its existence,” Draco said. He drummed his fingers on the table. “Why do people want it so badly? Beyond the obvious historical value. It can’t really have mystical powers, can it?”
“What is it?” Shacklebolt asked.
He gave up. Rereading what he already knew was useless. Draco tossed the book to the side, stood up and stretched. On a whim, he stepped outside his hut.
“Are you sure you don’t want to wait until tomorrow?” Padma looked him over with a maternal eye. “He’ll still be here, you know. And you look like you can do with some rest.”
Harry’s voice was neutral. “I understand.”
Then he stilled.
She gave me a scathing look. “No. Don’t be ridiculous.” She sighed. “I can only tell you that the job didn’t suit him. He did well at first; he’s magically capable of the job, and he loves helping people, but being an Auror was not at all what he imagined.”
“Are you questioning my decision to terminate our relationship with him, Wormtail?” Riddle asked icily.
And Potter … part of my restlessness had to do with him. Or rather, if I were honest, most. The longer I remained in close quarters with him, the more my resolve to maintain my distance crumbled.
“It has been surprisingly busy,” Granger said apologetically. “Though they should have still had someone on duty.” She frowned. It was just the bit of terrifying and bossy that’d probably catapult her to Minister one day. “I’ll take your report.”
Harry dropped to ground, rolling out of range. He sprang up again, sprinting with augmented speed towards the front of the Opera House. A breeze grazed his ear; Harry realized that the shot had been much closer than he thought. It came so close that it had burnt off some of his hair.
Finnegan shook his head. “Nothing. The dispatch only told me that we needed someone that was Inspector grade and above, and you’re the only one that’s not assigned anything right now since we finished our case last night.”
Harry nodded.
There was the unmistakable cock of a gun.
He resisted the urge to rub his wrist. They were covered by the shirt cuffs, pinned together by cufflinks that pulsed a steady glow indicating Hedwig’s status. However, if Harry closed his eyes, he could just about imagine the ghostly tingles of his wrist socket connecting to the fiber-optics which ran through his body.
There was a sink to one end of the room; next to it are toothbrushes, picks, pipe cleaners, and other accoutrements which might come in handy.
Shacklebolt’s face was impassive. “I see. Anything else?”
He glanced at Granger ruefully. “Guess you did take all precautions. I have to say I am rather impressed. You did think of all the angles. Except for one.”
“Really?” Fletcher crept closer. One of his hands was almost next to Draco’s face. “I should be glad, then.”
“There better not be any of your damn socks lying around,” Draco warned, affecting a cheer despite his own misgivings. It was all too real, the danger he and Harry were in, the reason why they had to hide out here.
But that was not exactly accurate … I enjoyed Harry’s warm body pressed against me, the swell of his chest at my back as I curled into the crook of his arm. Sharing a bed with someone else, too, could be pleasant.
“No,” Wormtail said. “But the Chinese government have requested that we complete those actions as part of what they termed ‘additional services’. In exchange, they have provided us with the information they’ve obtained from the digital files of the American intelligence.”
Hermione stared, rather unattractively with her mouth opened, at Malfoy.
“I’ll come with you,” I said, pushing myself out of the bed. I knew I wanted Potter to leave me alone, but the idea of being by myself in that empty room chilled me. I suddenly could not face the prospect of sitting in the dark with my thoughts.
It wasn’t a stretch of the imagination for Draco to believe his father was involved in illegal activity, but he always pictured those being harmless crimes, like tax evasion or maybe a little embezzlement. The charges Mr. Weasley named were serious, and what was worse, Mr. Weasley’s tone expressed a surprised sympathy that forced Draco to realize what Mr. Weasley said was true.
Harry was not a good patient.
“I’m hungry,” he said through muffled mouth. “And I’ve been drinking those vile potions for the past two days, I need something that tastes good.”
I scoffed. “Your clothing budget problem exceeds what I spend in a month. Well, except in December. My mother has expensive tastes.”
Dawlish seemed like he wasn’t finished with his tirade, but he had no other choice than to accept them leaving.
Draco’s stomach chose to growl at the exact moment.
Harry stiffened at the smarmy voice. Cormac McLaggen, Deputy Head of the Aurors and Harry’s immediate superior, had never bother concealing his dislike for Harry. And in turn, Harry had found McLaggen insufferable, too prone to boast of achievements which shone less upon second look.
Dredging up all the knowledge I had about him, I separated it into two categories: actual facts and gossip.
“We have you surrounded,” she said mildly. “We’ve set Snaring Charms and Anti-Apparition Jinx all around the house, and we’ve disabled your house’s magical defenses. Ted Cross, you are under arrest for murder, terrorism, money-laundering, and theft of protected artifacts among other crimes. You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.”
“An Inesco Loop, huh? A spell that traps an intruder within the loop of a certain memory. I’ll go look in the records for a way to counter it.”
She shook her head. “We have our eyes and ears out, but we’ve had nothing so far. If he’s out there, we’ll find him.”
There was a slight burn at the back of Draco’s eyes. He blinked. It was faint praise, but he had never heard it voiced, not once, from Lucius about his chosen career. It was more than he ever had expected.
“It has something to do with Elixir,” Finnegan said, drumming his fingers on the wheel. He didn’t need to do much actual driving; the AI responsible for controlling the car did most of the work. It communicated with the traffic grid on the correct velocity and acceleration, and Harry and Finnegan cruised along without so much as a jerk. “That the dispatch did mention.” He gave a crooked grin at Harry. “Guess it’s a good thing that we’re so familiar with the drug. Aren’t we, sir?”
And then he went mad.
We head out to the living room when I heard the visitor’s bell go off. I groaned.
Draco gave him a scornful look. “Don’t be ridiculous. Of course I’m not scared of an old fraud with a pack of cards.” He stared at the rusty caravan with the hand-painted sign marking it as the property of “Madam Rosa, fortune-teller.”
“I have to take a closer look,” I told him. “Otherwise, I’m not of much use here. I can tell what some of these objects are – namely, the stolen ones that were reported – but the rest are of unknown provenance, and I’m curious to see what they are. I’ll be careful, I promise.”
Draco poked his head out of the window. “It’s a trap,” he said in a rush. “You have to get out of here –”
“The Circle,” I interrupted. “They call themselves the Circle. They have links to the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters, pureblood supremacy, that sort of thing.”
They both looked at me.
Harry put aside the fact that Malfoy probably had violated several laws and regulations with that admission and focused on the point. “So we’re back to where we started.”
“I wasn’t complaining,” Harry protested. “I was just – hey!”
“And there’s a heavily encrypted file that’s just lying basically in public.” Harry drummed his fingers thoughtfully. “I think there has to be something deeper.”
I drew back hastily from examining one. The sudden movement stirred up dust and I sneezed loudly.
“I’m not pretending anything,” I said sharply. Wetness dotted my vision. I looked away from Potter hurriedly. “I’m not pretending anything.”
“It must have been frightening,” Potter said, in a soft voice that I imagined was what he used to speak with skittish witnesses. “I’m glad you’re alright.”
Harry responded in kind. He deepened the kiss, one hand – the one that began it all – still resting on Draco’s leg, the other pulling Draco down.
He had to laugh at himself at that thought. This wasn’t some sort of Hollywood movie; Draco didn’t need to imagine himself in a sleek catsuit pulling up some cable on top of one of London’s most prestigious buildings. He’d probably have the police on him in seconds.
“Seriously?” Theo’s tanned face looked at Draco. “Nothing for yourself?”
Harry was cold and in poor spirits. Though the thermal-tech of his clothes held the chill at bay, his exposed hands and face still felt the brunt of wind. They were one of the few unmodified parts of his body, and as such, they were much more sensitive to the environment.
Glancing around, Harry wondered what to do next. The elevator seemed to have opened directly into Malfoy’s residence; Harry took a tentative seat in an antique ottoman with filigreed legs that Harry was surprised it managed to take his weight.
Harry came back. “They’re on the second to top floor. They have most of it to themselves, with the except of a few closets for janitorial purposes.”
He takes one last look at them. The Potter boy stirs in his sleep. Cross permits himself a scowl. Potter would be the first one to die. But not yet. Flies are more easily tempted with honey than vinegar, and perhaps Potter’s life can be one of the sweeteners.
Harry hoped there was not such a dossier on him. He was exceedingly careful, and Hedwig was sophisticated enough to avoid detection by most of the spywares used by the Ministry.
“This smells good,” Potter said, helping himself to a heap of potatoes. “We should thank Kreacher for cooking.”
“I’m not a dog, Mother.” I took another long draught of my wine. “I don’t need to be walked.” Potter was fit, though. In more than one sense of the word. I looked him over appreciatively. Much better at handling this dinner than I was, too; I was already in need of a third glass. I
“Thank you,” Harry said. The words were as soft as the rustling of the sheets. “You took a bullet for me.”
He leaned over me, pressed me into the couch. His arms hemmed me in between the cushions as he kissed me. I arched my back to meet his mouth, my arms reaching and cupping his arse.
“Yes.” Shacklebolt frowned. “If only they didn’t disdain our efforts at community liaison. We could have created a much more positive working relationship with them had we began our efforts earlier.”
“You Aurors never really think, do you?” Harry could just make out Goyle shaking his head. “With conditions in London the way they are, do you really think ordinary people could afford to live up there? Even if they could somehow manage to squeeze out a living, they’ll still be harassed by the sheer number of restrictions you lot have placed. Down here, while it isn’t ideal, it’s much freer and survivable.”
I hated that I agreed with Harry on this. The thought of Cross out there ….
I told Granger what had happened back in the Reading Room. My head still ached from the backlash. She seemed impressed.
Draco’s brows creased. He never received guests at the Manor. His father’s old set had all but dispersed, and Draco’s own friends all lived in London. Draco had not socialized with any of the local villagers; he had only stepped into the local post office once.
Strangely, she had always been fond of me, despite having been imprisoned in my cellar. She was the one who soothed me when, under orders from the Dark Lord to check on the prisoners, I broke down. The others only directed their hate and fear, emotions that were well-founded. I didn’t blame them.
“Blood!”
“So what is the plan?” Draco asked, watching Harry change into a loose-fitting tunic whose coloring blended in with the sand. “I’m just supposed to wait for you here?”
“We’ll post a watch on this place,” Shacklebolt reassured him. “And the attention will be on you and Draco. I don’t think Riddle will waste resources coming after these two until you’re dealt with.”
“Sir!” There was a shout from underneath the floorboards. “You need to come down here!”
Then, just as quickly, it faded. The room returned into its gloomy self, the abruptness of it leaving me blind in the dark.
Harry thought about Hedwig, his own SI. He could never think of her as simply a computer program or software. She was a part of him; a living, breathing aspect of him that was more than a voice in his head. He nodded. “I know. They’re their own being. But I thought it was impossible for them to remain sane in a physical body. Their nature is so different, even from an animal’s.”
“Hullo Luna.” She looked tanned. I wondered where in the world she had gone this time. She was a Magizoologist now with her husband, Rolf Scamander; I occasionally received her postcards from the most exotic of locales. “You look well.”
Once he had the Shield, he would finally be free of the constraints that necessity had imposed on him. He would no longer need to skulk in the shadows, waiting for his plans top blossom.
Potter was sitting in the drawing room when I went to find him. It took some doing; although not as large as the Manor, this house still had a multitude of rooms that was a maze to navigate.
“Potter, just shut up. I know you want this too.” Malfoy ran a thumb over Harry’s cock. It was swollen with need, and already the tip was staining the fabric of his underpants. Malfoy bent over, his breath hot and heavy, slipped it out, and took the entirety in.
“I know.” Granger looked at my sympathetically. “But you’re the only one who has a clue as to where the Grimoire is right now. And it seems that you’re somehow meant to find it. I’m not going to question that everything happens for a reason.”
Draco wasn’t sure why. He was reasonably certain that his assessment of how the Shield worked and his resetting the Decoder was accurate. There was still space for doubt but Draco had done the analysis to the best of his ability — his integrity would not have permitted otherwise. Even now, it rankled that might’ve made a mistake.
Potter shook his head. “I still think it’s a bad idea. You’ll still be exposed.”
“Yes,” the computer said. “I cannot provide the list to you. I do not have permission.”
His expression softened. “You’re stronger than you’re feeling right now, I can guarantee you that.”
Harry laughed. He pressed a kiss to Draco’s forehead. “Come on. Let’s get out of the cold and go to dinner.”
“Your biomechanical system is outdated,” Malfoy said, guessing Harry’s thoughts. “It’s not going to get triggered unless you’re already in a state of alert. The newer systems solve this by having their SIs constantly monitor their surroundings, but yours is more passive.”
His voice was hypnotic. I moved in closer, longing to have it —
“Well, here is the weapon that harmed you.” Malfoy gestured at the display. “It’s similar to a wand, though this is equipped with a longer-ranged emitter than your typical one. It’s one similar to the rifle that snipers used, though this is a lot more inconspicuous.”
Blaise nodded. “And some breakfast.”
That seemed only yesterday. I had tried to live up to my promise to Severus … it had been so long ago, but if I closed my eyes, I could swear I had just dashed in from the din of battle on the ramparts of the castle ….
“I’m busy,” I yelled as I picked up my cloak and Potter’s bottle of wine. It had a rather cute duck on the label. “I’m heading out right now, so clear off the Floo.”
“Yes. I’ll also have a protection detail arranged for them. Harry’s right, though; it’s best that you stay away for the time being.”
He laughed, the first time I heard sounds of mirth since we entered the forest. It was a salve to my ears after the oppressive silence.
“Most have already acclimated to darkness,” Goyle said. “And we’re not all barbarians down here, you know. We use lights like everyone else.”
“Oh.” Harry should have expected as much.
“I haven’t found any traces of whoever broke in,” Potter said after we ate in silence. “But I’ve increased the strength on your wards.”
She left; I was alone with Potter now. He sat back down next to me.
“You used the Life-Sharing spell?” Granger searched my face, her eyes wide in impressed surprise. “You could have killed yourself if you used it too long.”
Harry fired at the car again, meeting the green beam that issued from the car. Colors clashed, warring with each other and setting off radioactive reactions that left the air scorched.
“I’m not going to hide while you put yourself in danger,” Draco said angrily. “At the very least, let me defend myself. I don’t want to see you hurt because of me.”
As he went off, Draco stood still. He found himself rooted to the floor, his mind buzzing too furiously to think.
Potter remained in front of me, a comfortable bulwark against Cross. I could tell his thoughts were on the same lines by the way he tensed and turned ever so slightly, as to keep my father in his line of sight.
Drying himself off quickly with his towel, Harry sank back into his mattress. It was hard tonight; Hedwig must have sensed Harry’s agitation and programmed it to be more resistant than usual, instead of its typical softness. Harry enjoyed that – it was much better than suffocating in a sea of heated down material.
“He is, and it was damned stupid of him coming out like this,” Harry said, his lips pursed. Draco wanted to laugh; disapproving Harry looked so angry it was comical.
After occupying so prominent a space in all the events that had transpired, Riddle didn’t disappoint in person. He exuded a sense of menace that pressed like a blade’s edge on skin, cold steel against soft flesh.
“Really? You couldn’t have just ordered take out?” Potter sounded amused. “Would have been easier.”
Unbidden, Harry swam into his head, with that mischievous grin and that mop of dark hair.
They were out of the traffic grid now. Harry pressed the thrusters. He was almost neck in neck with the car.
Potter gave me a look and pulled out the seat next to him. My father’s desk was even taller than I remembered when sitting; a behemoth of oak that conveyed solid power. It was clear except for an ornate timepiece and a book propped open with a silver bookmark. Heavy velvet curtains were drawn behind him. The room had a dark and slightly foreboding atmosphere.
“Hey!” A man in one of the Land Rovers spotted and ran out. “You don’t have clearance to be here! You need to go back—”
Harry took out his wand, waved, alerting them that he was here on official business. Ordinarily he wouldn’t have minded them, but Harry already knew, even without anyone telling him, that this matter was delicate and required discretion. Not to mention that they would scare off his guide.
“But --”
Harry stared at the disappearing helicopter with a mix of fury and fear. “Riddle,” he whispered.
Blaise often joked that I should have been a Curse-Breaker, with my penchant for adventure and my yearning to make breakthroughs. But I pointed out it was in a researcher's nature to uncover the truth.
“I’m also doing more research on the Shield.” Draco tapped his laptop. “I’m scouring the web and I’ll try to track down some of those people who’ve been sprouting the more outlandish theories about it. Hopefully, it’ll give us a better idea of what Dolohov and Riddle want to do with it.”
“His name is Tom Riddle, though the organization gives all of its members aliases. His is Voldemort.”
Draco almost rolled his eyes. “Yes. Well, I’m not a big expert in sneaking into places. I never had to; after all, I’m more used to people opening the door for me. Are you sure we can’t simply scale the building instead of sneaking in disguised as janitors?”
Draco nodded. His heart raced from excitement. Criminal organization or no, this was possibly one of the biggest discoveries in history. It might not mean much to people outside a small group of academics, but just finding the prototype to the Antikythera Mechanism would provide an immeasurable insight on science and engineering in antiquity. And if it could decode the Shield….
“Buy you one at the Cauldron,” Granger said. “You look like you need one.”
“I think you’re being overdramatic,” Draco said. “It isn’t like anyone would try anything dangerous in broad daylight. And London is one of the most surveilled cities in the world. No one would be so stupid to pull a dangerous stunt.”
“We will find the Sacred Grimoire of our Founder,” he said, in a powerful voice that was unlike his usual. “We will use it to create a new world, a world where we no longer have to scurry like rats, where we will regain our rightful place in the world, where the Mudbloods will serve us, where we will correct all the mistakes of the past.” …
The walls of the cave shuddered, as if hit by artillery.
Then I looked at my scarf again. That familiar green and the snake was a soothing sight, reminding me of how far I’d come.
But the man already recovered, fast enough that he aimed a jet of red light squarely at my face as I hastily clambered up. I ducked again, one hand hitting the gravel to brace myself. The Stunner hit a tree behind me with a loud bang.
I let out a light laugh. “I think I’ve had enough of secret societies and plots to take over the world for a lifetime,” I said with a little smile. The scar over my Dark Mark itched. “Hopefully, it’s just a story. It sounds like someone was a little too inspired by recent events and decided to make up his own tale.”
He considered calling Shacklebolt to ask for a search on the man, but then Draco had an idea. He opened his laptop and went online, searching for any reference to Rosier.
“It looks smaller than I thought,” Harry said over my shoulder.
Harry couldn’t disagree with that. “With your permission, sir, I would like to make sure. Besides,” he added, “this concerns an Unspeakable. We always need to be careful where they’re concerned. National security secrets and all that.”
There were loud shouts as the man recovered his senses – Draco heard the others jumping to attention now. Out of the rearview mirror, soldiers raised their guns, preparing to shoot –
“Anyways, where was I? Oh, yes; it was a dark and stormy night and I was scared.” Malfoy flashed a quick smile. “Sounds cliché, doesn’t it, that everything bad happens when there’s bad weather? Anyways, I went to find my parents’ room; I was a child, after all, and my parents at that time weren’t the monsters that the media now makes them out to be.”
They had agreed to meet over dinner, for what was supposed to be an introductory meeting, Draco having obtained Fletcher’s name from the less scrupulous clients he worked with.
“Dinner?” Harry seemed surprised.
“They killed my parents.”
“Unlike my parents, I love London, but I do miss the sky out here sometimes,” I said. I looked up. “That’s Mars over there, isn’t it?”
His left ear crackled into life.
Harry stripped with fumbling motions as I did the same with my trousers. I ignored the loss of physical contact that announced itself like a blast of cold, as the sight of Harry naked hit me with the force of bricks.
“Are you going to be safe here?” Harry asked in alarm. “They might try to attack this place again.”
“He likes you,” the Weasley pointed out.
“Don’t worry,” he said. He squeezed my hand. “No matter what happens, I’m with you.”
“Where’s your sense of civic duty?” Granger asked with an amused look. “But yes. I’ll have my assistant owl you with times so we can finalize the details. I have to warn you, though: most of the work won’t be as thrilling as looking for the Grimoire.”
It did mean that here he was now, freezing in the bitter cold, while trying to track down one single car, trying to find it in the crush of London’s insane traffic. It was like fishing for a needle that had dropped into the ocean.
I shifted my scarf out of the way to make space. There was still much to do, but I was no longer lost at sea; I was near the coast – the outline was clear. I was close. I tasted it.
While Harry had been checking the time, one of the men on the floor had lunged at the closest discarded gun, raised it. And fired.
It seems too much of a coincidence for that drug to be proliferating and then someone with access to these plans dies of an overdose, Harry said. I don’t buy it.
“Really?” Malfoy nipped at Harry, and Harry rose to meet Malfoy’s mouth. “I think too highly of myself?”
The innkeeper was lying on his back next to the ladder. Shattered clay littered the space around him. There was a nasty gash at the back of his head where it met the ground. There was no time to waste; I knew without the immediate intervention of magic the man will die.
Malfoy was impeccably coiffed and attired, his sleek blond hair reflecting the colors, and while he wasn’t dressed as formally as Harry had seen him last in evening wear, Malfoy was still in a slim suit showing off his lean build.
“Sorry, sir,” Harry said, emphasizing the last word with all the disdain he could muster. “It’s been a long night.”
Potter’s face paled. I had struck home with my point. He of all people should understand how dangerous if the Grimoire fell into the wrong hands. I longed to ask about his experience in there, the details how he found it, how the reality compared to the legend.
“It’s too far,” Draco said. “I would be missing what happens.” This must be how a volcanologist feels, Draco thought. Most of the time, it’s mind-numbingly boring, but when the moment comes, it’s all hands on deck.
“That’s right,” Harry said, after they entered Malfoy’s private box overlooking the dance floor. It was sumptuously decorated space with plush red velvet and silken pillows. “I’m following up on the leads of the victim I questioned you about earlier.”
I opened Harry’s gift again, looking at the cufflinks, little glints of blue winking at me in the dim. They were nice, very old, and I pondered their provenance. I forgot whose room I stayed at while I was hiding at Grimmauld Place; I should ask Harry later. Or Kreacher. That old elf must know; if anyone were privy to the Blacks’ secrets, it would be him.
Barely a second passed when Cross appeared.
Draco held up the camera, switching the view to infrared.
Cross scowls. That had been … unexpected. Cross knows he did himself no favors in the younger Malfoy’s eyes when he wounded his father, but Cross had been truly overcome with anger. The treachery of that man will be answered for – when the time came.
Chuckling softly, Harry motioned for Draco to follow him. “Come on. Let’s go before any of the security guard comes.”
“He’s good. He’s enjoying being back in England after spending so much time in New Zealand.” She smiled at me. “I’m glad you found the Grimoire and survived to tell the tale.”
Then they saw it. Both the Decoder and the Shield were in a glass case like what jewelers used to showcase their diamonds. There was a little spotlight in the case that casted the artifacts with flattering shadows. Gold glittered softly, a strange warmth in the cool, almost blank, aesthetic of the room.
“Oh! I almost forgot.” Potter produced the bottle of wine. He presented it to my mother, who accepted it with dignity.
Potter came out. My mouth went dry. He looked more delectable than ever, tall and broad and dark. His chest had thickened since I last saw him, though still retaining his overall slim build. I suppressed a desire to touch it. Sleepy eyes looked at me through round-framed glasses, and those emerald eyes, so often filled with anger and dislike at me, were filled with curiosity. His hair still appeared as if it had never met a comb, but what looked grungy on a teenager somehow worked on an adult man.
Draco had to admit she had a rather winning hand. But he decided to bluff it out.
My father looked at him dubiously.
But something in me urged me forward. Ambition and a thirst for recognition? A sense of duty? A historian’s desire to understand the past? Whatever it was, I was set firmly on this path, to walk it until its end.
She gave a quelling look at my father as he opened his mouth to say something. Unlike my father, my mother had supported my decision to be a historian. What she disapproved of, however, was that my moving out of the Manor. But I was an adult; I had no intention of staying under my parents’ roof forever.
“I keep on telling everyone I feel fine, but no one believes me, so I might as well pretend that I’m on the verge of death,” I said irritably. I pouted at Harry. “Are you sure you can’t persuade them to let me out? Bribery, lawsuits, the odd hand job ….”
“I’m going to bed,” Harry said.
“Don’t touch any of them,” I warned. One of the team who had found the basement strayed a little too closely to an odd, spindly-looking device with spikes poking out too close for my comfort. “You don’t want to walk out of here with boils and an extra arm, do you?”
She stalked towards Harry, the click of her heels echoing just above the beep of the security system that was triggered. Harry raised his gun, his body rejecting what would be an inevitable outcome of the match.
Why? Are you planning to have a contingent come down here for support and arrest him?
“Yes,” Slytherin whispered. “All knowledge, in the end, is painful. But pain makes you strong.”
“What’s the plan?” I asked him in a low voice. I winced as another spell shattered my mug.
I shook my head, chuckling at this ridiculous turn in the conversation.
“Why do you think?” I said, adding the finishing touch. I could just imagine Blaise’s expression if he caught Potter wearing one of his ties. The teasing I’d endure. I resolved to never mention it to him.
“No one is saying you have to give up your hobbies,” my father said, and I gritted my teeth. I took another, deeper swallow. The taste of it lingered on my tongue, sharp and dry. “You can continue your studies here at the Manor. After all, plenty of Malfoys have. Your great grand uncle was a notable Potioneer in his spare time. But you need to settle down and marry someone from a proper family. Not like last time.”
They had only returned a couple of days ago. Draco’s head was still reeling from the combination of the rapid change in surroundings – so much green! So cold! – and time zone. Not that he’d admit it. Malfoys were not so plebian as to suffer jetlag.
“So.”
How did he not know about this? How was it that Draco had to find out his father was under criminal investigation from a Weasley, of all people? His father – his own father – had said nothing.
Everything paused. Draco struggled to hold the Shield up. His wrist twisted from the pressure.
Potter was about to reply to that, but my father carried on. “The Blood Circle never had the book; they were only charged with guarding the key to it. Only a descendant of Slytherin’s can use the key to find it.”
Harry furrowed his brows in contemplation. “That’s too vague. It could be a number of spells. There’s the Protectiva Azura, the Line of Separation, the –”
“Ms. Granger.” Cross made the facsimile of a bow. “I suppose it’s an honor that the Deputy Head of Magical Law Enforcement is here to arrest me in person. Though I much rather doubt that you will.”
I ignored them both, stretching out for my wand resting on the arm of the chair.
“Yes, I’m just as surprised as you are at the way my career turned.”
“How do I know you’re not an informant?” he hissed into Draco’s ears.
“Money that directly finances attacks on our troops,” Harry said.
“I cannot do so wirelessly,” Hedwig replied. “This console has a security protocol that prevents me from establishing a connection.”
Harry looked at Draco with a start. There was something in his eyes that Draco couldn’t read; it was haunted and clouded, and Draco couldn’t figure out the reason behind that.
“More or less.” I had been stuck on this project for over a month now. Though fascinating, it didn’t stir the blood. “I need to think of a new angle.” I ran a hand through my hair.
“I think the trap door should be around here,” Draco said, peering at the floor. The tiles were sharply even, without a break to suggest there might be a hidden entrance. “According to the family legends, anyways.”
I took a tentative sip – and nearly spat it out. “What the hell is in this?”
“If you can call that nest hair. Ouch! Did you just poke me?”
“How?” Draco kept his eyes fixed on Greyback, trying to hide the dread. His heart pounded so loudly he was almost surprised others didn’t hear it.
“Hello. We’re two travelers who need a room for the night. I was wondering if you have a –”
“Potter, I need to speak to you. You can’t keep dragging the Malfoy name through the papers. You need to –”
Fudge looked uncertain, not knowing whether to project the genial confidence for all the cams around them or answer Harry’s question honestly.
A fierce wind picked up. The sky, already grey with clouds, threatened to rain. Granger signaled to us – they’d finished scanning the entryway for traps. It was time to move.
That was, strictly speaking, false, but I did not feel like elaborating for Potter’s benefit, the fetching look of interest appearing on his face aside. This meeting had turned out better than I expected, but I was suddenly exhausted. I just wanted to retire to my armchair with a cup of tea and a good book.
“Well, they have horse-like face, a long body with mirror-like scales and a crest of skin on its head. I guess they’re reptilian but not draconic ….”
“I was curious as to the provenance of that book, Dr. Malfoy.” There was, as expected, the curl of disdain on his use of the word “doctor.”
“Really?” I couldn’t keep the sneer out of my voice. “If you can’t identify it, how would you know it’s yours?”
“Why?” She appeared normal enough in the room’s riot of colors, but a prickle of unease stirred when Draco thought of being alone with her. “Unable to size both of us up at the same time?” Draco knew that most fortune-tellers employed uncanny attention to detail, such as miniscule changes in body language, in lieu of actual psychic talent.
Draco punched and kicked, the gun in his head used like a club. He couldn’t bring himself to push the trigger. Clay targets were one thing, a live human another.
“Who better than a historian to understand tradition and continuity? Aren’t you the one who’s always telling me to be proud of our past?”
“It was more than just lips, Malfoy.”
“Yeah, that’s an example. And this case seems likely the same, with Ted Cross having the same rationale.”
“You do realize that I have never once confirmed or denied anything, right?” The Quibbler had been one of the worst, reporting frequently – and to my vast annoyance, mostly truthful – on what had happened during my search for the Grimoire. I scowled. “My lips are sealed.”
“Well, there’s precedence in articles that have cited Seers’ visions,” Granger pointed out. Trust her to know that. “You’ll probably have to do something along similar lines.” Her good mood vanished. “But I don’t like this. I have no doubt his Grimoire exists. After all, we’ve found some of the other Founders’ Items over the years. But if this book does have all of Slytherin’s most powerful and dangerous spells, then we need to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.”
“Ah, yes.” I hadn’t expected him to broach the topic himself. There was a curious tingle creeping up my arm. I didn’t know how to respond. Do I take the straightforward approach and ask? Do I lie and claim its mine?
“This place is creepier than the Forbidden forest,” Harry whispered. “I wonder what kind of creatures live in here.”
We found my father in his study.
“I think I remember seeing you somewhere,” I said brightly. Potter seemed to count him both as friend and staff, and he probably knew something. At least hopefully the reason for his employment. “School?”
Shacklebolt issued a crisp invitation when Harry knocked on the door.
“This place … it was once my home,” he said. I could almost detect a note of wistfulness in his tone. “But I am driven from it for my love of it. Such is the world we live in.”
“What do these people think?” Shacklebolt asked. “Other than how a shield described in a poem is real.”
“You’re putting yourself in harm’s way,” Harry said. “For something that by rights you shouldn’t have to concern yourself with.”
In any case, it didn’t really matter. It was clear to Bellatrix that her choices were limited. It was the end for her. Her master was lying on the floor, her comrades were lying on the floor, and while she only faced one opponent with equal firepower so far, she would soon be met with more.
Draco filed the information about Weasley and spiders for future use later. “I don’t think it’ll be rigged to keep anyone out. Remember, this was supposed to be hideout, not for storing hidden treasures. We have a vault in the Manor for that.”
“So you haven’t agreed.” Cross sounded disappointed.
“That’s the complete antithesis to the philosophy of a policeman,” Harry pointed out. “We’re here to root out the past and the truth. But I promise I will do nothing more than listen. You have my word.”
Harry coughed softly.
“It’s not,” I laughed. “I can’t imagine my doddering professors ever managing more than a spell to warm a cup of tea. They’re no Dumbledore, even if they are brilliant in their own way. No, I learned it on my own. Came across mentions of it in some of my readings about blood magic and decided to learn the theory of it. I never really thought I would have to use it.”
Draco didn’t know whether to press or not. It was already a coup to have scored an apology like this. And from his reaction, it was clear that it had churned up emotions in its wake, like waves after a typhoon.
“I think I still have an old set of Auror robes somewhere,” he murmured. “Maybe I’ll use a restraining spell on you. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Having me tie you down?”
“True,” I agreed, “and Malfoys do love traditions.” I picked up the cup of coffee and inhaled.
“I am afraid our systems cannot break through the file’s defenses,” the SI said. “We tried everything but nothing worked.”
“I didn’t have that many friends that visited,” I confessed. I stared at the hedge across from me. “It wasn’t so easy to meet other children my age when you’re stuck in a big bloody house all by yourself, and most of my parents’ acquaintances – well, they didn’t care much for children, a lot of them.” I gave Potter a bitter smile. “You remember some of them, don’t you?”
Draco sat behind the Humvee, choking under the fumes, his nerves scrapped raw by every gunshot, every grunt. His imagination, blocked off from the pressure valve of sight, whirled into overdrive – he tried hard to press them out, to not picture the worst scenarios –
“Then I’ll hex him. I won’t run off with him, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“What? Oh.” Harry hadn’t realized he was directly under the projection, with the light coming down on his body in the most revealing manner.
“It’s extremely difficult to disable them,” he said, almost musingly. “The chips are protected by a series of firewalls that should resist all attempts to hack them. Not to mention that they’re tied in to so many of the car’s systems and the Web that removing them would do more damage to the car. Most criminals simply try to shroud the signals from the traffic grids.”
“Don’t talk,” I said. “Save your breath. Conserve your energy.”
“Don’t play games with me, Malfoy,” he hissed, not even bothering with his usual pretense of civil dislike. “Where is it? What have you found from it?”
“I didn’t think there was anything else you were staying for,” Harry replied.
Granger nodded. “Yes. We had reports of a fire at Malfoy Manor. Thankfully, most of it was contained by the house-elves within an hour of discovery, though I believe the study and a large part of that wing would need repairs before it was habitable again.”
“You mean, beyond the fact that they thought it existed?”
We left the cave quickly, not caring to stay a second longer. I felt awkward making my way through the woods with a book in my hands, but it was far too large to fit in the pocket of my robes. Nor could I shrink it down to a manageable size, the Grimoire resisting all my attempts to do so. It was impervious to magic.
“What? Oh. No, no thank you.”
Draco recalled tracing his fingers over that scar, pressing a gentle kiss against it before continuing with their lovemaking. He flushed, turning away from Harry.
Still, at times, I felt his eyes linger on me, though he treated me like Granger or the Weasley and so mfar, did not attempt to kiss me again. And yet, I hated this gentlemanly restraint of his. I wanted him to kiss me. Hard. I wanted to feel his hands on me, pulling my hair to expose my neck as his mouth ravages me –
“They’re not my favorite either.” Potter set the tray down. “But it’s included for the sake of tradition.”
“You can go home first,” Harry said. “I don’t think you’re actually physically needed. The SI analysts can handle this. You get some rest. I’ll have someone inform you when we’re done.”
“I was wondering if there are any Greco-Bactrian artifacts that are available for purchase,” Draco said, giving Fletcher his most winning smile. “Not the usual pottery shards, but something real. Something like what I believe I provided you with.”
I made no sound as Harry took me by the arm and we Disapparated.
“Has Commander Potter left?” he asked. It took a second for Draco to register the man was referring to Harry.
He told Harry.
Cross is willing to try the soft approach, now that his display of force had so alienated the Malfoy boy. It should not be difficult – as this scene before him shows, Malfoy is still young, and hotheaded. He will want more than a simple, reclusive life in the bookstacks. There is much Cross can promise the Malfoy boy.
“What?” he ask, his lips parting in a slight smile.
“Goodnight,” Potter said with a wink as he left. I gawked at him, my mouth opened slightly.
“No wonder he was so quiet,” the Weasley said to Granger, ignoring Harry. “I guess my idea to send Malfoy up here was a good one.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Ron, there’s no time to explain. Do you remember where the stash is? And do you think Draco can borrow some clothes?”
I hoped there was no truth to what she said. I did not relish becoming entangled in ancient conspiracies and secret societies. Besides, though the Quibbler had improved its fact-checking protocols since, it was still nowhere a reliable source of information. I would never include it in my citations. I’d be the laughingstock of the magical academic community.
åFletcher let out a terrified squeak and a nod.
But it wasn’t helpful to dwell on those thoughts.
“Hello, Harry, Draco.” Granger followed on the heels of her men and gave us a small grin. “My team is here to save the day.”
“This incident aside,” Granger sent her husband a quelling look, “you displayed remarkable instinct and reflexes, not to mention your in-the-field analysis proved remarkably accurate, and better than the specialists we usually bring in.”
Draco understood why. He had been unable to sleep, tossing and turning and cursing how much of a fool to exchange Egyptian cotton for such a hard cot. He had stepped outside just as the fingers of dawn reached across the desert. It stirred in him an awe that no mornings back home could ever do.
Then I recovered my sense of adventure as I thought of the Grimoire in there, waiting to be found. Slytherin himself had likely touched those stones. It was thrilling, to stand in the same place where he stood a thousand years ago.
“How about that?” Harry pointed at the room just beyond the foyer. “We can make our way in starting there. The cameras are hacked, but we still need to be careful. There might be guards in there.”
“All right?” Harry interrupted Draco’s ruminations, appearing out of the caravan with a step much lighter than with which he had entered. “Why did you finish so early?”
“Explains why.” Now I was certain there was a note of jealous in his voice.
Draco paused in the act of buckling his seat belt. “If you want to change your mind, we can take a cab. I don’t have money on me, so you’re going to have to pay this time.”
“Do you really doubt it?” There was a fevered conviction in his eyes, and his expression hardened. “I can assure you our support runs deep in the wizarding world. Much deeper than you think. And those who oppose us, well....” He set his cup down. “More tea?”
“Please, no more philosophizing. It’s much too early for this,” Potter groaned, coming down the stairs. He was surprisingly light-footed; once or twice, he had snuck up on me while I was in the library reading or the kitchen eating. He sat next to me. The couch sagged in protest at the sudden weight. “What are we talking about?”
“He,” I confirmed. I thought about him. Dark-haired, tall, and broad-shouldered, just my type. “It wasn’t serious. Or I guess, I didn’t want it to be serious.”
He probably thought he could fend them off better than me. He might even be right; though Potter attempted to train me, I was hopeless. No instinct for counter spells and slow responses hindered my progress.
“We’re there,” Theo shouted out. He cut the engine. “Get ready.”
“How do you know that? I know that anyone from the Coalition forces will be happy to help if they knew who we are, but they don’t know that we’re here.”
“We should’ve taken a taxi or even the Tube. Spring in London is still damn cold at night.” Harry draped his suit jacket over Draco. His hand lingered on Draco’s shoulders. It was warmer than all the fabrics added together.
“I was thinking Grimmauld Place. It still has Sirius’s old security precautions set up and it’s not one of the Service’s.”
“And the Peverells.”
I blame Mr. Potter and young love for spoiling my plans, of course. By the way, I feel I must claim some small measure of credit in pushing you two together. No matter; what blooms in the spring fades in the fall. I suppose I might as well inform you that I’m not done with the Grimoire – or you, for that matter.
“What truth?” Ron was sitting forward on his chair, hands bundled tightly on his knee. “The Ministry arrests who it wants to arrest, and damn the truth. If you want to arrest us, there’s no need to toy with us. You didn’t use to be this type of person, Harry.”
I missed the contact of human touch. It came irregularly and unexpected, and I longed for a day when that was no longer so.
“I’ve heard about what happened, sir,” she said with a grin. She pointed to her console screen. “WAR HERO APPREHENDS ASSAILANTS AT THE STEP OF THE OPERA.” There were several pictures that captured Harry’s annoyed expression and one of Fudge giving his usual politician’s smile at the camera. There was even a snap of Malfoy with that hauteur that Harry was familiar with by now. “You don’t look half bad in some of these, if I say so myself.”
“Where’d you learn to do that?”
“Instinct. I think there’s something that’s wrong with it. It’s too typical, and all the facts fit too well.”
“You’re sure you’re alright?” he asked.
“It might have to do with a recent academic discovery I made,” I said finally. “I think I found a clue to the location of the Grimoire.”
Harry shrugged, the ropes finally dropping. He pinched the guard’s temples. The man’s eyes instantly fluttered shut.
I forced a smile. “It’s better than seeing them get hurt too.” I wrinkled my nose. “I should go and change.”
“Have people been harassing you again?” Granger’s expression hardened rapidly. Our personal history aside, Granger always came down hard on those who engaged in anti-Slytherin bias, or sought to use their position in the Ministry to lord our past over us. I had seen her speak on magical cooperation and the need to move past our historical antipathies. She was very persuasive.
I glowered at him. “What the hell are you doing in my kitchen, Potter?”
The acolyte shifted next to him. “Where will you go now, master? To the moorland where that barbarian calls home?”
Both cars stopped at the same time.
“Yes, Master Harry?” His saucer-like eyes widened even further when he saw me. “Master Malfoy?”
“Oh, come on.” I said, aware I was close to whining like a child. “Give me a clue. I’m going to be dealing with the man. I need to know at least if he’s volatile and one wrong word could set him off faster than an Erumpent horn.”
It was a gentle, one that Harry melted into, his hands grabbing at anywhere he could find. Malfoy was more toned than Harry had thought, supple under the layer of fabrics, and stronger than Harry had imagined too.
The warehouse itself was near one of the development sites in London, where they were putting up enormous luxury towers. Soon, this wasteland of cranes and pitted ground would be transformed into spires of glass and steel.
“I’ve been struck by a fancy for all things Greco-Bactrian,” Draco said without preamble. “I’m beginning my own collection and I’m determined to end with a sizable one.” The lie came easily to him. He hoped so; he had rehearsed it in front of the mirror long enough.
Draco didn’t think. His cock jutted out through the waistband of his briefs. He thrusted, the scratch of the friction jolting him into an almost frenzied panting.
Soft footfalls behind me.
“You’ll incriminate yourself,” Fletcher said uncertainly.
“I touched the book-key and it showed me Slytherin.” Seeing that face in the flesh, even though I had viewed his likeness so many times in canvas and stone, gave me chills.
It wasn’t so difficult, with a relaxing ambiance, good cooking, and strong drinks, for them both to relax. They chatted about their old school days, gossips they heard from their old friends and acquaintances, each knowing to skirt the choppy waters of their past and the dangers they were in now.
