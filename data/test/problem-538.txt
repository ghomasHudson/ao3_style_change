Harry doesn’t enjoy his Saturday off. He stares at the fire in the hearth of the Gryffindor common room. He needs to figure out a way to find Pettigrew and stop him before it’s too late. Until now, Harry hasn’t come up with any clue on where to start. How do you find a man that can turn into a rat and somehow keeps evading the Dementors that guard Hogwarts and Hogsmeade?
I hate Malfoy. I really hate him. I never believed I would meet someone I would hate more than Dudley, but I was so wrong. He tries to sit next to me in every class and keeps hitting my right arm when he makes notes. He says it’s the only way he can write properly and that I should stay out of his way, but how am I supposed to do that? He keeps pushing me to the left side of the tables and taking the seat next to me so our arms keep bumping into each other.
Harry smacks Neville on the back of his head. “Are you insane,” he says. “Just because he’s in Slytherin doesn’t make him evil incarnate.”
It was a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop where I had ended up. But not one with supplies for Hogwarts. In a glass case nearby stood a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye. There were evil-looking masks on all the walls, some bones on a counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. And I was sure that the dark narrow street outside was not Diagon Alley. I was sure if I got caught here that I would be in big trouble. So when the bell at the door clanged, because someone was coming into the shop I hid inside a large black cabinet, leaving the door on a small crack to peer through.
“It’s okay,” Draco signs when he lets go of Ron’s hands. “You try, but I don’t understand a word you say.”
Hermione shouted at Lupin, she was livid. She screamed that she didn’t tell anyone, that she covered for him. And Draco chipped in, that he too had kept his mouth shut because he knew it would hurt me if he would have told anyone that Professor Lupin was a werewolf. They had a whole discussion about when they both had found out and that Dumbledore and the staff already know that he’s a werewolf. In the end, Lupin said that Dumbledore had to work very hard to convince some staff members that he’s trustworthy and I shouted at him that Dumbledore was wrong. That Lupin had been helping Black all the time.
A couple of nights after my birthday I had this crazy dream. I woke up with my hand pressed over my face and a worried Draco next to me. My scar hurt like it was burning and I was glad that Draco was here to hold me and tell me it was all just a dream. I told him I’d seen a snake and had heard Wormtail talk to Voldemort. I couldn’t see Voldemort and when the chair he was sitting on got turned around I woke up from the horror of it. And there had been an old man who got killed and Voldemort spoke of a person they had killed and the person they were plotting to kill, that last one being me.
The door at the end of the carriage opens and something slides inside. A creature with a hood moves closer as the air around Harry seems to freeze. What is a Dementor doing on the train to Hogwarts? Do they think Pettigrew is on it? Will he be on his way to Hogwarts to try to avenge his master by finishing the job that killed Voldemort? Is Neville in danger? Neville is in one of the carriages from where the Dementor came. Maybe something might have already happened to him. And what about Uncle Remus? Neville was on his way to get him. Are they still alive? They are probably dead. And little Iris, still defenceless with her limited control over her magic. What if Pettigrew found her first? Will Harry be the only child returning to their parents tonight? It will destroy mum if something were to      happen to Iris. She was scared to let her go to Hogwarts with Pettigrew on the loose. James said there was nothing to worry about. Not with Dumbledore at Hogwarts and Uncle Remus as one of her teachers. But it wasn’t enough to keep them safe. Nobody is safe. Pettigrew will kill them all. Harry will be alone in this world.
Draco opens his eyes and sits up in the bed. He takes Harry’s head in his hands and pulls him close to kiss him.
“I know this is not the news you wanted to hear, and I will answer all your questions. But let's let Draco put his clothes back on first, make it a little more comfortable for him.” Draco doesn’t know how this can get more comfortable. His heart has just shattered into a million pieces, and there is nothing that will make this comfortable, not even some stupid clothes.
And then everyone went away for the Christmas holiday and Draco and I kind of forgot all about helping Hagrid with his case. We just stayed in bed late each morning, smooching each other senseless. And when we get hungry we both take a short shower, I braid Draco’s hair and then we just make our way down to the great hall to grab a late brunch. None of the other students that stayed behind bother us and the teachers don’t seem to be that hard on us. Professor Snape hasn’t yelled at us once this whole week about having more distance between the two of us. And he normally does that all the time. Always says there should be at least two inches of space between us on the bench at breakfast, or that we need to sit on opposite sides of the table with potions, so we at least don’t turn it into a love potion by accident.
‘Don’t be a fool,’ Harry writes. ‘There are other people who understand BSL. And some of the basic signs are easy to learn. I’m sure your friends will want to make some effort.’
I haven’t used my cloak again after that and kept my promise not to go looking for the mirror. I sometimes wish I can forget what I saw because I keep thinking of you mom and dad. And I’ve started to have nightmares. You both keep disappearing in a flash of green light in my dream, while a high voice cackles with laughter. I wish Hermione was back already so I can talk to her about it, see what she thinks. And I’m afraid if the nightmares continue when the other boys come back that they will use it against me. I don’t want them to know I have nightmares about you. Malfoy already loves to remind me all the time that I have no family, and this will only make it worse.
“I’m sorry, Oliver,” Harry shouts as he turns and starts to run. He can handle an upset Oliver. He can’t handle an angry father and a crying mother, because Harry didn’t stop Neville from getting himself killed.
Harry looks straight at him. “A boy,” he says in a soothing tone. He steps forward and places a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
People in the castle are afraid. Everyone looks worried and tense all the time. Draco hates it that his father is responsible for getting rid of Dumbledore. That the headmaster might be crazy, but that he was not at fold for the attacks and that it had been stupid to sack him. I know Draco doesn’t really like the headmaster, and he hates going against his father, so hearing him say that his father had made a mistake for dismissing headmaster Dumbledore was a big thing.
On our walk, Sirius and Remus told us all about how good you were at Quidditch, dad. They talked about the boring training they would watch, while Remus and Peter would do homework and Sirius would just try to distract Moony. Tonks piped in on how she loved flying against Charlie when she was on the team during her time at Hogwarts. And then I told them how good Draco is as a chaser and that he was voted our new team captain. Everyone congratulated him, even Sirius, who said it was a great responsibility and that he should remember not to favour any players above others (meaning me). Draco promised he would try to and that he was really excited about it.
Harry wished he’d never confided in her. Why did he have to tell Hermione that he has somehow fallen in love with Draco sodding Malfoy? Now she won’t stop pestering Harry to go do something about it.
“Is it normal that it takes this long?” Harry asks. He looks at Draco from the other side of the small waiting area.
For a second the sky is lit up by the flash of thunder. Harry loses sight of the Snitch as he spots the creatures all around him. Did Harry fly out off the grounds that they are here? Harry has no idea. He can’t see where he is. The sky around him is dark again. Harry isn’t even sure which way is up or down. He turns and takes a guess. He needs to get out of here before the Dementors go after him. He doesn’t want a repeat of what happened on the train. He doesn’t want to feel that lost again. But he’s alone. And nobody will stop them. He will break his parents’ hearts when he comes back home without his soul.
“Pettigrew was the secret keeper for his parents,” Harry explains when it’s clear Neville isn’t going to say anything else.
Apart from the Patronus lessons, I also have a lot of Quidditch practice. Gryffindor has won their game against Ravenclaw and Marcus has scheduled in even more practice. We now train four nights a week. And I also still have my therapy sessions with Ms Davis. It’s hard to find time to do my homework. I have no time at all to help Draco with his research for Buckbeak’s trial. I ask Ms Davis how long I still need to go to therapy, that I was doing great and wasn’t sad anymore and all. But she still thinks I need to come by, to talk about everything that has happened to me in my short life. Draco says I should talk to Professor Snape about it, see what he thinks. And I think I will do that soon. I hate having so little free time.
“I know, I’m sorry. Fuck. Okay, here it goes. You might hate me after this, but I need you to know.”
Firstly, I hate being in the Divination classroom. It’s always hot and the fire gives off this awful smell. There are no proper desks, which Hermione keeps complaining about, and we have to sit on poofs. And the professor is crazy. She is very thin, wears large glasses that magnify her eyes and she has all this noise making jewellery on. She scared Neville half to death by implying his grandmother isn’t well. Hermione got all upset about it, said that Neville only had his grandmother. I felt sorry for Neville and asked him if he was okay later that week. He got all red when I talked to him, said he was fine and almost ran away as soon as he got the opportunity. Draco thinks it’s cute how Neville is crushing on me, which is absurd, he’s just a shy boy, always has been.
“Don’t think you are getting off that easy,” Angela spits at him. But she seems to forgive him anyway, as she leans down and places a kiss on his lips before she walks away.
It was only when Black returned to us that I learnt that Pettigrew had also stunned Snape and had escaped. It seems that Professor Trelawney her prediction came true. The servant is on his way back to the Dark Lord.
We thought we were safe, and then the only person that could see us showed up. Professor Moody walked in on the scene and he looked right at me and Draco. We stared at each other for some time. I was sure he was going to give us away and get us in real trouble. But he turned back to Snape and they had words. Snape had mentioned to Filch that someone had been in his office and Filch let that slip to Moody, and then Moody and Snape had this little argument on the stairs. Moody said something about spots that don’t come off, and Professor Snape suddenly seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it hand hurt him. Later that evening, when we were back in our bed, Draco told me about the Dark Mark, the sign of the Dark Lord that was tattooed on his followers left forearm. He told me his father has one, and that he knows for sure that Professor Snape also has it, that he was part of the Dark Lord’s followers. That there was no other reason he would grab for his arm like that.
“It’s for school. We drew a farm today, and I had blue cows. But Olivia said that cows can’t be blue,” Teddy explains.
Just when we were planning on leaving the door to Professor Snape’s office burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall. Draco’s father was standing in the doorway, with a furious face. And cowering behind him, wrapped in bandages, was Dobby. Professor Snape greeted Draco’s father pleasantly. Draco hand had slipped out of mine as soon as his father had walked into the room and he was staring at the floor. For a moment I was afraid Draco would go back to ignoring me to please his father until his foot pushed against mine. He was just making sure his father wouldn’t have any reason for dragging him home this instant.
The staring hasn’t stopped. Harry does it now too. He sits with his friends at the Gryffindor table. He pretends to eat his food and listen to their conversation. Ron is going on about another essay they are supposed to write. Harry doesn’t care. He hasn’t finished any of his homework for the past two weeks. It was something he used to do with Draco. They would sit in silence and work. And now, Harry is always surrounded by sound. He gets distracted and just gives up.
When I looked up again I was staring at a solid wall of broken rock. I made sure that Ron was okay, but Professor Lockhart wasn’t because he had gotten blasted by the wand. Ron couldn’t get through the fallen rocks so I told him to wait there with Professor Lockhart. I was sure that Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall would arrive shortly once Neville had warned them about where we had gone. They would be able to get through the wall of rocks.
And as you might understand, that was my biggest mistake of the year. Never tell Hermione she needs to teach people. She’s started to put together a plan to show our friends that house-elves are mistreated and that thinks need to change.
The next day there was another letter, now address to me in the smallest bedroom at 4 Privet Drive. And again uncle Vernon didn’t let me read the letter, but I was convinced they would try to send more so I made a plan. I was going to wait for the postman on the corner of the street, but uncle Vernon was waiting for me at the doormat when I came downstairs the next morning, so I couldn’t get to the postmen before he delivered our mail. When the post came I saw that there now were three letters for me, but again uncle Vernon tore them up. He didn’t go to work that day and nailed up the mail slot. But more letters kept coming. On Friday there where twelve letters pushed under the door and around the cracks of the window of the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon burned them all and started to hammer and nail up all the cracks around the doors. The next day there where twenty-four letters in the eggs. Yes, you read it correctly; they were hidden inside the eggs! On Sunday letters came flying from the fireplace filling up the house. Uncle Vernon made us leave the house. We drove for hours without breaks or anything to eat. Dudley was howling at the end of the day. We stayed in a hotel and the next morning the owner brought us a letter, addressed to me, in room 17 Railview Hotel in Cokeworth.  She said she had about a hundred of them at the front desk. But I still didn’t get to read them.
“Oh, it was simple, really,” Hermione says. “That essay Professor Snape made us write about werewolves got me thinking. Professor Lupin is always unwell around the full moon. And you two never worry when he has to take some days off. As if it’s normal for him to be unwell so often. I just put two and two together.”
‘We’ve been over this a million times. Start REMEMBERING!’ Draco writes. ‘You need to feed them to a Venomous Tentacula. You lure the Chizpurfles to the plant with the Lumos Duo Charm. This works because the Chizpurfles are attracted to magic. Then you wait for the plant to eat the Chizpurfle. It will spit out the carapace when it’s done.’
“Harry, I love it that you have an interest in something other than Quidditch,” Hermione says. She leans forwards over her crossed arms on the table. “Truly, you won’t believe how excited this makes me. But do you think you can just decide what is best for someone you barely know?”
I yelled and rolled back onto the pavement, just before a purple triple-decker bus stopped beside me. The name ‘The Knight Bus’ was spelt in gold lettering over the windshield. A conductor leapt out of the bus and introduced himself as Stan Shunpike. He spoke loudly into the thin air until he noticed that I was sitting on the ground. I got back up, looked for the massive black dog I had seen only moments before, but it was gone.
Draco’s father started to complain about headmaster Dumbledore first, saying it was scandalous that he had forced the other governors to sign for his reinstatement before he demanded an explanation about what had happened since Draco refused to tell him anything. He wanted to know who had been responsible for all the attacks this year. Professor Snape said it had been the Dark Lord, acting through somebody else, by means of a diary. Professor showed the destroyed diary to Draco’s father. When he did that Dobby started to point at the diary, then at Draco’s father and then he would hit himself on the head with his fist to punish himself.
After Marcus his little speech I could finally mount my Firebolt. And it was better than I’d ever dreamed. It turns with the lightest touch and seems to obey my thoughts rather than my grip. It’s so fast that the stadium turned into a green-and-grey blur. It was so easy to catch the snitch now that I had a broom this amazing. The other members of the team also seemed inspired by the presence of the Firebolt and performed their best moves faultlessly. After I got the snitch for the third time I just hovered in the air to see Draco fly and practice his moves. Because I braid his hair only at the front it still sweeps behind him when he flies and he looks so beautiful when he does. I wanted to fly up to him and jump him right then and there.
Harry spots Malfoy at one of the tables in the back. The seats next to him are still empty. It seems that nobody wants to sit next to crazy, silent Malfoy. Harry takes a deep breath and pulls out the seat opposite Malfoy. He sits down and pulls some of his homework out of his bag. Malfoy looks up from the book he was reading. He’s got a quill in his hand and a large piece of parchment next to him. It’s filled with words, so tiny, Harry can’t read it from where he sits. Harry smiles at Malfoy and then opens his own book. He finds the page about the Full Body-Bind Curse. Flitwick wants them to write down all the proper uses of the charm, when you’re allowed to use it, and what the consequences are for messing up the wand work. Harry hadn’t paid any attention in class when Flitwick explained the charm. He was too busy plotting his plan to get through to Malfoy. So now he’ll have to read the entire chapter and figure out what to write in his essay.
Harry and Draco laugh and then get up to follow Teddy down the stairs. Harry hands Draco his coffee, and they sit around the tree together. Teddy is excited about each present he opens, declaring them all ‘the best present ever’. It brings a smile back to Draco’s face. Until he remembers all this won’t last. Harry will leave him soon, taking Teddy with him and leaving Draco all alone with his pain.
And all this was still fine, What happened next was the start of everything going downhill. Cedric was in the path next to me. He screamed at someone, asking them what they were doing. And then I could hear Viktor shouting Crucio. Cedric screamed in pain and I tried to find a way onto his path to help him. There was no way, so I used the Reductor curse to make a whole. I had to kick the branches until they broke so I could get through. But I’m glad I did.
“And I’m not saying that Draco has feelings for you,” Remus continues. “But if he has, he might be frightened of them. You told me his father is already angry because it came out he’s deaf. I’m sure his father won’t take it lightly if being gay piles up on that.”
Harry shakes his head. “I never paid him much attention,” he says. “Not until today, at least. I think he’s lonely.” Harry takes another bite of his chocolate bar. He knows Remus won’t let him be until the bar is finished.
“Fine, yes, I did something stupid. But not in front of the kid. Come on Draco, be the responsible parent.”
I don’t know what happened next with the fight because Hermione had taken my arm and had pulled me out of the shop. She took me for some ice-cream and tried to cheer me up. When I was not close to tears anymore we went back to Flourish and Blotts where we found the Weasleys, Hagrid and Hermione’s parents standing outside. Mr Weasley and Mrs Weasley were having an argument and Hermione’s parents looked scared and were happy when they could take Hermione back home. She screamed she would write as soon as she was home. Ron wouldn’t look at me and Ginny was still crying. George was trying to calm her down. Fred gave me a fist bud on the shoulder and said it was okay, that their older brother Charlie was also bent and that it was nothing to be ashamed about. I just nodded and was glad that we were going back to the Borrow after all that.
“Dad is going to kill us,” Neville says. He places his arm over his head. “And my head is killing me.”
We had to write our papers in a large classroom with special, new quills that had been bewitched with an anti-cheating spell. We also had practical exams. For Charms, we had to make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk and for Transfiguration we had to turn a mouse into a snuffbox. I managed to do both, so I’m sure I’ll have some decent marks, even though I might have screwed up my written exams.
“You shouldn’t have,” Draco answers without looking at Harry. The bed dips when Harry sits down on it. His hand finds Draco’s and squeezes it lightly.
I’ve told Draco about the visit of Aunt Marge, and he told me I missed a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the situation. He told me I should have played Uncle Vernon, tricking him into signing my permission slip for Hogsmeade. In return for behaving around Aunt Marge. Off course it wouldn’t have worked, since I kind of blow her up and everything. But Draco is convinced it could have worked, that it would have helped me keep my temper. I told him that if I hadn’t lost my temper we wouldn’t have seen each other at all this holiday. And Draco agrees with me that would have been horrible and that our current situation is preferable.
“I’ve got you,” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear. “We’ll get through this, I promise. You are so strong and brave. I love you.”
Professor Lupin told us about the Dementor’s Kiss. I don’t think he really wanted to, but I asked him what was under the hood of a Dementor. When a Dementor kisses you it sucks out your soul. It sounds horrible. You won’t be dead, just soulless. You’ll have no more sense of self or any memories. And your soul will be lost forever. Hermione once said something about the importance of souls, that our magic is connected to our souls somehow. I can’t remember it correctly anymore. Lupin said that the Ministry plans to give Sirius Black the Dementor’s Kiss when they find him. I told Lupin he deserves it. Lupin was really shocked when I said that. Draco took my hand and squeezed it tightly then, forcing me to shut my mouth. I was not supposed to know about how Black had betrayed both of you.
After that, Mr Malfoy and Mr Borgin continued the sale of Mr Malfoy’s his items. I didn’t really pay attention to them. I just watched Draco stare out of the shop window, swallowing away tears. He looked so lost. I didn’t understand then, but now that I think about it, I think Mr Malfoy mend Draco’s feeling for me when he said that his son taste needed improving. Do you think this is why he ignored me when I saw him again in Flourish and Blotts? Is it because his father doesn’t approve of me? Am I not good enough for his son? I just wish he would talk or write to me so I would know, this guessing is just making me feel worse.
Some older Slytherin students made me leave the Slytherin table in the great hall this morning, saying I should go hang out with my Gryffindor friends since I was only planning on shaming my house. I hope they won’t do anything worse to me, like what Nott and Crabbe had done to me in March. My eye has healed mostly by the way. I did need new subscriptions for my glasses because my eye is a little worse than before. But I can see everything just fine with my new glasses.
Included with Draco’s letter was my first ever birthday card. I placed it on my bedside table while I read his letter. But I was interrupted a couple of times. Firstly by Hedwig who came back with a birthday card from Hermione. She’s in France, enjoying her holiday by learning about the local history of witchcraft. A little later Ron’s family owl Errol showed up with a card from Ron. He is in Egypt with his family after they won the Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. Ron is also getting a new wand next year, which is good because that broken wand of his causes more problems than it solves.
Harry knows he’s not dead. He can hear Iris' soft cries and Hermione telling her everything will be all right. Ron complains that he’ll be late for dinner. If this was heaven, they all wouldn’t be here. And his body hurts too much for it to be dead. His back aches and his head is pounding. Maybe if Ron would just shut up about dinner.
“Okay, we’re off,” Harry pipes in. “Before Molly realises we were here from the start. I want to stay in her good books.”
It would have all been so perfect, a child of their own. Teddy, the proud big brother. And then over a couple of years another one. It’s all Harry has ever dreamed off, a loving family of his own. And to do it with the man he loves more than anything is a blessing. Until it all went wrong. Draco thinks he hides it, that Harry doesn’t see how he blames himself. Harry keeps telling him it’s not his fault, that he still loves him. And maybe soon Draco will start believing it too. Harry hopes he will. He knows how destructive it can be when Draco loses hope.
Draco looks at Hermione as if she’s crazy. Harry puts his hand on Draco’s arm. “Leave it,” he says while shaking his head. Then he grabs Draco quill. ‘Hermione doesn’t believe in maximum lengths to essays. We’ve tried to explain, but she doesn’t believe it,’ he writes.
Malfoy nods and then packs away his things, including the book about wizard BSL. He stands up and motions for Harry to follow him. Harry rushes to put his things away and together they walk to the DADA classroom. When they get there Malfoy takes out a new piece of parchment and a quill and hands them to Harry. Harry gets right down to business.
“No, you can think it over, and when you come back next week for the second scan we can go over it all again, and you can decide what you want then.”
Draco can’t stand the idea that they fly towards the pitch where Harry’s broken body will lay on the ground. The sparkle in his eyes gone forever. Draco’s doesn’t think he could keep up appearances if he’d have to see that. And he will have to keep up appearances now.
In the afternoon we hat Magical Theory for two hours. And since the only empty spot in the class was next to Hermione when I came in after hiding in the bathroom all of lunch I was saved from getting bullied during this class. We went and did our homework in the library again. I waited till almost eight to go down for dinner and I was happy to see that my classmate had already finished, so I finally had a decent meal. I cried myself to sleep that night. I felt so alone. Mom, I don’t understand why they have to be so mean. Is it just because I didn’t want to shake Malfoy’s hand during the train ride to Hogwarts?
‘You’re an idiot,’ Malfoy writes. He takes his note (or more his letter seeing the number of words already on the parchment) and folds it up and puts it in his bag. Harry wonders what was on it. What did Malfoy think Harry had done?
Professor Snape came by on the second day, asking me who did this to me. I didn’t want to tell him. It would only make things worse, I was sure of it. And there is the fact that Snape hates me, there was no way he was going to help me. He told me I was a fool for not telling him and that I had been lucky that Malfoy had been worried when I hadn’t come to the dungeons that evening. I really didn’t know what to think of that, Malfoy worrying about me, it just didn’t sound right.
Malfoy moves the book to the side and starts to write. ‘How is this going to help me, when none of the teachers know these signs?’
Harry nods. Draco smiles and Harry wants to kiss the smile right off his face. It’s the cutest thing Harry has ever seen. And if it was up to him, he would see it all the time. Harry will make it his mission to make sure that Draco has no more reasons to be upset or sad. And maybe he should tell his dad. Before he tells his friends and Iris. Yes, Harry can do that. He can tell his dad that he’s gay. He should be the first one to know. Well, the second, as it looks as if Neville already knows without Harry having to say a single word. But still, this is something Harry can do. It’s easier than to try to forget that Draco will never feel for him the way Harry does.
Harry signs and walks towards Draco. “But it does, doesn’t it?” he says. He takes Draco’s head in his hands and lifts it so they can look each other in the eye. “You can’t be with me and against me at the same time, Draco.”
Draco was proud of me for not bringing it up. We talked a little about it, how it would be like if one of your friends would betray you like that. What if Hermione or Blaise would do that to us? I would be so hurt. So I think I won’t bother Professor Lupin with it, it’s obvious he’s still hurting because of it.
Draco laughs and pulls Harry in for another kiss. Their lips smash together, and Draco crawls on top of Harry’s lap, his legs around his hips. It doesn’t take long before their sweaters lay somewhere around them on the floor and Harry starts to open Draco’s trousers. Draco feels relieved when Harry works his way inside him, knowing he’s just as eager as Draco to get what they want.
I will keep you informed about what’s happening with the stone and with Malfoy, but now I really need to get ready for bed.
On the day of the match, Marcus placed my Firebolt on the breakfast table. Most students loved how the other house stared at it jealously. Marcus was most pleased with Wood’s disbelieved reaction. They are both so determent to win the cup this year it’s has become a dangerous rivalry. I believe professor Snape had to stop the two from fighting in his class the other day. Wood thinks it’s unfair I fly a Firebolt, that it gives Slytherin an unfair advantage. Diggory, the team captain of Hufflepuff is a lot nicer. He came by to congratulate me on my new broom. He even apologised again for not realising I fell off my broom when he caught the snitch in our last game. I told him it was fine as long as he would lose all his other games. He laughed and said he couldn’t promise anything.
And then she was off. Ron, Draco and I followed her. Ron was worried Skeeter would go for Hermione next, but Hermione didn’t seem to care. She went on and on that Hagrid shouldn’t let Skeeter get to him and that he’s done hiding out in his cabin. She screamed at his door that he should open up, that nobody cared that his mother was a giant and that he couldn’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to him. And you should have seen her face when the door opened and Headmaster Dumbledore was standing there. He invited us in and we all sat down while the Headmaster summoned some tea and cake. He told Hagrid that we almost broke down his door because we still want to see him. We all agreed with him and told Hagrid that we liked him and didn’t care who his mother was. Draco pitched in that he understands, that there are a lot of students that don’t like him just because his father is Lucius Malfoy and that Hagrid shouldn’t let others get to him, but that he should show them that he’s his own person. And then he hit me in the ribs, motioning with his head for me to pitch in. So I told him I also couldn’t pick my family and that I had to live with the Dursleys who despised magic. And how nobody blames me for them.
But the most amazing present had no card and I have no idea who sent it to me. It is a Firebolt! It has a glittering handle with a golden registration number, perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs for a tail and it hovers at the perfect height for me to mount it. I first couldn’t believe it and Draco was just as perplexed as me. A real Firebolt, send to me as a Christmas present. Who would spend that much money on me? It wouldn’t be Lupin, even though he used to be friends with both of you, he doesn’t have that kind of money. And I know Professor Snape wants us to win the Quidditch cup, I don’t think he would send me a present this expansive. We debated for a little while if maybe Marcus had his family give it to me, but it seems unlikely.
Professor Lupin told me he used to be friends with you both. I can’t believe it. After all these years I finally know someone who knew you both and could tell me about you. I figured this out during Halloween. You remember me telling you that Halloween was the first day my classmates were allowed to go to Hogsmeade. Well, I had to stay behind all by myself. Draco first wanted to stay with me at the castle. He hates that he had to go without me, but Blaise and I convinced him to go.
After they lay on the floor in the living room, their hands linked and one of the blankets that never leaves the sofa on top of them to make sure they stay warm.
Draco lifts his shoulders. “Don’t know. Mother used to tell me how I would make toys fly back to me when my father had confiscated them. But I don’t think I was as in control of my magic as Teddy is.”
In the end, it was Ron’s Niffler that had gotten the most coins and he won a large slab of Honeyduke’s chocolate. He shared the chocolate with Hermione after class. They were being all cosy and cute. No fighting or bickering at each other. And later Hermione told me that is when they got back together. It’s nice that they are a couple again. Now we just need to find a date for Neville (Luna thinks Dean would be perfect for him if he would just realise that I’m out of his reach for eternity) and Millicent and we’d all be paired up. Nobody joked about them getting together, even though they haven’t come out officially, we all know that they are both gay. Some other students do think they are a couple too, just because they are the only two single people in our group of friends.
It’s really cool to learn about magic, even though I’m not always that good at everything. Flying is the only thing that comes naturally and I really enjoy it. It’s a shame the lessons will end when Christmas break starts. I will miss sweeping through the air.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair and turns around. “I don’t need you to defend me,” he spits out as he stands up. “And Hermione, we are not all nerds like you. I don’t need top grades. I just need to get Acceptable to pass, and I will.”
Harry looks away from Draco and grins at his dad. “I was just going after the Snitch,” he says. “Not my fault the Dementors came too close.”
“Who’s there?” the Fat Lady asks when Harry pushes the portrait open. “Students should not be out of bed at this time of the night,” she complains.
It was bad that night, my abdomen is still purple and my body hurts everywhere. I think I even might have bruised some ribs. It hurts to breathe. But it will be okay. I’m just glad they hit me where no one else can see. I don’t want to think about what would happen if word got out that I’m weak.
“Are you in any pain?” Hermione asks. “Madam Pomfrey said you might still hurt. I can go get her so she can give you some pain potion.”
“I know, alright. I’m an idiot too,” Draco says. “Now hold your promise and don’t open that can of worms again.”
Andromeda laughs and pats Draco on his shoulder. “He listens more to you than he has ever listened to anyone else. Now don’t be a spoilsport and help me get these treats ready before the rest arrive.”
They all skip dinner on Saturday. Harry can’t find the strength to go to the Great Hall and have everyone stare at him. Fred and George stop by with some food. Ron is grateful. Not even Harry’s heartache can stop Ron from finishing the bowl with meatballs. He does give one to Harry, and Neville makes sure he gets some as well. Only Harry’s meatball stays on Harry’s plate. Untouched, just like the rest of his food. Harry pushes it around for a while and then just puts his plate down. He crawls into his bed, pulls the curtains around him and closes his eyes, in the hope he will fall asleep quickly.
“Why not?” Draco spits out. “Just because I said I love you, doesn’t mean I agree with your worldview.”
“I’m going to cancel the dinner for tonight,” Harry says. He turns towards the hearth. Moments later, Draco hears Ron’s voice.
“Harry, that is not important.” Hermione slaps Harry on his arm. “I think it’s great that you try to help him.”
Harry passes the fresh fruits and vegetables and makes it’s way to the freezers. Frozen pizza will do. One person meals out of the freezer. No slaving in the kitchen while Draco reads the most interesting articles from the newspaper out loud. No fancy dinner parties or three-course meals. Just some microwave crap and a stupid TV show. Those will be Harry’s evenings from now on.
“I love you too,” Draco answers. He lets his weight drop against Harry’s body, rests his head on his shoulder. Harry places his arms around Draco and hugs him. It helps a little with chasing away the demons in Draco’s head. But they won’t disappear, they keep nagging at the edge of his mind.
When we got down to the ground the Slytherin supporters came sprinting towards us, all shouting and chairing. Blaise was so happy because he had a bet going with Luna on who would win. Professor Snape was also between the students and congratulated us on the win and told Draco he showed some proper spell work with his Patronus charm. His eyes kept flickering between me and Draco and it felt like he was worried. I said the Dementors didn’t even affect me this time and that’s when Professor Snape showed us who the Dementors had been. It was Wood, the team captain of Gryffindor, together with Nott and Crabbe. Professor McGonagall was shouting at them and gave them all detention. Unfortunately, she also took 100 points from our house because of it. When Marcus saw Wood struggling to remove himself from a long, black, hooded robe he just stormed away, screaming something about that Wood was a pussy for trying to sabotage the Slytherin team.
We decided to move further into the woods and slowly the world around us became quieter. We picked a spot and sat down to wait for Sirius to return. I was worried about them all, fighting the death eaters. I only just got to live with Sirius, I didn’t want to go back to the Dursleys if anything bad happened now.
After some time we heard footsteps behind us, but nobody was there. Draco called out a hello, but there was no answer. And then someone shouted a spell that made Draco shiver next to me. A vast, green light erupted from between the trees and flew up into the sky. It formed a colossal skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. In seconds the woods around us erupted with screams and Draco was squeezing so hard onto my hand it hurt. I whispered to him to ask what it was and he told me it was the Dark Mark, the sign of the Dark Lord. We stood there frozen searching the woods around us for the person who had conjured the mark until wizard appeared around us. We only just ducked in time before they all started shooting off stupefy’s. And then Tonks screamed at them to all stop, that it was Harry Potter they were aiming at.
After that Madam Pomfrey ordered the headmaster and professor Snape to leave and told us all to go to sleep. Draco and I slept in the same bed. Madam Pomfrey shook her head when she saw us laying down in the same bed, but she didn’t say anything. And now it’s the next morning. Draco is still in bed next to me. Hermione and Ron are both still asleep and I think everything is going to be perfect this summer. With me going to live with Sirius. Draco isn’t so sure, he’s still afraid Sirius will be difficult about us, but I’m sure that once Sirius sees how different Draco is from his dad everything will be fine.
A beam of light shines into the compartment. Harry looks out the window. The rain has stopped and the sun is trying to fight its way out of the clouds. It’s so different from only minutes ago, when the Dementors had entered the train and almost killed Malfoy.
Once everyone was seated, Dumbledore gave a short speech welcoming our guest and then the feast started. We had some extra foreign dishes and the Durmstrang students explained to us what they were (at least the once they knew, none of us was tempted to try the France dishes, expect Draco who’d had them on a holiday to France and assured us they were delicious).
But on more fun subjects, Defence Against the Dark Arts is quickly turning into my favourite subject. Professor Lupin is a very good teacher. We’ve studied Red Caps (little goblin-like creatures that lurk wherever there has been bloodshed) and Kappas (creepy water-dwellers that look like scaly monkeys) so far. Draco is a little bit shy in the class ever since the Bogart incident, but none of the Gryffindors says a word about it. I think Ron and Neville told them not to, I haven’t really asked them. We don’t see them that much lately, only in class. Ron and Hermione are not getting along anymore. I asked Hermione, and she just said that Ron is a stupid moron. Draco thinks she still loves him and that she wants him to take the first step, but Ron is clueless, so he doesn’t get that Hermione wants to be his girlfriend again. And their pets seem to be on a warpath too. Seamus said that a couple of weeks ago Crookshanks had jumped Scrabbers again. And when Brown got the news that her pet died, it even made Ron and Hermione fight a little until Professor McGonagall opened the door to her classroom and we could go in.
“I’m good at that,” Harry jokes. He rests his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Wish it would stop soon. I don’t want to die yet. Not until I’ve stopped him once and for all.”
Him not knowing what I write in this notebook means he really didn’t read it when he was keeping it safe and that’s fantastic. It makes me feel all warm inside, I don’t really get why. I like hanging out with Malfoy. He’s really funny when he wants to and really smart. Not as smart as Hermione, but he comes close.
“Are you okay for a couple of more minutes? I’ll be right back, but I left Teddy alone in the bath,” Harry says.
But the worst part about the Yule ball was that we had to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas break. And I wanted to go to the dance, the weird sisters were coming and they are really good. But for the first time in my life, I also had a proper home to go to. I had kind of looked forward to celebrating Christmas with Sirius. Sirius wrote that it was fine and that we would just have to make the next summer holiday extra special. But it still felt wrong to stay at Hogwarts now that I have a home and a family that loves me.
We had to get up so early to take the Port-key. It was just for me and Draco, all the others could apparate but they said it would be more fun if we would all go together as a group. Tonks regretted that decision in the morning, complained that it was too early, that her head hadn’t recovered yet and Remus jokes she should have drunk less. It sounded like he, Sirius and Tonks had a little party last night when we were already in bed.
“Thank you, Draco. I’ll write a prescription, and then you can pick it up at the hospital’s pharmacy when you go home today. It’s already late now, so I would advise waiting till tomorrow morning before you take the potion. This way, if you start to lose too much blood, you don’t end up with the slimmed-down night crew here at the hospital.”
“One more remark like that and you can leave this house,” Harry says from the doorway. Pansy looks up at him and waves her hand in front of her face.
And then the Dark Lord returned. More rooms of the Manor became off-limits. Draco sneaked around to watch how his aunt and uncle tortured Muggles and blood traitors. He watched through keyholes to see the Dark Lord praise his father for his inventions.
We got to spend the night in the Great Hall while the Professors searched the castle. Headmaster Dumbledore waved his wand around to clear the Hall of all the tables and make purple sleeping bags appear. The colour of the sleeping bags lightened the mood a little when Blaise joked that Dumbledore was as gay as they get with his love for purple. We all crammed together in a corner (we is Blaise, Greg, Daphne, Luna, Hermione, Draco and I) and wondered how Black had gotten into the castle. Which turned into a lesson from Hermione about how the castle was protected and you can’t apparate in. And then Draco wondered out loud why Black had gone for Gryffindor Tower when it was Harry he wanted to kill. Well, you can imagine that this was a shock to all our other friends and we had to explain to them that I had overheard the Tonks family when they had a fight about telling me or not. We think that maybe Black thinks I’m in Gryffindor since both of my parents were in Gryffindor. That it was a mistake on his part.
Rookwood gives Draco a dark look. He’s still upset that Draco took his place around the table. Draco is sure that Rookwood would kill him if he knew he would get away with it.
Andromeda holds a cup of tea in front of Draco. Draco stares at it and shakes his head. He doesn’t think he can drink anything right now.
“Hey little monster,” Draco says as he takes the boy from his mother and holds him close. “Have you missed me?” he asks. Vincent nods and then rest his head against Draco’s shoulder and almost falls asleep instantly.
Malfoy laughs silently and shakes his head. He takes his homework back out of his bag and Harry opens up the potions book Malfoy wants him to read. When he’s read the first two chapters, he takes out his homework. His Potions homework is hell, and Harry asks Malfoy for his help. Malfoy shows him where he can find the information he needs. He doesn’t give Harry any straight answers but makes him work for it. Harry hates this, but also finds it adorable. Malfoy wants Harry to learn things for himself. It is something Uncle Remus would do. And that is a good thing, isn’t it? Because if Malfoy is a little like Uncle Remus, he might not be grossed out by the fact that Harry kind of wants to hold Malfoy’s hand.
‘Sirius is kind,’ Malfoy writes when Harry doesn’t respond. ‘He asked me a lot of questions about the family. He said I can always write to him if I want to talk to someone who understands what it’s like to not hear.’
“I’m sure he will explain. Now hurry up, we don’t have all day,” the professor snaps. It seems he’s in a bad mood again and even though Draco wants to ask a million more questions, he knows when to keep his mouth shut around his head of house.
I know Snape and Pettigrew had a small duel, Hermione told me, but I didn’t see it. I was too focused on checking if Draco was still alive. I was so scared at that moment. I thought I lost him. And I didn’t even say sorry to him for punching him in the stomach and all. But he was still breathing, unconscious, but breathing. I had to tell myself that, over and over again.
The toaster pings and Harry looks back at his stale bread. Now toasted and warm. He almost burns his fingers while he drops them on his plate. He picks up his knife and looks at the butter. The fancy stuff, not the cheap butter Harry prefers. A small reminder that he’s not supposed to be here alone.
Draco nods and takes a deep breath. “I think I need to,” he says. Without thinking about it, he lifts the bottle to his mouth and swallows the contents. “Fuck, they could have made it taste a little nicer,” he comments. Harry doesn’t respond. Draco looks at him. A tear travels slowly from the corner of Harry’s eye down his cheek. It hangs at his chin for a couple of seconds before it falls. When another tear escapes Harry’s eye, Draco lifts his hand to wipe it from his cheek. Harry turns to look at Draco, and he tries to smile.
Harry smiles. His heart beats in his throat. Draco doesn’t want him to die. Because he calls Harry his best friend. The smile falls from his face. Harry is just Draco’s best friend. Harry can’t tell him what he feels for Draco. It will ruin their friendship. Draco just said it. They are just best friends. Nothing more and nothing less. Harry is gay and falling for a straight boy. But he’s gay. There’s no doubt about that. Harry has known for a while, but now he’s a hundred percent sure. Because his heart has just shattered into a million pieces. He’s only Draco’s best friend.
“Look,” Draco said, “I’ll make you a deal; you tell me why you’re hiding in the bathroom at midnight and I’ll tell you why I am.”
The chosen boy tried so hard to keep his secret, but it came crashing down like Harry always knew it would. No secret can hold forever.
Without thinking, Harry banged his fist against his head, muffling the frustration he felt. “why are you even fucking here?”
“do you remember when I got it?” the other boy said out of the blue. “I have never seen you… you angrier.”
he could feel Draco inhale, the other boy staring at him with such an intensity Harry was afraid he was going to hex him.
As soon as his lips were there, they were gone, and Draco was scrambling to the other side of the bath. “I – Shit – uh.”
“I’m a lot of things,” Draco reached out and tugged at one of Harry’s curls, the other boy didn’t like how his touch stung, “I’m not a liar.”
Harry thought of everyone he loved, everyone who took him in even though they knew who he was – what could happen to them just for caring for him. Harry pounded his fist against his head. If he fails, they’ll die.
Harry tried to remember the boy before him was his enemy, that hours ago he thought Draco was evil, pure cartoonishly evil. The chosen boy was rethinking all he knew about the death eater in front of him. Death eater? He was not like one of them; he was afraid. He was just a teenager – just like Harry was.
He knew why he couldn’t sleep, even if he was trying to ignore it as best as possible. His scar throbbed. Proof of his connection to a monster that was still out there – that was rebuilding his army. When his scar ached, it sent his mind and body into a panic.
Harry shot out of the water, whipping his eyes to see Draco standing in front of the bath staring at him as if he’d grown a second head. The chosen boy pated his shoulder; no, still just one.
There are somethings in life we cannot escape; heartache is one of them. And heartache had a way of fallowing Harry through life like a ghost. No matter how far he ran, no matter how hard he fought – Harry Potter was haunted. And nothing haunted him quite like Draco Malfoy.
“so, it really should be ‘happy valentine’s day, let’s kill a priest.” Draco threw his arms in the air.
well,” the former chosen one said, “the origins of valentine’s day are a bit too… mature… for a bunch of 9-year olds.”
The kissing soon turned into scattered pecks in between breaths, Draco pressing his mouth against Harry’s neck.
Draco rushed forward, pressing one hand to Harry’s mouth, the other on the back of his head. “have you lost your mind?”
“Do you want to be forgiven?” the thought had never crossed the chosen boy's mind, that this person he had built up in his mind as everything he hated – wanted to be good.
“will you – uh – will you be my valentine?” Draco couldn’t breathe. Wait, shit, he really wasn’t breathing.
Draco resting his head in his hand, listening to his dork roommate ramble about things Draco didn’t know anything about with such enthusiasm it made the blonde want to learn.
The Slytherin stared at him for a second, and for the life of him, Harry couldn’t see what was going on behind the grey. Without warning, Draco stripped his shirt off.
The two boys avoided each other for weeks after that, and the chosen boy almost preferred it that way, no matter how strange it felt. Harry waited for Draco to tell the whole school what happened in the hallway, too mock him, too sneer at him. It never came, though; Draco didn’t seem to acknowledge the fact that Harry existed at all. The chosen boy didn’t know how to feel about that. For so long he wanted Draco to just leave him alone, even if in the back of his mind he reveled in the attention he got from the other boy. But now, Draco’s eyes on him, Harry felt wrong – like a part of his world had crumbled away overnight.
“it doesn’t matter anymore now,” Harry whispered, without thinking pulled Draco closer, “what we did doesn’t matter anymore.”
Draco waded over to where Harry was, kneeling so all the chosen one could see was him, “so I won’t be cruel this time.”
“I should have known this was a fucking bad idea,” Draco looked at him like he was nothing, and at that moment, Harry believed it. “and it’s over.”
Harry pulled himself so he was sitting in Draco’s lap, trading his grip on the bath for gripping the other’s shoulders.
Harry looked at the other boy, who was only wearing a t-shirt and pajama bottoms – with his arms exposed the chosen one could clearly see his mark. A tattoo on his forearm that proved who he belonged to, who he was loyal to.
Draco nodded, closing the space so their foreheads were pressed together. Harry sucked in a breath, becoming to acutely aware of how long it had been since the two boys had been properly close to one another.
“Don’t,” Draco said, “don’t act like you fucking know me because we use to kiss when we were silly little kids.”
Harry chucked a paper bag into a pile of identical paper bags, reaching for glitter. “well, the kids love it. It's basically an excuse to eat candy for them.”
Until one night when Harry was sneaking out to get some air. The weeks of Draco’s silence was getting to him, and no matter how much he didn’t want to admit it, he missed Draco’s annoying presence every day.
Draco had cornered him in an abandoned hallway and shoved him against a wall, wand pointed at him. His goons weren’t with him for once, the two nemeses were alone. Harry hated being alone with him, when they were alone, he couldn’t focus on anything else besides the blonde – the blonde who had murder in his eyes.
Draco pulled away, and the chosen boy felt triumph in the way his voice shook a bit, “we were stupid to do this.”
He couldn’t think, so out of instinct he slammed his lips against the other boys, ignoring how Draco’s wand pressed into the vein in his neck. Harry didn’t know how long their lips touched. a second? Maybe two? Before Draco pushed him away, a look of shock on his face.
Harry dug his nails into his skin, grounding himself with the pain. He wasn’t a soldier, he knew that, he was just a kid.
Once again Draco found him in an abandoned hallway; It felt all too familiar when Draco pushed him up against the wall, but instead of pressing his wand to the chosen one’s neck, he pressed his mouth against Harry's.
“figured it’s the polite thing to do,” Harry said, pushing his glass forward to let the bartender fill it up. “neither of us needs a reminder.”
the two had moved into a tiny old two-bedroom after Harry had finished university, though it had worked in both of their favors financially, Draco was starting to see the holes in their living arrangement. When Draco doesn’t hate Harry, he rather fancies him.
Harry dragged himself so he was sitting up, rubbing his eyes. He was trying to stay calm, but all of that was thrown out the window when harry twisted his head and saw a piece of paper placed delicately where Draco had been the night before.
Harry didn’t give him a chance to find his thoughts, chasing after him only to stop short of pressing his chest to Draco’s. he didn’t know what he was doing, he wasn’t thinking. “is it okay if I -?”
Draco dipped his arms under the water, crossing them, and floating back so he was leaning against the other side of the tub.
Harry leaned forward too, to the point their noses were brushing, “and yet you don’t let me tell you who you are.”
Harry tilted his face to the ceiling and groaned, “no, no. a valentine is like a significant other, or like someone you like. Someone you feel romantically towards.”
He didn’t know when Harry had gotten so into the history of muggles; maybe he just like stories, or maybe he just liked to know it wasn’t only their world that could be torn apart by wars. But the fascination had turned into a love affair. When the two boy’s friendship was first developing, Harry would run to the three broomsticks, where Draco had bartended when he left the Malfoy money, to tell him about whatever lesson he had learned that day.
Draco Malfoy. Harry’s first crush, whether his adolescent mind was willing to admit it at the time or not. He was snarky, sarcastic, and far too dramatic for young harry to deal with – and he was all the teen thought about at night.
The chosen boy floated forward, placing his hands on the edge of the bath so Draco was trapped between his arms; and before he lost his nerve, he swooped his mouth down to Draco’s. he could feel the blonde hesitating, fearing. He pushed his mouth against his harder, prodding at his lips with his tongue until Draco opened up, kissing back with the same force.
“I didn’t –“ harry wiped his palm over his face, trying to articulate himself. “I don’t think we’re doing anything, Draco. I just thought maybe we weren’t enemies anymore.”
“Mr. Weasley please bring yourself and Mr. Longbottom back to the living room so these boys and Mr. Longbottom may apologize to each other,” the most hated man in all of the wizarding world called causing a growl to escape from my lips. How dare that bastard!
“It could be from the stress of the tournament,” Dumbledore stated as he stalked over to the blonde Lord, “or he is simply faking once more; he is after all an attention seeker.”
“G-Gran?’ I stuttered and moved away from my mate towards the woman who had raised me. After coming into my inheritance our relationship had drastically changed. No longer did she see me as my dad, and accepted the fact that I was sensitive to things in a far different way. I also learned more of my legacy as a submissive day walker.
“What do you need Severus?” I asked as I noticed the three Ravenclaws sitting in front of Percy and Oliver. Percy was giving them and disappointed look while Oliver was flat out glaring at them as if they were dirt, which they were. “WHAT THE FUCK!”
“Then why are you still here?” Ron snapped harshly. I just sighed and pulled Seamus and Colin out of the abandon class room. Colin was still shaking from being held at wand point by the smartest witch of our age.
“Simple; he deserves it. Now do you know what you have to do?” Hermione asked wickedly, her eyes darkening slightly. We just nodded our heads not seeing a sense in talking with her any longer.
“I guess I can forgive you; I mean a Veela always protects their mate,” Draco drawled, and I was shocked. Not many people knew about Dean and me.
“Very well wait here,” Snape stated as he slipped into the great hall leaving me standing in the corridor feeling very awkwardly.
“Come over here Mr. Creevey,” Snape said softly, shock not only Dean and I but Professor McGonagall. Colin took a shaken breath before going over to the Potions master. Said master whispered something to Colin before placing his wand at the boys’ temple, drawing out a silver strand, and placing it in a Pensieve. “Minerva if you please.”  The woman went over and together the professors both went into the memory.
‘They don’t need me’ I thought sadly as I headed towards the Gryffindor common room. The common room was almost empty, but couldn’t care I just rushed up to the third year dormitories. ‘You’re just a problem. You’re ugly. Talentless. Pathetic. Stupid. DIE,’ the negative thoughts just kept coming as I ran into the dorm bathrooms. I went straight to the vanity shelves and reached behind the soap to pull out and small razor. I pressed them tiny piece of sharp metal to my wrist trying my hardest to relieve the heart ache I was feeling until my wrist were a torn apart mess. Sinking down to the floor I began sobbing because of the pain and because of my guilt.
“Calm down blue eyes,” Dean stated; I had become so concerned with the Ron situation that I barely noticed them as I had noticed that an older red head male going behind Ron and grabbing the younger red heads wand.
“T-Thank you!” I exclaimed jumping in Regulus’ arms.  His arms were like my safe haven, and I could stay there forever, but sadly Regulus pulled away and offered me his hand. I gently placed my own smaller one in his large strong hand, and a bright light surrounded us. I closed my eyes as I felt a slight pull on my naval. A chuckle caused me to open my eyes to see that we were in the Hogwarts court yard, and it was night.
“Well I was talking with Viktor Krum and he mentioned that he had Nymph blood, but that’s not the interesting part.  He mentioned that his blood called to one of the twins!” Seamus stated rather excited, and all while he was talking Lee’s face kept getting redder.
“Don’t worry love Ced already explained what Lee said to you so I am not mad at you,” George stated grabbing my hand to place a soft kiss on my palm; causing my knees to go weak.
“B-But they are traitors; they sided with that disgrace of a Gryffindor! I was only doing the right thing,” Ron yelled as he swiped for his wand. Charlie just sighed and grabbed Ron’s arm dragging him out of the hall.
“B-Blaise Zabini,” Blaise stuttered cutely. The boy was just so precious; how anyone could hurt him is beyond me.
“I swear on my magic that I will always protect you and stand by your side,” with Oliver’s stated meant a dull glow surrounded him sealing his claim.
The three Ravenclaw boys, who up until now had been silent on the couch, decided that they had been ignored for long enough. The short blond, who had instigated the original assault, stood up. This caught my eye as an insult to lady Longbottom’s position. The boy sauntered over and without being addressed stated, “Lady Longbottom allow me to express my sincerest apologies for the incident, and all me to offer up the first challis of friendship with your grandson.”
“Harry!” a heavily accented voice called. Turning around I found Viktor running towards me. I took off sprinting towards my fellow Submissive and crashed into him my arms wrapping around his neck. Viktor’s arms wrapped around me, both of us breathing heavily. “I am so glad I found you. The cup, I found it, but it has the same magic signature as a portkey…”
“B-but surely there is someone more qualifies?” I argued how I could become a teacher when I had no experience.
I smiled and hugged Percy tightly. Out of all my brothers Percy was the one I was most protective of. He was probably the most delicate out of all of us as well he was very prone to sickness. “Hey little one,” I whispered softly.
“Percy!” Charlie yelled as he and George came running into the apartment, with Fred in Charlie’s arms, causing both Oliver and myself to jump.
“Correct you idiot, what the hell were you thinking trying to hex your own brother?” Charlie questioned.
Regulus had been a perfect gentleman. I had been with him since the night before and I had been what could only be called as extremely pampered. It was so different to be treated so kindly, after so many years of protecting myself it felt nice to be able to rely on someone without fear of betrayal.
“Hello Professor, I am sorry about the yelling but you were scaring m mate,” Regulus explained as he pulled Blaise into his arms, “now then what is going on here?”
“I accept your terms Sir Godric and I accept Lady Sprout as my headmistress,” the glowing woman stated her voice soft like a chime, before disappearing. The great hall was completely silent; and I was having a hard time believing what had just happened. Was Dumbledore truly gone?
“Hey George we got a letter from Percy,” I called as my twin entered the room with Charlie. It sounds odd but I was comfortable and uncomfortable with the presence of the two dominations even though I knew neither would hurt me. I had come into my inheritance the previous summer and without another submissive in the house it was hard to adjust.  Sure George compensated, but without Percy I had no example to follow. I was just left out to dry as our own mother doesn’t believe that we have creature inheritance as she thinks we are lying and so I Charlie, Bill, and Percy.
I giggled as Ollie kissed the top of my nose. We had just gotten back from a crisp stroll around the Hogwarts grounds. This was what I had missed about being with Ollie. He always tried to make me feel special and never forced me to be something I am not. He accepted that I was an introverted person and that it caused me to shy away from the spot light. He comforted me when work got to stressful, and simply held me to be close. With him I never had to be something I wasn’t.
Snape lead us up to a room by the Gryffindor tower. He simply told us the password and left with a flourish of his robes.
“He was spouting some nonsense about Fred fraternizing with the enemy and a bunch if other derogatory names,” George growled and I tightened my hold on the shaken submissive.
“Can’t believe Potter tricked the goblet,” Crab said in aww of what had just happened. The great hall was filled with many different whispers; some wondering what had just happened and others complaining about my mate and claiming him a cheater.
Oliver: Dominate wood elf who is going to be mated to Percy. Due to meddling from Dumbledore, Molly, and Penelope they were broken up.
“Stop don’t hurt him!” I shouted as the large man pulled back his other arm preparing to harm the kid. Even though he was always bullying me and tormenting me I couldn’t let him be hurt.
“I u-umm wanted t-to see w-what all the noise w-was,” I stuttered looking down at my feet ashamed that I had interfered without thinking.  How could I be so careless?
I sighed as I watch Luna ski[ off to the lake, her blonde hair bouncing as she went. I loved her cheerful disposition on life. No matter how much the raven claws bullied her she never stopped smiling. It simply took my breathe away to find an innocent soul going through llife smiling, but it also hurt to know that I can’t have her.
“Why these boys have explained what had happened and are willing to apologize if Mr. Longbottom will apologize first,” Dumbledore stated calmly.
“Harry, are you going to be alright?” Blaise asked. Nothing seemed to work as Harry’s body has finally shut down from stress of the day’s events.
“Calm down the headmaster has decided that their punishment is simply for them to apologize to each other. I am sorry Charlie there was nothing I could do,” Severus snapped as he pulled me over to the unwanted guests. I glared at the boys as I was forced to sit beside my brother. How could their only punishment be to apologize, it was because of them that my mate was in a healing sleep. The only positive I could take from the situation is that the blonde little shit was covered in bandages.
“Ah so you caught that. Yes I am a dark elf. My people, elfling, do not normally join wizard society. However I was raised by muggles in an orphanage, so I am more integrated into this world. Tell me Harry what kind of elf are you?” I asked genuinely curious.
“Promise me next time you will come find one of us next time and we will talk you through it,” I stated sadly.
I was sitting with my house mates in the common room waiting for information on my mate who had been taken by my father to see our family’s healer. “Are you going to be alright Draco?” Goyle asked.
“I know love, but you must stay strong for me,” I whisper as I gently pull him into my lap, and start to feed my weakened mate, “I promise we will get out of here.”
“Why are you guys doing this?” Colin asked sadly. It was a question we all wanted the answers to. Harry was such kind heart who had accepted us immediately, and it just did not feel right to hurt him.
I sighed carefully massaged my shoulders. We were in my room aboard the ship, and my wonderful amte decided to treat me to a relaxing massage. It was the first time in two weeks that we had time to be together. Between Georges classes, and my schooling we had little time to spare.
“Ric I feel dizzy,” Salazar whispered as one of the merpeople that was guarding our prison brought us food. Salazar my only light had in the last couple decades begun to weaken. He lost weight, his once beautiful silver wings had lost their glow as well as feathers had begun to fall out, and he was barely able to move most days. Unfortunately we were immortal and the only things that would end our suffering was our hearts being ripped from out chests and burned.
“Come Wormtail!” the new man shouted as Peter Pettigrew came forward with a shrivelled body. My curiosity doubled as Pettigrew placed the body on the ground and a large cauldron came into view.
“Hello Neville, are you feeling alright?” Augusta Longbottom asked softly as she pulled my into a tight hug. A safe and familiar warmth surrounded me allowing me to relax slightly, not completely though, but enough that some of the tension left my body.
“Come on Harry,” I said pulling the shaken boy towards the doors of the great hall. Said boy gave a weak protested as I directed him towards the belly of the harsh Hogwarts gossip.
As I kissed my mate I noticed a bright light surrounding us. Neville didn’t seem to realise this, but I certainly did. It seems that magic itself had just blessed our bond. Pulling away from the younger boy I had to smile. Neville was completely flustered as he gave me a shy smile. “See you are special,” I whispered softly as someone knocked on the locked door.
I smiled as Harry hugged Colin. No matter what the situation Harry always seemed to be ready to forgive; it was almost his mortal fault. It warmed my heart as I stated, “we are really sorry for what happened Harry; we wouldn’t have done it if Colin wasn’t in danger.”
“Who do you think it will be Draco?” Blaise asked, but before I could answer Dumbledore yelled in anger.
“I don’t know my sweet little dragon; I just don’t know,” Oliver siad as he continued rubbing my back. Until I subcame to a restless sleep.
“Now that we are all here how ‘bout we get started,” Ron sneered as he sat on one of the old rickety desks, “you two are going to help me with a little project.”
“Of course he knew; he tried to talk Percy out of it, but Percy wanted to protect him.” I said sadly. Charlie and George looked at each other in shock. Obviously sadden by Percy’s sacrifice.
“ENOUGH!” I roared lifted Lee Jordan off the ground. That was the last straw calling my brother a slut, “You will shut up and listen! I will not just sit here and allow you to insult my baby brother anymore. All he has done is be your friend and yet you belittle him and call him derogatory names, this is not going to flying with me!”
Dumbledore: Was bonded to Grindelwald, and because he was the one to defeat him he has lost most of his mental capacity to grief. He is currently responsible for all the stress and abuse that has been placed on Harry.
“I do not care zat you t’ink he is lying we can proceed with’ out hiz magic guardian!” Maxine yelled in anger as three people came and joined the group; one of them obviously very shaken.
“Well, well look what we have here,” a gravelly voice stated as a freezing cold hand on my shoulder pushed me to the ground, ripping my shirt. How could I have been so stupid as to let my guard down around the forbidden forest, “I think I can have some fun before I spill your guts, especially since you have such a delicious body! It would be a waste not to indulge myself.”
“Really? What does it say?” George asked as I held up the letter to them. Charlie grabbed it as it was unopened due to dragon submissive culture. Until I found mate my older dominant brothers were in charge of my safety and protection. That meant that anything that I was unsure of was dealt by them.
“Seamus, are you alright?” Colin asked softly causing me to look over at my two mates. Dean and Colin were my world and I was extremely protective of them. Dean and I are the dominants in our relationship, and with both of us being veela’s it made for an interesting sight. Colin only stood 4’2; which made him look even smaller when he was between Dean who was 5’6 and I who stood 5’8. Both of us carried so much for our smaller mate.
“FRED!” Lee shouted as he came running towards me, his face as red as my hair, “Why the fuck are you talking to Viktor Krum!”
Regulus Arcturus Black: dark Phoenix. Was killed by Voldemort, but do to his Phoenix blood he was able to be reborn as only a natural death can kill him.
I felt fire burn through my veins as I tried to move. I had successfully gotten out of the soft bed I had been resting in, and I was just about out of the bedroom door. The scent of my mate was just out of the bedroom and all my instincts were telling me to find him.
Percy: Submissive dragon inheritance was to be mated to Oliver but medalling from his mother, Penelope, and Dumbledore prevented him from doing so. Will once again be mated to Oliver.
“Now headmaster what seems to be the problem?” Lucius inquired as he laid a gentle hand on Harry’s shoulder, giving the shaken boy a soft smile.
Cedric: Hogwarts champion and Harry’s adoptive brother. He is also a wood elf and has adopted Harry and helped him through his inheritance.
“Come on Draco we should get this over with as soon as possible,” Cedric stated as he pushed the door to the great hall open and entered the deafeningly silent room. The rest of us followed as he led us over to the snakes’ side of the room where the delegation from Durmstrang was eating. The whispers of cheating came prominently for the Gryffindor side.
My mate gasped as he looked up at me before cringing. Looking past his beautiful eyes I noticed the shadowed figure had entered the boy with one of his filthy fingers. The bastard flashed me a smirk and said, “Now why would I do that when he is one of the tightest sluts I have ever met! I bet he will moan beautifully!”
“I am sure that he will wake up soon love and we will be here when he does,” I said softly as I took Seamus’ hand in my own. Giving him as much comfort as I could in the situation.
The moment Dumbledore entered the apartment I knew that there would be trouble. Snape had already left to talk to Neville’s grandmother about the incident so that left me and Oliver to deal with both Dumbledore and the Ravenclaw students.
“Do you  like that little Dragon?” Oliver whispered as he licked the shell of my ear. I shuddered and a little whimper left my lips. We hadn’t been intimate since our seventh year, and the notion scared me but comforted me to know Ollie still wanted me in that sense.
“So that’s why you are so protective of Harry; you’re his mate,” Dean stated proudly, causing me to chuckle.
“do you like thaat love?” George whispered as he pressed against the knot in my back, casuing to let out soft moans. George chuckled at my response and continued too massage that spot.
“Dean, Colin! Guess what!” Seamus shouted as he came sprinting towards Dean, Lee, and myself. We had been talking about Harry’s performance and the first task in general, but Seamus’ shouting caused us all to freeze and look at him.
“Where so you think Harry is?” I asked my twin on the way down to breakfast. We were walking with Dean, Seamus, Colin, Ron, and Hermione and they all seemed to be shocked by my question; at least Ron and Hermione were.
“No Seamus it is not your fault. We are both to blame, so don’t go putting all this guilt onto yourself.”
Percy: Submissive dragon inheritance was to be mated to Oliver but medalling from his mother, Penelope, and Dumbledore prevented him from doing so. Will once again be mated to Oliver.
“Get bent you fucking prude!” Seamus snapped as he and Dean pulled me to the third year boys dormitory. Grangers words forgotten as they tenderly made love to me.
“Draco, Harry! Wait up!” Cedric called as he came running towards us; the other champions following closely behind.
“w-welcome back m-my lord,” Wormtail stutter and I shot him a look of disgust. Out of all my followers he was the one I hated the most.
FinallyHarry and Cedric had been shuffled down to the Slytherin common rooms where they were finally allowed to break down. Harry had curled up on my lap, and was cryign softly as I rubbed circles on his back. Cedric was next to us stairing at the fire with a blamk expression.
Cedric whispered; it calmed me down to hear that coming from the man that had become my adoptive brother. Without his help getting my inheritance would have been a very painful ordeal. When a person who has elven blood comes into their inheritance the cells in their body are re-arranged to accommodate the changes need for the new organs and bone structure. The process is unbearable alone. And since the parents usually help the elfling threw it, and I don’t have any parents; so Cedric stepped up and helped me through the whole process.
“And the finally the champion of Hogwarts is… Cedric Diggory!” Dumbledore called and brought me back to reality. The Hufflepuff’s were going crazy as Cedric made his way up to the front of the great hall, shook Dumbledore’s hand, and made his way into the room with the other three champions. “Our three champions have now been selec...” Dumbledore started but was cut off as the goblet of fire suddenly began to shoot out red flames.
“I cannot BELIEVE that the two of you would attack your fellow house mate!” Our head of house screeched and my mate cringed at the sound of it.
All I felt was chilling cold surrounding my body. I had no ability to even open my eyes to see my surroundings. The last thing I remember was my godfather asking to speak with me; then nothing. Suddenly I could feel arms pulling me up, and as we reached the surface my abilities began returning. As we broke the surface, of what I finally realised was water, my vison returned. Coming face to face with a terrified Harry was not pleasing. I only got to look at him for a few seconds before he dived back under. Looking at the stands I realised why; Fleur was on the dock, her arm injured, as she stood standing on the dock in fear. She hadn’t been able to rescue her hostage.
“E-Elf…” the boy stuttered as I froze. An elf, but that would mean one of his parents had elf blood or was an elf themselves. It was one of the worst offences in the magical world to kill an elf, a being of complete purity. Snapping my fingers the boy was released as he fell into my arms; he squirmed slightly but still and tensed.
“Sorry little one, that man just pushes the wrong buttons!” I growled, but once I saw my mates face I calmed, “but I am not mad at you I am angry at Albus Dumbledore’s holier than thou view on the world and how he places blame on those that are innocent. I refuse to allow you to take that blame for those idiots.”
“S-Seamus a-AHH!” Colin nearly screamed as I latched onto his pulse point. Seamus smirked at me before taking Colin’s prick into his mouth.
“Well now that everyone is all caught up I would appreciate if you would all follow me,” Snape said from behind Percy cause the shaken man to jump.
“WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU YELLING AT HIM? HAVEN’T YOU DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE!” I roared grabbing Lee by his collar. Lee gave a squeak, but didn’t struggle he just cast his eyes down in shame.
“Look we do not want trouble; all we want to do is apologize for what happened,” Dean stated. He did look, but it was probably because they had been caught.
I was shocked. Colin was protecting us, the people that were supposed to ensure that nothing bad ever happened to him. Even though he was shaking and stuttering he was still trying to protect us; even going as far as to offer up his memory.
“Stupify!” Cedric bellowed as a flash of light left his wand and struck Viktor in the chest sending the Bulgarian flying back unconscious.
“I know, come we must find Cedric before it is too late,” Viktor states as we both begin running again eventually ending up near the cup again. Beside the cup was Cedric a dazed and confused look on his face.
I was seething. How dare Clearwater abuse my Percy!  After all she had taken from him hurt him. I was going to kill her once I got my hands on her. “Don’t worry Percy I am coming.”
“Yes I have done enough damage to your life and you need your Godfather.” Voldemort patted the boy’s hair before levitating both Wormtail and the cup closer. Harry shot the red eyed man a soft shy smile, before grabbing Wormtails coat firmly and touching the cup. The two disappeared from the graveyard and only Voldemort was left standing there. He turned and looked at his father’s grave before smiling, “you have gained an ally today, and I swear on magic herself to guide and protect you elfling.”
