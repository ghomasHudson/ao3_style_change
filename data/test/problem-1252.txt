“I wouldn’t mind some tea. The boys can all have a fizzy drink. Viktor won’t mind if they’re spoiled”
“It’s more than it just being about the help, Draco,” Lucius responded, his voice neutral as a professor teaching the dullest subject on earth.
It spooked him a bit, to make the connection, but this served only to thwart any protest he might have had to Narcissa’s massive, heaping helpings.
Frank Grinned, “We have one rule here at Grande Giro Pizza. Other than all the normal rules, but if a customer doesn’t pick up their pizza. We don’t let it go to waste” Draco raised an eyebrow, alright perhaps there were other reasons why they were struggling to find staff.
Jacinder smiled and kissed Draco once more and slipped a piece of paper into his pocket. “Address. You’ll need that.”
Draco felt his shoulders drop. He turned to his secret lover. “I figured you’d turn up here” He smiled. That smile, the gap in his teeth, his dark curly hair, that beautiful tanned complexion. It was a combination that made him swoon.
Harry dressed in elegant robes that probably cost as much as a year’s worth of rent at his cousin’s flat. Or even as much as the Dursley’s whole mortgage. He couldn’t know for sure - but despite the impeccable tailoring, he felt like it was all a trifle too large.
“Cool,” Dudley nodded and switched it off. Harry had barely touched breakfast as usual. But didn’t bring it up. “See you tonight then.”
She turned sideways and Draco watched as she puffed and squeezed through the doorway. She really was utterly enormous, he wondered what on earth Viktor Krum had going for him to let herself into this state. Draco stepped back as she lumbered slowly, her thick thighs barely bending as she waddled.
A surrogate. Draco nodded slightly relieved, but equally annoyed Harry hadn’t mentioned that. At the back of his mind, he knew this meant he would have to swap with Harry once again. “Of course. I suppose it’s a good Viktor adores you…”
The resulting silence in the conversation was painful. Harry added, just as filler, since why would Draco give a shit…. “I didn’t try to date him or anything. I just wanted him to know. It felt… immoral not to tell him, when I couldn’t get him out of my mind. I was hoping we could have a laugh and carry on as usual. Or at least that it would blow over and we would be able to move forward as friends. But instead he went and ran out and married Lavender Brown. I suppose it scared him - like being gay is catching? Perhaps he actually thinks that. I hope not. But such a reaction… I thought I meant more to him.”
Ok the Rondwandelen concept is 100% artistic license and I took inspiration from the Amish Rumspringa.
“Goodbye,” Lucius said, staring his son down with a grim smile. “Do not cast a shadow on these grounds again until a year has passed, son.” Then Draco watched incredulously as his father turned his back against the manor gates and walked slowly up the path.
Lucius clucked his tongue but ignored the bait. The boy was far too simple, Lucius thought. Too passionate, too plebeian, too loyal to someone outside the family. It would have been distressing if it didn’t feel like the nipping of a year-old hound.
Draco sat down in the chair and spread his legs and leaned back like he didn’t care. Scratching his balls. “So?” Draco said attempting to look gormless.
“Well” Draco smiled and removed two large opaque wine bottles. “Deposit some of your hair into it and give it a shake. I have prepared mine already” Draco said handing it over to Harry.
“Please Granger or is it Krum now? Never mind. But that would explain some of your weight certainly, but not quite the excess.”
"Yes, master," Dorky acquiesced, and whisked away to prepare the small suitcase of sundry items for the traditional Malfoy gap year.
“Trippy,” Harry murmured, and began to look down at his body, helpless but to look it over with wonder.
Narcissa seemed to realize her mistake, and she deflated a bit. “I only want you to be happy, my child,” she summed up sadly. “And for what it is worth - I am your mother. I know you, my sweet boy.”
It took the better part of thirty seconds to get the bite in his mouth. But he allowed himself the luxury of tasting it - and scrutinizing the magnificent pride and joy in Narcissa’s eyes as she watched him. He swallowed, and she clapped with apparent glee. “Yes, now isn’t that delicious?”
“Well, you were in Bulgaria, I suspect having Weasley reject him and cut him off might not have helped his mental state” Draco guessed. “Not that I can judge” he leaned over mostly so Hermione’s children didn’t overhear him. “But I do have one question, what in Merlin’s name happened to you. You're well…”
Dudley noticed Harry would often look at his belly. When he ate or drank or got dressed. He probably should have told him to knock it off, but it was harmless. “I’m cooking pasta”
“That’s not a bad thing, have fun and don’t get attached” Dudley smiled. “Your Gay, no one dates anyone long term. Even a year is like five in gay years.”
Draco stared at the tall council towers and sighed. “Merlin Potter, how the mighty have fallen. Although I ought not to refer to myself in third person.”
The bathroom was dimly lit, but functional. Draco began immediately to unbutton his shirt, and Harry’s voice caught in his chest. He opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say.
Despite all the Malfoy related frustration Harry expressed to Ron and Hermione, to a significant extent Harry had carried a torch for the other boy for years. The dreams Harry had about Draco started in his fourth year, and there were dreams that made Harry blush in Desperate embarrassment. Fortunately no one was the wiser, even Snape did not catch an inkling in their horrid Occulmency lessons.
And Draco had a polyjuice potion variant he had worked on with Uncle Severus (rest the poor bloke’s soul) that permitted its user to have a permanent mask for the entire time patient took a regular dose of potion as a capsule one time per day. It was one of Uncle Severus’ strategies to possibly hide Draco in plain sight should the need arise.
Dudley hadn’t expected Harry to walk back into his life. Being told you need to flee and going to hiding, he didn’t expect to see Harry again. But when he turned up on the doorstep of his council flat in east London. Dudley couldn’t say no.
Harry snorted, feeling beleaguered and hollow. He had been waiting to tell someone the story for ages, and sadly Draco was the first one to actually ask, however casually, how Harry was doing. And so Harry told his formal nemesis, despite his best judgment. “More like miserable and in love with my best mate, who I haven’t seen in six months since I told him I was queer.”
Honestly why was breaking up with someone so hard. Draco had in the end said he was going to stay with his mother and it would be difficult to see him.
“Here,” Draco said putting his hand on her back the other on her hugely soft stomach as he helped her to the couch. “How was Bulgaria?”
Apparently, the film looked great, particularly the part when Dudley had measured Draco’s or Harry’s belly in actuality with a tape measure. Dudley had spent a few hours edited and putting the strangest music on it. But apparently, he already had customers sending emails insisting they’ll send a VHS in. Which good for him, Draco supposed.
He also didn’t quite know what to do. Potter had agreed to switch bodies and now what. What to do, find a new job. Draco had no interest in spending long days walking around with no shirt. Or prostitute himself as Harry had implied.
He left the bathroom and slipped the piece of paper from my upper pocket. There was address written on it and the closest train station.
“There we are, my sweet lad,” Narcissa murmured, and proffered his napkin. “Oh, my poor child. Your exposure to the outside world has traumatized you so much that you forget your manners.”
Hermione Granger stood there with her arms crossed looking unimpressed. “Hello Harry,” she said firmly.
Harry shrugged. “Judge me all you want. I have spent the past several months just trying to feel some semblance of human compassion. If you agree to do this switching up thing with me, you are completely welcome to improve my life in whatever ways you see fit.”
"It's different, my love," Narcissa entreated, folding in on herself sadly. "Your father did heinous things. You
“Conditionally,” Harry said, and swallowed firmly. “I need to get back to the lads, though. I would hate to interrupt their artistic process mid-way through.”
Now? Well, Draco rather figured the process could enable some other poor kid to live the life of a caged Draco Malfoy,  at least for a few  months. Anybody would want a taste of Draco’s extravagant life, right?
“That is right because your greedy. Harry’s body aches for food and you’re giving into it aren’t you” Dudley asked. “You’re going to eat everything I give you”
Harry mused over what Draco might mean and wondered if perhaps Draco had mistaken him for a metamorphagus.
Draco - or Draco in Harry’s body - was a little rubbish. For a start he could barely see his own feet without Potters glasses on.
“That was then,” Lucius grit out, his sneer itching to deepen far beyond a noble degree. “This is now. And sleeping with the help has rendered you a *disgrace,* boy.”
No, Lucius reflected, it was long since time that Draco grew up a bit. The family tradition would be carried out, regardless of Narcissa’s criticism that the practice was cruel on multiple levels. No, Lucius decided - the former Malfoy men were right to insist on the tradition, and Luciusshould never have doubted their wisdom. A boy needs to be cut loose from their mother’s apron string eventually…. *traumatized* or not.  Narcissus was bleating on like a lamb about things she knew too little about. Draco needed to cultivate certainty and courage, that was for certain.
The Dark Light District was located off Shaftesbury Ave, it’s exterior resembled that of west end theatre in between shows. Doors closed off and poster holders empty and white. All of which covered in a healthy layer of graffiti. To Muggles it was nothing.
Escape was probably the simplest answer. The truth was Draco didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted away from his family, he wanted not exist without the expectations.
Draco blushed. He did not like the big boys, he huffed to himself and collapsed onto the bed. It was comfortable enough.
Draco found it rather easy to get a job at the pizza place, frankly, if he didn’t know any better he would have guessed that Frank had a crush on Harry. “I’ve got you an apron,” Frank said handing over a tan apron.
Draco didn’t answer. Dudley smiled and got up, after a few moments Draco heard the blender going. Before Dudley returned with a jug. “Open up” Dudley encouraged.
Dudley Dursley flipped the sausages in the frying pan. The oil crackled so loudly he could barely make out Richard and Judy. Soon when it was a sufficient shade of brown he lifted them onto his breakfast plate.
Narcissa saw the discomfort and waved it away. “But enough of this maudlin prattle. Enjoy your meal, my son,” she encouraged, and nodded as Harry (as Draco) selected a fork and began to tidily slice at the corner of a meat pie on his plate.
It certainly didn’t help matters that the first distinct sensation that Harry had, in Draco’s body, was hunger.
“It’s deserved,” Hermione said firmly. “I can’t believe you’d be reckless enough to con Harry into this? And what about Dudley?”
“I’ve been busy,” Draco said. As he pulled the pram inside, her other two children gave brief hugs to Draco which he felt obliged to hug back. Before sitting beside their mother. “Can I get you some water?” Draco asked.
“Right. We’ll drop in a resume and I’ll give it a look. My Dads retiring as his altzimers is getting a little worse for wear. And I need someone more reliable than a high schooler.”
Hermione nodded inhaling a couple of doughnuts impressively easily. Although given her figure it made sense Granger would have a greedy streak.
“Sumo wrestlers?” Harry asked, his cheeks growing hot even though this wasn’t his embarrassment to own.
A few minutes later, Harry was also disrobed and in his short sleeves. He studied Draco in furtive glances and did his best to appear as bored as Malfoy did.
“Good” Jacinder pulled on Draco’s shirt. Kissing him firmly. His tongue pressing inside Draco’s mouth and teeth knocking together. Draco let himself be swept up into the bittersweet kiss.
Draco nodded slowly, he had a thought but the doorbell rang. “What now” he mumbled and walked to the front door and opened it.
“Your words are a waste of air, son,” Lucius uttered, and with a solemn shake of his head, it was clear that Jacinder’s fate was sealed.
“Carry on,” Draco acknowledged with a genteel wave of his hand. “I will sit and observe and we can talk more once your shift is over.”
“Yes I did Cousin” Draco nodded feeling his cheeks blush. Potter’s cousin was quite appealing. Although he then remembered he also looked like Harry.
Eventually Harry rejoined Draco, now in a casual shirt and jeans. He looked far more out of place than anyone else at the establishment. “Do you have lodgings?” Draco asked.
“Indeed,” Draco sniffed, and he reached for Harry’s shirt. “Right then.” He put on the garment and then grabbed Harry’s trousers and slipped them up easily. Harry did the same actions with Draco’s outfit as well, feeling three times more awkward than Malfoy. He wanted to explore the other boy’s body - how it felt, how he needed to adjust his bearings, and all that.
Then an idea struck him. A patsy! Draco needed to merely find another boy about his age and have them disguise themselves with polyjuice potion.
"I did no such thing," Lucius snapped, not willing to admit how right his wife was. It was different, joining the Death Eaters compared to Abraxas' unscrupulous business dealings. But he often thought deeply about what other options he thought he'd had at the time. In retrospect, it was difficult to think of what else he could have done. "But let's drop the subject," he went on, and put a finger on his chin in a thoughtful gesture. "It's high time for the boy to do his
At the end of the shift, he was grateful for Dudley’s apartment being so close by. He belched very few steps, his gut-churning uncomfortably. Draco collapsed onto the couch groaning, as Dudley was leant forward watching football on the television. “Urrrppp”
“Dudley knows. He picked it quicker than you to be honest. And he’s fine as long as I pay my bills. And I didn’t con him, I offered, and Harry agreed. He seemed like he wanted the escape as much as I did.”
“I’m looking forward to it” Draco reassured. “Err I’m hanging up now,” he said putting down the receiver hearing Frank laugh.
At the bottom of the tower there was a small corner shop and beside that a fish and chip shop and a pizza shop. In the window was a flyer wanting an employee.
Harry couldn’t help but think to himself - it was at her behest that he was now sitting here, underground, in this secluded place. But he found a tug at his heartstrings as he felt the radiant warmth from Narcissa.
"Nonsense," Lucius said, shrugging and putting his elbows on the rail of the balcony. "My father did far worse things that I had to shoulder and bear. Just think of how he decimated the Hill People's land, and how I still am picking up the pieces from that."
"How horrible!" Narcissa exclaimed, and motioned for the boys to sit down. She poured them both cups of tea and handed them the saucers.
and munching on some toast. Narcissa was cutting into her eggs. The four children were behaving themselves, and trying not to shovel their cereals into their mouths. Harry looked around, observing the domestic scene before him. Perhaps, for a long time, all his mornings would look like that.
"Can't it wait ‘til tea?" He tried to stall as he was really not in the mood to try to deal with more problems.
"It's just that ... since everything started to happen, I'm just seeing my marriage the way it is. She's always away, but even when she's here, she doesn't care for the kids much and ... for me neither. Lately, she had been acting more enthusiastic and loving, but I can't help remembering that before it was never like that since we got married." He sighed, remembering that up until a few days before, the last time they had gone on a picnic was still in his courting days. Not that he hadn't tried afterwards, but she always had an excuse.
“No. Severus he and I we were working on a more permanent version. Lasts longer and not needing to be taken as often”
Draco hated that now it was no longer forbidden Jacinder was nowhere near as appealing. He saw the open mahogany door to the ‘Broomstick’ a private gentleman’s club he’d become a member of.
Truthfully Draco preferred someone who at least contrasted his figure. But he could appreciate Harry’s painfully thin build.
Harry nodded seemingly understand. “I thought perhaps you might consent to swapping, you take my place with mother. Let her fuss and spoil you. And I’ll live as you. For a year at most” Draco suggested.
The second was well. Hermione looked rather different than when he’d seen her last. She was as round in circumference as she was tall. Her body was mostly defined by an utterly enormous belly. Her bosom was heavy and round sitting pendulously on the top of her gut. While her belly seemingly swelled out from her chest down to her knees. Her face was round double chins and plump cheeks that gave Hermione rounder features, although with her ridiculously curly hair. It almost suited her.
Still none of this reflection did anything to illuminate the current situation. What might Malfoy want from someone - particularly Harry - switching bodies with him?
“Quite quickly yes. Frankly, he’s obviously got some demons lurking, given how underfed he was. What’s the muggle word that Dudley suggested. Depressed” Draco said firmly.
Frank leaned over and rubbed Draco’s belly. “Not bad for a first-timer” his fingers rubbing the bloated orb.
“Urrrrpppp….yes…sir” Draco replied as another cake got shoved into his mouth. Swallowing greedily, as his belly bloated further.
“Right. Thankyou, my bag is in the cloak room” Draco said sliding across a ticket. “Now I’ve sourced the potion. Once a week, about 30ml should suffice” Draco smiled. “No last minute grievances I should be warned of?” Draco queried.
. My father would have sent him on his way the day of graduation. He's had several months to enjoy his whims."
.” He remembered to use the proper name that Draco prompted him to use. The light in Narcissa’s eyes confirmed the success of the trick.
“I’m living with cousin. He’s a muggle, but he’s gay too. So it’s pretty easy” Harry admitted. “I will have to tell him about our swap, he’ll know it’s not me” Harry commented.
“Please don’t punish him for my mistake, father!” Draco uttered, looking pale and frightened. Indeed, Lucius thought - the boy was far too soft for his own good.
No, it wasn’t distressing at all - just a nuisance. It was for this reason that their Flemish forbears must have came up with the *rondwandelen*.
Dudley grinned, “you know the whole thing is dumb right. I’d have never agreed to something like that.”
“Yes those,” Narcissa agreed, warming to her subject. “I can bring down your journals from your nightstand. And besides those, I have reviewed the contents of your private account at Madam Malkin’s… ordering thousands of galleons worth of clothing suited for a much… much larger man. I was worried you were dating someone much older until the good Madam was gracious enough to show me the spells you’ve been using to… simulate growth, so as to fill out those gargantuan robes.”
,” agreed Harry, and he sat there contemplating the little purple vial for a few moments, trying to will his stomach to allow it. But before he could ask her any questions, she was gone.
Narcissa Malfoy emerged with a fresh outfit and renewed makeup, and Harry wondered where she had the time to achieve this new look.
He made his way up the narrow staircase and into the main staircase, behind a velvet club, on an easel sat a chalkboard ‘Life drawing.’ I peered around the corner chairs and easels were set up facing the chaise lounge.  Laying naked on there was an enormously fat man in his mid-forties, rolls of fat bulged and swelled giving him a hulking figure. Draped across his enormous gut was a thin figure with a dark mess of hair. Men were furiously drawing away, and each depicting the tableau in their unique style.
“Well, I can’t wait around not being pregnant for long. Viktor is begging for number five” Hermione commented.
“You’ll grow into it, I used to be thin before I started working here,” Frank said patting his stomach. Draco found himself staring at the jiggling belly perhaps more than he ought to have.
Draco winced, “Hello Hermione, Can I help you?” he asked trying to sound as Harry like as possible. Which meant not calling her Granger.
Draco walked in and up to the counter and a fat Italian man in his late twenties waddled up, an apron pulled tight around his belly. He wore a name tag with a Frank on it.
“I see,” Harry uttered, not sure where to go from here. He felt a warm, buttery melty feeling in his chest that made him extremely anxious in how delicious it felt. Was this what Draco felt like with his mother all the time? What an intoxicating feeling.
“I know you said that,” Hermione said frowning slightly. “But I thought you were going to wait until I had your baby?”
He had tracked down and made the appropriate adjustments to Enough Polyjuice potion to last a year. Although Draco had struggled to break things off with Jacinder. He had attempted twice and both times he felt too guilty and ended up sleeping with him.
“I see,” Harry said, feeling a lump in his throat. Draco probably has no clue his mum knew about all this… and it felt wrong to be the one who was learning all these intimate details about Draco’s private passions.
There had to be a reason that Draco hated so much to be sent on this gap year adventure. And another reason that Draco was so motivated to avoid a year being mothered to death.
Draco squinted but shook his head. Hermione helped her youngest two children who had been drawing with markers into the pram. “Thank you, Harry,” Hermione said ushering them to the door. “Say Goodbye to Uncle Harry.”
Dudley smirked and leaned over and began to massage Draco’s belly, slow and firm circles. “You have to all that gas out. Otherwise, you won’t have room for more.
Still, there was worse company. Harry didn’t complain that he came home smelling of motor oil. Harry didn’t complain when Dudley came home plastered with a boy to fuck. Harry just existed, the biggest impression beyond keeping himself tidy was he drank a few beers. But Harry would contribute to rent and bills, and replaced their supply of beer every week so it hardly mattered.
Contrary to popular opinion, the Malfoy family wasn’t French, but Belgian. As a teenager, during his own *rondwandelen,* Lucius went once to see the cousins in Flanders, and to his great embarrassment he’s learned that his studies of French were little to no use in communicating with his extended family. They spoke incomprehensible English and Lucius spoke no Dutch at all. It was an extremely educational trip though, and one that Lucius recalled with great fondness in his adulthood.
Draco nodded and withdrew into the kitchen trying to steel himself. He was Harry, he needed to keep up the charade. As he opened the fridge his stomach gurgled once again aching to be filled. Dudley had certainly ruined him. He removed the box of doughnuts along with a bottle of lemonade. It didn’t take long for the tea to brew. He carried it all on a tray and placed it down on the coffee table. Hermione’s older sons snatched up glasses and doughnuts, while Hermione handed her younger two children the plastic cups Draco had managed to find at the back of one of the cupboards. The three oldest sat near the television still more interested in the video game than their Mum's conversation.
Throughout the week, Harry found himself returning to the Piazza many times, and the ambiance of it quickly made it his favourite as well. It helped that the loud cars couldn't enter with all their honking. The city seemed to be filled by Bernini's works, which Draco never failed to point out. The men in his sculptures were really very life-like, but also mostly of the strong muscular type, which Harry realised didn't really appeal to him all that much. The one that he did find beautiful, was in the Galleria Borghese. The title of the work was
Harry tried to get a look. He could have seen the person clearly if it wasn't for the waitress standing in his way. As she moved, he was astonished to recognise the man. He didn't know his name, but it was the same man that had propositioned Draco during the party.
"Their children wanted you. Probably promised grandchildren. The Potter fortune must have come in handy too."
He decided that he had done enough snooping for the night and returned to the ballroom to finally have that dance with his wife. However, what he found there interrupted his plans. Ron, Hermione and Lucius were standing in the middle of the dance-floor. Ron was shouting and beet red. Hermione was clearly annoyed and Lucius had the air of dignified amusement. None were speaking, though Ron had probably already shouted. The other guests were just standing around, like spectators at a sporting event. Harry supposed that, in a way, it was a lot like it.
Hermione decided it was time for another drink and she got him another one. Once more, Malfoy drank it without looking, but couldn't manage to stop himself from the disgust showing all over his face. "Really, Potter, what sort of a Firewhisky do you keep?"
Once they arrived to the Ministry, he hurried past the fountain memorial and upon seeing that all the lifts were in motion; he nervously pushed the button to go down. Ginny was saying something beside him, but he took no notice of her. He leapt into the lift and rolled his eyes as his wife took a more sedate pace to join him. Of course, things were made worse for him when the lift refused to take him straight to his destination and stopped along the way for other passengers. Finally, they reached the level of the Wizengamot and he stood in front of the great doors leading to the large chamber where they all sat.
The other thing that delayed was that I’m trying to write a novel right now. It’s sci-fi, and happens in the future. It may be a bit dystopian, but not really. I’m writing it in Hungarian, which is sometimes difficult, because I’m so used to writing it in English. However, I’ll also write it in English after I’m done. No publisher, I’ll probably just go ahead with self-publishing. Keep your fingers crossed for me! :D
"I've been such a fool. All along, I thought my wife loved me. So she wanted to see the world. Sure! Why not!" He laughed mockingly at himself. "When all along she was going away to hop into the bed of other men. Maybe women too. I found her in the middle of an orgy in some club, so I'm not sure." He looked up at Draco, noting that the man wasn't surprised.
They went on to discuss many things that day, but mostly they just enjoyed each other's company. Harry barely got home before the others.
As she was walking them to a table, Harry observed the room. It was a rather quiet place with an intimate atmosphere. The area was dominated by the colours green and purple. Harry actually liked it and he was curious about the food. On the tables he saw there was nothing that he recognised as edible. People seemed to be spooning bubbling electric blue soups into their mouths and carving up vibrant yellow twigs with crimson spots inside. He just hoped they tasted good.
"I'm sorry. I'll be going then." He moved to get up, but the other man was quickly by his side and held his wrist gently. Harry didn't even see him round the table, but there he was, sitting next to him, their legs touching. Draco was so close.
"All right, let's get down to business," Draco began. "Obviously, since you're here, you've started the next phase."
"No, Hermione, it's politics. People make such deals all the time. One supports the other in one bill, and then the other returns the favour. It's how things work," Malfoy explained matter-of-factly.
Once they were finished with their meal, they composed a letter together for Malfoy. Harry sought out his owl, Scops. He was a Common Scops Owl and had his own little space in the attic. The bird was much smaller than Hedwig had been, kind of funny looking too, with big round eyes, but Ginny thought it was cute, and so they bought it at the time when they got married. She had told him that it was ridiculous that he was still mourning his late owl, but on many lonely days she had been his only companion. Harry found Scops sleeping on his perch and had to nudge him awake. Scops puffed and huffed, but stuck out his leg dutifully. His large eyes widened in bewilderment when he was told his destination, but left for Malfoy's home all the same.
Harry was glad to hear it, though. That meant that they had time. As long as the divorce wasn't finalised, the children could still go to Hermione at the end of it all. In the Wizarding world rulings were rarely overturned and it was rare that someone even attempted it. Harry was sure that enough time had passed to move onto the next phase of the plan and he couldn't wait for it. Of course, the past weeks were rather pleasant most of the time, but once he started to move forward with his life again, he was loath to go back to being idle.
Harry nodded and Draco stood up. He held out a hand to Harry and the other man took it to stand up. He remembered the time he wouldn't take Draco's hand again. As much as he didn't want to be connected to the blond then, there had always been something between them. Perhaps all this time, this was where they were heading.
He skipped down the stairs to the kitchen, where he startled his house-elf with his loud morning greeting. Hermione was already sitting at the table and smiled at his antics. She had dark circles around her eyes and the fact that she was not trying to take over Dinky's work was a testament to her exhaustion. Their special white flour-free, sugar-free sandwiches were placed before them, along with tea and sweeteners. As Harry was munching on his breakfast, he was glad that Dinky could bake the special bread; it was so delicious warm, and fresh. They also ate a small salad on the side which contained a few slices of crisp green apple.
Draco led him to his bedroom and the enormous bed they had shared the previous evening. They stopped next to it and Draco slipped his robe off, letting it pool around his feet. He locked eyes with Harry as he unbuttoned his shirt, but not too slowly, he was too impatient for that. As the pale torso was revealed, Harry couldn't help his gaze darting down to drink it all in. The flat chest seemed more inviting than Ginny's more rounded one, even though she never had large breasts, just when she was breastfeeding. It was those male nipples he wanted to taste. Then Draco bent to pull his trousers off, and in a second he was standing in a pair of tight boxer shorts.
The food there was very molecular gastronomy and Draco was awed by the selection. They quickly ordered.
The exercise outside got everyone hungry and they soon had dinner. After that, the children resolved to play inside and the adults scattered about the house, cleaning up or just chatting about things. Harry sought Arthur out and sat with him to talk about the Great Vote, as he had started to think about it.
"Yes, ever since I entered Hogwarts, but more so once I learned about house-elves. I mean, you probably knew all along that they were the ones doing the cooking and cleaning, while I just thought that it was all done by some magic of the castle.
“Hermione, Malfoy, this is not leading us to anything.” Harry tried to take up the role of referee. “Malfoy, can you think of another way that Hermione could get her children? Maybe a solicitor would be of help.”
"Well, at least you tried, mate." Ron put a supporting hand on his shoulder with such force that Harry had to keep himself from wincing.
Walking down the narrow streets in the quaint quarter, they had a hard time choosing a restaurant. The menus were put out, but in some of the places only in Italian. Draco picked a smaller place in the end, but it was packed with people. They got the last table in the house, that was just vacated by an American couple. They were complaining loudly about the staff not speaking English.
"It's not the same, but it must have been an interesting experience," Lucius said, while Harry tried to avoid remembering the circumstances of that ride. "It's a long way to the Manor. How about I take you there?" The older man offered.
"It's a mushroom in your intestines," she said that word like any other, but Harry had to force himself not to be put off of his food. "So, it's there normally, but sometimes it spreads and you have too much of it. So then you need to kill it. They gave me some pills and prescribed this really strict diet. I had to give up sugar of all kinds and flour of all kinds. Plus mushrooms, but I don't like that much anyway. Oh, and no sweet fruits or juices."
"Harry? What is it?" Draco asked. He reluctantly got up, and followed the oblivious Harry to the other room. He read the letter that was placed on the desk, patted the unruly dark curls of his lover, and went in search of a robe.
They started out with the small church across the street. It was pretty, but didn't hold much interest to Harry. Because of the renovation it seemed to lack character. Afterwards, Draco pulled him down the street, until they got to a big wide open field with a few ruins on it.
"I don't know his name, but he was at the party the night before," Harry explained as he turned back.
"Breakfast?" Draco asked, arching a perfectly shaped eyebrow. "That's supposed to be an omelette?" he pointed to the plates.
Harry felt very proud that day and looking up to the audience, he could see Hermione's smiling face. They could finally go on with the divorce. However, this had not only been about her. This was for all the women in the Wizarding world. There must have been more who felt trapped in marriages they couldn't leave, because they had children and could not leave them behind. Arranged marriages like Draco's with far less generous contracts and far more loving mothers could be broken with the new laws. He felt that they had achieved something that would impact so many lives. They had done it together.
“Malfoy, honestly, this is the first time I've heard about this. I know that the Light Families have been in power for a while, but I didn’t know how that came about,” Harry pleaded. He wanted to hear everything.
"He'll love that!" she exclaimed. "You forgot to have it gift wrapped. Anyway, I know what I want for Christmas. That new broom. It's great!"
It felt better than ending the war. That victory was dampened by the many people lost not only in the final battle but in the whole war. This time only he had lost. He had lost a family he thought he would always have. However, it had been worth it. The lives he just saved or made better were worth the sacrifice he had made. The benefits far outweighed the cost. And he wasn't done yet. He still had some child protection laws to write. He felt that he had found his real calling in bettering the lives of people through laws. He felt that he had arrived to the place where he was meant to be.
"I don't know much about Wizarding Family Law myself," he continued, "nor do I know any solicitors who are good in the field. But, I had an idea last night. I ran into Draco Malfoy yesterday."
Inside, they were greeted by uniformed servants, who exclaimed over the pleasure of having guests in the house. Their English was heavily accented. The couple was lead to their rooms, that consisted of a small sitting room with a nice breakfast table beside the window, a light and airy bedroom with a bed to rival Draco's, and a decadent bathroom with a great claw-footed bathtub. After they were shown the bells to ring the staff, the maid left discreetly.
Draco stared at him, but it wasn't the amused smirk Harry expected. The blond looked a bit scared. Harry suspected it was because of his feelings. However, he needed to see if kissing Draco sober felt as good as drunk. For once, he had to put his own needs before others, or in this case, Draco Malfoy's.
"I was,” she agreed. “I don't know what happened, but I feel like I woke up from a long sleep. Maybe it's my diet."
"Just not the ones with a high sugar content. Green apples are fine," she answered and even smiled a little.
"Well, I'd better be going." Draco put down his cup and stood to leave. "You can stay and talk some more if you want, Harry. Goodbye and see you later." He walked out the room, probably on his way to change as well.
"Adrian Conti. Son of an old Italian family. His parents were immigrants. Very well known in the upper circles of society." Draco waved a dismissing hand. "He loves to play games, so in case we need more help, he would be happy to provide it. I am glad to hear that you progress so well with the Wizengamot. What you need to do now is follow up on the contacts you made at the ball."
The afternoon tea room was already occupied. The two elder Malfoys sat around a low table in comfortable armchairs and were conversing. Harry had never been in that room and he was amazed at how warm it looked. It was full of green, which was apparently the Malfoy colour of choice but a lighter green. The chairs and even the walls were decorated with a forest motif. Among the green leaves Harry could see beautiful flowers and colourful birds. The latter moved as he was watching, to his surprise. He never knew that wallpaper could be charmed the same way as paintings.
"No. Hermione is divorcing him and I took her side. So now everyone is mad  at me!" Harry shouted, his frustration finally surfacing.
His musings were interrupted by his wife when she got up and suggested a bit of fun in bed. He sighed and cast a last look at the tree to make sure that all the presents were under it, then reluctantly headed upstairs.
Harry wondered why they had brought Malfoy in for interrogation. He couldn't  remember the blond man being tied to any of their cases. He shrugged and  made his way to the little corner desk. He noted that it was probably the  oldest one in the room, covered with carvings made by obviously bored  previous owners. He lit the candle on it, noting that it was a very small  stub. He looked around for a bigger piece, but couldn't find one. He sighed  again, wondering who he had pissed off to have such a bloody awful day, and  headed to the supply closet to retrieve some more candles.
"Great. I'll leave you two alone to chat. I'll be in the library checking up on my son if you need anything," the blond man said as he put down his empty cup and stood from his seat.
There was a glint in his eye that Harry didn’t like. It was like looking at a person he didn’t know. He thought of trying to convince the man of how wrong it all was, but then he realised that he didn’t know much of the
"I've had a crush on you since I saw you at Madame Malkins'. I tried to show off at every given opportunity, but it always managed to backfire on me," the blond admitted.
Draco wasn't very happy about not going after Ginny, but he understood that Harry wanted to spare his children. A clean break was going to be the best.
"You could wear one of Ginny's fancier robes. She has so many, I doubt she has even ever worn half of them," he said, remembering the many times that the end-of-the-month reports from his Gringotts vaults had listed the names of a clothing establishments. He didn't even know there were so many places to buy robes! Not to mention that robes could cost that many
Harry completely forgot. He frowned and went back to their room. The day was not going well and he was hungry. As a child, he could live on a piece of toast for days; however, those times were long past and he was no longer used to hunger. He was slightly irritable. As he started to change into street clothes, he saw his wife follow him and begin to dress as well.
"Where are we going, Harry?" she asked, excitement appearing in her voice at the prospect of an outing.
"Oh, Hermione, I miss the kids so much," Harry began, trying to sound as authentic as he could manage.
Harry fought down his nervousness and attempted to concentrate on the gorgeous body under him. Draco was pale as moonlight, white creamy skin glistening in the candlelight. He was mostly hairless, whether naturally so or artificially, Harry couldn't tell. He was looking at Harry with an eager smile on his face, eyes shining with anticipation.
Harry woke with a start. He looked around, then when he realised his vision was blurred, he scrambled to get his glasses from his nightstand.
There were many more points. Wives had very little rights to start with. There were no laws against physical or psychological abuse. It was all very archaic. Draco explained that there used to be much more legislation for women, but since the Light Families had taken over, they were deemed unnecessary and against the integrity of the family, so they were erased. With Hermione's help, they took a look at how Muggles had formulated their protection laws and took those as an example. Harry noticed that child protection laws were also lacking and they made it the subject of their next project.
The month of December had passed quickly and was blissfully almost over. He had been very busy, but his efforts had paid off. The voting for his seats was scheduled for January 9th, which was ironically Snape's birthday, as Draco had pointed out. Once that was done, he could finally end the charade. He wondered how Ginny was going to react, since the break with Light Wizards also meant a break with her family. He found himself not particularly caring.
"Come, sit down Harry!" the other man motioned for him to join him and Harry took him up on his offer. "Had a bit too much? Me too," Draco said as Harry nodded.
Harry returned to his task, and was soon inserting three fingers in, stretching Draco. His lips left the beautiful cock, and he swiped his tongue around the rim of the hole he was preparing. That elicited another loud moan, and Harry teased the opening further.
"Look at the statues, Harry. The men are beautiful, strong and muscular. So life-like too." Draco drew his attention to the figures. "This is what I like the most about Bernini. It's almost as if his characters could stand up and walk away any moment."
Once the letter was finished, Harry returned to the bedroom. Draco had prepared quite a picnic on the bed, and he sat down to have a naked lunch. Harry noticed how quiet Draco was.
"Draco, I know you do. I also know that it's hard for you to get by in this strange world, but you're learning. I'm sure that soon you'll get the hang of it," Harry soothed the feelings of his boyfriend.
"Oh Harry, I'm sure they won't. We love them, no matter how they came to being." Hermione tried to reassure him. "What if we keep the whole thing as a last resort?"
The coffee table before him had an assortment of cakes and other foods, along with a pot of sweet-smelling tea. Hermione assured him that he could eat anything. They had both broken their diets at the Alchemist, but returned to it by the next meal.
"Well, Potter, you need to be voted back in. Before you ask, Weasley can't just hand the votes over to you. He could have when you turned 17 and became of age. Then it would have been the natural process of things. However, that was a long time ago. Since you didn't get them back then, Weasley became the official holder of the votes, not just their temporary custodian until you were available. The process in this case is that the members of the Wizengamot need to vote to have either Weasley remain the holder, or turn it over to you. If they decide Weasley should keep them, the next time he can lose them is when your eldest turns 17. Then he can do the same thing you should have done at 17," Malfoy scolded at him a bit, pausing in his explanation.
They had worked hard for a month. They wrote a bill that would change the family law in their world. Of course, first they had to map out just what was missing in their legislation. Harry was quite shocked to discover that women had no right to individual property in a marriage. They could make contracts before a marriage as to what they should be getting once it ended, but it could never be more than 10% of the husband's overall wealth. In the absence of a contract, they would be getting nothing. Once they entered a marriage, everything they owned became the property of their husband. Except for one thing, in case they had children from another man. Of course, Harry knew from the start what laws there were regarding the children who
Harry had a difficult time figuring out the Malfoys. When he was younger, he thought that they were bad people. During the war he realised that although Lucius was a bad person, the rest of the family was just trying to survive in their own way. Now, his perception was changing again. No, not only his perception, but also the Malfoys themselves had changed. No one could live through a war and remain the same.
“I do know that,” Harry agreed, and undid the other man’s bowtie to use it to pull his lips onto his own. “I know that very well. And not just at piano.”
“That she wasn’t happy anymore and wanted to become a healer. Something which you didn’t support. She was also troubled by your attitude towards her desire not to have more kids,” Harry summed up.
He frowned. “This is unimportant now though. With the Light Families in charge of the Wizengamot, you’ll never change the divorce laws.”
"Well, I'm glad that's over," Draco spoke up and his calm tone startled Harry. He was still dazed from the slap and being told off by his wife. "Oh, come on Harry. I know this great restaurant nearby. We can finally have lunch together in public." The blond took his arm and led him towards the lifts. They were the only ones left on the corridor and their heels echoed in the empty space.
Harry adjusted his purple robes in the mirror and cringed as the star pattern twinkled on them. Apparently Ginny's idea of the perfect man to dress him as was Dumbledore. At least she had relented on him spelling his hair long and silver. No beard either. Just the robes. For the umpteenth time Harry wondered why Dumbledore insisted on wearing such clothes, but the again, the old man had probably never made it on any "Best Dressed" lists either.
Potions master for myself. What you just told me reminds me of an old potion Light Families used when they had an unwilling bride. It made her complacent and desperate to please. Practically like a lapdog."
"Ah, well, you see, ugh, Malfoy, ... I like blokes too," Harry admitted. "And, oh, I ... I've had a crush on you ever since I realised that fact," he averted his gaze, not being able to face the other at his revelation.
"Hi, Hermione. Glad to see that you are doing so well," he said with a blush. He felt like a pauper amidst all the opulence. He had even put on his best robes that morning knowing that he would be coming.
"I see." Harry nodded and pretended to mull over the words as he drank from his tea, but he was actually thinking about what his next step should be. "How do I gather the support?" he asked innocently.
Harry finished his dinner quickly and he wondered whether or not he should change. He looked down at his house clothes, the rather worn loose trousers and the T-shirt and then looked over at his friend. Changing would be a good idea, he decided and let Hermione know that he would be in his rooms. So he went up to his bathroom, cleaned his teeth and face. Afterwards he selected his favourite emerald-green shirt and black trousers. He reluctantly put on a short black robe. He was still not used to wearing such things outside of work, but the shorter ones were not such a bother. They were quite modern as well, he supposed. He hadn't seen short robes until a few years before, and he was glad that they appeared as they weren't as annoying as the long kind. He didn't bother with his hair as he knew it would be in vain, so he went down to see that Hermione had already finished her meal.
Harry blushed at the realisation that it was indeed so. Once it stopped sprouting, they both eagerly spooned the delicacy into their mouths. The base of the mound popped in Harry's mouth like popping candy. He thought the whole thing very clever and it was even delicious. Ginny kept giggling.
He went into the house to try and find Draco, so he could say goodbye. He didn't want to be rude and not bid farewell to his host. However, after about ten minutes of looking for the blond he realised that Malfoy Manor was so immense that he could probably look for days for him and still not find him. He was just about ready to try to call a house-elf, when he noticed a small blond head poking out from behind a modestly ornate couch in a sitting room.
He lead him to the correct house, for which Harry was glad. He half expected to end up in a dark alley and having to ward off a robbery attempt.
"A kiss?" Harry asked, hissing the 's' like a snake and put down his empty glass to fill it up again.
The rest of the day was spent with the children, and with some swimming. Before he started to spend time in the pool room of Malfoy Manor, Harry hardly ever spent time in the water, but he realised that he really loved it. He was a bit clumsy when it came to the actual strokes, and Draco along with Hermione helped him to become better at them. Sometimes though, his clumsiness could be attributed to the fact that Draco in his tiny swim shorts was a very enticing sight. If Hermione had not been in the water with them, they would have had to lock the doors.
"What?! I have tolerated such talk when we weren't together, but you are my wife and I'm tired of you acting this way!" Ron continued to scream and Harry was afraid his eardrums would burst. "You are coming home with me this minute! Or else..."
"Yes, it was," Harry grudgingly agreed. "So, who are you dressed as?" He directed the question to the man before him.
You may ask, what took me so long? Well, several things, actually. On the one hand I wrote the chapter, but I just wasn’t happy with it. I didn’t plan on ending it this way, but I worked through some issues, saw some things, and this is what I ended up with. I re-read it several times. Thought about it, but in the end, I just felt that I couldn’t end it any other way. I know some people will be a bit disappointed, but oh well, can’t please everyone.
Harry looked up and saw that the blond man was leaning over the railing of the veranda. His hair seemed to sparkle in the moonlight and his amused features were easy to make out. The hidden man wondered about what sort of fun they were talking about.
Finally inside, they hiked up the small hill. On the top, they saw an arena. It stretched out before them like a Quidditch stadium, and Harry wondered what wizards played in those times. Probably something a lot more brutal than Quidditch. After that they went into the museum to have a look at some statues that were found on the hill. It mostly had heads, or headless torsos.
"I've promised to help you." Harry refused to hear her protests. "I have a lot of money, even with Ginny practically pouring it out the window on her trips. A lot of my money is invested in good, solid businesses that are making more money. Let me use it to help you."
"I only ever really kissed Ginnnny. Cho once, but that was weiiird and doesn't really count." He shrugged. His words were becoming more slurred as the alcohol level rose.
A year before, he was alone, and now his wife was sitting next to him, watching the fire. Before, Ginny arrived to their home just in the very early hours of the morning, in time for the children to wake up. They had not spent so much time together since Lily was born, and instead of warming to her, he secretly wished she would feel an unquenchable desire for a remote island already. Though he had to admit, she was useful when visiting the Wizengamot members.
He tried to look around to see if he could buy a present from the shop while his wife got in a lively conversation with the proprietor over the Nimbus Apocalypse. Apparently, the broom got its name from the Muggle belief that the world was going to end that year.
The time it took her to reach the Manor and then the room, allowed him to gather his thoughts. He did want the children, but he wasn’t very keen on the house, and if some money could ease the process, he wasn’t against that either. He just wanted the divorce to go quickly, and without much publicity.
“Right, who do you usually rope into this?” Draco questioned, eyeing the bag of groceries Dudley had picked up from the Co-op. “Guys who are into this shit. Although I have to do it when Harry’s out, makes it awkward I guess” Dudley shifted.
“You’re not subtle. I can tell you like the big boys” Dudley laughed. “But you also look like my cousin. So..keep looking” Dudley laughed.
Hermione smiled gently and squeezed Draco’s hand in her fat palms. “He’s being a stubborn git. Harry, I heard you quit your job?”
But essentially Dudley had explained that Draco would be pretending to be a footballer, that needed to bulk up. Draco assumed it made sense, Dudley had unsuccessfully explained what football was to him. Which fine he could do that, although he struggled to imagine if Harry would make it convincing. The narrow thin body, becoming less thin with each passing day. Draco had to admit he was enjoying the soft feeling of his belly that now defined Harry’s frame.
After removing himself from the club, he found the nearest toilet just inside a Preta. He examined his new body, Potter was far to thin, painfully so. He obviously didn’t eat properly as Draco found his stomach so I fed he resembled one of the starving paupers you’d see in the prophet desperate for money. He was quite well hung which was typical.
Draco explained the Polyjuice potion and the situation with his parents. The Gap year, his Mother’s plea and his agreement with Harry.
“Then when Harry reverts to his body he would have a tattoo” Draco explained. Draco winced, as he inwardly realized this was one of the few unintended side effects of the enhanced polyjuice potion that Snape had designed. He struggled to remember if he had told Harry about this fact - but he shrugged it off, he could tell him next time they made contact.
“I haven’t been working here for long,” admitted Harry, and he sighed. “This is just something to give me a little extra once in a while. Normally I make house calls.”
"It is settled," Lucius said, then clapped his hands quickly. The house-elf, Dorky, manifested in an instant and bowed low. "Dorky, please gather the necessary items for Master Draco's
Harry felt awkward but followed Draco to the bathroom, feeling his throat tighten and his breathing quicken. He was not sure what Draco had in mind, and he was nervous about what this would entail…
“Stay at mine. At least until you sort something out” Jacinder smiled. “You shouldn’t be alone. You parents that weren’t fair.”
Draco’s only saving grace was that enclosed in his nearly-empty purse, here was a letter from his mother. “Please son, come and sneak in through the eastern tunnel. I will conceal you from your father for this long and terrible year. I am so frightened for you. After nearly losing you in your sixth year, I know I will break to not know you are safe and well cared for.  I firmly believe that Snape died to give you a second chance, my darling. Please, please come home to me my sweet baby. If you don’t I will absolutely die of heartbreak.”
He noticed the pram with two children seated in its confines while hovering just behind Hermione’s enormous behind was two further children. Two with curly hair much like her, the others with dark hair.
“Alright then,” Malfoy said, and rolled his shoulders back. “I guess I’ll shove off, then. Take care of my mother, right?”
Dudley left Harry alone to the hum of the fridge. As he ate two sausages he’d wrapped in a serviette. He assumed Harry had a job, or Harry at least did something.
“You’d know if you Owled” She replied irritated puffing out of breath as Draco helped her to the couch where she wheezed trying to catch her breath.
Harry nodded and cut a chunk of his dark hair off with a pair of nail scissors he produced. Harry unplugged the bottle and pushed the hair in before replacing the cork and shaking the bottle.
Draco had to admit, he was enjoying this. He enjoyed being fed, he enjoyed giving control over. He continued to eat and swallow each of the cakes. Dudley would grip and fondle Draco’s bloating belly, as his jersey lifted exposing his swollen middle.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Lucius pulled the lever to open the gate. The magical apparatus seemed to know how irate Lucius was - it squeaked open deferentially, permitting Lucius to push Draco out with a single elegant hand. The latch snapped closed again straight after, leaving a teary eyed Draco grasping at the iron bars.
Draco laughed superficially. “Of course. On that note, don’t you dare let my physique run to seed. It has been a massive undertaking to resist my mother’s finest temptations, for so many years - and I will *not* have my efforts go to waste.”
"Oh, please, Lucius," Narcissa asked, and she tried to convey the sadness in her eyes. But her husband would have nothing of it.
Hermione ignored him, “I will slap you again.” Draco squinted at her. “Fine, I burned myself out. I graduated with strong results in my NEWTS and went straight into a ministry position. It just wasn’t challenging and frankly, it was impossible to get anything done” she huffed. “Ron and I called it quits and I realised I needed a break. Viktor invited me to Bulgaria, things started from there. He spoils me, and I suppose I don’t mind. He’s a good father, he’s supportive and puts up with me, and a big personality”
“But you said that wasn’t…” Her second-oldest son asked. Hermione shushed him, and they all said goodbye.
“No mate, we eat it” Frank grinned. “On a good day, you’ll get about two. On a bad day, you’ll get about five.”
The uncomfortable bubbly feeling of polyjuice started to do its work, and quicker than Harry could have guessed or expected, all of a sudden he saw himself across the room, and saw Draco where his own reflection should have been.
“Harry your my best friend. Of course, I want to be a surrogate for you” Hermione smiled. “Viktor is desperate for number five too, he wants a full quidditch team.”
When Harry walked over he had a pleasant smile. He sat down beside Draco and held out a duffle bag. “Brought you a change of clothes, keys to my cousins place and a few things, and my Glasses” Harry said sliding it over.
“He does seem painfully thin” Draco agreed. “I’m going to apply for that pizza place downstairs earn some money.”
“You’re doing well, you’ll be fat fucking fielder in no time,” Dudley said slapping Draco’s gut. “You’ll be such a pig.”
Harry nodded, feeling like his chest was getting tight. Why was he starting to actually consider this fool’s errand? Despite everything, the whole premise of taking over Draco’s life… he was starting to entertain the notion. He must have been mental.
Draco walked inside, it was simple and pretty obvious that two boys were living there. Draco was aware that he was being watched. “I’m Dudley by the way.”
If Draco had it his way, he would go off and simply start his own life. He would just get a job and quietly fade out of his parents’ sphere of influence. And then, then! They could not say Boo to him about who he chose to fuck.
At this point in his life Harry was no longer uncomfortable with his sexual preferences for men, but he still felt some kind of way about Draco.
“Isn’t that how all good romances start” Jacinder replied. “You could always come to Kuwait with me. My family will fatten you up.”
“Yep,” Draco groaned honestly. “I had to finish five small pizzas” he groaned. “Apparently uncollected pizzas get eaten by the staff.
He toddled across the space to the bedroom area, still unsure about the unknown potion. But then as he began to feel rumbles in his stomach, decided to just chug it - and then he collapsed into the bed to snore peacefully to sleep.
“I’m going to work. Are you home for dinner” Dudley asked. His fat round belly exposed as he pulled on a white t-shirt to go under his overalls.
Draco understood Dudley’s rules. They were more for his benefit than Draco’s of course, given that Draco resembled Harry in every way. Largely they were to avoid any sexual aspects occurring in Dudley’s films. Draco didn’t quite get the point, after all, eating and being shamed about seemed hardly a lucrative market. But apparently, they were quite popular on certain parts of the internet.
“We need to work on your eating ability” Frank smirked prodding Draco’s belly. Or Harry’s belly, that smirk was for Harry.
“Just act like a lad” Dudley insisted. “Recording now,” Dudley said pressing a button on the camera.
The dessert course was truly his undoing, though - with chocolate molten cake, berry crumble, and lemon tarts. He watched helplessly as bite after decadent bite entered his mouth - and then he swallowed, and felt a rush of pain and tightness at his belly.
Draco tried not to stare, partially the fear of being caught out by Hermione. Was more than enough to frankly push him close to wetting himself. Out of anyone she was bound to see through his impersonation.
"This will never do," Lucius hissed, and as Narcissa tried to take his hand, he scowlingly leaned away. "The boy is far too soft for his own good. He needs to come to terms with his nobility. It does not do for him to gallivant about with fey young things like that."
“It’s Flemish. Believe it or not, my family is from Belgium, not France as people commonly assume. It’s like a gap year. My father forced me into it after being caught with one of our servants” Draco sighed tiredly. “Mother is having a fit and wants me back in the manor in secret. I feel caught between their two wills and I need a break”
Draco waited patiently sipping a vodka soda occasionally stirring the wedge of lime with a straw. Potter did look quite wonderful like that, thin and bony.
“…It’s not about it being the help,” Draco accused, his temper clearly rising. His face was turning as red as a tomato. “It’s about it being a *man.* I bet you wouldn’t bat an eye if I went for Donna or Sonia.”
“No, No it’s all good” Frank reassured, “It’s more a social thing? If you wanted to hang out after work tomorrow. Go to the pub? Have a few drinks?”
Given Harry’s silence, Narcissa began to uncharacteristically fill the silence. “Draco, my boy - I have seen your art journals. Your fascination with… what are those Japanese wrestlers called?”
He did take the potion offered by Draco, measured in advance to the correct specifications, and sighed.
And so, he set to work - destroying the better part of whole roasted goose, several generous helpings of potatoes, and generous latherings of gravy.
Harry’s mouth formed into a soft oval of surprise. “So you are one of us,” Harry observed, and he instantly felt more knobby and lanky and unattractive.
“Do not worry,” Narcissa beamed, “I can have them all down here for you, too. Now that you know that I know. I love and accept you for who you are, my child - and I have always known you were destined for more greatness than could be contained in your lithe little body. If only because I saw the light constantly dim in your eyes every time your father chastened you for taking even the tiniest step towards indulging your appetite.”
Dudley shifted, “Yeah. I record videos of myself and sell them on the internet. Mostly of me eating and playing with my belly” he said quietly. “Harry preferred not to ask. But I figured with a new roommate I should give you the heads up.”
