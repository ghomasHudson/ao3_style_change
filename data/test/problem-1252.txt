Ron took a deep breath, and started speaking. “So, the whole thing is going to be them killing a beast in the woods, which is bad enough, right?” Draco nodded. “Well, the kicker is that they can’t kill one they’re familiar with, like at all. I know they said something else, but the spell Hermione got me started to wear off, so I couldn’t hear anything else.”
“No,” Hermione sighed with disappointment. “No, it's pronounced as-guard, not ass-guard, Ronald. And it's basically Olympus, but like its own separate world.”
Using a small magical horn made by the Hecate cabin and stolen by the Hermes cabin, Harry was able to allow his friends hear everything that was being said at the campfire. Well, almost everything, it had some static. Apparently, the big hairy man had lost a spear. The guy with the fedora, which Ron thought was lame, reported a man outside his base. He wasn’t sure if the horn was broken or not, but he couldn’t tell if the base was in the US, Russia, or Norway. He heard all three countries. Then the fedora bloke went into a monologue, which was exactly when the horn decided to stop working.
Hope you like it!
The sphinx now looked slightly disappointed. “Yes, the caller was human.”
“Well, where did they say they were going to explore? The pass, right. Do you know anything about it, Mione?” Ron asked.
Cedric gave out a sigh of relief, and gathered the other into a tight hug.
“Wrap it around your weapons until it won’t come loose. I put a protection charm on it, so it will at least keep you safer than most. With the creatures, use your weapon for the Norse ones, but ours are a bit different. They’re more designed for magic, so you’re going to have to use your brain if you come across one. That is all the help I can offer you.”
They proceeded to say goodnight and walked off to their respective cabin. The tension didn’t dissipate, rather it stayed and lingered. Then it expanded, almost like red smoke.
“So, whoever has the spear now could rule this Assguardy place, right?” Harry asked.
“Um. . . ok. . . do I get any hints? I mean,” he chuckled, “I do have at least one head injury over here.” The sphinx regarded him for a moment, before responding that he was allowed two hints.
“What do you mean?”
He looked around a bit, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes before attempting to stand up. He discovered he couldn’t, and looked down. On his thighs lay the head of one extremely beautiful boy, light brown hair dusting across his face and his bottom lip pushed out slightly in a pout.
Hi all of you, this is our first fanfic ever, we hope you like it! We will put the trigger warnings in the notes when it is relevant. Just some info if parts of it confuses you, in this universe, all gods of all religions exist and there are schools all over the world for each religion or mythology. The camp is now a camp and a school where it teaches survival along with the basic necessities, and they have the option of staying over the summer and winter. Students can arrive early to the camp, but it becomes mandatory for what would be their sixth grade year. Thank you guys again for reading!
Cedric sighed. “You know I can’t give you what you might want, right?”
“Hmmmmm. . .” It tapped it’s claw against the ground, almost rolling it’s nails. “There is no one around.” Cedric was confused. “Around the building, his life, or. . .” he trailed off when seeing its smug expression.
“True, he might not want to tell us, it probably traumatized him. I heard that they were close. Blaise told me.” Hermione said sadly.
“Was the scream. . . fearful? As in,” he rushed out to clarify, “Was the caller. . . human?”
“Sounds like a cheerful bloke,” Harry said.
Cedric began to lean in, as did Draco. They both moved slowly, always giving time for the other to back out at any moment, but neither doing that. Their noses brushed against each other, both eyes now looking at lips, their smiles now dropped and mouths parted, completely in the moment. Their lips were barely brushing, touching, but not quite there, when a horn was suddenly ringing through the school.
“Oh that. That’s my bracelet.”
Not being able to help himself, he sprang up and shoved past the pair, angrily muttering, “Every time,” under his breath. He left the bracelet where it was on the floor, happy to let it go. The other two just watched him walk away, both confused, but one with a layer of anger.
The plan went well. The only hiccup being the excruciating pain of jumping off and landing on a broken foot, of course. The bilgesnipe quickly turned around to face Cedric and charged. Cedric forgot the plan and moved on pure instinct. He picked up the hilt, turned around, and drove the sharp metal into the beast’s mouth.
“Maybe a fighting tournament?” Harry asked.
The contesters all looked at each other and shrugged, for it seemed simple enough, albeit a bit dangerous.
Harry thought, but he had speed walked too far away to hear. Then he just kept walking. He walked past the volleyball nets, past the cabins, past the Big House, and finally to the edge of the forest. While he was walking, he thought. He thought about what almost happened before Diggory showed up. He thought about wanting to annihilate Cedric. He thought a lot about his sparring session with Draco. Not necessarily about what they did during the duels but about his sparring partner. No matter how weird he thought this was, he couldn’t take his mind off of Draco. The way his eyes shined, the way he moved when he fought, he slim but muscular physique.
“And you didn’t think that the bracelet could belong to the only child of Persephone, whose mark is of pomegranate seeds? You didn’t think to ask someone who it might belong to?”
“Look, I’ve got something to tell you. It’s about the trial.”
Mr. Black looked over them, before continuing.
He spent a good five minutes trying to figure out any part, taking apart the pieces and putting them back together, but none of it made sense.
Hermione raised her hands, defensive. “I know, Ron. I’m just saying why to Harry.”
He started to raise his voice. “You didn’t think that the owner, whoever it may be, was looking high and low for it, because it was the only gift he received from his birth mother?! You just-” His voice broke off, as tears started to seize his throat.
“If this weapon is so important that they have to come over here to ask our help, it's probably a god who owns it, so…”
“Maybe Odin’s a camper?” Harry suggested, scratching his head. “I mean, it's a weird name, but maybe?”
“He had an affair with Persephone while my mother was pregnant, and I ended up on his doorstep shortly after. I think. . .” Draco paused. “I think he knew who my mother was, he seemed to automatically know how to send me to school as soon as he could, and mother said that there wasn’t a letter on how to do it.”
He wandered off to his cabin, head hanging low. Harry and Hermione just stood there, Hermione still a little hurt. They didn’t know what to say. They stood there in silence for a few moments, Harry fiddling with something in his pocket and Hermione kicking a rock on the ground.
Everyone’s faces were grim, and he remembered that this was going to be the most dangerous of tasks. No one knew yet, but the smell of dread compounded the Mess Hall, and brought down his good mood rapidly. Even Mr. Black was solemn.
he told himself.
“Maybe we should go to bed,” Harry said. “We can tell the others the stuff later.”
“No, the big hairy one’s the leader,” Hermione said. “Helgi, I think.”
Both boys grinned, before Ron’s sobered.
“Good, you’re up,” she said. “Take deep breaths next time.” Then she ran into the bushes and out of sight.
The beast kept running, but tripped, let out a roar of anguish, and crashed Cedric and itself into a tree. The pain from the sword wound, which had been driven deeper into the mouth from the crash, caused the beast to roar and whimper, until it eventually dissolved into a pool of shadow. All that was left was the shattered hilt, a massive antler, and Cedric, who had crashed hard and was passed out.
6 o’ clock. A conch horn sounded and Cedric ran into the forest. Soon he lost sight of the others and found himself completely alone. He didn’t feel alone, though. He felt like hundreds of eyes were watching his every move. Just to be safe, Cedric drew his sword. It didn’t make him feel much better, but it would help if a monster found him.
“I’ve already talked to Viktor, and he knows how to kill our creatures along with yours. Do you know how to kill his and mine?”
“Now now, Mr. Diggory, me answering that would be your last hint. Are you sure you want that answer?”
“Not at the moment, but I can probably find something out by dinner tomorrow?”
It smirked. “My my, that was a bit quick, don’t you think? Well, it doesn’t matter to me.”
But as he held the other, Cedric came to a definite conclusion, that honestly he should’ve seen coming. He was falling for the blonde, and fast. Not in love, but it could be that, with time. He shook it out of his head for the moment. It could wait until morning, or never if Draco wasn’t comfortable with it.
“Ok, I would like my first hint.”
He looked up at the older boy with watery eyes. “Is it sick that I still love him? He’s my father, he should love me!” His voice cracked as tears started to stream down his face.
He looked extremely guilty. “I mean, partially. I figured it out, but you have to know, I was the one there, I was the one helping him before Mr. Lupin got to him, and besides, it was his story to tell.”
“I’m going to bed. I have a headache.” Noticing Hermione’s hurt face, he quickly added on, “Not because of you, Mione, just all of it.”
“Draco, about yesterday. . .” Cedric began. Draco’s cheeks turned a deep color of embarrassment, and he started to get up and walk away, before Cedric grabbed his wrist.
He was suddenly spun around, and before he could react, he saw Draco grab the back of his neck and haul him down. His lips planted on Cedric, a bit rough, but not so that it hurt. He was surprised, not even registering it for the first few seconds, but when he did, it felt like magic sewing them together. Coming about himself, the older boy dragged the younger nearer by the waist,wrapping his arms around him in a tight embrace, and deepened the kiss. It was an act of longing and wanting to be close to each other. The kiss was filled with desperation and something almost like love. It was chaste, but deeper than an ocean, with them not needed to go further to convey their feelings for one another. Cedric felt explosions behind his eyes. Breaking away, their eyes stayed closed, as they remained in each other’s arms.
The other two still looked furious, but accepted the answer. The trio knew that there was much to be talked about later, but at this moment, they needed to listen to the rest of the conversation.
Before the beast could turn him into a grease spot, Cedric dove to the side. The bilgesnipe crashed into a tree and ripped it out of the ground, roots and all, while clearly not being deterred. It charged at him again, but Cedric was ready. He ran towards the beast, jumped over it, and aimed a strike downward. It connected, but the only thing he accomplished was shattering his sword. Then he felt his leg connect with the hard scales of the beast, and he tumbled to the ground.
“Yeah, probably, you’re right,” Harry stopped talking and the group continued to listen.
Draco’s sobs were racking through his body as Cedric held him tight. He shushed him soothingly, pressing feather soft kisses into his hair and rubbing his back. As he broke down further into his arms, Cedric realized that he might have never actually dealt with his feelings of his father in this way. Yes he might have told Riddle about the abuse, but possibly not his own feelings about his father, if you could even call this man a father at this point.
“What’s the Die-at-love Pass?” Harry asked.
“Draco, I’m so sorry, I have to go,” Cedric began, his eyes pleading for the blonde to understand.
“They wouldn’t have come over here for a camper’s spear, Harry,” Hermione said. “Maybe we can ask around? Whoever this Odin is, they're probably pretty important to the camp. Maybe Helgi’s boss? That name sounds familiar.”
“Well, now to tell you why we brought the camps together,” The trio leaned forward eagerly. “We, the leaders of each camp, have decided that it’s time to issue a quest.” The three began to breath heavily, their excitement reaching its peak. “A quest to find and retrieve Gungnir, Odin’s Spear.” Then the trio’s excitement flattened out.
“Anyway, he. . . he likes to do it where no one would see it, most of the time, he used his hands. But mother finally left him about a year and a half ago, and he started to use a belt. Always told me if I didn’t my sisters would get it worse.”
Cedric woke up. It wasn’t much darker than it was when he met the harpy and passed out. Standing next to him was Fleur. She was chanting something and she held some sort of glowing boomerang. She stopped chanting when she saw he was awake.
There was a beat, then-
“So… we just don’t say anything, then?” Harry asked. “Wait until he says something, if he ever does?”
Ron gave him a deadpan stare. “I saw you and Diggory sleeping in the Arena. And I’m pretty sure both of you confessed either that night or this morning, by how happy you were coming out of there. So I’m just saying, you might want to give him a proper goodbye, because he might not survive.”
Sorry if it feels rushed. This is just barely the beginning, though, so hold on tight!
“Ass-guard?” Ron asked. Harry giggled.
It was finally a couple minutes before the start of the trial, and Cedric was a bit nervous that he hadn’t seen Draco, as silly as it was. Did he regret it? Was he suddenly turned off on the idea of dating someone who was asexual? Was he too old for him?
When Draco woke up, he had a cold nose, a stiff back that needed to be cracked, and an arm that had fallen asleep.
“Wait ,just. . . just sit, it’s my turn to talk.”
Cedric began to panic. He knew he wouldn’t be able to avoid being bulldozed; his foot was killing him! He had no weapon, so another strike wasn’t an option, especially with seemingly impenetrable scales. That left charmspeak, but Cedric wasn’t sure. He had no idea if this creature was immune to magic, or had some of its own. What if it made it more mad, or simply didn’t work? He would be flattened, that’s what.
“Last night, some. . . things. . . were brought to light to me. But I don’t want them to ruin anything,” he rushed out, barely taking a breath to continue. “Draco, I like what we have now, but I want them to be,” he finally looked back at the blonde, who was shocked, but had a distinctly hopeful expression, “more.”
There was a small awkward silence, with both boys wanting to fill it but not being sure of how to go about it. But soon it faded away, and they smiled at each other, the tension dissipating.
It took around another ten minutes for the older boy to wake up, and when he did, he was treated to a soft looking Draco gazing down on him. They held the stare for a bit, both basking in the glow of the morning sunlight that was streaming into the Arena.
“Okay, children, it’s time for your last trial. After this, we will be announcing who the other three of you will go.”
“I. . . I would like my second hint, please.”
Ron just shook his head.
“I don’t know, maybe the horn is cutting out,” Hermione suggested.
Cedric was very relieved, but he could feel his control over the monster breaking. If he wanted to survive, he’d have to move fast. He eyed his sword hilt, still connected to some sharp, shattered metal. His plan was to sever his control over the beast, jump off it’s head and launch himself over to the hilt. It wasn’t a full plan, a well thought out plan, or a very good one, to be honest, but Cedric didn’t have another. He severed the connection and jumped from the beast to the sword.
“I thought you said you could listen in, mate!” Ron whispered.
When they separated, Fleur took Cedric aside.
He scanned, looking for the bright blonde hair, but found him talking to one of the redheads. He couldn’t see which Weasley brother it was, but they seemed to be telling him something important. Cedric just hoped to see him before the event began.
Sorry for the really late update, we write the chapters everyday, so this one has been done for quite some time. I (Kat) totally forgot the day of the week, and it was my turn to update. Sorry about that guys! Also, TW: implied/referenced child abuse
Cedric looked at the angry form of the black haired boy.
Scratching his head, Harry thought back to the blonde’s little duel with Ron, where he noticed it on the floor. He told Draco as much, with a questioning tone.
“Yeah, he seems a bit careless, but you’re sure I wasn’t bothering you two? He kinda stormed off once I walked in,” Cedric said, nervously playing with his hands.
Cedric said something else,
“Sex, Draco. I can do with affection and kisses, but I can’t. . . do stuff, I don’t want to. Ever.” Draco looked at him fondly and cradled his cheek. “And I’m alright with that. I don’t need to have sex, hell, the thought repulses me right now. But a life without sex, I can do that.” He ginned shyly. “You’re worth it. You’re worth everything, and you deserve everything.”
The sphinx smiled, which looked very strange and wrong on it’s cold, severe face. “Well done, Cedric Diggory, you have answered correctly. As a reward, I shall lead you from the forest”.
“Now obviously, if they are about to kill you, please do kill them, but if you kill one of your own, it will not count.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco suddenly felt sick to his stomach. “Wh. . . why are you telling me this? What does this have to do with me?”
As he worried about, he didn’t catch the blonde boy stomping up with a glint of determination in his eyes.
The challengers lined up on the edge of the forest. For the last two trials, the spectators had been cheering loudly, but this time things were different. Each person there sensed an evil presence. The woods had been stocked with monsters for this trial. The rules were simple, go into the forest, kill a monster, and leave if you could. However, you had to kill a monster that was unfamiliar to your camp’s culture. For example, the Camp Half Blood kids couldn’t hunt Greek monsters.
“Yeah, maybe, so they can see who kills monsters the best.” Hermione said.
“Here’s the catch,” Mr. Black interrupted. “You will not be able to kill any from your own ‘myth’. For example,” he stood a bit straighter, and pointed to one from Camp Valhalla, “she will not be able to kill a bilgesnipe, nor will he,” he pointed to and Ares kid, “be able to kill a minotaur.” All their faces paled.
The mix of different creatures gave off a sinister aura, like the woods now had teeth, like the trees had claws. No one wanted to enter the woods, but it was required for the trial, and Mr. Black threatened to throw in whoever didn’t voluntarily go in. As soon as the clock read 6, the challengers would be released. Yes, 6 in the evening. Not only would this make it more difficult to find and be prepared to fight a monster, but it would also be scary as hell. According to Cedric’s watch, there was one minute left.
Cedric remained silent.
“No, I’m sure he just got nervous and didn’t want to bother us,” Draco said, knowing that Harry really was mad. “He’s a little awkward, that’s all.”
“Who’s Odin?” asked Ron. “Is he their leader?’
“Maybe. We’ll see.”
“This one will be especially dangerous. As you know, we have no shortages of beasts and creatures in our forest. We will be adding to that, a few more that belong to the Greeks, and a good amount from the Egyptian and Norse ‘myths’.” He put quotation fingers when saying myths. “So your trial for today is to go into the woods and upon the first creature you find, you will kill it.”
“I want to tell you something.” Draco said quietly, hesitant to break the contentment of the moment. They shifted a bit, leaving just enough of their bodies touching for Draco’s head to remain on the other boy’s shoulder. “I know that you were told by Mr. Lupin to watch me, but I’m fairly confident that you won’t tell him anything I wouldn’t want him to know. But, before you leave, I do want you to know something about me. I. . . I’ve only told Riddle before.”
“Stop! They’ll hear us!” Hermione whispered loudly. She tried to grab it out of his hand and Harry tried to keep it to himself. They briefly wrestled for it, resulting in Hermione falling backwards and Harry dropping the horn, which turned back on.
“Yeah, Ron and Draco won’t react well.”
Finally, it was Harry who broke the silence.
“Ron, we don’t even know if the world is in danger,” Hermione said.
“Where did you get that?” he asked, his voice slightly trembling.
Draco smiled, taking peace in the utterly content look upon Cedric’s face, and began to stroke his hair absentmindedly.
It adjusted, getting into a position that Cedric would relate to a lion being ready to pounce. “Would you like to ask a question, or get a hint in general?”
“Yes, yes, and no, Ronald,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “He’s not the god of lightning, but the god of wisdom, war, and death.”
His voice took a cold turn, as frosty as the winters up in Russia could be, and he spoke slowly, dragging out each word.
The warm moment was broken by the eventual need to stretch, lest their joints fuse together.
“Thank… you.” Cedric called to her, though he was sure she couldn’t hear him.
The blonde’s head shot up, then his whole body moved. He heard a very familiar voice, one that just happened to belong to a very handsome 17 year old boy. Draco turned away from Harry like he wasn’t there and walked towards Diggory.
He gave a lasting kiss to Draco’s knuckles, before jogging away, trying not to get in trouble with not being in his cabin. The blonde just watched him go, a dopey expression upon his face.
He decided to try to figure out what she meant by the man being alone. Alone in what way? That could be pulled any which way, but none of which made sense for him to scream at a phone call.
“It was his mistake, so why does he hate me so much? Why do I still love him? I want it all to stop, I’ve
“Okay. . . tell me.”
The sphinx then disappeared into a pile of golden sand, which began to stir. Cedric knew what would happen next. He had seen it once before, when the Egyptians first entered the camp. Their weird sand portal things. Soon the sand turned into a swirling golden vortex, just big enough for Cedric to fit into. Without hesitation, he walked straight into the vortex, his vision faded to black, and he began to feel suffocated in the darkness.
And found him something did. Cedric heard a rustling sound behind him, in the trees. He turned around slowly, so as not to hurt his foot, and saw something very strange. It was a weird creature. It had the body of a lion, eagles wings, and most disturbingly, the face of a young woman. Cedric backed away. He knew what this was. Fleur told him. It was a sphinx. They were supposedly good, but could be violent if their riddles were answered incorrectly. This one seemed friendly, well not friendly, but it didn’t seem violent. It looked like it was studying him, and when the two made eye contact, Cedric could swear he felt the monster looking into his soul.
TW: mentioned attempted sexual assault
He gave a soft smile. “It’s not your fault. Go, I’ll meet up with you before the trial begins, I think the younger ages are able to watch this one.”
“Ok, ok. So, he went to commit suicde, the phone rang, and he screamed. Got it.” Racking his brain, he knew he heard something along the lines of that riddle many years earlier, but it was too fuzzy to keep a good grasp upon.
Until he got to the tables.
Draco's face flushed as he started to wave his arms in front of his face as a negative response. “No! We had just finished practicing for tomorrow. I’m just. . . a bit worried about him, you know?” He shrugged and sighed. “He doesn’t seem to take this seriously - his
Harry thought.
They both looked away, expressions filled with disappointment.
“Look, I don’t know how to respond to what you told me. It’s not my place, because feelings aren’t rational all the time, and for me to offer what my feelings towards the matter are saying, it just wouldn’t be right.”
They took a seat against the wall of the Arena, Draco’s shoulder resting next to Cedric.
Confused, Harry turned around, and saw what Draco was talking about. A beautiful but simple gold bracelet, with what looked like a six petaled red flower, but up close, were pomegranate seeds.
“Exactly, you didn’t think! You never do!”
“Am I allowed to ask questions, or would that be considered a hint?” “It would be a hint.” “Ok, in that case, I’m going to asume, not ask, assume, that the phone ringing is why it jumped. And since you said that it was in order, he didn't know why he was being called. . .”
The statement did little to calm them, especially Harry and Cedric. Harry because he finally realized how much danger he was actually in, and Cedric because he wanted to live long enough to go on a date with Draco.
“You know,” Fleur started to say, “I hope it’s both of you.” Her voice was quiet, and her already heavy accent became even thicker with the emotion she was letting through. “You two would be. . . the most preferable.” Both boys smirked, and the three of them stopped and hugged. It was small, just a goodluck, don’t die hug, but they all knew how important that moment was for them.
Something caught Draco’s eye, just in the peripheral. It was a little ways behind the other boy, glinting gold and red.
“If he doesn’t say anything, then this isn’t our business, and we should drop it.” Ron said a bit aggressively, raising his voice slightly.
“Don’t die,” Draco mumbled against his lips, before tugging himself out of Cedric’s grasp.
“Ask a question.”
“Weasley.”
He walked out, getting ready to watch the final trial, and excited to see Cedric.
They waited for a good ten minutes before they felt it was safe to continue conversation.
“How do we tell him we know?”
Unless. . .
He looked at his surroundings. He was leaning against a tree, there was what looked like a cave to his left, and a dark group of trees to the right. He decided to go to the right. He heard there were dragons in the caves, and he had no idea what else was added recently that would have the strength to overpower the dragons and take the caves. Anyways, he slowly walked to the right, ready to kill.
The group sat there quietly for a moment. The horn told them that Lupin said one student from every school would go on the quest to retrieve it, somewhere in the… uh, the… Die-at-love Pass?
He stomped off to his cabin and laid down.
“Very well.” Its eyes glinted. “What do you want?”
Cedric walked down with Viktor and Fleur, Harry hung a bit behind, staying close with Mr. Lupin and Mr. Black. None of them talked, the only noise came from the younger years who were already there to watch.
What if the creature meant that there was no one around on the earth. He would’ve been the last person on the planet. But that meant whatever called him could or could not be human. So it would depend on what kind of scream he let out.
“Yes, you were Ron, but what about us? He probably wanted to tell us in his own time, and the fact that we now know isn’t the best. Plus, if we told him we knew, it would be springing it on him before he was even ready.” Hermione was ever the voice of reason, and another silence ensued.
“Um, hi, uh, what’s your name?” Cedric asked. If there was any chance the creature wouldn’t attack, maybe being polite would make that chance higher?
“Wait a sec,” Hermione gasped. Then she closed her eyes. Harry and Ron could tell she was doing very deep thinking. “THAT'S IT!” she yelled. Harry and Ron immediately shushed her. “I read about this a few weeks ago! Odin’s the main god of the Norse, kinda like Zeus!”
“Well, it just means that whoever has it has a certain degree of power over the other gods of Asgard, ASGARD, not Assguard,” Hermione was getting tired of having to pronounce it.  “It makes the wielder more powerful, basically.”
“Oh, thank you!” Cedric said, grateful he wasn’t about to be attacked.
“I mean, I’m pretty sure sure he knows I know, I mean I was bloody right there!” Ron whisper-shouted.
“Yes Ron,” Hermione sighed. “In simpler terms than I would use, but yes.”
Cedric chuckled a bit. “Yeah, he can be, from what I know of him.”
Draco nodded at that, just wanting to escape the memory of him literally crying himself to sleep.
Cedric started walking, making sure to look around for trouble. Suddenly, he heard something from a nearby bush. He walked towards it, raising his sword, preparing to strike. Nothing happened.
“Ok, then. I - I figured it out!” the boy cried out cheerfully. “The man screamed because he thought he was the last man on earth, so when the phone rang after he committed suicide, he realized that he wasn’t the last man on earth, meaning he could’ve has company!”
(See the end of the chapter for
He quickly sat down next to Fleur, who had saved him a seat since he was the last one who needed to join.
"Perhaps," Severus said non-committally, "I will discuss it with her when she returns from France this evening; perhaps we should owl her to return now instead?"
"I need something to put Draco's birthday gift in," Hadrian replied, "Also, I was having another gift delivered-do you know if it has arrived yet?"
“Tonight was a success,” Draco announced, and the workshop erupted with cheers, “For the second year in a row, we have brought a little light into the lives of those who need it most. I already have many ideas for the coming year, plans to make our North Pole even better than it is now…” Draco’s stormy blue eyes never once looked away from Harry as he gave his end of the year speech, and Harry found himself trapped in that gaze.
“Draco?” He questioned, his voice raw from screaming out his pleasure, “Why do you feel so much bigger?”
"Oh, yes," Elena replied, "My younger brother Alec will be here next year though, and then Jasper will be here the year after. Lily said you have plans for improving the wizarding world; I'd like to hear them, if you don't mind." Tom's expression became excited, but the memory faded out before he started to speak.
“You say that like you expect an argument from me,” Hadrian laughed, taking Draco’s hand and walking towards the door, “I already told you, the only reason I didn’t tell Pansy about being mates is because I wasn’t sure if you wanted me to. Oh, I guess I should call Tillie to take down the ward. Tillie!”
Hadrian picked up the shovel, which had been wrapped in another blanket, along with the axe-Hadrian had thought that this would lessen the chances of him being injured by the two tools if they got thrown during the explosion-and used it to move some of the debris out of the way. For the first time in his life, he thanked the fact that he was used to hard work from the Dursley’s; he was much stronger than he looked and was able to clear a path in a matter of minutes.
"Okay Draco; I'm ready," he said, "Where are we having tea?"
"At the end of school," Draco smirked, "Mother bought it for me to cheer me up after
“Hadrian gifted it to him for his birthday,” Narcissa replied, “He found it in a shop in Diagon Alley.”
"What kind of forfeit?" Hadrian asked suspiciously.
"Because I'm afraid something bad will happen and I won't be there to protect him," Draco replied. He was silent for a moment, internally debating something, before asking, "Fred-can I trust you with a secret?" Draco wasn't sure why, but he trusted the red-haired twins; maybe it was because he could see how deeply they cared for Hadrian, as if the brunet was a younger brother. Regardless, he decided that he would divulge his secret. "I know you'll tell George, and Hadrian will find out soon any way, but I would like to keep what I am about to tell you a secret from others for the time being."
Just before midnight, something snapped Harry out of his depressing thoughts, and he firmed his resolve; he would take the Knight Bus to Grimmauld, and at least see if he was wanted. If he wasn’t wanted, he would at least stay through Christmas Day, and then he’d go to Diagon Alley, buy the trunk, and camp out in the Dursley’s shed.
After pulling himself out of the stream a disgruntled Harry found himself a clearing where he could lay in the sun until his fur dried. He drifted in and out of sleep for a few hours, until his stomach reminded him that he still hadn't eaten. Stretching, Harry recalled the manor he saw last night, and the turkeys in the yard; he knew it would be dangerous to get that close to other humans-other wizards-but by now he was so hungry that getting caught was only a secondary concern, at most.
“Um, I came to…er, to see if you’re okay,” Potter stammered, “You looked-well, you didn’t seem happy with the letter.”
December 17
"At Hadrian's birthday party, if not before," Draco replied, "If you see my parents, tell them that Hadrian and I will be out shortly-"
"Have you had a chance to look through the books we picked up from Gringott's yesterday?" Hadrian asked Tom.
Severus threw the scroll down with a sneer; Harry may be in trouble indeed!
"Just trying to keep things exciting," Draco teased, "I wouldn't want you to get bored now that we're married."
****************************
Draco rested on the bed until he got his breath back, then grabbed his wand and cast a quick cleaning spell on himself. He then stood up and approached Potter again, frowning when he saw that Potter was once again standing on his tip toes, the dildo having slipped back out an inch; Potter really didn’t know how to do this properly, did he? Draco went through a list of spells in his mind, until he settled on one that would work for the situation and cast it on the stool, smirking as he stepped back a few feet to watch Potter’s reaction to what would happen next.
"With the power vested in me by Merlin and the Ministry of Magic, I now pronounce you husband and wife, bonded for life; you may kiss the bride." There was loud applause as Tom leaned in to give Elena a sweet kiss, and when they broke away there was a faint blush on her cheeks. "I now present to you for the first time Mr. and Mrs. Tom Riddle! What Merlin has joined let no man part."
As soon as his fingers wrapped around the pale wood, Draco traced his wand through the air and cast a Patronus; for the first time, it was successful, and he watched in silent awe as a feathered serpent appeared. The serpent was only a few inches long at first, but it quickly grew until it was large enough to coil around Draco protectively. Once it realized there was no threat, the occamy faded away.
"Yes," Draco nodded, paling slightly, "There is Veela blood on both sides of my family; oh Merlin! You don't think that Potter is my-"
"Why not?" Hadrian grinned, "If it works, it works."
“I’m fine,” he said, “Still a little confused, I guess, but other than that…” He shrugged, “I’ve always known the Dursley’s weren’t nice people; this is just one more thing that they took from me. It’s nothing new, really.” Harry stood before his friends could reply, “I’m going to go check on the boys.”
“Harry is gone?” Dumbledore frowned in concern, “Are you certain he didn’t just wander off? Perhaps, now that he is feeling better, he decided that he no longer wishes to stay with the Malfoy’s.” Liar. Severus kept his face blank, but he knew without a doubt Dumbledore was lying; the old fool was behind Hadrian’s disappearance, and he obviously didn’t trust Severus any longer as he had not been advised of the plan.
"Whatever you say," Draco smirked, "Why don't you go take a shower; it's right through that door there." He nodded at the ensuite, adding, "And you can borrow some of my clothes for now too; if the rags you're wearing now are any indication we need to take you out shopping sooner rather than later."
"Er, yes? " Hadrian said uncertainly, “I think the…um, nargles have gone now.”
“I'm not a child and I don't need a map,” Hadrian protested.
"You cannot stop us," Tom said, "Not unless you plan to kill us all, women and children included."
Meanwhile, back at the shop...
They stopped talking as a new memory appeared, once again of the Sorting Ceremony. Tom and Lucius sat across from one another, and they were joined by Severus Snape, who took a seat beside Lucius. Harry noticed the young Slytherin looking longingly at the Gryffindor table-at his mother, Lily Evans.
“Dobby! Don’t!” Harry cried; he was too late, but the tower of hats protected Dobby from serious injury, so Harry hurried to speak; “Don’t punish yourself; it’s not your fault. Just-can you go back and tell everyone that I’m in one of the Malfoy propertie-” He saw Dobby trembling again, and knew that he was asking the House Elf for something else that he couldn’t do, “-er, can you just tell everyone that I’m safe for now?”
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry said earnestly, then watched as the headmaster left the attic. He listened as locks clicked into place and nodded; that confirmed his theory-he was a prisoner. Well, he couldn’t say he was surprised; despite what he told Dumbledore, he did actually remember the beginning of the summer. He recalled being beaten by Dudley and Vernon, and Dobby helping him escape. He remembered being caught by an unfamiliar House Elf-and that was the last clear thing he remembered before he found himself running through the forest. He could tell a large chunk of memories were missing, and he crossed back over to the wardrobe, hoping that Dobby would have some answers for him.
"Sounds like fun," Elena smiled, "Where should we meet, and when?"
"Look, I know Mum is slightly mad, but no way would she agree to let Dumbledore kill someone, not even for a daughter!" George protested, "Harry-this must be some sort of Death Eater plot; how can you believe this?"
“It is the type of childhood you should have had,” Draco pointed out, when Harry mentioned it, “If not for you being placed with the Muggles, it is the childhood you would have had. I cannot believe that there was not a single magical family Dumbledore could trust to keep you safe. I can understand wanting to protect a child from reporters and the like, but your childhood did not protect you, it left you not knowing how to deal with all the attention. I know he trusts McGonagall, and I am certain she would have taken you in. The headmaster has some sort of scheme in mind, and that is why he left you with the Muggles.”
Hadrian was just debating whether he should go to Draco’s room, when his door was pushed open and Draco’s form filled the doorway, glaring at him.
“Why would I do that?” Ginny asked, confusion in her brown eyes.
“Lots of fun!” Teddy confirmed, “Look! I made Santa! And a snowman! See my snowflakes?” Teddy shoved all the decorations in Draco’s direction, and the blond had to smile at the childish enthusiasm.
"Well, that was definitely not what I expected," Voldemort mused as he re-read the letter, "I wonder what that old fool has done now to turn the Golden Boy against him…Harry Potter is no longer fighting against me, which can only be good." He was silent for a moment as he thought things over; would having Harry Potter on his side help? It would definitely be a blow to Dumbledore, but there was always the possibility that this was a trap-no that made no sense at all. Just to be safe, however, he would locate Harry Potter, lure him into a false sense of security and then imprison him until he could figure out the best way to use the former savior's defection to his advantage. Having come to a satisfactory decision Voldemort allowed a slow smirk to light up his face as he turned to address the owl.
“How about a nap, and then we can go back to our rooms?” I suggest, and I can feel Draco nod.
"Fine," Narcissa snapped, upset at being undermined by her husband, "but I don't want to hear about any of the pranks, and if they get caught
“Draco! Oh, thank Merlin!” Harry threw his arms around Draco’s neck, nearly dunking them both back under.
At this point the wizard walked in front of Harry and he beheld the pale visage and silvery hair of Draco Malfoy, whose blue-grey eyes were full of curiosity and excitement rather than the usual disdain he showed for Harry. Then, those silvery eyes met his, and Draco froze, staring before his gaze slowly trailed up and Harry could tell the exact moment that Draco had spotted his marking by the way the blonde gaped and then slowly smirked. "Leave Wispy," Draco commanded, "I can take care of this-wait. Wispy, as Master here I order you to tell no one of this incident, do you hear me? If you breathe a word of this to anyone, you will get clothes."
“You utter prat!” Harry shrunk back against his pillows as Draco came at him furiously, “Do you know how worried I was! What were you thinking going through that fire alone-you could have died! You nearly did die, judging from the way you looked when Dumbledore brought you up to the hospital wing! You-argh!” Draco ran out of words, and resorted to punching Harry on the arm instead, making the brunet scowl.
“Yes,” Lily confirmed, “We promised that we would let him know as soon as anything changed over here, so James went to speak to him. Not everything is going well, and so you will likely have at least one new guest arrive in the next couple of weeks. You have a letter Cissa.” Narcissa looked down at her desk and saw that there was indeed a letter resting on the silver tray; when she picked it up she saw that it was from Augusta Longbottom.
"What was that?" Draco inquired, raising an eyebrow.
"I know you all heard about what happened," Tom began, "and how Hagrid was blamed for those attacks; well, I'm about to tell you the truth, but you have to swear an unbreakable vow not to tell anyone else." All of the students made the vow and then Tom continued; "It was my fault those students were attacked, and my fault that Myrtle was killed. I released Satomi and she attacked the students, but I did not do it willingly; just after the Holidays Dumbledore put me under the imperius curse because I refused to support his aims, and he told me to make Satomi attack students because he wanted everyone to see how evil I was. After Myrtle died I was supposed to let Hagrid discover me, but Myrtle's death was enough to help me break free of his spell, so I framed the stupid oaf instead."
“You liked it though,” Draco says confidently.
“I wonder how far you can travel using the mirror,” Hadrian mused, then shrugged, “Well, at least she got away from Brandon; I just hope that her-I mean our-grandfather will really help her.”
DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM
"Well...what will happen?" Hadrian asked nervously, "I mean...what am I expected to do?"
"I don't know what's happening Sev,” he admitted quietly, “Ever since I first realized the black tiger in my yard was Potter I just felt drawn to him…actually, I have always been drawn to him, ever since that first day in Madame Malkin’s, and the pull has grown stronger over the years. Today when I realized he was hurt, badly hurt, I realized that I wanted to protect Harry, and get revenge upon whomever did this to him. The thought of having to eventually turn him over to the Dark Lord makes my heart ache and the thought of anyone else touching him…" He let out a low growl and then looked over at Severus with wide eyes; "I don't know what's wrong with me Sev."
“I would like to offer you my assistance,” the Snow Queen said, once Harry fell silent, “What I did not tell you before, is that I am of the Fae; our magic is different from that of Witches and Wizards, more based in nature. At certain times of the year my power is stronger, and I am drawn to those who need my help. Most of the time I am called to help young children in abusive homes, but I am on occasion called to help someone older. Your pain and betrayal called me here this night.”
A few minutes later the boys were both back in Draco's room, lounging on the bed.
"And other members of the Oder of the Black Rose," Draco interrupted, startling Harry, who had become used to the blond’s silent presence, "Yes, Sev; I believe we were able to come to that conclusion ourselves." Draco smirked at the dark-haired man, earning himself a glare in return.
“I will go to see him after I speak with this group,” Tom said, “I know I am an evil dark lord, but it occurs to me that I should spend some time with my son if I don’t want him to kill me at an early age in order to take over my position.”
"Severus and I have already viewed these memories," Voldemort informed them as Severus added several memories to the stone basin, "so we shall wait here for you; some of what you see will be very upsetting, but you must not turn away-it is important." Harry and Draco both nodded warily, and Voldemort motioned for them to enter the pensieve. "Go on." Harry glanced at Draco hesitantly and the blonde offered him a small smile before plunging into the memories with Harry following a moment later.
I can feel your gaze upon my face
"Would you like me to tell them?" Draco offered, "I'm sure you're tired of repeating everything by now."
"Have you told Hadrian yet?"
“I never knew dragons could do that,” Draco looked at Arden curiously, “That’s a useful little trick.”
At Draco’s request, Harry described to him each time he had met Voldemort; as a parasite on the back of Quirrell’s head in First Year, as a memory with a killer basilisk in Second Year, and last year in the grave yard.
"All you have to do is seal it, then place it in the tray and it will be taken care of," Lucius replied, so Severus placed the parchment in an envelope and sealed it with the sealing wax provided; he pressed the Prince family ring into the wax and the letter immediately vanished.
"There's a family party?" Hadrian asked with surprise, "Um, okay; I'll save these-" he gestured to the dragon figurines on his desk, "-for when the guests get here. Can you get me something to put them in?"
Harry closed his eyes as he was sucked into the pensieve and didn’t open them until he felt something solid beneath him. Opening his eyes, he found that he and Draco had landed in the familiar Great Hall in Hogwarts, and they were standing in front of the head table. Looking around, Harry saw a familiar mop of dark hair and realized that they had arrived just in time to witness the Sorting of Tom Riddle.
“Great,” Harry grinned, “That means you can help us finish decorating, right Teddy?”
Hadrian glared at Draco for a moment, and silently acknowledged that Draco’s silver shirt and dark blue robes would clash with his own outfit, before sighing and snatching the clothes from his clothing-obsessed Veela. He quickly changed shirts, and then pulled the robe on over it all before crossing his arms and pinning Draco with a hard stare.
“Ask me about Mr. Malfoy,” Snape interrupted, “He is safe for now, and I am working on making sure he stays that way. There is nothing you can do to help, and you would in fact be nothing more than an inconvenience. If you truly wish for Draco to be returned safely, you need to stay out of my way. Have I sufficiently answered all of your questions?”
“He might,” Neville said, Hadrian scowled at the reply, which made Neville ask, “If you don't like Luna, why does Draco liking her bother you?”
Dumbledore had no warning before Tom, Lucius, Frank and Bellatrix jumped up and began shooting hexes at the people surrounding Dumbledore; during the distraction Narcissa grabbed Draco, Alice grabbed Neville, and Elena grabbed her two children; the jarring motions had awoken the children, and they were all crying. The women made a run for it, Narcissa in the lead, but they had forgotten about Pettigrew; he sent a stunner which hit Narcissa in the back, and she fell to the ground, losing her grip on Draco.
"Really? Hades? The god of the underworld?" Harry-or rather, Hadrian-pouted, "What did I ever do to you? Why not just call me 'Ri?"
"Go take a shower," Draco interrupted, abruptly letting go of Hadrian's hair and stepping away from the brunet, "I can't talk to you when you smell like her." He turned so that he was facing the window, purposefully not looking at Hadrian.
After that, Harry was determined not to touch the stool again, no matter how badly his feet hurt.
“Did you see the way your mom looked at the presents?” Harry asked.
The sound of a twig snapping jolted Hadrian out of his thoughts, and he took off again; now he remembered! He was supposed to be running! From whom, or where to he wasn’t sure, but Hadrian knew without a doubt that he had to keep running, and so he did.
“Well, if we ever need it now we have proof that Dumbledore left you there without any protection,” Draco commented as Hadrian set the letter aside, “I’ll bet that potion he gave them was the same memory potion he gave to everyone else.”
“Lady Malfoy,
“Hadrian?” Augusta Longbottom frowned, “Looks like Harry Potter to me. What are you playing at?”
“Mmm, Zabini,” I reply, “He was the one who told me where to find you. Somehow, this wasn’t what I expected when he told me you wanted to give me an early Christmas present.”
“That will be fine,” Draco agreed, “If we are as busy as yesterday, I likely won’t see you again until tomorrow. If you feel like getting up early again, we can meet somewhere for breakfast.”
Nodding to himself, Severus quickly went through the memories and placed the most important ones in a single vial, which he slipped into his pocket. He then packed the remaining vials of memories, carefully marking each on so that they could be readily accessed when the time came, and headed to his fireplace; he was one of the few who were allowed to Floo directly to the old Riddle Mansion without giving advance notice and now, if ever, was the time to take advantage of that. Severus had just grabbed a handful of Floo powder when green flames burst into life in his fireplace.
“Did you try calling Dobby?” Narcissa asked, and her husband nodded, “Did you try sending one of our elves to locate Dobby?”
I attended the trials to find closure
"Now that they are gone," Voldemort began, "We need to talk Severus. You and I both know that I am not exactly what I appear to be; it was Dumbledore who made me this way."
“Well…maybe I should ride with you,” Harry said slowly, “After all, Aunt Cissy is already mad at you Siri; if she finds out you didn’t make me ride in the side car, I might not have a godfather when she gets done with you.”
"Yes, well you are lucky you don’t have a punctured lung, although you did have some internal bleeding. It seems your magic was able to heal the most life threatening injuries, even with the suppressant, " Severus said drily as he handed him another potion, this one silver with flecks of blue in it, "This one will heal the outer wounds…" he paused for a moment to allow Harry to drink that one before handing him the final potion, which was a deep purple, "And this one will get rid of any infection." Harry quickly drank the last potion, gagging at the aftertaste.
“Actually, I think there might be just enough room,” Draco said, before glancing at Harry, whose breath caught at the heat in Draco’s grey eyes; was the blond actually choosing Harry over Blaise? “What do you say, Harry?” Harry pushed his disappointment away, as he realized Draco was just asking him if the sleigh had enough room for two. He briefly thought about lying but decided he didn’t want to be petty.
Unbeknownst to Harry, his silencing charm did not work as well as he thought it would. Draco Malfoy had been in his bathroom, getting ready for bed, when he heard a muffled moan. Holding himself still, the blond listened for it to come again, and realized that it came from the room next to him-Potter’s room. Draco quickly finished changing into his pajamas and went out into the common room to stand in front of Potter’s door, only to frown when he realized he couldn’t hear the moans anymore. Draco slowly made his way back to the bathroom and stood next to the wall; yes, he could hear the soft moans once more. Should he go get help? No, wait; Potter was speaking.
“Because,” Draco replied, “Even if we do not bond, it would still benefit you to know how to dance; whomever you eventually marry will certainly expect you to dance at least once, on your wedding day. Okay, that’s enough room; we’ll start without music. Come here.” Draco stood in the middle of the space they had cleared, and Harry joined him; Draco placed one of Harry’s arms around his neck and held the other hand within his own, while Draco’s free hand rested on Harry’s hip.
"Very good," Dumbledore nodded, "Molly, why don't you bring your new daughter over here so we can get started." Molly quickly complied, and soon she and Arthur were standing in front of Dumbledore, holding Lillian Potter between them.
“Yes, dad,” Dudley agreed, glaring at Harry, “Don’t worry; I’ll teach the freak a lesson.”
"It is difficult to learn if you are not born with the gift," Tom explained, "However I know Elena learned to speak it fairly well, so I believe you should be able to learn it as well."
"No," Hadrian replied, squirming uncomfortably, "Um, Draco, can you-"
“Huh,” Harry said, “So, since Kreacher passed away, I’m guessing Ginny must have cast the monitoring spell on our kids.”
But if they thought Harry felt the same Draco feared they were wrong
“Well, we should probably tell the kids first,” Harry said, “If everything goes well…how do you feel about getting married on the Winter Solstice?”
"You wish," Hadrian retorted, "Alright; I agree-the first person to catch the Snitch gets to claim a forfeit, and I hope you're ready to pay up Malfoy-I've never lost to you before and I don't intend to start now."
/////////
“Y-yes, of course, Albus,” Peter simpered, before leading the children to the Gryffindor table, where they were all settled with plates of food.
“If you mean my Frank and Alice, then you are wasting your time,” Augusta said matter-of-factly, “The best healers of our age have been able to do nothing for them.”
“About being Santa Clause?” Draco nodded, and Harry smiled, “It’s going to take time for me to get used to all this, but I think I’m beginning to believe you.”
"Torturing-?" Hadrian questioned and then shook his head, "Can't we just not think about them anymore? I really just want to forget I ever lived with them, especially now that I never have to go back."
"Fine," Hermione nodded, "Ginny! Give me the counter to the twin's sticky potion. Now!" She glared when the younger girl hesitated, and Ginny hurried to obey, glaring at Draco the whole time. Moments later Draco was free, and he sprang up to rip the other two boys apart, only to see Hadrian finally break free, knocking Ron back and jumping on him; now it was Hadrian's turn to beat Ron. "Malfoy! I thought you were going to stop them!" Hermione pleaded, looking at Draco with wide brown eyes.
“Whatever,” Hadrian rolled his eyes; he chose not to argue-or point out the fact that his sense of fashion had nothing to do with it, as Draco had been the one to pick out and reject the first two outfits, “What robes should I wear? The dark red ones?” Hadrian was wearing black slacks, black shoes, and a red shirt.
Harry was so busy planning his escape, that he didn’t realize his Dudley and his gang had come back outside until someone grabbed his arm.
"But your Mum said I could have my own room!" Hadrian protested, pulling Draco's hand down from where it had been covering his mouth, "And I think if your Mum gave me permission to call Til-mmph!" He glared as Draco slapped his other hand down to cover Hadrian's mouth again.
up.” Parkinson and Luna left, and Harry turned his attention back to Draco, who was eyeing him speculatively.
Draco kissed his way up Potter’s neck, to whisper in his ear, “I’m going to free one of your hands; your blindfold has been spelled on, so don’t bother trying to remove it. I want to watch you wank, and you’ll cum when I tell you to, understand?”
“Come along now, Harry dear,” Narcissa held out her hand, “Draco will be wondering what has taken so long.” Harry hesitantly placed his hand in hers, and allowed Narcissa to pull him into a hug before saying; “Hold tight, Harry.” Harry closed his eyes as the world went dark and he felt as if his body was being sucked through a straw; it was over in moments, and then Harry found himself standing in the entryway of a very large house.
“Well, our feelings for one another will greatly affect the ritual,” Draco informed him, “If we hold animosity towards one another the ritual will be greatly weakened, whereas if we have positive feelings towards one another, it will strengthen both our bond and the power of the ritual. If we are able to feed enough power into the ritual, it may destroy the Dark Lord without any further actions on our part.”
"Umm, I know that that originally come from Bulgaria," Hadrian frowned, "I saw them at the World Cup a few years ago; they're beautiful girls who have bird-like feature's when they get angry, and they have...I think Hermione called it an Allure, which makes males become attracted to them and act stupid. Hmmm...I always did wonder why Fleur didn't affect me the way she did Ron and the other guys..." Hadrian said this softly enough that only Draco heard him, and the blond replied by smirking and tightening his arm around the smaller boys shoulders, ignoring Hadrian's attempt to shrug him off.
“Because ‘Draco Potter’ sounds ridiculous,” Draco replied, “Now, why don’t we eat breakfast, and I can finally tell you about that dream I had? Since we’re going to be bonded, I think it is only fair that I tell you about some of my fantasies, and then you can return the favor.”
“I’m taller than you,” Harry could hear the smirk in Draco’s voice; he rolled his eyes, even as he smiled.
"From now on, Tom will be known as Lord Voldemort," Dumbledore announced, "Now, to adjust his memories."
"Why would you send him back there?" Remus demanded, eyes flashing to amber-a normal occurrence whenever he became emotional too close to the full moon- and a growl underlying his words, "He already ran away once; if we send him back he'll likely just run away again, and then he'll never trust any of us."
"Nah, it's no big deal," George waved his hand dismissively; "I mean, it's not like Voldie is still after you, right?" He turned to his brother, "You need anything while we're out?"
“Okay,” Harry agreed after a moment’s hesitation, “Just don’t break your promise, Professor.”
"Of course," Griphook agreed, taking the memories and tucking them carefully away, "In return, I have some items and information that may help you. Much of the information is Dark, and not fit for the ears of children. As young Mr. Riddle is underage, and his guardian is not here, I do require him to leave the room. I would suggest the young Mr. Malfoy leave the room as well."
“A sleeping potion would probably work better,” Ron said, “Winky would probably even help you with it. Let's wait till after the new year to try that though; in the meantime, you might as well take Blaise for his fitting.”
“The Keeper?” Draco offered with a smirk, “And the less powerful partner is the Chaser. Or,” his grin turned wicked, “Shall we call you the Snitch, and I’ll be the Seeker?”
Before he could try to work it out, the plug began vibrating again, and Harry decided he had more pressing issues to attend to. He reached down and grabbed his cock with one hand, the other bracing on the stool, and began tugging at it. He felt his please crest-and nothing. He was kept on the edge, crying in frustration as he fumbled with the cockring; he pulled it off as fast as he dared, and quickly began stroking himself, desperate for his release. The plug was once more directly stimulating his prostate, and Harry groaned as he felt his balls tighten-and then he screamed out his pleasure as his orgasm ripped through him. The pleasure was so intense Harry blacked out for a moment, and when he came to he was lying on the floor of the storage room, evidently having fallen off the stool. Harry lay there panting and catching his breath for what could have been a few minutes or an hour, only to cry out in surprise when the plug, which had fallen still sometime when he was unconscious-began vibrating again; Harry reached behind himself to pull it out, groaning as his tight passage reluctantly released the plug. He held it in one hand as he crawled to the shelves and pulled himself up on his knees; he was just barely able to reach his wand, and he cast a quick finite at all of his toys, followed by a cleaning charm for both himself and his toys, before collapsing on his back, exhausted. It was only at that moment that Harry realized he was still wearing the blindfold, and he wearily reached up to remove it, before sending a lazy spell at the torch on the wall, illuminating the storage closet with a muted orange light.
“Having an heir will make me happy,” Draco insisted.
“I suppose we should go back,” Draco conceded, “Mother and Father will be worried-I left Arden with Mother-and I cannot imagine Tom being happy with what just transpired. We will, however, be informing everyone that you are my mate so we don’t have any further incidents like this.”
Harry really didn’t want to sit on the stool again, but his legs were aching fiercely, and he needed a rest. This time he would be stuck for thirty minutes-until the release spell activated, actually-and he knew that the sitting down would be extremely painful before the time was up. It was a bad idea-very bad-but at the moment it seemed the lesser of two evils, so Harry took his place on the stool. As soon as he settled, the plug began vibrating again, and Harry moaned in a combination of pleasure and pain. A few seconds later he jumped-or tried to-as he felt a stinging hex on his ass; it was a weak hex, but Harry knew from earlier that it would just get worse.

"I'm sure there's no need to tell everyone that what's said here cannot be repeated outside of this room," Tom began, "We have put wards up to insure our privacy. We are here to set up an organization to fight Dumbledore's influence in the wizarding world. We have named our group the Order of the Black Rose, for black roses are symbols of death and rebirth-the death of an old way of life and the birth of new."
"Fine-we will be there as soon as we straighten our clothing," Draco informed the house elf, and Tillie vanished with another pop; "This has to be the worst birthday ever," Draco complained as he slid off of Hadrian and then helped the other boy to his feet, "I can't wait until everyone goes home and it is just us."
under the imperious; he will not keep us separated any longer!" He narrowed his eyes; Harry was his, and there was no way he would let a barmy old man-or anyone really, including Harry’s newly-discovered father-keep them apart.
“Sorry, Harry,” Draco said, opening his eyes to see green orbs filled with worry, “I had better go straighten this out. Jack Frost in a stop can cause a lot of damage.”
“You can still get off me now,” Hadrian said, and this time he succeeded in pushing Draco away so that he could sit up, “What time is it?” Draco lazily reached out his hand to summon his wand and then cast a Tempus.
"I'm just glad I have this now," Harry said, "You and the kids; you make me happier than I've ever been."

“It’s a twin orb,” Draco told him, “It is a Black Family tradition to give them to any twins born into the family; since Sirius was your godfather he must have had those made. Each orb is infused with the magic of one twin, and is then given to the opposite twin; it is one of the reasons twins are so in-tune with one another even when far apart. This particular magic only works for twins-it doesn’t work for regular siblings.”
"Yes!" Hadrian cheered, then he frowned when he tried to get up and Draco didn't loosen his grip; "Dray-what are you doing? Come on; let's go fly!"
“I thought we agreed to call each other by our given names,” Harry pointed out.
“I’m fine,” Hadrian replied, “It’s just…do you really think Aracely is okay? I didn’t like that Matt guy, and Brandon seemed like a real asshole.”
“Mother, Father; Why are you here?” Draco looked at his parents curiously.
“Bloody Potter,” he muttered, as he changed for bed, “Always has to muck things up.” Even as he grumbled, however, Draco realized what an opportunity this was; he had never quite forgotten his dreams of becoming friends with Harry Potter and now, thanks to his mother, he finally had a decent chance at making his childhood dreams come true. Already, this was shaping up to be a rather promising Christmas.
"Okay," Draco agreed, "Just…hurry!" Just then Severus realized he had forgotten to ask an important question.
"Everything is fine now," Draco said, "Although I would recommend keeping Pansy away from us for the remainder of the evening." He scowled at the thought of the Slytherin girl, and for a moment his eyes-which had returned to normal before they came downstairs-flashed silver.
"Draco," Hadrian sighed, "Your guests will be wondering where you are."
And doubts fade away
“Sure thing, Santa,” Bernard agreed, “Just don’t take too long. None of this will matter if Jack destroys the North Pole.”
"You're right-they do work better," Draco agreed, "By the way, has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes? They really sparkle when you laugh." Hadrian blushed and looked away from Draco's intense gaze; "You look cute when you get embarrassed like that too." The blond smirked as Hadrian glared at him, his cheeks even redder now.
The rest of the day passed in a similarly busy manner for Harry. There were always kitchen mishaps which caused the House Elves to panic, at least one reindeer tended to act out, the naughty and nice list was forever being misplaced, and, on occasion, Jack Frost and his snow imps showed up to cause mischief wherever they could. Then, when Blaise finally made his appearance, the second-in-command seemed to thrive on countermanding Harry’s orders, meaning Harry had to work twice as hard just to keep everything running smoothly. By the time the supper bell rang, and everyone got ready for Santa’s send-off, Harry was ready to rip his hair out-or hex Blaise and Jack Frost; maybe banish them both to somewhere far away. Honestly, this was only their second year having the North Pole operational, and Blaise was more of a hindrance than a help. As for Jack Frost, Harry had no idea where he came from; he suspected Frost was either a Veela or George Weasley in disguise. Harry was betting on the latter.
"Do we really have to?" Hadrian asked, "I really don't like shopping for clothes; can't I just owl order whatever you think I need?"
Before Hadrian could reply to that, Arden chirped again, patting Hadrian’s face until the brunet turned to look at him. Once he did so, he found himself trapped in glowing sapphire eyes. Hadrian felt a pressure in his head, and then memories flooded back to him; he remembered everything from the moment he ran away from the Dursley’s to being hit by Ron’s Obliviate and then being portkeyed back here.
They men spent their days trading hexes and glares
"I can't believe you and Cissa are parents first," Elena pouted, "but I have to admit, he is beautiful; he's going to be heartbreaker, that one."
“One day this subterfuge will not be necessary,” Dumbledore said, sitting behind the large desk, “I wish I did not need you to risk yourself so much, but you are the only reliable spy I have. Speaking of which, what is the news you wanted to share?”
By the time he finished cleaning up the blood, Vernon and Petunia had gone up to bed, but only after Vernon had taken all of Harry’s belongings out of the cupboard under the stairs and moved them up to Harry’s bedroom; Vernon secured the room with locks, and then informed Harry that, when he earned the privilege of sleeping, he would do so in the cupboard. Hedwig, thankfully, was safe, Harry having lent her to Fred and George.
But, if he couldn’t go to Grimmauld Place, and he couldn’t return to Hogwarts, where could he go until the holidays were over? He would be noticed missing soon enough, and then Umbridge would probably try to have him expelled. Unless…maybe he could return to Privet Drive? Not actually go to the Dursley’s, but he remembered Moody’s trunk from last year, with the large compartment; he could buy one of those, and then hide it in the Dursley’s shed and stay there until it was time to return to school. Hedwig would undoubtedly find him, and he’d send Dumbledore an owl to let him know where he was. The plan wasn’t ideal, but it was the best he could come up with.
“What?” Harry startled, shaking his head, “No, it wasn’t abuse-”
“Right,” Hadrian nodded, “Makes sense. Aracely Lorelei Pruitt.” The image in the orb expanded and appeared in front of them, similar to how Draco had shown Theo and Blaise the pensieve memories last night, and Hadrian was able to see his sister in greater detail. Aracely was standing in what appeared to be a small sitting room, glaring at a golden haired, blue-eyed boy who was standing in front of her, also scowling. “I wish I could hear what was going on,” Hadrian said-and then they could hear the conversation.
“Everything seems to be in order,” Griphook confirmed, after spending several minutes testing the authenticity of the letter, “Now, why have you requested this meeting?” Lucius was, once again, the one to reply.
"What are their names?" Severus asked curiously as he gazed down at the newborn babies.
“Not now,” Harry shook his head, “Let’s just…” He trailed off, forcing himself to focus on the scene in front of him; there would be plenty of time later to figure out what all this meant.
"We are handling them, for the most part," Tom said, "Severus already collected two of them yesterday and Lucius and I have almost finished translating the ritual to restore those two pieces of my soul. The last horcrux that was created, however, affects the two of you specifically. That night in Godric’s Hollow, when Dumbledore forced me to cast the Killing Curse, part of me rebelled against it; the love of Lily and James, and my own love, shielded you from most of the curse, and then caused it to rebound upon me, destroying my body and fragmenting my soul once more."
"I heard that James Potter!" Elena yelled, "Someone give me my wand so I can hex his balls off!" Draco and Harry were watching the scene with wide eyes, both of them laughing quietly.
“I don't think you will,” Draco whispered, moving in closer so that he could wrap his arms around Potter; he ghosted his fingers down Potter's spine, earning another delicious shiver, then cupped Potter’s cheeks, spreading them so that he had a better view of the fake cock inside his (former) rival. “You look so hot like this, bound and helpless, that toy pushing its way inside you… you like that, don't you? You’re a filthy little slut who likes to be filled. Don’t deny it; I can see how hard you are.” Draco tilted his head so that his lips could brush against Potter’s ear, delighting in the gasp it produced, and whispered; “That’s okay though; I like you having that toy in your ass too. I can’t wait to see you take all of it. You ready for a bit more?”
"You're probably right," Hadrian grinned, "I never really clean it out-I just throw the top layer of trash out at the end of each year and put my new books and such on top."
“I’m going to free one of your hands…I want to watch you wank, and you’ll come when I tell you to, understand?”
*****Afternoon at Snape Manor
"Well, that went much quicker than I had thought it would," Narcissa smiled as she led the boys out into the ministry atrium, "Rufus was very helpful, and now we have plenty of time to go visit the library." Their meeting at the ministry had only taken an hour, even though Draco had told Hadrian that custody situations sometimes took nearly five or six hours, depending on the people involved. The fact that Draco was a Veela and Hadrian his mate helped speed matters along, but the new minister-Rufus Scrimgeour-had also helped by being present to witness the necessary papers being signed.
That morning, Harry spent an hour allowing Draco to maneuver his limbs while the blond wound ropes and ribbons around his body. He was covered in gold and silver bindings practically from neck to toe; his upper body was bound in a Karada body harness with thick bondage rope. Thinner ribbons were crossed down each leg, from thigh to ankle, creating a fishnet pattern; these ribbons were attached to a garter belt made of even more rope wrapped around his waist. More ropes were wrapped around his arms and attached to the top of the Karada; he could still move his arms, but it pulled on the ropes. The ropes around his wrists created a slave bracelet-a bracelet attached by a small thread to a ring on his middle finger. Draco had wrapped soft ribbon around his cock and balls as well.
"Yes," Hadrian replied without hesitation, "I trust him completely." He paused thoughtfully for a moment, then added, "Not entirely sure why though; did you Confound me Draco? 'Cos you know, I don't think my new-found...Tom would appreciate that."
"We are going to work on getting her memories back and restoring her mental health," Lucius assured her, "Severus has apparently already made a list of things to do, starting with restoring Tom's soul, finding a way to get Sirius back, and restoring Bella to her former self. Once we can ensure their safety from Dumbledore, Tom intends to locate Elena and Aracely as well."
“I only partially retired,” Bernard was quick to correct, “There are no other elves ready to become your Number 1, so I still show up when I’m needed. Who knows what would happen if I left permanently. We need to talk, Santa; Curtis is waiting for us by your office.” Bernard turned on his heel without saying anything else, and Santa hurried to follow.
When Draco woke up the next morning, it was to find himself alone in Harry’s bed. He frowned as he got up and got dressed; Draco rarely stayed the night, and he liked being able to wake up with Harry in his arms. Unfortunately, waking with Harry in his arms was an even rarer than him staying the night.
Jingle. Jingle.
"We do have your best interests at heart," Narcissa said, "If this situation is still going on once you turn seventeen then we will gladly allow you to join the Order, but you should enjoy being young while you can. Now, how do you feel about going shopping tomorrow? I'm sure you would like to get some new clothing."
"Good," Molly nodded her approval, "Once you rescue Harry he can stay with us for the remainder of the summer; we will make sure to undo all of the bad habits he has undoubtedly learned."
"What do you mean by 'punish'?" Hadrian demanded, "Not like the way my-the Muggles punished me? Because I will not put up with that."
"Good," Draco said, "Just bring the memories Tillie, and don't tell my parents, Sev or Tom unless they specifically ask about it; then you can tell them we are showing the memories to someone that Hadrian trusts explicitly."
Thank you to everyone who reviewed! I probably won't respond to individual reviews unless you have a question for me, but I want to let you know that I appreciate each and every response, whether it is a simple kudos or constructive criticism.
"It was my cousin Dudley," Harry replied, "Or, I guess my uncle could have been partially responsible. The past few days are a little hazy.”
"Papa said the dragon is first because the dragon is best," Scorpius piped up, as he joined them, "I want to see it fly!"
“Okay, now pick him up and I’ll fix the bed,” Hadrian said; Draco carefully picked Arden up and smiled when the miniature dragon curled up in his arms. A few spells later and Hadrian had the bed fixed; he then summoned the bedding from his room and piled it at the foot of the bed. “This way we can have our bed, and Arden can have his nest,” he explained to Draco.
As he waited, Harry wondered what could have made his spells react so oddly; if he had enchanted the dildo to move then he would assume that he had cast the spells wrong, but the only spell he had cast on the dildo was the one to stick it to the stool.  Could someone else have used magic on it? His trunk had been locked, so nothing had been altered before he started his session, but that would mean someone had cast a spell while he was using it-someone who was probably watching him even now!
**************************
But I don’t want to tell you
Pushing those thoughts away, Harry lost himself in the kiss; he was vaguely aware that they had an audience, but he couldn’t be bothered to care at the moment. Draco’s lips were warm, and his body was pressed firmly against Harry’s. Arms were wrapped around Harry’s waist-and then he felt the familiar constriction caused by apparation.
“This may be enough to clear your name, Cousin,” Lucius said thoughtfully, “I can’t have you here, because it would endanger my family, however I own a small cottage in Wales that is not currently being occupied. You may stay there until I sort this out; once I find Pettigrew I will discover the truth and then-if you have been honest with me-I will let you see him. I will not risk letting you near him until I can verify your story.”
May 6, 2011
“No, I was referring to Alphas and Betas,” Narcissa corrected, and Harry shook his head. Narcissa sighed, “It used to be taught during First Year, but now…well, no matter; it is probably better for you to hear this from me regardless. Now, Harry, when someone is referred to as an Alpha or Beta, it refers to both their magical strength and their level of dominance over others. Most Witches and Wizards are Betas, which means that they are all relatively equal when it comes to magical strength, and have no desire to be either dominant or submissive. There are different levels of power in Betas of course, such as Professor McGonagall having more magical power than, say, Madame Malkin, and some Betas, again, Professor McGonagall, have a more dominant personality. Do you understand so far?”
"You made me chase you my girl," Dumbledore shook his head, "Flooing to Potter Manor and then apparating here; did you really think you could throw me off?"
“Oh, wait!” Draco called, just as he was stepping into the hallway, “I don’t remember-did Mother kiss you today?”
“What are you talking about?” Harry gave her a puzzled frown.
Draco lined his cock up and pushed just the tip in, stopping for a moment before pulling back out. He did this a few more times, enjoying the way Harry’s hole clenched as he we breached again and again. Finally, Draco pushed all the way in, then stopped moving. He traced his fingers over the ribbons wrapped around Harry’s legs, locking eyes with the brunet. Harry squirmed as much as he could in the bonds, trying to get the friction he craved. Draco just smirked and pressed even closer, causing Harry’s breath to catch at the unrelenting feeling of fullness.
"Bring me a clean cloth and a bowl of warm water," Draco commanded, "And make it fast!" Tillie didn't respond, but merely bowed again and then vanished; a moment later a white cloth and a glass bowl filled with warm water appeared on the nightstand beside his bed, and Draco wet the cloth before gently wiping the blood off of Potter’s back. Severus had taught Draco that too much foreign magic on an injured wizard could cause complications, and so he decided to clean Potter’s wounds the Muggle way. He had to change the water three times, but finally Potter’s back was once more smooth and free of blood, and Draco breathed a sigh of relief as he vanished the dirty bowl and cloth. Potter’s skin was still mottled with bruises, but at least he appeared to be free from serious injuries.
Harry froze for a moment at the unexpectedness of the move, then Draco licked at Harry’s lips, and the brunet moaned, opening his mouth in invitation. Draco wasted no time in thoroughly tasting the warm cavern, as Harry twined his arms around Draco’s neck. Draco watched as emerald eyes grew dark with passion before fluttering closed, and then he closed his eyes as well, giving himself up to the moment. Tongues battled for dominance, and one of Harry’s hands slid down from Draco’s neck to his shoulders, then moved down to wrap around Draco’s waist. Draco was careful not to press too far like he did the last time, and made sure to keep his erection away from Harry; he really didn’t want the brunet to try running away again. Draco slid his hand up into Harry’s thick locks and tugged gently, drawing another moan from the boy beneath him.
"And I also said that I would be the one to take care of him," Tom replied, "That has changed however; Harry Potter is under the protection of Sanctuary and he no longer follows Dumbledore which is why I offered him protection from my followers. If you had attacked him, Bella, you would have made a liar out of me; no one makes a liar out of me. Crucio!" Bella screamed as the curse hit, and Hadrian found himself watching with wide eyes; he still felt that the curse was terrible, but he had to admit that he felt a strange sense of satisfaction that Tom-his father-was using it to protect him.
“I’ll wear it for a while,” he announced, “but the shoes might have to go; just standing still hurts.”
"Ah, Harry my boy!" both boys looked up to see Dumbledore approaching their table, wearing blinding neon-green robes with pink stars, "What happened to you? Did you and Mr. Malfoy get into another altercation? I am very disappointed in you both, and I can guarantee you will each have detention when school starts, however for now we must get you to the hospital Harry, and then return you to your relative's home where you will be safe once more. Mr. Malfoy, I suggest that you return home as well; it is dangerous to be out alone in times like these."
"Yes Mistress!" Wispy vanished with a pop and reappeared moments later with a small crate covered by a black velvet blanket; "Can Wispy be doing anything else?"
"-the Dark Lord is actually your father," Theo continued, "not to mention crazy Bella is the Mudblood Granger's mom, only Granger isn't a Mudblood, and the blood-traitor Weaslette is actually the Potter heir? Next you'll tell me the Dark Lord is all for the mingling of wizards and Muggles."
After a few minutes, Draco, spins Harry around so that he is facing the wall and moves the scarf so he can nibble at the skin around Harry’s collar. Draco’s hands slip into Harry’s pockets, which are really just slits in the robes that allow the blond access to Harry’s skin; Draco is able to slide one hand up Harry’s chest under the robe flicking the bells attached to Harry’s nipples, and the other one teases the head of his cock. The hand roaming Harry’s chest holds a wand, and Harry waits in anticipation as the hand trails back down, the wand leaving goosebumps in its wake, until the tip of the wand is pressed against the head of his cock.
"What?!" Hadrian screeched, "That isn't-I don't-grrr! I really hate you Draco Malfoy!" He tried to get up off the couch, but Draco chuckled as he grabbed his arm and pulled him back down, wrapping an arm around Hadrian's waist and pulling him flush against his side.
“Is he here now?” Narcissa inquired, looking around the empty room. Draco shook his head, and she turned back to the doorway, “Then let us continue; we can worry about the Muggles later.” Draco swept in front of his mother, leading the way to the stair case. His foot was on the bottom step when he paused and turned to look at the door set in the wall beneath the staircase; the cupboard under the stairs. Slowly, as if compelled, he walked over to the door and pulled it open; Narcissa looked over his shoulder and saw that the small closet contained a cot to one side, and floor-to-ceiling shelves of cleaning supplies on the other. On the back wall, a small picture was taped, showing a family of three smiling happily while a dark-haired boy stood to the side, tears running down his face. At the bottom of the picture were two headstones, with the names James and Lily written on them. The picture was depressing and gave great insight to Hadrian’s treatment at the hands of these Muggles. By the date written in the bottom right corner, Hadrian was only seven when he drew this.
A few hours later, after Teddy had opened his presents and eaten his cake, Harry found himself sitting with Ron, Ginny, Luna and Rolf Scamander, Luna’s husband. Harry watched with a smile as Draco helped Scorpius fly on a training broom, then frowned as he recalled his earlier conversation with the blond.
"I suppose I can understand that," Lucius said reluctantly, "But how do you plan to do that? I always thought that once the soul was separated there was no way to repair the damage."
"It can be confusing to figure out what you feel," Draco conceded, "and I know I should probably give you some space to think, but that's just not me; I can't do that. If you want to talk about it however, I would be more than happy to listen. What happened with Luna and Neville yesterday?"
“This is where they did it,” Draco informed Narcissa, “This is where my mate was injured; I can still smell his blood.”
“I’m sure,” Draco interrupted, “Infidelity is often a part of an arrange marriage, but only if both partners are discrete. Harry would never agree to it, and I don’t blame him; everyone would see him as my bit on the side, and he’s worth more than that. Now, I want to try to open earlier today; we need to get a head start on Potter-I have no intention of letting him win our bet.”
“It was my pleasure,” Draco smirks, “Now sleep, before it becomes my pleasure again.” I pinch him for the corny remark, and he retaliates by pulling on my hair.
“Can I please, Uncle Draco?” Teddy asked, his silver-and-gold hair changing to match Draco’s own platinum locks, while Teddy’s eyes turned the same emerald as Harry’s, “Please let me take the fun way down.”
It was a trap. The Death Eater’s didn’t have Sirius; they just wanted Harry to get the prophesy for them. Well, he got the prophesy alright-he got it, then threw it at Bellatrix Lestrange, the mad woman who had threatened Draco, and watched with satisfaction as it burst, burning her skin. Then, they were running. They made it to the atrium with only a few injuries, and Harry came face to face with Voldemort once again. They dueled; their wands connected, and this time Harry understood how to use the connection. Harry thought about his friends, Sirius, the Malfoys, his parents and Draco; all the people he loved. He focused on that love, and pushed it into the connection. Voldemort couldn’t understand love; he had never felt it, consumed by hatred as he was. In the face of Harry’s love for his friends and family, the Dark Lord was powerless. He was surrounded by love, and it burned him, much like Harry’s touch had burned Quirrell all those years ago. In the end, all that remained of Voldemort was a pile of ash.
“Yes,” Malfoy replied, “Nearly every night, in fact.” Harry frowned in confusion and started to face the blond when Malfoy’s meaning hit him; Malfoy was saying he dreamed of snogging Harry every night!
Harry was so absorbed by the pain and hopelessness caused by having his magic blocked away, that he actually forgot about his relatives until his uncle dumped him out of the chair and Harry fell in the middle of the shards of broken glass. He cried out again as the sharp edges cut into his skin drawing blood, but quickly shut up when Vernon slapped him once again, before kicking him in the side.
“I’m missing a lot of my memory,” Harry said, “Do you know what happened to me?”
"Hmm, that's true," Draco said slowly, before smirking, his brief moment of self-pity over, "I knew he couldn't resist me, not really. So, you think you'll have that set fixed up within a week or two?"
As he was thinking about this, the stool began to get cold and Harry found himself squirming-or, at least, attempting to squirm-at the discomfort. Stuck to the stool as he was, all Harry could really do was move his legs and upper body. Just when the cold got to be almost two much, the plug came alive again, and Harry had to bite back a scream as it appeared to be on its highest intensity level. Harry pulled at his chains and tried to squirm away as the vibrating plug stimulated his prostate, and he found himself whimpering at the feeling; too much! It was all too much! He would be stuck on the stool for twenty minutes this time! His cock and balls were starting to get cold, but still he wanted his release, and he fought back tears of frustration as his orgasm remained just out of reach.
"Three." They bartered back and forth for a few minutes, before agreeing on a price of seven galleons.
Than the childhood neglect in my memories.
Harry quickly pushed himself up on his hands and knees, displaying his ass for his Alpha to see. Fingers entered him briefly once more, checking to make sure he was ready, and then Draco’s cock was rushing inside, filling him and stretching him. Harry cried out his satisfaction as Draco pushed him down so that his shoulders and head were on the mattress, while his ass was high in the air. Slim fingers tightened on Harry’s hips, and then Draco was slamming into him, stealing Harry’s breath with his forceful movements. It didn’t take long until Harry was coming, his cock spilling over the sheets, but Draco kept moving, claiming him over and over again. Draco felt Harry’s passage grow even tighter, constricting his movement, and knew that his knot was growing. Soon he wasn’t able to pull out at all, his knot snugly trapped inside his husband’s heat, and Draco felt his orgasm ripped from him. He collapsed forward and bit Harry’s shoulder hard enough to leave a mark, and felt Harry’s walls ripple around him again as another orgasm was pulled from the brunet. Draco busied himself with sucking a dark bruise around the bitemark he had just made as his cock emptied itself in Harry’s ass.
“You must be quiet,” Narcissa warned him, and Draco nodded his understanding as she opened the door. The door, of course, opened into a sitting room, and they quickly crossed through that to the bedroom beyond. When Narcissa opened the door to the bedroom, she stood back and gestured for Draco to precede her.
Now, though, Harry had to decide what to do; would it be safe for him to call Dobby? If he did call the House Elf, where would he go? Harry had the uneasy feeling that he was still forgetting something important, but he couldn’t think what it was, even as grey eyes flashed through his mind again.
That, however, was a problem for another time; Harry’s biggest concern right now was making sure his new room was properly warded to make sure no one could walk in on him during any of his self-bondage sessions. Harry had a book on warding that Hermione had given him, and he used it to make sure that no one could enter his room between the hours of eight p.m. and ten a.m. unless he physically opened the door to let them in. A silencing ward was added to the door on top of that, and Harry felt that his room was secure. Now, did he want to try something tonight? He hadn’t had a chance to get a healing potion, so his muscles were still sore from the previous night. Well, maybe if he did something a little less intense it wouldn’t be so bad...and tomorrow was Sunday, so he wouldn’t have to worry about classes either.
"Sure, whatever you say Hades," Draco laughed, linking arms with the other boy as they walked down the hall, "Come on; if Mother has to come back up to get us it won't be pleasant. Have you decided which classes you're taking this year?"
“Yeah,” Hadrian frowned, “She looked really…betrayed.”
Harry called for Dobby, and instructed him to deliver the letter to Draco only when he was alone, and to make sure that no one saw him coming or going. He also asked Dobby to bring him some books on Horcruxes, which the House Elf only agreed to after Harry told him he needed the information to fight Dumbledore.
"It’s your turn now Tom," Dumbledore smiled, "Ever heard of a Horcrux my boy? No? Well, we're going to create one for you…or six. Bring them up now, Peter." Pettigrew brought the children over to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were still standing with Tom, who was bound by conjured chains. McGonagall looked extremely unhappy, and Dumbledore was quick to soothe her concerns. "They're all orphans, living on the street Minerva; this really is kinder for them.” McGonagall nodded and set out several objects on the table, then Harry and Draco watched in disbelief as Dumbledore imperiused Tom, forcing him to murder a total of six children; as he did so a shaky McGonagall cast a spell, and each murder resulted in one of the objects on the table being enchanted.
“Draco,” Harry said with a slow smile, “I think I can do that.” He tried to pull his hand away, but Draco wasn’t quite ready to release it yet.
“I spoke to Ron, Ginny and Luna,” Harry told him, once he had poured them both a drink, “They convinced me that Santa Clause is real.”
“Okay then,” Harry frowned, “Who won?”
“It was definitely not up to my usual standards,” Lucius replied, “I will be sending in a letter of complaint as soon as I have had a shower. Now, would you care to tell me exactly why Potter is here, and what he is doing with my son?” Lucius sounded bored as he took the seat across from his old friend, then, as Tom returned, he added, "If our Lord wishes for me to be informed, that is."
“Soon, Harry,” Draco promised, withdrawing his tongue and adding another finger instead. He twisted and scissored his fingers, loving the feel of Harry’s walls alternately clenching and stretching. The two boys had been together since Fourth Year, but tonight would be the first time they had sex, and Draco wanted to draw it out properly. With his free hand, Draco summoned his wand. He withdrew his fingers from Harry’s body, shushing his husband’s protesting whimpers, and covered them in lube before pressing three in this time. Harry gasped; the entry was smoother because of the lube, but the stretch was more and he fought his body to relax and accept this wanted intrusion. They could have waited another week for their wedding, so that their first time would occur during Harry’s first heat and the pain would be lessened, but the brunet had wanted the first time to be just him and Draco-no magic involved except for that of their love for one another.
“Dudley!” He called, opening Dudley’s bedroom door, “The freak came back; since he cost you some of your allowance by escaping on your watch, I thought I’d let you take care of his punishment. Just don’t kill him, and make sure the neighbors don’t hear him scream. When you’re done, throw him in his cupboard; he won’t eat again until you allow it.”
“Snape?!” Harry cried, “Why would you send that-”
“They won’t find us,” Draco says, “I warded the alcove too well. I left a note with one of the House Elf’s though; Longbottom will know better than to come looking for us. We have the rest of the night to ourselves, so we can stay here as long as you like.”
"Yes, My Lord," Severus nodded, "however, I believe that I may be able to help restore you to your normal self, in time."
“No, I did not mean to invade your privacy,” he said with forced calm, “As I said, I did not know what it was when I picked it up.”
"I just wanted to get somewhere private so we can talk," Draco replied, "We have to do something; we can't just let our parents keep us in the dark about this. Why did you just give up in there?"
“Yes!” Harry cried, “Come on!” Draco pumped his three fingers in and out of Harry’s hole, making sure to brush against his prostate occasionally, and watched as his lover tried to move his hips and get him to go faster.
Next, he maneuvered Potter onto his back again before opening the salve and smelling it to make sure that it was still good. Satisfied that it wasn't spoiled, he scooped out a handful and carefully applied it to the open gashes on Potter's back, feeling relieved when the wounds began to close. Once he had applied the cream to each gash he called for Tillie, his personal house elf.
"Well, thank you both," Harry said to forestall any further argument, "I'm sure you're both thrilled to have me owe you a life debt."
Hadrian passed the letter to Draco and opened the one from Luna.
“Okay, Draco,” Harry interrupted with a frown of his own, “It was funny at first, but now you’re getting ridiculous. Can you just drop the joke, so we can get going? I don’t want to be late for Teddy’s birthday party.” Andromeda had gotten permission for Teddy to come home for his birthday weekend; after the war, McGonagall had relaxed the rules about letting students go home for the weekends, so long as they had parental permission.
“If you’ll tell me about your childhood,” he offered the compromise, and Draco nodded his agreement, then sat back in his chair and looked at Harry expectantly. “I suppose you want me to go first?”
“I’m not ready for this yet, Draco,” Hadrian insisted, “It’s only been two days since I realized I wanted to be with you.”
"Very well," Draco nodded, "We shall be down shortly." Hadrian moved in front of the mirror, flattening his hair out of habit, and shot a glare at Draco when he noticed a faint red mark on his neck.
"It will be done," Griphook confirmed, then narrowed his eyes at Lucius, “You should be aware, however, that Albus Dumbledore is listed as Harry Potter’s Magical Guardian and, as such, he is authorized to make any withdrawals he deems necessary. The funds in the Potter vault are to be held in trust until Harry Potter comes of age, and until that time Mr. Dumbledore may use the funds as he sees fit. Also, as Harry Potter was named Sirius Blacks heir, Albus Dumbledore has authorization to access the Black vaults as well.”
“I understand,” Narcissa nodded, “So that is where James went? To visit your other portrait?”
“This place-it’s amazing!” Harry breathed, leaning over the side of the sleigh, only to feel a strong hand pulling him back.
Draco stepped into the room, and immediately noticed that it was decorated differently than most of the rooms in the family wing. The room was decorated in jewel tones of green and blue, with silver accents. However, Draco’s gaze was quickly drawn to the bed, where he realized a figure was sleeping. The figure was buried in blankets, only a mop of messy black hair-Draco’s eyes widened, and he looked over his shoulder to see his mother smirking at him. He tore his gaze away to look back at the bed, and then looked at her again, and she nodded in encouragement.
"Albus,
“When we bond?” Potter questioned, “I haven’t agreed to this yet; I’m still hoping McGonagall will come to her senses and let me out of here. No offense, Malfoy, but I really don’t want to bond myself to you…or anyone else; I’m sure you don’t want this either.”
“Soon,” my lover promises, stilling as he bottoms out. He holds himself inside me, unmoving, for endless minutes, until I can’t stand it anymore. I begin writhing beneath him, trying to force him to move, but his hands grip my hips to keep me still, and it’s too much, the unrelenting pressure. He presses impossibly forward, until I think I think I could taste it if he came inside me at this moment, and I am pleading with him to move.
"What? No!” He shook his head vehemently, “You know there's nothing between Luna and me. We're just friends, and she's one of the only girls I feel comfortable just hanging out with.” A pause, then, “Do you think Draco likes her?" Hadrian felt stupid for asking the question, but he couldn't help himself; the two blondes looked cozy and, for some reason, the thought of Draco liking Luna made Hadrian feel…well, he didn't like it, that's for sure.
Narcissa had offered to wait with Harry until the Dursley’s arrived so that she could arrange for him to visit over the summer, only to be disgusted when his relatives finally showed up. Vernon had immediately berated Harry for being a freak and snacked the back of his head, and Narcissa had transformed from Draco’s loving mother into a woman to be reckoned with. She had easily forced the Dursley’s to describe their treatment of Harry (Harry suspected a spell, but he hadn’t seen her draw her wand), and had then proceeded to tell them all the ways that Harry was better than them, before finally sending them on their way with that warning. It had been, in a word, brilliant.
Harry felt his face flushing again and chose to ignore the compliment, for the simple reason that he didn’t know how to respond. Instead, he busied himself with removing his clothes. He hung the cloak over a tree branch, and his robes quickly followed. Knowing that sex would be part of The Ritual, Harry had chosen not to wear anything beneath the robes, and so his boots were the last thing he had to remove, and he made sure to be standing by the crystals so that his feet didn’t get frostbite.
“I swear on my magic and blood that I am entering this ritual of my own free will,” Harry began, “I offer myself and my magic to Draco Malfoy in return for having the power to free the world from the evil that is Lord Voldemort. From this day forward I will give my heart, body and magic to Draco Malfoy, wholeheartedly and without reservation, and I swear to be faithful only to him, so mote it be.”
"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way my boy," Dumbledore said sadly, "but if you will not work with me then you are my enemy,” Dumbledore’s voice trailed off as he began talking to himself, as if he had forgotten that Tom was still in the room, “I just have to find a way to bring out the darkness which surely lurks within you, and make certain the other teachers see the evil in your soul, but how?" Tom had gotten out of his chair and was slowly making his way to the door, only to freeze when Dumbledore’s twinkling blues eyes focused on him again.
“And I heard actual locks too,” Harry-no; his name was
"Alright Draco-you take care of our littlest brother," George said, "See you guys soon." Hadrian waved as Draco linked their arms once again and they wandered off down the cobblestone lane.
“It’s okay, pup,” Sirius hushed him, “I’m okay; we’re all okay. It’s over now. Let’s get Draco, and we’ll take him to his parents; I had to put them under a binding spell to keep them from coming tonight, and they’re like to be worried. Professor Dumbledore took the rest of your friends back to school, and he said they’re fine. I already spoke to Tonks, and the Aurors will let us talk to them tomorrow. Come on, Cousin; school’s out for the year.”
“I think that’s perfect,” Draco smiled, “That gives us plenty of time to prepare, and time for my father to recover from the heart attack we are about to give him. Fancy seeing the Malfoy Chateau in France?”
"To be fair, he probably thought that the memory charms he cast before your deaths would still be in place," Narcissa said calmly, "Dumbledore never did spend much time studying subjects that had to do with death; he always felt himself above such nonsense. I must say I am glad to finally have my memories back, and young Hadrian is finally safe with us."
"Fine," Draco pouted, "but you owe me Hades." Hadrian rolled his eyes and turned back to face the adults.
"You think Draco will come into a creature inheritance on his birthday," Lucius stated and Severus nodded, "And with the way he is acting…you believe Hadrian to be his mate." Lucius made it a statement, but Severus choose to respond as if it had been a question.
“That was fun, Uncle Harry! Can I do it again, please?”
"He is my mate and no one had better interfere," Draco growled again, and Hadrian shook his head with a sigh.
Draco was surprised to wake up alone the next morning; he briefly worried that he had pushed too hard and made Harry feel too uncomfortable to even sleep in the same room as him, but then he saw that the sheets were rumpled on Harry’s side of the bed. It seemed Harry had simply gotten up before him for a change, which was very strange. Draco just found himself hoping that Harry was seriously thinking about what he had said-and that Harry believed him. If Harry thought Draco only wanted to bond as a way to defeat the Dark Lord, the brunet would never agree to it.
“You weren’t breaking up with me.”
"Or we can go when we get our school lists," Hadrian shrugged, "It's not like I'll need it before then. I was also thinking that tomorrow we should take a look at those books; I believe Tom and your dad were working on the journals, but we can translate the potions books."
"That's true," Lucius mused, "Draco will be highly possessive of Hadrian for some time after he comes into his inheritance, which will make it difficult for Hadrian to spend time with Lupin-is there any way to find Lupin today?"
"Nice to meet you," Severus said shyly, accepting Tom's hand, "Luca told me about you in his letters."
"Elena is alive?" Voldemort hissed, his eyes flashing once again, "She did not betray me? You had better be certain of this Severus, or your punishment shall be swift. Bring me your pensieve and wait as I view the memories."
"I never agreed to that," Tom said, "There is a lot we need to do this summer, so we can't go travelling all over Europe."
“I’ll leave; right now!” Harry said quickly, trying to loosen Vernon’s grip on his arm, “Just let me go, and I’ll never bother you again; I swear!”
“From Dumbledore?” Lucius interrupted, “You mean the way you protected your wife and children from the manipulative old bastard? Dumbledore has gotten the best of us all, and we are still trying to pick up the pieces; do you really expect a sixteen-year-old to fare better against him?”
"I didn't," Hadrian rolled his eyes," I just had to let them think that I was giving up; I know better than to argue with adults-if they won't let us help them, we'll just have to help ourselves. Remember the defense club last year? That taught me that sometimes we just have to take matters into our own hands."
“My father is not evil,” Draco protested, “Just because you don’t agree with some of the things he has done-”
"Okay then," George nodded, "Follow me." He led them through a door at the back of the living room which led to a more intimate room with work tables along the back wall and a few comfortable chairs arranged in the middle, "This is our planning room; you two are the only ones aside from Fred and I to see it, so no telling people what we have in here." He shot a look at Draco, "I'm trusting you because Harry said you're trustworthy, but if he turns out to be wrong..." He trailed off meaningfully, before grinning again, "You two want something to drink?" He gestured for Draco and Hadrian to sit down, and didn't fail to notice the way Draco took the lead, pulling the brunet to sit next to him on the small couch, if the smirk he shot the blond was anything to go by.
“Well, I heard from Hannah that Draco is bi, so flirting doesn't mean that he is leading her on,” Neville said, “You know that it’s okay if you're gay, right?” Neville pressed on before Hadrian could respond, “Gran mentioned that a lot of Muggles don't like gay people, but it's acceptable in the Wizarding World.”
“You looked as if you were about to play Gryffindor again,” Draco drawled, “We couldn’t just let you run off on your own. Now, where are we going and why? And don’t argue Potter; we can come with you, or we can body-bind you and return you to the castle.”
“Always,” Draco grinned, stealing a kiss before sitting in the side car, “Very well, you can ride with Sirius if you must.”
“Boys can get pregnant?!” Harry interrupted, startled by this revelation.
"Like me," Draco said, "I will-"
"Episkey," Severus murmured, and Hadrian winced as his broken nose fixed itself. Severus reached into the small emergency potions kit he always kept with him, and pulled out a small tin of thick blue paste, which he then slathered on Hadrian's bruises. "The damage to your vocal cords was caused by magic," Severus said, "Did you hear Weasley cast a spell?" Hadrian shook his head in the negative, "Did you say something that angered him?" Hadrian nodded. "Well, it is possible his accidental magic is affecting your vocal cords," Severus pulled out a vial of green potion the bag he always kept with him, and held it out to Hadrian; "A simple healing draught should fix you vocal cords, along with the smaller injuries inflicted by Weasley. Drink this Hadrian, and stop scowling at me." Hadrian stuck his tongue out at the potions master and grudgingly accepted the potion-sure, he couldn't speak, but that didn't mean he wanted to take another vile tasting potion. He glared at the potion suspiciously for a moment before tilting his head back and downing it in one go, making a disgusted face at the bitter taste that lingered on his tongue.
“You’ve let the Nargles get in your head again, Harry. We will let you out after you give Draco a chance to explain. If you get hungry, I put a box of pastries in your pocket.”
When the stomach-turning feelings passed, Santa lifted his head, pink lips upturned in a smirk as grey eyes flashed.
"Yes," Elena nodded, "I will wait fifteen minutes and if you don't come through I will take the children to my parents in America; you and Tom both know how to contact me there." Alice nodded at this and gestured Elena to the fireplace; Alice tossed the Floo powder in for her friend, and then Elena stepped in and stated her destination, disappearing with the twins.
“I found out that Vincent Crabbe died on a suicide mission for the Dark Lord,” Draco replied, “And it is possible that the Dark Lord intends to mark Pansy over break-and make her his consort.”
"Um, sure," Hadrian shrugged, allowing Fred to cast a couple of detection spells, "What are you doing?"
“Then you’re an idiot,” Harry snapped, and he was pleased to see Dumbledore’s eyes narrow slightly in anger, “Yes, I was brought there to do a ritual, but it was one I had to be willing to participate in; all the books just call it ‘The Ritual’, and it was created by Merlin and Morgana to unite the Wizarding World against a common enemy.”
“Dobby is feeling Headmaster’s magic being blocking it,” Dobby said.
"He's not my boyfriend," Hadrian replied, "He's just a friend. And I really don't know what to get him. Not a book; I refuse to give books as birthday gifts to anyone except Hermione. Maybe something for Quidditch? Or he likes potions..." Hadrian trailed off thoughtfully as the two boys walked down Diagon Alley together, looking in shop windows but never actually going inside.
"About two," George replied, and Hadrian shook his head.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed, stepping closer to Harry, “So, shall we go upstairs? I won’t be able to come over tomorrow night; Mother is insisting I have supper at the Manor, and I will likely stay the night there.”
First, Dumbledore betrayed him, as did his friends, apparently. Second, his animagus form was a black tiger, which was supposedly rare-he shrugged, not really knowing what to think about that and continued with his thoughts. He discovered that the collar basically made him Malfoy-Draco's-property, and that everything he'd ever heard about his childhood was a lie; he had parents and a sister who were alive, and his father was Voldemort-Tom Riddle! Not to mention he had started to have strange feelings around Draco, noticing the way the sunlight made his pale hair look like a halo and how warm his eyes could be…
“And I’m thankful,” Harry told him, “Because that would have been really creepy. What time is it?”
"No!" Hadrian stopped him, "I forbid you to punish yourself! I'm okay Dobby; I would have let you know, but...a lot has happened over the past two days. I'm staying with the Malfoy's now."
“As happy as I am to see that Potter has stopped being an idiot,” Parkinson began, “Lovegood and I want to know who won the bet so that we can go home.”
“Are you alright, Harry?” A soft hand rested on his shoulder, and Harry found himself staring into the warm brown eyes of his ex-wife.
“Yes,” Harry whispered his agreement, and within seconds his right hand was free. He immediately wrapped his fingers around his cock, and felt the other male move back as he began stoking himself.
“S-seeker’s Game?” he squeaked.
“Don’t stop!” Harry pleaded, his hips jerking in search of friction. He fell still, however, frowning in confusion when he felt a weight settle over top of him, and realized Draco was straddling him. “What-oh!”
“I have already spoken to my son,” Narcissa replied, “He is willing to at least listen to you before deciding who to follow.”
“Night, Draco,” Harry replied. Moments later the sun shone through the windows, bathing the room in soft golden light as Harry and Draco fell asleep in one another’s arms.
"Lucius," she smiled softly; Lucius quickly got to his feet and opened his arms as Narcissa glided over to him, her pale grey eyes shining with happiness. They embraced for a moment before pulling away and sitting down side-by-side on the couch, Narcissa leaning against her husband slightly. "I'm so glad you're home; how did you get out?"
“A Christmas story about skeletons and monsters,” Draco shook his head as he changed into his pajamas, “Do you think the author was on drugs?”
“Thanks, Dobby,” Hadrian said, slowly pushing himself into a sitting position, even as he kept his eyes tightly closed, “I’m okay though; the headache has already started to go away.”
“Right,” Harry said shakily, “Okay, the books say that it works best if the partner with the most power is…er, the one…”
“Now, you will be the only Christmas Elf wearing green,” Pansy told him, “The rest of them will wear either red or purple, maybe dark blue. They also won’t have robes like you do. I’ll have the rest of your uniforms finished and sent to your room, along with some clothes for when you’re off duty. Don’t argue,” Pansy glared at him, and Harry snapped his mouth shut, “You’ll need the clothes when you and Draco go out. Speaking of which, get out of my office; go find something to entertain yourself with until Draco returns, and don’t mess up all my hard work!”
“From my mother,” Draco confirmed; he hesitated a moment, then extended the letter towards Potter; “You can read it, if you like.”
"No, he isn't attacking me," Hadrian rushed to assure the house elf, "He was jus-that is-um, Draco is my friend now."
Spent, Draco let Harry’s legs slip off his shoulder, and then collapsed beside his boyfriend on the bed. Draco rested his head on Harry’s chest, absently tracing the ribbons there as he waited for his breathing to even out.
“Yes,” Harry agreed, pleasure overriding his common sense, “Anything!”
“Welcome to Slytherin, Potter,” Harry drew his attention away from the whispers, and focused on the blond in front of him, “Sit.” Malfoy, the boy from the train, indicated for Harry to take the empty seat next to him, and Harry complied. “We got off to a bad start,” Malfoy said, “However it is not too late to start over. Will you accept my assistance this time, or do you still think you’re too good for me?” Harry glanced back at the group of students still waiting to be seated, and was startled by the dark glare from Ron; it looked like Ron really believed all the bad stuff about Slytherin, and he didn’t want to be Harry’s friend anymore.
and keep secrets from me too?”
“I don’t break my plans unless I have a very good reason,” Draco said, “You know this, Potter. Besides, I have something more interesting than coffee in mind for after supper.” Draco smirked at him, and Harry rolled his eyes.
"Excellent," Lucius nodded, "Now, what is going on with my son and Harr-I mean, Hadrian? Draco seemed to be very worried about him when they came out of the memories."
"I'd have to examine the collar," Fred mused, "but I'm pretty sure George and I can do it; it may take us a bit of time though."
Now, for the final step; Harry reached in front of him and found the handcuffs. He secured them around his wrists, double-locking them so that he had very little wriggle room, and then pulled on the chain. The chain shortened until he pulled on it again, when he was stretched out as far as possible with his heels still touching the ground, at which point it locked in place. Now everything was set, and Harry would not be able to escape until the time-delays activated, in one hour. Harry just hoped he wouldn’t get bored before then-
"You wish," Hadrian retorted, leaning his head against the window and closing his eyes so that he couldn't watch the blond anymore, "Parading around me half-naked is not going to convince me I want you, so give it up." Well, Hadrian admitted to himself, it might work, but he wasn't about to tell Draco that!
“I have important news,” Severus said lowly, “I do not want to discuss it in the open; not all of the portraits and ghosts are trustworthy.”
“Yes, Mistress,” Wispy agreed; she took Narcissa home, then returned to Privet Drive to keep watch.
"Draco," Hadrian said softly, moving to stand in front of him; Draco turned his head in the other direction and crossed his arms as he scowled; "Come on Dray-don't be mad at me," Hadrian pleaded, "I-I was just surprised when you said that; I never even thought I liked boys until yesterday, and then you tell me that I'm destined to be your mate? Can you blame me for looking for a way out?"
“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore interrupted, giving him a stern look, “He is your teacher, and you will show him respect.”
“Agreed,” Harry said immediately, clasping Draco’s outstretched hand so they could shake on it, “Out of curiosity, did you decide to open a café before or after you heard Luna and me planning ours?”
"Shut it," Hadrian scowled, "Why do you always start in on me?"
“Arden!” Draco cried, scowling as Harry doubled over in laughter, “What do you think you’re doing?” Arden, who had been sleeping peacefully, cracked open one eye and hissed at Draco before burrowing under a pillow. “Don’t you hiss at me!” Harry sat on the floor, holding his sides as he continued laughing at the sight of Draco chastising his dragon…who had made a nest on the bed.
"How can Wispy be serving Mistress?" the house elf bowed.
The book listed, Mathias' Book 5, was in Severus' collection, however it was in a language he had never before read; the remainder of the book on Horcruxes was written in the same language, and so Severus was somewhat stuck as to what he should do next. Perhaps he would show the books to Tom; if Tom did not recognize the language, it would be time to pay a visit to the library, or maybe one of the shops down Knocturn Alley. Amadeo and Serilia were Severus’ ancestors on his mother’s side of the family, and they would no doubt have kept records as well, but Severus had never come across them. Of course, his mother had forfeited her inheritance by marrying a Muggle, Tobias Snape, so it was likely that the information was at the Prince ancestral home or a vault in Gringott’s. Severus had never had reason to claim his maternal inheritance before, but perhaps it was time to do so…
"Well, when you put it that way, I should have passed out hors ago, and not wake until sometime next month," Hadrian said drily as they walked down the hallway towards the study, "By the way, what's that Sanctuary thing Luna mentioned in her letter?"
Several minutes later, Draco pulled away and cast a cleaning charm before looking for his clothes.
“My father may not have always made the best decisions,” Draco said stiffly, “However, everything he has done has been for the good of my mother and myself; forgive me if I do not think he is evil. As for becoming a Death Eater…well, did you, or did you not, seek out the Dark Lord because the ‘Light’ betrayed you?” Harry was silent, unable to argue with that statement, and Draco smirked at him, “As I thought. Now shush.”
“Yes, please,” Harry asked, and sat down on the floor in front of the wardrobe to listen as Dobby told him all his knew.
“I did,” Draco confirmed, “and I do recognize a few symbols here, but the runes will only make sense once everything else is translated, for they can have different interpretations depending on the context.” He paused as he looked over the page again, “Now that you mention it, I do recognize some Arithmancy formula’s as well; I should be able to decipher them eventually; however, it will take a while as they are very complex.”
“For the Greater Good,” Dumbledore agreed, “Now go.”
"Very well," Severus replied, sounding very put-out, "I will accept your apology, with the understanding that you will help me in my revenge against Peter and allow me to borrow your cloak." James held out his hand and Severus shook it, doing the same with Sirius and, with a slight hesitation, Remus.
“Mother’s palace is in the Faerie Realm,” Draco replied, “And magic is different here. Mother’s kiss helps to balance your magic, otherwise you would get very sick, very fast. Mother will already be in bed, but…well, I have the same magic. I would let you wait until tomorrow, but I have heard stories of mortals falling asleep and never waking due to an imbalance in their magical core.”
Harry stared down at his food, not feeling hungry again. He glanced up, and Daphne looked pointedly at his plate, then glared at him. Harry shrugged apologetically, and then looked down the table, where he could see Draco sitting with some of the Seventh Years. Draco glanced up and caught his eye, then gave him a sad smile before looking away. It had been like that since the beginning of the school year, when Draco told him that his father had forbidden Draco from talking to him. According to Lucius, it was for both of their safety. Harry understood Lucius wanted to keep his son safe, but it still hurt. At least the year was almost over; he had his History of Magic exam after dinner, and then he was finished with exams. Soon, he could go home, where he wouldn’t have to see the blond every day and know that they couldn’t be together.
“And what do you expect me to do in the meantime? Sit around and wait patiently for someone to find my son, when he could be getting abused again as we speak?” Tom’s voice was frustrated, but some of the blind rage had drained away; Severus’ potion really did restore his sanity, and sometimes forced him to see sense even when he would rather act than plot.
"We will have to take the chance," He said, "If Miss Granger is even half as smart as she acts then she will realize the truth, and there are ways to keep her from speaking about this until we are ready. The real question is what to do about Miss Weasley; she was raised to be a Weasley and she is one through and through."
