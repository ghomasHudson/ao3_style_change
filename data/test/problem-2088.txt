“I don’t like you.”
“But would you want to live here? Does Harry?”
Think about it. Do you want your Dad and I (or for that matter Hermione and Ron) chaperoning your stag do??? Think Jamie! Do you want your Grandmother Molly and my Mother showing up for your “Pub Crawl???”
________________________________
Luna, My friend, It’s not often that we see something printed that doesn’t contain either “Scandal!” or “Shocking!” In the headline. Our luncheon was a special afternoon and I’m so glad you could both attend. -
1. Mr. Potter and I have been business partners for years and we frequently meet over a meal in a public restaurant (“clandestine!”). If we didn’t enjoy each other’s company we would not be in business together. We also both enjoy art and as such it should not be “SHOCKING” that we would attend an exhibit of said art. Stop speculating about things of which you do not know.
So the water on these won’t be like a big shooting spout or anything. It just gently falls down the sides, again in a sheet. The water on the stainless will always be kind of shimmering as it falls down from the top. We’ll focus the light from below to shoot up the spires at night.”
“Fantastic! I’ll ask Hugo to look into it!”
It would be an honour. Tell your staff not to play any tricks on us tonight. I like Draco's hair the colour it is.
YOU TRICKED ME!!!!
Very good. Anything else today?
“You’re just jealous cause Mr. Jordan doesn’t like your treats as well as mine.”
I’ll give you twenty five, just come home :)
“Yes, please.”
With this letter we wish to clarify a few issues.
“That does sound lovely.”
Edit: Fixing mistakes. Please ignore.
“Shall we trudge ahead to the next catastrophe?”
“Let’s go meet them!”
“Jon and Davey from the playground?”
I’ll go hide now.
What does it entail?
“He should be here. I told him to meet us here. . . . .”
——————————————————————————
“What time is it?”
Got it!
Is pleased to announce it’s first awarded grant:
“They do that a lot.”
“You should see my poor toaster.”
LOL!!
I’ve got the fireplaces lit. There’s plenty of room. We have food. If you want meat you’ll cook it outside like our Dad does. You guys should bring beverages because all we have are waters and juices. Bring some music.
Scorp has an idea. He’ll be here in a sec.
Alright. Anything else today?
. . . . . . . . . .
Mother said he “accepted the invitation”, and before you ask, NO. She won’t grill him for info on BABY. I KNOW I tried.
Minerva McGonagall
Ask Dom too? Louis, Gareth and Danika are already coming.
Gringotts
“No.”
The article.
Sorry for the tornado and stuff! That whole old lady and her moonshine basement was faked up by the Goblins.
. . . . . . . . . .
Anything to get out of this house!
You’re right. I don’t approve them I just sign off to tell them they did a good job. Still, to be sure, I’m going take this to the Supreme Mugwump and have her sign off. It won’t be an issue, she’ll understand completely.
“There’s that. I guess part of it is that I never really had anything to tell them about either. Now that you bring up that it’s all my Family history it’s almost weirder. I don’t know anything about it. There was nobody for me to ask and obviously nobody to tell me.”
“So I need you to just stay up on the ladder and keep a look out for Muggles. We need a code.”
I’ll do that! Love you bye!
Unusual.
Anyhow, I’d like the opportunity to meet with Kreacher in advance, perhaps Saturday? We’re looking to expedite the main first ritual. We are planning an event with family and order members to witness and tour the site before we begin restoration.
“Arthur! Let’s do this.”
Oh and speaking of the fucking Profit. I’m going to buy that rag!
Did you read the comments? HA.
“Each is custom to you so you can’t mix them up if you take them off at the beach or something.”
“That’s the answer to my question. It puts me into a daze of sorts almost a trance at times.”
#12 can be restored to its original construction (and 1843 footprint), however, this charm and ritual is the most harsh and complicated architectural restoration. Performing the charm/ritual would significantly reduce access to a Floo, as only remote conversations through the network at that time were available. All functional systems including heating, plumbing and lighting fixtures would be reduced to the original. All decorative enhancements (furniture, furnishings, wallpapers/paint, carpets, paintings etc.) are irrevocably removed leaving only the original unfinished walls, woodwork, lighting and bath/kitchen fixtures. The charm/ritual, (constructione et restituet) can only be performed by a team of 3 licensed Gringots experts and must be overseen by a Family representative. The representative most appropriate for the restoration would probably be Mr. Kreacher of Hogwarts, as he is the last living individual bonded to the home with knowledge of its original footprint and construction. The charm/ritual does not effect the building exterior or grounds.

“Have some picnic food! And there’s going to be cake too! Grampa Harry made a BIG cake!”
“I get it. But, just FUCK. Has Al seen that?”
“What do you think?”
“Wow. . . . .okay!”
“Merlin. Is that it?”
Okay, two more nights in the cozy cottage and then move to the city.
“ABSOLUTELY. Love it.”
One moment. I need to call the staff.
“Fine with me. Just remember that it wasn’t a prank and that Fred and I did it as a goodwill gesture at your behest.”
Are you nervous?
Alright then. Hit me with it.
It’s just assembly really. The main panels are done. I should have it ready to install the glass by noon.
“What do you mean in error?”
Harry’s roast beef with the potatoes, carrots and Yorkshire pudding.
“How can it be in this kind of shape?”
“Probably in better shape as well.”
“Cool! Who’s that?”
I’m good with it.
Just the production and owl order part. Not the retail. Mother says three weeks to open the retail and “develop more interest”.
“Wow.”
“He transported himself into the lobby. Said he broke his foot.”
“Why yes, that would be very nice. Thank you.”
The others?
Why not??????
Alright then, Potter. Promise me again that you’ll be safe with it. And no kids in it, EVER.
“It was a gift, but I never got the colour and it’s too big.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just you. I wanted you to see first."
“I thought I explained it pretty clearly.”
They’re nice photo’s though! I thought you guys looked cute!
“GRAMPA DRACOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!”
Yes. But don’t tease him about it. It took a lot of convincing.
“I see.”
It would yes. So, no real change then. Good.
“I don’t mind it anymore. I actually kinda love it now. Especially with this bearer thing. Things are going to change after the wedding, after the baby.”
. . . . . . . . . .
No need to be sorry. I just need to make sure to text you next time and warn you that we’re on the way. Did you ever eat?
I’ll try to quote because it was amazing: “I’m not a Doll and this is not a fashion show. This is a wedding. I can sew my own outfit if I have to! Get this into your head. I’m over 150 years old and I only want to look nice for my boys. Would you put your own grandmother in this getup? Answer the question!”
“Wait. . . . not yet.”
Just wanted you to know that we love it here. Could not be having a better evening AND everything is super tasty. Miss Cam says she’s got a vegan version of eggy bread that she’s going to make in the morning! Can’t wait for that.
Holding hands waking through the park and smelling flowers? The photographer took particular interest in photographing you from behind.
Really?
“Ready?”
He sure did!
“I can’t wait for our next party now. But that has to wait.”
“I’m sure it’s fine, Harry.”
“The one from when we were kids and she decided it was time to turn off the TV. It works on your phone too.”
“Yes.”
Do you need me to send it? I’ll send it! Who do you need me to send it to???
That was fast!
Make your fort then post a pic and we’ll judge.
. . . . . . . . . .
“It’s for tomorrow. . . . . . I’ve brought you this. . . . . . . .”
“There’s another one hundred and seventy to go. Maybe a few more . . . .”
“YES! Good job.”
The boys are getting nervous.
Merlin NO. This is hilarious.
“Yes.”
“Let’s just go sit on the platform edge so you can get used to it first.”
Something nice. You choose.
It’s much more than just special. We just don’t know how to thank you. And Miss Parks and everyone up there. There were actual fucking tears when we left.
I’m sure they just let him stand there in the conductors hat for the photo but LOOK AT HIM! I don’t think I’ve ever seen him smile like that!
“Thank you, Sir.”
“Don’t use it with the camomile though. It’s not good. Too bitter.”
“I already did.”
“WHAT?!”
“Everything I want yes. Oh wait my boomerang and coffee mugs. I’ll go back and get them.”
“Receiving parlour.”
Both Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy have agreed to participate.

Before we begin I’d like to announce that as Chief Warlock I order that all records that have not been sealed to protect the privacy of an individual be made available to any individual of the magical community on request. I also revoke the draconian secrecy rules and insist that all Wizengamot general meetings be opened to the public. The emergency meetings will be open to the public by default unless there is a specific privacy issue. Any meeting that involves a minor will be closed by default
Really?
I’m bringing Mione
—————————————
“Oh hell. What have we done?”
“I’ve eaten pizza before Draco.”
She’s gonna KILL me Draco. Laws! Wizengamot Seats! And you know what’s almost worse than that? Libraries! You just KNOW every single one of those damned properties is going to have a fucking Library! She’s going to AK me for sure this time!!!!
Harry dressed Draco for a change.
“Do you remember the time when Zebb nearly killed us for cooking fish in the house? I think it was trout fillets. Smelled horrible. . . . .did we try to bread it or something? I just remember it burnt into something that looked super sad and the smoke nearly knocked us all out.”
Will the proxy for the Prince seat please stand?
Not with you two NO. You’ll play spin the bottle or something and snog all night. Or walk around in half a towel!
“Papa Jamie, we need snacks!”
Do the Family thing on the following Wednesday? We need to let them all know in advance.
WAIT? What did I just agree to?
“(Sigh) So where do we go from here?”
MOST.
“Maybe. I’ve been around a lot of kids lately.”
“I don’t do it on purpose, Draco. It just happens! Besides, we were still sleeping. It still counts as sleep.”
“I like it empty like this.”
Please time your arrival between:
Sure, just show up whenever. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll move the crib into the master.
“That it is, but I wonder if they’ll be disappointed if they’re not all sorted together.”
Cool! I’m excited about it.
Love it.
Mykonos.
The wedding begins with the ethereal sound of a piano composition by Groy as the couple is escorted by Mr. Trandy and Ms. Zebb from the gardens into the atrium. Followed by their fathers, Albus and Scorpius continue to the atrium centre where the wedding is to take place.
Davey has decided that he doesn’t want to be Dave he’s sticking with Davey. So the Daverocket should technically be the Daveyrocket.
Did they actually just do it?????
He’s my ancestor. He built the manor that Mr. and Mrs. Brick will be working at.
“Just a common grass snake. She’s just visiting me.
Okay.
“WHAT?”
“Or another grandkid.”
Have a great week.
Fucking Prophet is going to catch wind of this!
Magical Theory. (McGonagall).
That may be true, but this is totally different. WTF. Even I like the suit and it’s comfortable. Mione says the tie brings out my eyes, and she’s got light colours and pearls. She looks amazing.
I know. Let’s celebrate at the Leaky! Hermione’s coming too.
I don’t really know? There is a history of that sort of thing.
He does, but I don't know about this ward. It works?
—————————————————————————
“Yeah, Rosie had it made. . . . . . . now, here we go Aspen.”
“Place the portkeys on the stacks and hand out treats while Grayson prints out the cover sheets and hands me the envelopes?”
Okay. THANK YOU AGAIN!
“Davey! Look!”
Mr. J. Liogell
“Let’s make this quick!”
Hold on, I’m trying to get Scorp back in here. Can we BAN a certain topic?
“What did you do to my Parents?”
There you go. Good plan. So how did you do it?
“HA! He’d have to put that in Knockturn.”
Hugo! Good job by the way!
You’re very welcome.
Pick another subject. Still not quidditch!
The second vault, I believe, is a little more complicated. I’ve decided that rather than have the remaining contents sent to charity or Evanescoed I want it put into storage for a few years so if my children have missed something they want the can still access it.
“So this is the first sitting room. I think I should just open all of the draperies too
“Try this belt. . . .”
And you as well, darling. Goodbye.
Your Uncle wants to chat with us.
That MOTHERFUCKING muggle registry legislation that comes up every year? FINALLY TOAST. Elfin business ownerships blocked? ABSOLUTELY NOT! BOOM, POW! Regulations on the Elfin unions and employment? NO FUCKING MORE YOU DINOSAURS! Elfin wand restrictions? FUCK THAT NO BIG! BOOM!
It just gets so tiring. Everyone sidesteps it. Ted knows who his parents were.
Bathroom floors replaced with marble tiles (same as what you did at the centre) except bathroom floor in the master replaced with white marble tile.
LOL Zebb is going to tell you how to keep Dad rattled. She’s good at it!
C/O Hollyhead Harpies Centre, Executive Offices
“They’ll come down eventually. ”
“Rose, You can’t just call that an aquarium.”
That’s so cool! I don’t believe that Dad’s going to let us use that freaking ballroom for a dance party. I’ll get Danika a list!
I’ll have Pops meet us at the dock!
“Sounds like a fair plan.”
“Our Mother’s set us up on a blind date.”
Trust me. The only people that matter already know and don’t care a fig. Fuck the rest of them.

“I know you’re joking, but still.”
“Tell me the truth about why you don’t want a birthday party?”
“I know. I just . . . . there’s a lot more in here you know?”
Or even better go in there and Fire Skeeter’s Arse. Then put them out of business.
“Correct. I have my notes. . . .He attended Hogwarts . . . .sorted Ravenclaw. Academically he is very skilled in theory and written work, however his magic is, I would say impaired. It’s believed that his magical core may have been damaged at a very young age. This may also have something to do with his smaller stature.. . . . . This has unfortunately caused a rift with his family, particularly his father. . . . . Parents divorced. Currently resides on the Isle of Man with his Mother and her current Husband. He did graduate Hogwarts with honours. He excels at organization. His magic, although diminished is adequate for most duties. . . . . I originally thought he might be good for Harry as more of an assistant. He’s very good with people and could run errands in and out of the magical world and particularly around the Grimmauld complex.”
That’s weeks away. I’ll do some research and find you the perfect outfit. Weather appropriate. Is it an indoor venue or outside festival thing?
Well this couple of photo’s didn’t like snowball or anything. So fucking typical.
“I’m not used to the kitchen. We must keep it clean.”
“Get out of here, Grayson!”
I’ve never seen anything quite like this before. Fantastic.
That’s SO COOL!
Done.
“Oh thank merlin.”
“Mirror adjusted!”
We were, but now it’s gotten a little foolish. There is even speculation that Scorpius has made perfumes for the baby.
“Which one?”
Shite.
Does she come in the building unannounced?
(See the end of the chapter for
“How much have you been drinking?”
We do?
OH YES PLEASE.
“Yes please Mother. This does at least cheer things up a bit.”
But we just thought he’d like to go? He sent us a nice note saying you were both coming and everything! I didn’t know there was a monster? How bad is it?
No he’s actually quite handsome.
“Do you still care for this cucumber body wash?”
“I’d like you to meet the boys and then after the visit, we talk about what you think. I really am sorry to drop this on you unexpectedly. I want them together. It’s not the fault of the foster family, they are good people who just had a life changing event.”
Oh Cool!
“Okay?”
“When Seamus has finished the guest level, the “ballroom” will be ready to fix up. You’ll have this one table in the center of the room for your big running display. A matching table but smaller with taller legs by one of the windows to work at? A rolling stool? Would you like that?”
“I like that!”
LIAR. There’s that whole gay thing.
“They were baby fireworks though? Strip. Let me hang those up for you.”
I think he’ll do good? He know’s we don’t want that. But Scorp and I are still nervous about the wedding. Crazy Grandmothers.
“Yes. Your Dads will join us. Davey tell me about this necklace. I love it.”
——————————————————————————
Guess who the first customer was?
“Why would they? None of them have a driving license. They all ride brooms and apparate everywhere. They’re all going to want a ride in your speedster though! If one of the kids wanted a driving license I’d let them drive one.”
APOTHICAIRE DRAGONNE
No I’m really not. The kid is quite handsome? I guess? The girls think so? Who am I to judge a goblin kid?
Louis will probably win.
“I’ll talk with Uncle Sev about Dec at the penthouse.”
“Was that down there too?”
“That’s not what I meant.”
Luna's interview with Draco.
“Yes. I’ll write it up when we’re done.”

“I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”
“Promise.”
“Grayson.”
I was trying to stay out of it?
The portrait is not excluded to just the manor, Decram can/does travel to other properties. That’s apparently why he’s up on current things? I don’t really understand it but that’s what he said.
“Hugo and Grayson are going to help with your books. HEY OVER HERE!”
LOL Lily. You’re talking about your Dad and Draco.
We know that Scorp is sitting in your lap. Fill him in Al.
“Let’s ask Luna?”
“She wasn’t. Your mother’s testimony in that divorce trial is what convinced the judge to give you custody. They actually do that shite. Judy spoke out of line in that call. Those weren’t idle threats. They have a whole underground network of crazies. Most of them are followers of Judy’s father. Do you trust me?”
LLL: Favorite pastry?
Yes, well you know the artist of course, Edward Lupin. I did commission it to go with the sculpture. Edward is quite a sought out artist. He’s working on a mural at the moment that is quite a mystery.
“Well, it was after Lucius offed himself in Azkaban. Mother seemed to turn a page. It was subtle at first, then when Scorpius was born she came to me for a long conversation. That’s a story for another day. Considering where we all started and how far we’ve come I think we’ve done pretty damned good. Our kids are all level headed, grounded and despite the obvious, they know the actual value of things and not just in a superficial way. They do understand that it’s unusual, and that they have been given a life that others don’t receive. Shift your knee.”
“I wish we didn’t have to leave so quickly”
“Just wait til you see what we have planned for the Snape exhibit!”

Pantry, no changes just clean and paint.

MR. JAY LIOGELL
And I’ve informed the managers at both Wales and France that I will be based in London for the foreseeable future. I’m going to only sporadically pop in every couple of days for at least the next 2 weeks and most likely until after the wedding if they can handle it?
“Long or short term?”
Ugly Hourglass. I wouldn’t even use that thing as an egg timer. And she was supposedly counting down to what? Time to go kill the girl? For a pair of shoes??? WHY?
“You could. The wand thing.”
“YES!!!”
We’re having lunch with the Elfs in the great hall.

and he warned me that it could happen. . . .
Oh fuck no.
I’ll be home in about 45 minutes.
Alright, I’d like to do that next week sometime.
“It’s a professional vow for mind healers.”
Of course.
“What about Mr. Malfoy?”
It’s GOOD. It doesn’t look out of place at all. It looks like it’s been there a hundred years. And then she’s cleaned up the upper floors and lit it from inside. It’s dramatic but it just fits. The whole Alley is excited.
“Yes. Of course.”
Please. I’ll do an impression of Scorpius pouting if you can get him in here.
“In a certain way, yes. A Family vow, by choice to be clear. We’ll continue this conversation on another day. Today you have school shopping to do.”
“Merlin. This can’t be good.”
“La Villa Schutzenberger, and yes that’s a very good comparison. It is much larger than that though . . . The kitchens will be through the back.”
I’ll see you soon. Shall I meet you at the gates then?
“Alright that’s all I need for the measurements. . . . Hugo I want you to just sit there and look pretty. Don’t bother us while we’re making decisions.”
“It really looks like winter in here!”
Circumstances at this time have made me reconsider.
“Scorp is another example. He grew up with all the excess of Malfoy Manor and his Grandmother. He turned out okay despite it. Let me tell you that wasn’t easy either. When he was born it was like my Mother had an epiphany.”
“Good call, Harry.”
“Lucy come here for a sec?”
Small emergency!

“Okay, so what are we going to do after I’ve manhandled you and kissed all of the appropriate and inappropriate places?”
“OH JEZUSFUCKINGMERLIN!”
“Please make it turquoise for me.”
The office of Mr. Grayson Elliot!
“Let’s save the comics for Cliff Cottage. . . . . Maybe I’ll write and doodle in my “crazy idea book”. You can pull out a few of your monster art or potions books or something.”
So excited! Cannot get over it! Over. The. Moon!
No question. Teddy even says so. The Saito guy is also super nice . . . . I think he was in Slytherin. Same year as Grayson?”
Please advise.
I’m sure! Bring anyone you’d like but try to keep it to Family.
“Sun catchers Grampa calls them. You didn’t see the boys when we showed them. That was something. GG Arthur is their new Merlin.”
it’s perfect.”
Are you sure? I thought you were going to pass out for a second.
“Thanks, Draco. It’s not done yet, but we’re so close. Oh, you’ve got to see this, come up this way to the dining. This is what was under that fucking green plaid carpet.”
What can I do for you?

Let’s please just include them all in both events. If the non-family order members choose not to attend the dinner afterwards it’s fine.

I’m sorry to bother your peaceful time, but we have a small issue with the junk shop.

Okay, I’ll agree.
Phil will do it. I’ll call him. Have him do his jazz/chill mix.

“Oh merlin. This is going to be epic.”
Is that fucking Susan Bones?!
“Yes, and I know your hair isn’t purple to match the lavender, but it will do.”
You can try but it might be too late. There’s a time difference of eight hours. I’ll get you his contact information.
That will be good.
“I think most of the family is coming, Harry.”
Woah. Is it really that bad?

“Why not? That sounds pathetic.”

No problem. Love you bye!
“You have Arthur photographs and Jerry’s drawings.”
Yes. She’s taking a position at Hogwarts and want’s to live in London. She’s best friends with my niece Rose who lives in number 65? with Hugo. Thought we’d try to see what’s available. Wouldn’t be moving for another month or so.
“The flutes are pretty too! Thank you Narcissa.”
OH NO.
If it went further than a date?
“Of course! Hop in. We’re not going far there’s a queue!”
“Yes things move quickly. Unfortunately that isn’t unusual. You will need to get used to how Harry operates. . . . He will try to spoil you. You’ll need to adjust to that. . . . He will try to pass off his ideas as far fetched but they really are not. He makes decisions that seem spur of the moment but really a lot of thought goes into them.”
“Ferret?” he called, the moment his feet touched down. “It’s Weasel! Where are you, mate?”
It was too late. Draco was already in the fireplace, spinning, disappearing in a flash of silver hair and green flames.
“Look here!” Ron urged, lifting the adamant hand from the straw beside him and slipping it between the bars to hold it out toward the other boy. “Look what I’ve got!”
“Back off, MacMillan,” Robards growled.
Her shoulders abruptly sagged in relief. “I knew he was only trying to frighten us, but even so…” Then she turned away, biting her lips. “My nephew has a gift for the dramatic that can be amusing, under the right circumstances, but I’m afraid I am not inclined to laugh.”

"I've heard that before, but I never believed it,” Sarah said in a matter-of-fact way.
"I am planning to bring as many of my students through this crisis alive as I possibly can."
“What’s wrong with Rosie?” he asked, as he automatically crossed to the sink to fill the kettle.
He halted his attempt to drag Harry forward and turned to face him again. "Isn't that what you want?"
Krum nodded. A taciturn man, himself, he seemed to find it perfectly acceptable that Draco answered him so briefly. He pointed to the child on Draco’s lap and growled, “That is not yours. You are not vun of them.” A flap of his arm took in the hoard of Weasleys around them.
"But you
“No, he’s not.” Robards let the scroll close and lifted furious eyes to his underling. “Go find him and…”
"I expect you to hold your temper and let me handle it."
"Harry! Oh, Harry, my dear!" Mrs. Weasley surged toward him with both hands outstretched to catch his and tears in her eyes. "Thank goodness you're all right!"
“Nothing, thank Merlin.”
Fucking hormones.
“The letter says I can go to the Manor…”
“Draco.” Those liquid-silver eyes fastened on him and Harry fancied that he could see his own face reflected in them, so enormous were they. “You don’t have to suck me off every time I get hard.”
“It was fucking amazing.” The utter conviction in his tone left no room for doubt. “
Draco's shoulders stiffened and his breath came more quickly. "You sound awfully sure of yourself."
"You need to know nothing."
Don't worry. I won't keep our boys apart for long. I hate it when I have to wade through twenty chapters (or even ten) to see Harry and Draco together, so I promise not to put you through that!
Then he added, silently,
“I suppose.” The warmth drained from his face, leaving it drawn and sad. “I asked if I could go to the Manor, just once, before they take it.”
Draco looked up, startled.
Harry did not move. “What’s Prewett doing here?”
“What are you doing to him?” Harry asked, still using his quiet, soothing voice and hoping Draco could only hear the tone, not the words, in his current state.
Apparently not, because his mouth was already opening of its own accord, and words were coming out of it that he had not given his brain permission to form. At the last moment, he closed his eyes so he wouldn’t have to see the triumph in Potter’s face as he said them.
Draco complied, folding his knees and tucking them against Harry’s ribs. Then, as Harry found and fingered his opening, he groaned softly, rolled his hips and arched his back, spreading himself wantonly. Another wandless spell, and Harry’s fingers were slick with lubricant.
“Not bloody likely.”
"If he muffs it, yeh jus' tell him again. Ron's a good sort. He won' never hurt yeh on purpose, Harry."
Now she wished that she had taken that extra step. Surely anyone as savvy and cunning as Nero would know what her green robes signified. She could almost hear him laughing at her.
Harry shrugged. “When is there ever? Can you help, at least?”
Potter leaned forward, as if straining to hear or just to be closer to him. “Doing what?”
“And she didn’t ask you to pay a call on Boggs in your free time?”
A swift, piercing glance at Harry, and McGonagall motioned him to follow. "Yes, Potter, you'd better come, too. I suspect, in the end, you're the only one he wants to see.”
” the Gryffindor gasped, even as Draco uttered a growl of frustration and knotted his fists in the front of Harry’s shirt to pull him close again.
“For what? Joining the lynch mob?” She flinched, and he instantly felt guilty. “Sorry, I… sorry,” he muttered.
Draco scowled at his teasing. “Fine. We both know who has the delusional fangirls in this relationship, and it’s not me.”
He wanted to get up and pace his cell, to keep his blood circulating, but he had no will to move anymore. The end was coming, very soon, and he would welcome it. He only hoped that it would come quickly for all of them, that Harry and Draco and the others wouldn’t suffer any more than they already had. And that little Iffy would never know what she had missed. Maybe, if she never heard the name Harry Potter, she’d never realize what her life could have been if her father had found her in time. Poor Iffy. Poor Ferret. And poor Harry, to lose them both so soon!
“Saved him from Lord Voldemort’s vengeance?”
“Yes, Ma’am.”
"I'm not going to fail Charms, because you can't keep away from your boyfriend for one evening!"
“Yeah,” Harry said.
Hermione hummed into her tea cup but did not venture an opinion on his Veela son’s likely transgression. Harry knew full well that what he considered a minor incident (such as conjuring live animals for the amusement of his housemates, which Felix had been chastised for doing more than once) would rank as a serious crime in Hermione’s very ordered world. Her own children were (to Harry’s way of thinking) pathologically well-behaved and would be drastically improved by a bit of Felix’s free-spirited approach to education.
“I know you can, Urchin, but not the kind I need. Harry?” He let a hint of pleading creep into his gaze. “Are we okay?”
Dumbledore eyed her coldly for a moment, then asked, "Was he thinking clearly when he tried to jump to his death from a window to escape a group of students in black robes?"
"No, you were right the first time. Don't apologize anymore." Ron gazed at him for a moment, seeing the weariness and despair in him, then said, gruffly, "You should go to bed. Get some sleep."
Draco tried to smile, one corner of his mouth lifting, but it didn’t touch his eyes. In the next second, it was gone. They reached the lift, and while they waited for it to arrive, they found themselves standing in an awkward group, not knowing exactly what to say to each other. To everyone’s surprise, it was Draco who broke the silence.
“I doubt that, considering that they lionize you for your Quidditch skills, whereas I’m the town prostitute.”
"Every time."
“We’re not done here,” Achilles snarled.
How had he survived so long without this? Without Harry? How had he endured the emptiness, the loneliness, the hideous brutal fucking that had no love or warmth in it? No
“I don’t know anything, except that you and Potter are both a bit too sure of yourselves. You’re sure Malfoy is guilty. Potter is sure he’s innocent. Neither of you are looking at the evidence objectively.”
Draco just hummed and tucked his hand into Harry’s, both too tired and too content to rise to the bait. He’d wage war over the baby’s name tomorrow, after he’d regained a bit of his strength and honed his rapier wit. For now, he just wanted to enjoy having his firstborn, his miracle daughter and his imbecile of a husband all to himself.
"Oh." Draco managed to look hurt, but Harry wasn't fooled for a second. For the first time since the link had been severed, he felt as though he were once again sharing his awareness, his emotions, his very life's blood with the other boy, and he knew that Draco was neither hurt nor angry. He was afraid.
“Drink it down,” Potter murmured, the glass still resting against Draco’s lips.
Harry had nothing to say to this, so he opted instead to slide closer to Draco and gather the smaller boy into his arms. Draco came to him willingly, as he always did no matter what his mood, and lay against his chest. His body was warm and pliant, but his face was cold and desolate, even when held close in his lover’s embrace.
The power seemed to flow into Voldemort's hand, then down into Draco's body. The boy lying spread-eagled on the great table gave a tearing cry. His back arched and his throat contracted, as he choked on another cry. Then he collapsed, going frighteningly limp, and his head rolled brokenly to one side so that Ron could see his ashen face.
Ron scrambled to his feet and pounded across the grass at Harry's heels. As they drew closer, Draco looked up, his face a white smudge in the darkness, and screamed, "
“I can stay with you, if you want.”
“Not even
“Yes. He’s furious with them. He… he threatened to give the baby to them, since they’re the ones who wanted it, but I talked him out of it. Only, no one deserves to have Lucius Fucking Malfoy as a parent!”
"It's okay. I should have known better."
“I don’t know. Maybe.”
“I felt you looking. Mostly it was when we were leaving the Hall, and you came out with Granger and Weasley.”
“I can’t. He’s still so fragile, so wounded…”
“No, I can’t. It isn’t safe. Please, Harry,” he twisted in the taller boy’s arms, turning to face him and wrapping his own arms around his waist. The face he lifted to Harry’s was streaked with tears and contorted with pain, but his voice was firm when he said, “I just want to sleep. Will you stay here with me? Hold me while I sleep? It… it helps.”
“More than a week.”
” When the tumult began to subside, she went on at a slightly less shattering volume, “
“Biscuit?” Harry held out a plate of shortbread.
If he closed the cabinet, the Death Eaters would come through it. If he closed the cabinet, he might survive the night—as Voldemort’s bond-slave—but Dumbledore likely would not. If he closed the cabinet, Harry would never forgive him. But if he did not?
Narcissa gazed searchingly at him for a long minute. Then, quite suddenly, she smiled and pulled him down so she could kiss his forehead. Her hands slid around his neck, holding his cheek against hers.
: Well, there you have it. I knew I couldn't please everyone with this chapter, since Draco either had to remember or not, with no middle ground. But I hope that those who didn't get their way on that head enjoyed the chapter, just the same. :) We're almost done with this story – two more chapters to go – but Story Number Three is in the works, and it is chock-full of lovely, lovely angst, so those who are disappointed that Draco remembers, do not despair! Voldemort isn't done with our boys yet.
“Yes.” She sniffled and smiled, her eyes dwelling fondly on the sleeping man and baby. “I told him I’d knit some Gryffindor booties for Iffy as soon as I get out of here.”
"I know." His words, quiet as they were, halted her in her tracks.
“I know. That’s how we made our baby—with love and magic—and that’s why we should…”
“Tell me about your healer visit,” she chirped.
Slowly, reluctantly, Draco took the scroll from Harry’s outstretched hand. He just held it for a long moment, letting it curl back on itself and hide the familiar copper-plate script, his eyes on the paper but seeing nothing. Then Harry’s voice touched him again.
Harry reached out instinctively to touch him. Draco's skin was burning hot to the touch, and his body was utterly still, rigid under Harry's fingers, locked in place by McGonagall's binding hex. Harry fastened both hands around Draco's arm, leaned over to press his forehead to the backs of his own hands, shut his eyes, and threw every particle of strength he possessed into the link. As he emptied himself into the other boy's body, he chanted silently, over and over again,
Harry moved to take him in his arms, but Draco turned abruptly away again to confront his image in the mirror. His features were rigid, his spine ramrod straight, his head tilted at an arrogant angle, but Harry saw the insecurity and fear in every line of his body. He might as well have been screaming and weeping. Harry privately wished that he would, if only to let the tension out of his body.
“None,” Harry proclaimed smugly, his arm snaking around Draco’s waist and his free hand sliding down his naked flank.
Harry’s face heated and his smile stretched still wider. “I certainly hope that's what the Patronus is all about.”
A fit of violent shivering gripped him, and he grunted again, as if he were trying not to cry out. Harry rose onto his knees and slipped an arm about his shoulders to let him feel his warmth.
The dog loped to a halt at Harry's shoulder and, under the stunned eyes of Draco Malfoy, turned into Sirius Black.
“What do you want?” Harry said coldly.
Draco felt a wave of vertigo hit him and the room swam out of focus. For a terrible moment, he wanted nothing more in this life than to feel her arms around him and hear her soft, beguiling voice whisper love in his ear. Then he remembered why he was here. His resolve stiffened. He set his teeth and raised his eyes to meet hers.
“And if I slip? If he finds out?”
Harry watched through pain-blurred eyes as Hermione bullied a protesting Ron around the screen and out of earshot. Then he slid off the bed and padded over to where Malfoy lay.
going to do?"
before it even touched my head.”
He accepted the baby, tucked her expertly into the crook of his arm, and smiled down into her wide, brown eyes. She seemed perfectly happy to have Uncle Harry’s attention and immediately fell quiet. Her chin was slick with drool, and when she smiled beatifically at him, he could see two slivers of tooth poking through her lower gum.
“She…” He broke off to clear his throat, then gave a wracking cough. When he began again, his voice sounded like sandpaper on metal. “She looked in my head. She wanted to know about… about something I did.”
follow through. Another thing you should know better than anyone.”
"Why what?"
“Don’t want to,” Harry said again, more stubbornly.
“Call me Rita, please. There’s no need for such old friends to stand on ceremony.”
Draco returned a few minutes later, hair and makeup repaired, dressed neatly in trousers, shirt and boots. He accepted the robes that Harry handed him, let his husband slide them up his arms, then turned and smiled at Harry as he fastened them down the front. Harry made a point of fastening each of the tiny silver buttons down his forearms by hand, fitting the tight inner sleeves to his arms, then adjusting the fall of the loose outer sleeves. They were folded back to expose a lining of purple and blue paisley silk and pinned above his elbows with jewels that matched the ones in his hair.
"I don't know how he did it, Harry, and you're right. It is impossible. Or it should be." Dumbledore knelt beside Draco, still peering intently at him. "How extraordinary!"
“I’ve been meaning to ask you about that,” Harry said. “For years I’ve just assumed that I have to be the one to kill Voldemort, but honestly, I have no idea how! I can disarm him, stun him maybe, but what good is that against the most powerful Dark wizard of all time?”
“So, how do you make a
” A huge, shining, silver stag erupted from the tip of his wand and landed in the exact spot that Draco had just vacated.
Draco felt an instantaneous surge of power inside him and the pain of his hand almost vanished. With a wordless grunt of protest, he tried to pull his hand from Potter's clasp. Potter's fingers tightened around it, holding him, and whatever he was doing with the link kept Draco from feeling the pressure of his grip.
“I didn’t speak to the Accused. He was at Azkaban and out of my reach. The Head Auror told me that Draco was their primary suspect in the Memory Thief crimes, and that I was also a suspect because I had given him an alibi for several of the attacks.”
“It was fucking amazing.” The utter conviction in his tone left no room for doubt. “
“What? No! I mean…” Draco paused, frowned. “I’ve never thought about it.”
"Poor
Again, he waited for a response that didn’t come. Leaning over to brace one hand on the back of Draco’s chair and the other on the table top, he said, more menacingly, “Here’s how this is going to work, Malfoy. We’re going to ask you questions. You’re going to answer them. Promptly. Politely. With none of your cheek. When we’re done, if you’ve been a good boy, maybe we won’t throw your well-used arse in Azkaban, pending trial for murder.”
“I’ll be at it all bloody day! And it’s
“Nero!” Draco shrieked.
It was a man. The most beautiful man Harry had ever seen. The heavy makeup he wore made him look inhuman, as if his face were cast in porcelain instead of flesh and blood, but the eyes that gazed out at the room from beneath blackened lashes were alive. Sad, wary, almost haunted, but definitely alive. And his hands—long and white and graceful—made Harry’s throat ache when they moved to push back his hair once more.
"Then you're the first Slytherin in history who didn't!"
“Then go find my son, before something dreadful happens to him.”
A ghost of a sneer passed over Lucius’ face, quickly banished. “That boy is family. We care for him. We want to see him thrive and, ultimately, come into his full power. That is not a Pureblood right; it is every wizard’s right.” His eyes cut over to Granger, challenging her. “Is that not why we welcome Half-blood and Muggleborn children into our world? So they can reach their full magical potential and strengthen all of us with their gifts?”
“Ah, well,” Umbridge sat forward in her seat, inserting her sickly-sweet voice into the conversation for the first time, “if you’ll excuse me saying so Albus, that is the crux of the problem.”
“Harry, please.”
“I love these jeans.”
The uncharacteristic stupidity of that question pushed Harry over the edge into howling rage. “I don’t fucking
Finally, Madam Pauncefoot gave a snort and said, “Yes, he’s positively gibbering.”
A plump, motherly figure, who bore no resemblance whatsoever to Sirius Black, turned away from he hearth to greet him. Harry came to an abrupt halt in the doorway, utterly taken aback to find her here.
He’d meant it to sound dry, but it came out doubtful. Thanks to his recent ordeal, he had learned to view the obsessive devotion of house-elves with suspicion. He wasn’t at all sure that he wanted to live with one bowing and scraping and fawning all over him, his speech to Harry about the duty ancient Wizard families owed to their elf retainers notwithstanding.
And he remembered.
Harry circled the table and dropped into a chair. Kreacher had left a china teapot and a few cups on the table next to a plate of chocolate shortbread. Harry grabbed a biscuit and took a hungry bite. It felt like he hadn’t eaten in a week.
“Stop it, you insufferable git! You’re worse than my blood-sucking mother!”
"I don't want to talk about Granger," he said, firmly.
Draco said nothing and did not turn to face them, but Harry knew that he was listening.
The sudden heat on his chilled flesh could only be Potter’s smile. “Brilliant! I’ll help you pack!”
"Mum would never forgive us if we let a rodent run free in her house."
"Oh, no!" Hermione put out a pleading hand toward Madam Pomfrey. "You must tell us,
"Let's get him out of here," Dumbledore said, speaking to another dark blob on the fringes of Harry's sight. "Harry? Can you stand?"
The guard behind him tilted his head back again. The other pressed glass to his lips. Draco swallowed burning-hot liquid that seared down his throat and into his cringing stomach. He gasped, wretched, choked on bile, clenched his watering eyes shut. The fist in his hair loosened, and he slumped forward onto the table.
flying in bloody circles!”
“There’s really a way,” he insisted, turning on Hermione once more. “You found a way to get a wizard pregnant. A spell that we could use, right now, if we wanted to.”
“So, what are you going to do today?”
He fell asleep in minutes, a smile on his face and his dragon lying against his heart.
“Just take it off!” Draco choked out.
“He should know you’re awake.”
“I am telling you.”
“Just say it.” He waved a hand in Harry and Ron’s general direction. “Whatever it is, they’re both going to hear about it soon enough.”
Harry looked around dazedly, seeing the scarlet curtains on his bed and the scattered belongings of his roommates through a fog of pain. Seamus had thrown his dirty robes on the floor. Dean had left several drawings strewn across his bed and rug, and had spilled ink on the coverlet. Neville had forgotten his Remembrall – again – leaving it on his pillow. Only Harry's belongings, which he had not touched since hastily packing for the trip to London yesterday, were where the house elves had put them, in perfect order and unused. The neatness of his bed, compared to the comfortably messy beds of the others, only served to impress upon him how little he belonged here.
“Yes, it’s me. Look.” He cast a wandless
Harry held him, one hand behind his head, the other on his hip, feeling the aftershocks rip through him and listening to the small, helpless noises he made.
“No, she’s definitely sweet on you. It took me months to rate a ‘my dear,’ and you’ve got one on your second visit. Though, granted, she probably wants to feed and mother you, rather than pinch your bum.”
" She caught his hand and tried to drag him down the hallway. He resisted her for a moment, then broke into a shambling run at her side. "We have to get to Dumbledore!"
“I don’t know.” Draco swallowed the lump forming in his throat. “When did you do this?”
You’re an extra, now.”
He was confused. In pain. Desperate to escape, if only into the death he knew awaited him. He tried to fight them, to swallow the words, but they always managed to drag them out. And once they started, they wouldn’t stop. Instead of simply parroting what they said to him, he began to imagine his own crimes, his own horrors, his own depraved longings that he poured out for their enjoyment…
"Come on, Harry, it's not so bad." Hermione gave his leg a shake and urged, sensibly, "We're not making fun of you, honestly. Were you, Ron?"
“I shamed both of us. I called for you, when I…” His chest heaved on a sob. “
"It was Firenze did the savin'. He said they all agreed, but I could tell he was stretchin' the truth jus' a bit. The rest of them were all around the clearin', watchin', jus' waitin' for an excuse ter stomp us all flat. I figured they could change their minds any time, so I got Harry an' Malfoy outta there, right quick."
“Practice your Aegis Charms for the next class,” Flitwick called, as they shoved their desks back into position and began to collect their belongings. “Each of you must contain your partner for five minutes.”
Harry sat very quietly on the end of the bed, staring at Draco's bent head and wondering why no emotion was coming through the link to him. He could feel the summoning charm and the insistent pain of unhealed wounds, but no emotion, no presence, nothing that he could identify as Draco. The silence and blankness stretched on for several minutes, while Harry's chest grew tight with pain and his fists knotted in helpless frustration. But still the link was empty, as if Draco Malfoy had been erased somehow.
” He jabbed his fork at Harry to underscore his words. “
"All of those already identified as Death Eaters and a few who are only suspected. Then there are the parents who are simply afraid."
“I tried to tell Kingsley that, to convince him to clear Draco’s name, but…”
If that fact alone weren’t enough, the tone of his voice and the words coming out of his mouth would have told Harry that this was something special. A once-in-a-lifetime moment. If he shattered it now, it would never come again.
Dumbledore nodded once and drew his wand. With a single twitch of it, he banished the lunch tray. “Lie down and make yourself comfortable.”
“As an undertaker.”
Harry stared dispassionately at him, as if studying a bug pinned to a card, not caring that a room full of wizards were watching him throttle one of his colleagues.
“Well, I’m glad you’re a Ravenclaw.”
Draco sighed his appreciation, but it changed abruptly to a whimper as need clenched viciously at his guts. His skin was suddenly burning hot, and his cock lay hard and throbbing up his belly.
“You needed it,” she pointed out reasonably. “Without it, you never would have defeated Voldemort and we’d all be dead or enslaved.”
“Huh?” Ron lifted his head to show her a swollen, blotchy face and running nose.
“Yes.”
“Papa?” an anxious voice called.
Draco turned the strange, colorful notes in his hands, frowning. “Harry, I can’t…”
More healing, this time with the Weasleys. Because you know Harry can't do without the Weasleys.
“I’m sorry, Malfoy,” Snape said quietly.
“There’s a Vanishing Cabinet. In the Room of Hidden Things. It’s broken now, but when it works, it connects to one in a shop called Borgin and Burke’s in Knockturn Alley.”
Their mouths met, melted together, feasted on each other, while Draco moaned his encouragement. His blood was singing, burning, rushing to his cock, which was already threatening to burst his jeans. He tightened his arms around Harry’s neck, letting the taller man’s shoulders take his weight, and hooked one leg around his hips. Harry responded by grasping his arse in both hands to pull their groins together.
“On the kitchen table.”
“I don’t mean to upset you, my darling boy. I’m only trying to help you keep what you value most. Harry loves you, of that I have no doubt, but love comes at a price. You of all people—a Malfoy raised in the oldest traditions of pureblood society—should recognize that. If you’re not willing to pay that price, you will lose him.”
“Right.”
He eyed her narrowly and demanded, “Just you and me, yeah?”
Harry’s smile widened. “How else am I going to win an argument with you?”
“Why this sudden concern for my love life?”
“Are you going to give him Bob, once we have our own baby?”
“Happy now?” Harry demanded, as he climbed under the covers again.
Draco and Harry both laughed at that.
“You’re going after those children?” He nodded. “This is a terrible gamble. What if it’s a trap and Narcissa’s timely gifts are the bait?”
Harry gaped at the pictures, too shocked even to absorb what they meant, for a full thirty seconds. Then he heard Ron mutter, “Thought you’d want to know,” and his brain jerked back into gear. His eyes scanned the first few paragraphs.
– is so anxious for You-Know-Who to have him, I'll never understand."
Draco felt his face heat, but he kept his head up and his voice level. He did not want to say any of these things or expose himself to Harry in this way, but he had agreed to tell the truth. And if he were going to speak this kind of truth, then perhaps this tall, isolated tower in the middle of a frozen night, where he and Harry were pinned up against the stars and utterly alone, was the one safe place to do it.
“Because it’s got their grimy fingerprints all over it,” Harry retorted. “Maybe they didn’t make the complaint themselves, but they certainly arranged for it.”
He turned a page and reached for the floating glass. The cat stirred, lifting its head to fix him with a cynical gaze.
"I'm sorry, Crabbe!" Hermione shouted. He paused, caught off guard, and she repeated more quietly, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that."
They both turned to see Jewel struggling to climb through the hole with her twisted foot and misshapen leg. Her face was flushed an angry red, her eyes snapping.
“Yes. Only he didn’t go into Hogsmeade, like the others. Someone came onto the castle grounds and took him, but we couldn’t figure out who. Or how.”
“And this was somehow a sign that I was dying?” Draco asked, struggling not to laugh in the face of his son’s distress.
Draco cracked an eye open. “Returns from where?”
“You’ll have to lock the place down. Get Neville and Goldstein to help you. Maybe Cho and her partner. But don’t let anyone off this rock ’til you’ve found out who’s involved. And go to Kingsley if you need anything, not to Robards!”
“Come along,” Rose said, in a voice as bossy and important as any her mother could produce. “The grown-ups want to talk.”
"Of course. It's conveniently close to the Ministry and quite safe from Voldemort's agents."
"Careful it doesn't bite you, Harry."
Before Harry could find an answer, Hermione spoke up on the other side of him. "What's that thing on his face, Harry?"
But where? And, most importantly, where was Narcissa? Had the Unmentionables packed her off to France again, before she got to see her son even once?
I hope you enjoy it! Please let me know what you think of the story so far.
Just what he feared, he had no idea. It was lost in the yawning blackness that had swallowed two months of his life, but it was not gone. No. It definitely still lived somewhere inside him, awaiting its chance to leap out of the shadows and sink its claws into his quivering flesh. Harry kept it at bay. Auntie Genie. Even Dumbledore, odd as that seemed to him. When they were not with him, he retreated to the cushioned window seat provided by the Room of Requirement and watched sunlight and shadow creep across the Hogwarts grounds, watched and waited and tried not to think, until night fell and the stars came out. Then he could lose himself in their beauty and feel something close to whole for a while.
“You ’eard. Blighter’s dead.”
“Calm yourself, Mr. Potter. Remember your delicate condition.” As he spoke, the man flicked his wand at the Shield charm, sealing it at his back. Then he turned his wand on Draco and added, with entirely false solicitude, “You wouldn’t want any harm to come to your child.”
"It's not the same, Harry. Your scar made you famous. What does this one make me?"
In which Hermione is a fast healer, Harry is incurably noble, Draco is sullen, Sirius is worried, and no one is happy.
Also, a HUGE thank you to everyone who commented on the first chapter! I know I haven't answered you, and I'm sorry, but I was immersed in this chapter and didn't want to derail myself. I promise you that I've read and treasured every word!
“No reason,” he muttered. Then, abruptly, he pulled the Marauder’s Map from his pocket and thrust it into Hermione’s hands. “Just keep an eye out for him, please. He’ll probably stay in the Room of Requirement half the night, but if he comes out before I get back, tell him where I’ve gone.”
Snape shot him a narrow look. “You’ve been letting Crabbe in on your private study sessions?”
he wanted! The rest of it was just a figment of his overstressed imagination. A symptom of the enforced closeness of the Blood Link.
"I don't know. That's not the point."
“You’re moving again. That has to be a good sign.”
“Nnngh…
This time, Harry did not look to Dumbledore for permission. Instead, he ducked his head to avoid the Headmaster's gaze, tightened his hold on Draco, and murmured into the soft tangle of his hair, "Terrible things happened, Draco, things too dreadful to bear, and we erased your memory of them so they couldn't hurt you. Professor Dumbledore has some of those memories in a Pensieve, and when your Healer says you're strong enough to stand it, I'll take you into them and show you what happened. But until then, you
“Even in those jeans?” Ginny needled, a wicked glint in her eyes as they raked his slender form.
Hermione thought, as her eyes traveled around the Great Hall and saw nearly every head turn away surreptitiously. She tried not to let it bother her - a necessary skill for Harry's friends - but it was very difficult when she didn't have Harry beside her, holding his head up proudly under all those avid stares. If Harry were okay, none of this would matter to her. But Harry was definitely not okay, and no one knew this better than Hermione. She and Ron had done their best, but he had withdrawn into a haze of pain and depression that they could not penetrate.
"Voldemort! It's Voldemort!" he shouted, once again trying to shake the charm loose from Draco's hand.
With that, he turned on his heel and started back up the way he had come.
His wand fell. The nappy collapsed into a fetid pile at his feet.
Draco looked around for something to throw at him and could only find his scroll. “Git!”
“No. Not a chance. You almost
Snape cut him off with a burst of cold laughter. "Potter's no coward. He's a damned fool of boy, running headlong into trouble and dragging everyone in range with him, but he's no coward. No. He didn't push Malfoy into this or intentionally put him in danger. Malfoy made his choice." He bared his teeth in something that was not a smile and added, harshly, "And I think it's about time you all learned to respect that choice."
Before the old wizard could answer, they heard another bloodcurdling scream, but this one did not come from the battlements, and it was not Voldemort making it. Harry instantly recognized the voice.
“My mother took a lot of it. Harry and I kept some books and photographs. And a piano.”
"I know." Draco made a fastidious face and cast a sidelong glance at Harry's plate. "He eats them all the time."
This wasn’t a problem for him in practical terms. He spent almost no time in the Slytherin dungeon, choosing to study in the library or the broom closet and to sleep in the big bed he shared with Harry, even when the Gryffindor couldn’t join him there. It was no great hardship to step around a group of First Years playing Exploding Snap on the floor or to walk the castle corridors without a hulking, great pair of goons beside him. He couldn’t really even object when he caught a faint sneer thrown in his direction, given what he knew about himself and his family.
choice – not mine, not Dumbledore's, and
"Do we take it off?" McGonagall asked.
“We aren’t the ruddy Wizengamot. You don’t win anything by overawing us with your magnificence.”
Well, that's it, the end of the story. I hope you enjoyed it. I certainly enjoyed spending so much time with my boys.
“But that means Bill didn’t really want to marry Fleur! He was just cursed by her Veela magic!”
“And you gave them to her. You gave her the power to destroy the person I love best in this world. So you’ll understand why a simple ‘I’m sorry’ doesn’t cut it!”
“Duh. No magic.”
He didn’t know if it was a dream or a memory, something that had really happened or a fantasy that his mind had constructed for his pleasure, and he didn’t care. He was safe in Harry’s arms. That’s all he wanted.
“For now.”
“You didn’t know. I didn’t want you to know.”
Draco felt his cheeks burn afresh. “Mrs. Weasley, I…”
In fact, Andromeda’s decision to tell his parents about the new baby had caused Draco’s little family a great deal of harm. It was thanks to her that they lived as veritable prisoners behind their wards, waiting for his parents’ next assault. But for all that Draco wanted to throttle his aunt every time he looked out the window and saw the house-elf huddled miserably on the grass, he knew that he couldn’t.
Harry came blindingly hard, stiffening as pleasure spiked in his groin and burst out of him in a flood of heat, then crumpling over to lie against Draco’s trembling, panting, sweat-streaked body. Even as he breathed through his own orgasm, still gripped by its tremors, Harry felt the vibrating tension in the other man’s body, the plea in his soft whine at Harry’s touch, the heat and wetness of the cock trapped between them. Fastening his lips to the soft skin of Draco’s throat, Harry took his cock in hand and brought him to a swift, shuddering climax.
“What’re you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at the prison?”
Draco lifted his head, fighting his bonds as he struggled to sit up. Ron could only guess what it cost him to move at all, given the surgery he had just witnessed, but Draco seemed not to notice the pain in his body, so intent was he on finding his child.
"Boy, Harry, I wouldn't have your life on a bet."
“What are you baking that smells so good?”
Mrs. Weasley began loading up yet another plate, casting dubious glances over her shoulder at her son as she did so. “I thought you went down to the village to get a haircut.”
“Merlin, you’re sexy when you’re on a crusade!” Harry growled, shoving Draco unceremoniously up against the wall of the basement hallway and stooping to bite at his throat. “I’ve missed it…” Another bite that sent shivers running down Draco’s spine, then he added, “All that gorgeous self-righteousness…”
“You’re a Prefect, you git.”
Draco bounded out of his chair, smiling in anticipation.
Over the days, he quietly unlocked the floo, reset the wards and banished the spells that hid the cottage from passersby. He said nothing to Draco about these changes, but he also let him wander free about the house, telling himself that he wouldn’t stop the other man if he stumbled across an open door or working floo.
She looked as if her face might actually catch fire, and Harry knew a moment of petty triumph. It always felt good to get under Narcissa’s skin, even when he wasn’t angry enough to blast her out of her Italian leather shoes.
"I don't. I don't give a flaming, bloody damn what a bunch of half-wit half-wizards call me."
“Let me help you with Sunday dinner?” he pleaded. “I can make a batch of double-chocolate walnut fudge!”
They looked blankly at him, so he added helpfully, “Something that makes me… vulnerable.”
Snape moved quickly among the students, McGonagall following behind him with a large tray in her hands. It took him only a moment to swipe a piece of gauze over a student's fingertip, pierce it with the tip of a sharp knife, and let a few drops of blood fall into a stone bowl he took from the tray. Harry couldn't see what happened to the blood in the bowl, but he saw the frown on Snape's face and the concern in McGonagall's grow with each try.
“So… probably a wandless spell, very powerful but very precise, and they left no traces of their presence in the house.”
“I should’ve resisted it. Harry would’ve. You would’ve. But I was too stupid to see the trap in time and too weak to resist the Curse. That’s why they chose me.”
“Proceed, Mrs. Malfoy.”
“Just do it.”
“If he was, one of my colleagues will find out. But as I said, I don’t believe Harry would have willingly let you out of his sight, which means he wasn’t lounging about the club, picking up Malfoy Substitutes. He was gone.”
“Trust me, it’ll help.”
“Look, Daddy!” He waved a handful of plush fur in Harry’s direction. “Look what I found!”
“I don’t know. Arrest me again?” She lifted a sceptical eyebrow and reached for the teapot. “I doubt it would come to that, and Lissy cannot be punished for going where she likes. She is, after all, a free elf.”
He’d hoped to spend this morning alone in the castle, in the Room of Hidden Things, studying the cabinet and thinking of ways to fix it. Just thinking. Not actually
Draco snorted and rolled his eyes, a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. Ginny always made him smile, even when she insisted on calling him Malfoy and said deliberately provocative things. He was glad that if anyone had to waylay him today, it was her.
“Oh, for Fuck’s sake!” Draco groaned, dragging a pillow over his head and crushing it down to block out the sight of Harry’s grin.
"How is Malfoy?"
"Have you filled in your classmates yet, Mr. Potter?"
“I’m not ly—”
Harry obediently climbed to his feet, mumbled a goodnight to the Headmaster, and followed McGonagall out of the room. She didn't say anything, and Harry found her silence comforting. He couldn't talk about Sirius or Draco, and he didn't want to discuss his own behavior. Thankfully, McGonagall seemed to think he'd been chastised and guilt-tripped enough for one night. She walked him through the castle and up to the Fat Lady's portrait without uttering one word of reprimand.
Draco lay curled into Harry’s side, head on his shoulder, wrapped in his arms. His posture was sated, trusting, but he wasn’t drifting toward sleep as he should be. He was very much awake. Coiled. Tense.
He never could say no to Harry Fucking Potter. Never wanted to say no. So, of course, he had to obey…
He gestured grandly toward Dumbledore, his voice growing in volume as he gained confidence in his own oratory. “Then we are told that this Malfoy boy—this scion of a pureblood house, known to dabble in the Dark Arts, seen to support the Dark Lord at every turn—has born a child, an
Fudge's face hardened, his weak, pudgy features turning the closest thing to haughty that they could manage. "This is not about your schoolboy romances, Potter."
“Because the days when Cornelius Fudge could ask for my help are long gone. You know better than anyone how strained our relationship has become. And why.”
” Draco started toward him, forgetting for the moment that he was unarmed, pregnant, and robbed of his magic. His hands came up, fingers crooked into claws, and his lips drew back in a snarl of rage. “You filthy, fucking
“Ah. Right.” Harry ran a hand through his hair and looked away, a flush rising in his cheeks. “About that.”
Draco nodded and pushed himself off the sink. Before he could move, Ginny stepped up to Harry, planted a kiss on his cheek, then brushed past him on her way out.
“Well, I do. I know Harry better than anyone, and I know exactly what he would have done, if he’d been given the chance.”
“I’m not hiding,” Draco said before his brain could catch up with his tongue, “this is my bedroom. I live here.”
“They were angry.” His voice had dropped to an empty whisper. “They wanted me to fight back, but I was…”
“You don’t
Blowing on the ink to dry it and shoving the parchment into an envelope, he wrote Robards’ title and
"How far have you let this go, Harry?" Hermione asked, disrupting his thoughts. He gaped at her, his face heating with embarrassment, while she went on, remorselessly, "You think you're in love with him because of the link, but it can't be real. When he's well enough, Dumbledore will break the link, and you'll go back to hating each other. How are you going to feel, then, if you've..."
"I am not speaking of your students, but of
“I want to see,” Draco whispered.
Touch all of me.
Shaking his head in disbelief, Harry returned the book to the box and pulled out a folded sheaf of papers. It had been pressed against the side of the box, undisturbed, for long enough that the pages did not want to open. Harry had to force them flat. Then he riffled through the stack, revealing photographs, newspaper articles, and even a letter in his own messy scrawl.
“How? How can you be sure? He’s lived in this house all his life and could get it do things for him that it wouldn’t for a stranger, including hide him from Aurors!”
“Happy Christmas, Dragon.”
No voice came to him out of the darkness.
Once Draco got the pattern of striking the snitch with his palm and locking it in place with his fingers, he'd have no trouble. The problem was in training his brain, limbs and digits to do it without thinking. And in the meantime, his frustration mounted with every practice.
“It’s a long story.” Harry dropped the arm that held Draco and moved up to the enormous, swimming pool-sized bath. “A very long story that’ll keep for another time.” He scratched his head in consternation, eyeing the vast array of taps. “What sort of bubbles would you like?”
“Just stop blaming my mother,” Draco snapped.
“I need to talk to you about Draco.”
"What is it?" he asked, his voice high with panic.
They ate in companionable silence, broken only when Harry got up to fetch a bowl of porridge for Draco, and the other man murmured his thanks. They were done and working on another cup of tea when Draco finally spoke.
“No.” Robards waved him away. “Go on, get out.”
“Pay for sex?” Croaker said baldly. “That is why one goes to a brothel, isn’t it?”
"I know that." The anger drained out of him as swiftly as it had come, and he drooped under her hurt gaze. "I'm sorry."
"You." She stared very hard at Malfoy's face as she spoke and saw no flicker of triumph or gloating in it, only surprise and, just maybe, a twinge of pain. "He's so torn up with guilt over what he did to your hand that he just assumes you hate him for it."
It was an incredibly enflaming sight—all that lean strength and perfect porcelain beauty impaled on his cock, arching back in ecstasy, completely at his mercy and relishing every second of it. That image alone would have been enough to bring him to climax. But add to that the erotic scent that rolled off of Draco in waves and the ragged, animal noises he made every time Harry drove into him, and Harry was a goner.
Draco turned his gleaming, perfectly groomed head toward Harry and lifted one eyebrow. "Am I sprouting antennae?"
“Oh, it’s
more disinterested?"
Harry had reheated the bathwater for the fourth time and was feeling a bit like an over-stewed prune, when he realized that not only had Draco stopped crying, he had fallen asleep. The other man lay limply against him, head on his shoulder, face buried in his soggy t-shirt, hair snarled about his face and drifting in the cloudy water. His ribcage rose and fell gently, steadily, beneath Harry’s arms, while his breath tickled Harry’s throat. It was the most quiet and peaceful that Harry had seen him since his return from Azkaban. As if he had finally found a place without nightmares.
“Of course I do.” Her voice was just a little too high, a little too shrill, telling Harry that she was nervous and trying to hide it. “I’ve seen magical scans before…”
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled more brightly than ever. "I have a lot of friends that Cornelius Fudge knows nothing about. Trust me, Harry. I have everything well in hand, including Draco's welfare."
Draco didn’t need much prep—didn’t want it—just a touch of lube. Harry conjured it with a thought and worked his fingers between Draco’s cheeks to tease his hole. Draco groaned and sagged forward, hips pushing back.
terribly
Her face twisted with worry. “When I saw him on the train at the beginning of term, thought… well, the truth is, I thought he’d finally done it. Gotten the Dark Mark. I was so relieved when…”
Draco sighed his thanks and let his eyes drift closed. “Sorry… Know you wanted to talk.”
“He’ll have to get in line! I have the entire Wizarding world looking to me for safety, stability and healing. I have too few people to do far too many jobs, dangerous war criminals still on the loose, and more of them crowding our prisons than I can possibly handle. People are angry, frightened, grieving. They don’t want to hear about one seventeen-year-old boy who might or might not have been a Death Eater, but who’s no threat to them anyway because he’s fallen off the face of the Earth. They want to hear about the fugitives I’ve arrested and the murderers I’ve sent to Azkaban. About the missing loved ones I’ve found, the families I’ve reunited, the buildings I’ve restored to their former glory. And that’s only a week into our fragile, new peace! Just wait until it’s been a month, or a year, and Hogwarts still has holes in the walls or Rodolphus Lestrange is still out there killing people!
"Not to worry, dear. I'm sure it did Fred a deal of good."
“A lot of things have changed.”
"I always know what you're thinking. I don't need a link for that."
It was Draco’s turn to think, and he took his time about it. Ginny waited patiently, not pushing, and finally Draco nodded. She broke out in a beaming smile.
Draco's eyes opened again and fixed thoughtfully on Harry's face. Something inside of him had unclenched, a door opened, a wall dropped. And for the moment, his eyes were completely clear. "Of course I do."
“Just
Harry instinctively pulled Draco’s hand closer and bent to press a kiss to his knuckles. The power flowing out of him into the other boy was much stronger than usual, and the strands that twisted about their bodies were not gold or silver, not even the two colors woven together as he had seen so often before, but a unique and beautiful color all their own.
him do?!”
“Find Arthur Weasley. Say, ‘Draco isn’t feeling well, so I’m taking him home. Thank you for your hospitality and Happy Christmas’.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s not that easy, Dragon. You haven’t said a word about… about Azkaban, haven’t even asked how we got you out. It’s like you’ve been pretending that it wasn’t real.”
I'm sorry this took so long. I got distracted, and when I came back, the boys refused to play nice. They kept going all angsty on me.
, but he won't forget
“What’re you doing in here, Papa?”
Her eyes strayed toward a knot of Slytherins gathered around a brazier nearby. If the Headmaster wanted to find possible sources of trouble, he would do well to start with them. She would be willing to bet her allowance for the term that they were hatching some nasty plot to lead the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Or at the very least, to poison the Pepper-up Potion and put everyone in the hospital wing. It was a good thing that Malfoy was out of commission...
But not today.
"Yes, Professor."
"Hallo, Harry. Malfoy."
“No.”
Harry laughed. “You sound more like a Potter every day!”
Draco, looking from one to the other as if watching an Dueling demonstration, blurted out, “
“He believes that you bought him for your own pleasure,” she went on relentlessly, ignoring his protest. “He believes he has no right to deny you and no say in what happens to him. If you want him to trust you again, to
He got to his feet. Harry caught at the hem of his sweatshirt, rolling onto his side and pushing himself up on one elbow.
“What are you going to do?” he whispered.
“Did you do that to him?” he hissed, as he jerked the fabric down off the man’s arms. “Did you beat him half to death and rape him and leave him tied to the bars by his own fucking
She worked quietly for another few minutes, then she touched Draco’s shoulder and said, “Lissy is finished. You is having your supper now.”
Tear-bright, furious eyes lifted to Snape’s face, pinning him with a power he had not suspected in the haunted, fragile-seeming boy. A snarl contorted his lips, and his spine stiffened until he suddenly looked far too much like Lucius Malfoy.
The cabinet hummed with power. Draco could see it, like a bright afterimage around the edges of the doors, and feel it in the fine bones of his head. It made him faintly dizzy.
“Then you’d have to wank yourself raw, thinking of me. Of course, you’d probably do that either way…”
“I’ve just been to interview the suspect, and there’s no question. We’ve got our Thief.”
“Is he dying?” Harry rasped out. “Is that why you’re throwing me out? Draco’s dying and you don’t want me to watch?”
Harry scowled mulishly at her. “But you make things bigger on the inside than they are on the outside all the time. Only, look at your bag. You can fit everything you own in it, but it’s still small enough to shove in your sock.”
Madam Fox chuckled. "It's the Malfoy in him. I always said that Lucius was more viper than human being."
Molly gave her a severe look. “They were maroon, because that’s the yarn I had on hand.”
“Do it. Fuck me, Harry
"A puffer fish. One of those, funny-looking, flat fish that blows itself up like a porcupine when anything gets too close to it."
Draco nodded and rose to his feet.
Back in the Slytherin dormitory, Draco swapped his Quidditch gear for his most casual clothes and settled in for the rest of the afternoon to do his homework. He felt calm, satisfied—with his victory on the pitch and his fun in the shower—with no regrets. In fact, his body felt relaxed and content in a way he never remembered it being.
"You have a visitor, Albus."
Dumbledore was looking around at the cage that held him and the flow of power from the unconscious students. He touched one hand against the scintillating barrier, then drew quickly back.
Somehow, he had to get Draco over here to visit them. Soon.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” Harry murmured into his hair. “I did everything in my power to prevent this from happening. I had them sign a Magical contract that gave me the power to destroy their Commission, to throw them all in prison, if they leaked a word of what they knew. I made them agree to destroy the memories after they closed the case. I put so much power into that contract that they were terrified to sign it! I saw it in their faces! But it wasn’t enough.”
Marchbanks cleared her throat (probably to stop herself from laughing) and said in an aside to Shacklebolt, “Do you have any questions on this point, Minister?”
“What?”
“No? You’ve done it before. Remember Hogwarts? Behind Hagrid’s cabin?”
“Y’know that table over there?” Draco asked.
“Bloody hell, Potter,” he gasped, “what is it with you and walls?”
“Explain.”
” both Aurors chorused at once.
“I wouldn’t have pushed in on you like this, but you haven’t been to the Burrow in more than a week.”
"Name it.”
Draco looked away, his eyes suddenly hot with tears. He was about to humiliate himself, but he could see no avenue of escape. He was trapped in this chair, under Molly Weasley’s gaze, on the verge of bawling his eyes out over a grudging compliment.
"Indeed." The smile widened into a leer. "It's Narcissa Malfoy."
He drew in a sobbing breath and fairly howled, “
“You’ll thank me when it’s done. Bloody hell!”
“Hush, now, my dears. Your father’s sleeping.”
Draco sighed and closed his eyes. He felt both infinitely at peace and utterly despairing at the same time. Harry’s closeness, his warmth, his palpable love were all that Draco had ever dreamed they could be. Lying this close to him and listening to the rumble of his voice through his ribcage was bliss. These minutes were a gift beyond price that he would carry in his heart to the end of his days. But they were fleeting. A mirage. A moment that would vanish like vapor on the wind, leaving Draco as a ghost once more.
“Go on, take it. See what happens.”
“Mother,” he said, matching her cool tone to perfection. “Father. Lovely morning to spend in a dungeon, isn’t it?”
Pain and elation flooded him, making the breath sob in his throat. He sagged forward, his head pressing into the hollow of Snape’s shoulder and his shoulders shaking with dry sobs, while bloody tears coursed down his cheeks. Lily was safe! Lily was
“Harry gets no vote?”
Once he realized that the fragile-seeming waif he had saved from starvation was tougher than he looked, Nero had put him through his paces. He’d taken Draco on his back, on his belly, on all-fours in the middle of the carpet, up against the wall and bent over a chair. He’d dressed him up, played out little scenes with him, introduced him to various toys and kinks, and even brought one of the female whores into his bed. That had failed spectacularly, but Nero was too practical a businessman to repine and had simply adjusted his mental calculations to keep women out of the equation.
“Draco?” Harry whispered, before lacing his fingers through Draco’s and dropping another kiss on his tummy. “Did I do okay?” He swallowed the lump in his throat to add, “You’re not mad?”
"I…" He looked from Dumbledore to Harry and back again, his mouth open and his breathing unnaturally fast.
Instead, Lucius tightened his grip on his son and said, fiercely, “This isn’t about what I want, you fool! It’s about our future. Our
They apparated straight to the island, the warrant with its magical seal opening the wards for them and allowing them to pass through the heavy iron portcullis that blocked the main entrance as if it were smoke. Harry was so buoyed up by excitement that he didn’t feel the cold wind off the North Sea cutting through his Weasley jumper or the harsh rock of the island digging into his trainers. He simply ran for the fortress. By the time he reached the guard post, he was moving so fast that Ron, even with his longer legs, could hardly keep pace with him.
“Yes, then what?”
"I looked all over Diagon Alley for just the right present and finally raided Fred and George's shop. I figured that Harry could use a laugh, in between rescue missions and battles to the death." Hefting the bulging package, he added, with a grin, "There's enough contraband in here to keep Filch howling for a month or get Harry expelled."
All those men in Azkaban. All those Death Eaters fucking him into the bars. They’d left a wound that Harry suspected would never fully heal. On his worst days, he could barely tolerate a hand on his shoulder. And only Harry, whom he trusted implicitly, could actually put an arm around him.
Harry nodded, grinned sheepishly, and resumed eating.
All talk in the kitchen broke off at their entrance. Mrs. Weasley stood at the stove with her wand in one hand and a toasting fork in the other. Several pans of food—bacon, eggs, sausages and a huge pot of porridge—sizzled and snapped on the stovetop, filling the room with enticing smells. Immediately to Harry’s right, on a table against the wall, stood a cradle, and both of the twins were bent over it with foolish expressions on their faces. But the instant they caught sight of Harry and Draco, they snapped upright, their faces going blank, and sidled over to the table.
Narcissa also rose. She drew herself up to her full, regal height, and pulled her icy composure around her like a cloak. "I will not leave without Draco."
Warwick gave him that infuriating smirk again. “I’m gonna call you
“No, and you should be glad he isn’t,” Bill said, firmly.
Harry took another stab at the defenseless meat on his plate and said, with suppressed savagery, "People grow up! Even
“If no one else c’n do it, what’s the good’ve studying it?”
Merlin’s saggy tits! He could have seen you fucking me up against the walls!”
When Draco just looked at him, eyes too large in his pale face, Harry gave him a slight shake. “Right?”
"He killed two people." Harry's quiet words brought silence in their wake, while the two boys stared at each other and the din of the party flowed around them, intruding on their notice. They both heard Lavender squeal with laughter and Hermione request, acidly, that she spare their eardrums. Harry dropped his voice, forcing Ron to lean in closer to hear, and said, "He used the Avada Kedavra Curse. That's why they took him away and put him on trial."
“You wouldn’t do just as well with young Brant, there? He’s a pretty thing and quite available.”
“Do you think that’s a good idea?” Granger fretted.
"She's the head of the Spell Damage ward."
“It could be anyone’s baby.”
Harry leaned close but, true to his word, did not touch him. The other boy's breath was warm on Draco's face when he whispered, "I love you so much that sometimes I think I'll go mad from it."
“No! I’m going to…” Ron began, only to be silenced by Snape.
Granger obediently settled the little bundle of flannel and fluffy yellow ducklings in a wooden cradle that stood by the wall. Then she held out her hands to Bob.
There was a sudden rush of warmth through Harry's body, followed by a terrible chill and a sense of urgency that was painful in its intensity. Harry gasped, and his eyes flew open. He saw Dumbledore bending over him, frowning in concentration.
” Draco snarled. “And before long, the whole
When they each held a flask, Harry lifted his in a salute and murmured, “Cheers, love.”
"Hm."
"Is it cold-blooded to save a sixteen-year-old boy from Voldemort's clutches?"
"Is he rational?" Dumbledore asked.
Even his hair looked better these days—smoother, softer, brighter—as if his cautious happiness had infused it with new life. Or maybe it was his profligate use of magic that was changing him, filling out his face, melting the ice in his eyes, and polishing his hair ’til it gleamed like liquid light. Wizards were meant to use magic, after all, not to crush it down and let it die. And Draco Potter was a wizard.
"Slept on it," he retorted, his face flushing.
“Arthur.”
“Why? I’m no danger to him now.”
“I don’t doubt it. Tell me, is it ever legal to arrest a suspect without a warrant?”
“I swear.”
Beside him, Neville was working himself up into a froth. “If you’re right, shouldn’t we have heard something by now? It’s been hours, already! It’s not like Harry to just disappear!”
"She went straight to the Atrium and flooed out," Moody informed him, swiveling his magic eye just in case anyone wondered how he'd managed to track Narcissa's movements from inside the dungeon.
“Hey,” Harry said softly, his smile widening. “Welcome back.”
“Right the first time. What did your mother want?”
Harry chuckled. “Neither of us.”
Harry.
“Bloody fucking hell…”
“You don’t have to do this.”
Harry looked at the stretch of empty air from which that voice issued and grinned. “Why? It’s not like I can see you with that ruddy cloak on, anyway.”
“Let’s just rest for a bit. Please. For me, if not for you.”
"Neither can I." He looked squarely into Sirius' frowning eyes. "And no offence, Sirius, but I'll choose Draco every time."
“Trust me.” Harry shuffled into position between his legs, one hand caressing the upturned curve of his arse. “You’ll feel better soon.”
Draco had to tilt his chin up to look in his face and immediately wished he’d stayed farther back. Too late, now. He’d have to brazen it out and ignore the way the man was stripping him with his eyes.
“Yes, Professor.”
One silver-blond brow rose elegantly. “Prostitution.”
“Honestly, Harry,” Hermione cut in, “do you
“Of course not. You’re the most beautiful, fabulous, fuckable man on the planet. But that doesn’t mean you couldn’t look even better, which you would with a little Potter inside you.”
Draco quietly set his cup on the table. He got to his feet and took a step closer to Harry.
Dumbledore waited a moment for her words to sink into Harry's mind, then he pushed back his chair with a loud scrape and rose to his feet. "Let's get started on that potion, then, shall we?"
"Hmph. Why would he do that?"
“I did what any Malfoy would,” Draco said quietly, his gaze steady on Harry’s. “I considered all my options, all possible outcomes, and chose the course of action with the best chance for success. That’s all.”
Somehow, I always end up putting a trial scene in every fic I write, even the funny ones. I keep telling myself that I won’t, that I don’t like writing them and am rarely satisfied with the result, but they always seem to be necessary. So I could say that this is the last trial scene I’m ever going to write, but I’d probably be lying.
"This is the most delicate part of the linking, and it depends on you, Harry," Dumbledore said. "Are you ready?"
“That he once glued Ron Weasley to a wall.”
“Me! You’re the one who’d have to admit to a Muggle-born Gryffindor witch that you got buggered within an inch of your life.”
” He gave the other boy a little shake and threw all his persuasive power into his voice. “Your father didn’t ask you if you wanted him to sell your body, he just
“Have some breakfast before you go,” Hermione urged.
Draco uttered something between a laugh and a sob, and pulled his son into his arms. “You want to go, don’t you?”
“No, I’m seducing you. Shut up and enjoy it.”
"Tell me."
“Where are his ducklings?! He needs his ducklings! What have done with them?! I can’t believe you would…”
He sighed, rubbed at his face again, and started to fold the map. Then his eyes fell on a moving dot and the tiny label floating just beside it. Draco Malfoy. Walking along a third-floor corridor, where he had absolutely no business being.
Dumbledore said nothing, and as they boarded the train for central London, Harry felt depression thicken like a dank cloud about him. He found a place to stand in the crowded train and stared at the plastic cherries bobbing in the hat of a middle-aged Muggle seated nearby. The ride felt endless, and the close proximity of all those Muggles made it impossible for Harry to kill the time by talking to Dumbledore about the trial or Draco. What would the lady with the cherries in her hat think, if she heard him discussing the Minister of Magic or Unforgivable Curses with the portly baker beside him?
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Ron grabbed his arm and dragged him unceremoniously into their office, muttering, “He’s a prick. Ignore him.”
Harry still sat, gazing down at him curiously. “Why’d you go there?”
Draco shivered. “I wanted it so much. But I wanted to touch you, look at you, c- call your name when I…” Sobs shook him, muffling his words and prompting Harry to begin petting his hair.
, he tried to say. Nothing came out. His lips wouldn’t move.
“Too alliterative.”
“It is, or you would help me get free of the Ministry and keep my home.”
He could still remember how he'd felt, coming back from the Christmas holidays and realizing, at a glance, that Harry had done the unthinkable - and with Malfoy, of all god-awful people. It still made Ron shudder. Not so much because Malfoy was a boy, though that was seriously weird in its own way, but because he was
Warwick and MacMillan were waiting for him in the interrogation room. Warwick had a sandwich and a paper cup full of tea in front of him, and he made a show of licking the salad cream from his lips as the guards hustled his prisoner over to the table. Draco dropped clumsily onto his stool, unstrung by pain and too lightheaded to control his descent. His stomach clenched agonizingly at the smell of food so close to him. The familiar, seductive scent of brewing tea. His eyes began to water, and he closed them against the threatened tears.
For a beat, no one spoke or moved. Then Narcissa drew close to Harry and murmured, “Shacklebolt? Are you sure?”
“No one will care,” Draco said, brushing away her words with a wave of his glass. “Six Potters before you have had broomsticks their first year at Hogwarts—seven, if you count Harry—and six of them have made the Quidditch team in their first term.”
Ron watched him from his seat behind the desk, now chewing contemplatively on the end of his quill and leaving bits of feather on his lips.
Harry risked one glance at the dreadful chair in the center of the floor, just to assure himself that Draco was not seated in it, then he resolutely turned his eyes to the benches above and the veritable army of wizards and witches crowded onto them. He could not see their faces, except in the very lowest bench, where Fudge and his lackeys sat, but he could tell that there were far more than fifty people up there. The Wizengamot sat in the middle, ranged behind Fudge, Madam Bones, Dolores Umbridge, Percy Weasley, and – Harry's stomach clenched afresh at the sight of her – Narcissa Malfoy. Kingsley Shacklebolt and two women Harry had never seen before also sat on the front bench, but with a careful distance between them and Fudge's contingent.
"Only a pint or two, but this may not be the end of it. Choose carefully, Severus. Very carefully."
Always.
“I’m frightened,” Bob admitted, his words coming out in a soundless whisper. “Every time you get pregnant, I’m so frightened…”
Harry had to be content with that. They had arrived at the door to the dungeon, and a guard held it open for them.
Harry grimaced, his expression saying,
“I don’t.”
“Just let her tell it, or we’ll be here all week,” Weasel sighed from his invisible place behind the piled books.
“You wouldn’t have believed me.”
"Perish the thought."
Draco pretended to give this due consideration, though there was really nothing to consider. He had known from the start precisely where this was headed. It was his sole purpose in coming here and his reason for sending the other Aurors from the room. It was also the one thing Harry most emphatically did not want him to do, but Harry wasn’t here. And anyway, the noble, heroic, idiotic git didn’t know what was good for him.
"Why would Draco attack you, Harry?" Dumbledore asked. "And why with a Patronus?"
“Huh?” Ron looked baffled at that. “How?”
“Didn’t it?” Draco shot back. “Look at what my parents did to me because of that fucking inheritance! If I leave the possibility open, as you put it, then Bob becomes the next Malfoy heir, the next target for their obsession and manipulation. And what happens if he’s bent like his father? Or he falls in love with a Muggle? Or he decides he’d rather train dragons and climb mountains than produce children? What will they do to
It seemed, to Harry's overstretched nerves, to take an age to set the locks and wards on the tower room. By the time Dumbledore drew him up to the desk and motioned for him to bend over the Pensieve, he was sweating with fear and almost dancing with impatience. Distractedly, as Dumbledore swirled the Pensieve between his hands, Harry wondered if this was how Snape felt and how, if it was, he could bear to just sit here and wait.
With a heartfelt groan, Draco let his head drop forward onto his crossed arms. “Bloody hell! The bloody Weasleys!”
"I'd say so."
he forcibly reminded himself—and his adoptive family.
“We must be into September.”
“Let the boy enjoy himself, Nephew,” Andromeda chided, sidling into his path to stop him.
"Yes, like how to be an insufferable know-it-all."
than Pansy!"
“You can’t tell his parents,” Harry rasped out.
“After…” Potter started, then understanding dawned and the flames leapt up again. “After I fuck you.”
“No, you can’t. And Teddy can’t inherit because he was cut out of the Black family tree before he was ever born. Face it, Malfoy, you have only two options: let your son grow up as a Malfoy, with everything that entails, and leave him the combined Magical Inheritance upon your death; or cut him out of the succession and let the Magical Inheritance die with you.”
“He’ll t-take it…”
“Pounds. Have you really never seen Muggle money before?”
Dobby eyed her solemnly, all teasing gone from his manner, and he put out a hand to touch her knee. "Miss Iffy knows better than that. She knows that Master Draco and Harry Potter are always proud of her, whether she is Slytherin, Ravenclaw or even Hufflepuff."
Draco blinked. “Did you?”
“How about you make yourself beautiful for your meeting, while I start breakfast? I need to feed that fabulous, pregnant body of yours before it wastes away to nothing.” He gave Draco a squeeze and a kiss on the temple. “Yeah?”
"Good. Then they'll all see that he's perfectly fine and leave you alone!"
"But you aren't happy."
The import of her question slowly penetrated his brain and he shook his head.
” Harry began, only to be cut off by an all too familiar hail.
He had no formula, no bottles, no nappies and no fucking clue. His only option was to call for help.
Harry trusted him. That was the incredible magic of it. After all these years and all the damage Draco had done—to himself, to Harry, to the entire fucking wizarding world—Harry still trusted him enough to strip himself bare, let go, and lie helpless in Draco’s arms.
"You're as bad as any of them, Master Crookshanks. What cunning plot are you revolving in your feline brain?"
Draco hesitated for another moment, still holding tightly to Harry, then finally lifted his head. Wary grey eyes met frowning green ones. Harry caught his head, cradling his bruised face gently between his palms and brushing the thick, fading, silver scar that split his lip with a thumb.
Of course, Draco chose that moment to come sailing into the room, resplendent in drainpipe trousers, Mod boots, and tailored midnight blue robes that were perfectly pleated to hang over his enormous tummy. He looked simultaneously slender and huge (his back, shoulders and hips were still elegantly trim, while his stomach was roughly the size of a haystack), gorgeous and grumpy. His glossy purple lips were pulled down in a scowl. His eyes flashed from beneath blackened lashes and kohl-lined lids.
Narcissa pays a visit to Hogwarts. Dumbledore devises a plan to find out what happened to Draco.
“The dungeons,” Ron cut in, white-faced and horrified. “That’s what happened in the dungeons.”
"There shouldn't be too many people about," Harry commented, as he started for the main door. "Saturday afternoon everyone's probably studying."
“You spoke to him?” Rita looked like a snake that had just spotted a wounded mouse, her eyes shining with greed and triumph. “What did he say?”
Waving at the lighter cells on the left, Snape said, “Check those. I’ll take the other side.”
“Please, darling, tell me the truth. When you say that it could still go wrong, do you mean that you could…”
“Then give me some way to help.” Harry looked up sharply, his mouth falling open. “Bleeding hell, mate, you trust Kreacher to help Ferret, but you don’t trust
Someone, but not Harry, she decided. Not Harry. If Snape's test had shown that she was the best match for Malfoy's blood, she would have gone without a murmur and done whatever Dumbledore asked. But Harry had been through enough - more than enough - and he shouldn't be asked to risk his life or his sanity or whatever else they were planning to take from him for the likes of Draco Malfoy. It simply wasn't fair.
"You're ready to go? Excellent. I just have a few more things to pack…"
That wrecked, filthy sound was the last straw for Draco. Pleasure sparked along every nerve and erupted in his groin. His hips jerked, burying him still deeper in Harry’s body. His cock leapt, spurting, and he came so hard that it almost stopped his heart.
“I never looked like Snape,” Draco sniffed. “I never let my hair get that greasy.”
Ron stepped into the room, a cup of tea in his hand. “No answer, yet?”
“I have informed their families.” Dumbledore was around his desk, opening the door, revealing Professor Moody just coming up the spiral staircase to meet him. “The Minister is leaving, Alastor.”
“I beg your pardon, but I’m always civil! I’m the very
He had Draco back. Alive. Free. His. He would do whatever it took to keep him and to make him whole again. His job, the Ministry, the expectations of the wizarding world meant nothing to him anymore—not when Draco needed him so much.
“What was it, exactly, that Voldemort did to him?” Sirius asked. “Dumbledore’s being very tightlipped about it.”
Draco grimaced and pulled the knit cap from his pocket, but when he started to put it on, Granger caught his wrist.
Harry looked up to find his son standing at his knee, regarding him with wide, intent eyes. The boy clutched what appeared to be a Gobstone in one hand and was slimed from hairline to toes with purple goo. Harry’s robes now bore a sticky purple handprint, as well.
“Here, my Lord.”
“Where would you like it?”
"Nothing, I hope."
"Can we set up a bed, or beds, in your office?"
"A trophy?"
you have returned Miss Malfoy to her parents.”
“Are you going to sell this one to the goblins, Papa?” he asked in an awestruck whisper.
It felt like fingers down the spine or a cold breeze against naked, sweat-dampened flesh. He started and looked around for the source, seeing nothing but a swarm of flyers in Slytherin green and Ravenclaw blue intent on the match. No one was paying any attention to him, but the feeling did not pass. He still had the sensation that someone was watching him—really
* * *
” Harry demanded.
“What?” Draco asked, eyes slitting open, before he could check himself.
“You don’t.” At Ron’s scowling look, he sighed and said, “Trust me, you really don’t. Kreacher’s looking after him and that makes both of them happy, so let them be.”
"I'm not so sure about that. He's way beyond upset over losing the link with Malfoy. If this weren't Harry we were talking about, I'd say he was distraught."
“We did. No, I’m not looking for a house. I’m looking for a burial site.” Ron stared at him, too gobsmacked to respond. “A church or a crypt or a graveyard so old that it no longer belongs directly to the Malfoys, if it ever did. I want to know where the Malfoys buried their filthy imperialist pureblood bodies before they ever thought of invading England!”
“No!” Harry protested, turning reproachful eyes on the healer. “ It’s too soon! He’s too weak…”
They read on, not noticing the time or the way the shadows moved in the room, until Draco’s voice was so ragged that Harry couldn’t bear to listen to it any longer. He reached over to clasp Draco’s arm, cutting him off in mid-speech. Draco shot him a questioning glance. He looked faded and gaunt and weak, not at all like he should be educating someone in the intricacies of Shakespeare, and Harry instantly felt guilty for keeping him reading for so long.
Harry's head snapped up. "Professor Dumbledore!" Relief washed through him at the sight of the old wizard standing just inside the screen.
Harry shot him a wry look. “She doesn’t think anything of the sort. But something’s got her spooked.”
“I thought he would, after what we did to Malfoy.”
“Ron always was a very perceptive man.”
Harry just waved to them both, as he reached the stairs and bounded up them two at a time. Ernie MacMillan shouted something after him that he did not hear, and Nearly-Headless Nick asked where he was off to in such a hurry. A group of Ravenclaws, about to enter the Great Hall, hung back to watch his precipitous departure and smirked knowingly at each other. Harry pretended not to notice any of it, but he could not quite smother a sigh of relief as he turned a corner and moved out of sight of the students in the entry hall.
Back in his dungeon room, Draco quickly grabbed a towel and some clean clothes, then headed for the shower. The bathroom was blessedly empty, so he could stand under the hot spray and stroke himself in answer to the magic pulsing through him.
of accident?” Lavender demanded.
As he set the smaller boy down on the scarred, wooden surface, he smiled into his startled eyes and said, “This’ll do nicely.”
"I told you…" Harry began, but Draco cut him off.
“Well, at least she’s a
“I won’t go through it. I promise.”
“Hmm.” He kissed Harry lingeringly, then pulled back to say, “I hate to be a killjoy, but Bob is waiting and I still have to put my face on.”
“Let me see that.” Harry plucked the parchment from his hand and began to read.
I am, is that I let you imprint on me because you’re already perfect.”
“Right. Sorry.” Draco sat back and crossed his arms, lifting an eyebrow at Granger, inviting her to continue.
“What? What is it?”
“I checked the case file after the arrest.”
“Leave off, Hermione,” Ron advised. “Those two can bollock it up enough by themselves. They don’t need your help.”
“They way he talks about Malfoy should tell you everything you need to know!”
“Tell me what’s wrong.”
“And then?”
“Too right. No one but me is ever going to touch you again, so who gives a fuck what they think?”
Harry shook his head.
“Draco? Felix?”
"I dreamed of dying alone in the cold."
Malfoy! Right here, not two minutes ago, he had planted one on Draco and
” as he spurted over Potter’s fist.
Mr. Weasley spoke up, talking over his wife’s head. “Fred and George suffered some burns, but nothing serious. And Percy got knocked on the head.”
“I have to tell him we’re leaving.”
Harry settled himself back on the cushions and eyed his husband in concern. Draco still had not relaxed his posture. He looked as if he were about to pounce on Harry and tear his clothes off. But he didn’t look as though he even remotely fancied the idea.
He dropped his coat on the nearest chair and looked around. Not only was the room empty, but it was entirely too orderly. The books and tea cups were gone. Molly’s omnipresent knitting was tucked away in its bag beside her armchair. Draco’s bedding was folded and stacked at one end of the sofa, with a pad of blue and white flannel sitting neatly atop the pile.
“Thank you, Severus. Thank you all. My door is always open to you, and if I’m not here, you may speak to Minerva or Severus. They are my seconds in this.”
“All right, you two, that’s quite enough,” Granger sniffed. “I have work to do, so please see yourselves out. And don’t Confund my assistant on the way!” was her inevitable send-off.
There it was, folded neatly under Harry's pillow. Of course, Ron realized as he lifted the soft pad of silvery fabric, he should have looked here first. Harry always kept it under his pillow, ready to hand, so he could slip out to meet Malfoy any time the urge took him. Except today, when he had so much work to do and Malfoy was feeling so grumpy.
He made a grab for it, but Harry pulled it out of his reach, chiding, “Just hang on a minute!”
“Yeah.” Ron’s grin was wide enough to split his face in half, but his eyes burned with tears. “She’s home for good. Dumbledore saw to that.”
“No! Draco!” Harry wailed, even as Malfoy thrashed against the cold tile and uttered another hideous, wordless scream of agony. Harry grabbed his shoulders, tried to lift him, only to have the other boy twist out of his grasp and fall to the floor again.
“I remember.” Draco’s smile widened, and when the boy stroked his hands down his arms, he stepped closer. “But I’m not a Veela.”
Twenty seconds.
The voices rose in volume, and Draco caught a handful of words among the general racket. It was Madam Pomfrey, and she was in a royal snit. He didn't recognize the other voices, but he fancied one of them could be McGonagall.
Seamus snorted with laughter. “That’d be an improvement for Malfoy. He’s already half snake, anyway—the half that isn’t ferret.”
“She’s not a bad sort. Scary as fuck when she’s angry, but fair.”
Death Eaters. All of the Death Eaters who had attended the party, plus several others who must have arrived at the Manor in secret. His Aunt Bellatrix. Her husband Rodolphus and his brother Rabastan. Crabbe and Goyle. Mulciber. Yaxley. Dolohov, Rowle, MacNair… more Death Eaters than he had ever seen in one place before. And they were all staring at him. Waiting for him.
Harry gasped, as he caught sight of Draco's hand. Snape swore under his breath, and McGonagall uttered a startled cry. For the adamant hand – the beautiful, indestructible adamant hand – was missing two fingers. Of the two outer fingers only jagged stumps remained, shards of crystal like tiny knives protruding from the ends where the facets had broken, and the sharp ends were stained an ugly brownish red. Whatever had taken the fingers off had not done so neatly or easily.
Wormtail obeyed, fixing his gaze stoutly to his master's and repeating his assurance that no one at Hogwarts would sully his hands by touching the traitor Malfoy—no one but the besotted Harry Potter. It was clear to Ron from the expression on Voldemort's face that Wormtail was telling the truth, not that Ron needed Legilimency to tell him that Draco had not been shagging other boys. He knew, better than anyone, how utterly loyal Malfoy was to Harry and how completely faithful. If Voldemort could, in fact, conceive a child in Draco's body, that child would be Harry's. The only question was what Voldemort believed and what he would do to Malfoy now.
” Snape demanded, on his feet as well and glaring at Dumbledore in outrage. “What can a healer at St. Mungo’s have to say that’s more important than the lives of eleven students?”
“Azkaban’ll do that to you.”
“If we only knew who those parents might be,” Umbridge simpered.
Harry shrugged. “It’s what Draco wants, so I’m good with it. It’s not like we need the money. Or the magic.”
"Actually, I thought I'd try for Hufflepuff," Iffy said.
"Obviously, but why here? There are warmer places to make out..."
The girl fired him a blinding smile and called back, "I'm going up on the train! Isn't that
“Stupid sodding Gryffindor,” Draco murmured lovingly.
I don’t fucking believe this!” Draco groaned, dragging his hands down his face in a vain attempt to erase from his brain the images Hermione’s words had conjured.
Granger burst into the room a moment later, eyes bright and face aglow. Her smile could have lit the catacombs beneath Gringotts. She swept them all with a triumphant gaze and held up a book approximately the size and weight of a tombstone.
"Going to Azkaban for the rest of your life isn't the worst part!"
Mrs. Weasley pressed her lips tightly together and made a sour noise in her throat.
His feet barely touched the marble floors as he tore up the stairs and sped down long, echoing, empty hallways. He was panting, as much with eagerness as exertion, when he saw the round bulk of a tower ahead, a small door set in the curved wall. He lengthened his stride until he was running full tilt. Then, without warning, another figure appeared just in front of the door. Joy flooded him. He gave a shout of relief and threw himself bodily into the other boy’s arms.
“Do you plan to use the herbology room for plant starts? If so, I would be happy to assist with that.”
Baby bats. They’re cute enough.
“Yes. Very much! And Hugo’s almost got my computer ready. The phone is ready too.”
I like the idea. Good job.
“This little kitchen we’ll expand. Tall cherry cabinetry, a simple unadorned frame with glass inserts like what is in Harry’s kitchen downstairs. We’re creating a theme replicating the glass. A neutral grey quartz for the countertops. We put in a stovetop here with a wall oven and refrigerator there. We won’t need much more than that up here, right? And we’ll have the proper dumbwaiter put in there with a direct link to Harry’s main kitchen. Yes?
“You know there’s a school that can teach you how to use it.”
“We might make a stop at another shop or two on the way. There’s the craft shop and maybe Gladrags? I’ll have them home in time for dinner!”
Oh. Okay. Don’t want to bother her though?

It’s not all just furniture. You know you’re going to take more than just your office and you will fuss and bother yourself over all of it. I mean, I understand that you’re sentimental about these things. It’s hard to let go.
Have you talked with them about it?
“You’re fucking kidding me.”
“He’s blushing! Stop!”
Dra. . . .
Hope you're having a great weekend.

Well . . . .digging a little deeper into this volume.
“I’ll be back.”
“It means, that since I’ve arrived and confirmed my suspicions, that this transfer is going to be much easier than my Grandfather had anticipated. I know who you are, Mr. Potter.”
Not a lot. Checking up on things. There’s a PILE of mail to go through.
“She was a girl smitten with your blonde. Could you blame her?”
But not for Teddy. Since we’ve been married even “your father” isn’t okay? And now it’s going to get more odd with grandchildren. Even in the chat he said something like “Your Fathers are idiots” when talking about Dad and Draco.
So does Scotland sound like something that might solve your issue?
“That was Rose’s idea.”
LOLOLOLOL
——————————————————————————
It’s my fault. I should have paid more attention.
“Hugo, can we go up on your roof? I want to see what the place looks like from over here.”
“YES! I’m READY!”
“I do love it, Harry. The roof is beautiful. Thank you.”
—————————————————————————
Staff Meeting and once again Zebb is in charge.
Dad? What’s so urgent?
Al = Panda
“Okay, let’s close this place up and head to the Leaky.”
“Probably. We need to eat. Yes let’s head down.”
You drive a hard bargain young man, 0.005%, but that’s our FINAL OFFER.
“Yeah, that’s new.”
“You’re probably right.”
——————————————————————————
“Okay.”
“Were you safe?”
“Wow.”
Agreed.
“Shite MUM!”
Definitely. I can contact Jerry and get it in the works.
That might be a problem.
. . . . . . . . . .
London
I, Draco L. Malfoy-Potter, hereby grant permission for Harry J. Malfoy-Potter to receive driving lessons from Grayson Taylor Mason for his new Twizy!
“Please do!”
Go ahead. Just for fun, but make it quick because I really am craving ice cream.
Davey hasn’t left Teddy since we walked in the door. It’s like he’s determined to never let go.
“It’s a conservatory. More like another room extension. A massive, fancy room made out of glass. I mean look at that roof.”
“Of course not. Come on. . . . . . . . . . “
It’s too perfect. It’s like Uncle Harry had it tailored for me. I just don’t get it!
Not yet.
Yeah! And I think there’s a closet full of Muggle movies? Big round metal tins.
“I wouldn’t.”
Sure!
I am? Okay!
“I, Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter, Lord of Prince, hereby announce my revocation of the Malfoy Lordship. It is my wish, and the wish of my Family that the Lordship be transferred to Professor Kreacher of Hogwarts School and resident of Hogsmeade, Scotland. I further wish that the Wizengamot seats be assigned equally, Three seats to Professor Kreacher of Hogwarts, and the remaining three seats to Miss Zebb, resident of Malfoy-Potter Estate in Kensington.”
“Let’s leave them there for now. I’ll figure something out temporarily.“
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can never really go wrong with white on white for a bath but the details are stunning.”
“Stone bench?”
IT’S THE DUD’S KID! YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW AWESOME THIS IS!
“Definitely.”
I’m an idiot.
POTTER.MALFOY.LUPIN.WEASLEY.KIDS.PRIVATE.CHAT
“I keep that underneath the cart here. . . . .”
“Just sounds nice.”
You’ve thought about this.
Someone to write it up with your cooperation so it's not all just speculation based on the filing. Can’t be Rose because she’s one of your Wizengamot designees.
——————————————————————————
“Yes. Being the Grandmother has advantages.”
“Do I need to use a sobering charm on either of you yet? Mother?”
“He looks exactly like you with long hair and no glasses!”
“Now we’re just in the middle of nature overlooking the cliffs of Wales.”
“Yes. More than ever.”
“Hermione can help us with the legal stuff with Judy if it comes to that. I’ll contact her. I’ll also contact the school headmistress if that’s okay with you?”
Potter Cottage(Fidelius)
“Yep.”
“I feel it too. Good day to relax then. We can consider it a magic replenishment day.”
“It looks to me like they had parties. The decor is so different though. Very unusual. It’s not overly huge though so I’d say smaller crowds.”
Yeah but he’s also more of an introvert than you.
It’s not a bad thing. Our meeting this morning was a frenzy and then when we got home it was just a flurry of owls between Mione, Rose and Pansy. That Goblin guy too, but that’s just ministry stuff.
“I’m Harry Potter, well, Malfoy-Potter . . .but I’m oblivious and a complete dunderhead. Are you going to join me in the big roof bath overlooking the city with the pretty view? Are we going to share dessert?”
Bears are not native to Iceland. No snakes either. Warning though: If it's not a rotting cabin and livable you’re going to have to staff it once you open it up. It’s going to need maintenance and repairs.
“Yes!”
Surprise? We started brewing weeks ago? Al may actually be expecting before the wedding?
“It was funny.”
We have done much the same with the writing staff. Most notably, Rita and Keeta Skeeter will not be returning. Unfortunately, both had to be removed from the premises this morning by Ministry officials (see our photo story on page 3!). Others may return based on the merit of their reporting, a legal agreement and signing a binding code of conduct. All personnel and positions are under review. We believe many of the writing staff will return to their posts with the added assurance that they aren’t pressured to provide tabloid style details or biased political reporting.
No! I just wanted permission to tell you about his vault.
“Oh shite. Draco what the fuck! Look at this.”
Not a bad idea. At least a couple of people a little younger to bounce questions off of.
There’s no test here. You will not be graded.
Cool!
He likes the owlery. He’s got friends up there. He can snuggle with the one Harry named Elaine. Trust me on this.
“My Granddaughter, Aspen. . . . yeah I’m sorry if I forgot? I can get a little scattered at times. . . . . Wolf & Badger. . . . . wait . . . . that’s where we got my favourite pea coat! Just by Kings Cross? . . . . So you know Lucy and Dudley?”
“Fantastic.”
“Jamies competition later. I don’t have any other plans. I had everything blocked out for the day.”
So do we get to meet the boyfriend (!) before the Grimmauld thing?
“Drinks it is, and no, I don’t want to sit outside."
Do you have a way to separate out the vault inventories into categories?
Diagon Alley, London
“No.”
. . . . . . . . . .
Our family is really not hung up about that kind of thing. Well, one of my Uncles is a kind of a jerk, but we rarely see him. But other than him, really they only care about people being happy.
“Get that one.”
Don’t make me guess.
——————————————————————————
“Oh good. I was craving the mushroom tamal and the duck. Prawn with avocado and the salmon for you? Whatever it is you brought me here to talk about must be really something.“
“No, I actually don’t. I might wake up with a tail or something.”
“You’re putting me in black satin?”
Regards,
We have. And I’m not going to complain too much about the place, we know that we’re very fortunate, but sometimes Jerry and I look at each other and just shake our heads at what we’ve gotten ourselves into. It’s also in a Muggle community so we have to take precautions with the exterior especially. You can’t just spell snow off the walkway or suddenly magically repair the roof. We do it in combination with hiring muggle contractors. I can say I’ve snuck out after dark and thrown a few spells on the place to move along the progress! Jerry has his own process when it comes to the grounds. He has his own crews for that and they work in Muggle communities all the time.
Very good.
Five questions. Your choice. Go.
“To tell you the truth I wasn’t sure either. But Potter, this is outstanding.”
“Listen. You can’t use that language. Not until you’re a million years old!”
“I know you will! And he’s not just a portrait. He’s family.”
“Oh, so amazing.”
I understand why you say that. You both know how much I love this place. There are a lot of memories here, but let’s make new ones. I am looking forward to dropping by to visit the GRANDCHILDREN! Let’s do this! I’m excited.
“Okay I’ve got to go take care of this. We’ll be downstairs as soon as my panda’s hair is perfect.”
OMG not this again.
“She’s been ready since 4:00. Bouncing off the walls.”
“I’ve considered it, but Harry and I are committed to a diverse staff.”

Ms. Hannah Abbot
How many tanks?
Malfoy Manor (Fidelius)
I think I’m good for now, but you might help with the roof garden? Suggest some trees that would work on the roof?
I’m NOT JOKING. It’s so cool. I’ll bring the brochure with me to the Leaky. You need one!
“Dare.”
My penmanship tutor, Amanda O’Byrne, taught all of the Black children going back to the 1940’s. She was long in the tooth when she taught me. Related to Finnigan I believe. Yes, she would have been tutor to Sirius and Regulus as well.
LE CONDITIONNEUR
Can we read what you’ve got so far?
“NO you’re fine. You’re the DAD. We’re just having fun. We did it for the kids.”
“You use this ring to hold it together you don’t even have to tie it! It will go nice with your magenta hair. . . . . I’ve thought this out, Draco!”
They wouldn’t.
_____________
“No. This is a whole new program and Mungo’s isn’t equipped. So we’re building an off-site facility. Well . . . . we are if you approve.”
Ugh, you two! Stop teasing me.
I know!
“Deep breath dad. . . .Right now the younger one needs a nap.”
“Your Papa Teddy painted these.”
“I’ll pass. We’ll all meet you there. . . . . . . ”
Draco, I’m not sure I have any?
“Taken care of. You’ve already arranged for the moving crew. Sean will supervise them.”
“Yes!”
Love You BYE!
I may see you over there. I’ve got some things to do at the office and I need the gym.
I’ve still got a couple things to finish up. But I’ll do the same.
I can also verify that! Lucy is doing great at the school. Catching on super fast!
“Potter!”
The gossip? Did you already spill it?
“Where’s Cib?”
“Yes, I’ve brought something you might find interesting.”
Any ideas?
“See? Case closed.”
They are like sisters.
“No need. But I would suggest you bring in earthworms. They will continue to work the soil.”
Nev! Do I need to remind you that your Wife is Luna Lovegood-Longbottom?
Where will we have Christmas and Samhain?
We’ll be there in five.
“Not awake yet. . . . . . Keep breathing and waking up for me.”
With that said, we hope to develop a new, improved, honest Daily Prophet and look forward to earning your trust. We believe we can.
This is going to be good. And did Dad tell you about his move?
Neville Lovegood-Longbottom “
I can help at Wiseacre’s too. But for the most part I’ll be helping Molly with the kids at home.
“Decram we need something to carry the books in and I need something to turn into a Portkey.”
I’m afraid he is.
“Sure.”
“Nothing really.”
“Children were home tutored before moving on to Hogwarts. This will be mostly classrooms. Probably a small library. . . .This is the lounge area. More like the common room at school.”
“Says it’s a novelty.”
“Dad?”
Of course I am.

“Calming. Lavender mist. . . . .the shower is this way.”
DONE! AND DONE!!
“You’re at least joining me in the shower?”
“I want you to do it.”
“I make my point then. It was a gift. Something he wanted you to have. And don’t get me wrong that print is art, but it becomes something different and even more valuable when it’s a gift like that. That is heart currency. You know that he didn’t just pull that out of a pile and put it in a frame at the last minute. He wasn’t given a Muggle knighthood for nothing. He took the photo with you in mind, developed the film in his darkroom and made the print. All the time thinking of his daughter.”
Draco L. Malfoy
You’re welcome. I’ll keep it updated!
Draco’s going to help. Your Mum too.
Are you angry?
Happy Holidays!
In the kitchen getting things prepped for our roast dinner with Pansy and George. Penelope says hi.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Of course. Hogwarts crest on the left.”
“Come on. . . . inside voices. . . . Davey’s sleeping.”
“Yes and it can’t be Narcissa. You have to pair up with someone who’s not your significant other.”
“Unless I win. Then we go into the tie breaker. Don’t be so sure, Mister Weasel.”
It’s definitely not a requirement but they will be invited and there are plenty of rooms. They are in the wedding party after all.
“Paloma.”
“How about two to start?”
Danika has been practicing! He’s magicked his decks and everything!
“This is the cauldron shop. . . . . we’ll go to all of these on Saturday. . . . .Wiseacre’s . . . . . is there a scale on your list? You’ll need a moon chart for sure . . . . . on the right is Flourish & Blott’s that’s the book shop . . . . . Ice cream on the left! It’s the best. . . . . Eeylops . . . . . oh, I have to show you the owlery at the house. . . . . Magical Menagerie
“•” Lucy Petunia Evans. Oh that’s just lovely.”
. . . . . . . . . .
I know it’s unexpected. Luna say’s you’re quite talented with watercolours.

Remus Lupin?
Can’t right now. I’ve got Aspen.
“You got blue crystals! They match your jumper.”
So what about Pansy Parkinson?
“I can see it.”
“So far, yes. When did it happen for you?"
“Oh dear. That complicates things. Should we consider separating them?”
HEY THERE GRAMPAWS!!!!!!
Okay I’ll have the car out front. Hugo’s going to meet us there. Nieces name?
As per your request, the staff at Gringotts is honored to give you the requested (truncated) overview of the accounts, vaults and properties managed for you from Gringotts. They are extensive, not only including the U.K. but, overseen by your representative Mr. Liogell at our branches in India, Pakistan, France, Sweden, Iceland, Norway and the United States (by proxy). The actual, Full form version of the accounts will be filed with the Minister of Magic posthaste. A Full form version of the accounts will also be provided to your sworn solicitor upon request.
“Yes I know!”
Alright. I’m good with it. You know, I could just sign this now and it would be done.
. . . . . . . . . .
Merlin. I love this. Are you sure?
“This house itself is magic, Harry. A lot of the upkeep is charm work. With the right staff it will be fine. You bring in other help as you need it for your parties or when you need them but for the general maintenance of this place that is what you need. No more.”
______________
Okay, how about Al?
“Yes they will. The tank is fake.”
“I’ll absolutely do that.”
“Yes, as a matter of fact she does.”
Yes it seems so. Well your Grandmother doesn’t do things by half.
We should do that.
What’s happened?
“They all are a little abstract to be honest. That’s my style of course, but the second here replicates the windows of your potions classroom. . . . . this one is meant for the ballroom at Grimmauld to be used for your lectures to the potion masters’ convention. For the purpose of activating it, this is about a fifth of its actual size.”
—————————————————————————
OMG please no. Not again.
It’s fucking huge. It’s the entire expanse of both shops and the back warehouse. We’ve never known what to do with it.
“How did you do it?”
Owl post to :
“We are? Explain.”
“I know that now. That’s one of the reasons Dud hates it. It’s even worse than most.”
I see seven. There are eight photographs but we disregarded “the chef” as a novelty.
Mr. J. Liogell
“Not on these sheets. You’ve lost your mind, Potter.”
Love you back. Bye.
“I’ve already got your outfit picked out. Do you like these paisley trousers?”
“. . . . . . . . Draco wasn’t fooling around was he?”
Gringotts Secure Post (Personal Goblin Delivery):

“Absolutely. Do you think they’re joking about the trolls?”
Ah yes. Men’s night.
“And these drawers here. Better than a jumbled up cupboard. Danika made the labels for you. He’s getting better and better with graphics.”
“I hate HER even more now. These people were nice. They were smart and creative and from all I can tell just generally good. She took that all away from us. Why? She did it to you too, Mother.”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Zebb, Al and my Mother are assisting her.
“Jon?”
Zebb?” How is that fair?!
“I’ll think about it. The really weird thing is Draco and Dud getting along.”
“HA! Perfect!!. . . . .stabilize it!”
Lemon herb chicken with rice and asparagus? I’ll pull some chardonnay and put it to chill?
“Just shoot me. I hate this fucking contest. Sheeran??? REALLY??? AGAIN???”
“ No babies . . . . . . . I'd rather have more Grandchildren and another coffee?”
“Not really. I can have Sean coordinate the room bookings.”
Of course I can. What do you need?
Are you sure about this?
“I know you’re being snarky, but you know Rosie actually would love having you here . . . I’ll talk with my Gringott’s guy. See what’s available.”
Like what?
NO! I need to talk to them separately. For now it’s just you three.

“That last match was the best! It’s settled this time for sure.”
I love the fence and gate! . . . . New porch!”
No need. Mr.
Yes. YIKES He’s moving into the haunted house! I can’t wait to see it.
DAMMIT. WHAT NOW?
No idea whatsoever.
It’s really not much different I suppose. You practically live together anyway. Just a different location.
Sounds about right.
“Well, we know that the entrance hall painting is going to be your blue chair, but would you be satisfied with something less conventional for the others?”
“I missed it? Grandmother’s cooking?”
“Spain?”
Have a seat, I’ve got a special appointment. Where’s the Mugwump? Who’s the Mugwump?
“Of course.”
“Glamour.”
“The chill is coming off the place at least.”
“Grayson, you need to decide what you want to do about the memory charm. Harry, you too.”
“How about THIS! “•”
“Cool. I’ve got things pretty well planned out at the cottage."
