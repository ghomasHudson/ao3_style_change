He strained to overhear their conversation, tuning out the team’s chatter as Nate spoke quietly to Malfoy.
write were the ones that wouldn’t flow. Words like “happy” and “content,” phrases like “I’m doing fine” and “I’m glad you’re getting along in the States, even if everything’s not perfect.”
Mollified, Harry allows Malfoy to continue, though he tenses up as Malfoy firmly wipes his pelvis and works his way down over Harry’s cock and balls. Though Harry still feels trauma about the incident with Asten, he can see eroticism behind this experience with Malfoy. When the blonde finally reaches his pucker, what Harry felt to be his most violated place, he can’t help grunting in pain as the rag touches a wound Asten created. Malfoy sets the rag back in the pail, gently using his hands to spread Harry’s arse. Retrieving his wand, Malfoy whispers what Harry presumes to be healing spells because they aren’t ones he’s heard before. However, they are much milder than those, as they cause the least possible pain in restoring the skin.
“None of that is your fault, Harry!” Draco cocked his head to one side and stared at Harry for a long pause, then he smiled. “But I shall nonetheless allow you to make it up to me. In bed.”
"We should talk," he said, as Malfoy made almost exactly the same decision, saying simultaneously, and oddly loudly: "Want a blow job?"
“The strongest possible wards require your blood, your sweat, your tears, and… a drop of your semen.”
“We’re kissing,” Harry said, “because you needed to prove you’re not homophobic, and that you don’t have a problem with me being gay.”

Neville smiled and clapped Harry on the back. “I think you’re right.” he said, clearly delighted. “Now we just have to get

“You know what the Wizengamot said,” Granger harangued, but Draco knew this was the wrong tactic from her. He wished he could waltz in there and explain for himself. Potter didn’t need to hear about all the waiting women, or how pleasant this experience could be if he would only relax and allow it. From Granger and her ilk, Potter needed a firm hand combined with a reminder of how good the outcome would be for everyone else. Obedience plus saving the day. Frankly, he was quite surprised Granger didn’t understand this far better than he did.
"Of course I can try to explain it again, Mr. Potter, I simply… I don't see how this is so hard to understand."
Harry nodded and Draco began to learn how far down Harry's neck his beard grew. He would bet that Harry had shaved or magically depilated shortly before their date, but here it was only a few hours later and Draco could already feel the poke of hair from the pores. Harry probably had five-o-clock shadow every day before lunch.
“You learn your wards, heal those elves, and take care of Narcissa. On Friday I’ll bring you back to mine for dinner?”
Harry was now even more off balance. He'd thought the Headmaster had been dismissing everything he'd been saying.
"I'll show you what I want then, Harry. I'll strip nice and slow for you, and then when I'm finished you can strip for me. All right?"

Harry felt himself blush. He hadn't expected that to come up. But the Merchieftainess gave him an appraising look and seemed somewhat encouraging now. Malfoy looked at Harry, who stared back, unable to fathom what, if anything, was expected of him. But Malfoy nodded solemnly and then turned back to the Merchieftainess.

sat down next to Potter, and then Draco spilled coffee all over himself and had to hurry back to Slytherin for clean robes.
“I own six hectares,” Harry agreed. “Six extremely remote, easily warded, deeply hidden hectares. With a house smack dab in the center.”
Draco suddenly remembered an amusing story his mother had told him about Goyle’s Mum and a painting she’d done out on the moor near her home, and he worked to repeat it as humorously as possible.
Fuck, this healer really liked Mouth's tits. Harry squirmed a little. He was getting an erection himself now, and while he could call Hole over to suck him off this second if he so much as snapped his fingers, he didn't particularly want to show off his cock.
“I was actually thinking I’d like to take you on a holiday,” Harry said, looking earnest, hopeful and possibly a bit sick. “To America. We would start in New York City, I thought? And then, er, Boston? The wizarding districts in both are, uh, pretty famous, and…”
“Are we really going to do this?” Neville whispered as Harry drew near, but he let Harry come closer, and then they touched their lips together.
Or take Parkinson and "defile" her repeatedly, so that no pureblood would have her to wife, no fancy Manor, no large bank account, no pretty Malfoy cock for her, ever again. Prove Lucius Malfoy right. Show Malfoy the one girl he ever had, ever would fuck, was a whore.
“About us getting serious?” Harry said casually, as though this was normal. “Yeah. Seemed like it was time. Why? He wasn’t negative with you, was he?”
“The facts are evident. These superior wards conjure sentient protection around the Manor and grounds. You control them and would be aware of any attempted breach. You could imprison or repel anyone who tried.”
"As you wish, Mr Potter," Afelgate said seriously, but he was already caressing her breasts with both hands.
Harry gave Draco a sad smile, and kissed him, once. Then he slipped out of bed, quickly put on most of last night's clothes, and wrapped the horcrux in his discarded shirt. He kissed Draco one more time, this time a lingering kiss, and gave him an awkward hug. "I'll be waiting for you, Draco."
Then Harry came, bellowing. Stuttering. Weeping a bit. “Merlin. Fuck. Thank you. Oh Draco, thank you. Thank you so much.”
Harry sighed. “Suppose you’d better. I still look a bit strange to your Living Wards when you’re not there.”
“Does the Fusion Doorway seem to work as well in practice as your books suggested it would in theory?” Draco asked. They walked together toward the Manor’s most formal parlor.
“Why is this all news to me?” he said instead, feigning calm. Do you not think you should have told me before I went off to

Harry was standing (barely). His back to his sink, cock out, brain nearly off. “Good,” he wheezed. Draco teased, tormented him with lips and tongue. The back of his throat. Fingertips.
Fidgety, anxious, and completely unable to remain seated, Draco stood up and bounced a little on his toes. “That makes no sense.” He put his hands on his hips. “That is
Draco called out from behind the half-closed bedroom door. "I know you had a lousy day, lover, you almost always do. So I got our favourites from Bombay Palace and put them under Warming Charms. But I think before you eat them, you should get a chance to rest, just like you said."
“Because you always knew how to handle every difficulty you’ve dealt with through the years?” Draco said. “Before it arrived?”
"So do you think you could offer Harry something simple?" McGonagall said quickly, looking at Harry's blush. "You are welcome to have dinner here, of course. Why don't you offer Harry to share dinner with you tonight at the faculty table?"
"Ungh," Harry groaned, unable to articulate how desperately he wanted to drill into Draco like a woodpecker.
“Oh, you definitely spoke,” Harry said as calmly as he could to Draco’s soapy back, “but you were quiet. I wonder if that’s why I never heard you before? I didn’t understand anything. It was just random words. Anyway, we should hurry if we’re going to eat breakfast.”
“I’m sorry, Andromeda,” he finally said, head still down. “Of course Teddy should have them in his life. He should have as many people to love him as he can.”
By the authority granted us by the citizens of wizarding England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, we the Wizengamot hereby unanimously grant to Harry Potter the service, body and life of one convicted criminal:
Harry on his knees, looking up from the floor of Draco’s tiny, utilitarian dormitory shower. Barely fitting in the space, somehow still sexier than anyone had a right to be, but nonetheless looking at Draco like
Draco could hardly move, but he could feel the words penetrate all the way through to his ice-cold soul.
Malfoy nodded and scooted back so fast that something banged loudly against the wall, but Harry just lay down next to him and kissed him again. This time Malfoy's mouth opened, and Harry let Malfoy tease the edge of his lips with his tongue.
Three of the guards moved to flank Harry and Draco, but Harry was already prepared. He stunned the two closest to him, then — using a spell he'd learned from his grizzled, experienced auror partner, he bound all the rest of the merpeople to the King.
Harry stepped back and circled around to look Malfoy in the face. He reached out and pinched Malfoy's nipple gently, then hard. Malfoy winced but remained silent and Harry rushed into his next question, hoping he'd thrown Malfoy off guard. "Was it a Death Eater's cock?"
"Why would I read something if I don't have to?" Harry asked cheekily, hoping Malfoy would laugh again. He grinned at Malfoy who laughed in surprise and then lay down on the floor next to Harry, his face by Harry's feet.
for anything having to do with you at all, you self-righteous, self-satisfied prick! As a matter of fact, I was minding my own damn business, trying to prepare for a mother load of N.E.W.T.s., keeping my fucking head down and staying the hell out of trouble, when
“Oh!” Harry said, clearly surprised. “Not at all. I mean, the likelihood that they would come looking for us way out there in the forest was pretty damn low, but what if they knew about that whispering-gallery wave thing, too? If we’d come on the earth, damn, we’d have been sitting ducks.”
"Huh. Awfully glad I didn't think of that last night in the dark. Think of what we would have missed!"
“Yes?” Draco reached for Harry’s hand, tipped his head slightly on the pillow. He gave a piranha smile. Chose not to wink.
Draco sipped his tea, stared out his bedroom window, watched the snow swirl, and considered further.

"As I was saying, the magic won't set properly if you aren't taking him while I complete the ink and magic. You'll also have to orgasm inside him at a very specific time during the ritual, but I can help you control that, that won't be an issue. So, let's just spread his legs a bit here, and…." Scrivener gestured a press and Harry took the dildo, glancing at it. It was about the same size as himself, and he realized that meant he must be of average size. Perhaps even smaller than average. That was a bit distasteful.
“I, uh, when I’m… I mean.” Draco swallowed. “I imagine bottoming, er, more often than I… I mean, I haven’t really
Draco lay naked, hard and masturbating on his bed. Harry had to have that, despite Malfoy’s bitchiness and selfish nattering about others. He started to strip, tossing his clothes over his chair. “You expected to be married already?” he asked, working the tight, circular neckline of his undershirt over his glasses.
“So, but, you’re happy?” Harry interjected, suddenly uncertain. “With the connecting door and living together full time now, and—”
Draco turned toward the doorway, faked a smile, and tried to pretend he was calm — as though the thundering of his heart was normal.
It wasn’t long at all before Draco began to see decorations he didn’t understand. Harry explained the pink triangles* (horrifying), the rainbow flags (a much more welcome story), and all the related trappings of Pride, which was apparently to be celebrated in this very neighborhood around the end of June. Harry said there would be a parade, a carnival, and a music festival. That during June gay people ‘round the world celebrated being gay. He’d attended the year before, he said, and it had been wonderful.
Harry'd had a devil of a time explaining to Ron and Hermione why he wasn't going to spend Yule at the Burrow, after all. He'd decided, along with Dumbledore, that it would be too distracting for them to know he would be with Malfoy. So he'd firmly explained that he'd be horcrux hunting, and no, they couldn't help. Dumbledore would be watching his back, and he'd give them more details later.
In the morning, Harry awakened early and slipped out of the car before Malfoy woke up. He "hid" in the café-bar, sitting there even before there was food for sale. Once they arrived in Milan they had to change trains, and Harry purchased an enormous British newspaper in the station and pretended to read it, or sleep, all the way to Lecce.
Draco invented a quite plausible explanation for why no one had ever mentioned this before (he slept behind warded curtains, his mumblings were quiet), and Harry never failed to be grateful Draco had no idea Harry owned a Pensieve.
“See it as a gift,” Harry suggested, digging his thumbs deliciously into the ball of Draco’s right foot.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. He squeezed Harry’s hand under his. “Once. Six weeks ago. I don’t make our decisions, Harry. I don’t buy the coffee or the dinner or the tickets to the movie film. And so neither do I choose the coffee place, or the restaurant, or the movie film we see.”
But the complete lack of actual sexual pleasure in this real touch of their lips, he realized sadly, probably did mean something. He pressed his lips harder against Neville’s, but it just made the whole experience feel more ridiculous. Kissing Neville was about as sexually exciting as kissing a slice of cantaloupe. He started to giggle.
“When we got the right Auror in the room with him, he started chattering like a magpie,” the Litigator continued. “He’s delusional, specifically about you. Went on and on about ‘mending your relationship’.”
Watching Harry move through his domestic chores raised a sensation in Draco’s chest he wasn’t ready to examine. Instead, he rose from the table and slipped behind Harry, where he stood at the sink.
“I… see,” Narcissa said, sipping tea. The Ministry Litigator (no older than Draco!), steepled her fingers and looked at her, calm and quiet, waiting for her to be ready for more. “Peculiar that I don’t remember him.”
“I feel the same, you know,” Draco said, feeling uncharacteristically secure. “I didn’t need a man. I wasn’t pining for a boyfriend. I was proud of my work and enjoying life. But I think this relationship…”
Harry assumed he would be embarrassed, later, to hear himself in these memories, but if — while Draco’s cock was slamming his prostate — he was less than poetic… well. Repetition was neither a sin, nor an insult.
It was Natia Maisuradze who finally convinced Draco to stop apologizing. “No one wanted your germs, Malfoy, we’re all glad you stayed the hell away. Now get back to work, will you?”
“The man I hire must be able to get me hard very quickly and easily. He must be able to get me off every time, without challenge, and to make the blow job last as long as I want or go as fast as I need. And of course, I require my professional cocksucker to swallow.”
Feeling utterly out of his depth, Harry just nodded at Merchieftainess Murcus, hoping his confusion could be mistaken for respect -- at least through a bubble-head charm.

Draco leaned back against Harry. Vials of blood, sweat and tears rested on the mantle. Harry had painlessly pulled all three fluids from Draco’s body with spellwork. He could do the same with Draco’s semen, but since ejaculating would strengthen the wards, and Mother and the Manor were targets, Draco was masturbating – fully clothed.
“If you wish,” Draco said politely, but Harry heard the insincerity. So did Narcissa, from the increased tilt to her little smile, but she called for Vissy and headed upstairs anyway.
Despite the lateness of the hour, Harry slipped into joggers, loaned Draco a dressing gown to throw on over his trousers, and made a pot of tea. They sat in Harry’s kitchen and Harry bared his soul. He exposed insecurities. He talked about the war, and work, and the utter mess he’d built in his relationship with Ginny.

Dumbledore did not seem to appreciate Malfoy's outburst, but he did not chastise him. "Mr. Malfoy. Draco. Surely you are aware of Harry's… relationship with Voldemort?"
"My father became a … I think the Muggle word is 'bogeyman.' He filled my nightmares. He was the man I admired and feared and emulated more than anyone in the world. Questioning him and his choices was the hardest thing I had ever done. And, for a long time, I was able to only question his devotion to V-Vol-demort."
It didn't take long to check Hole, as he clearly didn't offer any particular sexual excitement for Afelgate. Harry did enjoy seeing his toy bent flat over the table, though, with the healer's gloved hand deep into his arse, checking for problems while the healer explained about the prostate to Harry.
Harry slid back into Draco’s body, meeting surprising physical resistance; despite the way Draco canted his hips, pulled open his cheeks, pushed himself on. Draco’s entrance and channel had tightened. Probably from the muscle spasms that accompanied flooding Harry’s throat like a firehose.
“Don’t worry about it, Potter,” said Malfoy. “I’d be much more concerned about what you're going to be wearing.”
He and Ron were just finishing a hearty meal at the café down the street from the office, having been banned by the Head Auror from working through lunch. Their promotion to second-class Junior Aurors would be finalized in June, and neither wanted to screw that up by slacking off. This was the type of order that Harry didn’t have an issue following. Still, he had been doing better obeying his commanders these days, which Ron couldn’t believe. As an added bonus, the day had been long and was only going to become longer so all the better to rest now if they were allotted a break.
There didn’t seem to be much point in putting clothes back on, so Draco simply dried himself off and combed back his hair before heading into their shared bedroom and perching on the end of the bed. The sunlight streamed through the window, and he briefly closed his eyes in order to fully enjoy the warmth on his skin.
“I know you never would,” Harry affirmed. “But I really do believe that, once you’re an adult or whatever, you should put your partner first. It’s not just out of necessity, Draco, I
He was too tired to think of a proper retort and instead led Potter to the far side of the garden to where properly maintained Malfoy property was taken over by wild lavender fields. They’d cut a few pathways in-between the wild stalks, but otherwise left the lavender alone. After working in the garden, Draco would often come out to the lavender fields and watch the hundreds of butterflies. He heard a sharp intake of breath as Potter saw them; it was a while before he could form a sentence.
BANG. The door flew open to reveal Hermione Granger wearing a tartan dressing gown and a scowl on her face. “Ronald Weasley! Harry Potter!” she screeched. “Stop this abysmal behavior at
Potter takes the strain off of Draco’s legs by arranging them around his back and neck as he leans in close. “Draco,” he breathes two inches from Draco’s mouth, meeting Draco’s eyes with his emerald green gaze. “You could top if you want; I really don’t mind.”
Somehow, Draco’s touch seemed to sooth Potter, exactly as he hoped it would. “The chocolate ones are the best,” Potter said, handing one to Draco.
Finally, Potter tugged off Draco’s shoes and tossed them to the side, followed by his trousers and pants. While looking right into Draco’s eyes, Potter descended down onto Draco’s cock, taking it into his mouth – Draco appreciated that he didn’t tease – and down to the hilt before gently sucking in a way that made Draco’s eyes snap closed. The sensation was amazing, and Potter only made him feel better and better, especially as he started adding a little tongue flick on every other upstroke.
This torture continued down the woodchip path, past the lake, and through a grassy field. Draco let himself be talked into singing the song a second time, by himself, mostly due to Maggie’s bright eyes but also because they were nearly there so he might not have to finish it. But another group was heading to the archery range from an adjacent path that would soon merge with theirs, and of course
Nate grinned. “Yup, the SDYBSA. My brother Danny founded it; obviously he lives in California. He’s on a mission to ‘bring back the ball’ because not enough low-income kids have access to sports.”
“Deal,” Harry agrees, running his fingers over Draco’s Marked arm again. In response, Draco caresses his face, and Harry thinks that Draco is going to kiss him. But instead, he gracefully initiates a hug to which Harry responds eagerly. Disappointed, he buries his face in the crook between Draco’s shoulder and neck, holding tightly to the blonde man while resisting the urge to nuzzle in. He hasn’t been able to fully process much of what Draco said, especially the part about dating, but this is no longer the time or place for deep reflection.
“But look how he’s weaseled his way into our family!” shouted the Weasel. “Bloody hell, Mum, you’re feeding him Auntie Muriel’s cake!”
“Yes, exactly. Sexual assault can take a lot of different forms, and I think it’s important to recognize them all as valid.”
“I don’t think they’ve noticed us yet,” said Hermione. “If they did, we’d have been shot at already. Unzip me, Harry?” She turned around and lifted her hair, and Harry looked apologetically at Ron before reaching over and unzipping her dress.
“Stuff it, Malfoy,” she said good-naturedly. “If we don’t get these in there, our yolk-mothwing mixture’s going to spoil.”
Sighing, Draco reached up and wiped Jake’s tears away as they begin rolling down his face. He responded gently. “Like I said, I am very attracted to you. I’ve also never been with a man before, and what we did felt so much better than being with a woman that I couldn’t stop.”
Clearly uncomfortable, Potter murmured, “Well, I wasn’t here before under the best of circumstances—”
This trail is longer probably than the diameter of the entire camp. I enjoy the hike, and the climb accompanying the hike. My back actually feels better when I’m not all cramped up on a horrible bench or chair.
He is barely able to process this information before Malfoy turns squarely around and strides back down the middle of the stage to the exit. Harry has a feeling this was part of his act, but wouldn’t be surprised if Malfoy is relieved to get away from him. Though he didn’t reveal his animosity towards Harry while in the final stretch of his act, it had to be hard to perform with his boyhood rival in the audience.
“Even if you only passed the second-class boards by one point,” Ron sniggered. “You still passed, and that’s what counts—”
“Don’t forget to put me on there as well,” said Nate. “Okay, so with you three already onboard, that just leaves Chris, Becky Lou, Zee, José, and Mike.”
“Doesn’t sound terrible to me either,” said Draco casually. “But no, I guess I wouldn’t mind taking a run with you, Potter. We’re going to be spending enough time together this summer anyway.”
“Most definitely!” exclaimed Hermione, sounding scandalized he even asked. “I want to do a dual specialization: Care of Magical Creatures and Potions. It’s silly,” she said, blushing, “But I always thought I could cure Lycanthropy if I knew enough about the subject areas.”
Instead of ending up in the deepest layer of Hell, Draco suddenly found himself standing in a bedroom with half red décor and half green. It was very strange, especially considering how the split colors extended to nearly everything in the room, even the soft duvet covering the bed.
It was Friday night, and for some strange reason, Nate had blessed them with a rare Saturday morning off. Draco and Potter were back at the pitching and hitting grind, making up for the practice they weren’t going to get the following day.
“I didn’t think so,” says Ron, rolling to face the back of the couch and shoving Harry’s bony feet and knees back on his own side.
“Prat,” he murmured, chancing eye contact. Draco only gave him a smug smile in return, taking a grateful swig.
Nodding sympathetically, Harry took a moment to reflect on the oddness of this situation. Sitting by Dumbledore’s tomb in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts, having a heart to heart with Draco Malfoy? He would have never imagined it happening.
“I will say that as hatred keeps increasing towards former Death Eaters, you may be a lot safer in the muggle world.”
“I’m just going to be really upfront about this,” sighs Ron. “Before she left, Hermione made me swear that I would try to get a straight answer out of you.”
“Indeed,” he said. “Go ahead and take the field. Work out the positions amongst yourselves.” As they negotiated who went where, Draco retreated to the dugout to grab a bucket of balls and his preferred bat. Impressively, the girls decided their positions with as much ease as he and Mike had yesterday. Potter was right; this was going to be a good group.
now; knitting’s not really a challenge, not anymore, and that amigurumi you bought me was just adorable—”
“Tonight?” Hermione said. “But Draco, we still haven’t gone through those supplemental reading tomes from Malfoy Manor…”
“I don’t live here for the area, Potter,” replied Draco dryly. He loved being so close to campus but lived in complete and utter dismay of the unsavory neighborhood. College Area was interesting, to say the least.
“–-growing wings, and painting himself to look like the Golden Snitch so that I’d always want to chase after him.”
He knew Harry would definitely feel a burn without a little more prep, but thought he could make it bearable. Slicking his cock to the point where it looked like he’d already come, Draco lined himself up with Harry’s hole and started pushing in, kissing his lover and reassuring him continually so that he didn’t clench and cause unnecessary pain. Only when he was buried balls-deep in Harry did Draco allow himself to finally feel the pleasure of being encased in such a tight space. Even as pleasure ran through him while he began gently thrusting, Draco preferred bottoming. The one part he did appreciate was getting to show Harry the part of sex he loved so much.
“None,” he answered gloomily, starting to fall back into the feelings of hopelessness and despair that had driven him to never want to leave his bed again.
“Hermione and I are now very close,” Draco inserted unexpectedly, gripping Harry’s hand tightly. “We’ve always had a lot in common, and though I can never apologize fully for the prejudice I displayed in our early years of school, she’s managed to look past that--as has Harry--to see who I’m trying to become.”
“About living in the…” Draco broke off. He thought saying the words aloud, in the perfectly reasonable light of day without alcohol induced hazes, might just break him. “About living in the muggle world,” he blurted, in one breath.
“I know,” he responds. “Thanks for warning me. But I don’t want to hide this – I feel like I shouldn’t have to. As much as I want revenge, I think I’d rather have them subjected to justice and punished according to law.”
To stay in that cabin any longer would be the death of him, so Draco recovers his flashlight and walks down a different path, the one that led to the fire pit where other counselors sang songs after dinner. He’d only listened, not sang, and yet several of the tunes were permanently embedded in his head. Humming one about a great big moose, Draco hops over a fallen tree branch and wandlessly Summons a bag of marshmallows. What the camp directors don’t know will never hurt them. He pops one into his mouth, chewing pronouncedly. Rounding the bend still with a mouthful of squishy goodness, Draco heads pell-mell for the fire pit only to see Potter already sitting on the very stump he was planning to occupy.
“Er,” Harry said eloquently. For no other reason than to play for time, he picked up the Gurdyroot tea again and took a swig, instantly regretting it. One look at Draco’s pale face convinced him to keep going. “Draco’s changed,” he mumbled, feeling stupid. There was a slight press on the side of his leg, a weight set on top of his knee--Draco’s hand, Draco breaking his stoic posture in a gesture meant to comfort.
, no doubt) that had been hired instead of him. The ones that would celebrate their final year by doing what they
aspect of my life. I couldn’t even walk out in public without something dastardly happening, or without some vigilante trying to take justice into their own hands.”
“You know, Potter,” he said, trying to diffuse the tension. “Maybe we can have outing number three after all. I know this wonderful bookstore in Muggle London. I bet you’ve never even seen some of the cool gadgets they’ve got there.”
Draco learned that he quite liked both of these things as well, but he made an even more exciting discovery: he liked having his bum played with. Harry took his fingers and wet them before lightly rubbing the outside of Draco’s hole, which instantly made him harder and all the more turned-on. When Harry gently a finger inside Draco, he immediately clenched around it and held; enjoying the burn but also a little nervous that it was going to hurt. But Harry continued his ministrations on Draco’s cock, wetting his finger more before pushing it back inside again and feeling around. It was strange until he brushed over something inside Draco that enhanced all of his sensations, and he found himself crying out in pleasure, begging Harry to continue pressing into that spot.
Without a word, Draco brandished his wand with a quick jab and put Harry’s cigarette out, still smoking.
The end of the semester was rather unmemorable, though Harry and Draco did ambush Hermione as well as Neville in several guerilla snowball fights, and they only ended up getting utterly wrecked about half of the time. Harry had another public spat with Ron in the Great Hall and a rather private one in Charms, though Draco heard Harry swear hotly about “scoundrel former best friends” more than once over the following weeks.
Draco muffled his annoyance and focused on breathing. After a number of seconds, he found that his head was clearer and it was somehow easier to block out Zee’s narrowed eyes and Nate’s hopeful expectations.
Draco said nothing. Of course there were those who still harbored prejudice against him, but on the by and large he was treated with respect. Harry knew the difference between knowing something to be true and actually believing it in your heart. He understood that Draco still thought of himself as demonic, and surely it would be another ten years before he was convinced otherwise.
“I know,” sniggers Draco. “Why do you think I need a break, Potter?” As Harry’s face falls, Draco swoops down and kisses him again, lovingly and chastely. “Just kidding.”
Absently, considering this new information, Harry put a casual hand on Mouth's belly. Her skin was very soft, and he liked to stroke her there. Afelgate pulled his hand from Mouth's tit and stilled the hand that rested on her cunt.
“Thank you Vissy, Bippy,” Harry told the house-elves, who’d begun clearing the dishes. “We’d appreciate tea in a half-hour in the sitting room, please. No pudding tonight. Dinner was delicious.”
“Hm,” Potter said. “Instead, you’ve been sentenced to extract my sperm and magically redistribute it to a half dozen women who I’ll be impregnating. Twice a week, no less.” He sounded disgusted again. “I agree, Malfoy, your scenario is a hell of a lot more sexually exciting than what the damn Wizengamot came up with.”

“She thinks your mother should go,” Harry said, sounding just a little grim. “Because if Rosscot knows she’s watching, he’ll likely incriminate himself far more thoroughly.”
“That…” Andromeda seemed to be choosing her words with tremendous care. “...didn’t feel like a violation?”
After a brutally swift lunch on Tuesday, Draco decided that a nice long wank was in order. Purely because it would help him stay away from Potter, of course. He hid inside his bed curtains, nude and lubed, his dildo in his arse. He spelled it to fuck him very slowly as he dreamed about nothing in particular. Really, all fantasies were the same, and none of them meant anything at all. They were simply the fastest way to come, and come hard.
In the morning Harry woke, still so relaxed, so sated, so… well… happy was really the word for it. He stretched and opened his eyes and looked right into the eyes of Malfoy, no, Draco. His lover. Shit. Harry had a lover. He smiled, and Draco smiled back. Harry felt warmed down to his toes. And his cock stiffened slightly more, adding to his expected morning wood.
Harry bought a bag full of junk food and a twelve pack of Stella and they skedaddled off to Grimmauld Place on foot as quickly as possible.
"Er…" Harry said, and lay down on the floor. There was so little space. "Because you guided us through the train station when we switched trains?"

"Maybe we could work together?" Draco replied, and he sounded shockingly hopeful, so Harry turned and looked at his face, to see what Draco actually looked like right now. He looked lit up from within, like this half-brained idea was the best thing he'd ever heard. Like his dead puppy had just jumped up off the floor: alive, with a winning lotto ticket in her mouth.
“No ‘but’,” Harry said, pulling Draco close. “Not for me. It was just plain good. I loved it. We should do that every damn day.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I hope you can turn your eyes to another man, one not consumed by work and family.” He attached it to Phoenix’s outstretched leg.
“I would never keep you from Teddy. But Draco needs some time, and I respect that. So, no, I don’t think you will be visiting in quite the same way once Draco moves in. You can owl me any time, or send a Patronus if you prefer. Teddy and I will come visit you, or I can suggest Draco skip dinner, if need be.”
“M’not withdrawing from Hogwarts, if that’s what you mean,” Harry mumbled. McGonagall gestured at a chair, and Harry slumped into it.
"We can't portkey this whole tent," Malfoy said finally. "We can't Apparate with bubble-head charms on, let alone carrying all this gear, no matter how well we shrink it. But… I agree with you. This is horrible. We need a better way. I don't know how the merpeople stand this."

When the golden web expanded into the walls, floor, ceiling… Draco marveled. When the web retracted into Draco’s gut and balls, Draco fainted.

Draco stared as the last of the coffee dribbled from Harry’s cup. He stood to better see the mess and then waved his Ukrainian wand and muttered spells, clearing up the coffee bit by bit.
The thing appeared to update with magic, but he wasn’t sure he could trust it, as it seemed to indicate his aunt had lived at the same address — deep in the rural countryside — since years before Draco was even born. Wouldn’t she have wanted a clean break after the war? Perhaps not.
He didn’t like it, but Andromeda’s reasoning made sense. One snog session, and he wanted her to believe they’d transitioned seamlessly from enemies to sweethearts? It sounded ridiculous, even to him. And he’d been half of that amazing kiss.

They had looked at their class and Quidditch schedules and chosen three nights a week when Draco would come over at 9. If something came up, either could owl a cancellation. They both agreed to stick with the “one fuck, one suck, that order,” plan. The whole situation was strangely… businesslike.
They were in the middle of reconstructing the famous Gryffindor Tower, even though Draco had always hated the sight of it, and he was a bit disgusted that all Potter ever seemed to do was work. Potter kept his word and taken Draco out for lunch two Fridays ago—Draco was late again that week, but Potter forgave him—and they’d had a surprisingly nice time. Before the lunch, Draco hadn’t known if he and Potter could spend time together outside of the Hogwarts Grounds without slipping back into old habits. Now, though, that he was sure they could, Draco wanted Potter to get out a little more. He was entirely too diligent and hardworking for Draco’s tastes.
Sighing, Draco placed a dishcloth underneath the peas to make them more comfortable against his shin. “You just never give up, do you? Alright, fine.” He could have drawn it out, but there didn’t seem to be much point, considering that he’d already been over all the possible outcomes in his own mind. “I want to see Harry.”
“I don’t expect you to trust me, Potter. We haven’t been friends for that long yet, and as you know, some marks never go away.” Malfoy’s eyes automatically sought out the Mark on his arm, looking as though he desperately wanted to cover it up lest Harry take notice (it had only been on display for all of their practices, for heaven’s sake).
They arrived precisely at eleven, though Harry was hesitant to knock on the door. Draco ended up doing the honors. Any other time and he would have made a crack about how he wasn’t sure if the house would come crashing down or not from just the simple touch, but he thought it best not to rile an already-quivering Harry. Not that he would mention to Harry that he was quivering, either. The stubborn prat had been insisting all morning that no, he was
Besides the excitement on the bases, Harry didn’t get too much more action throughout the duration of his first official baseball game. In the top of the fifth, there was a fly ball hit to left field, which Harry directed Chris to take, and in the top of the seventh, the middle infielders and Nate turned a pretty double play, essentially shutting down the Pandas. The Bucks scored again in the bottom of the sixth, so they were leading 2-0. José killed their offense in the top of the eighth and ninth, and so the Bucks skipped their last bats as they lined up on the field to shake hands with the Pandas and say “good game.”
He didn’t know what to say to himself. “Sorry I gave up on you?" “It’s better this way, you coward?" “This is exactly what you deserve, you Death Eater scum?"
He bit back the automatic snarky response that rose on his tongue, because being forced to thank Neville Longbottom was a thousand times better than being strung up by fifth years.
“Move in with me,” Draco said suddenly. “No, fuck Hogwarts,” he said as Hermione opened her mouth to protest. “I’ll lose my mind if I have to stay alone in this empty flat any longer. I can’t just have “empty flat” and “hostile school” for residency.”
Draco responded by swallowing around his cock, pressing the first finger in as Harry reacted in surprise and pleasure. He felt around for the prostate, feeling Harry tighten around him with inexperience and stress. “Shh,” he said, repositioning himself so that he could kiss and reassure Harry. “It’ll feel good soon, I promise.”
“Draco,” said Hermione, putting a soft hand on his shoulder, “I was hoping you’d be the bigger person here and work through it, but it’s your choice. I just want what’s best for you. But I support you always.”
Ron kicks out his chair and sits down, leaving Hermione to fend for herself. “Did you get us some booze, mate?”
Finally, he reached out and grabbed Harry’s arm. “Let’s go.” They went back into the deserted drawing room, and then Draco opened up the door to another corridor and pulled Harry into a run. They reached a slight alcove just before Lucius walked by again, leaving just enough time for Draco to shove Harry into an adjoining alcove and press a cold, pale hand over his mouth. After Lucius was safely out of sight, Draco pulled Harry down the rest of the hallway and through another door. He immediately strode over to a wardrobe and started rummaging through the drawers. Harry realized, even though the surroundings were dark, that this was Draco’s bedroom.
At first, he was just glad to find that he hadn’t Splinched himself. But then, as he looked around, Harry realized that perhaps his id had wrested away too much control. But having agency was a curious thing, and he had, as of late, been unable to shake the feeling that he was watching his life pass him by. How queer that his inner Self chose this specific place to recalibrate his senses.
yet—in Neville Longbottom. Oddly enough, he found himself enjoying the company of the once-meek Gryffindor. As his and Neville’s relationship blossomed, Draco soon found himself back in the good graces of more and more students, and was doing his best to not think of ways he might exploit those relationships during eighth year. Potter would have his arse.
“And so are you, Malfoy,” Harry murmured. “None of your peers can touch you when it comes to academic skill.”
“God?!” Draco burst out laughing, knocking his metallic red devil horns clear off of his head. Harry picked them up for him because it didn’t look like Draco was calming down anytime soon.
After two solid hours of reading and thinking, Draco concluded that Enigma was his best bet. The muggles who’d gone there before said it was expensive, but that the piercers were top notch, the place was clean, and the jewelry was high quality. Expensive wasn’t a problem for Draco and he also especially liked that Enigma only did piercings, instead of both piercings and tattoos like all the other places he’d looked at.
Before Harry had a chance to answer, the Weasel said impatiently, “You look like you could use a game of chess, Malfoy. Or at least I could. Get the Firewhiskey?”
“We’ve exchanged a few letters over the past couple months; things more or less went back to normal after he apologized to you for being such a prat.”
“Come here,” growled Draco, pushing Harry flat upon the bed and lifting his legs. “I need you.” His declaration went straight to Harry’s groin, causing his own cock to throb with the thought of Draco’s desire for him.
Otarres laughed. “I’m glad you think so! Sometimes I just about get swallowed by all this mess in here. But I love it too, because I get to read children’s picture books for a living and flesh out the implications within them. It absolutely makes my next door neighbor Professor Bales crazy. He doesn’t think Children’s Literature is important enough to warrant study.”
Ron sniggered. “To be fair, you did just have three shots of firewhisky. Need me to SideArm you back to the flat?”
Hermione sighed. “It’s difficult to feel as though we’re really contributing something to the field when we’re relying on the discoveries of all these past theorists.”
“Yet you’d never know it,” the Captain grumbled. “I tried to get you transferred back to Britain, you know, but the damned Commander interferred again…”
“In that case, I know just where to start,” Draco said. He uncorked the bottle and poured two generous helpings into the glasses. “Cheers.”
came out on New Years’ Eve, over a month after Harry and Draco did the interview and photoshoot. They’d initially spent the first week post-interview peppering Luna (and Hermione) with questions about when the issue would come out, but Luna would only say “soon” each time they asked and offer up a mystical sort of grin. Asking eventually lost its novelty until Harry forgot about the interview entirely. The post came--in fact it was the last delivery of the year--and it was Draco’s turn to pay the delivery owl. He always bitched and complained when that was the case, claiming that the (in Harry’s opinion) adorable screech owl “was a greedy little bastard who couldn’t be satisfied with just
“Mornin’,” said Weasley. He a few rough scars on his arms, but they only made him more attractive, in Draco’s opinion. “What can I do you for?” he asked.
“Well, Potter?” Malfoy grinned. “In the mood for a cuppa and some biscuits? I’m positively famished.”
Before he went home, Draco stopped at a tea shop. He chose a flavor other than English Breakfast and immediately regretted it. It was such a small thing, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of wishing he could go back and choose again, even as he steadily worked away on his Potions formula. Every sip reinforced that feeling, especially as he tried repeatedly to let it go but couldn’t.
“Probably more,” Hermione amended, snatching the top copy and quickly skimming it. “I know I’ve read at least nine issues-–”
actually intrigued to hear this, so he let Slughorn drone on for slightly longer than usual before making his excuses.
“I hate to say it, Mum, but I completely agree,” said the remaining Weasley. This had to be the pompous Ministry prat, Draco thought. He had the demeanor for it and everything.
Potter remained quiet, waiting to hear Draco’s answer. “I just want to travel with you,” he reluctantly admitted. “Even if we went to bloody Siberia, I would enjoy it because I was with you.”
“Wait,” Draco said anxiously, sitting up. “I want to see you, though I’ve heard it might hurt less from behind.”
“I’m beginning to wonder if you’re right,” sighed Harry. He thought back to Malfoy’s wide smiles and soft lips and wondered if they were worth it after all.
Draco knelt on the floor and stared up at him with a wicked grin. “That’s because I’m going to do this.” Without wasting a second, he leaned in and gently licked up Harry’s cock from shaft to tip.
“Harry, are you sure that this is what you want right now? I know you’ve been going through a bit of a trying time…” hedges Hermione. “Not that I don’t think Malfoy has changed, and all.”
“And this affects us how, exactly?” drawled Zee, crossing his arms. “Please tell us that you’re not volunteering the whole team to spend the summer in San Diego, for god’s sake, coaching a bunch of snot nosed kids.”
“Draco, warm up and get out there on the mound,” Nate ordered. “Until I’ve seen for myself whether or not you can pitch, you’re still on this team.”
The Ministry gave the two free Malfoys a short list of approved places where they could complete their several hours of community service. Narcissa chose the London Gardens while Draco decided to start at Hogwarts. Before the school could be re-opened, major renovations were necessary. After Harry’s testimony, the Minister of Magic himself declared Draco would be cleared to attend Hogwarts to finish his education, also noting he could complete the volunteer hours at his own pace during the academic year. That’s exactly what Draco had been hoping for. Securing any kind of employment was impossible without stellar NEWTs, especially as a former Death Eater.
“I’m going to hold you to that, Potter,” said Malfoy. “In fact, after I slave around for you all day, maybe you’ll even see fit to buy me some dinner.”
Slightly chastised, they gave him guilty faces that still had the traces of smiles. Inwardly, Harry sighed. Malfoy’s girls looked much more disciplined out there on the field. He corrected them seriously, but it was obvious that he was fair across the board. Harry could already tell his girls respected him.
“If I say no to the Weasel,” said Draco, “That would set a poor tone for the whole visit, wouldn’t it?” Her sympathetic grimace was answer enough. He sighed. “Fine, I’ll say yes, but Merlin only knows how upset I’m going to be if the Weasel ruins everything by trying to keep Harry away from me the whole time.”
The door is stuck again, so Draco’s forced to pull on the handle with a steadily increasing pressure until it gives, rocketing out of the jamb and feverishly rattling back and forth from the built-up strain. At least two of his seven co-workers stir from the racket, and he tries not to let the door slam behind him as he makes his way down the steps to the rocky path leading to the bathhouse. Draco relieves his bladder and takes another huge gulp of water while he’s down there, hopefully doing something to quench his never-ending thirst before heading back into the oppressively quiet and claustrophobic cabin.
The living room, thankfully, was tastefully decorated in peaceful colors Draco could have picked out himself, should he have had a room to decorate. He nodded in approval, noticing Potter standing in a position of defeat over by the fireplace.
Draco reeled him back in, hugging Potter close to his chest. Somehow, somewhere, the gods had taken pity on him. They’d given him his deepest desire, fulfilled every one of his longings from the past few years. It would definitely be a shame when they became vengeful and took it all away after they’d had their fun.
Draco tensed, but the changes to his posture were so slight Harry doubted anyone else could discern his stress. “I have to,” he said quietly. “It’ll be hard enough for me regardless.”
“Oh, Jake,” he said, grabbing Jake’s left arm as he continued trying to escape. Jake pulled back desperately, causing Draco to utter “no, no–Jake, no” as he fought to keep the other man from leaving. Draco won, drawing Jake back into his chest for a hug as tears silently ran down Jake’s face.
“I never thought he was dark to begin with,” said Dolohov coldly. “He’s running a strong business, making good deals for some of the rarest antiques in the world. But your lot wouldn’t know that, not with how you’re always trying to worm yourselves into the government—” Harry pounced, slugging him in the shoulder and ducking to avoid the discharge of his gun, which fired right through where his head had been just a millisecond before. Ron took the opportunity to shoot him in the knee, causing Dolohov to scream in pain, clutching it with his good arm.
This was it, then. Without allowing himself time to reconsider, Draco tossed back the vial and drained it, immediately chasing the potion with the crunchy root. It wasn’t unheard of for asphodel to change texture with time without losing potency, so Draco didn’t worry that the root was hard and grainy instead of rather chewy.
“The fact that it’s the last fucking Friday we have to work this year,” Harry said, pouring out two respectable portions of whisky.
He was relieved when Harry went slowly because his body wasn’t used to this anymore and needed plenty of time to adjust. Harry had really good instincts though, and he kept Draco turned on during the entire adjustment period. By the time Draco was fully filled, he was more than ready to speed things up.
Narcissa smiled. “I never said your new life had to exist here where such prejudice and intolerance exists. Draco, I know you were brought up a certain way. With certain ideas about the differences between muggles and wizards…”
They toured the house for at least two hours, sliding around the freshly polished ballroom floors in their socks and riding the bannisters from the top of the stairs to the floor just like royalty did in Muggle fairy-tales. Draco raced Potter down the hallways and beat him by a mile by ducking through several different passages. He showed Potter all of them after Potter demanded to know how Draco had gotten around so fast, pointing out specific books or portraits that acted as entrances. Potter was impressed with Draco’s bedroom, not because it was so lavish, but because it seemed to represent him perfectly. Draco had put a lot of work into redecorating after he and Mother were sentenced to complete their community service hours.
Bugger. Draco had tried on the ruddy thing both ways after he wasn’t able to remember the way the team wore theirs earlier.
“Can I pitch to you?” Malfoy asked, making eye contact with Harry though his face was flushed and his hands seemed to have a slight tremor.
“As Master Draco wishes,” Ceeley conceded, revealing a red, rectangular box that was so pristine it must have been wrapped by magic. “Breakfast is ready in 15 minutes, sir,” she notified, backing out of the room and closing the door behind her.
“No, of course not,” ‘Dromeda said. “But they’re treating former…” and here she broke off, perhaps afraid to offend Draco. With a deep breath, she continued, “…former Death Eaters terribly. Today, I was with Cissy and Teddy in Gringotts, and that young Zabini boy was trying to make a withdrawal from his account. The goblins would have treated him like anyone, but they’ve instilled a new clerk there with names. If you’re on the list, and Zabini was, they want a written account of what the funds are going to be used for.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, continuing down another flight that led to the basement exit. “The layout of this sodding building still messes with me, even after how long we’ve been here.”
After burning through another couple bottles, the group slowly disbanded. Draco had started slowing down after his blushing incident, but was still having trouble standing upright. Jake came over and clapped him on the back, smirking. “You’re a good sport, man.”
He even went back to Debate Club the following week, after a long, self-reflection where he considered the attraction he felt for Jake and what it might mean. Draco wasn’t the type to simply sleep around so he could figure out his sexual identity, but he grudgingly reminded himself to keep it under consideration. Jake, for his part, had been friendlier and more easy-going than when Draco had left his apartment, which was a big relief for Draco. He had been hoping that a momentary lapse of judgement hadn’t screwed up his acquaintance with one person he actually liked in the school. They went on to partner for the next practice debate on women’s health rights and abortion, and annihilated their pro-life competition.
After they completed their exhausting tour of the Manor, Tipsy brought them fresh pumpkin juice—per Potter’s request—and they went outside so Draco could show Potter the grounds. They spent another hour exploring everything from the duck pond to the apple trees to the vegetable gardens, which Potter loved. He went in and picked all the ripe fruits and vegetables, putting them into a wicker basket for Tipsy to carry up to the house. After some coaxing, Draco helped. Potter also had an especially good time stalking the white peacocks across the Manor's sprawling meadows, long grasses poking him through the softer spots in his trainers while Draco laughed himself silly at the sight of Potter chasing around the offended birds.
Wisely, Ron and Hermione refrain from asking about how or why Draco was raped. Harry assumes they understand it’s not his story to tell. Everyone stays quiet for a moment, thinking.
“Totally understand,” Chris nodded. “At UB in New York, we’d always get these weird old ladies trying to sell us candles.”
His hair looked foreign as it lay dormant on the cape covering his shoulders and torso. Draco watched it with a sense of detachment, looking in the mirror as the barber ran the clippers up the back of his head. He’d gone shorter this time, leaving his bangs in place while gently fading the back and sides up above his ears. It felt like him, even as Draco increasingly didn’t know what that meant anymore.
The sun was already shining brightly down on the dark clumps of horse refuse but not yet causing the lovely scent of manure to waft over the meadows of Camp Cedarwood. Draco looked at the long row of stalls in dismay, wrinkling his nose distastefully. He snuck a peek around at his fellow counselors in an attempt to find someone to emphasize with, someone who was feeling just as miserable as he was. Unfortunately, as with all the other cruel and unusual camp activities they had participated in so far, everyone else looked awake and seemed relatively chipper.
. Wincing, Harry forced himself upright before viciously attempting to strangle Ron. They writhed around on the floor together, kicking over lamps, upsetting furniture, and wreaking havoc on the room.
Remorsefully, they retired from the porch with enough time for a restful night’s sleep before the morning grind of paper pushing and suspect profiling. Harry resigned himself to more anxiety and stress, secretly hoping though that Draco would get word to him soon. But until then, he vowed that his heart would not waver. He would not make that same mistake ever again.
As Malfoy approached, he called out, “Well, Potter? Ready to get this show on the road?” He subtly ignored the glares from several Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, who were passing by with candelabras. Harry locked eyes with Malfoy, but was instantly distracted by a motion just behind Malfoy. One of the Ravenclaws had lit a candlestick and was trying to subtly catch Malfoy on fire. Did she honestly not see Harry standing there, or think that he would refrain from intervening? Well, it was time to make an example out of someone trying to fuck with Malfoy.
“What am I going to do with you,” Harry joked, crossing the kitchen with an apron around his waist. “I’d kiss you, but I just took a shower, thanks.”
“Sorry about the delay,” the man said apologetically. “There’s a whole lot of us just helping out for a couple weeks while the owner’s on vacation. Family friend and all.”
He settled himself onto the picnic table and waited for their nightly staff meeting to happen. Beans was present, and so were Draco’s co-counselors, but Potter’s group was taking a while. Eventually Potter’s co-counselor’s emerged, and they said Potter was having trouble getting one of the campers to relax. Eventually, Beans decided to reschedule the meeting for tomorrow, and though everyone else said their goodnights, Draco stayed at the picnic table, waiting for Potter.
But even so, there was something to be said for reading. Draco could almost agree with Hermione Granger that books were the best places imaginable. Of course, the books Draco would have chosen himself were nothing like the ones his professors assigned. But in time he came to enjoy those all the more. After taking a crash course in muggle technology, namely computers, Draco found the school’s academic databases. He would play a game with himself. First he would read the designated text and sketch out as many interpretations as possible; the more fantastical, the better. Draco wasn’t satisfied with simple interpretations about the color blue or the symbolism of apples. To give himself the tools to do
“I can’t imagine that went over well,” he empathized, peeling at a small piece of loose wood. “Seems like the opposite of what would help me.”
“Well, Draco, that just goes to show you shouldn’t have waited until the last minute to write your statement of purpose!”
“It’s nothing,” Harry said, furiously wiping dirt off of his shirt. “Goddamnit, I can’t reach my back.”
All too soon, I climb back down and continue on my way up. There’s a firepit with some ashes in it, a water spout, and a rusty old bucket. Minimal, but I wasn’t expecting much else. The hilltops are gorgeous, bathed in a golden yellow light, and I enjoy the last few rays of lights as the sun dips below the horizon. Suddenly it’s dusk, and I’m up here all alone in a place that I hate.
“I’ll be waiting for your owl tomorrow,” says Draco. He turns to leave for real this time, but Draco calls out, “About that hug?”
It did no good to dwell on the choices he’d made. For the last four years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco’d done everything under the sun to prove his worth. He took seven NEWTs after finishing his final year at Hogwarts, choosing to pursue a Potions Mastery after graduation. Though he’d had various apprenticeships along the way, most were cautious about hiring him because of his probation. When the letter had come, halfway through his fourth year of supervision, offering an alternative – spend nine weeks as a counselor at a Muggle-style summer camp and be reinstated as a proper citizen of society a year early – Draco agreed without a second thought.
He needn’t have worried. Malfoy crosses the room in two long strides and sinks down on the floor next to Harry, saying nothing but dissolving the bonds. Conjuring up a small green pail, Malfoy wets a soft washrag and glances towards Harry for permission. He nods. With that, Malfoy gently pushes Harry’s hair and glasses back and begins quietly wiping his face, erasing tear tracks and sweat. After Harry’s face feels freshened, Malfoy rinses the rag and then starts rubbing down his chest, concentrating on removing all traces of Asten’s blood. As Malfoy continues, Harry relaxes, focusing on the feeling of being cleansed. He empties his mind to remove himself from the night’s events.
“Good morning!” shouted Neville Longbottom (camp name Catastrophe), the assistant horse director. Draco was always astonished how anyone could be that loud or energetic before seven in the morning. “Let’s get these stalls mucked! There’s rakes in the last stall there, and y’all can roll out a wheelbarrow to shovel the poop into.”
“I simply cannot tell you,” said Father coldly, “How disappointed I am to have you for a son. What I wouldn’t have given for a task as mindless as marriage when I was young!”
It was a minute before Potter pulled away. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that,” he told Draco.
“Touché,” pronounces Harry, toasting Ron with his water glass. “Merlin, how am I going to make it through tomorrow with him?”
“Yeah, I don’t do casual sex,” Harry continues on. “Otherwise I would have hit either one of them back up again.”
“You’re not serious,” Draco said. He looked down and scoffed. “You, who broke up with your ex-boyfriend on your
“Not to me," said Potter, ever stubborn. "But if you feel so strongly about it...Would you be so kind as to serve me up a proper cup of
“Fair enough,” Draco conceded. Potter turned and started walking away, and Draco fought not to admire Potter’s ass, streaked as it was with reddish-brown dirt. “Wait – Potter,” Draco called out. “Will you bring me some of that stuff you play in?”
Almost immediately, the entire group of campers latched onto what was happened and echoed, “This is a repeat song!”
“You’re impossible,” Harry replies, shaking his head. “And you better not do anything to embarrass me!” he hisses at Ron’s retreating back.
Nate did a double take. “Shit, that’s right, Harry. We have an odd number on the team –” he looked downcast for a second, and then straightened back up again with a gleeful look on his face. “I’ve got it! You can work with Draco.” Before either of them could move or even breathe, Nate caught Draco’s eye. “You wouldn’t mind a bit of recreational coaching, would you? I’m sure Danny would fairly compensate you for it.”
“Fine, then,” he glowered. “Siberia it is. I hope you still have your ridiculous fur coat, because you’re going to need it.”
He stopped at the sudden look of nausea that came over Ron’s face. “Anyway,” Harry mumbled, “I can’t get on with it until this is resolved once and for all.”
They cuddled for a moment before Draco started feeling really uncomfortable despite his tiredness. “Potter,” he mumbled. “I’m cold and wet.”
“I don’t give a damn how he’s feeling!” His careful demeanor, perfectly composed for the past two and a half weeks, finally fell away at the slightest prodding. “That prick sure didn’t give a bloody thought as to how I would feel about all this. He betrays me and then goes and gets himself a disease. It’s worse than if he’d been knocked up.”
“Alright, then I’ll pay you what I pay Ron and Hermione,” Harry decides. He finds the problem with the hinge and fixes it, restoring the cabinet back to the wall’s good graces.
“Call – them – back,” said Draco in-between coughs. Ceeley began setting up the call again, and he said, “Ask that miserable sod to arrange the deposits to cover the new amount.”
"Absolutely." Harry had no idea where this would led. But regardless, he had to have faith in the fact that Draco turned out to be as kind as he seemed. And trying to trust someone new was the only way to find out.
He'd let Harry kiss him so many times, it became like a daily ritual. They'd gone much further than that, was much further. There had been hickeys on both of their necks, hidden only by a thin scarf during the winter days- they weren't so risky during the warmer seasons. Harry had left Draco begging and moaning before, and Draco had scratched Harry's back as though he were a scratching post. They'd woken up together in the morning, cuddled up together, despite neither of them having any clothes on. They'd shown each other the most intimate things about each other, and practiced some truly intimate things together.
"What the actual hell?" asked Blaise with a disturbed look. "That's just sick. I'm gonna go hang out with Millie."
It was then Draco realized what needed to be done. Draco Malfoy neared his crush and wrapped his arms around him.
The salad was made beautifully, Harry realized with a hint of satisfaction. A raspberry colored dressing was drizzled neatly over the perfect colored lettuce. Sprinkled with a few croutons and little red cherry tomatoes, it looked appetizing, considering that Harry wasn't extremely hungry. Very few onions were sprinkled as well, adding a nice amount of crunch to the salad, along with a distinct taste that Harry appreciated.
And Draco laughed, while Lucius Malfoy began to scream at the top of his lungs about disgraceful sons and having that disgraceful son come and take him far from Azkaban.
How did one go about even commenting on that? Ah yes, you're right. Let's have some pastries and sip some honey tea while laughing about Potter's death. It was pointless to ponder over, but it caused Draco's mood to darken, like the sky did before a northern downpour appeared.
Instead, she wore a pair of black skinny jeans- she was allowed to, considering that it was the weekend, and one could wear whatever they desired on the weekend. A grey wool sweater with pink, yellow, and blue lines replaced the normally baggy shirts she wore. Harriet wasn't exactly very busty, but Draco did notice that she had nice thighs.
Draco's pale cheeks filled with a cherry red blush, his eyes widening slightly. "Potter..." Draco's voice wavered slightly, his cracking ever so lightly. "You didn't say no. Do... do you like me back or would you just want to be enemies with sexual benefits?"
His gaze moved to the sky, almost as if expecting to see his parents' Angels descend from the Heavens and give him some one-on-one. That would be very helpful, considering that they might have some sort of advice that would set Harry back on the right path. They could give him a goodnight kiss like he wished he received as a small child, before floating back towards the Heavens.
"Go away," snapped Draco irritably. He brushed her arm off, walking far away her. Draco just continued to walk far away, smiling as he did such.
It wasn't only because Draco had the largest crush on Potter; it was living, undeniable humanity and softness that flowed throughout Draco's mind like his blood did that caused that reaction. Draco might have pushed and shoved, but he never wanted things to go to the extent they did- before long, it was all unstoppable. It was like a snowball, with each little thing making the first problem this monster that no one wanted to face. And it was all too much for Draco to handle alone.
In the story, Romeo had noticed the beauty of the thirteen year old virgin and fallen into what he believed was love. And Juliet, the thirteen year old virgin, had returned feelings for Romeo which she proclaimed was love- perhaps it might have had something to do with the fact she didn't love Paris, the elderly suitor her mother picked out for her.
Harry had just recently began to home a fascination for Astronomy. Before, he could have cared less about the sky, the moon, the sun, or the different galaxies although. He just never really cared for the topic much, believing his time would be better spent practicing defensive spells or something equally as important- not something as useless as studying the stars.
"Come on Dray, you know you want to," said Pansy, barely managing not to slur that simple phrase. The rose pink dress that she wore clung to her skin, showing off her beautifully curved body. A pair of white gloves went to her elbows, giving her more of the princess look that she was originally hoping for. Her hair was neatly curled, going down to her shoulders. Her kissable lips were coated in a rosy pink lipstick, her eyeshadow nearly the same color.
Harriet Potter was simply stunning, her beauty enough to freeze him in his tracks. Her emerald green eyes, which were framed by black eyeliner, were the most beautiful shade of green that Draco had ever seen. She was cursed with the gift of curves, which wasn't at all the reason that Draco was simply intrigued by her- in love with her to be rather honest. Her tan skin glimmered with sweat, which wasn't surprising, considering the fact that she'd been dancing for over three hours roughly. A pitch black one-piece bodysuit was tightly fit to her frame, the same item she'd wear to the dance recital next Friday. Ebony black hair was pulled into a neat bun, a few strands out of place.
"Have either of you seen Draco?" Harry's appearance was a disaster. Ebony black hair stood in every direction, partially due to the harsh winds that caused his face to take on a pinkish hue. Smears of depressing grey, along with muddy browns, covered Harry's tan skin. His emerald green eyes looked distant, as if he was with Draco, wherever he was.
"Can I ask where you came up with the ideas for these names?" Draco gently rubbed Lucy's head from where she was in Harry's arms, which caused her tail to wag.
And so, Harry Potter, the eccedentesiast, gained someone he could trust with his pain- his future husband, Draco Malfoy.
Every date so far had been at Draco's place, well, mansion really. Wrought iron gates with the sprawling green grass made the place look so much more... luxurious. The beige siding had buckled on the side, due to the sun's heat- Draco was getting it fixed, but everyone was seemingly busy. The windows glistened under the sun's rays, making them look as though they were portal to another dimension. A rather simple crème white door with a wreath on it was the entrance to one of the simple most divine houses in the town.
“At least you didn’t have to sing,” Pansy groans. “I think “Black Socks” is permanently etched into my brain.” She takes the front seat, swinging her high-heeled feet up onto Blaise’s dash; determined to spend every last minute in her favorite shoes since she’s not allowed to wear them when campers are around.
“Pass me a cannoli, ‘Mione,” Harry said a minute later, “Since I had to share with this whiny mooch.” She passed him the biggest, freshest one, and he stuffed it into his mouth, eyes closing in delight.
They pass a creek and Draco mimes pushing Harry in. The next second, he’s unfortunate enough to trip over a branch and go sprawling in face first as Harry laughs himself into hysterics.
“Aren’t there other counselors back there too, sitting with them?” Draco asked, puzzled as to why he was being reprimanded.
“You heard me, out! Both of you,” she snapped, giving Percy a glare out of the corner of her eye. “You’re both guests in this house and instead of acting like the respectful, open-minded young men your father and I brought you up to be, you stand here insulting your best friend’s partner after he kindly apologized! Out, I tell you, out!”
Ceeley attempted a laugh that sounded more like a painful squeak. “Of course it’s not, Master Draco! Mistress Malfoy always said he’s quite the joker, he is.”
“Wake up, Potty!” There was a cackle, and he blearily opened his eyes to be met with the manically insane face of Bellatrix Lestrange. “Oh, yes,” she said reverently, drawing out the word. “My Lord will be incredibly happy to see you.” She reached toward Harry’s throat, fingers twitching as if imagining how he would look gasping for air…
“I know you said you wanted to love me tonight,” Draco said, pristinely pushing the hair back behind his ear as he hovered over Harry. “But there’s something I’ve wanted to try for a while now…I thought I might ride you?” His delicate cheeks flushed slightly with this declaration.
“Right,” said Harry noncommittedly. “I think I’ll take a leaf out of Malfoy’s book and grab a drink, then.”
Harry continued to stroke and comfort, waiting for Draco to calm down. Their silence went on, comfortable despite Harry’s clear unease, until he felt ready to speak. This was going to be painful, no matter how he tried to phrase it.
As much as Harry’d hated taking those photos, he couldn’t regret the experience in the slightest after seeing the photo splashed across the front cover: the one of Draco leaning against the side of his head in comfort as Harry fervently wished he could Apparate back to their flat and cuddle Draco.
This would have been the optimal time to ask his friends for advice about how to handle Draco. Scuffing his trainers against the cool stone floors, Harry reflected on what Ron and Hermione might have advised doing.
The flushed aficionado mutters a quick apology to Draco and scoots back into the group, almost camouflaging himself in the middle. Without so much as an untoward glance, Draco continues on with the lesson. He demonstrates efficient ways of moving one’s body, both reactions and response, in order to gain even more seconds on one’s opponent. From his knowledge of the Malfoy family, Harry expects Draco’s dueling style to be flowy and graceful, and though these motions are clipped, Draco dances with the ease Harry always imagined him having.
Whoever invented sleeping bags should be mercilessly tortured, Draco thinks, tossing and turning in his sleeping bag. The night is crisp and cool; having caused him to instantly freeze the moment he tried to shed the bloody bag fifteen minutes earlier. Only fools camp outside in the wilderness during the chilly spring months and Draco’s one of them. But not by his own merit. Having fulfilled the base requirements of his reparations to society, he was offered the choice of either spending a year on probation or volunteering at a resident camp for troubled youths. Had he known camp began in mid-May, not mid-June, Draco might have considered the year of probation.
“Let’s go,” Hermione said, strapping on her own gear after she finished changing. She snatched her Glock from under the front seat and got out of the car, slamming the door behind her.
“I’m just not sure it’s meant to be,” Draco said quietly. “Not that I’m qualified, by any means, to be giving relationship advice. Harry and I are as equally unlikely of a match.”
He hadn’t noticed the tears running down his face until one slipped into his mouth, prompting him to taste salt and fear. Of course he was a coward, but there was something to be said for embracing that which many spent their whole lives running from and refusing to acknowledge.
“That sucks,” said Draco, mimicking his roommate’s dialogue as he usually did in order to keep his sanity. Steve liked to imitate him as well, and had much less skill adopting accents than Draco did. “Hey, weren’t you going to help me do some shopping?”
Filled with a newfound sense of purpose, Harry flew back to Grimmauld Place, anxious to put his plans in motion. He touched down on the sidewalk outside, careful to check for muggles first, and strode in through the front door. Harry thought it best to pack up the essentials before sending out an owl to his friends, as he wouldn’t put it past them to Apparate or Floo over in a valiant attempt to stop him from leaving.
Suddenly unsure what to do or say to make Potter feel better, Draco watched uncomfortably as he struggled with his emotions. Remembering how Potter had comforted him in the past, Draco walked forward and laid a hand on his shoulder. He didn’t say anything; he didn’t need to say anything. After a moment, Potter sank down to the ground, leaning back against Gryffindor Tower.
“Rules are more like flexible guidelines,” said Malfoy dismissively. “We went through Knockturn Alley, which I know you’ve been to before, and you’ve also been in plenty of caves. I say that it counts.”
“But you do,” Harry broke in. “Some of our cohort were educated abroad and are really new to the school – you know the students, the culture; and you’re the top of the class. You deserved the appointment, Draco,” he said softly.
something that trumped blood: hate and bigotry. After what had happened to her daughter, son-in-law, and husband during the War, Draco could never expect forgiveness, let alone mercy.
“Why don’t you start taking this dirt out to the greenhouses?” said Harry. "I'm going to work on the walls."
Another urge was soundly overcoming his desire to sleep: his need for sexual gratification. Draco groaned; irrevocably, whenever he thought of Potter, his cock stiffened. It wasn’t right, getting all hot over speccy, knobbly-kneed gits, but Draco couldn’t safely say anything made much sense as of late.
“I should probably start preparing myself,” Draco said conversationally. He stood up, still fully dressed, and Vanished his own clothing, crossing over to his dresser drawer and pulling out a black butt plug.
“Of course you do,” Hermione murmured. There was a slight dip to the bed as she climbed in, demolishing the outer wall of his casing as she snuggled up behind him.
“Calm down,” smirked Zee. “We’re both in.” He shared a glance with Mike, and both of them firmly nodded.
There was only one person who would still be willing to insult him not even an hour after he’d defeated Lord Voldemort. Harry lifted his wand to confirm his suspicion and, unfortunately, was dead on. His nighttime visitor was Malfoy, as pale and pointed as ever, though even in the wandlight Harry could tell how emaciated his former rival really was.
“Look, Malfoy. We’re going to get food and then I have to find somewhere to live. If I can get all that done, then I’ll meet up with you this afternoon, alright?”
Practice ended with running and agility drills – Malfoy had refused to budge on agility, and Harry was equally unwilling to budge on running, so the team got stuck doing both sets of exercises.
“I’ve suffered much worse things in my life,” points out Harry. “I’ll be fine. Just take me home, Malfoy.”
Draco’s first week with the San Diego Youth Baseball/Softball Association (which everyone seemed to call Triple B, or ‘bring back the ball,’ for short) wasn’t an eventful one. Danny introduced him to other staff members that worked in “base,” or the organization headquarters, and helped Draco start researching possible Foundations to target. He was provided with past grant proposals that Triple B had submitted, and after only a few minutes of glancing over them, concluded that Triple B was in desperate need of his assistance. It was a good thing that Danny hired him.
He thinks he’ll go to work today. Working on Sunday has never bothered him before, and now it’s a welcome change from the thoughts circulating around in his head he isn’t compelled to address. Shrugging on a pair of jeans and a random shirt, he takes the train to the Leaky Cauldron, where he accesses the entrance to Diagon Alley. In the year after the War, he’d longed for a new project and so he started a membership based dueling club in the building adjacent to
“You – two – need – to – make up your minds,” panted Taryn after three laps around the outer bounds of the field and four times through the agility track Malfoy set up down all three baselines.
“This one’s not the perfect choice, but it’s a reasonable fit,” said Hermione, after they’d skimmed all four issues. “It deals with all facets of the Dark Arts--objects, spells and wand components, not only Potions.”
“See you tomorrow, Potter, at the usual o’800 hours," he said as he left the room, slipping back into using military time, which was both expected and required when in the employ of the Dark Lord. He did not look back at Potter, who was surely standing there with a bewildered look on his face. There were no words said to indicate otherwise, but at least to Draco, it felt like something had split between them.
“Hey!” George shouted indignantly. “That title’s already been claimed by Gred and Forge, thank you very much.”
In a manner of minutes, all of his most valuable possessions were packed. Hoping against hope that there were still establishments renting out rooms for the night, Draco summoned all of his magical strength and tore a hole in the Manor’s wards so that he could Apparate out. Even as he
There was an awkward silence, combined with the slight nausea Harry already felt from the tea. “Are we ready to get started?” Luna asked finally, dipping her finger into the Gurdyroot infusion and licking it.
Flushed and embarrassed, Draco was more than relieved when the archery director herded both groups of campers on the picnic benches and started lecturing about the rules for archery.
Draco continued to watch, fascinated, as another man stepped up to the rectangle-triangle and held up a bat. As soon as the man on the mound let go of the ball, the grumpy former batter leapt off the square and started running as fast as he could for the one directly behind the thrower. Before he could blink, the woman catching the ball behind the rectangle-triangle released the ball, just as fast, and the thrower ducked as the ball flew over his head. Suddenly, the grumpy batter was on the ground, and Nate shouted “Safe!”
“I don’t want to let my life be controlled by what happened,” Harry says determinedly. “Besides, I was planning to go to Malfoy that night anyway. I was going to try and make things right with him and then see if he’d somehow be willing to go on a date with me.”
relationship; we’ve danced around each other for years. Our spark had always been there, but was never able to actualize into a relationship until we were on the same side.”
All too soon, Luna swept back into the room, Levitating a tray with a bone white teapot and teacups with a matching sugar and cream set. “All set,” she said cheerfully, neatly setting the tray on the table in front of them. “Daddy’s added a new ingredient; it’s quite good now.”
As they walked down the rubbly corridor, Harry lightly said, “By the way, Malfoy, you’re doing all the heavy lifting today.”
that he almost didn’t notice the little note there at the bottom of the letter. The Weasel wanted to come to France too? That was definitely a wrinkle in the plans, especially if he went and made things more awkward than they were already going to be.
“You’ll never be anything near happy in the muggle world unless you can start putting that god-awful prejudice behind you.” Her tone turned condescending, “Your situation isn’t quite so dissimilar from a muggleborn witch or wizard’s…”
“We’ll see, Malfoy,” Potter said, eyes crinkling. Draco took a deep breath and prayed to whatever deity was listening for impeccable self-control at the pub tonight.
He can only sob and cling to her, desperately hoping for her to soothe him in the same way Malfoy had earlier. Eventually she stops asking questions, and Ron leaves the room to return with a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup. They say nothing, realizing that Harry won’t talk about what happened; can’t talk about what happened. He allows Hermione to give him some Dreamless Sleep Potion after Ron’s coaxed him to eat some soup, and lies down with relief to the thought of falling into nothingness.
He thought sometimes about becoming friends with Potter. But even if he made a move to, say, talk to Potter, there would be no possible chance of success because the Gryffindorks were always around. Instead of acting, Draco watched Potter return his cart, laughing loudly at something the Weasel said. He found himself unconsciously smiling, even though the sight of the Weasel was more than enough to make him retch.
“It would be so much bloody better to live over here too,” said Cale thoughtfully. “We play on the fields that are fifteen minutes away, and are going to be coaching on the ones ten minutes away in the opposite direction.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, rolling his eyes. “You were born ready. And if you’re going to throw your arm out if you pitch anymore tonight. Don’t think I didn’t watch you sneak away from practice earlier to get some time in with Nels.”
Harry bit back a remark about how that much was obvious and forced himself to accept the apology. “Don't be sorry,” he said, pulling Draco into his arms. “Just don’t do it again.”
Harry needn’t have worried. Malfoy immediately started shaking his hips, doing something vaguely related to the Twist as he snatched Harry’s hands and pulled him into the quick rhythm. He could only hope Chris and Cale were concentrating on their performance rather than on his and Malfoy’s as they whirled around the floor. Malfoy was tireless, it seemed, and had a particular affinity for disco. He would pull corny moves just to see Harry laugh, and then his own eyes would crinkle as he grinned back at Harry across the dance floor.
Steve found him that way when he returned five minutes later with a borrowed broom and dustpan. “Um, Draco?” he asked while hastily sweeping the ruined ornament into the dustpan. There was no response. Awkwardly, Steve shifted his weight from foot to foot, unwilling to simply leave Draco after such a fit. American sensibilities.
At least he would get a stimulating conversation out of visiting the professors, or so Draco thought. He penciled all the office hours into his calendar, and visited five different professors in four different days. On Monday, he found out that his Brit-Lit English professor was interested in Brit-Lit only, which did not parallel Draco’s research interests in the slightest. It was the same deal with his Digital Literature professor on Tuesday, but with one key difference: she scared the hell out of Draco. Apparently, students had never just done simple conversations before. On Wednesday, he was afraid to go and meet his Psychology professor, but in the end he had a very nice conversation with her about Freud and Psychoanalysis. Re-energized, Draco went into Thursday hoping to really hit it off with his Children’s Literature professor simply because he was so, so brilliant in class. However, Draco found him to be removed and distant, having been pushed out the door after only 15 minutes of conversation.
Harry looked relieved. “Good. I totally had this plan, then you were naked and warm in my arms, and….”

Draco guided his mother to the loveseat and sat next to her, holding the hand that wasn’t dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief.
Harry stood there awkwardly for a long moment, while Draco did the same. The silence stretched between them like taffy, and Draco willed himself to come up with a sensible, intelligent, polite way to ask for the damn blueberry muffin. Or a kiss. No, scratch that, that was insane. Just the muffin. He just wanted the muffin.

"Really? I totally thought you knew French," Harry said, and drank more Rosé. He was starting to lose his filters. Normally he would never have suggested that he thought (knew) Malfoy was posher than him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Master Harry!" Dudders said, bouncing a bit on the balls of his feet and looking like he wanted to pirouette, or at least bounce higher. "Master Harry, Kreacher he has founds it! He has found the magic Master Harry requested us to finds! Founds it in the Black family library he did! Just as you hoped us would!"
“With what, then?” Draco said, amused. “Whatever do I deserve to be punished for, then? I am simply desperate to know, darling.”
"I'd really rather drive still, if you wouldn't mind too much." Harry turned to look at Draco, but he couldn't discern what the look on the other boy's face meant. "You could, er, join me though? I'd be glad of the company."
Harry smiled, and it was as though the room warmed by several degrees. Draco felt a knot he hadn’t even been aware of loosen in between his shoulders, and he smiled shyly in return. Then, flustered, he jumped up from his couch, nearly sat down again, stumbled slightly, and then rushed into the kitchen. “Sit! You should have a seat! Can I get you something to drink?”
“Oh?” Malfoy cooed, one finger still teasing at his growing bulge. He’d still not pulled down that damn zip.
“I think I’ve realized something though,” Harry said, still looking out the window into the darkening evening.
Malfoy finally pushed his cock the rest of the way into Harry. He panted whispers into Harry's ear. "Oh fuck… I've dreamed of this, I've dreamed of you…"
“Justice Department ruled Aurors can question Matthew Rosscot under Veritaserum, long as his own Litigator’s present.”
“I know,” Harry answered, his own cheeks flushing. “But HillSide has everything I need. In a house, I mean. Including my staunchest wards.”
. Like he could possibly distrust Harry Potter, the war hero who had saved his life and gotten him his job. His massive crush on Potter was just a bonus. “All right,” he said, putting the pitcher down at the very edge of the worktop without really noticing. “I, all right.” Harry smiled at him and Draco felt his cheeks ice over and his scalp heat to burning.
It felt very, very good. Emboldened, Harry went to explore the rest of Malfoy's mouth. His hands tightened in Malfoy's clothes as they gently teased one another's tongues, palates, lips.
“No one will think you are a virgin tomorrow,” Harry said. He finished his cider and reached into the basket for a scone. “And if it gets serious with Hannah, you can tell her the truth when you two know each other well, when you know she won’t make fun of you.”

“It can be fun,” Harry said, rubbing a small circle into Draco’s skin and still, somehow, maddeningly, avoiding Draco’s leaking cock.
"Lube up your cock with what's left," Draco instructed, and once Harry had, Draco slowly worked his insanely tight arsehole down over Harry's screaming hard dick.
"Okay," Malfoy said. He started the submarine up again and began driving forward carefully. Harry dropped a book on the floor and cursed, but Malfoy kept his eyes forward even though they were going really slowly and the lakebed was empty here.
"Dudders," Harry said slowly. "These colours are shit. Can you turn the black leather more… I don't know… blonde?"
“Pansy,” Draco said, feeling slightly helpless despite his crown, which seemed to have gone somewhat crooked, “I wonder if I could trouble you to go on to breakfast without me.”
“Fuck me,” Draco whispered, feeling stunned as Harry completely overpowered him – without a whisper of magic. Or skin contact.
"But, Sir…" Harry tried. For once Robards didn't interrupt. Harry paused, waiting for it. When the flow of discouragement didn't return, Harry found he had no idea what he wanted to say.

He explored the French countryside, planned Ron and Hermione’s visits, and continually promised himself that “next weekend” he would head into gayest Bayonne and try to meet a nice young Frenchman.
“Jesus. Yes,” Harry whined. This was a terrible idea. He’d be ruined when this was done. Raided. Sacked.
"Would you like to try as well?" Malfoy said to Harry generously, and Harry found himself yet again thrown off by a Malfoy who was thoughtful now.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
Harry felt heat expand uncomfortably on his cheeks, hardly believing he'd confessed such things to Draco. He'd not said half this stuff out loud to Ron! Of course, he knew Ron already knew all of it. He was there right next to Harry, getting drunk along with him and their older, wiser, grizzled partners every night. The difference was that Ron had no trouble at all following the rules. Neither did Neville. They were at the bar with him because they had no one to go home to. For them, work was everything, and hanging out with Harry was both a pleasure and -- perhaps, Harry hated to think it but he was pretty sure it was true -- a duty.
“Don’t look so surprised.” Narcissa softened her tease with a warm smile. “I love babies. And if Draco is homosexual, Teddy may be the closest thing I have to a grandchild for a long time indeed.”
“Of course,” Harry said, calming himself. Malfoy wasn’t bothered by the common food? The childish plates? Harry smiled, turned and took the three steps to the table. Then he picked up his fork and winked at Teddy. He could do this if Malfoy could.
, blood connection be damned. How was he meant to respond to someone foolish enough to believe that? He cautiously rolled her words around in his mind, sipped tea, then looked at her again.
He didn’t quite find it, but he strode out the door anyway and high tailed it back to his dorm room, where he went to bed. Eight in the evening wasn’t that early.
"The whole procedure needs to be done while you are fucking him, Sir. We'll place a blurring charm on you, so I can't see your penis. All my clients ask for it."
Draco sat at the foot of the bed and removed his socks. Then he fussed with them for a moment, pressing out the wrinkles with his fingers. He balled them up once, then undid it and redid it again, more to his satisfaction this time.
Harry opened his mouth, but Draco shook his head. Harry wasn’t trying to speak, though. Draco quickly realized Harry was just… gobsmacked.
for. I want a relationship with you. A romance. Something meaningful and real. I consider you my friend, a hero, and also a worthy partner.
Draco smiled despite himself. “He’s pretty brilliant,” he admitted. “I didn’t even know I liked babies.”
Draco looked up, eyes darkening to silver. “You have definitely,” he rumbled, “earned one hell of a shag. Bedroom?”

“Harry is handsome, generous, intelligent, kind, and funny. He treats me with respect, yet does not take either of us too seriously. He loves his work, which he chose for himself and pursued diligently. He knows how to be happy.”
“Lovely,” Malfoy agreed, as though chatting had actually been Harry’s idea. “I’d enjoy that.” His smile had too many teeth.

He didn’t know a spell to fix it, so he added a bit more salt and choked down the overly-sweet oats with a cup of overly strong tea. He’d hoped stronger tea would help him deal with the half-ruined porridge, but it didn’t work very well.
misunderstand loyalty that badly, wouldn’t you, Smith?” Harry said, pretending a conversational tone.
Harry gestured to her to sit, and between bites the boys caught her up on what had happened in the Lake.
Harry rocked back on Draco’s cock; then shuddered, Draco deep inside. "What I wanted before,” he finally answered. “All over your abs while you pound me incoherent. Just… not yet?”
Harry sat down on his bed, hard and fast and even a little uncoordinated. He was staring at Draco, but he didn’t look besotted this time, or turned on. He looked… (if Draco was being honest with himself — something he was getting better and better at with all this damn practice) Harry looked supremely confused. Worse, he also looked a little disappointed.
“Ah,” Draco says, smiling now. “You underestimate the lure of shockingly fit men wearing skintight costumes. Pansy generally sits there working hard to keep herself from rushing the stage and climbing the lead man like a tree.”
“Glad you like it,” Harry said, crunching through toast covered with eggs. “But how do you want to approach your mother with our news?”

Harry realized his palms were a bit damp. He put them on his thighs and discreetly pressed them into the wool.
Draco had no intention of letting go of this man until he knew for certain what the hell was going on.
Underneath Harry, Malfoy moaned and bucked. His hands stroked Harry's back and then Harry's arse. Harry could feel both of their cocks begin to firm up again as they pushed through the slick, hot mess of come between them. It felt brilliant, but after a few minutes, Harry again found himself eager to take things to a higher level. He blushed a bit as he took his mouth from Malfoy's mouth and spoke quietly into Malfoy's pale shoulder.
“I hope this only ranks as a small inconvenience,” Harry murmured, leading Draco toward his guest bedroom. “We do have to share the bathroom. This place doesn’t really have a singular master bedroom, but I just… love the location,” he trailed off, blushing. Apparently embarrassed?
Harry realized he wanted more. He slid both hands free from Malfoy's dressing gown and tried to put his hands on Malfoy's arse. When he found it, it was covered with bunches of fabric from Malfoy's pyjamas and dressing gown. He started trying to move the fabric out of the way to get a good grip on Malfoy's arse, and Malfoy started to moan and press his hips into Harry's.
“One of the worst things about choosing to marry your father,” Mother said quietly, “or so I thought at sixteen, when his parents sat me down with my father to explain the requirements involved in accepting Lucius’ proposal, was Malfoy men only want one child. One
“It was,” she agreed, “but I fear I left my favourite biscuit platter behind. I need you to fetch it for me.”
Having Harry’s hands on his arse changed everything. Draco lost all self control, all inhibitions, and he reached for Harry’s flies and tried to wrench them open. Harry looked stunned for a moment, then began to help. Soon their cocks were both out and Draco couldn’t possibly know whether it was better to get an eyeful or a handful.
last night's mistakes. They weren't friends! Harry squirmed in his chair as he considered that. Were they friends now? That would be weird. Sure, but this entire situation was weird, he realized again.

"My father was homosexual, Harry. Homosexual and filled with self-loathing. Like father like son, hmm?"
They also helped explain why having Harry underneath him had Draco fighting to stay present. He didn’t want to get lost in some romantic fantasy. He needed to keep his mind right here, right now. Even if only to give Harry the best fuck Draco had to give.
"Almost twenty years ago," Malfoy continued, looking directly at the Merchieftainess, "a foolish young Hogwarts boy threw a trinket into your lake. A ring, specifically. He had prepared it as a gift for a pretty girl; my companion's mother, as it happens," he gestured vaguely toward Harry but continued to look at the Merchieftainess, "but she refused him. Angry, he threw the ring in your lake. Unfortunately, he died in the war we've just had aboveground. A war that was ended, and won, not coincidentally, by my companion."

that the Wizengamot and wizarding world hereby discharge our debt to open our collective mouths and legs to Mr Potter and take him as we, grateful cowards that we are, deserve.
Shaking his head at his own overactive, lonely mind, Draco stepped into his tiny beige sitting room. He looked around at his little flat. The flat opened directly into the sitting room with no hall in between, and the sitting room was right next to the small open kitchen. One knew which was which by the change in flooring. He had a couch against the wall and a desk by the one window.
Draco took an unusually quick shower, as – while he usually liked showering – today doing it by himself filled him with an inexplicable loneliness. (
Harry fell asleep with his flaccid cock nestled in between Hole's arse cheeks. Mouth's lush tits were slowly caressing his back, and her fingers were running slowly through his hair.
Harry stared in red-faced horror as the elder spoke, no blush on her cheeks, no hesitation in her voice, no sign of understanding how intensely, invasively wrong every syllable out of her mouth was.
But logic could only hold out against insecurity for so long, and Draco found himself paralyzed, temporarily locked into a room by his fear of somehow accidentally destroying this new, valuable, familial connection.

“Yes.” Draco spoke as firmly as possible. He knew there was a wobble in his voice, but Harry still looked at least slightly reassured by his answer. Draco tried again. “Yes, it is okay that this is a date. It is more than okay. I’d…” he hesitated out of sheer shock, the distraction that automatically arrived with so much astonished wonder, then forced himself to finish the sentence. “I’d like it to be a date. Very much.”

Potter put the box on the table and opened it, too. It held two enormous, oversized muffins; one dotted with blueberries, the other cranberries. Both sparkled with fat sugar crystals. “Were you brewing potions?” he asked in a polite tone. “I should have owled ahead. I just….”
Draco approves. A Guard is not generally encouraged to flirt with his Lord, but after Draco praised him so, well… it seems appropriate at this particular moment.
"About sunrise, I'd guess," Malfoy said. "France is really big. We spend the whole night travelling through France. Didn't you look at the map in your ticket?"
“Fucking me means kissing me, Malfoy,” Harry insisted vindictively. He paused. “I’ll make you a deal. After we fuck, get hard again. I’ll let you come in my mouth. After that I won’t expect another kiss. Not until you come back again, looking for another fuck.”
,” Harry moaned, and sixty-nining it was. He couldn’t seem to open his mouth to properly offer up his virgin arse, and heaven only knew why, but he could at least offer up his mouth to get fucked, to suck down come, to give Harry pleasure. Even if Harry was giving him pleasure at the same time, which might not fit the order of things, but weirdly seemed to please Harry, nonetheless.
Finally, Harry was done with studying the paperwork. He could have learned more, but he no longer cared. He'd been a virgin far too long. "May I have your office for a bit?" he requested.
“So what I’m trying to say,” Harry said, still very quiet, still holding Draco close, “is I’ve had a bit of practice with ignoring popular opinion in order to make my own choices, live my best life.”
So, Malfoy was acting like a friend, and Harry? What was Harry acting like? A poofter. When the hell had he become a pervert? He'd loved Ginny. He'd wanted Cho. Those things he was sure of. Of course, he'd never tried to do more than kiss Ginny, even when she'd dropped little hints that she was open to a bit more. He'd told himself that he respected her too much to take off her top, and what if Molly or Arthur found out? But he knew that Ron respected Hermione more than anyone on earth and had been trying to get Hermione's shirt off for a few years now. And succeeding for a while, too.
“Not exactly surprising, no,” he said, and toyed a bit with Harry’s belt. He could seduce Harry now, he thought, but that would be changing the subject, and he wasn’t quite ready for that, yet.

“You would’ve flown off the handle at her?” Harry said. They both knew he held back disapproval. Harry still wore his emotions all over his face.
Potter dropped his dressing gown on the tiled floor and grinned. Underneath he was completely nude and not completely flaccid. He jumped into the bath, strode over to Draco, and pressed up against him.
Harry gave Draco a sad smile. “Which means my happiness doesn’t have to take a back seat to the manipulations and interferences of fans and the press. I doubt you can know how much that means to me. Men usually panic and run when they realize what dating me is actually going to mean for them in public.

“I thought it might,” Narcissa said. “Draco came to me, so nervous, after they kissed. He seemed to fear my disapproval, though of course I had none.”

“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. “I guess… that makes sense. Then, yes, Hermione, I am happy with Harry. Remarkably so.” He ducked his head and smiled at the blanket, embarrassed to show so much emotion in public.
Draco lifted his head to look him in the eye. “Harry,” he said, and caressed Harry’s cheek. “I am incredibly happy. My life is so much better with you in it. I hope this lasts forever.”
,” Draco stagewhispered melodramatically. He threw back a large swallow, then threw himself onto Harry’s chesterfield. Harry leaned forward and waited.
Draco took the ring from his pocket, and — uncertain if it was wiser to do this or to trust — Harry cast a protection charm over it surreptitiously. Draco might have noticed and hid his reaction, but — perhaps as they were non magic users, neither the King nor any of his guard seemed to notice Harry's magic at all. Encouraged, Harry cast another spell on the ring before it left Draco's hand. He thought for sure this time the coloured light traveling from his hand to the ring would gain someone's attention, but no one said anything, and he tried to relax.
“She reads the whole thing for me every day,” Draco said, surprised. “So I don’t have to.” He looked away to finish the thought. “One mustn’t abandon the world completely, even when it has abandoned you.”
“Back and forth,” Harry said, striving for a light tone. To his dismay, Draco stuck out his tongue, then swayed both that, and his arse, back and forth along with the movements of their left hands over the knife.

He didn’t usually indulge so fully when the sun was up, but — checking the time — he saw that he had not been wrong about having the time for a thorough wank. He went languidly through the motions of cleaning his skin and his dildo. He stripped the extra blanket off the bed and put it in the laundry hamper. He put his toys away and stretched luxuriously, then dressed.
"Well, perhaps," he leaned over and took the slightly squashed ring off the table, "Harry could accept it in her place? But I think it has to be formally offered to him."
“Seeing” Neville turned out to be surprisingly nice. Harry wondered through most of Thursday and all of Friday why on earth he’d never thought to ask Neville out before. Neville was funny. Neville was smart. Neville was unpretentious. But he wasn’t so humble that Harry felt pressure to constantly reassure him, which would have been annoying.

“Yes, your Majesty!” Draco agreed happily, shoving the dildo in farther and feeling pre-come spurt generously from his slit in response. “I love pleasing your massive royal dick.”
“So we both want… casual?” Draco said. He looked at their touching knees and wondered which connotation Harry would assume.
"Wait," Harry said, confused. "That's not what they said at your father's trial. When they heard all that evidence that made them decide not to try your mother, and to just put you on probation this year and not bother with a trial at all."

“It’s definitely good,” Draco said, and he moved to kiss his boyfriend, then moved away just enough to grab the lube from his bedside table. “Now, please put some of this on this finger, here.” He showed Harry what he wanted.
And Draco was talking. Something about his son. Scorpius was the same age as Pandora, maybe they would be friends at Hogwarts? Maybe they should get the children together, maybe the adults, too.
Draco would have liked to snap a response at her, but he was too smart to indulge in such immaturity. Instead, eyes down and mouth shut, he entered Potter’s office and slipped around the door, pressing it closed with his backside. Then he went to his knees and shuffled over to Potter, who was turned away, staring out the magical window.
“Now, I am uncertain between right and wrong. I suspect, however, things are far more complex than I was told. I’ve much to consider.”
