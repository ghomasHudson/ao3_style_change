“I’ve been a few times, but I’m certainly no expert. Feel free to leave me in the dust if I’m slowing us down,” he said with his familiar self-effacing grin. “Malfoy,” he said, turning to Draco and extending a hand.
“We’re taking them on buses?” asked Draco incredulously. Of all the daft ideas, this had to be the worst.
. His eyes flicked up to meet Harry’s, and he half smiled in amusement. Malfoy had come under the pretence of helping transport Harry through the castle safely, but Harry was still wary following Hermione’s advice about Slytherins.
“It’s a chance anyway,” said Harry, smiling in reassurance.
Draco nodded, crossing to the couch next to Luna and sinking into a seat. Luna turned to look at him, straightening her strange glasses. Ivy poked her head up too and began slithering in Draco’s direction until Luna placed her on his lap.
“I thought you were going to teach me how to fight,” said Harry, his frustration building as he pictured Charlotte in danger and his wand sending out a pitiful stream of fireworks that fizzled to the ground.
Step one, squash the old family grievances with Edgar and get his blessing on the match, even if it meant aligning his political beliefs to some kind of muggle equality stance. Step two, do whatever he needed to do to convince Angelica of his undying love and get her to accept his proposal. Step three, enter the marriage and resolve the family’s financial pressures, a few of which were becoming increasingly problematic. Step four — well, that was it really. He’d been so focused on getting to the point of retribution that he hadn’t thought much further past step three.
convenient,” said Hermione, crossing to the other side of the room to glare down at Draco. “I always knew the Malfoys were dark aligned, but I’m starting to think that it didn’t die off after the first war like your parents were so keen to make the
“But even if we knew what it was and how he made them, it doesn’t help us find them,” said Hermione.
“Wait wait wait, my good sir!” said the bard, leaping into a painting of a pastoral scene to catch Draco’s eye before he was out of sight. “Can’t you recall the many nights we sought the muse together? I have been eager to regale you with the finished product. It is, I believe, a sentiment you too will understand.”
For a moment, Harry stopped resisting. He could no longer deny that this person, whoever he was, was real. And if that were the case, then the deaths he had seen, those too had happened. A creeping fear settled itself in his mind.
“Step,” said Draco, pushing himself up.
“Curious,” said Ollivander, whose eyes were twinkling. “It seems your last wand may have been a miss-fit from the start. Let’s try something else, shall we?”
“That’s brilliant, thanks Hermione,” said Harry, cracking the book open to a chapter titled Interrogation, Lies, and Deceit.
“You deserve to know.”
“I’ve been wondering for a while now,” said Harry, as one of his knights lumbered to the centre of the board. “About the person who gave me this chess set.”
“What about Harry’s reading?”
“Oh. Right. The snake,” said Draco, reaching up to unwind the creature. He stared briefly at her small black eyes, hoping she couldn’t sense the conflict within him, before handing her back across the coffee table.
“Jeez Louise, you cut right to the chase, don’t you?” she said with a smile, the girlish timbre leaving her voice suddenly. She ran a hand slowly through her ponytail and regarded him with an intrigued expression. “That’s what father said about you too.”
“Gives a whole new meaning to the term water hazard,” said Draco, regaining his composure and putting on his best “ideal future son” demeanour.
“Harry you can’t, you’ll be playing into his hand,” said Hermione, standing defiantly as well.
“I find the portraits are more interesting to converse with. Ghosts are always repeating themselves,” said Luna, softening her paper ball. “I’m writing a sonnet with one of the portraits on the ground floor, you know. About a Thestral and a unicorn.”
“Yes, I think that most people in our world would recognise him,” said Draco, surprised to hear his voice waver slightly. “That is Albus Dumbledore.”
“Well, I just thought, how could I miss an opportunity to face off with my old Quidditch rival, you know?” Harry replied with a glint in his eye. Draco dropped his hand.
“What would you suggest?” he asked, looking around to make sure no one heard him asking Hermione Granger for help.
The fire roared up once more and a tall black boy – the one who helped Draco after his marking ceremony, Harry realised with a start – ducked out of the marble fireplace, joining the other Slytherins. Pansy smiled slyly and Theo punched him on the arm. A pretty brunette with a yellow emblem on her robes let out a little noise of excitement and ran to him, throwing her arms around his neck in a kiss.
He started trying to mouth Harry’s name, but Fidelius kicked in, coming in almost as strong as the
“There is good in him,” she said, so quietly that no one could hear but Harry.
“I can’t believe you talked me into this,” said Malfoy as he, Hermione, Luna, and an invisible Harry trudged down to Hogsmeade with the rest of the Hogwarts students on a brisk Saturday morning.
“It’s about something you mentioned at Hogwarts when you fitted me with my wand,” said Harry, deciding that he better just come right out and say it. Ollivander might be their only chance after all. “You said the phoenix who gave the feather for my wand gave one other feather. To Lord Voldemort.”
“You have to say that because you’re already losing,” she said playfully, knocking into him. He snaked his arm around her waist and gave her a quick squeeze.
“Remember what you agreed, if your scar starts hurting even a little bit we are turning right around,” said Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
“Nothing to speculate. I’ve gotten a room for myself and my future bride to be,” said Draco with a meaningful look through his smile. He knew they were only joking, but it was the one secret that still had the potential to undo the match, so it was not to be messed around with.
Luna gasped. “Who’s that?”
The conversation shifted to the others telling stories that were quintessential representations of their house, and ultimately devolving into highlights from their time at Hogwarts. Cedric told of the harrowing challenges of winning the Triwizard Tournament, which had all of them on the edge of their seats. Even the other three, who had witnessed the events themselves, had never heard the entire story of the mermaids of the black lake or the dangers of the maze.
“You were hit with a necrosis curse,” she explained. “It’s a lucky thing Cedric found you in time or you might have lost the leg.”
She straightened her glasses on the edge of her nose, cleared her throat and started in on a line of questions as directly and succinctly as possible. She managed to get a few key answers out of him:
“Wait, Granger,” said Draco, running a few paces to get in front of her. “Sorry, that came out wrong. I’m just exhausted from staying up late and there are a lot of pressures in my life you don’t know about.”
He collapsed on his back, looking up at the green shape in the sky, knowing that Voldemort saw it too. As an oppressive cloud of pain overtook him, Harry thought he saw red streaks of magic flying over him. The last thing he heard before he succumbed to the darkness was
He transfigured his Auror robes into a bright blue windbreaker tracksuit and put his hands on his hips, sending the other three into hysterics. Hermione laughed so hard she nearly fell off the edge of the sofa.
Draco’s hands tightened on the wooden arms of the chair. He was well acquainted with this story. In the past seven years since the Dark Lord’s early return, when he was nothing but a misty shroud, he had been whispering conspiracies that the Potter boy had lived. That he could feel the connection, even see through his eyes. But no, everyone knew that was just paranoia.
“Wouldn’t hurt to look, I suppose,” said Hermione. “Meanwhile, we should probably get you started on Vanishing Spells. Luna, are you adding books to the pile?”
Draco once again found himself in the cupboard under the stairs. He scanned the room, determining which token he wanted to use that could link him back to the earliest memories they had encountered so far. He reached for the seashell, but Harry’s eyes darted into the far corner of the space, where the stairs met the floor.
” called Draco, a jet of light blasting down the corridor.
“No teachers,” said Harry. “We’re on our own for this. There’s no way they’ll sanction you guys helping me on what they’re sure to see as an impossible task.”
“We’re leaving, Professor,” said Harry. “The others have taught me so much, and I could never thank you enough for what you’ve done for me. But if we don’t go now, I’m not sure we’ll have another chance. We’ve gotten this far on our own, we just need the Pensieve for the final memories.”
The Dark Lord raised his wand and shot a green jet of light at Harry, but before he could even think of a spell to counter, his wand reacted of its own accord, sending a bolt of golden light erupting from the tip like Harry had never seen.
Slivers of ghostly wisps rose like vapours from the sack that burned at his feet, stretching into gaping, tortured faces before disappearing into the air. Voldemort screamed in agony as pieces of his very soul died before him.
“Can’t you tell what kind of spell? Or who cast it?” asked Draco, growing annoyed.
“And I’m a Gryffindor,” said Hermione, beaming. “Honest, brave, practical. Many would say we’re the best house. Your parents were in Gryffindor.”
“Of course,” she said, gesturing to her end table where a large wrought iron key to the Gringotts vaults lay in a drawer, folded in a handkerchief. “And I must tell you – the Dark Lord is planning the attack on Azkaban before spring. If he frees Bellatrix, there will be no stopping him, so you must move quickly.”
“Just sit,” she said, patting the edge of the bed gingerly. “I’ll tell you.”
“She was right,” said Harry, closing the gap between them, and dragging the backpack full of Horcruxes with him. “You’re dying.”
“Oh, you can drop the act, babe,” said Angelica with an eye roll. “We’ve been dancing around this thing long enough. I’m ready to come clean.”
Harry jumped at the thunderous knock on the door, and took small satisfaction from seeing Snape do the same. He marched to the door, hoping to Merlin it wasn’t another student with a singed body part, and wrenched it open.
The entertainment value alone had almost made it worth the lack of sleep he got as a result.
Harry, momentarily frozen, heard the memory of the taunting voice of Malfoy saying
Harry spent his last week at the castle quietly simmering over the news of his parents’ death. Once he’d gotten back to his room after the night in the forest with Luna, he’d taken another look through the history books Hermione had brought him, but none of them covered much past the early 1900s. When he asked her for more recent history, she forgot what she was doing and vanished a matchbox completely instead of turning it into a mouse.
Harry tried to distract himself by packing up while he waited for the others to return, but a stomach-twisting feeling every time he thought about Malfoy’s bloody arm kept him from being very productive. Even Ivy seemed to sense that something was off, and she remained silently curled up in the pocket of his jumper while he stomped around, shifting piles of books and parchment aimlessly.
“Alright, follow the map and I’ll be right behind you,” said Tonks, holding off on mounting her own Thestral till the others were in the air. “If we get separated, just carry on straight until you reach the safe zone. Moody will know what to do if anything out of the ordinary happens. Just remember, the most important thing is getting these people to safety.”
He could take a few moments to show Harry what he needed to know, he told himself. He’d be taking advantage of an opportunity to build some real trust. After all, he was trying to have Harry believe they were friends wasn’t he? Matter of fact, he was doing such a good job of it that he’d momentarily convinced himself of it.
“Then it is,” said Harry, pulling him into another kiss.
“Fair,” she said at last. “And while we’re on the topic of unsolicited advice, maybe the reason you’re struggling with Occlusion is that he doesn’t trust you all that much either. Have you tried relating to him at all or are you just watching him bare his memories to you from up there on that pedestal?”

“He was a mentor to me. And a disciplinarian, and a demigod all rolled into one. There was a time I thought all I wanted in the world was to be chosen by him because he was the only true source of power,” Draco paused, unsure whether to go on, but Harry was still, watching him and he could hear his steady breathing in the dark room. “I would have done anything.”
This was true. They had been appalled to read the headlines when the Wizengamot decided to keep Fudge in the Minister for Magic position, and even more shocked when it became clear he would not be removing Umbridge or any of his cabinet from office. She and the staggeringly high number ministry officials who claimed to have been under Imperius Curses were all reinstated with little fuss.
Umbridge had effectively shelved Cedric’s reports, saying how useless he was and turning her attention to other things. She’d been busy contacting the surviving victims of some of Dumbledore’s old mistakes, like parents whose children had been injured on school grounds or old scholarly rivals, in an attempt to amass criminal charges against him.
“It’s what he believed would happen,” said Snape, struggling to disguise an incredulous smirk.
“I’d wager,” Hermione continued, a dangerous glint in her eye. “That you’d be happy to see the ‘Dark Lord’ return to power, wouldn’t you? Who cares who dies as long as the pure-bloods get their way.”
Harry was not alright. Now that he thought of it, Malfoy was the only one who knew that he’d be at the train station. Could it be that his best friend in the castle had sold him out?
“It’s you.”
Snape placed his box of unsorted ingredients down on a shelf and turned away from Draco, his long black robes trailing him back to his desk. “Have you tried the deep recollection work we attempted last year?” he asked.
“See Harry,” interrupted Hermione, “remember when you never thought you’d use a switching spell?”
“Prefects too. Everyone is to head straight to the dining area where we can keep an eye on you. Now come with me.”
“That was faster than I thought,” he joked, pulling up the left sleeve of his jumper where the Dark Mark stuck out in stark contrast against his pale skin – black ringed in a deep, burning red like it was branding its way deeper as it called to him.
He tried to force his concern for Harry and the rest of the group out of his mind, and found himself wondering about Tonks instead.
“You probably don’t want to hear this, but you’re not friends with Malfoy here,” said Hermione. “In fact you completely despise him. You’ve been at each other for years, he’s always been awful to you. Starting rumours, playing dirty. And he’s done a lot worse than that.”
In a blink, the contemplative expression was gone, replaced by a familiar know-it-all smirk that Harry hadn’t been able to get out of his mind since the first day he walked into the Room of Requirement. Back then he had taken it to be a sign of arrogance, but today he saw it for what it was – a brave cover for a very dark turmoil that Draco was battling within himself.
Draco sighed in annoyance and glanced out to the pitch before striding around to take a seat in the armchair across from Luna. Harry followed, sitting in the chair opposite as they usually did for their Occlumency sessions.
“What did they do to you?” she asked, masking her emotion one way or another.
“I am both fascinated and appalled that I understood everything you just said,” muttered Draco.
No, the third surprising thing was a kiss.
“Sorry,” said Harry, who couldn’t help but grin as Draco said
Borgin looked disappointed at this but hastened to clear the cogs and bits of spring from the worktable as Draco laid down the bundle. Borgin cast a quick diagnostic charm on the parcel before touching it, and a dark green glow emanated from within.
Behind her, four Aurors in crisp uniforms followed in, fanning out in the room and turning the place upside down, rifling through drawers and sending papers and books flying as they searched for something.
“Who?” asked Harry
“Who knows?” said Draco flippantly. If he were famous, he’d probably pick a pretty but silent one too.
“Oh, Harry, how dreadful,” said Luna. “I can tell you everything I know about it if you want. But you can ask anyone – if people knew you were alive, you’d be famous in our world.”
“Oh,” said the man, eyeing Draco’s badge. “Right, well. Carry on quickly then.” And he turned and left, back up the stairs.
“Practice my arse,” said Pansy when they were safely out of earshot.
“You’re different,” said Draco, a funny look spreading across his face – as though he were trying to figure out what it was about Harry that made him all that different.
“You’re off to practise?” asked Pansy, her eyes darting between the two. “Well actually, I can just ask my question in class, Professor. I’m happy to walk you to the pitch, Draco.”
“Thank you, my Lord.” Draco smiled at the honour as Yaxley slapped him on the shoulder. Only one more night of playing into this farce and he’d be back to Hogwarts where he was meant to be. Back with Harry.
“Gemma? Come on, she’s good value” said Harry, nudging Draco with his elbow.
“Malfoy?” snapped Voldemort, dropping all pretence. A masked Death Eater in the shadows to his right went rigid. “What about him?”
“I see,” said Draco, trying to maintain an even cadence to his voice despite the deep fears awakening within him as he made the long walk down to the Manor library. “What does our master ask of me?”
“Not after what I saw at the train station, that’s for damn sure,” said Cedric with an approving slap on the back.
It was surprising, then, when Draco found himself outside of a cheery, red brick muggle office building with a swinging sign that read Greenacre Capital. And then below it in a smaller font, Mr Lawrence Greenacre, Private Equity. Draco entered through the narrow door and found himself in short order across the desk from Mr Greenacre. A tall, well-dressed man with a straight nose and a salt and pepper beard.
“There’s nowhere with class in Hogsmeade,” said Pansy, dragging the magazine back towards her. “Besides, I think it’s romantic. You do want to take me somewhere romantic, don’t you?”
“We better go,” said Hermione, grabbing Harry by the elbow and steering him towards the door.
“I don’t know. He doesn’t even seem to know we have them. He hasn’t been angry lately or I think I would feel it,” said Harry.
“Oh. You can’t see her,” said Luna forlornly. “That’s a shame, she’s really quite beautiful. Here, give me your hand.”
“We can’t wait for help to come bail us out,” said Harry. “We need to make a stand. It’s time to start planning how we find Voldemort.”
“That’s what I thought,” said Angelica, tossing her head and beckoning him close.
Well, this had certainly not been how he was expecting his first meeting with the legendary boy to go. He’d have to see what Snape knew of the matter. He turned on his heel and headed for the dungeon.
“I can see that,” said DuPont, stepping closer and putting a meaty hand on Draco’s shoulder. “And I’m sorry to be the one to break it to you, but the good news is it’s behind us now. I can see you’re not the same man your father was, and I’m willing to let bygones be bygones. Besides, I hate to say it, but he came out far worse than I did.”
But before he could respond, DuPont continued, “You know, for someone who carried around a cane all the time, you’d think he would have been be a little better with a club.”
He quickly ran a hand through his hair to smooth it and took off in the opposite direction from Harry. Making his way back to the table, he found there was no one there, but spotted Pansy and the others on the dance floor and pushed his way through to her. He told her where he was going over the deafening sound of the music and her face lit up as she flung her arms around his neck. She nodded that she would take care of Angelica, and he could feel himself beaming as he stepped back out of the crowd.
“You wouldn’t make a bad Auror yourself, Granger,” said Cedric, turning to regard Hermione with an appreciative nod.
Draco’s eyes flicked to Snape, who had a faraway look as though he imagined he were somewhere else. McGonagall leaned closer, her hands laced together on the desk.
The white pawn shook itself to life, picking up its sword and shield and marching a few squares to his place on the board. As expected, Harry’s jaw dropped and Draco found himself strangely happy that he was the sole witness to this moment. A Potter with his guard down, but his sense of competitiveness undimmed. There was something about his wide-eyed sense of wonder at all things magical that reminded Draco of his own childish exuberance long past.
“Forgive me,” he said in a low monotone. “I am unwell. I know not of what I speak.”
interviews that had followed.
and flipping to the chapter on controlled memory selection. “Say what you want about Hermione, but it definitely doesn’t hurt to know more about the theory behind… What?”
At the mention of the name, a jolt went through the room. Hermione gasped, Cedric stopped his pacing, and even Luna who had been quiet till now looked up with round, unblinking eyes. Harry glared around the room, waiting for someone to tell him something useful.
“Draco,” Snape drawled from behind Harry’s shoulder. Harry watched as Draco’s face paled nearly to Snape’s degree. He sighed, and removed his arm from where it was hovering absurdly in midair, resting against Draco’s chest which was rising and falling unusually quickly.
“If I won the golf game, he’d host us here for a night out, and if he won, then I had to speak at some Gryffindor event this weekend. Something about old house quidditch rivalries.”
that he had a chance to learn about the First Wizarding War and its casualties in a brief passage under a chapter about Minister for Magic, Harold Minchum.
Snape sighed and looked up at Draco wearily. “I’ve gotten by through being an unambitious follower. Loyal when it counts,” he said, his emotionless mask settling back into place. “You don’t want to give up your soul or you’ll find yourself like Quirrell.”
McGonagall laughed heartlessly, but said nothing.
Voldemort’s head snapped to him so quickly, Harry thought he saw the enchanted flames shudder. “What did you say?”
“No, the plan – we’ll get you out, we have to,” said Harry.
Draco felt his friend’s eyes boring into him after an uncomfortably long silence and sighed. “To be honest with you, I don’t know what the brethren are planning. But I suspect it might be much more than the political coup we’ve been waiting for. I suggest we all remain on guard. I’ll do anything I can to make sure the four of us get through this. Together.”
He followed her gaze out over the fairway to where Harry and her father were talking and nodding in the distance. They looked to be discussing something serious and Draco could feel his fingers tightening into a fist at the thought of what Potter might say about him or his father or their connections to a certain dark lord.
“You were gone for a long time,” said Luna. “What did you see?”
Hurried footsteps approached, and Draco was pulled into a sitting position against the stone wall. Draco tried to focus his eyes to see if it was friend or foe, but even when he could make out the face of Blaise Zabini, he couldn’t be sure.
Cedric let out a sigh of exasperation as he turned to the blond. “And I suppose you know what’s wrong?”
“Wish I’d thought to look here sooner. It would have made escaping a hell of a lot easier,” said Harry with a crooked grin.
“Good chat, Ganger,” Draco called after her, twirling her nicked Restricted Section pass between his fingers. “I’m on it.”
Lucius, ashen faced, said, “Please, my Lord, surely if there were secrets in his mind, you would have already found them.”
“Yes, Mr Malfoy comes from an esteemed wizarding family, much like yourself,” cut in Professor McGonagall with a forced cheerfulness. “I imagine if you had gone to school here you two would have been the best of friends all along.”
Draco laughed under his breath. He always wondered why Granger was sorted into Gryffindor rather than Ravenclaw, but here was that classic Gryffindor fiery indignation coming out.
Draco and Angelica trailed slightly behind, where Draco could glower at the back of Potter’s head without the others noticing.
“Hey, it’s alright,” said Draco. “We’ll get your mum back.”
“In the diadem, Hermione said they have to be destroyed beyond magical repair,” said Harry. “Something about Basilisk venom imbuing the sword of Gryffindor. But she said the venom on its own might work if we could find some.”
through the boy’s own eyes as confirmation of the very fact,” said Lucius, holding his son’s stare. “Only he managed to slip away with the help of a young Auror.”
“We’re trying to get the Pensieve,” said Draco, as he and McGonagall moved to the faint blue glow of the basin.
As she turned around, placing the diadem on her head, Harry only had a moment to shout, “Luna, no!” before her eyes fluttered shut and she crumpled as if struck with instantaneous sleep. Harry caught her small form just in time and laid her on the couch.
And Harry hadn’t given him the slightest indication of interest of that kind, not really. Besides, Draco had already seen his pretty redhead girlfriend at home. He cursed himself inwardly for the weakness and continued marching to the common room, determined to right himself of this deficiency of character as quickly as possible.
“Fuck, Harry,” said Draco, rising to stalk to the other side of the room, where he stared down at the spinning record player.
As she waited, she watched the comings and goings of Privet Drive, which were for the most part without note. The local residents went about their day, toddling off to work in their rumbling cars or blaring televisions while they vacuumed their carpets. The Muggle lifestyle was quite noisy really, and that was saying something for a woman who lived at a boarding school.
charm, the next he’s set the bedsheets on fire. I wouldn’t want to teach him a Stunning Spell for fear he’d send someone’s head flying.”
Harry was certainly not missing Privet Drive, though he couldn’t help but wonder what his life would be like if he’d gone on never knowing that the magical world existed. Maybe he and Charlotte would be in Edinburgh or beyond by now. Maybe he would have made amends with his guardians and would be fastidiously studying for his A-levels, maybe even taking courses at the university on Mr Salerni’s recommendation. Or maybe he and Al would have made up after their terrible fight and he’d be waiting in the park for Harry this Sunday, only Harry wouldn’t show.
He didn’t know how long it lasted, but it felt like hours. Drawing up memories of the Dark Lord coming to reside at the Manor, still only half a man emerging out of his servant Quirrell. Of the dreaded north wing where he attended lessons through his youth; first timidly, demonstrating any spell he was asked and taking corrections for fear of doing anything else. Then later, coming to feel a sense of pride at the relationship. Knowing that he was learning theory not even taught at Hogwarts and from a tutor anyone in his peer group would envy.
“Yes, yes,” said McGonagall placatingly. “I think there could be potential here. If you can get Harry up to speed in the next 4 weeks I will certainly consider it an accomplishment worthy of recommendation.”
“What’s a Slytherin?” asked Harry.
“Please,” said Harry, turning back to the elderly teacher and hoping there was something he could do to appeal to her judgement. “My friend is still out there – I have to get back to her. Don’t you think my parents would want you to believe in me enough to let me go?”
Luna took a few steps into the room, her footfalls echoing around the cavernous space. She cast a quick charm in the direction of the tiara and before Harry could say “wait!” she bent over and plucked it off the ground.
Draco had been careful to tell his mother to station at least two Death Eaters at Woking Station in Surrey on Halloween night. It was the main rail line directly into London, so of course any reasonable Muggle would choose that path as a means of escape. But when it got down to crafting the plan with Potter, he’d been annoyingly insistent about some hairbrained idea involving a boat.
“Can it do any damage?” asked Harry.
“But I don’t understand. Why did Draco go off on his own? He should have waited for us,” said Hermione, flipping through books next to him, looking for a way to help.
“You’ve created a monster, Potter,” said Draco with a smirk.
He’d selected an early moment at the Manor, one of his favourites, and as green eyes melted into his own, he felt an uncomfortable sense of vulnerability. Which was silly really. There was nothing Potter could do to access important memories of his that would reveal his connection to the Dark Lord, but it was still unnerving. Almost like opening a vault of family jewels in front of a stranger.
“It’s just an experiment,” said Draco, lying easily. “Sometimes having someone force their way in can cause the mind to leap to places you’re subconsciously protecting. A good Legilimens is like a pickpocket, spotting your hand as it darts to protect your prize possessions. If it doesn’t work, we can always go back to mind mapping.”
“Playing both sides, are we?” he asked, shoving his hands in his pockets and taking a few strides across the room to look across Harry’s shoulder at the chessboard.
“Oh, yeah, I was meaning to tell you – Cedric and I had a breakthrough,” said Harry, jumping up to grab some notes he and Cedric had scribbled out for her benefit. “It turns out that what I struggle with most is the really precise, fiddly magic, but I’m faring pretty well when it comes to large, sweeping spells like shields or blasting curses. Check it out,”
“No you don’t,” said Blaise. “It’s a Monday.”
The noble lines of Draco’s face were pulled tight as he stared incredulously back at Harry. He opened his mouth but said nothing and closed it again.
He glanced across to the trunk, which sat stoically, a constant reminder of his old mentor. It would be ages before he and Draco could get through all the memories, they’d have to find a faster way. Or perhaps they didn’t need them after all. If they could just find what type of magic Voldemort was using, they could figure out what else it was they needed to look for.
“I – I thought our Lord was still up on Oxfordshire,” said Draco, numbly falling into step with his father. Their footfalls sounded off the marble floor as morose paintings watched them pass. “Zabini got a letter. I assumed he was getting called up to take the Mark.”
Draco managed to get some alone time with Mr DuPont on the second hole and tried to strike up a conversation about Quidditch, knowing that Edgar was a supporter of the American national team. But it turned out that he was a much bigger fan of Quodpot, and shifted the conversation to a comparison of the relative merits of Quodpot over Quidditch, which included such reasons as: more athletic players, more scoring, and being generally more interesting to watch. Draco kept his composure until Mr DuPont compared Quidditch to ballet on brooms, and then promptly turned the conversation to the weather.
“Given how much help Borgin was with the ring, I can’t imagine we’ll be able to get many answers about an object that no one living has laid eyes on,” said Harry. “And the tradeoff might be learning how we ought to be fighting against Voldemort.”
Pansy giggled. “Merlin, at least wait till we can find a tapestry or something.”
“Oh, hey,” said Harry, finding himself face to face with the set of grey eyes that had occupied his throughs for months. “You’re back. I’ve been meaning to speak to you as well.”
“Are you sure he didn’t say a cruxzor?” asked Luna, looking up from the
Hermione shook her head. “But is it even possible?”
“More like bureaucracy.”
“What the hell, Professor,” said Draco. Snape propped himself up on an elbow at the edge of the stone basin, looking like he might be sick. “You can get lost in there if you’re not careful.”
“Of course.”
“Intruder ward on your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Cedric. “I set it up when I went back for your things. When a magical presence tripped it last night, I called McGonagall straight away. From there it didn’t take long to figure out you were on the run.”
“The girl, watch out for her will you?”
“You don’t say,” said Harry, remembering the seriousness of the young Auror. “A little too hardworking if you ask me.”
“Did you get what you needed?” asked Pansy, tucking her hair behind her ears as she turned to face him with an unimpressed look.
“You’ll never come out of there,” pleaded Draco, fighting against a lump in his throat. He could hardly bear to see what had become of this once imposing figure; reduced to grasping at strands of memory to escape this reality.
“We could, erm, go up to Sirius’s room? I wouldn’t mind listening to a record or two,” suggested Harry, feeling like the idea was a stupid one even as it came tumbling out of his mouth.
“Depends on how far you’ve gotten with everything else,” said Cedric, looking in Hermione’s direction.
Like his brother’s, it was decked out in school colours, but these were the familiar silver and green of Slytherin house. The room was lived-in but tidy, and a dark Black family crest was painted over the bed, with the motto
“Yeah, I think I really had control that time. I was navigating, like you said,” said Harry, picking up his copy of
Harry flopped back against the window seat for dramatic effect, and Draco could feel him studying his face.
Hermione considered this for a moment and then wordlessly released the restraints on his right arm. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the holly wand. He hadn’t attempted to share his consciousness with another before, but he’d seen Malfoy do it, so he knew it was possible. Not to mention he had no idea what would work in the rendered world of the diadem, but it was now or never if he wanted to get anything useful out of this vision.
“Have I told you how dashing you look in this suit?” she asked, in a transparent attempt to placate him.
No one on Privet Drive seemed to notice her anxious pacing or dour expression. She was, after all, a cat.
Draco followed her pointing and spotted a familiar-looking face among a crowd of quidditch players at a table against the wall. Suddenly, the whole thing sounded ridiculous to him. If Potter had given him a phony bet, then he’d intended for them to end up at Aparecium all along. He tried to think of what motivations could underlie this series of events, but mind was foggy and part of him wanted to believe Pansy. He glanced around for Potter but couldn’t spot him.
“Funny,” said Blaise, rummaging in his pockets for a letter on crisp white paper. He tossed it in Draco’s direction, where he immediately recognised the Malfoy seal. “I’ve already received a summons.”
Harry rubbed his eyes, repositioning his glasses on his nose as the others gathered around. “It was a different place than where the diadem took you, I think. There wasn’t any rebellion. I was with Hermione searching for Horcruxes in the woods somewhere.”
Draco aimed his wand at the book, and just as he was about to cast a voice from the end of the row asked, “What are you doing?”
“Ah. I sense conflict within you,” said Voldemort, inclining his head slightly. “You have seen it. Then let me share with you my secret; there is a way to usurp Dumbledore’s designs.”
“Wouldn’t surprise me if Granger has gone straight to the books, eh Potter? Bit of a death by paper cut,” said Draco in an attempt at light-hearted camaraderie. “I promise there’s more to it than that.”
“And new friends!” piped Angelica.
“Ah, so that’s what all these years of sucking up to McGonagall has bought you?” Draco stood over her, eyeing the Restricted Section pass.
“But that would mean,” whispered Hermione, still patting Kreacher’s hand comfortingly on the arm of the chair as she looked between the others. “That Sirius Black was…”
It wasn’t until the conversation started veering towards Draco’s stake in the matter that he remembered with a shock how it ended. He tried to close it off, but Harry had felt his surprise and was now interested to see what would unfold.
“No, that’s not it,” said Harry, waving his hand as though trying to clear the air. “It’s just, there’s a lot to think about before you make that kind of decision.”
Luna and Neville were side by side with a handful of others, positioned in the shattered window frames, using the high ground to target spells into the fray below, as the cold night air blew in from behind. Among them was Kreacher, who yelled with as much fervour as the rest of them as he flung himself into battle.
“Harry’s safe now,” said Dumbledore, nodding slowly. “And it is imperative we cast the Fidelius soon, to keep it that way.”
Draco’s father was like a ghost moving through the halls, constantly on one task or another for the Dark Lord. Death Eaters came in and out of the house, sometimes gathering for council meetings in the library, other times running news of Ministry goings-on or stifling threats to the Dark Lord’s claim to power.
Draco winced as he came close to another player, nearly getting a slide tackle to the ankle, but Harry’s foot swung back just in time. He aimed, his foot made contact, and he could see the ball flying through the air as a heavy weight made contact with his shoulder and he fell to the ground as the small crowd erupted in mixed cheers of “Foul” and “Goal!”
Draco neutralised his features and walked around to face Voldemort.
“Yes, well, I’m quite beside myself,” said Draco, with a confident smile. He hadn’t been expecting it till the end of the evening, but he was pleased that Angelica had formally accepted the match. He could finally rest easy, knowing that his plans had come to fruition. “I couldn’t be happier.”
And a snake slithers into the woods, where she is met by her master.
There had been glimmers over the past few weeks of real brains behind those bouncing waves. She was certainly strategic, and she seemed just on the edge of saying something compelling, before biting her tongue and falling back on something airheaded. But he liked her like she was now; frank, open, competitive.
Pansy watched the exchange with a look of mild disinterest. He’d have to try again with her later.
“No, it’s not that.”
As much as he didn’t want to believe it, he knew what this meant. Andromeda had raised him, and his parents were dead.
The memory of the escape started from the back of the Thestral, though if Draco didn’t know better he’d say they were hurtling through thin air. Strange that Potter had never witnessed death, he thought. Perhaps he had not witnessed his parents struck down by the Killing Curse at all.
It would be fine, he told himself. He’d done this kind of thing before. He could get through it if it meant sealing the deal. Only a few months of good behaviour and he would be sure to get his family name back in society’s good books. Then he’d break the news to Angelica and go back to doing however he pleased. Sure, there’d be a period of adjustment, but once the old blood magic was in place, there was little either of them could gain from breaking the bond.
“Hello?” called an airy voice. “They must be here somewhere. This place is full of Wrackspurts.”
“The Manor? Opulent.”
“What could you possibly want with me?” he asked drily.
“Say it,” he said in a low voice.
Just as he was about to come back with something thoroughly inappropriate for the breakfast table, he heard a small cough behind him, and the two turned to see Granger standing with a load of books in her arms.
“I don’t mind,” said Harry, “but I thought you said Muggle solutions were always inferior to magical ones.”
“Now then,” said Umbridge matter-of-factly when the screaming had subsided. “I’ll ask you one more time. Where is the wand?”
Draco was peering at him suspiciously. “Were you speaking to the snake?”
“I take it you support a winning team?” said Harry with amusement as his eyes transfixed on the highlights from the weekend matches.
“It would just be easier if he wasn’t so serious all the time.” He knew Malfoy was right, but there was something about the older boy that got under his skin, like Cedric had sized Harry up as a common criminal before he’d even said two words to the guy.
“I hope that it’s not the case, but I can’t find anything else, even in the Restricted Section,” said Hermione, letting out a huff of frustration. She flipped past a few grim pictures of children in Victorian era clothing, surrounded by healers casting diagnostic spells and pacing about nervously. “Not to mention there have been so few cases in the last century that even the Healer techniques are more dated than Binns’s lesson plans.”
“I wonder,” said the old man under his breath.
“I deserve that,” he said. “But the Granger and Diggory don’t. They support you, they can help you finish this.”
Harry gripped the wand and a few restless sparks burst out of the end, startling the other two.
Hermione took a deep breath and squared up to him. “Look, I know what you’re thinking, but now’s not the time to be hasty. Let’s think things through with Cedric when he gets back. None of us want Draco to be over there alone but—”
“That’s true. If you know how things are stored you can more easily navigate your mental pathways.”
to follow. The Weasley twins helped the last few stragglers out the door and waved encouragingly as the group set off through the streets, dim in the late afternoon sun.
“Of course, quid pro quo,” said Draco leaning back on the settee and regarding his friend with a look of amusement.
“Well, my friend, you and I know there’s only one way to deal with a secret,” said Voldemort, his face parted in a smile that showed far too many teeth. “Either become the Secret Keeper. Or kill them.”
Draco hesitated, a muscle strained in his jaw and his glance flicked to Snape’s black eyes, hoping for a bit of warmth but seeing only placid disregard.
“I never said it would be easy,” said Harry. “But I want to know you. All of you. So don’t push me away now.”
“Wiser than your parents,” said Voldemort, drumming his fingers on the arm of the chair. “That’s reassuring.”
“No time, leave it,” commanded McGonagall, sending a few rapidfire spells around the room to conceal, destroy, or hide away a final few precious objects.
“Pawn to D4,” he said.
“Alright. Let’s see it once more, Potter,” said Cedric, walking in a circle around Harry as he cast a Shield Charm. “Excellent, this looks solid. A good shield will be more than its money’s worth when you don’t have a counter-jinx handy.”
said Hermione, turning back in a flash, her eyes brimming with tears. “That name has a Taboo on it. So unless you want both of us killed, I suggest you avoid summoning You-Know-Who by name. Now—” She Transfigured a chair out of the forest floor and took a seat across from Harry. “We’re going to start from the beginning, and you’re going to tell me exactly who you are and what you know. Because the real Harry would never forget that Cedric is dead.”
“This is no laughing matter, Draco,” spat Snape as he wheeled around to the desk. “You are being enlisted to teach this boy a very specific skill, one that may well keep him alive and one with which candour and discretion are of the utmost importance. Do I make myself clear?”
“I mean, if you think it was just luck, I’d be happy to play you again,” said Harry, turning to face Draco with a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth. “Best of three? I’ve got plenty of time for golf these days.”
“That is because you are a twat,” said Hermione, brushing past him. “Anyway, I’m off to write to Flourish and Blotts and see if they have Dr Weaver’s book in stock. Maybe you could do something equally useful and help Harry protect his mind from someone who wants to kill him. Just a thought.”
said Harry, appreciating a poignant snake perspective on the matter.
“What’s so funny?” demanded Draco. “I’m telling you there’s a group of rogue students hellbent on finding the Dark Lord’s weakness. Surely that has to be bad news for at least one of the parties involved.”
on Halloween and the disappearances of old loyalists. I think it benefits us. Let the rest of the world wonder while you regain your strength. By the time you’re ready to take a seat of power, your followers will have had time to prepare.”
“Exactly, but we don’t want Harry to be seen out in the corridor, so I was thinking we’d set up a guardian ward. That way Harry can only leave the room if he’s with one of us under the charm. We’ll put him under disillusionment, leave the room, then return with the intention to have a training space. And we can switch it back before we go.”
Draco’s head snapped in Angelica’s direction, but she merely beamed back at the group and patted his arm.
When it looked like McGonagall would argue, Draco interrupted, “We know about the prophecy.”
“Hang on, Hermione,” said Cedric, putting a hand on her shoulder.
“This isn’t you,” she said, holding her wand steady but failing to mask the concern in her voice. “You forget I can always tell when you’re lying.”
“I believe that this may be the lost diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw,” she said, looking through the sapphires towards the light of the window. “Rumoured to bestow great knowledge on the wearer.”
“Er, right,” said Harry, unsure how he should take this news. “So people are still at the school then? Is Luna there?”
“No,” he said, fighting tears.
Draco tossed his club back in the trolley and stalked off towards his ball, Harry quickly falling in step beside him.
“It’s McGonagall,” he managed to choke out. “The Ministry… they’re coming to take her.”
“You think?” said Harry, the scepticism on his face melting away with the realisation.
Draco turned to leave, catching Luna’s eye, who looked just as surprised by the recent turn of events as he was.
Harry found himself in the cupboard under the stairs. The place had a nostalgic familiarity to it now, and Draco’s presence was a comfort more than anything. Now that Draco had seen Al, the visions of his shadow self, everything, there was nothing left to hide, really. Draco knew as much about him as anyone had in his entire life.
At the far side of the room, Cedric ducked in through the fireplace, signalling to Hermione that this was everyone.
“Thank you, Harry!” said Luna, twirling, her golden hair fanning out around her. “Mine are from Madame Malkin’s, but I did put my very own rain-proofing charm on them. I can do yours if you like, Draco.”
“A prophecy,” said Snape. “
“There you are,” said Luna, sweeping toward him in her billowing school robes. Poking through the golden ringlets around her neck was a familiar green snake. “Come on out, everyone’s dying to meet you.”
“Er, yeah,” said Harry.
Pansy slapped Draco hard across the face, and he took a step back. Her eyes burned with rage and something else – betrayal?
“That’s heartless even from you,” said Pansy, pointedly picking up her tea and turning her face from him to look out over the lawn.
Draco felt deeply uneasy watching the scene play out, and for a minute wondered whether he had pushed Potter too far, though he was no longer resisting. Unlike the other memories where Harry had suffered abuse at the hands of his guardians and brushed it off or stood up for himself, this one was different. He couldn’t have been much older than a boy, but he seemed to be genuinely afraid for his life.
said it might have addled his brain. Thought I’d better keep an eye on him.”
“Do you think he’s still out there?” asked Draco.
“A gift,” Draco repeated, regarding the horrid plant with disgust.
Draco made his way down to the Potions dungeon that evening, hoping Snape’s news might be accompanied with an invitation home, but hesitated at the arched doorway when he heard the voice of Professor McGonagall from within. He quickly cast an eavesdropping charm to listen in.
He could hear chattering in a distant room, immediately calling to mind his parents. But the voices were worried, speaking in short, clipped bursts.
“Why don’t you try a lightening charm?” said a friendly voice.
Umbridge huffed an unpleasant laugh and came to stand opposite McGonagall at the desk. “You do know that ignoring a Ministry summons is grounds for arrest, correct?”
“Would you say you know us now?” asked Luna, leaning her chin in her hand.
“I think you’re overthinking things, darling,” said Draco, putting a hand on her arm and caressing it gently. If he could just corral her into a kiss, maybe he could distract her long enough to drop the whole thing. Otherwise they were heading towards a situation he might not be able to talk himself out of. “I really haven’t been gone all that long.”
“What’s there to do for fun around here, anyway?” asked Harry.
But he didn’t have time to waste. Now with the foolhardy gang reassembled and on a daft mission to defeat the Dark Lord, he’d have to move quickly if he wanted to ensure that he still had Potter’s trust. The only way to do that was to get back inside his mind.
“Or whatever you and Ginny are calling yourselves these days,” said Hermione. “Honestly. The girl is still holding out a flame for you though I’m sure Dean is breathing down her neck back at Hogwarts.”
“Certainly not. A man’s only as good as his word.”
“Yeah, but what did you think of the game? I mean, did you see that goal?”
“Do—” Draco’s voice was dry and raspy from screaming. “Do you want me to kill her?”
“No, they… they couldn’t.” Harry flexed his hands angrily and a strange pulse of energy pushed through the room, rattling an empty plate on a dinner tray and ruffling the pages of an open book on the desk.
“Just hall patrol,” said Draco, plastering on a serene smile. He was so good at flipping the switch. If Harry hadn’t seen his panicked pacing in the Room of Requirement not ten minutes ago, he wouldn’t have believed it to be the same person.
“Oh Harry,” said Hermione, her face falling. “There’s so much I wish I could tell you. You would have loved Sirius. Maybe you can still find him? Let’s come back to it if there’s time.”
“Wands match the temperament of their owners,” said Draco at last, catching Harry’s eye as he looked up from the
As the surrounding sensations became more solid, he thought for a moment about pulling back, redirecting himself to the maths memory instead. But Draco’s calming presence like a warm breeze reassured him and he stayed put, his curiosity getting the better of both of them.
” down the hall, which Cedric quickly deflected with a “
All three heads turned in Draco’s direction. The Dementors he knew, but giants? Frank Longbottom? The Dark Lord was actively moving pawns on the board to be sure, but Draco had thought he was close enough to the source to be informed of the plan. After all, they were planning for a political coup, not a civil war. He would have plenty to ask his father when he visited.
on the sword and throwing it to the side. He put a hand out to Draco, who grasped it, and Harry pulled him to his feet and slipped an arm around his waist to steady him. They stood together, backs to the fire, and watched the chaos around them.
“Launching his company in Europe. We’re revitalising the old deal,”
“Hello Hermione,” said Luna Lovegood, rising to her feet and surveying the pair. “Draco. Have you two always been friends?”
“She’s unwell,” said Lucius curtly.
“Like you lied to your followers?” challenged Harry. “Or does everyone here know you’re not a pure-blood at all? You’re a half-blood, and an orphan just like me.”
as ropes sprang up around him, binding him to the bench.
“We’re not trying to change you Harry, it’s just that there are magical solutions which can be improvements on—” started Hermione.
McGonagall sighed. “I was concerned he might be dangerous,” she said, frankly. “Cedric reported a strange incident when he went to pick up the boy. An inexplicable display of magic; he was bound, wandless, and yet when he was cornered, he let off a burst of dangerous magical energy.”
Dumbledore’s voice strained slightly on the words, as though he was urging himself as much as her to believe them.
The moment he let his guard down, Snape had his wand out and hit him with a knock-back jinx at close range. Draco went flying into the apothecary cabinet, sending shelves of dry ingredients crashing down around him like a potpourri rain.
“Unbelievable,” he muttered, inspecting a suit of armour at close range and jumping back with a noise of alarm when the helmeted head turned to inspect him back.
“How can you tell?” asked Harry, over the sound of spells sizzling through the air while Draco and Cedric taunted and threatened each other in equal measure.
“Should I go?” asked Hermione through a mouthful of biscuit.
On his last night in the Manor, he finally had an opportunity alone with his father to broach the subject.
“I think it’s worth giving it a go. If we skip too far ahead, we can always backtrack.”
“What goes up must come down. How trite,” drawled Draco.
“As much as I can’t wait to get you alone to myself, I would hate for your father to think of me as indecent,” he said in a similarly hushed tone, grabbing her wrist to keep it going up any farther.
“No way. The group needs protection. Go,” she called, taking off through the shield and knocking the closest Death Eater out cold with an immobilising spell.
Harry could see a smile flicker to life on Luna’s face. “That reminds me, have you seen the Mimbulus mimbletonia lately, Hermione?” Luna said. “Its secretions have turned purple. Should we see if that’s changed any of the properties?”
Hermione ran the length of the room as Draco staggered and fell to one knee. Harry’s heart dropped. He was momentarily frozen, but Luna came to his side, neutralising the spell on his leg so they could dash down the length of the hall to gather around Draco. Hermione was already ripping the tattered fabric away from his shoulder to get a better look at the wound, while Draco winced in pain.
“Whatever happened to deductive reasoning?” drawled Draco with a sharp edge to his voice. “Get a grip, Granger, you’re starting to sound unhinged.”
In the memory, Draco’s heartbeat quickened. Panic rose in him at discovering simultaneously that Harry’s friend was alive, but that he might be the one to end her.
But Angelica just seemed more amused by his stammering and let out a snort of laughter. “Draco, it’s fine,” she was saying, waving it away. “It’s fine, please sit. I’ve known all along. In fact, it’s one of the reasons I chose you.”
Harry did as he was told. Too impressed with how quickly Draco took command of the situation to resist.
No, that was ridiculous. That was the second (better) bottle of wine talking, certainly. Whether he liked him, whether he was attracted to him, of that there could be no doubt. The boiling of emotions he had felt when he saw Theo kiss him was enough to tell him that much. The feeling of those emotions ten times over when he was the one kissing Draco sealed the deal.
“Right,” said Harry, rising to pace in front of the fireplace and walk through the plan again to spot any loopholes as they had already done a few times that afternoon.
“Oh ho ho, take a look at this Blaise,” said Voldemort, circling the small group to lay a hand on the Slytherin’s shoulder. Blaise tried to hold an expression of steely resolve, but Draco could see fear behind his eyes. “It would appear that Draco has grown sympathetic for the enemy. How pitiful. It should be easy for you to climb the ranks in his stead, wouldn’t you agree?”
“That’s brilliant,” said Harry. Luna seemed like the type that didn’t care about going in Hermione’s spell order. Maybe he could even get a jinx or two out of her.
Angelica burst into giggles. “Coming!” she called.
“Got what?” asked Harry, bewildered.
Harry scanned the room from Voldemort’s eyes. He was standing at the head of a long table flanked on either side by the dark faces of twenty Death Eaters. Two were the men that Harry had seen before. On Voldemort’s right was an austere man with long, white-blond hair. Harry looked at him and the man struggled to meet his gaze. Harry felt a pang at the thought of Draco and his anger raged harder.
“At least try to pretend you go here,” said Malfoy, stifling a laugh.
“Only good ones,” said Luna, sitting up, her scrunchied ponytail swinging over her shoulder.
“Of course! He needed time to regenerate, so he used one of his disciples as a surrogate,” said Hermione. “But that doesn’t explain why he ended up dead.”
He was reeling. All of the months spent at the castle, the dangers he’d been through, everything was worth it for this moment, this truth about his mother. He had to remind himself to breathe as the disbelief and joy at seeing his mother’s last action to protect him was replaced by a loathing and a strange curiosity about the Dark Lord himself.
Pansy said nothing but stood rigid as he moved a hand to her waist, pressing a knee between her legs.
was disconcerting, Draco would have to get a tighter handle on things or the dynamic of the group would change, and he wouldn’t allow his position of power to slip through his fingers that easily.
“Stop blinking so much and focus,” directed Malfoy, his smile falling into a perturbed glare.
“The Dark Lord will understand. Those were decisions we had to make when the world believed him gone. But we can quickly make up for the lost time. From where I stand politically, there is no one better suited to help him amass a following, and no one to stand in our way.”
“I see,” said Draco, wondering how in the hell Potter could still be alive if those were the two sent after him and feeling an annoying wave of relief. He could barely cast a solid Shield Charm, for Merlin’s sake. “And what led our old friends to make such an egregious error?”
“It’s a ring,” said Harry. “Have you ever read Tolkien? I bet it’s like the seven rings of power. We just need to figure out how Voldemort made it so we can find the others and then destroy it.”
“That’s 15 points, Longbottom. Don’t try it again,” he said. Then, as Neville made to scamper away, he called, “It’ll be 50 if you mention poetry to another living soul.”
altogether.
She drew her paws together and waited for him to approach, debating whether to reveal herself or wait and see if he was about to do what she feared. Her tail twitched.
Harry held the wand up, feeling his magic coursing through him. “
“I’m not leaving till we have all the Horcruxes,” said Harry firmly.
He tried to open his eyes against the pain, to look up into Sirius’s room, but instead he opened his eyes in a familiar periwinkle room edged in back trim.
“I like to though,” said Luna, twirling in a circle. “Muggle clothes are so much fun.”
“You know who would love this?” said Harry, putting an album called Rumours by Fleetwood Mac on the record player one afternoon. “Luna.”
said the tiny snake.
But despite his concern about any damage the snake might do to his robes that were more expensive than his racing broom, something definitely warmed inside him when the other two burst into laughter. The little snake flicked her tongue out near Draco’s ear as he turned to look at her, and Harry and Luna both agreed that she seemed happy with the new vantage point.
“How do I know you won’t just pick my future for me?” Draco asked, keeping his voice level but secretly quite keen to see what was revealed.
He’d had his pick of the pure-blood girls as potential matches, but Pansy offered an unparalleled partnership. She was smart, ruthless, and didn’t look half bad in a dress. Besides which, she was absolutely head over heels for him. A piece of information Draco had put to good use more than once.
“Well, that’s what I thought at first, but once I met you I knew there was so much more potential,” she said, collecting the turned over cards to the deck and resting them on her crossed knees. “You’re brilliant, deviant, and above all, you have vision. You’re the perfect person to represent our interests to the Collective, as long as I can make sure our interests are the same. Plus, I know you know a good bet when you see one, so I figured I’d lay it all out for you.”
Harry laughed as he twisted the ends of two wires together. “Leave it to you to find a way to weaponize Luna’s personality.”
“Good,” hissed the Dark Lord. “Because this is going to hurt very much.”
“Did he return for the object or has he left it in our continued care?”
Draco’s insides were boiling. He couldn’t lose control of this group – not now, not when everything was threatening to fall apart. Yet somehow he felt less concerned about the Mark, and more worried about the future of his friends. Would they be like the three who had come after Tonks in the alley who would have surely taken down 50 Muggles if they could?
“Hm?” Her head popped back up and she fixed him with a look of concentration. “Oh, it’s nothing. You’re doing well.”
And with that his eyes rolled back, and he tipped face forward where Hermione caught him with a spell to slow his fall.
Harry followed him into Sirius’s room, his heart beating annoyingly loud as he watched Draco’s slender hands move over the box of records, pausing at interesting ones to inspect.
“As I say,” said Cedric, turning back to Harry and repositioning his shoulders. “Just another once or twice, to see you’ve got it.”
“You’re looking very happy lately,” said Hermione, as she and Draco pushed a trolley down the frozen foods aisle of a Muggle supermarket. “Care to share?”
Draco was still fuming at Blaise’s insubordination by the time he’d staked his way up to the 7th floor corridor. How dare he challenge Draco in front of the group like that? Though the information Blaise had discovered in the
Cedric fiddled with the clasp on the locket doors, jangling the chain loudly.
“Come on, Granger. Have I ever steered you wrong?”
“Once we get everyone loaded up, you’ll follow the map in the lead and I’ll take up the rear,” said Tonks, looking up into the sky where the moon was now visible and checking a Muggle watch on her wrist. “We don’t have much time.”
“She’s a gardener?”
There was the problem right there, thought Draco. If Potter was going to have any chance of bonding with the wand, he needed to be able to spend time with it. Without a proper working relationship it would keep acting up, no matter how strong the user’s magic was.
“Well, it’s clearly not his grip,” said Draco.
“We’re only getting essentials,” said Hermione. “Money is tight and Kreacher kept throwing them out anyway. You know how much he prefers to bake for us.”
“I know,” said Draco. “But I want to help. We have all the information we need, and that’s something. We can end this.”
“So you’ve only known Potter for the last few weeks?” said Draco, trying to put the pieces together and suddenly feeling the whiskey’s effects as the wheels of his brain creaked into gear. If what Gemma was saying was true, something was definitely off. Potter had a near death experience which was not reported despite having
By the time he finished telling them everything from the vision – Tonks, his parents, the resistance, London – a solemn quiet had settled over the group. Only the sound of the fire crackling in the grate nearby provided any life in the room.
“You’re gambling with our future,” she said in a shaky voice.
“Barely,” said Cedric, hiccuping happily.
“That’s going too far, Snape,” said Draco, feeling like he was looking at a stranger. “I’ve long thought of you as a mentor, and I’m grateful for the help you’ve given me these last years. But if you think my loyalty to you will extend as far as to let you share my glory once I have solved this puzzle for our master, you are mistaken.”
“Thanks for that,” said Harry, cocking an eyebrow in Draco’s direction. “Love the look by the way, where’d you get it?” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Wasn’t going to,” said Draco. His mind was still reeling from his meeting the night before. He was planning on ignoring another one of Lockhart’s aimless lectures in favour of a bit of research, when he noticed Granger sitting in front of him, drawing up a timetable. He had a feeling he knew exactly who it was for.
in hand.
“He’s going to try the trick the Master played on the Eighth Doctor! I’ve heard them talking about it.”
“Absolutely not,” said Draco, seething with disdain. He instinctively looked around for Potter, but he was no longer at the table where Draco had last seen him.
Draco’s breath caught in his chest. His mother had lied to the Dark Lord on his account.
“My dear! Congratulations,” said Pansy, hugging Angelica gently.
Of course it did. He wouldn’t throw away his friendships on a stupid fight. There was more at stake than that. And the truth of the matter was, he did trust them.
After she left, Harry sat petulantly on the couch, grumbling about arbitrary rules, and Draco saw his opportunity to build a bit of rapport. He wandered over to his usual armchair by the fire, with the day’s
“In a way, yes,” said McGonagall, arching an eyebrow. “Now, it seems to me that this is an unusual case of the Room of Requirement responding to a student who was on the lookout for something it interpreted as a match for the contents of the room; in this case, the owner of the snake.”
, which was now also under the heavy grip of Fudge’s Ministry.
, read the headline in flashing text.
“But why didn’t it show Luna that if that was the timeline we were meant to see?” asked Draco, who Harry was pleased to see had changed out of his Quidditch gear and back into Harry’s t-shirt.
“Alas, there are wishes even beyond my powers to grant,” said Voldemort, gesturing to a crumpled shape in front of the fireplace. “The boy will not survive. And he does not deserve to.”
“It’s true. I remember the name of the boy who became the Dark Lord. Though many will have forgotten it,” Ollivander said, running his fingers across the warm wood and lining it up like a sight. “It is a very dangerous name to know. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy – knowledge of this sort is a target for Death Eaters.”
“Yes, I’ve been told,” said Draco, feeling a sudden tightness in his throat. “Can you tell me more about the circumstances of the deal?”
Draco dragged his wand against the surface of the liquid, pulling the silver strand of memory back into the phial and stoppering it. “But it wasn’t enough.”
“For one thing, I’ve seen some pretty dark magic.” Harry’s eyes darted to the photo of a cloaked figure lying on the ground and his mind flashed back to the memory of the woman. “And for another… he’s confronted me recently. In the vision. He’s spoken to me.”
He would march straight down to McGonagall and tell her that Potter was a menace. That he ought to be locked up. Maybe he could convince her to break the Fidelius and turn Potter over to the authorities. It would be far easier for the brethren to pluck him out of the Ministry’s clutches than out of Hogwarts at any rate.
called the cold voice, and Draco went blind with the pain. He would have done anything, said anything to stop it.
The way Harry looked at him before finding out he really was a Death Eater.
“Just wait till this year is up at any rate. Once I’m gone, you can do whatever you want to yourself, just not while I still have use for you,” said Draco, falling into easy banter.
“So my father would have put forward money in exchange for some interest in a private company?” That tracked with what he had heard so far at any rate, even if he had to pretend he understood what a few of Greenacre’s terms meant.
“No one’s questioning your spell work, Granger, just your ability to read the room.”
One of the robed men turned as they approached, and Harry stopped dead in his tracks. It was the blunt faced man from his visions. He was taller than he looked when Harry was in his shadow form, and he wore a cocky smile, unlike the expression of terror he’d worn when Harry had held him by the neck. Harry put out a hand instinctively to stop Charlotte from going any farther.
“Precisely,” said Snape, his face hardening in an instant as he fixed Draco with an unflinching gaze. “One month different and it could have been you.”
“In my experience, everyone is motivated by their own interests at the end of the day,” said Draco. What was Granger, after all, some kind of altruist?
“Harry, he’s going to call me,” said Draco. Gone was the fear in his voice. What remained was complete composure. This only broke Harry more.
“Oh, was that everything? I didn’t expect there to be so little.” Harry scrutinised Malfoy for a beat, trying to sort out whether he really was the prick he made himself out to be, when the corners of his mouth quirked up.
Draco told himself it was only bait. But he couldn’t help but ask, “Why? What did he say?”
Well, if he couldn’t write it he was pretty sure he couldn’t say it, but he might as well give it a crack.
“So that’s it. You use me, I use you, and we both get what we want?” said Draco, all pretence finally dropped.
On the way up to the seventh floor corridor, Draco tried to imagine what the boy would look like. If he was born in 1980, he would be Draco’s own age, only a few weeks apart even. And the papers always made such a big fuss about Lily Evans’s bright red hair and dashing green eyes. She was the perfect image of a martyr in all the
“Well, yes.”
By Halloween eve, Harry’s plans were perfectly laid.
“Have it your way, Granger,” said Draco with a sigh.
Hermione paused in her bustling around and shot Draco a dark glance. “Are you sure you don’t want to just take the afternoon off, Harry? I could point you to some reading for next week instead.”
He rolled it gingerly in his hand. A few days ago he would have thought this was nothing more than a branch, but holding it now, he wondered how he could have ever believed magic didn’t exist.
It did not make perfect sense.
“Are you sure you want to do that?” asked Draco. Harry turned to look at him. His mouth was drawn in a tight line, but he looked like he would let go if Harry asked.
” called Draco from the other end of the hall, knocking Cedric’s wand out of his hand and sending it flying.
It was around that time he became connected with a small group he referred to as the Collective. Often travelling out to London for what he described to Narcissa as investment opportunities. Draco had been an infant and Lucius took great pains to keep Narcissa out of the public eye for fear of retribution against his own misdeeds as a Death Eater. Luckily, the “Imperius” defence held up in court, and the small pot of money they’d set aside for investments, was left to simmer away while they resumed their normal life.
She cast one last nervous look at Harry, but it was Draco who spoke.
She turned towards the desk in the room and grabbed the back of the desk chair, dragging it towards the bed. Draco sat up, suddenly feeling exposed. She caught his eye and burst into laughter again, flopping down into the chair once she was close, and crossing her legs daintily at the knee.
“Yes, how foolish of me,” said Pansy with an eye roll. “I’m sure that’ll be nothing like the nights I had to spend with you to teach all those prying Slytherin boys a lesson. Those long, hard… games of exploding snap.”
“Stop,” commanded Voldemort, so forcefully Yaxley flinched. Voldemort rose from his chair, much stronger than he had felt in past visions. He plucked a phial off a nearby table with a pale hand and drank it, placing himself in front of an oval mirror. “Leave me.”
Voldemort took a slow step into the room and Lily flung her arms out as a shield.
“Of course… but this?” Pansy bit her lip.
“We’ll get the bastard that did this,” said Tonks. “For our future. For your parents. For my dad.”
“My mum was a ginger,” said Harry, still looking back and forth between the blurry shapes.
“The investigation into Albus Dumbledore’s affairs has nothing whatsoever to do with the governance of this school,” said McGonagall with biting coldness. “Nor have I given any permission to conduct the search that is being undertaken in this very office, and I will not consent to a single belonging being removed from this room.”
Hermione tore through it, tossing dried willow bark and something that looked like fish scales to the side. Cedric inhaled raspily from the couch and Draco cast a calming spell.
“We’re all alone, Luna. Which is why it’s important to find someone with the same aims. In the end, we all make choices for ourselves.”
He flipped the page and spotted a familiar grainy black and white picture of Dr Weaver and a child, recognising it as the same photo that appeared in the book on Obscurials.
Draco looked away, his eyes darting back to the Quidditch pitch where green clad figures were zipping around in the crisp afternoon sun. “What do you want me to say? That I’m wrong? That it’s impossible to choose a leader that will make everyone happy?”
“Stop them, you fools!” shrieked Voldemort, causing the Death Eaters to leap into action.
“Dead right,” said Harry, a warm sensation rising in his chest.
“Thought not. Word to the wise, Granger – if you want friends, don’t stick your nose where it isn’t wanted.”
“This is hopeless,” said Draco, propping his elbow up on the arm of the chair and leaning into it. “Chances are even if we successfully destroyed one, Voldemort would know what we’re doing and put a stop to it.”
“Well, come along then,” said Luna, walking straight to the door.
“Thanks for the advice,” he said, walking down the row to meet her. “What are you doing here, then?”
“What was that about your arse?” Draco bent down to kiss her on the cheek. He didn’t love Pansy, but after the day he’d had he was in the mood for some easy affection, and for that Pansy was always a willing target.
“I’m sure I remember you saying that if I could keep Angelica busy for the afternoon, you’d tell me everything first chance you got,” she said, a serious edge to her voice. “I would have revolted, except she picked out this adorable dress for me so there’s at least one win for the day.”
“Are we speculating about this Aparecium joint?” boomed a voice from the direction of the hotel bar as Blaise and Angelica walked through the vaulted archway carrying drinks.
Draco shrugged. “I have to give the backup Seeker some field time or Slytherin will be hopeless next year without me.”
The Dark Lord seemed somehow smaller than Draco remembered. He was sunken into the armchair, propped up with cushions on all sides. His skin was pasty grey and the eyes that fixed on Draco were a deep crimson. The snake rested its mammoth head on his lap, its tongue flicking out every so often, as Voldemort stroked its head with one bony hand.
“Invigoration draught, sir?” suggested the elf, holding out a phial of orange liquid in her knobby fingers.
“Harry… he’s…” Charlotte started.
“What is it you want, Draco?” asked Snape, in a quiet tone that failed to mask his suppressed fury. That numbing potion must be wearing off.
“Well, isn’t this
Dumbledore gazed at him fondly as Harry accepted the gift of a brown paper bag, opening it to pull out the queen that was sitting in front of Draco at this very moment. There was no mistaking it; this wasn’t some strange experiment of Dumbledore’s. He was gazing at Harry with an expression full of love.
Draco maintained his cool composure, pocketing the folded up
But Snape did not move. Draco clapped a hand on his professor’s shoulder and he jerked upright, his eyes dancing across Malfoy’s face, seemingly without recognition.
“Then tell me!” yelled Harry, feeling magic coursing through him but willing himself to hold it back. He’d already hurt one person tonight. “You think you can keep me in the dark and teach me little spells to keep me safe. My parents knew magic and they died, so what’s the point?”
is still there. At Hogwarts.”
“I really wish you hadn’t told me that,” said Harry, shaking his head.
“Can you be happy for once?” asked Harry, smiling like a fool. “We can still do this. We can win!”
The only light in the room was a flickering candle on the far side, casting shadows on the fading wallpaper of the modest teacher’s quarters.
“The others know. I told them finally, about what I've been hiding,” said Draco, placing the king back on the board. “It’s all out in the open now.”
This was another one of his traps. It had to be. But Harry followed his gaze just the same. A hood was yanked off and red hair spilled out from underneath.
Turning into the shop, Draco was greeted with a musty smell of old relics and dusty books. Borgin was loyal to the family and to the brethren, but Draco didn’t know him well. He’d only accompanied his father to the store on a few occasions to negotiate the price of dark artefacts the family tried to unload a few years back when the Ministry was nosing into their affairs.
“Oh, yeah, I guess so,” said Harry, taking a glance at Luna, who kept her eyes carefully trained on Ivy as she smiled.
A plan began forming over the coming days that involved a locket heist, black market Basilisk venom, and the search for the Dark Lord himself. Snow started falling heavily in London, which made it harder to go on supply runs, but somehow seemed to call for more movie nights with the team.
“Well, who would have believed it?” said Draco, striding over to Snape’s desk. “The one witness to the Dark Lord’s final moments, alive all this time. A secret that my father doesn’t even know, and it’s walked straight into my lap.”
“That, my dear, has changed,” said Umbridge, snapping open a small velvet purse and withdrawing a tight scroll of parchment which she held out with one pudgy hand. “Effective immediately, the Minister for Magic has granted me emergency powers over the school. He has appointed me the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, and it is now my sole responsibility to see to the welfare and education of its pupils while the investigation into the misdoings and corruption of the faculty is taken under consideration.”
“What do you need, Miss Lovegood,” asked Snape resentfully.
“Gone! Gone,” bemoaned Kreacher, “Gone from the family. Never to be seen again.” The others exchanged worried glances.
And what was worse, Potter had the gall to stand up to him. An uneducated half-blood who had spent most of his life in hiding. He had no idea the training and pain Draco had endured when he was learning the craft. Years spent at the hand of his master, which had given Draco a power of Legilimency that rivalled even Snape’s. The hours of mind healing required to repair the splits and fissures when his master pried too hard. The many tears his mother shed.
“Dear Merlin,” Draco said before he could stop himself.
Luna laughed brightly. “Let’s take it back to your room and look at it more closely.”
“Oh Draco,” she said, her shoulders shaking. “I am so sorry.”
Running a worried hand through his hair, he took a few long strides to the desk, scrabbling around for the Galleon Hermione had enchanted with a protean charm. Whatever differences the others were having at the moment, he was sure at least one of them would come to help Luna.
“Does this say that you can create a Hover Charm by combining the wand movement of a
“That’s how it’s done, Potter.”
“You’re the expert, are you?” Harry asked.
“It’s nothing really,” said Harry, straightening up and pushing his glasses back up his nose. “I’m happy to host you guys.”
“He went to get a book for me. We still haven’t figured out what to do about the final Horcruxes and I was worried we weren’t making enough progress, so he’s gone to look for a book I saw in a footnote that might have some of the answers we’re looking for,” Hermione took a seat next to Harry, but looked back again towards the snowy window.
“Really?” There was a strange grip in his chest.
She started undoing his belt. He scrambled to think of something to turn him on before she got much farther, but the floral smell and the tacky feeling on his lips was distracting.
“Just do it,” said Draco, shoving his friend away. “I’ll be fine. Just keep her safe.”
Draco leapt to his feet, grateful for the first time in his life for Granger’s perfect timing.
“Of course he did,” said Hermione, seething. “Alright, well, charms can be useful too. Why don’t we skip to locking and unlocking?”
Ollivander raised his eyebrows and looked back and forth between the two. Harry nodded along, hoping that Hermione knew where she was going with this.
Angelica’s hands skated over the cards as she spoke, drawing out yet another card. This one depicted a man seated under a tree with three cups at his feet. A hand reached out of a cloud hanging in thin air, offering a cup; a gift out of the blue. The four of cups. Draco was following. Each card held an implicit meaning, one that didn’t need defining if the viewer was left to interpret it from their own perspective.
“I want to try this,” said Harry, shuffling through a stack of papers on the coffee table and flipping to a chapter on deep recollection in
On one hand, Draco could sever ties and return his focus to the imminent rise of the Dark Lord. On the other, he could continue playing into the gambit, hoping for another opportunity to reveal the boy legend. He knew he ought to distance himself from the bespectacled idiot or he risked fanning the flames of whatever absurd feelings he was developing – and yet, the fact that he had returned here to the castle, seemed like a gift of sorts. A second chance.
Harry lifted the cloak off his face, smiling sheepishly, and pulled up the hem to reveal his stuck foot.
“Oh to be sure,” said Luna airily. “Sometimes I spend extra time with Professor Flitwick going over experimental charms I’m trying. He usually discourages me.”
A bolt of green light blasted from the end of Voldemort’s wand into her chest and she fell in a heap on the floor. Harry went rigid and he felt Draco recoil as well, but as a child he was not frightened. He gazed into the face of the man who approached the cot with a naïve curiosity.
But Pansy was still craning her neck to look at Harry. If they were going to get to McGonagall’s before Pansy started catching on, they were going to have to take the opening Malfoy was giving them.
“Great. Now that that’s out of the way,” said Draco, rising. “Kreacher—”
Draco stopped with the wand halfway up to his temple. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“No, if it’s not poison, that’ll put him over the edge,” said Draco, his focus locked on Cedric as his eyelids fluttered. “Any Alihotsy?”
Harry couldn’t help it. His face broke into the most ridiculous grin as he looked down at Draco, who was absolutely wrecked but at least alive.
He needed to take the opportunity to ask for what he really wanted before he lost his nerve altogether. “Will you show me what happened? Maybe I can spot something that you haven’t seen.”
“Recovering from what?” asked Draco impatiently.
“There’s too many, it’ll just be faster this way,” said Harry, crossing to the wardrobe and pulling out his robes. “Put me in my Dudley disguise and we can pop over to ask Ollivander and stop by this dark artefacts store on the way back.”
“Real funny from the bloke who invented the escape route,” said Tonks, shining her wand into a corner of the structure where a dark mass could be seen, shifting in agitation and flexing leathery wings.
“And the betrayal — was that real?”
“Really?” said Blaise. “I heard the brethren were getting called to assemble at Oxfordshire.”
“We’re a good match,” said Harry, locking eyes and reaching out his consciousness.
,” said a tall, black boy leaning into the conversation with both eyebrows raised.
“Thank you, Draco. It means a lot to me,” she said sweetly, putting on her best doe-eyed expression.
“Harry?” called Luna in a worried voice as he fell to his knees on the mossy ground.
“Beyond that, the trouble is there are almost no cases on record of any child with an Obscurus surviving past the age of ten,” said Hermione, flipping to a new section. “In one case, a reported Obscurial which had survived to young adolescence due to reported strong magical abilities, ultimately triggered an eruption of magical energy so great it levelled a small cottage and destroyed itself, and so could never be properly verified.”
“Granger reckons we’re running out of time to be solving this thing, and I think she’s right. I want to make a run to the Manor and there’s somewhere else we should go. It’s a place called Wisteria Hall,” Draco paused, but Harry was still listening attentively, waiting for the punchline. “It’s where the Dark Lord is currently living. And it belongs to my family.”
When Narcissa didn’t come down for dinner, Draco pretended it was perfectly normal for him and his father to eat silently together in the vast marble dining room. But as soon as he could, he made his way to her room and found her dozing in a four-poster bed, draped with burgundy curtains.
Harry moved his knight to take Draco’s Queen
Kreacher fiddled with the heavy locket around his neck. “Master is saying that Harry Potter is Kreacher’s master from now on.”
Theo stopped his frantic stirring and turned to listen. Draco was careful to keep his face expressionless, but he knew all four of his friends probably felt the same as he did – it had, after all, been the first death they had witnessed.
“Fuck, nevermind,” he muttered under his breath. His eyes darted around nervously, his black school robes billowing around him as he walked.
“No, I mean – nevermind,” said Harry, sitting up and setting the diadem on the table. He told the others all about the vision, everything he could remember that diadem Hermione had said about Horcruxes and everything he remembered from the alternate timeline – everything except Draco.
he thought.
“She’s full of surprises,” managed Draco, casting a loving yet chaste expression in her direction. “Have you played this course before, Mr DuPont?” Draco knew for a fact he hadn’t, but he needed to get some footing in the conversion if he was going to make a good impression.
There was a pop and Harry found himself blinking as though he’d just looked into a camera flash.
“If it’s not there,” continued Draco, shifting to place a map of the Hall at the top of the stack on the coffee table. “We’ll head to the Hall, notifying Granger on the Galleon to go set up the diversion.”
Harry paused. “Regulus knew the Dark Lord, too. And he faced him in his own way. Imagine what he and the Order could have accomplished together.”
“You have it in you to plan a rebellion against him too!” said Harry. “What’s the difference?”
said Ivy, who had laid her head down to rest on the back of Harry’s hand. Her tongue flicked out against his skin.
This chapter contains a discussion of mental health, including child abuse. Proceed with caution.
“Good,” said the Dark Lord, lowering his wand. “On your knees.”
“Naturally,” said Draco, already aware that his team was on top of the league’s current ranking. “I support Puddlemere United.”
“Well, I’m back now, aren’t I? Dying for some sleep actually,” said Draco, steering her towards the bed.
Pansy laughed and sat back in her chair. “Well, it’s good to see you back to your old ways, at any rate. What goes down must come up!”
“Hermione. Glasses. Can’t see,” said Harry as the blond shape came looming into view.
“Seeing as we’ve already got a standing score, I was thinking you and Malfoy,” said Cedric, inclining his head towards the blond.
“What would your father say?” asked Draco, feigning interest while trying to position himself behind Angelica, so nothing looked off from Mr DuPont’s vantage point. Her small, insistent hand was creeping up his chest.
“I think I already know the answer, but can I show you who he was? Just to be sure,” said Harry. Draco looked up to meet his uncertain gaze.
And with that, Voldemort relinquished the hold he had on Harry’s mind. Harry pulled back, receding from the vision of the crimson eyes, back into the room at Grimmauld Place.
As Draco tipped into the memory, he found himself in the now familiar park, which was golden with summer sunlight. Harry was older and taller than he had been the night he’d first hidden out here when he met the man in the tweed suit, but not by much.
,” said Hermione, emphasising the last word in Draco’s direction before turning to leave as the bard strummed a melancholy cord and wandered into a still life painting of fruits.
“There’s nothing that could make me go back,” said Draco.
“She says she’s alright,” said Harry to Charlotte. “She doesn’t know where her home is.”
“This can work,” said Harry, reaching for Draco’s hand.
“The enchantments are too strong. Perhaps if I were to hold on to the item, I could source a specialist?”
He was about to knock on the door and make his demands when a voice behind him said, “Bare your fangs too early and you’ll give yourself away.”
Draco blinked to get his bearings. The room looked like a strong wind had blown through it, toppling a few chairs and knocking books and papers onto the ground. Harry had sweat on his forehead and his dark brows were pressed together in a scowl directed at Draco.
“Not much,” said Harry, reaching for a spoon off of an abandoned dinner plate. “But check this out. If I cast a softening charm –
What was more worrying about this lapse of judgement was how close he was letting Potter get. He had guessed there was something off about the Manor. Draco was only fortunate he wasn’t a better Legilimens, otherwise he would have known the truth. The presence that had been a constant at the castle these last many years and the master that had taught Draco the very skill he was passing along to Harry was none other than the Dark Lord himself.
“I’m not really supposed to leave the room,” he said, fighting his desperation to get outside of the castle for a brief moment, but not wanting to get Luna in trouble.
Draco hummed in agreement, trying to concentrate on deciphering the document in his hands. He could feel Greenacre’s eyes scrutinising him from across the desk.
A strange expression crossed Draco’s face, but he quickly masked it with his regular look of neutrality.
She could hear his even, measured breathing and told herself that he would be alright. She wasn’t even sure if she’d remember tomorrow where he was or how to find him, based on the strength of the charm. But she was determined to see him return to their world in his lifetime, and she silently promised that to him and to herself.
“Get to the point, Potter,” said Draco, casting a set of serious Un-Sticking Charms around his foot.
“Ivy,” said Luna.
“My love,” said Lucius, wrapping her tightly in his arms. “What’s done is done. What can I say to make this right?”
“And I suppose… I’m sorry as well,” Draco heard himself say. “Your over-helpfulness comes from a good place, even though it can be bloody annoying at times.”
“Not enough time to explain,” he said, hugging her back tightly and quickly pulling away to look at her straight on. “Did you get everything I asked?”
“I intend to find out everything there is to know about Voldemort,” said Harry. Malfoy physically took a step back at the name. “It’s more than just the death of my parents. It’s personal now. If he’s coming after me I deserve to know why, and if he’s going to try and make some example out of me I need to figure out how to defeat him.”
“Are you saying that you’re running the business behind the scenes?”
Draco hardly felt the pain, as the skin on the back of his hand was cut open and in a moment his signature was glistening menacingly on the page in his own blood.
Hermione stopped in her tracks. “Why are you so keen to help Harry, anyway?”
They escorted Harry deeper and deeper into the house, down long hallways lined with narrow oriental rugs and portraits of people who looked like they had died rich, until at last they came upon an archway leading through to a room that was so familiar Harry felt that he had already been there.
Draco’s fingers trailed lightly over Harry’s forehead, moving a stray lock of hair out of his eyes. The moon shone brightly through Regulus’s window, and Draco could make out the faint lightning bolt shape of the scar.
“Please, that’s about as subtle as a punch in the face,” said Angelica with an eye roll, collecting the card and resuming her shuffling. “He wanted to see me married, settled. I wanted control. So I started looking for eligible partners in the states. There are a lot of degenerates with illustrious family names out there, let me tell you. But my criteria were simple. I wanted someone who had their own interests, so I could keep to mine.”
“I am honoured, my lord,” said Draco, as the cold hand closed around his wrist and the point of a wand was dragged down the pale skin of his forearm.
“And I’ll tell you something else,” interrupted DuPont. “Andrew Carnegie, he was an early American businessman. Lots of crossover with some of our family as well back in those days, Angie. Muggle, of course, so he stuck to steel. Anyway, turns out he was Scottish descent, which is why he bought this place a few hundred years ago.”
“I don’t understand it. You had it over the weekend,” said Hermione, deflated.
“Harry, it’s going to be us versus these two, but I think we can take ‘em,” said Angelica jubilantly. “We’ll play all 18 holes together, and tally up our scores on both sides.”
“Good news, I caught McGonagall before she had to go off to another counsel meeting and – what’s so funny?” asked Cedric as they took in the other three, who were in varying states of laughter, Luna rolling on the floor.
“Were you seriously going to let me go much farther?” she asked incredulously.
“I’ll even let you choose who we kill first,” he said, ghosting a kiss across her lips. “Who will it be? Granger? Then you won’t have to compete with her any more for my affec—”
at the chair. “I only mean, if you intend to keep this a secret from Granger, you should only practise spells you can counter. Otherwise she’ll wonder why there are so many melted spoons around.”
Lucius raised an eyebrow at his son, pondering as he chewed. “Because the Dark Lord has put a significant level of trust in this family, ever since we proved our commitment during the first war.”
“All of them. But don’t worry, even the advanced ones are pretty simple. We tried them all out just to be sure.”
“Got it,” he said.
” said Cedric, pointing his wand down the hall, where a small force pushed Draco back a few paces. “See the wand movement there, Harry? It’s like a peak—”
“Nonsense, you really need a good cup of coffee if you’re going to play well at this hour. I should know!” boomed Mr DuPont. Angelica nodded along. “Two black coffees for us and uh, what do you think Harry would like?”
“Always great to have your support, father.” Draco gripped his gloved hands. “But I get the sense there’s something more you want to talk about. The
“He’s not to be punished,” said Harry, his confidence wavering slightly as the demonic eyes bored into him, now hooded by a scowl. “He was coerced. Into helping me.”
“Alright,” said Harry, taking a seat. “I think I know what I’m in for. If anything happens to me, promise me you’ll still go after Charlotte?”
“Leave it to Al to give me one last puzzle to solve,” said Harry fondly, pulling a few items off the top layer of the box and holding up a spindly silver instrument that looked like a stick bug. “He was always telling me crazy stories about his life, I just never could have imagined they were about this place.”
“How could I? I’m under the Fidelius Charm, remember?” said Draco over a lump in his throat.
“I told you, I was chasing up that lead of my mother’s,” he said, shortly.
“You called?” said another voice from the kitchen as an identical redhead emerged. Then it clicked; these two had been Gryffindor’s Beaters, the Weasley twins.
Harry felt the tenseness in his shoulders relax slightly, but Draco didn’t look at him, he kept his eyes fixed on Hermione who groaned in annoyance.
“And that’s not all,” said Blaise, reclining to scrutinise his friends. “There’s a column on the change in legislature around Dementor control, and a small section on the unusual migratory pattern of giants. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say someone was gathering an army.”
“Not if she put it that way,” said Draco. “Would you?”
“Harry hasn’t been saying anything strange, has he?” Draco asked in a casual tone. “Only because I read in the paper that he got a serious confundus to the head on his last case, and the
“It’s fine, Hermione,” said Harry, walking towards the bed and pulling the robes off over his head. “No harm done. I’m more concerned that I have to keep using this old wand for defensive spells tomorrow.”
“Tell us everything,” said Harry.
“Oh! That reminds me,” said Umbridge, rummaging in her purse again and withdrawing a stack of parchment, which she started shuffling through, laying out page after page in front of McGonagall. “Ah yes… Here is the search warrant, granting me rights to detain any item in the castle relevant to the criminal case against Albus Dumbledore…”
“Homesick?” asked Hermione.
Harry could feel an energy rushing through him. He couldn’t tell if it was relief at controlling his magic for the first time, or excitement at the accomplishment, or the energy of the magic itself. But he hadn’t felt this proud of something he’d created since he’d written his first piece of code under Mr Salerni’s teaching.
Harry felt a light tugging at his jeans and looked down to see Kreacher’s leathery old face looking up at him curiously.
“I was thinking…” she said in a low voice, as a hand slipped under the hem of his shirt and feathered across his waist. “What if we get away together for my last weekend? Maybe go up to London and get a hotel?”
Much to his surprise, the trick ear worked a treat. McGonagall was a fool for keeping her meetings in her own office when the Headmaster’s office was warded to the teeth, but all the better for Draco.
“What does that tell you, Harry?”
“How could you?” he asked over shuddering breaths. “How could you do that to Charlotte? You had to want to!”
“Why don’t you just have her practice charms then?” said Draco. “You can’t be there all the time, and I’m sure Potter would appreciate seeing a new face every once in a while.”
“A prophecy which said you have the power to vanquish me,” Voldemort took a few steps from his chair, gliding over the gleaming tile floor towards Harry. “And a prophecy which occurred just as I was rising to power and just as a group of unsanctioned vigilantes began to fight against Ministry decree. And wouldn’t you know it, the sole recipient of the prophecy from a fraud of a seer, was none other than Albus Dumbledore himself?”
Hermione lowered her book pointedly and fixed him with a quizzical look. Harry smiled sheepishly in return.
“Is it a muggle term?” Draco asked before he could stop himself
“Then why bother coming at all, Smith?” said a pretty red-headed witch who rolled her eyes and reminded Harry very much of Charlotte. “Feel free to run home to mummy and we’ll finish the job without you, alright?”
He stored it in his school bag, hopeful that the others would see it as a gesture of good faith and be able to look past his wrongs if he came clean.
“If you had said that in the first place,” muttered Harry.
“Well, I’ve been hogging him all week, so I thought that would give you some time to get to know each other.”
He felt a tugging at his consciousness, pulling him out of the memory. He could feel the pedals of the bike melting away as he blinked his eyes to find himself back in the strange castle, being stared at quizzically by Draco Malfoy.
“Who’s not there?” hissed Hermione under her breath.
“What do you think I’m patrolling the halls for?” said Draco.
Snape’s head was still dipped below the waterline, as Draco dragged him out of the Pensieve. He must have fallen asleep in a memory loop, which was a dangerous habit. Lesser wizards had been known to slip away, losing touch with reality this way. But as Draco positioned him in the chair, Snape’s eyelids fluttered.
“There is no conceivable plan where I make it out of this alive,” said Draco, his voice catching as he held Harry at arm’s length. “Believe me, I’ve thought about it. If there was anything I could give the Dark Lord that would let him set you free – I would give it. But he will hunt you to the ends of the earth and once I’m no use to him, he’ll kill me. So the least I can do with what I’ve got left is get that fucking diary for you and hope to Merlin you find a way to destroy him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I find that most of life’s problems can be solved with chocolate,” said a voice, though Draco was surprised to find it sounded distorted.
“Here it is,” said Blaise, already paging through. “They have a ‘65 vintage of Ogden’s Old.”
“Right,” said Harry, realising the implications for Luna and feeling a pang of empathy.
“Neither have I,” mused Lucius. “Though she had a penchant for divination back in her day. The brethren are taking the news as a lucky stroke this time but our Lord is of course a deeply suspicious man. If your mother does not come up with another prediction about the boy’s whereabouts soon, I worry that I may not be able to protect her from his curiosity.”
“Sounds like you know more than the rest of us,” said Harry. “Now’s not the time to be keeping secrets.”
Unless he was very much mistaken, Draco thought he saw a flush tinge Harry’s cheeks just before he was sucked into the memory.
“Is it true,” Blaise demanded in a hushed voice, holding Draco by the shoulder to steady him. “Have you sided with the enemy?”
“Yeah, it was stupid.” Harry rubbed at his eyes under his glasses. “I was just looking for someone to blame. But it was my own fault in the end for putting Charlotte at risk like that. If I hadn’t been selfish, they wouldn’t have her now.”
Harry sat up abruptly in his bed. Love?
Luna’s voice rang out in the room, and the others stopped speaking instantaneously.
“There is someone… someone I want to protect. I didn’t believe it at first, and in fact I almost bungled the whole thing up except – I think I have another chance. But I’m worried I might have figured it out too late. I can’t join the brethren and have him, it's one or the other.”
“Right. And I suppose Malfoy is just busy preparing for the Ravenclaw game,” said Harry, leaning back in his chair feigning disinterest. Luna turned another page. “Is he?”
“Yes… Luna, Neville, Ginny, pretty much all of Dumbledore’s Army are still there. Doing what you trained them for,” said Hermione, a hint of suspicion now creeping into her voice.
“Careful, there’s a trick—”
“Now Harry,” said McGonagall in a softer tone. “Do remember that you’re here for your protection. I’m afraid any type of communication with the outside world would be too dangerous, as it might reveal where you are.”
“I don’t owe him anything,” hissed Draco under his breath.
He finished with a tone of finality, tilting his head to regard her over his glasses as if speaking to a misbehaving student.
He felt a gnawing sensation of being on the edge of a decision he would later regret. If everything went according to plan, wouldn’t he be playing right into the expectations Potter had laid out to him? Potter, who at this moment was looking on calmly with his hands in his pockets, wearing an infuriating expression like he knew what Draco was thinking. Draco glared back. Was he really destined to follow in the steps of his father, after all?
“I hear your tone, Professor,” said Draco, his eyes following Snape with displeasure. “Your implications are noted. What I don’t hear are any suggestions for how to dive deeper into Potter’s psyche and pull out the memories I need for the Dark Lord.”
“They’re invisible?” he asked, as Luna began stroking the air, and placed Harry’s hand on a solid, warm patch of nothing. He could feel a smooth coat of hair, and the slow, measured breathing of a great animal.
Draco arrived back at the Manor with the house-elf that had picked him up from the station.
“Mother,” said Draco under his breath. If Narcissa had the locket, it could be in a dozen different places. He knew his mother sold many of the family’s dark relics to shift Ministry suspicion from them, but it could easily be at home in the Manor or in the vaults where he’d already been. Wherever it was, there was no way he could get close enough to his mother to ask. “What did mother do with it, did she say?”
Despite growing up at the Manor, he’d never really had his own slice of the world. Sure there was his room, but his mother and the house-elves saw that the only possessions there were fashionable, fitting of his class. And pretty much every other part of the house had the feeling of oppressive ownership by his father or otherwise by
“It’s honestly just conjecture. I don’t even think—” started Harry, trying to downplay the situation as much as possible. He was positive if Hermione had found the list she would have snapped his wand by now.
Snape looked at them, but his gaze seemed far away. “There are things you don’t understand. The veil grows worn and thin, Draco. When the mirror looks both ways, I’m afraid…”
“What do you have to hide, hm?” said the cold, high voice.
“Oh man, you should see your face,” said Charlotte through her laughter. “You’re a mess.”
“And you really believe that?” said Pansy, raising her eyebrows. “And what, pray, were the terms of this bet?”
Mentally cursing Laverne de Montmorency, mysterious intruders, and Yousef’s turtles for his pitiful lack of sleep, he pulled back the covers and draped a tartan dressing gown over his shoulders. This had better be worth it.
“What was it like?” asked Harry, pulling his feet up onto the chair.
“The snake in the terrarium?” asked Cedric as Hermione rolled her eyes dramatically.
“It’s a secret then?”
“You know as well as I do that our Lord seeks this boy,” said Snape, tossing the snapped quill to the side. “That puts us in a very precarious situation. We must balance our knowledge of this affair with strategic timing. At the moment, it would be disadvantageous to reveal that we know anything, until it becomes clear what the boy is.”
“If he’s dangerous, we have to turn him over to the Ministry, Professor. We can’t afford to risk the other students’ safety.”
Malfoy tilted his head as he studied Harry, his long fingers drumming on the arm of the sofa. “Alright, let’s try that. Show me a time when the little guy won.”
“Just friend, actually.” Harry was not sure why he felt the urge to make this clear.
“Whatever you like then, you know what memories you have better than I do.”
Hermione turned to Draco, wrapping him in a hug that had him looking momentarily stunned. “We’ll notify you on the Galleon if anything goes wrong.”
But even the kiss Draco could see coming from a mile away. No, what was surprising was that for a brief moment after the kiss, Potter’s thoughts shifted to him.
The only potential hurdle remaining between him and a deep sleep was a certain bubbly blonde. As he stepped into the lift, he silently prayed that Angelica would be out cold so he could spend the rest of the night in relative peace.
The two sat in a silent truce for several minutes before the man in the tweed suit reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, wrapped chocolate, laying it on the empty bench seat next to him.
“I’ll go,” said Harry. “It’s my fault. What do we need?”
The second name on the list he recognised was harder to reconcile. Written in a tight script was the name Luca F. Calderone. Lestrange he could at least make sense of, but Calderone was certainly criminal underworld. Judging by these two names alone, Draco could surmise something nefarious about the rest of names on the list, and felt slightly sick at the thought of it.
“Well, it’s only been a few lessons that you’ve gotten the new wand under control, maybe under a bit more supervision—” began Hermione.
he said, with a chilling softness to his voice.
Draco was fiddling with Sirius’s makeshift battery which had gone on the fritz and was trying to figure out a spell to repair it, lest the rest of the group revolt for lack of a good distraction. He nodded as an ethereal female voice started singing about crystal visions and Harry came to flop down in his chair opposite.
Draco’s jaw dropped, which Pansy apparently took as immediate confirmation of the fact and not pure abject horror. Of all the secrets she might have guessed, this was not the one he had in mind. He struggled to find the words.
“Research on Occlusion for our pupil,” lied Draco. “Can’t imagine you’d check it out for me?”
“Professor!” he shouted. “You’re alright professor, can you hear me?”
“It’s fine,” Harry said weakly. “What’s wrong?”
“I think he would have settled for a normal life,” said Draco.
“At last,” said Draco, taking a sip of wine as his free hand clenched under the table.
“What exactly are you suggesting, Albus? That we truly let him live his life as a Muggle?” Minerva was unable to break her gaze from the piercing green eyes一Lily’s eyes.
Cedric only came on the weekends, and McGonagall almost never stopped by. Maybe it was Malfoy?
“Precisely,” Draco said. “Any ideas, Potter?”
Saying nothing, the man simply held out a hand and waved the unruly pack away. The boys fell silent, and a few moments later the soft sound of trainers leaving the park in an orderly manner could be heard. Harry tried to hold his breath, hoping the old man hadn’t spotted him and wouldn’t force him to go back home.
“You sounded like you were having a vision. Are you alright?” she asked, reaching out a hand in his direction.
“Look at me, Draco,” said Pansy in a serious tone, putting a hand on his shoulder. “What’s off is that Angelica is over somewhere dancing by herself and you’re sitting over here worrying about Harry.”
“You too,” he murmured as it jostled out into the cool night air, stretching out its leathery wings to their full length.
Sitting back and trying to catch his breath for a moment, he found his face was suddenly wet with hot tears. He rubbed at them with the sleeve of his jumper, feeling a twinge of pain, and pushed his sleeves up to see his wrists turning black and blue in the shape of massive fingerprints.
“Don’t bother,” called Harry, a smile spreading across his face as he aimed down the corridor. “I’d rather see what you’ve got.”
“I only mean to say that I can see I’m in a disadvantageous negotiating position. You clearly know more than I do in this situation, but you wouldn’t be here if there wasn’t still something I could provide that would make it worth your while. Tell me what it is, and I’ll see if we can come to an agreement.”
“It fits,” said Draco, remembering the bruises on Harry’s wrists.
“At first I just assumed Dumbledore had kept the Fidelius to conceal his own misdeeds, but I’ve known for weeks now that there’s more to this case,” said Cedric, pulling a black notebook out of the pocket of his uniform. “The Ministry has been hiding evidence of You-Know-Who’s attempts to return for years. I think Dumbledore was onto it and his death was an effort to keep him silenced.”
“It was luck,” said George, leading the way to the back. “I’ll never forgive Ginny for coming down with the fleurian flu the week of our last game.”
“Poor thing fancies me,” said Draco. “She’s got a ploy to spend time with me where she’s offered to tutor me in any subject I’m behind. I reckon I’ll nick her best notes for us, eh?”
“Have a look, Malfoy, but I don’t think it’s the one we saw in Dumbledore’s memory.”
“Me?” snapped Hermione. “I didn’t teach him a Stinging Jinx.”
Even the holly wand, which had been so temperamental with him over the past few days, was warming up. He was holding a sustained
He sat up quickly, looking around to see whether his mother or anyone else familiar was around. This was perhaps the home of a family he and the brethren were sent to interrogate, or worse.
“I’ll be careful, Hermione,” said Harry. “The faster I learn, the faster I’ll be out of your hair and we can all go back to our normal lives.”
“Run,” said Harry to Charlotte under his breath. His pulse rising.
“Stinging Hex? Real mature,” said Draco, shoving his sleeve back down.
This was… true. Draco had seen the archival family histories in the Manor library, which told of such ties, though his father had done his best to bury these facts in the years leading up to the war. How could a wizard from halfway around the world possibly be aware of this?
“Yeah, well, if I don’t finish this essay for McGonagall she’s going to pull me out of NEWT levels and then I won’t be much use at all,” said Draco, sounding a little more defensive than Harry was used to.
Big shoutout again to my beta, Honeybeet, who spots all of my plot holes and grammar mistakes. H also supplied a few of the great names in this chapter like Flamel & Sons!
“My dear, fellow! I’ve been waiting for your return,” said a sprightly voice from behind him.
Then, without warning, she lept off of him. His eyes snapped open, and he quickly propped himself up on his elbows to see what had happened. She stood by the foot of the bed, laughing as she pulled the robe back around her slight frame.
“That doesn’t change the fact that their defence is rubbish. Right, Potter?” said Malfoy.
And just like that, the conversation easily shifted from Draco’s family to the team’s plans for the cup. The group did not turn on him like they had done so many weeks before. They trusted him. A sense of relief opened like a floodgate that he didn’t know he was holding onto. If he’d known it would be this easy, he would have done it sooner.
“Gone to London to speak with the Wizengamot. Your attackers caused quite a ruckus, they say You-Know-Who has announced his return,” said Hermione, looking nervously at the other two. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
It wasn’t until Luna brought him
So far, everything in Malfoy’s plan had panned out. For a split second, Harry considered whether he ought to deviate and head for the south coast like he’d originally thought. But Malfoy had been insistent that they head to London for “more options” from their point of departure.
“What do you need, Malfoy?” asked Cedric.
“If you’ve quite finished, I must resume this grading.”
“We were just finishing our coffee and then we tee off at 10,” said Angelica. “We got one for you if you like.”
“That’s it. Saving the world is on pause until we can figure it out,” joked Harry, jumping into the chair opposite.
Draco could feel a flutter of panic, but he knew deep down that he had already decided. A decade ago, his father had walked into this office, maybe even sat in this chair, and initiated a deal that had the potential to save his family from ruin. And now, that same deal would finally pay dividends. Draco may not have had control over the circumstances that had led his family to the brink, but he would not be the one to leave their name in debt.
” trailed off into frustrated scribbles. Perhaps his mother would sense something unusual in the vagueness and he could attempt to share further details over time. Did a Fidelius Charm weaken with age?
Hermione turned to him in a whirl of curls, searching his face with a pained expression. “Poor Harry,” she said, biting her lip. “And to think, in another life he would have been a hero.”
she asked, flicking her tongue out and raising her head a few inches off the desk.
“There is a dark artefacts store in Diagon Alley, but that’s all the way in London,” said Hermione, biting her thumbnail in thought.
The room sat in silence as Ollivander’s face softened. He gazed into Harry’s eyes with a knowing look.
“No, I’m sick of holding my tongue,” said Hermione, shoving Cedric’s hand off and taking a step towards the couches. “The rest of you may have had stars in your eyes for Mr Perfect, but I for one have seen right through you from the beginning. Why don’t you tell the truth for once, Malfoy. You’re not even here to help Harry, are you?”
“I see,” said Draco with an eye roll. “That’ll be the time the groundskeeper’s Norwegian Ridgeback got loose and burned down the herbology greenhouse.”
“I’m sorry to say I don’t, though my mother says my father spoke of you fondly.”
She reached down to tap the line that read “
“Look, this isn’t the moon of Endor, Harry,” said Cedric, sitting forward to lean on his knees, and looking very much like the adult of the group. “It’s not like we’ll be able to roll a log and defeat the empire.”
“Do you think Quirrell knew he was a Horcrux?” asked Cedric.
“You suspect I had something to do with that?” said Voldemort, placing a pale hand on his chest and feigning innocence. “Very well. Is that all?”
“At least they’ll be making decisions. You’ve heard Cedric, the Wizengamot has been in gridlock for months,” said Draco, throwing his hands up. “They’re wasting time when they could be organising to protect us. They did the same thing in the first war and look where they ended up – they were helpless in the end. Fudge has his arm twisted behind his back, held hostage by voters. A strong leader would take charge; lay down the law.”
“I have a few ideas about that,” said Draco, moving his queen-side knight into position to protect his centre pawn. “I have a hunch about how we can get the locket and the diary in one day, but it’s a wild scheme. It would depend on a lot of things going our way and Cedric and Hermione participating.”
Draco and Harry both knew that in the wake of Voldemort’s destruction, the Death Eaters had not truly disbanded. There were those who believed he could never die. Maybe there always would be.
Luna looked like she was about to respond, but at that moment, Professor Lockhart, who had resumed his reading with gusto, suddenly broke off.
“I do! And I’m so glad you’ve finally noticed,” she said, pausing in her shuffling to extend her hand. “So have we got a deal?”
“What, like it’s that easy now?” said Harry, with a laugh. “You spend your entire life keeping secrets and then you’re an open book all of a sudden.”
“I just thought I’d see if you wanted company for dinner,” she replied, hovering by the door. “My father and I used to have dinner together every Sunday, so it occurred to me you might be missing your family.”
“I think I can manage,” replied Harry, without turning to look at him. For a moment, Draco was fixed on the green eyes and dark brows as Harry lined up his shot. He was reminded of the same fiery look of focus when they used to dive head to head for the snitch.
“He’s all yours, Pansy,” said Draco, quickly adopting his usual cavalier facade and throwing a trademark grin in her direction. “Professor Snape and I were just finishing an extremely compelling conversation on the best way to draw blood from a bloodstone.” He could feel Snape shift behind him. “But anyway, I’m off to the Quidditch pitch for practice.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, shaking his head to clear the thought. The task at hand was too important. “How come you haven’t destroyed this one yet? Seems like a hell of a thing to carry around.”
Harry’s anger melted away, leaving a dark emptiness after it.
“No, I meant growing up there,” said Harry.
“It was from Neville.” Luna turned back to the plant wistfully.
“If the plan is any good I can vouch for you to the others. We don’t need to all be friends for this to work I’m assuming.”
As Harry’s memories materialised around him, Draco realised he was on a pitch of some sort. His heart was racing and Muggles, bundled up against the cold, were cheering from rickety stands close by. Harry looked down to a black and white ball at his feet, about the size of a Quaffle, and kicked it.
What he had not planned on was Angelica owling Harry Potter to extend an invitation to this excursion.
“Ah. Draco,” said a cold voice from around the chair. “Come into the light, where I can see you.”
The only explanation was that it had to be something about Harry, perhaps even something to do with one of his bursts of magic. But a child that young? Inconceivable.
If it had only been the two of them, Harry would have tried to tip himself into Draco’s mind, to see what complex gears were turning behind those silver eyes. He knew what no one else in the group did; the person taking the biggest risk tomorrow would be the one who belonged to the Dark Lord.
“I can’t imagine a megalomaniac would bother keeping hidden all this time though.” Hermione frowned at the mountain of paperwork in front of them. “We may not be dealing with You-Know-Who at all, it could just be a group of fundamentalist followers, or a copycat even.”
“That reminds me,” said Harry, turning to fix Draco with a questioning look. “How did you go with digging up any information on the DuPont deal?”
“Nothing will ever be enough for him,” said Snape. Draco turned to see his professor, still seated, though the bind was wearing thin, staring at the ceiling with tear tracks down his cheeks.
“Oh, to be sure. I’ve seen counterfeits, but none come close to the real thing.” Borgin levitated the ring off the table so it tumbled in a slow circle midair. “I’d never fail to identify a pure-blood heirloom such as this. This is the Gaunt family ring.”
“I’m really nervous about it, Professor,” said Hermione at an emergency meeting in McGonagall’s classroom. “Does this mean anyone can just walk up to the room and find Harry?”
As Harry struggled against the wards on the door, he could see the faint blue crackle of magic and his pulse started to rise.
“What? Of course not,” said Draco, getting his bearings and giving their shared cauldron a stir. Luckily he could brew a draught of Dreamless Sleep with his eyes closed. Snape was slowly making his rounds to check, and he couldn’t afford to stay after class either – he had a session with Harry where he was determined to delve into deeper memories.
“Not this again,” said Harry, glancing behind them, where past the sweeping windows, the crowds of people in the club continued their merriment.
It couldn’t be any worse than what had already come before, but somehow Harry was more concerned about what Draco might see in himself than what the others would see in the world the diadem revealed.
He remembered now. The prophecy that had fuelled Voldemort’s desire to kill the one who might usurp him, it hadn’t stopped with the Potters. He’d set a death sentence on any wizarding family that had a child born in the prophesied year, intending to wipe out any chance of rebellion, but Draco’s parents had saved him, sending him instead to live with the cousin who’d been blasted off the family tree.
“She protected me,” said Harry, his brows knitting together. Why did he feel like he was defending her action? He didn’t know how she had done it, but there was much about magic that he didn’t yet comprehend. This at least, he knew in his heart to be true. “I feel like you of all people could understand how important that is.”
“Nicely done!” boomed Mr DuPont. “I think that puts us in the lead, Angie.”
Occlumency lessons? This was strange. Draco wasn’t aware of anyone else his age who had been instructed in the art, and his tutelage had only come as a precaution at his mother’s request. All elite members of the brethren were instructed in the basics of shielding, but it was taught with a sole purpose in mind.
“It’ll be fun,” said Harry from under the cloak. “Get a little fresh air, unmask the Dark Lord, destroy part of his soul. Just a regular Saturday in my books.”
“Good to hear you haven’t written me off as hopeless,” said Harry, thrilled to get back into a sparring match with Cedric after his last disastrous attempt.
Knowing he might not get the chance again, he took another running jump and ploughed into the childhood memory, thinking it might link him back to something Harry was really protecting, when he felt a push like a wave washing over him and found himself back in the castle, opposite a very cross present-day Harry.
Draco tried to suppress a strangled cry of pain, but it was too late. Pansy was right on top of him. Her small hand clamped onto his wrist and she dragged the sleeve of his robes up.
Pansy paused for a minute, searching his face. “Whatever you want,” she said finally. “At any rate, I’m dying to see what Aparecium is all about. I’ve heard it’s positively opulent. I read in Witch Weekly that the owner had the entire interior imported from a baroque villa in the north of Italy. They say it was smuggled across borders in suitcases with undetectable extension charms.”
Al had gripped his arm with a damaged and curled up hand, and shoved a cold stone shape into his fist. It was days later when Harry was going through the pockets of his jacket that he’d discovered the spare black king; Al’s parting gift.
Harry looked from Hermione to McGonagall and back for some sign of encouragement. Hermione mimed a peaked wand movement.
“Well, if everyone’s going to be wearing Muggle clothes, why can’t I?”
was steadily climbing.
“No!” screamed Voldemort, stumbling to his feet and taking a few lurching steps forward. “Nagini, stop them!”
Harry blinked patiently. “Yes, Hermione.”
“You can’t be serious—” Minerva began.
“Yaxley and Carrow,” said Harry, straining to remember. “They were waiting for us at the train station. I tried to fight them off but all I know is bloody defensive magic.”
“I know how he came back,” said Cedric, taking a few paces across the room and throwing a file down on the table over top of Draco’s work.
“And I’m going to finish you,” said Harry, aiming his wand as his magic crackled around him.
They did not speak as Minerva and Albus prepared the complex spellwork, nor after the charm was cast. Hagrid hung about, shifting from one foot to another and casting worried looks back at the bundle of blankets. When they had finished their pact, they parted ways, Hagrid taking to the skies with a roar of the motorcycle and Dumbledore restoring the lights of the street lamps before Apparating away with a crack.
Cedric and Hermione exchanged a wordless glance which threatened to make Harry’s temper rise, but he suppressed it, if only to maintain control of the spell long enough to learn something else.
What’s more, Cedric had started reporting alarming advances in the Ministry’s inquiry against Dumbledore. The Headmaster’s cause of death was ruled as accidental, with no investigation of homicide. Luckily, the memories that Dawlish and Mercer had attempted to extract yielded nothing except Dumbledore’s favourite recipe for banana bread and a rude limerick, but that didn’t deter the department from throwing everything they had at the case.
Pansy gasped in horror, and Draco winced just to catch sight of the thing before shoving her roughly off and pulling his sleeve back down. He hardly even recognised it as his own arm. Skin was peeling away in patches as though burned and the mark was cut so deeply into his flesh it was ringed with a deep red groove. He would never live to forget this act. Ever.
And the scar. The same scar that had wracked him with years of guilt and confusion had been given to him intentionally. If the accident had been a lie, how could he trust anything he’d been told? He screwed his eyes up and tried for the millionth time to conjure the memory of the green flash, to prove Luna wrong if nothing else.
“Great, what are we learning?” asked Draco.
Massive thanks again to my beta, Honeybeet, who asks all the right questions and gives me the encouragement I need to keep at it. Thanks as well to my friends M & E, who do not even ship this, but read each chapter diligently and lovingly. And to my roomie, Z, who provided all the good golf and tarot knowledge. You guys are the best!
“Thank you,” he breathed.
“The others will never understand,” he said, in a voice that sounded strangely unlike his own.
How very brave and how very foolish, thought Draco, watching Harry as he trailed a hand lightly over the phials, turning them to expose spindly inscribed labels.
“Too true,” said the bard, tapping his temple knowingly. “Exactly why I choose this time to write. No one around to disrupt the muse.”
Harry hustled to keep up with Draco, laughing under his breath and asking, “If all goes according to plan, can we get milkshakes on the way back?”
she asked, aghast.
Harry hugged his arms around his legs, resting his forehead on his knees and forcing himself to imagine being somewhere else, when there was a sudden patter of footfalls and the chatter of a gang of boys could be heard entering the park.
“I’d still rather live in the mansion with the overbearing parents, thanks,” said Harry.
Harry had shaken Al off, thinking he’d finally lost it to old age. Still, the urgency in his voice and the deep concern in his eyes had Harry worried. In a fleeting moment, as Harry turned his back on the old man, stalking his way back to Privet Drive, he found himself suddenly face to face with the old man once again.
“Speak to me,” said the cold voice. “I do not wish to hurt you. Only to know you.”
“Do I disgust you?” he asked.
“There is a rumour,” McGonagall continued, choosing her words carefully. “That the Dark Lord’s attempt to annihilate this child, was what caused his own downfall. A rebound of the Killing Curse, something never seen by our kind.”
Despite the rigidity of the pieces, Draco knew exactly what he was looking at. This was a wizard's chess set. The hum of the magic was enough to make Draco think this might be the link they had been looking for to the only wizards Harry had ever known; his parents. Without wasting another moment, he flexed the full force of his Legilimency, and ploughed ahead into the memories of the chessboard.
Draco massaged the bridge of his nose. This would not be an easy year if everyone but him lost the plot.
Luna’s face broke into a grin. “You care. More than you’d like us to know, but you definitely care.”
And above all this, Harry was still alive and back in the castle if Granger were to be believed. Draco chanced a look at the 7th floor tower, knowing full well that Potter couldn’t possibly be watching him play, but wondering if he was in there all the same. The distraction nearly cost him the game as a Bludger whizzed by his face at top speed, and he had to drop a few metres to dodge it.
“Hey,” said Harry, jerking Draco towards him by the side of his shirt. Draco looked, realising just how close together they were. “I won’t let that happen.”
“I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, eyeing it suspiciously. “I doubt the other objects are rings or Dumbledore could have just said so in the letter. This thing likely has inherent magical properties,
At the end of this little speech, she tilted her head and smiled, laying the scroll on the end of the desk with a little pat, where McGonagall did not touch it. The Aurors continued to toss the room noisily as the women stared each other down. Harry and Draco were glued to the spot.
This chapter contains a depiction of torture. Proceed with caution.
“Bring the girl forward,” said Voldemort to a pair of gruff men, who stood immediately and lifted the form of a woman dressed in black robes off of a nearby chair and into the flickering glow of a candle lit chandelier where they dropped her on her knees. “You see, Harry, I have been expecting your arrival.”
Ollivander opened the box with a flourish as his hands moved deftly across the wand, which seemed to hum with a magical energy. Harry accepted it with care, praying it wouldn’t let off a bang and send the old man flying.
The gigantic form of Rubeus Hagrid lumbered off the bike, which groaned in relief. Dumbledore walked briskly to his side to lay his hands on a bundle of blankets in Hagrid’s arms.
“Anyway. See you later,” he finished, turning back to the door.
“Of course,” said Harry, digging into this share of the feast. He had a long night ahead of him, and he might not have a chance to stop for food again for a while.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He looked into his friend’s face, and he knew there was no point in denying it. He bent down to embrace her, tucking his nose into the crook of her neck, and breathed in her flowery smell, which had always been his favourite part of having a girlfriend.
Hermione flushed and bit her bottom lip as if she was holding back a rather nasty retort.
“I just – I don’t know,” Harry stammered.
“And here I thought I was in for a relaxing day,” mused Harry under his breath. “Right, my mistake. Let’s just carry on with a friendly game and afterwards we’ll go our separate ways.”
“Professor, that is absurd—” started Hermione, crossing her arms.
Draco didn’t realize a tear had fallen on his cheek until he was hurriedly wiping it away. The storm raging within him seemed to momentarily calm, and he was struck with a moment of clarity.
Draco tried to scoff, but it died on his lips. Hermione was right, he had learned something about himself. He’d learned that it was possible for him to never have supported the Dark Lord. And it wasn’t weak or cowardly to do so – he had been proud to stand with the Order.
The door to the Potions classroom was locked, and there was no response to Draco’s loud knocking. He paced angrily, toying with the idea of blasting his way through, when the door opened up a crack and a timid house-elf stood, knees clacking together nervously.
“Get him up,” snapped Voldemort as two Death Eaters hoisted him to his feet. “Do it, Draco. Do it and earn my trust. You will not get a second chance to fail me.”
“Hey, come here,” she whispered, crooking a finger at him. He leaned down to put his ear closer, and she threw her arms around his neck in a hug. “Love you,” she mumbled into his shoulder.
Hermione noticed. “Is this something you’re ok to talk about? I started looking into it from an academic perspective, but I realise how personal it might be.”
“Not quite. But they can only be seen by those who have witnessed death,” said Luna. “Me, for instance, I saw my mother die. I would have thought with your mother as well…”
As he felt the noises of the world around him coming back into focus, he found himself staring at Draco. The one person who had helped him find this gem of a memory. How could Harry ever repay a debt of gratitude like this? But Draco didn’t look pleased, in fact he looked horror stricken.
“Really?” said Harry.
A roar of the crowd caught his attention and Draco snapped his head to see Summerby diving for the Snitch. Draco laid flat on his broom, plummeting down through the rain to the east side of the field. The faster he flew, the more painfully the rain stung his face. Summerby had done well to spot the Snitch in this downpour, but he was a hesitant flier, made all the more evident in the current turbulence.
He was raised in a household with a Muggle-born wizard nonetheless. Ted Tonks had been like a father to him as a small child. But that changed too when the Muggle-born Registration Commission was put in place. It was only a matter of years before Ted, a well loved St Mungo’s healer, had failed to return home and was never seen again.
No one was visible on the grounds as the evening light faded, nor in the windows made of arched stone. But Harry knew he was being welcomed conditionally. The golden light of a first floor window flickered faintly, showing that someone was home, but only just.
“A bit, yes,” said Luna. “Oh! Do you think Voldemort would have been interested in a saint’s tooth reliquary? There are lots of those.”
“No, no, you did well. Quite well in fact,” said Dumbledore, finally sweeping around to face them. Baby Harry was still cradled in his arms, a letter now tucked into his blanket with him.
Draco paused, looking up at him.
“Oh, no worries, mate,” said Blaise with a big wink at Harry. “Pleasure to meet you, Gemma.”
, and Harry remembered he was in the driver’s seat.
“Right, I keep forgetting this will be your first asset transport,” she said, shifting her plate to the side. “Ok, what you’ve got to remember is they’re clever and resourceful, but they don’t see the world like we do. If the group gets separated, it’s up to you to make a judgement call on what to do. Don’t listen to that shite about protocol – if you need to do something drastic to save a life, do it. There’s only yourself to answer to in the field, got it?”
“No,” said Draco, his voice a harsh whisper. He rolled over to his back, glaring at the ceiling, knowing how Regulus must have felt when he realised the error of his ways. He would happily throw himself into a cave full of Inferi rather than go through the pain of coming clean. “I told you, I don’t deserve to be forgiven.”
Lucius scrutinised his son for a moment more before turning to look at Snape. “Severus?”
“What are you—”
Harry skimmed the section, reading a description of a condition that sounded like it could have been written for him personally; startle response as a defensive reflex, compartmentalised learning leading to eidetic memory, loss of trust in authority figures, risk seeking behaviours, placating personality mechanisms that can quickly flip to anger. His hands tightened on the book.
Draco raised his wand in a silent lighting charm, illuminating the portrait of the bard, who was seated at his table, quill in hand as though Draco had interrupted a stroke of inspiration.
“Whatever you say, darling,” said Draco, giving her hand a pat. “I’m sure you’ll forget about this before too long. You know Angelica wants to have the most extravagant wedding imaginable and I’ll definitely need your help to plan the thing. I can’t imagine you’ll spare a thought for Potter when you’re decked out in the finest robes money can buy.”
“Don’t tell me you haven’t thought about the exact same thing,” she said, her dark eyes fixing on him. “But now that I know, we can be honest with each other. I don’t mind, darling. I’ll stay with you as long as you need. Forever even.”
“Draco don’t, he’ll never stop!” Angelica joked.
That didn’t erase the fact that he was a manipulative bastard who had lied to him and endangered the group for his own selfish ends. Who had led to Charlotte’s capture. There were some things he wasn’t sure if he could ever fully forgive him for. But Draco was trying, wasn’t he? And hadn’t he been punished enough? Hell, the person who punished him the hardest, relentlessly even, was Draco himself.
The table looked expectantly at Draco, who blinked back at them.
Draco went rigid as the voice of Snape echoed in his head.
He probably should have been surprised by these words, but somehow he wasn’t. Knowing what he did of Draco’s past, the things he had kept from the group, Hermione’s suspicions. They had all been leading him to an inevitable conclusion.
Draco turned, finding Harry’s gaze in the darkness. Their eyes connected and he pulled him back in, the
“What could possibly make him believe that? Surely there’s nothing Potter can do that would leave a scratch on him, I’ve seen his power with my own eyes,” snapped Draco.
He raised his wand. “
“And… you were happy there?”
He felt a pressing sensation at the corner of his thought and realised it was Malfoy. His eyes flashed to the blond who held his gaze – he was trying to use Legilimency to connect with him.
As Draco neared the door, the blonde head of Luna Lovegood poked its way in.
The man who spent every Sunday for the last decade with him was not solely invested in him as a pawn in some grand scheme. Al cared about him, didn’t he?
“—And they had trained grindylows in all the water hazards to retrieve lost balls!” said Angelica, dissolving into laughter.
“Hermione’s still got me on levitation, but I’ve spent the entire weekend trying other things.”
Kreacher came shuffling in loudly, flapping his hands and exclaiming in their general direction. “Kreacher is here! If master is needing something, Kreacher will make it!”
Looking around the cupboard under the stairs, Harry breathed in the familiar scent of wood shavings and library book pages. It was funny really, that the one place he could think of to go for comfort, the memory at the centre of his memory library, was this small room that he had both loved and hated in equal measure.
“And if he’s not?”
approached the encampment. Students? Speak up now, what do you think? Brazenly or bravely?”
“Here we go, the face of Justice right here, ladies and gentlemen,” said Draco, laughing mirthlessly. “While we’re getting everything out in the open, why don’t you share with the group what you’ve been telling Umbridge in your little reports, hm? I have a funny feeling that the only one interested in breaking the charm is the Ministry’s little stool pigeon.”
said the snake.
“The Goonies,” said Harry. “But you tell everyone it’s Dead Poets Society.”
“Look, Granger’s a pushover. She just has to be convinced you aren’t a danger to yourself and she’ll convince McGonagall to let you keep the wand to help you learn faster. All you have to do is show a level of control over your magic and play by her silly rules.”
Draco felt a lump in his throat. “Have you seen all this in my cards?” he asked, in an attempt at levity.
“I don’t know,” said Cedric, his professional Auror demeanour finally dropping as a crease of worry formed on his brow. “But I don’t think so. They probably wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of taking her if she wasn’t alive.”
“I’ve never known Mother to have any visions,” he said, trying to discern the mixture of emotions in his father’s eyes. Even if he doubted her, Draco couldn’t believe that his father would turn against her. After all, no one with secrets survived long within the brethren.
Unlike the girlish dresses Draco had seen her in so far, tonight Angelica was wearing a short black dress that was cut in a low V. Her normally bouncy golden waves were pulled back into a sleek ponytail and she had glamoured on a dark smokey eye, with Pansy’s trademark cat-eye liner.
“Good luck,” said Harry as Hermione gave him a quick hug.
Voldemort laughed a shrill, high-pitched laugh. “Yes, my pet. I am bargaining for your life with Harry Potter. Tell me, is there anything you wish you could say to him?”
