Harry was busy as well. There were only two weeks until Bonfire Night, and once he and Rosemary had finalised the catering details, she convinced him to help her with some other last-minute tasks. And Harry being Harry, he readily agreed. Draco couldn't help but be annoyed by this. They were so close to figuring out this case, which meant their stay here was nearly over. Now wasn't the time to take on new endeavours or strengthen relationships that wouldn't matter.
"No. I'm not afraid." Well, he was. But only because he knew he would already fail. "I - just leave it. I can't be with you. I can't be with anyone."
Draco walked towards the exit in a daze. They had to pretend. They had to put on a convincing show. Married couples kissed. Obviously. It was part of the job. He pressed a finger to his lips, and the image of Potter kissing him played through his mind.
"What do you want?" He glanced aside and saw Barclay standing in his cubicle with an eager look on his face.
As he prepared to leave his house one morning, Draco stood in the bedroom for a long moment and eyed a large box sitting on the floor. He shrunk it with his wand, then tucked both into his jacket pocket. His walk to the bookshop was distracted. He trampled several patches of delicate flowers signalling the early arrival of spring. Immediately upon entering, he went into the tiny store room in the back and removed the box from his pocket to enlarge and then open it.
Maybe it was something about the light, or the fact that he'd worn Harry's favourite midnight blue jumper, but Draco looked positively radiant. Better than he had in weeks, if Harry thought about it. It was difficult to tear his focus away, and at the end of the meal, he couldn't even remember what either of them had eaten.
die! My entire life's been turned upside down in the last twenty-four hours. And you're wondering what my problem is?"
Draco had also learnt the name of the mystery programme he liked to watch—Midsomer Murders—and had started listening whilst pretending to read whenever Potter watched it.
The bedroom door opened, and Potter strode out looking well-rested. He looked at Draco and did a poor job of hiding his amusement.
Draco's hand shook as he pulled out his keys. All the blood seemed to rush from his head then, and he winced at his sudden light-headedness. The sound of keys hitting the ground dragged his gaze downward, and the world seemed to spin. Whitby's hands gripped his arms the next moment, and Draco found his back being gently pressed up against the door.
"Potter. Hi." His heart sank when he saw that Potter wore the same expression he'd had when sighting Draco with Whitby the evening before.
They all said their goodbyes, dropping off blankets and grabbing their coats on the way out. Potter approached the counter, last as usual and looking pensive. Draco clasped his hands together underneath the counter to keep from trembling so much. "Fish and chips, Potter," he barked.
That had been bad enough. Of course the damn press had followed Potter and snapped a photo as he left. Draco supposed he should be thankful that whoever had stalked Potter had avoided coming inside and discovering him as well. Probably frightened off by the presence of so many Muggles. Perhaps there were benefits to living among them, after all.
Rosemary, who seemed to be in charge of everything around Kilmington, called for silence and looked around the room. "I'm thrilled to see so many volunteers," she said, though she didn't sound anything close to thrilled. Then she launched into her agenda and rattled off a list of deadlines to target for planning, their budget, and a short list of changes to this year's celebration.
More and more often, they exchanged pleasantries. Neither probed the other about their reason for living in Cartmel, however. And considering that none of Draco's friends or family came pounding on his door, Potter clearly had not shared Draco's whereabouts with anyone.
The man held a hand up as though in defence. "I'm only a friend. We're supposed to go walking today, except he's late. Thought I'd check on him. I'm Jeremy."
"Excuse me?" Draco said. He couldn't see how one box could cook and another could clean. The two tasks weren't related at all. The only difference in the boxes was the window shape. And the size. Was this really what Muggles had to live with?
"You're doing fine," Draco said, breathing as though he'd just run a considerable distance. "But I want more."
All the little things - the smells and sounds and memories that had only ever registered in his subconscious - they all came to haunt him now, always at the most inconvenient times.
Potter fell asleep quickly, but Draco lay awake late into the night. His mind was preoccupied with thoughts of work, and Potter's case, and what would happen once Potter's case was closed. He and Potter never broached the topic, but Draco knew they would have to soon. He cared too much.
Draco took more of him in, feeling a rush of satisfaction when Potter's thighs began trembling. It was so easy to make him feel good, and he was so wonderfully responsive. His breaths grew shallow and shaky as Draco continued sucking on him, and all too soon, he felt a hand brush through his hair.
Draco's heart was suddenly in his throat. He wanted to say meaner, nastier things to push Potter away. He wanted to apologise. He wanted to run.
Draco blinked and yawned. It was nearly dark. They'd been here for an entire day, and they hadn't killed each other.
Of course. He pulled it over and flipped it open to the middle, staring at the photos without seeing them. Of fucking course. Why hadn't Harry thought of this earlier? Photos! What a bloody novel concept. He felt like such an idiot.
The man was close. Draco started moving towards him, then stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the man pull out his wand.
Draco rolled off him and reached into his bedside table for the bottle of lubricant Potter had tossed in with their shopping a mere two weeks prior. He handed it to Potter, who unscrewed the cap and squeezed a dollop onto his fingers.
on the inside. Shaking his head, Harry tucked the card into his journal and spent the morning working on his book about his grandparents. Several people in the village had given him old cards, letters, and photos when he'd asked. Sometimes he liked to just sit and go through them all, to relive all their old memories. That soothed him more than anything, especially on days when he really felt he didn't have a grip on himself.
For a moment, he considered going inside and setting everyone straight, but he knew that wouldn't be prudent. They'd only have more reason to make fun of him. It was best to just leave them alone and pretend he'd never come here.
Potter scowled at him. "You know, most Muggles are all right. They're not much different from you and me."
He sighed. Perhaps he could take Potter up on his offer, just this once. Just to wipe that look off his face. What could it hurt?
The air seemed to crackle with possibility, and Harry felt so light-headed, wishing desperately that Draco would just
"Oof! Watch it!" Draco lost his balance, or perhaps he tripped on something. Either way, he crashed into Potter, who steadied him. There were worse fates.
Whitby gave him a look, but didn't say anything until they stepped outside. "Shall we have dinner somewhere?"
"Thought you didn't want something that was a lot of work," Jeremy said. He stood and zipped his jacket.
It was hard to say what went through Potter's head then. He placed a hand on Draco's bare shoulder and began rubbing it.
be the last customer out the door, and more and more often, he'd stop by the front counter to chat for a few moments with Draco.
It wasn't as though Draco had a choice. He folded his arms and leant back in his chair. "Just tell me how the investigation is going."
"I don't know what to say, sir." Draco could hardly believe it. He wasn't used to things working out in his favour.
Draco ran a hand through Potter's messy hair. He couldn't believe this was about to happen. "Show me what you like."
"I suppose so. Hang on." Draco left Harry standing whilst he fetched his wand from the bedside table, then watched whilst Harry cast a spell at Pierce that caused bindings to appear around his wrists and ankles.
He'd been in St. Mungo’s the last five days. Not that he remembered any of it. He'd only woken up late last night. Next to him stood a small table with a delicate silver contraption perched on top.
"Just a few more minutes. You can help me with the curtains while we wait." He began drawing the curtains back, letting in the weak spring sunlight.
"That's a nice idea, but we won't always know where the other person is." At least, Draco hoped not. That would require a level of closeness he didn't think he could tolerate.
Robards held a hand up. "I realise this is inconvenient. If it makes you feel better, this isn't the first time we've had to make such arrangements."
"That's - yeah, I understand," Harry said, breathless and not understanding anything in that moment except a burning desire to rip all of Draco's clothes off and fuck him right there against the books. He pulled away, ran a hand down the sleeve of Draco's jumper. "You know, that really is a nice jumper. It makes you look, well..." Fuckable. Very fuckable. "It really makes your skin look nice."
Draco gave him a rude hand gesture and went back to his desk, where he rested his head against the cool wood. He was tempted yet again to hand in his resignation letter.
Draco bit the insides of his cheeks as he watched a sandy-haired man in wrinkled navy robes nearly stumble into his chair.
Spring brought warm weather, eventually, but harsh winds kept all the villagers tucked in their jumpers well into June. Draco especially found he was having more and more trouble keeping himself warm, and the heat in the city was a small relief when he Apparated back to London for his monthly appointments with Whitby.
Harry turned away and curled in on himself. Tears leaked out, an endless torrent of them. When was it going to stop?
A hot bath was exactly what Draco needed to relax after the calamity from the previous day. He refilled the water twice before finally stepping out and stretching.
Draco squinted. There was someone vaguely familiar who looked to be moving towards him, holding his gaze. He tried to place the man. Perhaps he had been in the Wizengamot.
Rain continued throughout the night and into the next morning when Draco awoke and Apparated to the Ministry.
They arrived at a clearing that overlooked a broad expanse of land and paused to take in the sight. Harry snaked an arm around Draco's waist.
His heart rate returned to normal, the shock of the cold faded, and when Draco opened his eyes again, the world had righted itself. Mostly. He let out a sigh of relief. He always hated this part. Even after three years. But for today, it was over, at least.
Jennings screwed his face up in thought, and Draco knew he had said the magic words. He needed to remember to abuse Potter's privilege more often.
"I mean it's not here. What else can that mean? Just give me a half-hour, I left it in the bookshop."
After an excruciating cup of tea and many personal questions, Draco feigned a headache, which gave Dorothy the kick she needed to leave.
"Ok." Draco sat back on the sofa and shifted his gaze to look at Harry. "I'm all out of ideas though."
Potter was to blame for this, of course. The night before, he'd arrived back at the shop early with their dinner. Usually he waited for Draco in the rear corner nook. This time though, he'd knocked on the door to the store room just as Draco was emerging from his haze of misery. Dazed and panicked, he'd cleared things away in a rush. He couldn't remember locking the door and didn't need Potter barging in. It was sheer luck that he'd managed to throw potions for Sunday into his bag, but that luck didn't extend to the journal, which lay forgotten on the desk.
It was impossible not to notice things, and Draco had unwittingly learnt a lot about Potter in the month they'd spent together. He knew how Potter slept, which soap he liked to use in the bath, how much sugar and milk he took in his tea, and how he walked on his toes if he wasn't wearing socks.
"Eating will make you more tolerable. And if Pierce knows where we are, then… I don't know. We've got to keep living our lives, though. We'll figure something out."
"It will," Potter said, and he looked away. "It helped me, you know. To talk about Lawrence with you."
It was a long moment before either of them moved, but eventually, Harry lowered Draco's legs onto the bed and leant forwards to cover his body and kiss him.
"I don't understand how you did that," Potter said, scratching his head after losing for the third time in a row.
Draco ran after Barclay down the long, dark corridor and through a black door at the end. As soon as they passed through the doorway, he immediately knew something was wrong.
Another deep breath sent a jolt of desire straight to Harry's groin, and he pulled Draco closer, letting a hand drift down his back. He nearly gasped in surprise when he felt Draco's hands begin to trace a similar path down his own back, stopping just below the waistband of his jumper. Like he was considering.
"—inviting you in!" Potter's voice came from behind. "Erm, good to meet you. I'm Henry." He pushed Draco aside and stuck his hand out to shake hers. Her face lit up with joy, and Potter led her into their cottage. "Why don't you prepare the tea, David?" he called.
As though to prove it, he pulled Potter back on top of him and captured his mouth in another kiss. He ran his hands over the smooth skin of Potter's back, letting his fingers settle on Potter's arse and squeezing.
He stared at the empty chair across from him. At the half-full container of food on the table. At his own, still in his lap. The chips had gone limp, and the fish was shiny with oil. He closed the lid.
The muffled noises were no longer muffled, and he heard Harry cry out in what was unmistakably pain.
For some reason, Draco couldn't say it. It was more difficult than he thought to tell Potter that someone at the Ministry wanted to kill him. Nor could he formulate any words about this thing between them. All he knew as he looked into Potter's eyes was a fierce pang of longing.
Mercifully, Potter responded by pressing two fingers deep inside him. Draco moaned and began rocking back and forth against them, which had the added benefits of rubbing their cocks together and making Potter squirm. Draco could get used to seeing him like this.
Barclay flashed a wry grin. "Not quite. We've got to go to the Confidential Records Office. We'll be auditing those files."
"Except I value my privacy." Draco yanked his jumper over his head and began putting his socks and shoes on.
Harry shook his head and got up, pocketing the piece he'd been trying to place. Draco was probably trying to carry everything in one trip.
Draco frowned, but Robards pushed an enormous mug across the desk. "Make it strong, make it sweet, and don't take your time."
He sat at his desk and reached for the top letter in his in-tray, but he didn't bother to read it. Instead, he played through the scenario in which he handed over his resignation letter, trying to imagine what he would say to Robards.
He decided to go home before anything else happened, but when he stepped out into the Atrium, Robards was there. He was easy to pick out of the crowd because his face radiated fury, and he strode towards Draco as soon as he saw him.
Before going to work the next morning, Draco stuffed Potter's Invisibility Cloak into a bag and jotted down a list of names from the suspect list. They were people who hadn't been interviewed yet, who stood out to Draco as being more suspicious for one reason or another.
Draco tried to think of something—anything—to say that might convince her to just leave them alone. He cursed Potter in his head. They should have never answered the door. Nothing good could come from these Muggles and their—
Draco stood, but froze immediately once he realised it wasn't anywhere in the cottage. "It's not here."
"I know. That's why it's fun." He reached into his pocket and placed a rectangle the size of his thumb nail on top of the coffee table. Draco squinted at it. "Er, give me a moment," Harry said, then plucked his wand from between the sofa cushions to return the rectangle back to its normal size.
. He choked on a biscuit when he saw a wedding announcement for Goyle and Astoria Greengrass. Had the world gone completely mad?
Draco let his towel drop to the floor and slid under the covers, where he waited until Harry returned with damp hair and no clothes. Draco's gaze fell to his cock, and he remembered how it felt inside him. It seemed as though much longer than two days had passed since then.
Draco made his way to the store room to quickly grab his journal from the desk. "Here," he said when Whitby appeared again, thrusting it at him.
"Whoever did it, they're not related to the case Potter and Lawrence were investigating at the time of the explosion."
Draco tried not to let it bother him. He had gotten rather used to having something to look forward to after the ordeal of taking his potions though, and he was, if anything, a man of routine.
Draco was also convinced now that Lister was useless. Otherwise, he'd have warned them against adding too much washing powder to the washing machine. Instead, Draco had to face disaster on his own. It was a small mercy that Potter wasn't around to witness the soapy kitchen flood he'd created.
He got dressed and went to the dining table to decide whether he felt like working on his book or attempting to expel his misery into his journal.
One look at Potter was all it took for Draco's resolve to vanish. Vaguely, he remembered that this was probably a bad idea.
"Level Nine, Department of Mysteries," the cool female voice announced. The lift clattered to a halt, and the grilles slid open.
"What's happened? Did you find something?" Barclay said. He looked sleepy. It was hard to imagine what that felt like.
Christmas was approaching. Lights and festive baubles decorated a number of shop windows, and a number of bundled up villagers were out, rushing to somewhere warm, no doubt.
Mornings were sweet and placid, and there was everything good about them. Nights were the exact opposite.
As soon as he set his quill down, Draco launched into his prepared speech. "Sir, I've been doing some thinking over the weekend and—"
As soon as Jennings handed over the rolled up scroll of parchment, Draco left the Ministry and Apparated home, scaring Potter, who was brushing crumbs from his shirt.
"Damn," Potter said. "We should've come here last. Some of this stuff will go off sitting in the car all afternoon."
"Potter," he began, and green eyes looked into his. "What have you told people about... this? My shop?"
Draco used his wand to move the boxes onto the ground. The lids zoomed off further than he intended, but he didn't care. He flipped through the files until he found the sealed records containing Ministry safe house locations and set them on the floor.
Draco threw open his door, stepped out, and stretched his arms to the sky. It was quiet, and the light breeze felt good.
People strolled up and down the street, smiling and laughing, holding hands, carrying their shopping. Scarves whipped in the wind. Everyone was out making the most of the day. Even the leaves had a charming lilt of careless joy as they drifted through the air to their final resting place.
He was already beginning to feel guilty. Like he should push Potter away. He knew he would have to someday, to spare him the same pain as everyone else he cared for. Though - did he really care for Potter? That seemed a stretch.
Barclay? Draco straightened to look over the cubicle wall, holding the Invisibility Cloak tightly around himself.
"Yes, of course! Tickets are only five pounds. I insist you come." She gave them a look that said she wouldn't give up until they agreed.
"You're back already," he said. Potter was standing at the front counter with a sack of takeaway containers, watching him.
Draco reached for it and felt his eyes go wide as he read the tall, skinny lettering that said, 'Personal Lubricant'.
He felt so out of place amongst these Muggles, but thankfully, the quiz began and he could stop listening to Randall talk about the brawl he'd got into the previous night.
Harry stretched to open the bedside table drawer and dug through it until he triumphantly pulled out the small bottle of lubricant. He tossed it to Draco.
Harry blushed. It really was difficult to maintain a private life in a tiny village. "We talked." He took a large bite of his toast.
"You know, you can sit closer to me if you want," Potter said after Draco handed him a mug and sat down again on the far end of the sofa.
"It's all right," Harry said. "We can get dinner another day. Do you at least want help cleaning up?"
"I need to check on the fire," he said, hoping he sounded authoritative. Or at least in command of his faculties.
But Harry froze when he stepped into the kitchen. Draco stood leaning stiffly with one hand against the kitchen table, face red and sweaty.
"Of course I'm back. It's been nearly 40 minutes." He looked... well, not angry, at least. Confused, maybe.
A wiry man with dark hair and leathery skin gaped at him, and Draco remembered he only had a towel wrapped around his waist.
Harry exhaled. With shaky hands, he hung his coat. He walked slowly past Draco, whose eyes roved over him. Harry suppressed a shiver and gave a quick nod as he spilled coffee into a cup and retreated to his reading nook. Or, what was quite possibly
Draco bent his head forwards to kiss Harry and shut him up. He ran one hand through Harry's messy hair and pressed the other against the small of his back.
Draco tried to pry Potter's arm away, but that only made him grasp Draco more tightly. He tried to wiggle free, but that was a mistake, because Potter thrust against him in response.
"What are you doing?" Barclay stood in front of him. He nodded at the book Draco held. "What did you find?"
It was the puzzle piece he'd been trying to place that morning when Draco had called for him, begging him to get the portkey. He squeezed the piece hard between his fingers. It felt like some relic from another age.
Draco bit his lip and swatted Harry's hand away. "I'm supposed to show you, remember?" He took his cock into his hand and began hypnotising Harry with slow, lazy pulls, squeezing just slightly at the head. Harry lay back, admiring the show, but he also wanted to lick the pink head poking out of Draco's foreskin, or kiss the dusky nipples on his flushed chest. He was certain he'd go mad with desire just watching. His hand began inching its way towards his own untouched erection, but Draco brushed him away again. Just as Harry was about to complain, Draco extended his fingers to take Harry's cock in hand as well. The hot press of their erections together made Harry lose all coherent thought. When Draco gave a light squeeze, he groaned and shut his eyes.
By the time he looked up though, Robards had already vanished. Draco stood and, making sure his letter was still in his pocket, went into the sun-filled office.
Harry could still hear the sound of the shower going, so he went back into the living room and sat down on the sofa. They had begun working on the constellation jigsaw puzzle earlier that week and were nearly finished already. He had to marvel at Draco's capacity to sit hunched over the table for hours at a time, methodically snapping pieces together. Harry could never focus for more than an hour or two, and then he'd turn his attention to discovering what it took to break Draco's concentration.
He didn't want to fall asleep. He wanted to be awake, in case Draco needed anything. It was the least he could do.
After three more days of the same increasingly awkward exchanges with Potter and no dinners together, Draco was forced to admit that it did bother him.
And so he gently rolled Potter off him and broke their kiss to follow his hand as it trailed down Potter's chest and over his stomach. He wrapped his fingers around Potter's cock and gave it a few lazy strokes, trying not to smirk at the sharp intake of breath from Potter.
He made a cup of tea and took it and the case file to bed. But Potter was right—nothing about it seemed suspicious.
Finally, he said, "There's a room on Level Five where all restricted substances are stored that the Ministry have confiscated."
The subject of where, when, and how often Potter wanked weighed heavily on Draco's mind over the next two weeks.
Pierce turned to face him again. "My wife," he said through gritted teeth. "She was killed during a raid thanks to Potter."
Relieved and embarrassed, Draco looked at his bowl of pasta. "And I really just want a Chocolate Frog."
Draco crashed to the ground, slamming his left shoulder against the coffee table. Pain shot through his arm, and he lay on the floor clutching at it and cursing.
Harry shrugged. "You're forgetting I've spent the better part of my life with Voldemort wanting to kill me. I guess I learnt how to compartmentalise, or something." He squeezed Draco's shoulder. "Anyway, there's nothing we can do right now. And we're safe here."
Harry smiled. He slowly withdrew his fingers and sat up on his knees, reaching for the lubricant again.
Draco froze and fought to keep his embarrassment from showing. All Aurors were taught the importance of establishing stopgap measures with their partners in the event of a worst-case scenario. It was one of the first things they learnt, because it was a matter of basic personal safety and could save their lives.
"That should be fine," said Whitby. He was looking at the sky, transfixed. Draco looked up as well, but there was nothing of note. "It really is lovely out here," Whitby murmured. "I miss being able to see the stars. Astronomy was my favourite subject at Hogwarts, you know."
"No, which is another reason protecting Potter is a full-time job. All the Ministry safe houses are occupied at the moment, and we don't have time to set up another. You'll be assuming different identities and living somewhere else for the duration of the investigation."
Draco hated to do anything Potter told him, and he had no interest in cooking. It wasn't a skill he would ever need.
Draco stepped out of the car, relieved that they'd come to a halt. He had to admit, Potter's driving had improved, but he still hated this horrible Muggle death box.
"Shut up!" Potter no longer stared at the parchment. He had turned to face Draco and looked at him with such anger and pain in his eyes that, for a moment, Draco didn't know what to say. And he couldn't look away.
He groaned at the sudden absence of Harry's mouth, but the bedside table drawer opening and closing was a welcome sound—Potter was fetching the lubricant. He returned and positioned himself between Draco's legs, pushing them up and apart.
"I don't care about your personal life," Robards said. "Get in my office. I have an assignment for you."
"I've just got word that there's been another death involving the Brixham case. Jennings, MacDonald, you were both involved originally." He beckoned them with his hand. "My office."
"Took a bit of convincing, but Anne's coming tonight," he said with a wide smile. Anne was Jeremy's girlfriend. She was wealthy, she lived alone, and she was something of a recluse.
One of the perks of owning a bookshop was that Draco was in charge of inventory. After finishing his first book about constellations, he decided to expand the astronomy offerings in his shop and ordered several more.
He grabbed his wand from the drawer of his bedside table and levelled it at the stack of correspondence. "
Harry pushed the thought away. He had to carry on like there would be some kind of future. One with Draco in it. Because Harry was too fragile to face reality. The facts were still too fresh and new, and almost impossible to believe when he looked at Draco, when he saw him smile and complain and go to work every single day like nothing was wrong. Everything was all so normal for him, so it had to be normal for Harry, too. And the only way that could happen was if he shoved it all out of his head and lied to himself.
Draco blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "I still hate Pierce. He's done nothing but make my life miserable. And Barclay has me auditing budget reports with him now, as well."
They lay tangled together afterwards whilst Potter caught his breath. Draco became conscious of his erection pressing into Potter's hip though, and eventually Potter did as well. He rolled onto his side and reached between them to take Draco's cock into his hand.
Rich autumn colours completely blanketed the countryside now, and the crisp, late October air was refreshing. Perhaps Harry wasn't completely off the mark.
Harry was so busy with Bonfire Night and Draco was so concerned with trying to solve the case that the subject of their relationship kept getting pushed aside. Their time together was spent tangled in each other's limbs or trying to discern the identity of the rogue Auror.
Draco's mouth hung half-open as though he were trying to force words out. He shook his head lightly. "I can't believe this is so difficult." He looked up at the ceiling.
"I'm scared," Draco said, trying to keep his voice steady. "I'm really scared. I just - I don't want it to hurt."
"I thought it was monthly," Harry said. He distinctly remembered Draco had visited with his Healer just a week or so ago.
And what was all that rubbish about helping himself? Draco had already tried that by making a generous donation over the last six years. His father had always said money could convince even the most stubborn wizards. If that hadn't helped, certainly nothing else would.
He wasn't in the mood to talk, so he went to take a bath and read. When he opened his book, the Chocolate Frog card fluttered to the floor. He really needed to find a new bookmark. It was disturbing to see Potter smiling at him every time he decided to read. Especially in the bath.
was why his cheeks were wet. Not because he was too inconsolably grief-stricken to fathom, much less accept the facts of life and death.
Usually, Whitby gave a great laugh and said, "You got me there." This time, he screwed up his face in concern.
"Well," she said, placing her mug in the dirty dish container, "suit yourself, but he's a very charming young man." She flashed a smile at him and finally left.
Potter was still laughing. "Here, it's easier if you take this out." He removed the glass tray from the microwave and tipped the remains of the exploded pie into the bin, then handed it to Draco for cleaning.
"Usually, when your lot come around here asking for my help, it doesn't involve asking where I was two months ago in my spare time."
"What was that for?" Draco asked, slightly breathless. He tucked his keys into his pocket and started them off down the path.
"Then we'll know the other person is in trouble and can Apparate to them." Potter ran his thumb around the edge of the coin.
Draco took it and walked to the kitchen in a daze. He filled the kettle to the top and leant against the counter whilst he waited for it to boil.
As members of the Wizengamot funneled out of the courtroom, Draco stood unmoving and silent. He and his family had just gotten away with murder. Sort of. It had been difficult to pin specific deaths on the Malfoy family, but nobody could deny their hand in supporting the Dark Lord - a point that had caused their trial to drag on for days.
"Intense," Harry finished. There was a lot of come on his stomach and chest, and he couldn't help smiling. He liked it. "Come here," he said, pulling Draco to him.
Well, except it seemed to matter now, at least. Wouldn't it be something if he just fell over dead in this tiny room? While he tried not to yell out from the pain, Draco tried to distract himself by imagining who might find his body. But the pain vanished before he could decide who the lucky person might be. The tightness in his chest, which had been a new and persistent presence recently, lessened, and he could breathe a little easier.
Grudgingly, Draco agreed to let Harry drive the rest of the way, and as they approached, his heart sped up at all the familiar sights.
Thursday evening, they went to the pub with Jeremy, Barbara, and Bill again. They all had dinner together, and Draco found himself laughing as Bill regaled them with the story of his and Barbara's disastrous first date. Draco was slightly envious of the bond they shared, and he squeezed Harry's leg under the table and hoped one day, they could be that close.
"New here?" the man grunted. He looked at them through narrowed eyes, and Draco tried not to stare at the thick grey eyebrows that took up half his forehead.
Harry threw his arms around Draco's neck. "I know," he whispered. "I'm sorry I've made it so difficult. I'm supposed to be comforting you and -"
Harry nodded. Draco had explained this to him before, and he heard the words again. Some of them even registered. His mind scrambled desperately, as it had done numerous times already, trying to come up with some sort of solution. How had he managed to survive Voldemort, survive the Killing Curse twice, and something as simple as this couldn't be helped? His eyes went to the tin on the table. It was bright red and had a faded, smiling girl on it, holding up some sort of chocolate.
It was October now, and the crisp autumn air was tinged with the smell of late-blooming wildflowers and dry leaves that had already fallen. Draco always enjoyed walking around the Manor grounds in autumn most of all, and he missed that.
He walked quickly along the path to the bookshop, Whitby trailing in his wake. A brisk wind had moved in, and there were few people out in the village that day. A small mercy.
And with a content sigh, he burrowed his head deeper into the pillow, nestled closer to Harry, and fell back asleep.
He pushed himself off the sofa and followed Potter into the kitchen, then slumped into a chair at the table.
"I - no, there can't." Draco grappled for words, drumming his fingers on the chair back. "But I can't stop thinking about you," he blurted. That hadn't come out the way he'd intended.
Harry nodded. He remembered that. He had made peace with death once before as well, had walked willingly towards it.
Draco walked blindly towards the voice, along with numerous footsteps. Bodies jostled him as he got closer, and everyone squeezed through the door in a clumsy pack.
you been doing lately then? Oh god, I should have asked that first," Potter moaned. He buried his face in his hands.
Harry watched the delicate instruments that sat on a small table next to Draco's bed. They bobbed and rotated and swung back and forth. He had no idea what they were supposed to do. Somebody had probably explained it to him, but he couldn't remember.
"I care because it's where we are now, and we have no choice. Same reason I'm trying to get along with you, though you make it difficult sometimes."
"Nobody will be there tomorrow either." Potter reached across the table and took Draco's hand in his. "Besides, there's something else I'd rather do tonight."
It had been a long time since Draco had been with someone. That, coupled with the fact that Potter was straddling him and watching his every move, made him nervous, and his hands shook as he undid his trousers. He nudged Potter out of the way and slid them and his pants off, then pulled his shirt over his head and threw it on the floor next to Potter's.
"Well, that's no proper way to start a marriage. You need photos, and friends, and a grand party. Tell me you had a party."
Understanding finally seemed to strike, and Potter scrambled to get under the covers. Draco, still feeling bold thanks to the alcohol, rolled onto his side to face him. They looked at each other for a long while.
Draco glared. Potter ate quickly. He never looked up from his plate as he shovelled in mouthful after mouthful. It was unsightly. Draco set his fork down in disgust and pushed back from the table.
That was how he had spent the day. After incinerating Draco's post, he had sat down and stared at the puzzle for hours, until the sun went down. And then he continued to stare, because the damn thing glowed in the dark. The last 30 or so pieces mocked him.
Draco looked at Potter, who smiled at him. It wasn't a goofy, bashful smile like his Chocolate Frog photo, either. Perhaps it was because they had been living in such close quarters, but Draco didn't feel uncomfortable being this close to him.
He forced his left palm to rest on Potter's shoulder, then took hold of his free hand. It was difficult to focus on anything. Draco didn't dare look at Potter, who led them around with lumbering steps. But he didn't want to look at the crowd either. He settled for Potter's chin.
"Well, it was, for a while. Sort of." His eyes searched Draco's as though trying to find the right words. "But something changed. You really make me… I mean…"
It wasn't until he crashed onto his knees that he realised he'd never given Robards his resignation letter.
"Touch me," he said, hoping he didn't sound as needy as he felt, and Potter didn't blink, didn't even breathe as he slid a finger inside.
Some kind of possessive feeling tore through Harry as he thought about how long it had been since Draco had been intimate with anyone, and that he had chosen
He awoke again to the feeling of someone lightly stroking his hair and inhaled deeply, because Potter was close, and his scent was an overwhelming source of comfort.
He concluded his morning routine by checking the letterbox and placed a thin stack of envelopes on the kitchen table to read later. Post occasionally arrived from owls as well. Less often than it used to, but more often than Draco would have liked. And sure enough, an owl soared in that morning. He'd had a feeling. He removed the letter and watched the owl flap away, then took out his wand and cast
Draco nodded. He knew all this. If they ever needed to trace the source, it was tedious, but it could be done by narrowing the search parameters based on information such as this.
Eventually, he made his way back towards the front of the shop, pausing again at the counter. It was more habit than anything else. He didn't expect Draco to suddenly be there. Not really. The curtains were already drawn, so he took out his wand and cast the charms to put everything back in place and clean the dust that had accumulated.
"Hmm? Oh, yeah." Harry furrowed his brow and smiled. "I didn't know whether it was okay to come here. I know you need time. I just -"
An identical, neat stack appeared next to the original. He repeated the spell a few more times, then set his wand aside with a satisfied nod.
More rolls of parchment were unfurled. The Healer dragged a chair beside the bed and sat down. Even though a scraggly, grey beard covered much of his face, it looked full of bad news.
He opened his eyes, crusty and swollen from last night's pity party. His temple hurt where his glasses had pressed into his face as he slept. He groaned and pushed himself up. It was bloody cold. And no wonder - the fire had gone out.
Potter stared for a minute, frozen. His eyes had gone wide, and he looked curious. Intrigued. Possessive.
"Finally," Draco muttered. He stuffed the banknotes into the envelope and followed Potter out the door, ducking around the overgrown rose bush.
Draco barely remembered to squeeze Potter's arm and say, "I'm coming," before shutting his eyes and letting his head fall back against the sofa as wave after wave of pleasure crashed over him.
"Well, shall we?" Potter picked up the food and started making his way back towards the rear corner nook. Draco followed, and saw that Potter had left all his belongings there.
Potter frowned. "No idea. The obvious guess is the people we were investigating. My gut says otherwise."
To Draco's relief, his one-to-one with Robards that Friday was considerably more mellow than the week prior. Robards seemed distracted and kept it short, and Draco rushed to leave afterwards, lest Robards call him back.
This time, Robards upbraided him for visiting the Office of Magical Evidence Processing to check on the status of the potion residue MacDonald had sent two weeks ago. It wasn't his place to figure out what happened. But Draco didn't care. He needed to do something more than babysit Potter.
Draco took out the post from his pocket and enlarged it with his wand. Two letters for Potter from his barmy mates, and one for Draco from his parents.
Now it was okay for him to cry. He missed Draco already, even though he was right there, even though his hair tickled Harry's chin and their bodies were pressed together. He couldn't imagine how much he'd miss Draco when he was no longer there.
They drew their coats tightly around themselves and headed inside. Draco flinched—he'd forgotten how beige this place was—and told Harry to order something for him.
But everywhere held memories that were just too much. Somehow, despite how bare and unadorned Draco kept the place, they'd managed to make it a cosy, welcoming home. It was oppressive. It was hard to breathe.
"As for cases," Robards continued, "I assign those at my discretion. Highly visible cases get a lot of press coverage and can be very political. Surely you can agree that I must exercise caution with you especially, given your history. I wouldn't want to give people the wrong idea."
"I just prefer to cook for myself." Potter gave him a disbelieving look. "It really is that simple. I'm not having you on."
"That's why you need to listen to me!" And Draco set the access book on the desk, flipping to the pages where Pierce's entries were logged.
"That man you saw me with that night," Draco began, "he's - he's not just a friend. Not really a friend, I guess. He's my," he paused to bite his lip, "Healer."
Draco searched his eyes, then dared to voice a horrible thought. "What if it was someone Apparating?"
The noise grew louder, with several shouts for getting drinks after work. As though Potter needed to be celebrated more.
Dinner was simple fare—baked chicken with mashed potatoes and a fresh salad—but Draco couldn't remember the last time he'd enjoyed a meal so much.
"Hey Malfoy, we need more coffee," said someone - Browning, it turned out. Draco wanted to kill him.
The degree to which it irritated him was, in fact, quite alarming. He sat at the counter and stewed all day. And when Potter strode in mid-afternoon that Friday, Draco called him over with a sharp, "Potter."
There was a long moment of silence, and then Whitby leaned forward and steepled his fingers on top of his desk.
He locked the door to the store room, the shop, and retraced his steps from the morning back to Primrose Cottage, where there was no primrose.
Draco didn't need a dozen packages of biscuits, but he needed to do something with his hands. He plucked Jaffa Cakes, Hobnobs, custard creams, and Chocolate Bourbons from the shelves and added them all into the trolley.
They ate in silence. Draco tried to eat as quickly as possible so he could retreat to the bedroom, but several questions flitted through his mind, and his curiosity got the better of him.
"I really am writing," Potter spluttered. He picked up the notebook and began thumbing through it. "My grandparents, they used to live here. I only found out recently. I wanted to see what it was like here. Learn about them. Maybe write a book."
Every time he'd cast the spells over the last three weeks, nothing had happened, which meant they hadn't been tampered with. With a shaky hand, he aimed his wand and uttered the incantations, exactly as he had done countless times.
Potter raised his eyebrow, then got up and left the kitchen. When he returned, he placed a Galleon next to Draco's plate.
"I shouldn't have waited," Potter said, slouching back into the sofa. "I should've told him to get out as soon as I saw the potion."
Robards pursed his lips. He looked as though he wanted to shout, but when he finally spoke, his voice was eerily calm. "Go talk to them. And get out of my office."
"Now do mine," Jeremy said, and Potter flipped over Jeremy's cards. There was a seven, a five, a three, another five—
Someone who knew about the case Potter and Lawrence were investigating and sent in an anonymous tip all on their own.
Draco felt Harry's hand press against his chest and trail downwards. It was certainly tempting, except his mind was occupied with other thoughts.
"I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be," Draco said, trying to calmly stir his coffee. "Don't you have a case you're supposed to be investigating?"
The man nodded and continued rubbing items across a surface that beeped and chimed. "Name's Nash. I own this place."
Ignoring his own fish and chips, Draco went over all the points from the day Potter and Lawrence were attacked.
His hopes were dashed as soon as he entered though. Surely this much beige didn't foster a pleasing environment for eating.
Draco grasped Potter's arm and wriggled out from underneath it. He stepped quietly into the bathroom and made certain to lock the door.
He curled in on himself instead, closed his eyes, and gave in to everything. There was nothing else for it. Eventually, he knew, he would pass out.
Draco tried not to look irritated whilst Potter explained how the caterers wanted to charge almost twice what they had done last year. He and Rosemary were trying to decide whether to find different options for food or make compromises in the existing budget and use the same caterers.
Finally, something Draco knew that Robards didn't. It felt good to catch him off guard. "I looked into the anonymous tip Lawrence received. It was forged—there were no identifying details associated with it."
Still, as spring neared its end, Harry's joy and satisfaction became overshadowed with a swell of unease each time he stood up and brushed the sweat from his brow. He faced the sun one warm June afternoon, shielding his eyes as he surveyed the primrose cuttings he had just planted. Draco liked to complain about how poorly named his cottage was, since there was no primrose to be found anywhere near it. Harry always rolled his eyes and smiled, but he'd decided to try propagating some from the small patch that lived in a shady corner of his own garden. With any luck, he'd be able to re-plant the grown cuttings around Draco's cottage next year.
They had a job to do, a role to fulfil. Kissing, whilst not explicitly noted as a requirement of the assignment, was easy to imagine as being necessary. There was no reason to dwell on it or make wild assumptions about its meaning. It was simply work.
"I -" He had to take a deep breath before continuing. "No. He didn't reject me. He - he needs time. To think."
Harry bent to kiss him, to reassure him, to comfort him. He pulled away at the sound of brisk footsteps entering the otherwise empty ward.
A voice jarred him from his thoughts. "Mr. Malfoy." A different voice. A different Healer. He sat up and saw a short, stocky man standing beside him. Was this good or bad?
He had to go back to bed, back to Draco. He'd promised he wouldn't leave, and they were already trying to take him away. He screamed and shouted at them, trying to tear their arms away.
"I missed the way this place smells," Harry said as they stepped out onto Level Two. "Is that odd?" He looked around and took slow steps towards Draco's desk.
Draco removed them from the bottom of the wardrobe, then began creating neat piles of clothes on the bed. Harry joined him, bringing a stack of Draco's books from the living room that toppled over as soon as he set them on the bed.
A ball of dread formed in the pit of Draco's stomach. Perhaps it was time to consider contacting Robards. He'd certainly get sacked for this, but that hardly seemed to matter any more.
"Right," he said after a long moment and looked at them both. "Potter." He nodded at Potter. "And Malfoy?"
The rest of summer proceeded without much fanfare. There were a lot of tourists that year, and Draco's bookshop saw a number of visitors. Thankfully, his health seemed to remain stagnant, which was more than he could ask for these days. And most nights as he closed the shop, Potter would say something like, "I'll be back with dinner," or "Chips and sandwiches tonight?"
"Your sudden disappearance will be noticed, and it's really not necessary that anyone there retains any memory of you two."
If Potter remembered anything about the night they'd shared the bed, he didn't bring it up. Neither did Draco. He didn't even thank Potter for letting him sleep there. Best to just avoid the subject entirely.
Having someone watch elevated the experience, and Draco found it difficult to keep quiet. He bit his lip as he added two, then three fingers. And when Harry wrapped a hand around his cock, he nearly collapsed onto the bed.
He sighed, skimming the report once more. Again, he was struck with the feeling that he'd missed something, but he didn't know what.
With one last look around, Harry closed the door and locked the shop, just as Draco would have done.
The look Draco gave him made Harry wish he hadn't asked. "Truth be told, I wasn't sure I'd actually use it."
Over the next week, Draco struggled with how to act around Potter. It was tempting to retreat to hostility. At least that was something familiar. Something less confusing. Something that would occupy less space in his mind.
Potter dried his hands and stepped close, placing a palm to Draco's back. "Look at the bright side," he said. "At least you don't need to go into the Ministry every day."
Draco settled against a cushion and thumbed through the pages, looking for one that seemed easy. "What else am I going to do?"
He caught sight of the Daily Prophet clipping, with Potter's stupid face looking up at him, and snatched it away just as the living, breathing version came to a halt in front of the counter.
Heat crept up Draco's face as he watched Potter. In the next moment, he felt Potter's body crushed against his as arms held him tightly. His face pressed into Potter's neck, and he instinctively drew a deep breath. Potter smelled like some kind of old world soap, and the scent coaxed Draco's eyes to close and his arms to wrap around Potter just as tightly in return. He couldn't recall the last time he'd been embraced like this, if he ever had been. Surely it was okay to just let himself experience this, enjoy it. Just this once.
And Potter looked like he was being truthful, didn't he? He looked so earnest, almost desperate. It practically radiated off him. Draco took a moment to revel in it. He didn't completely believe Potter's story, but perhaps it would be fine. After all, Potter would finish up with whatever it was and leave soon enough.
Harry sat down next to him. "Your whole house is full of nothing. And this." He shook the tin. "What is it?"
Lister pushed another button. The light went out, and the noise stopped. "Well, that's how you use it."
He opened the door and was met with a windowless, dimly lit room. Aside from a small desk up front, row after row of shelves filled the space, and Draco felt thankful for bringing the largest cup of coffee he could find.
"Now get out," Jennings said. "And if you tell anyone except Potter, I'll kill you myself. Trust me when I say nobody would miss you."
"Ok, fine." Potter nodded slowly. "New topic. Can I ask what you were doing in the village last Sunday?"
"I hate shopping," Draco said, moping into his bowl of porridge. It was Monday morning. He and Potter always did the shopping on Monday, and Draco always whinged about it.
Harry smiled, but tears ran down his face and soaked into the pillow. Even as more time had passed, nothing had become easier. He still couldn't accept this, and it was getting harder to ignore. Moments of Draco's pain snuck through, and what could Harry do? What could he say? He wondered how much Draco was hiding, but knew it would kill him to ask.
"Actually," Barclay looked around and lowered his voice, "there's more to it than that. Wilcox, the Records Keeper, died last Saturday morning."
It was so presumptuous of him, and yet Draco felt disappointed on the nights Potter just spoke to him for a few minutes and left. If he was being honest, it was nice to have something to look forward to after suffering in the tiny store room while he took his potions. But he didn't need it. He didn't need to have dinner with Potter. It was enough that he saw him everyday. And so while Draco could never ask Potter to stay, he could never turn Potter away either.
It wasn't a lot of work. Really, it only took a few minutes, but for Harry, that was a few more minutes he got to spend with Draco. They met in the back of the shop after drawing all the curtains closed. Harry knew he should say goodnight and leave, but his feet seemed unwilling to move. He craved something more and just couldn't leave like this. His whole body was fraught with tension as he stood there, transfixed by the contrast between Draco's skin and his jumper. Transfixed by the grey eyes that watched him.
Back inside, he took out his wand and cast several spells to dust the shelves, sweep the floor, and pour himself a cup of coffee. He locked his wand away in a drawer under the till and drew the curtains back to welcome the sun in, and then finally picked up his cup of coffee, which was now the perfect temperature. He'd arrived at the shop early, so there was enough time left before opening to enjoy it in the rear corner nook that faced the river. It was his favourite spot in the shop.
"I'm Emily. I live just two houses down from you with my husband, Philip." She held the cake out. "On behalf of the Kilmington Welcoming Committee, I want to formally welcome you to our charming little village."
Robards sighed and frowned. He looked as though he'd rather be anywhere but here. "We've discussed this. You must show leadership skills—"
He poured a glass of orange juice for Draco while his coffee brewed. There were blueberry muffins they'd brought back from the bookshop yesterday. He put two on a plate and left everything on the kitchen table.
Lister ignored him and indicated a larger white box fitted underneath the counter. This had a window, too, but it was circular.
"He tampered with the Ministry safe house files. There was an access entry dated the 2nd of September," Draco said. "And no, we can't go back home. He knows where we are!"
Barclay scratched his head and yawned. "Well, the access book. There's an entry created each time someone accesses any of the files." He nodded towards the book in Draco's hands.
Draco had no idea, but he hoped he did as well. At least the place seemed suitably named—Burger King.
A single, resounding crack quietened the room. Draco snapped back to attention and saw that the wizards dressed as Death Eaters had Apparated. All the Aurors and Unspeakables stood still, staring at where they'd once been.
He grinned when he felt Draco shiver, and watched him scramble off the sofa, never taking his eyes away from Harry's. His hands trembled as he undid his trousers and let them fall around his ankles. One hand rubbed the bulge of his pants, and Harry felt his mouth go dry, felt his hands reaching down to undo his own trousers and move them out of the way. He tore his jumper off and threw it on the floor, determined not to miss a moment of this erotic display.
"I don't either." It was impossible to deny how much this place felt like home. The prospect of returning to London seemed drab and constricting. Draco couldn't see stars there, nor could he smell the refreshing, woodsy perfume of the forest.
Finished unpacking everything at last, Draco sat down and plucked a flask each of his two new potions, which Whitby had instructed him to take each morning. He couldn't decide which looked less disgusting, so he uncorked both bottles, grabbed one in each hand, closed his eyes, and tossed them back in rapid succession.
Draco set the paper aside to shovel biscuits into his mouth and contemplate his life. Neither his parents nor his boss wanted him to continue working. He had no friends. And it was hard to imagine a world where Gregory Goyle would be getting married. To Astoria Greengrass, no less.
Pierce rolled over and pinned Draco to the floor, holding his hands above his head. Up close, Draco could see how far gone he was. They'd be lucky to escape this situation alive.
it, push his hands up under the fabric and touch him. There was no doubt he was interested - he could feel Draco's erection pressed against his thigh, just as Draco could probably feel Harry's. What was he waiting for? Surely he didn't need to think about
It certainly was convenient that Potter always wore joggers around the cottage. Draco pulled them off, as well as his hideous orange pants, then began lavishing attention everywhere except his erection—he could play this game as well. Draco waited until Potter squirmed with need before finally sucking lightly on the head of his cock and swirling his tongue around it, eliciting a sharp cry.
space. With any luck, it was just a singular occurrence, and Draco could continue to exist in peace.
Days like today tempted him to hand in his resignation letter. Robards just didn't care. Or listen. Or trust him. And that was never more apparent than when Draco made the slightest misstep.
Annoyed, Draco shut the compartment and set to work, making it look as though nobody had forced their way in. Hopefully, he wouldn't cock up this part.
Draco decided he believed him this time and asked more about their lives. It wasn't that he cared. As Potter blabbed, Draco only half-listened, enthralled more at the sight of him so lively and energetic. He tried to remember the last time he'd felt that way about anything, and if his eyes had ever lit up like Potter's.
They got into the car, and as Harry drove away, Draco watched their tiny cottage until it disappeared from sight.
The bonfire raged in front of them, flames stretching to the sky. It was a clear night, and stars winked at them from overhead.
The sound of Harry's scream mixed with Pierce's laughter was an eerie combination. Draco clenched his teeth and pushed himself to kneeling, but his limbs felt so shaky that he knew he'd never make it to the bedroom without Pierce catching up to him.
He talked at length about Lawrence and how much he'd learnt from him. He talked about Lawrence's wife and three daughters, none of whom were old enough to attend Hogwarts yet. He talked about Lawrence's house, and the times he'd had dinner with Lawrence's family.
He gulped the rest of his coffee and decided to pay another visit to MacDonald and Jennings. They sat in MacDonald's cubicle, huddled together in conversation, and they glared when Draco's shadow darkened the parchment they were discussing.
All throughout the day, customers would come and go, some local, some not. Draco made sure there was fresh coffee, and when pastries ran out, he'd ask one of his regulars to keep watch for the five minutes it took for him to dash across the street to Mrs. Wilder's bakery.
"I doubt you wandered here by mistake. Can you read?" He tapped the placard bearing his name next to the door.
He relayed all the information he had to Potter and mentioned Pierce and Morrell were investigating the case.
on all of them. Against his better judgement, he knelt down and opened them all. There were cards and letters. Jumpers and sweets, and a gaudy Christmas mug. He already had plenty of mugs and jumpers, and he didn't need sweets.
He saw Potter cover up a grimace behind Dorothy as he put the last of their shopping away and joined them at the table.
Except Potter was special. He was easy to talk to, and he was a good storyteller, and Draco hadn't laughed with anyone like he had with Potter. He made Draco
It was the last thing Draco needed. He had long ago severed any meaningful relationships. He had, in fact, cut ties with the entire Wizarding world, save for Whitby. It had been an ordeal, and he'd worked hard since then to always keep some distance between himself and those who knew him.
It was better than good, better than he had imagined. And Draco had spent a lot of time imagining this over the last few days.
He launched himself out of bed and flung the window open to take several chest-clearing breaths of cold air.
At the shop the next morning, Draco looked over the small selection of astronomy books and chose one to read while he sat at the counter. He became so engrossed in it that he completely lost track of the time until Potter's voice interrupted him.
A weak spear of sunlight poked through the clouds, highlighting the dormant grasses and shrubs that dotted the countryside.
"Some old guy. He knew where all the files are and how they're organised. And he kept watch of what went in and out of this room."
"Brilliant." Potter positively beamed, and Draco was slightly taken aback. "How long do you think you'll need?"
Draco realised Potter was talking about Lawrence and stilled. "I don't know what you want me to do."
While the coffee brewed, Harry started a fire and shoved his papers and notebooks on the dining table to the side. On the table, he set out some milk, toast, butter, and jam. Mrs. Wilder sat on the sofa and pulled out a magazine from her handbag. When he placed a carafe full of hot coffee on the table, she looked up and smiled.
He stood shakily and stumbled out of the office and along the winding corridor to make his way back to the lift. His mind raced, and everything felt twisted and wrong.
Draco stood up and stretched, then got ready for bed. He stayed awake reading even after sliding beneath the blankets.
"Many of you have met these two young men already, I'm sure," Rosemary said. "They married just before moving to our lovely village, and I've been told they didn't have a proper celebration with friends and family. To show how glad we are to have them here, let's have them lead us into our next dance!"
Draco's mind raced. He didn't like this. But Harry had a point. It was best not to give away their location unless they were absolutely certain it had been compromised. Relocation had potential security flaws as well.
And that proved challenging when he realised he had to wait until someone entered one of the lifts in order to remain inconspicuous.
They'd fallen into discussing the case regularly at dinner, and Draco had spent much of his free time over the last two weeks reading the case file and considering it from every angle. Still, nothing leapt out at him, and Potter hadn't been able to remember anything new.
It was dark outside by the time they finally finished working that evening. Draco trudged through the Atrium and could hardly summon the energy to Apparate.
Draco nodded numbly and went back to his desk. But trying to focus on work was hopeless. Perhaps he should just go home.
He finally stood and went to put on his shoes and jacket. He shut the door behind him with a soft click and locked it. His head leaned forward to rest against the worn wood.
Robards threw the stack of parchment onto his desk. "Are you trying to kill me? I'm doing what I can to give you what you've asked for."
He was in the Atrium when he remembered—he'd meant to make a copy of the case file in Lawrence's desk. Thankfully, everyone on Level Two had gone home already, so it was trivial for Draco to break into Lawrence's desk and duplicate the thick file.
Potter looked over his shoulder. Their gazes met, and Draco froze. Without thinking, he stood and walked to Potter, who was sweating.
If there was one person who came close to being as annoying and smarmy as Potter, it was Pierce. And there he was, spooning the last of the coffee grounds into his cup.
Draco didn't have to say anything after that, which was good, because only half-formed fragments of thoughts appeared in his head. The metal bed frame squeaked in concert with the slap of skin on skin as Harry thrust into him over and over, and Draco reached to wrap a hand around his cock.
shop, after all. But he stood behind the counter, frozen in indecision all day. He didn't trust himself not to get into a shouting match with Potter, which was the last thing he wanted among all these people who had no idea of their past.
"Harry," he corrected. He rubbed his eyes and reached for his glasses, then caught sight of the clock.
They collapsed onto the pillows afterwards in a warm tangle of limbs. There was still a lot of packing to do, and now they had to shower as well, but none of that mattered. Draco felt quite certain that this was one of those rare perfect moments in life.
They met in the middle, in the back. Draco fetched his wand, and Potter brought his out. "I usually just cast some charms to clean up a bit. Put all the books back, straighten the cushions, clean all the dishes and the coffee pot. That sort of thing."
Draco glared. "You don't expect me to believe you've come all the way out here for coffee," he spat.
The radio went silent, and Rosemary stepped up to the microphone. Draco excused himself and went to the toilet whilst she spoke. He didn't have any interest in what she had to say.
"I might've dressed better for someone who wasn't a Death Eater," Lewis sneered, and his eyes narrowed into a glare as he stood from his chair. "I don't have to take this, you know. I can do much better than you." He threw his serviette on the table and left.
Draco didn't blink as Harry turned onto Newtons Orchard, and he flung his door open as soon as the car halted in front of their tiny cottage.
He didn't know how to deal with people when they were like this, and whilst a part of him wanted to comfort Potter, another part of him wanted to disappear and come back later, once Potter had sorted himself out.
Draco's mind flitted between trying to discern which Ministry employee could be a murderer and his feelings for Potter, which seemed to be fuelled by more than mere lust. But that was all this was to Potter, a spot of fun, which made Draco's longing pierce his heart with a knife-like pain.
They had moved him around to different cubicles in his six years as an Auror, and he knew the desks all had a secret compartment in the same location. Not very secret, he had to admit. But they could be locked, and most people combined this with protective enchantments.
Draco frowned as he stepped into his pants and trousers. "Potter, please. Everyone talks in these small villages."
They stumbled to the bedroom and fell onto the bed in a tangled heap of arms and legs. Draco wasn't certain what to do with his hands—one clumsily lifted Potter's jumper and shirt up whilst the other wormed its way underneath the waistband of his trousers. His mind had been overtaken by a primal need to feel Potter's skin, and he didn't care how.
When Whitby finally put his wand down to make some more scribbles on his parchment, Draco crossed his legs and asked, "So how much time have I got left? A week? Two?"
Draco stewed and pecked at his food. Potter went to buy another pint and returned with a gaggle of Muggles. He introduced Draco to all of them. There were Mark and Mary, who looked similar but weren't related; Lydia, who had long blonde hair and seemed shy; and Craig and Elizabeth, who were married but seemed about as close as Draco and Potter were. They all dragged chairs over and began chattering about useless Muggle things, like football, the cost of petrol, and who was dating whom in the village.
"There's been so little talk of Hallowe'en," Draco said as they drove home. "Don't Muggles celebrate?"
Harry ran his hand through Draco's hair again. "I love you, you know." He hadn't even planned to say it, but the words fell out so easily.
"I don't know if I can do that," Draco said. He watched Potter trace a finger over the bones in his hand. When had his skin become so waxy and translucent? "I'll just be thinking about how much I'm going to hurt you. You've already lost so many people."
"Sorry," Harry said, even though he wasn't very sorry at all. In fact, it felt like he was marking Draco as his own, and he rather liked that idea. "That's why there are cleaning spells."
The way Harry kissed him back and grasped at him sent shivers down Draco's spine, and he threw a leg around one of Harry's and ground their hips together.
"I'm writing," he said with a smile. He held up the thing propped against his knee, which turned out to be a black leather notebook.
today. Draco tried to imagine how the conversation might go, what he might say to Potter. He hadn't felt this way about someone in a long time. That it was Potter who made him feel this way was somehow embarrassing, but he couldn't deny it any longer.
Draco pulled his gaze away from the chaos and met Harry's plaintive expression. "Do you think we're coming back?"
By the time he closed the shop, Draco felt as though he'd drunk ten cups of coffee. He bade farewell to the last customers and made short work of locking the door and yanking all the curtains shut as soon as the shop was empty. He haphazardly cast his usual charms to restore order to the place. He barely even registered the discomfort and pain from taking his potions. Nothing could compare to the way he was feeling after his disastrous conversation with Potter the night before, it seemed.
"I'm okay," Harry lied. He imagined Draco in that chair, and he just couldn't. "I just wanted to return this." He placed the tin on the edge of the desk and slid it towards Whitby. "Thanks, by the way," he mumbled. "For helping him."
Potter nodded and stood leaning against the counter for a long moment before saying, "Well, you know where I'll be."
Draco looked into his bowl of porridge. It was their last breakfast here. They'd decided to go back to Harry's flat in London after the celebration that night.
"It wasn't quite like that," Draco muttered. He spilled a small amount of milk into his tea and stirred.
"Are you annoyed about Bonfire Night?" Potter asked, setting a package of chicken into the trolley and ticking it off their list.
"Here, just watch me—" Draco reached for the map Harry had splayed open, but Harry snatched it out of reach, crumpling up several of the sections.
Potter looked at Draco then with such desire that his breath hitched. He wondered if his own expression mirrored Potter's and groaned as Potter began bobbing his head in earnest.
As the days grew shorter and the leaves lost their vibrant green colouring, the civility that Draco had grown used to gradually turned into something else. Something undefinable.
Draco climbed on top of him again and pressed their foreheads together. He took Potter's hand and guided it back until Potter's fingers pressed against him.
Draco stepped towards him, thinking about how he'd like to wipe the smirk off his face with his fist.
He set the card out of sight, where he wouldn't have to think about it or Potter, and sank into the scalding water.
Harry wavered sharply between despondency and almost painful desire. He did some thinking of his own, trying to convince himself that Draco had a point, that it would hurt too much to be with him. He had lost so many other people in his life already - too many - and he well remembered the grief from each loss.
Christmas had been lonely. Draco had been alone for years, and he'd become quite accustomed to it. So this loneliness over the holidays was very unwelcome. He’d slept poorly and spent a lot of time thinking. He couldn't get Potter out of his head. The lack of sleep chipped away at him, and at some point, he began considering going to Potter's house. Just to see him.
Sometimes Potter asked Draco questions about his life, and they weren't simple enough for a 'yes' or 'no' response. In the interest of not spoiling the civility that had emerged between them, Draco kept his voice even and gave bland answers.
It was maddeningly slow for how badly Draco wanted to come, and he felt almost dizzy with need. He looked down to watch Potter's hand sliding up and down his cock, and he didn't think he'd ever seen anything so erotic in his life. It felt so good and seemed so natural that Potter's hands should be on him, and he leant forwards to kiss him.
Draco gave a curt nod and watched as he turned on the spot and vanished with a crack. He stared at the clearing for several minutes, then looked up at the sky. He tried to find Orion, even though he had no idea what he was supposed to look for.
Lewis's plate sat across the table, untouched. The risotto looked gluey and unappetising now that it had cooled.
Draco inched closer to him until their bodies nearly pressed together. Heat radiated from Potter, which felt incredible against Draco's skin. Being this close to him was almost as intoxicating as all that ale he'd drunk.
A sheepish grin broke out over Potter's face. "Sorry. I just like to help. If there's anything I can do..."
He kept a steady pace the rest of the way back to the cottage, where he marched them right past it, through the patch of asters, and into the forest. Only when they arrived at the clearing where Whitby had Apparated earlier did he stop. "Same time next month?"
"I owe you a night, and I've decided it'll be tonight." He opened one eye to see Potter's mouth hanging open.
But Potter strolled in each afternoon, much to Draco's dismay. He hung his wet coat to drip all over the rug and poured himself a cup of coffee before disappearing within the shelves.
He put everything away before returning to the cards and letters. It amazed him that after so long, people still insisted on contacting him. When were they going to figure it out? When were they going to just bloody give up already?
Harry swirled his tongue around Draco's cock once more before pushing his legs down and shifting to climb on top of him.
"Well, we've been administering potions to help you feel comfortable." He indicated the instruments on the table. "If you're in too much discomfort, we can always give you more."
Yes, somebody wanted to kill Harry, but he was safe for now. Nobody knew where they were, and they'd find the culprit. It wasn't going to happen tonight, and that was fine. Tonight, they had each other.
Pierce leant against the countertop and shrugged. "Don't need to be. Why would anyone give a promotion to a Death Eater?"
"Don't tell me you didn't finish those fucking budget reports last week. There were only a few left."
"You were in shock. You might've missed something," Draco said. "Please, Potter. I want to help." He wasn't accustomed to begging, but Draco realised then he truly wanted to help him.
"Honestly, get out. We can handle this," MacDonald said. She turned to swat Jennings with her quill and added, "You should've Obliviated him."
Draco ignored him and tried several spells to unlock the door. They didn't work either. He shoved his wand in his pocket and leant back against the wall, crossing his arms.
Draco nodded. "Were you planning to come back? To the shop. My shop, I mean." He was too nervous. Perhaps this was a mistake.
Maybe this had been a mistake. He couldn't remember why he came back, if he even had a reason. He hadn't been sleeping well, and he needed some time alone after the funeral. Anyone would.
Dorothy's eyes widened. "Oh, is that how you two met? Risky, isn't it, to date someone you work with?"
"Too late," Draco said, and he began counting again. "Just think of it as maintaining our image. If we're solicitors, we shouldn't be poor."
Even though it had been months since he'd last set foot inside, Harry still felt compelled to visit everyday, still felt a pang of sadness when he realised he couldn't, that it hurt too much.
He talked for a long time about Lawrence's hobbies, and the tricks he liked to play on people, and the way he always treated Potter like someone normal, not like some precious figure who belonged on a pedestal.
Harry ran a hand through his messy hair, and Draco realised he was shaking. "I know. I just… Lawrence didn't have to die. He has a family."
That night, it was impossible to fall asleep. Draco flopped this way and that on the bed. He eventually sighed and heaved himself onto his side to watch Harry. Usually, the rise and fall of his chest could soothe and coax Draco to sleep if he had difficulty doing so.
A swish of scarlet robes flew past the cubicle opening, and Draco nearly dropped his wand. He froze, hardly daring to breathe, and listened for any hint of who was here.
Draco sucked in a breath and bit his lip. He was already naked, but the intimacy of the moment stripped back another layer that left him feeling even more exposed and vulnerable. He gave Potter a sloppy kiss and pressed back against the welcome intrusion.
"Brilliant," Jeremy said. "Oh, here they are." He waved to three people who stepped into the pub and were removing their jackets.
Draco was too hungry to protest, so they tucked into their food. He was fond of chicken and ham pie, and he had to admit to himself that this one was especially good.
That did little to quell his nerves, however. He crept into Jennings' cubicle and set to work breaking into his desk. He didn't know whether he should feel disturbed or grateful that it wasn't too troublesome to do this. It should have been impossible.
Potter had strode through the door like he owned the place. Shock froze both of them as their eyes met, and as realisation hit, Draco felt his face contort into a rictus of horror. Before he could say anything, Potter cocked his head and gave an uncertain nod. Draco did not return it, nor did Potter seem to expect it. He disappeared amid the shelves. God, the nerve.
He shifted over until they sat so close their thighs pressed together. Potter placed a hand on Draco's leg and squeezed lightly.
"Safe house locations. Those would all be stored in the bloody Confidential Records Office." Harry slapped a hand to his forehead. "Fuck, how did we miss that?"
Draco shivered after he left Robards' office from their one-to-one. It hadn't been a good meeting, and he didn't think he could risk going to interview his list of suspects, but he certainly didn't relish the idea of going back to the Confidential Records Office. He needed more coffee for that, and he wasn't sure his stomach could handle more.
Potter took a deep breath. "I don't know." He looked at Draco and gave a small smile. "But at least we'll have some fun before then, right?"
It took considerable effort on Draco's part to keep from touching himself. He downed the rest of his tea and cleaned himself as quickly as possible. He didn't bother putting clothes on and instead wrapped a towel around his waist.
"That's all right, I can wait." Potter smiled with what Draco suspected was supposed to be encouragement. Under the safety of the counter, he tugged at his sleeves.
"That's everything," Rosemary said. "We'll reconvene next week at the same time,." She motioned to Potter. "Let's chat before you leave, dear."
Potter loosened his grip on Draco's hand and began rubbing in the dips between his knuckles. "In a way, I guess, yeah. And I still think we should make the most of the time you have left."
"Your turn," Potter said with a glint in his eyes, and he used the same light, lazy strokes Draco had.
Harry worked until his hand cramped, then put down his pen and stretched. His eyes darted to the clock, and his heart skipped a beat when he saw how late it had gotten.
In the kitchen, he chose the largest cup he could find in the cupboard and added several heaping spoonfuls of coffee grounds. It was a lot, but this was going to be dull work.
"I don't want to keep track of who sleeps where on a day-to-day basis. That's a pain in the arse I don't need."
Potter didn't pull away until he seemed certain Draco had finished. He dragged his lips around the head of Draco's cock and pressed a kiss to it before turning his gaze up and grinning.
Draco surely enjoyed a slow, sensual night of sex, but tonight wasn't one of those times. Perhaps it was learning that the threat to Harry was much closer to home, but something in the last two days had ignited a fervent, deeply rooted need within Draco. He wanted to be as close to Harry as possible. He wanted to feel him and see him vulnerable and unable to contain his pleasure.
Draco waited until the sound of his footsteps faded before daring to move again. As quickly and deftly as possible, he worked to restore the enchantments to the secret compartment in MacDonald's desk. Then he poked his head over the cubicle wall.
"Harry," he said, and that more than anything brought Harry's focus back. "I know we've been avoiding the issue, but I think we need to talk about this. About what's going to happen to me." Draco reached for the tin and placed it on the coffee table, then pulled Harry to him.
Potter sat up and yanked his jumper and shirt over his head, tossing them on the floor. He kicked his shoes off and scrambled out of his trousers and pants. "Your turn," he said, taking his erection in hand and stroking it slowly.
The entire world felt different as Draco strode through the Atrium on Friday morning. A heavy cloud of portent seemed to hang over everything. People looked at Draco differently, and he warded them off with a glare.
. "Obviously. But I mean, you kind of disappeared. And nobody knows where. Not even your friends." He cocked his head. "Not even your parents."
Draco tried to keep a neutral face and nodded at Potter, who was dressed in hideous old clothes and sweating as though he'd been doing some sort of manual labour. His skin was red, and bits of his hair stuck to his face.
He breathed a sigh of relief as he closed the bedroom door, grateful to be in the comforting blanket of darkness. He flopped onto the bed and fell asleep almost immediately.
When Potter turned off the lamp, the room went completely dark. Clouds must have moved over the area, blocking the moon and starlight from shining.
For a year, they stayed with Harry. They coaxed him out of bed and downstairs each day to eat, to shower, to sit with them while they just talked and carried on like normal. Eventually, he began to regain his strength and made half-hearted contributions to their conversations, remembering how to smile again occasionally. They never questioned him, never laughed when he sometimes left abruptly to lock himself in his bedroom. They never pushed him to do or be anything more than he was comfortable with. They were just there for him, a comforting presence, a reminder of normalcy, an anchor to reality, and eventually, Harry began to feel better.
"Yeah. Well, they never sold it. The deed was in my vault at Gringotts. I'd been asking Hermione to visit mine every now and then, whenever I needed money. One day, she found the deed under a pile of galleons."
Draco knew he hadn't paid this much attention to him at the start of their assignment, but he couldn't remember what it was like not to notice Potter. His mind seemed determined to latch onto every detail, and more than once over the next week, Potter caught Draco watching him.
Draco tutted. "It never ends. Every day, I learn something new about Muggles that makes me glad I'm a wizard."
"Yes." Draco kept his gaze on his tea and stirred slowly. "Robards hates me. I'm still at the junior level."
Draco knocked on the door and fidgeted. It felt as though he stood waiting forever, but the door finally opened, revealing a tall man with wild brown hair that stuck out in all directions. His entire face seemed to droop down at the sides, including his moustache.
Draco thought about the report Potter would eventually submit to Robards once this was all over and decided he'd better not push his luck.
Draco paused mid-chew, certain his heart was going to pound out of his chest. He realised Potter was watching him and dragged his fork through a pool of gravy.
He tried to swallow, though his mouth had gone dry. He had to do something, but he didn't want to rouse Potter.
"Wait!" Draco leapt from his chair and reached for Harry. At the same moment Draco grabbed his arm, Harry turned on the spot to Apparate.
"Unfortunate, isn't it?" Robards traced his mouth with a finger as he thought. "Well, think of this as a character-building exercise."
But the Kilmington countryside wasn't bad, especially once they veered off the road and into the forest. It was almost nice, actually.
He drained his mug of tea and went to the bedroom. He looked around to take stock of the situation and frowned. Somehow, they had accumulated a wealth of stuff.
Draco closed his eyes as he thought for a moment. "There is no difference." It didn't matter if there was.
Potter ignored him and scanned his shopping list. "I think this should be enough to get us started. Let's go."
Potter thought for a moment and shook his head slowly. "I'm really not sure. I don't think it has to do with our case, though."
"I don't really have that luxury." He winced at the look on Potter's face. "Sorry. I - erm. Just give me a week."
Draco woke up when the sun poured in through his bedroom windows. He showered, changed, and ate breakfast while reading The Daily Prophet. It was his only real link to the Wizarding World.
Draco paused again. Turned back around. There was another chair. And he so desperately wanted to know what Potter was doing here, so that he could enjoy kicking his arse out even more.
He spoke with Barclay before meeting with Robards and learnt that he'd been confined to desk work in Draco's absence.
Potter narrowed his eyes, then flipped his cards over to reveal a pair of nines and a pair of queens.
That was how Draco ended up placing bets on every question. He lost every single time and ended up buying several rounds of drinks for the entire table.
"That's not fair," Draco shot back. "They've all decided they hate me before even getting to know me. They've been listening to Potter." He sneered. "And so have you."
Draco rolled his eyes, but he didn't move. He watched the rain fall. He watched Potter's jacket continue to drip. He wondered what the hell Potter was doing in his shop.
Sometimes Potter came into the shop a little earlier on Saturday. Draco tried to read his book, but it was a clear, brisk day, and the shop was uncharacteristically busy. His mouth went dry each time the door opened, and he gave a pained smile to everyone that walked in.
. Halfway through a plate of Jaffa Cakes and a cup of tea, the front door opened and Potter stepped inside.
Jennings nodded. "It's got to be, especially considering how much they would've needed for this potion. Odd choice…"
