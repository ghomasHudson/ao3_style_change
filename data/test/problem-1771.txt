I need to stop talking now. So, I hope all of you are having happy holidays and are using them well to rest and do fun things. I certainly am :) As always, thanks for reading and let me know what you think!
"Yes, there is," Draco whined, "I asked her out on Friday, right? And she still hasn't given me a proper answer! Do you know what day it is today?"
The wrapping was torn off in no more than a second. Haley couldn't look. It had been a stupid idea. She knew it! Malfoy was lifting off the top now…
"Are you hungry?" Haley asked, as the boy sat down next to her. "I brought some sandwiches from the kitchens." She unpacked a couple of sandwiches and additional sweet treats Dobby had practically forced onto her from her bag and spread them out in front of them.
Recognizing the peace offering, her friend gave her a soft smile and sat on the bed next to her, leaning her head against the headboard.
"Good morning!" A high voice greeted from behind her. She turned around trying not to groan. One of the Creeveys. What did he want this time?
But it was Potter after all and therefore he really should have known she wasn't going to give up so easily. All week she had tried to confront him until she had finally succeeded in catching him off guard today.
When Haley had noticed Ron eyeing Hermione hesitantly, she had snatched Neville's arm and declared she was going to pair up with him.
A strange rustling noise broke through her thoughts. It came from the middle of the room, where something blurry and white seemed to be wreaking havoc inside her trunk. Sleepily, she reached for her glasses. Then she slipped out of the bed and tapped over to her trunk.
Stealing the petals was almost too easy. So, when Draco sneaked out of Snape's supply closet, he wasn't too surprised when someone intercepted him.
"I can't tell whether you're impressed or trying to catch flies," Malfoy disrupted her staring, sounding annoyingly amused. She closed her mouth, which had apparently been hanging open.
Slowly, the girl walked toward the sitting area, frantically debating what to tell her godfather. She heavily sank down into the old, uncomfortable armchair that had definitely seen better days, so she was seated more next to him than opposite him.
What did mum say? If my intentions aren't bad, the fire won't hurt me? I take a deep breath and close my eyes, reaching into the cauldron again until… I feel a cool liquid on my skin. At the bottom of the cauldron I feel dozens of keys. Which one is the right one? Should I just pick one and try it out? There is a magnetic pull that leads my fingers to a key somewhere on the left. It's warm to the touch so I close my fingers around it and pull it out of the cauldron.
This chapter was 11 pages, I swear. It shrinks to absolute nothingness when you read it on your laptop xD Anyway, I'll hopefully update sooner this time. As always, I enjoy reading your feedback!
“Let’s move on shall we? Malfoy said you were going to take me into town to buy me clothes. Anything else you want to do while we’re out?” Harry raked his hand through his hair. It was long, a mess, and everything he wished it wouldn’t be if he were honest. Luna looked him up and down, and a bright look appeared on her face.
“Why are we going to the end of the hall?” He asked her. She waved at him to come with her, so he ran after her, down the hall.
Harry felt Draco before he heard him. The thick air filled the hallway in waves, like back in the commons, during the tour. It felt as if it had a smell, a stench of fear maybe, musk. The servants were terrified of him, especially the women. Harry was new, he knew that, and he would learn.
Harry walked over to the closet, and took a look inside. There were clothes everywhere, everything was sorted out neatly. The shirts were hung up and in color order. The shirts that didn’t fit on hangers were piled neatly in opened drawers, with pants and shorts of the like. Draco’s shoes were arranged along the bottom side of the closet walls. There was another door inside the closet, a small personal armory. Harry opened the door fully, and walked inside. The room was bigger than the actual walk-in closet, and he had to have guessed it was the work of magic.
Frustration bubbled inside him, but he understood where Draco was coming from. The girl was showing a weakness and if Harry had tried to help something bad might’ve happened to him. As to what would have happened, he didn’t know, but both Luna and Draco seemed against the aura of this castle and the people who lived in it.
“Don’t be. It’s not your fault.” Luna whispered and looked away. "She took a deep breath in, and Harry waited, anticipating her next words. “Harry,” and he looked at her, “My name is Luna Lovegood.”
“No, Malfoy. That’s not it. It's just- We don’t really know each other, how can you say we’re friends when we’re not on the same level. I’m your servant, Malfoy. There’s nothing more to it than that.” Yet. Harry didn’t say that part. He knew they were more civil to one another than they had in the past, but he couldn’t see them ever being friends with the standpoint they were at now. “I didn’t mean to hurt you, but it’s the truth.I wish you would stop asking about me and Luna, you always jump to the same conclusion. I’ll keep saying it until you believe me. I don’t like her like that.”
Harry winced. “Well that was because I didn’t want you to get weird over what Luna said, you have the tendency to assume there’s something between me and Luna. I didn’t mean for you to take offense to what I said. I think you look perfectly fine without clothes on from what I’ve seen.”
“You like that?” Draco asked him. Harry nodded. “Are you finished?” Harry nodded again, and wiped his hands on his pants. “Good. Now clean it up.”
“All of it. Everything. At least, what she told me, was true.” Harry spoke, his eyes meeting Hermione’s. Her eyes widened as his narrowed, she swallowed and nodded. She believed him. What Ron thought of him didn’t matter though, the idiot probably thought everything Harry had said was a story as well.
The kitchen was quiet, save for a few servants grilling up some meat, and others cutting up fruits and vegetables. There was a taller man with long hair standing over a giant cutting board. He turned around and bowed to Draco, who nodded in return. The man wiped his hands on a towel, and walked over to greet Harry, hand extended. Harry took his hand and shook it firmly.
Draco smirked, and Cedric chuckled, before walking out of the room. Harry looked up at the blonde, confused. Draco gestured to the dirty dishes on the table.
Harry let out a deep sigh and began taking mental pictures of how the armor was put together, before taking it apart. He set each piece away from the next, while also keeping it in a good order so he knew how to put it back together. If he got confused he’d ask Draco, and then ask Hermione later if she could teach him.
Sorry for having it up late, I ended up getting the flu for two whole weeks. I’m instead going to put up a chapter a month at least, but since this whole quarantine thing is going on I’ll see if I write more.
“Maybe it’ll teach you not to spread stupid shit, Thomas.” Draco’s voice was dark. A shiver ran down Harry’s spine at the tone Draco used. He looked back over to Harry who was watching them all, and growled, “Don’t listen to him, he’s a git.”
“Shut up, Ron! He was in the middle of saying something!” She turned and glowered at him. He opened his mouth, and shut it, and opened it again.
“How often does Malfoy come here to visit Princess Pansy?” He didn’t like to say her name, it felt bitter on his tongue. He wondered simply out of curiosity, because Hermione had made it seem like she had seen Astoria many times. Astoria hadn’t nulled that thought either when she said she’d preferred the company of Hermione either.
“Why were you seeking shelter in the castle Harry?” She turned her body towards him, her back to Ron. Ron pulled her blanket softly around her back, making sure it didn’t snag on the blankets.
Draco side glanced him, “What Potter? Miss me?” His voice was quieter, but the snark weighed heavy on the sentence. Harry shrugged,
“Let’s get going shall we? We’ve spent long enough packing. We won’t be leaving in the morning, we’ll be leaving now as to not upset my father worse.” Draco grunted, hopping into his saddle.
Harry sighed. He’ll never get through to her like this. He just shrugged and responded, “Well he’s not a fucking good one either.” He couldn’t help but think back to when Draco had apologized, and he suddenly felt bad for bringing up the broom incident again. He did say he had forgiven Draco and here he was talking bad about him in earshot.
“Don’t you mean Loony Lovegood?” Ron chuckled. Hermione swatted him on the shoulder, but then turned back to Harry. Harry was glaring at Ron, feeling protective over Luna.
He stared out the big stained glass windows, and saw a girl. She was blonde, pretty, and taking care of the horses. Her skin looked too perfect, her hands too dainty for her to have been a servant, but Harry didn't remember seeing her at breakfast that morning.
“Maybe a boy then,” Harry mumbled to himself. Draco moved suddenly, and stared at Harry with wide eyes. Harry couldn’t read his expression, seeing only blatant shock. Harry blushed and shook his head. He couldn’t tell if Luna had also heard him, but he figured she knew anyway without him saying anything.
“Thank you for the help Harry, give Cedric my thanks for a wonderful dinner,” Luna smiled at Harry. She touched his hand gingerly with her own, before skipping out of the room. Draco was the last to leave, standing up from his chair slowly. Harry wandered over to him.
The man smiled at him as Luna explained the situation. The barber looked delighted to be working on someone so close to royalty, though in Harry’s mind he wasn’t even close. Not after that spat they’d had earlier. His chest ached from the memory.
Harry’s eyes widened as he stared back at Draco, the blonde was smirking. He uncrossed his arms and started walking towards Harry, his black suit defining his body well. Harry shut his eyes and cowered a little as Draco neared him, and he cursed at himself mentally for showing fear. When he opened his eyes Draco was not in front of him, but instead walking back towards Hermione and Ron.
Malfoy glared between the two of them, locking eyes with Luna seemly waiting for something that never came. He relaxed and glanced back to Harry, who stood confused. “Do you want her to stay here and watch you change?”
“Why, Draco you look positively relaxed, have you done something different in your relaxation practices?” Astoria asked, leaning over the table slightly in interest.
“Perhaps I could ask him tonight, before the ball. Maybe he’d tell me who he has in mind,” Harry handed his clothes to the retailer woman. Luna paid her a hefty sum. The woman smiled and patted her hand. Harry knew it was Draco’s money but he didn’t like the idea of someone spending so much money on him. He’d have to figure out a way to give something back. Though, what was he supposed to give to a person who already has everything?
“She has a bamboo sheet and I was turned away from her.” Harry admitted, he’d rather tell the truth than get caught in a lie. “I can assure you, again, that I’m not interested in her that way Malfoy. In any way actually, not more than a friend.”
“She just says that cause she may walk in on one of us naked, and I don’t think any girl would want to see that,” Harry laughed, and glanced at Draco. His heart dropped into his stomach when he saw a pained expression flitter across Draco's face. No, no no. That’s not what he’d meant. As quick as the expression appeared, it disappeared. Draco smirked,
“I said, clean it up.” Draco demanded, shoving Harry down on his knees. Harry began to pick up the pieces carefully, as not to cut himself. “Come on, Potter. We don’t have all day.”
“You may punish me as you wish later, but please spare him if he is not guilty of anything. I could teach him to clean, he would make an excellent servant if given a chance,” The girl held her hand in front of his face as she spoke to the woman. He watched through the girl's fingers as the woman crossed her arms and turned her glare to the girl.
He couldn’t hold himself back from gently caressing the bruise and leaning forward to rest his forehead in the crook of Draco’s neck. He just wanted to give the smallest of comforts to his Prince. Draco breathed out deeply only for his breath to catch when he tried to breathe back in. Harry’s hands were splayed on the small of Draco’s back.
“You made such a mess. Mop it all up.” Draco gestured to the area. Harry looked around, and it looked clean. He wasn't about to question the prince, so he left the room and grabbed a bucket and rag from a closet in the hall.
The two walked down to the kitchen, where Ron was already waiting the the food. Although his courses were for the servants. Hermione and Ron made small greetings in passing. Harry nodded his hello to Ron.
“You seem very fashionable, everything you wear is in good taste. You look really handsome in anything you own, while I can’t tell the difference between blue and black in certain cases.” Harry heaved a sigh, and looked down at his outfit. Maybe if he had better clothes, his tastes would improve? He seemed to dress Draco well but he could bet Draco would look good in anything, the damn prat.
He walked down an aisle of tables showcasing matching tops and bottoms. He wondered how he’d look in blue, or maybe brown. He grabbed a shirt and noticed it was an expensive material, he didn't have the money for that. Before he set it down, he noticed a red shirt tucked underneath the one he’d picked up. He gently moved the shirt aside and picked up the red shirt, it had a golden trim along the laces. It was a long sleeved shirt, something he could perhaps wear a lighter jacket over. It didn’t seem too expensive, so he decided he could wear it tonight.
Colin clapped his hands together and gasped, “Why yes, actually. She’s right down the hall from you. I shall show you the way.”
“What’s your horses name?” Harry asked. Draco rose an eyebrow at the question. Harry shrugged, he figured it would be better to get off such a depressing and serious discussion. He didn’t want to push Draco to far and end up hurt, either of them.
He knew his boots were perfectly fine. He wouldn’t trade them for the world, his father had lined them with the fur of an animal he’d caught. They’d smelled like death for a week, but he had loved the initial softness of them. To this day he loved the warmth they brang. They were a dark brown, which matched many of the things he owned. They matched the pants he wore, even the black pants didn’t look too terrible with them. He kept the brown pants on and tried on the red long sleeved shirt.
her talk to form coherent words. If it hadn't been for his long experience with keeping his true feelings under control, he might have accidently smiled at her. It had been quite endearing, seeing her this nervous, with one hand tinkering around with... something.
The world around them started spinning and only seconds later, they were back in the potion master's office. Good. It looked like Snape wasn't back yet. Still, it was only a matter of time until he would be.
Malfoy who still has that creepy smile on his face. Malfoy who is still leaning over my doppelgänger, pushing some strands out of her face with his dirty hands. I'm going insane!
Another trick? Another way to get under her skin? She didn't know. All she could do was wait and see what happened.
Was he referring to her argument with Neville? He couldn’t have missed that. The whole school had seen it. “It was nothing.” She shook her head, wondering how much he had heard from their ‘conversation’.
"I couldn't… be with you… knowing I was the reason he was like this." He explained like it was logical in any way.
He blinks at me owlishly. That's when I realise my poor choice of words. I guess I'll have to be a bit more gentle. "Right. So… why don't you try apologizing? That's what people usually do when they make a mistake."
"Just stop it! There's no way you're going to talk me into thinking, becoming a Death Eater is the same as fighting for Dumbledore!"
Hello everyone! I think this might be one of my favourite chapters. What did you think? I hope the quidditch scene makes sense. It was awfully hard to write... But it paid off... I think.
Haley sank to the ground, leaning against the tree and sighed. She couldn't deal with the suspense. She still didn't know what her friend
"Neville?" She asked, touching his wrist softly. The moment he looked at her, a spark exploded from his wand, which he was clutching tightly, and burned her fingers. She pulled them away in surprise. "
"It doesn't have to be exceptionally big." He interlaced his fingers with hers. "Just make it big enough to fit me… and you."
Her body had moved on its own accord then. Just like it was now. When had she decided to pick up the chopsticks lying next to the bowl? When had she instructed her hand to dip them into the soup, snatch up a bite of noodles and vegetables, sprinkled with sesame and navigate everything toward her mouth? (When had she even opened her mouth?)
Haley squeezed his arm once, before removing her hand and blindly reaching for her cup of tea. It wasn't there.
way, causing her gaze to fall to the ground dejectedly. It simply wasn't right. Potter never looked like this. She was strong and fierce and proud! Not… not…
As the kisses turned from hurried to more languid ones, Haley let her fingers wander across his chest, cursing the robes that were stopping her from actually feeling his skin.
When she held out her hand to take back her present, Malfoy shook his head and took a step closer to her instead. He placed his arms around her neck and fastened the clasp with quick fingers. Haley swore he took a deep breath before stepping back again. The boy's eyes lingered on her collar bone, where the fairy was sitting, for a moment. Then he looked up into her eyes.
"Um… it looked fun… It's a shame I never took Ancient Runes," Haley replied, opening the thick volume that was titled
They made their way down to the dungeons. Occasionally stopping, when they heard suspicious noises. She really should have brought her Map. But in the end they arrived in front of the blank wall that served as an entrance to the Slytherin common room without any more trouble.
"Fine," he replied with a sigh. He ran his hand through his hair that was free of gel once more. He had worn it like that a few times over the past weeks.
Haley tore the leather band off her wrist, frantically shoving it into the drawer beside her bed. "It's just… you know, I've been trying to…"
Nevertheless, I open my eyes and find myself inside my dorm. Unfortunately I'm not lying in my bed. To my immense horror, I'm standing on the window sill. And the window is open.
Draco woke up from a sharp pain in his earlobe. He cursed, sitting up in his bed and reaching for his wand.
"This looks amazing," Haley breathed, wondering which of the treats she should try first. The fairies had left them alone again. Well, except for one, that was sprawled over the edge of her saucer. She watched the two of them curiously, the slow fluttering of her wings ringing like bells. Maybe she was lingering, in case they needed anything else?
Potter, it seemed, didn't like his suggestion one bit. Draco noticed a dangerous glint in her eyes that hadn't been there before.
"Pardon?" The man lifted an eyebrow in question, not even looking at him. He was treating him like an unruly teenager.
What a stupid idea. How could she have done something this reckless? Well, if she was honest, Haley hadn't dared to steal more than a few glances at the Slytherin during breakfast. And she had hated that she couldn't just go over and talk to him. Or touch him. No. She had to endure the torture of sitting on one side of the gigantic hall, while the boy who she couldn't stop thinking about was all the way on the other side. Completely out of reach. Which was why she had taken the first opportunity – she had been working on an essay with Hermione and Ron – and told her friends she needed to go look for more books. Of course, she had hoped to find something else in the back corner of the library as well. And she had. And now she was almost dancing back to her friends with a million-watt smile on her face.
She gazed into his eyes searchingly like she was trying to tell whether he was lying. "How do you know?" Haley asked sceptically. Her brows were forming a furrowed line. He wanted to run his fingers over them to smooth the skin. But she seemed so guarded. He doubted she would appreciate the gesture.
him. His knees were pulled close to his chest, arms wrapped around them and his face hidden from the world. He looked so sad and lost that Haley had to swallow back a sob.
"What are you talking about?" Ron asked confusedly. Haley only glared at their hands. Quickly, he pulled his hand away, shaking his head back and forth. "I – It's not what it looks like – Hermione was just–"
He left a trail of lingering kisses from her chin to her ear. It tickled. It filled her chest with a strange ache. Git. How did he just make her irritation dissolve into nothing with nothing but a few ridiculous touches? She felt less angry, already.
"Shall we?" Malfoy asked but he didn't wait for an answer. Instead he turned around and started to walk in the direction he had come from. As soon as he realised she wasn't following him, he turned around, raising one eyebrow expectantly.
So, if he'd been trying to distract Umbridge… it meant Haley needed time. For whatever she was doing inside Umbridge's office
His father wasn't there. That was the first thing he noticed. Usually, he stood somewhere in the back of the platform with his mother, careful to keep away from all the half-bloods and muggles. But there in the back, between two stone columns, clothed in fine black silk robes was only his mother. It was still good to see her, of course. But the absence of his father was painfully obvious nevertheless.
"Tom Riddle?" Haley asked. She couldn't quite place the name, although she felt like she'd heard it somewhere before.
Then something shifted in his eyes and he lifted an eyebrow before lettting his eyes wander all over her from head to toe. For a moment they lingered on her mint green shirt that she had chosen especially because of the way it made her eyes shine. In a gesture of self-consciousness Haley crossed her arms across her chest. To be fair he wasn't staring at her chest like a creep but the gazing still made her uncomfortable. No one had ever just looked at her like that. Like she was someone to look at. Like she was maybe even pretty. She felt her face heat up. And when Malfoy's eyes went up to her face again his pale cheeks were reddening as well. It was strangely sweet.
“Potter requested to give me a massage. It was quite relaxing, working all the tense muscles, I don't know why I didn’t ask it if him before.” Harry glowed under the praise, and sent a small smile in Draco direction from behind his cup.
“He’s never really spoken on the topic, I assume he doesn’t really care for much of anyone in that sense. Though I suppose we may see some changes over our stay. I quite like Astoria, her sister is alright, but Draco isn’t here to court her. Daphne is already spoken for. She’ll be marrying Prince Theodore Nott. You hopefully will never meet him, he’s a strange one.” Luna flipped her fingers through spools of thread that were lined up on one of the tables, matching them to the gold sewn onto Harry’s shirt.
“We have two separate rooms for the kitchen, one is more of a prepping room than a cooking room, and the other room is to cook everything in. It’s to make sure everything is decontaminated before we cook it. You can check out both rooms if you’d like, just make sure to wash your hands in case you touch something.”
“It’s to help control your hunger, you become hungry at a certain time every day, or at least your stomach will be able to withstand the loss of certain meals, due to overtime work. We finish our day at whatever time we are given. My Lady lets me off work at 9PM each day. Yesterday was different, because you were found.” Hermione explained. Harry nods, his mind swimming with new information.
Colin dropped him off at a closed door, which Harry presumed was Luna’s. He nodded a thanks to the boy and knocked on the door. He noticed that her door was in fact in the same hallway as Draco’s room, but on the end closest to the hallway and on the opposite side.
“He was too quiet.” She muttered, looking over her shoulder. She held her hand to Harry's mouth as he tried to speak. She held a finger to her lips. Draco had shuffled in his bed.
“Why are you asking about Luna, Harry?” Hermione asked, leaning forward. He smiled lightly at her. He began to tell them about his meeting with Luna. Hermione’s attitude brightened as she listened to Harry talk about Luna. When he had finished telling them about Luna, Hermione glanced over at Ron.
“Yes, I’m not sure how I’ll be visiting with each of them at the palace but I do know that I’ll be meeting with the three princesses separately. My father chose Pansy as best for me but in the end I suppose I get to decide who I’ll marry, as long as I have the approval of my kingdom.” Draco answered.
“How was your day Harry?” Hermione asked, keeping Harry from leaving, even though he had one foot out of the door. He pulled his foot back in and shut the door gently.
Harry laughed to himself, causing them to look at him. They both blushed as if they realized they’d been arguing in front of Harry. Hermione cleared her throat and nodded for him to continue again.
He walked past the servants’ commons, to the back door of the castle. The grass was overgrown, wild wheat grew among it. There was a path leading down the hill, which forked off into three separate paths. There was a sign in the middle with painted letters, Graveyard, Garden, and Barn. There was a little arrow pointing to the right on Barn, so he took a right and wandered down the path to the barn.
“No, Malfoy just ordered me around. He made me feel like he was a good person, that I could trust him. I was wrong, he tricked me. I was stupid,” Harry muttered. He had personally witnessed Draco beating his two friends unconscious, and afterward he had the audacity to believe Draco was a good person. All because Draco had been nice to him, had smiled, had given him food?
Her explanation about Draco’s ‘duties’ was vague, but Harry had a feeling it had to do with him listening in. He wasn’t invading privacy, Draco had told her to keep the door open, for what reason he didn’t know. Perhaps Draco had guessed what Hermione had come to say and since Harry would be going with, didn’t mind if he listened in. Or if it was the case that he didn’t know what she was going to say, perhaps he simply did not want to be alone in a room with her.
Harry’s thoughts are interrupted by a small noise. Harry held his breath and listened for the noise to come again. He heard it again and recognized it as a breathy whimper. He sat up on his cot and faced Draco’s bed on the other side of his bamboo divider. The whimpers came back full force not even a minute later, louder this time. It sounded like the Prince was crying.
Amongst the group there were white trousers, a nicer dressier pair than the others. There was a pair of blue, and another shade of brown. He’d picked up a couple shirts, mostly blue, and grey, but there was a white one. As he tried them on he realized he liked the long sleeved ones, often not liking the ones with the lace up front v-neck like the ones Draco wore. He liked the grey and blue shirts Draco picked out, but not the blue trousers. He kept the white ones because they looked nice. He didn’t know if he looked good in the white shirt, so he decided to set it aside with the other things he didn’t like.
Harry stared wide-eyed at the girl. His trance on her was broken when he was hauled up on his feet by two of the men from before. He recognized them to be guards now. They lifted him easily onto his feet and threw him at a red-haired boy. He slammed into the boy and they both fell to the ground.
The ride back to the pub around the corner, whose name Draco never learned, is awfully quiet.  He wants to thank Thomas, and explain a few things to him.
Two hours into the party at the pub, Draco’s mobile rings.  Apparently, Harry is at the pub around the corner from their flat and he’s
“Well, I suppose I can’t argue much with my project supervisor,” Draco says rolling his eyes and pushes Harry’s legs away.  Mostly, he just wants to touch Harry’s skin.
“You’ve got hot fudge in the corner of your mouth,” Harry says and wipes it away with the ball of his thumb.  He looks at Draco and smiles before he licks the fudge off his thumb.
For their first assignment to prepare Draco for his Muggle life, Harry accompanies Draco as they go purchase a bed together.  The flat comes furnished, but Draco insists
“Why do you say that?” Harry asks, looking curious.  His eyes squint when he’s trying to read Draco’s face in the dark and then he pushes his glasses up as if that’ll make him see a bit better.  It’s adorable, really, but Draco tries not to think about that right now.
Draco had met Thomas at a French restaurant when he and Harry had gone out with Granger.  Thomas is English but he speaks French perfectly.  When Thomas had first rang him up, Draco had made an excuse, but when he’d called the second time, Draco decided to heck with it.  The only way he can get over Harry is if he continues to date Muggles until it’s time for them to be completed with this project (and for Draco to move on, physically, and emotionally).
.  He’s not going to ask Harry to do it, either.  He hates asking for magic help when he’s not allowed to use it.
Harry Potter is the love of Draco’s life.  This is a fact that Draco struggles with nearly every day.
When they return, Draco emerges out of his bedroom with his new jeans and a black button-down shirt that Harry had said was his favourite.  Sure, Draco pretends that’s what he wears around the house, and Charlie doesn’t need to know otherwise.
Thomas also says he has the perfect friend for Harry.  He offers that they could double date.  Draco agrees.
“Next to you, of course,” Harry says like it’s no big deal at all and stands up to offer his hand to Draco.  Draco takes it and Harry is leading him to the room like they belong together.  They do belong together, Harry just doesn’t know that part.
“I don’t know. The longer you and I live together, the less chance her daughter has with you.  Or her son, even.”
“Probably not.  He’s a bit paranoid, I’d say,” Draco answers and drinks his Muggle scotch.  Harry doesn’t need to know that he’d rather be seeing him than any other man.
“Pretend what?” Draco asks with a scowl but she closes the door, leaving Draco alone in the hallway.
“I don’t think Mrs Weasley likes that you and I live together,” Draco says after they are done with dinner and are sitting in the garden.
“He left about an hour ago,” the waitress says and Draco’s attention is back on Harry; as if his attention could ever actually
“Charlie?” the waitress asks. “Oh that really hot ginger he came in with?” she says and Draco rolls his eyes.  He catches Thomas’s gaze who is looking sceptically at him.  The ex-boyfriend is nowhere in sight.
“I’ll need to get a taxi…” Draco is wondering if he’s got enough Muggle cash for a taxi.  It shouldn’t be a problem but he’s always too nervous about things like these.
“Call me if you ever get over him.”  Draco doesn’t even argue back.  What is he supposed to say? “Or if you ever feel like getting away from him,” Thomas adds.
He trudges his way to the sitting room where Harry is sprawled on the sofa with a book.  Brilliant.  Now he’s going to see Draco in his dressing gown.
Draco’s eyes widen and he’s giving Harry a once over.  He’s looking for signs that Harry had just been in and out of his clothes.  “What?” he finally manages to muster.
“Sure, Harry,” Draco blurts out before he’s helped Harry lay in his bed and removed his trousers.  “I’ll be right back.”
“You got a death wish I don’t know about?” Ron’s voice cracked, and he cleared his throat. Harry shrugged.
“I’m sorry.” Harry muttered. She reached over and patted his knee. The touch brought back memories of his own. Memories of his mother.
“Usually she likes to go through all the little shops in the village. I believe she made friends with a couple of the shop-keeps. Did you happen to bring any money with you that you’ve earned in your time working for my family?” Draco asked him with a side glance. Harry flushed; he’d completely forgotten to bring any money. Not that he has much, or has made anything substantial.
Anywhere was better than home though. He would deal with Draco’s shit one hundred times over, and it would still be better than watching his mother die in front of him. He opened the back door to the castle and walked into the servant's room and sat down at one of the common room’s tables.
“Let’s go Luna, we have to make sure I look presentable for the ball tonight. Can’t have the Prince’s servant look too unsightly. Lest the Princesses decide they wouldn’t marry him. Though, who would?” Harry hoped his jab would hurt. He didn’t stick around to watch Draco’s reaction, he grabbed his bag from his bedside and walked out of the room. Luna didn’t say a word as Harry willed his tears to force their way back into their ducts. He would not cry here, for that reason. He wouldn’t let Draco win.
“Buying sweets for someone special perhaps?” She asked, and he chuckled. She put the individually wrapped candies in a small pouch and handed him his coin pouch back.
“I’m not that great at fashion sense, I mean look at me. I just pick out clothes I think would make Draco look good. If you think he looks good then I suppose I did a good job,” Harry answered, not looking at Draco. “I don’t mind the work of being a servant, so far the hardest thing is polishing armor and learning how to deal with the etiquette of dinnertime.”
Harry stared at Hedwig, “So um, I’ll just have you know that I’ve never ridden a horse before.” He heard Draco snicker,
“As for your judgement Potter,” She started, and Harry opened his eyes to look at her again. “You’re now assigned as the personal manservant for my son, Prince Draco Malfoy.”
When they walked into the Throne Room, Ron levitated the plates into their respective spots. There were four spots at the table, rather than the usual three, but Ron said nothing of it. Harry watched in amazement as Ron brought in the silverware using his magic. When Ron was finished he returned to Harry’s side by the door, awaiting the arrival of the Malfoy's.
“Stop! Okay I get it. Everyone has a story. I have a story.” Harry shouted and cut her off. He took a step away from her and rose his hands up in frustration. Luna just looked at him. He sighed and crouched down. He ran his hands through his hair, and over his face. He did not want to talk about it.
Hermione must have been the girl who helped him. Ron was lying on one of the beds, facing the ceiling with his arm thrown over his eyes. Harry went over to one of the three beds and sat down on it. A cloud of dust drifted out of the blanket as he sat down on it. The bed was untouched, as if it hadn’t been used in a long time.
The boots did not move and Harry’s body tensed, his head lowered even further, but the boots still did not move. He glanced up to see Draco raising his eyebrow at him. He raised his head, and backed off the wall, standing at attention to his Master. His eyes did not meet Draco’s. The blonde moved and said,
Luna paid the man, and thanked him. They left the hut, and the wind blew past them. Harry felt like a new person, and he was going to continue to feel better about himself. He thought maybe he should start working out, that way he’d build some muscle and he’d be able to protect his Prince if Draco had been unarmed by someone. Now he needed some new clothes.
“Who is this? He’s new, a servant perhaps. Ill-fitted clothes and messy hair to boot. Oh, Draco darling where on earth did you pick up this stray?” Pansy asked, and pursed her lips in satisfaction as Harry shook with anger. He managed to keep his face from showing emotion. The Prince however, did not hesitate to answer her.
“Who are you? Are you the new servant Ron talked about? Harry Potter?” The boy pestered, he walked over to face Harry. Harry ignored him still, and hauled Ron up onto his bed, and covered him with a blanket.
Harry nodded, and Cedric laughed. Harry looked over at the taller boy, and Draco did as well. When Draco glared at Cedric, the boy turned around and continued on making the dinner for Harry. Draco grunted and walked out of the kitchen. Harry followed suit.
“It wasn’t called that when I lived there. When I was growing up it was Hogsmeade. Where did you live in the kingdom?” She asked. Harry started carving the dirt out from under his fingernails. Nitpicking really.
Draco stiffened, he was silent for so long Harry wondered if the blonde even heard him. Maybe he was just being ignored.
Harry barely held back a chuckle. He wasn’t sure if he was more insulted or impressed with Draco’s dog analogy. Draco smirked at the light noise that slipped out of Harry’s mouth, and smiled at Pansy.
I wanted to post two warnings for this chapter! In the middle of the chapter there is a slight bit of self harm but it doesn't go into detail, but I wanted to add this as a trigger warning so it didn't shock any of you. Another trigger warning I would like to add is near the end of the chapter there is reference to abuse. I have had abuse tagged for awhile on this story but I wanted to give all of you a heads up.
“They are, some people set up shop when important groups come into the village because they could possibly sell more items. It’s a rather smart thing for them to do, since they've already made something off of us,” He answered. Harry wondered how many times Draco made the effort to come out and see Pansy. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know, he didn’t want to be dragged out with him every time.
“I’m Prince Malfoy’s new servant.” Harry sighed. Luna’s interest seemed to peak, and she led him outside to the outer barn area. She had asked him what he thought of Draco, so Harry let her have his opinion. “He’s a piece of work, a selfish prick and annoying bastard. He lied to me, messed with my head. Some king he’s gonna make some day!” Harry shouted. Luna stopped walking and turned to look at Harry. She made sure to make eye contact as she spoke her next few words.
He could’ve used the bruises on Draco against him in the same way Draco had used his sexuality against him, but he didn’t actually want to ruin their budding friendship. Not when he was actually growing to like the prince. He didn’t want to believe that the prince was actually mean, he wanted to believe it was a defense mechanism. Even though he wanted to believe that, he couldn’t hold himself back from snapping back at Draco.
“Harry?” A soft voice called to him, and he looked up at Luna. She rushed over to him, Draco walking away from the scene. “Harry stay with me, Harry!”
“Every wizard is trained in combat. Every mudblood, every half-blood, and I should pose the idea of muggles training in combat but my father may not like the idea too much.” Draco informed him as he walked down the corridor to a room.
It was quiet, peaceful even. The sun was dipping below the horizon, and the bugs were beginning to sing. The air was warm still, and thick. It filled Harry's lungs and coated them with the musky scent of horse manure and freshly cut hay.
“Save the scary stories for another night Lovegood, it’s morning now and I’m quite annoyed with depressing topics. I have a stressful day ahead of me.” Draco sighed. His voice was tired. Luna nodded and began to hum a tune that Harry had never heard. He took this time to ask Draco about his possible suitors.
“I don't know, I've never heard of it but the servants have to care for themselves somehow don't they? They don't have other jobs or anything.” Draco answered, and bit his lip in thought, his brows furrowed. “Why do you ask?”
“You can’t believe that. Do you agree with it?” Harry asked, still flabbergasted. He could not grasp the idea of marriage for power. Perhaps it was one of the things Luna’s father had disagreed with the King about.
The guard bristled; his eyes shifted between the two teens. After a couple seconds he frowned and nodded. The grip on Harry’s arm loosened and the guard used his hand to gently guide Harry down the hall.
“Whoa! What do I do?” Harry shouted and grabbed onto the knob of the saddle. He heard Draco chuckle from up ahead. He flushed in embarrassment, after all he was from a farm village why would he not know how to ride a horse?
Her voice was soft when she answered him, and Harry had an inkling that she was still upset. He wished he could see his parents, especially his mother. Gods how he missed his mother.
There was a rustling in the grass behind them, and he watched as Luna’s eyes smiled. He turned around to see Draco walking towards them. Harry felt his heart quicken, how long had it been?
There were strings of yellow flowers among the grass and wheat. It made the pathway look beautiful. The barn was large, and red, it seemed unfitting for the rest of the castle. There were pastures miles wide, for as far as Harry could see. Several horses were tied up in the round pens, grazing on buckets of wheat.
“You’re really stressed out, so I wondered if maybe you would allow me to massage you. If you’re alright with that. Only if you’re alright with it.” Harry flushed when Draco met his eyes. Draco licked his lips and seemed for a moment to be lost in thought.
“I forgot for a moment,” Harry whispered, his voice wavered with emotion. Draco took a step towards him, and Harry took a step back. “I forgot how heartless you were.”
Harry’s face heated at the inquiry. He wasn’t sure how he'd handle the responsibility of dressing his Prince. He could hardly dress himself most days. He heard a rustling behind the drawing and began to feel awkward, despite not being able to see her.
Harry coughed, and sat up. He watched Luna talk Draco down. She ran her hands through his blonde hair, and down his face, and onto his chest. He couldn’t hear the words they were saying anymore, everything was a blur to him. Draco’s eyes flicked over to Harry’s and they stayed locked, until Luna forced him to look at her again.
Draco smiled at his cousin. “Thank you for teaching him Luna, he needs to change unless you’d like to stay.”
Harry sighed and began sweeping the floor, he created a pile of dust, amazed that so much dirt can accumulate after only one day. Just what went on in this castle? It felt like hours before they finished the first floor. Harry was focused on his work until Hermione start humming, and he turned to look at her when he noticed a boy around his age walking down the hall.
“Malfoy, that’s a lot of money! You can’t do that,” Harry gasped. Draco inhaled, making his chest puff out in arrogance.
He nodded vigorously, and agreed, “Oh yes, I’m so sorry for the confusion. Could you please show me the way to the kitchens? I was asked by the Prince to help get things settled for dinner.” A lie, but the guard needn’t know. “Would you mind showing me the way?”
“Cedric, Cedric Diggory. Head chef, I make all the meals.” Cedric took his hand back. He pointed to the boy cutting up raw meat. “That over there is Seamus Finnigan, my right hand man and-” He pointed to the African-American boy. “Dean Thomas, our dish boy.” Cedric snickered. Dean flipped him off, and continued washing dishes. Draco chuckled, and Dean flipped him off as well.
“Well, Harry Potter, it was lovely to meet you. I hope to see you at the ball tomorrow night, save me a dance.”
Draco shot a hand out in front of Harry, keeping him from touching her. He didn’t want to hurt her, but he didn’t want to test Draco either. Draco’s forearm bumped against his chest as he blocked Harry from continuing. Harry’s skin burned under the touch, and a heat lit up under his skin where he could feel the slight touch from under the fabric of his shirt. He took a step back in order to save himself from the tingling sensation under his skin.
Luna took it as a confirmation that she should leave, and Harry felt stung. He sighed in resignation. Draco moved his hand near Harry’s face. Harry flinched, when the hand came into view. Draco touched his hair, very lightly for only a moment, before realizing and backing away. Harry was scared, his heart was racing. He tried to make eye contact, tried to search Draco’s eyes for a hint of something, anything.
“You don’t have a fever, and you’ll be in pain for a few days, but I healed your ribs. Nothing was broken, just bruised, and you’ll have a headache for a while,” She whispered. Harry blinked and furrowed his brows at her, and leaned away.
“You look sharp Potter. You’ve found some clothes that fit you I hope?” Draco looked at the tents around them. He had his hands on his hips, which stretched the ties of his green shirt and opened the shirt a little. He looked handsome.
Harry stiffened, and glanced at Draco who’s face had an unreadable expression on it. He didn’t look at Harry, and Harry felt like a fool. He didn’t know why he felt the sudden need to explain that he didn’t want Draco to misunderstand what Luna said.
Draco inhaled and a deep flush began at the base of his neck, as he gripped Harry’s hand back for a second and then let go. The offer of comfort had been acknowledged and that was all Harry needed in order to remove his hand and smile in the Prince’s direction. ‘You can do this. It’s alright.’ Harry projected to him in his mind.
A girl appeared in the entrance; two guards stood at her side. She stood tall, graceful, but there was a near scariness to her. Her hair hung in a ponytail to her shoulders, she had her arms crossed, and she was wearing boots rather than heels. She didn’t look like what a typical princess would look like. She was wearing thin tight pants, and a loose-fitting blouse that hung low on her breasts. She was pretty but she wasn’t the most attractive person Harry had laid eyes on.
“Are you okay, Harry?” Luna asked him as soon as they were out of the room. Harry held up a hand and stared her down. He was still on the verge of tears, more out of anger now than hurt. Asking someone if they’re okay when they’re clearly not is a sure-fire way of making them cry.
Harry could’ve sworn a dark flush passed over Draco’s cheeks the moment he said those words, but he couldn’t confirm it, as the blonde whipped around and cleared his throat, walking over to his wardrobe.
Once the words were out of his mouth he froze, to think of Malfoy’s reaction first, after his own. Must’ve been due to their fight earlier.
“Stop following me, and stop asking so many bloody questions! Why not just ask Ron who I am when he wakes up?” Harry shouted. The boy flinched and took a step back, Harry took this as a chance to escape the boy. He ran down the hall to the stairs.
“You boy, come with me.” The Queen ordered. Harry scurried after her, followed by the other worried servants. The Queen grabbed him and tossed him to the floor in the Throne Room. He landed with a grunt. “Stand up.”
, and no she did not.” Harry growled at him. Draco chuckled. Harry was growing more confused by the moment.
Harry didn’t understand, and Luna looked disgruntled. As they followed Draco through the gates Luna began to speak.
“You’ll stay here with Luna while I hunt. Oh and don’t bother trying Potter, she’s not into you, she wouldn’t stoop so low,” Draco snarled. Anger bubbled in his chest as Draco removed the sword from his face and he averted his gaze to glare at the ground. Draco stalked off into the trees without making a single sound.
Harry nodded, but didn’t look at her. It’s true he had gotten too comfortable in his speech to the Prince, he’d forgotten. He felt too at home here, and had forgotten his place. She sighed.
The castle was unusually quiet, as well as outside. Hermione hummed down the hall as Harry finished putting his mop and broom away. Breakfast would soon be served, and his new day with Draco would begin. Hermione walked back towards him sending her mop and broom into the closet with her wand. Oh, how he missed using magic.
“Wow! Would you mind if I borrowed him to give me a massage?” Astoria asked. Harry choked on his water, and started coughing violently. Draco shot him a look.
Harry stood up, panting. He looked around again, before looking her in the eyes. He nodded at her. She crossed her arms across her chest then, and slouched to the side.
Will that change now, that maybe Draco heard him? Will Draco stop suspecting that he had feelings for Luna? He meant to make it clear that he was not interested in her in that way, he prefers her as a friend. Will Draco avoid him now? Will the Prince not allow Harry to change him? Will he-
“Malfoy,” He whispered. The blonde shot straight up in his chair, looking around until his eyes found purchase on Harry’s. “I’ve prepared your bath, come with me.”
“I don’t have all day to listen to you insult me, Potter. Out with it.” Draco was glaring at him, arms crossed.
Draco was hovering over an area with a lot of black clothing. Harry had noticed Draco preferred wearing black and green, and wondered if he should buy some black and green to wear so he wasn’t only wearing grey and white all the time. He walked over to the green section, and found a soft feeling one with laces instead of threaded buttons.
“Well, I’ll attend a royal breakfast, and then I have to go on several dates. I must try to court one of the three Princesses here today, I’ll go out with each of them to figure out which woman would be the best fit to be my Queen. Tonight there will be a ball, so I’ve asked Luna to take you down into the town to buy you proper clothes. This ball is very important, as it should seal the decision I must make. Do you know how to dance, Potter?”
Harry woke up with a groan, the sun had just come up and was shining through the thin windows onto his eyes. He sat up and looked around. His blankets had fallen off the bed, and his back ached. Hermione was already showered and dressed. Ron had just returned from the door across the hall, Harry guessed it was the bathroom. When he was washed, he dressed in spare clothes Ron gave him, and hurried out to meet Hermione.
I am busy in my life right now, but rest assured I am writing. I don't have a set schedule for updates since I don't have a set work schedule. An update on my life though since I disappeared, I'm 22 now, and engaged. I have two different college degrees, I've been writing my own book series outside of fanfiction, and I've been working a lot.
Lucius Malfoy entered first, and Harry shuffled behind Ron a smidge. Ron smirked at him, but said nothing. Lucius sat at the end of the table in his large chair. Harry swallowed as Narcissa sauntered in, her gown flowing steadily behind her. She sat with grace, and gestured with her wand to fill her glass with some sort of red drink, Harry couldn’t tell. Luna came running into the room, galloping and twisting and dancing to her seat, in which she sat down and waved at Harry, who blushed and waved back. Ron stared at him incredulously.
“What was that? It sure caught our Prince’s attention.” Pansy asked him. A smug smirk on her face, she was poised to listen.
Harry was about to inquire what Draco was doing when the door flung open. Luna stood, panting in the doorway, before taking a deep breath and calming herself. She takes a look at the situation, before walking in. She needn’t announce her presence, as Draco called out from behind his wardrobe dress sheeting, “Shoo, Loony.”
“Who in the bloody hell is that?” Harry exclaimed. Hermione looked at him in shock. Ron grabbed Harry by his shirt and threw him away from the door.
They walked together, out to the hay bails and the manure pile, which was hidden in a sort of overhang. Luna grabbed a shovel and started moving muck into the pile. Harry looked up and around at the grassy fields, his eyes landed on an old shed like barn, it wasn’t painted. He wandered down the path until it disappeared into the weeds. He stood at the end of the path and stared down at the old shed. He let out a deep sigh and looked back up at the castle. There was a slight movement in one of the high windows, like curtains fluttering. He scanned his eyes back down the castle, to the large barn, and then to the girl shoveling muck.
Harry took one last look out the window, and the girl had disappeared from where she was, the horse she had been tending to was gone as well. He started walking towards Draco, who turned and led Harry up the stairs.
“You are to leave the kingdom for a few days. King Lucius has arranged for you to visit the Parkinson’s. The Queen thinks perhaps it would do you some good to court Princess Pansy. The Greengrass’ are also visiting the Parkinson’s, so the King should hope you would take the advantage to talk to them as well. You would take Harry with you as he is your servant now. You will also take Lovegood to care for the horses, and to act as a guide for Harry’s while you are taking care of your duties with the Princesses.” Hermione explained.
“No mate, I’m just used to it only being me and ‘Mione. I’m not used to having another bloke around. Before you, it was Myrtle, but as ‘Mione said before, Myrtle committed suicide two weeks after.” Ron sighed. “You hungry?”
“Boy. What is your name?” The woman asked him. His eyes widened in shock as he stared up at the woman, speechless. Was she actually going to give him a chance? “Can you not speak? Or are you just stupid enough to ignore the Queen?”
Harry began to touch gently, following the darkness around to the Prince’s right hip. How had he not noticed this bruise before? It was large and an almost black purple, the edge of the bruise was surrounded by yellow. There was no way Draco hadn’t noticed that Harry had seen the bruise. Draco hadn’t made a sound, and he hadn’t moved. The heat had disappeared from the base of his neck. There was a slight tremble in Draco’s arms.
“Yeah, I got an outfit for the ball. I haven’t gotten any casual clothes though.” Harry answered him, his voice grew quiet. He looked up the hill to where Luna had disappeared, probably to go get her horse. Harry felt a lump in his throat form, he’d wanted alone time with the Prince but he hadn’t meant for her to get hurt.
They were both standing next to their horses. Luna must have tacked them to the tree. How slow was he to arrive? He hopped off Hedwig, and began to grab his stuff off the back of the saddle. Luna grabbed Hedwig’s reins and tied her up to the tree adjacent from Ulysses.
Harry soaked all of this information in, nodded and walked over to stand in front of Draco. He tried to memorize the pattern Draco had begun to tie, but from what he’d noticed, it was in disarray. He began to untie Draco’s shirt, sparks flying through his fingertips every time he touched the Princes skin. Draco’s gaze was fixated on something behind Harry. He began to wind the tie around in a criss-cross-x pattern making sure to tighten with each loop he made around each cloth knob.
Luna sighed and stepped back from her pile, “I overheard Lucius and Narcissa, talking about my father. That’s all.” Harry nodded, and stepped forward to take her into his arms. She stiffened, and then relaxed into his embrace.
His body wouldn’t move, his chest tightened, and his breath hitched as he looked around the room in shock, nobody was helping them. The King had a smirk of satisfaction on his face. Harry whipped his head back towards Hermione. Draco was kicking her in the stomach, and stomping on her head. Draco then turned around and slammed his foot into Ron’s face.
A servant walked up to him, and he turned to look at them. The servant, a large man, placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke.
Several other servants he didn’t know were playing a cards game at another table. A few bedroom doors were shut, like his own, but several were open. There was a heat orb in the corner of the room, and a few floating candles lit the room from above them. He needed warmth, comfort, but he didn’t know where to get any, so he walked into his room and sat down on his bed. He glanced briefly over at Hermione and Ron, they were still asleep. Their clothes were soaked with sweat and they reeked.
He had, without thinking about it really. All the servants were young children much like himself. Perhaps a few younger than him, and a few older, but all in the relative age range. He hadn’t seen a single person as old as his parents were, not even a woman, they were all children.
His mouth hung open, and the air left his lungs and he refused to breathe out of fear that he would scare the beautiful wild animal in front of him. There was another slight rustle of the leaves behind the deer and Harry flicked his eyes up to see Draco. He was standing poised, bow ready, arrow aimed at the deer. In that moment everything seemed to slow, Harry swallowed thickly. Draco’s shoulder blades contracted as he pulled the arrow back against the string. The deer moved out from in front of Harry, and Draco’s eyes locked on his. There was a serene look in his eyes as they flicked back and forth between Harry and the deer.
Harry walked into the room further, finding it just the slightest different than his and Draco’s. Her chest was larger, and she seemed to have an open walk in closet to hang her coats. He folded his hands together and cleared his throat. She jumped a little  and looked up from her journal for a moment.
“Is Luna going to be okay?” Harry asked. He pulled his sack off his back and strapped it to the horn of Hedwig’s saddle. His and Draco’s horses were a good match next to each other, seeing the black and white contrast each other.
So Draco had been having dreams for years. Harry wondered if Draco’s mind had been plagued by some bout of misfortune, or perhaps had witnessed something in another kingdom that appeared to him in his dreams.
Harry turned back to walk into Draco’s room when he saw the girl out the window again. She was riding one of the horses, a black one. It’s mane was long from what Harry saw of it. The girl was wearing blue, and her blonde hair flew freely behind her as the horse galloped through the fields. He watched her go, before walking back into Draco’s room to clean the armor.
Hermione smiled, looking at Harry. “Then you won’t mind Harry and Luna joining you! I’ll tell your mother you’re to leave!” She clapped her hands in glee, and walked out of the room. She turned back for a brief moment and grabbed Harry’s arm.
“I’m sure you’ll get used to it, and I’m sure Hermione will teach you a lot of wonderful things. She’s my favorite, what a lovely girl. Not to be rude to you or anything, but I’m almost bummed she’s not here with you. I understand her duties to your Queen though. Speaking of, actually, I should return to my mother. I hope you enjoy your night. Freshen up both of you, and join us for dinner later.” She brushed her dress to clean it of dust, and began to walk down the hall.
Princess Pansy was in love with Draco? How? That couldn’t be right. “That can’t be right, how does he feel about her?” Harry asked. He could hardly seal his bewilderment. Luna side eyes him, before running her fingers down a scrap of cloth.
Draco had ordered Harry to sit with him rather than with the servants. Harry was not opposed to this, as he didn’t really want to sit with people he didn’t know. Though perhaps the royals were scarier.
“She was a maidservant in my palace, she had a daughter who worked in the palace with us. Her daughter was pregnant with child, and we set them up with a home shortly before the fall of my kingdom. They managed to escape before the tragedy. It’s nice to see her every time I come here with Draco to see Pansy.”
The room fell silent, and his words echoed off the walls. Harry refused to blush in embarrassment, he would not allow the stares of the other royals bother him. He felt the eyes of Luna and Draco on him, but he held eye contact with the Princess. She raised her eyebrow at him and leaned closer, but he couldn’t look away, he had to stand his ground. Intimidation set in, and he felt the hairs in the back of his neck stand. He only broke eye contact when he noticed a movement out of the corner of his eye. It was Astoria, she laid her hand on Pansy’s and shot her a look before smiling at him.
Draco hopped off Ulysses, and walked forward. He bowed to her and she granted him the same respect. She smirked and shifted her weight to one of her hips.
“Cedric is taking longer than usual. I was going to give you the tour after the meal was done, but it's taking longer than expected. The castle is quite large, the meal will be cold by the time we're done.” Draco muttered more to himself than his servant. “Guess I can give you a tour of this area, though you might know it since the servants quarters are right down the hall.”
“Honestly Harry Potter, I’m quite disappointed, I thought you would have at least tried to dress him.” She stepped out from behind the drawing, wearing a yellow dress with ruffles. She tied her long hair back with a tie, and a barrette.
Contrary to the dreary inner walls of the Parkinson’s Castle, the town was very lively filled with joyous music and bright colors. There were women dancing in the streets decorated in bright clothing, jewelry hanging from their wrists and necks.
“No, no! But I wondered, is there something between her and Prince Malfoy?” Harry asked. “She got very defensive over him when I ranted to her earlier.”
Hermione sighed, and removed the blanket from around her. “I’m tired now. Both of you go to bed. Harry I hope you sleep well, we have a lot of training to do tomorrow.” Hermione glared at the boys, before slowly removing herself from Ron’s bed. Ron gently held her hand so that she could steady herself and get into her own bed. He tossed the blanket at her when she was under her sheets.
Harry bowed to her, and looked past her to the King, who sat smugly in his throne. Harry closed his eyes for a moment, and breathed in deeply. His heart was racing. He could feel everyone’s eyes on him as Queen Narcissa continued talking.
Luna smiled at him and whispered, “Magic.” She wiggled her fingers at him and hopped on her own horse. Draco seemed to be having difficulties getting on his horse from his limp, so Harry grabbed a stool for him before Draco could quip at him.
“Hope you last longer than his last one. Draco likes to have fun with his servants,” Dean wiggled his eyebrows at Harry, and he felt heat rise to his cheeks. Draco walked over to Dean and clocked him one, right in the jaw. Dean flew to the ground from the impact. He grunted, and spat out some blood.
Harry smiled, he pulled his bags straps tight over his shoulders and said, “You'll see my outfit tonight.” Draco let out a huff of laughter through his nose. He nodded, and gestured to the road before them.
“No, sir.” Harry felt guilt settle into his system, he hated talking bad on people behind their back, no matter who they were. Draco pointed his sword at Harry’s face. Harry’s eyes widened at the tip.
“What you’re sticking up for him? Didn’t you hear about his last servant? Is that what’s going to happen to me?” Harry raged. Luna’s expression remained calm as she listened to him continue.
“You sure it’s not you who’s got that death wish mate?” Harry chuckled. Ron scowled at him, though it was playful. The ginger reached out and ruffled his hair. Harry swatted his hands away and tried to fix his already messed up hair, but to no avail. He frowned at Ron, who simply just laughed.
I'm not going to say it again, because I feel like a broken record. If you don't know what this story deals with, nor have read the tags, nor the other multiple times I have warned about this story, I can't help you.
“Kitten wait..” She said softly, grabbing her wrist. “I’m going to break your heart.” She warned. Ginny smirked, moving towards her. “I think I can handle it.” She said, leaning close. “Just think, you might not.”
“You make shit eggs.” He said after a bit, finishing up his breakfast. Harry smiled around the brim of his mug.
The other two were happy to see him and gave him a hug each. He stood there awkwardly, not knowing what to do. “How have you been?” Harry asked.
She sat up from where she was bent over the table. "You know how Blaise would talk your head off for hours after we got back from holiday?"
Once he was gone, Hermione turned to Pansy. “For once, I agree with Malfoy. That was completely bizarre.” She said, shaking her head as she watched him disappear into the club. Pansy chuckled. “That is the real Draco Malfoy, Granger.” She said before leading Ginny towards the entrance.  “Or it was until you got here.” She muttered under her breath.
He had spent the most miserable month of his life in this muggle hell, living off the meals and takeaways that Pansy brought him when she visited. His mother had been reduced to tears, he didn’t know his mother could cry, and had been begging help from her sister. The one he had never met. His father had locked himself in his room, going through at least a weeks’ worth of alcohol in a days’ time. He hadn’t talked or seen his father since they had moved here into Muggle hell.
Draco was the first to wake up that morning, because of loud noises downstairs. He detangled himself from Harry, pushing the other's bangs back before getting out of bed and walking down to the common room. The voices and noise got louder as he approached the door. He frowned, opening the portrait and glaring at the large group of girls that were gathered there. "Can I help you?" He demanded coldly.
Harry let go of his knees as he listened to his rant. "Are you serious right now?" He asked, staring at him in shock. "Do you really think that?" He asked. "I am no one special. Just Harry." He said, before looking down at his hands. Only eight short years ago he was telling Hagrid the same thing. "I could give a flying merlin's pants what anyone says."
Harry’s eyes darted to the mark, taking in the puckered and irritated cuts. Draco’s eyes caught where his glance went and he crossed his arms over his chest, hiding his tattoo and mark.
"Someone let it out that Draco couldn't use Magic and everyone is plotting." Dean continued, crossing his arms. Harry's face darkened, his lips turning down in a long frown. "Let them bloody fucking try." He spat.
The trial was hasty as no one wanted to be his defense. He was dragged in like cattle to angry faces not once but three times. Once for interrogation, once to plea for his life and the last time for witnesses to speak on his behalf. Every time he was dragged out, his hands shook and he felt like he wanted to vomit all over the floor. He prepared himself the last time he was brought in to be sentenced to a life in Azkaban. He knew his fate. The judge was about seal his future at Azkaban when someone yelled out for him to wait.
This was not the original ending I had for this. I had it ended after the sorting, but this felt like a better place to stop.
Meeting the Ministry with Pansy was kind of a wild ride. They directed all questions and conversation to Harry without once looking at her. She didn't seemed bothered by it, only gritting her teeth a little. After being asked repeatedly what was being taken and where it was, Harry frowned. "Ask her, she knows where everything is." He said, pointing to Pansy.
That statement shocked her enough to open the door all the way for him. Harry took that as an invitation and walked in only to meet Ginny there.
“What the fuck are you doing?” He frowned, trying to worm out of Harry’s grip. Harry just smirked, placing another piercing back in.
Hermione nodded. “Maybe we have been going about this the wrong way?” She said to Pansy, looking guilty and worried.
Harry was the first one out of the carriage, wearing his Gryffindor robes and looking sharp for once. He turned and helped Draco out of the carriage, who had donned his Slytherin robes proudly. The blond took his hand as he stepped down, his eyes cast to the ground to avoid everyone's looks.
Draco stared at him unsure for a bit before nodding. Harry slowly relaxed under the blond’s fingertips, letting out a long relieved breath. “How did you do that?”
The Great Hall hadn't changed much from where they had left it a few months ago. The tables where there and so was the houses, split into four as usual. Harry frowned, coming to realize that he would have to let Draco go so that he could sit with the Slytherins at their table. He turned to look at Draco who had paused and was going to pull away but Harry frowned, clutching his hand tightly before marching over to the Gryffindor table. Draco stumbled, trying to follow along behind the other in shock and confusion. "Harry…" He hissed, eyes darting to the many shocked faces. "Harry.. I need to go to my table.." He pleaded to him as they got to the Gryffindor table.
“I’ve seen it, Remus would go in for a good night kiss and you would turn it into a cheek kiss. ’Remus, have you seen my potions book?’ ‘Remus can you help me with this calculation?’ ‘Remus, do you want something from the kitchen? I was going to get Prongs something and thought I’d ask?’ And I haven’t even seen you two share a bed in a long time… not to mention, you don’t comfort him after nightmares anymore. I know you’re a heavy sleeper, but Remus has been trying to be quiet about it and I hear him.” He looked away from Sirius. “He crawled into my bed a week ago because he couldn’t sleep. He just wanted someone there.”
“Now, are you going to let them get to you like this? Are you going to let them break you?” He asked him.
There was no one to ask all the questions filling his head. Everyone was dead! THEY WERE DEAD! They were dead and no one could answer his questions!
“Unbelievable isn’t it?” The witch asked, eyeing the paper. “It’s literally just become a rumor mill with no news whatsoever anymore. I read the Quibbler.” She told him. He placed the newspaper on the counter.
No one really paid attention to him, nor did they recognize him so he was able to weave in and out of the shops pretty easy. After getting school shopping for both him and Draco, he stopped by Flourish and Botts again to buy something for Hermione and then he was going to head over to the shop to buy something for Ron. He spent some time going over the books before choosing a few  for Hermione and then picked up a few for Draco to read as well from the fiction section.
’  And with that thought and the mental image of his godfather laughing, he stepped into the fireplace and disappeared.
She shook her head. “Not really anything you can do about it, unless you remove the wall.” She joked.
“Really..” He said, turning to George. He pleaded for the other to know what to do. George took the hint and distracted everyone by spilling his beer all over the table, letting Harry disappear behind him.
“No, I want this. As it is.” Draco interrupted. She nodded, taking the page out of the binder before leading him back. He followed her back, looking to make sure that Pansy was behind him. She gave him a smile as Stephanie got him to sit down in an odd looking chair.
He started off dusting everything, getting rid of all the trash and doing the dirty dishes in the sink that were seriously starting to grow something. Then next he started on the boxes in the spare room. The boxes were heavy without any sort of labels. Some even rattled when he moved them. He just started to stock pile them up in the sitting room, as he started to box up everything else. He really didn’t want to go through anything right now.  Once he had the spare room cleaned up, he called it a day.
Draco cleared his throat sheepishly. "Never mind." With that, he opened the door and finally left the office. There was so much to consider. So much to think about. It really had been an eventful day.
"It all happened so fast and I seriously never thought – I mean I knew you liked him and you even went to the ball with him. But he told me you were – he – at the ball he said you were with someone else and he just seemed kind of down and – we only talked that night. Really nothing more. You have to believe me! I never meant for this to happen! And I know I should have checked with you first. I should have told you – I… I'm really sorry, Haley. You shouldn't have found out like this..."
She didn't answer but she glanced over at him quickly. He was blushing again! Haley chuckled quietly at that. It made him look really cute. She bit her lip shyly. Where had that thought come from? She leaned her knees against her chest and wrapped her arms around them, letting her head rest on top of her arms.
"Watch it, Potter." A very familiar voice sneered, as her books tumbled to the ground. Draco marched past her without the shortest glance back. Haley knelt down to pick up her books and tried to ignore the sinking feeling in her chest. He'd done it on purpose. He'd seen the interview and now he hated her. After everything they'd –
"That's brilliant. How did you find out? Was it before or after I turned your skin green?" He was making fun of her.
And yet, Haley had her arms wrapped around his neck and was pulling him closer. She was lightly tearing at his hair, causing him to make this sound that was something between a whine and a sigh. It made her kiss him back with a fiery passion that had ignited her insides. It was like this wild animal had been sleeping inside her all along and now it had woken up. Like Sleeping Beauty but in a messed up way.
The image was more than a little disconcerting. She'd talked of using the Cruciatus Curse. Surely, she wouldn't… actually use it, would she? If she touched one more hair of his girlfriend he would make her pay.
Haley hit him on the shoulder. "He's not my boyfriend," she hissed, as soon as she'd spotted the Longbottoms who were making their way over to the two siblings.
"What the-? Crookshanks?" Haley chose exactly that moment to step into the picture, glancing back and forth between the boy and the cat on the ground and her two friends in confusion. Hearing someone call his name, Crookshanks looked up, perhaps expecting a treat. He jumped out of Malfoy's lap, sauntered over to Haley and meowed expectantly, while rubbing his body against her leg. It didn't take him long to realize he wasn't going to get a treat and so he sent them all a betrayed glare, before stalking away, with his bottle-brush tail high in the air. Hermione made a mental note to make it up to him later. Perhaps with one of those canary treats he liked so much.
It's a kind of corridor. A long hall with doors all around us. And they all look different. The doors, I mean. There are so many colours: green, bottle green, orange, silver, black, burgundy, yellow, red, gold, periwinkle, sky blue, pink, violet…
Angelina's gaze softened. "Look, as a friend I'd tell you, I understand and we're all going through hard times at some point."
She was sitting at his table again. The nerve of that girl! Well, he wasn't going to let some little girl steal his table. Draco squared his shoulders and took a seat at his favourite table in the library, not bothering with greetings. He certainly wasn't going to make his presence known first. The girl could do that.
you." She squeezed his hands. "It made me feel like such a hypocrite. I didn't know any more… whether I was doing the right thing."
"Look, I shouldn't take it out on you. I'm sorry, it's just–" She stopped, glaring at the two figures in the distance who seemed to be holding hands for some reason.
She felt the urge to hit him playfully but before she could do more than raise her arm, the Slytherin caught her right hand and placed it next to his face on top of her stomach.
while the boy in question read the passages he deemed useful to her. It was no secret that Haley was rubbish at Potions. And although Haley had expected him to tease her about it mercilessly he seemed to keep his jokes to a minimum. Overall it was surprisingly comfortable doing her homework with Malfoy. For one, he was much more patient than Hermione and unlike the Gryffindor he wasn't as adamant that she find the solution on her own like her friend always insisted on. In fact, the whole final paragraph of her essay was an exact transcript of the passage Malfoy had so conveniently summed up for her. Setting down her quill at last, Haley wondered why he was helping her so readily. He wasn't setting her up, was he?
The cornflakes were amazing. The pumpkin juice had never tasted this delicious. She wasn't even bothered by the ignorant first-year who had eaten the last treacle tart. Had the colours always been this vibrant?
Her friend shrugged, looking to the side thoughtfully. "I don't want to ruin it," she admitted quietly. "Our friendship. It's too precious."
"Haley, what's wrong?" Hermione's question pulled her out of her worrying spiral, with brutal force.
"I'm too tired to concentrate anyway," Haley interrupted her. "Thanks. I owe you." She didn't want to lose any more time. Ever since Care for Magical Creatures she felt unsettled. Something was going on between Neville and Malfoy. They were fighting for some reason. Was it because of her? But that was stupid. And it made her incredibly mad because Neville was
"Sorry," Potter – the girl who had walked into him – mumbled absentmindedly. She hadn't noticed it was him yet. She looked at his face then, recognition in her eyes. Draco was too surprised to say anything. He hadn't meant for the Gryffindor to find out that he'd been here.
There was consensual humming, so Luna lead them around to the back of the house, where a garden table stood below a red-white chequered awning. On the table was a jar with clear sparkling water and a few lemon slices at the bottom of it. Next to it there were a couple of coloured glasses with cheerful miniature umbrellas.
"Hm?" Haley reached for the cup again but now there was only air. She glanced down to the table. Oh. Her cup had been to the left not to the right. "Sorry." She took the left cup this time, blindly taking a sip of coffee, eyes focused on the Slytherin table.
"What does that even mean, he's got nothing to say to me? Did he swallow his tongue or what?" She burst out at last.
"Well, I only found out recently," George told them, while he looked for something in the pockets of his pyjama bottoms. "Where is it? You know, I saw you with him that night on the Astronomy tower. When was it? Three weeks ago?"
"Thank you." Haley replied, picking at the seam of her violet dress that stopped shortly above her knees. Inside the transfigured hazelnut, there had also been matching tights, shoes and a silver clasp to hold together her hair. Around her neck, she was wearing her fairy necklace.
Haley glanced down to where Malfoy was kneeling. Literally on his knees, trying to make her believe him. It seemed like the picture of sincerity.
"He wanted to defeat that dark wizard, remember? So, he couldn't give it back." Haley argued sceptically. She still wasn't convinced it even worked like that. It seemed too easy.
"Ah, sorry, sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you," Luna said, appearing endlessly calm. "Just pretend you didn't see me."
"If he took that lord's magic, why didn't he use it? Did he give it back? Or lose it again?" Simon wondered.
Draco wanted to hug her. He wanted to kiss her. More than he usually did. He wanted to pull her close and never let go.
"Should we get back to the castle?" The Hufflepuff asked. Potter nodded and just like that they made their way back over the school grounds without a care for the boy that felt like someone had just pulled the rug out from under him. There was nothing for Draco to do but watch Potter leave. Again. He was sick of always watching. How was this fair? How was he supposed to just stand there and watch as a mere Hufflepuff went and did the exact thing he had been wanting to do for a year? He had told her he liked her. Just like that. He had ask her on a date.
For a second it seems she is going to continue arguing but then she sighs and something in her expression softens.
Ah. Now, I get it. Is this supposed to be some bro-bonding time thing, where he asks me how to get into my sisters – uh I mean –
It had been more than slightly awkward. But at least she had got it over with. And from the looks of it Justin didn't seem to be bitter about it at all. If he was he didn't show it.
What could have caused this? Her nerves? A spell? Then her gaze fell upon the fairy that was soaring above her cup of coffee now, holding her stomach, because she was laughing so much. Her quiet laughter sounded like bells, while bits of fairy dust were raining into her drink. Had it been the fairy dust? Maybe the effects of it could be reversed if she took another sip. She downed the rest of her coffee as if it was pumpkin juice. Her throat felt completely normal. Had it worked?
So the next chapter was supposed to be out on the 28th of February, but this chapter came out a little late. So I'll have it out probably early March if not the last week of February.
A home he had to clean, constantly. Where the hell did all the dirt come from anyway? It’s not as if the royalties track in dirt, they hardly ever even leave the castle. Harry scoffed to the empty hallway as he idly brushed the floor with his broom. So where the hell did it all come from?
Harry began to massage the area right above Draco’s pant-line and stopped when he noticed the boy flinch. It was different from the usual sensitive spot. Not wanting to be nosy, but wanting to make sure he wasn’t hurting the Prince he peered closer and noticed a darkness.
Harry rode beside Luna down the hill to the next stop. He never noticed the motherly aura about her until this trip, she seemed wise beyond her years, for someone so young. She was very quiet, at least with him. She was watchful, as if she was waiting for something to happen. He found she was less joyful here than back at the Malfoy kingdom. So was Draco if he was honest, but Draco only seemed calm when there were no other royals around. Somewhere he didn’t have to hold his head up so high it was up his ass.
“Not yet, no. Actually, Luna, do you know anything about the bruising marks on Draco’s abdomen?” His tone had turned serious. The rustling paused, before starting again.
“I think, I thought I saw Malfoy.” Harry furrowed his brows as he searched the field and masses of people for the brilliant white steed he recognized as Draco’s horse. It could’ve been anyone’s horse, he supposed. He caught a green gleam in the sun and turned around to look at Luna. Ulysses had galloped up behind Luna.
“What are you doing here Luna?” Harry asked, glaring at her. She got really close to face and he backed off from her, leaning towards the wall his bed was perched against.
“Shh, Harry!” Ron hissed. Hermione glared at both of the boys. Harry just stared at them, confused. “You can’t talk like that, not near them. They’ll kill you, you understand that?” Ron hissed at him. Hermione turned to Harry,
As they neared the castle, Luna began to move things around in her bags, telling Harry to do the same. They’ll be taken to their rooms as soon as they enter the castle. They’ll be asked to change and bathe before heading to dinner with the servants, unless of course they allow Harry to accompany his Prince to dinner. Highly unlikely, she’d said. Harry felt an odd weight in his chest, like someone was standing on it. Both blondes were on edge, and he-having never met anyone from the Parkinson Kingdom-didn't understand what was going on. He simply did as he was told.
“I can’t spend money on such frivolous things.” He spoke, and turned away from the window. Harry frowned and followed.
“Ron, his hair is already bad enough as it is.” Hermione sighed. Harry pouted, and glared at the both of them. He smoothed out his hair, only for it to poof back out again. They all started giggling, and walked towards the servants common area to pack. As they walked Harry felt a warmth grow in the pit of his stomach. He looked around at all of the smiling faces of the servants as they worked, with the background of Ron’s teasing and Hermione’s laughter he began to feel like he belonged here in this castle. These people were going to grow with him and help him through his troubles as he would theirs, he would find someone here and settle down, have a simple quiet life, as a servant to the Royal Prince, prat or not. He was happy, he could live here.
Harry was at a loss for words, he’d stopped sweeping and had blatantly stared at the blonde boy. He turned to Hermione who was humming to herself a little further down the hall. She didn’t seem to have seen the boy, but Harry wanted to know who the bloody hell he was.
The next morning, Harry was awake as the sun rose, they bathed, dressed and cleaned. Harry was faster than the day before but nowhere near as fast as Hermione. Harry had made sure the stairs to and from the floors were cleaned well, as Hermione had scolded him on how terribly they had looked yesterday.
A wonderful savory smell flowed out the door and it made Harry’s stomach turn over in its hunger. His mouth watered as he could hear the sizzling of the meats in their pans. He walked into the kitchen, and was assaulted with many more smells, and a warmth he hadn’t known he needed to feel until that moment. The fire in the stone oven was wild, surrounding a case of some sort of food.
“The reason we’re here is because I wanted to teach Harry how to dress you. Harry please go stand in front of Draco, and finish tying his shirt for him. It is wrong for a Prince to do it himself, as prolonged use of his fingers on a rough fabric would wear on his fingertips. A rough and calloused hand will cause other royals to look down upon him for doing a servants work, because it shows he does not have the power to have a servant for his own.”
He looked around at the cozy kitchen, the stone walls were littered with little cubby holes packed full of small herbs and spices. Hanging from strings that were trailed along the ceiling were garlic bulbs and drying peppers. There were cooks and kitchen maids running around in every direction, grabbing spices and a plethora of vegetables.
“They must have told you about me. I’m not as terrible as they say, as long as my slaves behave.” Draco licked his lips and set Harry down. Harry dropped to the floor and gasped for breath, clutching his throat as he coughed. He watched as Draco retreated down towards the large doors. “Follow.”
“I assume you’re well rested, Potter?” Draco tsked. Harry winced, he’d overslept. The memories of the previous night flooded back to him, and he looked away from the Prince's eyes. The Prince was standing with a long night shirt on, and some baggy trousers, and Harry felt flustered to see him wearing such common clothing. The baggy shirt was a scoop neck and the neckline hung just below Draco’s collarbone.
Draco stood over their limp bodies for a moment before turning back to Harry. He chuckled darkly at Harry’s expression, and Harry hated himself for the chills that ran down his spine at the blonde’s laugh.
Harry was appalled, Draco didn’t do anything towards Dean, just laughed at him. Harry’s eyes flicked between the two, wondering if Draco was going to do something. He’d beaten Ron and Hermione just an hour before, for crying when Harry was given to Draco. Draco turned to look at Harry, there was a bit of amusement in his eyes, and Harry realized he knew these boys pretty well.
The inside of the barn was smaller than he originally thought it would be. There were four giant stalls, with horses in them. A chestnut, a black, a brown and a pinto, by the look of them. There was a fifth stall, filled with equipment, and a back room of supplies. Luna had disappeared somewhere, so Harry was walking through the barn.
Harry found all of it interesting. The Prince opening up to him about his family, the fact that he was even talking to him in the first place, and that they were related even if it wasn’t close. Although Harry was sure if he’d asked Luna, she would have told him, even still Draco was opening up to him little by little.
Luna had begun talking about something from her childhood, Harry tried to follow her story but was having a hard time focusing. She mentioned creatures he’d never heard of before, and places he’d never visited, until the word “dementor’ passed her lips. A chill ran up his spine. He remembered the dark ghostly creatures flying through the town roads of his village sucking the life out of people in broad daylight. They came in like a plague with Voldemort’s fledgling wizards and witches, and wrecked havoc on the townspeople before overcoming the kingdom.
“Yes that’s me, hello.” He removed his hand from the excited grip of the other. “Would you happen to know where Luna’s room is?”
Harry dragged them out into and hall towards the servants commons behind the kitchen. A young boy, probably Harry’s age walked up to him.
Harry guided a sleepy Draco out of his chair and into the bathroom. Draco began to get undressed and before his shirt was over his head, Harry had turned around. He cleared his throat and walked to the doorway of the room, awaiting dismissal.
“We tacked them up in the stable at the top of the hill. I was just going to go buy Harry some simple clothes, if you wanted to come with. We’ll wait here if you want to drop your horse off.” Luna shooed him towards the stable. He nodded and trotted off. Harry had the strongest urge to tell Luna to leave, that he wanted to talk to Draco alone, but after this morning he wasn’t sure how well that would go over.
“I see, so I’m just some monster to you then? Wouldn’t want anyone to see me with you, god forbid.” He sneered. Harry moved Hedwig toward Ulysses, and held out a stretched arm.
Draco walked in last, and Harry couldn’t help but notice the way he was walking. He was looking at the floor, and his arms were folded in front of him, rubbing his hands. He sat down at the table across from Luna very slowly, and Harry watched as she tried to involve him in the conversation, but he refused to talk. Eventually Luna gave up, and returned to talking to Narcissa and Lucius, making them laugh at whatever it was that she was saying. Harry wasn’t focused on them, he was staring at the blonde boy, who stared at his full plate of food the entire meal, picking at it tentatively. When it was time for the boys to clean the meal, the Malfoy's and Luna stood up to leave.
“So, what do you do here? You’re too pretty to be a servant,” Harry asked Luna. She looked up at him and laughed. Harry blushed, perhaps he’d been too blunt. She set down the shovel against the side of the overhang. She wiped her hands on a rag.
“I apologize for that, I don't really have any money. I have a few knuts, but not much at all. I’m not sure how to repay you and Luna,” Harry twirled his thumbs. Draco shrugged.
Harry about dropped his broom, as the boy passed through the light shining through the windows. The green light hit the boy’s blonde hair, as the red and yellows and blues passed over his thin frame. He was in a dark suit, walking towards the throne room. The boy turned to look at him, their eyes met, and for a split second Harry found him to be the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. The boy turned his gaze back to the Throne room, as he walked into it.
Harry looked up and Luna, and she smiled at him. He felt weird looking at her, knowing she touched Draco like that. Hermione and Ron had said there was nothing there, and why would Harry care anyway? Luna just didn’t seem like the type to get with a pure blooded prat like the prince. Harry liked Luna, he didn’t want her getting tainted, especially by a boy with sudden violent tendencies.
Draco walked over to his desk and sat down. Harry noticed the chair, it was painted black, with green buttoned velvet on the seats. He watched for a moment as Draco began writing down notes. Sweat began to form in the blonde’s hair, and his foot started moving up and down. Harry looked away, figured Draco knew he was being watched.
When he walked out of the room, he noticed that the afternoon had begun to slip into the evening. Draco was sitting at his desk, hunched over, leaning on his arms. Harry wondered if the boy was asleep, so he quickly cleaned the rest of Draco’s room, which wasn’t hard. Draco kept his room spotless, there was hardly any dust.
Harry quickly ran to the bathroom, and started heating up the water, he lit the coals and watched as the water started to simmer. When he deemed it warm enough, he walked back over to the blonde boy.
Harry’s heart sank into his stomach as he heard the anger and fear in her voice. Ron touched Hermione’s arm gently, and she looked up at him. She smiled sadly, and turned away from the boys. Harry looked at the closed door behind him. His eyes widened as Draco walked out of the room, slamming the doors open. He smirked at Harry, and walked past them down the hall. Harry’s heart seized as Hermione gripped his arm.
“Many of Draco’s friends are quite odd, they’re all a rare breed. That’s what my mother used to say.” She picked up a gold and handed it to him, he stood listening to her talk. “Theo, like I mentioned before, as well as Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. Crabbe and Goyle are very good friends with Draco’s father, the poor things. You didn’t hear that from me, you understand?” She pointed a menacing finger at him and scrunched up her face. She only moved her hand away when he nodded. He didn’t know who he’d tell besides maybe Ron or Hermione, but even they were miles and miles away right now.
Hello! Sorry for the wait on this chapter. Please do not drop everything you're doing to read this update, it will still be here when you finish. The chapter is over 19K, roughly 50 pages long.
Harry decided Hermione sounded right threatening if she wanted to be. Her voice was stern enough that he would have opened the door in an instant, not wanting to anger the woman. Draco yelled from inside something that Harry couldn’t quite hear. Hermione grumbled to herself for a moment, as if contemplating something.
Draco turned and walked out of the woods towards the clearing they had slept in. Luna was awaiting their arrival. All of their gear had been packed onto the horses backs and all that was left were a few cooking utensils.
He watched in amazement as Luna grabbed the giant satchel of Draco’s clothing and stuffed it into the tiny carry on bag attached to the saddle of the horse.
Harry scrambled to his feet, and ran after Draco, not without missing the chuckled “coward” from behind him. His spirits dropped even further. He paused by the door Draco had pushed open, and glanced over to Ron and Hermione.
The dining hall was full of dancers and maids and servants and the cooks bringing out food to surround the grand table. The largest most beautiful chairs were made for the castle owners, who sat in them dressed in their most expensive attire. Draco stiffened, and Harry hovered next to him.  The princesses were sat in the middle of the table. There was a girl there that Harry hadn’t met yet, Astoria sat in the middle of the girls. She looked beautiful, Harry thought Draco and Astoria would make a charming couple. The thought seemed strange to him.
His blood stilled in fear, as he glanced around in a panic as the men came forward to take a hold of him.
“Potter!” Draco shouted. He looked up to see the blonde walking slowly down the hall, there was something different about his walk. Draco's presence was demanding, even from where Harry stood, despite something being off about it. “Follow me, I have your next task for you.”
“That’s not true, everyone has a story. Even if you think it’s un-impressionable, or stupid, or worthless. Everyone has a story to tell, where they’re from, what they’re doing here, where they’re going, and why? What their childhoods were like, what food they ate, what bedtime stories their mom told them. What they were afraid of-”
Oh bloody hell, well that’s just fantastic isn’t it?” He exclaimed. Hermione elbowed him, and he grunted.
Draco chuckled and shook his head. He was holding the previous clothes Harry had tried on. Harry handed the clothes he didn’t like to the woman who put them back and he grabbed the ones he liked before out of his hands.
“You know what I see?” Luna whispered. “I see a young, kind man, someone who’d do anything for anyone. You’re a hero Harry, you just don’t know it yet. You’ll grow into yourself, you were starved, and alone. You’re not alone anymore Harry, you’ve got a family again. There’s someone out there for everyone, you’ll find that person someday.” Something in his gut told him, he’d already found that person.
“Armor is more difficult to put on, but since it is a dinner, we shouldn’t need any chainmail. Though I suppose you haven’t seen Draco in chainmail yet, you will when you see him joust or fight battle practice, he quite handsome in it actually.”
“Your magic. I can see it.” As soon as the words left her mouth, the world seemed to mute. He couldn’t hear anything but the ringing in his ears.
The Prince had wide eyes, and Harry wrapped his arms around himself to hide his figure. “Sorry.” Harry apologized, looking at the floor. Draco cleared his throat, causing Harry to look back up at him.
After they’d eaten and climbed back on their horses, they headed for the Parkinson castle. Luna had said they were halfway or a little more than halfway after their playfulness the night before. The sun had yet to rise when the left, so they followed the light of Draco’s dimly lit lantern. Luna had lit the candle with magic, so there was a small bulb of light radiating from a small glass box on Draco’s right stirrup.
“Meet me outside when you’re ready.” Luna pointed at Harry, and then turned around and walked away. Without a word Harry turned back to his work and packed many shirts that looked like the shirt Draco was wearing earlier in the day. Harry paid no mind in what Draco was doing, and only focused on folding his shirts and trousers.
“He killed my parents too. My mum first, and then my dad a few years later. How much suffering he must have been through. I ran as soon as I could, I thought my father was dead. They took the kingdom, I don’t even know where they came from. But one day, after I ran, I bumped into Draco. He was out hunting with his father and they saw me in tears and asked me what had happened. Since I was a princess, Draco and I had been set up on premature dates for possible future scenarios, so they knew me. They took me in, and I’ve been here ever since.” Luna whispers. Her tone was light and airy, and it made Harry feel better about what he had shared with her. Their lives had been ruined by the same horrid man, in very similar ways. “But don’t you see Harry? Our stories aren’t insignificant. They’re a part of our lives. Everyone has a story, Harry.”
“Potter,” Draco spoke. His voice was light, and Harry glanced into his eyes. He froze, a shudder washed over him as he met the stunning grey eyes that bore into his soul, and his breath caught. He watched as Draco’s eyes wandered down his form, and back up again to meet his frozen gaze. “I needed to speak with you, it’s good you’re here. Come pack my clothes while we talk.”
“I especially liked the red one, and the blue and grey ones you picked out.” Harry sighed in satisfaction. Draco nodded.
Put off by the sudden information, Harry wondered for a moment why Draco’s castle didn’t have such beautiful painted tiles, his thoughts were interrupted when he saw a servant down the hall. He didn’t mean to stare but when he saw the girl crying, he stopped and felt in his gut, the need to help her. Draco roughly shook his head, and grabbed Harry’s arm to keep them moving.
In the meanwhile Harry grabbed Draco’s belt and held it out for him to take. When Draco grabbed it from him, he knew he was fine to turn around. Draco had spent quite a while on his hair that morning, making sure it was nicely styled. He smelled of the most expensive perfumes. He grabbed his boots and slipped them on. Harry handed him his knife slip, and his sword sheath to attach to his belt. Harry grabbed the sword from the inner parts of the wardrobe and carefully held it out for Draco to grab.
“Well if we’re going to make his jaw drop, let’s at least go all out. I feel better now, thank you.”
“Clean it up.” Draco ordered again. Harry stood up and began to gather the dishes. He held them out in front and walked over towards the door. His reflexes weren’t fast enough to move out of the way, when Draco’s hand came up from beneath the plates and knocked them on the floor. The plates shattered, and Draco grinned. Harry felt a kind of sadness pool in his stomach. He had hoped, and he was wrong. He had
“You can tell me with the door open, or you can leave,” Draco spoke. Harry’s eyes widened. Hermione looked between Draco and Harry, her eyes lingered on Harry for a second longer before she nodded.
“Ron asked me the same thing. I don’t like her like that. I think she’s really cool and a neat girl but I don’t like her in a romantic way. I think she’s a great friend.” Harry clarified, and met Draco’s gaze when he said it. There looked to be a faint blush on Draco’s cheeks but Harry couldn’t see for certain. It must have been a trick of the light, but Harry wondered if it were a dusted blush on the Prince’s face, what it meant? He decided not to dwell on the feelings rising through his chest at the thought.
She smiled back at him, before waving her wand at the food, levitating it down the hall. Harry ran out after her, and watched as she placed each plate at each setting at the table. They backed away and stood by the doors as the Malfoy's poured in for breakfast. Harry's eyes scanned the room, and landed on Draco's empty chair. He hummed and excused himself from the wall, walking over to the table politely.
“We should go to bed, I'm exhausted. I've had a long day,” Harry yawned, standing up and walking to his bed. He crawled under the sheets, and turned on his side to watch the other two. Ron groaned as Hermione moved away from him, and he fell back onto his mattress.
Harry carefully removed himself from his position atop Draco’s back, and stood up. Draco didn’t move, he just laid shaking on the bed. Harry searches the chest near the bed and brought out a blanket and draped it over the Prince’s revealed skin. He slipped on his shoes, and walked with soundless footsteps towards the door. He cast one last glance at the Prince and left the room.
“Gross, I hope not. The bloody gits got no good qualities. I don’t even understand how his parents love him.” Ron shivered as disgust rolled down his spine. Harry smiled grimly at Ron. He could see where the ginger was coming from, but he wouldn’t go so far as to say those horrible things. “Blimey, and he’s ugly too.” Ron added. Harry stopped short from responding when he realized he disagreed, he thought Draco was bloody beautiful, minus the blonde’s personality.
Draco pursed his lips and uncrossed his arms, looking around the hallway, which was vacant. His eyes trailed the walls and windows. He sighed and looked back at Harry with a thoughtful expression.
“Actually Luna, I agree with Malfoy. I feel as though in this castle with everything unknown it would actually be safer for me to stay with or close to someone who has the power to stop something from happening to me. Not saying I feel safe with him, just that I would feel less safe away from him.” He felt himself heat at the last sentence, when Draco stared at him with wide eyes. Luna gave him an odd look, but nodded.
Draco led him around the common room. The room, he’d never taken time to look at it before, was big. There were several short hallways with two doors on either side, and one bathroom on the end. Each room held three beds, and a desk. It wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t bad either.
Harry walked over to the blonde, and noticed his body was tense. He had the sudden urge to touch the Prince. He wanted to remove the stress, to work out all the knots, to help in some way. Would he remove his shirt? Embarrassed at his own thought he turned away from Draco and walked his stuff over to his own bed. He changed into one of his simple shirts and a pair of trousers, more decent than what he’d been wearing earlier.
“I’m doing swell, love. How are you doing? Is it any easier after the child?” Luna asked, and led them into the shop. She waved for Harry to follow the, in while chatting away.
“I let you win! I cannot possibly win every time, it would be showing off.” Draco boasted, hands on his hips. Luna had her arms crossed.
His head was buzzing, throbbing perhaps, but not in a painful way. His ears were ringing, and sound was muffled. Did Draco hit him in the head? He couldn’t remember, his sides hurt, and he felt light headed when he moved.
“Perhaps Draco is right to want you in a joined room. I shall request to stay in the same hall also, if they’ll let me.” Luna muttered. Her eyes were downcast. Harry reached out to touch her, he felt as though he’d upset her somehow. She moved away from his hand and walked away from them towards a guard down the hall to request a room change.
“Why not transfigure the beds? Or at least make them softer, bigger, warmer?” Harry asked her. Hermione turned to look at her bed.
Harry was shocked at her tone of voice. Harry noted the slight cock of Draco’s head and realized the Prince was also surprised by her sass. Pansy continued,
Harry stared down at the meat, he’d never eaten something as nice as this, it was always, duck or goose, sometimes deer if his father got lucky. Usually they’d eat squirrel. Harry had to blink back tears as he stared down at the wonderful meal before him. He looked up at Cedric and smiled.
Draco opened his mouth in question but stared in fascination as Harry began skinning the animals. His brows furrowed in confusion but he shrugged and returned to skinning his own squirrel. Harry did not watch him, he didn’t need to in order to know that the way they were skinning was different. Harry had learned from his father at a young age how to skin what few animals they had in the area. Meat had been a delicacy for him so he treated the animal’s carcass with care as to not waste a single ounce of meat. Draco’s squirrel was missing some fat tissue and it showed that he had never worried about his next meal. Harry wound twine around the squirrel and tied it to a rod and placed it over the fire.
“Bastard! I bit my tongue!” Dean whined, and stood up from the ground, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. Draco glared at him.
Harry climbed off Ron’s bed and into his own. It was much better than the clay and straw bed of his home, but he missed the smell of his mom’s perfume in the pillows. He wouldn’t be able to smell her perfume anymore.
“Do I mind if you what? Did I hear you correctly, Potter?” Draco asked, absolutely gobsmacked. Harry twiddled his fingers, and played with the hem of his sleeve for a second.
“Oh so you admit that now,” She crossed her arms across her chest and shifted her weight to her other hip. Harry flushed, but held his glare.
He could practically feel Draco staring at him, but when he looked up to check, Draco had already moved farther along on the road. He took this time to watch the prince, thighs wrapped tightly around the girth of his horse, a black steed that made the alabaster pale skin stand out in the growing moonlight. Harry wondered to himself, if he could take a risk. Draco hadn’t said a word to him throughout Luna’s lesson, no quips, no sass, no bullying remarks. He double tapped Hedwig’s sides and was shocked by how she listened to him and picked up pace. He laughed to himself and trotted up to Draco.
“What did you just say to me?” Draco nearly growled, “I could have sworn you just told me what to do.” Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach, and he took a step back. Draco tore the broom from his hands and he scrambled away from the blonde. Draco gripped the bottom end of the broom and smacked Harry with it. Harry yelped in pain and fell to the floor. Draco hit him with it again and again. Harry coughed as the broom handle hit him in the ribs.
Harry felt like he'd been slapped. Draco was right, he'd never said anything to prove he was nice, Harry had just assumed. Harry grew more and more frustrated with himself.
He closed his eyes and breathed out through his nose. The leaves rustled in the wind, passing across his exposed skin. The air smelled sweet, like flowers and honey from the treats the horses ate. He opened his eyes, and with one last glance at the shed, he walked back up the path to Luna.
“How are you darling?” The woman asked, squishing the cheeks of the blonde girl. She seemed so small all of a sudden. Harry was confused but watched the interaction between the two of them, wondering who the woman was.
Harry chuckled and nodded. He and Ron walked out of the kitchen and turned the corner only to run into Hermione and Queen Narcissa. They both stopped and bowed.
“Bloody hell, just look at the difference! There's so much dust on the floor! You must not have cleaned well enough the first time. Might as well clean it again,” Draco grinned. Harry wanted to throttle him, but got back down onto his knees and began scrubbing the floor in different areas.
“Just admit it, you think he’s attractive!” She exclaimed again. Harry blushed, and refused to admit it.
“Close the door.” Hermione told the Prince. Harry felt his heart sink, what was so important that Hermione could know and he couldn’t? I guess it has to do with superiority. Perhaps also that she’s the Queen’s maid and he’s the Prince’s servant. Draco glanced between the two of them and crossed his arms, and Harry tried not to look at how tight Draco’s clothes seemed to fit across his chest and abdomen when his arms were crossed like that. He swallowed thickly, and cleared his throat again, heat rising up his neck.
“What time is it?” He asked her. The castle halls were empty except for a few other servants. The hallways were large, made out of stone, and warm from the sunlight that poured through the gigantic stained glass windows. Birds were chirping outside, and the cool breeze blew, through some of the cracked windows. Harry smiled, everything was silent, and he realized it was the most perfect thing he’d witnessed.
Harry looked with wide eyes between the two of them. They looked rather stunning together in the same light. Astoria was gorgeous, downright beautiful, her hair had flowers braided into it as if they represented a crown. Her hair hung to the middle of her back; the bodice of her dress fit to her tightly. The corset of her dress accented what Harry thought were maybe her already natural growing curves. Her skirt was long and elegant and a gleaming shimmering white. Her dress was white and silver and Harry didn’t have much of a fashion sense but he was sure Hermione would find her dress absolutely lovely.
“You didn't intrude on anything, and explore all you like. My name is Luna, you're welcome to visit this area of the castle anytime you please,” Luna smiled. Harry noticed how polite she was, her voice was high and sweet.
They rode slowly next to each other. Harry had his hands stuffed into his pockets, and Draco kept a hand on the horn of his saddle.
“No,” Draco said, before realizing his mistake. He had responded too quickly. Harry chuckled. “I just meant, it’d be better to talk to you than to discuss goons and goblins for my merry little cousin back there.”
Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement and glanced over at Draco, who was out from behind his wardrobe and was watching them closely. Harry flushed and looked back at Luna.
“I got angry, and got carried away. I didn’t mean to hurt you, I used you as an outlet.” Draco’s cheeks tinted, and Harry’s eyes trailed over the blonde’s pink dusted cheeks, and a warmth settled in his stomach. He willed the heat away and cleared his throat.
He walked up the stairs, making sure not to drop the food. It looked delicious, no breakfast foods he'd ever had before. Draco's door was closed, so Harry jiggled the doorknob, it was open.
Draco nodded. “We should be nearing their castle soon. Are you prepared to act in your best behavior Potter? Some of the maids and servants in the Parkinson’s castle will keep you on your toes. They won’t hesitate to harm you if you let your guard down.” His voice was light, and it sounded like there was a hint of nervousness in it.
He stood back with Hermione and Ron, who’d appeared from his own duties. The King walked in and sat down at the long table, the Queen following right behind him. That’s when Harry noticed the third place setting. He hadn’t even thought about it when Hermione told him to make three place settings. He was about to ask Hermione when the boy walked into the room. His eyes widened and his mouth dropped open slightly.
“It was,” long, insufferable, tiring, “not bad,” Harry responded, surprising himself. He supposed it wasn't, he had met Luna after all. Luna had most certainly brightened his day. “But I'm exhausted.”
"It's a secret," Malfoy whispered, crossing his arms on top of the table and laying his head on them sideways. He sent her a smirk.
"All right." She nodded. "I'll be there." Surely, Draco wouldn't be mad if they met up a bit later. Haley simply couldn't refuse her friend this little favour after seeing her break into tears earlier that week.
"Ah! So this is how you make a heel!" Hermione exclaimed, triumphantly. Haley turned her head to see what had caused her friend to say something so strange. The other girl was sitting by the fireplace with Mrs Weasley who was apparently giving her knitting tips.
"Why is it always me?" She screeched, glaring at Draco who was already on his feet again, seemingly not harmed in any way.
He was right. Christmas was only three weeks away. It was already December. The last weeks had gone by so fast, it seemed like time had begun to pass twice as fast. Still, it wasn't all that surprising with all the school work the fifth years had to do. On top of that there was Quidditch and the secret DA meetings, which hadn't really given Haley much time to pause and revel at how many weeks had passed by. The little time she did have was mostly spent doing homework or going to see Hagrid or spending time with her friends. Malfoy, she had seen only in class, in the Great Hall or occasionally on the school grounds. It hadn't bothered her too much, since she still wasn't sure how she felt about him. But when Luna had slipped her a note from the boy, saying he wanted to meet up it had filled her with nervous excitement and she had agreed to come. Which is how the two of them ended up sitting on the edge of the astronomy tower on a cold winter night.
Draco snorted. What did she take him for? A lovesick fool? He hadn't sunken this low. Yet. Still. It was kind of nice that she had thought of getting him a present at all. He had never had a friend with whom he had exchanged Christmas presents before. Except for Pansy, who was more like a persistent puppy following him around. She didn't really count. So, naturally, he had been unsure what to get her, or whether to get her anything in the first place. Because it would be extremely embarrassing if he gave something to her and she didn't even consider giving him a present in return. So, just in case he had taken a look around the manor and stumbled upon something that looked like he hadn't put too much thought into it but didn't make it seem like he didn't care at all. Good thing, he had remembered to put it into his bag. He reached into the side pocket, fished out a long, brown quill, with white dots and placed it before the Ravenclaw.
She started knitting simple rows at first then experimented with different patterns and after a while she found that Hermione was right. Knitting was fun. And oddly relaxing. And now she finally had an idea what she could give Malfoy for Christmas. She grinned to herself, thinking of his pale hands that were always so cold.
. Why did she keep visiting Malfoy in his dreams but could never bring herself to inquire about his secret?
Draco wanted to stomp his foot. But he still remembered how undignified that had looked when Pansy had done it.
"I never said – are you still going on about that?" He ran a hand through his hair, so he looked like a hedgehog. "I was upset. Because you kept keeping me at arms length."
"He shouldn't have become one of them, then." She didn't know what else to say. Was too scared to look at the boy directly, fearing the expression on his face. What could she say to make it better? How could she bridge the chasm that was separating their two worlds from one another?
For the first time I wonder, if this might actually be wrong. Am I going too far? He can't even defend himself. He doesn't know that he's dreaming or that I'm here. That I'm actually
"And what are you going to do about that?" She asked curiously. It didn't feel different from holding Hermione's hand really.
"I tried… not to think about you but… somehow you were always there. And do you know how annoying it is that you're always getting yourself into trouble?"
"… it simply hasn't been invented yet." I continue her favourite saying. It's a good saying, I think. Words that are filled with hope.
"What?" Emily gaped at her speechlessly. "What's that supposed to mean? You can't… you can't throw the game – You're letting down the whole team. Your own house! How could you – I'll tell everyone – we-we had a deal, did you forget?"
"Huh." How weird. She took a step forward, itching to explore her surroundings. But a hand on her arm stopped her.
She hadn't known it was possible to blush this furiously. Malfoy kept chuckling like this was the funniest thing he had ever seen. Haley glared at him. Did it have something to do with the mirror?
Sirius seemed to notice. "That's right. Those were the only patches big enough to be rescued. She must have kept them and stitched them onto this handkerchief." Her godfather turned to her at last. "Now that you know my story regarding this… I'm really curious how this handkerchief got into
His face instantly paled, which was especially evident because it had been flushed so prettily only seconds before. “Of course I’m a wizard,” he replied. “But that won’t stop me from falling to my death!”
After hearing the seriousness in her voice, Draco's eyes widened a fraction. "W-What is it?" He asked, sounding slightly nervous.
"Haley," Hermione started to say gently. "What do you mean by that? You were there. You've seen it yourself. There was not even a body-"
"Not… necessarily. Serenades are awfully cheesy. And they are so one-sided. I think…" All of a sudden she felt nervous. But why? "I think that music is something that should be shared. Why should I listen to someone sing for me if we could sing together? I think that would be much more… magical." It probably didn't make sense. He probably thought she was nuts.
As she made her way down the long staircase she felt a warm smile settle on her face. Despite him acting as a spy for her godfather, this was nice. It was how it should be. Her friends teasing her before she went out on a date. Sharing the giddiness and distracting her from feeling too nervous. It seemed so easy. She wished she could have the same with Ron and Hermione one day.
When Malfoy didn't show up for Care of Magical Creatures on Wednesday, she began to wonder if something really was wrong. While picking up the worms to feed her bowtruckle, she tried to get close to Pansy Parkinson. Perhaps she knew why Malfoy wasn't coming to classes.
"What are you-?" He questioned with a frown as Haley took a step toward him. She rested her right hand on Malfoy's chest, feeling the quick but steady heartbeat. She closed her eyes for a moment, letting the rhythmical thrum of his heart calm her. Then she opened her eyes, letting them roam over every tiny inch of his face. She raised the knuckles of her left hand to his face and gently brushed them against his cheek, overcome with a sudden feeling of affection. Draco closed his eyes, leaning into her touch. Her throat was tightening up and she couldn't look at him any more. "It's not true," she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. "The words in the letter. None of it. You know that I don't think of you like that, right?"
"It's nothing!" Draco finally burst out. "I drank too much coffee! I need a sleeping draught, that's it."
"I think it's a brilliant curse if it makes sure the bad guys are punished." Simon cut in, mouth filled with chocolate.
His fingers reached for her face and started to caress her skin. "You know the rest." His grey eyes flicked toward the chocolate dragon between them. "It's like a reminder," he continued. "that I don't ever want to hurt you again."
He pulled his hand away, causing the glumbumble to disappear into the trunk again. "It's fine. I already went to see her. She gave me hypericum lotion for it."
. She sighed dramatically. Well, maybe she could do this one little favour for her loyal fans. "Fine. I'll have a look at it." She stretched out her hand.
As it turned out nothing happened. Nothing at all. Malfoy did continue attending classes but he didn't so much as look her way. On the school grounds, in the hallways, during meals he neither glanced, glared or sneered at her. He didn't acknowledge her in any way at all. This of course included playing pranks on her as well.
"Come on, it doesn't bite," Malfoy called, patting the space next to him after he'd sat down on the blanket.
Haley was curious about the reason for this strange meeting as well. As it turned out, Hermione wanted Rita to write an article about everything that happened the night Voldemort returned. And it was supposed to be published in the
They stopped in front of a green patch of grass that was surrounded by tall trees. Around them the red, orange and yellow leafs were dancing, caught in the light autumn breeze that was blowing softly.
He scowled. He didn't like people looking at him like that. But apparently Potter wasn't done taunting him.
"Not yet!" He ran his hand through his long hair in frustration. "That would be much too obvious! Can't you see that he's using you?"
"That was really thoughtful of you." She said with a smile that lit up her face even more. "Thank you, Draco."
Strolling across the castle grounds gave her some sort of peace. Nobody was out there at this hour. In the distance she could see the faint lights coming from Hagrid's hut, gleaming invitingly. She really hoped Umbridge wasn't going to kick him out.
Draco closed his eyes in defeat. There really was no use denying it now. Was it really going to end like this? He felt dizzy all of a sudden. Feverish. He couldn't
"I don't understand," she whimpered in frustration. "My dad–" Her voice shook. "My dad – he – he – I can't believe he–" She didn't finish her sentence. It seemed like she wasn't able to. "Snape was right. My dad – he… he was a bully." She finally whispered, sounding like the words were suffocating her.
"I see," he said, in a carefully neutral tone. Haley really didn't like that tone. It meant he was erecting a wall between them. She was glad there were still things she disliked about him.
What a stupid idea. Strange ideas like this definitely belong to dream worlds. In real life, people don’t have these kind of ideas.
him. Or shower him with kisses. There was a strange pull in her chest that left her feeling slightly feverish and brought a fresh wave of affection with it. All those new feelings were threatening to burst out of her. What was she supposed to do with them? Her heart was beating madly, as if it was trying to remind her that she was alive. She squeezed her eyes shut and lay back on her coat, trying to calm her racing heart. Perhaps she was going to die.
She was done for. What in Merlin's name was she supposed to say to get her friend off her back? She didn't feel like much of a warrior queen
"Not in time." Luna shook her head. "Maybe it's enough to go back to the interview. But not from your perspective. Try hers instead."
"In case her assumptions are wrong, she would jeopardize your friendship by admitting her feelings. So, obviously, she wants to make sure you feel the same first."
Once he was finished with whatever he'd been doing, he carefully walked back over to where she was sitting. 'What are you doing?' Haley wanted to ask but seeing what Malfoy was doing silenced the words in her throat. He was kneeling down in front of her, reminding her of that time in the class room earlier this week. He'd knelt down then, too, picking up her wand for her. What he was doing now, was even more shocking.
Harry was at his side in an instant. "What happened?" He asked as Draco threw his shirt to the side. "It's nothing." He told him as Harry took in the darkening bruise on his ribs and stomach.
“You can handle yourself with or without a wand. Unlike most wizards.” She smiled at him. “I’m proud of you.”
“Why are you coming out of the window like some bad romantic comedy?” He asked, chuckling. “Draco’s parents are home.” She said, laughing at how absurd the whole thing was. Harry laughed with her. “I won’t tell Hermione.”
Draco was wearing a flannel long sleeve shirt over a black tank top and ripped black jeans. He was barefoot with a cigarette hanging between his lips. “Yeah, I’m done with everything basically.” He sat  down next to her, knocking ash off onto the stones before opening his beer.
“There.” He said, letting him go finally. “You didn’t need to do that. I was fine.” Draco protested, making Harry frown. “Do you really want me to acknowledge that with an answer?” He asked.
Also the song inspirations for this chapter was "Too afraid to love you" and "I think I'm falling for Something"  Both by Dylan Garner. The whole album is my go to drarry playlist.
“Why would you like me, Kitten?” She whispered, giving her a rare soft smile. “I’m arrogant, self-centered, and controlling. I’m not a good person.” She admitted. “And as  much as I hate to say it, you could do better.” She reached out, tucking a stray strand behind Ginny’s ear.
have kittens when she found out that Harry was gone. It took Arthur, Bill and George a few hours of arguing that Harry was of age and bloody hell the boy deserved some peace. George went as far as to say that he wouldn’t be surprised if Harry disappeared into the muggle world and never came back after all the bloody crap that had happened.
Ginny raised and eyebrow as Harry looked away sheepishly, scratching at the back of his neck as he shuffled his feet. Oh, she
“I’ll go.” Harry told him, turning and walking off. Draco watched him go, lingering at the door before walking inside. He met his mother, father and Pansy in the kitchen. Pansy was making breakfast for other two, being extremely quiet.
“Apparently.” Draco said with a frown, removing the lid of the top Tupperware and staring at the contents suspiciously. “You’re eating it first.” He told her, taking off the note and following the diagram.
"Awww, well maybe Lunch sometime?" She asked, batting her eyes as her friends giggled. Harry looked at her a bit confused and shook his head. "Sorry, I'm having lunch with Draco."  Draco chuckled with relief upon seeing her disappointment. "Maybe I could see you in between classes?" She told him.
He felt Hermione's worrying eyes on him as he felt panic bubbling up in his chest and he quickly scanned for where Draco had gone. The other was standing a few feet away, talking with Pansy and smoking away. His body felt heavy and he felt paralyzed to do anything about it.
"No, Harry. School is in a week. You have a serpent on your left arm. Harry, your left arm." Draco said, worried. "What are people going to think?"
Draco froze, knowing and recognizing the all too familiar feeling. He knew he had crossed some line. He just didn’t know how to bring himself back to the safe side. It was the same feeling he got whenever his father looked at him, or commented on his behavior or snidely scolded him for the silliest of things. Something that had been ingrained in Potter for years. A set of words that cut deep. Deeper than Draco had imagined.
“I can take you to my tattoo artist.” Draco told him, ignoring the look Pansy was shooting him that said
He found him with Hermione and Ron, laughing and chatting about random things they were going to do when they to Hogwarts and what they had missed about the Castle. Unsurprisingly, Ron had missed the food. Hermione had missed the library and surprisingly the  common room in Gryffindor Tower. Harry didn't really have much to say on the subject, but he was excited to play Quidditch without his life being in peril during the games.
“My mother hates it, but cleaning is beneath her.” He explained to the other, falling back into bed.
She blinked at him, shocked. “Did I just hear you correctly?” She asked him.  He turned to look at her. “I can change my mind.” He told her, the redhead’s words still echoing in his head.  She nodded. “Alright.”
Harry bit his lip, watching him as he struggled. The blond got so frustrated he started to hit the thing, cursing it out loudly. This brought the shop keep over yelling at Draco to stop it.
Pansy was cleaning the house when he got back, laden with bags of food and prepared meals for them that Andromeda had fixed. She had given him instructions and taught him the basics of how to use the stove and microwave.
Harry grinned. “Oy, what kind of greeting is that?” He smirked, throwing Ron’s words from the other day back at him playfully. Ron laughed. “How are you?”
Draco moved, opening the closet and pulling out the boxes he had brought his stuff here in. “Might take a bit.”
"Let's go home." He told him as he walked out to the lobby to pay Chris. Draco followed with a slight frown.
“Remus isn’t going to break nor does he hate you, but pushing him away like this will end up making him.” She told him bluntly.
“Of course, darling.” She said, kissing his forehead and taking the mug. She moved to the other’s room.
"Your unfortunate 'I'm not a poof' speech." She told him with a sigh. Draco groaned, laying his head on Pansy's shoulder in defeat. She rubbed his back. "So, how was it?" She asked with a smirk.
“What are you going to do?” She asked him as he opened the polish carefully. “I’m not entirely sure. I just wished she would stop hovering. She was never like this before, I don’t see why she is now.”
??” She hissed, more at Hermione than Pansy at this point. “I mean I know Harry is a wanker and forgets sometimes and my brother has the attention span of a goldfish, but at least
"Everyone! Everyone says it! Do you think I don't know?! Do you not think I don't see the looks and the hear the whispers?!" He snapped. "And I am the last person that should be here... Asking for help from the saviour of the wizarding world." He felt tears welling up, he took a large shaking breath to try to keep them from falling.
“What do you mean?” She asked. “Well you and Parkinson are getting along  and everyone else seems to be doing fine, but I’m… I’m not…”
“God, you boys are so dense.” Lily said, getting up from her seat, Marlene watching her protectively.
“I can stay.. or you can come with me.. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind.” Pansy stated, staring at herself in the full length mirror in Draco’s room. The blond was laying on his bed, legs hanging off the edge.
Holy fuck that felt good. He gave a scream and started to swing the sledgehammer over and over with abandon. He knew he was screaming things as he reduced the wall to rumble, but he just couldn’t make out what. Sometime during this he had started to sob, switching direction and knocking off the elf statues from the wall. As he went he tripped over the same loose floorboard he had the other night. He collapsed to the ground, a frustrated sobbing mess. He turned his attention to the floorboard. He never remembered that being there. Surely if it had, Tonks would have tripped over it along with many other people. He pulled his glasses off, wiping his eyes and glasses before moving over to it. The board look like it had been wretched up and tried to be replaced in a hurry.
“ARE YOU BLOODY FUCKING INSANE??!” Ron roared at Harry, staring at the other as if he had gone insane.
Ginny ignored both of them in favor of Pansy. “He’s been really distance. Andromeda is worried about him. He’s been drinking a lot and sometimes it’s like he doesn’t even realize where he is.” She explained to Pansy, who nodded.
“Looks can be deceiving.” She told him with a smile. “Also you can’t compare yourself to someone else. It takes time to be okay…”
“Why was Harry Potter yelling in our garden yesterday?” She asked him. Draco paused in pouring the coffee. “He helped me get back into Hogwarts so that I could go back with Pansy.”
Also this is really making me feel old, trying to remember how fashion and pop culture were back in '98. I was like a preteen then.
He took a few deep breaths, trying to calm his rapid breathing. One hand gripped his sheets as his othe hand gripped the wand underneath his pillow. He pulled it out, brandishing it with a shaking hand. “Lumos!” The light filled the room, and he made a sweep over all the shadows. When he was sure that he was alone, he slowly started to calm now slightly. “Nox.” He whispered, sitting his wand in front of him before rubbing his eyes.
"Not even going to fight back?" The guy growled, slinging another spell at the blond that had Draco curling up. "You shouldn't have come back Malfoy." He hissed before walking away, muttering about how he wasn't worth it.
"Soft. Just uncharacteristically soft." He pulled his head up. "Like he was trying to be gentle with me. His lips barely touched mine."
“Sorry we are late, we had to make an emergency stop at Harry’s. He doesn’t live that far from here.” Ginny told her, gaining Draco’s attention. “What for?” He asked before he could stop himself, making the other two do a double take.
There was another photo that caught his eye. The group were in the corner of the Gryffindor common room. Remus was in curled up against the arm of the sofa, with Sirius’s head in his lap. One hand held a book up reading it as his other hand ran through Sirius’s hair, the dark headed man smiling up at him. Peter was on the floor in front of them, laughing as he drunk what looked like butterbeer. James was next to Remus on the next sofa, Lily leaning around him to make kissy faces at Sirius.
Draco was the first to wake up, a few moments after Andromeda left, and blinked a few times before realizing where he was and who he was with. In all honesty, that had been the best sleep he had gotten in months. He stared at the other, seeing the dark circles that his glasses hid. He weighed a few options in his mind before just closing his eyes. He didn’t know when and how this had happened but he didn’t want to think right now, just take in the smell of rum, grass and body spray.
“He said that did he?” He muttered, looking at the blond. “When did he start to look like that? Mr. Prim and Proper with piercings and tattoos.”
“Like bloody hell you aren’t!” He yelled. “You are going! You don’t need to have your life ruined because of me. Make something of yourself.” He told her, his voice softening a bit at the end. Pansy gave him a soft smile.
She grinned, “Yes and you always seem to forget this for some reason.” She placed her other hand on his knee and he automatically started to paint them.
“No, I don’t. I don’t even like anyone.” Harry said with a shrug. “It’s alright Harry.” Hermione said with a pitying smile, placing her hand on his. He pulled his hand away and placed them both under the table in his lap. He saw Dean and Seamus giving him the same look. “I’m fine.” He told them. It wasn’t that far from the truth. He was fine in that department. His love life was something that wasn’t even on the list of things he worried about. He didn’t really have a good track record to start with. He had liked Cho, and Ginny… And had liked Luna for a while, but that turned into a more of a friend thing. He really didn’t know where he stood on the dating thing. He didn’t think he could be comfortable around another person to even consider dating.
He spent some time with Teddy and Andromeda before heading off to the shop to spend some hours trying to fix his motorbike. He stopped on his way home and grabbed some food and alcohol. It was routine and it felt familiar and safe. The alcohol kept the memories, the thoughts and feelings away. It kept the nightmares and anxiety away. It numbed him to everything that could possibly hurt him. He felt himself treading water, just barely catching wisps of breath occasionally. He wasn’t living, he was just existing from day to day as he tried not to fall apart.
The party went on for another couple of hours but Draco didn’t return. Pansy had gone to check on him a few times, coming back and assuring them that he was fine. Harry resisted the urge to go in and check on him, getting a threatening look from Pansy every time he had eyed the door. He remembered the shocked look that the blond had when he had touched his dark mark. He wasn’t disgusted by the mark. It held no power anymore. There wasn’t any reason to fear it. It was just a mark. Useless now, just like the scar on his forehead.
Sorry it took so long but here is the next chapter!! I hope you guys like it, it's a bit short but I have some action in the next one. The first day back was kind of anti-climatic for the gang.
“And how you got me blind is still a mystery, I can't get you out of my head. Don't care what is written in your history, as long as you're here with me. I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did, as long as you love me.” He sang, a small sad smile coming to his face as he pulled down a novel, running his fingertips over it carefully. He looked at the title and read the excerpt before placing it onto the table.
Harry laughed, finishing up his coffee. “Now that you mention it, she kind of does.” He grinned.  Draco turned to look at him. “You tell her that, I will murder you in the most gruesome muggle way possible.”
"I'm not sure what I am doing? I'm not sure what I am feeling or what I am doing. I just get so overwhelmed when... when he's not there... The way Chris was looking at him..."
Pansy woke slowly, stretching out but not really wanting to get up. She looked up, pushing her hair back from her face. She smiled slightly, looking at the redhead next to her sprawled out on the pillow sound asleep. After lunch and a few movies, Ginny had stayed the night to make sure she was okay. Sleeping fully clothed next to someone was something new to Pansy…and she hadn’t slept that well in months.  She settled back into her blankets, cuddling close to the other.  She heard sounds downstairs but just dismissed it as Draco finally coming home.
“See Harry, everything works out in the end.” She told him, hesitating a bit before hugging him. He hugged her back tightly. “Thanks..”
Harry blinked, staring at him a moment before nodding. “Alright.” He conceded, moving to wash the sticky off the floor now that the liquid was up. Draco washed the bottle out and washed the counter before moving to the fridge. He looked inside, biting his lip.
“I’ll try.” He huffed, but hugged her back. “I’m going to get some sleep.” He told her before letting go. “Alright. I’ll be in my bedroom if you need me.” She gave him a peck on top of his head before getting up and walking out.
Pansy was, fortunately, the person that opened the door when Harry knocked late that night. “Are you crazy?” She asked him, pulling him inside. “His parents just went to bed, come on before they come back down.” She told him, locking up before pulling Harry inside and up the stairs.
“I don’t see you stopping me.” He replied, smirking at him as he started to hang up the blond’s clothing.
“Yeah, I can. I think Ron might have an aneurism when he finds out that his sister isn’t friends with a Slytherin but dating one. “ Harry laughed.
"Draco! Come look at your boy." Chris yelled out, wheeling away to clean up. Draco walked in and chuckled at Harry's strained face. "You look like hell." He smirked. He walked over to the other. "What did you end up getting?"
“Because that’s what they want. They want you broken. Crying. They are out for blood and don’t care how they get it.” He told him. “I know that isn’t going to happen because you are too stubborn and too much of a prat to give in.” He turned Draco’s head to the other side, replacing the piercings in his other ear. “This is the time you can show them that you aren’t like your father. You are strong and you will not bow to them.”
"Harry? Are you okay?" Ginny asked, worried before looking for Draco. The blond looked up and frowned, passing off the cigarette up to Pansy, who held it out from her by the tips of her fingers with a frown.
He had done the singing, the food and the cake. Which was a nice cake. Chocolate with nice but thin frosting. It tasted good, though Pansy, him and Ginny were the only ones who ate any of it. Everyone else just stood there and stared at it as if it would sprout fangs and attack them. Malfoy stayed pretty much to himself, except when he was approached by Chris or Pansy. He seemed kind of lonely. The band was really good and he suppose he should  thank the singer.
“Yeah, well there are some things that I have to tell you. I have your wand but it has to stay in my possession until we get to Hogwarts. You are to abide by the terms of your probation until September 1
The blond sneered at them in perfect Malfoy fashion as he pulled his pack out of his pocket, placing a cigarette between his lips. Harry rolled his eyes as Pansy smirked, crossing her arms and examining her nails. She glanced over at Harry, giving him a small nod.
After a bit, he placed his fork down, giving a hollow chuckle. “They left me.. and I have Potter of all people making my breakfast.. And I thought it couldn’t get worse..” He sighed.
“Potter is heading towards a nervy b and a long extended hols at St. Mungo’s, Draco won’t talk to me and I have a feeling if I left him alone he would be the same as Potter. We can’t ever know what they are going through, so who better to help them get through whatever it is that they can’t get over than each other.” She turned her attention to Draco.
“Yeah, I thought it would be cool, plus there is already a rumor that I have one, and according to who you talk to its either on my  chest or my arse.” He grinned at the blond. Draco laughed. “That’s actually funny.” He muttered.
Harry looked at her in shock along with Draco. He moved closer to the blond, placing the bag on the bed. “I got your school books and tomorrow, I’ll see if Pansy can come with me to get your school stuff from your home.” He told him, unpacking the bag. “I also got you a few things at Flourish and Botts. I was there for Hermione and thought that you might like these.” He told him, rambling along nervously.
“I’m not leaving you here.” He said, squeezing his hand. He turned the blond’s hand over, exposing his forearm. He looked over the wound, moving his fingertips of his free hand over the rough edges and the smooth lines of the tattoo. Draco’s breath caught, his eyes locked on Harry’s fingertips. After what felt like an eternity, Draco pulled his arm back hiding his mark against his chest. The movement brought Harry closer, almost into the blond’s lap as he didn’t let go out his hand. Harry stared at him for a moment, licking his bottom lip before pulling away. “I will handle this. I promise this. I wouldn’t leave you here.” He promised him, getting up and moving to the railing. He turned back to him. “Can I burrow a hoodie?” He asked him.
He moved into the kitchen putting down the soup and other things before heading to the sitting room where he could hear the telly.  The sight was enough to bring his panic attack to a dead stop.
“I’m not going to let you lose yourself. You are my best friend. I will not see you self-destruct.” She said sternly.
“Draco.. Are you going to come out soon?” Pansy asked knocking on the door hesitantly. There wasn’t an answer. She bit her lip, moving from the door slightly and going back to her room.
Harry walked out of Andromeda’s fireplace, hearing Teddy’s excited babbling, banging two toys together. He smiled, hurrying over and scooping him up. He cuddled him close to his chest, quieting the child for a moment. Andromeda popped her head into the room after a moment of silence. “Oh, Harry! I was a bit worried. A silent child is never a good sign.” She joked, walking into the room as Teddy clung to Harry.
Andromeda moved, hugging him and Teddy. “Do what you feel. There is no one or anything that you need to concern yourself about but you. Do what your heart is telling you, what you are feeling. You don’t need to decide right now.” She reassured him.
"How is it normal? I'm the saviour of the wizarding world... First in line for return to Hogwarts, Ministry job lined up, talks of Order of Merlin for bloody hell..." He muttered.
Walking into the tattoo shop was a little surreal for Harry. He had seen all the tattoos on Bill, Sirius and Remus but never thought he would be the one getting one. It was even more surreal to be here with Draco in a muggle tattoo shop, looking at home.
The blond burst out laughing, leaning over and holding his stomach as tears came to his eyes. "Merlin, that was a good one. First off, Weasley, make sure you have all your facts straight before you threaten someone." He chuckled.
"A week ago, I think." He ran his fingers over it lovingly.  Ginny smiled at him. "Love it." She dropped his arm before Hermione shook her head. "Can't believe you went through with it."
He froze. “Repeat that, because I must have gone deaf because you couldn’t have possibly said what I think you just said.” He looked at her shocked.
“Go to your little outing.” He told Harry, hanging up the rest of his things before starting on another box.
Harry gave him a smile, flexing his arm. Draco looked down and froze. On Harry's left arm, a silver and green scaled serpent curled around the Sword of Gryffindor. The rubies sparkled along with the name Godric Gryffindor on the blade. The serpent's tongue kissing the blade with its head leaning against the hilt.
Ginny seem to get even more irritated at that. Pansy swore the small redhead was about to combust. “Why does everyone forget about me??! I mean Harry, you,
“Maybe yours is just late.” Pansy rationed, staring at the letter that was laying on the desk as if it was cursed. Draco gave a sharp snort, his eyes dark. “Yeah, right. Pansy, I am on Probation!” He stated clearly, his voice rising in anger. “I can’t do magic or be in magical environments! I don’t even have my bloody WAND!” He yelled, his eyes darting to the letter and back again.
Hermione coughed, looking away from her as she went back to her papers. “Alright, I will go with whatever you have going.” She nodded, finishing off her tea before closing her folder. “Well that solves like everything actually. It’s going to be the  thirty-first, early afternoon.”
Harry reached out hesitantly, placing his palm against Draco’s slowly lacing their fingers together. Draco bit his lip, looking at their hands. “Again, what are you going to do about it?” He asked him, looking up from their hands.
Harry frowned, looking over to where half the bottle had poured out on the floor. “Shit!” He said, moving and righting the bottle. He grabbed a towel and started to mop up the mess.
Finding out his cousin was Potter’s godson was extremely startling to him and she had rushed to make him some tea and offered him a seat on the couch. She had originally asked if he wanted something to eat but he told her about the stove and the breakfast that Potter had made for him and Pansy. She gave him a smile and went to tend to Teddy.
“Other than the stove incident, how is everything at home? You know you can stay here if you need to. I have a small apartment that you could use.” She offered, now that Harry had cleaned pretty much everything out of it. He had either taken it home or it was placed in her attic for safe keeping.
Draco hurried over, looking Harry over before placing his hands on either side of his face. "Hey…" He whispered softly, getting Harry to focus on him. "You will be just fine…" He told him, rubbing soothing circles with his thumbs. Harry stared at him before letting out a shaky breath and wrapped his arms around him tightly. Draco chuckled, running his fingers through Harry's hair gently as he held him back. The blond turned to Hermione and Ginny with a soft smile.
He showered taking his time before standing in front of his closet trying to decide what to wear. He settled on a pair of acid washed jeans and a tshirt before grabbing his swimming trunks.  He was just finishing his coffee in the kitchen when Hermione appeared out of his fireplace.
Stephanie was standing there, popping chewing gum as she looked at a magazine before noticing Draco. She grinned. "Thought you weren't ever gonna come back here." She put the magazine up. "What can I do for you?" She asked as Harry looked over the designs in the binder on the table.
Harry opened his mouth to say something else, before closing it and clenching his jaw tightly shut, shaking his head.
"Okay, the total knobhead makes me want to bash his pretty little face in. Happy?" Harry sighed, rubbing his face. "I think I crossed a line, and I think you are the only one that I could possibly talk to about it without any lectures, or really any bias opinion at all which is really weird." He frowned, looking at her.
She opened the door and froze, raising an eyebrow in surprise. The lamp was dimmed, giving off a soft glow around the room. Harry was snoring away, tangled under blankets. On top of his chest lay a curled up Draco, wearing nothing but a shirt and boxers. One leg thrown over Harry and the other tangled in sheets. One hand had Harry’s shirt in a vise grip as he slept peacefully. Andromeda smiled, closing the door back before going downstairs and making coffee.
Next chapter will be the birthday party. Also another thing, if something or someone seems out of character, it usually has its reason and they will probably explain it as we go along. Those of you who are unfamiliar with my work, every detail has a reason behind it.
Harry looked away from him for a moment, going completely silent. “Because she thinks you’re going mad.” He said, looking up and locking eyes with the other. His stare was intense and made Draco want to take a step back. “So she came to see me; to see what a mad person looks like.” He finished.
His voice sounded amazing to Harry, who stood there just listening to him. It was soothing and soft, but had a strong bite to it that zapped his anxiety away almost immediately.
He gave her a chuckle, helping move the motorbike out into the garden so that they could clean the rest of the garage.
"You know I was almost a Slytherin." Harry said conversationally as he and Draco packed the blond's trunk. The week before school had gone fast without much incident. He did get a lecture from Hermione about the stunt he pulled with Ron. Which he apologized to the redhead for, but Ron was being a twat and Hermione at least agreed with him on that.
She gave him a look. “Draco, you nearly wet yourself when the toaster went off. Your mother really did have a nervy B over how to turn on the stove.”
Draco looked at her, giving her a death glare. “Wonder where she got it from?” He asked her. She busied herself with making her plate.
“Draco, don’t cry. It’s pathetic.” Lucius told him. Draco shook his head, a hollow chuckle coming from him. “Of course Father.”
“Oh no, you are not doing this to me.” He said, shaking his head. “First it was with Chris, now with Potter. I do not fancy Potter. We have been over this.” He muttered. “And he’s looking at me again.” He rolled his eyes, picking at the food in front of him.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked, sifting through his things. When Draco didn't answer him, he looked up. "You were living with me before, this is nothing different.  You've slept in my bed before. Hell, you slept in my bed last night." He said, not understanding what the deal was.
She froze, sitting up straight in a shot. Hermione stared at her, raising an eyebrow. “Pansy?” She asked, a bit worried. “I know what to do.” She said, reaching over and grabbing the first paper she saw, amidst protests from the other.
Harry laughed. "No, the hat really wanted me to be in Slytherin. I asked it to put me in Gryffindor." Harry paused. "Actually it was more along the lines of anything but Slytherin, but still."
“I can handle it.” Harry told him. “Can’t be any worse than what they’ve said about me in the past.”
“My girlfriend is very bossy and controlling.” She smirked. “And Draco wanted to go out.” She told him.
"I'm not going to waste my breath on how much we've changed or that Slytherins aren't that bad. We've just came to an understanding." Pansy told him as Ginny walked in, heading towards them.
He gave him a wide smile. “It looks good.” He said before taking the sleeping baby to his bassinet and laid him down.
"Seriously, you don't have to save me or whatever your crazy Gryffindor hero complex is telling you to do." Draco sighed heavily. "I'm going to drag you down. I was on the train for not even fifteen minutes and it started. People hate me, Harry. And you can't protect me nor can you change their minds."
Draco ignored him as he opened the soup, taking the spoon out of the bag and starting to eat it out of the container. Harry turned around, watching him for a bit. “Dammit Malfoy.” He growled.
Draco started to laugh. “See you?” He asked, appalled at the very thought. “You wish! Did you lose some marbles over the last few months?” He asked, glaring at him. “No one would want to come here voluntarily. No one likes you.”
Draco looked around his room, closing up the last box with the last of his things. He had no idea what to tell his mother. He had no idea what to tell anyone. Was this this the right thing? He sighed, picking up the box and placing it next to the rest at his door. He moved to Pansy’s room, to see if she was doing okay. The other had a little more to pack than himself but it was still a lot less than they were used to.
Hey guys so sorry I haven't updated in like ever. School and work is kicking my ass again and I might be moving again sometime this week or next. It will be 5 mins from campus so I won't have to spend almost 5 hours in a car any more.
Pansy looked him over and sighed. "No, but it still is a serpent on your arm. Some people, er Most people, aren't going to absorb that fact." She looked over the tattoo. "Let me guess, Draco freaked out."
“How and why?” He asked her. “It’s a long story that I probably will not tell you.” Pansy muttered, giving him a smile as Ginny and Hermione reached them.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, he’s here at mine. Safe and sound.” He assured her, smiling down at the other. “Do you want us to come get him?” Ginny asked.
“No, it would look great.” He told her. “I’ll be fine. You go.” He urged her. She looked away from him and looked back to the mirror, checking her makeup.
Pansy was dancing with Ginny, laughing a bit as the other grinned. Neville was still talking with Luna as the other flittered around to the music. Dean and Seamus were grouped near the pool with Ron, talking about the shop and other things. He finally spotted Draco standing at the edge of the pool talking to a tall dark headed guy. The guy was standing really close to Draco, a hand playing with a loose strand of blond that had fallen over the other’s eyes.  Draco chuckled, flipping his hair out of his face before leaning close and whispering something to the other.  Harry frowned, feeling an odd feeling in his stomach as it tightened.
Harry watched him go, confused before turning to the dark haired woman. She shrugged, grabbing her own food before following after the blond.
“Of course.” Draco muttered, rolling his eyes as he turned back to the couch. “Where’s Andromeda?” Harry asked him as he softly swayed with Teddy.
She turned, looking him up and down. “They are at Malfoy’s house.” She leaned against the counter. George straightened up, interested in this turn of events.
“Harry?” He heard Ron ask, shuffling into the room. Harry pretended to still be asleep, his head slightly bent into the pillow so it was easy to do.  When Ron didn’t receive a reply, he sighed and walked over to where Harry’s cot was. Harry felt the bed dip a bit as the other sat down next to his side.
The next one was with all four marauders. Sirius on the far right, school shirt and tie underneath a leather biker jacket. His hair was almost pass his shoulders, one part pushed back behind a pierced ear. He had on fingerless riding gloves and an arm was thrown over Remus, pulling him so close that the top of his head rested under Sirius’s chin. Remus was in his proper uniform, smiling as he wrapped an arm around Sirius’s waist. James was next with an arm around Remus’s shoulders, his school shirt underneath an opened black waistcoat and his tie undone. He had the nerdiest looking black rimmed glasses and was pulling Peter into the photo. His arm draping over the blond as the other smiled. Harry didn’t pay much attention to him. He couldn’t deal with the feeling that went with Wormtail on top of everything else.
"Arse." Draco scoffed after a moment before letting go of his fringe and letting the other go.  Draco rolled his eyes as he moved back to Pansy, who more than happily gave him his cigarette back.
The abrupt screaming cutting through the unnerving silence that he had gotten used to caused him to break. He screamed along with the portrait he slammed his fist into the corner denting the frame. He needed to get out. He knew one place that he wanted to go, been needing to go. Andromeda had sent an owl asking after him, and maybe he could ask her how to remove this blasted thing once and for all.
Harry grinned, pulling out the letter from his pocket, handing it over to the blond. “I told you I would make it right.”
"I know what he did! Just like I know what you did!" He snapped. "This is why Ginny doesn't want to be at home, and Hermione is always at her flat. Stop living in the bloody past!"
He froze. Was he using Harry? He wasn’t. He hadn’t asked him to do anything. He hadn’t asked him to do anything at all. He didn’t answer his father as he mechanically continued to make the mug of coffee.
When he arrived at Andromeda’s, all the lights where off except for one in the sitting room. He walked over to the doorway but stopped short when he heard a soft voice singing. He held his breath, peeking in and seeing Draco holding Teddy close to his chest, rocking him back and forth and singing.
