And the Dark Lord will mark him, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.
"Um.... hello? Am I interrupting something?" At the sight of his son, Remus' anger had turned to concern and confusion. What part of 'Harry missing' involved Harry being in a friend's house sobbing his heart out? Sirius looked up and sighed again.
"So," Draco began. "Harry tells me you're really into motorcycles."
A whoosh of air interrupted his musings as someone on a broomstick landed three feet away. The figure dismounted and walked across to him, revealing wind-swept blonde hair and a nervous grin as they stepped into the light from the living room window. He was wearing a white shirt and black jeans, with a smart-looking jumper over the top for warmth on the broom ride. Clearly Draco was trying to make a good first impression. Harry met him halfway, reaching up to cradle the blonde's cheek.
••• CHANGE IN POV •••
"WHAT?" roared Sirius, jumping up from his seat on the couch. "That pure-blooded, murdering, Death Eater?"
For the love that Lily bore her son, the love that protected him from the Killing Curse, was the same love Remus and Sirius bore him. Lily had loved Remus and Sirius, just as they had loved her. And while Lily might still have had love for her difficult sister, it wasn't the self-sacrificing, unconditional, absolute love that now shielded Harry. Family was what you made it, not what you were born into. Lily had a loving family that had nothing to do with blood, and this was how the magical protection worked.
Not one to deny his needy husband, Remus released Sirius' cock with a pop, gripped his hips and pulled him down the bed towards him. Grabbing lube out of the bedside drawer, he quickly gave himself a few pumps before aligning himself with Sirius' entrance. Remus gently pushed in, giving his husband time to adjust to the size. It was a wonder that after so many years, being with Sirius in this way still felt as good, if not better, than it did the first time.
"Sorry what was that, cub?" Sirius asked exaggeratedly. "You might have to speak up, I think we're going deaf in our old age!"
"Look, Harry." He hissed, "this has gone too far. I know you are hurt. I know you are cross. But you are KILLING your dad right now. If you could see him now, you wouldn't be acting like this. We have no idea where you are, your dad is out of his mind with worry. Please, just come home and give him a chance." He sent it off with a heavy heart. He hated feeling partially responsible for this. If there was one thing they had failed at supplying Harry with, it was a thick skin. The slightest comment could blow him up on a bad day. He sat on the bathroom floor, wondering if his son was every coming back.
Ron frowned at his watch. "Half our time's gone, Harry. They'll be here in half an hour. Plus, even if you can get to the snake, how are you going to kill it?"
"Hello Harry."
"Snape?"
With that, the vault was unlocked and the two of them ushered inside. Sitting at a small table, wearing Anti-Apparition cuffs, frozen in place and cloaked in as many anti-magic spells as could be found, was the Darkest wizard of all time. His eyes flicked up as they walked towards him. Harry thought he looked almost sad. Without his wand, aura of power and supporters, he just looked like a frail, hunched old man with vaguely serpentine features. Then Harry looked at Draco and knew it was time.
Molly Weasley's face changed to an expression of concern and understanding. "Ah. He's upstairs with Harry. Ron's room." Nodding his thanks, Remus turned and began the ascension of the Burrow's thousands of stairs. Though he was not yet an old man, Remus' knees cursed the day stairs were invented. If he had still had that timeturner from school, he mused, he would have gone back and hit the inventor of stairs with a well-placed Full Body-Bind Curse before they could tell anyone about their idea. Shame he'd had to return it after he passed his 12 OWLs.
Harry was numb with shock. His limbs had gone stiff, and he could barely crawl over to the fallen headmaster. He fell across the body, clutching it to him and sobbing great oceans of tears into the corpse' chest. He was still warm, but so different. How could this stiff body have been a living, breathing wizard only hours earlier? How could a man who had be so vital to so many people, suddenly be gone?
For this, Harry sat down in front of the fireplace. He didn't think he could cope with the emotional strain as well as the physical ache of his knees. He rested his forehead in his hands. "Its... its Draco." He spoke into his palms, knowing his dads could hear. "We haven't broken up or anything, he just seems to be really stressed. He's lost weight, he's getting loads more owls from his father, he isn't sleeping."
"I'd like to be a Healer."
"Promise." Harry confirmed, squeezing him tighter. He sighed and let go. "I guess I have to go confront the wolves now."
Draco laughed in her face. "My master? The only one with control over me is hundreds of miles away. I just sent him there."
Sirius looked mildly impressed. "My uncle bought it in July 1955. One of the last ones produced, I reckon. Went to me after he died. Top speed of 125, with a 998-cc engine and a compression rate of 7:3:1."
"Hello Pup," chuckled his dad. "Already up at this time? Shouldn't you be in bed?" He winked.
Just then, a timer went off in the kitchen and Remus left, returning with the night's starter, French onion soup. The meal was one of Harry's favourites, and he eagerly tucked in, as did Draco. Sirius, whose usual fare varied from takeaway to cereal to massive chunks of meat, was slightly more reluctant but he eventually started eating.
Draco seemed to hesitate. ".... just the pureblood stuff?"
Regardless, Harry didn't trust the prophecy as far as he could throw it, and that glass ball had been pretty heavy. He was also confused by Dumbledore's logic on the whole love vs blood thing, but he was glad he hadn't been brought up with the Dursleys. He'd seen them once - Sirius had taken him to Privet Drive after an eight-year-old Harry had expressed curiosity in his mother's family. Petunia was a shrill, unlikable woman as thin as a stick insect, who seemed to have married an ignorant, ugly walrus and then given birth to another one. It had been equal parts disturbing and hilarious to watch the three of them, though Harry wasn't sure he would ever understand how such a small boy could be so very fat.
"We don't know why either," Hermione spoke up, "he just turned up like this about a mile from Ottery St Catchpole. Ron and I found him when we were taking a walk together. We think he was trying to Apparate here but was too upset to do it properly. Either way, he's barely stopped crying since we got him here, which was about an hour ago." Ron just nodded mutely to confirm his girlfriend's tale of events.
Sirius smirked. Then his face changed to a more thoughtful expression, contemplative and oddly out of character for him. "I can't believe we took so long to get together. All the way till Sixth Year?!"
Sirius paused. "Oh. I forgot about that."
"Us!" Yelled a familiar voice, and Harry wheeled round to see his dads walking up the Great Hall towards them. Sirius was bouncing, looking ready for a fight, while Remus was more serious. Ironic but typical. He walked over just as they drew level with the gaggle of student defenders.
Harry nuzzled against his thigh in response, tears drying on his face, wiping his chin with the sleeve of his shirt.
, it was infuriating.
"Please," he begged, trying to push back on them.
," Harry whined with a buck of his hips when Draco pulled his jeans down, the tight restriction finally being gone making him sigh in relief despite still having underwear on.
"Stop being such a tease, whore," he growled, taking a second to appreciate how fucked out his toy already looked.
"You close?" Draco asked, kissing the shell of his ear, nibbling on it slightly.
"You've always been the hero-" Draco yells feeling his pent up anger and frustration brimming inside him.
"I'd rather die again than have to deal with that hag for a whole year!" He yells chucking his books onto his bed. Draco watches as he has started grabbing his spare cloaks, gathering them all up in his arms. Ron holds out a hand to Harry to stop him and says "I'd normally be all for this but-"
As he stops to stare at Pansy's door there is a seed of fear within him. As if even this small act of rebellion could lead to something awful. But his mother's letter seems to burn in his pocket. He takes in a deep breath and grips the doorknob pushing the door open before he has time to let his fear stop him. He is immediately greeted by loud music and the sound of scrambling which he knows must be his friends hiding firewhiskey. It almost makes him want to laugh, nervous and relieved at the same time. When he steps inside he braces himself for anger but he is only greeted by Goyle yelling "DRACO! YOU CAME!" Even though the music isn't nearly loud enough to warrant yelling.
"For now, just stand around and look pretty." She says picking up a cardigan and holding it up to him before grimacing and putting it back. They wander down the aisles and it's odd to see the variety of clothes. "Do muggles actually wear these?" Draco asks and Pansy nods. "All of these are second hand clothes." Draco makes a face "You mean someone else has worn them? Gross." He huffs stepping further away from the rack. "Quit being so prim" She says shaking her head and she throws a shirt at him which makes him yelp and flinch away, tje hanger clattering against the ground. She rolls her eyes and picks it up then shoves it in his arms. "You'd look good in pastels" she says turning back to the rack.
He's unsure of how long he's been there when he hears the sound of footsteps rushing down the hall. Promptly is hands are pushed away and instead a spell is cast to take over for him. He looks up at the small crowd that was gathered around them. Madam Pomfrey casts another spell to carefully levitate her off of he ground.
For a moment Harry doesn't back away and Draco wonders again if he should pull his wand and strike first. His heart is hammering in his chest but finally after what feels like an eternity Harry takes a step back. Draco silently sighs with relief and backs away as well. He doesn't dare turn his back though and instead he watches Harry warily.
He tires quickly after having run so much but he pushes forward as he can still hear them. He hides himself behind a tree taking a moment to gulp lungfuls of air. He's about to run again when he feels something yank him roughly to the side. Without thinking his hand balls into a fist and in very muggle fashion he punches whatever it was that grabbed him. Only after he sees Harry doubled over does he recognize him.
Draco shoves his trunk into his pocket then climbs onto his broom. "Fucking idiot" He hears from the hall as he climbs onto the windowsill. "Alohomora" Says the man and Draco flings himself out of the window, his broom plummeting several feet in his panic. He quickly rights himself and shoots upwards hoping the men won't see him. His heart hammers in his chest as he rises up to the height at which his friends hover.
"They'll think you did it Draco." She says quietly. He silently hesitates but he can feel her pulse thrumming against his fingertips. Just as much as he can't bring himseld to kill anyone letting someone die when he could potentially keep them alive seem just as awful. "Just go." He says to her moving to do chest compression which he has only tried twice both times failing. He hears Pansy run off as he starts even though he's unsure if he's doing it right. She makes no move as he continues and if it weren't for her pulse he would be convinced that she is already dead. She has that same glassy eyed far away look that corpses have. It is eerily familiar to see someone looking straight through him instead of at him but he can't look at her eyes.
He pulls it out for a moment then sets it in front of Pomfrey. "A pepper up potion, I don't think I'll be needing it." He says and she looks at him with a surprised expression that shifts into something softer and more fond, the way his mother would look at him when he was young. "Thank you Draco." She says with a smile. He starts to open his mouth to correct her, there are very few people that he lets call him by his first name, but he stops and looks at her for a moment before simply saying "You're welcome" then turning to head off to class.
"I just want one week of peace." Draco sighs only realizing he'd unintentionally walked back to his dorm once he is stopped in front of the door. "Your dorm is back this way isn't it?" He asks pointing down the hall he begins to walk away when Pansy grabs his collar and pulls him back toward his room.
But he takes the journal, which is more a pamphlet than anything and right on the headline is his name in big bold letter. But instead of the normal accusations or a nearly slanderous piece the headline screams
"I..wouldn't quite call that decorating." Draco says slowly, the lesser of several insults. Harry shrugs and moves away from the wall to look at it. He takes a moment to take it in then he nods.
But as they near the door he spots a house elf hurrying off to a room holding a glass of firewhiskey and it makes him hesitate. He stops mid step and Blaise stops once he realizes Draco is no longer beside him. "We're almost there!" He hisses but Draco shakes his head. "I forgot something" He says then he hurries toward the room in which the house elf disappeared.
"And that one is dandelion root?" He asks unable to help himself pointing at the next syringe. "To stop inflammation, right?" He asks eager to be praised. She smiles slightly "Where did you learn that? We don't tend to cover weeds much less muggle weeds in herbology." And he sits up straighter feeling pride knowing this is something he can brag about without guilt. "I've been studying, I'd like to be an alchemist!" He says expecting her to be impressed but she scrunches her nose at his words.
He rips it up hating how cryptic she is being. It feels as though he is once again a pawn in someone else's game. He has to wonder if it is a threat towards the headmistress. He has never liked her but is he supposed to step in if to stop whatever his mother is planning? He already let Dumbledore die, can he handle letting her die as well.
This he had expected, it is even preferable, as it is better than being cramped together in the existing dorms with so many other students. However, what he didn't expect is the announcement that the seventh years would not be paired together by house. Upon hearing this his body went rigid, knowing that if it came down to anyone else's word against his then he would inevitably lose. And with so many people that hate him, the chances of being paired with someone who will hex him at every opportunity is high.
There is shock and anger throughout the class. However the professor, a young red haired woman seems unphased by his presence. Draco wants to sneer at her, as red hair just seems to have that effect on him at this point but she is grinning cheerily. "You're late, though the halls are ridiculously hard to navigate and it's only the start of term so just take a seat." She says waving him over to an empty seat with an anxious looking kid. "I got lost twice on my way here this morning" She says laughing then she sets an empty nameplate in front of him. She has a strange accent that he's only ever heard once or twice in passing and he can't place it. Though he hasn't traveled much anyways.
"To whom." His mother corrects out of habit but she seems to realize now is not the time for a lesson and sighs. "Pansy Parkinson, she is a lovely girl." She said in a reassuring tone, though it was not reassuring in the slightest.
It is tempting to taunt him or to say something childish but instead he simply moves to pick his books up off the ground without a word. If he had been the one to have a nightmare he'd hex Harry for so much as looking at him funny. He'd expect the same from Harry. He's picked up several already when Harry crouches down down next to him and grabs one of the books. "Sorry" He says quietly and Draco looks over in surprise. As unbelieveable as it may seem it doesn't seem to be a trick because Harry simply places a few of the books back on his shelf. Though he is refusing to look Draco in the eye. In that moment he has a choice, he could be abrasive as he normally is. He could refuse his apology, he could be mean in so very many ways. But he pushes down the urge and says"You have no reason to be sorry." Because that's what he'd like to be said to him. And he places the last book back on the shelf, quickly turning back to his potions. He takes a chance and glances back at Harry and he can see the surprise written on his face.
"You didn't hex him did you?" He asks dropping his voice so it can't be overheard and she shakes her head. "Not even a little threat, are you proud?" She says and he brings up a hand to cover a small smile. "The paper seems to be mostly run by first years, it's not my fault they're impressionable." She says with a shrug stealing a piece of toast from his plate. "Plus I was telling them the truth anyways just framing you as the gryffindor hero jumping into action that you are." She says and he crinkles his nose. "Gross, don't call me that!" And she rolls her eyes and steals his plate of food instead of getting her own.
Immediately after breakfast Draco rushes back to his dorm. He has muggle studies first thing which he has been skipping when possible to avoid Harry. But as soon as he has settled in front of the pepper up potion he'd been working on the door bursts open and he turns startled with wand in hand to see Harry, Ron and Ginny. Harry is fuming and for a moment he wonders if he is somehow the cause. He's tempted to immediately up and leave but as Harry storms in he starts furiously throwing things into his trunk instead of trying to pick a fight.
"That's..innocuous." She says prepping the next vial. Everyone he's told up until this point has praised him for his ambition or encouraged him. But her response is tempid at best. "Is there something wrong with being an alchemist?" He asks feeling slightly defensive.
"Do your parents not want us to marry?" She asks curiously but she doesn't look at him, instead running a hand along the water of the fountain. Draco shakes his head "I don't know, but they expect me to follow suit with anything they say" he says and it comes out harsher than intends but without missing  a beat Pansy asks with sudden interest "But you don't want to?" And her eyes spark with a bit of curiousity.
Harry takes a step closer nearly nose to nose with Draco who refuses to step back. "If you try anything-" He sayss leaving the threat unfinished. Draco stays silent wishing he had a threat he could throw out as well. But instead without his gaze wavering from Harry he says "I understand." Through gritted teeth, as if it is painful to do so.
"What is your purpose on our land?" One of them bellows, his voice low and commanding. Draco scrambles to his feer and he looks around at the group of a dozen centaurs hoping for a sympathetic face among them. But surely they must know who he is.
When Draco walked into the broom shop he was immediately drawn to the newest nimbus. It's sleek and boasts the fastest speed yet but it comes at a steep price. Between all of them they could hardly pay for one for everyone. Eventually he tore himself away and decided to rent a few slightly older models. It pained him to leave without the nimbus and as he passed by the window struggling to hold all five brooms he looked back gloomily. He is so used to getting everything he wants without thinking about it. It feels strange to deny himself of material things.
Though, as soon as he does Harry starts to pull off his cloak and unbutton his shirt and he seems to choke. Harry still hasn't looked at him but Draco's mouth has gone dry and his cheeks heat up. Harry is only in trousers, his wand sticking up from his pocket as he squares up with the dummy and then there is a loud
He is shaken from his thoughts when Crabbe hits his shoulder. "If you keep spacing out you'll miss class." He says and Draco looks around to realize many people have already left. He quickly shovels his food into his mouth and gets up "Thanks" He says past his food and Crabbe laughs. "Does that mean you owe me a potion too?" Crabbe calls and Draco spins around swallowing to say "You can figure out how to make one yourself!" before he hurries to class.
"I may be sinful, but I've obviously been blessed by god." Blaise says gesturing to himself then settling his elbows on the table and his chin in his hands to frame his face. He looks wide eyed in faux innocence at Draco and he nearly laughed, as Blaise is the least innocent of any one of them.
"He hit his head and that's all." Umbridge says sharply. Pomfrey's eyebrows furrow "He is ill, he has all the symptoms." She says clearly annoyed. "I think-: Umbridge starts but Pomfrey cuts her off "If you're not a certified healer then I don't want your opinion." Internally Draco laughs though his face stays still. His eyes flit between them and Umbridge huffs  "I may not be a healer but I am headmistress. I won't tolerate the misuse of school funding" she says her smile growing brighter as if she has just won.
The smaller boy quickly got both his hands on the hem of Draco's jeans, pulling them down, mouthing at him through the boxers before getting rid of those, too. The blonde chuckled above him, loving how eager his boy was.
"Worthless little fucktoy. Look at you," Draco purred pitifully, laughing at the mess beneath him. Without warning, the blonde put in both fingers at once, the sting making Harry both hiss and moan.
"Show me what you want, baby," Draco whispered, running a hand through the brunette's hair, giving a slight tug, the small moan he got in return going straight to his dick.
move," the blonde warned him before leaving the room. Harry followed his orders, squirming on the bed after a few minutes had passed, his cock aching. Draco came back in with a tray that he placed on the bedside table. He was also in a fresh pair of sweatpants, shirt gone. Harry looked over at him, a pleading look on his face as he writhed.
"Fuck," he panted, on the verge of losing it.
"Please,
"P-Please," Harry begged, a sob escaping him because
Harry moved a shaky hand to Draco's zipper, pulling it down, palming his dom through the thin fabric of his boxers. Draco groaned quietly, hand back in Harry's hair, and normally he would've made the boy speed up, quit teasing, but he'd had him on edge all day, playing with him at random times but never letting him come.
"A-All yours, sir," Harry gasped out, a tear rolling down his cheek. Draco moved his fingers just a little, knowing he'd found what he was looking for when Harry shouted out a cry, coming onto his stomach, eyes rolling back as his entire body shook with the intensity of it. Being on edge all day had its perks.
"On your knees, slut," Draco growled, high on the power that was surging through his veins. Harry whimpered at the filthy words, obeying instantly, gaze on the floor and his hands behind his back. He struggled to resist the urge of touching, just reaching out and take Draco then and there, relieve some of the tension that was pent up inside of him.
"Sir," Harry said breathlessly when Draco started kissing along his jaw, eventually moving to suck a few fresh marks into his neck.
Harry's muffled whimpers filled the room as Draco worked on his cock, twisting his wrist and changing his pace at all the right moments, making Harry whine needily.
Draco curled his fingers, looking for that special spot that made Harry see stars, knowing that would be enough to bring him over the edge. He whispered filthy nothings into the boy's ear, nipping and kissing his soft skin, decorating it, making him even prettier.
"Please, what?" Draco growled. Harry whimpered again.
"Let's get you cleaned up, yeah?" Draco said softly, picking Harry up bridal style and walking him into the bathroom, setting him down on the counter before running him a warm bath, going to grab the baggy, comfortable clothes he'd left beside the bed so he could get Harry dressed right after the bath and not have him shivering for too long.
"More, please," Harry whimpered, bucking his hips up into Draco's fist. He didn't know what he needed to push him over the edge, he just knew he needed
Draco fucked him through it, murmuring very bipolar sentences as Harry made pathetic little noises and movements, body jerking. He started whimpering as he slowly became overstimulated, making Draco slowly remove his hands and fingers, wiping them on the bedsheet before getting up. Harry was in a daze on the bed, so far in subspace Draco knew he wouldn't be back for a while.
Harry felt so fucking lucky.
Draco gently sat Harry up so he could take a few sips, dribbling a bit as he did so. The blonde couldn't help but smile at his baby.
"C-Can I?" Harry whispered, looking up at the blonde through thick eyelashes and hooded eyes. Draco let out a low groan at the sight.
"Go ahead, baby. 'S all yours," he said, flattening Harry's wild curls.
Draco's breathing picked up a little when Harry started giving the head of his cock kitten licks, taking it into his mouth and bobbing his head a little. Draco gripped a hand in his hair, pulling Harry's head back so he was looking him in the eyes, a whimper escaping past his lips.
Harry's breath hitched when he felt Draco's fingers breaching his hole, the feeling sending a jolt up his spine.
," he pleaded in a whisper, suddenly shy despite his previous actions. The groan it ripped from Draco made him shiver and he let the blonde guide his mouth back onto him, a tight grip in his hair as Draco hit the back of his throat repeatedly. Harry choked, small sounds escaping him that he didn't even know he was making, the way he was just being used without hesitation making him strain against his own jeans. Draco came with a desperate moan, pushing Harry's face into his pelvis, riding the high of his orgasm, muttering filthy commands that made Harry whine with need. When Draco could see properly again, he pulled the smaller boy off of him, appreciating how messy he looked.
Once they make it out of the forest Harry makes a detour to stop in Hagrid's garden. He straightens and with the wave of his wand and a muttered incantation silvery light spills out of his wand. "I've found him, sorry for the trouble. I'll be around for tea sometime soon." He says and Draco looks at him confused. But this is quickly overshadowed by the shimmering stag that comes out of Harry's wand. It's undeniably beautiful and Draco watches with wonder.
Before he's realized who he's looking for his eyes fall on Harry. He and his friends seem to be crushed between people clamoring to get closer. Everyone wants a moment with the savior. For a moment there is a stab of jealousy in him but he pushes it aside. He'd always hated the story of the boy who lived. His family always had their own telling, though it was likely just as accurate as the glorified one that had been spread around.
He sighs as he closes and locks the bathroom door behind. He looks at himself in the mirror and lifts his lips into a small smile and sure enough the little indents in his cheeks appear. He has to be more careful, especially with Potter around. Whether he knows the meaning behind dimples in pureblood culture or not surely he would use it against him if he has the chance. There can't be a gap between potions in which he can be caught. With his family's name already ruined he has to be the one to fix things. And he can't do that if he has a traitor's mark stamped on his cheeks.
"What? No! I'm not wearing a half finished suit into the party!" He cries wanting to tug out all of the pins in that moment.
"We'll need commoners clothes to fit in. Even royals don't dress to their station when at Potter's." Pansy says trying to yank off another portion of her petticoat but after accidentally jabbing Goyle several times she gives up.
as Harry's fists collide with the dummy, then again. Draco peers over his textbook, which is definitely a mistake. His mouth grows suddenly dry as he stares at Harry.
Draco is broken from his thoughts when he hears Pansy yelp grabbing his arm tightly. His heart is hit with adrenaline and his wand is in his hand before he has even grasped what's happening. But then he sees it, a young witch splayed across the cobblestone floor. Her eyes are glassy and she lay motionless on the ground, her limbs jutting at awkward angles. "Do you think she's dead?" Pansy whispers pulling out her own wand and quickly turning to check the area for an attacker. He wishes he could say no but he can't see her chest moving and she is at the very least unconcious.
He and Pansy wander down the halls unsure where to go with his dorm full of annoying do gooders and her dorm occupied by a hostile witch. However, even the halls seem to be filled with people that openly hate them. During the war at the very least they could delude themselves into thinking that people simply disliked them. But fear and respect aren't the same thing, losing the war has made this abundantly clear.
As if he didn't have enough going on, he's supposed to start smiling? Something he has been banned from doing since birth. As the owl hops out the window and takes flight he reaches up to his cheeks and tries to smile. The dimples aren't there and wouldn't be back until dusk but even this small gesture feels wrong.
Sprawled across the room are papers as well as Harrys whole gang crammed inside. Harry Ron Hermione and Neville are sat on Harry's bed pouring over notes while Ginny and Luna are writing with fervor perched on Draco's bed. When they see him all conversation stops and he sees Ron hide something behind his back. He should say nothing but he gestures to the girls on his bed and turns to Harry angrily. "You have your side of the room, I have mine." He grumbles feeling frustration bubbling up inside him. He wants someone to fight with. Knowing that two of his very limited pool of friends will be leaving makes him feel conflicted. He isn't normally one to feel sad, it's far easier to lash out. But picking a fight with Harry surrounded by so many of his friends couldn't be a worse idea.
Draco's friends aren't the most cunning of strategists, they are charming, witty, handsome, but planning is not their strongest of suits. They're the sort that act first and question their logic after they've landed in trouble. Thus their plan was less of a plan and more of a vague idea. "This is ridiculous! Absolutely not! We would undoubtedly get caught!"
"Okay, then when you cut his face out of every magazine in the slytherin dorms for your
The shopkeeper seems torn for a moment between going to check the noise or helping Draco. After wavering between the door for a moment Draco smiles as if he hadn't heard the noise and says "I think a dark gray would look nice."  And he smiles the shopkeeper looks to the door but decides not to investigate.
What is it that he should want? Does he want to be seen as a deatheater? Does he want to be seen as their enemy? What is he meant to be if the only thing he was told to be is no longer possible? If everything is stripped from him, all of the money, and the politics, who is he truly?
After he feels as though he is safe he makes his way up the stairs towards the owlery. He clutches tight to his letter until the moment he ties it to the owl's leg. He is already yearning to hear her reply and he watches out the window until the owl disappears over the horizon. He stays there a while longer until he hears the voices of other students.
thing for you but it has a very positive spin in your favor. I expect your mum to send me a gift basket." She says with a smirk and Draco can't help but be amused by her. Then something dawns on him.
He keeps his head down as he walks through the halls trying not to feel the eyes that flit toward him. He fiddles with the end of his wand in his pocket, it calms him knowing it's there even if he knows he can't use it. When he reaches the great hall he's surprised to see that the house colors are gone and the four tables have been arranged in a large square in the middle of the room. It takes him a moment of wandering before he spots Crabbe, Blaise, and Pansy huddled together at one of the tables which seems to be occupied almost solely by slytherins.
"But it's so short!" He says surprised. "You're going to be in for a real shock when you see what some of the people at the party will be wearing." She scoffs. "Is it really as great as you've made it seem?" He asks and she smiles "It is without a doubt my second favorite place in the entire world."
He pulls out a box labeled
when Harry looks over at him seeing the apparent disgust on his face he bursts into laughter. It's a jarring sound, though not unpleasant. It's just shocking to hear him laugh so warmly. The most they have ever exchanged is a disgusted scoff. But this sound is so pure and light that it makes him want to laugh too.
"Then take it off!" Pansy huffs and Draco splutters for a moment before Crabbe cuts in. "He could be dying and he wouldn't do that, he's too much of a prude." He says laughing and Draco scowls at him which only makes him laugh more.
"Yeah.." He says awkwardly and he looks at the ground embarrassed. "I'm really sorry." He says shuffling his feet wondering if there's time to turn back. He looks up when Pansy begins to laugh "Merlin, you look like a wounded puppy." She says shaking her head.
The storm begins to pick up as the minutes tick past and Draco picks herbs from his plants to steep them in his cauldron. Eventually the sleeping potion starts to take on a pearly sheen. But just as he is about to add lavender buds there is a loud crack of thunder. Instinctively he flinches away and in that same moment a spell flies over his head. The books burst off of his shelf behind him.
"If you don't mind I'm going to change and go check on my betrothed" He says tersely before turning away from her. He expects her to tell him off or nag him relentlessly but there is only silence from her. Sometimes he is reminded that this may not have been the life she had envisioned fir herself. And this is one of those times. When he reaches the stairs he looks back to see her staring down the hall after Pansy.
The last chapter was edited. If you read it the day it came out please go back and read the ending so this won't be confusing.
Draco paces in front of Pansy's room trying to will himself to turn back. He has never been one to rebel or openly doubt his family. Even during the war he kept any contempt for the dark lord to himself. At the time even his thoughts didn't feel like his own. He wasn't particularly skilled at occulemency but the one thing he was good at was hiding things away. If he felt nothing then the dark lord could take nothing from him. But his father is in azkaban, his future is uncertain, and even after the dark lord has died he still haunts him. At the most unlikely of times fear can grip him and refuse to let go.
"Aren't you full of yourself today?" Said Draco cracking a smile and rolling his eyes as he leans back in his chair.
"I think we'll be able to make it before it's too dark" Goyle says glancing out the window. "We would have time to shrink all of our trunks and rent a few brooms, maybe even find someone with a portkey-" but Pansy shakes her head.
Along the shelves there are rows upon rows of unfamiliar materials. There is a flurry of motion as people grab things but Draco hesitates, taking a little yellow stick that looks closest to a quill, as well as a brush he'd seen his original deskmate with and several tubes of a mystery goo that seems to be a popular choice.
He whips around to see Potter looking dazed and frantic. Without giving him time to cast another spell Draco raises his wand and quickly says "Expelliarmus!" And Harry's wand comes flying in his direction. Harry charges forward but Draco manages to snatch it from the ground.
He swallows his fear, burying it deep down. He has repressed so much that it is easier to be angry than to be afraid. And he is angry completely engulfed in it. But who that anger is directed at? He isn't entirely sure. He has never known a world in which he wasn't preparing for war and the hope that maybe now he is free is just a childish delusion.
Draco sits still for a while feeling awkward as Harry draws him. He's not sure where exactly to look. So he fixes his gaze on the far wall and sits stony faced the same way he would for family portraits. "Do you always scowl?" Harry asks and Draco rolls his eyes.
Draco has decided that he's going to ignore the very existence of Harry Potter. Whenever Harry enters a room then he leaves. When they have classes together his eyes are fixed at the front of the room. Even if keeping himself from watching him play piano in music and duel in defense against the dark arts makes him feel like he is slowly going insane. In his free time he has found himself in the infirmirary. Mary continues to be in a comatose state and as the days go by several other students are hexed as well. Aside from slowing the process madam pomfrey has yet to find a cure.
"DO I GET A SAY IN THIS?" He yells this time, and he does in fact slam his hands on top of his father's desk but neither his mother nor father flinch. They are looking at him silently and it feels as though they have become statues again. These aren't his parents, they wouldn't marry him off to a girl he's never met. He knew he would end up in an arranged marriage, but he is too young to marry, and courting takes time. His stomach does a flip when he sees no remorse from his parents. Their faces are vacant and he is so filled with anger and adrenaline that being met with their stony expressions only fuels him further.
Many of the faces are unfamiliar to him, though they seem shocked to see him nonetheless. He scans the crowd hoping for at least a single friendly face. Even the teacher is unfamiliar to him. However there is one person that he recognizes. As soon as their eyes meet he is tempted to turn and walk back out of the classroom. Because staring back at him, a seemingly inescapable fixture in his life is Harry Potter.
As he reaches the great hall he takes a deep breath already smelling breakfast being cooked by the house elves. It's silent though and the candles floating high above flicker. So as he waits for the rest of hogwarts to wake he buries his nose in an alchemy book and does his best not to think about Harry Potter.
There is a small town in the distance but unsure whether it's muggle or not they have to go by foot to avoid being spotted. So they all stow their brooms in their shrinking trunks and head off. There is a cold wind and Draco shivers left only in partially pinned trousers. They walk for what feels to Draco to be hours before a cloak is dropped over his shoulders. "Thanks" I says staring at the ground but he can see Blaise's shiny shoes walking beside him. "You seemed cold." He replies instead of pointing out that he would need to at least appear dressed to get an inn. "Thanks" He says again though this time it's not for the cloak.
Then without any further warning she raises her wand into the air and an ear splitting screeching rips through the great hall. Students grab their ears trying to shut out the noise and Umbridge takes the momentary quiet as an invitation to speak. "Good morning! I am so happy to be back at Hogwarts, though I am so very sorry that it has had to be under such dire circumstances. I see some familiar faces among you, and I expect you to be on your best behavior. I-"
Draco grinned again and took his own fingers into his mouth, giving them a generous coating of saliva.
After they took off their shirts, Harry began to run his hands over Draco’s chest, then around his waist, pulling Draco flush against him again. The feeling of skin against skin was incredible, soft and smooth and warm. It was perhaps almost as intoxicating as the soulmate perfume’s scent. Draco dragged him over to a bed that the room had provided. Harry lay in the middle surrounded by soft pillows with Draco on top of him. Draco’s mouth left Harry’s and began grazing kisses along his jaw and down his neck.
Well, whatever the case, aggressively making out in the corridor wasn’t much better. Harry had a strong feeling he should get them somewhere private before he lost all coherent thought again.
Harry looked around for the source. It seemed there was only one other person in the corridor, standing right in front of him, just a few metres away. But it couldn’t be. Could it? Draco Malfoy? Harry glanced around again. He was desperate to find any other potential source of the smell. Anyone or anything that hadn’t been his sworn enemy since First Year.
Draco rolled back onto his back, resting his arm over his eyes. “Merlin, you’re hopeless.”
Harry barely finished before Draco cut him off with a shake of his head. “No. Almost there.” His voice was ragged and breathless. Moments later Draco was releasing his own come all over Harry’s crotch. “Fuck, Harry. Fuck.” Harry was almost surprised to hear his first name come from Draco’s mouth, but the word seemed to spill out so easily and somehow it just sounded...right.
Looking Draco up and down, Harry supposed he couldn’t deny that he was rather attractive...well, errr...for a bloke anyway. Beautiful blond hair that almost glowed when the sun hit it, distinct features, smooth soft-looking lips, just asking to be ravaged with kisses… He was beginning to wonder why he hadn’t noticed it before? In fact, upon closer inspection, Draco Malfoy was not only attractive but totally impossibly bloody goddamn fucking sexy.
“How do you forget...nevermind,” Hermione said, shaking her head.
“What?” Ron looked between them all, confused. “What did I say?”
Harry continued on with Hermione, until they turned a corner and almost bumped right into Ginny and Luna, who seemed to have been in some deep conversation.
Harry was about to greet the two, when Luna suddenly held up what looked like a perfume bottle and sprayed both Harry and Hermione, with...something.
Draco nodded slowly, with a seemingly horrified expression plastered across his face.
Harry couldn’t help but give a small smirk at the pink tinge Draco’s cheeks took as the word left his mouth. He decided not to bring up Draco’s previous use of his first name when he’d climaxed. He couldn’t help wondering though, if his name had ever passed Draco’s lips before, during certain solo activities. That was perhaps a question for another time, though. “So, I guess the question is, what are we?”
Draco pressed his tongue against the base of Harry’s cock and slowly slid it up the entire length. “Draco, please,” Harry whispered, pushing his hips toward the other boy, aching for more. Draco smirked at the reaction before taking the head into his mouth, letting his tongue slowly swirl around, just teasing the tip, tasting the pre-cum pooling there.
“Yes! God, yes!”
“Yes,” he hissed. “Please. Don’t stop.”
“I mean…” Draco began. He blushed and hung his head sheepishly. “It’s not necessarily...that surprising?”
Mustering up as much Gryffindor courage as he could, Harry took a few steps toward the other boy. He had to ask. “Umm, did Luna happen to spray you? With some kind of magical soulmate perfume?”
“Hey!”
“Well that’s because you aren’t your own soulmate, of course,” Ginny said grinning, as she draped her arm around Luna’s shoulders. “And I suppose that means Hermione, Luna, and myself also aren’t, given that we have it on too.”
As he looked back at Draco again, there was a strange expression on the other boy’s face, as if he’d just seen a ghost. And Harry was hit with a sudden thought. No. Surely not? It couldn’t be.
“What? What was that?” Harry asked, a little confused. It surely couldn’t be anything harmful, unless his friends had been possessed by some evil-doer. But still, why was she spraying them with anything?
Draco gave him a withering look. “I just gave you a blow job, and you’re surprised that I like you? What? Do you not, then?” The last part seemed rather pointed, there might have even been a flash of hurt across his face.
“Fuck!” Harry’s voice came out as a low growl. He almost bucked his hips up again, but Draco’s hands quickly came to rest on his hips, holding them down before he had the chance to.
He continued on toward the library; Ron and Hermione could catch up whenever they were ready. However, as he rounded a corner, he was hit with the most incredible smell. Thoughts of Luna’s unique perfume flooded his mind. Ginny had said she was trying to spray as many people as possible, right? What if there was someone else around who had also been hit with the perfume, and he was about to come face to face with his soulmate? Was this soulmate thing actually real? He had to admit, whatever it was really did smell incredible. He could hardly describe it. There were elements he recognised, treacle tart and the woody sort of smell of a broomstick handle. There was a sweet scent as well, vanilla perhaps, and some other familiar smell that he couldn’t quite place. But then there was something else beneath the other scents, flowing through them all, melding them all into one, something deeper, more intense, that he didn’t recognise at all.
And then Draco’s hands were sliding up his torso, stopping to undo the clasps of his robes and pushing the fabric off of his shoulders. Harry relaxed his arms for a moment, letting the robe drop to the floor to pool around his ankles before making swift work of Draco’s robe and tie.
“Are you...intentionally trying to tease me?” Harry moaned.
When he was only a couple of feet away from the other boy, he couldn’t resist it anymore. The temptation was too much, and he lunged forward, claiming Draco’s lips for his own.
“Yup, it’s nifty stuff,” said Ginny. “When you wear it, it won’t smell of anything to most people, but to your true soulmate, and them alone, it will smell absolutely irresistible. Luna here concocted it herself. Absolute genius.”
“What’re you—” Harry’s question was cut off by his own moan, as Draco returned his mouth to Harry’s cock, slowly taking in as much of its length as he could. And then he felt Draco’s finger pressing against his entrance, rubbing against the sensitive nerve endings there and then slowly sliding in. It was a strange sensation, but not unpleasant, he supposed. And then the finger curled a little, rubbing around inside until it pressed against something inside him that made Harry cry out in pleasure. “Fuck! What?”
“We should probably...you know...talk about this or something?”
Draco continued to rub his finger against that sweet spot, eliciting a low moan from Harry. He tried to buck his hips again, but Draco’s other hand was still holding him down firmly. And then the soft warmth of Draco’s mouth was engulfing him again, as his finger continued to press and rub at his prostate.
Draco collapsed onto the bed beside Harry, and the two of them just lay there, catching their breaths. Harry thought about casting a cleaning charm to get rid of the mess on himself, but he wasn’t quite sure where his wand had ended up amidst the clothes strewn across the floor.
He felt his balls tighten, and moments later he was unloading himself down Draco’s throat, groaning out a stream of expletives. After swallowing, Draco released Harry’s cock from his mouth and shifted back up, straddling Harry’s legs. He pulled his underpants down, unsheathing his own erection and began stroking it.
“Mmhmm,” Draco hummed in response, as he parted his lips in invitation once more.
Then Draco’s leg was slipping between his, and Harry was letting out a low moan as it pressed up against Harry’s rock hard member, and… wait when had he gotten hard? Not that it mattered, he told himself, bringing his hand up to card through soft blond locks.
If he really wanted to, Harry figured he could probably overcome the strange effects the perfume seemed to be having on him. Just turn around and run. And yet...he didn’t.
Draco pulled his underpants back up, then rolled to his side to face him. “So.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling his body flush against his own. He let out a low moan, as he felt his own hardness meet the prominent bulge in the other boy’s trousers.
Draco licked up the underside of his cock again, and the sides, making sure to let plenty of saliva coat it. He then used one of his hands to encircle the member, moving it around to coat the entire length with the slick wetness.
“So…” Harry began.
“We shouldn’t be disturbed n—” Harry began, as he closed the door behind them. Draco cut him off, shoving Harry up against the door and pressing their lips together once more.
Draco took that as his cue and plunged his head down around Harry’s cock, engulfing as much of its length as would fit in his mouth without making him gag, and used his hand to encircle the rest. Slowly he began to move up and down. It felt so warm and wet. It was like nothing Harry had ever experienced before, given that his only prior experience consisted of his own hand. This was so much better, so much more intense. Harry didn’t think he’d last long if Draco kept this up.
Harry moaned over and over. That feeling as Draco rubbed against the sensitive spot inside him, he’d never tried doing something like that before, but damn it was good. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. God, I’m close. Draco I’m gonna—”
“Oh,” was all Harry managed in response, with a near-identical horrified expression. So Draco was his… No, he couldn’t even finish that thought. Maybe this was all just some kind of sick prank. Ginny had a wicked sense of humour, after all, perhaps she set all this up somehow. Maybe? What if the joke was that the perfume actually smelt good to the person you...liked the least? Ginny might find that funny. He couldn’t really see Luna being interested in a prank like that, though. And then he remembered Ron and Hermione. There was no way Hermione was the person Ron liked the least. In fact, quite the opposite. Which only left one possibility…Ron and Hermione must be in on it too.
“I—I mean. I just..” Harry found himself blushing now. “I never… really thought about you like that, I guess. I mean we’ve just always been enemies, so it didn’t exactly cross my mind. I didn’t really expect you would’ve either. But like, now, thinking about it, I guess...I think I do...like you.”
“True soulmates apparently,” Draco replied, deadpan.
And perhaps the feeling might be mutual. Despite Draco’s tense posture, seemingly trying to hold himself back as well, he had also taken a tiny step toward Harry.
The three of them had just set off from the common room when Ron suddenly stopped in his tracks. “Shit, I think I left something.” He looked in his bag. “Yeah, I’ll have to pop back.”
“But like, us? Soulmates? That’s crazy, isn’t it? How are we soulmates?”
Mustering up every ounce of self-control he possessed, he managed to push Draco away. “Come with me,” Harry muttered, then grabbed the boy’s hand and began dragging him along. Surprisingly, or perhaps unsurprisingly, he met no resistance from Draco, who followed along obediently all the way to the Room of Requirement. Passing students gave them some odd looks along the way. But Harry didn’t have it in him to care right now.
However, despite his brain’s protests, Harry couldn’t stop himself taking another step forward, toward that intoxicating scent. He breathed it in deeply, letting the odour fill his lungs, overloading his senses. It was as if it held some power over him, almost as if he were being physically pulled toward it. And the more he breathed it, the more he felt drawn to it, wanting to wrap himself up in it, be surrounded by it, lose himself in it.
“Eloquent as ever, Potter,” Draco drawled.
Draco snorted. “Sure.”
Hermione turned beet red.
“As much as I’d love to stay, I think I’ll just leave you guys to explain it to him,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I really do need to get on with that potions essay, so I’ll see you guys in a bit.” Then he walked off. After a few moments, he couldn’t help chuckling to himself, when he heard Ron’s voice behind him cry out, “It’s what?”
“Perhaps.” Draco looked up at him with a sly grin. “It’s fun to watch you squirm.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry replied, sitting up and looking around the room. He probably should locate his wand and get himself cleaned up. Then he turned back to look at Draco. “But, if we’re taking things slowly...we can still make out and stuff right?”
Draco stopped kissing and lifted himself up, looking down at Harry. “Do you really want to have this conversation right now?” he asked, cocking his eyebrow. Draco moved his hand to Harry’s clearly bulging crotch and gave it a small squeeze, emphasising his point. “Or would you rather deal with this first?” Harry couldn’t help bucking his hips up into the other boy’s touch with a slight groan.
However, every time Harry thought he might be getting close, the pace changed, or Draco paused to do something different. Keeping him close but never close enough. Occasionally, he would pause at the tip, using his hand to pull the foreskin back, so he could lick the sensitive spot on the underside of the head. Which felt amazing, he had to admit. But it just wasn’t quite enough.
“Please,” Harry said, looking down Draco pleadingly.
Draco’s fingers made deft work of Harry’s belt, swiftly unbuckling and unbuttoning. He slid the trousers and underwear down, allowing the hard cock beneath to spring free. He loosened his own pants as well and shirked them off, so he was only in his underwear, before returning his attention to Harry.
Luna blushed lightly at the compliment.
Draco smirked and continued to kiss down Harry’s chest, stopping briefly to suck Harry’s nipple, eliciting a sharp moan.
"Please, sir," the brunette whispered, earning himself a rewarding kiss on the forehead.
"Open up, slut," Draco demanded, making Harry instantly take the two digits in his mouth, tongue swirling around them. Draco groaned at the sight, feeling his dick twitch in his sweatpants. This wasn't about him anymore, though, so he ignored it.
"Yeah—please, just, anything," Harry whimpered when the blonde's grip pressed down a little harder, rubbing him with more force.
, Draco thought.
"Please, what?" Draco said with a raised brow, stopping his movements.
Harry simply nodded, letting out a helpless please, desperate for something. He'd seriously take anything at this point.
Harry gulped, nodding, moving back to take Draco in his mouth, flattening his tongue against the underside of it, giving it one long lick that brought a groan out of Draco. Harry was painfully hard in his trousers but he didn't want to come yet, wanting to finish with Draco's hand around him, coaxing him on with filthy yet encouraging words being whispered into his ear as he squirmed. He visibly shivered at the thought, getting his mouth around the blonde, taking him about two thirds of the way, his lack of a gag reflex coming in handy. Draco moaned lowly.
"Good."
Harry threw his head back when Draco picked up the pace, his back arching. He furrowed his brows a little when something pressed at his lips.
"Look at you," Draco practically purred, voice mocking yet fond. "So eager to please me, aren't you?"
He reminds himself of the lessons he was taught as a child to control his emotions he takes a breath "I expect nothing less, Potter." He manages to say in a bored tone even though everything in him is screaming at how close Harry is. He could reach out and touch him, but doing so would likely get him hexed. "I think I'll go study elsewhere." He hisses grabbing his book and marching out of the room. He sighs heavily once he's halfway down the hall equally relieved to be away from Harry and confused at his desire to be closer to him. He hurries down the hall towards Pansy's room in need of advice.
This is when headmaster mcgonagall steps up to the front of the room. Holding up her wand to her throat she begins to speak, her voice amplified across the room. Completely skipping a greeting he says "As some of you are already aware, there has been an injury on Hogwarts grounds." There is a ripple of whispers across the room but she continues. "Rest assured that this issue will be dealt with. We will not tolerate this sort of violence within Hogwarts walls. If anybody has information on the attack come see me in my office after class." With this she takes her seat and there is immediate chatter among the students.
They each kick off the ground rising as quickly as they can to get out of reach. Draco wobbles on his broom for a moment not having ridden one since he was a child. Spells ate yelled beneath them but luckily they fizzle out before they reach high enough.  "Time to grab our stuff and go!" Crabbe yells over the wind and they all turn in the direction of the inn. As they draw close to the inn they can only hope there isn't anyone waiting to ambush them.
"Come on, it's simple! We just tell our parents we're each staying at the other's homes. They aren't too fond of one another so that will buy us a weekend at the very least. If we leave tomorrow we'll have plenty of time to get there for the first weekend of the party then we'll return and they'll be none the wiser." Crabbe said pushing back his chair and standing as if the matter is settled.
Draco has only been in the infirmirary a handful of times and he was always an absolute pain. He would whine and moan the entire time or if it was his friend that was injured he would demand all attention on them even when it was unnecessary. It's embarrassing to think about and how Madam Pomfrey put up with him is beyond him entirely. He looks up when she pulls aside the curtain holding a tray of vials and promptly gets to work carefully measuring each one.
"I regret to leave my post but I must introduce your new head mistress" She pauses her eyes cutting over to where a door opens to the right of the podium. Her eyes grow fierce and as if she has to drag the name out of her she says with immense displeasure "Dolores Umbridge." The reaction is immediate, students are standing from their seats and yelling as Umbridge reveals herself and approaches the podium. There is a particularly riotous reaction from gryffindor, who had faced the worst of her punishments when she was last head mistress. Dolores smiles completely ignoring the chaos among the houses. And as she reaches the podium she holds her wand up to her throat and a loud and familiar "Ahem" issues across the room. This does nothing to quell the students and she continues to smile as if she is listening to a pleasant tune.
Harry made an exasperated noise and threw his head back against the pillows, as Draco bobbed his head down again once more before stopping yet again.
“Fuck, please!” Harry begged.
“She’s hoping to do a bit of matchmaking, see,” Ginny continued. “Spray as many people at Hogwarts as possible and hopefully pair up a few soulmates along the way.”
“See you in a minute then,” Harry called after Ron.
“I guess we can talk about it later,” he replied breathlessly.
Perfume? Harry sniffed at himself. “Err, it doesn’t smell of anything,” he responded quizzically, wondering if this was some kind of strange joke.
“You want more?” Draco responded with a smirk.
“Soulmates?” Hermione said suspiciously, as she eyed the other two girls.
It was at that moment that Ron finally caught up. His face was flushed and he seemed out of breath. “Hey guys—” he began to say, but then froze, staring at Hermione. “‘Mione, did you put on perfume?”
