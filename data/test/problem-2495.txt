. Draco happily nurses a glass of champagne, revising his work week’s to-do list in his head near the stage, when he’s startled out of his thoughts.
Draco is drunk and forced to play some silly game — he wouldn’t kiss him on any other occasion. Draco’s been adamant throughout their friendship about Harry keeping his hands and his feelings to himself. And though Harry feels like he’s reached heaven, he knows this isn’t right. He knows he’s just taking this pleasure from Draco, and Harry promised himself he would no longer be the type of man only concerned with his own pleasure. Draco’s kiss isn’t something that has been willingly given to him of sound mind and body. Harry would never take that from anyone in such a state, let alone Draco, no matter how many years he’s been pining.
“Wait. . . what the fuck,” he panted out, kneading Harry's arms in his hand when he began attacking his neck right after his lips. “how did you just apparate us inside the house.”
“Don't you remember?” Harry searched his eyes. “I've always thought your hair was really pretty. Especially like this.”
“Stupid enough for you to be making that face? I doubt it. Come on, humor me.”
Draco's
Somehow, when those came from Harry's lips with all the sincerity in the world, Draco was inclined to believe him.
“You have the loveliest body I've ever laid eyes on,” Harry commented, almost absentmindedly, gazing down at Draco with glazed, gleaming eyes. He gasped when Draco clenched around him. “so tight. So good, baby.”
. . .” Harry's thrusts stuttered to a slower rhythm as he chased his own orgasm. Then with a bite down his lower lip and a long groan, he came and spilled inside Draco, his arms going to wrap around Draco's waist.
Along with the memories, a familiar flicker of fire hot emotion sparked in his heart, waiting to be fanned to a flame.
“Fuck, I missed you,” Draco, unable to form coherent words, whined and pulled Harry impossibly closer and clamped his legs around the other man's waist. “you have no idea how long I've been looking for you. Who would've thought I'd find you in Wizarding France. Married to some rich pureblood ponce.”
Fiddling at the delicate strap on his wrist, Draco trailed quietly behind Jacques after shutting the door to their room. The silence felt heavy and it weighed on his shoulders.
Snorting, Draco turned his back in hopes that the man wouldn't read the mortifying, unsaid want written on his face. Draco knew Harry would be disgusted of him if he realized, even more than he probably already was. Draco was disgusted of himself.
“I'm fine. It's just about something stupid.”
Harry was convinced that Draco Malfoy was made just for him.
His heart sank to his stomach. And the way he whirled around so suddenly felt too familiar to him, almost a deja vu moment. Save for the fact that instead of a dingy bathroom in an old castle, it was under the dimmed light of a sleek and modern kitchen, his stance unassuming with a relaxed and knowing look on his face and he certainly didn't have his wand out and ready to hex his face off.
want.”
As he said the last sentence, he searched Draco's eyes for answers. Draco couldn't give him one, as he didn't know it himself.
“Trouble in paradise, it seems.”
“Because,” he drawled, taking a step closer. Draco resisted the urge to lean in and take greedy gulps of that alluring scent. “a week is more than enough for me to earn his trust, become his best mate, and loosen his tongue with alcohol.” he pushed his hair from his face, shaking his head. “God, the amount of shite he spouts. Especially about his own
And so.
Harry acted the same around Jacques, and Jacques around Harry. He was friendly, casual and especially chipper. None of tense awkwardness Draco dreaded to see. He felt relieved, if only for  short time. Draco saw the glacial stare Harry threw everytime Jacques turned his back. Draco didn't miss the empty look in Jacques eyes as his gaze flitted back and forth between him and Harry.
Draco all but squeaked, seemingly embarrassed and Harry grinned. He peeled Draco's knickers away, leaving them suspended on his knees. Then, he put his mouth on Draco's leaking cock, relishing at the soft cry he made when Harry didn't waste any second in devouring him, licking at the precome that dribbled endlessly. His cheeks hollowed as he sucked him off until Draco's thighs trembled on either sides of his face.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I wasn't done yet, you knew that,” he huffed and there was a small, knowing smirk on his lips. “let me rephrase that. You're troubled because of how your life ended up. By marrying this man you've come to hate over the years.”
The sheets felt too hot and he felt smothered. In his own house. His own bed. His own
the reason —” he managed to bite his tongue, though judging from the expression on Harry's face, he knew exactly what Draco was going to say. “You've known him for how long? A week? How can you be so certain he's not a good husband?”
Draco inhaled sharply once he remembered and then closed his eyes.
“No, don't be. I didn't mean — It's just. . .” Harry sighed. “I missed you so much, Draco. Now that I found you, I don't feel like letting you go again.”
“I could say
Harry had the audacity to look sheepish as he pulled away briefly, “sorry about your wards, might've broken some of them,” he apologized while sounding the least bit apologetic, looking off the side for a second before a shirt zoomed into his hand and gave it to Draco, as if his broken wards were considered a less important matter. “can you wear this? For me?”
Despite himself, he raised his head and expected to see an empty space where Harry had been — except he was engulfed face full by a staggeringly familiar scent that settled itself beside him. A foot away too close. The overwhelming scent of Amortentia.
Especially the longer he stared down at him as he writhed underneath him, hips frantically rolling up desperate for the hot friction between them.
He tensed when Harry walked closer only to open the fridge and get himself a bottle of milk. “Care to share? I'm bad at advices, but I can listen.” he offered, regarding him with those irritatingly incandescent green eyes before he tipped his head back and chugged, his Adam's apple bobbing. Draco let his eyes wander down his sturdy figure shamelessly for a few seconds before he shook his head.
— and he wanted out. With that in mind, he threw the blankets off of him and stood up, leaving the room without sparing a single glance behind him. He all but ran to the direction of the kitchen as quietly as he could, fetching himself a cold glass of water and downing it all in one go. He squeezed the counter tight until his knuckles turned white , glaring at the wedding band on his finger as though it was the root of all his misery. In a way, it was.
marriage ended in quite a civil manner — or was that you projecting just now?”
“Shut up. Stop talking shit. You're beginning to annoy me.” he sniffed, further proving Harry's point.
“I'm sorry if I find it hard to believe that you can stand a man like Jacques. And marry him, much less,” he drawled, crossing his arms on his chest. “I have a feeling he exhausted all of his competency in doing business. I doubt he's good at anything else.”
,” Draco sucked in a sharp breath prompting Harry to run comforting patterns on his skin. “he said you couldn't come with him that night so I couldn't be sure if it was you. But consider my interest piqued, so I told him what I knew he wanted to hear.”
“That's what he tells me.” oddly, he felt defensive.
“Feel all right?”
Harry made a noise of protest.
He put the empty glass down, the sound of glass against marble drowned out by his harsh breathing and the blood rushing in his ears.
After a series of licking, nipping and sucking from Harry's part, something wet and warm hit his face just as Draco released a muffled moan, his palm over his mouth. When he pulled away and sat up he realized that Draco came all over his stomach.
. It made him sick. Everything about his life made him sick.
If there was one thing Jacques was especially horrendous at, it was sex. He couldn't recall ever feeling this good with Jacques.
“I'm already,
” he chanted absently, as though his name was a prayer, staring dazedly at Harry through his thick, bright lashes, his eyes seemed opalescent under the moonlight. His long blonde locks splayed out against the dark sheets, a few strands stuck to his cheek. Harry pressed his hips down, feeling his chest heat up at the sight of Draco's eyes fluttering close and lips part. He let his hands travel south, gripping Draco's hips then thumbing at the lace fabric.
, he had owled Harry as soon as he locked himself in the room as Harry was just leaving, knowing he'd receive the letter in less than five hours.
How did Harry Potter end up staying a night over his house? Oh, right. His beloved husband had a penchant for sucking up to influencial people. Although in regards to exactly how he had managed to capture Harry Potter's interest in networking, he had no idea. All he knew was that he came home to his husband and Potter having a hearty chat about
And so Harry did. Bracing his arms on either side of Draco, placing Draco's calves on his shoulders then digging his knees on the sheets. He rocked his hips forward in vigorous thrusts. Countering Draco's gasps of delight with his own grunts as he pounded into his tight heat. Draco looked delicious like this, flushed and writhing underneath him, back arching wantonly, a thin layer of sweat causing his skin to shine.

I hardly care about that anymore. We've all made terrible choices at one point in our lives. That includes Jacques and his family cowardly hiding amongst muggles during the war — but even so, the war should be behind us. It happened and it's all history,” he carded his fingers through Draco's hair. “and for what it's worth, I adore you. Probably too much.”
Draco swallows and meets Potter gaze. With a nod of his head, Draco receives the answer to his unspoken question.
“Yeah, you’re right, Pansy,” Potter sighs. “I know it’s not your fault, it’s just,
Draco blinks up at him. When had he gone back to
Draco glances over his saucer of sake at Potter before staring out the window. “It’s okay. Stressful.”

“With all due respect, Auror Potter, based on recent news coverage I’ve seen about you two, I have to question your ability to remain unbiased in the proceedings of this suspect,” Andrews challenges, his grip on Draco’s arm tightening.
. We...we lo-
“On one condition, then.”
Draco scrambles to decipher another polaroid.
“I don’t want to come in between whatever you and Smith have going on.”
A wild, frantic wail escapes the creature as Harry takes several steps back from it, watching as it slides down the wall to land on the floor. It lays out on its side before curling into a ball, broken whimpers escaping it like the wounded animal it is. Harry shakes his head.
When the Floo flares to green, Blaise turns around. “Oh well, Potter’s loss has been my ultimate gain. Hear-hear!” Blaise says, lifting his glass. “To pub night!”
“Stop it. You’re too afraid to face what’s happened to you.” Pansy says firmly. “Stop making excuses for taking control of your life. I can’t always be there to guide you.”
He slips from Draco’s office as quietly as he entered.

Draco really loves that around him, she doesn’t have to pretend to be made of ice.

There’s no way in hell he’s going to tell him.
“Even worse to remove—I have to squat to get the bloody thing out,” Daphne says, pulling out several jars of jam from the pantry. “Pun intended.”
“Well, let’s up the ante then, shall we? We can pay a visit to the Shafiq’s London property,” Theo counters.
Draco feels smothered.
Draco peers into the dark room, feeling apprehensive.
” Draco whines, small, breathy pants slipping past his lips as his eyelids flutter, his hands gripping the sheets. He rocks his hips up into Harry’s fist as Harry keeps talking, uttering sweet nonsense, whispering
Kreacher sounds as if he's about to cry. “Master Black is being the sole heir to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black! Not even Harry Potter is being this, Sir, but Kreacher is being dealing with Harry Potter’s need for Kreacher to wear clothes and take wages! This is not what loyal elves to the House of Black should being doing, Master, and Kreacher is hoping that Master Black is here to be setting to rights the order of this family!” Kreacher cries, still in his deep bow.
“Hey, wow, so good to see you, Healer Malfoy, how are you?”
He stands from the chair that was once his prison, crosses the room, wraps one hand around the back of Draco’s head and yanks him forward.
Blaise finally breaks his eye contact from Draco to nod at Bitty.
He throws his blanket off of him, quickly grabbing his wand from his nightstand. He needs to figure out his next moves, but first, a shower to wash away yesterday’s mistakes is needed. Then, getting Harry’s Cloak of Invisibility back to him is the priority of the day.
Draco pulls out his pocket watch when he notices that people are starting to take their seats. When he looks up, Pansy is darting between tables to reach him, dressed in a strapless, sweetheart silk champagne-coloured mermaid gown.
Harry’s hand shakes as he shifts the long strands of Draco’s hair off the back of his neck. His skin is hot to the touch. The towel soothes the heat. Draco cries harder, the creature breathing fire into his lungs.
Draco pushes back from the table, eyeing the small tower of sex toys. “Circe’s tits! Are these toys even
he whispers. He should want to say next: ‘
Originally Pansy’s solicitor on retainer, Edward Simmons is well-known for defending people the Ministry sides against but the public lauds. Woman kills abusive husband? Simmons is on the case. A man made terminally-ill due to working decades in what’s now been confirmed as a toxic wasteland? Simmons is front and centre. Ex-Death Eater, ex-Junior Prosecutor turned vigilante thief? Simmons is here for it. It’s rare for guilty parties to have representation like Simmons in front of the Wizengamot, but great minds think alike and Draco’s happy that Pansy isn’t taking any chances with the Wizengamot on Draco’s behalf. If anyone can help him, it’s Simmons.
A part of everyone in their family, gone. Albus, a piece of him missing in the form of a twin. Draco, a child grown within his own body, ripped away from him. James and Lily, a sibling. Harry, his youngest son.

He stops abruptly, his eyes widening as he gapes at the dark-haired witch chatting up Seamus. Her black bob ends bluntly at her jaw, her straight bangs emphasising the heavy black of her eyeliner. She’s dressed in a tight one-sleeved, shoulder-padded, sparkly blood red dress and a diamond choker, her long legs crossed with incredibly tall strappy heels dangling from her feet.

“I see that,” Pansy says, primly taking Mia’s hand to help her up the stairs.
Draco hears Potter call out, “Hermione, please!”
He tells Potter he can’t spend the night at Grimmauld but he’s more than welcome to stay at his flat if he doesn’t interrupt his meetings and brewing. Potter’s understanding, but Draco can tell he’s more nervous lately. Potter doesn’t spend the night at his flat all week nor does he try to engage Draco in sex. They have dinner together each night. Sometimes Potter will arrive early enough to cook for them or Draco will owl in takeaway. When Potter makes his way to the Floo after dinner, he pulls Draco in for a slow kiss before spinning away.
Severus taught Draco how to conjure a Patronus the summer after Third Year when he told him he struggled all year in Defence. After a month of trying, Draco was able to produce a corporeal greyhound. He remembers the joy he felt watching it leap and run so incredibly fast while playing with Severus’s doe.
“My last episode in Granger’s office,” Draco begins, tilting his chin up and meeting Potter’s keen patience head on. “It was about you. It must not have been too long ago, Granger looked as far along in her pregnancy as she does now. In the memory she had an idea that involved us placing you in front of the Veil in the Death Chamber.”
” Draco says, voice going an octave higher from his shock. “How are you still alive?”
“Harry,” Draco looks into those iridescent green eyes before wrapping Harry into a hug. “I’m so sorry...I’m sorry. There’s still so much I have to tell you, but please, right now, I just want you to touch me. I want you to make me forget all the bad, how bad everything...me...how everything is. At least for now, please? Please. Please,” Draco begs, pressing soft kisses against the side of Harry’s face, not caring that he sounds desperate.
Draco has lived in the dark for so long, he’d forgotten what warmth felt like.
, cringing as his voice comes out slurred.
Harry takes him home.
Draco can see Harry swallow hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “Pear-shaped. Already?”
“I will not be going in,” Padma says quietly. It’s then that Draco notices she’s dressed in her colourful sleep robe, having probably gone back to her room before Draco woke again, otherwise she would have heard his earlier altercation with Potter. He feels a fissure of relief.
you bloody cry like this before, so…excuse me if I don’t readily leave you to it. Tell me what’s happened.” Draco shakes his head. “C’mon, you can tell me anything—”
you—”
So much
He groans, sinking further into the couch. “I don’t like where this conversation is going.” He had expected Pansy to soothe his ire while he licked his wounds, not pour salt onto them.
Harry’s standing in front of Angel station, having agreed to meet Draco there, which was all well for Harry as Grimmauld Place is a short walk from the station. He wrings his hands. Draco’s invited him to his muggle friend’s flat for a party. He’s unbelievably nervous.
white blond hair.
“Another one?” she asks, slipping beside him under the covers.
“Bye, Rosie!” Harry says, waving at his goddaughter. “See you later.”
I nearly pissed myself.”
Bribery? Flint is keeping records of bribes within the DMLE.

Harry hands the letter back, and pulls out a small, square object from the inside pocket of his jacket. “I found this, and I knew I had to try,” he says. Darting a glance around the park, he waves his hand over the object and Draco watches as it grows into a paperback.
“How did you…?” Draco lapses, his eyes widening, placing the dittany on a side table.
Draco knows that Harry still has the green bow Draco wore that night he agreed to date him. He’s framed it in a shadow box that he keeps on his nightstand.
Potter sees him, but doesn’t see him.
“What is it?” Draco asks, his heart thudding and old welcome sensation of arousal shooting through him.

Draco looks up to see Pansy standing in the benches, her pale face flushed and tears streaming down her cheeks as she twists the hem of her blouse in her hands. Theo and Millie try to pull her down, but she lunges forward, her hands wrapping around the railing.
Draco broaches the topic the best way he knows how.

Despite the million questions that crop up in Draco’s head about that revelation, he keeps them to himself. “Fine. What’s the hiss for open?”
Blaise’s grin falters, all playfulness aside as his lips purse, a line appearing between his brows as his jaw firms up and he nods, stepping closer to them. “Are you alright?” Blaise asks firmly. “If someone
Harry smiles kindly and nods at him as he stands from his chair. “Of course.”
Andrews shouts, snatching the wand out of the air. “I said come to the table. Don’t make me snap it in half.” He waves the wand teasingly.
Harry doesn’t at all miss the disappointed look that crosses Draco’s face when he gets up to use the loo.
touch my drink, Blaise?” Draco complains as Blaise takes a sip from it, waiting for Harry to slide onto the bench.
“Speak for yourself,” he quips, to which Draco shoves him roughly in retort.
They take a taxi to 10 Broadway, as Potter says the area is too concentrated with Muggles to Apparate into. The ride there is bumpy and he slides from side to side in the leather seat with every insane turn the cabbie makes. Potter, somehow, doesn’t budge an inch during these turns and Draco glares at him from the corner of his eyes in envy.
“Who in their right mind would invite a talking arse like yourself to a lovely occasion like this?” Draco drawls, slightly horrified.
we were both restless and disappointed when we couldn’t squeeze blood from a turnip. Ginny was in love with Luna and I never quite got over you.” A brief silence stretches between them before Harry shifts awkwardly and asks, “And you? Was there...anyone special?”
“Alright now!” Theo says, leaning forward, his arms branching out to protect the small thin lines decorated across his glass coffee table. “You lot are going to ruin a good thing before it even gets started.”
Draco pauses as he watches Potter’s hands tighten into fists. Draco swallows. “What is it?”

He texts him right away.
Malfoy slumps in his seat, spent, as he warily eyes Harry.
“Thanks for being here for me this year, Harry.”

“Now the gin tonic,” Parkinson orders. Harry groans but picks up the drink and swallows about half of it. When he places the drink down his vision and head swoops with such a force that he stumbles into Parkinson who quickly pushes him off. This just causes him to ricochet into Malfoy, who grabs a hold of his elbow to help keep him steady. Even in the poorly lit space of the club, Harry’s sure Malfoy can see the embarrassed flush to his face. He swallows, trying to regain a modicum of dignity as he rights himself.
The cacophony that erupts around Draco is
Draco shakes himself, trying not to lose consciousness. He’s dizzy and confused and weak, his hands soaked as he bleeds out. “Harry,” Draco says weakly. “Stop, Harry, please. You’re...you’re killing him. Remember, Harry...your humanity.”
He tries hard, several hours later when it’s just Potter and him curled up together in their bed, to forget the shiver of dread that ran up his spine, fearful that Pansy’s departing words would come back to haunt him.
Draco has the audacity to look around, confused. “Oh! Well it’s my shopping, silly man. It’s Valentine’s Day, I had to treat myself.”
Draco. How dare he think he has any right to believe he does.
“You look handsome.”
Harry’s responding grin is so wicked and devilish, Draco is nowhere near surprised that the blood in his body pumps south. “Don’t underestimate me,” Harry says, his tone pitched low, husky. Draco shivers.
Draco cackles.
goes unsaid.
Draco’s happy that Narcissa won the Chairwoman role for the Jewell Ball Committee, besting Bitty’s potentially murderous mother in their popularity contest. Unlike the garden parties Draco’s attended this Season, Narcissa decided to hold the Pink Party in one of their newly-remodelled massive ballrooms with the wide terraces overlooking the Malfoy gardens, pool, and ponds. When he arrives at the party, an entire wall of the ballroom is made up of blossoming red, pale pink, hot pink, and white roses and peonies. Massive ice sculptures shaped as dolphins and seahorses adorn each corner of the room, and the chandeliers have a slight pink hue to them. Draco finds it all a bit much for his personal taste, but all in all, it’s not too bad for these coked-out débutantes.
“Where is the…where is your father?” Harry corrects.
Badges. He misses his freedom, a mind that didn’t race with intrusive, horrible thoughts all the time, he misses his…innocence.
From the corner of his eye, Draco can see the sad smile on his face. Draco can appreciate Potter’s need to keep an eye out on his friends and family, even if it comes off a bit strange that he knows the location of someone at any given moment. Potter’s lost too many people over the years. Draco frowns. It makes it all the more worse knowing just how protective and loving Potter is when it comes to his friends. Even in Hogwarts, Potter’s fierce loyalty and love annoyed Draco, not because it was ridiculously Gryffindor; Draco can now admit it was due to jealousy. He wanted to feel that level of commitment and love. He shamefully wanted Potter to embrace him with that kind of energy. It was one of many emotions Draco had buried deep during the war, only slipping through a few times. Particularly, the night Potter and his friends were brought to Malfoy Manor by Snatchers during the war. Draco allowed his emotions to cloud his decisions, refusing to identify Potter despite having spent years glaring into his face across the Great Hall, Quidditch Pitch, and classrooms.
As he says this Granger fidgets, her shoulders rolling back and her hands twitching as they come forward to rest against her belly.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Gedeon snorts. “I don’t see colour or gender.”

Draco grunts, allowing himself a few more moments in Pansy’s embrace before he catapults towards the toilet. When his hands once again grip the rim, he heaves a heavy sigh and clears his throat.
,” Blaise says as he lays Draco down onto the chesterfield.
“Hey, there’s no need for threats! We were in shock!” Harry shouts after her. “How rude,” he says, glancing at Draco’s pale, shocked face. He looks away and sees Pansy shoving Ginny’s panties into her trouser pocket. She then carefully covers her tits with a lacy red bra followed by her button down, not bothering to do the buttons. She smiles widely and saunters up to them both, placing a sweet kiss on Draco’s cheek. This seems to finally jolt Draco from his shock.
“Yes, Harry. I would like to discuss my son,” Narcissa says gravely. “I was made aware of your friendship with him from its conception. I even encouraged it. I was glad to hear that my son was building bridges after my husband and I had burned so many down for him.”
Neville
“Well, Harry, some burglars are always looking for windows of opportunity and a while back, I took mine,” Draco says dryly.
Draco can already feel the potion taking effect, his stiff muscles relaxing as he slumps against his pillows, sliding down the bed before tugging his duvet up. When he looks towards the corner of the room, his hallucination is gone. He sighs in relief.
Teddy’s friend, Maggie screams, “LEAVE HER ALONE!” as one of the older boys rips Teddy’s fairy wings from off his back. Another boy holds Maggie back while the last one shoves Teddy, hard, causing him to fall roughly backwards onto his bum.
“How about this way: Draco Malfoy. I’m in love with you!” Harry shouts, causing Draco to wince and for his cheeks to flush. But saying it out loud feels so freeing, and it’s as if a dam has broken in him and he can’t stop the flood of emotions or the words that tumble from his lips. “I love every single thing about you. I love how you’ve built this fucking amazing life for yourself. I love how brave you are, how strong you are. I love that you’re compassionate, that you take your neighbour’s
wouldn’t be standing where you are without Tracey and her family,” Draco mutters darkly.
Potter shakes his head, eyes wide behind his glasses. “No, they don’t. Look here,” he points.
“Are you sure you don’t need help?”
Pansy’s brows furrow in confusion before realisation dawns on her. “Do I think Potter will go to Azkaban? I doubt it. There’s going to be a whole investigation, Pensieves and Veritaserum and maybe even some plea bargaining from Smith, probably. But there were
Harry’s finding that he can’t keep a tally anymore on all the little and big ways that Draco surprises him. Everyday he learns something new about the man that makes his fondness grow to monstrous proportions and consumes any and all negative thoughts he’s ever had about Draco. This was still Draco Malfoy— tall, blond, impossibly pale, and obnoxious, but this was
“Er…”
“Well, it doesn’t look like a baby,” Hermione interjects, earning a kiss on the cheek from Ron and a glare from Draco.
“Oh,” Draco says softly. “Because you think I might be nice?”
“In all fairness, I didn’t want to detract from Pansy’s night,” Hermione says, her cheeks flushed from the excitement and wisps of hair escaping from her high, curly ponytail.
for even
shopping with Ginny,” he mutters, turning to see Ginny exiting down the stairs. She waves at him as she disappears. He turns back to Malfoy with a shrug.
“Two double gin and tonics, and if you call me princess again, I’ll disembowel you,” she says, voice husky, smoky eyelids lowered.
“This does not excuse his crimes,” Watson says.
Harry and Draco eloped on a cold mid-November morning. Harry had rented a car and they had driven for over a day to the tiny magical community in Felixstowe. A day into their stay in the seaside town, they stopped at a small church ran by an ancient wizard to seal the deal through a short bonding ceremony. They had been dating for two years already, defying all expectations and bets from friends and family that the relationship wouldn’t last beyond a month. They waited to tell their friends and family, deciding to explore the Eastern region and the beaches that lined the coast. Harry found that he loved the notion of keeping their marriage a secret for those few short weeks. After all, secrets are seductive, and Draco was the most seductive presence in his life. He wanted to keep it all to himself for as long as possible.
“You’re a snake,” Robinson growls. “This is madness.
“You also know that we never judge you,” Hermione says gently. “We want you to come to us to talk about the things that are hurting you, but we just don’t want to push you...We just want you to be happy.”
“Draco, did you hear me? Are you enjoying yourself?” Bitty asks, drawing him from his thoughts, once again nudging him in his side.
They all bristle in their seats.
Pansy arrives after, still dressed in her Ministry robe, dark green eyes weary, and with a full purse. “Millie came round from the Portkey Office with another batch of the most interesting objects, my loves!” she says.
“Hey, that’s my boyfriend you’re talking about,” Potter says, bumping his shoulder lightly into his, a small smile twisting his mouth. He must have just gotten in – he’s still in his Auror robes and his hair is windswept. They both look at each other in the mirror and Potter carefully reaches out to clasp their hands together. “Go on,” Potter urges gently. “Look at yourself, Draco.”
The room the Aurors push him into after removing his Bind doesn’t have a charmed window, unfortunately, just half a dozen lit sconces. He squints in the somewhat bright light. This room is much warmer than his cell and he’s not shivering like usual. It has a rickety wooden table and two chairs, one currently occupied by a portly man that Draco recognises as his solicitor. They’ve only met three times within the first week of Draco’s detention.
Bitty sighs, her breath tickling the underside of Draco’s jaw as she peers up at him. “I didn’t say anything wrong,” she whispers before backing away from him.
Draco sighs in relief. “Good. And just so we’re clear, this will be the first and last time I play messenger.”
Millie rolls her eyes. “We’ve been over this. I’m too fat to fit into your clothes, Pansy.”
But Draco doesn’t care.
It wasn’t that Saeed intentionally hid his relationship from his parents. Or at least that’s the lie Draco feeds himself to stave off the painful ache of reality.
“Fuck me,” he says against Potter’s lips.
“I love it when you moan my name. I want to remember you like this, so beautiful. I want to remember this moment so I can treasure it for all of eternity.”
“Yes. Whatever did you do with the dog?” Blaise asks.
Panic surges through Draco. Some nights he still has nightmares about the Fiendfyre from the Battle. Dreams of Harry not reaching him in time and falling into the violent flames torment him throughout the night. Conjuring it wandless and expecting to control it sounds impossible.
“It’s like a Slytherin reunion in here,” Ginevra says, scrunching up her nose.
“Why do you want to know?”
“You can’t,” Draco says bluntly.
“What did I say about anyone who hurts you?” Harry says, glancing down at Draco’s quivering form.
“Of course you can!” Harry responds, brows rising. Merlin, this bloke sounds like a creep!
He hadn’t meant to betray Granger. He hadn’t meant to come to Gedeon’s office, frustrated and concerned over the direction of their failures with the test subjects. He hadn’t meant to consume so much of Gedeon’s bourbon.
James quietly appears.
“I am,” he says hurriedly. “Very safe and consensual!”
“Rodrigo, meet Draco Malfoy, my partner in crime,” Pansy says with a wink. “Draco, Rodrigo is my absolute favourite artist.”
“Pansy, I love you to death but please shut up,” Millie huffs, pulling a throw pillow free from behind her to toss in Pansy’s direction. Pansy harrumphs as it lands in her lap.
“Yes, they are, sweetheart,” Draco chuckles, his scowl transforming so quickly into a bright grin that Harry can't help but be in awe of Draco's level of tolerance.
“No, thanks Hannah,” Harry says. Draco purposely avoids Harry’s gaze, but can feel it burning a hole into the side of his face. Hannah looks surprised, but leaves them to it.
“I wouldn’t call that omnishambles of a night a simple disagreement. It was more like harassment and gaslighting,” Draco snaps, flat out ignoring Blaise’s question.
Draco freezes, nearly dropping the shot Blaise hands him, he quickly recovers but Pansy’s eyes narrow at him. Draco hastily downs the shot for a distraction, but on the inside, he’s slowly burning to death with rage.
“Auror Castor,” Potter mutters.
Draco slips his hand into the left pocket of his coat. He pulls out the letter Harry first sent a year after his break up with Ginevra. The white of the envelope has dulled with time, the edges worn and puffy from the number of times Draco’s read the letter. He passes it to Harry with care, watching a multitude of emotions across Harry’s face, from warmth to sadness.
Potter looks rattled. “Draco—”
Draco follows beside him. “I have no idea what any of that means.”
“Oh, fuck off. I’m only four years older than her. Plus, she’s mature for her age.”
Pansy coos and leans forward to pet it. “Oh, Draco!” she starts, her face lighting up with mirth as she glances up at him. “You can squeeze through the doggy door, you’re whippet-thin.”
Theo is pulled back and thrown against Draco’s fridge. Potter, looking ready to commit murder, stands between them. At his wit’s end, Draco sinks onto the floor, another gross reminder of that night with Pansy, his hands covering his face.
Draco has to control the surprise that threatens to seep into his words. He clears his throat. “Clever man. Have you learned anything interesting about people through this method?” he drawls.
,” she whimpers.
“What do you mean— ‘she was more interested in the Dark Lord?’”
They had been happy, happier than they’d been in years, especially after losing Father his first week in Azkaban. Mother had enjoyed living in the States, but came back to Magical Britain and the Manor because Draco decided he wanted his Healer qualifications. It had been a normal evening in the West End. His mother enjoyed travelling out to Muggle London on the weekends for a late dinner, after all, they lived a mostly Muggle life in Boston. It had been dark and they were laughing, peering at displays in darkened shop windows, vowing to come back the next day for this item or that. Draco noticed the man too late; they were already on an empty, narrow side street off the high road when the barrel of a gun was shoved in Draco’s face.
“Oh, Padma,” Potter says sadly. “I
Harry freezes. It’s not true. He cries. All the time.
“What is it, Gin?” At his question her face flushes and he raises a quizzical brow. Merlin. She’s bloody
Draco focuses on the purple. He falls asleep, imagining himself draped in purple sheets that smell of honey.
Downing half the glass, the banging on his front door doesn’t relent. Annoyed, he scrambles out of bed and makes his way down the stairs to the front door, only swaying a few times as he rounded corners. Swinging it open he finds Dean leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed against his chest, a small smile on his face. Harry immediately perks up, adrenaline racing through his blood at the sight of him. The streetlight makes Dean’s brown complexion glow, the shadows playing over his sharp face stirring something deep and primal inside of Harry.
Draco swallows a painful lump that’s lodged itself in his throat as he stares at Potter. The fact that he’s a
“May I sit beside you?” Harry asks. Draco sniffs but nods quickly. He perches about an arms-length away from the other man, and then roots around in his trouser pocket to pull out a relatively clean Kleenex. He hands it over to Draco. It’s a testament to the level of Draco’s grief that he doesn’t even blink at the less than clean tissue, instead grabbing it to blow his nose.
“Pa—”
He snorts and moves to pour another glass. “A seer, now? Tell me, O Great, All-Seeing and Knowing Pansy, why am I here?”
"We’re supposed to bring this person to
Draco’s grin is wide, and a wild surge of energy rushes through him as he wraps his arms around Harry, tugging him over his body. Draco laughs as they lightly wrestle, Harry between his legs and one of Draco’s wrists in Harry’s hands, the other trapped between their chests. Draco’s cock begins to fill again as Harry kisses him deeply.
Parkinson arrives back into the massive lounge room cradling the open bottle of prosecco and drapes herself across the chesterfield. “Merlin’s beard, Draco, it’s 4am, do we really need to start with the muggle music?”
“Yes,” Draco says slowly. “Brilliant!” he cries, jumping up and punching a fist into the air.
“Why do you care?” Draco snaps. “You’re doing just fine with your famous date. I’m doing fine without avoiding mine. What are you worried about me for?”
Granger then sticks her hand out, a fiery look of determination on her face. Cocky, and yet still a bit intimidated by his partner, Draco smirks before grasping it.
“Alright, Malfoy?” the Slytherin—Jacobs?—asks, warily eyeing Harry.
Draco.”
“Oh, thank Merlin, I mean...Yes! Later, please,” Ginny says with a sigh of relief. “Bye-bye!” she says before hanging up.
The door clicks shut behind them.
“You’re an idiot, Nott,” Pansy grouses with a flat look. “I thought Millie said to avoid the kitchens!”
The officer gives Draco a sympathetic glance before looking back at Potter. “I’m afraid not, sir. There’s rumours the branch out in West Yorkshire is developing some sort of digital system, but it’s not out yet.”
“Yeah.”
” He throws his blanket off and scrambles to his feet, shoving a relatively clean t-shirt over his head before taking the stairs two at a time to get to the sitting room. “Shut the
show his face at such a large, rowdy event.
Harry bobs his head a few times and sets his danish down. “Yeah, so, Ron’s still an Auror, Deputy Head Auror, actually, and was kind enough to slip me your work address as apparently that’s accessible information for employment checks for parolees and such. But er, he drew the line at your place of residence for ethical and legal reasons, of course.”
Potter presses a soft kiss to his temple, muttering words of encouragement and praise. Draco has never felt so tattered, so utterly exhausted before in his life—but he did it.
“Enjoying the party, Draco?” she asks, a look of boredom on her face in a way that would give Pansy’s a run for its Galleons.
And fuck my burning hope,
“I’ll fucking kill you! I’ll fucking kill you, Smith!” Harry howls, the sound so bone-chilling that Smith spins on his heel to face Harry.
doorstep?” Ginny snaps, her brown eyes burning.
Miraculously, they bounced back from that awkward experience and remained close friends.
Draco is shocked to find that the beer garden is packed with all sorts of people, but mostly Slytherins.
“Like sex on legs, isn’t he?” pants a familiar husky voice against his ear. The breath ghosts over the shell of his ear and he shivers. Harry reluctantly cuts his eyes away from Malfoy to the person standing beside him. Dressed in a skin-tight leather crop top, an equally tight black leather miniskirt, leather thigh high boots, and black lipstick topping the look, is Pansy Parkinson. She smiles her poisonous smile at him, looking every inch like a dominatrix in her getup. “Oh, don’t stop staring on my account, Potter. I was rather enjoying the show myself,” she leers. Harry doesn’t know if she’s talking about
Pansy runs her short, green, stiletto-tipped fingers through Draco’s hair, pushing the slightly overlong strands back from his face. Draco yearns for her little touches. She’s the only one out of their little trio who holds his hand, brushes his hair back, and kisses his cheek without a second thought. Blaise navigates touching like he navigates everything—with careful calculation. He’s the type that weighs the meaning of a touch before he executes it.
“I don’t object to any of your things,” Pansy says, pointing to the oblong glass case of antique snitches Ginny’s been collecting for the last five years. Pansy’s placed it on one of the shelves of their enormous bookcase.
“Don’t you still love me?” she asks as she lowers her hands, her voice so broken that Harry bites back a commiserating whimper.
, Malfoy?” Jordan mutters darkly. Draco’s brows knit together as he tries to recall if he’s said more than two words to this man in his entire life.
“But I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I’ve been—I’ve been so
Harry draws in a sharp breath, his heart clenching as memories flood his mind’s eye of that terrible night in the girl’s loo. He shivers. “What’s the statute of limitations on apologies?” he asks softly, watching that little smile on Malfoy’s face fall. “I didn’t know what that spell would do, and I’m so sorry for using it on you.”

“Yes.”
Draco swallows. Having Andrews catch him like this makes Draco want to shrivel up and die. “What do you want?”

Draco hisses before Andrews’s grip tightens and he slams Draco’s face into the table before him.
Draco snaps. “You can’t release all the details...you’ll get everyone murdered!”
to go.”
But Draco’s heart doesn’t clench until his gaze finally falls on Harry, standing tall in his Auror regalia at the massive entrance of the ballroom. A hot, irrational flare of shame rips through him, and for a horrifying moment he believes he’s about to faint, each step becoming more laboured. When they approach, Harry’s hands reach out for him. As Gibbons let’s go of him, Andrews grabs him up.
He didn’t love
at me.” He continues to ignore her, instead concentrating on his breathing, willing the air to go in and out of his body smoothly. The burning in the back of his throat is nearly unbearable, but he’ll be damned if he starts sobbing again. She pushes her chair back and stands. His gaze is still obediently fixed on his plate but he can feel the heat of her gaze and body next to him. “I understand that you may not forgive me for this right now, but I hope that the man I’ve come to know, love, and respect will come around for me.” The determination in her voice is unwavering, even through her tears. She leans forward and runs her warm fingertips down his cheek. He closes his eyes against the simple, soft touch. It’s a touch that he’s so very fond of, and realising that this may be the last time he feels it just fucking
“Why, Potter, how very Slytherin of you,” Draco quips. “Yes. I’ll help you with your little case.”
The frost has yet to shake from the bare trees when Draco decides to cut his hair.
Once they reach the concrete entryway of the Love Chamber, Potter voices his concern over the security measure taken to enter.

~*~*~*~*~*~
“No, Potter. I
“Oh. It’s just, well, you two seemed friendly, is all.”
“I’m not sure how wise it’ll be to have vampires mingle with humans at Gringotts, Hermione,” he says, laughing harder as she shoots him a fondly impatient look.
“Will this require trousers?” Draco asks, pointedly staring at Harry’s lap.
“I know nothing about Harry’s death beyond what the Medical Examiner told me!” she shouts, tears forming at the corner of her eyes again. “He died saving a family from a string of arson burglaries. He died a hero!”
Harry doesn’t say anything at all at his surprisingly honest revelation. He feels sorry that Malfoy felt like he needed to run away, but Harry’s sure if the roles were reversed, he’d have run away, too. Hell, hasn’t he been trying to? Run away from the expectations of the wizarding world, runaway from the public’s opinion that he should be an Auror, married to Ginny, and living a very publicly accessible life. He actually finds himself holding his breath as Malfoy continues, finding with each moment that passes between them, a shared common desire.
He’s able to grasp at one single thought, but it’s a struggle as he tries to calm down enough to pluck it from the flood of a thousand. He needs a dose of his Draught of Peace, which he knows is risky to mix with alcohol, but worth it. He needs to leave. Now. Draco drops his hands to his side and opens his eyes, stumbling back from the mirror and towards the door, pulling it open. The rush of cool air and music washes over him, drowning out a bit of the chaos in his head. He counts his steps through the hallway to maintain focus, desperate to remain unnoticed in the crowd. He can’t imagine using magic right now with his head buzzing and his hands shaking. He’d likely miscast. He rounds the bar where Mia is serving a crowd of people, a bottle in her hand flying over glasses as she laughs and gestures with the other.
“I know. If you let me, Draco, I’ll be here for you.”
It’s bloody Malfoy.
He hasn’t been able to cast a Patronus in years. The need to cast one now is strong, but the fear that he won’t be able to produce a corporeal one is stronger. What would that mean, if he’s still unable to? Severus taught Draco how to conjure one by focusing on all the love he has for his family, and for Severus himself. When his godfather died, and his family life deteriorated, Draco was no longer able to produce one.
Granger nods.
Did the Agnelli family
happened in here?” she nearly shouts, spinning around to stare at him. Her eyes follow him stepping carefully into the lounge and avoiding the mess of debris scattered across the wooden floors. He sighs.
A double-decker veers off the Museum of London’s rotunda to speed down Aldersgate street so sharply that Draco nearly trips as he jolts back from the curb. Balanced on one foot, a hand flies to the base of his neck in shock as he swallows down a startled yelp—
He’s petrified.
“You’re an arse. Not only are you wandlessly tossing your magic about, but you also have to own a gorgeous cock,” Draco says dryly, but his mouth is suddenly filling with saliva as he breathes in the heady scent of Harry’s sex. Draco’s dazed. Touching Harry like this sends a shot of want through him, so strong that he whimpers, his hand tightening around Harry as he strokes him.
“That’s exactly what I said,” Draco chuckles. Mia grabs three shots off a nearby floating tray and passes them around. She holds her glass out.
“I wouldn’t miss little Rose’s party for the world,” he responds.
“Draco, you’re only 25…” Harry says with a hint of amusement. “You’re nowhere near old age and believe it or not, you’re a bloody catch. You’re definitely not going to die alone.”
“That’s it? You accuse me of not doing enough to save our son and then tell me to fuck off?”
“Zach!” They all turn to face Hannah, her face thunderous. “What have I told you about coming into my place pissed out of your mind like this? I don’t want you fighting with anyone or I’ll bloody kick you out! Now you lot disperse!” she snaps, snatching up a glass and walking away. Smith lowers his wand before turning to face his friends with a nod. Some unspoken communication occurs as the three of them walk off, pints in hand, to the other side of the pub where the darts are.
He steps closer to Malfoy, feeling a bit more confident. He begins to move in earnest, letting go and just enjoying himself. All his anxieties seem to melt away, and Malfoy drops his hands from Harry’s hips. He lifts his hands to rest lightly on Malfoy’s shoulders while rolling his body against Malfoy’s as the song shifts to a faster-paced beat.
. Laughing about their crimes just because it’s targeting rich Purebloods offers no relief to us. They’re still a criminal that needs to be stopped before things escalate—”
And then he catches a flash of red and loses his breath once again. Smith is sitting on a stool beside Potter, both facing away from Draco. Smith is laughing, leaning into Potter’s personal space, gesticulating wildly. Potter doesn’t even appear to be all too interested, but he does nod several times before guzzling down a fresh pint. Smith turns to look at Draco.
“You know something, Granger.”
Saturday nights out in Diagon were usually reason enough to dress up, but Draco wanted comfort over anything else tonight. He donned fitted black trousers, a simple black button down, and black bow tie.
Draco narrows his eyes, not understanding what Harry is missing here—this is what Harry

“Well, he’s never been a looker,” Draco scoffs, then muttering something about a giraffe, peering back at the room the couple disappeared into.
“Don’t hold out on me, Potter. I shared my gelato.” Harry scoffs, half a scoop does not qualify as sharing, he thinks as he eyes Draco’s now empty bowl.
I still want you to come
Harry’s hand flies to his chest where a sharp twist like a knife causes him to lose his breath.
When Harry doesn’t respond, Draco keeps going. “I’m a fucking degenerate, someone on their way to becoming a drug addict, someone who allows himself to be used for the twisted sexual entertainment of others. I’m a liar and…”
“Ah, there’s the confirmation of your condescending self-righteousness that I’ve been waiting for since you landed in my room, Potter,” Draco says, stopping in front of a simple black door with a small plaque that reads 909 on it. “Even in death you’re an unmitigated arsehole.” Before Potter can respond, Draco knocks on the door.
Harry kisses his cheek. “I’m okay. If anything changes—

He sits on the edge of the tub and presses two fingers against the smooth, puckered, pale pink wound. It eases the throbbing.

A withering look from Hermione during ordering had put him off wanting a double cheeseburger with bacon. Fuck. He was so
Draco barks a laugh. “The compliments.”
“I stole that dossier from Edward Flint’s house during one of my break-ins. I have photographic proof of the actual theft!” Draco says smugly, thinking about the images Andrews had hung in Draco’s home office the night he broke into his townhouse.
“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking tonight,” Harry says.
He recalls that very first time he ran into Malfoy in the muggle world at
Harry’s hand creeps under Draco’s leg to hold Draco’s hip down, so hot that it’s almost too much against the sensitive skin over Draco’s hip bone. Harry mouths along Draco’s sac so tenderly that Draco bites back a whimper, crushing his eyes closed.
Draco squints at Potter, wondering if the man is drunk. “Let. Them. Win?” Draco asks haltingly. “Were you not the one to win this war against people like me, Potter? They’re well within their right to do and say whatever the hell they want to me!
“I’ll see you all at the Annual Shafiq Quidditch match,” Blaise says dismissively, his eyes hard. With a final scornful look around the room, he glides out as an elf pops up to lead him to the Apparition room.
“I’m not crazy,” Malfoy says, falling onto his back with a loud, dramatic huff, his glass of prosecco now empty and rolling across the floor.
Draco growls before pulling Harry towards him, ignoring the sharp yelp of surprise Harry makes, to crush their lips together in a bruising, filthy kiss. “Merlin, you’re so bloody hot. I can’t wait to get you in bed after we handle this,” Draco says against Harry’s lips. When he pulls back, Harry is slightly dazed.
Harry shrugs. “As I’ve said before, the Ministry in and of itself is still grossly corrupt and adheres to poisonous, unjust hierarchical bollocks. Remember, I refuse to put my faith in any set system. But I’m party to their system, and among only a few in the Auror Department trying to change things for the better. Hermione is also trying to change things in her department and Ron in his,” Harry says, looking back up at the ceiling, his expression dark.
on the other man. It’s different to Harry now because he’s still
“How was what?”
Blaise had recommended Pansy to mentor Bitty despite Draco’s attempts to dissuade his decision. Of the prominent Pureblood families with women out in society, Daphne had already promised herself to Astoria, Millicent refused to be anyone’s mentor (but also her family didn’t have the desirable lure or political pull, being a half-blood herself). The Shafiqs were also unavailable, along with the Shacklebolts, the Flints, the Selwyns, Fawleys, what’s left of the Rowles. And even the Muggle-loving Abbotts were promised to other debs or were simply too afraid to take on Pureblood society’s current reigning queen.
Draco glances up, catching Harry’s amused smile before he scrubs his face in disbelief.
“Bloody hell, I think I’m coming down with something,” he groans, suddenly feeling ill.
Harry shifts in his seat. He’s uncomfortable with the idea of outright dismissing any concern or want Teddy may have. “You just said he wasn't a baby. I think we can trust him on this, Draco. We just can’t go around ignoring an outcry.”
“Yes. Thank you,” he says thinly, averting his gaze down to the folder. She makes a move towards the Floo and he starts. “Hermione!” he calls out. She faces him once more. “Don’t…let’s not mention this to Potter, shall we?”
Draco drains the rest of his beer. “Must be nice.”
To his surprise and relief, the mob of people slowly begin to disperse with looks of shock and betrayal on their faces. He could hardly be bothered to care about their dejected feelings as he removes the protective shield to once again assess Malfoy’s injuries.
The ache in Draco’s stomach flares at the very thought, and Draco cries out, gripping his own hair. Blaise tries to unwork his grip, but Draco squeezes so tightly that he can feel strands rip free from his scalp, anything to distract him from the gnawing.
This is Draco’s worst nightmare realised, utterly helpless in the face of Smith’s wrath. Draco’s an idiot, a fucking
Draco wakes with a pained groan.
Draco shakes his head, suddenly feeling frustrated and confused. Missing memories aside, Draco can hardly entertain the idea that he and Potter were as friendly as people seem to believe they were, it just doesn’t make sense. Potter also looks bemused.
pretend and I already told you that I’ve never faked anything with you, nor will I ever. You must understand that I can’t just turn off what I’m feeling. I can’t do that to be with you. Not ever.” She wipes her tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand.
I promise you, this will pass.”
“You’re making a huge mistake with that one, my boy. A massive one. I don’t think I like this side of you very much.”
Another year morphed into two in Norway. Draco found his footing in Bergen by then as his flatmate moved on. Harry stopped writing around that time, which Draco expected due to his lack of response, but still selfishly felt anger towards when faced with its bitter absence. Draco hadn’t meant for so much time to escape him.
“And priceless art, clothing, and…everything in between.” Harry runs a hand through his hair again. “Look, you’re probably going to hear about this detail from the Chief Prosecutor anyway, but, whoever is doing this is also stealing family heirlooms, really
Draco shudders. “Nothing worth reminiscing.”

“No,” he says gruffly but firmly once his sobs have quieted. “I just love you so, so much, Harry.” Harry – and
At this Andrews shrugs. “We don’t mingle with No-Maj-born where I come from. Dunno why you even bother with them here, to be honest.”
“Luna and Millicent will be staying at the Burrow tonight, so I will be in their room if you need me. Are you comfortable?” Padma asks.
“It’s okay, you can tell me,” Harry says softly.
“Terribly,” Malfoy says, frustrated. “She won’t stop whingeing about redecorating! Bart and I
He doesn’t question the spark of excitement that shoots through him...not even as he admits to himself that he’s about to fall down a Draco Malfoy-shaped hole.
would Potter do this? How could he push along Draco’s file without asking for his permission first? He’s been so busy trying not to fall apart because of the assault it hasn’t crossed his mind what he would do if his case went to court. He feels as if he’s been tricked into standing above a trap door, noticing much too late he’s going to go crashing to his doom, and Potter’s the one who has tricked him into standing there. Hot, frustrated tears begin to fall down his cheeks.
“Never,” Padma whispers back. “Off you go. Remember, I am in the next room if you need me.”

“I want you inside of me,” Draco whispers, cupping Harry’s cheek as Harry's chest swells with a long, heavy inhale. Harry’s hands tighten on Draco’s knees, the air suddenly charged with Harry’s magic. Draco moans, his hand sliding away from Harry’s face to fall onto the bed as his head lolls back. The magic is a gentle caress of appreciation down the middle of Draco’s back, a littering of soft promises of care across his shoulder, a low, throbbing hum that seeks to fulfill, to honour, and above all else, to

Instead of responding, Harry’s hands slide off from Draco’s knees and he eases himself beside Draco, slumping against the wall, a look of exhaustion on his face. Harry tilts his head up to stare at the ceiling, and Draco watches as his Adam's apple bob when he swallows.
Potter nods. “I love you,” he says. “I promise to do better.”

“A joy, as always. Ron’s certain Teddy’s going to be a better chess player than him one of these days,” Hermione says, tucking a wayward curl that’s escaped from her bun behind her ear. She looks a bit troubled, but before Harry can ask what’s wrong, she asks, “How was your date night?”
“Er—” Harry protests.
Draco can tell that Potter is all teeming energy confined within an outwardly rigid body; he’s almost sure now that this is Potter’s magic. He can practically taste it on his tongue, thick and sweet like honey. That looming, terrifying presence from before is absent.

Today is the 15th of July.
“Remember when you used to love this selfish bitch?”
I feel it. I feel it here,” Harry says, placing a hand over his heart. “I felt it the moment I landed in your room. I felt it with every step I took beside you, around me, and every moment I shared with you where I saw you peeking from behind the curtain of your pain and grief. I felt it when we touched, when we made love. I love you, too, Draco, now and forever. From beyond the Veil,” Harry says gently. “I will always be there for you.”
“You are both up early,” Padma notes before pursing her lips.
Harry tosses his empty hand up in the air. “Fine, okay. Can I at least get up?”
Harry was too young then. They were both too painfully young.
Draco leans in at the same time as Harry, who moves too quickly, his glasses bumping against Draco’s nose.

Confused, Draco places his mug down. “Alright.” Draco rolls his shoulders, feeling slightly warm. He tugs his jumper down a bit.

“No,” Draco says, shaking his head. “Just stay right there.”
Harry’s excitable magic wraps around Draco like a warm blanket, cocooning him as the kiss deepens. Draco’s free hand finds its way to the nape of Harry’s neck, his fingers twisting around the long strands as a low moan escapes the back of his throat, the kiss growing hungrier, Harry now pressing him into the sofa. Draco doesn’t care that small, shameless moans have escaped the back of his throat as they kiss, his chest heaving as he tries to press their bodies together, as close as physically possible. He’s just starting to grow hard when Harry’s wards ring for what sounds like someone at the Floo.

Draco is now near the fireplace, quivering like a leaf as he tosses his snapped wand into the fire, his eyes wide with fear as he lowers his hands, his chest rapidly rising and falling.

it, and if Potter is willing to join him for the ride then Draco needs to know he can rely on him. He hums approvingly. “Let’s go back to the party,” he says softly, leaning in to kiss Potter’s cheek. He takes Potter’s trembling hand in his and it feels like things have shifted and slotted together. It feels like growth.
“Oh,” Harry starts, rubbing his chin. They always talk about their dates. “Okay, it was just horrid, s’all.” He watches as Draco coolly leans back in his seat, a brow lifting and that horrid expression slipping from his face. Harry immediately feels a sense of relief now that it’s gone.
Potter stands slowly from his seat and crosses the kitchen to where Draco’s leaning against the counter. “May I hug you?” he asks in a voice barely above a whisper, strained with unchecked emotion. Draco gives a jerky nod and Potter scoops him up into a careful embrace, his shaky hands cupping the back of his head as he cradles him. He sways slightly, a soft rhythmic kind of rocking that both lulls Draco and makes him feel an all-encompassing sadness. Potter’s fingers run through Draco’s hair. “I’m so, so sorry, Draco. I-I can’t
“Have you checked out that list of charities I sent you?” Hermione asks.
He walks over to the table in the middle of the room. From Draco’s position, he can see a number of pictures spread out on the surface. “You Brits like to bottle up all of what you see for your Pensieves. Makes for tricky business if you ask me. People’s memories are fickle and often skewed in some way. Nah, I much rather prefer taking pictures. Muggle pictures. What you see is what you get. I know you’re very familiar with my work.”
that goes on in
He assures everyone it’s because he’s incredibly busy. Pansy knows better, but she’s kept his secret despite all her unanswered owls piling up in his letter box.
A part of him knows he’s being irrational, selfish, even, but Draco’s afraid it’ll hurt, it’ll hurt too much to
“I would recommend it, otherwise this man might very well overpower you,” Draco drawls as the Auror nearly loses his grip on the man’s leg.
Pansy refused to let Draco live alone in the Manor, and she refused to move into the Manor with Daphne, loving her dilapidated house too much to let it go. Draco, afraid he’d kill himself if left to his own devices, eventually agreed to move into Parkinson House.
Harry looked enraged, he half expected Harry to stun him and leave him there helpless for hours like
But he knew it could never be, he reflected, staring blankly at the sleeping figure next to him. Could never bring himself to. The silver band began to feel too tight around his finger as he fell deeper into regret.
“Did you just come untouched?” Harry licked his lips in amusement. Draco covered his face. Harry chuckled. “don't feel embarrassed. I find it incredibly hot that you're so sensitive,” Harry removed Draco's knickers all the way and dropped them to the floor. He began rocking their hips together. “Do you think you can come again?” a pleased smile crept on Harry's lips when he saw Draco harden once more.
Draco was positively screaming and sobbing now, nails clawing at his back and without a doubt leaving promiscuous marks on him. Harry didn't mind, he thought, as he looked down at his own marks he made all over Draco. The bed creaked violently and slammed against the wall. And a treacherous part of Harry hoped that
The question startled a laugh out of Draco. He placed a hand over his mouth in disbelief. “Amazing. Thank you,” he sighed, his hand then coming up to tread through Harry's ink coloured locks. “I haven't orgasmed that hard in so long.” he joked.
Harry's presence made the whole house even more suffocating. Strengthened the urge to break away free from this desolate wedlock.
“Enough bullshit for me to know you couldn't be happy being tied to someone like that,” Desperately, he looked for the words to get out of the corner Harry has pushed him into. Draco must have let the silence stretch too long and confirmed his statement. “and just now, you we're thinking of running away. Weren't you?”
Harry nodded and rasped out. “Okay.” then he parted Draco's cheeks with his hands and licked at the middle. Draco keened in surprise and gripped his hair tightly in one hand, while Harry expertly prodded at his hole using his tongue. Draco's hips lifted up, his heels going to dig at Harry's shoulder blades. Harry kneaded at his thighs.
“I want to hear you.” Harry muttered against Draco's thigh. Draco sucked in a sharp breath before moving his hand away, releasing pretty little noises as Harry's fingers began to prod inside him. He shook his head.
“I'm not going to stop you. If that's what you want to do,” Draco took a gasping breath when Harry decided to crowd him against the counter, as if cornering him metaphorically wasn't enough for him. He clutched at Harry's shirt. “I can pretend to be clueless for you. But Draco. . . I want you to know that you don't have to live hiding from him.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, please, I want to — fuck, it feels so good.” his face was flushed red as he pleaded. “can you please put your cock in me now?”
“so bad.” he gasped against Harry's lips, whispering a hopeful, “fuck me.”
They settled on languid kisses and casual rubbing for a few minutes, simply familiarizing themselves with each other. Until Harry moved away from his lips and took one of the pillows before placing it under Draco's hips. His lips moved downwards to his chest, placing tender kisses on Draco's stomach and then finally settling in between his legs.
Being under the sheets and sleeping beside him have always felt suffocating to Draco.
“What was the subject again? Ah, right.” Harry crashed his lips on Draco's, eager and harsh. A hand on his neck and an arm around his waist before there was the dull crack of apparition and the next thing he knew, he was lying on his back with a soft bed under him, and Harry attacking his lips above him.
Draco thought this was Heaven on earth, as he clenched down greedily. His own cock pulsing on his belly as Harry worked his way into him. But he felt so full and he wanted to come untouched on Harry's cock alone.
“Jesus. . .” he squeezed his eyes shut, feeling at the soft skin underneath. Draco wore lingerie. Most likely more often than he knew. Harry didn't know what to do with that information aside from coming in his pants like a teenager. He bit Draco's already swollen-red lips open, licking into his tongue.
Draco sat in the dining table with Jacques, a cup of tea in his hand, a heaviness in his heart, dread in the pit of his stomach.
were projecting,” the retort slipped before he could stop himself. Not the smartest comeback he could think of. He quickly added. “I was just calling you out on it.”
“But why?” he glowered at him. “is your saviour radar going off at my expense? Is saving poor blokes in miserable marriages a new hobby you've picked up? Why do you care so much?”
Draco didn't trust his voice to not betray him, so he denied it with a fervent shake of his head.
“I want you to finally run away, Draco,” Harry said. “run to me. But what matters to me is what
“W-what do you mean?” he thought he ought to have said something smarter, but his mind had been rendered fuzzy from the kiss and he wanted more, his eyes kept following the movement of Harry's lips and how the man kept squeezing at his sides.
. Shown off at grand events like a particularly expensive watch, a silent way to convey,
“Do you really not remember?”
In one swift movement, Harry had Draco perched on top of the kitchen counter, his warm hands sneaking under his shirt and roaming his back. The cold surface biting the bare skin of his thighs, reminding him that he was wearing nothing other than a shirt and his underwear. Harry pulled away first.
Draco didn't want to start crying again, so he pulled Harry in for another kiss. Greedily breathing him in as if he was going to disappear into thin air soon and leave him alone the in confines of this godforsaken house. As if he was nothing more than a mirage, a fantasy Draco managed to create in his head. He never wanted to be separated from him again.
he thought as he dragged Harry closer by hooking his arms around to back of his neck and crashed their lips together. Harry's response was immediate and eager by licking Draco's lips open before securing his arms around his waist. Draco tangled his fingers in Harry's hair, a series of needy whimpers escaping his lips when Harry's sturdy form pressed closer against him.
A weak sigh slipped past his lips and he curled tightly to himself, desperately seeking for the lost sense of comfort he was promised since the day of their marriage. The warmth and the feeling of contentment he should feel in their own bedroom, pressed against the heat of his husband's body beside him.
“Just another mark in my reputation that's already been marred, nothing new. I don't care.”
Something about the furtiveness of this situation set fire to Harry's blood. The fact that Draco wore his shirt, his knickers were halfway through his calves, and his svelte legs were perched over Harry's shoulders — Harry squeezed at his own hardness.
“I do.”
Harry leaned against the counter, eyes attentive and earnest. In all his magnetic glory, Draco was drawn to him. Always had been, and he hated it. Hated how so badly he wanted to lean closer to the warmth that was so familiar, yet so far away. Look into those green eyes up close and press his lips against his — and drown in it. Draco felt dizzy at the image.
His husband whom Harry knew and loved first. And now Harry has come back to take what was supposed to be his all along. Harry got him. Harry has no intention of ever letting Draco slip from his grasp ever again.
It was a large blue shirt, and it smelled like Harry, so. Draco said nothing and wasted no time in pulling his own sweat ridden shirt off then slipped Harry's shirt on, giving it a satisfied sniff. Then he was being pushed back to bed, Harry making him hold the hem of the shirt up to his chest as he began to assault Draco's nipples with his tongue and his fingers.
But who would've thought Harry Potter would ever catch him having a mental breakdown on a sink once again.
“Shut up,” Draco clenched his fists, brows furrowed in offense. “how can you say that? Every single day, in these last five years are little mistakes born from the biggest one I've made all those years ago. Wanting to be with you is not a mistake,” his voice threatened to break. “this is me finally trying to do what's right,” he inhaled shakily before swallowing. “even if it's just for tonight and I'd have to go on the next morning to continue making mistakes. I don't care if I have to take your cock up my ass with his ring on my finger. I don't care if that's
All thought of Jacques were thrown out the window once Harry's hand made its way to his belly and pressed down at the protrusion his cock made.  Draco let his legs fall apart as he came abruptly with a particularly loud cry of Harry's name, coming long and hard.
did, but it never came. He then realized Harry wasn't angry at him. “Fuck what he thinks. Fuck whatever bullshit he tells you,” he wiped at the drying tears on Draco's face. “so what if you were a Death Eater at
Draco remembered that night very well. He had been dosed with an extremely potent Sleeping Draught and only came to at noon the next day with a thundering headache.
There was a flicker of emotion in his eyes, but it was gone too soon before he could discern it. Draco would've paid a fortune to see that smug grin wiped off his face but it never did, much to his annoyance.
. Harry growled and snapped his hips even harder, relishing at the sight of Draco's lashes fluttering and silver eyes rolling upwards. He rolled his hips up to meet Harry's thrusts just as enthusiastically. It suddenly dawned on Harry how deprived and needy Draco was but the realization that startled him was how willing he was to give it to him. Whatever he wanted and whenever he needed it.
