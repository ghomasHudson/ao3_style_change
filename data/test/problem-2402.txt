Harry rolled his eyes and chuckled. “You know that trouble usually finds me. But I’ll try my best.”
A burst of laughter drew Minerva’s attention towards the centre of the room where the memory-version of Liv sat atop a desk, howling at a joke from none other than Nymphadora Tonks. She proceeded to change her hair colour to match the pointed green party hat that her cousin was wearing, making her laugh even more.
A smirk spread across Draco’s face. “Because thanks to that little stunt you and your friends pulled on Halloween, I’m no longer the most hated person in the school. I was sorely tempted to send you a gift basket as a token of my appreciation.”
Draco looked appalled by this.
“Principles won’t mean shit if you’re dead!” she shouted. A stunned silence followed that declaration and Andromeda stared fixedly at her husband, waiting for his response. Ted, however, remained defiant.
Draco frowned. “So despite the Friar’s noble intentions, it was all for naught. Tybalt’s hatred won out in the end and everyone died. What exactly is the point of it all, then?”
“Five-second rule, mate,” he smirked through a mouthful of food. Hermione tsked at her boyfriend's atrocious table manners but said nothing, instead turning her attention back to the school list.
When they finally pulled apart to catch their breath, they still clung to each other as though their lives depended on it, their lips ghosting over each other as they looked up into each other’s eyes for what felt like the first time. Harry had always thought Draco’s eyes were cold like slate, but this close, he could see that they were actually the colour of smoke: grey and full of heat with flecks of green around the edges of the pupil. Draco’s expression, which was normally a mask of indifference, had completely transformed and he looked relaxed, contented even, an easy smile on his bruised lips. Harry resisted the urge to kiss him again and instead, he asked, “How was that for a kiss?”
Draco scrunched his nose at the offering. “What are these?”
exit the hall and make your way to the Hospital Wing. Is that clear?”
Draco raised his wand a little but paused. “I don’t know about this—”
“God, I hope not,” Harry groaned.
Harry pretended to be asleep when Hermione snuck out of the dormitory a little while later, but as soon as the door closed he tossed one of his pillows at Ron’s bed.
“I didn’t say that.”
“It needs to go to the scrappy,” Ron muttered under his breath.
“No problem at all!” Tom assured him, ushering Harry away from the fireplace. “I can only imagine how difficult it must be for you, travelling about without an entourage of reporters and well-wishers on your tail.”
“And what did you say to that?” asked Severus.
Neville nodded. “No worries. Harry, what about you?”
“No.”
“Oh, for the love of—it’s that blasted rat again!” Draco cried, leaping to his feet.
“Don’t patronise me. Professor Tonks,” he replied, nodding towards Liv. “She’s really scraping the barrel if she thinks that sending you over here—to what, befriend me? Give me a little pep talk?—is going to convince me to buy into this bullshit social experiment of hers where everyone can see past their differences and make friends with each other.”
“Oh, brilliant,” said Ron sarcastically as Hermione proceeded to pull out several books, sandwiches and a flask of pumpkin juice from the tiny bag, setting up a workstation on the desk in front of them. While Ron wasn’t entirely happy about the prospect of spending another sunny Sunday afternoon indoors, he was somewhat appeased when Hermione presented him with a large chicken tikka sandwich.
“Then what was it like?” Ron shouted. “First Ginny and Nott, now you and Malfoy? Has everyone lost their minds?!”
Draco gave Harry a searching look. Harry held his breath as Draco reached out, brushing his thumb against Harry’s cheek and threading his fingers through his hair, pulling him closer, and pressed their lips together in a soft kiss. It only lasted a moment, but Draco’s answer was clear. When he broke the kiss, Draco pulled his bag higher up on his shoulder and smiled at Harry.
“Well...no,” Harry admitted, looking sheepish. “When you invited me to rehearse with you I thought that you meant…you know.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, calming himself as best as he could. Finally, he gave Draco a curt nod. “Alright, I’m ready.”
“I know what it’s like to see the people you love die,” Harry pressed on. “I know how it feels to want to hurt those who’ve hurt me and the people that I love most. To be so angry at everyone for being so stupid and blind to what’s in front of their faces that you want to scream at the top of your lungs and lash out. And I know the guilt that eats away at you when you couldn’t protect your loved ones—that you got to live when they didn’t. But after all of that, after everything you’ve done, can you honestly tell me that you feel any better for doing it?”
bush, thank you very much!” Ron shot back. “Believe me, the last thing that I wanted to see was
“How predictable,” Draco muttered, flicking through the pages of his own script to find the scene.
On the pretence that Hermione was feeling poorly and needed to go to bed, the trio wished their friend farewell. However, as they headed back up to the castle, Hermione rubbed her sore jaw and groaned.
“Oh, Harry…”
As Myrtle had listened, she had stopped crying. She gave Harry a hard look. “You’re too nice, you know that? And too forgiving for your own good.”
“You think so?”
“What happened to it?” asked Draco.
“Is there actually anywhere in London that’s
Gnashing his teeth in frustration, Draco stalked out of the classroom only to be met with Harry waiting for him in the corridor.
Minerva had kept a close eye on Potter’s activities over the summer. She had been sorry to hear (through the blasted Prophet, no less) that he and Miss Weasley had parted ways over the summer, although she didn't put much stock in the rumours that the pretty redhead had fallen into the arms of another man. She thought back to the ridiculous stories the Prophet had publicised suggesting Potter and Miss Granger were an item, the reporters wildly off the mark as usual. Minerva would have laughed at the suggestion had it not been so serious; Miss Granger had been hospitalised after an overzealous ‘fan’ of Mr Potter’s had sent Miss Granger bubotuber pus in the owl post. No, Minerva had no time or patience for reporters, especially ones from the Daily Prophet.
"Well, I think it shows a lot of personal growth on your part, Malfoy," Hermione offered kindly.
“Nah, it’s fine,” Ron assured him, checking his reflection in a nearby shop window. “I mean, seeing me isn’t as good as seeing you of course…”
Hermione let out a dry laugh. “Certainly not! I think it’s about time you two learned to study on your own.”
“You look like one of the blokes in Charlie’s dirty magazines,” Ron chipped in.
to take advantage of that.
“A well-written C.V. only says so much about someone’s character,” Minerva argued. “As much as I trust Kingsley, we haven’t had the best experience with Ministry-appointed staff members at this school. It would be naive of me if I didn’t ask why you were leaving a better job for this one.”
“Oh god,” Harry gasped. “Draco,
“Excellent. Now that’s taken effect, I’ll have to—oh for Merlin’s sake, will you lot please quieten down? I will see to you soon enough!” Madam Pomfrey shouted at the canaries but her protests fell on deaf ears. Draco watched as the little birds continued to twitter loudly as they circled the infirmary.
“Maybe it would be easier if we stood,” he suggested, holding Draco’s script out to him. Draco pursed his lips and snatched the script from Harry’s hands.
Luna chuckled and shook her head. “No! Guess again.”
But Draco shook his head. “He knew. The old bastard knew everything else that was going on, there’s no way that he didn’t know about this.”
Harry chuckled and sheathed his sword. “You know, if you read enough books, a hero’s story always turns out the same: he beats the bad guy, finds the treasure, rescues the maiden…”
“I heard word around the office that Yaxley was sending Death Eaters to pick him up,” she explained. “I sent him a Patronus warning him that they were coming. He managed to get out just before they arrived at the cottage.”
Draco clicked his tongue impatiently and marched over to Harry’s changing room, popping his head through the curtain. “What’s taking you so long? You’ve been in here for ages.”
“Urgh, please no more Umbridges!” she cried dramatically to the sky. Ginny and Harry laughed and smiled at each other and it almost felt like the way it used to be, how Harry thought it ought to be, between them. He picked one of the freshly fallen apples from the ground and handed it to Ginny in an unspoken peace offering. She plucked the proffered apple from his hand and took a large bite out of it, humming in satisfaction.
Luna screeched and the entire classroom, including Liv, erupted into fits of laughter. Hermione looked mortified but Luna just smiled dreamily. Liv was impressed with Ginny’s performance as well. She had managed to memorise most of her lines and gave a passionate performance as Romeo.
“I wouldn’t pretend to know what it was like, Neville,” said Hermione gently. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you.”
Of course, that was before the war and before everything had changed. Since his family’s fall from grace, prospective partners were suddenly very hard to come by, and Draco was quietly relieved that any chance of an arranged marriage now seemed to be permanently off of the table. That didn’t, however, mean that he could now take up with whoever he pleased; anyone he took home would be subject to harsh scrutiny from both of his parents. And therein lay another complication: if Harry’s relationship with Draco had been adversarial in the past, that paled in comparison to his dealings with Draco’s father. The hatred between the Potters and Malfoys made the feud between the Capulets and Montagues seem like a playground squabble by comparison.
a chore! How is Harry, anyway? Is anyone plotting to kill him yet? It feels somewhat overdue.”
“Well,” he began slowly. “I must confess that I’ve never been to Muggle London before...I’m not entirely sure where I’m supposed to go.”
“Are you okay?” Hestia asked again, kneeling down beside her. “You didn’t bang your head, did you?”
“You did it on purpose, you wanker!” he shouted.
“Yes, Miss Granger?” she sighed.
“I know,” she sighed, releasing her youngest son from her vice-like grip and dabbing her eyes with a sodden handkerchief. “It’s just...well, it never gets any easier to say goodbye.” She turned her attention to Harry, “Ready to go, dear?”
“That would be putting it mildly,” he muttered. “I mean, it’s better than it used to be, I suppose. It’s not illegal anymore, at least…”
Still, there was no reply. Draco sighed. “Alright. Well...Merry Christmas, I suppose.”
“Yes Draco, your first date!” she said impatiently. “Now, I’m thinking you should take Harry to Madam Puddifoot’s, it’s a very popular haunt for couples, no pun intended. And we’ll need to find something appropriate for you to wear! Is Gladrags Wizardwear still in Hogsmeade? It’s been years since I’ve visited the village…”
The conspicuous absence of one Dennis Creevey frustrated those students who wanted to seek vengeance for the trouble he and his friends had caused. Harry privately thought that suspending him until after the Christmas break had been a smart move on Professor McGonagall’s part, if for no other reason than to save the young Gryffindor from the lynch mob baying for his blood. Considering what he had done, Harry thought Dennis was getting off lightly.
“Why not? Because you don’t deserve it?” Harry took Draco’s silence as the affirmative and asked, “Does my being nice annoy you?”
Draco nodded. “You said it yourself. It was hatred, not love, that determined Romeo and Juliet’s fates—it was unavoidable.”
Reluctantly, he followed Harry out of the bathroom, curious what his boyfriend had planned, despite his protests. His curiosity piqued as they hurried through the winding corridors and up several flights of stairs in the direction of Gryffindor Tower. When they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, Draco presumed that Harry’s idea of making him feel better probably involved getting their kit off, but when they entered the deserted boys’ dormitory, Harry tossed his school bag onto the floor, threw open the trunk at the bottom of his bed, and pulled out his Firebolt.
“I do mind, as a matter of fact,” Harry replied coolly.
“I’d be a lot quicker saying what I need to say if you didn’t keep interrupting me,” he pointed out. Harry took a deep breath before speaking again, “I was just wondering if, well...see, I was reading the script and I got to the part with the um…with you and me, when we uh...” Draco looked increasingly amused as Harry stumbled over his words. Annoyed by his own awkwardness, Harry decided to just cut to the chase, “Act one scene five: have you read it yet?”
“Merlin, you’ve gotten quite sensitive of late, haven’t you?” he teased. “Still smarting from the Weaslette dumping you?”
Liv smiled approvingly at Harry. “An excellent observation. It’s interesting, isn’t it? The play is primarily viewed as a romantic tragedy, but arguably, it is more of a critique on the nature of hatred than of love; as you say, it is hatred, not love, that determines Romeo and Juliet’s fates, as well as that of Mercutio and Tybalt. The atmosphere is set from the very first scene; the hatred that the Capulets and Montagues feel for each other predicts the outcome of future events in the play, and it is this hatred that ultimately leads to Romeo and Juliet’s demise.”
“I don’t want to get hurt either.”
“Sir Nick,” Harry greeted the ghost as he rose to his feet. “You’re looking for me?”
Harry shook his head. “Everyone’s to report to the Hospital Wing. If anyone can fix this, it’s Madam Pomfrey.”
Draco shrugged. “Plus, the worse you look, the better I appear, so that’s always a bonus.”
“Muggle Studies is a soft subject for soft minds and I don’t intend to waste another second of my life on it,” he tossed the script onto Liv’s desk. “So you can take your script and your subject and stick it up your arse.”
“Hello, Harry,” she sighed. “I suppose you better come in.”
Harry gave Hermione an appreciative smile. “That’s really thoughtful of you. Thanks.”
“So do I,” she countered stiffly.
“Saving the world, I know,” she sighed. “Well since you asked, I’ve been doing quite well. I’ve recently taken up residence in a new toilet.”
“Neither of which is our fault,” Ron argued.
“Yeah, you too,” said Harry. “How’ve you been?”
“Would you like some remedial Defence lessons as well?” he simpered. “I’m going to have to charge you a fee for all the help I’m giving you.”
“Unfortunately not,” he sighed. “What about you?”
Without another word, she stepped off of the train, leaving Draco and Harry staring after her.
Ignoring the retort, Harry chuckled and wiped tears from his eyes. “You must admit, you saying sorry does sound a bit weird. You must have hit your head really hard when you fell.”
Hermione bit her lip. “Oh, that’s a tough one...honestly, I can’t decide. What about you? Do you have a preference?”
Where there was once a sumptuously decorated rococo ceiling of gold leaf was now the handsome, smiling face of Prince William staring down at him. Well, at least he had one friendly face to keep him company for the next fortnight.
“I wouldn’t have lost my temper if you hadn’t been haranguing me,” he snarled.
Harry knew exactly how they were feeling, to have your deepest, darkest secrets laid bare for everyone to speculate over. He thought back to his Occlumency lessons and how invasive they were—and of the power that a Legilimens could wield over another person. Harry had always loved magic, been enchanted by it, even in its most mundane forms. But sometimes, magic frightened him. He had seen first-hand what abusing the power of magic could do—experienced first-hand magic at its darkest and most dreadful. He had even wielded it himself, with devastating results…
“I have something very special to show all of you,” she said excitedly. “Here lies probably Hogwarts’s best-kept secret—”
Dennis scowled at Harry but said nothing, and his silence spoke volumes. Although Harry had never lost a sibling, he knew the pain and guilt of loss better than most. He carried it with him every day; the grief was bad enough. But the guilt...that was far worse than anything else.
“What’s that got to do with me?” asked Harry.
Draco let out a derisive snort and some of the tension in his shoulders eased. “Not bloody likely. I'm the social pariah of the magical world, remember? Even if I am wealthy, suitresses are hardly lining up to marry a gay ex-Death Eater. Which suits me just fine, I’m not the marrying type, anyway.”
“Not only is William Shakespeare considered one of, if not the greatest, Muggle playwrights, he is also perhaps one of the most famous Muggles who ever lived.” Liv tossed the book back onto her desk and turned back to her students. “On that note, I have a special announcement to make, one that I think that you’ll all be happy to hear. Unlike your other classes, there will be no formal written exam for Muggle Studies this year.”
“I’m sure she’ll forgive us,” said Harry, shoving his glasses back onto his face and scooping his discarded script off of the floor. “That wasn’t an empty threat, though; we’ll need to stay on her good side from now on if we want our dinner.”
“But I thought it said...maybe I misread it,” she muttered quietly to herself. Harry watched as the hands with his and Ginny’s faces shifted from ‘In-Transit’ to ‘Home’. He still got a pleasant feeling bubbling at the centre of his chest every time he laid eyes on the clock and saw his face alongside the other Weasleys, but the happiness was immediately marred with sadness at the absence of Fred’s name on the clock. He had always seen the Weasley clan like the family he never had, but when they had added his own hand to the clock, it had meant more to him than he could express in words. They were no longer
Draco looked appalled. “You
“Language, Mr Weasley!” Liv warned.
Harry nodded. “You know that I’ve been here over a week now and nothing crazy has happened yet? No-one’s even tried to kill me, which makes a nice change but it has been kind of boring, if I’m honest.”
Harry wiped the spit off of his mouth with the back of his hand before moving to the centre of the bed. “I did a bit of prep on myself while I was in the shower, but I’m going to need a lot more if we’re going to do this. Do you think it’d be easier if I lay on my front or on my stomach?”
“Tybalt, the reason I have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting. Villain I am none,” he implored. “Therefore...farewell. I see thou know’st me not.”
Neville helped Harry stow his heavy trunk in the overhead luggage rack before they both collapsed onto the empty seats, panting for breath. It was only then that Harry realised that there was another person in the compartment: a small, frail-looking boy with mousy brown hair sat staring out of the window, although he didn’t seem to register the countryside whizzing past in a green blur. Harry realised with an unpleasant jolt that the boy was Dennis Creevey.
Draco hesitated. “So you’re okay keeping things just between the two of us for the time being?”
“Adding spirits to the punch was hardly clever of you, was it Abberley?” Flitwick countered. “You’ve done Ravenclaw a great disservice this evening. You should be ashamed of yourself.”
It may have been a small and childish rebellion, but his options at this point were limited. Hogwarts, loath as he was to admit, was probably his best option. He knew that his mother believed that she was acting in his best interests, but he would have appreciated being consulted in the decision-making process. But then Draco had seldom been consulted about what he really wanted, all the big decisions in his life being made for him. He supposed that he should be used to it by now. That realisation depressed him immensely.
“Well, that was surprisingly fun.” He felt a swooping feeling in his stomach as Draco pushed his windswept hair out of his face and chuckled.
Harry crossed his arms and glowered at Draco. “Alright genius, what’s you’re next suggestion?”
“Yeah, it’s really peaceful,” Harry agreed. “I used to do this a lot, you know. When things got too crazy in school, I’d hop on my broomstick and fly up here just so that I could be on my own for a bit. Up here, nobody can see you or judge you.”
“I can’t lie,” Draco repeated, sounding more distressed. “I tried to lie about the colours of Slytherin house but I couldn’t.”
He had expected Ron to explode then—to throw insults or his pillow at his face, or tell him to piss off. He looked as though he were in two minds about doing all three of those things, but all of the fight seemed to leave him then. Instead, he groaned and covered his face with his hands.
“Oh my,” Hermione sounded slightly alarmed. “He doesn’t look like a happy camper, does he?”
Draco sat next to Harry, hugging the pillow to his chest. “So this is all pretty new to you?”
wanted to stick with Dumbledore’s Army, but everyone else in this school hero-worships Potter like he’s the second coming of Christ. Personally, I think it’s ridiculous, but the majority rule and all that…”
“Well, you won’t believe what Neville and I saw when we were in my back garden on the Winter Solstice,” she began.
“He’s got more than friendship on his mind,” he said darkly. “You better have a word with your mate about this.”
“Certainly,” he preened. “Looks like Potter could do with all the help that he can get.”
Dean and Jack shouted in protest as an oversized t-shirt sprang from the tip of her wand and forced itself over the heads of the bickering pair. With only one hole for both of their heads to poke out of, they were forced to stand in uncomfortably close proximity to one another, and were now limited to using one hand each. The front of the t-shirt bore the message ‘THIS IS OUR GET ALONG SHIRT’, and no matter how hard they tried to remove the item of clothing, it seemed to be stuck in place. The rest of the class laughed as Liv stowed her wand back into its holster and put her hands on her hips.
Rather than venture into the dangerous territory of her student’s love lives, Liv downed her drink and hurried to the bar to get them another pint. The rest of the afternoon passed in a pleasant blur as she and Hestia chatted about everything and anything; they had an in-depth discussion about Tolkien’s work, namely whether or not Bilbo Baggins was a reliable narrator (“Given his propensity to embellish events, I think most of the events were greatly exaggerated,” Liv argued). They also discussed the curious similarities between the power of The One Ring and that of Horcruxes (“I’m still convinced Tolkien was a wizard!” declared Hestia after their third pint).
“Fine. Yes, all of the time,” Harry grudgingly relented. “But I don’t care about that anymore. I’m tired, Ron. I’m sick of fighting with everyone, even with Draco—especially with him. I’ve had enough of fighting with him over stupid, pointless things like house rivalries and Quidditch cups; for years, we engaged in a constant game of oneupmanship over each other, and for what?”
“No, not in the Wizarding world, at least,” she replied slowly. “Is it a problem in the Muggle world?”
“Don’t put words into my mouth, Potter,” Draco teased. “But yes...I suppose that we are friends.”
“Merlin’s beard! Are you alright?”
“Hestia,” Liv motioned for the woman to take one of the chairs in the front row of the classroom while she slipped back into her own seat. “What can I do for you?”
“So, you don’t have a problem with it then?” asked Draco cautiously.
“Not quite, Ma’am,” Draco replied, smirking at the shocked expression on Professor McGonagall’s face.
“Not enough, I’d argue,” Hermione muttered. “Where’s the rest of the costume?”
Harry groaned and threw his head back in frustration. “Why are you doing this to me, Luna?”
“Why not?” she asked curiously.
“I did want to tell you,” Harry insisted. “But Draco, he um…”
“Well?” Draco pressed.
“Believe me, if I had any say in the matter, I’d rather have known what I was from the very start,” said Harry. “But that choice was taken away from me. So, I just had to deal with the hand that I was given.” Harry came to a stop when he saw an ice cream van and was immediately transported back to the first time he visited a zoo in Surrey for Dudley’s eleventh birthday. “Fancy an ice cream?”
“Help me? You don’t even know me!” Draco had had enough. Enough of Liv patronising him, enough of this school and everybody in it. He realised then that Liv wasn’t going to back off unless he made her. Leaning forward he sneered at his professor. “Don’t you get it? I don’t want your help. I’m not interested in anything that you have to say about Muggles or Shakespeare or what you think is worth my time. You say that you know my father. Well, then you’ll know what his views are on your lot: that Mudblood lovers like you are a disgrace to the name of wizard.”
“Okay...but maybe we should sit here for a bit longer,” Harry suggested. “You’re supposed to be escorting me to the Hospital Wing. Unless you’re in a rush to get back and play swordfights with the others?”
“That’s quite a view,” said Draco sounding mildly impressed.
“About what?”
“Umm...all of it, really,” Harry mumbled. “Sorry.”
“I hope you have a lovely Christmas, Draco,” she said before pulling her trunk towards the car, leaving him and Harry alone.
Draco fixed a smirk to his face as his heart began to beat harder in his chest. “For once the rumours about me are true. Unfortunately, the stories about me eloping with Myron Wagtail were pure hearsay. His loss, I say.”
Draco let out a strangled sound, somewhere between laughter and a sob of relief, and he kissed him back, clutching Harry’s hands that remained on either side of his face. There was something desperate about the way that they held each other now. Suddenly, this indefinable thing between them felt much more solid, far more tangible—and at the same time, infinitely more precious and fragile than what it had been only moments before.
There was still a bit of time before classes were due to start, so she decided to take full advantage of her privacy and free time. Using her foot, she pushed herself further away from her desk and began spinning in circles in her swivel chair, grinning mischievously to herself as she twirled faster and faster on the spot. One of the benefits of having had her own office at the Ministry was that she could engage in this bit of harmless fun without anyone else being the wiser. Although, Dirk did join in on occasion and they would compete to see who could perform the most rotations off of one push without using magic.
After their lesson had ended, the students headed down to the Great Hall for their lunch. As it was All Hallow’s Eve, the house-elves went to the effort of making the feast extra spooky to celebrate the occasion: there were candied apples, of course, sugar mice and large chocolate cupcakes bewitched to look like bats that flapped overhead while everyone ate their lunch. A few of the students had tried to snatch one of the tasty confections out of mid-air but so far the bats had evaded capture, flying out of reach every time someone tried to grab one. At the centre of the table was a large platter of strawberry jelly fashioned to look like a human brain, which Draco thought looked far less appetising than the cupcakes. As he took his usual seat next to Harry at the Gryffindor table, Ron was still fuming about his altercation with Theo.
Harry looked at the key he’d been given. “217. You?”
Harry nodded vigorously. “Great. I mean, cool. Alright then.”
They glided towards the ground and landed gently next to the broom shed. Harry climbed off of the broomstick and handed it to Draco.
“This’ll heat you up,” said Hestia brightly, plonking the tankard in front of Liv. Slipping into the empty chair across the small, round table, she raised her own cup. “Cheers.”
“That battle was really exciting, though, wasn’t it?” Myrtle’s tone was inappropriately merry considering the subject matter. “There were so many explosions—and giants! I’ve never seen giants before. I thought for sure that they would knock the whole school to the ground. And there was so much death...I’m surprised that more ghosts didn’t appear afterwards. I could certainly do with the company.”
Liv took a protracted drink from her mug and avoided Hestia’s gaze. Hestia’s eyes widened with surprise at the silent admission. “You didn’t give him detention, did you?”
“I said nothing of the sort.”
While no one mentioned Fred’s death out loud, the memory of it weighed heavily on all of their minds. This would be their first time returning to the school since the battle and, while Harry was looking forward to returning, he wasn’t sure how he would feel about the place when he got there. He didn’t expect things to be the same as they used to be—they had all changed so much in the last year, in the last few months, even—but there was a niggling fear in the back of Harry’s mind that after everything that had happened, Hogwarts would no longer feel like the home that it used to.
Harry’s spirits lifted a little when he heard that. So, he wouldn’t have to do Occlumency lessons after all. He could spend the extra time focusing on Transfiguration instead.
should have been kicked out of school for misbehaviour…”
Pansy drew Draco a sharp look and Hermione chipped in.
“I’m pretty sure we’ve just secured ourselves a lifetime ban from this shop,” he grimaced. Draco chuckled and kissed the crown of Harry’s head.
“Well, have you ever flown in an aeroplane?” she inquired. “Or been to the cinema to watch a film, or listened to Prokofiev—do you even know who Prokofiev is? No? Well, wouldn’t it be better for you to experience some of these things first-hand before dismissing them? Then you can decide whether or not they’re of any use to you.”
“Well, this wouldn’t be the first time you’ve done something your parents wouldn’t approve of,” she reminded him.
Liv grimaced at that. “Oh. Right…”
As everyone quickly dispersed from the Great Hall, Draco slung his school bag over his shoulder and moved as quickly as he could through the thronging crowd out of the hall, trying to put as much distance between him and Harry as possible. Struggling to keep pace, Harry called after Draco to wait, but Draco pretended that he couldn’t hear him and forged ahead. He still felt nauseous after what had just happened, but worse than that was the shame coursing through him for reacting that way to some harmless fireworks. What Harry must think of him…
“Asha!” he exclaimed.
“Remember to write!” she called after him as he boarded the train.
“Me neither,” Liv confirmed.
There was a protracted silence before Harry spoke up again, “I know that you don’t want to talk about what happened…”
“Of love?” she asked curiously.
Draco smirked and cast a quick cleaning charm on Harry before settling down between his legs. “It wasn’t a massage that I had in mind.”
“I was hoping that if I got you two talking, it would break the ice a bit before we addressed the erumpent in the room.” Hermione looked up at Harry then with an unreadable expression. “So, you and Malfoy…”
“What happened to Colin isn’t fair,” Harry continued quietly. “And I know what it feels like—”
“Cast a warming charm, then,” Draco suggested.
“Mr Potter failed to follow my instructions and tried to plant fire seeds without wearing his dragonhide gloves,” she explained. “This is the result.”
“Your kiss scene,” Ginny repeated, giving Harry a despairing look. “Oh, don’t tell me you haven’t even read that far ahead yet? It’s in the first act, for Godric’s sake!”
Harry felt a wave of sympathy for Draco then. Without thinking, he reached out and rested his hand on Draco’s forearm. He felt the muscles in Draco’s arm tense but he didn’t brush Harry off.
What the hell was Draco Malfoy doing in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom?
Before Harry could muster a response to that taunt, the curtains flew open and the tailor strode back into the room, looking flustered.
He turned to look at Draco again and gave him a hard look. Draco’s mouth was suddenly very dry, but he gave a firm nod in response. “Yes, I really do.”
Despite Harry’s protestations, Ginny had ended their relationship that evening. She assured him that they were still friends but he hadn’t been overly keen to speak to her since the break-up. He was still embarrassed at what had happened and he felt irrationally annoyed at her for pointing out something about himself which was now glaringly obvious. That said, he was more annoyed at himself for leaving it to Ginny to point it out to him rather than coming to this realisation about his sexuality himself.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “No, it was my fault what happened.”
“Someone hated you more than I did? I didn’t think that was possible,” Draco joked.
“Oh, what a surprise,” Hermione mocked.
He couldn’t help the shiver that traversed his spine as Harry swiped the shell of his ear with his tongue. “I think we’ve both waited long enough, don’t you agree?”
“Yetis?”
“You’re not going to be able to identify it by its smell or colour,” Snape reminded her. “If brewed properly, Veritaserum is both colourless and odourless.”
“Well, whatever we are now is still a vast improvement on what it was before.”
“I am many things, Potter, but I am not stupid: I know that going back to Hogwarts this year is going to be...difficult. I’m a social pariah, and I fully anticipate being harassed and avoided by almost everyone in the student body. Even amongst those in my own house, my return won’t be a welcome one. While I might not have much going for me, there is one thing that I have that no one can take away from me, a particular skill in my arsenal, something that will sustain me no matter how difficult this year will inevitably be.”
“You’ve got a penchant for troublemakers, don’t you Potter?” he asked spitefully. Harry shrugged.
Draco hadn’t expected the invitation to join them and neither had the other Gryffindors; Neville raised his eyebrows in surprise and Ron drew Harry an incredulous look and hissed “Are you serious?” but grimaced and shut his mouth when Ginny gave him a swift, sharp kick under the table. Draco supposed it was perfectly normal to invite friends to sit with you at breakfast and he and Harry were very publicly friends now—what else they may be was still up for debate and exploration after Harry had finished his toast. And if sitting at the table was going to annoy Weasley so much…
“He’s a man-child in a pair of tights who never grows up,” Draco smirked. “Remind you of anyone that we know?”
“You’re not bad,” said Harry gently. “A bad influence, maybe…”
“They might have strong-armed you into returning to Hogwarts this year, but it was your choice to stay, wasn’t it?” she argued.
“Excellent! I know that Gladrags in Hogsmeade sell Halloween costumes every year but they’re normally magical. I’m not sure where we’ll find Muggle clothes,” she mused. “Oh, what if they don’t have what we’re looking for?”
“Merlin died about a thousand years ago!” Ron laughed. “So you admit that there’s been no half-decent Slytherins since then?”
Bracing himself, Draco tried his best to walk through the thronging crowds, but people kept bashing into him and tripping over his trunk. After a few minutes of meandering and unable to find the exit (let alone the blasted Christmas tree that Liv had assured them ‘couldn’t be missed’) Draco staggered to a halt in the middle of the station, adrift. Even if he could find his way back to the wizarding side of the station through the chaos, he didn’t fancy waiting awkwardly by Harry’s side while he spoke to the Weasley matriarch. It would raise too many questions, apart from anything else. Neither did he want to be standing like a complete plonker in the middle of the station with no clue where the hell he was going. Just as he was beginning to panic, he felt a light tap on the shoulder and turned to see Luna smiling up at him.
As soon as the words had left his mouth he felt awful and cast a guilty glance at Liv who gave him a small but reassuring smile. To her credit, she didn’t look upset at what he’d said; she’d probably heard far worse from others.
“Then St Mungo’s is going to be inundated with patients.”
“Mr Sloper, that is quite enough!” Liv snapped during one rehearsal. She tossed the script onto her chair before marching across the stage to where Jack Sloper and Dean Thomas were squaring up to each other. “That goes for you too, Mr Thomas.”
“Shut it, Malfoy!” Harry snapped.
“It will be difficult, but it will not be pointless,” she argued. “Returning to Hogwarts is in your best interests. You cannot spend your life hidden in the Manor, too afraid to confront the world.”
“I take that you enjoyed your little jaunt at Theo’s?” he asked.
“Oh.” Ron looked disappointed. “Well, do they at least have a Chimaera?”
Harry pursed his lips and rolled his eyes. It was good to know that whatever was wrong with Draco, it hadn’t dulled the sharpness of his tongue.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, I’d be more concerned if she didn’t have her whole life mapped out already.”
“Well, as with nonverbal spells, the potency of some spells may be less effective than if you used a wand to channel your magic,” Hermione added.
late when we arrange to meet up places…”
Myrtle sighed and turned to face Harry. “So what’s your excuse for looking so miserable?”
“Trust is something earned over time, Miss Tonks,” Minerva argued. “So tell me why, after what you have just shown me, do you think that I should employ you?”
Draco’s cheeks flushed pink and he instinctively crossed his arms. Okay, maybe what was going on between them was more obvious than either of them realised.
“Where’ve you been?” asked Ron curiously as Harry finally took a seat at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. “You’ve nearly missed lunch!”
Objectively, she knew that she had nothing to be afraid of. She had spent the better part of a year working with the worst kinds of people imaginable—bigots, sadists, murderers—and survived to tell the tale. What was a Death Eater compared to a bunch of teenagers? Well, she actually cared about the opinions and well-being of her students, for one. But this was no ordinary group of school kids: Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan and Ginny Weasley were amongst those returning students who had spent last year walled up in Hogwarts during the Carrows’ reign. And until very recently, others had been on the run, imprisoned, tortured and worse…
“Huh. I suppose that would explain why Professor Jones has been coming to watch our rehearsals so often,” said Ron thoughtfully. “And there was me thinking she was interested in the play.”
Luna shrugged and pocketed the sweets again. Draco sighed and looked around helplessly again. “Well, we can’t Apparate to the hotel since neither of us have been there before—not that we could do that here, anyway, it’s far too busy. I think our best bet is to head back to the wizarding side and just wait til someone else finds us. Although, how we’re going to find our way back to the platform is beyond me.”
“I’m still angry with you,” he admitted. “But I still love you.”
Draco’s expression was tense. “I meant how long was the cupboard used as your bedroom.”
“Most Pure-bloods haven’t,” she corrected him. “But I’m Muggle-Born—
“What do you think?” Harry asked as he peeled off his heavy school robes and tossed them onto the chair beside his bed. Draco stood awkwardly by the door taking in his new and unfamiliar surroundings.
To Draco’s surprise, Harry’s smile faltered and his hands fell limp by his sides. He took a half-step back from Draco, looking a little sheepish. “Right. Of course…”
Harry proceeded to rhyme off every imaginary creature that he could recall Luna ever mentioning, everything from Moon Frogs to Dabberblimps, Heliopaths to Umgubular Slashkilters, to Gulping Plimpies and Wrackspurts, but to no avail. The more creatures Harry incorrectly guessed, the more excited Luna became. When he ran out of ideas, he shrugged.
“Hold on…” Harry’s eyes narrowed as he read the parchment again. “Potter’s Army...P.A. You’re the ones who wrecked Myrtle’s bathroom!”
Unable to use his hands, Draco pushed the swing door entrance to the Hospital Wing open with his back only to be met with a shrill voice crying, “CLOSE THE DOOR! QUICKLY!”
“It wasn’t a real lion though,” Hermione pointed out. Ron gaped at her.
“And that’s what you are?” Dennis sneered. “A hollowed-out, hateful shell?”
Draco’s smile fell. “My first date?”
he wondered. If that was the case, then it wasn’t working very well. He considered the possibility that Ginny was just doing this to make Harry jealous, but that didn’t make any sense either since Harry wasn’t with anyone else at the moment. He was just spending all of his free time in Malfoy’s company.
“He was checking on me,” Harry cut in. “I’m not feeling well.” Harry gave a feeble cough to illustrate his point. “I think I might be coming down with something. Feels like Black Cat Flu, or something...”
“I brought someone to see you,” he said quietly, pulling out a small ball of white fluff and held it out to Harry. Harry’s eyes immediately widened with excitement.
“Has she lost the plot?” he hissed, running in after her with his wand drawn, closely followed by Harry, Neville, and several other curious students who kept their distance and remained close to the exit.
“Imagine it,” said Draco, smiling to himself. “We’ll just stay in bed, shagging night and day.”
“Don’t talk about my brother,” Dennis warned. “You’re the last person in the world I want to speak to about him. Just leave me alone.”
“Not a chance!” Draco cried and Harry could feel him smiling against his shoulder.
“Yes, but I don’t know who,” he said quietly. “It was sent to me in the owl post.”
“I’ll be with you in a moment,” the tailor said to Harry before kneeling at Draco’s side. “I’m just putting the finishing touches to this gentleman’s order.”
“Why do you care?”
Hermione’s eyes welled with tears. “Oh, Harry…”
“Oh no, you don’t. You’ll need to remain here overnight for observation.”
my penis and ended up in St Mungo’s over the summer holidays,” Nigel Wolpert blurted out, looking mortified as he did so.
Luna cocked her head and gave him a curious look. “You and Harry make each other happy, why would anyone have a problem with that?”
“Act three, scene one,” Hermione reminded her, struggling to hide the amused smirk on her face.
“We already know about the Room of Requirement,” Theo cut in. Liv’s smile faltered.
“Based on the accounts of several patients, it is my belief that a combination of alcohol—Ogden’s Old Firewhisky, if I’m not mistaken—a poorly brewed Babbling Potion and a potent dose of Veritaserum was added to the punch bowl in the Great Hall...”
A hush fell over the crowd as Professor McGonagall rose to her feet to address the school. Harry had seen her at a couple of funerals over the summer, but he noticed that her expression looked more pinched than usual. She cleared her throat and fixed a smile to her tired face.
Harry had hoped that since the war had ended, he might have some time to catch his breath and process everything that had happened in the last year (or the last eighteen years of his life, really), but even that was asking too much. Instead, he’d had countless funerals, testimonies and award ceremonies to attend, the latter of which he particularly detested. But he, above anyone else, was expected to bear witness to the destruction and mayhem that he had contributed to, and the guilty part of his conscience agreed that attending these events was the least that he could do. The only good thing about these events was that they distracted him from thinking about Ginny too much. So, he had appeared at innumerable memorials and celebrations without complaint. He had very little to say at these events beyond constantly reminding his admirers and well-wishers that the victory of the war was hard-fought for and won by many, not just him alone. This proclamation, however, mostly fell on deaf ears. He was sick to the back teeth of being lauded as a great war hero when he knew that he was anything but, contrite at the undeserving praise and irritated by the persistent use of the titles ‘Chosen One’ and ‘The Boy Who Lived.’
“I’d hex off his hair that he loves so much,” said Ron irritably, then he started to look worried. “He better not say anything! You don’t think he will, do you?”
Harry’s friends only left when Madam Pomfrey told them that curfew was fast approaching and they reluctantly waved him off for the evening. At ten o'clock sharp, the matron extinguished all of the candles, plunging the Hospital Wing into darkness. Unable to read in the dark, Draco discarded his script onto the bedside table and settled down to sleep for the night. Draco heard Harry’s bed creak as the other boy turned to face him, although it was too dark to see his face.
The ‘extra precautions’, much to Hermione’s horror, came in the form of a large security troll flanked by several armoured goblins who were to accompany them to each of their vaults. Hermione and Ron took the cart at the front, followed by Ginny and Mrs Weasley in the next. Unfortunately for Harry, with no one else to accompany him, was forced to share the final cart with the security troll. He tried leaning over the edge of the cart in a vain effort to put distance between himself and the foul beast, which smelled like one of the public toilets at the Quidditch World Cup. The troll glared down at Harry and snarled, roughly pulling him back into his seat as they hurtled through the winding tunnels of Gringotts. Harry tried bunching his t-shirt up to cover his face to block out the stench, but it made little difference. Resigning himself to his suffering, Harry sunk back into his seat, defeated. Surely his day couldn’t get any worse than this.
“I...I don’t know
“Miss Tonks is here,” he explained. “For the interview.”
“What...” he faltered, looking between Professor McGonagall and Dennis. “What is this?”
“Myrtle,” said Harry carefully. “During the battle, were there people fighting in your bathroom?”
they’re doing the right thing. I mean, we all make mistakes from time to time, don’t we? Sometimes they’re pretty big, but I don’t think we should be forced to have them hanging over our heads for the rest of our lives.”
“You wouldn’t,” Ron stammered. “I mean, you’re not even gay! Tell me she’s lying, Harry.”
Draco rubbed the sore spot on the back of his head, he could already feel a lump forming under his hair. “Yes, I did hit the ground quite hard. No thanks to you, you’re a lot heavier than you look.”
They chatted as they climbed several flights of stairs. Harry, who was used to walking this route every day, couldn’t help but chuckle at how breathless Draco was getting. Draco grimaced and rubbed a stitch in his side after they reached the foot of the seventh flight of stairs.
Draco nodded. “And when you took my wand, I felt like a part of me was missing. I wasn’t able to get a replacement, so I had to master the basics of wandless magic, but it was difficult because I’d grown so accustomed to channelling my magic through my wand. So…” Draco picked up Harry’s quill. “I had to improvise. I imagined that a quill was my wand and that I was channelling my magic through that. Once I learned to do that, I discarded the quill and now I can do wandless magic with my eyes closed.”
“Well, thankfully you don’t run the school, even though you like to act as if you do!” Draco snapped.
A stunned silence followed that announcement.
“If I did, I wouldn’t have been stupid enough to handle it without gloves,” he quipped. “To be honest, I was half-expecting something like this to happen. I’m sure it was simply someone’s idea of a bad joke.”
Hermione hesitated before saying, “I’m not going to try and justify what he did—”
Harry looked around the classroom again, paying closer attention to the Slytherin students and he noticed that they were all looking a little worse for wear.
Neville looked despairingly at Harry for an answer. Neville had undoubtedly gained a lot of self-confidence in the last couple of years—not four months ago he defied Voldemort, to his face no less, and beheaded a great bloody snake in the process. But every so often, the old Neville—the one who suffered from crippling self-doubt—bubbled back to the surface. He would never admit it aloud, but it gave Harry an odd sense of comfort that, in spite of everything that Neville had experienced, he could still be worried about something as seemingly mundane as his exams. It gave Harry hope that he, too, could feel the same way about normal things, like any normal eighteen-year-old.
“Malfoy was sitting on his own again today,” said Harry thoughtfully.
been rehearsing?” he asked.
Ron was in a foul mood. He had just seen Ginny and Theo enter the shop together, whispering conspiratorially to one another before greeting Luna and Neville. Hermione had given him a warning look that told him to mind his own business, thrust a costume into his hands and pushed him into one of the empty changing rooms. Ron started putting the costume on, deep in thought. He just didn’t understand it. He was so sure that Harry and Ginny would have moved past their little tiff and gotten back together by now, but his sister seemed more interested in the affections of Theo Nott these days. Stranger still was that Harry didn’t seem the least bit bothered by this.
being serious!” he argued.
“I didn’t see anything,” said Harry quickly, hoping to de-escalate the argument that was about to erupt. “I hate to say it but he’s really good at Occlumency. I couldn’t get past his defences.”
“Oh? Why’s that?” asked Liv curiously. Hestia gave a careless shrug, a mischievous smile playing across her lips.
“Can we talk about something else?” Draco replied stiffly. The last thing that he needed right now was to relive one of the worst days of his life.
Hestia’s smile broadened. “Yeah, that’d be lovely.”
The goblin clicked his long fingers and several armed goblins approached, the tips of their golden spears pointed at the trio. Harry instinctively reached for his wand, but Hermione grabbed his arm and shook her head.
Asha squeaked in the affirmative and they watched her hop out of Harry’s hands into the tall grass and disappear from view, the grass rustling slightly as she made her way back towards the castle.
As they entered the entrance hall, Draco veered off to the right and up the grand staircase, leaving Harry glaring after him. Harry had met a lot of awful people in his life but Draco Malfoy was, without a doubt, the most infuriating person that he had ever met. Well, at least he didn’t have to put up with him during Herbology—it was bad enough sitting across from him in Muggle Studies. Harry couldn’t understand why Draco had even bothered turning up for the class since the smug git didn’t even pretend to be doing any of the work. Hopefully, they didn’t have any other classes together because the less time they spent in each other’s company, the better...
“Never mind that,” Hermione cut in. “That outfit is completely inaccurate! Your shin guards would be leather, not bronze, that helmet you’re wearing would have been worn by a Roman soldier, not a gladiator, and your shield would have been square, not round! And the loincloth...well, to be fair the loincloth is accurate,” she conceded before shaking her head in disbelief. “No. The costume is all wrong. You’ll just have to pick another one.”
“Bloody hell.” Harry picked up one of the doors that lay on the floor and propped it against the wall. He found it hard to believe that anyone would deliberately target Myrtle. She could be annoying at times but mostly she kept to herself.
“I dunno, I think it’s just the right size for the two of us.” Harry closed the distance between them and kissed him soundly. He felt the ache of want between his legs grow as Draco slipped his hand down his trousers and stroked him, humming with approval as Harry grew hard in his grip.
“I like reading books,” Hestia reminded her. “Do you think
“If I wanted to be insulted by people I can easily spend my time elsewhere,” he grumbled.
“Sin from my lips?” Harry chuckled. “O, trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.”
Harry cocked his eyebrow at Draco. “I don’t know whether I should be insulted or flattered by that comment.”
Although Professor McGonagall had intended for the responsible parties behind the calamitous events of the Halloween party to remain anonymous, naturally, come morning, the entire school knew who was to blame. While the students were understandably angry at Abberley and McKinley for spiking the punch with alcohol and a Babbling Potion, that was nothing compared to the vitriol reserved for Dennis Creevey and the other members of the ill-famed group that called themselves Potter’s Army.
“It seems like they were fated to die,” Luna noted sadly, but Liv shook her head.
“Yes, I’m rather fond of the zoo, myself.” Ron and Hermione raised their eyebrows in surprise and he added somewhat sheepishly, “What? I like animals.”
His heart pounded with excitement as they soared out of the stadium and towards the Black Lake. Draco’s grip around his waist tightened as he took a sharp dip towards the ground, flying lower and lower until their feet were skimming inches above the inky black water. Shimmering diamonds of sunlight danced across its surface as they flew over it at top speed. Gradually, Draco’s grip slackened and he lifted his head off of Harry’s shoulder as they circled the lake.
“Got room for one more?” he grinned. Neville looked up from his copy of The Quibbler and smiled.
Ron kept his back turned to Draco but the tension in his shoulders eased a little. Draco sighed and forced himself to continue, “Harry loves you, Weasley. You and Granger. And you know what? I’m jealous of how much he loves you both. I always have been. So when, for some reason that will always elude me, he reciprocated my feelings, I jumped at the chance to experience just an iota of what you and Granger get from him. If I had my own way, I’d keep him all to myself and I wouldn’t share him with anybody. But Harry’s not like that. He’d give me up in a heartbeat if you asked him to, even if he didn’t want to, because he cares about what you two think more than anything else in the world.”
“I’m fine,” she choked. “This’ll be over in a moment.”
“So, you admit that you added the Babbling Potion?”
“Not really,” he admitted. “I think it’s best if we just don’t talk about it again. Ever.”
“This looks good,” she said. “Thank you.”
Draco quirked an amused eyebrow at him. “Really? I’ll keep that in mind for the future.”
“Ron, now isn’t the time to talk about this,” Harry rushed. “Something is seriously wrong here. I think everyone’s been poisoned or cursed or…”
Harry couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing, but he shook his head. “No.”
Theo snarled and threw his hands up into the air in frustration. “Urgh, you always do this!”
Harry knew better than to ask who they were looking for, but then again, he had a far more pressing question on his mind. “Excuse me, Professor McGonagall. You asked to see me?”
“Not this year,” said Hermione lightly, taking a sip from her glass of orange juice.
“Why?”
“Careful!” Harry shouted, checking the robes for the ferret. “You might hurt her!”
He glanced up and down the corridor but nobody paid him any mind, too absorbed in their own thoughts and worries. Before he could talk himself out of it, Draco got to his feet and walked swiftly to where Ron stood doodling angry faces and phallic images onto the window condensation. He only noticed Draco was beside him after he cleared his throat, and he looked none too happy to see him.
“Maybe,” Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer. “Know any hot blondes that run their mouths all the time?"
Hermione lowered her hand again and asked tentatively, “I’m sorry Professor but...what relevance does
Hestia sighed and hooked her arm through Liv’s pulling her closer as they walked up the stone steps towards the castle’s entrance. “You don’t give yourself enough credit. I think you’re very interesting. Why else would I spend so much of my time in your company?”
Hestia exclaimed.
“I think that’s quite enough about me. Before I begin to outline our lesson plan for the upcoming year, I just want to make something clear, particularly for those of you who were unfortunate enough to be in Alecto Carrow’s class last year: let me assure you that things will be quite different from now on. I’m here to teach you, not hurt you. Differences in opinion will not be punished and any disputes will be resolved with constructive arguments, not wands. Understood?”
“Stop it, he’s hurting him!” cried Pansy, looking distraught.
“Tell me something,” he began. “What happened between you and Ginny?”
“It says here that soon after you graduated, you emigrated to the United States and spent five years working for MACUSA at the Office for Magic Relations and Education. What did that job entail?”
He glanced occasionally out of the window, watching the pale winter sun dip beneath the horizon as they left the Scottish highlands behind and entered the flatlands of England. He was actually quite nervous about going to Muggle London since his parents had never taken him there. He’d never been interested in seeing it for himself either, truth be told. There was nothing that Muggles did that he couldn’t already do with magic. Moreover, he resented the fact that he had to hide his true self just for the benefit of small-minded Muggles. It was a world that he knew nothing about beyond the pages of the textbooks that Liv had given them, and he wasn’t the sort of person that enjoyed being out of his comfort zone.
“Oops! Sorry, Harry…” she whispered before answering, “Legilimency is the act of magically navigating through a person’s mind. A person who practices this art is known as a Legilimens. Some wizards are born with the ability but it is an incredibly rare gift. Occlumency is the opposite of Legilimency as it is used to shield one’s mind from the invasion and influence of a Legilimens.”
“Come in!”
“Evidently,” Draco replied shortly, keeping his eyes fixed on his feet.
Draco gritted his teeth in frustration and banged his head against the wall. There he was again, getting defensive and lashing out at anyone who tried to reach out to him. Theo was right—he was childish.
“You want to come with me?”
Draco considered Harry’s proposal in silence for a moment before giving a careless shrug. “I suppose there’s no harm in trying.”
“Pleasure’s all mine, Tom,” he replied, smiling warmly at the old innkeeper. “Thanks again for letting us Floo into your kitchen.”
One thing that he had not missed, however, was dragging himself out of bed for early morning lessons. Harry had always been more of a night owl, and after spending a long summer with no fixed time to get out of bed, having to get up at the crack of dawn for classes was a bit of a shock to the system. The early morning sunlight poured through the boys’ dormitory window, slowly crawling up Harry’s bed until it reached his face. Still half-asleep, Harry buried his face into his pillow to shield his eyes from the sunlight. He was annoyed at being woken up so early, especially since he’d just been having the most wonderful dream. He couldn’t remember the particulars of it, but it had involved flying atop paper aeroplanes with a particular blonde-haired sort-of friend of his that would remain unnamed.
“It’s this costume,” Ron heard Harry grumble. “It’s got too many straps and buckles, I’m having a hell of a time putting it together.”
“Alright,” said Harry with a careless shrug and a shit-eating grin across his face. “Best three out of five?”
“Not the ones that mattered to me.”
“How do you feel?” Draco asked when he finally got his breath back.
“A lot of us have,” Harry pointed out, carefully placing Asha back into her pet carrier. “I don’t know if coming back here was necessarily the best idea for everyone.”
“It didn’t help that you were a team of dirty players,” Harry pointed out. At least Draco had the good grace not to deny it. He gave a careless shrug.
He pressed the flat of his tongue against Harry’s hole and gave it an experimental swipe. Harry responded immediately by gasping and Draco smiled to himself as he watched the muscles clench and unclench in response to his touch.
The little ferret squeaked excitedly and ran up Ron’s arm into Harry’s outstretched hands. She curiously sniffed the bandages on his hands and forearms before settling herself down on his lap. When she caught sight of Draco in the next bed, she wagged her little tail excitedly and for a moment he was afraid that she would pounce on him again. Thankfully, she remained on Harry’s lap for the duration of her visit.
“And so he should! My being dead is no laughing matter, yet he saw fit to mock me nonetheless,” Myrtle’s anger seemed to melt away as quickly as it had arisen. Her shoulders sagged and she sniffed loudly, wiping a transparent tear from her eye. “How could he say such an awful thing to me? I thought that we were friends.”
Draco glanced at the rain lashing hard against the window and everyone replied with an unenthusiastic mumble. A knowing smile spread across Liv’s face and Draco braced himself. He knew that look all too well now—what the hell did she have planned for them this time?
“There’s nothing to worry about, Harry,” she whispered. “I’ve heard you’re a dab hand at Defence. I’m sure that you’ll breeze through this.”
“Really?” asked Snape making no effort to hide the sarcasm in his voice. “I find that very hard to believe.”
“That’s entirely up to you.”
“And miss Hermione’s day of organised fun?” Harry chuckled. “She’d never allow it.”
“I don’t think anyone would believe me if I told them,” Harry half-joked, knowing full well that it was true. Draco’s smile became a little strained and he avoided Harry’s gaze.
“He started it!” Jack protested, pointing his paintbrush accusingly at Dean, who opened his mouth to protest but was cut off by Liv, who raised her hand and her voice to get everyone’s attention.
“Mmm, I thought you’d like that,” Draco whispered, very slowly and deliberately running his hand along the full length of Harry’s shaft, delighting at the shaky gasp that escaped Harry’s lips as he twisted his wrist on the upstroke. “You’ve no idea how amazing you look right now, Harry. So hot. So fuckable…”
“You wouldn’t be ignoring Mrs Malfoy’s correspondence based on your own personal grievance with the boy?” he asked accusingly. All of the other portraits in the office were now listening with rapt attention. Minerva felt heat prickle her cheeks but she glared at the old headmaster.
“A what?”
Harry, in typically stubborn fashion, crossed his arms. “Move out of the way, Draco.”
“What do you think?” she asked Harry keenly. “Do you like it?”
“It feels so much better when you do it,” he panted. “You can push in deeper than I can.”
don’t have to do anything,” Draco argued. “They’re your friends, I’m under no obligation to follow them around. Besides, I could do with a lie-in, you kept me up well past my bedtime last night.”
“You speak French?” asked Minerva interestedly. Liv grinned.
The goblin gave a derisive laugh. “By destroying half of it in the process?”
“Last night.”
The classroom gradually filled with Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and additional Gryffindors, some of them casting wary glances in Liv’s direction as she pretended to busy herself with sorting through her notes. She couldn’t blame them for being cautious of her considering their last Muggle Studies professor was a Death Eater; she knew that she faced an uphill battle to earn their trust. The last students to turn up were the Slytherins, all of whom looked as though they would rather be anywhere in the world than in that classroom. Finally, just as Liv was about to close the classroom door and begin the lesson, a tall boy with platinum blonde hair strolled in and slipped into an empty chair nearest the exit. With a bored sneer fixed across his face, he crossed his arms and stared straight ahead, not even bothering to put parchment or a quill onto his desk like the other students. She recognised Draco Malfoy from the papers as well, although for rather different reasons than Harry Potter.
“You know what, Malfoy?” said Harry in a low voice. “You kind of suit them.”
“I wouldn’t be if you would just let me come home,” he mumbled.
“Dad should be here soon to pick us up,” she said.
“I told her. Don't pull that face, she can be very discreet when she wants to be,” he said briskly.
she thought to herself. Nobody is likely to notice something so small. At least her hair was tidy: styled into a low, flat, twisted bun, she tucked the few loose strands behind her ears and tossed the mirror back into the top drawer. Satisfied that she didn’t look like an idiot, now all she had to do was to make sure that she didn’t act like one. Closing her eyes, she huffed out a breath and rolled her shoulders, trying to relax. Despite all of her preparation, she was still worried that she would end up making a fool of herself.
Ron scrutinised his reflection in the changing room mirror, screwing up his nose in distaste. The costume that Hermione had picked out for him looked ridiculous: the green velour robes clashed horribly with his fiery red hair and the garland of fig leaves and berries that adorned his head was too small, so it sat perched on top of his head like a bird’s nest. He twisted left and right, checking his appearance from all angles but it was no better however you looked at it. Ron sighed and adjusted the crown on top of his head. This looked almost as bad as the dress robes he’d worn to the Yule Ball.
“Thanks Luna, I like yours too.” He could just see Luna’s protuberant silvery eyes peering through the mouth of her costume. “Um...who are you supposed to be?”
“Well, you’re in luck,” she said brightly, brandishing her small beaded purse. “I took the liberty of making us packed lunches this morning so that we could work throughout the day without needing to waste all of that time in the Great Hall!”
“Like...as in a date?”
“Where on earth have you two been?” called Mrs Weasley as they approached, worriedly wringing a tea towel in her hands. “I was about to send out a search party!”
“Duly noted,” Liv muttered. “Well, now that embarrassing introductions are out of the way, how can I help you, Miss Jones?”
When they reached the landing for the seventh years’ room, Draco leant against the wall to catch his breath and Harry stuck his head through the door first to check if the coast was clear. He was relieved to find the dormitory was empty, so he ushered Draco inside.
Crabbe’s face, seared in pain and panic and vanishing in Fiendfyre, flashed through Draco’s mind and it took some effort to push the memory aside. “We all know what it feels like to lose someone...but you and I both know what it is to hate.”
He sounded surprised, almost in awe of himself that this could be true. The argument continued to rage on just beyond the leafy canopy but Harry paid it no mind.
“What do you two have to say for yourselves?” Professor McGonagall cut in, turning her attention to the two students on Harry’s right. Neither boy seemed to have the courage to speak up, and Harry couldn’t blame them; he’d never seen his former Head of House look so angry.
There was a collective gasp from the audience as Juliet plunged the dagger into her body, her eyes widening with shock for a moment before she slumped forward on top of Romeo’s body in an eternal embrace. Draco’s eyes stung and he feigned scratching his temple to wipe away a tear, moved and embarrassed in equal measures by his reaction. He barely paid attention to the closing minutes of the play, but he’d had enough of tragic love and feuding families for one night. Suddenly, the lights in the theatre went up and the audience rose to their feet in applause, Harry among them. He turned to look at Draco but his smile immediately fell when he saw Draco’s grave expression.
Harry groaned in annoyance and rolled his eyes. “Alright. What scene are you rehearsing?”
Neville left the compartment to go find Luna, but Harry wasn’t in a hurry to depart the train. He was happy to wait for the rest of the students to get off ahead of him before finding a quiet carriage up to the castle. That way he’d avoid being stared at by the entire gaggle of students. When the station platform quietened down, Harry picked up his trunk and pet carrier and shuffled down the carriage towards the exit. Despite his trepidations about returning, Harry couldn’t help but feel excited about coming back to Hogwarts. For Harry, it always felt like coming home.
“Not before I do!” Ron cried, lugging his trunk after his sister.
“Hurt
“No, it isn't!” she argued, pointing at the list. “These six texts are the core reading list for the year and everything else is supplementary. You don’t necessarily have to read these other books—”
She turned around to face her unenthusiastic class to find, predictably, only one hand raised high into the air. Hermione was practically on the edge of her seat and gave her hand a slight wave in case Hestia hadn’t seen her.
“So, it’s true?” Neville pressed. “You two? It’s official now?”
“So you disagree with me on this?” she queried. “You don’t think Goyle was being genuine?”
Liv laughed and rolled her eyes. “Tell me about it. I’ve lost count the number of times I’ve stumbled across students in the supply cupboard on the third floor. It’s a depressing state of affairs when the students have more active love lives than we do.”
“Ooh, on first name terms now, are you?” Draco sneered. “So, the rumours about you two are true, then? I wonder what your father would have to say about that.”
“Oh, well that’s good, isn’t it?” said Harry.
“You’re missing all of the fun! A few of the lads have found a box full of prop swords and are trying them out on stage.” When she saw Draco’s peaky expression, she frowned. “Mr Malfoy, are you feeling alright? You look awfully pale.”
The image of Lucius Malfoy looking like a drenched rat made Harry snort. “Well, maybe we could go together sometime.”
“What?”
Harry pushed himself off of the railing and turned to leave but Draco grabbed his hand. “You’re not angry at them for what they did to you, but you’re angry at me for asking about it?”
His eyes scanned across the room again searching for Draco but there was still no sign of him. Harry sank back into his seat, feeling disappointed. Despite what had happened earlier in the day, Draco had assured him that he would be here tonight, but it looked as though he had changed his mind. Harry resisted the temptation to pull out the Marauder’s Map and look for him. If Draco wanted to be here, he would turn up eventually.
Luna responded by thrusting the remaining posters into Harry’s arms and storming off without another word.
“I don’t get it. Did you ever actually fancy her?” he asked. “Or any girl for that matter? You seemed really into Cho back in the day.”
“Nothing, Professor, we were just grabbing ourselves a drink,” Harry explained.
She turned to Liv and gave her a quick nod and took her seat again. Liv leapt to her feet so fast that she knocked over a goblet of pumpkin juice in the process. Cursing under her breath, Hestia and Professor Slughorn helped her mop up the mess with tissues before she straightened her robes and smiled sheepishly at the students.
“No,” he confirmed. Madam Pomfrey nodded, satisfied.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat before admitting, “I lost my Firebolt a while back.”
“If you don’t have any serious suggestions, I’d rather you didn’t say anything,” she said testily.
“Fuck, Harry, you look so sexy like this,” said Draco, his voice deep and husky. “I wish we were back up at the castle right now. Then I could sink my cock into your tight, wet hole and fuck you into the bed.”
Draco drank the moans of pleasure that spilled from Harry’s lips as he fucked him, entranced by the writhing, panting body beside him. Harry’s hands clutched at Draco’s, entwining their fingers as they pulled their bodies closer together. Draco’s head was spinning but he closed his eyes and surrendered himself to the feeling. Harry’s panting breaths (or were they his own? He couldn’t tell anymore) synced with the beating of his heart thumping in his ears. God, the feel of Harry, so hot and tight, his taste, his smell...everything about him was intoxicating. Draco was drowning in it, his senses in overdrive as the rest of the world seemed to fall away to nothing and leaving only him and Harry, rocking back and forth, pushing and pulling each other closer to climax.
“There’s only one way to find out,” she declared.
After their explosive rehearsal in the Slytherin boys’ dormitory, Harry and Draco quickly fell into a routine. Once lessons had finished for the day, they would have their dinner—usually with Draco sitting at the Gryffindor table, much to Ron’s ire—before excusing themselves for their evening ‘rehearsals’, which usually involved heavy petting and sometimes actually practising their lines. They practised wherever they could without interruption; their respective dormitories, abandoned classrooms, and the odd broom cupboard came in handy for their liaisons. They even fulfilled one of Harry’s fantasies by christening the Quidditch locker rooms before McGonagall and the other members of staff focused their efforts on making round the clock repairs to the ruined stadium, making it impossible for them to hook up there again.
And then, of course, there was Harry Potter. Liv had been surprised to read in the papers that the so-called saviour of the wizarding world would want to return to the mundane routine of school life. Still, she was interested to see what kind of student he would turn out to be. It was a classroom full of veritable war heroes and villains, not your usual group of hormonal, opinionated adolescents. These kids had already seen and experienced more of the world than most of their peers, which presented a unique challenge for Liv: how on earth was she going to get them to listen to a damn word that she, a stranger—an outsider—had to say?
“Of course he does!” she said crossly. “Why would that be a problem?”
“Apologies again for the delay, gentlemen. It is a very busy time of year,” he sighed, moving back over to Draco’s side. Harry glared at Draco’s smug expression in the mirror, trying to think of a clever retort but drawing a blank.
“A photograph of you getting escorted in chains in front of the Wizengamot will sell a lot more papers than one of you looking prim and proper in your school uniform,” Theo pointed out. “Personally, I don’t know why Potter’s taken such a big strop over the article, most of it seems to be about you.”
Harry huffed out a soft laugh at that playful threat. Looking more determined than afraid now, Harry began to rise out of his seat but paused as he heard someone call his name.
“You’re late,” he accused. Harry snorted.
Madam Pomfrey shook her head in disgust and ushered Draco over to one of the hospital beds. “Only a coward attacks defenceless schoolchildren. This cannot continue. I’ll need to speak to the Headmistress about this.”
As he exited the Great Hall, it suddenly occurred to him that Draco might not show up, but his moment of panic was quickly dispelled as he saw Draco lingering by the Grand Staircase with his arms crossed, looking as nervous as Harry felt. When he saw Harry approach, his arms fell by his sides and relief flitted across his face.
“Alright. What did
“We do!” Ron assured her. “But we hardly have the time to enjoy the things we’re looking at before we need to rush off to the next place.”
“You know that I’m right,” Harry argued. He sighed and shook his head in disbelief. “First the bubotuber pus, now this. How many more things need to happen before you take this seriously?” Draco remained ominously silent and Harry’s eyes narrowed. “Has anything else happened that I don’t know about?”
“No, it’s just a ferret,” Harry assured him. “I saw her in the Magical Menagerie a few weeks ago. She’d managed to escape her cage and was causing havoc in the shop. Apparently, she’d garnered herself a reputation as a bit of a troublemaker.”
Snape raised his eyebrows in surprise. “That almost sounds like a compliment.”
“Make me,” Draco dared him.
“I ate a Puking Pastille and I crapped my pants,” cried Romilda Vane, hiding her face in her hands.
“If she’s only half-Jarvey she might not be able to. Probably for the best,” Hagrid mused. “Jarveys are cheeky little blighters, they usually just throw insults at ye. How’s yer rock cake, Hermione?”
“What, you’d rather that I was horrible to you?”
“S’nice,” he mumbled before disappearing back behind the curtain.
he thought viciously. He wanted to make her angry. Hopefully, he could make her so angry that she would kick him out of her stupid class—maybe she would go to McGonagall and demand that he be kicked out of the school if he was lucky. That way, he could just go home.
“Sometimes,” he relented. His gaze flicked towards Draco’s lips. “Nott was right about one thing, though: I do have a thing for troublemakers.”
“Because you wanted a year to doss about before getting a proper job,” Harry reminded him.
This is it, everyone! The final chapter is finally here. Thank you to my betas and my regular readers for sticking with me and this story, it's been a VERY long journey getting here, years in the making. I hope that the conclusion to this tale is a satisfactory one for all of you. Enjoy!
“I don’t know,” he mumbled. “It just is.”
“Nothing to see here, Potter,” he sneered.
“Oh good. Me neither.” Evidently, being hopelessly lost didn’t concern her as much as it did him. Humming to herself, she pulled a red and white striped paper bag from her pocket and popped a hard sweet the size of a Knut into her mouth, only to screech like a banshee a moment later. Draco startled and took a large step back from her, equal parts shocked and embarrassed by her inexplicable behaviour. Stranger still was that none of the Muggles even reacted to her outburst, they just carried on as though they hadn’t heard anything. Luna, meanwhile, simply smiled and held out the paper bag to him. “Shrieking Sherbert?”
“Happy New Year,” Neville replied, giving them both a small wave.
“I don’t think you two are so unlike,” she said gently. “You’re both such sensitive souls, and you can feel so lonely, especially here at Hogwarts...and you look peaceful when you sleep, too.”
Harry gave him a warm smile. “Exactly. I think doing this play together definitely falls under the category of weird, but whether it’s good or bad...that might be worth further exploration before we decide one way or the other.”
Draco blinked. “Excuse me?”
“I wasn’t gawking!” he mumbled in protest. “I just can’t believe that he’s actually showed up. He’s got some nerve…”
“Which I suck at,” Harry chipped in.
Harry eagerly obliged and it only took three or four strokes before he was cumming. He managed to gasp Draco’s name in short, breathy bursts once, twice, three times in a crescendo before his eyes grew impossibly wide and his breath stuttered. Draco gave another thrust of his hips and he groaned as ropes of semen shot across Harry’s heaving chest. That was enough to push Draco, who had been teetering on the edge of orgasm for so long, over the edge. The searing tension that had been building up in the pit of his stomach finally snapped and he cried out as he came, his cock pulsing inside of Harry’s body. As Draco’s grip on Harry’s legs slackened, Harry reached out and grabbed Draco by the neck, pulling him into a fierce kiss. Draco continued to thrust into Harry’s pliant body, riding the crest of his orgasm until it was too sensitive to continue. Pleasure coursed through his veins like a pulse, thrumming against the inside of his skull in time with his heartbeat as he slowly came back down to earth. He was vaguely aware of Harry pressing worshipful kisses along the column of his neck and shoulder, holding him close.
It would be at The Globe Theatre—in London.”
“Last night, I was practicing the incantation he discussed during the lesson and I managed to turn my right eye blue,” she continued. “But I’m having some trouble changing the left one; it looks more grey than aquamarine.”
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” she warned in a low voice. Reluctantly, Harry withdrew his hand from his robes and raised them into the air. This wasn’t a great start to his incognito shopping trip.
Hestia waited patiently for Liv to reply but Liv merely stared back at her with a confused expression.
that Professor Tonks had given him.
“I don’t think it sounds stupid,” said Harry gently, taking the seat next to Draco. There wasn’t much room on the seated ledge and Harry tried his best not to be distracted by how warm and firm Draco’s thigh felt pressed against his own. “Considering what happened in that room, I think that it makes perfect sense. Try not to beat yourself up over it.”
“I saw you sitting up here on your own and thought that we could rehearse our lines together,” he offered.
“Oh Merlin, I didn’t even think about that,” said Harry worriedly. Draco laughed and Harry glared at him. “This isn’t funny, Draco!”
The scene began to dissolve again, the colours diffusing into a swirl of shapeless colours before slowly reforming back into the office again. Liv remained seated behind her desk, looking considerably thinner and paler than before. She yelped in surprise as someone knocked loudly on her door and a moment later a dishevelled-looking man slipped inside without waiting for an invitation.
doing here?” asked Harry, turning his broom to face Draco.
“I think Draco has a point,” said Hermione. “Maybe we should ask the Sorting Hat for a second opinion.”
“...and finally, I am delighted to announce that this Valentine’s Day will be an extra special one,” Professor McGonagall continued. “For the last three months, our final year students have been hard at work readying a production of the Muggle playwright, William Shakespeare’s, most famous works,
we’re still friends. Like I said, I don’t really know what’s happening between us at the moment...not that there’s anything happening between us, I mean.”
“If you don’t believe me, take a look for yourself,” said Neville coolly, then added, “But I rather you didn’t. I don’t want you getting hurt, Hermione…”
“Don’t get all high and mighty with me!” Draco hissed. “Doing the right thing? Since when has that ever factored into anything that you do? Oh, let me guess, the Weaslette sent you up here to talk to me, didn’t she?”
“Well then count your blessings that they love me more than they hate you,” Harry said, slipping his arm under the table and taking hold of Draco’s hand. “They know that hurting you will hurt me, that’s why I know that they won’t say anything.”
“You should be angrier.”
Draco blinked a couple of times, not quite believing his ears. He couldn’t recall any time in his entire life when his parents had allowed him to deal with anything on his own. They had always, for better or worse, endeavoured to protect him, from the world and from himself—sometimes with catastrophic results. Yet here his mother sat, candidly admitting that despite every instinct telling her otherwise, she had actually listened to Draco this time—had really heard him—and had allowed him, for once in his life, to decide something for himself. Something fundamental, too. A wave of gratitude washed over him then. Unable to articulate his feelings into words, he reached out and squeezed his mother’s hand instead.
Ron looked around to double check that Madam Pomfrey was in her office before rummaging through the right pocket of his robes.
“However…” Hestia continued. “For those of you interested in working in law enforcement, security or banking after you graduate, participation in these lessons is essential. At a minimum, you must learn basic Occlumency to even be considered for roles in those fields.”
Harry nodded in understanding and gave Draco’s leg another slight squeeze before removing his hand completely. Draco had the overwhelming urge to grab Harry’s hand and kiss him hard on the mouth in front of everyone, to hell with the consequences. He wished that he were that brave. Instead, he neatly folded his hands on his lap and bowed his head.
Draco read through the draft letter to his mother again.
The sound of quills scratching on parchment filled the otherwise silent classroom as Liv proceeded to outline her lesson plan for the year, explaining what subjects they would be covering and advising them on which books they ought to read. Glancing at the clock overhead, she was surprised to see that she only had ten minutes left until the end of the lesson. Turning back to face the class, she smiled mischievously at her students: it was finally time to unveil her big plan.
Harry watched with interest as Draco wrapped his legs tightly around the broomstick and flipped upside down, the tips of his blonde locks skimming across the grass as he zoomed past.
“Yeah, me too.” Draco glanced at the boa constrictor and asked, “Can you still talk to snakes?”
He couldn’t reach Ron with all the journalists following him around and he had no clue where in Muggle London the girls had gone. He considered heading back to the Leaky Cauldron and hiding out in Tom’s kitchen until the others returned, but the one thing that he really needed, that he could not purchase by owl, was his school robes. Scanning up and down the busy street for inspiration, his eyes lingered on Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, its bright orange signage easily discernible at the top of the street. Hadn’t George mentioned getting his swanky dragonhide suit from some posh clothes shop on Diagon Alley? Twittings, or something? Harry remembered him saying it was on the south side of Diagon Alley, close to the Owl Emporium. Casting one last look in the direction of Madam Malkin’s, Harry turned and headed in the direction of the Emporium, keeping his eyes peeled for other robes shop on route.
Whatever else Harry was going to say, Draco never found out because a moment later he felt Harry’s hole clenched around his cock like a vice. At the same time, Harry’s breath stuttered, closely followed by spurts of hot, slick seed coating Draco’s hand. Harry seemed to have momentarily lost the ability to make any sound, even breath. Time seemed to stand still for a moment, the two of them balancing on a precipice before they tumbled over the edge together and then Harry moaned, a long, deep guttural sound, almost animalistic, and Draco thought it was the most beautiful thing he’d ever heard. Harry’s grip tightened on Draco’s right hand as though to stop himself from keeling over, and he kept moaning over and over again as Draco milked his spent cock until there was nothing left.
“Don’t be so dramatic, she barely touched you!” Harry carefully stowed Asha back into her pet carrier. Draco scoffed and pointed accusingly at the mischievous mustelid.
“No, you’re not!” she wailed. “You wouldn’t have said it if you didn’t mean it! You’re just like everyone else in this school: you’re only interested in me when you need me but once I’ve outlived my usefulness, you leave. They always leave in the end.”
“To what end?” asked Professor McGonagall.
A loud whistle blew and the students still standing on the platform began hurrying onto the train.
Harry checked his luggage again. He had his travel backpack (which Hermione had kindly blessed with an Extension Charm), his trusty mokeskin pouch, a packed lunch courtesy of Mrs Weasley, and Asha (who was secured to her lead) was currently rummaging through his coat pocket for treats.
He didn’t know what else to say about it—Herbology had always been Neville’s speciality—but he was content listening to his friend chat away about the finer details of magical plant care, revelling in the fact that he no longer had to worry about Death Eaters and Dark Lords. The rest of the journey was pleasantly uneventful: Harry and Neville bought a large pile of sweets from the trolley witch—they offered to share them with Dennis, but he declined—and chatted about their subjects for the upcoming year.
“Hurry up, will you? We haven’t got all day.”
“Potter.”
“So be it.” With lightning speed, she drew her wand, pointed it at the smouldering graffiti on the wall and, with a flick of her wrist, the threatening message was gone and a new Slytherin banner unfurled. Stowing her wand back up her sleeve, she turned her sharp gaze onto the students and staff. “Well? Don’t you all have classes to attend?”
he asked. The colour quickly rose in Neville’s cheeks.
this is,” he stammered.
“Yeah?” he asked. “You really think so?”
“Of course I tried!” he snarled. “You’re just—I can’t—”
She handed each of the students a feather. “All I want you to do is levitate your feather off of the desk. It will require a good deal of practice, concentration and mental discipline to achieve this, so I don’t expect any of you to be able to do this on the first try. But by the end of the lesson, I’m confident most of you will succeed.”
Draco visibly relaxed and returned the smile. “You know what, Potter? You’re alright.”
“I don’t know!” he snapped. “Christ, we’ve only been seeing each other a few weeks. Aren’t you getting a bit ahead of yourself?”
Liv cleared her throat and took another sip of her hot drink. “Yes, that was a very...convincing performance they put on.”
“Then why don’t you just ask her to stop?”
“It’s not a chimaera,” said Neville. “It’s a lion. A chimaera's got a snake’s tail.”
“That’s my bed,” Harry deadpanned. He burst out laughing at the horrified expression on Draco’s face and flopped onto his own bed. “Don’t worry, I’m only taking the piss.”
When the train finally pulled into Platform 9¾ it was already pitch black outside. When he disembarked the train, he was surprised to see Molly Weasley among the crowd of parents waiting for Harry and her other children. She barely gave Draco a passing glance as she approached their carriage, only for her round face to break out into a wide grin as she saw Harry exit the train.
“Isn’t there always?” said Liv wryly. She lowered her gaze and swirled the contents of her tankard as she spoke. “But then my dad got sick. I know I’ve told you a little about it already.”
Harry explained what had happened to Hermione when she had tried to eat one of Hagrid’s infamous rock cakes and showed Draco the offending item in question, having pocketed his own “for later” rather than attempt to eat it as Hermione had. Draco took the cake and inspected it closely.
Draco’s voice trailed and Harry cocked an eyebrow at him. “Is this a roundabout way of you saying thank you?”
“My grandmother wasn’t sick,” Jimmy Peakes shamefully admitted to Ritchie Cootes. “I bailed on you because I had a date with Sophie Roper and I didn’t want to miss it.”
“Count me in,” said Ron brightly.
Draco sighed and lowered his fork. “Mother, we don’t need to discuss this again. In fact, I’d rather not.”
“You’d rather talk to Ron about it?” she challenged.
“My feather definitely moved,” Ron argued as they filed out of the classroom at the end of the lesson. “Didn’t you see? I managed to push it off of the desk!”
“Fine,” Draco spat, raising his wand again. “Have it your way. Three...two…”
Harry was privately relieved to hear this. “Do you think you’ll ever tell your parents?”
“No sneaking off into the bushes you two!” Professor Grubbly-Plank called after them. “Head straight to the carriage waiting for you by the entrance gates. Chop chop!”
“Two weeks from Monday.”
Draco considered casting the Langlock Curse at Harry instead, but after taking a moment to seriously consider Harry’s offer he gave a curt nod in agreement.
Breaking the kiss, Draco experimentally nipped Harry’s plump bottom lip. That sent a pleasant spark of pain and pleasure straight to Harry’s groin and he instinctively tightened his grip on Draco’s lower back, digging his fingers into his soft skin.
“Yeah, practising the scene together would be really helpful,” he replied weakly. “Cheers, mate.”
Harry was breathing hard now, a look of mingled pain and pleasure painted across his face as inch by inch, Draco filled him up. When Draco was as deep as he could go, he carefully leaned forward to kiss Harry. Harry broke the kiss only long enough to tell Draco to move, and when Draco rolled his hips, Harry gasped and threw his head back against the pillow, overwhelmed by the intensity of the sensation. Draco paused then and asked, “Too much?”
“Potter might not care about who I am but other people will,” he argued. “He gets enough flak just for being friends with me, can you imagine what people would say if they caught us canoodling?”
“I also recall the organisation was famed for its disruption of authority,” Professor McGonagall continued. “All manner of disruptive behaviour broke out: dungbombs were released on a regular basis, rogue Nifflers caused significant damage to school property, there were also enchanted fireworks, if I remember rightly…”
Draco knew that he had been a spiteful child. When Harry had rejected his offer of friendship, it had crushed him. He had never been refused anything in his life up until that point and, in all honesty, Draco was ill-prepared to deal with the rejection. Little did he know just how many more times he would experience that in a few short years.
“I’m not scared!” Draco snapped.
Liv raised her eyebrows in surprise and took the proffered book. “You finished it already?”
“I should have known better than to expect any sympathy from you,” Harry muttered. Draco’s amused smile fell and he nudged Harry in the ribs.
Luna leaned forward and said in a stage whisper, “A Blibbering Humdinger!”
“But she’s talking to Nott!” he protested.
Harry put his hands on his hips and smirked. “I guess there’s only one way to find out.”
“You mean entirely to blame,” Ron insisted.
Despite his feelings, Draco hadn’t really seriously considered leaving Hogwarts. His plan was just to muddle through the next year as best he could (more because he wanted to get his parents off his back than for any great love of learning). But Professor Tonks, loath as Draco was to admit it, had raised some valid points. When Draco chose to apply himself, he was pretty good at most subjects. He knew that as a former Death Eater, his job prospects after graduating were limited but it would be a shame to waste his talents while he had the chance to use them. And so what if everyone hated him—that was nothing new—did he really want to give everyone the satisfaction of watching him scarpering out of Hogwarts with his tail between his legs? Wouldn’t it be much more satisfying to be a Billywig in their bonnet?
“Let a man dream, Hermione,” Ron sighed, his expression turning dreamy. “Eternal glory…”
When Harry told her that he and Luna wanted to paint over the graffiti covering her toilet, Myrtle squealed with delight and invited them inside.
“Destruction of property!” the goblin continued furiously. “And the loss of an incredibly valuable Ukrainian Ironbelly. The list goes on! Yet you saw fit to stroll in here as though none of that happened and request to make a withdrawal?”
“Not my problem,” she shrugged. “If I’m going to have any chance of achieving eight N.E.W.T.S. then I’m afraid that I’m going to be much too busy to help either of you this year. Maybe Ginny will be kind enough to help you out?”
“Are you still in touch with Mal?” asked Hestia.
“Yup,” said Hestia briskly. “It’s a tough old world out there. Shame things can’t be simpler, like they are in the pages of your Muggle books. Which reminds me…” She pulled Liv’s copy of
“Of course I’ve heard of Shakespeare, I’m not a philistine!” she replied hotly.
“Alright, everyone!” Hestia called to get the students’ attention. “Let’s take a break there, shall we?”
“That was easy,” he laughed.
They didn’t say anything else after that. Draco closed his eyes, hoping that sleep would take him. Slipping in and out between the edges of consciousness, his thoughts returned to the play they had seen earlier that evening and the unsettling parallels between it and his own life. As much as Harry argued that he didn’t care what anyone else thought about their relationship, Draco suspected that it would be a different matter entirely if he had the whole world telling him otherwise. And, if he were being perfectly honest with himself, a part of him was inclined to agree with the rest of the world. Where Harry was kind, honest and brave to the point of stupidity, Draco was selfish and cunning, and he had always prioritised his own wellbeing over everyone else's—well, most of the time, anyway. They were polar opposites in many ways and their relationship defied conventional logic, but for some reason beyond Draco’s understanding, he and Harry just...fit together, somehow. And Harry had said that he loved him—or thought that he loved him, at least—which had to count for something, surely? But Draco just wasn’t sure whether or not that was enough to weather the inevitable tempest that was on the horizon. He hoped it would be.
“Draco, dear, I made you a packed lunch,” Mrs Weasley said as she thrust a paper bag in Draco’s hands.
“It isn’t?” he asked cautiously and Ginny frowned at him.
“Since forever!” Hermione cried. “Why do you think she has posters of Gwenog Jones all over her bedroom walls?”
“Shit! Asha, are you okay?” he cried.
Draco paused and read over what he had written. Of course, he’d omitted some key details from the letter, like the fact that it was his Muggle Studies professor who had arranged for them to be performing a famous Muggle play. But Draco had learned long ago that what his parents didn’t know couldn’t hurt them. It wasn’t as though they’d ever see him perform in the play anyway. He also thought better than to mention the hassle he’d been receiving from the other students. The last thing that he needed was his mother marching up to McGonagall’s office and demanding action against the perpetrators. Besides, since he and Harry had started seeing each other, the bullying from the other students didn’t bother him nearly as much as it used to. Dipping his quill into ink, he continued to write.
“I’m not doing it,” Ron declared, brandishing his script in the air. “I don’t care what she says, there’s absolutely no way I’m acting in a stupid play.”
Ron looked like he wanted to argue but he pursed his lips and grudgingly shuffled a few inches to the right, followed by Harry, to create a space for Draco to sit. Draco sat down at the table with his hands by his sides, still feeling a little awkward at all of the eyes fixed on him. Still, he made the effort to turn to Ron and smirk.
Harry raised a surprised eyebrow at Draco. The one and only time Draco had previously attempted to engage in small talk with Harry was during their very first time meeting at Madam Malkin’s when they were eleven. That attempt had been as tactful as this one.
“Really?” asked Draco uncertainly.
Draco snorted. “It’s in the script, Harry. Unless you pop a boner during our kissing scene, I doubt anyone will think anything of it.”
Tom led Harry and the others out of the side exit, bypassing the bar completely, to the small, walled courtyard where the entrance to Diagon Alley was hidden. Harry pulled his Invisibility Cloak out of his backpack and slipped it over his head. Once Harry was hidden from view, Mrs Weasley tapped the wall three times with the tip of her wand and an archway into Diagon Alley slowly began to take shape.
Hermione looked furious at this admission. “You really are the pits, you know that?”
Draco pulled a face. “Why in the name of Merlin is Granger at our door at this godforsaken hour?”
“Spending time with Draco,” she said as casually as possible before adding, “He’s my friend, you know…”
“Don’t let it bite me!” Draco begged.
Suddenly Harry felt something soft and warm scurry over his hand and Draco snatched his hand away as though he had been electrified. Harry quickly withdrew his own hand in surprise, then looked down to find Asha sniffing interestedly around the front pocket of his trousers.
Myrtle smiled approvingly. “Exactly! What mum and dad don’t know can’t hurt them, eh? So, when are you and Harry hooking up again?”
Dennis let out an impatient sigh. “Why are you telling me all of this?”
Liv sighed in resignation. “Damn, you made that look so easy! I just know if I tried that I’d still mess it up somehow—what’s so funny?”
Liv strode towards Minerva, her hand already outstretched when suddenly she tripped over the hem of her long robes and stumbled forward. She barely managed to stop herself from falling flat on her face but the contents of the folder she was holding spilled all over the flagstone floor.
into the nearest bin. Just then, he spotted Luna further down the street exiting The Three Broomsticks carrying an armful of posters. Harry snatched one of the magazines out of the bin and hurried towards his kooky friend. “Luna!”
“This is perfect,” he declared.
Ron laughed. “So her lines are that she says ‘Madam’ twice. I think you two have been conned into doing all the hard work.”
“Hmm,” she smoothed out the lapel of his trenchcoat with the flat of her hand and noted, “I must say, the style is...quite unusual. Although, not entirely unpleasant to the eye. In fact, I’d say it rather suits you. Blinken!”
“Nargles?” said Draco. “What on earth are they?”
They slowed as they approached the bathroom and Harry turned to Luna. “I should warn you that Myrtle can be a little sensitive, particularly when it comes to the subject of her being dead. It’s a good thing that we’re wearing old clothes because when she’s in one of her more irritable moods, she’s prone to splashing toilet water all over the place.”
Hermione nodded slowly as though this merely confirmed her suspicions. “Then Draco’s parents will find out about you two eventually. Have you thought about what will happen then?”
Minerva nodded in understanding. After Voldemort’s return, a lot of parents had opted to send their children overseas to other institutions like Beauxbatons and Ilvermorny instead of Hogwarts. She fleetingly wondered how many parents would choose to do the same again this year.
“Hmm?” said Harry distractedly, watching Draco with mild panic as he plummeted towards the ground before pulling up at the last moment in a flawless demonstration of the Wronksi Feint manoeuvre. Myrtle tutted in annoyance at how distracted Harry was.
“Welcome, students, to a new year at Hogwarts,” she greeted them with her usual polite but firm manner. “I’m pleased to see so many familiar faces return.”
“Nice save, Ron,” Ginny joked but Hermione looked pleased by the sincerity of the compliment nonetheless. She hooked hers and Ron’s arms together and stood on her tiptoes to press a kiss to his cheek.
Umbridge’s slack mouth stretched into a false smile. “Good. Well, I’m here with important and exciting news for you, Miss Tonks: you’re getting a promotion.”
“What’s it to you?” he spat.
“I didn’t like keeping it from you and Ron, but it’s nice having some semblance of a private life for a change.”
Stepping out of the fireplace into the Leaky Cauldron, Harry was greeted by a stooped, bald man who gave him a wide, toothless grin.
In desperation, Harry raised his wand and pointed it at Draco.
“In a minute,” he said sleepily, his hand playing with the buttons of Draco’s shirt. “I think I might be ready for round two.”
Theo gritted his teeth and turned away from Draco, muttering under his breath, “This was pointless…”
“Don’t read too much into it, Potter. The Slytherin Dungeon is much closer and I don’t fancy climbing several flights of stairs again,” Draco reasoned. “Honestly, I don’t know how your lot do that every day; it felt like we were making our ascent to the Mountains of the Moon. Besides, most people will be out at Hogsmeade today, so we’ll probably have the dormitory to ourselves.”
“Yeah, I’ve been told that once or twice.”
“It’s an advertisement for the play.”
“Very funny,” she replied flatly. Shaking her head, she shouted over her shoulder into the bedroom. “They’re here—
“Oh god, yes,” Harry gasped, thrusting his hips forward into Draco’s tight fist. “Tell me, please…”
“There’s the chance you’ve been looking for, mate,” he whispered excitedly.
“Good morning!” she greeted him brightly.
They watched in silence as Liv slid off of her desk and placed a large slice of birthday cake onto a plate, then followed her as she marched across the room towards one of the private offices at the opposite end of the room. Liv tripped over the leg of one of the office chairs and almost dropped the cake in the process, but she managed to steady herself before knocking politely on one of the private office doors before entering. Minerva and Liv followed her inside and were met with what appeared to be a solid wall of parchment. Upon closer inspection, there was a desk underneath the precariously balanced piles of loose papers and folders. Sitting behind the desk, hidden behind the mountains of paperwork, was a small, serious-looking woman with large, square-rimmed glasses who Minerva recognised to be her friend and old work colleague, Myra Curio.
“You’re not going to be the only one seeing thestrals this year,” Harry reminded him. “I imagine quite a few people saw them for the first time tonight.”
“You!” he hissed. His beetle-black eyes darted between Harry, Ron and Hermione. “The three of you! What are you doing here?”
“Anyone who believes anything that The Prophet has to say at face value is a fool,” he declared.
“Not until June.”
Ron was silent for a long time before giving Harry the slightest of nods. “Okay.”
So, Seamus and Dean were an item. Once the momentary shock of this discovery subsided, Harry supposed that it wasn’t that surprising. They had always been close friends and being separated during the war must have been difficult for them. He wondered if they would tell anyone but quickly told himself that it was none of his business. It seemed like everyone had someone: Ron and Hermione, Neville and Luna, and now, Seamus and Dean. Everyone except Harry, who was doomed to be eternally alone, it seemed. Perhaps it was for the best, he thought miserably. However lonely it got, things were definitely less complicated this way. At least he didn’t have to worry about disappointing anyone if there was nobody to disappoint.
