There’s a squeak, and Blaise’s shocked gasp follows. “Morgana’s tits, are those trees? Wait, that’s moss—is that a baby Devil’s Snare? Pansy!”
“What a possessive alpha… I kinda like it when you’re territorial…”
Malfoy didn’t say a thing. He didn’t even move. He looked like he was about to flee, but Harry took his time to really look at him.
does he need, exactly, to fuck you?”
. As his belly grew in size with their twins, Draco got more and more tired, to the point where there were permanent dark circles under his eyes. Draco was also moody and whiney, but Harry decided he had to suffer from it if Draco had to go all the nine months with two babies in his belly.
He grimaces and kicks a small rock, sending it flying into the frozen grass bordering the path. There’s no lying to Luna. “It’s not really—I’m fine, but I did something stupid.” Harry does have a tendency to be depressed. He had no idea what was happening to him after the war, once his only purpose in life had been fulfilled, but his Mind Healer—mandatory if he wanted to join the Aurors—was extremely helpful. Harry took potions at first, then he learned to deal with his emotions because he was stubborn and hated relying on anything and anyone to fight on his behalf. Sometimes, he loses the battle. It’s never a dramatic fall; he doesn’t have dark thoughts, he never did. It’s almost impossible to explain his mindset to someone who never experienced it, but he finds solace in Luna’s presence, because she understands. She visited him in Ahvaz, and each time, it was when Harry needed someone’s presence to feel
Two days later, at the very same pub and while Pansy was in the loo, Potter came over to him where he was sat at the bar. It took Draco so by surprise he could only blink at first, helpless not to glance down at the usual tight T-shirt snug around his arms and torso, and then at his mouth, curled up into a grin.
company,” Ron said, looking at his brother as if he was stupid. “They’ll match people for preferences and personality through magical scanning. Who’s the only other person who’s as fucked up in the head as Harry is? No offense, mate.”
been in the family for generations) trembled and squeaked and battered the wall.
There are other recent portraits in the Manor, framed by branches. Harry doesn’t understand how portrait magic works, how the person’s essence can be captured after they’re long gone. The artist said it was easier for some, if they left a significant mark on close friends or family members. That’s why Harry is able to converse with his mum and dad now. That’s why Sirius keeps hopping away to Andi’s house to visit Remus and Tonks’ canvas. Regulus stays in his frame as much as possible, or he spends time with Narcissa, because if he goes to Grimmauld Place he gets stuck talking to Kreacher all day (the elf moved back in after his magic detected the existence of Poor Master Regulus’ portrait). Even a portrait gets tired. There’s also a portrait of a white wolf with golden eyes accompanied by his best friend, an extra-fluffy emerald-eyed Socotra Cormorant with feathers that refuse to lie flat. If Draco ever achieves his own Animagus form, it’ll join their canvas. He and Harry hope it’ll be a bird, so they can fly after the Snitch together. No matter how magical paintings actually function, Harry’s delighted to have them in his home.
The discreet glow that had started up died out when he came back to reality. Who would marry him ? Being a husband necessitated a spouse. Being a father necessitated a child.
That was the first outright negative reaction Draco had received to his being transgender. He had known it could happen - would happen, considering who he was and how much people would probably want to hurt him - but he wasn’t prepared for the wave of self-disgust that resulted. He knew himself, was sure of who he was, knew that being himself was the right thing to do for himself. And yet. He couldn’t help the doubt and the contempt that filtered in the dark recesses of his mind.
And then there was the War.
“They’re letting you represent Britain internationally ? Have they lost their minds ? It’s your first year as a pro ! The team is really going for the fame factor…” He shook his head. “ You disappoint me Harry. I didn’t think you’d go along with it.”
Draco couldn’t stop himself from answering sarcastically.
“Hum, no, Malfoy, you’re actually shining.”
Huh ? Did the Saviour have a crush on him or something ?
“You can do much better than that, Draco. Don’t they know you suffered too ? Or do they not care ?”
“And what are you drinking, Harry ?”
“I’m doing nothing ! This is all for me ! I do everything for me !” He shouted. “What do you see in me that you could misunderstand how selfish I always am ?”
“It’s not your responsibility alone, Harry. If I want to be accurate, all of us who survived the war should work to make sure another one doesn’t happen in the near future.” he waited for Potter to meet his gaze before he continued. “I don’t know how much I can do before I’m chased out, but I’m trying. At the very least, I can choose a spouse that doesn’t drool over my Mark.”
━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━◦○◦━
Potter cocked his head, not unlike a dog. Draco fought a smile.
Ah, that dramatic eye roll would be more effective if Draco’s face wasn’t so pink. “We’re not fucking in the dining room. Come with me.”
Typical Potter, really.
Harry laughed, shaking his head.
will take care of me. I trust your judgement and I know you’ll always have my back. Not being in control is the only way I can experience
Malfoy pauses and his shoulders sag. It’s easy to miss. “I can’t leave. The Manor won’t let me—I’m part of it and it’s part of me. Surely you can see that.”
“You — what?” he said, sounding slightly dazed. “I thought you said …”
“After years of only seeing each other in the Prophet columns,” Draco completed, and Harry looked at him with wide eyes. “Don’t need to pretend. I know you read the papers about me. Everybody does. And I did read about you, too. Once again,
Draco laughed. He couldn’t tell if it was meant to be a joke or not, and it didn’t really matter since it sent Draco into a tailspin of arousal either way. He unzipped Potter’s flies and, meeting no resistance, tugged them down his hips just enough that Draco could get a good look at the tent in his boxers.
Draco collected a box that was filled with blue and pink fabric triangles. He handed a triangle for each person together with a fabric pen.
And, as if to punish Draco for a very smooth pregnancy, his labour was the toughest 25 hours of his life.
The back of his mouth is scratchy, and he’s about to weep. He needs to occupy his mind, and lounging on his bed is not helpful, so he gets up and Apparates to the greenhouse without bothering to change. Mother would be furious, he thinks as the first clump of wet soil dirties his robes.
There’s a painful knot in Draco’s throat now. Fuck, but he misses them. It’s his own choice, too, so he only has himself to blame, but he had to do it. They can’t know he’s still alive. It’s easier. If they find out, they’ll discover he’s a Werewolf, and they’ll shun him. He hopes they’re happy and healthy.
“What did you do?” Hermione hisses, frazzled, her eyes huge. Harry’s guilt lurks under the surface; he should have told her earlier. She spent so long helping him, losing sleep over it, until Harry told her to let it lie, and she’d felt like a failure.
Harry frowned, better positioning himself between Draco’s legs and supporting himself on his hands, that were on the sides of Draco’s head.
“Where is it you’re going?” she said, making Potter whip around to look at her. Her steely gaze moved to him and she looked him up and down candidly, not bothering to hide her scepticism.
“Well,” said Draco unsteadily, sitting up on his knees and shifting to face Potter while his come leaked out of his arse, “that’s —”
, and I don’t want it back. I kept planning and doing all these parties because I
that Draco is not in Azkaban. Potter is still annoying, and as a kid he humiliated Draco because he didn’t care who Draco’s family was, and what a terrible blow to Draco’s pride that had been. But more than that, Potter was Draco’s gay awakening. A tragedy at the time. Draco blames the Triwizard Tournament, more specifically Potter’s insane plan to get past the Hungarian Horntail. He tried denying it afterwards, but Theo, Pansy and Blaise saw right through him. Draco spent most of his fourth year avoiding their hare-brained schemes to find him a boyfriend, and a good portion of fifth year being teased mercilessly because Potter was such a little shit and his witty comebacks to Snape and Umbridge made Draco swoon.
“I’m not going to make you feel fuller of yourself than you already are,” Draco turned himself to the mirror so he’d finish preparing himself for the party and Harry kissed his head, making Draco smile.
“I do
“What did she say?”
When the Manor’s magic signals that Potter is gone, Draco’s composure crumbles. He rushes upstairs, half-running, half-carried by the movement of the stairs, and heads to the west wing. The roots that could trip him get out of the way, sinking into the floor as he approaches, and the door to his quarters opens on its own. He stops running once he’s standing in the middle of his bedroom. Black dots swim in his field of vision and the back of his throat burns as he blinks back the tears burning his eyes and breathes in quick gasps. It’s only his upbringing that allowed him to act unconcerned, to offer tea to the first person he’s seen in
On the beginning of the fifth month, Draco walked into Harry’s office and sat on his lap as if there weren’t other chairs available. Harry didn’t mind, stopping what he was doing, and cuddling Draco against his body. He was the perfect size to be there, and Harry didn’t have any complaints. He moved Draco so he was resting on Harry’s arm, sitting on his side, and Harry moved his other hand, slowly playing with his nipple, which grew hard instantly under his fingers.
“Well, he is, just a messy one!” Draco sighed, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder as he looked around their living room. There were seven portraits on the wall. Right on top of the fireplace there was a big portrait of Harry and Draco together, both seated in their comfy armchair. They’ve opted for non-moving portraits as Harry found a bit weird to look at himself moving in their living room.
“It’s very old wood,” Draco explained, inventing something haphazardly, “so I can’t use magic on it; too fragile, you know? But the frame’s falling apart. I’d get a new one but it’s been in the family for centuries.”
He’s standing in a dim forest. Trees have burst through the marble floor and encased the walls, furniture and Roman-style columns in heavy wooden frames, growing all around them, letting the stone appear through cracks or curves. Twisted roots have dislodged the tiles and there’s grass and bioluminescent mushrooms and flowers growing in every crack, thriving out of the cold weather outside these walls. The vaulted ceiling is covered in an ever-expanding web of branches, turning the entire hallway into a canopy. Some of these trees have leaves; most do not. Harry lets out a breath he didn’t realise he was holding as he spots fireflies dancing in the air. Nature took over the house as if it had been abandoned for thousands of years. It’s an entire ecosystem powered by magic instead of sunlight, and Harry is in awe.
They looked at each other, focusing in their eyes as the healer performed the spell and checked him on a huge, Muggle machine. They warned her that they were doing a gender reveal and she was instructed to write down the information in a piece of paper, which would be given to Hermione.
“Clothes off,” Harry ordered, and Draco did a fast job of undressing himself.
as well.
After a moment, Harry looked like he'd gotten himself under control a bit better, and dried his tears with his hands.
Draco winked at Harry, and the alpha felt like he could cry. He hugged Draco against his body, scenting his neck and caressing his protruding belly, feeling their babies move about inside him.
As he passed close to Potter’s table on the way towards the exit, Draco deliberately let his wallet drop and held his breath.
“Well… Other than you’re Harry Potter and you hate my guts, we look like we would do really good together,” Draco said, and Harry shook his head negatively.
“Harry…! Harry…!” Draco gasped, and Harry pulled him away from the wall, carrying him to their bedroom.
“Yeah, I know. But Blaise is the worst of us.”
“Go on,” Harry gave permission, observing how Draco instinctively spread his legs to give Harry room.
“Have you ever had a bloke suck you off before, Potter?”
Grinning, Harry rests his arms around his husband’s neck. They’re behind a thick tree in the back garden, and the Faerie orbs are back, in smaller quantities. Harry wonders if they followed them here to keep an eye on them. “So, happy?”
“Never mind,” Draco said, grinning again. “D’you want something to drink?”
“You’re not gonna hurt me!” Draco snapped, at the edge of his patience. His cock was throbbing painfully, leaking pre-come onto his expensive sheets. His thighs shook with the effort of keeping still. “Fuck me already, you great bloody oaf!”
“They’re bored; don’t be an arse, apologise.”
Teddy clapped him on his shoulder and they left to the large backyard, where the ceremony would happen.
He leaves the bed when his bladder reminds him of its presence. There’s a toothbrush and toothpaste in the en-suite, and Harry’s clothes are hung beside the sink, clean and—yep, stitched up. He meant to fix that hole in his jeans but each time he tried it with magic, it came back, so he stopped. It’s obvious he gained the approval of the elves after he refused to leave yesterday. He remembers Remus, that’s all there was to it. He would have stayed even without the kiss. Malfoy shouldn’t be alone after a full moon anymore, not now that he doesn’t have to.
Ron has been a stay-at-home dad since Rose’s birth, sometimes helping George at the shop, but mostly baby-sitting everyone’s kids now that Hugo and Rose have grown. When he spots Harry’s head in the Floo, he grins and sits cross-legged on the blue carpet. His apron proclaims him Head Chef Dad and there are purple stains all over it.
“I don’t care! I can’t believe this. AH!” She yelps, and there is a shuffling sound. “It touched me!”
Until the day that changed it all.
Draco lowers the pillow and clutches it against his chest, glancing at the elf. She has purple eyes narrowed in disapproval and looks like a bat with her translucent ears. “I had a visitor,” he explains, because he doesn’t know what else to say, and any sentence longer than that would break his voice. He clenches and unclenches his fists. They’re still shaking.
“Draco, we’re already having a baby shower. Why do you need
“I like being full of your come, anyways… Then, I want you to fuck me with your knot… In front of the mirror… And I want to see your come oozing out of me when you take it off…”
“I can’t concentrate, and this is serious,” Draco explained, moving on his lap so he was straddling Harry. He touched the alpha’s face, kissing his lips softly and smiling against Harry’s mouth. “I’m pregnant.”
as a bisexual icon, and at the time it led to Draco blurting out the truth about himself to his mother. That was an awkward conversation. But making the leap from “Potter likes cock” to “Potter might want to get into Draco’s pants” is something Draco has only ever considered in his dreams.
“You have your own account in which I deposit funds every month. You know you can take that money whenever you want.”
And the list went on. Harry couldn’t stop smiling as he saw the messages.When the bunting was ready, they all congratulated both the parents on the baby, and they moved on to the part that everyone had been waiting for.
Fair. Draco wonders if she possesses the Sight, which would explain quite a lot about her interesting statements in school. A Faerie orb lands on Potter’s nose and Draco lets out a loud snort which has the effect of dissolving the tension in a heartbeat.
All the Weasleys at the table looked from Hermione to Harry, waiting for his answer. He sighed, knowing it was no use to lie to them. He
Malfoy doesn’t move. “Potter, I wish I could answer you, but I don’t know what you want.”
Once their names were signed, and Draco was officially a Potter, they turned to the Registrar, who had his wand raised. They showed their left hand, and the man performed the bond spell. Harry closed his eyes, feeling his strong connection with Malfoy. It wasn’t as strong he thought it’d be – maybe because they didn’t love each other – but it was… Warm. It completed him like he hadn't known it would.
would hex him. This one… doesn’t. “How thoughtful of you to ask,” he sneers instead. “Are you entirely unable to let things lie?”
They step over the edge of the property together and nothing happens. Biting his lower lip, Harry turns around and draws Draco in for a hug, smiling when Draco hugs back with enough strength to make him wheeze. They both need a moment. Harry’s eyes are prickling with relieved tears and his neck is wet where Draco’s face is resting. He runs a hand through Draco’s hair, messing up the white-blond strands and lightly scratching his scalp with his fingernails, slow and steady.
“I don’t see anything wrong,” said Potter when he took him into his bedroom. Just
antique and
“I assure you, Potter, it’s not Alchemy,” he said. “Now get your jeans off.”
“If anyone is as fucked up as you, it makes sense that it
Harry looked at Draco, who had a deep flush to his cheeks. He swallowed hard, putting the band back on his finger, and so did Harry.
“I understand. So, this is what we’re going to do, okay? We’re going to have our baby shower, and you can plan this party as you see fit. No more than 60 guests though, okay? You’re pregnant and parties are always stressful, I don’t want you to exert yourself,” Draco smiled, and nodded, waiting for Harry to continue. “As for the Gender Reveal party, you can have that as well.
Harry was preparing himself in front of the mirror when his Godson came in his bedroom in his home in Taunton’s countryside. He wanted to live near the Weasleys, but only close enough so their privacy could be guaranteed. It was good because he was also near Wiltshire, so both he and Draco would be near their families. Draco was moving in with Harry, of course, and he’d already packed everything and brought it in the past few days. It wasn’t much in terms of furniture, but Draco
“Delicious…” Harry growled, licking his chest up to his neck, then moving them again, now Draco on his back as he nestled between his spread legs. “Now I’m going to fuck you deep, my little bitch. I’m going to fuck your tight pink pussy until the only thing you can remember is the slide of my cock inside of you. I’m going to make you my broodmare, and I’m going to come so much inside of you there’s no way you'll not be carrying my pups inside you once I’m done.”
“I guess you want to know what I’m seeing,” Potter says, tilting his head. “You have scars—that’s great, I have them too.” His finger drops to Draco’s torso and traces the oldest, cleanest marks. “Those are from me, and I’m sorry—”
Harry’s heart broke in tiny million pieces, his anger simmering down as he saw a single tear running down Draco’s cheek.
The door doesn’t budge. It’s tiring to hold out his hands like that, so Harry adds, “Please?” and tries to bury his impatience. “I need to know if he’s all right.” It’s not even a lie. Most people would think him insane; they’ve never been friends, they’ve barely exchanged a nod after the trials, and it’s just good sense, really, to forget about a kid Harry hated at school—a kid who belonged to a blood-supremacist group. Malfoy’s beliefs at the time still made him a dangerous extremist no matter if he was a child or not.
Potter at least had the brains to blush. “No, I mean … you mean …” He saw Potter’s Adam’s apple bob. “I’ve never … with a bloke … I dunno …”
What else can Draco do but tell Potter he’ll give it a go?
have a lot of trinkets and clothing. And books. So many books.
“That’s very domestic of them,” said Draco, wrinkling his nose a bit. Potter gave him an odd, searching look.
“Scared, Malfoy?”
Potter took and took and took, pounding into Draco and chasing his own orgasm. When he shifted his angle and started nudging up against Draco’s prostate, he cried out weakly, “Right there! Right there, right there, don’t stop, oh god, don’t stop …”
“Here is the information you’ll need for the party,” the healer said, handing them the envelope. She had such a big smile that Harry wondered if Draco was pregnant with the next Minister for Magic. “With the help of this Muggle machine we used, I even managed to put in an ultrasound picture for you. As far as I can see, your pregnancy is a healthy one, the sizing and the time are both correct, and you should be good to have your party. I suggest you do it before the six month mark, though. Parties tend to be stressful and having one of those later in the pregnancy can lead to an early arrival.”
“Would you please leave? I was busy.”
“Ronald!” Was Hermione’s outraged remark, and Ron just shook his head as everybody at the table started to talk at the same time. Harry knew better than to try and speak above the Weasleys, so he just nodded at Ron.
“I… Really couldn’t care less. You know that.”
“I … no,” he said hoarsely.
?” Pansy said when Potter had left, giving her one last uncertain glance. “What
“Oh, come on, Potter. It’s our wedding night. We’re not supposed to be talking,” Draco said, exasperated, and Harry stared at him, frowning.
“You don’t like that sort of thing?”
“I’m not really sure what to talk about.”
The place had been organised for the party, but the ceremony itself was going to be less than 10 minutes in length. They didn’t have much to say to each other, they barely knew each other past their school rivalry and shared sexual preferences. They hadn’t even kissed or hugged since they decided to marry, only talking to each other about what clothes should they wear, and what flavour they wanted the cake to be.
“It wasn’t my idea, but what do you expect with Pansy around?” Harry isn’t angry that his party didn’t go the way it should have; the plan was to spend time with his friends with wonderful food and some wine. He’s not a party animal, neither is Draco. Hermione realised what would happen when she saw the guest list and prepared a cauldron-full of hangover potion, then took care of the music, because she’s known for her appropriate choices. She sent Rose and Hugo to the Burrow for the night, and Rose didn’t even complain since a party for adults
“It’s interesting… How it took me months to noticed I loved your other father… But it took me a second to know I love you both,” Harry whispered to his babies, running his wrist on both of their little cheeks to mark them both with his scent.
“I didn’t realise you were here with —”
Merlin, his position is uncomfortable. He’s getting too old for this. His knees hate him. Perhaps he can fight his house to get a phone to work later, but right now, there’s something much more important to discuss. “Cold. Funny story,” he says, and no, it’s not funny at all. “What’s Malfoy up to these days?”
“Have it your way, then,” Pansy said airily. “Just don’t come crying to
This is so stupid, yet so unexpected, and Harry finds himself doing exactly that. The vines disappear under the moss, and Harry finally decides he’s had enough of rolling in the dirt. He stands up. His brain tells him to go home; he’s seen Malfoy, he got what he wanted. But that’s the problem: he did see him, and now he needs to know
, stupid.”
Harry traces the thin threads on the tapestry, blinking back visions he worked hard to forget. His fingers follow the line between Narcissa and her husband, then down to Draco, who is smirking deviously and looks very much like a more refined version of Sirius.
“It means that I want to touch you sexually because it makes me feel good, but it doesn’t mean that I want it to lead to sex. It just calms me, makes me feel grounded.”
“…Is a meaningful, beautiful name. Follows the Black tradition as well.”
The ginger pieces are placed in a bowl that Potter slides towards Draco. “Gossip,” he ponders aloud, seeming to give it some thoughts. “Goyle married my cousin.”
“Then let’s do it, then!”
. Draco’s mouth opened in an ‘0’ shape, his eyes rolling back as Harry moved inside, bit by bit, until he couldn’t move in any further. His hips were flush against Draco, and his omega’s cunt was squeezing him, as if trying to suck him deeper. He held Draco by his waist, sliding out and thrusting in again, slowly at the beginning, then going harder, faster.
His large hands steadied Draco’s hips, still sinking inside even when Draco thought for sure he’d reached maximum capacity. He curled his fingers in the sheets and tried to relax his body, to make room for Potter to keep filling him up, and finally, with a little groan of mingled relief and arousal, he felt Potter’s hips and knew it was over.
Lucius’ body was found in such a state that Ron still has nightmares, but Narcissa haunts Harry, because she fought back, right in front of the door to her son’s bedroom, and it wasn’t enough. Greyback died from the wounds she inflicted on him—and he took her child with him.
Narcissa and Molly smiled at him, the Weasley mother drying a tear from under her eye.
Once a family loses their elves, they will not get any more, unless they obtain them from another family. But after Mother and Father’s death and the transformation of the Manor, Draco suddenly found himself surrounded by excited creatures eager to start over. He wasn’t fool enough to dismiss them. Tipsy is their leader and acts like a persistent parent intent on keeping Draco healthy and well-fed.
“I was there that night.” Harry’s throat is dry. He finishes his tea, but it doesn’t help.
It’s some time later that the pull of the moon tears a scream from his throat, and his human consciousness fades. When he wakes up, there’s a distinct lack of Arctic’s presence in his mind. The wolf is asleep. He won’t rouse for at least two weeks unless Draco speaks to him, which he has previously done to fight his loneliness. Cushioned by the moss, Draco assesses the damage to his body. Arctic is a good wolf who doesn’t bite or scratch himself on purpose, but accidents happen. Once he’s certain he isn’t bleeding, he rolls onto his side and pushes himself up. The tremors in his muscles are close to unbearable; his jaw is clenched so tight he risks chipping the enamel off his teeth. The walk to the small cabinet makes him pant, and he needs to take a break to breathe, but his salvation is right there in his hand and he smiles as he drinks the potion that tastes like charcoal. He exhales loudly and rests against the wall, eyes closed, until the pain is fully gone.
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!” Draco’s hands gripped Harry’s hair, pushing him against his chest, his cunt gushing out slick. “Oh, Haaaarry…! I’m coming, I’m coming, fuck me, I’m c-coomiiing…!”
, Roniekins?”
“I figured,” Harry smiled back. “Still, it just isn’t my thing. And I’m happy when you’re happy, but I don’t feel comfortable being there with your friends yet, that’s all. It doesn’t mean I don’t love your presence or that our relationship is growing cold. We just have different interests and that’s normal. I mean, Hermione is scared of heights. Ron is addicted to Quidditch. It’s not fair for him to expect her to participate in the games, but it wouldn’t be fair either if she asked him to stop it, right?”
“You want to fuck me twice a day?”
“You told Lovegood.” Draco is not impressed, but he has no more anger left.
A bitter laugh is stuck in Draco’s throat now. What the hell, Young Draco has nothing to feel bad about. He still has his parents. He still has friends.
” Draco chanted, his cunt squeezing Harry inside, triggering his own orgasm after making Draco come three times that night. He came, and came, and came, his knot locking them together, but he never stopped moving, fucking Draco with his knot, droplets of his own come sliding out.
your omega, though?” George asked, pointing at Harry with a fork.
“Cut the caaaake!” Ron cheered, and Harry rolled his eyes, positioning himself with Draco so they could cut the cake and finally know whether they were having a boy or a girl. Everybody cheered as they held the knife, Draco’s hand under Harry’s on the handle. Excitedly, they cut off a piece, expecting to see either pink or blue, but…
“How was—”
Harry stomps on the urge to book a Portkey back to Ahvaz. When his gaze meets Malfoy’s, he sees a hint of realisation, quickly concealed under his Pureblood mask.
Draco doesn’t turn around but a tiny smile quirks the corner of his lips and his shoulders drop. He imagines Tipsy’s toothy grin and hears the popping sound of her disappearance when he doesn’t reply.
“Hey, Teddy,” he called his godson, who was a bit sloshed, grinning way too much. Harry rolled his eyes, grabbing the tall young man by his shoulder, and pointing to Narcissa with his chin. She was sitting at her table, looking a bit lonely. “That’s your great-aunt Cissa. You know her, right? Do you think you can get Andy to invite her home for tonight? Maybe for breakfast too?”
Draco knows Potter is included in the “important and rich people” list. He quickly adds the eggs to his cauldron and when the mixture is just right, he transfers it into ten different vials, a whirlwind of thoughts running through his head. He breathes in through his nose and exhales slowly. “I’ll donate.” Fuck it, he’ll donate everything he has if needed.
Potter sat down on the stool next to Draco’s and asked again : “What brings you around all week-ends, then ?”
Draco laughed. He could feel some tears form in his eyes.
Draco turned around, on his guard. He didn’t exactly relax at the reveal of who had called him out, but he allowed himself a breath. Ronald Weasley probably wouldn’t kill him in broad daylight.
One step closer to Draconis.
Draco all but missed the fall of Potter’s smile before it was fixed back on his face. What was that about ?
Malfoy nodded, serious, his hands trembling, his omega smell reaching Harry, proving that Malfoy stopped to control them. He smelt like jasmine with a pinch of citrus.
When their portrait was unveiled, Draco scoffed and demanded to know what the artist was thinking, turning him into the equivalent of a Veela. It took Harry, Pansy, Luna, Theo, Blaise, Gin, Greg, Hermione, hell even Ron and Teddy, and many Polaroid pictures before Draco agreed that, perhaps, that was what he truly looked like.
“Depends,” he said vaguely. He was thinking not of going on dates with the gorgeous idiot before him but rather being trapped beneath him on his bed, or perhaps bent over the arm of the sofa if they couldn’t make it that far. It was, he reflected, a good thing Granger and Weasley weren’t here right now — it would be much easier to try and make this happen.
“No, Draco. Enough! I’ve allowed you to have as many tea parties as you wanted, I even agreed to the damn gender reveal party, but this is too much!” Harry stood up, looking down at Draco, who was still staring at him as if Harry had grown a second head. “You have nothing to prove to anyone, Draco.
“And we also wouldn’t be happy if our baby didn’t have the support of our families. You are all here because
“It’s okay,” Draco said, although his voice was tiny, merely above a whisper. “I got carried away. And… You were right. I was just… I mean, my life was so
Even those who’d campaigned for life sentences when the Malfoys got off with house arrest and community service agreed they didn’t deserve to die like this. There were no bodies to bury; the Manor activated ancient preservation wards when the Aurors temporarily left the scene, preventing anyone from going back inside—turning itself into a grave as the Malfoy line ended.
“The what?” said Potter, looking to Draco in confusion. Draco merely glared at Pansy.
Harry smiled, knowing deep inside that Draco Malfoy was perfect, utterly perfect for him. He ticked all the boxes, including the most important one of them all.
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure we can.”
Except three whole weeks before Draco’s due date, their boys decided they wanted
Teen Harry would insist. Today’s Harry is less prone to that kind of stupidity, and he recognises that unlike many times in their youth, Malfoy isn’t issuing him a challenge. He’s uncomfortable, genuinely angry, and hurt. Harry wasn’t supposed to know that Malfoy is a hermit who cut himself off from everyone he ever knew, but he still shouldn’t have asked so soon. He’s strongly reminded that he’s overstayed his welcome, so he mutters an apology and leaves without paying attention to Malfoy’s reply. He hears the sound of porcelain shattering before he Apparates out of the hallway, as impolite as it is.
understood Draco. He finally got why he would give it up so easily on the decisions. What was freeing for Harry, wasn’t the same for Draco, and he had hurt his mate because he was scared of giving Draco what he needed. He moved, hugging his husband and scenting his neck, caressing Draco’s back and letting himself just feel him.
Harry freezes. “I don’t think so.” That’s a valid question. “The tapestry says he’s alive.” He reads Ron’s flabbergasted expression and concludes he didn’t know that either. “We confirmed it was his body, right?”
“I didn’t say I wasn’t.”
“What am I? Chopped liver?” Charlie asked from the other end of the table.
“That’s my favourite part, too,” Harry said, and guided Draco to a settee, sitting by his side. “Are you willing to be stuck to me forever until death do us apart?”
“If Grimmauld is somehow sentient enough to allow such a transformation, you should pack your things and run. It’s not the sort of house you want to stay in as it is, imagine what it would do with a brain.” Draco shudders at the thought. He dispels the Stasis Charm and cranks up the heat under the copper cauldron. “Muscle relaxant,” he says when Potter peers at the sludge that Draco will drink tomorrow. “Since you’re here, slice some ginger in tiny cubes.” Luckily the measurements don’t need to be precise. Merlin knows Potter can’t follow instructions to save his life. His eyebrows rise when he sees Potter holding the correct ingredient. “Well, look at that, you actually know something!”
“Really?” he said. “Are you … are you sure, Potter? I wouldn’t dream of imposing.”
“Here,” Potter said, grabbing one of Draco’s pillows and tossing it onto the floor. “You should use that for your knees, shouldn’t you?”
Potter’s grin is shark-like. “I cook a lot with ginger.”
They do make it work.
It was innocent, after all. Until one day where Draco knocked on his office’s door a few hours before the usual tea party, his eyes big and begging.
For no reason in particular other than Potter looking especially good, Draco didn’t immediately break eye contact tonight. They stared at one another from across the pub, Potter surrounded by people, Draco in a corner with Pansy, steadily turning red, letting heat pool in his belly in spite of his very public location.
"Tea?" Draco offered. "Coffee? Pumpkin juice? Water?"
Draco adds the Acromantula venom to his bubbling cauldron, ignoring the sound of the knife cutting the ginger root in what must surely be uneven pieces. If his potion turns into tar, he can blame his improvised Potion assistant, and he almost hopes it’ll happen. He’d have a perfect excuse to dump the content of his cauldron onto Potter’s infuriating hair. “Yes, but you’re not. Go on, Potty, I am bored to tears and in dire need of gossip; entertain me.”
“Am I — what?”
“I’m gonna come again, I’m gonna come—
Draco lets go of his hand and steps forward, then calls out, “Didn’t your parents teach you to greet your guests?”
, Harry figured that he would really have enjoyed going out on a date with him.
Draco’s wish came faster than they were planning.
“What do you mean?”
“You look handsome,” Teddy said, his hair turquoise with blond streaks today. He was wearing a suit too, and it looked fit on his slender, tall body. At 19, Teddy looked so much like Remus that Harry’s heart ached a little bit every time he looked at his Godson.
He starts pacing while he waits for his potion to turn orange. He hates it, but he’s still preoccupied. Potter won’t let this go. He’ll come back, probably without sending an owl. Arctic prances at the idea.
He’s about to sit up when he remembers why he’s not at Grimmauld Place. With a loud groan, he raises the blanket over his head and blinks in the darkness, his eyelashes brushing against the fabric. That fucking kiss. It was awkward, with too much teeth and the telltale sign of inexperience, but it ignited something in Harry that he can only remember facing once or twice in his life. It has the intensity of a Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor, because Malfoy was his only true competition as a Seeker. It’s similar to their old spats, without the goal of causing pain. It’s hate turned to something else, and it burns in all the best ways. He doesn’t understand why Malfoy kissed him, or why his body reacted so quickly, why he wanted nothing more but to run after him and get him out of these tight robes, but it’s not a giant leap. It’s always been ridiculous and fiery between them. Harry finds it funny that they already have a routine three days after meeting for the first time in so many years, and it’s been completely natural. They fell into it as if the habit was ingrained. Is that how they would have acted, had they been friends at Hogwarts? Fighting without malice, because it’s exhilarating and fun? Back then, Harry kept thinking about Malfoy’s hair and eyes, so no, it’s absolutely not a leap that it led to a powerful attraction once Harry figured out he wasn’t straight. The timing sucked. Now Harry is glad to be single.
Their oldest five kids were arranged by age, as they usually did when Draco wanted to talk to them. Their youngest, number six – at the moment – was in Lily’s arms as the girl stood beside Scorpius.
Harry looked at his face, wondering how the hell he managed to reach 36 looking like he was still in his twenties. There was nothing out of place on Draco Malfoy, although he had a kind of hardness in his eyes that Harry could recognise in everyone that has been in the war.
obeying, to an extent Harry found surprising.
“Guys, Draco’s here!” Theo yells, attracting the attention of the few stragglers who are still far away. There are mutters about bad jokes until everyone figures out he’s telling the truth, and soon it’s a human wave dragging Draco with them towards the table and leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione behind.
Harry thought he did a good job of being a dad to Teddy. He’d do a good job being a dad to his own children, as well, he decided.
“Hello, fiancé,” Draco greeted him.
“You couldn’t spare two minutes to look presentable?”
Instead of rising to the bait, Draco rolled his eyes. “There are two wizarding pubs in London,” he said, tearing his eyes from Potter to look at her. “And seeing as neither of us is yet old enough to be having a midlife crisis, we’re obviously not going to be patronising the Leaky. Anyway, if I feel like indulging myself I don’t see why it’s such a crime.”
Surprise flickers on the Golden Boy’s face. “Huh, I’m not up-to-date on all of them. I mean, Gin sent me a monthly list of gossip because they thought I wanted to hear that crap, not that I did, and I’m probably mixing things up—”
“Oh, come on, Draco! James is a good name. Traditional, simple, he’ll learn to write it about the time he’s four with no trouble.
“I’m a Death Eater and a Werewolf, Potter! Even if I could get out, why would I? I’m free here.” He gestures at the window, whirling around with the flair he once had in school. “Look at this. It belongs to me; I have no wish to face a crowd who celebrated my death.”
me, like no one ever did. And… It’s okay if you don’t love me yet.”
“I… Hmm… Well, we were… are… Very compatible,” Malfoy said, flushing. “Especially the pregnancy part.”
Potter has the expression of a dog who was caught destroying a pillow. “Er, ancient Persian magic?” And just to make a point, because Potter is infuriating, he does it again, and the stains on the wall disappear, even the ones that must have been there for literal centuries.
“Yes,” Draco gasped, his robe falling on the floor, leaving Draco wearing only his shirt and trousers.
Now, he could understand his letter better and his unwillingness to have any kind of job. Malfoy has been working as an accountant for Gringotts for the past 18 years of his life. It was a lowly job, hidden in a small cubicle and deemed too stupid for the goblins to do themselves. Every now and then, The Prophet liked to remember Draco Malfoy’s place in life: working in a job he hated, with a miserable paycheck and less than little time to actually have any fun in his life.
Draco thought for a moment, then he replied.
again. He suspects her to be a Seer of some kind.
“Of course not,” Draco assured him. And, changing the subject, “Where are your friends tonight?”
Harry felt his whole body tingle with desire. It had been ages since he fucked anyone raw, and knowing he
“Oh, you’re no fun, Mr Potter,” Draco sighed exaggeratedly. “I guess I’ll have to show them my collection of Harry Potter figurines, then.”
He runs towards Draco and hears Ron tell his wife that he suspected something was afoot when Harry insisted on inviting so many people to his birthday party. Hermione shrieks and Harry snickers. He doesn’t mind Goyle and Zabini, but they’re not his favourite people in the world, so the only reason they’re here is for Draco.
Potter looked away first this time.
Arctic nudges at the edge of his consciousness, and Draco sighs and wipes his cheeks with his sleeve. A stray tear escaped his eyes without permission. Tipsy is watching him, careful not to push too far, which Draco appreciates.
, which is fitting given the heat of the late-afternoon sun. It’s a perfect summer day and Harry is vibrating through his skin.
“That’s all right, Harry, I had a lovely time at the lake, you would have been in the way.”
Each person had a smile on their faces; even Theo who was trying hard not to smile was failing at it. Once they’ve written their messages, they stood up and attached them to a line, side by side, creating a bunting line. It was beautiful, the pink and blue connected with the messages of their family. Harry helped them do it, and he could read the phrases clearly:
Something settles inside him as it becomes clear that Malfoy does indeed still take his tea with four cubes of sugar.
Potter didn’t stop. He focused on that spot inside of Draco, pummelling his prostate with sharp thrusts that made lights pop in front of his eyes, still taking greedily, indulging himself in Draco’s body with a brutish lack of shame. The bed frame (which
“And I can’t understand why… It’s so good… Not having to
“It’s a huge baby then,” Harry said, and Draco smiled wickedly.
And here it stands, a wide gate made of obsidian, visible only to those with magic in their blood. The walls holding it up are high and covered in ivy, and Harry’s eye twitches at the pompous family motto sculpted above the crest at the centre of the gate.
halfwit, though,” Draco sighed. Pansy, scowling, snatched up her purse. Draco quickly finished off his drink before following after her — as much as he enjoyed ogling Potter, he didn’t fancy sitting there and doing it alone.
There’s a pop, and Draco is too confused to berate himself for being startled.
“It’s entirely your fault, uncle,” Teddy said, walking in wide steps until he sat beside Narcissa. She looked at him in surprise, then chuckled, hiding her mouth with a delicate hand.
They have rules and they abide by them. Never go to sleep without resolving the day’s conflict. Never ask what the other dreamt about when they wake up shaking and sick, because they’ll talk if they want to. Support and respect each other. The basics, really, and Harry likes it. They have their own space in the Manor to escape and recharge. Harry kept the room with the turquoise bed hangings, though the times he uses it are few and far between. He’s very attached to the master bedroom with its round bed encased in bark. He has an office next to the library with a private Floo to the werewolf sanctuary, since he works there. He’s a teacher for those kids who either don’t go to Hogwarts or are too young for it. Some are Squibs. Some are not magical at all, Muggle children who were in the wrong place at the wrong time when Greyback was near. Some get Hogwarts letters but choose to stay, because the wizarding world is too prejudiced against Lycanthropes, or because they’re scared, or simply don’t like the idea of boarding school. So Harry teaches them all about geography and defensive theory. Sometimes, he joins Kellah in her Magical Theory class at Hogwarts to talk about Persian magic and encourage the students to discover how people around the world cast their spells.
Draco pushes him away, sticks his pointy nose in the air and wipes the tear-tracks off his cheeks with the heel of his palms. “Scared, Potter?”
And though he still appeared not to have caught up to what was going on, he stood. Draco went over to him, pleased when Potter didn’t move away even though Draco could sense him stiffening.
From now on, they only had to be careful and wait for the delivery… And pick names.
As they enter the forest, the temperature drops and he shivers. Luna presses herself against him. “You can talk about it, you know?”
Harry cackled, his laughter contagious as Draco laughed in return, although his eyes were shining with emotion. When Harry composed himself, he nodded in agreement.
Draco smiled, kissing Harry’s face all over, happily dancing over his lap.
And thus the bickering started. Harry smiled quietly to himself, being thankful for his adopted family. Ron still looked like he and Harry would have to
“Has it been awhile?” Potter asked suddenly, still moving his finger. It was an unexpectedly sound leap of logic and it made Draco flush with warmth, glad Potter couldn’t see his face full on.
It’s dark outside when he goes to his lab. It’s the only part of the Manor that remains unchanged; Snape used it, and Draco’s respect for him has grown tremendously when he learned he’d been a spy. He likes to think Snape would approve. In reality, Snape would tell Draco to stop being so sentimental, but he’s gone, so Draco will do as he pleases.
Draco Malfoy was indeed a petit omega. Although they were the same age, Malfoy looked younger, like he took a huge amount of time pampering his own skin to keep being that baby smooth texture it had. His hair was longer, reaching his shoulders and parted to the side. He was wearing a white blouse and grey skinny trousers, modest and yet so delicious. Harry was already going grey at the temples, and sometimes he thought he looked even older than he really was.
“What do I
Above and behind him, Potter grunted and — impossible though it seemed — picked up his speed yet again, taking Draco by the legs and hauling him closer. Draco heard the frame make an ominous noise and, just before the whole thing shook violently and then went crashing to the floor, he had a moment to appreciate the irony.
Yes, he knew Draco would obey him, but deep inside he felt bad about doing it. Maybe it was Hermione’s influence, but although he knew Draco loved,
“It’s Granger-Weasley.” The tea is still too hot, so Harry adds more milk from the tiny saucer.
Harry was almost sure sometimes Draco got it wrong on purpose.
“More than true. Perfect,” Draco replied, holding Harry’s hand as they left the podium to talk to their friends and family.
“Okay, Draco. I’m going to write a letter so you can get some money from Gringotts. But I’m serious, we’re not going to have the gender reveal party.”
… Not having to make any decisions… Just being happy and
“If I’m in heat,” Draco licked his chin, because when locked, he couldn’t reach Harry’s mouth. “you’ll have no choice but to fuck me all day long.”
“Don’t we now?” Harry teased, and
“Luna said I do. And that I can get to know more, so that’s what I’ll do.”
“That seems like a simple solution to me; get to know them, and after that, you can help.”
Draco licked his lips, looking out of the window, the sun light shining brightly on Draco’s platinum blond hair, before he looked at Harry again.
“Oh,” Potter said, still looking a bit confused. Or maybe it was just fascination.
“Thank you, alpha… For taking care of me…” his omega’s voice was like a warm summer breeze, and Harry smiled happily.
He bites back a watery chuckle. “Ah, of course.” Fuck, but he hasn’t felt like this in years. He finds he prefers the numbness that followed his grief upon realising there were no more blood-relatives left in the world. Malfoy barging into his life made everything so vibrant again, and now Harry might have ruined it. Okay, it would be more accurate to say that Harry had barged into Malfoy’s existence and imposed his presence on him, but that’s not the point.
“Oh!” Potter exclaimed. “Right, yeah, no, they’re not here. It’s date night,” he said, rolling his eyes again but this time with a definite fondness about it. “They like doing that every other week or so.”
Harry Potter?”
“Did we sleep all day?” Potter’s voice is so rough, it warms Draco’s cheeks because Draco wants to send a fruit basket to whoever taught the git to suck a cock. Also, possibly, a boxed-up Obliviate, because nobody but Draco should get to remember what Potter looks like on his knees.
. And you deserve an alpha who can appreciate that, which… It’s not me. Don’t settle for less than what you deserve,” Harry patted his hand, and made a beeline for the exit. He had done what he had come to do, mingle and try to have a conversation with people who might potentially be interesting. Harry hated Ministry parties, but the truth was that he was lonely.
“Nope! Trust me, you don’t want to know what that thing is.”
The windows can be seen through again and two doxys fall dead. Harry’s eyes roam across the Black Family tapestry with its repaired portraits that reflect the person’s appearance instead of a generic, medieval painting. Regulus is sleeping with his mouth wide open and Sirius waves cheerfully as Andromeda rolls her eyes. Walburga is absent; she left when Professor Flitwick readded Sirius to the tree, shortly after the war. Her painting downstairs is gone, too. Good riddance.
“Hnnn… Good… Because I wanted you to pump me full of come today,” Draco moaned as Harry suckled on his neck, his legs spread wide, his moving with need.
“It’s… actually true,” Harry said, and Draco nodded.
“Grimmauld Place,” Harry answers once he clears the images of the bathroom incident out of his mind. “Yes.”
“Is that what you want? That’s why you keep coming back.”
“Yes,” Harry said immediately. “I want to. I want to sleep sucking on your tits. I want to press my hand on your cunt so you know I’m here all the time.”
“Ah.” Draco closes his eyes in bliss when Harry drops a series of kisses on his shoulder. Then he recalls what he was thinking about and stiffens. “You said Theo opened a werewolf sanctuary,” he begins, and it’s a terrible attempt at changing the subject. Given Harry’s silence, he must realise what Draco’s trying to do.
For the next two months, Draco got obsessed with the tea parties – and parties in general. He couldn’t stop talking about all the parties they’d have for the baby, or the ones they’d have even before the baby was born.
It didn’t take long for Harry to receive a letter informing him of his matching. The letter told him that they found a hyper compatible omega for him, and Harry smiled because he knew that his preferences were… Well, they were difficult to live up to.
It was Draco’s turn to smile, and then he nodded.
“Exactly,” said Draco, affecting a frown. “And of course I’m useless at that stuff. So again,
Draco goes downstairs and finds the twit crouched near the tendrils that tripped him up before, letting them play with his fingers. It’s adorable. Draco hates it. He’s not even mad about yesterday, or the day before. He secretly admits he overreacted, but his friends are a touchy topic. He clears his throat to signal his presence. “Potter.” He doesn’t think he’s imagining the subtle widening of Potter’s eyes behind his glasses (square frames suit him a lot better, excellent choice), or the way he looks at Draco’s waist.
Potter scrambles to get back on his feet. “Malfoy, hi!”
"Yeah, that'd be great."
“I did. And it was the best choice for me,” Harry admitted, and Molly cleared her throat as if trying to find something to say.
And then Potter was pushing inside him, opening him up around his cock, and he hadn’t been wrong when he’d asked whether it had been a while for Draco — three months, if he remembered right. He was rather picky. It hurt despite the stretching and Potter wasn’t necessarily gentle, although Draco thought he was trying to be. He once more reminded Draco of some sort of overeager puppy, too absorbed with the physical sensations to control his more carnal urges. And maybe that was a little painful but it was
Harry couldn’t complain about it. Draco’s appetite was tremendous, and by the third month, he was showing already.
Harry was wearing a black tuxedo with a grey vest. It had golden embroidery on the lapel, and his hair had been artfully tousled by Fleur.  He felt very handsome, indeed.
“You.” Harry takes three steps forward and cups his face with both hands, rubbing his thumbs on his cheeks. Someone whistles. “I’m the luckiest man alive.”
, without having a complete meltdown, but it’s all rushing to the front of his mind. His nose is stuffy and when he looks at his hands, they’re shaking. He rakes his fingers through his hair and grips the strands too tight, then lets go and walks to the willow tree cradling his mattress. The soft bedspread welcomes him as he sits with the distinct sensation of an out-of-body experience. The wolf is close to the surface. Even his blood itches. It’s exactly like getting up after staying in one position for too long—it doesn’t hurt, but it’s an awareness he can’t control. Right now, the wolf is prancing, but Draco wants to scream. He grabs a pillow and presses his face into the fabric.
The letter is sent a few days after Potter claims Draco’s bed as his own. Draco receives only one reply; in capital letters, unsigned, someone sends him a litany of insults, ending with a threat of painful death should Draco keep hiding. A few days later, while Harry is at the Burrow for Molly’s birthday, the wards shiver and waver. Draco’s hands clench on
“Lily?” Draco prodded, and she sighed, pointing to the toddler in her arms.
Draco turns around and looks at him expectantly, holding out his hand. “What are you looking at?”
“Mine, in Ahvaz.” Harry’s shoes really are very interesting, but he finds the courage to meet his best friend’s eyes. “I realised the morning after our wedding. I could smell it. I woke up thinking I was back in Iran, it was bloody weird.” He raises both hands in surrender before she can bury him in questions or hit him with the wooden spatula she’s holding. “I have no idea how it works, but Draco is free, and I don’t care about the specifics.” He notices Draco escaping a bear-hug from Goyle. “Sorry, I’m going to rescue my husband.”
“Blueberry jam. The berries fought back. How’s Grimmauld?”
? My life had been nothing but hard, horrible decisions. I am not good at making those… Especially because I’m not brave enough to not be afraid to die. And… That’s the biggest difference between you and me, Harry. I’m a coward. And that’s not a bad thing. That’s just how things are. I’m scared. And you’re not. That’s why you became the Master of Death, isn’t it? Because you conquered your fear of dying.”
“Tipsy knows. The water is ready. Tipsy will clean up Master Arctic’s mess, oh yes, and she will wash Master Draco’s clothes, but Master Draco should not walk around the house naked.”
“He didn’t eat toast, he—” Harry’s cheeks burn and Luna grins. “Okay, but that doesn’t mean anything.” He casts a Warming Charm because he’s freezing his bollocks off.
“Er — no?”
“We can do this another day,” Harry suggests.
Malfoy frowned, looking at him like he was insane.
“Granger and Weasley.”
, Potter?”
Malfoy had always been good-looking, if a bit too pointy when he hadn’t grown into his features yet. He was part of that list of men who shaped Harry’s sexuality, though he’d been blissfully unaware of it at the time. Bill, Charlie, Oliver, Cedric, Blaise,
“You are going to be an amazing aunt, you know that, don’t you Hermione?” Harry said as he hugged Hermione tight, as touched as Draco was.
“Oh, Merlin’s saggy balls! We need another crib!”
He observed his husband, admiring his form. Even at 53, Draco was an amazing man. His features were beautiful, his body was amazing, and Harry couldn’t stop thinking about having his way with him all the time. He was also ridiculously fertile, as his pregnant belly showed. They were hoping for twins, so they could
“Orion?” Draco prompted, again, and the eleven year old whined and broke down. His hair was as blond as Scorpius’s, but his eyes were the only brown eyes they had in the family.
“By the time you arrived—well, I don’t need to tell you that your punctuality needs work, do I? As to how I lived… My parents’ spell put me in stasis when I stopped breathing. It’s guesswork, at this point. Perhaps I did die; I don’t recall.
The elves have outdone themselves. Or perhaps it’s their regular fare and Harry is not used to being spoiled. The table, covered in a white cloth, is laden with dishes that make him wish he had five stomachs, especially since he can spot food from his ancestors’ countries. He hasn’t been back in England long enough to miss haleem, and he did cook his fair share of Punjabi recipes once he figured out how to replicate the flavours (it did take a few trips to Pakistan and India and the patience of a two-hundred-year-old witch before he found the right balance of spices), but there’s something more there. A platter that, at first glance, screams Mediterranean, but it’s the crispy slices of pie that tell him the elves chose to represent Greece as well. There’s none of the food Malfoy used to eat at school. Did the elves cook that for Harry? Hopefully Malfoy likes something on this table, because Harry is not sure how much of a morning person Malfoy is. Especially given what he went through last night.
Why is Draco’s heart beating so fast? “Don’t you want someone you can go places with?”
on the front and
They pulled apart from each other, and Harry felt the sting of magic holding the fourth finger of his left hand. He raised it to look, and a magical, golden band was around his finger. The same was on Draco’s hand, although thinner and more delicate than Harry’s.
, my dear omega, Hermione is the
, but I do have a profound feeling for you. You gave me something no one has ever given me. And apart from sexual attraction, you’re funny, and witty and… You just let me
“No, but you’re an uncouth barbarian. I was raised with something called
It was a contrasting sensation, and he couldn’t speak again. His eyes closed as he hugged Harry’s head against his chest, his mouth sucking on his nipple softly. Draco felt his body go limp almost immediately, and Harry hugged him tight, his own eyes closing as he let his body drag comfort in the sensation of having Draco’s nipple in his mouth.
Harry snorts at the thought of Malfoy’s expression if he brings Xenophilius’ newspaper with him. “You think I should go back?”
Pansy is still hysterical when she blubbers, “Oh my
Draco moved his hands, delicate fingers spreading his folds open, exposing his slick hole. His thumb moved up and down his tiny cock, too big to be a clit, but yet so small it wouldn’t hit the back of Harry’s mouth if he sucked him. Harry stared at him, moving and finally putting his mouth on Draco.
“I am astonished at your eloquence. Now, you may go back home and learn to send an owl, or I suppose you could join me in the lab.” His eyes narrow as he remembers that Potter’s talent in sixth year was a fluke. “Don’t touch anything unless I tell you to.”
“Think you can make it work?” Pansy asks.
When he leaves, with only his open work robe on his shoulders, Tipsy is waiting on the other side of the door, her thin arms crossed on her chest. “Master Draco needs food.”
“You’re talking to me about the weather?” Draco raised an eyebrow, and Harry sighed.
“I can’t do that because…” she let the roll unfold, showing off the picture the doctor had made on the day they discovered. It was obviously enlarged and it looked like someone had outlined the baby’s body in white ink, showing a perfect baby curled… and at the baby’s side,
“It’s
“Oh, alpha… It’s slipping… Take it off so I can
Deciding to take a risk, he said, “You’re right. I s’pose I can let you buy me a drink, Potter.”
The table in the middle of their (once) living room had an assortment of little cakes, cupcakes and muffins, chocolate lollies and bars, all in blue and pink. The huge cake in the middle of the table was also pink and blue with the names ‘Wizard or Witch?’ on top.
“What’s wrong with your bed?”
. Small and delicate, skinny but soft. His skin so pale, although pink in certain areas. Harry stared at his chest, small, round and perky breasts begging to be sucked and pulled at. Draco’s nipples were hard, so damn hard, but Harry didn’t come closer.
“Sit down on the bed,” Draco said, dropping his hand away finally.
He sighed, and nodded.
To everyone else, he and Draco had been dating secretly for months before deciding to elope. They were afraid of the judgment of the society, but their love was intense enough that they had decided to stop the façade and just go on with their marriage. This was what the public was going to see, with pictures from the wedding taken and chosen carefully to show their love and affection. A little ruse, just to take them off their back.
The party happened a few weeks later, and Harry thought he should’ve received an Oscar after all the calmness he pretended to have. All of their friends, family and acquaintances were there, and soon they had a mountain of gifts to select from. Pansy and Hermione – of all people! – had worked together to prepare games and gags for the party, even making Harry participate in a competition to know whose husband was faster at changing nappies blindfolded – Ron won that one.
It’s all it takes before Draco’s tears begin to fall.
“I’m waiting for you. Come and eat.”
He works quietly in the magically warmed section hosting his more delicate potion ingredients. Most of the others are planted outside and only survive because the Manor takes care of them, otherwise they would be scorched and dead like the trees and grass. Draco once experimented with some plants inside the greenhouse, asking the land to watch over them because he was too depressed to make the effort himself. But the Manor’s magic combined with the spells already on the greenhouse made everything grow out of control. Draco came back to a nearly impenetrable jungle. Hell, the nightshade berries were as big as his head! It took him days to fix it.
sorry. But that’s not what bothers you. All I can think about is how bloody beautiful you are. Maybe I’m not objective, but that’s what it is. I’m not going to flatter your monstrous ego and list every little thing I’m attracted to—because there’s too much,” he laughs, and Draco needs to remember to breathe. “I don’t mind that you’ve been turned, except if it causes you pain, but it doesn’t look like it does, not much at least.” He moves closer and cups Draco’s face. “Tell me again to leave if you want to. But I’d really like to stay. We can make it work.”
” Ron’s voice uttered, his eyes wide like saucers. “You don’t even have an omega!”
Potter doesn’t, and has the audacity to ask what’s wrong, which makes Draco want to hex him and punch him and kick and scream, and there’s a ball of white-hot rage rearing its ugly head deep into his guts. Draco slaps Potter’s hand away, pushes the covers off his body and sits on his knees. “You want to know what’s wrong?” he hisses, aware that the tears are now spilling down his cheeks. “Take a good look at me and answer your own fucking question!”
Harry has been breathing in dust since his return. The sound of raindrops battering the windows and the cold air seeping through his blanket kept him awake for most of the night, since Grimmauld Place takes its sweet, sweet time to warm up. Harry shivers.
“I think-” Malfoy started, his hands playing with the hem of his blouse like he was nervous. His cheeks were flushed pink, long pale blond eyelashes fluttering over his cheekbones. “I think I’d want what you’re offering me. I’m… I’m running out of time and… I didn’t think anyone out there was as fucked up as me, and that they'd actually enjoy what I enjoy.”
“Well, I’m not at the tea parties mostly because I don’t feel like eating and gossiping like you and your friends do,” Harry said, and Draco chuckled.
Life was good. A bit messy and a bit noisy, but damn, how it was good.
Draco meets his thrusts and begs him to go deeper, and Harry does. When Draco stops him and demands to see him, Harry pulls out and helps him flip over, puts a pillow under his hips and lines himself back up, rubbing his cock against Draco. He’s so hard, it’s painful. Draco is panting, his feverish gaze pleading, and he mutters “Take your time, why don’t you?”, which makes Harry laugh; Draco rolls his eyes and urges him on. Harry loves to tease, and he loves Draco’s irritated reaction and increasingly desperate moans even more.
Harry has no sympathy for Lucius at all. Did he deserve to be torn to shreds by a werewolf? No, Harry doesn’t wish such a death on anyone, Voldemort included. But if Lucius was shown alive on a tapestry, Harry would ignore it, at best. Or spit on his portrait. Malfoy—Draco—is different.
“This is going to take us forever,” Harry sighed, carding his hand through his hair.
“Malfoy,” he said again, “you’re
Slowly, the door closes behind him, and the noise echoes all around Harry. Hermione would scream at him right now; he’s not an Auror anymore. He’s never truly been one, but that won’t stop him. He’s still powerful; he’s Harry Potter. So what if his knees ache?
He catches a fleeting glimpse of something to his left, but it’s only his reflection in a mirror that is almost entirely wrapped in thin vines. Then his foot catches on something and sends him sprawling on a carpet of wet moss. All the air in his lungs is exhaled in a loud gasp, and he looks at the offending root. “What the—” It’s not really a root. It has tendrils, which are wrapped around his ankles. Harry sits up and untangles them, but they keep slapping his fingers away like a kitten. He huffs, irritated but amused. “Come on, let go.”
“I apologise for kissing you,” Malfoy says. He sounds sincere. Harry hopes he’s not regretting it.
“Fine,” she said, waving her hand. “Go
“I—you didn’t tell any of your friends?” As soon as those words are out, Harry wishes for a Time Turner. This is such a bad idea. Ron is usually the sufferer of Foot-in-Mouth disease, but apparently it’s Harry’s turn.
“You know, even with his mess, I’m still proud of him. What house do you think he’s going?” Harry asked, and Draco didn’t even bat an eye.
“Your lips,” Potter said again, squinting at them shamelessly. Draco felt himself flushing. “They look shiny.”
Draco flinches as Arctic whines, sending drops of potion at the wall. Luckily, it’s a harmless concoction.
Harry smiled wickedly, holding Draco on his hips and grinding him against his own knot. Draco moaned, squeezing him with his cunt, harder this time.
Harry shakes his head and exits the orangery. He’s careful not to trip again in the hallway, and once he’s outside, he represses a shudder as the unseen eyes are once again following his every move. He hurries back down the path and past the obsidian gate, then Apparates home and breathes out with a gasp.
“I’ll try to free you, but if it never happens, I’ll accept that.”
Harry bites his lower lip. When he speaks next, it’s in a whisper, because it’s so obvious, and it’s tragic and unfair. “Your mum?”
.” Malfoy’s mouth twists. “Besides, I grow weary of the company of plants. Your fall was entertaining. Why, I may even write a song in your honour.”
“Well … at least I brought my toolbox! I can definitely fix it for you.”
Draco asks about their lives, hears apologies about those who couldn’t be here today, and agrees to reveal his existence to more people. Pucey, Vaisey, and Wilkins deserve closure. Astoria cautions against informing Tracey, citing her contempt for Theo’s sanctuary. She also tells him all about her niece and nephew, and Draco’s body relaxes.
Breathing in deeply, Harry made a decision as he apparated back home from the party. He was going to be married next month, and he didn’t care if he loved the person or not. His only criteria was: the person had to be compatible with his desires, and they had to not care about him being Harry Potter.
Draco moaned, his whole body shivering, nipples hard and pointy.
Sirius was bigger than his brother, but not by all that much. Harry had hoped his second son would have his dark hair, but got surprised when Sirius was cleaned, revealing not blond, but soft red hair. Harry didn’t even notice he was crying until he sobbed, tucking his baby boy against his chest.
Draco’s eyebrows lifted. He didn’t think Potter had meant for it to sound so quietly philosophical; if he had, it would have been something of a profound statement in all its naked honesty. Instead it managed only to be endearing, because he knew perfectly well it was just Potter’s lack of brain power making him blunt.
Harry was 36 and he had no prospect of having a long-lasting relationship. He had tried with Ginny almost two decades prior and it hadn't worked out, of course. She was happily married to a Spanish seeker, taking care of their first baby once she had decided to retire from Quidditch last year. Ron and Hermione… Well, they were perfect to each other, and they had Hugo and Rose to keep them entertained.
“I thought you’d be happy,” Draco said, his own eyes filling with tears. He was looking at Harry’s face, trying hard not to cry, but not knowing what had gone wrong.
, he was so
“Malfoy,” Potter said weakly, gaze travelling without shame up and down Draco’s body, always ending up back on his arse. “You’re …”
Draco swallowed and fought back what would surely have been a shaky laugh.
"Pumpkin juice would be great," he said.
(they listen to music predating her birth, what an atrocious prospect). All Harry cares about is how Draco feels about it, and Draco hasn’t stopped smiling since they arrived.
Tonight was different only in that it was a match rather than practise Potter had come from. Not a big game, but a win was a win and there were more people in the pub than usual to celebrate. Potter was wearing a permanent boyish grin of triumph that was giving Draco heartburn and trying to refuse the free shots being forced upon him from all sides.
He clears his mind as much as possible and settles on a soft carpet of moss, where he gives himself a quick wank so his horniness doesn’t transfer to Arctic. A randy werewolf makes the return to human form a lot worse.
Harry transferred them to the bassinets and now couldn’t stop looking at them. They were so amazing, with their little button noses and cute baby pouts. Baby Sirius had his lips in a slight purplish tone, but the healer said it was perfectly normal and they’d both be looking less pink and purplish once time has passed.
“What do you mean?”
“So, what, you need, like, someone to do it the Muggle way?”
Does he even
“It’s not going to be the last one. Why don’t we spread out the parties?” Harry suggested, but Draco didn’t look happy about it. “Besides, there’s
He tenses as he thinks about his friends, about that special bond they shared by being Slytherins, hiding their true selves from the world. They were so close. Pansy’s public persona was an absolute cow with the laughter of a hyena, but in private she liked to perform dramatic reenactments of Lockhart’s lessons. She fell asleep everywhere in the common room, snored like the Hogwarts Express, and was the ringleader of a covert operation to acquire luxury Muggle cosmetics. Theo, quiet as a mouse, bookworm extraordinaire, was the person to go to for mental support. He provided gender-related advice to those who needed it, and he discussed his own transition even if he didn’t like doing it, because it helped a few people. Draco sometimes wondered why Theo wasn’t a Gryffindor; it took some guts to stand up to Flint as a tiny thirteen-year-old defending Wilkins’ right to be in the girls’ dormitory. Then there was Greg, who spent so long trying to woo Daphne and talked about her even in his sleep, forcing Draco to cast Silencing Charms in the middle of the night. And Blaise. Everyone assumed he would follow in his mum’s footsteps and flirt his way through life, but he turned out to be completely uninterested in romance or sex, and was a secret Gobstones nutter.
She was able to swindle Vernon into buying her a lemon popsicle by catching the eye of the nice vendor lady and standing close to the group.
” Indie the grass snake complained. “
All in all, it wasn’t a bad day.
She blinked in confusion, still looking dazed. “I… I’m sorry. I’m very disoriented at the moment. Go ahead without me. I need to take a minute to… Yeah.”
And now she was back.
She itched to take ahold of both the wand and the stone on the ring.
They arrived at the Zoo soon enough, and she quickly clambered out before Dudley could bowl her over with his impatience.
She grimaced and picked up a random fallen shirt to wrap the ring in. It helped. The pain in her brow lessened somewhat.
And she was supposed to be in the Cupboard.
Petunia sensed the danger and quickly amended, “and we’ll buy you Two new presents when we go out. How is that Popkin? You’ll have thirty nine presents. Is that alright sweetums?”
Last time, that was another thing that held her back from leaving the Dursleys. She hadn’t wanted to burden her Godfather while he was recovering and on the run. Then she stayed because the Order told her too.
She didn’t really know why she was so excited. It wasn’t the first time she had gone to something interesting, at least not in her memory. Perhaps it was because she saw it as a break from planning and being drowned in memories. Perhaps she was just eager to be out of the house that held the Horcrux.
The doorbell rang.
She took a few steps forward, and
The piles of broken and discarded toys confirmed her theory of it being before the Hogwarts letters. But when was it?
Like when she decided to settle for the old fashioned Muggle way of breaking out of her closet to get food in the dead of night rather than use Alohomora and open it easily.
It was Dudley’s Birthday.
The Horcruxes hadn’t been destroyed yet. None of them had.
“She hates the girl.”
And preferably, dropped of all charges.
“Gin, go grab mum, I’m going to carry him downstairs.”
Nothing happened.
Well, that was new. Actually, last time, didn’t she suggest that she could stay? She pursed her lips and started drying the dishes before piping in slowly. “I could just stay here,
Hailey quietly continued to eat her food.
He slung his youngest brother’s arm over his shoulder and carefully lifted him up.
Piers was found and brought back to them. He had somehow broken his right hand.
It would be funny if the glass just broke under his fist…
Her hair was short at the moment. Easier to maintain. Or “less likely to catch lice or some other nasty bug and bring it home to Dudders”, as Aunt Petunia claimed. It had caused her to be mistaken for a boy several times in the past. Something Dudley had relentlessly bullied her for.
“It’s Ron.” Percy explained, pushing past them hurriedly to place the youngest brother on the couch. “I think he must’ve fallen down the stairs.”
It wasn’t until she put her glasses back on that she realized what was so wrong.
Holly schooled her face into an impassive one as she straightened up.
And there would be another younger Holly somewhere.
“Boys, not now.” His mother chastised offhandedly, moving to apply more bruise salve to his sore jaw.
She looked up at the door in front of her. The Cupboard.
She blinked a couple more times. She groaned and rubbed her face. “What day is it?”
But the girl..
The girl flinched at the volume.
She knew that time travel was all too real.. but this was different from time turners. For one, she didn’t even remember what could’ve caused it.
“All right, thirty seven then.” Dudley grumbled. His face was turning red.
“Jane, and her children are home sick with the flu. We don’t want the girl to come back and spread the germs to Duddikins.”
She could check the newspaper later for further confirmation, but first, she needed to check something.
With a final round of insistent knocking, she heard Petunia walk away.
“Carried you downstairs so mum could look at you too.” George added.
Holly shot up at the first set of rapping knuckles.
True to her word, Holly stood apart from the rest of the group nearly the whole time.
The drive to the Zoo was not that bad. She kept to herself, knowing not to mention anything related to magic.
The python slithered out, pushing past the glass shards.
Holly suppressed a smile. Snakes really were the best.
Petunia insisted that Dudley be given a checkup too.
“That’s right dear!” Petunia jumped in, hugging her giant son. “I won’t let her ruin your special day.”
She closed the door to her Cupboard and sat down, staring at the wand.
Her good mood deflated a bit and she grimaced as she turned to look at her cousin who was currently pounding on the glass of the boa constrictor’s cage. She winced with sympathy as the snake opened one lone eye and glared at him.
She could somehow still feel her magic lingering around the broken and bruised appendage. But luckily he had fallen down trying to escape the snake and they blamed it on that.
There was a shirt on the bed, and a sock too…
The handler, an older man with a very bushy silvery moustache and receding hairline that made him feel like a portly grandfather, smiled at her as she tentatively approached. “Hello young lady. This is Indie, she’s a common grass snake. Would you like to touch her?”
He screamed bloody murder and jumped back.
“At the bottom of the stairs.” They finished off with painfully familiar identical grins.
Her legs were shorter. She wasn’t used to that.
She silently made her way downstairs and to the Cupboard.
She shrugged. “I had a pet snake that had a tooth ache once.” She lied easily.
He smiled and took the snake from her. “Well, I’ll go look at it right now. I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay here.”
(✿◠‿◠) ~♥
The handler chortled. “Cute. I like to pretend that I can speak to them too sometimes. I’m not sure if she can understand me or if I’m just speaking gibberish.”
“What about your friend, what’s-her-name, Yvonne.”
She had heard the name a few times in her youth before… everything.
He did feel hungry, but at the same time, “no.” He muttered, “m’ fine. Nauseous.”
No. That wasn’t the last thing she remembered.
As soon as she was out of sight, Petunia slid down to sit next to the kettle and puddle of water.
Oh yeah, the tantrum.
She pinched her hand, hard. It sure seemed real.. but then again, there was magic and who knows the extent of what it could’ve done to her.
She took one of the empty notebooks and a fancy silver pen that she found and stuffed it under her shirt.
She pulled the cloak to her chest and buried her face in the cool fabric.
After ten minutes, she noticed that one of the handlers was outside one of the snake cages, holding a small dark green and brownish snake.
And that was where her memories became unbelievably fuzzy.
They wouldn’t have to deal with… this.
“Sure.” Holly said slowly, making sure she was speaking English. Oh wait… she suddenly had a very stupid idea.
Holly placed the small bundle along with the wand on the invisibility cloak and folded it.
Would she be in trouble if she used magic now? Or would it just be waved off as accidental magic?
