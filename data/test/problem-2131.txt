“I’m Emina. I’d hope you spend enough time actually partaking in Ministry work to know at least that, but I’m sure the office has been rather demanding since you switched from a real job to second floor secretary. I guess you can’t expect too much from a guy whose glory days are long since over.” She smiled teasingly.
“Merlin’s beard, Malfoy, I said you need to go home! I’m an Auror for God’s sake, you can listen to me or to common sense but either way you need to get your intoxicated and emotionally charged idiot self out of public before you put yourself in serious danger.”
Harry stepped past Malfoy who was sputtering some sort of response he didn’t care to listen to, grabbed a clean pair of pajamas from his room, and shut himself in the bathroom.
“You know what?! Fine! If saving the slimeball will make you stop moping around the apartment over Ginny and your job, to hell with my complaints. But that sodding thing is going in your bed. No way I’m letting Mr. greasy string bean on my couch.”
Malfoy let out a noise of disbelief. “No, I’LL find me a shirt.” He pushed Harry aside and threw open the doors to his closet.
“I put you through hell. For seven solid years I did everything I could to get you to pay attention to me all the while making your life miserable, just because — It doesn’t matter why, the point is I was cruel and selfish so don’t you dare try to repent to me, Potter.”
When Harry’s eyes wandered back to what was in front of him, he noticed Luna staring at him oddly. Or rather, particularly oddly.
“EXPELLIARMUS!” With a simple yell of his go-to spell, the man was disarmed. Before his audience took over the attack, Harry sent a series of mild stunning spells. They flew in beams of light through the air one after another, stalling the group long enough to turn to his petty school nemesis.
But in the dark, this man’s features were a mere suggestion, shadows and scruffy black hair. Their bodies were close and Draco’s was cold.
Malfoy’s moral compass was finally decently aligned, and he stood up for what he believed was right. To see that kind of bravery in a Slytherin was impressive. He supposed it wasn’t all that different from when he’d protected Harry from being turned over to Voldemort even though he was told by his own family to identify him, but Malfoy was proving again and again what a fundamental part of him that sort of behavior had become.
He opened his eyes, realizing too late that they were wet. A tear fell and wet the stranger’s cheek.
It was comfortable. New, and most certainly temporary, but nice. So he tried to muster all the reassurance he could, keeping his gaze steady.
Guilt and uncertainty twisted in Draco’s gut. He was caught between wanting to shag this man like nothing had happened and disapparate on the spot.
“What? Oh. Yeah. Ugh. Gross.” Harry realized he’d stopped whisking and quickly started moving his hand again.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, his hand resting awkwardly on the sheet. “I just wanted to... Never mind, it—“ He inhaled sharply as a cool, slender hand curled around his.
The sound of sizzling butter served as a backdrop to a whisk clanging loudly against glass. Two flatmates began their morning routine, complete with a defeating yawn from Ron.
Malfoy’s hand was resting on the hospital bed in front of him. Without properly thinking, Harry reached forward to hold it, but Malfoy flinched away, asking tensely “What was that for?”
He knew it was a ridiculous question. The last time he’d been on a broom was in the Fiendfire, and Harry’s answer probably meant it was the same for him. Thinking of that fire — who he’d lost, how it was his fault — scorched his insides.
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hand to pull him up. He flinched at the touch, but let himself be led down the hallway.
Harry didn’t know there had been tension built up inside of him, and yet it was as if a knot inside his chest unwound itself as Malfoy spoke. He felt validated.
Malfoy spat. “You, sitting here, antagonizing me with your stare and your hair and that fitted sweatshirt, that’s hardly civility, Potter.” Harry hardly had time to process before Malfoy continued. “I’ve spent this whole time trying to move on, and you just want to dredge it back up, don’t you?”
“Ohh,” the male nurse said slowly from the doorway. “I’ll come back in a bit then, I wouldn’t want to interrupt anything.” He gave them a knowing nod and encouraging smile as he pulled the doorknob toward himself.
The subway must have continued moving because it arrived at Harry’s stop, but his brain was at a standstill. He made the automatic trip out of the station, into the Ministry, and up to his office. Harry Potter and his staticky brain sat cooped up in there in hazy panic until lunch rolled around.
“No, you shut up, and let me say this. I’m not talking about saving the Wizarding World, we all know you’re a bloody hero, the headlines get old. I’m talking about… about giving me a chance, after I put you through hell for years. And putting up with the awestruck first years, and pretending you didn’t go through just as much trauma as―“
But something about the wind up in the bleachers made him feel reckless. Something about Potter’s wild hair and fierce eyes and strong arms made him feel like he could do anything.
He felt Ron grab his arm. “Come on mate, to hell with morality, you don’t owe that prick a thing.” Harry pulled away and muttered “I’ll just be a minute,” and Ron sighed as he watched his hero of a friend embark on another quest. At least this one didn’t consist of paperwork; maybe it was what he needed.
?” His forehead was dotted with beads of sweat, hair swept softly back, eyes icy. “I have a life,” he breathed, filling the air between them with the scent of coffee beans, “and I don’t need you interfering.”
“You’re right. Sorry. That was an understatement. You were so far gone you dueled a moth, ate ice cream with your worst enemy, and acted like a spoiled, whiny toddler. Oh, once again, my mistake - that last bit’s nothing new.”
“Ignoring your feelings never made ‘em go away faster.” He pivoted toward the stove, silhouette soft in the dark blue of early morning. “Tell me about him.”
He realized he was tracing those cheekbones with his fingers. Malfoy didn’t seem to mind, so he trailed his left hand across his jawline, the corner of his mouth, his cheek, and into his hair. When Malfoy found his other hand and intertwined their fingers, Harry took that as an invitation to comb through his sleek, white-blond hair.
He tried again. “You can talk to me about it. About anything.” He cringed at his own desperate words.
Our two favs talk for hours with alcohol & milkshakes, our other two favs. Then end up in bed together, more or less. But if you think that’s steamy, wait for the secret that gets spilled when morning comes...
“Anyway, I never explained or apologized and I just want to say I’m sorry. For everything, I guess.”
“I still can’t believe you frequent Mindy’s and you’ve never spiked a milkshake,” Malfoy scoffed, stirring the alcohol into Harry’s drink.
Harry obliged, figuring compliance would make this go faster. He held eye contact as he awkwardly dabbed the cloth under Malfoy’s eyes, ran it firmly across high cheekbones, and let it follow the length of his nose. He couldn’t read his expression, but the air between them seemed strangely... okay.
Just then, the figure beneath him started to move. Heavy eyelids lifted just barely, and then shot open. “Potter? What the hell are you doing in my house?!”
Ron laughed through his nose before turning back to Harry. “Look mate. Greasy string bean is not who I had in mind when we went out last Friday night. But whatever makes you happy, man, I mean honestly, I can’t judge. Well, I can. And I will.”
“Well!” said Kumara, pouring the mixture into glasses. “Hate to dip, but I have to walk my neighbor’s cat.”
He let his hands glide across the leather jacket before he helped the stranger pull it off. His fingers hit soft cotton, and he dragged them down his chest before raking them back up his torso. The stranger shuddered.
The subway’s scream served as a backdrop to Luna’s airy voice, giving the whole scene a vibe that Professor Trelawny would approve of.
“That moth is minding its own business. You should try it sometime, maybe you’d end up in less of a―“
Smoke tickled Draco’s throat and he choked on it. Sunlight trickled through the window, landing on his half-undressed crotch, and his stomach churned with disgust.
Harry seemed to be lost in thought, and Malfoy waited quietly beside him until he started talking again.
As they stepped out of the grimy hallway and into the room, Harry marveled at the decor. It was simple and shiny and incredibly nice looking for the run down building it was in. “Hey, hey Malfoy. This place is simple and shiny and really nice for being in such a run down building.”
“What are you on about?” interrupted a shaky voice. “This has nothing to do with you, get the fuck away from me!”
“You got it, mate.” Ron slid both the salt and pepper across the counter. He reached into the cupboard and grabbed a plate to pile the bacon on. They set the table and their conversation topics clicked back into the ordinary.
He tried to memorize the slopes of his back. The coiled energy in his movements. The taste of his mouth, in case he never got any of this again.
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitched upward. “Oh, toughen up, Potter. It’s better this way.” He held the drink toward Harry. “Here, have another go.”
Traces of stubble scratched his lips. He raked teeth down the man’s neck, heard him groan. He sucked the skin there and tasted sweat.
Draco glanced down, breaking eye contact, and noticed the gun was facing Harry. Barrel lodged beneath his ribs, pointing up at his chest, finger hovering above the trigger.
“We started having these arguments. About silly things, I don’t even know what. But she kept saying... it kept coming back to her feeling like I didn’t love her like that. Not enough, anyway.
Draco sighed against Harry’s mouth and pressed a kiss to his lips, to his cheek, to his ear. He was an ocean of feeling, unable to meet Harry’s eyes, so he rested his chin on Harry’s shoulder and hugged him tight.
They apparated from the hallway. Harry felt the familiar hum through his body as they teleported, but there was something stronger about it this time. Something that buzzed through his very fingertips.
“Snap out of it! You didn’t do anything and I’d appreciate it if you’d stop trying to do anything now. Just leave me alone, I’ll be fine.”
Squeezing his eyes shut, he let out a harsh breath. “Well, to hell with it, it was bound to happen eventually.”
Ron scraped the last of the eggs onto his plate. “You say that every time. It makes you miserable, too! I still don’t see why you accepted this desk job position.”
“Hermione, what Draco said this morning? Please tell me I’m being daft. You know I’m not good with these things, tell me I suck at interpreting romantic stuff and I’ve got it all wrong.”
The chilly air swept through the field and swirled around them, but they were a bundle of warmth, two bodies with aching chests and beating hearts, holding one another.
“Uh, hey.” Harry cursed himself for talking to an inanimate object. He then carried on talking to it. “Luna’s a bit odd. She believes in the things she talks about, and I admire that, I just don’t think they amount to much in reality. That being said, the strange things she goes on about nearly always end up having something to them.
The screech of brakes echoed through the tunnel as the subway came to a stop. Harry would forever be reminded of the Hogwarts Express. He curled his fingers around the cold handle of his briefcase and stepped through the doors, greeted by a familiar face.
He peeled off his t-shirt and threw it in the corner. When he yanked his trousers off, something fell out of his pocket: Luna’s wish-granting lump. He’d forgotten all about it. He set it on the bathroom counter, and realized just how covered in dried up toothpaste the counter was. Thank Merlin Malfoy was much too out of it to notice the mess their flat had become. Harry tossed his trousers and knickers into the corner with his mop of a shirt, and slipped into the shower.
“Get back here, you soggy mess! Stupid, yarny bastard, I WILL DESTROY YOU! If you would just... bloody hell, MOVE!”
RITA: Lovely [ and boring, she thinks ]. Are you concerned about your lack of intelligence due to leaving school early?
The stranger laughed. Draco twinged with irritation, ready to jump on the defense, but the stranger said “I don’t think anyone decides to have a one night stand without being a little fucked up.” He shifted awkwardly and continued. “Not to say— okay let me rephrase—“
Ron’s words seemed to echo off the walls: Hermione would have solved this by now. He scribbled a note and sent it off with his owl, praying Hermione was still in the same office. They worked two floors away, and yet he hadn’t talked to her in months.
A few unique-looking potted plants sat scattered among the bindings, presumably gifts from Neville. Swirling slowly across the ceiling was this relaxing blue and purple mist.
They walked the grounds together, Draco’s heart stuttering with embarrassment and perhaps a twinge of hope.
Malfoy looked up as the door swung open. The nurse said something that no one bothered to listen to, and the door closed, leaving silence hovering between them.
“This whole night has been full of weird shit, making you eggs won’t even make the top five. You can eat eggs?”
The crowd was gathered around the wizard on this end of the fight, and the whole lot seemed to be jeering at Malfoy. He must have done something to really piss them off. The bastard probably deserved what was coming to him, but Harry let his Auror instincts kick in as Malfoy’s rival raised his wand menacingly.
“Don’t you dare feed him my bacon!” called Ron through the door. “I splurged on the thick cut stuff.”
“We’re here. Whether we like it or not, we’re here.“ Did Harry get it? He couldn’t go. He shouldn’t.
HARRY: [ his arms come up, crossing over his chest a little protectively. ] Oh you know, the kind where you almost get killed by Death Eaters. The fun stuff that gains you more life experience than any child could possibly need. [ raises a hand and gives a bitter smile ] Next question?
“Yes!” he agreed. “And then you could have been the one with a frickin’ noodle arm. God, that was the worst.”
Harry walked into the kitchen to see Ron wrestling with a scarf that appeared to be down the sink drain. With the disposal on. He took a moment to take in the bizarre scene before darting over to the disposal switch and trying to flip it off, but it seemed to be jammed. Lovely.
“I think we oughta take this somewhere else,” Harry said. “But for your information, Malfoy,” he reached for Draco’s hand and intertwined their fingers, “as weird as this is, and as fucked up as we are, I um, I kinda like this. I don’t plan on going anywhere.”
“What, and you are?” Harry spun to face him. “You’re fine with the fact that you fought for the wrong side? You let Hermione get tortured? You watched as the kids you grew up with, your schoolmates, fought and died and you did shit. And that’s fine?”
“Would you shut up!” But then Ron was laughing too, and Harry was glad that even if nothing else added up, he always had this.
Harry had seen Malfoy angry. He’d seen him scared, and ashamed, but this was the first time he’d seen him look remorseful.
“Really you’re quite lucky I asked you out, it’s not like anyone else was going to with your awful fashion sense. At least you’ve got the scar thing going for you.”
RITA: Of course. You have every right to stand by that story; I won't press the issue. I must ask, though, dear, how does the Weasley girl feel about your sexual escapades?
Dwindling daylight danced on the leaves as they sped by, reds and yellows of early Fall decorated with the gold of evening until dusk swallowed the colors whole. It was dark when Harry found his hotel, bright as he stood in the flickering lights of the lobby, and dusty when he finally collapsed on the bed.
“I’d argue that it’s a lot better,” said Harry lowly. He stepped toward him. “People die no matter what, but when it’s the killing curse? It’s intentional. You have to mean it.”
RITA: [ she's waiting on a bench at the park. when she sees him, she stands and welcomes him, leaning forward to do a lil' air kiss by his cheek and motioning for him to sit down. ] Harry, darling, it's so good to see you, I do hope you're well.
Getting any work done after the strange events of early this morning would be difficult, but Harry wished Ron the same and was off to the subway.
“10 years.” Hermione did the math in her mind. “So he fancied you all through school,” she said incredulously.
Harry‘s mouth was gone. There was a soft thud. He was on his knees, hands on Draco’s thighs, and he asked “Do you want me here?”
As it continued to protrude from the sink, it began to bring all sorts of food scraps with it. Harry couldn’t see a thing but he heard the disposal give a couple loud clunks before settling into a soft whir.
The moment he heard ‘Potter’ being spit like that, the previous night’s events rushed through his head. “Shit.” Harry forced his eyelids to lift just a little bit. A wand was pointed directly at his face, and sure enough, he could just make out a blond-headed figure behind it.
Which was rubbish, complete bloody rubbish. Just because he happened to be into everything about Malfoy didn’t mean he was into Malfoy.
Hermione was staying at Grimmauld Place while she saved up for a flat, and he got glimpses into the world of magical law through notes scribbled on coffee-stained napkins, parchment scattered across the long oak table, and late night ramblings by the fire, so sure, he’d had a heads up. But the last person he imagined he’d be ordered to spy on was his school rival, war criminal, and overall scumbag Draco Malfoy.
“When I thought you were out of my life for good they kept plastering your face all over the news, milking every last drop of Harry-the Savior-Potter. But this last year or so... my life was finally starting to go somewhere.” Malfoy’s voice broke.
“We’re all fucked,” Potter concluded. “Don’t make such a big deal of it.” Just like that, his mask was back up. His shrug was casual, controlled.
“FUCK YOU, Potter! Don’t you dare say anything, this is your fault! If you hadn’t waltzed back into my life and—“
“But now that you’ve admitted that you weren’t really snogging me, how was snogging that other guy? I’ve always thought it’d be cool to be an actor. How’d I do, playing him?”
Harry let his eyes trail up and down Malfoy judgmentally, lingering on his lean torso and the veins that crawled up his arm with ferocity. It must take a lot of nerve for him to act as if he deserved any semblance of normalcy, let alone happiness.
Ron’s face looked like the portrait of depression itself. “That’s it. There’s no hope left for me. I’m entirely done for.”
“Ew!” he exclaimed, holding up a brownish sweater. “What is this? Half the things in your wardrobe shouldn’t be allowed to exist!”
Draco kissed the other like he had never kissed before, and Harry melted as if he were the vanilla ice cream they’d shared on that first night. As they wound their arms around each other, their friends and vague enemies forming a loose circle around them and beginning to clap, a moth fluttered by and glared at the scene.
“Would you let me finish? You refused to tell me where you lived so I took you here. If I hadn’t interfered you very well may have died then and there. You’re welcome.”
With that, Luna and her nest of carrots swiftly departed the car. Harry eyed the nuggetnut thing for a moment before slipping it into his pocket.
“The Dark Lord himself was onto me, I couldn’t be all that bothered by a self-centered prat with sub-par bullying skills.”
“Right.” Harry turned, but where bacon should have been there was only a flaming stretch of scarf. “Er, Ron?”
Not-quite-Harry raised his eyebrows. “Can’t stay away, can you, Malfoy?” He shoved Draco lightly, causing him to stumble back. “You may as well snog me,” he taunted, “the way you follow me around. It’s pathetic,” he hissed.
. He’d pictured himself holding Harry a thousand times, but never had he imagined Harry holding him.
Kumara didn’t seem to realize the irony of the situation, focused as he was on his mango lassis, but it felt reminiscent of the time Harry visited Hermione’s parents at work and watched them ask their patients questions only to stick metal things in their mouths. “I haven’t taken a vacation in—“ he began, only for the blender to start up again.
She flung her arms around him and squeezed. “Oh Harry, I’ve missed you!” He hugged her back, not wanting to let go.
, each Auror will be assigned a former Death Eater. You’ll follow them around for a week, make sure they aren’t up to any funny business―”
Harry shook his head in disbelief, saying “It’s seeming more and more like you’ve grown to be a half decent person.”
“Shut it, Ron...” Harry shifted in his bed. He didn’t remember it being so small. Or cold. Or uncomfortable.
HARRY: I think it's a good move. Would I have agreed in the past? Course not. But that's the whole point, moving on from old ways of thinking. Everyone deserves a second chance. I truly believe that now. [ expression just plain, to the point ]
“Not that I expect this to work. Obviously. I’m not an idiot,” he said, alone in his office. “But as long as you’re sitting around... I’d like... well, I’d like to feel, y’know, a romantic sort of attraction, as in...” The words came out in a rush. “I want to be in love.“
Harry felt his way toward the switch and turned it off. He chuckled again. Living with his best friend was an adventure of its own.
He knew this should be strange. He knew it wouldn't play out like this if it wasn’t so late, if Malfoy hadn’t had so much to drink, if Harry’s goddamn hero complex didn’t make half his decisions for him. But he pushed those thoughts from his mind and let himself enjoy this moment.
“We talked about our jobs. About the latest drama with Celestina Warbeck. We talked about plenty of meaningless shit but you never... that didn’t happen.”
“Let me buy you another drink.” Harry didn’t realize what he’d said until the words were out of his mouth.
Malfoy tried to sit up but immediately fell back down and rubbed his head. “What did I have last night?”
“I’m exhausted!” he said through another mouthful of bacon. “Thanks to that egotistical toothpick, I couldn’t get a wink of sleep last night. Pass the butter.”
The man looked solemnly off into space. Then, seeming to come to a decision, he said “Nahh, I don’t think it gets worse than that.”
She asked to see it, so he fished the dumb thing from the bottom of his bag and placed it in her hand.
“No, yeah, I was... kidding too. Fooled your gullible arse. Just thought it’d be funny to see the look on your face. If I played along, you know?”
Harry watched as a long-haired witch drunkenly kicked off her shoe and poured her glass of firewhisky into it.
Harry watched Malfoy’s retreating figure, wondering once again what the hell he’d gotten himself into but starting not to mind.
“Let’s have dinner together,” Kumara said, as if that was the next logical step in the conversation. Malfoy shot him a dirty look and Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
“I’m sorry for insulting Ron Weasley. And all of them, for that matter. They’re, each of them, they’re better people than my family combined, and I think I was…” Malfoy looked like he was in physical pain, “jealous, in a way.”
times” he plans to have at Hogwarts. “Personally, I want to just do all I can as a student to make Hogwarts a better, safe place for all sides to feel welcome. I want us to be better than we were before and start a legacy to be proud of.” His legacy certainly isn’t in line with the status quo, but Harry’s always had a reputation for being revolutionary.
Draco zipped his jeans, eyes darting around the room for anything he might have brought, and made for the door.
He wasn’t in Harry’s room or the laundry room. During a quick search of the living room, Harry contemplated whether or not he would feel guilty if he saw Malfoy’s face slapped on the Daily Prophet the next morning. He turned around to face the kitchen and saw a thin young man sitting criss cross applesauce on the tile floor holding a carton of ice cream.
“Ron,” said Hermione, who was also there. Her voice had a soft quality to it. She looked him up and down, with his red shirt layered on top of blue, and smiled. "It's been awhile."
Many drinks later they were stumbling down the road. As they passed a large, intricate clock on the side of a building with Roman Numerals that indicated it was nearing 11, Malfoy interrupted their laughter.
The light stubble spattered across Malfoy’s cheeks was rougher, and the cloth caught a couple times. His lips were dry. They were parted slightly, so they moved as Harry gently wet them with the cloth.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “At least someone’s reliably consistent with their emotions. Though it can’t be too difficult when you have the emotional maturity of a 4-year-old.”
“WHAT?” yelled Ron, who had somehow magically appeared on the scene. They are wizards, after all. “You’re into
A shithead, yes. There was no denying that. But a boy with a lot of hurt? He was that, too. And as rotten as he’d been, it hadn’t stopped Harry from living a hell of a life.
This time, when he leaned down, it was to ask forgiveness. His lips landed on this stranger’s jaw and he imagined it was Harry’s.
They simmered down into silence, scooping rice onto their plates and eating. Most of the quiet moments Harry experienced these days were brief breaths of the lonely air in his flat between shifts. This, though, this was comfortable. By some ludicrous jumble of circumstances, this felt like camaraderie.
Their mouths collided. Skin on skin, heat flaring between them, hands everywhere and urgent. The man bit Draco’s lip gently. Draco whimpered, cursing himself for it, but the man ground more fiercely against him and did it again.
The parlour was almost empty of people, with the exception of Greyback and Pettigrew, with the former having evidently captured the latter. The Dark Lord scanned the room with his bloodshot eyes and found Lucius Malfoy’s Ministry work abandoned and stained with ink, as well as a tray with a considerable number of biscuits upon it. Yet there were no followers to eat the snacks, and no Lucius to try and save his documents. Further, he did not see any trace of Bellatrix, who would otherwise jump at every chance to be as close to him as possible, even if she never touched him without his stated permission.
After adding his plate and fork to the self washing dishes, Kreacher turned towards Harry. As their eyes met, Harry noticed hesitation in the large, brown orbs which were Kreacher’s eyes. “Kreacher should mention to Master that he will bring him to the former Mistress’ abode, will that be acceptable?”
Unbeknownst to Molly, someone in that very room could access her thoughts, and had been passively listening to her existential crisis since the moment which she entered the room. Not because he desired to, but because he had little choice in the matter but to listen.
“There is a mirror in front of you,” Draco reminded him as he turned Harry’s head forward once more.
Finally, he pulled the two pieces out and carefully placed them together again. Sirius had been very surprised to learn that one of his old wands was still in his desk drawer. It wasn’t perfect for him, but he really didn't have any other options for the moment. Thus, he made do with the child-teenage sized wand. Repairing the envelope was easy, so very easy that he felt like he could have done it without using his wand.
Al did not look any calmer as he studied Harry’s face, “nobody has said that the snake is a she. How did you know that, Harry?”
Albus has told me that he doesn’t want me to speak to his son about lacking moral questions and theoretical magical discussions which touch on Dark Arts, but the teenager is still young and his mind is untainted by the idea that Dark Arts is evil by itself. With him, I feel challenged and appreciated all at once, and I cannot deny myself this amusement simply because a father is worried about his son learning too much. How foolish! As if you could ever learn enough.
“You think so? Why, I think he almost looked more decent when I was asked to confirm if he was dead.”
“Yeah, I was also thinking of looking for work in one of those,” Fred agreed. He then added, “I’m still free for the evening, are you sure you don’t want to turn the Slytherin banners pink?”
Molly was steadily learning that her version of reality was not as true as she had always believed it to be, through the simple means of interacting with the real world, rather than her books and her fantasies.
When the immediate material demand having been dealt with, Harry turned towards the person in the chair. He had already hugged the man once, so he did it again, sternly reminding himself that Severus was almost his step-dad and being unable to hug him was probably more curious than not daring to. Thus, in quite the werewolf-like fashion, Severus was hugged by the far smaller, and not so much werewolf, son of a werewolf. He blinked at the action before he gave in and allowed himself to hug Harry back, exchanging a familiar embrace with one another. A real one, which Severus evidently desperately needed.
He nodded and placed his hands upon his hips, frowning bitterly. “Kreacher does not think Master Sirius deserves it, but… It was left for him.” He sighed, shaking his head with a displeased frown. He didn’t meet Harry’s gaze as he continued to speak. “Would Master Harry be able to give it to him?”
Harry’s mouth had fallen open when he realised what he was reading, yet his confusion was slowly turning into amusement. Next to Harry, Draco chuckled into his hand as a fit of laughter claimed him while Teddy had done like most other students around the hall, and was cheering for whoever had caused the change of the banners to happen.
“Seems unreasonable,” Teddy agreed as he grinned down at Ron with familiarity and friendly love. “You dingus. Just had to be the hero, huh?”
“No,” Molly replied in a simple manner. “I think… I think I feel free. I was so weighed down by all of it… all of my doubts and fears and thoughts. You mean a lot to me, Arthur. Our family, especially our children, mean a lot to me but… Well… I think I forgot somewhere that I’m supposed to mean something to myself as well. I thought that I had failed you as a wife, bu-”
He took no offense to Andromeda teasing him for his general preference of everything which Walpurga Black found unsuitable for him. Sirius might have been in love, possibly still was, with one person above everyone else, but he was not a stranger to different arms and welcoming lips, even if he had yet to be with anyone who might become pregnant from the encounter.
“He said… I think… something like ‘how far I’ve sunken’ and how he regretted having to take a child hostage. Then he said something about not hurting me, as long as I stayed still and was of use to him.”
Maybe… maybe Crabbe had actually always been like this. Maybe Harry simply hadn’t seen it because they had been friends.
The prospect of getting answers made it somewhat hard to focus on the lessons of the day for Harry. He felt like time didn’t pass quickly enough, yet he somehow found himself standing before the door to Albus’ office while feeling like almost no time had passed at all. The day had elapsed too quickly, and yet it didn’t feel as if it had happened at all as Harry gathered his journal and approached the stairs which lead up to the Headmaster’s office and up towards his door. His heart was slamming in his chest, impossibly loud and impossibly real. His hands were sweaty and his head felt too warm and too small for all his thoughts. Harry noticed that his mouth was dry, but no amount of swallowing appeared to be helping.
“Naturally,” Severus turned away from his future son, yet spoke loud enough for the young man to still hear him before he walked away. “You have never done anything but.”
to Remus so that he might inspect his work. They discussed the inclusion of certain runes or phrases, but no matter what Remus asked about, the magical genius could motivate every change and addition. When they had gone over everything, Remus was satisfied with the fact that the magic would be stable.
Over by the Gryffindor table, Hermione, Neville and Ron exchanged equally worried and uncomfortable looks as most of their table began to verbally object. Gryffindors may not be accurately liked by everyone in the school, yet the House was not entirely confined to itself like Slytherin was. Some of the older students even booed, and Colin’s voice could be heard somewhere within the midst of objections as he yelled “That’s bull!”
“You did it again! You are mocking me!” Filch barked at Harry, turning to face him in what appeared to be a fit of rage.
Another attempt at speaking made Harry hiss at her, and so, he gave up and transformed back into himself. The noises came back first, making him feel rather dizzy. Draco was still on the floor, and so Harry allowed himself to fall back into his lap, groaning softly.
“How did you, well… know that I was not a supposed beloved child?” Remus asked after licking his lips.
“Which is also a reason as to why we don’t believe in the Pureblood supremacy of that so-called Dark Lord of yours,” Sarmad rather changed topics, but not entirely. “We may be proclaimed Dark creatures, but we need mage blood to survive. If they had their ways, then it would only be supposedly pure blood left, and the one thing those prissy mages refuse to part with is their oh so precious blood.” He finished with a huff.
“So that was why he took the Marauders’ Map from us!” George couldn’t help but stomp his foot with excitement, which once again made the dogs think that it was time to play. They jumped to their feet and barked, but the older and younger generation of Marauders didn’t pay the animals any attention, which made them start to wrestle on their own.
A further note on this very widespread topic is that emotional pain has curious effects on the human brain, it sometimes creates near physical pain because it does not understand what is hurting and reacts in the ways it undertands. This is not something predictable and controllable.
“I’m not so sure I will manage, but fine.” Ron gathered himself and sat up, looking between Harry and Luna. “It could help me take my mind off things.”
Teddy blinked at him with his large, brown eyes, carefully staring at him as if he was an animal which was trying to seize a human up to determine if the person was dangerous or not. Teddy licked his lips before opening them, revealing a truth which George wasn’t ready to hear.
Time was running ever forward, and in its wake, May ended, Hermione and Neville finished the Floo Powder, and Lord Voldemort decided to set a date for the operation.
The happiness in Harry’s eyes had been replaced with a look of pain and worry as he listened to Colin’s retelling.
His past lovers are supportive. Hermione, the dark-haired wix who had a torrid affair with Viktor Krum, has stuck by his side, and the youngest Weasley approves of his promiscuous life choices. “Ginny has been there for me through a lot. She's not the type to judge someone for how they choose to live their life in that respect.”
Harry felt Malfoy shiver next to him, but his words didn’t slow down. “Fired from the Ministry? I can’t imagine a single decent place that’d accept that resumé. And you were promoted.” He shook his head. “Fucking privilege. But to shut you down when you were protecting your team is beyond stupid. If they had any sense, they’d know there’s no one else they should count on more.” Malfoy angrily took a swig of his drink.
Malfoy grabbed thin glass plates from the cupboard and passed one to Harry. “Feel free to serve yourself.”
Squinting, he saw that he was taller, and had a slender face and dark eyes. He had a softness about him that was nothing like the war-torn ferocity of the Chosen One.
Draco had been itching to ask since Harry had shown him the gun, but it had seemed too rocky after yesterday’s trip to the clearing.
“For Merlin’s sake Malfoy, if you’re not going to rinse off then I will. Don’t. Touch. Anything. I’ll be back to deal with you in a minute.”
Harry glanced down at his hand where Draco’s had touched it. He looked back up at Draco, eyes skittering across his face, his hair, his lips.
“-when Draco bloody Malfoy walks over to us and gives you a big ol’ hug! Totally gross, am I right?”
The sky was just beginning to dim and a pleasant purple glow grazed the streets of Diagon Alley. They sat leaning against an old vacant building, very slightly pressing into one another.
“That Weasel girl...” Malfoy tried to drop the words lightly into their comfortable silence, but they landed hard. Harry shifted. “You mean Ginny.”
If they were at each other’s throats now, how was dinner a decent plan? What, they would chit chat about what they’d been up to since the mass-murder of muggles that Malfoy was complacent to sit by and watch? But Harry had a job to do, and walking away now would hardly be sufficient. If this annoyingly cheerful stranger wanted to make his work easier, by all means, he could go right ahead.
“Well then,” said Harry, awkwardly clapping Malfoy on the back. He didn’t quite realize until their skin made contact that Malfoy was shirtless. “I’m gonna go grab a cloth.” He couldn’t tell what was worse: having to stare at Malfoy’s face or his chest. “To wash your, erm, to get you cleaned up. Right then.“ He dipped out of the room.
“You wish.” Draco shot him a glance and immediately regretted it. Harry looked wild, hair even more tousled by the wind and light green eyes flashing in contrast with his dark skin. He filed the image away for later.
Please tell me this is a bad dream. Not like the one with the water buffalos, that was killer, especially when Ginerva waved a red flag like she was some bullfighter, which, honestly, wouldn't be surprising with how buff she's getting thanks to quidditch, and—“
When Draco grabbed a handful of fabric at the collar and yanked him closer, the stranger gasped into his mouth and deepened the kiss. Cold fingers lifted the hem of Draco’s shirt, slipping under, roaming.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He’d had more than enough sweet smiles and cruel words with Umbridge, and he wasn’t about to let this woman get away with that. He opened his mouth to say something, just as amber liquid splashed down Emina’s front.
Malfoy was hovering at the edge of his own kitchen, fingers drumming nervously on the counter, giving Kumara a look that Harry couldn’t quite read and Kumara didn’t seem bothered by.
Reminiscing about his various escapades, he fondly recalls a particular event that left a lasting effect: “the one where I just couldn't eat until I had an orgy.” When asked how the orgy was when it finally did happen, Harry describes it as “utterly orgasmic.” Having had enough limelight in his youth to last him a lifetime, though, he’s reluctant to share details. “I didn't realise my every hook up had been made public now, Rita,” he tells me with a bashful laugh. But surrounded by the delicate fauna of a local park, he continues to open up about the times he opened up. “I needed something dramatic to do. I needed some phases and reckless choices. After all, don't I deserve it?” he asks, and the ghost of war shimmers in his eyes. Taking a deep breath, he turns to face me. “And I'm enjoying every last minute of it.”
Draco nearly made a quip about how he could just set it down on the bleachers or his lap, but he took the cloth from Harry.
Rain. Of course there was rain. Not even the exciting, thunder-ridden, torrential kind, but the kind that made Harry blink behind lightly misted glasses. Just enough to be a nuisance. The coffee shop was a lovely little thing from the outside, no signs reading ‘mudbloods beware’ or ‘warning: this building contains an irritating prick.’ Harry wiped his glasses on his jeans, put them back on, realized they were only blurrier, and stepped inside.
“Says you.” Malfoy eyed Harry with curiosity. “You want to explain why you freaked out on me earlier?”
HARRY: Yeah, you're right. I considered staying away, but [ there's a much more genuine, fond smile ] Hogwarts is my home. Always has been. There will be difficulties in returning, but overall, it's for a positive experience.
Obligingly, Harry stumbled to his feet. In one swift movement, Malfoy stood and grabbed his wand off the coffee table and then disappeared into thin air.
“But dude, homie, pal. For real. If it means you’ll stop moping around all the time, I’m in full support.”
“There,” mumbled Harry. He put out his hand for the cloth. Draco handed it to him, lingering for just a moment. Warm, calloused, dry.
He glanced around for his wand and grabbed it from the grimy ground. He performed a quick spell to stop the bleeding, and put his arms beneath Malfoy’s knees and shoulders. “We need to get you to the hospital.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “It was plain apple cider, and it was godawful. If anything, I need a milkshake, but as much as I’d love to spend my evening with an ungrateful prick, I have better things to do.”
HARRY: [ oh rita we love you he's brow raising and he really, really resists an eye roll ] I don't think anyone has the intention to make things negative. After all, this is all about reform and doing better than we did before, right? I just mean physically, being back somewhat that holds a lot of traumatic memories for people could be an obstacle. [ very calm he's doing so well look at him being all fake professional ]
“You wanna…” said the man, panting. “My room, end of the hall.” He gestured and they fumbled in that direction.
“They’re in every book on Herbology,” she said as if normal people actually read those. “The point is you used your wish for love, and it tried to land you with Malfoy of all people.”
Just then, the men’s bathroom door swung open and a bloke with warm brown skin a bit darker than Harry’s made his way toward her. He put his arm around the woman and she melted into him, smiling contently. Harry didn’t blame her for looking so happy. He had calm eyes and muscular arms. His jawline was strong, cheekbones high set, and smile just a tiny bit dorky. Overall, he was incredibly attractive. For a dude. Harry quickly broke his gaze from the fairly average couple and looked over at his friend.
The look-alike’s flat was clean and smelt like tea. Draco had half a mind to find the bedroom, but this man writhed impatiently under his touch, pressed up against the hallway wall, and Draco felt on top of the world.
Harry snorted. “I grew up with soulless idiots, and not all muggles go around shooting things anyway.”
Recognition flashed across Kumara’s face and he shot Malfoy a self-satisfied look. He must be a wizard, then, as he clearly recognized the name.
This time, he knew what to expect. The bang sent a jolt through his body but he paid it no mind, squinting instead at where the bottle had been. It was still there.
There was Ron. And there was Luna every morning and... and that was it. That was the extent of his social life at this point. That, and the wasted man last night.
“Great. Figured. Anyway, Granger. I was a massive prick toward her even though she’s twice as intelligent—“
“All wishes can be sorted into one of three categories: love, time, and material. These markings here show that you used yours to alter time.”
Malfoy looked down out himself. “Who the bloody hell did this to me?! I paid 200 Galleons for this shirt! Was this you?!”
“Yeah, we’re fucked up. And— And I have no right to be telling you how to— shit, I don’t even have the right to talk you.”
Harry laughed and turned to look at Malfoy who seemed not to notice the arm around him. The spoiled kid who had made their lives miserable for years was standing in their hallway, leaning into the boy he hated more than anything, and drunkenly glaring at a moth on the wall.
He grabbed the hem of his expensive shirt and started tugging on it. “Malfoy,” Harry said, trying to interject before he got blame for yet another disaster. “Stop, you’re going to― Let me help you get that off― Will you stop that!”
“Great. Seeya, Dray.” He winked, Malfoy glared, and then it was just the two of them standing in the kitchen.
“Alright, alright, but he sure didn’t bring any peace to my dreams. Lemme tell ya, first it was Neville and I on that one staircase in Hogwarts, you know with the really weird portrait of the baby, except the stairs were made of-“
“You know, Won Won, you could always track down Lavender Brown,” Harry offered only partially sarcastically.
“Uh... blue. Have you seen a tall, boring stack of yellow files anywhere? I can’t remember where I put them.”
The man placed a kiss on the corner of his mouth. He sucked Draco’s bottom lip. He kissed him fully.
RITA: [ reluctantly moves to the next question, but she's taking notes ] How do you feel about former Death Eaters being welcomed to Hogwarts?
“Rice is on the table, meat’s on the stove, it’s almost done,” he said, shoving Malfoy lightly on the arm. “Enjoy dinner. Will I see you tomorrow, Harry?”
Harry slapped a wad of Muggle money on the counter and Draco took it, counting out the change by feel without breaking eye contact. He mirrored Harry’s steel gaze if only to avoid revealing anything else. They’d pretend they didn’t know each other. It was a freak coincidence and since neither of them wanted to interact, they’d keep it brief and businesslike. No need to dwell on their mutual hatred, or lie to themselves by feigning forgiveness, and certainly no need for Draco to get his hopes up only to have them squandered.
“Literally everything at that school was trying to kill you, I could have taken some of that off your back.”
“Nobody shut up about his eyes, which was obnoxious, because it made me feel less original when I admired them. They were green, and sharp, and — He was funny. And a complete idiot. The kid almost got himself killed at least once a year. No— No, don’t laugh, I’m dead serious.” Draco huffed out a laugh himself, realizing the concept of regular near-death experiences sounded ludicrous, and he hadn’t even mentioned giant snakes or magic rocks. Potter truly was an idiot.
He looked at Draco with a mischievous smile. “Maybe we should go at it again, and I’ll pretend you’re him.”
Harry is trying to sort things out; both facts and feelings. He does, and he doesn’t do it alone, for once. We get some more character variety in this chapter!
Harry sat down in the chair by the hospital bed. “You’re tying to tell me you got beat up because you defended someone else? That’s not the image I remember.”
The blond head tilted up. Malfoy looked at Harry for a moment, and then he laughed. Of all the different ways to react, he actually laughed. It was light, and brief, but it made Harry smile.
“Oh.” Draco had never known much about Harry Potter’s home life; he assumed they, too, had treated him like a savior. Maybe not.
Harry woke up to a raging headache. And smooth blue fabric. On a person. Why was there a person? He pushed himself up just enough to see Malfoy.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, not sure how to respond to the casual honesty. “Right. Well.” He considered staying. Considered asking what was for dessert. “I best be off, then,” he said.
His hands were cradling Draco’s head, thumbs brushing the short hair behind his ears, fingers curling in the long ghostly waves on top. Draco sighed into his mouth.
“It’s— well, it sounds cheesy as shit,” began Kumara, “but it really is just time. Getting over someone takes time. You’ll be okay.”
Leaning down, Draco dragged his tongue across his collarbone and pressed a leg between his legs. There was a groan, a grinding of hips. Draco’s pulse was thudding in more places than one.
An hour passed, and still, he sat there. Draco lifted his apron to dab sweat away. One hour turned to two, then three, until he only had ten minutes left of his shift. There was a lull in customers and he dipped into the back room to compose himself. He’d approach Harry — he’d be a coward if he didn’t — but he would do so with dignity. Calm, collected, cool. His delivery would make diplomats around the world jealous.
“You really are that fond of him, aren’t you.” There was no trace of judgement in her voice, and when he searched her eyes trying to figure out what she was thinking, all he could find was love and acceptance.
The words were out before Draco could convince himself he shouldn’t say them. “And you want to relive that?”
Sure, there were parts of sex that made Draco want to vomit. Things that reminded him of the man he’d shagged after his trial, rough and demanding, or Fenrir Greyback in those dark months at the Manor.
Not-quite-Harry snaked an arm around his shoulders. Draco found himself lying on that arm. His cheek rested on not-quite-Harry’s shoulder, and not-quite-Harry was holding him.
His own cowardice held him back. The same cowardice that kept him sniveling on the wrong side of the war. There were so many times he could have been brave enough. But he wasn’t. His schoolmates died and it was his fault. Potter would never see him as anything more than wicked and weak, and he was right.
“Look, Ronald,” she said. “During the war, everything was just… it was so intense. I needed to breathe, to figure myself out, but… We should catch up. Over coffee.”
“Glad to see we’ve reached a point of civility,” Harry said sarcastically, crossing his arms and raising a brow.
And so they sat, allowing themselves to look at each other with kind eyes for a moment. This time, it wasn’t fueled by alcohol or tired delirium; it just was, and it did something nice to Harry’s chest that he couldn’t quite describe.
Harry plopped down on the couch, fraying at the edges but otherwise in good condition. “Well? Are you gonna sit?”
“Denial,” Hermione said with authority, but her assured expression faltered. “Then again, he’s a Slytherin, and he’s Malfoy. How can you be sure what to trust?”
Harry feels strongly that former Death Eaters should join in on the fun. “After all, this is all about reform and doing better than we did before, right? I just mean physically,” he says.
Suddenly, “Hello again!” came brightly from the door. Malfoy yanked his hand away and cold air took its place. Exhaling an awkward laugh, Harry reached his arm behind his head and rubbed his neck, and a glance at Malfoy revealed that his face was a bit flushed.
HARRY: It's the purpose of all of this, isn't it? [ he scoffs a bit. yeah he has no belief in the words he's spewing here ] I dare to have hope.
A waiter approached the table, and Emina ordered a salad with no dressing and extra olives. Harry panicked and ordered the first thing he read on the menu, which was spaghetti.
“Pansy? No, Merlin no. Not anyone I’ve ever had anything with. Never will, for that matter. I wouldn’t have dreamed of cheating on Astoria, anyway, but she told me my heart wasn’t in the right place. That if I cared about her, I needed to stop living in denial. So. That’s that, I guess.”
A heavy arm draped across his back, and Harry felt like he’d solved the problem. He was too tired to get up just yet, though. He’d move in a little bit, but for now, he was so comfortable like this. And Malfoy’s breathing was slowing. It was all very relaxing...
He didn’t. He owed this man nothing. He was miserably embarrassed, and this man had no business exploiting that.
“You, me, Dray,” he continued with nonchalance. “You two clearly know each other, and I’d love to get better acquainted with you.”
“Fuck off,” said the stranger harshly, yanking back. Draco winced, hit by shock and cold air. His hands hovered where they had been holding the man’s waist.
The two of them managed to get things cleaned up pretty quickly. After complaining loudly about Harry’s recent absence around the flat, Ron gave him an affectionate pat on the back and wished him a good day at work.
Harry sipped from the milkshake straw once more, and then snatched it from his hands, fingers brushing. “Fine, you win. It’s actually pretty good.”
Malfoy glared at him. “It’s only been 10 fucking years, did I forget to mention that part last night? 10 years of hiding it, and I did it bloody well, damn alcohol.”
As dusk begins to fall around us, Harry lets me in on the most heartbreaking aspect of the whole ordeal. All of this is a desperate attempt to make up for the loss of life that came about because of him. He freely admits that it’s his fault. “It was on me to stop it,” he says, voice low. “I didn't do it quick enough. It's on me.”
“My waist,” he clarified. “Being held there. I uh, it just reminds me of some things I’d rather not think about.”
Not until he was sitting there alone in the early morning air did he realize that Malfoy was still wearing his shirt.
Harry looked at him cautiously. “I showed you because it’s something I do, and— it’s nice, being around you. You don’t pretend.”
So Draco stepped toward him. He didn’t know what Harry was asking for, or how this was supposed to play out.
Suddenly, a crash echoed from around the corner. A shrill voice screamed “YOU DON’T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT MY FATHER!”
Harry managed to conclude one thing from Luna’s speech, and he didn’t like it at all. The magic clump of dirt probably wasn’t the reason for his attraction. And if it wasn’t, that meant he was.
“People think he’s pure evil. And yeah, he’s done a lot of―  but... he’s still... my dad. And how am I ever suppose to be anything decent if I’m already labeled as just an echo of that. Fuck, I dunno. But I couldn’t just stand there and take it.”
Ron had been trying to set up the both of them for months now. Since Ginny broke up with Harry and Hermione expressed the need to focus on herself and her career, the redhead had declared them bachelors and done everything in his power to fill the void these two strong young women in their lives had left. So far, no success. Their shared apartment continued to get quieter and messier.
And so the two ridiculously drunk men made their way to Draco Malfoy’s cheap flat on a Sunday night, of all the times to be ridiculously drunk.
They sat on the bleachers facing an empty Quidditch field and a cloudy sky. Harry was cleaning his gun.
Shame curled around his wrists, snaked down his legs. Buzzing energy coursed through him as he thought of Harry’s voice lowering with sarcasm, Harry’s eyebrows knitting with concentration, Harry thinking he hid his sadness well. He remembered his father’s warning about lusting after boys, and emptiness raked his stomach.
HARRY: [ a boi got whiplash damnit he ain't laughing anymore. his face drops and boy is she getting a
Mindy, the owner of the old fashioned ice cream shop on Diagon Alley, called to him from her counter. “You okay, Harry?”
Back to back, like true warriors, Harry set to work putting out the fire while Ron created more chaos.
“Well I’ll sit with you. Anytime.” She flashed him a smile. Since Harry had stuck around and helped her clean up one night about a year ago, she’d given him everything half off. She was quite friendly.
“Time.” He could practically see the gears turning in her head. “All the times you and Malfoy wound up together. Far too often to be coincidence. Harry, that first night when you rescued Malfoy from the bar fight, did you think to yourself at any point that evening or the next morning that you wanted to run into him more often?”
Malfoy frowned. Harry brushed strands of blond hair out of his face and muttered “This’ll only take a minute. Then both of us can get to sleep and pretend it never happened.” But Malfoy didn’t seem to register his words. His gaze stayed trained on Harry, who was gently sweeping a cool cloth across his damp forehead.
“You’d think I’d have learned by now never to trust Fred. Well, he gave me this ruddy thing for Christmas, said it was real handy. ‘Choose-your-own-length! Just tug on it and it’ll get longer.’ Only problem is, it doesn’t shrink back up. And now I’m here.”
Real laughter bubbled from Draco and caught him by surprise. “Potter,” he said condescendingly, though the effect was marred by giggles, “I went through that much effort to make your life miserable and that’s what you reduce me to?”
The man who’d been lingering in the corner now stood at Malfoy’s side saying “Hey, Dray, it’s chill, calm down,” and touching his arm. The violent streak in Harry crash landed, replaced with pure disdain for Malfoy — ‘Dray’ — and his new life in which he relaxed around this stranger and stepped back from Harry. As an Auror, Harry didn’t get the luxury of normalcy. Every day was another battle as if the war hadn’t ended but merely tapered out to a dull hum of violence and petty crime that Harry could never escape, and here Malfoy was, making friends and letting the past conveniently slip from his mind.
But it was a gun that his bony fingers trembled around, not a wand. Embarrassed, he looked up at the target. It was still there. Not even a scratch.
He needed to focus. This was an exchange, and he needed to play his part. So he pretended again. He darted his tongue in to graze Harry’s, again to run along his teeth. But imagining Harry only made it worse because this man was being too gentle.
The waves of emotion were heavy and harsh, and in the midst of them, he felt strangely at peace. His grip strengthened and he channeled everything toward the firewhiskey label.
“I want you I want you I want you, Harry, Harry Potter, Harry I want you.” His voice broke. He felt small and desperate and freer than he had in a long time.
Harry felt someone pat his arm, and he turned to see Luna, this time with turnips in her hair. She smiled up at him. “Congratulations, Harry.”
RITA: [ she smiles sweetly and nods her head ] Did you feel the need to experiment after having your adolescent years stolen from you? [ i'm sorry she's terrible ]
“Nothing.” Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was getting at, he just knew there was a lot of hurt in the way Malfoy had talked about his father. “Pass the pepper?”
“Don’t worry about it.” She smiled. “I just don’t want to see this sad excuse for food on the bill.” He nodded and walked away, flustered.
Harry couldn’t tell whether or not he was being sarcastic, but he was clearly getting drowsier by the second and getting him to clean himself wasn’t worth the effort. “You look downright awful.” He lowered onto his knees so he could reach Malfoy's annoyingly angular face.
So why did Harry linger in the shop? Why did he keep glancing at Draco over his cup and, more importantly, why did Draco care?
The cobblestones beneath Harry’s feet got darker and more jagged, and a chill down his back caused him to look up. Knockturn Alley. He must have taken a wrong turn.
Memories of the Manor flitted like ghosts at the edge of his vision; ice in Aunt Bella’s eyes, bars through which he and Luna exchanged whispers, the cold weight of guilt.
Harry studied him with the scrutiny of sixth year, searching for any sign that he was lying. “You’ve just been embracing the muggle lifestyle, then? I can’t imagine Bath is a major wizard hub.”
He opened his mouth to say something but Harry beat him to the punch, stuttering “I swear I didn’t mean it, I didn’t know what I was doing, I didn’t think-“
HARRY: [ goddamnit rita he's just very quiet in thought for a bit. back to some tapping and playing with his rings ] I want to bury the hatchet.
Harry snorted, actually snorted, at the image of barista Malfoy. ‘Hi, what can I get you? We have cappuccinos, biscuits, and a free side of murder and mayhem brought to you by our sponsor, the Dark Lord himself! Lovely weather, isn’t it?’ He shoved the parchment into his brown bag and huffed at the window. It fogged, blurring the image of passing trees.
But the memory of Malfoy’s harsh voice just hours earlier snapped Harry back into reality. His own feelings were a sappy mess, but maybe they’d be met with coldness and he could stop worrying about all this.
Draco looked up at the other, orbs shining with gentle vulnerability. He stepped toward Harry and kissed him. Their lips fit together perfectly, and Harry pressed into the kiss.
It had been years since the two had laid eyes upon each other. Something stirred inside Harry’s stomach at the sight of him ― a resentful sort of nostalgia ― but he looked worse than ever. Pale blond hair plastered across paler skin, bags under bloodshot eyes, skinny frame shaking; he was a wreck. A drunken wreck, as evident by his drooping, shivering stance and the way his sloppy attempts at spells hit everything except his opponent.
Their hands brushed for the fifth time in two days, if you count apparating. Harry began re-assembling the gun.
“Heartbreak is shit,” he said. “I’ve been through it a couple times. The worst part is trying to convince yourself you’re over it, even when every little thing reminds you of them. It could be a purple sock, and you’re all ‘So-and-so liked the color blue, and that’s close to purple.’ I don’t know. It sucks.”
HARRY: [ he gives it some thought, a content look of musing on his face, fingers tapping idly against the bench ] Personally, I want to just do all I can as a student to make Hogwarts a better, safe place for all sides to feel welcome. I want us to be better than we were before and start a legacy to be proud of.
“Talked to Millie half a year ago. Millicent. Pans and Blaise, though? I don’t know. I think we’re all trying to forget about it. Distance ourselves.”
Leather jacket. Scruffy dark hair and warm brown skin, nearly amber under the red lights. Achingly familiar.
“Harry Potter,” he said reluctantly, partaking in the handshake and eyeing the way Kumara’s other hand rested on Malfoy’s back.
His stomach twisted in on itself, mind reeling back to that moment in the bathroom. He had long since shut it out, but finding himself with his wand pointed at a blood-drenched Malfoy, his insides curled with guilt and anger and fear of his own power and a dozen words unspoken.
The stranger’s eyes were sharp, but they softened, and he laughed awkwardly. “That was… an intense reaction, I didn’t mean to… sorry. Boundaries, I guess. I’ve got some weird ones. Had a few too many unpleasant experiences, you know what I mean?”
HARRY: [ i’m so glad damnit coz petty potter is now in full swing goddamnit harry ur gonna get urself into messes ] You know what Rita you are absolutely right. I needed something dramatic to do. I needed some phases and reckless choices. After all, don't I deserve it? [ harry ,, harry pls the sarcasm s t o p ] And I'm enjoying every last minute of it.
Mother always said rain washed away your sins. It was likely a desperate attempt to cope with her own plethora of misdeeds, but it stuck with Draco nonetheless, and though he knew he’d racked up enough sins to go to Hell twice, there was still something refreshing about the misty blue morning. He shut the door behind him, breathed out the stale air of his flat, and breathed in the moisture.
Was this rhetorical? It seemed like a strange thing to ask. But his expression was one of light teasing, and Draco figured he’d already dug himself a hole.
“—so I’m sorry for that. And… And when she was… When you were at the manor, and my aunt… my aunt was
Draco grabbed his fork and gestured at Harry. “You, okay, even you have to admit that was pretty hilarious.”
Just then, the unsteady boy lurched against Harry and vomited all over his shoulder. Harry could feel the warm, chunky substance dripping down his back as he chocked out the the last word of his sentence. “...mess.”
“Why’d you show me how to…?” he tried to sound conversational. The question hovered between them. Harry said nothing.
“I see the way you look at me.” He whispered it like it was a secret for just the two of them. “And I can’t say I haven’t thought about it too. I could give you what you want. If you ask for it,” Harry said, a low growl grating the edges of his voice and making Draco shiver.
He tried his best to open the door without letting it creak. His eyes lingered on the figure in his bed for a moment, and he closed the door behind him.
RITA: [ she smiles sympathetically and pats his knee ] Thank you so much for being willing to chat with me, love, I know it must be difficult to talk about these things.
Malfoy was sitting comfortably on the edge of his bed in his t-shirt, and looked up at the sound of Harry entering. “Potter! It’s been years. Do I look good?”
Harry nodded slowly, a bit distracted by the angular features of Malfoy’s face and how smooth they looked in the dim light, but he was appreciative of the advice. “If you say so.”
Luna placed a hand on his and looked into his eyes intently. “I have something for you. I was going to deliver it to Mrs. Squashknobbler, but I have a couple more in my garden and I think you need it more.”
Harry looked down. He shrugged. Looked up. “That time I found you in the bathroom. Crying. It reminded me of that.”
“Look,” he said. “You’re not going to forgive me, and you shouldn’t. But while you’re in my home for some godforsaken reason, let’s get some things out in the open.”
“You have a point. The time isn’t right for just any old milkshake. I think I’m going to need a shot in mine.”
Picking at his nail polish, Draco watched the small black flecks float to the floor of the club. They blended in with the grime.
Hermione’s office was filled with books. She had four bookshelves; three of them were large and made of dark wood while the other was small and carved with intricate designs. Everything from old, dusty volumes to the latest research journals lined the shelves, and as if that wasn’t enough, she had stacks all the way to the ceiling and a pile on her desk.
Sweeping his hair back, Ron squinted through the mingling crowd at a lady across the room. “I think I’ve found her. You know what this means; time to turn on the tact.”
“Yeah.” Harry sipped his milkshake and pondered how much to say to Malfoy, but words were coming out of his mouth before he knew it. “Sixth year, first. The war put things on hold, I guess. But afterward we picked it back up and we were fine, good, for a year or so.”
Ron slumped to the floor. A tattered knit pattern surrounded him like a giant, tangled nest, and he sat in the middle, as slimy and wet and miserable as a freshly-hatched baby bird.
The spinning blades in the sink drain sucked up the scarf, and yet it only seemed to be getting longer on their end.
“Seen much of your old friends lately?” he asked. If they were planning some terrorist attack, they’d have to unify again first.
Harry laughed dryly and turned his attention to the table, laying enough money down for the dinner and another couple of handfuls for the tip. When he’d finished, Malfoy was still standing there.
If you wanna creatively collaborate in any way, leave a comment and we can get connected! Lemme know what you thought of this. And, because the world is a scary place right now, stay safe and know that I'm sending love and support your way.
The searing hot water cleared his muddled head. Harry let himself relax completely for a moment. Only a moment, because his adrenaline kept him moving and before he knew it he was aggressively drying his hair with a towel. Dried and dressed, he slipped the lumpy prune into the pocket of his pajamas. He didn’t want to face Luna’s disappointment if she found out he rejected her nargle nugget. His left hand flicked off the light while his right hand flung open the bathroom door.
Deep blue sky rolled in gently with the silence. Malfoy shot down his urge to make a comment about the Weasleys and instead let Harry process.
Except this one was in a gay bar in Muggle London and caught him staring. He started to walk over, a soft smile on his face. Well shit.
As he meandered across the cobblestones back toward work, he tried to find something else to think about, and his thoughts landed on love.
“Nah mate, this is THE Friday,” he insisted with far too much confidence, pulling up his sleeves. The left one immediately slipped back down, but he was too busy picking a shirt for Harry from a pile of dirty clothes to notice.
Soggy amber leaves squelched beneath his black loafers. It felt good to be wearing real shoes again; he’d ditched the dirty lace ups that got him through the first few months after the war, that miserable chase for employment, for purpose, for someone to love him because he couldn’t love himself. Now that he was back on his feet, just thinking about it made him cringe. He was sick of the pitiful angst that had clung to him since sixth year, sick of feeling sorry for himself. Bit by bit, Draco was rebuilding his pride, and this time it wasn’t at the expense of his peers but rather fueled by the cleanliness of his flat, the sharpness of his style, and the smiles of customers satisfied with a job well done.
“Yeah, sorry, he’s just, yeah.” Relationship? Harry barely had time to address that thought before he was in the hallway and Malfoy was saying something.
The man who was not quite Harry swung his leg and then Draco was on his back. Not-quite-Harry leaned over him, breath hot. He tugged off Draco’s shirt. His fingers traced sharp ribs, but he made no comment.
Unless... that crunchy nugget. It was supposed to make him fall in love. No wonder he was in this mess! He would never in his right mind get a milkshake with Malfoy, or have any concern for how he was doing, or want to tell him things he’d never told anyone else. He didn’t really care about Malfoy.
“That’s exactly the problem, she might say yes. And that’s a problem because she’s weird. She’d be obsessive and clingy and really, the more I think about it, that’s a terrible path to go down.”
“You know I have to work,” said Draco, slipping inside and throwing a look over his shoulder at Kumara. “You better not distract me with your chatter.”
with Draco Malfoy?” admitting to the toxicity between them: “You mean the one where we were at one another's throats on and off the pitch?” He shakes his head and looks away, the burden of forbidden lust clearly taking a toll on him. “I want to bury the hatchet,” he assures me, but he doesn’t specify
“It’s a weapon,” Draco said coolly, trying to swallow his panic. When the glass shattered, he was reminded of the permanence of death, and he couldn’t pretend anymore that this was merely a piece of metal.
He glanced at Kumara one last time, tall and slim and soft, and they locked eyes. Expressions flitted across the stranger’s face and his mouth moved to form words.
The redhead squinted his eyes. “Alright. Well you just let me know if I need to beat that bloody idiot up for you. Self-righteous walnut thinks he can go around stirring up trouble and making other people clean up after him.”
Harry crushed the cup in his hand, tossed it in the recycle, and stood. The café was empty save for some scruffy black haired man in the corner and a couple of girls running lines for what must be a school play. The hum of machines behind the counter blended with the soft tapping of rain outside, and leaves blew past the windows.
Today, however, a calm settled between them. Perhaps their walk through the grounds, their conversation through dinner and dusk and into dark, had been cathartic.
RITA: [ he's too good at this. she moves onto the next question, hoping for better luck with this one. ] Do you plan to rekindle your relationship with Draco Malfoy?
Harry had forgotten how toned this bloke was. His mind flitted back to just a couple nights ago; undoing the buttons of his shirt, taking it off... The shirt he was wearing now had buttons. Harry wondered if they were as hard to undo as those other ones.
What got Harry was page two. Sometime in the last year, the pale-eyed punk had moved to Bath, England, and if that wasn’t quaint enough, he worked at a
Harry shrugged, relaxing further into his chair. “Apparently nothing can. It’s been tried and tested.”
Good lord. It’s been 2.5 years and looking back on this is... it’s somethin’. I want a sense of resolution, ya feel? But be warned, for this fic is a conglomeration of cliches and I shan’t break that pattern now. This final chapter is gonna verge into parody territory.
“Did you hear his voice?” she started as soon as the waiter left. “He sounded like, really depressed. I guess some people just choose to see the negative aspects of life. Kinda pathetic, honestly.” Harry wasn’t sure how to respond, but the conversation topic breezed on toward music.
Ron’s face contorted in disgust as he plucked his wand from the sopping heap. “Hermione would have had this solved a while ago,” he murmured defeatedly.
“I’m so sorry ma’am, complete accident,” Harry’s head snapped up to see Malfoy standing there with an empty glass. “I just feel so secure with the capable staff this place has that sometimes I get careless.”
“Yeah,” breathed the stranger, eyes crinkling with a smile. He leaned down and pressed his lips to Draco’s neck.
A wrapper of some sort blew across the street in front of them, reflecting the many colors of the sky as pink and lavender clouds tumbled toward dusk. Music echoed fuzzily from a shop down the road. Harry’s right side was very warm and cozy.
He slid it to the side, grabbing a neglected stack of papers and feeling like a complete fool. He flipped through them for a couple seconds before his eyes landed on a sticky note with handwriting much nicer than his.
But somehow, lying here in a stranger’s bed, thinking about Harry Potter, Draco got a glimpse of what it might be to be
Turning to Malfoy, he said “Thanks to you, both of us need showers. There’s no chance I’m letting you on my furniture like that.”
Nausea seized Draco at the mere thought of food. He preferred to avoid it. But when he crept into the dark kitchen to decline, Kumara already had a spatula pointed at him and a question on his lips.
“They are a family of three,” Dumbledore told the crowd as the two men continued to argue. “I am just one person. It is a simple matter of mathematics.”
Harry wasn’t aware that his own expression mimicked Al’s rather closely, if not in an identical manner.
“So you can learn to be a mind reader?” Harry asked, hoping that he was following the conversation correctly.
Percy rounded another corner, finding himself in the place where he had needed to go, the Albus ward. It was not so much a ward as it was but a rather open, large room with only two patients. The two men lay in beds far away from one another, surrounded by curious machines and separated from the world by a divider, as well as from one another with yet another divider.
“They’ve been on the floor…?” Pettigrew squealed as he attempted to not look at the Lycan’s face out of fear that he would challenge him.
Albus opened his mouth, then slowly shut it again. He glanced to the side, then down at the bottle around his neck, filled with what he has presented as his own blood. “El is… well…” he stuttered, “El is a nickname.”
Over the noise of the Aurors’ moving and speaking to one another, Harry could hear Mr. Malfoy beg them to help his son. His pleading was heard by Albus, who turned away from the people attempting to apprehend him and simply walked over to the Death Eater and his son, ignoring the commands for him to remain where he was.
His hands move up to my hair, pulling it away from my face so that he can see me properly. I objected to the action quite a number of times in the past, but I no longer hate my face in the same manner as I used to. How can I hate what El claims to love so dearly? El gazes deeply into my eyes, but I can tell that he has something upon his mind.
Lucius' scheme succeeded without fail, Arthur came to resent him with all his heart, and he constructed ways to get back at the other, which became the core of their long feud through the years.
With a deep sigh, Sirius accepted it, but he kept it an arm’s length away from himself. “Thanks, fine. I will.” He hesitated, chewing on his lower lip before speaking up. “It wasn’t in my room, right? I don’t want you going in there, it… uh, well, there is some stuff in there you don’t need to see.” Sirius didn’t know what would be worse: James seeing his teenage self’s soft pornography, or the far more innocent son of Remus’ seeing his teenage self’s soft pornography.
Draco didn’t respond verbally, but he reached out and hugged Harry closer to his chest, pressing Harry’s head closer to his neck. Harry couldn’t hold back the urge to kiss him, upon which Draco allowed a small, pleased moan to leave him. Harry was reminded of the feelings Al had felt when El asked him about ‘the things I want to do with you, which might frighten you.’ He realised with some shame and some excitement that his own feelings were very similar to Al’s, and he recognised that he would trust Draco with his own body in such an act. In fact, he wanted to know Draco’s body more, he wanted to know it more intimately than anyone else would, but Harry was also aware that they were in a hospital bed, and that Draco was hurt. Also, the idea of doing something like that when they were not entirely sure where the had the other was enough to make Harry feel outright stupid for his desires.
George let his hand drop into his lap. “That does sound rather nice. If you don’t mind spending time around me like this. I don’t really have the energy to pretend that I’m not rather messed up for the moment.” He didn't feel like he knew the person who was speaking the words, despite them being his own. Honesty was unfamiliar to him.
Other people couldn’t love like her and Arthur. Other people’s love was not as pure as hers, not as true as hers. They were perfect together, and perfect they had to stay. All the struggles came from the fact that she was failing him and her family in not being happy enough. She was not the mother, the woman, she was supposed to be.
“Or he is actually further in.” Colin objected as he peered into the dark room, raising his wand higher to try and see more of what was behind the door. “It’s some sort of receptionist area, and I see a lot of doors beyond that. I think one of them is open.” He leaned back again and looked to the rest of the group.
“Actually, Sirius,” Harry interrupted Draco before he could answer. “I was hoping that you wouldn’t mind talking to one of our friends, he does in fact idolise you.”
Al threw a glance out the window and then surrendered to the idea of facing the same snow storm which had exhausted the much younger and far sturdier Molly Weasley. He took a few deep breaths before he nodded to the witch and followed Hagrid out the doors. The two of them parted as Hagrid headed towards the Defense against the Dark Arts Professor’s room and Al approached the main doors of Hogwarts.
“Welcome, good day to you.” Remus smiled at the pale face which appeared over the railing. “I have my hands full with cleaning over here, I hope you don’t mind me greeting you properly a little later?”
Percy groaned and hid his face against his hands, wishing that he could squeeze hatred out of his mind and do something productive with it. Like hating… Which generally couldn’t be considered productive. He sighed deeply.
The Dark Lord had been troubled by nightmares since his resurrection, with many of them centering around the resurrection itself. He dreamt of pain and of suffering, then he would wake up to the effects of the ritual, and found many times over that he no longer possessed the ability to cry.
“Your punishment is… snake.” Harry lowered his voice, doing his best impression of what he hoped was somebody commanding and respectable, before he flopped back onto Draco, pretending to slither over him by means of wriggling about.
The Death Eaters followed Rodolphus inside, entering into the department as they headed down a tunnel which brought them to an amphitheater made out of stone, with a terrifyingly alluring vortex within an arch covered in ancient writing. Malfoy was at the other end of it, arguing with both his son and Bellatrix. Without hesitation, Rabastan’s husband led them closer to the group of teenagers who were standing half inside and half outside a room with a black door. It appeared that the group had been cornered there by Malfoy.
Harry blinked at him, completely lost as to why he would ask such a bizarre question out of the blue. “No, just two dogs.”
The blonde woman was standing in her entrance hall, waiting for the three of them to come inside. Andromeda got the impression that she had been standing there for hours, immobile as she awaited the prey to step inside her den so that she may eat, uh, welcome them.
“Lunch sounds excellent.” Harry reached out to take Draco’s hand and together, the two of them left the Chamber of Secrets and the tunnels, and headed for the Great Hall.
After some hesitation, Professor Snape slowly parted his lips and allowed his words to no longer be trapped, “I have argued with myself over why I chose that path in life as well. In the beginning, I believe it was for protection. From James Potter, from Sirius Black, from everyone in Gryffindor, from everyone in general, from loneliness or outsidership…” His voice trailed off as he stared into the unlit fireplace, perhaps seeing fire which wasn’t there in his mind’s eyes. His fingers had moved up to the necklace which he had received from his lover during the previous winter holidays, and was absently playing with the full moon ornament.
Harry had been right in confiding in the adults he trusted. He only wished that his dad had been there as well, as that would have been comforting to him, personally.
Since Draco had apparently decided to keep the unicorn teacup of his own, Harry saw to cleaning it, and started making new tea.
“No way.” Teddy laughed, raising his hands up to wave the suggestion away. “To join the Disciplinary Committee, you have to at least be disciplinary, right? Well, that sure ain’t me.”
Sirius had never known that Rabastan was a Death Eater until the man had been sent to Azkaban. Although he had calmed down by now, Sirius had never forgiven Rabastan for making him the lover of a Death Eater. Rabastan may not have had the mark, yet that made the betrayal all the more bitter, seeing as he had hid his allegiance from Sirius while reaping the benefits of a body which he would never have gotten to touch if Sirius had known.
Both father and son Weasley were surprised to learn that the other enjoyed the same music. It surprisingly gave them something to talk about for the first time in almost ten years. It was pleasant to speak with Bill, if only for a few minutes at the time. Arthur could not help but feel appreciative for the opportunity to converse with him for more than singular, rehearsed sentences about work and life. They might not know each other any better by the end of the day, but at least both of them felt relaxed about the conversation, which was a new experience for both of them. It was at least evidence that they could, maybe, get to know one another.
Hagrid snorted through his nose, “because he’s known to tell the truth always. They are just spooky stories to get you teenagers and kids to stay in bed. He doesn’t actually want to do that to you.”
The door to the Department of Mysteries was open. It had not been broken open, neither had it been blown to bits and lay shattered in pieces. It was simply open, wide open, allowing anyone to enter. The very first step had already gone wrong, which meant that the plan as it was might already be lost.
“The mage community likes to pretend that we are removed from other communities, or that Muggle history and desires do not affect us, but this is not true. During the 18th and 19th century many mages immigrated to America based on the promise of fleeing the Pureblood ruled society which bound them to their blood. In America, they sought to find a new life which would appreciate them for their abilities and not their blood. The promise of freedom applied to these mages as well, not only the Muggles. Yet assimilation can often be complex, and many mages found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of power in the society which they had hoped to shape, especially since the establishing of an American Ministry of Magic has long since proved almost impossible. Instead, they have been forced to create smaller embassies around the states, with no true central power to rule or support all mages of America, the continent is simply that vast.”
