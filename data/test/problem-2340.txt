and they share a small smile.
Now that he knew about his parents anniversary, he wanted to do something about it. What kind of son would he be to ignore such an important date? His parents who probably married in secret because of the First War; who deserved to have their marriage remembered.
There is no hesitation when Draco grasps Harry’s outstretched hand. With effort, the two manage to sit Draco behind Harry. Draco, fearing this will be the last time he has the change to sit so close to Harry, leans forward and tucks his face between Harry’s shoulder blades. His hands naturally wrap around Harry’s waist.
They continued to stare at each other in silence.
- to be the centre of attention
“The boy who lived came to die!” He taunts, growing tall when he hears his followers cackle and jeer.
Harry finally looked at Draco and watched in anticipation to see what he would do next. His hearing became muffled as Draco touched the Arrow for hopefully the final time.
He turned to the page and settled into his bed, kicking off his shoes along the way. He started to read aloud, “Auras are a beautiful thing to see. They’re wondrous and few are blessed to witness them. Those gifted with the sight, however, will be filled with the burden of all the colours until they figure out ways to make it disappear. Some have attempted so via acting as Panders, others have chosen the complete opposite and chose to hide the gift and become hermits. —”
! He hated how weak he must have seemed, a lovestruck idiot that people would mock him for years to come. Merlin, he’d never hear the end of it!
They remain in their position for who knows how long. But it appears to be long enough since Draco starts to hear voices near the end of the corridor. He pulls away and leans his forehead against Harry’s.
In his child mind, that small sum of £1.60 could take him somewhere far! He supposed it would take him to Nottingham, where he could meet Robin Hood and his Merry Men! He could— he could…
“If you want to find out, wait for later. Otherwise, I’m going to ignore you.” Draco replied, beckoning more of his Slytherin brethren to come over. It was getting awfully crowded with Gryffindors.
Harry bit his lip and nodded. He let Draco sit down first before he fished out the book. Holding it made what he was about to say seem real all of a sudden. Frankly, he was terrified.
He nods to himself and makes a move to start cleaning.
“I’m never one to back down from a challenge, Mr Malfoy,” Cally replied.
Harry made sure they were alone for that, he hated to think about how much teasing he would have got for it.
There it is again,
“Now Draco, if there’s anything I know about your mother, it’s that she will never hate you. No matter what ridiculous things you’ll do.” Harry poked Draco’s arm, trying to lighten the situation.
Harry talked to Flitwick and Madame Pomfrey. They both agreed with him when he suggested they hold off the from next session. Draco was still adjusting to feeling emotions of sadness and fear, that he was less likely to handle another negative one. Draco knew this of course and appreciated Harry’s thoughtfulness.
Harry nodded, “great. That’s great.”
“It’s so peculiar to see how you two interact. If I didn’t know it was really you two, I’d think it was Polyjuice or something!” Hermione says, turning to Ron wanting him to agree with her. Which he does, nodding slowly. He is still kind of uncomfortable with their relationship, but Harry is clearly happy. Adding to the fact that he’s finally going to find out why they became so close, he thinks he can come around to the idea.
’ He walked over to his counter and placed some bread into his toaster.
In the spirit of Christmas and goodwill, Draco Malfoy thought it would be a good idea to start making amends before the winter break. He’s already successfully apologised to the majority of the returning eighth years. There’s only four left who he has to apologise to, and he’s left them for the end for a reason. Courage. Or rather, the lack of it. The final four he has to apologise to are the people who were tormented by him the most. He was frightened of not being forgiven. Rather, he’s expecting to be spat at, probably hexed beyond any form of recognition.

Potter looked down at his hand, “oh this? It’s an earbud. It plays music. I normally play my music quite loud when I eat in the Great Hall. The noise is just too much sometimes. I probably forgot to lower it down.”
“I don’t think so.”
Draco drank from his goblet, using it as a cover to observe the table from across the room. It had been three days since his apology to Weasley and Granger. He was surprised by Granger’s maturity in the situation. He had expected to be hexed beyond recognition. Instead, she left him with a warning. When Weasley had walked a few steps away from them, upon her signal, she tugged his collar down to her level so she could whisper words into his ear. He hated how he had flinched when her hand rushed near his face. He never did get over how she injured him in such barbaric Muggle ways.
Potter looked up and stared at Draco; his hands still twisting the different sides of the cube. Draco was unsure what the goal was, but it seemed so mundane and pointless. He supposed it didn’t require a lot of attentiveness if Potter could solve it without looking at it.
Harry nodded slowly, “translating charm? What, like a bracelet charm? Also,
“I cannot be sure,” he says, wishing he could run to his mother’s side. Instead, he calmly stands up and walks as far away as he can from Harry's side. He doesn't miss the slight way Harry's shoulders relax once he finds out that Draco won't give them away.
Harry leaned into Ron’s arm, “I guess… Did you at least attempt to hurt the git?”
, but who's really counting?) were very friendly with him. Harry didn’t realise how good of a friendship it was until he saw a text from one of them.
- occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way
“Is there anyone special who will get those?” Malfoy asked his mouth right by Harry’s neck. So close that he could feel Malfoy’s breath.
Draco noticed Harry’s shadow and looked up, raising an eyebrow in question. He came in early to practice for his own speaking test, and from the way Harry was staring at him, he could only guess what this was going to be about.
Draco’s grip tightened, “I think fear?” At this Draco’s breathing increased slightly, “right now I hate how dark it is in this room. Can we go outside? Please?” Toward the end, Draco’s voice raised in pitch, his fear of being in the dark suddenly coming back to him. “I don’t like not knowing what’s hidden in the corner. Harry!” He pulled Harry to a stand, tugging the front of his shirt, “let’s go. Now. Please!” His eyes were wide, tinted in pink still.
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, probably wondering why he was suddenly interested in his friends. Harry hadn’t paid attention to them before, in fact, right now he was looking at both of them. They were seated by the fire, talking with the other Slytherins.
—————
They watched in anticipation as Draco paused in his ministrations. He leaned closer to Harry’s face and whispered something. His thumb brushed against Harry’s cheek and showed him what he had found. She guessed it was probably an eyelash. Pansy held in her gasp when their eyes met. She kicked Hermione under the table in excitement. This was it! She saw their faces light up with an epiphany of how they truly felt. Draco leaned down further and pressed a tentative kiss against Harry’s cheek.
“Is this–”
“Harry?”
“Why Harry will be tutoring you, Mr Malfoy.”
“Get your wand out–”
He tilted his head back on the sofa and groaned in frustration. It’s been a week of this and he was already
He was done with this.
Like a meerkat, Draco sat up and stared around, finally noting that they weren’t alone. He groaned in embarrassment, his cheeks and ears turning a delightfully bright Gryffindor red.
Harry leaned closer, until his face was almost a breath away, “I was conflicted about you.”
“I—…” He looks back at Malfoy— Draco as if asking for guidance. Draco is no help at all, he’s just as frozen. “Well, this is quite a long story. However…  Shortened…? Draco and I—” he bites his lip, lost at what he should say. It has been so long since they last talked… Touched… What exactly were they?
Harry was eleven when he found a new shiny thing to keep.
Harry rolls his eyes and ignores Ron in favour of watching the pink grow on Draco’s cheeks. He is a very pale-faced man and doesn’t blush very easily. Or he likes to think. Harry takes pleasure in being one of the few who have seen Draco blush bright red and being the cause of it.
It wouldn’t be right to offend his best friends.
“Okay,” Harry agreed easily, “would thee be kind to giveth more?”
to the group chat. After some thought, he also added
“We’re together.” Draco finishes.
“Did you have something you wanted to tell me?”
“HARRY!”
greeting Harry, he speaks again. “I did you a great disservice in one of your past lives. Your soul was unable to rest and remained on the mortal plane for aeons before I got my chance.”
from an angry aunt.
Well, he was here now. It was late in the evening, yet the summer sun refused to go down. He hoped the breeze wouldn’t be strong enough to lift his overgrown fringe. He’d hate for his Golden Boy reputation to ruin this visit.
“But she’s Muggle?”
Blaise’s smirk was deadly, “Draco darling, I dare
On the Thursday of their week off from Hogwarts, he was called into one of the manor’s many sitting rooms. The room was heavy with anticipation and iron – a scent which he hated so much recently.
The dares continued in that fashion. When it was to the glee of a pink-faced Seamus that he dared Harry to kiss Draco ‘
Perfectly cautioned, Draco nodded quickly. He stumbled slightly as she shoved him back. He kept his eyes to the ground as she rushed to Weasley’s side. It took him a few minutes to compose himself before he too returned into the castle.
Not even two weeks in and Harry was getting overwhelmed. Everyone was
“I talked to Flitwick.”
He recovers and heals, slowly.
and wants nothing more than to comfort him in return, to soothe him of his guilt.
Draco hummed acquiesce, “fair point. But don’t think I haven’t noticed what you’ve been up to Potter.”
Draco’s head spun to look at Harry, who already had his gaze fixed on him, “what could have possibly caused you conflict?”
The rest, as they say, is history.
He thinks.
“Oh Potter, everything is wrong. I doubt there’s anything right with me.”
He groaned and took his glasses off so he could rub his eyes. That was it, he was going to fail this. There went over thirty per cent of his grade. He leaned back against the comfortable sofa, contemplating why he decided to take French. It wasn’t exactly necessary for his university course. He just enjoyed learning the language. Keyword: learning. Being tested for it was a hurdle he really didn’t want to have to go through.
Well, there’s a mood killer if Draco ever needed one.
He didn’t stop at feeding Harry, sometimes he would follow Harry, forgetting his class schedule until Harry promised to stay where he was and wait for Malfoy to come back. The biggest request Malfoy made was for Harry to call him Draco,
Harry would sit down in the great hall, and a second later would be engulfed in the blond’s hug. He would find himself being fed by Malfoy, to the amusement of everyone in the vicinity, and as much as he hated it, he accepted every mouthful. The grin that would appear on Malfoy's face definitely wasn’t the reason for it. It wasn’t.
Mikey whistled and then pinched his lips together as if he had sucked the lemons in the bowl before him, “well that’s shite. I hope they don’t fight. God knows I’d hate to get in between them if they act homophobic.”
“It’s not even that bad, there was that time in the greenhouse–”
, and now they were using it to play him! On the one hand, he was able to touch Harry in ways he never expected to and it’s not like people could put it against him. But at the same time, he and Harry were just starting to be friends, surely he shouldn’t ruin it. Then he remembered Harry’s loophole and smirked.
He waited for the common room to clear up a bit. During which the sun had set, and, together with the warm fire, a rutilant haze trailed throughout the room. There were only two other people aside from Potter sitting around. They seemed to be preoccupied, and this was probably the only time Draco could corner Potter alone.
Hermione grinned and let herself enjoy the sight. No doubt she’d have to reveal more information to Harry, but she left off it. Letting them enjoy their new relationship.
- attempting to win favour by flattery
. Winked! Again!
Adoration for the man before him skyrocketed. Harry wasn’t very vocal about saying how much he loved Draco. Draco assumed it was a result of never hearing it often enough growing up. He hadn’t either, but at least he had a mother who doted on him constantly, so it was easier for him to express his love for Harry. He felt Harry tense, so he waited for him to gather his courage and words.
“Is this some kind of joke to you?” he asked.
Mikey was back from break and wiping down the counter. He took the paper Mark held out for him and set to make the drinks.
“Did you
“You shut your dirty pie-hole Potter!”
“Sirius kinda was the reason why I decided to give you a chance you know?” Harry ends his rant. “He was the lost sheep in his family, someone against everything his family fought for. He truly is the bravest man I can think of. I wanted to give you the choice he should have had.”
There were some serious times when the two were left alone and Malfoy’s head would rest on Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he said once to the empty common room. Harry flinched and looked down at Malfoy, “I forgive you” he replied.
Harry quickly intervenes, “now wait a second. He knew and probably knew what was happening with your family. Rather than force you to stop and hurt your–”
“If I am Achilles, then that leads for me to assume that Patroclus is living somewhere right?” Harry considers, crossing his arms together.
Harry guffaws into Draco’s shoulder, unable to stop himself at her expression of bewilderment. It isn’t often he can surprise her, “yes I did. Or tried to! He kept insisting my ideas were unnecessary!”
Harry turns his stirring rod clockwise three more times before consulting the textbook by his side. The next steps were to let it simmer for three more minutes before letting it cool and adding in the bitter root to stabilise the bubbling that would surely appear. He pointedly ignores Hermione’s huffs and takes a seat, relaxing while his classmates are several steps behind him.
“Well, it’s just some things you talk about as a couple…” Ron’s ears were turning a bright red, and if he was brave enough to face Harry, he’d know for sure the rest of his face matched his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Deciding to ignore her cryptic words, he started to pack away his work. He had noticed halfway during their conversation that the class was starting to empty. And he had a book to get to, which would probably give him all his answers.
Harry, frustrated that he was suddenly being ignored, pulled Draco up and forced him to face him.
. Best mate or not, you will be dead to me if you finish that sentence.” Ron points at Harry who smirks at Ron.
“Shh, just walk with me.”
Three years had passed and Harry finally managed to clear the third floor of Grimmauld Place. It had been renovated to house two extra people, one Teddy Lupin and one Andromeda Tonks. Harry offered his home to them, once he deemed it safe enough. In Teddy’s room was Remus’ box. Harry and Teddy would spend nights reading the letters out loud, sharing their parent’s stories. Harry had given him the flying key which Teddy proudly hung from his ceiling.
But death is a friend of Harry’s.
The position is similar to how they sat sharing a horse during the rare times they were able to catch a break in the
Draco checked both directions, making sure no one wasn’t coming any time soon and made his way over. The closer he got to Potter, the quicker his heart went. It was just anxiety, it had nothing to do with how relaxed Potter looked.
Harry continued, “is there anything else? What else are you feeling besides guilt and sadness?”
—————
Green, green, green.
Draco wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings; he was too busy explaining why rose water was overpriced for such a common ingredient that he didn’t notice the upturned stone (
Harry’s mind is reeling everywhere, but he can’t let Draco know. Draco who eased out of it like it was nothing.
Draco kissed Harry’s lips to stop him from wasting time, “shut up.” He could feel Harry’s smile again, enjoying it turn into a frown as he pulled away. “and don’t think I didn’t know what you were doing. You closet-Slytherin.”
“Well done in today’s brewing session. I am pleased with plenty of your successful results. Now, it is nearing your free study time, so if you may, pour your potions into the vials and clean out your cauldrons. I am expecting an essay of two feet about the antidote you have been making. Those who have not finished, please also decant it into a vial and label it as yours. I will be seeing you all shortly soon.”
Draco’s grip on Potter’s shoulder loosened, “you did?” He voiced, silent and meek.
“What are you–”
l think I'll expand on this prompt and make it a fic. There's potential to make this one grow... hmm... Anyways, thanks so much to those who have subscribed and given kudos to this story! I truly appreciate each and every one of you!!
Malfoy takes a seat at the newly cleaned area and looks around the mess hall. Plenty of the ministry employees are on their lunch break with them. He appears to not appreciate this as he casts the all-time favourite Muffliato.
Harry tilted his head and stared at the glass. His gut feeling told him to trust the other man, and he always relied on his instincts. They were very good – most of the time. He picked up the glass and took a careful sip. Upon discovering it was only water, he finished half the glass. He wiped the excess water off his lips and smiled at the other man.
Harry knew he didn’t have to repeat himself as he saw Draco’s grin grow. An expression that was rare on his face since the previous arrow session. Sure he smiled every now and again, but that huge grin on display? Harry was glad to have witnessed it again.
Draco hesitated briefly before leaning back into him (
Ron coughs, uncomfortable all of a sudden, “despite what you may assume… you’ve made Harry the happiest I’ve ever seen him. I thought he was happy with Ginny, but that was merely puppy love. What he has with you– I can’t believe I’m saying it– what you have together? That’s true love that is. You don’t get that in every lifetime.”
“You said you couldn’t even say it! You’re disgusted by the thought of being tied to me! I don’t get why you wanted me to know. I would’ve been blind to everything, carried on with life just fine! But no! You couldn’t let me live in ignorance, could you? —” Harry had started to laugh in relief, “—what are you laughing at you berk? I should’ve known it was too good to be true that you and I could be friends. Well, at least now I know!” Harry made a move to grab Draco’s hand again, but he flinched away, “you don’t get to touch me!”
“Do you not like me?” Draco asked, his hand coming up to play with the hair on Harry’s arm.
It was a photograph of his parents slow dancing in what he could only guess was his parents’ wedding reception. Near the end of the loop, Sirius’ smirking face jumped in the corner ruining what would have been a sweet shot. Harry couldn’t have been happier, it was such a Sirius thing to do. He pulled out more photographs and saw more snippets of their wedding. Harry leaned against the bed and stared fixated at his parents’ happy smiles.
He noticed the man beside him. He was slowly sipping a clear liquid. His bright crystal-like eyes watched the whole room with precision Harry didn’t think he could ever accomplish in his current state. The man was dressed very casually. He wore a tight cream turtleneck under a dark denim jacket. The jacket had multiple pins on the collar. One was a badge saying ‘Potter stinks’. The words brought a sour memory to his mind, but he couldn’t figure out why. He picked the coaster off his cheek and sat up with a sigh.
“Do you think I’m ready for the next session? What more can I feel? I think I’m pretty well rounded now, anything more and I’ll probably be worse. I like how I am now Harry, can we just stop at this?”
His sigh drew the other man’s attention to him. He raised his eyebrow at Harry and took a longer sip.
Later in the evening, Harry and Draco were lying down in Harry’s bed. Draco’s hand was carefully untangling Harry’s curls. Harry had long ago given up telling him how futile the task was. By the time he would turn over, more tangles would appear. He suspected Draco secretly loved them and couldn’t get enough from touching his hair. Of course, in the time they’d been together, he hadn’t said anything. Draco being Draco would only stop doing it, and Harry loved the feeling too much to lose it.
Sent 12:10
He bit his lip and searched the common room, looking for anyone who could be a worthy replacement. It was too early in the morning, so only a few people had arrived. Some were looking frantically through their notes, revising for the morning exams. Harry considered himself lucky that his speaking test would take place in the afternoon.
Malfoy tugged Harry to him, wrapping an arm around his shoulder and started to rub his cheek against Harry’s, “that’s fine with me.”
He sits up and breathes in deeply. The air is pure and warm. Something settles in Harry and he feels safe, at home.
“Enough! I’ve heard enough!” he cries, blocking his ears.
Upon the Golden Trio’s escape, he, once more, sacrifices his body. He suffers
He looks around the Great Hall, his lips pursed. Hermione copies him and gasps upon finding him. Alerted by Hermione, Harry follows the direction she is looking towards and finds himself struggling to keep his smile in. There Malfoy is, sitting on the Slytherin table. Ron isn’t surprised Harry hadn’t recognised him earlier, the soot from the Fiendfyre had darkened his previously noticeable bright hair. He has his knees drawn up, head in his hands. His shoulders shaking, obvious to anyone watching that he is crying. Ron is about to ask Harry what he’s going to do next, but before he can Harry breaks into a run to Malfoy. Without any hesitation, Harry is kneeling before Malfoy, talking gently. He comforts Malfoy, patting his shoulder. When Malfoy looks up at Harry, Ron is shocked to see Malfoy start hitting Harry’s chest with his closed fist. Harry doesn’t fight back at all, instead, he keeps trying to pull Malfoy towards him.
which would only result in him catapulting himself onto Harry. Harry had no choice but to hug him as a way of steadying them, instead of collapsing under his weight. Those who witnessed this took great pleasure in Harry’s discomfort and Malfoy’s laughter.
“How come you don’t have a sobriquet for me?” Harry suddenly asked, his voice quiet, so as to not disturb the peace settling around them.
“Well,” Draco drawled, bringing their hands up and tracing the back of Harry’s knuckles against his lips, “there’s no stopping us now, is there?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry cups Draco’s jaw and tentatively opens his mouth, welcoming in
). He tripped gracelessly (
one day revisit this plot and expand on it further, but we'll see ;)
the trio – made their way to the front when they heard whispering behind them.
I do enjoy the thought of everyone telling Harry "no", only for him to reply "Harry yes" ^^;
Nothing brings Harry more joy than to nod slightly and agree.
“Shut up you git, c’mon follow me.”
Harry had stopped tying his shoes and instead slipped to sit down on the ground, leaning against the leg of his bed. He took a look at his walkman, wondering if he was hearing things that he wasn’t supposed to. He returned his attention to Ron who continued to look as if he had been confunded.
“Mate, this is so weird. It’s like whiplash– that’s the right word right, Herms? Yeah. That. I feel so blindsided. I didn’t even know you were talking to Malfoy…”
“He loves me, he loves me not,” he started, pulling the petals off one by one.
He only cancelled the charm once he saw the game resuming, implying that Hermione had answered the question. He refused to look Hermione in the eye as he paid attention to Dean who picked up the bottle to spin it. And so the game proceeded.
Harry gave him a grateful smile and opened the book. Not once letting go of Draco’s wrist. He didn’t seem to mind, choosing instead to take hold of the book while Harry turned to the page he wanted them to read.
Naturally, Malfoy would lose his marbles and speak poems into Harry’s ear. Words so pure and loving that it would leave Harry blushing. Once, Malfoy attempted to be seductive, but Harry put an end to that immediately.
. Touch was something Harry realised he wasn’t accustomed to, despite the many years of friendship with hug-happy Ron. Harry learned how much he wanted to be touched because of Draco’s tactile nature. He recalled watching Draco act dramatically and lean against Blaise and Pansy during the past. How he was not afraid to wrap an arm around Theodore’s shoulder and lead him around. Even Greg and Vince received hugs from Draco now and again.
“How long have Harry and I been together?”
He hummed when Draco returned the hug and tightened his grip.
to kiss Harry.” He turned to Pansy who had started laughing and added, “and not the same place!”
Harry carries on talking about the different properties of wood, oblivious to the fact that Draco has faded away into his thoughts.
“Now that’s a proper kiss,” Draco announced when he pulled away.
Draco pouted, “you don’t trust me?”
Draco already knew the way to Harry’s room, so he merely took Harry’s hand and rushed them down the corridor. Harry’s exhilarated laughter filling the empty space the whole time.
“You should’ve seen his face, Mione. It’s like I shattered his heart into millions of pieces. I hated that I was the one to do that to him.” His face on the table, hidden from view by his arms. He wasn’t surprised when Hermione asked him to repeat what he said. He straightened and repeated what he said, albeit quieter since now people would be able to hear him.
“And what exactly is
Ron stares, perplexed. What is Malfoy’s problem then?
Harry searches Draco’s eyes as if to ask him,
) Harry looked over Draco’s shoulder and watched as he picked out small socks with snitches flying around it.
. “Kiss me,” Draco whispers, lips brushing against Harry’s.
“So, what’s stopping you?”
Flitwick nodded, understanding where Harry was coming from, “perhaps I may be of assistance?”
“Then… who are you?” Harry asks, finally finding his voice.
Harry snapped his fingers, “Soleil!” He looked at Draco and inspected him. Watching as he evaded Harry’s eyes. “...You called me...
Malfoy nodded, “something you tend to do a lot of, I presume?”
. First of all, I’m very kind and keep to myself. I know how to be respectful to my elders – within reason – and can follow rules. Also within reason. Thirdly, –”
On Harry’s turn to kiss Draco, he took inspiration from earlier and held Draco’s jaw with his right hand. He turned Draco’s face to the side and before leaning in, inhaled his scent. Draco’s cologne had faded as the party progressed so all Harry could smell was
He stood up and followed Draco to his kitchen. Harry smiled to himself, he found joy in being able to navigate his way around Draco’s home. That it was familiar to him. He found Draco opening his cupboard to retrieve the salt. Throwing caution to the wind, he stopped behind Draco and leaned his chin on his shoulder.
“Could be.”
Harry was still staring at him.
Harry cursed and reached to pull Malfoy’s arm away from the gold bar that was the arrow’s shaft. He tugged and tugged, but Malfoy’s grip was steady. Harry could hear a collective intake from his classmates.
, he thought. He was about to turn in the direction Pansy gave when his sleeve was pulled.
—————
“Now, I doubt that, Harry.” Hermione shoved Ron’s legs away, but his whines of protest ended when she put them on her lap.
Harry looked at him, “what for?”
Draco hesitated, “I have one more person to apologise to. And you’re touched if you think I’ll somehow stop insulting you. I won’t be cruel about it, but you just make it so easy sometimes Potter. I’d end up combusting if I held back some comments sometimes.”
“I have a proposition for you two. I understand that there is animosity between the two houses. Always has been, I assume since Hogwarts’ creation. However, I think you two could gain a huge benefit from this.”
Arms wrapped around him and a kiss was placed gently on his jaw from behind. He leaned into Harry’s chest with a pleased hum. To have this every day forever made him wonder what good he did in his past life to deserve this.
Draco looked down at their hands, “you didn’t act as if you liked me when I was basically draping myself all over you. What was I supposed to think? I thought you were annoyed with me; wanted nothing to do with me. I thought you wanted to get rid of me. To finally be free–”
Malfoy nods, humming to himself.
“And you ma’am’,” he replies.
Draco tried
“I can hear people. How do you want to play this?”
“You little fuck–”
Harry pushed Draco’s shoulder, a smile starting to grow on his face, “prat.”
He cast a spell to remove all the dust in the room and smiled when he found it easier to breathe. He walked over to the dresser and traced his fingers against the grain. He could imagine Remus staring into the mirror, much like he was doing then. What thoughts went through Remus’ head when he stayed here? Did he hope to win, or was he preparing for the worst? With a sigh, Harry bent down and opened some of the drawers.
Harry rolled his eyes, “no you plonker. You’re both glowing.”
“Shove off,” he elbowed Ron’s side taking pleasure in hearing him almost topple over his stool.
Harry straightened up and looked to Flitwick, he ignored the knowing smile on Pansy’s face and the rush of heat in his cheeks. It was
-  hide under a false appearance.
Harry returns to the present and notices Draco’s concerned stare.
“Right, let’s focus on these different types of roots and bark that we add to potions. I had no idea that based on the age of the root or bark, it could affect the potion. Did you know that adding a younger bark could make the potion last longer? It can also refresh some of the other ingredients inside the cauldron. Oh! But in turn, if you want to make a potion mature faster, adding in an older root makes reduces the wait time!”
Only, Harry can’t think about the benefits. He berates himself for the thought. He hates how eager his to hear Draco’s secrets during their sessions when it’s obvious that Draco’s been in anguish over whatever it is he’s been doing.
And that's a wrap! I
Draco coughs as he spits up red blood. The metallic taste is familiar. He remembers tasting it while a green-eyed hero clutches his body as his soul swiftly departs. It is not much different now, with
Draco was such a good actor. But it only took one minute with Potter for it to collapse.
“I did.”
“Present!” Harry sat up, forgetting he wasn’t in class. Everyone laughed at his obvious embarrassment and looked to who called on him. It was Terry Boot and he was waiting for Harry’s answer. “Uhh, fuck it. Dare.”
He reached out with his clean hand and held tightly onto Harry’s thigh, “no, not just flatmate,” he promised.
“Hurt him, and I hurt you,” she threatened him.
Harry pulls Draco into his lap and holds him tightly. They sit in silence, comfortable in each other’s presence. After a while, Harry looks over Draco’s shoulder and pries his hands open so he can trace his palm. He focuses at a particular break in the lifeline, where it starts again just a few millimetres to the right. He turns his palm up and compares the two side by side. Their lifelines are exactly the same; breaking only to continue.
They settled into the couch and watched Harry’s favourite comedy show in silence except for the sound of chewing and occasional laughter.
So much like the past. It seems there is no change, other than it will not be him dying first. No, in this life Harry is the one who will leave first. Draco hates it.
“Well, why else would we be glowing? I took it as a compliment—” upon the state of panic Harry was starting, Hermione decided to change her angle, “—okay, so this glowing thing. Maybe you should elaborate more on it so I can understand. So
Harry!”
“I don’t want to be a killer though.” Draco murmurs, his eyes closed.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed, “you kiss idiots? Should I fear for Granger and Weasley’s relationship? Or is that a thing you three do?”
any. That meant, whatever you felt for me was–”
By the time he was on his third flower, he heard footsteps. He straightened and tried to brush off the petals. He wasn’t fast enough as Harry caught him still holding onto the step in his other hand. Draco froze, unsure.
Harry looked up at the familiar sneering voice, only this time it was more questioning than filled with vitriol. Malfoy? What was he doing in Birmingham, of all cities?
Upon returning for their eighth year after the war, there had been civility between those against Voldemort and those who cowed before him. It had increased to friendships, particularly with Blaise and most of the Gryffindor boys. His dark sense of humour was right up Seamus’ alley and the two would often be found snickering away by the fireplace in the common room.
Draco could only stare at the traitorous friends. He had told them things in
Draco nodded, “I see.”
Harry looked to the two and pursed his lips in concentration. “I don’t care about the people outside the match I’m working on. They aren’t important, it’s the happiness of the couple I care about. Surely after everything she’s been through, Parkinson’s mum will allow her some semblance of joy?”
Draco sucks in air and tightens his embrace around Harry. Damn those prophecies!
“Thanks,” Harry muttered, watching Draco leave the room.
“I won’t tell anyone anything, this is purely
In the days waiting for the next session, Harry and Draco talked more. Now that Draco was less clingy and praising Harry with fewer sonnets, conversations seemed easier to initiate. Draco apologised profusely for making a spectacle of himself. He would turn pink every time Harry would bring up one of the poems Draco had made for him.
, he prayed.
They were both panting and Harry focused on Draco’s shiny lips, slightly swollen from when Harry had–
Apollo looks up and watches as a bird takes flight in the air. He nods quietly, and sighs. “He had moments of recollection, but we erased it from his mind to ensure Voldemort remains unaware. I am to understand that your magic offers telepathy?”
Malfoy pouts, and smacks Harry’s shoulder, quickly apologising when Harry groans. “No, Harry. Make it a fair fight at least.”
’ let him know who it was who just arrived. Harry started to rush his task of draining the pasta, so he could join Teddy and Draco faster. Three years together (well, two and a half years, but Harry wanted to round up), yet the newness of their relationship was still present. Harry believed they’d always be in their Honeymoon period.
“His soul remained on earth and reincarnated continuously… and there was no change. The two continued to meet and separate. That is until a new prophecy was made.”
“Forgiveness is a journey. It takes time to get to, but it all starts with that first step.”
“It goes back to the myth of Cupid. The arrow will be shot at the potential victim and whoever the victim eyes first will become the love interest. Cupid always shot the second person so the love was reciprocated. In this sense, with Eros’ arrow, you were the first to touch Mr Malfoy were you not?”
Feeling his shirt turning damp, Draco pulled Harry away slowly. His heart shuttered at seeing his happy Harry sad. “What’s the matter?” he asked, sitting up, pulling Harry with him.
“What exactly do you mean?” He tilted his head, careful not to curl his hair behind his ears, purposefully suffering his fringe poking into his eyes. His glasses were pointless, they were barely the right prescription, and they didn’t protect his eyes from his hair’s attacks.
Draco shook his head, “you shouldn’t say that. You’re also not the most attractive.”
Harry relays this to Draco who was strangely quiet until Harry has finished.
Harry raised an eyebrow and turned to the little table they kept by the coatrack. Draco flushed slightly and returned to the battle of shoes and laces. He kept one hand raised, waiting for Harry to take the food. When he did, Draco mumbled
Draco stared at the man resting peacefully by his side. Everywhere they touched was warm to him. He leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder and sighed happily. Harry looked up from the letter he was reading and stared at Draco. They stared at each other lovingly for a minute.
– with a kiss. It was a quick, chaste kiss, yet it was enough to give him a deep blush. Draco caught sight of Harry’s ears and was glad to know he wasn’t the only one unaffected.
for any help.
So why,
Harry must have spoken aloud, “oh, just a bit of exploring.”
“Mione suggested that we were willing to accept his apology, only that we needed to see proof that he had changed. So for the next few whatevers, Mione’s gonna keep an eye on him or somethin’... Honestly, I just wanted to leave the whole time.”
“I understand I won’t find anyone to love me truly like your aura vision likes to suggest. But this is low Potter. Even for you.”
“Spend your time watching me Malfoy?” Harry grinned at Draco, but his smile slowly fell from his face at Draco’s stare. “Malfoy?” he questioned.
He sees them again a second time.
Muggle AU, cus why not?
Draco’s head bangs against the tile floors as a result of the curse. He grunts at the force and gasps for air. He hopes death is swift so that the pain inside and outside ceases.
from the cuts on his forehead. Aunt Bella had her fist on his hair, forcing his head up.
With that in mind, he got ready for bed. It was nearing midnight, and if he wanted to be well-rested, sleep would be the way to do. Providing he didn’t wake up with night terrors again.
No one protested to her blatant disregard for the order. In fact, everyone and the portraits had been hoping it would happen sooner.
Draco finds himself opening up about the little tidbits his mother shared when they were alone. Away from his father’s ears. Tales of pranks gone wrong, pranks gone right. Laughter filling the corridors in the Most Noble House of Black. Despite how grim it is now, in the past it was anything but. Children would fill the many rooms. Sirius and Regulus would play in the gardens with Andromeda and Narcissa. Bellatrix would bring her classmates over and study, but when she was done, she too would partake in the revelry.
The pillow next to Harry was now sliding off Ron’s face. Ron grabbed the pillow and prepared to throw it at Harry, smiling when he saw Harry start to relax. Harry’s previous anxious expression was now full of bright amusement. Ron smirked and picked up another pillow. Pillow fight it was.
Harry stared at his phone in despair. His one true hope, Hermione, was sick and unable to make it for their revision session. He typed out a frantic message asking her how long she would be out for, only to have a message from Ron telling him to let Hermione rest. He sent
“It was just the Amortentia.” He mumbles, his fingers tracing his swollen lips. Ignoring the heat that rushes through him when he can see part of Harry’s skin revealed when he adjusts his jumper.
Mark nodded to his coworker Mikey in the break room. He waited patiently as he clocked into his shift. He’d been working at the restaurant for a few months and so far had no complaints. His coworkers were nice, and the patrons were polite and obviously the upper class. Even better, they tipped well which was why he remained there.
Harry was brought back to the present when he heard Draco squeal excitedly. (
He moved to push Draco off his lap, which let Draco know he was about to be rejected. He bit his lip and he made a move to stand and walk away when Harry’s hand wrapped around his wrist. He looked down into the deep green eyes and lost his breath at the hope he saw in them.
Harry shook his head, smiling and turning back to his letter, “nothing, love.”
- a sudden realisation
Harry grumbled to himself and crossed his arms over his chest in silent protest. He tried to ignore Malfoy’s hands that were caressing his hair. He tried to ignore the delight he could feel growing from the sensation. It wasn’t right for him to feel it, especially with what was wrong with Malfoy at the moment. It wouldn’t do any good.
–◊–◊–◊–◊–
“Okay.” Harry’s voice echoes into the room. Harry is unsatisfied with his progress tracking Draco and sees this as an opportunity to see what Draco is up to.
“Narcissus is the scientific name of the daffodil. Then again, I can see the value of being named after such a flower. It represents renewal and strength. Something mother and I have been trying our best to do, as of late. She’s reached out to Aunt Andromeda. I’m sure you might’ve heard?”
Draco scoffs, “sure perfect Potter gets extra points, but for me, I’m just –”
“Is something troubling you Harry?” Flitwick asked, pulling himself up to sit onto his table. He was the perfect image of a concerned teacher, wanting to guide the wayward youth.
Oh who was he kidding, he doubted he could pretend to be friends with Draco if this was how things would be if they were
(See the end of the chapter for
The silence between them was suddenly awkward. Harry would’ve apparated away if CCTV wasn’t a thing. He was starting to feel uncomfortable and his toes curled in his shoes.
—————
Draco’s voice disappears into the room, yet his sobs remain. Harry pulls his head back and rests it on his shoulder. He shivers slightly as Draco’s breaths tickle him.
Ron shook his head. He did
Harry walks in front of Draco into the classroom, “I got another missive from Slughorn. He wants us to redo the Amortentia and its antidote since that was the one you messed up on last time.”
“Brilliant party mate! I still have flashbacks from it. I doubt I’ve ever drunk that much since the end of May!” Seamus’ smile was contagious and Harry found himself mirroring it.
The pain brings a return of the memories. He winces and twitches every now and again — aftershocks, Snape calls them when he next sees Draco.
“Ha–”
by Oasis, his head moving to the beat of the guitar. As his eyes were closed, he failed to notice the fond smile Harry was giving him. Something the majority of the common room rolled their eyes to.
“I think she wasn’t aware of the outcome. I remember her being distraught for some time in the summer. I would guess she… She found out about what happened…”
Finally gonna get some heartwarming Sirius and Harry bonding 🥺
“Love?” Ron asks, bewildered by what he’s seeing.
Draco hums in reply, content with the affection Harry shows him. He turns his head so he can see the sparkling laurel leaf green eyes. Once Harry starts talking again, all he can do is focus on his mouth.
A 5p coin had rolled under the gap of this cupboard when he was six. He would spend hours imagining the things he could buy with such a shiny piece of precious material.
The smell of seasoned meat took over his senses and he was drawn to the open kebab shop. It’s flickering neon lights gave him the same irritating headache as in the club. But the smell was too enticing, and he admitted to himself that he was getting increasingly hungry. He reached the door and opened it, causing the smell to increase in strength. It looked as if he wasn’t the only tipsy person in the establishment. He spied a couple getting way too cosy in public and moved away from them. He leaned against the glass, joining the queue.
“So, now that you’ve distracted my girlfriend, how else are you going to entertain me? OUCH!”
“I aim not to, then,” Harry said, freeing his sleeve and rushing away from her.
“Potter, I never took you as a voyeur,” Draco smirked.
The Half-Blood Prince’s book truly is a blessing and he has no qualms about taking advantage of it. Not if it gets him the high marks in the class he’s been struggling with since the beginning of his time at Hogwarts.
“Nothing can tear us apart now.”
Harry starts, not realising that they had followed him. He stands and turns to them, his hands finally leaving Malfoy’s face, only to reach for his hand.
Draco leaned up and gave an affectionate peck to his forehead. He resettled onto his pillow, this time folding his arm up so he could lean on his bicep. His hand raised, tracing along Harry’s hairline, down to his jaw.
“How did you guys know you found the right one?” Harry asked. He leaned his hands behind him, and he leaned back, relaxed. He thought back to his late lunch with Malfoy– no, Draco. He watched the sky slowly turn darker and more orange as the sun was getting ready to set.
Hermione takes a sip from the warm tea and stars at Harry who stares back. She places it back down. “You’re happy?”
“I have no problem with older, but I definitely do have one with women,” Harry teased back, uncaring of how it would sound. He had lost his chance to come out and surprise Ron and Hermione. They had such knowing looks when he told them, it had frustrated him to no end.
Cally laughed, “people generally don’t. You shouldn’t be too concerned about that.”
tutored Draco in Potions?” Hermione looks at Harry incredulously.
“What’s so bad about being my love interest?” Malfoy asked, his voice small. He had taken to playing with Harry’s left hand with both of his.
“I’ll try.”
“I’m scared to apologise. I, of course, want to be forgiven. I know I don’t deserve it, but the thought of people not accepting my apology or… or hexing me instead… I’m scared. I know I obviously deserve it, that and worse.”
with it. How much longer would this torture have to last?
“Lumos.”
Laughter echoed around the house. Kreacher who was preparing breakfast merely rolled his eyes and cast a stasis spell on the food.
*****
Harry shook his head, “I don’t go out into Wizarding areas. I’m sure you read about my secret love affair?”
Harry’s head flies up at his name, “yes sir?”
“Did you see Seamus’ face when I hit the back of his head? I can never thank you enough for teaching me that melting spell Ron! His shriek will be the highlight of this holiday.” Neville wiped a tear from his eye, enjoying the revenge he got on Seamus. He had cast the jelly-leg jinx on Neville prior to the game, causing him to tumble face forward into a large mound of snow.
It was finally December and the holidays were fast approaching. Harry tapped his feet to the intro of Will Smith’s
Harry growled the mirth he felt earlier leaving him. He needed to let Draco see that he wasn’t making fun of him. He grabbed Draco again, ignoring his protest and glares. Instead of taking just his wrist though, he laced their fingers together. The contact of their palms seemed to shock Draco into silence. Harry let himself savour it for a few seconds longer before he spoke.
“Yeah, he did.”
Harry finished his remaining water and pastie. He pushed off the little crumbs in a futile attempt of cleaning the flakes off. He stupidly wore a wool jumper and the more he shoved, the smaller the flakes got; the more they burrowed into the gaps.
, his inner voice said.
“How could you not have known?” he had asked Harry.
He moved his phone away from his ear and waited for her to stop her shouting. She was a very excitable woman, and there was nothing like a date to get her going. Another fact he knew too well.
Harry’s face turns, it strikes Draco suddenly, that Harry is shorter in this life.
Draco nodded, still refusing to look at him.
Fortunately, Snape rushes his way in and casts the spell to heal him. Draco fades away into darkness and eases into sleep. So deeply he sleeps, that he manages to forget all that he remembers of him and the green-eyed boy of generations before.
If possible, Draco’s heart breaks another time. Did it even get the chance to heal from the last pain?
Draco’s eyes shrank into slits, giving Potter his best evil stare, “depends on what, you simple human?”
With dread, he realised what was going to happen. He could no longer take any more of this. He was going to become a recreant.
He heard the kitchen door open and familiar footsteps creep up behind him. He wasn’t surprised to find his neck kissed multiple times. Harry kicked backwards and grinned at the Draco’s shout of feigned outrage. Hands found themselves around Harry’s waist, snaking around until he was hugged from behind. Draco’s chin tucked into Harry’s shoulder.
“Do you reckon it’ll be today?” Hermione asked Pansy.
They stayed in Harry’s room for a good two hours before leaving. They couldn’t keep their hands off of each other; be it a hand on the waist, or the soft touch of lips to the nape. Harry was happy, this time not from watching others’ romance blossom, but because of his own.
“I believe so, yes,” he voice strained somewhat in reply.

In light of recent events, friendships started forming more easily. Pansy and Hermione took to bonding over their idiot friends, while Ron and Theodore found themselves playing pranks on unassuming prey.
Draco thought back to how it was when they started out. It was a roller coaster, and at some point, it had just kept going up. There was no end in sight, and he was totally fine with that.
Draco looked to Neville and Seamus and smiled softly, “I guess I see the appeal in seeing love form.”
Harry smirks at Ron’s red face.
Malfoy shakes his head, smiling lightly, “thank you.” He says again.
He rushed into his bedroom and looked at the messy state of it. He cursed Ron, he had just spent the morning tidying it. He was probably looking for a sock, which he’d know how to find if he was more organised. He moved to his nightstand and pulled the drawer open where the book was waiting for him.
Ron scoffs beside them. Harry elbows him, “knock it off.”
“You’d be surprised.” Harry murmured. Making up his mind, he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder calling his attention back. “I have something to tell you, but I’d rather it was somewhere private. Are you free?”
He placed the bouquet Cally made on the ground by the headstone. Starting to feel an ache, he settled himself and sat cross-legged. He fiddled one of the baby’s breaths. Some had silver glitter glued on their edges rubbed off onto his fingers. From what Harry knew of Teddy’s glitter, it would take forever to get rid of.
Harry laughs and tugs Draco closer. “Alright, I’ll stop. Gosh.”
A glow lit up from the wand of one Harry Potter. His expression was hidden behind the shadows of his fringe. Draco knew what he would find though. A troubled gaze disguising a triumphant gleam. Draco was used to it by now. Harry was often conflicted about what they did at the start, but once they got going, he was
“The most peculiar thing happened mate. To me and Mione earlier. We were just talking about our winter plans, what we’d do when we go out and explore in Muggle London when Malfoy, of all people, came over.”
“Did you know the gods of fertility have been working for aeons to create such a shade. Yet, they never would have found one more perfect than what I see in your eyes?”
- someone who is prone to scheming in a harmful way.
Harry searched the common room, the library, everywhere. If there was one thing Draco was good at, it was avoiding Harry. Something he had done for the past few weeks. It was a skill Harry initially enjoyed, not wanting to see his nemesis so often. However, he needed to find Draco. He had
The cheeky grin he saw made him roll his eyes and ignore him for the rest of the way.
From what he could grasp from the conversation, Draco – blondie – and Harry – curly – were dating for two months and hadn’t told their friends, until that day. Ron – ginger – was very vocal and visually upset by this news. Mark winced when he heard how Harry used to date Ron’s sister and was now dating the ‘Ferret’ which he assumed was Draco. The nickname was obviously lacking in love as it caused Draco to almost climb over the table, but Pansy – pixie-cut – restrained him. The other two, Hermione and Blaise, were taking in the situation calmly. Hermione actually confessed how she thought they had chemistry during their years in school, and that she should have seen it coming. Blaise surprised the table by agreeing with her and saying how the school had placed bets on this relationship coming to fruition.
Neville pulled Harry’s hand away from the fraying edge of his sweater, “Harry, it’s okay to– y’ know.”
The room suddenly increased in volume much to the irritation of the inhabitants who enjoyed the solace. Harry supposed one of the school buses had arrived and brought with it more stressed sixth formers. He suddenly sat up, realising that it probably meant there was someone who could help him. He quickly tidied his notes away and searched through the influx of grumbling students. He wasn’t sure if he would be given help in the first place, but it was worth a shot. The person in his mind wasn’t exactly close friends with him. Hopefully, they were friendly enough with each other that helping him wouldn’t be too much of a burden.
“I want to go back. I have some things to make up for.”
. He starts to climb.
His mother has become more aloof as the years progressed, choosing to ignore the screams and terror that surrounds their home. Screams often brought by his father’s hand. She used to be full of life and elegant, but now she is quiet and demure. Talks less, and stares into the clouds— as if hoping for better days, but not knowing how to find them.
He risked a look at Potter, and his breathing eased when he noticed Potter was looking outside. No doubt looking at the flickering lanterns.
Two more people joined them in their hidden circle, laughing at what they saw. Pansy and Ron was another friendship that Harry hadn’t expected. He supposed there’s an ironic symmetry to the trios. Hermione and Blaise as the intelligent, book-smart, friends, while Ron and Pansy were the strategic ones with a cunning kick. Harry hid a shudder since that meant he and Malfoy were the compatible ones.
Draco groaned and sunk into a crouch. He banged his fist against the ground multiple times, relishing in feeling something other than the heated fury within him. He was angry at himself for losing his senses and cuddling Potter,
“I’m pretty sure I know my own mind, Mione.” Harry leaned further into his couch, wanting to meld with the material. Maybe if he became part of the seat he’d fade into obscurity and just be normal. Harry Potter, the chair. Sounded nice.
“Boys?” Flitwick could not have chosen a better time to interrupt them. They both looked at him, and he mutely pointed to the Arrow.
At this Malfoy pouted, drawing Harry’s eyes to his lips. He never noticed how pink they were against his pale skin. They looked soft, cared for, unlike Harry’s chapped lips he continuously bit at.
“Morning fiancé.” Draco greeted.
“The happiest I’ve been since sixth year when he and I started.”
Harry glared at her and turned to Draco, whose eyes were sparkling with delight now that Harry’s attention was on him. Irises still encased in that pink tint, letting Harry know it wasn’t real. Harry searched his eyes, trying to find if the real Malfoy was still there.
“What a silly name. It sounds so weird, don’t you think Harry?” His new friend turns to him, anticipating for him to agree.
pick up French. Just today, in fact, through a translating charm. It’s probably not worn off yet.”
can end if he only says a few words.
One of them, Harry wasn’t sure who groaned into the kiss. Harry turned so that Draco was on top of him. He welcomed the weight with glee and stroked his hand up Draco’s back, bringing his jumper up with it, revealing his white polo shirt. Harry repeated the motion, this time with Draco’s shirt. The gasp Draco let out allowed Harry entrance, and from then on Harry couldn’t remember what happened. He was lost in Draco’s touch.
Prey that for the past few days were Harry and Malfoy. Malfoy would get chocolates, or letters signed
Harry flinched. He didn’t like the wording, but essentially that was indeed the case. “Yep. It seems that after making the world a safe place to live, I have also been tasked the job to see that everyone gets their happy ending with their loved one.”
He listens in sadness upon hearing how Sirius was Harry’s ticket out. Only for him to die and for Harry to wallow in despair upon losing his hope. He internally cheers Harry on when it’s revealed that Harry trashed Dumbledore’s office in the wake of his rage. And rightly so! He hates how the person most special in Harry’s life is someone related to Draco, and how the one most hated by Harry is also related to Draco.
“Merlin, he’s asking deep questions,” the man groaned. He grabbed a tall glass and handed it over to Harry, “here, have a sip of this.”
Harry’s rambling thoughts were broken when the man hiccoughed, giving away that he wasn’t as sober as he acted. It reminded Harry of what the man incorrectly said.
It was currently free period between lunch and dinner and Harry had taken to the table near the bookshelf. He was observing Neville and Seamus’ interactions and almost squealed when their hands touched and it seemed like Neville chose to keep his hand in his grip rather than let go.
“Would you like some coffee?”
His current match in the works was none other than Neville and Seamus. When he first saw the auras blend Harry had been shocked. He was expecting Dean and Seamus to have a connection, but just the other day Dean had revealed his choice to remain single for the remainder of the year. And Harry respected that. He also respected couples whose auras didn’t merge at all. He wouldn’t get in the middle of a fight like that, it would be wrong. But should the couple break up, he’d happily assist then.
Harry already conquered death, which meant he no longer had enemies. So what did that make Malfoy?
“Huh?” Harry looks up from rubbing his jumper sleeve between his forefinger and thumb. “Oh, nothing new. Just trying to figure out what more I can teach you, my little protege.”
: City mentioned is Birmingham. In this city, there are colloquial terms such as bab used as a term of endearment. It’s not a typo. I moved to Birmingham around 2001 so I’m going by memory for some of these facts – could be wrong for some of them, sorry ^^;
Draco’s eyebrows raised, was Potter acting thick on purpose? “Yes? Who else would I be talking to? Peeves isn’t anywhere near us, and if he was I doubt I would have been quiet with him. Not after – that’s beside the point. What the heck is that?” Draco pointed at the thing Potter pulled out of his ear.
Draco listens in abject horror as Harry unravels every little horror that happened in his childhood. He tries to picture little Harry, frightened Harry, crying Harry hiding. Trying to defend himself against his two tormentors. Draco’s anger riles up when he hears how angry Harry got when he realised it was Dumbledore who decided it would be safer for him to live with his family.
Harry laughs and starts preparing the table. He opens his textbook again and finds the page that they need. “Do you want to do it as my textbook says, or as yours?”
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco, “I hear that so much. You’ve got your mother’s eyes, you’ve got your father’s hair yadda yadda yadda.”
Draco rejected the idea of acting like the proper pureblood whilst Harry disregarded everyone who wanted him to be the figurehead of a new improved Wizarding world. For both of them, the Muggle world offered solace. It was funnily enough where they reconnected.
’ and they feel slightly guilty for listening in on such a private show.
Draco looked up from pouring the tea, “yeah. Thought it’d help.”
Harry gaped at her rant, he was sure that he had read the whole thing — back to front — multiple times when he first discovered what was wrong with him. Of course, he may have been reading fast, skipping sentences to get to the bottom of what to do… Okay, maybe she was right.
“Wait, when you said
He was ten when he realised how futile his hopes were. £1.60 was only enough to get him to the town centre, never mind a different city. No matter, he finally saved up £15. Child fare was cheap, and he definitely looked under ten. He could probably pass off as key stage one with how short he was. The only trouble was, how could he manage to convince someone to pretend to be his guardian so he could finally go away?
Harry thought, seeing the distinguishable blond hair. He shouldered one of his backpack straps and made his way over to Draco, who was fixing his hair from the mess the strong wind outside no doubt made. He stopped a few steps away and bit his lip, wondering how he would approach this.
Harry’s answering moan.
He walked out and passed another coworker, Samantha. She beckoned him to follow her by the welcome area and pointed at an occupied table in her section.
“Whoop whoop! Atta Gryffindor!” Seamus thumped Harry’s back with a grin.
Malfoy shrugged, “They know their flowers. Of course, so do we, but they put their love into their craft. Flowers are another language of their own. You could say sorry by giving someone tulips, for example.” At this, Malfoy looked around, and noticing that no one was paying attention to them, he transfigured his napkin into a pale pink tulip. He handed it over to Harry, who took it silently. “Tulips represent new beginnings, pink represents sincerity, and if it’s pale it also shows sympathy.”
Harry rolled his eyes and tried to play it off, “okay, fine. Let’s say I don’t know what you’re talking about. Care to elaborate?”
For the next few days, he kept his eyes down and cleared his mind. He didn’t know how he would be able to pull this off. Never mind when.
He was about to step out when he heard Malfoy.
“Just some pasta. Teddy made the meatballs. Don’t comment on how irregular they are.”
Malfoy nodded, eyes softening, “you care about me? What happens to me after?”
Harry tried to push himself away, but Malfoy seemed stronger and wouldn’t let him budge. He ignored the feeling of Malfoy’s smiling cheeks against his.
Draco stops talking, turning to Harry. He isn’t sure if Ron and Hermione are aware of the dark times in Harry’s life. It isn’t for him to reveal. Harry merely nods, letting him carry on.
He wandered down the streets in Islington and ended up in Old Paradise Yard where he found a place that looked convincing. He entered the establishment and held back a sneeze from the abundance of pollen that suddenly wanted to greet him.
Flitwick carried on with his lecture, “this arrow is inspired by Cupid, hence the name Eros’ arrow. Of course, that arrow is a lot less potent and simply injects the feeling of romance to a person. This is somewhat deadlier as you become blind to things. Anger, sadness and fear are healthy and necessary sometimes.” Flitwick looked over his glasses, taking note of the students who cowed at his words, he’d encourage them to visit the hired mind-healer later. “It goes without saying, I do not want any of you touching this arrow. Are we clear?”
“I— I can’t be sure.”
“Harry… Harry…” Draco gasped once more, tears dampening Harry’s neck and staining his shirt as they fell. He leaned back slightly and looked into Harry’s eyes. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Harry followed along, listening as Malfoy told him more about Birmingham.
“Potter!”
The candles remained where they left it previously. Four on each window sill, and three on the table in front of them. The room got considerably brighter.
“I apologise for how touchy I’ve been the past few weeks. I know how much I can get, I tend to ignore things like personal space.” Draco was purposefully sat on the opposite side of the sofa. Their legs were stretched out in the space between them, hence why it was so easy for Harry to push the soles of their feet together.
Harry rolled his eyes. It was a good thing he had nothing planned tomorrow then, he supposed. He pocketed his phone and walked back into his kitchen and grabbed a glass. He was thirsty and required watering. Hold on, that made him sound like a plant. He really did need more sustenance, a light snack, perhaps. He filtered through his cabinets and found some bourbon cookies.
He spotted Pansy laughing at something Ginny was telling her. Harry looked for an alternative, but Blaise wasn’t anywhere near, and Harry couldn’t wait much longer. He approached them, his confidence growing with each step.

“He explained how Eros’ Arrow works.”
There in Sirius’ loopy handwriting said:
“You make a good point, I suppose,” Draco said.
“Will you forgive me?”
past life… are you inferring that—”
“Yes, Harry. I am. You are Achilles.”
“You look at Draco the way he looks at you when you think he’s not looking,” she finally revealed.
Over time, the memories are lost again.
Cally hummed, “any lily in particular? I saw you looking at the tiger lilies earlier. They typically represent mercy and compassion. We also have a few in yellow that represent thankfulness, if you’d like? In my opinion, white lilies would look wonderful with the irises. As they're for your mother, they're very appropriate as they represent motherhood.”
—————
“If I tell you, I may have to kill you,” Draco says, going for the dramatics.
Despite fearing the answer, Draco knew he had to ask, “And what exactly did your conversation entail?”
“How can I help you today, love?”
Draco scoffs and fixes his robes, which became displaced when Ron pushed against him. “None of your business Weasel. Just a minor disagreement.”
Harry nods silently, quickly hugs Draco once more and heads out. Draco’s strength during the last few minutes gives way and he collapses against the guest chair. However, a familiar piece of wood is poking his hip.
—————
Hermione must’ve been aware of this as she gripped his arm and shook her head.
There weren’t a lot of things that piqued Harry’s interest these days. It seemed as if he was tired of mystery and intrigue. The thought of having to run to go somewhere other than the great hall for breakfast left a sour taste in his mouth. He just wanted to live his life simply, and with the least amount of drama.
“Haha,” Harry deadpanned, turning his attention back to Pansy, “Draco. Where’s Draco?”
Did he even have a right to call the Saviour by his first name?
“No catch… I just want to believe you’re doing the best you can. I used to believe the worst in you, and maybe if I can see you trying… it’ll help me?”
“Anyways… I believe it's storytime!” He rushes to a spare seat opposite Harry on the breakfast bar and waits for Hermione to take her seat beside him. “You may begin.” He waves at them as if a king gesturing to his servants.
Draco looked up and sneered at his flatmate. He pouted and held out the hand carrying his food.
Feigning disinterest, lest he got caught, Harry paused in his watching, “and pray tell, what have I been doing Malfoy?”
Reincarnation is a concept that Harry never considered before, but it is interesting to hear. He has more questions, but he knows Apollo has more to say. The questions could wait for later.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, his voice soft. Somewhat fond.
“Stop teasing me already!” he growls into Harry’s mouth, who unmistakenly shivers at his tone.
Potter had turned and looked straight at Draco, causing Draco’s apology to pause.

He took his phone out once more and saw that Ginny had messaged him privately on Instagram. The message was simply someone’s account, with her caption of

Harry laughs, “no you don’t.”
Draco wriggled his eyebrows suggestively, “what doth thou thinketh?”
“Afraid not, Mr Malfoy. What’s this week’s occasion?” Cally asked.
, he surmised. Being Draco’s Auror partner this past year was very educational. Whenever Draco was flustered, he tended to say things without thinking about it properly. It also made Harry see him in a different light. He was interested to see if they could be more; they certainly had the chemistry. They knew each other’s tells and were so attuned to each other that they didn’t have to communicate verbally whenever they duelled dark wizards. If this was going to progress into further – like he had been hoping for the past two months – then he needed this confrontation now.
that you are speaking of Professor?” Draco cannot help but sneer across him where Harry stands.
Harry steps into the forest with a light heart. He trusts Hermione and Ron to continue to finish off the other Horcruxes once the one in him is gone. He is ready for death, he just hadn’t calculated one Draco Malfoy into his plans. Everything became jumbled in his mind when he felt the arms around his waist.
This weekend found him wandering around the city of Birmingham. He bypassed the Woolworths and the Argos store. Meandering through the crowds of busy shoppers. He ironically didn’t mind being in crowds, as long as he blended in; anonymous. He stood at the ramp leading into the shopping centre and followed one direction of the two-way traffic.
It went like this.
Neville’s voice brought their attention to him, “I sometimes feel like I’m still recovering from my hangover.” He peeked beneath his fringe and smiled at them, “Hey everyone.”
“Who is us? Who are we? What are we?” Harry slurred, leaning towards the blond man.
Draco’s laughter slowed into little chuckles before they faded into the room. He looked at Harry’s stricken face before realisation hit him. He smiled sardonically, “I don’t have a partner do I?”
Shocked after having such a gentle, smiley Draco, Harry backed off.
Harry shook his head, “no, no. I knew a person called Dudley. You’re telling me it’s a place?”
Harry wakes up to a field. He is on top of a hill. Soft music plays in the background, a familiar tune that he cannot place. There are birds chirping sweetly as if it were spring.
Hermione leans forward, “so how did you guys keep it a secret?”
*****
Never mind. Scrap that thought.
Draco reached out, grabbing Harry’s hand and tugged him over to another section of the store. Harry merely smiled adoringly at his boyfriend, “yes, dear.”
“Woah, what’s going on here?” Ron rushes to the two of them and shoves Draco off.
He walks out to the clearing where Voldemort and his followers wait. Riddle is surprised to see Harry alone, but knowing what he does of the boy, it’s to be expected at this point.
“Harry! Hey!”
“Oi Weasel, how much more gauche can you be?”
Fortunately, for Harry, Draco remained tactile with him. The hugs had lessened, but Draco still reached for Harry’s hand whenever they passed each other in the corridor.
He thought about asking Luna since she was taking both Spanish and French, but her hair was all over the place from the frustration she felt. He found it odd that Luna was acting in such a manner, she was very gifted in languages — and everything else academic really. Then he saw her lift her textbook and noticed that it said: “
Harry jumps, not expecting them to be so close to him all of a sudden. “Yeah, I’m just looking for Malfoy. I’ve got to give him back his wand and all…”
Oh, he was mortified. Maybe he’ll have to save the apology for when he returns from the holidays. Or maybe never. Maybe it was his fate to never be forgiven by Potter…
“Bring it on, I look forward to it, sweetcheeks.”
“Spit it out, Ferret. I haven’t got all day.”
Malfoy nods to himself, whatever he needs to say seems to take all his energy. He deflates a little and slouches, alerting Ron. Malfoy never slouches, leans against, but never slouches.
“Yes, I’m sorry if you’re busy with other things, but I really need help with our speaking test. Hermione was supposed to come in and help me with it, but she isn’t feeling too good. Do you think you could test me on some things? I mean– only if you’re free, that is.” Harry wriggled his toes in his shoes, hiding how anxious he was. He was
“How could you possibly understand what it’s like to have no one to turn to during your darkest times?”
“Need help, Harry?” he asked.
, Harry thought,
, okay. Maybe Ginny was onto something.
“So soft,” he murmurs, finding he can’t let go. His hands open and he pats Draco’s hair. Draco, in turn, leans into the touch and moans. Harry finds that he quite enjoys that sound, so he repeats the motion. Draco turns his head so that it’s his cheek that Harry now touches. Harry gulps at the contact, feeling out of his depth.
Ron entered the bedroom with a confused stare. Harry looked up from his walkman, trying to pick up whatever signal he could. He was getting tired of the songs he had downloaded, and until the next visit to London came about – or anywhere there was a computer cafe really – he was stuck surfing through the channels.
Harry quickly tidied away the items in the box but kept one picture out. The one of his parents slow dancing, with Sirius photobombing. He imagined a silver frame, decorated in silver lilies and pearls. When his eyes opened, the picture was safely encased in its new home. He traced his parents form with his forefinger and smiled to himself.
Ron, on the other hand, can finally understand Draco. Likewise, he will do anything for his family probably even kill, if the exchange meant keeping them alive. They may be oblivious to his needs and wants, now and again, but they are still family. Hearing Draco’s struggle with his morals made him warm up even more to the young Malfoy.
Harry relaxed, knowing that Draco wasn’t going to start throwing hexes. Only, he became alarmed as tears started to pool in Draco’s eyes. His smile started to disappear and he struggled to breathe. His grip was so tight on the arrow that when he fell to the ground, it moved slightly toward the edge of the table.
Harry nodded, “they’re practically perfect for each other.” The glow between the two was starting to become silver again and he was practically blinded by the brightness. He had noticed that the longer the emotions were suppressed the brighter the light. Ron and Hermione’s had been subtle because they were open in expressing their love for each other.
Draco laughed softly and Harry found himself bringing his other fingers toward his face. He caressed his cheek fondly and watched as Draco closed his eyes and leaned into his palm. Harry felt his breath stutter when Draco’s eyes opened. He could feel Draco start to lean in and was feeling his resolve to not do this decrease. But, as Draco closed in, his pink-tinted eyes brought Harry back to reality. This wasn’t what Draco wanted. Not truly. And Harry would hate himself if he took advantage of the situation.
Draco laughed and pulled Harry down wrapping both arms around him tightly. Harry closed his eyes and listened to Draco’s heartbeat. It was calm and steady. It felt like home if a person could be described as home. He couldn’t help himself, he started to tear up. After all these years of searching for a home, he finally found one. In Draco Malfoy, of all people.
“You actually saved the git?” Weasley’s voice interrupts.
The man who fiddled with his collar nodded in gratitude, “yes. I want something free from alcohol, perhaps. I’ll have the daiquiri mocktail, please.” He turned to the man whose dark hair was slowly growing frizzier by the second, “darling, how about you?”
For being so good at silent communication, they sucked at speaking out loud to each other.
Harry took his wand out and looked for any traces of magic residue on Ron. Sadly, the only thing he could find was a cleaning charm, no doubt for his constant messiness. Or at least, Harry hoped it was.
Draco followed behind silently, thinking things could have gone worse, but at least he’s a step closer to forgiveness. And that’s all he was after. Potter turned, making sure Draco was still following him. He probably didn’t like how slow Draco was going as he reached for Draco and tugged on his sleeve. The whole time, he hadn’t let go.
He couldn’t help himself, he found himself smiling, “what if he’s straight?”
Draco gave him a dubious look, but nodded, “okay.” He turned to the book and started at the top of the page.
Draco and Harry linked hands and Harry leaned his head onto Draco’s shoulder. Mark walked off. It seemed as if things weren’t going to escalate if Ron’s sigh of acceptance meant anything. The tension earlier had crumbled and he could feel the group’s slow acceptance of the couple. He caught Mikey’s eye and gave him a thumbs up.
“If you can’t be the brave one, I guess it falls on me, just this once,” he said, playfully squeezing Harry's cheeks together. He leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry’s pouting lips.
Malfoy coughed again, still red.
Draco smiles, “mother always had good things to say about him whenever he came up.”
“What do you want?” Harry asks, his tongue tracing Draco’s lower lip.
It doesn’t register for a while, but he starts to wonder what Harry promised, and exactly when this promise was made.
Harry’s answering smile was blinding. Merlin, this man was all his?
Hands are combing through his hair. Oh, how ironic that the two of them have switched crowns. Regardless, the green and the dark brown suit Harry. Draco hears his constant apologies,
Only one more and then I'm done!
It was the weekend before Easter break and he had finally gathered the courage needed to ask if Draco wanted to come home with him. They were browsing through the shops, last minute,  trying to find something interesting to give to Andromeda and Teddy who were staying at Grimmauld Place for the time being.
It had been years since he last saw Malfoy. He decided to take this as an opportunity to find out what he’d been up to in the past few years. What did Malfoy need flowers for? Surely he had is own gardens to gather flowers from. And the prat was as pureblood as they came. Flower arrangements seemed to be something they’d be taught together with how to walk.
“I cannot be alive if he is. It’s one or the other. I obviously don’t want to do this, but Riddle believes in it. So I must…”
“And everything dear to me.” Draco finishes.
“Is my room okay? I doubt Ron’s in there right now.”
Harry smiled at Cally, “I have no preference, just make it look wonderful. I have no limit.”
It was in Madam Malkins that Harry saw another shiny thing. That wasn’t round or hard or easy to lose. Bright yellow hair, almost white. Blue eyes, so pale they were almost grey. Sparkling and directed at
It was weird to be feeling things other than excessive happiness. Draco frowned at his work when he remembered how unrestrained he acted. He was a walking Hufflepuff mascot. He wondered why no one had bothered to tease him about it. For surely, he would have done the same had the roles been reversed. Well, what’s done was done. He could only move forward now. And pretend like nothing ever happened.
Welp. I didn’t know where this was going. It honestly just wrote itself.
“Are you still seeing someone?” Malfoy has asked, eyes focused on his cup. As if it held all the secrets of the world.
“I don’t know why I didn’t see it the first time. But it’s about how I didn’t see an aura around you. Or your aura. Whatever. I… I can’t say it. I think it’s better if you just read it for yourself, and we’ll go from there.”
*****
Turned out, talking wasn’t what Harry needed. Lips met his own and he wondered about how overrated talking was after all. What he had wanted was Draco to do something. Actions truly spoke louder than words, and Harry was enjoying this action very much.
Harry laughed along, “right. I think I’ll go with your suggestion. You’re the expert between us, after all.”
Kreacher walked towards him, holding out his phone, “Master Harry, your phone is buzzing.”

He was so absorbed in the love beginning before him that he hadn’t noticed someone sat next to him until he heard the familiar drawl.
“I have no clue. I was gonna take you to Madame Pomfrey, but if you wanted to go alone–” Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hand, “–okay, let’s go then?”
One Saturday afternoon found Harry and Draco alone in the common room. Everyone had taken advantage of having a free weekend by visiting Hogsmeade, and those with licenses even Apparated to Diagon Alley.
“Oh, if you love performers, there’s plenty at Temple street.”
Draco laughed, “okay then. So who is it? Who am I meant to be paired with?”
“Happy Anniversary mum, dad. Sorry I didn’t greet you sooner.”

“True as that may be, I fear I offended her too much with my words. So I think I’ll stay here. Not only that, but it’s going to be my last Christmas in Hogwarts. I kind of thought it would be nice to spend Christmas in one of the places I call home…”
Now, this night, in particular, was special. It was the night when things changed for Harry and Draco again. Oh, the rest of the common room were aware. But these oblivious fools hadn’t yet seen what could be.
Draco weighed his options, “I guess that’s understandable.” He leaned away from Potter, finally realising how close together they actually were.
“Tips?”
“Don’t be ridiculous Draco. You heard Flitwick, you might as well become a Hufflepuff if you take away your brooding.”

“We argued plenty of times and somehow Draco wheedled it out of me.”
That made him laugh, “how is it possible that you can get any more ridiculous than you are normally? I thought there was a limit. It seems you’ve surpassed it.” The man didn’t sound very drunk, he spoke so eloquently.
“Kreacher, I’ll take my breakfast in the green room,” she says as she leaves.
“You did what now?”

Draco breaks free and huffs, “I’m telling you it was difficult. I had finally freed myself from one secret, only to find myself flooded with many. In a way, Harry helped me relax– oh pish, not like that Weasley– so if anything I was grateful for it. As for keeping it secret… Well…” He looks to his mother, who is merely smiling at what she just discovered.
“What a special talent you seem to have found for yourself. How are you handling it?”
The two brew in silence as the room starts to take a heavenly smell. Harry shakes his head to clear himself of the fumes. Draco too starts to become delirious, smiling as he writes down the different scents he can deduce. Harry hums to himself as he leans over the cauldron and takes a whiff. Pure, concentrated Amortentia is so euphoric! Harry grins over at Draco who mirrors him.
“At least I don’t have a monologue when there’s another person in the area.”
“Truth or dare, Malfoy?” someone asked.
. Only, Harry’s grip never loosened. In fact, he was staring into Draco’s eyes, as if searching for something. An answer to all his questions. Whatever they may be, it seemed Harry found it.

“It’s okay Harry. I understand. Fate has been too kind to me, letting me live. I should’ve expected that that’s all I’d get.”
Hope everyone's staying safe wherever they are!
“Right.” Draco clears his throat.
Harry laughed, “right…”
He suddenly couldn’t breathe. This was the first time that Potter wasn’t glaring at him with revulsion. He moved his left hand, making Draco stiffen as if getting ready for the spell that Potter was obviously getting ready to cast. Instead, his hand carried on rising by his ear where he pulled out something.
“Now, what I’m curious to know about is how did you two start… being y’know. Like that?” Ron waves at the couple.

“Wouldn’t it be better if you used two hands to get rid of your shoes?”
Harry let out an almost hysterical laugh, “of course I do. I’m just a bit shy about it and haven’t told anyone. So if possible, could you drop it and answer my question?” he leaned away from Draco. Better to keep the distance between them, so he could think.
away away away.
Harry blinked, were they actually acting civil?
! He looked into Draco’s eyes and was disheartened to see the pink tint still there.
Harry quickly stepped away, confused, “what?”
“Ahem.”
Draco is almost tempted to vanish his mess of a potion, before realising that getting some sort of grade is better than getting a zero overall. He is so immersed in his tidying that he gets surprised when he hears a cough to his side.
Potter nodded, his eyes focusing on Draco’s shoulder as adopted a calculative look, “perhaps I could help?”
Harry wasn’t sure why he never noticed it before he saw the auras; the lingering hand on the back of a chair; the smitten looks when one wasn’t aware; the louder than expected laugh when one cracked a joke. Ron had absently commented on it one day which was when the epiphany hit Harry.
“Does he–” he grips the grass in tight fists, “does he remember?”
He blinked multiple times, trying to get rid of the

“You’re now blessed by my presence!” He bellows, laughing at the strange looks he gets from the three. “What? I noticed how Harry gets jumpy when we visit him… I figured this was better?”
From the sounds he could hear, the kitchen seemed most probable.
Without much thought, Harry reached out and grasped Draco’s hand and led the two of them to where Flitwick was waiting. He smiled to himself when he heard Draco gasp and tightened his hold. Maybe they could remain as friends when this thing ended. He felt Draco walk faster so he could lean his head on Harry’s shoulder as they walked.
“More,” he pants when he gets the chance, “more.”
“Come here, I have a request for you.”
Malfoy nodded, coughing and taking another sip, “just surprised, is all. I never would’ve thought–”
Harry shook his head, perfectly content to ignore the man behind him, “no I’m perfectly happy with you to take creative freedom in this. What did the book tell you was best?”

Harry figured it would be okay to listen to Draco. Gut instincts etcetera.

Harry turned a page and turned to rest on his stomach, finding the position comfier. “ —For that matter, a match for the Pander would be difficult to find if they glowed much like everyone else. Panders are much more sensitive to others’ auras than their match’s. After much research, it has come to light that the match of Panders appears to emit no aura. When in actuality, they are displaying such pure light, that it is invisible to the human eye.”
“Okay, here goes…” Harry starts.
By some agreement, the students who returned for a repeat of their seventh year had moved in solidarity. They stopped their teasing and acted as if everything was back to normal. As if the past month hadn’t happened. Harry wasn’t sure whether to be proud of them being united, or annoyed at how well they were for it.
, Harry thought.
Like glass shattering upon impact, his joy came to an end.
“How do you know where I live?” Harry asked, trying to pry himself free – unsuccessfully.

Harry laughed, “there’s one thing I can confidently say I didn’t miss!”
He lets go of Draco’s hand and starts to card his fingers through Draco’s hair, smiling when he pulls out a leaf. He gets a sound that he can only describe as being a purr — if humans could purr, that is.
“Okay. Something’s wrong. Tell me.”
It was another day of Malfoy’s slow recovery and since the first session, he refused to go without Harry by his side. The way he was getting so attached to Harry was a constant worry for him. How would Malfoy act once he fully recovered? He could only imagine the hate-filled argument they would inevitably have.
“How have you guys been? I haven’t seen you since your birthday, Harry!” Dean had finally removed his earphones to be part of the conversation. Neville slumped on the window, still asleep.
The two boys don’t notice their pupils dilating, instead choosing to come closer. Harry’s hand reaches out traces Draco’s wrist. They gasp as the sensation. This is peculiar, nothing in the textbook says anything about how touch can change upon inhalation. Draco, emboldened, twists his hand in Harry’s until their fingers are intertwined. His eyes never stray from their hands, lost in the sensation it brings. Harry steps even closer, his other hand raising until his fingers are tracing Draco’s hair by his ear.
“I was going to, but if you’re going to take all my food I think I’ll find somewhere else to go.” He was only bluffing. And Harry knew it too, as he pointedly took another petit four while staring into Draco’s eyes. He raised an eyebrow as he finished it in two bites and winked when he finished. “Prat,” Draco muttered fondly. Harry only smiled in response.
Draco laughed, “Potter come off it!”
“Where is he?” he asked, choosing to skip the small talk and get straight to the point.
It takes a while, but the group hug finally ends with surprised laughter. Birdsong starts somewhere in the Forbidden Forest, unexpected, but truly a sign that fighting is finally over. Well, physical fighting, that is. Harry is well aware that there is still the task of the fickle Ministry to tackle. Hopefully, he won’t be required for it this time. A seventeen-year-old mustn’t be necessary for it, surely.
“Potter?”
Harry felt his heart sink. He was expecting this, but that didn’t make it hurt any less. He nodded in response and watched as Draco walked out of the room. Once the door closed behind him, Harry struggled to stand and leaned against the desk behind him.
, did he feel so little whenever he was confronted by the most well-known Half-blood?
All too soon they were close to each other, close enough to smell each other’s cologne. A cologne that until recently Harry couldn’t get enough of. He smiled at Draco and reached out for his hand. He lifted Draco’s hand and kissed the back of it. He grinned when Draco realised the loophole he found and backed away, enjoying the groans of disappointment.
Flitwick only nodded, “precisely that.”
Harry nudged Draco away with his nose. Of course, he didn’t go very far, what with him wrapped tightly around Harry.
Initially, the plan was supposed to be that they would go as friends. However, roughly two weeks ago, that all changed thanks to a loose stone protruding the ground.
Harry turns his face up to look at Draco, his face lightening, “what kind of stories did she say?”
Draco huffed and pushed against his forehead, “your breath stinks, Potter. I have a spare toothbrush ready. For the love of Merlin, go freshen up before you even think about talking to me.”
Harry was first to his room and he continued pacing even after Draco had walked in.
Now they are hidden behind swollen eyelids. He can recognise those eyes anywhere. One does not stare from across the room for years and not recognise them. He wishes he could shout and celebrate that Harry is alive and breathing! He cannot say anything about Harry’s health, for he is but a realist. Despite that, there is hope for them after all!
He doesn’t intend to fight, or to come back to him.
Draco’s eyes traced the flower as it lowered, and moved back up. “What exactly did you want to do?” He whispered, fearing that if he talked any louder it would ruin the atmosphere.
Draco opened the book before him and randomly stopped at one page.
Moments later, the four are sitting on the Slytherin table, staring at each other. Harry and Draco on one side, Hermione and Ron on the other. Well, more like Hermione and Ron are watching as Harry and Draco have their reunion. Harry and Draco can’t seem to stop whispering into each other’s ears. Hermione and Ron can make out phrases like, ‘
’’s and ‘
Pansy snorted,
“That doesn’t sound so bad. Much better than being a Slytherin in this day and age,” Malfoy muttered.
“Hullo. Hogwarts too?” The boy asked.
Magic may have saved his mortal soul this time around, but the Fates cannot allow the memories to remain. After all, the boy lives with a known powerful Legilimens. It could bring ruin to what they have planned.
“So you’re telling me you can see soulmates?”
Opening the door brought a sense of nostalgia, as it always did. There was a pile of dark chocolate bars on the nightstand, no doubt expired. Dust particles flew in the air where sunlight shone through the curtains. The faint smell of dog remained in the carpet.
It does not take much effort for the two to lean into each other. The sparks Draco used to feel return. There is a warmth creeping into his heart, as if glue, mending the breaks of past and present. His hand moves, without his accord, to grip Harry’s nape. Bringing him tighter, closer. He ignores the glasses pressing into his cheek. The only different sensation, but he can deal with it. He just wants to be as close to Harry as he can.
He reaches the top of a pile, noticing how fortunate he is that it’s the tallest of all piles. Sweat is dripping down his forehead, sliding down his temples and his palms are clammy. He struggles to grip on the vanity he climbs on top of. The flames are eagerly eating their way through the wood, seeking prey.
Once more, he couldn’t help it, he started to laugh.
It hadn’t always been like that. The friendship they established came from many nights of sharing stories. The first night came to be due to a little game of truth or dare. Harry didn’t want to play since he had so many war secrets that those who weren’t part of needed to be privy to. Ron had goaded him into it and cheered when he eventually gave in. What proceeded was one hour of awkward dares and tense truths. Harry, feeling the discomfort, did the only thing he felt he could do. He burst out in laughter. The rest of the group laughed with him, and the tension broke. The teenagers finally realising what they were – free from responsibilities, for once, and carried on with the game. The following day was lighter for them, and all the necessary apologies were uttered by dinner time.
“My apologies professor. It seems sixth year is taking a toll on my academics. I believe I am not wholly properly prepared for the workload. I am working on it, however.” He keeps his expression blank. No sense in showing that he wants to scream for help, no one can help him.
“My family has always used that florists. Shirley’s a skilled woman, so we’ve always trusted her.”
It seemed that wherever Harry was, Draco was soon to follow – if they weren’t already together, that is. As much as it bothered Harry, he found himself getting used to it. So used to it that he was scared to see how this attempt of restoring Draco’s emotions would go. He almost didn’t want to go back to ignoring each other. He wasn’t sure if this would be the one that would bring the old Draco back.
“He apologised to us.”
“I suppose I would have given in to what I wanted to do. I would have returned every single one of your hugs. I would have followed you around myself. I would have insisted on remaining by your side. I would have kept holding your hand. I would have given you some cheesy poetry about how angelic you look. I would have done that and so much more.”
’s the clumsy one, who mumbles through his words. Draco feels his lips graze against his neck and he feels his face redden.
want to know.
Of course, Harry could conjure the flowers. But what knowledge did Harry have about flower arrangements? He surmised it would be best to go to a professional. And since he didn’t want to be mobbed on this particular day, he settled for a local florist’s.
“Don’t play coy, it’s unbecoming of you.”
The game continued on until it landed on Draco. He stared into Blaise’s eyes, wondering what could happen if he chose truth, and knew it would be safer to choose dare. “Dare,” he declared, eyes widening only after when he caught Blaise’s eyes wander over to Harry.
Harry squeezed his nose bridge and closed his eyes. This was another thing on top of another thing that he truly didn’t want to deal with. Why was it always him and Malfoy?
He nodded and proceeded to tell them to turn to their textbooks. And so the rest of the class faded from Harry’s mind. He played with his quill and drew arrows all over his parchment with hearts floating around them. He attempted to draw a cherub, but it only resembled a marshmallow with wings and a strange nappy. He quickly crossed it out when he heard Ron laugh next to him.
“That’s not what I- I’m not coming onto you!! That’s - I… I would never! What the hell guys?”
The speaking test for his end of year assessment was later in the day and he had always practised with Hermione. It felt almost sacrilegious to not have her next to him. Revising together was practically a ritual at this point. Ever since year seven where they suffered under the tutelage of Monsieur Snape together — the bane of Harry’s existence who followed them into sixth from classes. Why their school only had one French teacher was beyond Harry.
“No, I’m stupidly expensive.” Draco deadpanned, but this smile he was trying to stop released itself. “Yeah, I’ll bite. Where do you want to talk?”
Harry grins and begins another story. A story he has been wanting to tell them since the relationship started. Only Draco beat him to it, “I was very angry at the start…”
*****
Harry grinned, “one of those word of the day things Hermione has on her desk. Now, answer my question.”
With that revelation, Harry is bombarded with images. He sees two boys running around, they look completely different to how Harry and Draco look. Yet, the way they interact is similar. Draco did dislike Harry, much like Patroclus did in the beginning because of jealousy. Harry does watch Draco like Achilles watched Patroclus. It’s fascinating to see how they maintained their behaviours despite the change in time.
Hermione’s grip in Ron’s hand tightens. He feels like doing the same, Malfoy had just called Harry by his name, and hadn’t Harry called him Draco earlier too? What is going on?
“Are you staying for the game?” He asked, taking one of the petit fours Draco had brought from the food table. “Mmm, raspberry.”
Harry looked up from tying his shoelaces. He probably misheard Ron, so he continued onto his left shoe.
“If you must go… go.”

Harry interrupts, “wait a second. You make it sound like your mother loved Sirius. Why did she order Kreacher to lie? Why did… Was she aware of it? Did she know–”
He turns to Ron, mouth opening to say something. But for once, it seems words have escaped him.
Harry shrugged, “I guess so.”
Before they left the room, Harry pulled Draco into a final hug. “Everything’s going to be alright. We’ll figure out what to do okay? I’ll take you outside okay?”
Once they reached the infirmary, Harry guided Draco to a bed and went to the office. He was familiar with the anti-bruising cream due to his continued injuries. He may not have been ace at Potions, but he could still read. He grabbed the one he needed, and the dittany – just in case – before returning to Draco’s side.
“I never realised how difficult such a decision would be.”

“What have you–”
“You promised. You promised.” Malfoy’s voice cracks, he sounds so downtrodden that Ron can’t help but feel bad for him.
“I dare you to kiss Harry.” The words
Harry thought he looked quite pretty. His light blond hair suited him perfectly. Harry wondered if it was as soft as he thought it would be. He rubbed his fingers, sorely tempted to reach across and touch his hair. But that was impolite right? If he was a stranger, it would be
“I can see the direction your thoughts are heading toward. Cease that at once. Harry’s the best thing that’s happened to me. If anything, he should be the one looking elsewhere. Nothing he can do wrong will ever push me away. Know that.”
Harry looked around the room, as if for guidance.
“Ta Wonwon.” Seamus winked at Ron, who blushed at the nickname of his regretful past. Thankfully Hermione wasn’t bitter about it and let out a small giggle before returning to her novel.
“You good?” Harry says, his lips brushing against the shell of Draco’s ear. He doesn’t speak, choosing instead to nod and take a deep breath.
were unspoken, yet obvious with how often the dare had been made. Draco still didn’t know who had spoken, but like hell he’d pass on this dare. This… This blessing! Yes, that’s what it was.
Draco feared that what he said would get back to father. Father wasn’t the most forgiving of men. Much less so to his own child. A child that should be perfect no matter what.
Pansy laughed, “indeed. There’s nothing wrong with it right?”
“Not if I can do something about it. C’mon Malfoy… Draco–” Draco looks up to the sound of his name on Harry’s lips, “tell me.” Harry’s eyes are pleading.
He cleared his throat, and Potter hardly reacted. Draco took this as a chance and leaned against the wall opposite Potter. He stood with his feet crossed at the ankles, and his arms crossed over. An entirely defensive stance and he acknowledged it. It was obvious after all. He refused to stare across him, he didn’t want to see the judgement in Potter’s eyes. That and he was scared he’d reveal too much and lose his nerve. He fiddled with his hands and started speaking when he was ready.
“Let’s go and have our own fun then. Since I’ve got mother’s approval.” Harry joked.
Harry bit his lip as he walked in, trying to blink back the tears. He thought of little Teddy, the bubbliest, loveliest little boy who had Harry’s heart in the palm of his hands. Perhaps there would be something in here that he could give to the boy, in memory of his father.
Dread floods through Draco, no. This can’t be what he thinks it is.
Wanting to prevent conflict, he timidly asks, “like the constellation?” Harry remembers reading about planets in year 5. Things like the Milkyway and galaxies far away. Places where his aunt and uncle don’t exist. Places he’d like to run off to. He’s grateful he’s found Hogwarts, it’s far, and he hopes it’s far enough.
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed away slightly, “that’s only something you’ve experienced. I’m pretty sure he would rather spit on the face of the Minister than offer me he–”
Harry watched Malfoy walk away. He finally let himself smile when Malfoy’s footsteps could no longer be heard. He pulled his walkman out and pressed play. Harry was going to reveal that he had heard everything, only Malfoy had retreated before he could. At least Harry knew Malfoy was being sincere. Six plus years of fighting wasn’t going to fade away like that. But if Malfoy was willing to try, then perhaps Harry should give him a chance.
As soon as the common room door closed, Harry pushed Draco up against the wall and resumed their earlier kiss. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and leaned down to deepen the kiss. Harry smiled, and Draco’s lips mimicked his.
Harry clicked the username (@draconis) and promptly choked on the biscuit in his mouth. He clocked the little rainbow flag in the bio and scrolled through.
“Yes… I too would like to hear how that started. You two were always too shy to open up about it to me.”
“I thought you said he was acting better?” Hermione asks, finally making her presence known. She isn’t looking at Harry, but rather in the direction Draco left in.
“I am no angel,” he says. Tilting his head from side to side, as if cracking the bones. “Completely different belief system, I’m afraid.”
“Are you finally back with the rest of us?” He asked, gently placing the glass on top of another coaster. His one seemed cleaner than the one Harry pried off his cheek. His tone suggested that he was very done with Harry, but surely he must have been a nice person if he had stayed by Harry’s side.
to ease his mind.
Draco gasped slightly at some of the elation leaving him. The pink haze he was under darkened into a red one. He pulled his hand back and kicked the table with his foot. He took his head into his hands and pulled at his hair. This worried Harry who rushed to pull his hands away, preventing him from hurting himself.

Harry visibly melts into Draco. He’s a second away from purring and Draco knows this.
“I’m going crazy.”
’. This time, he chose to kiss Draco on his forehead, not wanting Draco to beat him to it. There were only a few more places to kiss before it got… to a stage that Harry wasn’t keen on thinking about. Because it was something Harry had thought about (many a time), and the effects of firewhisky were causing the line to blur and in all honesty, Harry was getting scared.
“Draco... son. I need you to confirm something.” He looked at his father, his cheekbones prominent, eyelids tinted lavender, and hair stringy with grease. “Is this the Potter boy?”
’ which made Harry wonder if he was in a fever dream. Because never would he have thought Ron would willingly join in with this. Draco was also somewhat more intoxicated because Harry caught him looking at his lips as he neared for their fourth kiss. They were so close to kissing on the lips that Harry couldn’t help but close his eyes. Only, the peck to his nose made him giggle, an action Draco copied as he sat down. Harry was tempted to tell him to stay next to him since he knew that wouldn’t be the last kiss they would share. And with so few places left...
