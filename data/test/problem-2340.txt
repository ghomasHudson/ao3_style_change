Somehow he hadn't realized what would come after a war. The rebuilding he'd expected. It had only taken a week with the various volunteers, most of them past students, coming out to help fix Hogwarts, only one day of which Harry hadn't been able to attend. But the trials and the posing, the speculating and the theories, articles, books and more that came out of it all... Harry is so very tired.
It’s only made slightly difficult by the fact that Draco thinks he could be developing serious feelings for him.
Being hurt again definitely. Giving Draco the trust he is asking for, knowing that he’s hurt them both because he was scared before and not being sure that the blonde won’t do it again.
“I don’t think I could ever regret you.” Harry whispers and the rawness takes Draco’s breath away for a second.
“How about you just stick to your area of expertise and I’ll stick to mine! I seem to remember we work better apart anyway!”
Draco stutters as Harry obliges, looking up again so their eyes meet. He feels every bit of himself focus deliciously on the contact of Harry’s hand rubbing Draco’s moisture up and down over his cock, again and again. His breath stops for a moment and he looks at the piercing green of Harry’s eyes and the widened pupil, the blush-stained dark cheeks, and the way Harry is just looking at him like Draco is more fascinating than anything he’s ever seen in his entire life and-
"Oh." Harry had completely forgotten about that. Almost immediately after Malfoy had been declared innocent he'd hired an owl to deliver it back to Malfoy Manor. He'd never gotten a reply, and once it had been out of his sight it had been out of his mind as well. "Well, um. You're welcome, I suppose."
“Raunchy love letters!” Draco splutters at the same time that the fire turns green and his mother nods in satisfaction.
This entire night has felt precious and he’s trying to commit it to memory. Draco is waking up with the realization that now more than ever he trusts Harry. Trusts him enough to tell him about living with Voldemort and bare his heart and show him his
They sit quietly for a few seconds before Ginny turns to him. "I told you he was coming. You saw him at Blaise’s stag do. Was it really such a shock to see him again?"
No he needs absolute privacy. For a second he debates whether he should get Harry so they can see the answer together but immediately he shies away from the idea.
“Well if it’s up to me,” he turns back to Blaise easily, hiding his irritation and hurt. “Who did you have in mind?”
“I hate both of you.” Ron moans while still hiding his face. “Luna caught me off guard, alright? What was I meant to say?” As their shaking increases he makes a tortured sound. “Hermione you’re my only friend.”
“At least we did make it.” Ginny says. “It makes it all feel a bit more worth it, doesn’t it? To see how everything’s changed. I mean,” she blushes slightly at all the looks they throw her. “I can’t be the only ones who’s noticed the First Years? Groups of friends that include all four of the Houses? Slytherins and Gryffindors being best friends?”
The knowledge doesn’t ease his nerves. His palms sweat and he surreptitiously puts them behind his back to wipe on his robes.
He looks like a teenager, trying to do well in school and keep his head down. Like a boy who, Harry is starting to suspect, takes notes in Potions just in case Harry doesn't pay attention and ends up needing them, because Malfoy doesn't seem to ever look back and use them at all.
Draco looks at the picture a moment longer, at the way Harry's hands rake through the strange man's hair, and then he pulls open a drawer in his desk and offhandedly throws the paper into it, not wanting to see anymore. He closes the drawer firmly.
Harry’s expression seems broken open to reveal his wavering uncertainty. “That’s why I don’t think a few friends is enough. Pansy, Ron and Hermione knowing… what difference will that make to a situation like today? I would do anything for you.” Harry says fiercely. “Anything. And the hiding isn’t just hurting me or our relationship, it’s hurting you too. And I hate seeing that and all the while knowing we could fix it.”
She shrugs at him, but the worry has left her eyes and she looks happier than she did a second ago. "It could be worse."
you.” Draco says and it’s a whisper, barely a breath, but it’s enough for Harry to hear and his eyes widen as his heart misses a beat. It sounds like it’s been wrenched out of him, a confession of the worst and most personal kind, one that gives Harry all the power to break him with his answer.
It’s stupid things, simple things. things that nobody else probably even notices. Things like the way Draco eats fruit or a simple muffin for breakfast because he’s never particularly hungry in the hours immediately after waking up, a fact that Harry stores away and takes pains to remember. Draco expands his Shield Charms to encompass their entire friend group just in case some arsehole is feeling particularly stupid that day and begging for almost half of the Eighth Years to come down on them in Draco’s defense.
Harry rolls back onto his side to meet his stare. He thinks about his next question before deciding to finally just ask it. “What was it like? Him staying there with you.”
“If you go slow it should be fine.” Draco answers and Harry nods, head falling as both of them watch him slowly push his hips forwards.
Harry doesn’t want to return that kindness with lies so he looks down at the grass. There’s a beetle crawling through it and he watches it for a moment before he finally answers, “Not really, no.”
“It’s good of you,” Harry says eventually right before they get to the Common Room. “To visit her like that.”
Draco can’t help but notice eventually that even with their physical proximity and the heat of his room Harry’s skin is slightly cold.
"I made a few friends down there too, in the cellars. Other prisoners, you see. Like Mr. Ollivander." Luna shudders, voice lilting a bit. "They were much worse off than I was. Particularly Ollivander as he's quite a bit older than I am, you know."
Coming back to the Common Room last night his heart had been pounding like mad in his chest. Even beneath the invisibility cloak he’d been scared someone would catch him out in the school halls so late or hear his footsteps on the stone.
“Um.” Harry swallows. “Sorry to interrupt but Blaise would you mind turning around so I can get dressed?”
So. Being together is still nonnegotiable. Staying out of each other’s lives didn’t work. What does that leave them?
“We changed because of the war.” Harry says, repeating the tired phrase he’s given countless reporters and strangers over the summer.
"Ginny's off telling Hermione, Ron and him right now, actually. I was going to visit Pansy, Millie and Nott next. Whoever was out first is going to call in on Luna and Neville." Blaise hesitates. "I don't know whether she'll invite him... She knows I was inviting you. But as Ron and Hermione are there..."
“I thought all Slytherins were…. Like them.” The Saviour gestures vaguely and Draco feels a rush of affection. “But you… you’re not, are you?”
“Christ,” the Muggle expression slips out before Draco can stop it. He blames it on his newfound friendship with Ron.
He thinks Potter almost shoots him an appreciative look after a few minutes pass but Draco's too busy concentrating on the new notes going up to really know for sure.
It’s well past three in the morning when he gets home and he stops in surprise to find a bottle of his favourite firewhiskey along with a note sitting in front of his bedroom door in the Manor.
His friends worry. Harry knows they do. He sees the way they stop whispering when he comes near them sometimes, and with each new incident at the hospital Hermione's eyes grow darker and darker from concern.
“I know I could have gotten you a gold cauldron or something, but I thought… well, I figured no one else would get you this.”
“Draco, dear.” Pansy gestures to the bottle, lying innocently on the floor, and Draco glances around quickly before moving to bend forward and spin the bottle. His hand flexes right before he turns it and for a second Harry thinks Draco is almost nervous.
A Slytherin knows how to pick his battles, and Blaise is no exception. He also knows when Draco's being a git, and when he's likely to stop.
One drawer of his dresser was practically ransacked from where he’d rummaged through it to find an old Slytherin tie, which was now laying in a crumpled heap on one side of the bed from where Harry had fallen asleep gripping it tightly.
Their movements build slowly, so slowly it borders on torturous. Harry’s hair feels silken, and every time Draco tilts his head just a little bit this way or that it sends new shivers up his spine. Harry keeps moving his hands across Draco’s back, and even through the robes his body heat warms him up.
Draco's face drains of what little colour it has and his eyes widen at Harry slightly. He doesn't look away, their eyes are locked, even when everybody else in the room turns to look at Draco as well.
Finally, after what seems far too long, they reach the living room. It has blue wallpaper with silver designs and two couches, a love seat and an armchair in front of the large fireplace. A coffee table sits by one of the couches.
and so far, I’m not angry at you anymore. But I understand if you blame me and can’t look at me without remembering everything.”
“I thought so. And please know I am harbouring no illusions that the two of you have an undying love for education,” Harry frowns at her words, “but I would always regret it if I never bothered to ask.”
“This. Us avoiding each other.” Colour rushes back into Draco’s face immediately. “It’s not helping anything and I’ve been miserable.” Harry takes a deep breath. “I miss you.”
Harry shrugs. “It’s up to you. I’ll find somebody else.” He finally meets Draco’s gaze again. “But you are the best in this area that we know of. And you know half the witches and wizards on the case already. You’d be helping a lot of people.” He hesitates. “I would like it to be you.”
Draco’s not sure what to expect from his time back home, and he’s not willing to admit to anyone besides himself that he’s a bit nervous to be there, but it certainly isn’t his mother wandering around and humming.
Keller glares at him and takes the letters in his big meaty hand. “They get to you when they get to you.”
“Always sticking up for the underdog, Ron.” Harry nods, taking a small sip of juice to hide his grin.
“You did. You said it yourself: you undoubtedly have feelings for him. That means you want to be with him, which means-”
Alright here is the Manor visit, finally. This chapter is a bit longer because I seem to be completely unable to stay consistent! Also next week's update might be a bit late since I'm getting back from a weekend holiday on Wednesday and don't know if I'll have time to post. It will be done Thursday at the latest!
The tension comes back quickly and Draco grows somber again. “That’s how it felt though. Like there was only one choice for me.”
A few startled laughs escape various audience members, but mostly it’s sniffles Draco hears as Ginny gives Blaise a brave smile and begins.
“Tell me if you want me to stop, alright?” Draco leans down to gently kiss him. “We’re not going to do… that. But I’d like to get you off.”
It comes out more vulnerable than he likes and instantly he closes off his expression, trying to regain some composure. But the realization that all this time since Hogwarts has been needlessly spent apart from Draco- that someone has messed them both about and caused so much pain- is a crushing one.
Merlin, is this what it had been like for all of them all this time? He remembers Skeeter scuttling around during the Triwizard Tournament, but he hadn’t cared about Ron, Hermione or Harry’s discomfort back then. In fact he’d relished in it, knowing that he helped cause it.
“I was giving him his Secret Santa gift.” Draco answers finally, staring up at them both and feeling remarkably overwhelmed as they loom overhead.
Draco shifts a bit. “Yeah. I never met her before- well. Mum fell out with Andromeda for good before I was born. They’re speaking now again though. I practically forced Mum to owl her.”
“They know each other a bit. Or at least know of each other. Besides, everyone finds something to talk to Harry about.”
“He hated your father.” Draco blurts without meaning to and then tries to fix it. “Erm, he got upset about it once to me. I was complaining about you and Lupin, I think? Something stupid in Third Year, I don’t know. He said you were no better than your father and that Lupin had always been… um. Anyway.”
Draco swallows. “Just give me time.” He repeats and then he’s turning and hurrying away from Harry, ignoring the sound of him calling his name.
There’s an anticipatory silence until Potter breaks it by clearing his throat and glancing up again before looking back down at the textbook. “So. Cars.”
His mother flushes. “Whatever else you believe about me, know that when it comes to my son I only want the best for him.
be true. I know my Dad could be an arse and that- that sometimes my Mum hung around the wrong people.”
Harry had glanced at Malfoy, wondering if it had been him, but noticed he wasn't paying attention. Instead he'd been eating silently by himself. In fact, anytime Harry has glanced at Malfoy since arriving back at Hogwarts, the other wizard has been alone.
When the mail comes in he’s not really expecting anything. He usually talks to his mother once a week and had received an unanswered letter from her on Friday so there’s nothing expected. His mail is being closely monitored to stop any illegal correspondence he may do (which, fair enough) but he suspects it amounts to the Ministry workers mostly stopping Howlers and hate mail from coming his way rather than any connives leaving his end.
He notices Draco’s lips twitch and can’t help it when he gestures to Ron and Hermione and snaps at the blonde, “Oh, like you want to hear about their sex life.”
“But this thing with Harry,” Draco slips without noticing, though his mother’s sharp eyes and ears pick up on it, of course. “I’m not taking advantage- I’m not
“No. Stop.” Draco shakes his head and holds up a hand to stop him. “I need you to seriously think about this. Think about what will happen. I’m hated, Harry. Really honest-to-Merlin
“I will not make a fool of myself alone, thank you very much. If you’re with me it make might the whole thing slightly more bearable.”
“Circe’s tits, Millie, you get that one.” Blaise says. “I would too if we were playing honestly. Just because you lot are sore losers…”
Harry shakes his head, his hair fringe falling nearly his eyes. Mrs. Weasley or someone needs to cut that. “I said you looked awful. There’s a difference.”
The first week had been the worst, or at least that's what he tells himself. No trials, no mail, but endless funerals and grieving families. The Ministry had declared the day after the battle a day for grieving, and practically the entirety of the European wizarding world had stopped and stayed still for that single day.
Draco takes a shuddering breath, eyes closing for seconds before they slowly open again. "It was real. What we had. I…
Harry blinks blearily but pushes back hungrily against Draco’s lips. Eventually Draco grabs his wand to clean them both up, murmuring a cleaning spell.
Blaise looks away from where he’s been watching the Gryffindor table. When Draco follows the gaze he sees Potter deep in conversation with the Weaselette and his stomach sours.
But short of losing his parents, there’s nothing he can think of that scares him anymore. Because if the alternative is to lose Harry…
More than anything though it’s Draco’s face and posture. He’s in a relaxed stance, hands in his trouser pockets, one knee slightly bent as he stands and looks at Harry like he can’t believe he’s really there.
Draco groans quietly and flips through the textbook, looking at the picture of an automobile that he'd seen earlier at lunch. He's tried to read ahead so he'll have at least some idea of what the things Professor Marylton talks about are but he finds himself completely lost.
“Which is fine.” Potter says. “I know we’re not really friends anyway. It’s alright, I get it. I was just wondering if you were interested. You obviously are, so it’s fine.”
“Stop. Too much.” He stills Draco’s hips and pulls out completely, making Draco mewl before he can catch himself.
It takes a few more seconds but finally Draco sighs. “Merlin, help me,” Harry hears him mutter but he ignores it.
“Distantly,” Draco says, “but yes. We are.” At Harry’s raised eyebrow he rolls his eyes. “Please. I’ve had to know my family tree since I was three.” His grin turns wry. “You don’t know how much torture it was all these years to know I shared some small part of my DNA with Ron.”
Draco doesn't flinch, but it's a near thing. He sighs to hide the way his breathing becomes a tell. "Don't be stupid." He says softly, trying to inject pity in his voice. "What, did you think one year of fucking could erase seven years of hatred? You think I could ever want to be with you?" Draco takes in a deep breath and goes all in, hating himself with every bit of his being as he does. "You're damaged goods, Potter. The war changed you, you've lost too much, and honestly I don't know how anybody could love you. Those Muggles you lived with? I think they had it right. I don't think you belong anywhere."
“And the thing is I don’t really know how to feel either. Or what I think.” Harry frowns. “I’m a bit… numb.”
Still, Draco thinks back to his conversation with Pansy after the Halloween party, and what she’d said about Blaise and Ginny then. Maybe she’d already figured it out.
“Stop.” He interrupts the two women. “We’ll find out who it is and I’d like to talk to them. Then we can decide whether to tell the Ministry about it.”
His eyes are still damp and his throat feels swollen closed, but he's a bit calmer knowing his friends are going to be there for him.
He does feel the absence of his mother at his side keenly however and laments the fact that he has to board the Hogwarts Express alone. He’s never come here without his family before, and where last time he’d missed Father, this time he misses both of his parents acutely.
“Show me.” She repeats and he slowly walks over to the bottom left-hand drawer of his desk, the only one that’s locked.  He opens it and ignores the sight of a three-year-old muggle sweater, scraps of paper that have scrawled handwriting on it, ignores old photos and receipts to take out the two pieces of parchment.
The statue is simple too, like the church, but Draco still feels his breath catch. The sight of Lily and James Potter standing in front of them, even in stone, seems a precious, fragile thing and Draco’s eyes fell on the sculpted baby nestled between them in their arms.
“How does he look at me?” Draco’s voice is too sharp, he’s too desperate for the answer and scared of what it will be.
They’re so near to one another that Draco feels Harry’s breath fan across his face and his eyes flutter when he moves forward to close the gap.
-only for the Snitch to dash away, quicker than a blink. Harry curses, bringing his broom around in a sharp turn but it’s too late, Draco is already ahead of him and quickly gaining on the little flying ball. Still, Harry has to try, and as Draco follows the Snitch around the edges of the pitch he makes it to the blonde’s elbow.
“My parents were Muggles you know. I was killed for being Muggle-born. And then when I learned what had happened to Dumbledore and the others at the end of that year, and that it was your fault, I had to pretend I hadn’t helped comfort you all year and encouraged you to do it!”
Pansy’s eyes are narrowed. “Are you sure? I can tell you right now that none of us want a repeat of any of that.”
Harry lets himself be manhandled into having one forearm pressing against the wall, parallel to the floor, and he leans against it, knees already shaking.
I’m delighted to learn of your and Harry Potter’s engagement. Taking the marvellous House of Black pocket watch into consideration that adorned your betrothed, my dear Draco, I do see that my consent will not be needed. I dare to assume that the reason why neither you nor your fiancé discussed the matter with me beforehand, is due to the fact that you had no chance to contact me about such an urgent matter. Especially after such dark times, I understand that love cannot wait.
I saw through your eyes, my love, and felt every one of your senses. You were young, seven, perhaps eight and you felt freedom. So much freedom and delight. I knew without needing to be told that you’d finished your tutoring for the day – far earlier than expected – and that suddenly, surprisingly, your time was your own.
If you are worried about Mother, let me tell you something. We’re both wizards. Your paternal line had been cast out of the Sacred Wizarding Families. Your mum is Muggleborn. New money, for Salazar’s sake! And again, we’re both wizards. I think Mother won’t be picky about the details of the bonding ceremony. You aren’t exactly a candidate who she’d expect to follow any traditional etiquette.
I can’t wait for you to come back, and at the same time I hope that you’re seeing and practising everything that you’re so eager to learn.
I love you. I bloody adore you, but you haven’t spoken to me in three days. I know I told Hermione that I wouldn’t chase you but here I am. I can’t help it.
Draco, I had to hold myself so still, and so controlled, because I’d have groaned aloud otherwise. I'd have drawn everybody's attention onto us. There wasn’t any mistaking your erection frotting against my bum, either. The friction of it felt fantastic, and I had to physically restrain myself from rolling my arse cheeks over your prick.
And you might think you can get away with everything. Sitting there in all your splendour with your gleaming eyes – which can be the moss colour you mentioned, but also pine or emerald, even jade at times, it really depends on the light – and your crooked smile. It’s very Slytherin to divert my studious self like that. At least we made it through the better part of the chapter we were supposed to read. Based on the time we rather spent with stifled smiles and accidental arm-brushing, I assume, we can both be proud.
“That’s why you're going,” Glynis said. She sounded outraged when Mother didn’t react at first. “In dear Rovena’s name, don’t look at me like the heavens came down. Don’t you remember how close you used to be? Don’t you remember what you said about her and Edward Tonks?”
But you took care of that. You put just the tiniest space between us, shuffling around a bit, until you could reach for my prick and jerk me so teasingly lightly with just two or three fingers loosely circled around my erection. And you slanted your face, looking at me so fervently and hazy, your face so open and vulnerable without your glasses… I kissed you, slow and hot, licking over your bottom lip several times before I leant in to kiss you properly. By then I felt you wanking my prick against your arse, tip against your skin, and in my mind all I could think about was pushing forward.
Do you realise, my darling boy, that we’ve been together for only about two years? Okay, it depends on how you count. If we include that phase we dated anonymously – Circe, but how that sounds! – or whether you start with January ‘99. To me it feels like we’ve shared a whole life. You’re such an integral part of me that I can’t imagine how I did without you. How lonely I was! How much I had to keep all the things running through my head to myself!
I’ve been thinking about what my MH said ever since, Draco. It made sense to me, in a weird kind of way. Even though I can scarcely believe it to be true, I did all those heroic actions. Fought dragons. The glittering git the world adores.
So, all I’m going to say to you is that I’ll always be here to listen, should you want to talk. Or vent. You could even power out some rage, in quite a physical sense. I won’t break and as long as we don’t throw punches at each other, I’m down for some tussle. In or out of bed, that’s up to you.
Back to the serious talk. I like the way you phrased it: I enjoy what is growing between us too. I also think that we’ll know when it’s time to get closer, physically speaking. I’d be lying to say that I didn’t think about kissing you yesterday when you sat next to me and stared at my face or my hands instead of the textbook. It just didn’t feel right to do it so un-privately. There wasn’t anyone around, but it still felt so public somehow.
Magic is viewed by the Muggles and in the mind of some power-hungry fools, as a force to be mastered and controlled. It can’t be, though. Magic is a force unto itself. You and I are wizards, powerful ones at that, but we can’t harness magic. All items like athames and horcruxes show the futility of ever trying to dominate magic.
You left me sitting with my pitiful wilting cock, half undressed in a dorm that wasn’t my own. All I could think – all I do think – is that you thought I was some pathetic little kid, unable to stop myself spunking at the least incitement. When you eventually came back your face was shuttered and cold. You wouldn’t meet my eyes. All you could say was that you were tired, that it’d been a long day. It wasn’t six yet, Draco! You showed me the door and pretty much pushed me out of it.
I extinguished the fire so that you could try. “You need to command it,” I supplied, but you already had your eyes locked on the fireplace. I also saw your hand move and had the words “you little cheat” on the tip of my tongue. But I didn’t get to speak them aloud.
You surely know what happened then. He hummed and hawed and in the end told me to come and see him during office hours in a fortnight. He’s putting together some information about the legal boundaries – which potions one can brew and sell for a profit without breaking one or the other regulation, how and where to register such a business, the hygiene and safety requirements for the laboratory, and so on and so on.
The thing is – and this is very difficult for me to explain – sharing my body and letting another person into the confines of my skin would be a sacrosanct act of faith for me. I couldn’t do that easily or lightly.
Darling, I had such a good time. Flirting. Talking. Kissing. Our friends had ordered for us – the menu in the Broomsticks is pretty minuscule, I’ll give you that – and before long, our fish and chips were in front of us and the two of us dug in. I hadn’t realised just how famished I actually was. It was only as we were pushing our plates away and draining the last of the Butterbeer from our glasses that Ron made his announcement.
You wrote that you wished to bring your fiancé to share dinner with the pair of us, and I would like to confirm that both myself and Edward would be very happy to make his acquaintance, especially as we are to be considered kin.
The topic of the day is, of course, Dean and Seamus. I have to admit, I’m a little impressed by the two of us. We’re an incorrigible pair of cupids, and it would seem from what you told me earlier that you’ve pulled Ron and Hermione into the conspiracy too.
Meet me after school, exactly where we met yesterday. I’ve got that bloody DADA tutoring, and I know you’ve got that Alchemy instruction with Slughorn, but it won’t matter if you’re a few minutes late. I want to give you your Christmas gift. Well, maybe gift isn’t the right word for it. It’s – well, you’ll see what I mean when you meet me.
Yet, I do not feel that your reputations have been too much besmirched, particularly as I have seen other, later reports of your wearing of a betrothal ring. Do be sure to wear it when you attend, Harry dear, for I would very much like to see it. Your making such a good, committed match whilst still so youthful does my heart good. I cannot abide this Muggle-esque trend of waiting years upon end.
The two of us ate our sandwiches and drank our Coca-Colas and we felt quite at peace with the world. The Muggles around us read their novels, played football with their children, all of them in pure innocence that their country had nearly succumbed to disaster. Truthfully, Draco, as we sat there, I could hardly believe it to be true either.
“Sausages first,” I said, nodding to the pan. “They’ll take longer to cook, and we don’t want them pink and raw in the middle.”
I promise, you’ll despair of me, but I’ll be entirely unrepentant. I’ll make it up to you with kisses and you won’t be able to resist smiling.
“That’s alright,” I said, laughing, as I closed every inch of space between us. “I'll do the cooking, lovely. You have other, far more spectacular, talents.”
I’d hoped to come out of this year with a reasonable clutch of qualifications and my sanity in reasonable shape. Never, even in my wildest dreams, did I expect to come out of it with you, Draco. There’s this Muggle song – I’ll play it for you, one of these days, and the lyrics are as follows:
When people around us gasped and started whispering, all you did was indeed remembering to compliment my bloody hair, like the perfectly sappy and adorable boyfriend that you are.
Merlin, your mother is a tricky one, to say the very least. If I’d ever once imagined what a potential Mother-in-Law might have been like (I didn’t) she wouldn’t necessarily have taken the form of Narcissa Malfoy.
My darling. You kept your face very schooled as you so often do, but I think that you were as pleased as I was by Hermione’s idea. You nodded your agreement and gave me one of your small special smiles. You gave my hand a brief squeeze. I felt very, very loved.
You’re going to need to be decent at potions, because when you’re making house calls to clients, and visiting the businesses that you’re trading with, you’re going to be the face of your business. Oh, Draco. I’m trying not to get too excited but I feel like it might be a losing battle. If what Mulvaney said today was right – and why wouldn’t it be, that’s his bloody job! – then I see your future beginning to open up. I can see tiny splinters of light. Sorry. I’m grinning like a total prat. You are too, darling. Just a tiny little curl at the edges of your mouth. It is terribly handsome.
But the moment I spread my legs further, I seemed to have set you into motion. I watched you coat your prick with lube, and then you settled atop of me and guided your prick against my entrance.
So I read my notes and started the rant: “Sometimes my thoughts are directed at something dark, and my mind just starts spiralling down, adding to my guilt with bad memories and reasons why I don’t deserve any better. Just an ambiguous comment from someone who didn’t mean harm might start this off. Other times I feel like I should worry, like those last few days about Mother, but no sinister thought crosses my mind. Not one. It’s ridiculous.” That’s what I told him. I went on to name a few examples then, mainly of the last few days.
None of us have any control over the form of our Patronus; they’re a representation of our fundamental magical selves. There isn’t a witch or wizard on the face of the earth that could try and argue that you didn’t have the truest, most pure of intentions towards me after seeing our matching Patronus in the DADA classroom yesterday, love. You can’t fake magic like that. It comes from inside the soul. Professor Lupin taught me that much. A corporeal Patronus is the personification of goodness and light, and that, my sweet Draco, is the reason that it alone can vanquish a Dementor.
You moaned, low in your throat, as we broke our kiss. “I’ve been wanting to do that all day.” You dipped your head, kissing a soft line down the contours of my throat. “And it looks like my clever words worked a charm,” you added, rolling your hips against my own. We were both in our thin school pyjamas, and our hard pricks rubbed against one another’s. We were all love, and excitement, and the frisson of tension that coils between us both. “You’ve got a bit of a competency kink, Potter.”
Please tell me how and where you’ll spend your hols, love. I can’t abide the idea of you being alone for too long. Especially during days many people spend time with their families. Do you celebrate Christmas or Yule? Or both? I don’t have much of a clue in which ways Yule and Christmas differ. I know that most wixen prefer to celebrate Christmas these days, but my family was very traditional in that.
And also, Legilimency is sometimes used in Mind Healing, isn’t it? As a method of therapy? So, of course we’d only be very foresightful and studious, should we find ourselves in the Room with our wands in hand later today. Don’t punch me for this ghastly double entendre.
I’m sorry that my letter ended a little abruptly last night. I’d meant it to be a perfectly scribed, perfectly written reply but I’m afraid that my fantasies overtook me a little. Before I knew it, I was reaching down into my pyjama bottoms. I touched myself thinking about you. I couldn’t help myself.
Me saying he’s a hero probably proves you right. The Saviour will always be the Saviour. I can see why you feel sorry for him. I don’t know whether you paid him any attention at the beginning of the term, but first he looked like he’d come back a ghost. Then I’ve seen him in Defence once, one of the first classes we had. And something inside him just fucking snapped when there was a stray spell almost hitting Granger. Think he might have been on the verge of a panic attack then. Looks like time might heal some wounds though. He doesn’t look quite as haunted anymore.

So when I met Ron and had a chance to hear him out, I’d like to see you and study until (or past) curfew. I just want to be by your side. Think I can come to the Gryffindor common room again? I would let you into the dungeons but I’m rather sure that my fellow housemates won’t be too happy about that. You know about the strict Slytherin-only-policies.
Circe. I can't imagine what you're thinking, as I read these words back. It hasn’t taken much for my thoughts to circle back to sex. Truth is, I’m enjoying this non-Ball more than you could know and my belly is filled with sensual heat.
Then – and this part really made me blush – Nev said that the bond doesn’t ‘take’ until consummate it? That you’re sent up to bed to complete the rite while the rest of the party chant spells to encourage the magic to work entirely? Have you been to weddings like this one, love? Does it all seem odd or uncomfortable when the couple are dispatched to make love? I’ll do it – I’ll do anything that you, or your mother want – but you might need to give me a bit of direction. This is all very new to me.
I heard you hitch a breath, and it felt as if the air in the room was suddenly thick and heavy. Oh, my darling. You looked like a dragon caught in a cage, wary and trapped, and you shook your head.
“We’re s’posed to talk now,” Harry noted rather distantly as Draco ran a hand through his rat’s nest of curls. “About… stuff.”
As he sat up and opened his eyes, he was greeted by the absolutely heady image of Draco Malfoy’s head bobbing up and down on his length, sucking Harry like he was born to it. Those impeccable pureblood manners of his seemed to have flown right out the window— Draco looked filthy and wanton with his pale throat stretched open, and he gagged ever so slightly as he choked himself on Harry’s (admittedly large) alpha cock.
That was certainly a topic Harry wanted to discuss at length— he put a mental pin in it, hoping he’d be able to retrieve it after Draco and his rut had wrung him dry.
K so harry is like, a little violent for like 2 seconds in this chapter? Idk, I personally think it's as mild as it gets, but if you think it could be an issue for you, skip down until you see the three stars :)
Really, Harry should have seen it coming. On some level, he knew it was wrong— wrong, wrong, wrong for him to let himself agree to spending his rut with Draco, to allow Draco to agree to it when he didn't fully understand what he was agreeing to— but to have it thrown in his face by his best friend was painful in a way he hadn't anticipated.
“Fuck the papers,” Hary murmured, hands roaming as he mentally added ‘and fuck Robards, the Aurors, the mission, and everyone and everything else too’. “You make me happy, Draco. I want to give us a shot, and if the only thing concerning you is the opinions of the gossip columns, then I say we treat them like mushrooms and give this a shot.”
By the end of his rut, Harry was ready to thank every Slytherin he knew for their filthy sex games at Howgarts— a week after that fateful weekend, he was more hickey than human, and Draco had taxed every one of his muscles with seemingly endless impossible positions. Along the way, Harry had learned a great many things, and not all of them were of a sexual nature (though sexual lessons did take up quite a bit of their time). For example, he learned that Draco took his coffee black with honey, and that despite his prickly Malfoy exterior, Draco could be quite sweet when he wanted to be, rubbing soothing potions into Harry’s skin after he’d been pushed to his limit. He also learned that Draco was actually quite brilliant, and showed quite an aptitude for magical theory, even if his pillow talk was somewhat too academic— and, perhaps most interestingly, he found that Draco had a gift.
“I hate to break it to you, Saint Potter, but I gave as good as I got,” he smirked, eyes raking over Harry’s form. “And you haven’t left a single mark on me that I didn’t want you to leave.”
“My, you taste lovely,” Draco purred, his teeth scraping across the lobe of Harry’s ear. “I wonder— would you last if I sucked your cock now, or would you blow your load before you ever got near my arse?”
Exhaustion washed over Harry as soon as his orgasm left him— he wanted to say something, anything to Draco with his newfound clarity, but he found himself drifting off, lulled by Draco’s breathing and the wine-sweet scent of omega. There would be time, surely, upon waking, to talk. Harry just needed a little rest, a small respite, and then he could talk, have a conversation. Just a small nap, that was all.
Draco laughed— genuinely laughed, Merlin, what a laugh— and nipped playfully at Harry’s chest. “Scared, Potter?”
Oh, this omega was perfect— his scent was tart like wine, but twice as sweet, and the alpha in Harry growled his approval, pinning Malfoy fast against the bricks of the fireplace with a sickening crack. He struggled, trying to get away, but Harry was too strong.
“Of what you could do to me? Certainly,” he chuckled, kissing Draco’s forehead. “You’re a force of nature, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry heard Malfoy rather distantly, but his eyes were fixated on Malfoy’s lips, and the way they moved to shape the words he spoke. Instead of answering, Harry slid a hand up to cup Malfoy’s jaw and kissed him possessively— that must have been answer enough for Malfoy, because the omega kissed him back with fervor and ferocity.
“Potter, this is ridiculous, that hurt a bit and you need to get off of me and take me to a proper bed—”
“I never minded,” Draco replied, voice shaky as Harry palmed his cock and played lightly at one of Draco’s nipples with his tongue. “You were only doing what you had to. I never dared hope that I would outlive the war— a few scars are nothing.”
Draco’s voice cut straight through his panic. “Could you stop having a crisis while I’ve got my hand on your knob? It’s a bit off-putting.”
Another thing Harry had learned was that Draco loved to be praised. He practically glowed any time Harry gave him a compliment, and now was no exception.
“Oh good, you’re awake,” Draco rasped after pulling off with a wet pop. “Are you going to try and kill me again, or was that a first-day sort of thing?”
His restraint in the short while he waited was impeccable— but the moment Harry's Floo flared, he pounced.
It was exactly as he feared it would be—the urges, the need to claim, to take, and take and take…  it was all so strong, just like always. Yesterday night, he'd Floo-called Hermoine in a panic just thinking about how awful it would be— he was terrified by the idea of spinning out of control during his hormonal frenzy and accidentally hurting Draco, in the event that the omega still decided to show up. Regardless of Draco's incredible display of power earlier in the week, Harry was still a danger to himself and to others when he was… like that. He could strangle Draco by accident. Or rip out his throat on purpose. He could take Draco farther than he wanted to go and keep him longer than he wanted to stay, and the mere thought of it was enough to make Harry sick— so yes, he called Hermoine, hoping to get some comfort or encouragement or anything to stop the roiling in his gut.
Buttons flew as Harry ripped the shirt open, exposing the smooth expanse of Draco’s chest to Grimmauld’s chilly air. Immediately, the pink, puckered scars from Sectumsempra so long ago caught Harry’s eye, and sick, heady fascination filled his chest, bubbling up through his throat and filling his mouth with the awful taste of arousal and regret. His fingers traced the lines of the old lacerations, then pressed into them, and Draco gasped as Harry’s other hand found his erection, straining hard against those expensive black slacks.
Tbh this was supposed to be a one-shot prequel to the main event (the second work in the series) but. uhm. Things didn't go to plan. So now I have Lots Of Words for you guys! I hope yall enjoy 😁😁❤
Harry’s mouth was absolutely dry, and his voice seemed to have left him, so he did the only thing he could think of to respond— he sat up and kissed Draco soundly on the mouth, his hands resting on either side of Draco’s face.
Around the third day of Harry’s rut, Draco had asked him for permission to experiment a bit. At first, Harry had refused, but upon hearing Draco’s explanation, he decided (against his better judgement) to allow it. What Draco proposed— allowing Harry to fly off the chain a bit in order to see if a fluctuation in Draco’s pheromones could reign him back in— was lunacy. It was positively mad, risking himself like that, but somehow, it actually worked. Well, according to Draco it did. Harry had been too far gone into rut to remember it, but according to the devious omega, Harry had turned downright docile after Draco did his wonky pheromone thing, enganging them in what Draco termed the “most gentle, sensual rut-fuck” of his life.
“You’ll never want to shower alone after I get finished with you,” Draco promised as he dismounted Harry’s thighs, pulling the alpha along with him. “I’ll show you exactly what we Slytherins did in the dungeons while you Gryffindores were sleeping in your beds like prudes.”
And now… now that Harry was in rut, and the anger, the lust, the need was starting to cloud his judgement, there was nothing to tether him to that selflessness, to anchor him to his morals and principles. No, there was only the blazing heat of his skin and the desire to take, use, destroy— today, Harry would have what he wanted, and he wouldn't take no for an answer. In fact, before he was quite conscious of his own actions, he'd scratched out a note on parchment and attached it to Penny's leg sending her off to find Draco, who would hopefully recognize the invitation for what it truly was.
Quite against his will, Harry let out a whine, and Draco laughed— not mockingly, but instead, perhaps, genuinely joyful. All laughter was over, however, when Draco’s back hit the mattress, and Harry’s eyes raked over Draco’s form, lucid enough for the first time in their encounter to really appreciate the view.
Merlin, but Malfoy— no, Draco— could kiss. Just a few brushes of their lips and Harry felt hot and desperate, needy in a way that he couldn’t recall ever feeling before. He was hard, so hard, and when Draco’s teeth grazed his lips, he was almost afraid of popping his knot in his denims. The only thing that stopped him from doing so was the infuriating lack of contact that Draco was somehow maintaining, and the brilliant scent of omega arousal, serving to calm and focus Harry’s energy on what would eventually relieve the pressure, the need burning inside him.
“Are you seriously rejecting me because you’re worried about my reputation?” Harry couldn’t help himself— a little laughter bubbled up in his chest and he let it out, much to Draco’s dismay. “That might be the sweetest, most selfless thing you’ve done recently.”
Darkness swept over Draco’s expression like a thundercloud. “This isn’t funny. I’m serious, Harry, I— I couldn’t bear it. They’d never let us have any peace. It would drive you away and out of my life and I won’t— I can’t— it would be too much.”
“Potter, your listening comprehension skills are fucking abysmal,” Draco growled, but Harry ignored his protesting and pulled him into a brusing kiss.
Draco slid his hands down the back of Harry’s jeans to grab his arse and grind them together, and that was the end of that.
"But why?" Harry had asked, despite already knowing the answer, hoping against hope that she would say something, anything else. "If the feelings are there, why should anything else matter? I really— I really care for him, 'Mione."
“Hm, maybe. ‘M not in a hurry to find out though,” Harry chuckled, shamelessly grabbing a handful of Draco’s ass. “Knowing you, you’d use it to every advantage you could if it worked.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “To the best of my ability, I suppose. Though I’ll miss out on having you on my arm to snog at will at Ministry functions.”
“I don’t play well with others,” Harry admitted, reddening a bit at how much of a boneheaded alpha he sounded like. “So, I would like— if you wanted— to, erm date you. Exclusively, I mean. If that’s okay. And I’d like to at least tell our friends, those we trust, that sort of thing. Sound alright?”
Draco was dressed in a lovely silk shirt, clearly Muggle, but somehow charmed to be the impossible shade of the midnight sky, rolling and shining as Draco shifted onto his elbows to look at Harry. It was a lovely color, truly, one that brought out the starlight-silver in the gray of Draco’s eyes and the pulsing blue of his veins— no doubt, that piece alone was worth more than Harry’s entire wardrobe. His black slacks were surely double that, and his shoes (was that dragonhide Harry spied?) were likely double that. So pretty and expensive, his little omega, dolled up as though for a runway show— the wrapping on him was so lovely, Harry was almost loath to rid him of it.
“Now you listen to me, Potter,” the omega growled, pressing his forearm against Harry’s windpipe. “I’m not above a little roughhousing, but you will not ever strike me— in anger or otherwise— or Salazar help me, I’ll stomp on your face exactly like I did on the train in sixth year. Is that clear?”
It was Saturday morning, only ten o'clock, when he noticed his shift into rut. It came slowly at first, marked by an insidious frustration, which was then followed by a hormone-induced increase in body temperature— small, easily dismissed things that could be chalked up to a lack of sleep and an excess of booze. Soon enough, however, Harry found himself snarling at his own reflection in the bathroom as he cleaned his hand from where he'd shattered a mug in the kitchen by gripping it too tightly, and it wasn't long after that before he developed a raging, throbbing erection, signaling the arrival of the full force of his rut.
“Harry,” Draco murmured against his lips, and Harry shivered at the use of his given name. “Take me to bed.”
“Fuck, Harry!” Draco keened, voice hoarse, and Harry leaned down so that they were back-to-chest, craving the feeling of Draco’s skin against his own. “I— I’m— oh, oh, oh.”
“I wonder if it would work outside of rut,” Draco pondered, snuggled up to Harry the last morning of his cycle.
Harry couldn’t see Draco, but he knew those pretty gray eyes were rolling. “The whole controlling you via pheromones thing.”
“Tell me,” Harry said, feeling a bit out-of-body. “Do you mind too terribly that I’ve left these marks? Marred you, forever?”
With surprisingly gentle hands, Draco pried Harry’s fists away from the sheets that they were holding in a death-grip and placed them in his own, the skin-on-skin contact providing an anchor to reality for Harry. Almost compulsively, Harry surged forward to kiss this oddly tender omega, and Draco welcomed him, straddling his lap and pushing him back down onto the pillows to support his head.
“Feed ‘em shit and keep them in the dark,” Harry grinned, and Draco pulled him forward by his hair to kiss him, wild and unrestrained.
Harry swallowed thickly— it would be a miracle if he survived this conversation without having some kind of attack.
“But— Harry, look— Merlin fuck, you’re mad as a bloody hatter!” Draco spluttered, looking more and more panicked by the minute. “You’re Saint Potter, the Chosen one and all that rot, and I’m— I’m an ex-Death Eater! The papers would go rabid. You can’t have really thought this through— they’ll eat you alive! I won’t let them rake your name through the mud I myself have made, Harry, I won’t.”
Harry paused his ministrations, crawling on top of Draco to press their clothed cocks together. “I never apologized.”
Malfoy was talking too much. Harry moved to strike him, but the omega was far too fast. Harry’s palm caught open air instead of a pale cheek, and in a moment’s time, their positions were reversed, with Malfoy pinning Harry to the fireplace instead of vice versa. Pain blossomed along the bottom of his skull where it collided with the brick, but Harry found himself smiling nonetheless— this omega was fast, and strong. A good potential mate.
An exhilarating thrill of arousal shot up Harry’s spine at those words, and Draco’s grin became positively feral.
“But I’ve hurt you,” Harry replied wretchedly, gesturing to Draco’s hips. “I knew this would happen, and I still let you come over and put yourself at risk. Forgive me, Draco, I’m such an idiot.”
As they removed each other’s clothes, Harry finally became lost to his rut entirely, sinking deeper and deeper into the scarlet haze of his desires. Later, Harry would realize that he’d physically flipped Draco over and buried his face in the omega’s ass until his entire face was covered in slick and Draco was near to tears— but the next thing he knew after that conversation, he was buried to the hilt in Draco’s arse, slamming in fast and hard as Draco cried out beneath him.
Harry grinned, feeling loopy from his post-coital high. “Hermoine has two of them, but I’ll do my best with the one that’s left.”
“Although, we probably should have talked about some things before dashing headlong into this,” Draco mused, still lazily, maddeningly pumping Harry’s throbbing erection with his fist. “But as I figure, we have about an hour before the next wave of your rut will hit, so why don’t I finish you off here so we can talk, yes?”
“There’s a dear,” Draco laughed, cupping Harry’s cheek in his hand. “Now, as we’ve talked about before, I’m perfectly fine with being rough in the bedroom. I like to feel it the morning after, if you catch my meaning.”
“And is this to be an open thing, you know, casual or whatever, or is this…” Draco thought for a moment. “Real?”
Harry grinned despite the nervous lurch in his stomach. He’d been working up the nerve to say something almost all week, but his time was running out— it was now or never. “I’d better tread lightly, then. I was sort of hoping you would come out to lunch with me. Or to the cinema. Or something.”
Because Malfoy hadn’t brought out his wand, hadn’t even moved his lips to mutter a spell, which either meant he had progressed to nonverbal spellcasting of Shield charms or-
“I don’t know, I just remember Hermione talking about it a while ago. Pretty sure it’s something Scottish.”
“I love you.” He says, eyes opening for just a second to look at his husband’s face, taking in the slow and sleepy smile.
There’s more. Harry knows he’s treading a dangerous line, testing the limits of his self-restraint. His desire for Draco, something he’d thought dormant for years, is slowly smoldering back to life and quickly becoming an uncomfortable flare, impossible to ignore and deny. He feels his skin come to life in anticipation whenever he has to brush past Draco, whether it is to grab a file or go out the door. And his stomach will always tighten at the smell of the office that is quickly taking on the wizard’s familiar scent.
„It still seems unreal,“ he admits. Harry loves him. At least that's what he said. It seems impossible.
I take my time kissing down his chest, idly wondering how it can feel so good to lick at his golden skin.
You shrug, not a care in the world. I know that's not true, but somehow, you always give off that impression.
He waits for me, trembling with want, and I can feel my body adjust. It's amazing what it can do, how it accomodates for Harry inside me.
Albus is eleven years old when he meets Scorpius Malfoy. But he doesn't meet him at Hogwarts, like any normal wizarding kid would.
My own room looks just like I have left it last time, except for some of the fresh stains that have been vanished. The houskeeping at the
I was here with Hermione, holding her hand. We've napped on each other's shoulders, afraid even when the Healers told us Ron was going to be fine.
When Harry gets home that night, I get him naked in minutes. Get him into our bed and kiss every inch of him.
Not very elegantly, I crawl up his body, lying next to him. I prop my head on my hand and run my free one through his hair.
„If you really think I don't want to, then you must be more oblivious than I am. I want you, Draco.“
Slender hands are sifting through my hair and I hum in contentment. „You have a lot of scars,“ Draco says quietly.
There hasn't been any hint of the She-Weasel soon popping out some brats of her own, but it is understood that that's only a matter of time.
„I doubt that nineteen would be your preferred age to enter fatherhood anyway,“ he says after a short moment of recovery.
Harry almost smiles at that. With all that makeup and the wig, it's hard to tell, but Harry is almost certain Jasmine is younger than he is.
It's replaced with a strange feeling, one that makes him sit up a little straighter, a sphere of light glowing in his chest.
„We're not working his case, but as far as I'm informed... I don't think they have much on him yet.“
One day, he was in the bathroom, sitting on the toilet and staring at Aunt Petunia's body lotion on the shelf like he always did so he would not, under any circumstances, look at
„I wanted to let you know that we've reevaluated the punishment set for you three and a half years ago and came to the conclusion it's not appropriate anymore. You'll be free to carry a wand of your liking as soon as you've recieved an official permission. I'll send it to you during the next days.“
Harry hides the sting Ron's words are leaving very carefully. It's not only selfish, but also pathetic to be jealous of Ron and Hermione moving in together.
„You're under arrest for attacking an authority and suspicion of the murder of Albert Runcorn,“ Ron informs Flint, who is still trying to land a punch in Ron's face.
But they get there. Harry knows now that he likes kneeling between Draco's legs and sucking him slowly until Draco is a
Draco smiles at her and I'm sure only I notice the strain of it. „I'll be happy to have you. Even though you might want to wait until I've completed the first few modifications.“
„I – well.“ He snuggles closer to me, shifting until he can tuck his head under my chin. I hold it there with one hand, kissing the top of his head. „I guess I never really thought about it.“
Draco closes his mouth again. Lifts his brow. „I was going to say: It's just a silly pillow. But I'll remember that.“
Harry isn't a cruel person, I know that, but right now, he's hurting me worse than most of my johns.
„Your lines are getting old,“ Draco tells the cup. Derek is apparently running out of ideas to scare him. Draco doesn't even flinch anymore and he doesn't turn around.
„Percy just said Malfoy and him have published his second book,“ Hermione signs, her eyes flickering between me and Draco.
Hermoine's face had grown soft. She'd understood that statement in a way Sam and Terry couldn't have.
„So I guess she has someone else, but -“ He takes a steadying breath. „But she won't really admit to it. I asked her if she cheated on me. She said no and I... think I believe her, but there must be someone.“
He doesn't look like he has slept much, either. Some ridiculous red stubble is dusting his cheeks and his pale, freckled skin has an unhealthy ashy undertone.
„A Tuesday. Auror Potter told us, Unspeakable Malfoy would meet him at his home. Can you confirm that?“
By the end of the day, they have a solid plan for the rest of the week – clubs to visit, people to interview and tests to be run.
„Do you think they can wait a little longer for us?“ Harry asks, already kissing his way down Draco's chest.
„I mean... they used to be really close. But when Ginny and I broke up, that took a toll on them. Mostly because Al blames Ginny and James blames me. Even though it was mutual.“
I cross my legs, flipping my fringe out of my face. The sun on my pale skin must make my eyeshadow glitter.
Weasley makes a nondescript grunt. I assume his issues are more based on his drug habit, but I hold my tongue.
„Brighton said it would be a good idea to have someone else take a look at you, kiddo. I told you Malfoy would come all the way from France to see you, remember?“
„That doesn't answer my question. Did you grow bored? Did you momentarily forget he's been a whore and then you remembered again and decided you couldn't handle it? Was that it?“
„Aren't you asking me if thinking about someone you're sleeping with a lot means you've caught feelings?“
Then he buys cotton candy for Harry and sits next to Jaylin on the rollercoaster. He gets back with his hair a mess, cheeks pink and a truck load of insults for Harry.
She spins to her bag, getting the bottles out. I throw Draco another look, this time slightly frightened. We both have to grin.
I'm not sure what it is exactly that wakes me up. I sleep light, always have, and even more so now that I'm half-bird.
„I feel like violating you. I don't want to sleep with you if you can't even get hard from me touching you,“ he says.
If it was anyone else but Hermione, I would not have been convinced to attend any kind of gala – no matter how interesting all the guests are supposed to be. It's some kind of charity event and since Ron and Hermione broke up, Hermione has thrown herself into her work at the Ministry.
I've sat next to her bed for three hours now, brushing her long, strawy hair and telling her stories in a low voice, hoping that, maybe, some of the words will reach her.
„I mean, she wouldn't have been able to properly care for the baby. And it would probably feel that its mother – never wanted it.“
I take one last look at you and decide you are still breathtakingly beautiful and in that moment, I truly don't hate you. I just hope you'll be glad you've been there one day. It's hard for you to see how much good you did. How loved you are. How very much you deserve that love.
my new patient will not be too pleased to have a Malfoy working his case. More specifically, his family won't.
I look up, my leg bouncing. My insides torn. „Of course I would! I just don't know what I'd do with it.“
But I honestly don't really believe that. Harry appears to be very chill with discovering his attraction to males.
There was a time I took love for granted. Before my father caught me with my mother's lipstick smeared over my mouth. Before I took the Mark and realized that I was about to commit a crime there is no coming back from. Before Crabbe and Goyle turned on me, and then Crabbe died in the fiendfyre and I was stumbling through a battle, not knowing who to fight for, only knowing I wanted it to be
Again his hand tightens around the two of them and Harry lets out a whimper, unable to help himself.
“But not just family dear, though I’m glad we’ve done right that way, at least.” She cups his cheek. “Even strangers, people you don’t know, people we grew up hating just for being different.” She takes a deep breath. “Even Muggles. They have families too, and they share some of the same problems we do. Everyone’s just trying to make it safely through this world.”
Ginny shoots Blaise a knowing look as she accepts his hand to rise from the chair. "Yes. I was just saying how odd it was, how-"
Harry's leaning against the side of the tent, drink in hand and watching the dancing couples- not Draco, who's been sulking around with Pansy on his arm all night- when Ginny comes to stand beside him.
But Harry is rushing past him, pulling him in and closing the door. Then it’s more snogging, first with Draco pressed against his own door and then Harry.
“And if it does?” Harry challenges him, his eyes boring into Draco’s. “If it does come down to that? Me or your parents, acceptance or disinheritance, being yourself or living a lie? What would you do then Draco? What would you choose?”
He’d had mixed feelings about McGonagall for a while but now, looking at the patience in her eyes and steadfast expression, he can’t help but feel grateful and reassured.
Dumbledore is the first person Draco’s mind jumps to, and surprisingly, he thinks that’s exactly who Harry is thinking of too.
He does pause a bit when it becomes obvious the gift in hand is a book. For a second he’s worried he’s going to hate it and that he’ll have to pretend not to. Or what if it’s a gag gift? Did wizards do those for Secret Santa? If anyone would get Harry a gift he hates as a joke, Harry supposes it could be Draco. Or maybe he’s trying to rile him up?
It takes a long time and a lot of careful maneuvering to slip out of the bed without waking the blonde wizard up. There’s a fire smoldering behind a grate and Harry blushes, wondering if a House Elf had come in or if the fire had been going the entire time.
“It’s just… even if they hadn’t been great people, what else would everybody say to me? Nobody would be going around talking about how awful they were, would they? Or how Mum might have had an annoying laugh and Dad a habit of speaking with his mouth full of food.”
Harry snorts and Draco nudges him in the side pointedly while Hermione rolls her eyes at them before she focuses on the cup in Harry’s hand. “By the way, Harry, who gave you that drink? I know we’re supposed to be pacing ourselves but I’d like one.”
Seamus nudges him in the side. "Try shouting a bit louder mate, I'm sure McGonagall would like for Hogsmeade to hear you."
Draco takes a deep breath but when he looks up his sneer is ugly on his mouth and his eyes are full of hatred. No sign of hurt or regret is present, and Harry's stomach sinks unhappily.
“Prove it. Show me I’m wrong. Maybe my memory is faulty.” Harry grins at him in challenge. “Go and dance without looking as ridiculous as them.”
“He said he turned down Romilda so I’m struggling to see what on earth you two could have managed to fight about.”
“Draco, Draco!” A photographer yells, yanking back his attention and he poses carefully. He stands with his award and then with Thelonius and the members of the Potions Committee, but as soon as his former mentor starts speaking he looks back towards where Harry had been, to make sure he hadn’t imagined him.
“I always thought Slytherins were racy and- and promiscuous, I suppose would be the word though it doesn’t seem right. You all gave us grief for being prudes, and Pansy and Theo certainly don’t seem like innocents. Plus you told me about the games you all played up here.”
“Two seconds,” Draco says, every inch of him aching, every nerve singing with happiness and excitement and bone deep arousal. “Just… here we are,
“But just so we’re clear I want to be with you. I’m asking for a second chance. If you don’t want that or can’t give it to me that’s alright, Harry. But don’t think I want anything less than you.” His honesty scrapes Harry raw. “That’s how I feel and where I stand. Anything else is up to you.”
It isn’t pity that Draco feels then, staring into the ruins of the Potter residence, but it’s something along those lines. A wish that Harry had never lost his parents, that he’d never had to grow up missing them and being unable to understand that huge part of everyone else’s lives.
The taps turn back to off and Draco breathes out in relief as Harry slowly says, “Hi. Good to see you again, Myrtle.”
A House Elf appears and he looks down at her, blinking the rain away. “Could you tell Draco that Harry Potter is here?”
Another fond look from McGonagall before she’s facing the two of them, lips pursed. “Very well. I am happy that things are changing. And I’d hoped, judging from your year, that the other students were following suit. But it never hurts to check.
them.” Harry replies. “I guess I’m just tired of people looking at me and the people I’m with and being surprised when things change. I have a private life. There’s so much that happens they don’t see- take between you and me for example- but people still feel like they know me because of what they read from a newspaper.” He sighs. “I’m not explaining it right. Forget it. I guess I’m just sick of being looked at and getting judged on things they know nothing about.”
“McGonagall arranged it. I’m sure the rooms in Grimmauld Place are full of crazy letters. And okay, maybe I’m not quite used to stuff like that, but come on Draco, the papers have been saying stuff about me practically since I was born. Half of the crap over the years probably came from you.” He sends a knowing look at Draco who feigns innocence. “I’m- not okay with it, but I’m used to it. But I know other people- a lot of them can get frustrated with what comes from knowing me. The press. Or even the attention, all the questions and people coming up to them, that kind of thing.” Harry shifts his weight from one foot to the other, looking away. “I can understand if that would- make you mad or freak you out or something.”
Draco looks peaceful. Relaxed. His face is soft, his hair messy and just starting to be in need of a wash. For a second Harry pictures Draco in the shower and has to shift and force the thoughts away. He likes watching Draco sleep, and it’s such a new and rare occurrence he intends to savour it.
But now he finds he doesn’t want to take advantage of it at all. Draco values his privacy now and he’ll treat the secrets of his friends no differently.
"No. And yes, of course you're miserable, what other type of person drinks before 5 o'clock?" Blaise hesitates for a second. "He is too, you know."
“You’ll be alright that first week? You could always come with Ron and I, my parents wouldn’t mind.”
Retirement. Draco almost snorts at the phrasing but catches himself at the last second. Even though it’s a Sunday that is no reason for him to let his guard down, even at home. Especially at home. His mother is smarter than most of the officials at the Ministry, Draco is certain of it.
It's with a ferocity Draco has never felt before that he kisses Harry back. Their lips move eagerly and the rush of want he had felt that morning comes back full force. His mouth opens with a gasp and Harry wastes no time in gently letting his tongue rove around, meeting Draco's own and causing his cock to twitch.
He’d lost his breath and stared at Draco, the two of them close enough for him to see the other wizard’s eyes widen, to feel his fingers clench beneath Harry’s and watch the way his grey eyes had dropped to Harry’s lips.
His eyes look over her shoulder to land on Teddy who is sitting on Narcissa’s lap playing with an enchanted block game. As the baby builds a tower out of the wooden cubes the blocks shake and fall down at random, causing him to have to start all over again. As Harry watches Teddy only manages to pile up four blocks before the tower crumbles on itself, making the baby frown in concentration and make quiet noises of unhappiness.
He’d already been spending huge amounts of time with the Slytherin, but now they’re never really apart. They spend the mornings reading side by side in the Common Rooms- Slytherin or Gryffindor, whichever was emptier. Harry might only have been catching up on class readings he’s neglected all of term, or flicking through the latest Quidditch news, but it still counts as reading, no matter what Draco tried to say. If they weren’t inside relaxing or playing exploding snap or chess then they were outside, walking the grounds of Hogwarts or visiting Hagrid. They’d even gotten into a heated debate with Nearly-Headless Nick the other day.
“Oh.” That does sound like something people would put on someone’s grave. But he sees the look on Harry’s face and hears the tone he uses and hazards a guess. “You don’t think so?”
The set of Harry’s shoulders eases just a bit and he nods absently. Draco doesn’t take it personally as he waits a moment for Harry’s stilted explanation.
Harry grits his teeth, turning around to see Pansy, Blaise and Draco behind him. While Pansy is smiling at him, grinning like a cat with a canary, Draco is standing, eyes wide and visibly shocked. Blaise is eyeing Harry closely, curiosity written all over his face and Harry ignores his annoyance and the small flare of alarm at the three of them having heard his conversation with Ron and Hermione.
The pep talk doesn’t raise his spirits as much as Draco had hoped, but it’s enough to make him get out of bed and rummage through his trunk for some clothes before moving to the bathroom.
A few times Harry forgets their shared history and he finds himself just enjoying being around Draco, like back in Hogwarts when they’d first become friends.
“Brilliant,” he breathes and moves in to kiss Draco, grabbing his cheeks before pressing their lips together determinedly. “Yes, okay. Yes.”
Now he frowns. “But that would just lead to everything repeating all over again. The problems are still there.”
“Hermione, it’s Umbridge. There are no limits when it comes to her.” He grins, shaking his head. “Bloody brilliant.”
“That’s not- look, why can’t you just accept that I’ve forgiven him? Why wouldn’t you want all of us to move on?”
Mental, Harry thinks, especially when they all look just fine normally. But he supposes he’s the same, feeling anxious about tonight just because it’s meant to be fancy, meant to be special.
He’s realized that you can only really have a crush on somebody if you know them. If they let you in, at least a little bit. And where before Draco had wondered about and perhaps even been fascinated by Potter, now he knows he has a full-blown schoolgirl-kind crush on the prat.
is because he’d been with Malfoy once when it had happened, walking from the library together. When Zacharias Smith had passed them a week ago Harry had seen the git point his wand to Malfoy and mutter under his breath.
The parties with all of the Houses are great and Draco finds himself really enjoying them. All of the alcohol consumed doesn’t hurt, but on the nights Draco decides to partake himself it really doesn’t help rein in his impulses. Which means he spends a good part of the parties either talking to Harry and staring at his mouth- or some other body part that’s particularly distracting at the time- or he spends it talking to someone else while staring at Harry’s mouth and/or other body part.
Blaise shrugs nonchalantly. “It’s not that. They just never last. It’s barely worth meeting them to be honest.”
“And remember, obviously.” He needles him some more before giving up some of his pride in trade for honesty. “Well I was miserable. Horrible company for Pansy.”
It’s been a looming weight at the back of his mind for weeks now, but in the past few days it’s really started to hang over him. He’s been distracted- though luckily neither Draco or Ron have seemed to notice. Hermione has, but she knows him well enough to know he’ll talk to her when he’s ready after he easily rebuffed her questions earlier.
The door is still open from where he has practically wrenched it off the hinges, and Draco had prickled at the rudeness before checking to make sure nothing had fallen off the shelves from the force of the gesture. Really, sometimes Blaise just didn't think.
He feels her piercing eyes on his face but still doesn’t look away from Draco and Teddy on the floor. Andromeda has returned from the bathroom and Draco looks up at her with Teddy on his lap, the two of them starting a conversation Harry can’t quite make out clearly.
Pansy obviously watches Draco too because her eyes narrow over her cup and she pulls it away, swallowing hurriedly. “What seriously? Are you for real?”
“Alright.” He says, shooting Draco a quelling look when the blonde opens his mouth. “You’ve all picked already?”
He had stood there alone in the Common Room, lost in thought as he’d stared into the fire. Then he’d turned, grabbed Harry’s cloak and hurried up to fall in his own bed, blissfully thankful when he’d seen all of the others were already asleep.
Looking at Harry though, watching him trail his hands over leaves and jerk away from plants that writhe and snap at him, Draco wonders if the other wizard will ever consider being part of a family like this.
"No, I wasn't either." Draco admits, beginning to trace patterns on Harry's exposed forearm. "Pansy was very fed up with me by morning. Apparently I’d been more miserable than usual, drinking myself to sleep, glaring moodily at the fire, that kind of thing. She said I was a right prick."
“I’m not mad.” Harry shakes his head. All the years with the Dursley’s and he’d only glimpsed a photo of his grandparents once, where it stood in Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon’s bedroom. He’d been forbidden from ever going in there for as long as he can remember and Petunia had never spoken of them. “I never would have thought- the way she acted over the years I just assumed she’d gotten rid of anything to do with her.”
He slumps forward at the words and would have slid down the wood of the door if Harry’s arms hadn’t leapt up to wrap around him and haul Draco back into his chest to hold him warmly.
"What a stupid thing of you to do," Pansy announces cheerfully before settling more comfortably beside him, and Draco's mouth twitches despite himself. He’s missed Pansy. "So you're done pitying yourself now then?"
“That’s alright, I think I’m just going to go and take a nap. You stay, study the best you can. One of us should probably know this stuff.” He forces a smile, glances at Draco for a second to see the blonde wizard is watching him closely, before looking away again. “See you all later.”
That old monster that lived in him back before he kissed Ginny for the first time hasn’t reared its head at least. That alone is enough to tell Harry something.
For a second Draco falters and Harry sees something, a flash, a glimpse of vulnerability. It makes his heart ache and only reassures him that he made the right decision in telling Ron and Hermione that the two of them are friends.
was right and they are friends, but he’s standing in front of Draco and giving him a chance to make a fool of Harry and send him back to the Great Hall after rejecting him.
“Take these off,” he orders against Harry’s lips, tugging at the soaked robes. Now that he’s thinking about it, the front of his clothes are wet as well and he pulls away, looking down at the large damp spot running down his body.
has been getting regular updates about his father and that Lucius is as well as could be expected, and oh did she mention to Draco that Mr. Aberjean and his wife had visited the other day?
Harry swallows, blinking fast behind his glasses. “Thank you,” he whispers, so quiet Draco can probably barely hear him. “Honestly. I’m glad you did. And I’m not- this isn’t a- a rejection, or refusal. If we both feel the same way then we’ll still feel this way after a few days of thinking things through and knowing where we stand.” He offers a small and wry grin. Draco doesn’t smile back. “What’s a few more days added to the past three years?”
"Ron!" Hermione hisses. "And you know the only reason so many Slytherins didn't fight was because McGonagall made them leave-"
Potter’s eyes drag over him and Draco’s nipples actually harden as he does. He feels his cock stir again and turns away quickly to start inching towards the shower where hopefully the steam will hide anything too embarrassing.
She sees Harry looking and smiles, her brown eyes crinkling warmly. “I just came from getting Christmas lunch ready at my family’s. Didn’t feel like changing.”
He thinks of Myrtle, of how betrayed she must have been once she’d realized it had been Draco. She may have forgiven him now, but it doesn’t erase that it happened.
“You’re right.” Another hand squeeze had come his way. “Good thing you’re just friends then, hmm? No feelings involved.”
Both of their smiles drop immediately and Harry’s fascination with the daydream fades away just like that.
When he looks back at Harry he sees that he’s noticed as well. Their eyes meet and both of them share surprised grins.
Draco, who’s Blaise’s best man. Draco who has organized tonight. Draco who Harry hasn’t seen since they left Hogwarts two years ago.
“Good morning Pansy, how did you sleep, I slept wonderfully, thank you for asking.” Draco grumbles to her before taking a sip of pumpkin juice.
"Hardly." There's a moment of silence before he evidently decides to continue. "I'm the one who broke it off between us Potter, remember? Do try to keep up, it's tedious for the rest of the world to have to slow down and explain everything to you."
“Right.” Draco hurries on. “There was also- well I was worried about what the public would say to us. The papers were already crucifying us being together, and they only thought we were friends. And of how serious we were so fast. I couldn’t believe that we wouldn’t end in a disaster because when I’m happy there’s always something that pulls the rug out from under me. Then there was Ron and Hermione and what they might have thought.”
They never stop kissing as they go and have to pause on their way three separate times as they get too caught up in having one another’s lips on theirs. Draco has to stop himself from just tugging Harry down right there in the hallway and letting them have one another.
Draco and Harry had both decided it would be better to wait until after exams to tell people, just so they could study and focus on school without adding any distractions beyond the typical struggle of their N.E.W.T.S. Not that it’s stopped Draco from worrying much, because he knows that before they tell anybody else he needs to tell his parents. And he’s sure he’s going to be at least ten times worse once the letters are sent out so it was probably a good call.
"Piss off, Malfoy." Harry narrows his eyes, ignoring the hint of excitement in his belly at the argument. It has been a long time since he’s been able to bicker with somebody. Most people just agreed with whatever he says these days and those who don’t, like Ron, Hermione and Ginny, usually share his opinion or have more important things going on.
She delicately raises a goblet and when Harry looks over at his own he sees it fill with something that looks like cider. He quickly picks it up and holds it towards Professor McGonagall whose eyes meet his as she gives a quick smile. “I know we are all anxious to eat so I will finish with this. To all of you, and a very Happy Holidays.”
And there’s no way everyone’s mind will change, even if miracles do happen and some are more forgiving than others. You’ll be judged.”
"And you know, it's so strange. Because Aunt Petunia, she almost seemed sorry when I left their house. She was the one who had done all of this to me, had- had abused me for years, and she looked like she was almost about to cry when I was leaving. And I can’t understand myself sometimes, when I think about it. Because I can't make myself hate them no matter how hard I try. I mean, I even talk to my cousin Dudley once in a while. Not often mind, but at Christmas I'll send him a card and I know he’ll send me one back. How pathetic does that make me? That I can't be angry at the people who hurt me and who- who damaged me so much? I should be taller and more confident, but I'm not, and it's because of them. I shouldn't have had to wear clothes that didn't fit me, I shouldn't have had to go 11 years with no presents and no- no hugs or kisses or anything. No kid should have that. Why did I have to? After Voldemort and my parents... what made me deserve that?"
Harry had put his wand away, but only because people passing them were openly staring. Probably thinking they were about to get into a duel, and that was the last thing Harry needed getting back to the staff or the Wizengamot. Malfoy was supposed to stay out of trouble, and so far, somehow, he’d been doing a miraculous job.
He flips a couple of more pages, smiling at pictures of Hagrid with various animals. Even McGonagall is in a couple where she is standing with Dumbledore. Harry looks at them all before he keeps flipping, and then stops in surprise when the pictures that look up at him are full of his own face from after the war.
Slowly he picks up his tea, adding one spoonful of sugar and watching as Draco adds three. Hagrid chugg his straight.
“I just…” Draco trails off in frustration. “People look at me and think I’m stupid for ever having believed my family. Ron and Ginny can’t understand it at all. But I look at them and think the same thing. They think that their parents are saints, and alright, yes, they are good people, I won’t fight that but- but they’re not bloody perfect, alright? Dumbledore wasn’t faultless. And I don’t want history books in the future to make it out as a Good against Evil issue when it was more than that. My family didn’t only fight for power, we fought to protect ourselves and to uphold values we’d been taught all our lives, things we were never allowed to question.”
I tried very hard to decide on one destination to recommend here, but I just can’t. I love France! Some of the places I like are not even wizarding. I’ve spent many summer breaks and some Christmases in Lyon. From there we also often travelled to Southern France. From what you said, the city centres might be a bit too snotty for you, but the villages and the landside are as picturesque as it gets. Visit St Tropez if you’re into shopping or coffee or watching these Muggle sailing vessels drifting past in the sea. It’s hardly magical but I liked it there.
I was appalled, frankly, when I realised how oblivious I’ve been during the last few years. Like with Ron and Hermione, for example! It’s odd. I spent hours upon hours in Ron and Hermione’s company during my school days, but I never once suspected they’d become a couple. I’m going to have to agree with you: the amount of snogging that they’re currently engaging in is a little excessive.
I have to admit, I enjoyed reading it more than I anticipated. There is no possible way that you could have known this about me, but there are parts of this poem that hit rather quite close to home, particularly this line: “The grave’s a fine and private place / But none, I think, do there embrace.’ Yes, having sex is something that I’d like to do before I die (!) but I still think that it has to be the right person.
It is no secret that Harry and Draco’s early schooldays were tempestuous, and this fact alone is perhaps why the world was so astonished by their kiss last week. The two wizards, sorted into rival Hogwarts houses, were competitive both on and off, the Quidditch Pitch and their scuffles often made headlines.
Okay. Better. At least you’ll be able to read this, now. I’m just going to talk, try and get everything down. Darling, I’m so frantic. I’m furious. Not only with you, but with Hogwarts too. You shouldn’t have been put in that position, love. You shouldn’t, ever, have been made to face a pair of fucking Aurors without a legal representative!
Love, I can practically see your grin just from reading your words. That’s exciting news! I’m so chuffed right now – I’d love to throw my arms around you right, but it’s not long until we meet anyway. I can’t wait to hear all about it. Just one thing – I’m sure, no matter whether you prefer an apprenticeship or the study programme – you can do anything. You’re much cleverer than you think you are.
I’m very sure that I’m not who you expected your paramour to be, and I understand, of course, that this can’t be the kind of relationship you’d wish to entertain with me. I can only hope that you spare yourself from rereading our diary. It must fill you with disgust and perhaps, after all, you finally see why I was afraid to meet. I would have seen only little chances with basically anyone in our year, but it’s you, Potter. You’re probably the one I harmed and insulted the most over the years. I can’t possibly ask for your forgiveness.
All I had to promise was the pair of us to return on Friday night to be served a grand meal with all the trimmings. Hardly a hardship in my humble opinion, and the extra golden lining is that you can teach me all the well-bred dining techniques that I’ll need for the award ceremony. My only worry is that the Elves don’t cause themselves an injury fighting over who gets to wait on us. I know what the school house-elves can be like.
I wanted to tell him so badly, Draco. It would have been easy for me to say that Dean wants you as well, that he’s enraptured by you and that he looks at you like you’re the only wizard in the world. I didn’t though. I don’t think Seamus would have believed me, and that would only have shattered the delicate trust that had built up between the two of us.
I shook my head. I wanted you, wanted all the gifts that being in love, and making love, would endow upon us. You smiled then, called me your beautiful boy and told me I was the sexiest thing that you’d seen in your life. Then propped up my bottom with a pillow that you’d procured for the purpose. My skin goosebumped and tickled as you cast an intimate hygiene spell upon me, and then you shuffled in close behind me.
It all sounds laughable as I speak the words. There are reasons that I reacted so extremely, ones that I won’t…can’t talk to you about right now, but I promise you, I was genuinely shaken.
Okay, this said… Perhaps that’s one of the things a Barrister could tackle? At least the frequency? I don’t even know how often we’re talking about, but I’m not too fond of surprises, at least not when they come in scarlet robes.
“I’m just mirroring your stupid grin, you sap,” I said, and urged you on to get going, not wanting to waste too much time until Diagon would be full of wixen on their Easter shopping.
One hundred Galleons to you, my mysterious pal. You correctly identified the wizard getting knocked about in that disgusting, grubby little space. It was none other than Draco Malfoy.
My lips found that spot on your neck that elicits alluring moans and laughter all the same. You shoved me away because you had something else you wanted to give me.
“You know what else to find with Cassiopeia?” you asked, and I could basically hear the smirk on your face when you followed the line of the W over to Draco. It was even dark enough to see Thuban with the bare eye, the former pole star. From there, I showed you Cygnus, my grandfather and Sirius’s Uncle, still very low on the horizon because the Swan constellation is best visible during the summer months.
And I want to see my name on the tapestry, as well as Mother’s. Are you on it as Sirius’s godson? If not, you certainly will be once we’re bonded.
I think, with my rough and wild rockstar, I was a little more attracted to what he represented rather than the actual wizard hidden beneath the robes.
Okay, so. You have asked me a while ago how I usually pleasure myself and I promised to tell you. I shall keep my promise. The answer to that is that I still do it mutely under my sheets. I just push my hand down my pyjama bottoms, really. And I decided that that’s dreadfully boring.
Of course, I was reminded of them vividly as soon as the holidays started! Family is still a bit of a problematic subject for me. My childhood wasn’t what anyone would describe as standard or normal, but I didn’t completely comprehend that at the time. I was fed a lot of very unpleasant ideas by my relatives, and I internalised them completely. I didn't know any different. Anyway, no more about them. They need to stay locked firmly in the past where they belong.
Also, thanks for your side-trip to the Apothecary. A few droplets of Dreamless Sleep are certainly a better idea than mindlessly quitting it cold turkey, right? Whatever would I do without you?
It seems that all your advice on how to conduct yourself at a formal, refined dinner came at precisely the right time. I couldn’t quite believe the news this morning, could you?
I think this way she will know that it’s also me talking right from the start. Pansy is a lazy bint. I could see her read your first paragraph, then skim the letter for anything that would catch her attention, and then discard it quick as a hex when all she finds are reminisces about the war and Hogwarts. Also, I’m in hopes that a word like ‘fainéant’ will awaken memories of me right away. I’ve called her that several times while it’s a bit too erudite (read: ostentatious) to sound like you, my darling.
Ron Weasley is a sly git, not telling me what Hermione and he have been up to and where they were going. I mean, I knew they were sneaking off to do the deed, so to speak, but not the exact location. When I think that we could have been getting up to all manner of saucy shenanigans for weeks, I must confess I’m a little bit disappointed. Still, at least we know now.
Warm Butterbeer was a brilliant idea. I can’t believe that the Hogwarts house-elves get you little meals and such whenever you just politely ask for it. You’re seriously unbelievable. Every time I think I have an idea about who you are, you write or tell or show me something new, rendering me speechless. When I thought that writing with you has been overwhelming while it was still anonymous but heartfelt nonetheless – I certainly had no clue about the flesh-and-blood version of you.
That’s probably because the only pair of eyes glued to me was Ron’s. He gave me a crafty smirk when I sat down next to him and commented on your hasty retreat into your dormitory this morning. Love, he wanted to know where we were, and I couldn’t lie to his darned amiable Weasley grin.
Of course, being the Saviour that I am, I retrieved my wand from Trelawney’s desk and set her a Cushioning Spell so that she wouldn’t wake. Then it was but a minute of work to complete my detention tasks with housekeeping spells – Gods, I love magic! – and now I’m killing a few minutes to avert suspicion before waking the barmy old thing from her dreams and taking my leave. I did tell you I was nearly sorted into Slytherin!
for weeks. Wix like DM, purebloods who came from influential and persuasive families have been put under powerful probation spells by the Ministry. A so-called emergency measure to stop reprisals and revenge attacks.
Good night, mon coeur. Before I’ll sleep, I shall self-test the lube because I’m fucking curious. Also, it will give me a better idea of what it felt like for you.
Please don’t think this is your fault. I was so moved by your words. Still, the sentiment was overshadowed by memories that just won’t let me go.
We found a spot, didn’t we, in front of the fire. I wanted to be close to you, and so sat in the sphere of your lap, letting my head rest against the juncture of your head and shoulder. I’m sure my hair tickled you, but you didn’t complain. You wrapped your arms around my waist, and I felt utterly blissful and so very content. The other students milling around the common room must have seen us exactly as we see ourselves: as completely a couple as any other that have fallen in love during their last year at Hogwarts.
But I worried you, my dear Draco, which has never been my intention. I owe you an apology. But of course there was no way to contact you or anyone else, for that matter, only my case Auror. You will surely understand that I refrained from bothering a busy Auror with sending notice of a mother’s love and her whereabouts. Please do not fret. Staying at the Ministry for a few days was hardly an inconvenience in the light of the splendid outcome. As I am writing to you, I am back in Whitby.
I think that having a man wanting me enough to give me a blowjob – or giving one back – is probably one of my dearest fantasies.
“Everything that binds me to this earth is doomed”? You’re a bigger fool than even I took you for, aren't you? Nothing is doomed. Not a single, fucking thing is doomed. Yes, I know you’ve been given a shit hand of luck, and I know that things might look dark right now, but you’ve not lost everything. You haven’t.
It literally made my skin rise into goosebumps to hear the way that Barnfield described his lover. Merlin, but he was so captivated by the man’s mouth, wasn’t he? Red lips against pale, flawless skin. The way that his mouth – and kisses, I expect – were as sweet as strawberries and honey. Don’t giggle at my purple prose. You know that I’m a fan of any sweet stuff!
Individuals with ink-stained cuffs, and furrowed brows have been very much at the forefront of my mind in recent months. They ought to know that they wouldn’t need to step up any kind of game, were they to find themselves back in my company.
Teddy, his gran, and I have just returned from the Yuletide celebrations, and I’ve settled down at the kitchen table to tell you about the rituals. I didn’t want to omit a single detail. Luckily the heavy rain that you described falling in Whitby had spared us, and the three of us made our way to the Druid circle about an hour ago, just as night began to fall.
Your voice still resounds in my mind when I think about that day, love. Thank you for your patience with Mother. I hope that seeing her tipsy, gossiping with Andi about all the Muggle-cut festive robes, and – most importantly – dancing with her, all at our bonding reception, was worth the effort you advanced towards her. I saved this until now, but right after Hermione snatched you from her on the dancefloor, Mother told me with almost indecently flushed cheeks, “But how handsome your Harry looks tonight, Draco darling. He’s not much of a dancer, but he’s such a dishy gentleman.”
Pansy will certainly get the paragraph on the war and how our actions don’t necessarily define us as a person. I think it hits home. If she’s anything like the Pansy I used to know, talking about anything as grand as forgiveness or apologies that you actually really don’t owe her at all, Harry, would only hurt her pride and rile her up. I’m sure she won’t fail to answer with that sharp tongue of hers anyways.
It was all that was on my mind at that moment. I needed you inside of me, needed to have your hot, wet mouth replaced with your unrelenting cock. But you soothed me with endearments, holding the base of my cock when you sensed that I must’ve been too close to orgasm. And when I regained some control over my lust, I felt your fingers slip inside of me, covered in lube and your spit, your tongue slipping in between them.
It was to be expected, wasn’t it? There was a time I would have trusted Potter to deliver a bloody speech once he’s finally decorated with that Order of Merlin. Yesterday I didn’t even have to glimpse his direction to have an idea what his expression might look like.
Of course, my beloved, you were absolutely correct. Having met Narcissa only two days before I soon saw the similarities that you’d been talking about. Andi always dressed neatly, and held herself stiffly, and her words were always judiciously well chosen. I’d thought there were fragments of the witch that were unique to her alone, but I soon saw that they might be familiar to you.
Taking your lead, I slid my arms around your waist and fondled the delicious curve of your arse. I held the jut of your hipbone in one hand, and I walked the other around to your elegant, curved prick. You were every bit as excited as I was, darling, your beautiful cock was erect and full, flushed a deep pink and glistening with precum.
That’s the effect you seem to have on me, my unknown friend. No stimulation has ever made my body respond so powerfully before. If you were here, then I know I wouldn’t be able to keep my self-control. I’d kiss you and kiss you. I’d suck your cock. I’d worship you with my hands and my heart. I’m mad for you.
Please don’t laugh, but my Mind Healer told me about a Muggle novelist called Ernest Hemingway, and he said that while the world breaks everyone, the places we grow the strongest are those broken places. My Mind Healer likened it to a kintsugi repair on a broken pot. The Japanese highlight the breaks with a seam of pure gold; and, for me, that is exactly what your Dark Mark and your Sectumsempra scars are.
“Apparently, both me and Theo are not meant to converse with criminals, obviously. The problem with Pansy Parkinson, though, is only that it’d require an International Owl, which is off limits as well,” I told her.
Today, my darling, was the second full day of our holiday. It was a Sunday, and we had little in the way of plans other than to explore and discover some of the more intricate and hidden places of our new home.
Speaking of which – my upbringing. It’s rather interesting to see how easily outsiders realise that the pure-blood way doesn’t allow for much diversion. I already stated some of the good sides of it, as well as some irritating ones. But it does feel weird to complain, given that I’ve been raised with money, excellent education, exciting vacations… You’re right on the wand in saying that it’s ridiculously prim and proper though. You don’t really get to choose your childhood friends, but instead have them presented when some important family visits your parents.
I hope that receiving a letter bearing the Hogwarts postcard didn’t distress you too badly, and that hearing names from the very recent past is a pleasure to you, rather than a burden. I sincerely hope that Italy has treated both you and your parents well, and that you are well and happy.
They’d have tolerated you for being my boyfriend, love, but they’ve accepted you for you alone. Not for me. Personally, I couldn’t be happier about that fact. It means I get my fiancé and my friends all together, and there isn’t anything that sounds better in the world to me.
I feel like Mother might’ve been changed by the war though. I haven’t seen her in a while, and I suppose that she might rather be in France than in Britain. We are only allowed to write about once a month, so it’s hard to tell. But it feels like she could’ve changed. Having my letters checked and limited is part of the regulations, by the way.
You don’t sound like a smug know-it-all. Well, maybe you do a teeny bit, but it’s pleasant to hear a bit about the wider world. I’m not the best travelled if I’m being strictly honest but I do plan to make up for that when I get older. I want to experience everything that this world has to offer.
“What do you think?” I teased, wanting to prolong the moment and really drive you wild. “Have you been spoiled enough? Or do you reckon swallowing your cock might be a more worthy prize?”
Think I’ve never told a single soul those things that you read in the last two paragraphs. And I don’t know whether I should feel relieved or pathetic. Up to now I’ve always thought I’m the only one with this kind of struggle. Looks like I’m just a selfish prick.
Please forgive me for letting you wait for so long. I would explain my behaviour if I only could. But mentioning this scar feels so petty and ridiculous while talking about it. The truth is that this rotten thing decides how I dress and how I move so that no one, myself included, will see it. It has so much control over me, but I have no idea how to change that.
And I wasn’t an entirely dreadful dialogue partner in the end, right? I’m sorry that you render me so mute, but please know that I had a splendid time. I’m a bit overwhelmed, but in a good way.
I hardly dare believe that it can be true, but I’m reading it right now, over and over, written in his twirly formal handwriting.
You will have to tell me whether I’m huge or not, I will say no such thing. But you sure know how to bring a smug grin to my face.
You stripped naked, my beautiful boy, and stepped under the showerhead. Wandless magic began the spray and I gazed, captivated as you began to wash your hair. I was beside you in moments, Draco, hardly conscious of taking off my own gear and dumping it on the floor. The water was hot and the glass steamy. The two of us might have been caught, but that only added to the naughty thrill of being naked and intimate with you.
Of course, I couldn’t let such a grievous comment stand. “Badly cast?” I gasped, sliding my arm around your waist and giving you the lightest of tickles. “I’ll have you know that my spells always find their mark.”
Your hand snuck between us, ever so focused on my cock, and I leaned back when you gave me a long stroke, pulling my foreskin down in a firm grip, and just holding my prick for a second, looking at me. “Draco, you look so gorgeous,” you said, almost reverent. You have no idea what that does to me. Your eyes so dilated, your raw voice in awe from just looking at me, holding me.
We should totally become ridiculously adept in casting Glamours. What do you reckon, Harry? We could go anywhere without earning just one admiring, appalled, or disgruntled glance from anyone. I do realise that you’d have to live with not being able to admire my statuesque, patrician beauty for the time being, but perhaps you would be willing to put up with that instead of an obnoxious horde of fans.
We were having good fun with the music and musing about how Mother managed to put this much money to the side for me, coming up with the craziest ideas, exuberant as we were. But with your first yawn, I knew that I needed to seize the opportunity to talk to you about this bloody Dark Mark. I didn’t just want to go to bed, strip my (your) jumper over my head and ta-daa, but rather felt like I needed to explain my weird behaviour.
Merlin, we haven’t even kissed yet. I can see why the talk with Edward’s grandmother might have caught you off-guard. If I’m honest with myself, it will be way better and healthier to talk things over and to ease into this together, right? I’ll try to be less old-fashioned, darling. There’s no need to get bonded so young and it can hardly be considered timely.
“They’ll take everything, Harry,” you murmured, clinging to my hand, the grip of you so tight that I felt the metal of my betrothal ring digging into my palm. “Take everything we’ve planned for. Ruin the potions business. Forbid us from getting bonded. Oh, bloody hell! What if they think I’ve failed my probation somehow? Believe that I need to be taken to Azkaban?”
I felt all my lust pool in my balls when you finally – finally! – crouched between my legs, raising them with your arms to get good access to my arse. I held my breath while you pushed inside, bestowing me with a repetition of “Draco, fuck”. Your eyes were glued to where your prick slid inside of me.
But even before dinner, you awaited me outside of the Great Hall with a crooked grin on your face. Of course I had to tell you again how relieved I was by the contents of the letter. “One might think Pansy was your archenemy rather than your friend,” you said, rubbing my sore shoulders a bit (which you are very welcome to do, at all times). I’m sure I must’ve rolled my eyes.
No wonder McGonagall was walking around with such a sour face on her at breakfast. In my experience, most parties end up being more disappointing than enjoyable.
So... First of all, Andi, Teddy and I might be related by blood, but I think it makes perfect sense to call them your family rather than mine.
Oh yes! The reason that I actually picked up my quill to write to you, Draco. Somehow you always have the effect of making me lose my thread. I think it’s because you’re gorgeous and I love you immensely. So, while I was in the Library yesterday – after I’d finished writing my long letter to yourself about Seamus – I was hardly in the mood to finish revising. We had less than ten minutes anyway.
And don’t even get me started on Father. It’s like I vanished the memory of him with my best Occlumency techniques. Just like that. Not a single thought. Not about his health, his fears, how the guards would treat him – nothing! Salazar, I can’t…
Draco Malfoy. It is great pleasure to offer you an official welcome into what counts as my family, namely Andromeda Black Tonks and her grandson, the (other) apple of my eye, my godson, Edward ‘Teddy’ Lupin.
I’m still excited that you cast a non-corporeal Patronus, on literally your first go at properly trying. That’s so impressive, Draco, and proves that you’ve got that good heart that I’ve known you had since we first began in these diaries. I saw it on your face, my dear; I saw the very moment that you felt the emotions of your memories rather than just replaying them.
Answer me this, Draco Malfoy: how does the world have the audacity to keep ticking along after the experience that you and I shared? I don’t know how to say what I feel, how to give it the justice it deserves… It’s as if everything is somehow different but the rest of the world hasn’t caught up.
“Lyon,” you said, your voice quiet. I noticed that you couldn’t meet the Auror’s face; I wondered then what quasi-legal negotiation techniques the Ministry had already used on you. “That’s where she was travelling to, the last time we spoke.” You swallowed, your eyes flicking toward me. “We’ve… That is, the Malfoy family, we’ve got a villa there. Mother – Narcissa – wrote to me a few weeks ago… She told me that she’d arranged with her Case-Auror to go to Lyon for a short while. Mother, she- Mother wrote that there were a few issues with the transferral of the property deeds from my Fath- from Lucius Malfoy.” You fidgeted in your chair and, just for a short moment, looked very young. “The French wizarding authorities don’t allow homes to be held by… by overseas prisoners.”
family – your aunty and your cousin – but you’ll have to allow me this indulgence. It isn’t often that I get to show off the love of my life like I did today, and Merlin, were you a hit.
“Must have been a bloody shock,” Ron said. “After all, it wasn’t like there’d been much love between you in years gone past!”
‘Mione told me that she wants to be well prepared, but I don’t think I could enjoy my final months of eighth-year if I knew my nose would be shoved straight back to the grindstone. Ron is nearly as bad. He was trying to work out the right incantation for a tongue-tie truth spell but couldn’t quite get it correct. “Still think you would have made a good Auror,” he told me glumly. “Dunno what I’m going to do without you two beside me.”
They are not deficiencies, but instead they are defiance. They tell me, and the whole rest of the world, that you might not be perfect, but that you have survived. They tell your story of survival through horrible, terrifying circumstances, and how you’ve recovered enough to open your heart and love me, the very person who inflicted those wounds. You are more beautiful and stronger than you've ever been, and I’m in awe of you for that. You were broken, but you were brought back to life, just like I was. Tomorrow, when you read this, you’ll scoff at my purple prose, but I do think that we are soulmates, two shattered shards that only together make some semblance of perfection.
“That’s how you got together, right?” Dean asked, looking like he wanted to say something or ask something. Only when we were on our way to the Hospital Wing did he speak again. “Do you still have to write in it?”
I wasn’t having you sleeping our week away, darling, and so I turned in your arms, leaning down to kiss you. Fuck, you looked splendid. You hadn’t used a shaving spell since we’d arrived, and your face was rougher than I was used to. I rubbed my face over it, loving your masculinity and the coarse friction between our chins.
But I shall try and focus on my lesson now. I must live up to my reputation as a brainy sod, after all, or else Hermione will start to see me as the randy roué that I am. Which in turn might lose me Ron’s consent.
And you sat up between my arched legs, your lubed up hand on my prick, my balls, my pucker. This sounds kind of stupid, but I watched you looking at me. You lifted my leg further up, spreading my cheeks, and you just looked there for a moment, your pupils fixated on that most private part of mine, and I didn’t feel an ounce of shame. I would’ve let you study my body as long as you had wanted, Harry.
I can hardly believe that the date is finally here, and that you and I get to go home. I know it’s early, ridiculously early, but I’m far too giddy to sleep. I’m sitting in my bed, the
And your mum: is she a very powerful witch? A Seer or a person who knows the Old Magic? What you said about her in your last letter really piqued my curiosity and I would genuinely love to know her opinion. My St Mungo’s Healer – a fellow called Braithwaite – is excellent (though terribly full of his own self-importance) and I know he has been searching through some ancient old tomes in search of a complete cure for my uncontainable magic. Braithwaite says it is a very ancient sorcery that has affected me and that it may be years before I’m fully able to self-regulate myself.
Imagine how it’ll feel, Draco, when you’re pushing inside of me for the very first time. It’ll be so good for you, love, so tight, hot and intimate. I was saving this to tell you in person, but I find right now that I cannot wait. Last night I fingered myself and pretended that my hands were yours. I spread wet, conjured lube all around my entrance, and then I pushed my finger inside the heat of my tight pucker.
My darling. I can hear the sound of Atkinson and Waters, at last returned from the cells. It’s finally time for me to leave this blasted, horrible place and come back to school, and back to you. I can’t wait. I’m famished, exhausted and I crave both your presence and your touch. As soon as I return, I’ll hurry to the Hospital Wing.
I’ve heard that the Dragon Sanctuary over in Romania is worth a visit and the Egyptian Pyramids are really extraordinary too. Some of those Pharaohs were really powerful wizards, weren’t they? My magic is usually pretty consistent – perhaps a touch unruly since the war – so I expect that I’d still be able to feel the age-old magic thrumming through me, were I to visit. I’d have to whip up some sun protection potion or else I’d definitely get burnt. Pity you can’t come with me. I’m sure with all your travel experience you know all the translation charms.
I realised how rarely I inquired after her and Teddy. I’m sorry, Harry. I think I’m panicking, and it might be one of those things that I’m blissfully ready to shield away from my consciousness. I don’t know what she thinks about me and my family used to pretend that she doesn’t even exist.
“I don’t feel like I fit in here anymore,” was one of the very first things I said to you, and those words still ring true today.
If I think back – and I am now – most of crushes have been about the people themselves. I don’t want to sully my so far very enjoyable night by talking about my poisonous family but the very worst thing that they ever did was make me feel like I was worth less than every other person on the face of the earth. As a result, I fell into a bad habit of getting into relationships with anyone who paid me even the slightest bit of attention.
You’ve been mentioning Malfoy: it is hard to see past the Dark Mark, isn’t it? I mean, he doesn’t show it off or something, but everyone simply knows it’s there. And it will stay there as a permanent reminder of his nefarious acts. Please don’t laugh about my peculiar juxtaposition but I just thought how the Dark Mark is quite a grotesque caricature of the lightning bolt scar on the golden boy’s forehead.
After that we had tea – fancy patisserie and some sandwiches – which, as I shamelessly admit, rendered all three of us rather lazy. Long story short, darling, we switched the wireless on and stayed in, and we listened to some funny stories about the seventies.
Kissing you on the Quidditch Pitch felt so vivid that it almost felt like a vision, or a memory of something that hadn’t happened yet. It was more than a mere fantasy.
Your prick stood to attention, gigantic and lovely, glistening with a drop of precome at the tip. The underside of it was so soft, Draco, and I stroked you, unable to understand how I was lucky enough to be with you like this. Your skin felt delicate, and I heard your breath catch. Giving you a couple of nice firm squeezes was too hard to resist.
For a small moment, I thought there’d be angry words – it was obvious that Gins felt uncomfortable, I could read that on her face – but then she seemed to shake off her upset. “I read Luna’s article,” she said, and I watched as she shoved her hands deep into her pockets and sighed. “She writes beautifully, and…yeah. She made some decent points.” Ginny nodded slowly. I wasn’t sure she was going to speak again but then she did. “What she wrote about you deserving to be happy, Harry? She was right… And if this – if being with Draco – is what’ll do that, then good luck to you.” Gins quirked you a half-smile and shook her head. “The pair of you? Luna’s correct. You’re a matched set. Can’t believe that I never noticed before.”
But Circe, Grimmauld Place is of arcane beauty, isn’t it? And when we roamed the rooms together today, I wasn’t the only one to discover new things.
article with that alleged interview of his, remember? Aries delivered me a letter the other day, in which Blaise asked for my forgiveness yet again. This time, he tried to explain how he thought that there was no harm in mentioning a homosexual relationship when I already was openly gay, and that he, at the time, had been relieved and hoped the interview would help the matter become acceptable, even in polite society.
It’s not the case that my parents were always fighting though. Especially when I was younger, they kissed a lot when no one was watching – or so they thought. They are very private people. Sometimes I see Hogwarts students practically humping each other in the corridors and that kind of display of affection has never been for my parents. They did that quietly and mostly behind closed doors, I assume, but they sometimes caught my eye, kissing and whispering to each other. Mother once told me that they wanted to have another child but looks like that never worked out for some reason.
Now that I’ve heard out Slughorn’s thoughts on it, and now that I’m holding some flyers, booklets, and information in my hands, this all seems doable. Not only that – I know for certain that I will start a business sometime this year. Late autumn or early winter. And until then, we will have a brilliant time together, Harry.
I’ve just read back through my letters to you, and yes, I see you’re correct. I've often said I don’t want to discuss the people that brought me up. I wasn’t ever trying to hold you at wand's length. That wasn’t my intention.
But dear Merlin, I’m so glad you enjoyed that, for I had no idea what I was doing. My fingers rather moved on their own, trying to adjust to your sweet, desperate huffs and movements. Reading your ardent words makes my heart swell with silly pride.
I’ve decided that I need to say all this aloud, rather than writing it down. I’m too likely to overthink things when I’m writing to you and evade the truth of what I really want to say. I want to be honest, as far as I can.
“Up,” I said, and we laughed like some bloody Second-Years, for we were reminded of brooms when I meant your hips. We had you out of your pants and finally, I had you naked underneath me. It felt so much better and so much more overwhelming than I had dreamt of. Without thinking about it, I mimicked you and closed my hand around your sturdy cock, starting to stroke your length firmly.
