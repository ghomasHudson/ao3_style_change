I'd go first. I'll use the Sickle to warn you if it's okay to travel this way. No means that something terrible has gone wrong. Yes will mean you can go through and everything is alright. If I don't reply in 10 minutes it also means that something terrible has gone wrong." Draco said, holding up the silver coin.
"Alright. You have a point." Draco sighed. "But, it's not really that hard to pass O.W.Ls. I have connections. My father is a ministry worker. Anyways, if all else goes wrong, I'll probably pass Defense Against the Dark Arts." Draco argued. Harry shook his head in disbelief.
Harry looked at the three of them. There was no arguing against them. One against three was a hopeless battle.
"I told you I'd jinx anyone who tried to mess with you." Ron reminded. "Anyways I owe you one. You saved my dad."
"Obviously not, or else you would be paying attention in class, Potter. " Snape sneered. Harry stayed silent.
Harry looked beside him and sure enough, there was Draco with blond hair and slytherin robes, passed out beside him.
While Umbridge and Filch were busy dealing with the trouble Fred and George caused, Harry and Draco snuck off to empty classrooms together.
Draco finally finished what he was writing, and rest his quill in the ink jar. Harry was surprised when Draco handed it over to show him the list.
"Detention for lying - You make such unbelievable lies I'm astonished on how your simple little mind thought I wouldn't see through that. I expect you to see me after class."
"You'll need to stay overnight... something went wrong when healing your arm. I think it may have something to do with what happened in your second year. But, it should be healed by tomorrow." Madam Pomfrey said before heading out the door.
Draco's chest was now ice cold. His eyes closed as he gave a final breath. His heart was silent. The clock stopped.
"That's what I thought." Hermione said, looking down and biting her lip. Draco didn't get up to prove her wrong. And that's how Harry was certain everything was going downhill.
"I need to apologise to Hermione." Draco muttered, his voice still quavering. His eyes were red and his face tear streaked.
Snape has made no sign of recognition. When he left, Umbridge was becoming desperate to get answers out of Harry. To the point where she threatened him with the Cruciatus Curse.
On the floor, in front of the veil, was Draco, thrashing. A Death Eater cackled as he kept his wand on Draco pointed to Draco. In shock, Harry dropped the Prophecy in his hands, the glass crashing to the ground. The Death Eater looked up at him, anger and shock flooding his expression. Wisps of air came up from the smashed orb, but Harry could not make out any words above Draco's screams.
"Come on Harry. " Draco pleaded to him. Harry took his hand as Draco lead them out of the room. Before they closed the door, Hermione  marked the door, a red slash across it.
Harry sighed. "You have definitely gotten better, I've got to admit. " Harry wanted to change the subject.
"I've been thinking..." Harry began nervously. Draco looked up seriously. "Maybe you should focus more on getting good scores on your O.W.Ls."
"Who's going to  volunteer to go first?" Draco asked, grabbing the jar of flew powder and holding it out.
Harry was curious to see what Draco drew, though. If someone spends hours on doing something, then it's worth being seen.
"A what?" He asked him. It occurred to Harry that bucket lists were probably only popular with Muggles.
" Hermione, you're the best witch I know. Look at him, he's looking so much better now. You've saved him." Harry smiled at her. Hermione gave him a small smile back.
The door handle clicked to unlock several times before entered a hooded man and a python slithering beside him. The man's cloak swished behind him and Harry could see his eyes from under his hood. Red slits. Cold and emotionless.
Harry stopped in his tracks and turned to look at him. Malfoy grabbed the back of his neck and looked down at the dark cobblestone floor.
"Not so fast, Potter. Not only was I the one who asked you on this date, but I was the one who brought you to this coffee shop. It's only fitting that
"It's not any of your business." Malfoy shot. Before his face went the slightest soft. "So I suppose it's none of mine to know about your intentions either."
They researched through stacks of books on curses and counter curses. They barely spoke to each other other then to share each other's findings. Harry felt like they were there for hours.
"Thank you." Draco politely nodded to Hagrid as he walked. Hagrid gave him a surprised smile and returned the nod before closing the door behind them.
"Jesus Christ, Potter. Don't you ever listen?! I told you. We're working on your essay. Forget about the curse for today."
That's good, Harry. I'm glad you took my words into consideration."  Hermione gave him a small smile. She got up and got the book which was resting on a  nearby shelf, hidden behind dusty knickknacks.  "We just need a fire place."
Lucius looked to his son. Draco reached out for Harry's hand again. Harry grasped it. Draco was shaking.
Outside the sun was nowhere to be seen and the birds had yet to begin singing their morning melodies. Harry looked at the clock on the bed side table. 3am
"Hey Harry." Said Ron, looking at the shelves. "This one has your name on it." Harry went over and looked at the glass orb Ron was referring to. He picked it up. It was warm.
Draco was becoming almost completely bedridden. He was getting sick, and couldn't keep down more than two meals a day.  He was deteriorating in front of Harry's eyes.
Harry felt more relaxed to see a more familiar Draco laying there. Not that he lied when he said Draco in drag was pretty, but the disco ball that he'd become was overwhelming and he was sure Draco would be displeased to wake up to smudged make-up and tangled hair.
"BLOOD TRAITORS, FILTH! I AM DISGUSTED! I AM REVOLTED! I DEDICATE ALL MY LIFE TO THE PURITY OF THIS FAMILY AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET!"
They walked towards Hagrids, taking the long route, as to not be seen. Draco complained the entire time.
"Oh." Malfoy looked up from the book. "The date in my mind is July 31st, 1996. The day I supposedly die."
Harry was trying his hardest though but he was so distracted from everything that'd happened in the past few days that he kept on grabbing the wrong ingredients and stirring the potion in the wrong direction. Hermione would notice and try to correct him, but she had to work on her own potion and he did it too often for her to correct him.
"Of course- The Golden Boy won't stand to have this on his record." Malfoy sneered. "Of course you'd want to keep your reputation pure as possible. You wouldn't want people to find out that The Boy Who Lived used a killing incantation."
"Fuck your father. He's a trash person. After the school year ends you'll never have to see him again, mark my words."
"Oh, its a list of things you want to do before you die. You write it down and try to accomplish everything you wrote down while you still can." Harry explained.
"Oh, Harry, don't look like that, I'm sorry... But it's true though. I haven't been looking any better, have I?"
There were times when they both obviously wanted to kiss but they wouldn't, because they didn't want to interrupt their conversation. They just settled to holding hands across the table. Draco's hands didn't seem to warm up, which concerned Harry. So he held them tighter.
"I dunno mate this seems kinda fishy to me... Maybe he's faking? I don't see how this could be possible. Without any knowledge of this 'curse' nor a wand to cast it. It just seems unlikely." Ron suggested.
Harry's dream of the corridor continued. It frustrated Harry. He just wanted to know what was behind that stupid door.
Ron piped in. "Harry, if you ever get expelled we'd take you in in a heartbeat. Mum wouldn't stand to let you live with those prick muggles of yours. But that aside, Harry, I think you're right. You could get in lots of trouble for all that. Maybe we shouldn't turn it in..."
Pretty soon, the room had a lighthearted feel and everyone was feeling cheery. The few Patronuses people managed to produce pranced around the room.
"Hello, Potter." the familiar voice of Draco Malfoy spoke softly behind him. Harry turned to look at him, with slight surprise. Malfoy's usually neat blond hair was slightly unkempt.
" Hello Harry. Ron and I were just discussing the idiocy, riskiness, and foolishness of last night." Hermione said, her mouth forming a thin line. "Care to join us?"
. Apparently to cast it a person who was derive from magical blood has to read it in their native language and whomever that wizard first makes eye contact with next becomes the victim of the curse and is sentenced to a slow death whilst the caster of the curse gets their heart's desire."
people get abandoned by people they trusted!" Draco raised his voice and he aimed his wand at Harry, shooting several jets of red light at Harry, who put up a shield charm.
Harry quickly disarmed the Death Eater, sending him flying to the wall. A look of shock froze on the Death Eater's face before he dropped like a rag doll to the ground, unconscious.
"He's being tortured as we talk, Hermione. No one from the Order is left at Hogwarts. We need to help him!"
"Alright. Although it's not like this list will be laying around anywhere. If anyone finds it everyone in the D.A. will not be in the best of times. But just because you asked, I'll do it. Anyways I might be able to keep the jinx in place even after removing his name..."
Soon enough, Draco acted as though he'd never spoke more than insults to Harry. But rather then the teasing and snarkyness Draco had given him in the past years, Draco acted through rage and pettiness.
"No- I mean. Aren't you worried about people seeing you alone with a boy here on Valentine's Day. People might think..."
Lucius turned swiftly. "Crucio." He bellowed. The death eater writhed in pain, his screams filling the air. While the Death Eaters were faced the other direction, Harry slipped the orb to Draco. Draco slipped it carefully in his pocket. Several wands shot up at Lucius, but the man ignored them. He looked at Draco.
"Who cares what people think? It doesn't matter if people know I'm dating a guy. Anyone already thinks I'm insane anyways, thanks to the Daily Prophet." Harry shrugged. "Just enjoy yourself. I love you, okay?" Harry coaxed. Draco began to slightly relax.
"You know what to do." She said and she walked over to her desk. Harry sat by the window and took out parchment.
Snape stepped in. Umbridge demanded vertasium from him. Snape claimed he had no more in stock. Harry realised he had been stupid. Snape was a part of the Order.
They closed their eyes for a second, and when they open them, there was a stone fireplace in the center of the wall, burning a roaring orange flame.
"There's a 99% chance that there is no cure to this vile curse. I just...I Just don't want to spend the remainder of my life working my arse off to find that one percent. I don't want to waste the rest of my life looking trying to get away from this when I could be doing things I've always wanted to do but never had the chance. When I could be spending the rest of my life actually
"It is. I have to be careful, putting the the ingredients in the right order, stirring the right direction and the right amount of time. If I mess this up we have no idea what effects it could have. Now, if you'll excuse me I need to concentrate."
Harry walked around more, and he noticed Draco nearly had it. He came up from behind, gently placing his hands on Draco's shoulders.
Harry felt tears building up into his eyes. He tried to hold them back with a shudder. Malfoy came to his senses and turned towards him.  Pure rage infested his expression.
"Okay but the only reason she didn't have to leave was because Dumbledore stopped her. And if you haven't noticed, Dumbledore is no longer here." Draco reminded them.
Harry chuckled. He half expected Draco to run off. But Draco just looked curiously into Harry's eyes.
"Nonsense, Harry. 16 is a very important year. I'll bake a cake and I can invite a few of your friends over."
" That, Potter is none of your business. Take your nose out of it or you'll end up not having one at all."
"You love him, don't you? Draco." Hermione asked, her expression almost sympathetic. Harry's heartrate quickened.
When they got there, they payed no attention to old building. Harry wrapped his arm around Draco's waist, bringing him closer. Draco smiled his charming smile at Harry.
"Because I have a reputation, Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Anyways you should get to your dormitory, its late. I'll meet you at lunch at that weird twisty tree we met by the other day - the one by the lake. And forget about the curse rubbish, well work on research another day. I'd like to make sure Professor Snape doesn't give you trouble."
"You are the absolute worst. Why are you the way that you are? Every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way." Draco said with a huff. Harry just laughed harder.
"Hold on. No." Harry said, processing what Draco was saying. " you can't go to the ministry with us! You'll get hurt-Voldemort- what if something happens to you?" Harry's words came out anxious and panicked.
Ron and Hermione talked to Draco a lot too. Trying to bring up lighthearted conversations like quidditch. Small talk mostly. To get their minds off the dread.
"Hermione, the ministry nearly had him expelled because he defended himself from a Dementor. They'd ravish at an opportunity to throw him in Azkaban, whether it was an accident or not. We can't risk that." Ron told her.
Harry sat up and turned to see an angry, red eyed Malfoy looking down at him, quickly wiping his face.
"Dumbledore wanted you to clear your mind for a reason!" Said Hermione shrilly. "You shouldn't be letting him in your head. It could be a trap!"
"I promise I won't." Ron swore. Hermione's expression softened, content with getting the message in.
"Er..." Harry shuffled his feet. "People who are already in this club most likely won't take it too well that you're joining... you don't carry the best reputation..."
"Can't be any worse than what I've got going for me now." Draco shrugged and gulped the potion, plugging his nose.
Harry heard a crash behind him. Hermione has toppled an entire shelf of the orbs onto the oncoming Death Eaters. Glass exploded everywhere, tiny shards hitting Harry's back.
"I know that you... want to get revenge on the person who did this. I know you want to make them pay for it. But you shouldn't."
He turned quickly so that his robes swished with him  and exited the restricted section, leaving Harry standing there, thinking an abundance of thoughts about what he had done.
He brushed off his constant stalling of D.A. meetings as an attempt to give the members a break before the Holidays. Really, it was an attempt to avoid seeing Draco.
The sun was up and shining and it was a beautiful day. But Harry was exhausted, and all day he'd been struggling to stay awake in his classes.
the best house. Cause it is the best house. In case you didn't know." Draco gave a sly smile and Harry rolled his eyes.
"Harry... will you please tell me what's going on between you and Draco?" She asked quietly as they looked through their textbooks.
"It's my favourite spot. Remember when you were trying to find me so you asked Hermione and she told you I'd probably be there and you found me there and we talked."
Harry was pleased that no one seemed to see through Draco's disguise. The lack of attention they got from people relaxed Draco. They were like a normal couple.
"Yeah. Not that I celebrate Valentine's day. Capitalism built off of infatuation is what it really is. Valentine's day wasn't even supposed to be about love, if anyone actually researched..." Draco was rambling quickly, from obvious nervousness.
"What we're trying to say is. We feel like you've been almost ignoring us for him. And I hope you understand why that upsets us." Hermione said nervously.
Harry wondered where Hermione learned that spell and why. Then he looked at Ron, past out in his bunk and back to Draco and he knew why.
Draco leaned and pressed his mouth to his for a moment. Harry wished he didn't have to go. Then he remembered something. He reached over to his bag, which was difficult when one of his arms was in a sling.
"Fuck, Harry. Fuck fuck fuck." A familiar voice called to him, horrified. Harry couldn't will himself to move, no matter how hard he tried. His brain felt fuzzy. The pain masked everything. And  everything went black.
"Have you two gone mad? That book is extremely dangerous! What if someone gets their hands on it? Like a Death Eater, or Voldemort? In third year Harry's god father managed sneak inside the school into the Gryffindor common room multiple times to try and kill Ronald's rat. I wouldn't put it a past a Death Eater to try and get their hands on that book... And now Malfoy knows that book exist and has become victim of it- I'm positive he has connections. Anyways, Harry I'm sure the fact that you're turning in the book and exposing Umbridge will out weigh all the rules you broke. Anyways Dumbledore might be able to figure out how to reverse the curse!"
All was well. For a few days. Hermione woke him up one morning, one of her schoolbooks in her arms. Her expression was almost... broken. Panic jumped to Harry's throat and he felt a weight in his chest.
"Ah nothing, just declining rapidly into an ailing state and counting down the days to my inevitable death." Draco replied casually. Harry frowned and looked down.
But then a high pitched cackle rang through the air, the haunting voice of the mad woman. Before Harry had time to process what was going on, a flash of green light passed through the air.
"We're going to the Forbidden Forest?! It's Forbidden for a reason you know." Panic made his voice higher.
"He wants to apologize to everyone. I really think this could end up with him on a better foot with nearly everyone." Harry told her. Hermione gave him a reluctant nod. Ron only snorted.
"That's- that's rad." Ron said, struggling to word it. "I mean, he's mellowed our recently... I guess he has changed a bit... it's not too different from you being best friends... I never expected... but- I totally support you." Ron finished firmly, giving him a sure smile.
Harry heard snickering again from Malfoy in the corner of the class. Harry rolled his eyes and ignored him. Snape paid no attention to Malfoy either, which slightly frustrated Harry. But Harry felt a bit guilty for being frustrated because he had cursed Malfoy not too long ago. But Snape didn't know that, so why should he give Malfoy special treatment?
"Bellatrix Lestrange." Draco replied quietly. Harry felt fury raise up in him like a pot boiling over.
Draco hesitated. Just then the door to the room  opened, and Harry hopped up with his wand, guarding Draco.
"You should probably shouldn't go anywhere alone." Ron advised. "I know you have wicked defence skills but, I mean, look what happened today."
"A curse?!? But how? You hadn't known anything about the incantation and you hadn't even pulled your wand out!" Hermione spoke.
"One more for the road?" Draco asked with pleading eyes. Harry brushed Draco's hair away from his eyes. He pressed his lips to Draco's once more. The same sparks. But it didn't last as long. He didn't want Draco to get in trouble.
"That scumbag. I forgot about him. He's knocked unconscious... I obliviated him but I'm not sure how strong it was. If he wakes up..."
Harry realized the friendship he had with Draco was special and he wanted focus on it for as long as he could. He wanted to laugh with him, to talk to him, to know him, before it ended up being  too late and Draco was gone.
"Come on Harry, do you really have that little faith in us? Two against one. And I caught him by surprise." Draco told him.
But then, they found it. The room was bright, glass twinkling around them.  Tall shelves filling up the large space. Rows and Rows.. their footsteps echoed through the room. They were silent, their wands held out in front of them.
"You have to take the Prophecy." Draco said, reaching into his pocket with his other hand. He handed Harry the warm orb. "You can't let them have it. This is the only thing that will stop them from harming you."  Harry pocketed the orb.
"No Harry, I'm sorry. But it's important. I don't care if you bring him along just be there. It'll only last an hour or so." Hermione insisted. Harry did not argue. He knew Hermione probably had good reason. Didn't mean Harry had to like it.
"Hey. Quit it. She's just as good as a pure blooded wizard. Even better. Muggleborns aren't less then purebloods. Muggles, aren't people you should shame either. How people are born should't determine who they are as people." Harry said, looking at Malfoy coldly.
"Pull yourself together, Potter. We need to figure this out before my father finds out what's happened."
"I'm going to do this again. Stand back." He warned Harry. And he repeated the process, emptying the box in his mouth. He had the look of pure regret as he chewed them, swallowing them yet again.
They reached the door that Harry had longed to open ever since it had  first appeared in his dreams months ago. He took the knife that Sirius had given to him, and used it to unlock the door.
Harry paused when he heard a creak. He froze for a second and then proceeded to quickly pull the invisibility cloak over him. He looked at the map and was surprised at the name he saw walking towards the restricted section.
"Thanks." He said. " I can't believe that out of something so bad formed something so good and unexpected."
And then it was just Harry and Draco. Harry carried him back up the stairs. The large window of the room was open. The night was clear. They lay in the bed together, facing each other, holding each others hand for comfort.
Umbridge hurried off to find more students. Once she was out of sight, Draco loosened his grip. He pretended to wrangle Harry, and leaned to his ear.
doing my prefect duties." He answered. "You should hurry on to bed, Potter. People might think you're getting into trouble."
"I'm not giving up, Harry. I'm just focusing my time on other things. My art, my reading, and...well, my relationships." He made eye contact with Harry and he felt heat rushing to his face. Harry looked away.
They pulled apart and Harry brushed his thumb against Draco's cheek. He never wanted to loose him. Draco, an artist. Making art with his words, with his hands, with his voice. Draco so who was so strong. So charming to everyone. So genuine with Harry. So Brave.
"...Sure..." Draco hesitated. "But not anywhere where people can see us... I don't want people knowing we're friends."
Harry tried to but he didn't want to do anything. He rarely left Draco's side though. Draco would insist that Harry get himself water or at least a snack.
Harry walked over towards the twisty tree in which Malfoy was sitting under, writing in a journal he carried in his hands. His hair fell in front of his eyes as he wrote, deep in concentration. Harry almost didn't want to bother him. Almost.
"How come I've never seen you before?" The boy asked, pointing to Draco.  Harry froze, but Draco played it off cooly.
"What I'm wondering is how Malfoy already knew about such a curse. He certainly knew more then the book said or else Harry woulve known what he was doing in the first place." Hermione looked at the two of them, thinking hard.
Now that Umbridge was at the school, he had to be weary of his surroundings and extra careful not to get caught. The ghosting pain from his last detention with that wretched woman still stung his hand.
He went to into the boys bathroom, to the sinks. He looked at himself in the mirror, his expression flustered and distressed. He turned on the sink and splashed some water on his face.
"If you ever wondered what the Gryffindor Boys dormitory looked like, well here it is." Harry said awkwardly. Draco wrinkled his nose.
"Well, Hagrid, I should probably explain some things." Harry said awkwardly. Hagrid nodded, clumsily getting out tea mugs.
"You're going the wrong way." Harry laughed and Draco turned and started walking the other direction, an annoyed look on his face.
"I'm alright." Harry said sheepishly. He looked to Mrs. Weasley. "Would you like some help with that, Mrs. Weasley?" Harry asked her, looking at the pot.
"What, I'm just curious! He's a Gryffindor, I can tell by his scarf. Could you at least tell me what year he's in?" Ron asked. Harry wasn't sure whether or not to tell him about Draco. He looked at Hermione for help. She nodded.
"Oh, and Hargrid." Bane spoke again. "Let the creature return with his species. He does not belong here. You should not have brought him here." Then he turned back into the trees before Hagrid could reply.
Everyone worked on that spell and practice previous spells for the rest of the meeting. After the meeting was over, Draco stayed behind to speak with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"Don't be too quick to trust him." Sirius warned him. Harry's mind flashed to Peter Pettigrew. He shook the thought away.
"Get out! All of you, just leave!" Draco said furiously. "Since you can't seem to let the subject go, just leave!"
"Maybe you haven't looked hard enough." Draco said with a snark. She rolled her eyes and the portrait flung open. Harry had thought it'd be trickier than this and was quite relieved. They climbed through.
reverse the curse?" Hermione's eyes widened, "Is it already too late? Is Malfoy... Dead? Already? Goodness please tell me that's not the case..."
Draco looked at him with wonder. "I never thought anyone would tell me that, to be honest." He gave a small chuckle. "In most situations I would think you'd be lying or kidding... But for some reason It doesn't seem like you are. I think it's in your eyes, honesty. It's very comforting but at the same time very unnerving."
"We can go." Harry told Ron and Hermione. Hermione stepped up next. And then Harry followed after her.
"You have no business knowing what I'm doing here. And I know you've done something. What have you done to me? What have you done!? My head feels like a thousand knives are stabbing at it. What the bloody hell Potter?!"
Malfoy and Harry had put (most) of their bickering aside for the day to research everything they could. Malfoy made sure to remind Harry that he would get weaker as time progressed and they needed to get as much done as possible before Malfoy was too weak to help him.
"We don't know if he's actually there, that's my point!" Hermione yelled. She paused, collecting herself. "If you can prove that Sirius isn't at Grimmuald Place, then I swear I'll help you. I'll go to the Ministry with you. I swear." Hermione promised.
"Oh, god. Well... I wanted to play with the muggle kids. I felt very alone, constantly, and all I wanted was to have friends. I tried to talk to them, but my father- Oh he wouldn't have it. He dragged me back into they Manor and slapped me right across the face. He told me if I ever spoke to the muggles again, I would regret it significantly. From then on, he taught me that all muggles are filthy and deserve no place in this world, and Wizards born of muggle blood were no different." Malfoy looked down sadly. Harry stayed silent.
"Alright. Sure. But Gryffindor's head of house is Professor McGonagall. Your head of house is Snape the Slime Ball'.  I think that's enough said. Gryffindor easily beats Slytherin." Harry said smugly.
"That's what I said! But then he told me about the incantation i was reading. He said it shouldn't be in the restricted section because it shouldn't even be at
Draco was cold. It wasn't just his hands anymore. The cold seemed to have spread through his arms and his face. It was Summer. Draco's cold skin cooled Harry down when he lay with him. But it concerned Harry. A lot.
"Fine, then. I see. Well, Potter. Goodbye." He spat, and turned swiftly, and he was gone in seconds.
"If you throw up on the floor of Flitwik's classroom while he's out sick, then you'll get detention. So don't."
"We'd know who did it because he'd be the only member of the D.A. who hadn't gotten the backlash of whatever jinx you put on the contract."
"How'r we supposed to get to the ministry?" Ron asked. Harry realised he didn't have a plan. He didn't think he'd get this far.
They met by the tree ten minutes later. It was still pretty early in the afternoon, as classes had lasted shorter then expected for some unknown reason. The schedules had been a bit weird this year, and classes went on shorter then expected some days, and longer other day. Harry suspected it was Umbridge's doing.
"Sirius Black? The escaped convict?" Draco asked. Harry realized he had yet to explain to Draco about his godfather.
"Well, I saw Ron's dad being attacked by a giant snake and so i ended up spending alot of my time at St. Mungos." Haryry said.
"I'm sorry, Harry..." Hermione said as she picked up her books to leave. "We'll see you in Umbridge's class..." Hermione said and left with Ron out the door.
" That's a good list - and if you keep thinking of things to add, keep adding. If you do something on the list, cross it off. And if you end up not achieving some of the things on the list, then that's alright cause not everyone achieve what they want to in life and that's okay."
!" Draco yelled. The spell hit Bellatrix square in the chest and she fell over. When her head hit the floor she fell unconscious.
"We have warned you time and time again, not to come through our forest, yet you still return?" Bane's tone was fierce and angry. Draco clung to Harry's arm, and whispered into his ear.
"No. Of course not. But I won't kiss you when you're drunk. It'd be taking advantage of you and I will never do that." Harry explained, softly playing with his hair.
He had told Hermione about his vision, and as he'd expected, she tried to persuade him to go to Dumbledore. Harry told her he would, although he knew he wouldn't.
"We've got Luna coming over on Tuesday for your birthday. And the family will be there too, of course. I know you weren't looking for a party, but a get together would be cozy." Mrs. Weasley said.
A door would appear and Harry would run through it, only to see Malfoy standing there each time. He was trapped in this never ending maze until he awoke.
"This essay that I'm assigning you better exceed my expectations, else you will regret ever coming into my class again. Three feet of parchment, no less."
Draco and Ron soon caught onto what Hermione was doing. And the surfacing Death Eaters were hit with smashed orbs from every direction, as the four of them brought down the shelves.
"I'm fine- I just need to step out for a second... I left something in the common room." Harry said and quickly left the great hall.
Harry climbed through the portrait hole to the Gryffindor common room. Ron and Hermione were there waiting anxiously, but Harry's light expression seemed to make them relax.
Harry was in a bad mood for all of class. He messed up his potion and had to start over three times. Snape was especially upset at him today, and kept yelling at him to stop being stupid and pay attention to what he was doing.
"Er... Okay then... Well. I think Hagrid might be able too help with the nausea. He just recently came back." Harry suggested.
Through it was  a circular room full of doors. Once all four of them had crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them, the room began to spin around them. Harry did not remember this in his vision of Sirius.
Harry became more tense. He thought of something. "If it really is Umbridge trying to curse me with the book, well, she doesn't know where it is. And we took the Latin version of the spell off her desk. She's probably on to us." Harry concluded, looking up at Ron. "This really isn't good."
"What are you apologizing for?" Hermione asked.  Harry wasn't sure. Maybe it was because he'd kept it hidden. Or that he was ashamed. Wait, no. Ashamed wan't the right word. He was far from ashamed. He wished he could stop hiding everything away. Afraid was the right word. He was afraid that his friends would be ashamed. But that was a stupid fear. Obviously Hermione and Ron wouldn't be ashamed.
"Well, I know you're on a long journey. I think it's important to remember, wherever you go, go with all your heart." Luna quoted, giving Draco a gentle smile before wandering back off into the party.
"Well who is it then?" Zacharias Smith yelled out from the crowd. Everyone looked at Harry for an answer.
He wasn't sure how to react to that. Malfoy had said some terrible things in the past. And although he wasn't going to let the curse take his life without a fight, Harry wasn't sure how he'd ever even begin to trust Malfoy. How he'd ever let go of the things he'd said and done to him and his friends. And that's why Harry was unsure of whether he should start considering him as a friend or as a player he had wounded in a silly game of rivalry that was never intended to cause fatal harm.
Weasley? Ron was the one who saved him. Harry felt gratitude towards his best friend. Harry folded the letter up and pocketed it. He wished Draco could be there with him, but he knew why he couldn't.
"I'm not as... strong as I used to be. I get too exhausted too quickly. I figured it would be better for the team if they found someone else." Draco explained.
Harry rushed to escape the sickly-sweet fumes of her office. His hand was still bleeding from the inhuman punishment, and he struggled to keep the crimson blood from dripping onto the cobblestone floor until he could manage to rinse his hand. He wrapped bandages over his hand that would only be taken off tomorrow before he saw Umbridge next.
This changed his plan. Anger and frustration surged through him. With a flick of his wand he channeled his emotions.
"Y'know." Harry started, running his hands through his unruly hair. "I'm really glad I'm here with you."
Harry dueled with the Death Eater. Spells were shot in every direction. Finally Harry was able to stun him, after the Death Eater's spell came dangerously close to his head.
The Three Broomsticks wasn't too far. They entered, and held eachother's hand as to not get separated in the crowd of people. They found Hermione sitting stiffly in the corner, already holding a Butterbeer, sitting across from a disheveled Rita Skeeter.
Harry was conflicted on how to feel about the curse now. Because, Draco was going to die because of it. Because of him, and Harry absolutely despised that. He was angry, frustrated, and upset about it. But at the same time, he never would've formed a relationship with Draco if it weren't for the curse. Never would've been able to understand his point of view, his pain.
"There are no games to be played." Harry replied calmly. "Please, Draco. Let me give you an explanation. I rekon i owe you one..."
Draco hesitated before speaking. "Can- can you kiss me?" he asked him. Without thinking about it, Harry leaned closer to Draco and pressed his lips to his. Harry didn't know what to think. All his life, he'd been told this was supposed to be wrong. But, god, it felt so right.
It was like he had just spontaneously taken the best risk ever. He wondered what Ron and Hermione would say if they knew. Half of him wanted to tell them, anxious to share the bizarre turn of events. But he was half afraid of what they'd think; what they'd say if they knew...
"I have Draco with me." Harry would say. Harry knew that if she could have a say, she would bring him back to the burrow in an instant.
The smell of coffee calmed Harry and he didn't even realise he was cold before the cold before warmth was traveling through this fingers and his face. Harry realised that Draco was still shivering. He remembered how cold his hands were and took off his scarf, wrapping it around Draco, which was slightly awkward because Draco was taller then him.
" And I know that to cast this curse, all that must occur is a person who carries magical blood in their heritage must read it out in their native language..." Malfoy looked at him straight in the eyes, a mixture of fury, anxiety and frustration laid across his face.
Hagrid stopped suddenly stopped, motioning for them to be quiet. He slung out his crossbow and aimed towards the trees. There was rustling. Draco squeezed Harry's hand.
The first face Harry saw was Sirius'. He felt surprise. But he also felt remorse. He shouldn't be here. This was Harry's fault. Had he been more thorough, like Hermione suggested, they wouldn't be here.
"No, Potter. Hand it to me." A cold, angry voice pierced from the silence, startling them all. He looked up to face the livid face of Lucius Malfoy.
He looked around the room. Tonks  was there too now, dueling with Lucius. Mad-eye, Kingsley. The members of the Order were all there, fuelling with different Death Eaters. All the Death Eaters were aiming to kill.
"What've you got there, Potter?" Malfoy pointed at book and parchment in Harry's hand before snatching it out of his grasp. Harry  tried grabbing it back, but Malfoy kept it out of his reach while he silently looked over the page.
Harry pulled Draco closer to him and Draco wrapped his arms around his neck. Their lips connected, and once again Harry felt  those brilliant sparks. Like what he drew from his wand, only it was like their souls intertwined. All Harry wanted was to be closer to Draco. Harry never imagined something could feel so gentle yet so feirce.
"We could use the Floo Network." Hermione said suddenly. "Umbridge's fireplace is connected. She hasn't been gone for long we could get through before anyone realises. Her fireplace isn't monitored either."
When it was time for everybody to to try, Harry walked around the room and helped them out. Hermione was the first person to produce a corporeal Patronus, a silver otter dancing around the room.
"You deserve love.  You deserve kindness. You deserve friend ship." He said directly to him. He reached out and wiped a tear out of the corner of Draco's eye. Draco didn't hesitate to wrap Harry into an warm embrace. Harry was surprised at first but returned the hug.
"No." Harry whispered. Lucius was accompanied by Bellatrix Lestrange. More Death Eaters puddles behind them.
Draco was taken a back for a second. "I'd say the same to you, Ron." Draco nodded. The two of them shook each others hand. Hermione had tears in her eyes when she looked at Draco.
Harry would lay with Draco a lot. Sometimes they talked. Sometimes they just listened to each others breaths and heartbeats. Harry stopped sleeping in his own bed and slept with Draco instead. They often fell asleep cuddling each other. Sometimes when he slept, Draco would adjust his position to huddle closer to Harry.
"You've done very well Draco. I'll take Potter from here. Go see if you can find more of them. Students who are out of breath. Check in the Library, the bathrooms." Umbridge directed.
Malfoy gathered his strength and stood up slowly and shakily. Harry stood there frozen, unsure of how to proceed.
"Well I can't exactly explain to you-" Harry started but the room up-roared once again. But then Luna spoke, silencing everyone.
"It's alright Harry- it'll be alright." Sirius said in relief. Harry stood up and gave his godfather a quick hug of  gratitude.
Harry...can you tell my father, my mother. I forgive them?" Draco asked quietly. Harry was surprised for a second.
His wand was held in one hand, whilst the Marauders Map was in the other, accompanied by an old piece of folded parchment with faint writing on it. The weather was still quite warm out and the Cloak felt uncomfortably heavy and it did not help that he was also accompanied with anxiety.
"I didn't really have much time to draw, with school and all, but when I do, I consider it therapeutic almost; it helps calm me down. I like only focusing on one thing for hours continuously and having something nice to look at come out of it."
"Er, well that's a story I'd rather not get into right now." Harry said awkwardly. Hagrid shook his head with an exasperated sigh.
"Goodnight." Draco nodded, a soft smile on his face. Draco turned away, silently treading to the door. Before he crossed the threshold, he gave Harry a small wave and a charming smile. Then he wrapped the cloak around himself and disappeared from view.
"Long story short, Sirius was framed by Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew had faked his own death. Sirius is my godfather." Harry summarized. "It's a long story, I'll explain more in detail later."
All the free time he'd had he'd been researching the spell he'd used in the library. But he'd had no luck at all whatsoever. Maybe once he got rest he'd be able to find at least something?
" Hi Grawp." Draco said smally. Then, without warning, Grawp reached out and grabbed Draco in his hand. Draco screeched.
care less about my reputation and ego. I just don't want you dead, Malfoy. I don't want anyone dead. I'll reverse it.  I'll do everything I   possibly can to reverse it. "
"But also Ronald does it surprise you at all? I mean it's Umbridge!" Hermione paused to think for a moment. "But Harry, have you turned it in to Dumbledore? It could be dangerous."
"You snuck a prefect into the Common Room! And on top of that, you didn't even try to stop him from getting drunk and attracting the attention of everyone in the room! As if they might not wonder why no one recognizes him as a Gryffindor. Or might recognize him as the Slytherin Seeker. Or the Slytherin who made the buttons last year. Or the Slytherin who created 'Weasley is our king'."
Inside, it was much more cozier. The windows had a clear view of the snowy village, and their was music playing softly around them, seeming to come from the ceiling. There were very little valentines decorations, which relieved Harry, who was getting tired of seeing nothing but red and pink hearts. The only decorations they had was a red rose suspended in mid air at every table. There were a few couples already there, but all of them were either Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs which surprised Harry.
"I trust Harry, he wouldn't do this if he doubted Draco Malfoy. Why shouldn't we give him a chance? People change after all. How would you like it if you tried to join, but you couldn't because of your past?" Luna said, a thoughtful and careful expression on her face. She looked around the room, not mad or upset, but almost disappointed. But for the most part she seemed unfazed, the dreamy look still caught in her eye.
"Listen to me, Harry Potter. Lie. Don't tell her anything. Pretend you're completely ignorant about everything.
"A saving people thing?" Harry asked in disbelief. "Ron's Dad, Ginny, Cedric, Sirius..." Harry was becoming frustrated. "Are you saying that it's bad to try and help people? To save their life?"
"Yeah, I wanted to know if you'd like to hang out." Harry pushed up his glasses. He felt awkward, and his face was red.
"C'mon Harry, we can work on our plans some more. And when Ron gets back from detention, we can tell him what we did." Hermione motioned for him to follow her.
pay. I'm paying." Draco declared, and before Harry could argue, he was already handing coins to the Barista.
"Your loss but I suppose photos will have the same effect." Ron shrugged, before he went over to his own bed and collapsed. His snores filled the room mere minutes later.
"Nothing. I don't want to be around you. I hate you. I can't be around you." Harry said coldly. Draco looked taken aback. Shocked. Hurt. Harry reminded himself this was necessary. He couldn't let Umbridge or Voldemort get to Draco. Harry's mind flashed to Cedric, to his parents. To Lucius being tortured. He couldn't let that happen to Draco.
"What happened?" Ron asked as Harry sat down in a comfy chair beside them. He told them a very  basic outline of everything, leaving out the kiss.
"What about you? When you cast a Patronus, what do you think about?" Draco asked him. Harry chuckled.
"You think that just because I dislike you I wouldn't care if you died? That's not how it works. You bully me, that's true. But that doesn't mean I want you dead. Life isn't something to play around with. Life is precious and special, even yours. Believe me, I've seen enough death in the past 15 years and I know that with my life it's so painfully unavoidable. But I want to see as less of it as possible. Every time another life is lost because of me, I break a little bit more. I can't bare to see you die because of this, Malfoy."
"Draco. Don't yell. Please." Harry requested calmly. Draco regained himself immediately, giving Harry a look of sorrow.
But did he really want that? Harry foresaw just an endless cycle of hurt. The Slytherin was wrong to do that to him. But was it any better to seek revenge? Instead of anger, he felt pity for the boy. He realised the Slytherin was probably hurting in his heart and in his soul. Sometimes the most insecure and broken people are the meanest.
"You rekon?" Draco looked at him incredulously and Harry realized that was not a good way to word that.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione traveled to Hagrid's hut, which was now empty, for Hagrid was on the run. When they entered they were greeted with slobbery licks from Fang, Hagrid's dog. In the kitchen a bag of dog food was knocked over, and dog food was scattered everywhere.
Harry hesitated, staring at the arc. They were calling to him. But he heard Draco's voice over them.
"But Harry, don't you see? I'd rather spend as much time as I can with you and die sooner than die later and never know you at all." He told him quietly.
. Draco hugged Harry, and they stood there, Draco softly playing with Harry's hair. embracing the warmth, the closeness. Harry didn't want to leave. He didn't want to let go, so he held him closer.
"Nope." He agreed. "So let me tell you this. My man, my main man." He started, that charming smile on his face again. Harry at him, knowing a different kind of magic made him feel so... dazzled. Was that the right word? Harry couldn't think of a better word to describe it.
"Er okay... I'm not sure what I'd be able to help with though, I mean it'd be you're list." Harry told him.
Harry collapsed into one of the comfy chairs in the common room by Ron and Hermione. He swung his bag to the side and took a deep breath. The three of them were the only ones in the Gryffindor common room.
"Alright... here goes nothing." He said, plugged his nose, and turned the beans over into his mouth like a shot glass. He chewed for second before making the most disgusted face. But he didn't spit them out, no. He kept them in his mouth until he swallowed them with a shudder.
"I need to show yeh guys somethin'. Hagrid said lowly. "Yeh can come too if yeh'd like." Hagrid looked to Draco. Draco just looked confused.
"You say yer friends with this boy now? Blimey, Harry you've really let herself go, haven't yeh now."
He hadn't talked to the two of them all day, not even in classes. After lunch, Harry and Malfoy had decided to skip the rest of their classes for the day, which Harry knew would backfire on him, especially considering one of those classes was Umbridge's. But they needed as much time as they could muster to figure out the reversal to the spell.
"How many times do I have to say it? I've already got it set out for me. It doesn't matter what happens to me." Harry took in Draco's words but he wouldn't give in that easily.
"Well i haven't exactly been the kindest to you! You? Well you don't really bother me unless I instigate you. But I - Im not a nice person, Potter, according to everyone. Nobody wants me around!"
"Whatcha writing?" Harry asked as he set his bag at the trunk of the tree. As soon as Malfoy heard his voice he shut the journal with a quick snap before looking up at Harry.
"My son. Hand me the Prophecy, and there will be no repercussions for your behaviour tonight. If you give me the Prophecy, you will be rewarded. Your betrayal will be forgotten."
Things continued to look grim at Hogwarts. Harry's temper shortened and his mood dropped. It didn't help that Harry could tell Draco's state getting worse. His hands were never warm. He grew thinner, his hair shaggier. His face became almost gaunt and shadows fell under his eyes. He was getting weaker.
"I'm just so- scared." Draco admitted. "Everyone obsessing with finding the counter curse- it makes it seem so much more real. It's actually happening. And it's coming so soon..." Draco put his head in his hands. He was trembling slightly. Harry came closer to him and put his arm around Draco. Draco embraced him and nestled his face into Harry's shirt and sobbed quietly.
"No, no, no. " Draco said. "I'm just saying that because my father is in the ministry, I'll probably end up passing. Anyways, I have gotten top marks on all my exams, only second to Granger. Even if I don't put in as much effort, I will probably still pass." Draco assured him. "Anyways. It won't even matter. I'll be gone before I'll even get to see what my marks are."
By the time he got there, though, the screaming had stopped and the curtains were already closed over the portrait. In front of the portrait was Mrs. Weasley accompanied by Ron and Hermione.
One hour later and Draco had already downed four shots of Fire-whiskey. Fred and George were cracking up as he rambled to them, talking about something to do with apples. He paused to smile and simply compliment them.
"Knock some sense into yourself if that hasn't already." She insisted and stormed back off into the Girls dormitory.
Harry didn't ponder on it. It's not like it wasn't a regular occurrence for Snape to blatantly favour the Slytherins over the Gryffindors.
All the death he'd seen in his life appeared in front of him and it felt like a knife stabbing at his gut.
He didn't want to be glad about the curse. He wasn't. But the questioning of  his own morality lingered in his mind. Did it make him a bad person to be glad he was close with Draco now, even though it was the result of a terrible curse?
"And have her put false words into his mouth? It'll do no better than what the Daily Prophet has been writing." Draco scoffed.
"No, Harry. Does it not seem odd to you that this appeared out of nowhere? Flipped directly to the page we need? We
That was the night he saved Arthur Weasley. After seeing him being attacked, through the eyes of the snake. Transported by portkey with the Weasleys, he awaited to hear news on Mr. Weasley's condition. He remembered the amount of blood an his heart sank to the pit of his stomach.
They treaded quickly through the forest, continuing back to the castle. Once they were out, Draco stopped at the outskirts of the forest, looking at the trees with a sigh. Hermione continued back to the castle, and Hagrid to his hut, leaving the two of them alone.
" Listen, Potter. We'll discuss this tomorrow. Meet me at the tree by the lake tomorrow at lunch if the weather is suitable. Bring the bloody book. I don't want to talk to anyone right now anymore, so you better get to bed Potter. You're lucky I'm exhausted, otherwise I would have hexed your arse off. Goodnight." Malfoy said sternly with a tired subtle ache in his voice.
"Wittle Dwaco thinks I won't hurt him?" Bellatrix taunted. "you're wrong. Aunty Bella will kill you. Ill tell wittle Dwaco's mummy and daddy you were killed - fighting against wee Potter. There will be no more dishonour upon our family!"
But Draco still wasn't waking up. His eyes were open but he wasn't seeing what Harry saw. He was still yelling. Harry ran to his side, feeling helpless. He felt desperate, he called for help.
"Well I mean, if she said it's important I reckon we'd better go." Draco chuckled. Harry was relieved Draco wasn't upset. "What time did she say?"
"That's great, Hermione." Harry praised. Hermione nodded proudly. To the side, Ron was struggling to produce even a whisp. Harry started to walk towards him, but before he could start to help him, Hermione already beat him to the chase.
Harry watched from afar as Draco unfolded it, Pansy Parkinson beside him. He proceeded to crumple it up, and threw it aside. He shrugged his shoulders at Pansy, his face expressionless, and continued walking.
Harry was left speechless. He'd never thought he'd see Malfoy like this. Ever. Malfoy always wore a hard shell, and in the past, the only reason he'd ever spoke to Harry was to insult him. But now things were different, and he was here witnessing Malfoy crumbling emotionally right in front of him and he didn't know how to react. He didn't know what to do. What to say.
him." Fred managed to say through their uncontrollable laughter.  Draco looked to Harry, an intense expression on his face.
Harry's heart skipped a beat and his stomach dropped. He felt the colour leave his face and he could do nothing but stare at Malfoy who was pacing the room in distress, grabbing at his ice-blonde hair.
"Oh, But, you see. I'm no longer like you, Father." Draco pocketed the Prophecy again. "I no longer look up to you. I'm done being a coward."
"No, Potter." He pushed Harry's book slightly away from him. "I don't want you spending all your time on this either. You have a life and you can't continually work on this day and night if you want to pass your classes. There's already so much assigned. It'll be alright."
His honesty was brutal.  He looked anywhere but Sirius' eyes. He knew it was already too late for Harry. He was already too close to Draco, and there was no turning back.
"You should take it anyways. You'll need it more than I will tonight. I'm bedridden." Harry put the silky fabric into Draco's hands.
"I'm not stupid, Harry. You haven't spoken to him in nearly a month and every time Ron and I bring him up you change the subject." Hermione pointed out. Harry knew he couldn't get around telling her.
"I...er...decided that I think you're right about the book. It is dangerous. I really don't want to cause any more problems in case anything were to happen with it." Harry lied. For some reason, Harry didn't want to share with Hermione that Malfoy had given up trying to find a cure. Maybe if he didn't tell anyone, it would make it less of a reality in his mind.
"Harry Potter. I read about you in the Prophet this morning." The Slytherin started walking to Harry. Harry backed up, gripping his wand tighter.
So I wrote my father...I told him what I had learned from other wizards, and he wrote back telling me that if i became a blood traitor he'd return me back home, punish me severely, and threatened to disown me if I continued to be disloyal."
The book had the English translation for the Latin spell that he had had in his possession. He whispered the words softly as he read from the book.
Luna's smile stood out from the crowd of weary faces. She parted through the crowd and walked up to him, her earnings bouncing with each step. This seemed to surprise Draco.
"I figured that Rita could interview you, about the night you saw V-voldemort return. To get the truth out there." Hermione explained.
Why should I waste my life away, running from death, when i could just enjoy the time I'm lucky enough to have?"
"I don't know, Ron." Harry sighed. "But he's a prefect so he probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble for wandering the halls after curfew."
Harry hesitated. "I'm frustrated at myself." Harry admitted. "I should've been able to defend myself."
Harry's meetings with Draco soon began to stop after Fred and George's memorable exit. Harry admired the twins, feeling no regret giving them his triwizard winnings. He couldn't help but wish more than anything that he could take of like they had, with Draco by his side. But he knew he needed to stay at Hogwarts. Hogwarts needed him just as much as he needed Hogwarts.
"I've decided I've stopped caring. I've got better things to do then mess with my hair." Draco rolled his eyes.
Would they think of him differently? Harry reminded himself that this was Ron and Hermione. They've been by his side for five years, this wouldn't turn them against him. But every time he thought about telling them, anxiety would build in his throat. He decided he wouldn't tell them unless they almost figure it out for themselves and Harry doubted that would happen.
"Hey." Harry nudged Hermione. They were in the room of requirement, silently looking through plans of the next DA meeting.
Draco set down his sketch book and pencil on his floor and scooted closer to Harry, wrapping his arms around him.
"Now that that's settled." Harry said to the group. "We should, er,  get some things done... I think there's a particular spell you should all learn, because I think it's quite important, in my opinion..."
"Yeah mate, we're always here for you. But don't cause more problems for yourself than you need! You don't want to spend more time with those twats then you have to."
"Harry! Harry!" He heard from the distance. One of the doors that were opened. He ran to the calls. When he got closer he recognised the voice and Harry's heart lept.
"Well, It's true." Draco pointed out. Harry raised an eyebrown and Hermione kept her stare. "My apologies, though. Continue." Draco added.
Longbottom would need to be quick." His voice rang out coldly. It pierced Harry's heart. Low and quiet, yet full of rage. Draco shot another stunning spell at Neville.
"Harry! Why? You surely know that the consequences from Umbridge and Snape won't be good!" Hermione frowned. "Are you doing Okay Harry? you seem ill... If you need to talk about anything then Ronald and I are always here for you- I know after what happened last year you can't be in a good place. Mental health is just as important as physical health. I understand if that's why you skipped but that wasn't too wise, you don't want
Everyone stayed reluctantly quite as Harry waited for a moment. "Alright." Harry sighed. Hermione went to go get Draco and came back, with him strutting behind her. They came back to the front of the room.
"This is beautiful." Draco said, looking at the water. Harry didn't look out into the water. He looked at Draco's awed expression, looking out at the view. He looked at his silver eyes that seemed to sparkle in the sunlight.
"Trust me." Harry said lowly , making eyecontact with him. Draco's eyes were wide and fearfull and he hesitated before closing them and gripping Harry tighter.
"Of course I want to join." Draco answered him. "I'm very curious to see this club." He jumped up a bit to sit on a desk.
But before Harry could leave the fireplace, he felt something grab his hair, forcefully pulling him out of the fire. He faced Umbridge, a wide, malicious smile on her face.
"Oh, Harry" Draco looked at him pitifully. He saw a malicious glint in Draco's eyes and his heart stopped. "He already has."
"Well, things you write on a bucket list don't have to be big. They can be as small as, say, 'drinking fire whiskey' or 'stargazing'" Harry informed him.
"Those points were totally unfair." Draco pouted, arms crossed. "Just because our headmaster was previously a Gryffindor does not give him the right to add an over abundance of points. Makes him no better than Snape. Anyways Slytherin won the house cup this year, so."
"Oh yeah he's pissed off." Ron informed him. "Absolutely livid. I reckon the bloke who did that is gonna feel sorry after Malfoy gets to him."
"That was an absolutely barbaric thing that Slytherin did to you. It was lucky Ron found you there." Said Hermione.
Tears stained his now red cheeks, as he put his head down on the desk in his arms, hiding himself from Harry.
You're more important. And considering that it's my life on the clock, it doesn't matter if I'm caught."
Lucius maintained his composure, yet he knew from the sweat beading on his face and the look in his eyes, fear lay behind the mask Lucius wore.
"I was as thorough as possible." Hermione told him hesitantly. "But, if anything happens... I'm really sorry."
He barely got away with the Dementor attack in Little Whinging. Harry felt bitter. Dumbledore had been ignoring him since summer, he probably wouldn't even get the chance to talk to him. But Harry began to feel guilty for feeling this way.
Harry, Draco, and Ron looked at Hermione expectantly. Hermione has the book in her lap and was reading carefully.
As he walked he couldn't stop smiling. When he reached the common room he was surprised to see Ron up, talking to Hermione. It was now empty except for the two of them, and Harry presumed that the passed out Gryffindors had either gone to get breakfast or sauntered off to their dorm.
Harry took down his shield charm and they simply stared at eachother. Harry didn't know what to say. Everything around them seemed to dissolve, and Harry nearly forgot everyone was staring at them.
All that could be heard throughout Number 12 Grimmuald Place was the screeching of that stupid portrait.
is Luna, maybe you should learn that. She has as much valid input as anyone else here. This is a space to be free from Umbridge and to be able to learn, not just Defense, but learn from each other. If you're going to call her loony, get out." Harry told him.
"If you do it now you can get it over with..." Harry advised him. Draco looked down at the beans reluctantly, and took a deep breath.
Harry huddled close to Draco, his breath shaky as tears spilled down his eyes. He hid them in Draco's shirt.
"I don't think you have a choice, mate." Ron grimaced. Harry sat down and Hermione began telling them off, her voice rapid.
Harry looked to Draco who was still in shock from the sudden water attack. Draco rubbed his forehead and groaned. Harry realized he was probably having a hangover. He remembered the sweets in his pocket.
"Don't hurt him! Don't hurt Harry! Please not Harry!" He yelled. Draco seemed like he was disconnected from everything around him, in a trans. Like he was trapped in his own mind, caught in an ever living nightmare that he couldn't wake up from.
Harry looked at the page, dread filling up in him. It was a masking potion. To treat illnesses. It treated nausea, vertigo, tremors, and coughs. Draco wasn't really better. It just seemed like he was.
As soon as he turned the corner he jumped. There was a person there. As soon as Harry gasped, the person turned around and walked towards him. They came into view. It was Malfoy.
"Here, let me fix you up." Draco said, his wand out. When Harry was soot free and his glasses were no longer crooked, Draco ruffled Harry's hair.
So by his third potion, which exploded everywhere like it'd been put into a microwave, Snape stared at him with annoyance for a minute while the whole class was silent, before telling him that he was hopeless.
"Disgrace to Slytherin, this is." Draco sneered at his robes, unhappy that he was being forced to wear the Gryffindor colours once more.
They tried several other doors. There were so many doors. Each of the rooms had doors of their own. Doors rotating around them, slashes making a circle of red as they span. Harry became frustrated and anxious. What if it was too late for Sirius? Harry shivered and brushed the thought from his mind.
"I'm fading Harry. I'm falling asleep. Look into my eyes." Draco whispered. Harry looked into those sliver eyes of his. They were scared. They underlined pain. But they were still bright. Draco gave him a gentle smile.
He needed to think clearly about it all. It wasn't really too big of a deal. Everyone already thought he was crazy. At least Draco wasn't exposed. He should just ignore it all and carry on. But the weight in his chest refused to lift.
"Looks like the house elf has done a good job. Maybe we should give him clothes" Malfoy laughed to Crabbe and Goyle as they left the room to get to their next class.
A surge of frustration and hurt filled Harry, and he threw the text book at the wall. Hermione jumped.
"I'm also completely in love with you." Harry replied. They looked at each other for a few minutes in silence, and Draco traced Harry's face with his finger softly, as if trying to absorb every detail of him. Harry stayed as still as stone, looking at Draco's concentrated expression. Then, out of no where, Draco burst into laughter. The randomness of the outburst made Harry laugh too.
"I hate the person I've been. I hate myself for everything, but it had become second nature to me, and It was so hard to break out of it. I'll try my hardest though, for as long as I live, to be a kinder person. To all of you, to everyone in the different houses, and to myself. Nothing can excuse myself for everything that I've done. I know that. I've been so cruel. So if you never forgive me, I wouldn't blame you. But, please, give me a chance to redeem myself at least."
"I thought that was a dream." Harry said wearily. He recapped everything that happened yesterday afternoon in his head. He looked back at Hermione, who didn't seem to pay any mind that they were in the same bed with the curtains closed around them... they were on top of the blanket and fully clothed anyways she probably wouldn't suspect...
doesn't get away." Umbridge pointed a stubby finger at Ron, who was still struggling against the Slytherin. Basil was his name. Knowing the Sltherin's name didn't make Harry feel any different towards him. He was still the Slytherin that attacked him.
"But anyways, he decided he decided he'd try and eat an entire box of Bertie Bots Every Flavoured Beans in one go. And he downed the entire thing."
Harry opened the door of the Library for Malfoy and entered after him. The scent of Dusty old books hit them immediately as they walked in. They sat down at a small table in the back of the library, behind rows of books. Nobody else, besides them and Madam Pince were present at the library.
"Enough heroics, love. Don't be ridiculous. I'll see you guys there." Draco nodded, and before Harry could stop him Draco took a quick pinch of powder.
"They were just afraid, you know. I realise that now." Draco said. He looked into Harry's eyes. And he smiled.
"Sure. We're friends. Friends that don't even address each other using their first names." Malfoy scoffed.
They talked as they sipped their coffees, which were actually quite good. Conversation with Draco came easily. Natural. There was never an awkward silence between them. Their conversation spanned from light and funny topics to heavy and deep conversations. As always, he could never be bored with Draco.
"Hermione's right." Harry said grimly. "I did this, now I need to make it right. We don't need another death of a Hogwarts student."
"Remember not to draw attention to yourself." Harry said under his breath. Draco looked around distractedly at their surroundings.
He silently slipped into the library. He held his breath as he opened and closed the big wooden door. The familiar musty smell of old books hit him, which calmed him the tiniest bit.
" Hermioned sighed in exasperation. "Well if you don't want to turn of in to Dumbledore and you don't want to be caught with it then maybe you'd be better off just burning it." Hermione eyed the warm fire burning in the fireplace in front of them.
"I see how it is. I express the slightest emotion and you go running. I can't say the word love without you turning away." Draco glared. Harry was confused. What was he talking about.
"We should get working on that essay of yours." Malfoy said, flipping towards the page about the potion.
"Draco." Ron said before he left. "I think... I wish I could've gotten to know you better." Ron said guiltily. "You're actually a pretty great bloke."
He began to topple over and Harry was quick to cast a cushioning charm. The Gryffindor's around them were either laughing or annoyed. Harry ignored them and solely tended to Draco.
"Well I hid under the invisibility cloak, but Malfoy already knows I have an invisibility cloak so he pulled it off of me. But then we made eye contact and Malfoy spazzed out. Like his eyes turned red for a moment and he hurled over like he was in pain. So I asked him what happened but then he kept on asking me what I did. And I was confused because I hadn't even taken my wand out! But then he saw the parchment in my hand and he saw the book and he accused me of casting a curse on him!"
"How do you know you're not being manipulated? I mean it's what Slytherin's do." Lavender Brown said.
Harry shook his head and took Draco's hand off his chest, simply holding it. His hand was surprisingly cold, which was unusual. Harry figured it was from the winter air. He probably still had yet to warm up.
"Oh, very well, dear. Thank you." Mrs. Weasley gave a warm smile. "I brought you two some home cooked food for dinner. I'm afraid I can't stay for long- the Order's scheduled a meeting today so more people should be popping in shortly."
Harry looked to Draco, who was still unconscious. He lifted the spells that the twins cast on him so that Draco's hair was once again short and blonde. His face was clean and calm. His robes the familiar Slytherin colours.
Draco apparently liked to read a lot, which didn't really surprise Harry considering Draco was a very scholarly-type person. He was top of his classes, second to only Hermione. But he also liked the fact that Draco liked to draw.
"No, Harry. But, you can't deny that you're always try and be the hero. You're selfless. And Voldemort knows that. He could be trying to use that to his advantage." Hermione warned.
"Helping your friends." Ron and Hermione. He hasn't  even seen them  after the Prophecy room. Harry looked at Draco with a sad expression in his eyes, tears raining down his cheeks.
Harry planned for a lonely night in the hospital wing. At least he wasn't in pain the entire time like in second year. But Harry couldn't find himself falling asleep.
"I asked your mud-blood friend, Granger, where I could find you and she said  if you weren't in the library or your common room, you'd be here."
"How do I know this won't poison me?" Draco looked suspiciously at the leaves. Harry have him a slight glare.
"Dumbledore brought you..." Dumbledore? He was there. Harry expected to feel relief at this news. But it did not come.
But people kept approaching him in the Hallways, asking if he could give at least one more meeting before break. Harry knew he couldn't pretend not to be ignoring them any longer.
"But wouldn't it look worse if Umbridge found that book in Harry's bag? I mean she's creating so many rules, she could probably find any reason to search Harry's stuff if she suspected Harry of stealing the Latin incantation off her desk. Then she could get you in way more trouble or having it and she wouldn't get blamed at all for having it!"
"I'm sorry..." Harry looked down. "It's just been complicated with him. I've learned a lot about him that's changed my view on him. Maybe if you'd try and get to know him you'd feel differently about him." Harry suggested. Hermione sighed.
"You should probably get some sleep." Harry advised, brushing Draco's ice-blond hair out of his face. Draco seemed to like when Harry messed with his hair.
"Thank you, Potter, for attempting to be heroic, but there's no way. There just... isn't. And if he found out that I'd run off with
He became silent, as did everyone else. Draco cleared his throat, and faced everyone again, calming himself down.
" I accept your apology, Draco Malfoy. I think it's brave of you to even stand up here. I think everyone deserves a chance to change, and you've looked back at what you've done and decided you needed to change for the better. That's quite a heroic thing to do, I think." She gave him an interested look, a smile still on her face.
"Out of favouritism!" Scoffed Draco. "We would've won if fucking Dumbledore hadn't cheated and given out last minute points. The banners were already up. We thought we had won. But GUESS NOT."
Lord Voldemort sent curses flying Dumbledore's direction. But Dumbledore sent curses back to Voldemort. The structures the spells had hit were in ruins. But then, the fireplaces lit up emerald green. Witches and Wizards were arriving to the Ministry for work.
Zacharias looked at her like he was going to say something, but stopped himself and stayed silent. He stayed where he was, an awkward expression on his face.
?" Hermione said in quiet rage, a deadly look in her glare. She suddenly grabbed Ron's drink right out of his hand and splashed the contents in his face, making his red hair droop in front of his startled face.
"I think I'm going to burn the book." Harry said absentmindedly. They had been hiding it in the Room of Requirement, until Harry could read through it all. Harry didn't want to risk taking it out of the room to do research.
"Funny, I was thinking the same thing." He laughed. Harry let his mind let his mind clear of everything but this very moment. And it was blissful.
"That's what I thought, Mr. Potter. After all, we only have a few hours left left before the message sinks in."
Harry didn't know what to say, as tears made Malfoy's eyes watery. Malfoy grabbed at his hair in anger. His burst of rage lasted for two minutes.
"Coming from Loony Lovegood." Zacharias scoffed. Luna still seemed unfazed, but Draco glared at him with cold eyes. Harry  spoke out.
Harry's panic was overwhelming. It was four days before the 31st. They'd been giving Draco some more potion to help with his symptoms, but he'd reached a point where it wouldn't even have an affect. His symptoms just kept getting worse. Draco had begun to cough blood. His skin was like ice. His face gaunt. His breathing shallow and his voice croaky. He couldn't get out of bed. He got violent shivers. Sometimes, he'd even have trouble remembering things.
"What do you think you're going to do about it?" Draco challenged. "You wouldn't dare do anything. "
He escaped the room, and was back once more in the circle of doors. He took the Prophecy out of his pocket. Then he heard yelling.
"Well didn't you say that whomever is victimized by this curse has the date of their death implanted in their mind? Well how long until- you know."
He wasn't sure what was worse. His ribs or his arm. It all felt the same. He found it hard to breathe with the blood spurting out of his nose.
A tall figure stood above him, wearing a hooded cloak. Dementor? Harry's immediate thought was to cast a Patronus. But the figure was not floating off the ground. The air had not chilled. But the sense of dread was there.
"Dying." Draco replied. His expression wasn't sad. It was more concerned. Harry was taken aback by the question. He'd never really thought about it. He knew why Draco asked him. He was afraid.
"They should." Draco said quietly. He hesitated. "For the first 11 years of your life, you weren't shown any kindness. Yet, you're still- wonderful. Your still selfless. Considerate. Maybe it's not the lack of kindness but the lack of  willingness to grow and learn."
" The Prophecy." Bellatrix whispered. Her expression became desperate. "Give it here, Draco, you silly little boy." She tried to come closer to him, to grab it.
"I think at this point, distancing yourself from him would make everything worse... You should..you should enjoy the time.. that you have..." Hermione said,  struggling to find a good way to word it.
"These'll do the trick.'" Hagrid took a couple leaves out. "Work lika charm, these do. Just chew on them an' you'll feel better in no time." Hagrid tried to hand them to him.
"He's one of Umbridge's favourites!" The room was now loud with everyone talking. Hermione tried to silence everyone and failed, until Ron came closer to the front and yelled "SHUT IT"
"Yeah, well. Maybe if I cling onto that one percent, then everything will be alright." Harry bit his lip.
"I hate that bloody woman." Draco ranted to Harry while pacing the empty classroom in anger. He had seen the words inscribed into Harry's hand and was infuriated.
"I really am extremely grateful you've given me this opportunity." He said, a small, genuine smile on his face. He bowed slightly towards the three of them, before swiftly walking out, his black cloak trailing behind him.
"Er... this way." Harry muttered, recounting in his head his visit with Mr. Weasley for the hearing, and the corridor from his visions.
"I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for calling you a House Elf in potions today - I know that you're trying really hard to help me with this curse mess, even though I don't necessarily deserve it and I really shouldn't be taking that for granted, so my apologies." He mumbled.
Cramped, Hermione struggled to pull out her wand. When she finally managed, she returned Draco back to his original state. Blonde Hair and Slytherin Robes.
"I told him your idea of the sickles, Hermione, and he seemed to like that idea. So he's got one now." Harry praised Hermione.
Harry wanted to be cautious telling everyone about the new member of the DA because he knew their reactions wouldn't be good.
One morning as Harry was getting a glass of water, he could've sworn he saw something flicker in the empty fireplace. He knelt down and stared at it suspiciously. After a minute of nothing, Harry decided it had been a trick of the light. But then he fell backwards when the fireplace became engulfed in blue flames. The flames quickly vanished.
"Oh, nothing." Draco said sarcastically. His voice was bitter. "She's just written lies about me and my family in the Prophet for years."
"Please Hermione, don't. I'll make it up to you, i swear." Ron begged. Hermione's expression did not change.
Draco was sat up on top the covers, his legs cross crossed. He was focused intently on his sketch  pad, his face close to the paper. He looked up to Harry when he came in, a lopsided smile on his face.
I planned to spend the entire day with you but she said it was important. I should've told you earlier I just forgot... Would you come along with me? Maybe she'll let me leave sooner if I bring you along. Then we can spend the rest of the day alone together?" Harry asked hopefully. Thankfully, Draco just smiled, an eyebrow raised.
"Understandable. But what's this got to do with you turning on me with no explanation?" He asked politely.
"No, I can't walk- I'll only hold you up- take it and leave me behind!" Draco said, reaching in his robes for the orb.
He hated the Prophet. It was one thing to have the Prophet printing out fake stories about him.  It was different having such an intimate aspect of his personality being berated, so that he whole wizarding world could see. And this time, there was photographic proof. He couldn't just claim it was a lie. Not that anyone would believe him, even if there wasn't a photo.
And now, there was no turning back as they faced the portrait. Harry took the Invisibility Cloak off them, and whispered the password to the Fat Lady.
Harry met with Draco in the room of requirement after breakfast. He changed his robes and his hair colour. He didn't mess with the colour of his eyes though. Harry enjoyed looking into the misty silver, and no one was going to notice. Anyways, He didn't want to risk the spell going wrong and Draco going blind or something.
"I-I didn't think to go to Madame Pomfrey's because I was so sick I just wanted to go to my dormitory." Harry lied.
"Hermione will probably ask you to sign a bunch of stuff for confidentiality and all, but uh you should meet me in the 7th floor corridor on Wednesday, after classes. We'll initiate  you into it. "
They were told Mr. Weasley was going to be alright, and make a full recovery. They spent Christmas at Grimmuald place with Sirius, who was happy to have company during the Holidays.
"How do you even know about this book Malfoy? This is extremely dark magic. I'm certain its illegal to have, considering."
"Alrigh'" he sighed. He opened the door to let them in, and Draco immediately stumbled to a chair. The air inside smelt like a fireplace and burnt plastic, and Draco only seemed to have a negative reaction to the smell.
Harry decided, though, that he would schedule one last D.A. meeting before Holiday break. He figured Draco probably wouldn't even come, and if he did happen to come, he'd probably ignore Harry completely. Harry hoped Draco wouldn't come. Meeting with just him was risky enough, but if Umbridge found out he was part of their secret defence group... well Harry didn't want to think about that.
"I can't believe I've spilled everything I've been trying to hide about my life to you." Malfoy sighed. "I haven't told
Harry looked at him with remorse, unsure of what to say next. He felt sorry that he'd pushed himself and Malfoy to search continuously for the cure. He didn't want Malfoy to die, but if it was inevitable, he wanted Malfoy to be able to live the rest of his life out as he wanted. He just wanted to fix what he'd done. He didn't want to be the reason someone lost so many years of his life.
"Yeah but it's generous of you to help me considering how mean i've been to you over the years...so...er... if you need help with your essay in Potion, then I can help you with it... Potions is my top class."
Draco wasn't safe to go home any longer, so he came with Harry to Grimmuald Place. Harry had inherited Grimmuald place from Sirius. Harry was glad to be able to leave the Dursley's after only having to stay there for a week. He was especially glad to be able to spend all his time with Draco.
Harry already Draco was in love with him, but that didn't stop him from feeling those pesky butterflies fluttering around in his stomach.
The next D.A. meeting occurred no more than a week later. He was thankful he decided to arrive early because Dobby had decorated for Christmas and Harry spent his extra time taking down the bobbles he'd put up, as they all had his face on them.
Saturday morning, Harry lingered by the library, his hands in his pockets and his hair messy. He was waiting for Malfoy. The halls were empty, because everyone else was enjoying the unseasonably warm weather outside.
"Remember that Latin spell that we found in Umbridge's desk that time when we were the last ones left in the class room because we needed to finish that assignment? And Umbridge left for a moment to do something?"
"There. Now, whenever he runs out, the bowl will refill, as long as there's enough food in the bag." Hermione said. Ron looked at her amazed.
Then he followed Draco quickly. He finally caught up to him. He was stopped, staring at an empty portrait.
Harry wished he could escape. Or just send Umbridge far away. Or ensure Voldemort never existed in the first place. Maybe then would Harry be able to live a normal life. But he knew it was no good to dwell on that. No good to dwell on dreams.
"Thank you. I've never shared my art with many people. I don't really trust many people...Now that I think about it, you're one of the only people I trust..." Draco told him. He closed his book and returned it to his bag.
Harry wanted to tell Draco this, but he couldn't put it in words. He didn't know how he would tell him, because it could take ages to explain and describe. So instead he just sat with him, making small talk and cracking jokes. Ending up having thoughtful conversations and weird ideas. Getting to know each other more and more, listening to every word that he spoke.
"You guys are the best." Draco gave a laugh as he patted Fred on the back. Harry walked over to them wearily. In one hand he had a mug of Butterbeer and in the other a cup of water. He had remembered Aunt Petunia saying that water helped sober people up after having too much to drink. It was when Aunt Marge was over, but he remembered she frequently would hand Uncle Vernon water after he had one can too many.
"He's got a kind heart, and he really would go out of his way to help you, even after you've treated him so poorly. It's either him or Madam Pomfrey. Unless you'd rather stay nauseous like that and go to neither." Harry said.
"No, like a vision." He told him. He described what he saw. "It's like when I could feel his emotions. Just this time I could see what was happening."
"Take him to the entrance of the headmaster's office." She said gleefully, an evil smile on her toad-like face. "And keep him there until I come back."
"Ah, but Mr. Baker, I've changed my ways." Rita said sweetly. Draco crossed his arms and shook his head in disbelief.
They exited though the portrait hole and shuffled quietly through the hall. The Fat Lady was still asleep. Hermione lead the two of them to an empty broom closet.
"I didn't get sent to a wizarding family. I got sent to live with my only living relative, who were muggles who despised magic. They mistreated me my entire life, and if I ever showed any signs of magic, even when I didn't even know what magic was, they'd forbid me from having meals for days and locked me in the cupboard under the stairs, which I slept in. I do know what its like, and I desperately want to help you. I swear I'll get you away from him. I'll get the both of us away. I swear."
As they ventured back to the castle, the four of them were silent. Harry, Hermione, and Draco were still trying to process what had happened.
Harry taught the D.A. some new defense spells. As they were grouped up to practice, Harry walked the room, actively avoiding Draco, who was partnered with Neville, for as long as he could.
"And the book of Death, well, I burned it. And they don't know where it's gone. That's probably how the book ended up at Hogwarts." Harry thought over. "But what was his plan?"
" HOLY SHIT put mE dOWN! PUT ME DOWN!" Draco panicked, struggling against Grawp. Grawp simply looked wondrously at Draco.
"I can't believe this, Potter. You're just going to believe what people told you? Not everyone in Slytherin is bad and not everyone who's bad is Slytherin. Gryffindor is way worse than Slytherin. Slytherin tops all the other houses.
"But it feels like he's taking up all of you're time and you'd rather talk to him more than us now. It feels like you're abandoning us for him."
"I'm with Potter." Draco said firmly. Along with the anger, disappointment flooded Lucius' expression. And a hint of fear glowing in his cold eyes.
"Ah, no. I'm a slytherin through and through." Draco chuckled. " You just helped me find bravery that was hidden within myself. Maybe you could be a Slytherin, though."
"Mistletoe." Draco pointed up above them. Harry looked up, and sure enough, suspended up above them was the green plant. Harry's feet were rooted to the ground, and Draco didn't move either. Harry noticed how close they were.
Harry traveled quickly and quietly through the dark corridor, sweating under the invisibility cloak. He made his footsteps as airy as possible, all the while attempting to be rather speedy on his expedition.
"We need to get him out of here before any of the Slytherins notice his absence. Particularly Snape." Hermione warned. Snape. He'd nearly forgotten he was supposed to have his first occlumency
"So tomorrow is the quidditch game. Gryffindor against Slytherin." Harry said casually. "You nervous?" He asked with a chuckle.
"Well he's not with you lot, we'd thought we'd wait and tell you who he his before he comes out." Ron told the group. Hermione had a concerned expression on her face, and everyone else looked confused.
"I hear them too, Harry." Draco whispered to him softly. Sadly. "We need to leave this room. It'll do us no good to stay here. This isn't where your godfather is."
"I agree." Someone else spoke out. Pretty soon, the entire room was in agreement. Harry and Ron smiled, while  Hermione looked relieved.
"She's absolutely vile, and has no right to do that to you, or anyone for that matter." He kicked at a chair.
"I know. But wouldn't have happened any other way. It had to be like this. It's sad but it's true. I'm just so glad I got the opportunity to get to know you. The real you." Harry gave him a soft smile.
Harry handed Malfoy the book that had been resting in his lap. Malfoy scanned through the pages until he found the curse that he'd fallen victim to.
"What happens if we run into a teacher, like Umbridge or Snape? They'd recognize that im not actually a Gryffindor and they'd figure out I'm hanging out with you.."
"Hmm." Draco looked down. "I think maybe this particular curse makes it seem painful. But I think when I get there, it won't hurt. I think it'd be more of a relief."
"That's fair." Harry said, running his fingers through his own unruly hair. Then Harry remembered something uncomfortable.
"Snape shouldn't give you any problems with this essay, seeing as I walked you through and proof read the entire thing. It has everything he asked for
"Do you really think I'd leave without obliviating him first? Honestly, Potter." Draco shook his head. "Anyways, my cover'll be blown tonight anyways, considering I'm going to the ministry with you."
Malfoy had seemed rather upset that day, from the moment they met up in the hall. Harry didn't linger on it. Why should he care if Malfoy was having a bit of a bad day? He was there to save his life, not to coddle Malfoy if he was upset.
The three of them looked wearily at each other. Harry sighed before they agreed to go. They followed Hagrid out of the castle and they walked towards the Forbidden Forest.
