"It might take that long to figure out the clue," Hermione warned.
Harry went to bed, smiling. He felt stupidly giddy, but he couldn't help it.
"That's brilliant," Harry enthused, "because I don't."
. The only thing I could think about when I was down here last was saving Ginny, my own life be damned! And since then, I try my very best NEVER to think about it! To NEVER think about how terrified I was! How that monster sounded when it came in, how it hissed, how
I am also so nervous when I try writing Luna, and it's one of the reasons I've never posted some things because she's in it. Like Snape, there is book-Luna and movie-Luna, but I don't think either is all that favourable about her? There are times they are, but still. At any rate, I've combined them. I want to give her more weighted value, I guess, but I apologise if my Luna is too OOC for some.
Malfoy snorted over another muted squishing sound. "Do you honestly think even the Ministry would allow for any regulations of

Slowly, Harry looked over to Ron. He was deathly pale and staring at Harry with wide-eyes.
Harry decided he really was such an idiot. Why in the world he thought showing
Finally, Ron snapped.
Malfoy was still sputtering, rubbing at his cheeks and mouth, and Harry patiently waited for him to finish. When he did, he gave Harry an impatient look and gestured at him as though
Harry's mouth was dry. He never pictured Malfoy as a small talk kind of person, but it felt like so much progress between them, he was desperate to keep it going. "Two of them are non-binary."
Malfoy opened a few cabinets and began to mix something that glowed slightly. Harry obligingly added his own
"I was a right wanker," Ron said, some colour coming back in his cheeks. "I—I know you didn't put your name in, Harry. I just…" he looked to Hermione who was watching them both nervously, eyes wet. "I was jealous. I—I didn't understand… I
Eventually, they found a cornerstone way in the back of the Chamber hidden in condensed shadows with what looked to used to be a carving of a snake. Harry wasn't too sure about it, but he demanded it open all the same. Sure enough, it opened to a very narrow,
"Why wouldn't he?" Ron questioned.
people at first. Mostly just him closing his eyes and pretending his hands were someone else's. He wasn't entirely sure when it was that the shapeless no ones formed boy-shapes, but it wasn't something he thought about until after it was over.
"Yes, professor," he croaked.
They picked another path that led to a fountain with an ice sculpture of a swan.
He paused again, examining where they could go one of three ways. He tried to think back, going over his memories again.
"This isn't distracted, this is spaced out," Ron corrected.
Malfoy performed the invisible-bubble charm before Harry opened the second entrance, and he was a little amused by how Malfoy resembled a kid in a candy shop as he bounced over to his things. The first thing he did was release and open a large chest that tripled in size once opened. Harry had to keep his mouth from dropping open when the chest unfolded on itself to create a large work section, complete with shelves, a small prep table, and even an icebox underneath.
"This one looks interesting," Harry suggested.
"What business is it of yours?" Hermione snarled.
Afternoon lessons were cancelled so everyone could witness the first task, and Harry's last few dragon-less hours seem to blink away. Somehow his first lesson, History of Magic, suddenly blurred into lunch, and before he knew it, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the table in the Great Hall to collect him.
"Are you actually telling me you 'did your own work' so much so that you could cheat?"
Harry was quiet the next couple of days, thinking it over.
people out there today on his side made him want to rebel, to push the boundaries and test if he really had the professor too.
"Look at that!" Bagman was yelling. "Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is the quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr Potter!"
Lastly: I'm also still unsure with the scene with Hermione walking to Hogsmeade. I've kept changing it back and forth. Any insights, thoughts or opinions anyone wants to offer, please do! I'm happy to change it!
"Right, this way." Malfoy's footsteps echoed very quietly as he steadily followed, not interrupting. "Anyway, Lockhart had apparently been bragging all year that he always knew where the entrance was, what the monster was, all that tosh. We didn't realise it until later, but when the other professors told him now was his time to shine and go take care of the monster, they were actually just getting rid of him. We didn't realise that though. So, we ran to Lockhart to tell him what we knew, and we found him packing. He was going to run."
Harry snorted, but it really did sound more or less like Malfoy was implying Malfoy was lucky to have his godfather. "Well, mine figured out how to break out of Azkaban."
Harry didn't have to see his expression to know he was getting a very distrustful, condescending eyebrow.
He sighed, closing his eyes and trying to think of any more.
want a few days to prepare."
Malfoy's head dropped again, shoulder shaking once more. Harry bit down a smile as he watched Malfoy re-compose himself. "Right." He cleared his throat, smoothing down the front of his robes."Right, well," he turned back to Harry, and Harry's heart beat a little faster seeing the ghost of a genuine smile on Malfoy's face, humour twinkling at the edges of his eyes. "Well, we obviously aren't going to do that."
Madam Pomfrey was in fine form, seemingly bickering with nobody and everybody about her students facing dragons. Cedric didn't seem too badly injured, however, and Harry watched with mild fascination as Madam Pomfrey cleaned and healed his shoulder. She instructed him to sit, but he couldn't.
"Are you?"
"It's nice to have friends."
“I don't know how people do this. How Blue did this. Two words. Two freaking words, and I'm not the same Simon anymore.”
Hermione paused, grabbing his arm to make him stop walking. "What was that?"
So, I apologise to any anti-Dracos (if you are, Idk why you're reading this, but you are welcomed regardless!), but I personally have always enjoyed the headcanon of a very intelligent Draco Malfoy. In fact, I have my own headcanon that the reason why Draco wasn't a more direct competition to Hermione was that he spent so much time and effort helping his two best friends Crabbe and Goyle. Is that something canon-Malfoy would do? Probably not, I'll admit. But if Crabbe and Goyle are so hopelessly stupid, I never understood how they were able to pass each year and even get OWLs. I just like the idea of a good friend!draco, pulling his friends off to the corner of the common room to explain something for the millionth time and shoving them into classrooms to practise spells. Only to turn around and get dragged by his father for letting a muggleborn do better than him because he was clearly smart enough to match or beat her, thus fueling more hatred toward her. It's not something I know everyone likes or agrees with, hence this note; I felt a need to explain it. I am absolutely not implying it's at all true nor that anyone has to agree with it. I just like it, 'tis all. There's always some element of Draco helping his friends in school in most of my fics. (Especially since I can totally see him being like, "For the love of god, if it will get you to shut up, I'll write your damn essay myself," lol)
Harry felt like his heart was going to beat out of his chest. He was taking in her words, but he was still stuck on, "Your uncles are…?"
Harry stopped him by raising a hand, his heart picking up as he heard footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.
He let out a slow breath.
He threw himself into it so much that his nerves were almost gone, but by Tuesday morning, they had returned mercilessly.
Harry didn't answer.
"I suggest you gather your
Harry wasn't quite sure what to say. He opened his mouth to say he was fine, but like with Sirius a few days ago, he felt so far from fine, he didn't know how to imitate it.
"Yeah. Come on, let's find a pleasant sculpture."
Harry made himself breathe and looked down at the article again.
For one, Neville had been slowly losing his baby-fat and weight and was rapidly becoming taller to even the rest out. At the rate he was going, Harry could see him being quite fit. For another, Cedric Diggory was really…
He gulped, casting his conscious mind to the right path as best he remembered it, firmly telling himself that the danger was
"I didn't ask for this," he said hoarsely. "I didn't put my name in the Goblet. I don't
Fine! See if I care!"
I'mma doing my best.
Harry sighed.

"Why can't we have a list of things this transfiguration will work on, and learn it the old way?" Vinny asked.
"This, that…" he whispered to himself. "What does either matter when you're dead?"
Honestly, it made him practically allergic to wanking for about a week after.
to go that Malfoy relented. True to his promise the time before, Harry made sure he was in front on their up the narrow spiral staircase.
He looked back around to Malfoy, who was leaning back in his chair, reading a large tome and brushing the feather of his quill across his lips in thought. Harry swallowed, hunching back over his own book.
"This is where Lockhart cursed himself."
"Ergo…" Malfoy smirked.
the Heir of Slytherin."
you for the chance to prove it to you."
"Oh, that makes sense… I didn't think…" He deflated a little.
"I don't care about the bloody potion," Draco hissed at him.
Harry conceded that with a tilt of his head. Dumbledore never asked to see the Chamber or to do anything with it, but that didn't mean he would agree with students making several trips down into it in the middle of the night. "What do we do then?"
"Boy-business," Draco interrupted her. He ignored her disappointed pout. "See you."
us, but he—"
The professor sighed, sounding tired and irritated. "Ultimately, it is entirely up to you. It's your choice whether or not to tell people or even face the alternating prescription of identity. If I may make a suggestion, however, I believe Miss Granger would be understanding."
"Yeah," Harry sighed. He finally dropped his hands and looked around. It didn't seem the other champions and their partners had heard anything.
Five people. He felt like his heart could burst.
And Malfoy's date, and Malfoy, just caught Harry gaping…
Malfoy shot him a look Harry couldn't quite make out in their low
"I can see it," Harry mocked. "You twirling around the dungeons like a bat."
Malfoy, engaged, lit his own wand and squinted down. "One has a snake on it."
Later that night as he climbed into bed, he pulled out the miniature Horntail to lay on his bedside table. It yawned hugely and curled up, closing its eyes.
"He's not a psychopath!"
He couldn't help keeping the miniature Horntail with him and felt proud when the doofer learned how to crawl out of his pocket and began scurrying around Harry's person. Ron likewise thought it was brilliant, but Hermione shied away from it and eyed it judgmentally.
For all he knew, he could go to the ball that night, see not only all the Hogwarts girls but the ones from the other schools, dolled up and looking beautiful, and he could realise that he found them attractive after all. That all of this was just some sort of freak out because of the dangers of this year. That he was fixating himself on an actually small, minute blip, and that once he met the right girl…
"Is it the egg?" Ron frowned. "You have months to figure that out."
"Thought about it? Yeah! But," Harry inexplicably stepped closer, finding that he really wanted Malfoy to know the
basilisk—you
He was nagged and pressured by Ron about asking someone to the ball, Ron constantly muttering to himself about them having not done it yet. Harry mostly tried to ignore him, running words over and over and over and over in his head until he felt like it was going to explode. He had a plan, he thought, but he was terrified of it getting screwed up.
Merlin, how he longed to pull out his travel goblet and drain the whole thing.
"Aw, poor Potter, forced into a night of socialisation and delight."
," Snape told Harry nastily, "and go inside. It's midnight. The ball is over."
Harry sighed, laying a gentle hand on her shoulder to lead her up the stairs. "No," he said quietly to her. "It's just… It's just, that's isn't something… It could cause problems, is all, if other people heard you saying something like that. About two blokes—about me and Malfoy."
"Sir!" Malfoy squeaked—
—didn't believe him, any of it, of anything that had happened to Harry, was just too much to bear. Because it meant Malfoy's predictions of what would happen to Harry in the tournament was something he actually believed. Because it meant that Malfoy fully expected Harry to make a fool of himself and die. That Malfoy wasn't just being hateful toward Harry but quite literally
"Hmm." Hermione made a thoughtful noise. "This is about what you asked me before?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"To keep him from doing anything else. And honestly? A bit of revenge. He was also useful to test out the stone-slide first, and I figured it could help to have a shield."
Among the three of them, Harry just had to sit back and enjoy.
and brought Malfoy here, but something else was needling at him.
As he climbed into bed, he thought about the night before and how he thought a bit of wanking would do him some good.
Hermione's eyes focused on the egg with interest, but Ron clapped and rubbed his hands. "That's great news! It's months away!"
She nodded back and began steering him toward what he knew to be the dragon enclosure.
going to see this."
"I won't tell you again."
"I don't even want to go," Harry grumbled, tearing his eyes away and focusing on his book. He needed to make predictions about the hols, and he didn't think it was a long shot to predict his death now over any of the other tasks.
"You've imagined my death, right?"

"You mean to tell me…" Malfoy opened, and for once, he looked like he was really trying to control his voice and volume, "that you
Harry quirked a brow, not missing Malfoy's bitter undertones. "Who are you taking then?"
—and Harry had enough brainpower left to squirrel that away for later.
"Thank you, Harry," she told him. "And thank you for letting me get acquainted with Faaiq."
He smoothed out his tie and walked back to where Blaise was already packed and leaving. Blaise had neatly stacked Draco's supplies, and Draco packed them and waited off to the side for Greg and Vin.
"Ooh, touch a nerve? Is it her then? Staking a claim on the female Weasley?"
"I know."
Professor McGonagall raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. "I see. I highly recommend letting in some other people, Mr Potter. Perhaps your friends, at least."
Malfoy's jaw dropped fully then, eyes widened, and satisfied, Harry spun on heels and marched back to the castle. He didn't look back, but it was a close thing.
The castle's bell rang then, announcing the lesson's end. Most everyone began marching off.
They went, and Harry wrote a long letter to Sirius detailing almost everything about the first task. Ron let him borrow Pigwidgeon; meanwhile, Harry updated Ron on everything Sirius warned him about Karkaroff. They then went back to Gryffindor tower where a celebration of Harry's victory was well underway. Lee tempted Harry into opening the golden egg which was empty but emitted a loud, shrieking sound that had everyone covering their ears.

"Well, she has."
"But who will you take then?"

Thoughts that were something that was

Harry felt a little like he couldn't breathe. He wrung his hands. "I'm

"Some of them have been here before. They're glad we humans can be more natural now."
anything.
"Oh… well, yeah."
And Harry's breath caught.
"Potter…"
Harry felt a bit triumphant at that, and he sensed it was because of their Potions lesson earlier that day. Although Snape was leaving him alone around the rest of the castle, Harry figured that probably wouldn't hold in class, so he went in determined not to rise to the bait and to pay attention.
Harry remained glaring at Skeeter, but he didn't miss how her eyes roamed over the other students, both those who had been injured in the lesson and those stumbling out of the hut.
"Not Hogwarts," Harry corrected, "just the staff." He thought of Snape. "And maybe not even all of them."
"Why is any of this happening?"
"Professor Snape has more talent and skill in his little pinky than you ever will!" Malfoy spun around on his stool to yell at Harry's face. "You can't even do a common firsty potion without blowing your cauldron up!"
He smirked wickedly, a warning if there ever was one, but there was something different about it than Harry was used to. The mirth was still there, not cruel but just… happy. Contented and teasing. Harry's stretched-thin imagination had conjured something similar for Harry, but apparently his imagination truly was limited because… it was
Malfoy had stepped even closer, now only about a foot from Harry. His expression was watchful, observant, but also soft and somehow encouraging. The tone sounded like it was supposed to be teasing, but it didn't actually have any teasing in it.
terminated an
He really shouldn't, not so close to the task. Malfoy was indeed correct that he would need at least a few days to prepare, and he couldn't say he had been preparing all that well. Not to mention, tonight was the night he was supposed to meet Sirius somehow.
"Everyone born in proper families has godparents, Potter," Malfoy sniffed. He shifted a little on his feet though.
"It's really not that unusual, Harry, or a big deal. I mean—" she added quickly "—I don't mean that as belittling the experience or anything. I just meant, it doesn't bother me at all. It wouldn't change how I felt about someone."
Nicholas knew his valet wasn't stupid, and that he knew just as Nicholas did that it was a purposeful ploy to give them time to run. Wanting to spit fire, Nicholas snatched the scroll and read it quickly.
"That would explain the noises coming from a few of mine," Dumbledore had put in.
"Maybe…" Hermione shrugged.

"Whatever it is, mate, you better come back down to earth. Potions next."
," he snorted to himself.
Malfoy led the way to the sink, obviously more comfortable than before. Harry couldn't help but wonder if he tried imitating Parselmouth to open it. He wouldn't put it past the git. He also noticed that Malfoy was in much more casual robes. In fact, knowing Malfoy's usual outfits as he did, Harry was pretty sure those were the most worn he probably own, making them the perfect ones to go sliding downpipes in.
It felt like a slap in the face. "Fine.
"Much better than any of you," Parkinson sneered meanly.
"Right," Blaise drawled. "That's why you're two shades paler than normal."
"Hermione? I, er… could we go for a walk?"
"Probably one of his more impressive breaks, to be honest. The screens are probably easy to break, I guess—they're like a telly's screen—but that wasn't what he broke. He broke the computer itself. See, they come in two parts; one is a monitor, which has the screen, and the other is called the hard drive, I think, which is this big rectangle thing made of thick plastic. It has the wires and fans and stuff, and you connect to the monitor, right? I suppose one side of it where the wires connect can be fragile, but he broke it from the side, through the hard plastic. I don't know how he did it, probably just sat on it with how big he is—his school has actually required him to go on a diet—last summer was nothing but grapefruit, I swear—and he—"
Harry shrugged, smiling at Malfoy. "It's talking back to her. I mean, I can't hear anything, but she seems to."
And yes, on top of getting a reading for Harry's developing feelings and their sincerity, I totally picture him also getting uh… more than an eye-full, lol. No, nothing pervy or explicit. But hey, accidentally stumbling on what people get up to in private is the hefty price you pay for reading their mind without consent.
The usual hatred and anger boiled in Harry's belly, making him clench his fist. Some of the Slytherins were openly sniggering at him.
A lot of those could be ruled out, though. He wasn't bitten by anything, he knew. He hadn't swapped fluids with anyone, blood or otherwise being a virgin. He could have been cursed, but how? Why? When?

He wondered if he threatened that if Malfoy
Malfoy narrowed his eyes on their haul. Harry smirked back at him.
"Of course you are," Malfoy sneered. "You're a hopeless, pathetic, absolute moron, and I will be genuinely surprised if you survive Tuesday."
The slide down was exactly as he remembered, and he would like to have said his landing was significantly more graceful. Perhaps encouraged by Harry taking the first jump, like Harry knew he would be, Malfoy wasn't far behind, and Harry had to quickly scoot away to keep the blond from slamming into him.
It was so far from their usual banter or teasing, it was almost alien, but Harry knew it was the best she could do at the moment. So, he played along. "Yes, mother."
"This is on'y me second year," Hagrid replied with clear pride in his voice.
in on whatever Death Eater plans were brewing, he could easily put it together that Pettigrew was now with Voldemort and flock over to him to help.
Harry looked behind him, and Luna was sitting on the edge of the fountain, apparently describing something to the swan, using her hands to mimic whatever it was.
to be this way.
"Worse. The Memory Charm backfired awfully. He went flying back, causing the cave-in," he gestured around the rubble. "It left him and Ron on one side, me on the other. Ron stayed with Lockhart and began working to make that hole there. I went on."
Harry scrubbed at his lips and jaw, trying to stop grinning and push down the humour of the thing. It wasn't funny—it
The following few hours were some of the most surreal, bizarre, and most fun Harry thought he had ever experienced.
Harry felt a lump in his throat form. He blinked several times to keep his vision clear. "Th-thank you, Professor. That—it means a lot."
"Is that the sculpture's name?"
"I won't," Ron laughed, hugging him back. "I'm so sorry."
"Tomorrow night," Harry answered without thinking first. He internally winced. If he didn't have enough time tonight, he doubted he actually would tomorrow.
"Thank you, Ginny."
Draco didn't have to look around to know Granger's hand was high in the air.
"All right, Harry," she agreed.
"Oh, great," Harry sighed, feeling immediately dejected that there was apparently more he was going to have to deal with. "What about?"
Harry shrugged again, moving forward to the hole. "It'll be a tight fit now. Dunno if you want to try to make it bigger?"
Harry felt a lump in his throat at the memories, and he curled in on himself, swallowing it down. Knowing them, they wouldn't think him as some victim of corruption but rather proof there was a disease, and that thought hurt more than he thought it should.
He tried to think of girls. He always tried to think of girls. When he first started regularly masturbating—which for him was mostly giving himself permission to, because the Dursleys would always make even the implication of masturbation sound like sin and something wrong and dirty—he would just enjoy the experience of it. Explore the feelings, what felt good, what didn't, that sort of thing. He supposed that was normal. He eventually had to give himself permission to think of other people when he did it, too, because he learned from his dormmates' blatant discussions that doing so was also supposed to be normal.
"Caught on, have you?" he asked coldly. "Took you long enough."
"What does okay mean?"
"I already told you not to judge a Slytherin by public appearance. But alas, I should have known better than expect

Harry threw out his hands. "Apparently I do a little. Look, are you coming with me, or not?"
"Not that dirt—that's the old dirt!"
, a girl—a girl who was nice—and tried to let it go.
"Oh, it belongs to Se-... my godfather, actually. He really only uses it during the summer or when he's travelling, so I reckon we have weeks before he notices it's gone." He unloaded several books and began meticulously placing them on the shelves, going over to pull out supplies and other things where he arranged them next to certain books.
"Okay," Luna agreed easily. "I can show you the other one later."
"Luna said it best, I think. I didn't want the pressure of anything else."
And there it was. That tingle of
himself for sounding very much that he did care, Harry stormed from the loo and right to where he hid the Cloak and map. By the time he was under the Cloak and invisible, Malfoy was pushing through the door, whisper-yelling, "Potter!"
Dobby looked properly abashed, and Harry's immediate scolding to poke him or something next time didn't help. Guilt filled Harry when Dobby told him he was there to give Harry a Christmas present, so Harry lied and said he had one for Dobby as well. He thought shortly of giving Dobby a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, but Harry didn't want to subject any part of that man to anyone. So, instead, he gifted a pair of his own socks, black with the Hogwarts crest.
That, and as long as he didn't embarrass them, such as jumping so obviously into bed with someone and becoming the butt of gossip.
"It's alright, Hermione," Harry said, but he kept a hard scowl on Malfoy. "We'll just be a minute."
"Apparently!" Harry threw out his hands, barely missing Malfoy's face with his bag. He yelled out for the second entrance to open and stomped into the chamber.
. Harry was terrified the whole time. He sometimes still had nightmares, sometimes still slowed down when in that corridor just to make sure no more writing was on the wall. He sometimes thought he could still hear Riddle's voice, see him in the corner of his eye calling the basilisk forward.
She looked so hopeful, Harry could only grin at her. "As long as you lead."

That wasn't today though.

Though, perhaps he didn't know about that part. Harry was never sure exactly what got around the school as he never actually talked about outside of Ron and Hermione.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, mentally rehearsing what he was going to say.
"Are you alone?" Harry asked, despite already knowing he was.
"What?"
because he would have rather liked to have one.
Hermione chuckled. "By them being attracted to other men, Harry."
"I have a godfather." Harry crossed his arms.

Malfoy sighed loudly. "Already you're breaking your agreement to pay attention."
reporter," she answered, smiling brightly enough to show golden teeth.
"Yeah," Harry assured.
Some of that good feeling started twisting in annoyance again. "What? Why?"
Cautious, a bit distrustful of the owl as he was of its human, Harry slowly opened his window and let it in. It gave him a baleful look but stuck out its leg.
was cast during the night. Those were just side-effects of living with four other blokes. In fact, the first few times a boy would appear in his fantasies, he originally assumed it had to do with that somehow, like an unconscious link between wanking and boys because of his dormmates.
"Wow!" Harry gushed. He rushed over to hug her. "You look amazing, Hermione!" He stepped back and held out his hand to Krum. "Krum," he greeted.
Harry shrugged. "Maybe. But… I'd like to try."
"Something's dead in there, alright," Malfoy wheezed, using the back of his hand to still cover his nose and mouth—and most likely trying to keep from getting sick himself.
"As bad?" Ron grinned. "Yeah. Harry really showed them, with the dragon and all." Ron had been laying Harry's victory on thick whenever he could; Harry figured he was still making up for their fight.
, "do you honestly think I would do this to myself? I don't need gold, and I don't want fame!"
He straightened, deciding he was going to be proud to have his friend on his arm. "Yeah," he agreed. "But for the record, Luna, I'd be your friend even if you didn't come with me. You still don't have to."
Harry yanked out his wand, but Malfoy didn't even look at it and handed the book swiftly over.
Three words. He could settle for that.
Malfoy looked back at him, raising a pompous brow. "Here I thought you
"Why do they have to move in packs? How're you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?"
— would be rooting for Harry to succeed. Or just stay alive, which Malfoy clearly had to hope if he wanted to come back down—
"Just a bit warm. Better safe than sorry," Draco said easily, not wanting to worry them. At the same time, this ridiculousness had to stop. "Go on, I'll join you soon."
Snape slowly blinked at him, visibly processing that answer, then blinked at Luna. "Then go do it."
"Right," Malfoy drawled, eyes narrowed. "You expect me to believe someone—other than me—wants you dead so badly they would go through all this trouble. Right. Just like we're supposed to believe you fought the Dark Lord at eleven, slain a basilisk at twelve, and fought off hundreds of dementors at thirteen. No, it sounds to me like this is just another year where Precious Potter has found a way to make himself a hero of legends once again."
The two professors brushed past them, and Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy smirked again. "This is the
Harry groaned and buried his face in his hands. "I know!"
Malfoy looked like that was debatable but did finally seem to drop some more of his guard and came closer.
"Here we are," she said coming back. She handed Draco a potion. "Take this, and that should clear you up. Must be the weather."
Walking toward him.
Harry watched, a little pacified to see Malfoy jog down at the end of the corridor calling out for him, then the next. He swore loudly, said, "
dipped his quill in his ink and made some lines, connecting his symptoms that were more commonly related to each other. He frowned at it. The only ones that made sense were the ones suggesting he had a cold, flu, or something else mundane. Something Pepper-Up would solve. It left out the worst of them.
"I like grapefruit," Malfoy interrupted. The more Harry babbled, the softer Malfoy's expression had become, thus enabling the babbling. Malfoy's lips seemed to be fighting a smile, too, and Harry tried very hard not to look at them fully, jerking his eyes back up when he noticed them falling.
Draco stopped Greg from doodling, read over what Vinny had written, then set them about reading another section for what should come next in the essays. Depressed from the Healing books, his eyes started to wander instead.
"It's alright," he said. He had an urge to pat his shoulder or elbow or something and lifted his hand to do just that before he caught himself and let it fall away. Instead, he lit his wand. "Er, alright, it's this way."
Hermione rolled her eyes in an answer that told him he should have figured this revelation out a long time ago. She had known about him since they learned about veela, and Harry should have known about himself. In so many ways, he did, but he was simply terrified of it.
Harry froze. They had made it all the way to the other side of the large Chamber to the second entrance, but it was only then occurring to Harry that though Harry knew how to get
"Okay, see, this faucet, compared to this one?"
"Yeah," Harry said, holding out his hand. She didn't seem to notice. "Er, and you're Luna Lovegood."
"What?!" he squeaked, then cleared his throat, lowering his voice as pure panic spread throughout him. "What? What—no—no, I didn't—I don't—I don't think of—I'm not, I'm not like—I—"
"He—" Harry stopped himself. Did that mean Malfoy didn't know about Pettigrew? Would it mean anything to tell him? Did his father know about Pettigrew? Malfoy would most definitely tell him if he didn't. And if Lucius
Malfoy looked back, raising an eyebrow. "Aren't they called two-spirits?"
Luna let out a sound Harry assumed meant good humour. "I see. Don't worry, I know all the basic wizarding dances."
"... Wh—"
"Your hands," she smiled at him, reaching for his hand again. He watched as she smoothed her palm across the back of his. It was indeed dry. His head pounded.
Malfoy didn't answer.
He glowered upward, firmly telling himself that he was an absolute idiot and tosser because there were

this. That it was merely a concentrated effort of evil to corner Harry into humiliation and outcast him from everyone he loved. If not for the bloke thing then the whole Malfoy of it all.
"Oh?"
It was far-fetch reasoning, but, "Yeah, alright," he sighed, letting his arms drop. "Fine, Malfoy. Let me know when you're ready to come back down here, and we'll do it."
However, the more he thought about it, the more he really did believe that Malfoy wouldn't know of any outright plan against Harry. If he did, he would have known Harry didn't put his name in, and Harry would never have brought him down into the Chamber to prove himself.
have a psychopath."
witch, she could lead for you. You'd have to be the one dipped and twirled, though, so you might lose even more respect at that."
Her words were stern as always but with a kindness he had never heard from anyone before. It was gentle but unyielding, understanding yet inspiring as if daring him to explore every and any identity; as if the momentous realisations Harry had been having lately were merely molehills in her eyes—in the best of ways.
Harry was gaping at her. She peeked over at him quickly, and her mouth broke into a smug grin.
"The problem there is one, we don't know how the rot of lower intestines have affected the organs around it, and two, we don't know what else is in the water to have affected the tail. After all, we are for all intense and purposes, in a
Luna also proved as a good distraction as well. She easily began telling him about the Weird Sisters, a band that appeared were comprised of men although Luna called two of them non-binary before explaining they were individuals that didn't identify as either strictly male or female. Harry didn't know enough about the subject to have an opinion, but he could admit that none of the band members were exactly presenting as strictly either anyway.
Harry sighed. "You paranoid little… Okay, listen… I
Harry idly wondered if this was what he was starting to do the night before, but Harry only thought he was dragging his feet.
"Oh, we're just going platonically." She stopped and smiled at Harry before continuing to Malfoy. "We're friends now. Harry didn't want the pressure of a partner being anything else, and I'm quite looking forward to the decorations." She turned her dreamy expression back to Harry.  "I do hope they've taken proper precautions against nargles."
"Yeah," Harry nodded. He was steadfast staring at the wood of the bridge as they walked slowly, refusing to meet her eyes. "Y'know, things like… romance and stuff."
He straightened, grabbing her and pulling her into a fierce, tight hug. She made a surprised noise then chuckled, hugging back. Harry had to blow some of her hair from his face then stretched his neck to lay his chin on top of her head.
Licking his lips, as though wetting them with his own silva, always made them dry faster.
"Not my fault," Blaise, his current Potions partner, said to his expression.
Harry peeked up, and he found he couldn't regret his words. Not when they were causing Malfoy to look down as well, shifteing where he stood. His face was flushed, and a strand of his soft-looking hair really was falling in his eyes.
His hand moved on its own out of his pocket. He very gently nudged the strand for his finger to slide underneath, slowly using the momentum to steer it back and letting his fingertip skirt across Malfoy's skin.
"Your…" Harry tripped again attempting to look at her finally. "Your uncles?"
Malfoy snorted. "Don't presume to ever know a Slytherin based on public appearance, you moron."
Malfoy turned his head to look at the basilisk then again at his chest-work-station. Meanwhile, Harry looked at him, ignoring the way the soft light seemed to pour down his long neck and instead, trying to figure out what just happened.
"We're fine," Dean said with an obviously forced grin. "Need my fro-comb?"
Malfoy went still then barked a laugh.
"Mate, your getting toothpaste on the mirror."
Malfoy, whose face was only lit by the bright moonlight coming in through the window, blinked at the door a couple of times then said flatly, "Right. Yeah, I'm leaving."
"It's all right, Harry. I'll lead."
His, of course, was bloody, blasting
Whoever they were snorted hatefully at him, but Draco continued on his way, depositing the vials to be graded. He scooted down to the corner, turned his back to the room, and snuck out his travel goblet from his robe's pocket. He felt dismayed when he looked down at it—it was empty. That was right, he drained it when he went to one of the ingredient cupboards—
"'Well, yeah', he says," Malfoy mocked. "Listen, Potter, if nothing else I can accept that you have a lot going on right now, and therefore, might be even stupider than what I usually give you credit for—which I imagine is no easy accomplishment, so congratulations there."
think about certain people..." he trailed off, not knowing how to finish that without giving himself away and feeling panicked he already did. "Never mind."
"Then how do you know?" Malfoy asked, and his tone sounded so unfamiliar, Harry's head snapped back up.
He paused to shiver at the memory. He shook his head.
Harry could tell by her forced cheerfulness that Krum wasn't the one to upset her. He knew her well enough to know she wouldn't hide it if he was. So, when Krum sent him a questioning look over her head, Harry shrugged slightly to signal he didn't know.
But then there's were the utterly ridiculous: death by over-confidence; death by caviar; death by politeness and rudeness; death by trying to grow a beard; death by knife-wielding birds; death by Muggle packaging tape; even death by being trapped in a closet, which had Harry unexpectedly throwing his head back and bursting in loud laughter that startled Malfoy. He gaped at Harry while Harry tried to calm down, for once highly amused by the irony, and when he composed himself he grinned up at Malfoy.
Harry grinned to himself, jumping instead of answering. His landing still wasn't very smooth, and he was annoyed the Malfoy's landing was looking to already become practised.
Hermione jumped forward then. "They're very interesting, aren't they? Aren't they, Harry?"
Harry meant it when he said he thought Malfoy might have been the only person to really know him, but he had to admit, he assumed Malfoy knew him so well because Malfoy was just so good at pushing his buttons. Malfoy always knew exactly what to say or do to push Harry over the edge.
It was exactly as Harry remembered, only instead of simply a dead basilisk where he left it, there was a rotting one.
Please note, there is dialogue not just from the book, but also from the game Harry Potter Hogwarts Mystery.
"But I wasn't saying!" Harry yelped, feeling embarrassed and totally defensive. He knew she was the cleverest witch their age, but there was no way she could have already… unless he had done or said something in the past… but he was always so careful... "I wasn't! I didn't mean—I'm not—I'm not like that! I'm
echoed in his mind, and he squeezed his eyes shut, laughing quietly to himself.
"Oh, yes, you do," she replied, sounding stricter. "Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball."
"Well, Potter?"
They were well into the bridge at this point, and Harry hung his head, picking at the boards with the toe of his shoe. He shoved his hands in his pockets self-consciously, feeling his shoulder tense. Steeling himself, he repeated more clearly, "People who don't like the gender they're supposed to like."
"What, Malfoy, never been to the kitchens before?"
enough to warrant his attention and not him just being unhinged. That if he tried just a little bit, Malfoy would try just a little bit back, and maybe somebody that wasn't an evil-adjacent pompous bastard was underneath. That there was an excuse, some reason, for his cruel words and callous actions. That someone good could be inside that body that looked like it could go for miles… That he could be capable of kind smiles as he leaned over Harry, pressing that kind smile on those pink lips onto his throat—
. You mean so much to me."
His eyes landed next on Pansy a few tables over who was staring dreamingly at Draco. He held in a grimace as she waved at him and acknowledged her with slightly waved fingers. Stupid Pansy, too, being a stupid girl with her stupid blooming chest and stupid mother-henning and stupid smell and her stupid
The five boys left together. Dean complimented himself and Ron for getting the Patil sisters as their dates, declaring the girls the best looking of the school. The comment made Seamus storm off without a word but seemed to cheer Ron up some. Ron hadn't been thrilled with his partner, and Harry just hoped he wouldn't go as far as letting Padma know.
he felt until he smelled the water—a fact which he firmly told himself not to shove away altogether, to think on it later.
Hagrid laughed and set him down.
Hufflepuffs were apparently comfortable enough to disrobe in the greenhouses, and while he wasn't Justin Finch-Fletchy's biggest fan, the boy often would roll up his sleeves to work, sometimes even taking off his tie and unbuttoning his collar. He had a prominent collarbone and veiny arms, and really square palms that Harry thought would nicely make up for shorter fingers.
Madam Pomfrey tsked at him. "No need to be so dramatic, Mr Malfoy. It's only a hydrating potion that should also help reduce your fever. It's not that bad."
"We'll jus' lead 'em in here an' put the lids on, and we'll see what happens."
magic. Or, feel it differently, and so much more intensely. Whatever her spell told her, her eyebrows shot up. "You are very dehydrated indeed, Mr Malfoy. The fever is a bit high, but not worrisome currently."
As if whatever Harry was or was not would not change her support.
She mocked-glared at him and wagged a finger. "If you take one sip, mister…"
"Want one, Ron?" he snapped. Ron looked startled at having been addressed. "You could probably enlarge it, stick it to your Canon's poster. I can even autograph it for you, how's that?"
Of course, a paranoid part of his brain supplied, he could have just used Harry to get entrance into the Chamber, but Harry was the one who had offered. Like most things with Malfoy, getting him just to come down there was like pulling teeth.
As Snape swept back up to the front, calling for an immediate return to their work, Ron's hand latched onto his arm.
"You really think so?" the ghost sniffed.
and Skeeter, and Ron and the rest of the school, about feeling trapped and alone, about how much he wanted to just be normal—but on that, he only elaborated enough to say that he was confused about some things and some people…
"Why?" Malfoy asked. They were still paused in the same spot, Malfoy having gone back to looking at the partial basilisk skin.
A horrible smell hit them, causing both of them to gag and stumble back, using their own arms to fully cover their mouths and noses. The stench was so strong, Harry's eyes watered. He was helpless but to cough, trying very hard not to get sick, and suddenly, Malfoy was yelling something muffled by his arm, and the smell was gone.
"I don't think he was trying to insult Harry," Hermione tried, sounding tired.
Silence.
" behind his back.
He could tell she just barely kept from rolling her eyes. "Mr Malfoy, I have checked you over twice now, and I have found nothing—"
Harry forced himself to smile at Luna. "Thank you. I promise I'm not mad."
Harry bolted from his bed and into the toilets where he could pace freely.
"Shovel talk, really, Harry?" Hermione giggled. She then said to Krum, "It's a Muggle saying. It's something protective family members do, like 'if you hurt my sister, I'll hurt you' kind of thing."
"Why?" Malfoy questioned, looking Harry up and down. "What's wrong with you?"
Generally, lately, Harry had been avoiding the Great Hall whenever he could, which included sulking in his rooms until he couldn't put off leaving them any longer. Hermione had been waiting for him in the common room, and she had with her Rita Skeeter's article.
"Dunno. Hermione can hold her own, though."
"Not literally!" Hermione squeaked.
"Er, I don't think so. Just that, I only want to go with someone as friends, I'm not… I'm not interested in anything more. Oh, and I have to open the ball." He shifted on his feet. "We would open the Yule Ball with the other champions and their partners."
"Noted." Harry looked at his watch again. "Come on then."
"Right?" Harry grinned, especially at Hermione's blush darkening. She had taken a step closer to Krum, entangling her arm with his.

First, he sat by the low fire, finding himself daydreaming, as he so often did this time of year, how the hols would be if his parents were alive.
"—was up to par of my usual dedicated work but allowed me the opportunity for a more empirical application in my practice. Not to mention a ready excuse for when I was caught."
Some of them were eerily reasonable, considering Harry's life: struck down by evildoers, cursed by begrudged peers, sacrificing himself to save a friend, even just simply death by quite literally being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Those weren't so funny, and Harry wondered what it meant that Malfoy presented them as ideas so obvious, he was sure Harry had already used them.
Malfoy gaped. "No, you can't."
"Okay, okay," Harry raised his hands. "Alright, Malfoy. I wasn't serious. That's… good work."
Professor McGonagall squeezed his shoulders and gave him a rare smile, if only for a moment. "Individual preferences, I'm afraid, won't have any bearing on today. You must keep focused, Mr Potter. You have a much greater task on your hands."
It wasn't until later that they learned what veela did, and he could have kicked himself. He had nodded along, agreeing with the other boys as they described the feeling while inescapable hopelessness settling into him.
His face felt like it was on fire.
It was pathetic. He knew it was pathetic. But he couldn't take it; he just needed a break from constantly seeing the hateful faces, of hateful words being hissed at him. The whole thing with Malfoy was bringing back memories from when this happened in second year, which just continued to make him miserable.
"A bit," Harry agreed, standing and wiping his hands. "And I wouldn't let your face get too close to the ground. There are loads of bones down here."
"It's a long story," Harry said simply.
He scowled at her again, but apparently, that was all the help he was going to get. It was more than the last two times, at least. Draco struggled to stand, the potion heavy in his stomach, and slowly made his way out of the room.
he told himself.
Regardless of what he was or what he liked, there was still someone out there who wanted him dead and was going through great lengths to ensure it.
Harry grabbed one of the jars between the smallest and medium jars and approached Malfoy, still thinking of Hagrid. Malfoy flung out a hand without looking at him, and careful to avoid whatever was coating Malfoy's glove, Harry passed it over.
—almost like using magic drained him faster when he was like that. As if using magic worsened his state.
," Hermione hissed, jerking her head to the shelves. It was Krum, and Harry released a sigh as subtly as he could. Krum had also been spending a lot of time in the library, but unlike the rest of them, Krum came with a bunch of giggly girls who would watch him. "They only like him because he's famous! They wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that Wonky-Faint thing—"
Harry gave a slow nod back. "Okay."
"Absolutely," Harry answered her with a grin. "You two will make great friends!"
"How the bloody…" Malfoy mumbled, looking utterly unhappy and turning away again.
They both nodded to him and began writing more on their essay. Draco watched them fondly a moment. Transfiguration was their absolute worst subject.
, the mantra Harry had been repeating to himself.
It was a tremendous relief to have told Hermione, even more so because she so readily accepted him. He also felt much better about the ball with Hermione's idea.
Fun fact: Goosegrass has a mixed smell of new-mown hay and vanilla, making it the dried plant of choice that used to pack mattresses!
He went back to the list he was making of his symptoms.
, you'll be sorry."
"Some Potions require… let's say, not the freshest of meat."
here, Harry!" Skeeter cooed.
Anyway, long-winded here, but in this fic, I picture Draco being so upset with Harry's comment not because he isn't a cheat (we all know what he's like in Quidditch) but because academia is a particular sore spot for him. I'm going off canon that the only classes they have together is Potions, that flying class first year, and COMC third year and up. I don't think they were in more classes together, but if they were, please point them out! Otherwise, Harry doesn't really know how Malfoy is in class because his only real two experiences are Potions, where Snape is biased, and COMC, where Malfoy just mocks the whole time.
Harry scowled and crossed his arms, looking away.
What Malfoy would do with that information, Harry couldn't guess, but Harry's brain was apparently on a campaign to cause Harry great anguish because it unhelpfully supplied an image of what Malfoy could do to apologise for not believing Harry. After all, in the Chamber of Secrets, they would be alone without any chance of being interrupted. And why did his brain
To be honest, most of his wanks were hardly ever planned. He could tell, sometimes, when one of his dormmates was actively planning a wank. Their excitement of the activity was always pretty clear, and no one had to ask why a random
"Thank you, sir," Blaise said automatically.
"You are Harry Potter."
"Aah!"
"Indeed," Professor McGonagall agreed, physically turning Harry toward the medical tent. "Right then, Potter, the first aid tent,
"Well… I mean, yeah."
"That is both admittedly impressive yet equally disappointing," Malfoy said, looking interested despite himself.
He sighed, pulling out Sirius' letter again to re-read it.
"Of course. Even if I was mad, I still would. I'm your friend, remember?"
Hermione injected, "He won't. Malfoy actually helped Hagrid."
His dress robes were black and had many complicated parts to it. The seamstress at Madam Malkins walked him through which part went where, and Harry was pleased he mostly remembered the instructions. When he was finished, he returned to the mirror and inspected himself.
Harry sighed and scrubbed his sweaty hair from his forehead. His breathing had long since recovered as he laid there brooding, but he was still cooling off from his activity. He hadn't even pulled his pants back up, he realised, which he quickly remedied.
"This is going to be fantastic," Malfoy said with a small clap of his hands, making Harry jump.
Malfoy reach back? If Harry showed he was willing to take the first step, first
Harry nodded, hoping he wasn't misplacing his faith.
"Yeah, Harry, you seem more distracted than usual."
he did,
"They'll figure it out," Luna assured, and Harry and she made their way out of the Great Hall, through the quiet entrance hall, and outside to a winter wonderland.
He scowled at her. They stared at one another for a long moment, but Draco's discomfort won out. He opened the vial again, and, pinching his nose, tossed back the potion. It tasted viler than it smelled, and Draco was seriously worried he was going to be sick for several long moments. He clutched his stomach and scrunched his eyes.
"What?"
"For what we agreed on, you pillock. I'm ready to get started."
think about how priceless—
She held up a finger, telling him to wait, and disappeared into her office. He must have been very dehydrated this time. The last two times, she just told him he was slightly dehydrated, nothing a couple of glasses of water wouldn't fix.
Malfoy cleared his throat.  "It will take the rest of our time here tonight, maybe another night, for me to Vanish the decomposition." He sounded oddly formal, and even though Harry still wasn't looking, he could tell by the sounds that he had gone back to his little chest-work-station. "Basilisks decompose slower than I remembered, but it's tricky. Some parts decompose at regular speeds, and those are mostly internal. It's lower intestines, for example, will be absolutely worthless now. Whereas, its tail, that has been in the water this whole time, I'm assuming—please correct me if I'm wrong—would have been in the third phase of decomposition if it wasn't for the water.
He watched them go, dragging his feet behind them. They were one of the last to leave, so he simply slowed his pace more and more until most everyone was already in the Great Hall, then he made his way up the marble staircase.
. It cried for you."
"You don't actually believe a word of that article, do you?" Harry asked, sounding flat to his own ears. He was curious, though. He found he truly wanted to know what Malfoy thought.
He was pleased himself, he supposed. He didn't get a definitive answer whether Malfoy believed him or not, and he didn't want to appear so pathetic as to actually ask, but Malfoy had said 'okay'. It was perhaps a foolishly optimistic hope, but it was still hope that Malfoy
"He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I'd bet everything that's why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year—to keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place."
It twisted something ugly in his stomach thinking about being in her shoes. He had been questioned by Ron a few times why he insisted on taking Luna Lovegood under the strict rule of
Once back in the dorm, Harry stood in front of his mirror, only in a towel himself now, and observed himself. He felt like he spent so much of his time thinking about what and to whom he was attracted, he rarely paused to wonder if others found
"Erm," he cleared his throat, gently taking his hand back. "Thanks, but no thanks. I have my own. Well, boys?" Draco addressed Vinny and Greg who were still frowning at their textbooks. "That should be good enough for tonight, yeah?"
what Malfoy's lips looked like and had imagined what they felt like.
Harry should mock him. Or point a finger and accuse him of hypocrisy. Or use the admittance against him somehow. Instead, he found himself taking a step forward, lips smiling on their own. "Don't worry, even Muggles are behind on Muggle technology. My aunt wouldn't know what to do with a computer even with the instruction manual."
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn't laughing, but he wasn't sticking up for Harry either. It made Harry's chest tightened even more.
Harry caught on that they were most likely talking about the ball, and he privately thought Malfoy's assurances were debatable. Then Malfoy smirked over his shoulder at Harry, and Harry knew he heard him come in.
," in Parseltongue.
Back at Gryffindor tower, Harry pulled off the Cloak and stood frozen in the middle of the common room. The non-dragon fire in the fireplace was the only source of light, other than the
"Where is Aarav?"
as friends? No potential anything between me and her?"
What was probably the most unhelpful and ridiculous thing about it, however, was that currently, Harry felt like he had an opportunity to gain an ally. Which if that didn't speak to how lonely and desperate he had been feeling lately, he didn't know what would.
Cautiously, Harry looked back at her. She looked just as stringent as ever, but her eyes shone with understanding. Harry suddenly felt her words from the day before, that unspoken challenge to be brave enough to explore his own identity.
thing he was going to do was to get teared up over this, even if they were just tears of pure fury.
Malfoy's jaw visibly tightened. "You flew out?"
"You guys okay?" Harry asked.
If the valet was surprised, he didn't let it show. He took his next orders with grace and left the room.
"Oh my god, Potter, you're serious. Are you really this delusional?"
And Harry could
Harry felt humiliated at the thought as well. He couldn't imagine going back to Professor McGonagall and Hermione to tell them that he was mistaken.
Every rehearsed word died in his throat. He anxiously gathered any ounce of courage he had and managed to croak, "I didn't mean it. Yesterday. I didn't… I… I'm not..."
Harry shook his head. "Sorry. You know, I was indifferent."
And it was a bark, Harry knew now. It was artistic in its own way, haughty and posh, yet musical and free. It took hearing it a couple of times to know why it reminded him of Sirius because the sound was so different, but it was most definitely a bark of laughter.
, really handsome. His jaw and cheekbones could probably cut glass, and his eyes were so bright—and unguarded, unlike some people he could name.
He stumbled to the sink, to rinse out his mouth and splash his face, but the moment he smelled the water, he almost lost it. It felt like the potion dehydrated him more, if possible. He didn't realise how
"And?"
Harry skived off the next day.
Harry's "willyougototheballwithme" is obviously not happening, but I substituted it.
"Harry! That's
"If that's cheating, then
It was the tournament's fault as well. If he wasn't in the bloody thing, he might have been able to put off even thinking about it. Firmly placing it in the avoidance bin in his mind and cozied up to denial like the old friend it was. Instead, he cracked under the pressure of everything, making him focus on the easier question of,
On the way across the grounds, he discovered he potentially had
"Sure."
"Have you noticed…" Hermione opened, sounding careful, "that some of the Slytherins haven't been…"
On the other hand, everything was just as miserable as it had been lately, and the idea of secretly meeting up with Malfoy sent flutters in his stomach. He was extremely curious if more meetings
Harry shook his head with the mental note to give them some space. He gelled his hair and got it in as much control as he could. He couldn't stop it from being a mess, but he could at least make it look like a
"We'll be happy to be your friends," Ginny pipped up. "Right, Harry?"
Malfoy had stopped too. "...What?" he asked suspiciously.
"That—… Harry. You… You are either the bravest or stupidest person I have ever met."
"Enjoyed the peace?" Harry suggested bitterly, hunching over the bridge's side to stare gloomily out.
, and it just happened again because he just really wanted a good pull. That was
Hermione nodded sadly, tucking her arm around his. "I understand. I can only imagine what that Skeeter devil would say."
They arrived in the dungeons right when Snape was opening the doors, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their spot with Neville in the back, partnering up respectively.
, and just began talking.
," Malfoy pressed over his interruption, "I encountered all manner of foul information about creatures not even your basilisk and dragon-slaying self could manage."
"No one else ever talked about it, so I just didn't bring it up, I guess. Some kids made fun of me in primary, but here, the chance of anyone knowing I had gay Muggle uncles were so low, I just sort of... "
Harry was gaping from it to her. He was pretty sure his face was getting stuck in that expression.
Schooling his features, Harry carefully stepped behind a suit of armour to hide his Cloak and map (he definitely didn't want Malfoy knowing about those) and then stepped out.
"Well, you cheat at everything else!"
"Mhm. That's how I found it."
They returned to the commons to learn of Ron's abysmal attempt at asking Fluer, and with the renewed knowledge that Fluer was half-veela, Harry suddenly remembered the World Cup.
"Yes, I'm very happy to have this opportunity. I've heard great things about the ball, and I get to help a new friend."
Harry sighed at his reflection and decided just to get dressed.
"Sir?" his valet asked, no doubt also tipped off with the Killing Curse.
Slowly, Malfoy looked at him over his shoulder, frown visible and suspicion sharp. "Why?"
"Snape doesn't twirl."
, I don't think—"
"Wh-... what was… what was that spell?" Harry managed to ask. He couldn't say the stench was actually gone, exactly, nor was he really breathing any type of fresh air, but it did feel like there was an invisible bubble around his head, filtering the air and cleaning it.
Malfoy sighed. "You are hopeless, Potter. Truly hopeless."
The valet waited a respectable amount of time after Nicholas swore loudly, threw the scroll in the fire, and began cursing furniture. "Sir?"
Sirius kept urging him to be watchful. To be good, out of the way, but watchful, and to report back anything unusual.
That was more of a blow than Harry cared to admit. He crossed his arms again, looking away. His fear for the first task had disappeared since the beginning of this conversation—or was it a fight now—but it was coming back with full force. If only Ron had waited at least a few more minutes before nosing down in the common room, he could be practising whatever spell Sirius was going to tell him.
"Who here can tell me the importance of adding the drops of frog blood last?" Professor Snape asked the class.
Harry groaned. "With the Slytherins."
She lit up at the mention of having another friend, and Harry vowed to introduce them as soon as possible.
"Harry…" Hermione sighed. They were on their way back from Herbology, and Harry's little tumble almost caused her and Ron one as well.
"I know that! I just… why did I not know this? Why have you never said?"
"—and that you can't control who you're attracted to. I don't see anything wrong with it, and my uncles certainly don't."
"Er, thanks," Harry tried, taking the letter. He looked around for owl treats only to have to resort to borrowing some of Seamus'. The eagle owl took the treat but didn't leave, so Harry figured it was waiting for a reply from Harry.
Luna began engaging the swan, allowing pauses wherein the swan presumably provided replies. Harry slowly backed away, deciding to give her and the sculpture a little more privacy.
"It's all anybody is talking about," Myrtle said mournfully.
Lavender stiffened in her seat, shoving a magazine down in her bag with her foot. "Uh… is it… the smell?"
"Malfoy does look exceptional tonight," Luna contributed.
"One wizard by himself can't defeat a dragon."
As he turned to follow Professor McGonagall out, he caught sight of the Slytherin table. Karkaroff was leading Victor Krum out, the headmaster looking excited but Krum looking serious and solemn. Unable to help himself, Harry searched the rest of the table, seeking out blond hair. When he found him, Malfoy was already looking at him, expression bored. When they locked eyes, however, Malfoy's face briefly flickered through several emotions Harry couldn't name, then he gave Harry a slow, albeit small, nod.
Snape let out a growl and waved his wand, their potion instantly disappearing with a loud whistle that, if Snape's shout of his name didn't get their attention, had everyone looking over.
It was Malfoy. He was looking around, checking that they were alone before looking at Harry. He raised an eyebrow at all the books and glared at him.
"No."
He looked back over his shoulder, clearly expecting that to be a jab against Harry, but Harry shrugged in agreement.
"Look, there were other circumstances around the Chamber being opened," Harry replied defensively. "And I have no idea how much you do and don't know, and if you don't know, I don't think I should be the one to tell you."
Malfoy, one hand in his pocket and looking as casual as ever, merely looked down at the nails of his other hand. "Haven't seen Potter around, hm?"
Some of them were admittedly depressing: dying alone from a home accident and not being found for days because no one cared to look in on him; committing suicide because he was so miserable and no one ever found out and his name went down forever as merely missing when people eventually noticed he was gone, being murdered because a loved one finally got sick of looking at him. Despite that, they were still funny, or at least they were the way Malfoy presented them.
"Homework?" he asked, knowing he sounded unimpressed.
"I suppose…" Harry squinted around. "Big, big Chamber."
"Indeed," Nicholas growled. "Until we clean the bloodline."
He rubbed his forehead, a headache coming back. It was generally a headache first before everything else started up.
"Oh, come off it," Malfoy argued back. "You're right, I
What Harry thought was the second scenario was Malfoy showing up, but after being told the entrance was in the girls' toilet, not believe Harry, hex him to an inch of his life, and then tell the

Harry couldn't breathe.
And Malfoy himself seemed to have lit up. He had a smile on his face, a genuine one, and his eyes seemed to dance in mirth. He looked so pleased, Harry could…
this?
"Of course," Malfoy waved a hand, dismissing Harry. "I'll need several tools, as well. Storage will be a problem, but once I remove that which is already rotten, with a few charms, I suppose we could store it here. Merlin knows the Chamber's big enough."
Both girls looked lovely, Ginny in pink robes with delicate laces that actually looked to belong, and Luna was in a midnight blue dress that dipped in the back with her hair in a braided updo and dangling earrings that looked like shooting stars. Harry didn't get a chance to compliment either one of them, however, as Luna immediately began a monologue about legendary Christmas trees.
Harry thought he could return the sentiment at the moment. But Malfoy abruptly turned back to his work and continued, so Harry didn't question him. Just shook his head and added the death to the list.
It made Harry wonder once again if Malfoy knew his father's role that year.
"You…" Malfoy gave a quiet laugh—a real one, at that, his lips giving way to the smile. "You used to
Also, a headcanon I see often is applied here, which is Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts weren't exactly legal.
Looking for any out, Harry asked Luna, "Do you want to talk with the ice sculptures now?"
He groaned, feeling his cheeks heat, and let his head fall to the table.
Malfoy's hard eyes examined Harry's face for several long moments, and Harry wanted to punch him. He felt more determined now more than ever to
Malfoy yelped and shot up, scrubbing his face. Harry resisted the urge to laugh at him.
"Oh, yes, Potter, this is really convincing me you did what you said you did."
Merlin, that was satisfying. Just satisfying enough to get his wits about him; he straightened, turned off the faucet, and casually picked up a cloth to dry his hands. He peeked over his shoulder, but the only person who seemed to have seen was bloody Potter, and like Potter wasn't philistine enough to drink from a sink anyway.
"I do not believe Mr Malfoy is an ice sculpture, Mr Potter."
"That was excellent, Potter!" Professor McGonagall cried, which Harry considered high praise hard-earned. Her hand was visibly shaking as she pointed toward his bleeding shoulder where her hand had been just an hour or so before. "You'll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score… Over there, she's had to mop up Diggory already…"
transfigures a target, which could be anything, instead of a transfiguration of one specific thing into another specific thing." He flipped a few pages back, making sure Greg was listening too. "Read through this again where it explains how this is possible by a basic understanding of your objective and recalling the facts of the rabbit you'll change it into."
Because this was his life, not that stupid fantasy. His reality didn't feature a Malfoy who smiled lopsidedly, even if it was still cocky, who had miles of pale skin and would use his smooth, posh voice to encourage Harry to touch him. Nowhere in his reality would or could there be a Malfoy who would ever even
Malfoy had taken another step closer, and that and the confusion of what Malfoy was saying made Harry a little dizzy. He wasn't sure what Malfoy was saying, but trying not to look stupid, he assumed, "You're up to date on Muggle things?"
O.O I had meant to post this one last week, didn't I? In my defence… well, I completely forgot, not to put too fine a point on it. Let's see if I can get the next post ready to make up for it.
"Er…" Harry shuffled on his feet, extracting his arm from Luna to rub the back of his head. "I just mean… I mean, you both look… but yeah, you… erm…"
I would like to thank everyone who complimented my Luna! It did give me the courage to include her the way I wanted. For the record, I'm not just having her to be weird just to be weird. I have a tentative plan with her and will explain the ice sculpture thing. (Which, I thought was a thing, but in looking at the book again, it was just stone statues. Oh well. Here be ice sculptures. Also, I forgot there was a point in which Malfoy and Parkinson were described with their outfits, so yeah, those are different as well. Mine are better. It's because we're queer.)
The lifted dialogue here is from the chapter The Unexpected Task where McGo discusses the ball and Harry's line about girls travelling in packs. That last one is just because I've always thought it was so funny.
"Are we going to be rabbits? Or other students?" Vinny asked.
|Tomorrow then

Finally, for my mother's well-wishers, she is doing a lot better. Still at the facility and needing 24/7 oxygen and care, but better. She is determined she will be going /home/, not another facility or residential care. My sister and I are working very hard to get her home up to snuff, but it will be a while. If anyone wants to send wishes, I will continue to send or make cards to send her. The others really did brighten her so, so much.
Harry found himself pleased when Malfoy was already waiting for him. He snuck behind the same suit of armour to hide his things then slipped out, causing Malfoy to once again jump.
He looked at his reflection, white-blond hair dripping and flat, the front of his robes and the sleeves positively soaked through, and him, his skin, looking somehow refreshed.
Malfoy was still in the Slytherin commons when Harry arrived outside Moaning Myrtle's toilet. Harry supposed if Malfoy was not going to show up, Harry could eventually tell via the map. He would just go back to his commons and forget the whole thing.
Harry was freezing, so he made a beeline to the showers. He decided to at least try to make an effort and borrow some scented soap from one of the older boys also in there. The boy in question was in just a towel, fresh from a shower himself, and had to bend over to dig in his shower caddy. Harry allowed himself to watch and when the boy handed the soap over, asked to borrow his scented shampoo as well, sending the boy bending over again.
Snape
"Then what happened?" Malfoy prompted after a few moments.
"I—I—I mean, I—I meant—I didn't—"
"What?"
He stopped himself from finishing that thought. Oh yes, the avoidance bin in his mind was quite full.
"This information is extremely important, Potter. With how you go stomping into any and everything, you would get yourself killed if you did this."
Sirius gave him a small smile. "I don't think it was a false alarm. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one's going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye's heard intruders a bit too often, but that doesn't mean he can't still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had."
It was slow going, as Harry didn't have it in him to be creative at the moment, but after the third time Malfoy interrupted him to grab one thing or another, inspiration struck.
He scowled at Malfoy, who he decided was solely to blame for this. "Why are you even enrolled in Care of Magical Creatures?"
a cheat again, Potter."
The humiliation alone was enough to make him wish the dragon had finished him off. Professor McGonagall didn't seem like the type of person to tolerate the likes of something like
She gave him a watery smile and reached for Krum's hand, who didn't protest. They weaved their way through the crowd, presumably to find a better dancing spot.
Sighing, he went back to his reading, hating himself that he already marked the month his supposed symptoms started, which was over the summer, meaning Potter probably wasn't the one to curse him. He idly wondered if he could still somehow make all of it Potter's fault.
"What do you want?"
His head pounded and his eyes blurred when he tried to focus on his book. For a moment, it felt and sounded like his pulse was in his ears. He squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head.
"Indeed they are," Hermione said tightly.
"Just forget it, Hermione."
I know this is a shorter chapter, but the next one is the Yule Ball. I wanted it separate and didn't want anyone to wait a whole week for a small thing again.
Harry smiled. "I can handle weird."
"I won't lie and say that there wouldn't be some push-back, and no doubt that such a public display would fuel the
"Harry, you were brilliant! You were amazing! You really were!" Hermione called. Harry could see what looked like fingernail indentions on her cheeks.
He swallowed, rolling over onto his stomach to bury his head underneath his pillow.

Who? H-How do people just do that?"
"... Alone?"
He looked back up, and Snape had moved on to continuously wander around the room, watching his students. Malfoy had sat down and was writing inside a small diary of some kind, every now and then looking up at his notes or his potion before writing again. Crabbe beside him was also sitting, chin rested in his hand, and was using Malfoy's stirring rod to flick at the flames. Harry stretched a little to look at the potion itself and saw it was a dark brown colour.
Again, Harry was lost to the thread of conversation. He could hear Hermione was saying something, her tone sharp, but he could only remember that the last thing said was Luna's compliment. Without any consultation to his brain, he opened his mouth and words fell out.
Malfoy tensed for a brief moment. "There's nothing to tell," he said, inflecting a bored voice. "He gives me presents on appropriate occasions and attends my family's galas." He shrugged. "He's lucky to have me."
Malfoy groaned, rolling onto his stomach. "That was unpleasant."
"Why?" Malfoy asked again, sounding extremely hesitant.
"Your history?" Skeeter asked, perking up.
Harry jerked around to see Malfoy, who originally had been one of the leaders inside Hagrid's hut to escape the skrewts, striding toward Skeeter with a shit-eating grin.
"I'm proud of you, Harry," Hermione said. Harry dragged his wide eyes away from the professor to look at her. She seemed very cautious and was frowning, but she still gave a quick, small smile. "That was very big of you."
"Mr Potter," Professor McGonagall interrupted quietly. "I believe I said I was proud of you. I see no reason for further discussion."
He and Ron had perfected procrastination at this point, after all, so he tried to keep his head down, distracting himself when he wasn't quietly panicking and trying not to brood.
He had about another hour before lessons began, and if he was going to have any hope of surviving the day, he needed to get his emotions under control.
Harry had done more than just the first task, however, didn't he? He had told Professor McGonagall—
, and I have no idea what's down there."
They decided to take their own butterbeer break and walked together toward the buffet. It was here that Ludo Bagman found them, wasting no time in starting in about Harry's lead in the tournament and subtly offering his help.
know you, so you can't lie to me that you didn't at least think of being a Hogwarts Champion."
Harry was grinning madly. He
"Oh. Okay," Harry agreed readily, shoving his hands in his pockets.
"Oh, piss off," Harry rolled his eyes, turning to leave.
"What?"
It echoed throughout the Chamber and made Malfoy click his jaw shut.
was an experience he could have done without.
Ginny had stepped aside, seeming contented to let the cards fall where they may. She just smirked when Harry looked to her for help. Harry looked back at Luna. "Er… Ginny said that you might be willing to go to the ball with me? As just friends?"
Harry had no idea what nargles were much like he didn't know about Gristling Waterbats, but like before, he went with it. If nothing else than to rub his newfound friend in Malfoy's face.
don't want to find out what Malfoy would do if any rumours got started about us."
He had the sinking feeling that everything was coming to a head. That morning he could delude himself that he still had time, but now the pressure was making it hard for his lungs. He was worried what Sirius was going to say, let alone what he thought about everything, and he was worried exactly what Hagrid would deem so important. And he was still terrified of the first task, he seemed to have a mental block in all his subjects, Ron was still being a right git…
Hermione pursed her lips, thinking. "I could ask around…"
"What do you want?" Hermione asked,  crossing her arms.
"They don't exist!" he snapped once when Luna mentioned to him that something called Blinkweses had a habit of locking themselves in briefcases by chewing on the metal latches.
Was it a test for Malfoy? A way Snape was showing extra favouritism by challenging him, stretching his knowledge to make conclusions on his own that Snape usually just told other students.
their parts are?! The venom alone, not to mention their eyes, their teeth, their bones—their
Malfoy nodded, accepting, eyes studying Harry's face.
"... What are my thoughts on things?"
So, if Malfoy did know anything, he wouldn't know its significance. Harry was fairly confident about that. But getting Malfoy to tell him anything he might know?
"I'm not cancelling," he told him, going back to the book. "Same time, same place."
On the way back to Gryffindor Tower, they passed by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle who were on their way to the dungeons, most likely.
. A vivid wet dream, and a truly haunting realisation that he really
Harry ignored the jab. "So, you're not… with anyone?"
Later, as he stood invisible in the forest staring at four dragons, Harry wondered if he killed kittens or something in his past life to have deserved this. The dragons stood tall, strong, and seemingly invincible, breathing actual fire with roars that, if there were words attached to them, probably would burn just as much. He hated how his brain—almost poetically—compared them to the boy he left to see them, how similar they and the boy with their namesake were. And how dangerous they both were to him, yet both seemingly inescapable.
Krum nodded slowly, and Hermione plucked Krum's drink from his hands and shoved it at Harry as well.
"Fine. Good." Malfoy grabbed one of the books, pulling it to him. Harry shot a hand out and snatched it back. "You have always been a terrible procrastinator, you know, Potter."
"That's ominous," Draco sighed but surprisingly sounded like he was caving. "Are we almost there?"
As they began the trek to the second entrance, Malfoy began speaking.
When they got to the entrance hall, Harry checked the coast was clear before letting them out.
"No, it's—it's normal. Whatever it is…" she then looked stern though her eyes were wide, "as long as it's healthy, Harry! You know, it's very easy to let emotions get the better of you. You don't want to get stuck in—in something where you're constantly being undermined and insulted and—"
"Of course not, because Perfect Potter still has his secrets!"
Harry quickly lost the thread of the conversation, however, because coming up from the dungeons was Draco sodding Malfoy.
Like being small and desperately wanting Aunt Petunia's affection, so when he heard her shriek of a vile, disgusting thing such as homosexuality displayed in one of Dudley's programmes, he vowed to hold such an issue to her estimate. Or Uncle Vernon raging about new discrimination laws and how no one should have to be subjected to such filth as pillow biters in the workplace. Or Dudley casually mentioning a schoolmate had two moms, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's uproar of how sinful and unnatural it was, how those kinds of foul excuses for people shouldn't be allowed children. That they infected young, innocent children's minds and corrupted them.
It took some wiggling, but Harry was able to make it through. Though Malfoy was taller, he was also narrower in frame, so it didn't take nearly as much wiggling. Harry still offered Malfoy a hand and told himself he wasn't disappointed when Malfoy scoffed at it.
"We can walk the bridge," Harry tried. "Doesn't get too windy there."
"Rita Skeeter,
"My uncle Gary and his partner Leremy," she said easily, keeping her head up and straight forward. "They've been together my whole life. I know it's probably unusual here, still a little in the Muggle world, but my uncles have been together, out and proud, for… twenty years now? Going on twenty."
One commenter, MayeTaisho, gave the suggestion that the little dragon would make for a great gift! I agree, and thank you for the great idea! It also gave me another, so who gives it to whom… give you one guess where the dragon went in this chap.
He spent the night glowering at the ceiling in his four-poster bed, adamantly refusing to do anything else but wholly blame the bed for his situation. After all, it was in this very bed that he let himself wank for the first time. Let himself pull while thinking of people he knew. Gave over to fantasies and let himself chase what felt right instead of forcing himself to what didn't, let himself explore what felt good to him, admit with whom he would want to do it, all of which made a glaring sign of what exactly he was.
"Mr Potter?" Professor McGonagall charged through the door, fully dressed and face serious. She looked around the empty room before focusing on Harry.
"Gay," she said slowly like he was a child.
Harry snorted loudly, slinging back more comfortably to watch the light snow falling.
Long note, sorry!
"You think?" Malfoy hissed, shoulders shaking harder.
Professor McGonagall finally let go of his shoulder only to pat it. "You aren't alone. Now, go, get in there."
He wanted to bring his list to Madam Pomfrey, but Merlin, she really didn't like him. He didn't think she would take him seriously.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned back around. He was flipping through another book now, and Harry scooted a little closer to see it was their Charms textbook.
Harry swallowed thickly and flicked his bed curtains open a little to see out the window. He scowled at it.
"Really? That would be… very cool, actually."
Luna tilted her head. "Okay."
juice!"
The only thing Harry had, his only saving grace, was the letter he received from Sirius later that night and the prospect of talking to his godfather face-to-face in a fortnight.
"And for the record, Mr Potter, '
He avoided Malfoy. He refused to even look at him, even when Malfoy tried addressing him with hateful, and admittedly hurtful remarks with his Slytherins. Hermione noticed, had asked, but Harry brushed her off.
review. You understand, of course."
Ron had called him bonkers, Hermione pointedly interrogated why his attitude had suddenly changed, and Neville stared at him in awe. Harry shrugged them off and took pleasure later reaping the rewards of Malfoy's changing behaviour.
"Draco," Greg said, "how does having a better understanding of the rabbit help?"
"Harry… whoever put your name in the Goblet—I—I reckon they're trying to do you in!"
Harry felt that coldness return. "I… I don't either."
vision. No, those are… er, televisions."
"Hey, Dean," he called, "can I borrow some gel?"
Malfoy didn't entirely sound like he believed him, and that stung in and of itself that Malfoy could actually believe Harry had said anything like that. Just like it stung that Ron would actually believe Harry put his name in the Goblet.
Harry was grateful that Malfoy sounded so hateful because he felt like that last statement would have had a different effect on Harry in any other tone. "I'm not hexing you," Harry sighed. "I really do want to show you the Chamber of Secrets."
Malfoy was silent a moment as he shelved the last of his books. "You did?"
Harry was whipping his wand out in no time, ready to hex Malfoy into next week, even though he himself just snapped at Ron.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What for?"
He scratched at his itchy arm, watching as small flecks of skin danced off him and floated to the floor.
Harry shivered.
"Yes, we've established we all look good," Hermione said, sounding a little faint.
Malfoy looked like he didn't know rather Harry was insane and he should laugh at him, or Harry was insane and he should run for the hills.
"It would be really nice to have a friend," Luna nodded.
"All I'm saying is—"
Harry refocused on the books in front of him, re-reading a paragraph on dragon talons that once might have been boring to him but was now bloody terrifying. He was so busy imagining just how painful being gutted by one could be that he almost didn't notice when a shadow fell over him.
everything, you git!"
When Dobby declared that the store must have made a mistake as the socks were the same, Ron gifted him with a pair of his own that he had just unwrapped so Dobby could mix them. Harry didn't know why Ron had taken such a liking to Dobby, but he approved.
He was admittedly, and begrudgingly, impressed. Malfoy seemed to be keeping his own hand-written recipe book, the diary Harry had seen him writing in last time, and although he took notes as the rest of the class did, he seemed to combine them all together in the diary along with Merlin knew what else. It did, however, give him plenty of opportunities to copy him. He naturally did a few things wrong, but his potion turned out more acceptable than usual.
Harry tripped. "What?"
"So, what, you want to be a Potions Master?" He snorted. "A mini-Snape?"
Malfoy then lifted his head fully, looking Harry balefully in the eye.
"Er…" Harry fidgeted. "I need to see Professor McGonagall, sir."
A large portion of the obviously rotten flesh across the basilisk's belly vanished. Harry blinked, begrudgingly impressed. They had been working on the Summoning Charm all week, and Harry still couldn't even get the wand movements right. Harry was honestly just poking at a clear sour spot for the boy, but perhaps it was a bigger button than he realised.
"Luna!" he called. "It's curfew!"
"I'm afraid not," interrupted a pompous voice.
Harry had to shake himself out of his shock. "I can prove it."
He straightened his back and lifted his head high. "Yes, Professor."
"We do have quite some time," Malfoy drawled, going back to his organising.
"Here," Harry said, finding the right sink. He looked over his shoulder to gesture Malfoy over. Malfoy approached cautiously, wand still out but at least not up and ready to curse Harry. "You can come closer, you git, I don't bite."
"I have you know I've been asked plenty, thank you," Malfoy snapped.
, allowing him the simple gratification of observing whatever he liked. The experience sprouted holes so deep in his avoidance bin that old memories Harry had been doing well without resurfaced.
That first fantasy of Malfoy had been a good one though. He believed it started with imagining an encounter with him in the locker room. He thought maybe he originally imagined that Malfoy had been waiting there, pouting until the pitch was clear, and Harry walked in to use those showers instead of just going back to the castle with Ron. And Malfoy would have gotten flustered over having been caught trying to wait them out, and Harry would have called him on it, and it would lead to them arguing, which would lead to them pushing at each other…
Professor Snape hummed, looking at him critically. Then he moved on.
That afternoon, Harry and Hermione joined the Weasleys on the grounds for a snowball war. As the Great Hall was being decorated for the ball, there was no Christmas tea like usual, so they were able to play four-sevens. Hermione, however, left early to get ready for the ball, which apparently was going to take her three whole hours.
They stood there staring at each for several moments. The fairy lights danced around Malfoy, his expression not exactly open, but not closed off either. As they stared at each other, it began to snow, and in that moment, Malfoy was beautiful.
Draco's lips gave a reluctant smile, feeling proud of his friend. "For this, yes."
And if anyone is worried about how they bridge together, the Yule Ball makes big steps, mostly because of Luna. That is already written-BUT, if anyone has any ideas or wishes, please let me know!! I absolutely will put it in if I can!!
Harry, though, was pretty sure what Malfoy actually meant. Malfoy smirked back, telling Hermione that her words did have a nice ring to them, but Harry was tugging at Hermione's sleeve, trying to gently tug toward an empty classroom. Hermione fell silent, glaring at Malfoy but obviously trying to think quickly what Harry meant. He tugged again and used his foot to quietly kick open the door a little. Hermione frowned at the door, glared back at Malfoy, and gestured to the room.
"Mr Potter? Are you alright—is something wrong?"
"You alright?" Vinny asked, coming up to him with Greg in tow.
Malfoy and Parkinson quickly scurried away.
"Yes. Hello there," Luna greeted.
She grinned and nodded, saying an enthusiastic goodbye to the sculpture and wishing it a happy melting. Harry cast a warming charm on her when she reached him, it only now occurring to Harry how cold it was and that Luna didn't have a coat.
"Potter!"
Heads up, there's some homophobic language in this chapter.
Skeeter looked incredibly pleased, her green Quick-Quote Quill and parchment zooming out of her handbag.
Harry tried to leave as early as he could, but he was pushing it. It took a while to get down into the Chamber and Merlin knew how long it took to get back up, then he had to meet Hagrid at midnight and Sirius at one. It was too tight, and something was probably going to have to give, especially if he couldn't somehow get Hagrid to finish whatever he wanted early so he could be sure not to miss Sirius.
"Thank you, Harry, Luna. Viktor, these are two friends of mine. Harry, as you know, is one of my best friends. He's like a brother to me."
A challenge rose in Harry. He couldn't believe that Malfoy,
Harry gulped and shoved his own hands in his pockets. Malfoy paused briefly at that but continued, probably because Harry wasn't drawing a wand.
He resolutely decided he was the idiot Malfoy always claimed him to be, and he thought maybe, perhaps, he needed to take a break from wanking altogether.
"I know. But we were quicker and cast
Krum came up from behind her, holding two butterbeers. Hermione straightened, physically slamming a bright expression on her face so quickly, Harry wondered if it hurt. "Viktor! There you are!"
Harry looked back up at Snape, meeting his cold eyes. He could almost hear Malfoy taunting him with how Gryffindor this was, but he made a snap decision to go with his impulse and take a leap of faith.
Draco snorted. "Right. Thanks."
"Watch it, Malfoy."
She smirked. "Lovely… I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The
"Are you upset?" he asked her. "I not take too long with drinks?"
"Dress robes will be worn, and the ball will start at eight o'clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall. Now then… The Yule Ball is, of course, a chance for us all to—er—let our hair down." She sounded woefully disapproving, and Harry eyed the professor's tight bun. "But that does
"I don't know," Sirius answered softly. "I just don't know… Karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that Goblet did it for a reason, and I can't help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident."
"Sure," she readily agreed.
It only made Harry grin a little again, however, and he looked back to the sink and opened it. Without waiting for Malfoy, he jumped.
Harry wiped the map blank, chucked it, and shoved his head under his pillow. He made himself review his current History of Magic essay, the most boring thing he could think of until he eventually fell into an uneasy sleep.
"You're to go in here with the other champions." Her voice was slightly shaky but sounded determined all the same. "Mr Bagman is in there… he'll be telling you the—the procedure… Good luck."
"But aren't you two…?"
It took a moment for the words to process in Harry's brain, but when they did, he sat up straight. "Illegal?"
"No. I'm going to the hospital wing. You two should go on to lunch."
Harry clenched his jaw, scowling as he watched Malfoy put on his apron and gear. He had removed his outer robes, and he was wearing different gloves tonight, ones that were tight and stretched up to his shoulders. Harry stared as he rolled one over his bicep.
Dean nodded and paused buttoning his waistcoat to toss it to him. Harry frowned at him as he caught it. Dean had been staring at Seamus who was now pointedly ignoring him.
Another breath and Harry turned the corner. Malfoy was there, leaning against the wall but only a few paces from shadows that could easily hide him. Harry wondered why he was out in the open.
"Wronski Feint," Harry corrected, resigned to another Krum-rant.
She crossed her arms. "I'm very busy, Mr Malfoy. I don't have time to humour the antics of—"
What she had already printed about him was bad enough. He couldn't stomach…
But Malfoy's eyes softened some when Harry looked at him again. And Harry knew it wasn't malicious.
Harry grinned at her and pulled her into a tight hug. "Thank you, 'Mione. Thank you for
Malfoy appeared to be thinking something similar because he cleared his throat loudly and said tightly. "I suppose I shouldn't... It's not…"
Harry felt some colour heat his cheeks, and he shrugged sheepishly. Ron said something that sounded similar to
"Fawkes…" Suddenly, Malfoy was spending around, his eyes alight with apparent realisation. "The
He needed to know
Hermione wouldn't let him skip another day, however, so he endured two more days of the torture that was Hogwarts student gangs and the rumour mill. He was shoved in the hallways, openly laughed at, and stupid Malfoy's badges seemed to have gotten around the entire school. Everywhere he went, people were laughing at him, pointing at him, loudly predicting his death, and he could have dealt with it, clenched his teeth and let it go, but with everyone, he couldn't help but wonder if they, too, thought he was a lying fake who really did just want the attention.
"I'm in a hurry," Harry answered honestly. "Listen, I, I agreed to meet with someone at midnight, and I already had plans at one, and—" Malfoy's eyebrows shot up, and Harry realised what that might could have sounded like. "Wait! Wait, no, not—not like
Skeeter continued to Harry, "So, you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favourite lessons?"
Malfoy snorted. "This, I know." Then he deflated some, looking away to study a bush. "So, is that part of the criteria to be Precious Potter's friend now? Oddity and questionable mental stability."
change something between them. The whole thing and the prospects that could come from it were annoyingly attractive. Plus, with one o'clock deadline, it guaranteed he couldn't be out long.
"Very," Harry agreed weakly. "Did you see his hair?"
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO KILL ME
But, to his absolute delight, Luna proved to be a secret weapon.
"No kidding."
Silence passed between them a beat, Malfoy just staring at him. Slowly, he seemed to accept that as the apology it was and turned back to the basilisk. Harry let out a slow breath.

Harry clenched his jaw. He was joking earlier about giving Krum the shovel talk, but if he really did do something to Hermione…
Ron grinned back, looking dumbfounded, and turned back to their cauldron only to let out a groan. "Zero marks again…"
year of teaching—for bringing dangerous animals to lessons. Mind, Harry wouldn't think it a bad thing if the Ministry executed the skrewts, but he doubted Hagrid's career would last another trial so quickly.
"Yeah, Malfoy, you look… amazing."
"I'm so sor—" she stopped herself. "I'm sorry, I suppose I should have realised that… other people might… appreciate the knowledge."
"You showed," Harry stated.
Sometimes it would work. He couldn't actually call it… satisfying, if he was honest.
Hermione nodded.
"No, I think it's a brilliant summing for some things."
"What…?" he asked the toilet.

"I see…" Krum's stare darkened some.
"Well?"
"It can't just be some girl, Harry."

It emptied out on the ground floor near the entrance hall, which surprised Harry. Malfoy, however, looked like he expected nothing less.
Harry gulped.
Malfoy gave a slow nod. "Their most vulnerable point is the eyes."
appearing. "Who here can tell me the from what phrase this name was derived?"
He excused it after he got over the shock and appalling fact that it happened
Hermione was frowning at him. "What?"
"Yes, sir," Malfoy said quickly, scurrying past Snape. Once around him, he shot Harry one more unreadable look before disappearing around the corner.
Malfoy slowly poked his head in, suspicious, and his eyebrows flew up when he saw Harry. "... How?"
This apparently had Malfoy assuming he and his work were boring. Which, the work was a little not to mention gross, but Harry moreover felt himself relaxing to Malfoy's voice when it wasn't so sharp and ruthless. Regardless, the assumption led to a snoopy lecture about the, oh so important, research and delicate task that was harvesting a basilisk. That really
It never once even slightly occurred to him that the mother would be a
"I almost was," Harry shrugged. He shoved his hands in his pockets, thumbing one of the dragon books he brought with him. "Would be, if it wasn't for Fawkes."
"Oh, yes, she does, unless you have a backup, Mr Potter."
"Listen, I knew Bertha. She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot, frankly. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It's not a good combination, Harry. I'd say she'd be very easy to lure into a trap."
"What? Oh! No, not at all! Thank you so much." She took one of the drinks, taking a big gulp.
"But you can do it alone. There is a way, and a simple spell's all you need. Just—"
Harry chuckled, trying to pry his hand off. "Breathe, Ron."
Harry snorted. "I doubt you want to know the state I was in when we left. I have a feeling it would horrify you." He looked Malfoy up and down again. He honestly wouldn't have thought Malfoy would have had so many outfits appropriate for a place like this.
"You're lying! You're just making fun of me!"

In a lot of ways, he wanted to try to covertly find out from Sirius how his parents felt about people like him. But Sirius was already taking a tremendous risk sneaking closer to Hogwarts to be near Harry, and Harry knew he only wanted Harry to risk contacting him for the important things. Not only was Harry afraid that reaching out would make Sirius upset with him when it wasn't about something serious, but there was also that fear inside him that if Sirius knew about him, he would lose Sirius.
Malfoy still didn't move though. Harry gulped a few times, roughly and purposefully swallowing the lump that had tried to form there.
She nodded.
"Potter, that hole of yours looks
"I didn't think about it until later!" Malfoy yelled. "I would have asked, but you were rather passionate at the time!"
grapefruit?"
Harry bit his lip, wringing his hands and frowning down at them.
"Which do you prefer, Harry?" Luna asked.
The shock of being in the Tournament was wearing off, and terror over what was to come was slowly beginning to take over. He had been feeling it build and build, had been trying to dissuade it, ignore it, change it into something else. He had been trying to stand strong, trying to at least show the world that he was a man, even if he was a miniature one. Sure, he was nothing compared to Cedric, he didn't begrudge anyone for supporting him over Harry, but he had wanted, at least, to prove to himself that he was strong. Even if he didn't feel it.
They set their drinks down, giving their goodbyes to Bagman. Harry tried to see if he could find Hermione to let them know they didn't have their drinks anymore, but Hermione was looking properly cheered now and was smiling brightly with eyes only for Krum.
He blinked, closing his parted mouth, and snapped his eyes up—which was a mistake.
article? How was he supposed to face the Tournament if he ran like hell over an article?
"'Sometimes at night I still cry about them, I'm not ashamed to admit…'" Harry read dumbly. Then abruptly, "I NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THIS!"
Malfoy heard him coming and straightened, picking up a bag.
And if Harry wasn't furious with Ron before, he could have killed him then.
"I know it's hard, Harry," Hermione reassured him, patting his shoulder. "But you
"Well, erm… goodnight?" Harry tried.
Malfoy twirled around on his stool to face Harry, and Harry, who was grinning, froze. His gut clenched and his toes curled at the picture Malfoy made. He had pushed up his goggles, so his hair was a mess, flopping down around the straps and lens. The slightly glowing mixture he had made was properly glowing now, a light purple, and its residue was glowing as well, on both his apron and gloves. There were some darker stains there, Harry knew, but they were hidden by the glow.
It was odd having the whole school (and then some) present for the holiday feast, but Harry had fun nonetheless. He enjoyed himself watching the others who never attended before.

May this week be good! I'll be posting the next chapter in a few hours, life-permitting. I would right now but I need to proof it and, to be frank, food. Heads-up for some stan-Hagrid!
"Back to the theory then," Greg grumbled. Vinny joined in the sentiment.
"Madam Pomfrey healed it. Suppose there's no hope for my robes though."
Hermione sighed, too, adjusting her head to lay it on Harry's shoulder and look out across the deep valley there. "I know."
"Don't ever call
"It's nothing," Harry tried.
Harry checked his watch. This was going to be too tight. "Sorry, Malfoy, bad news."
Then there was the third, which was Malfoy would show up, humour Harry until Harry showed him the dead basilisk, and then Malfoy would believe him. He would believe Harry hadn't been an attention-seeking lying-liar all these years. He would believe that Harry did
"Oh please, how else does he manage to be so dramatic with his robes."
Harry waited for him to disappear then hurried down to Hagrid's hut.
Hermione blushed, looking uncharacteristically shy. "I… don't want to say. You'll see."
"Sounds like a plan." Harry grinned at her and held out his arm.
Harry worked his throat a little to get his voice back. "Y-yeah, I guess."
"What?"
Harry huffed but had no rebuttal because, as he peeked up to watch Malfoy lean over to tie up his special boots, Harry didn't doubt it.

Hermione, of course, was a fixture in the library, and as Ron wasn't speaking to Harry, making Hermione Harry's best friend and what felt like his
So, that was sorted. However, Harry's spirits fell when Malfoy openly mocked him in the entrance hall after the meal.
