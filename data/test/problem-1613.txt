He spoke quietly, though his gentle Scottish brogue easily carried through the crowd, “Welcome all, friends and family, living and dead. Let us celebrate the harvest, our health, and what good tidings have come. We hope for the winter to be gentle, the coming year to be bountiful, and to find peace and happiness in this world and the next.” He paused and then jerked his hand up, and up with it came a cheer as two fiddles began to play a bright tune.

‘Nice arse.’
Draco couldn’t bend down very far with the man pressed behind him, just parted his legs and raised his arse a little, he did as he was told but couldn’t help but looked back. The inside of the box was dark, he couldn’t see the man very well, just those bright and almost green eyes,and that smile was baring his sharp canine behind the silver mask.
‘About time! Someone should teach him a lesson.’
‘Ok I don’t want to know anything else about Potter, last time I knew about the tracking powder, it almost got me kissed by Dementors.’Draco interrupted, not wanting to hear how they didn’t trust him, ‘As long as he doesn’t die on the events I planned, or I don’t get blamed when he does, I’m fine.’
‘——Wait, how do you know he was a hatstall?’
Draco got drunk, sobered up, animalised and was determined to take 1000 strikes.
Before the mist dissipated, the man was kissing Draco, the clock then struck midnight, and the crowd was cheering, and Draco could feel the man’s arms holding him, his chocolate-sweet lips and tongue pulling Draco deep into the kiss, and everything else in the world —— everything else in the world disappeared.
For the first time, Draco got to spend a lot of free time with the man.
‘Greetings, my Lord.' Ginny quipped as she curtsied teasingly then sat down across the table, her smile radiating, 'Hermione. How's the little one doing?'
He himself also felt the stab of hurt and guilt again when Potter stood up for Longbottom. It was his education that there’s only predator and pray, and predators form their alliance by praying together. But he felt admiration when Potter stood up for the nearly worthless Longbottom, and was willing to take the risk of flying when it’s the first time he ever touched a broom, when he had just witnessed Longbottom’s epic failure.
‘Part your cheeks yourself.’ Potter ordered.
.’ Draco summarised, ‘Does that make sense to you?’
‘For what?’ Draco asked.
The two looked like they couldn’t care less about each other right now, Blaise at the peak of his curiosity, smiled as he tilted his head and observed everything about James, Pansy at the verge of her protective mode, narrowed her eyes as she said with her sugar voice: ‘James, is it?’
‘Well, get lost!’ Pansy shouted as she patted to the kitchen island with her dainty feet painted with black nail polish, ‘I’m not interested in
Potter paused, then he sat up carefully, so he wasn’t touching Draco: ‘About that, now that I can talk, I’ll try telling you everything from the start, and you can decide what happens with us next.’
‘I want to be your bitch.’
‘If it’s not too much to ask, Emerald,’ he said joyfully, ‘I would like him to ask for the punishment.’
Draco answered a few questions for the man to show he knew a lot about him so as to convince Pansy they had been dating for a while: both parents deceased, did’t have a good relationship with his foster family, left as soon as he reached legal age, only exchange a few letters with his foster brother who had redeemed. Favorite sport was Quidditch of course, and he enjoyed muggle movies very much.
He said as he summoned one of the balls and put it in Draco’s hand, and Draco saw it —— a white-haired Harry, his face marked by time but no less handsome, wearing an elegant charcoal grey suit, holding a ridiculously large bouquet of red rose in his arm, and he was smiling and leaning in to… to kiss Draco.
Draco woke up to a buzzing chaos as something in his hand was pulled away.
Harry didn’t mind that. He was feeling generous.
The kidnapper’s hand twitched at Draco’s words.
Draco leaned in, and before he kissed Potter, he said: ‘I love you too.’
‘Really? I think it’ll be fine.’
To his surprise, Potter picked him up, put him over his knee, and before they started, he gently combed Draco’s hair and pushed the stray strands behind his ear, then leaned down and whispered: ‘Today, I would like you to speak, cry, make any kind of sound or comment that you want. I’m going to use the wooden paddle on you today, two hundred strikes…’
Father nodded and turned to leave. But before he opened the door, he hesitated, his face half turned back; Draco could almost see his perfect Malfoy mask crumbling: ‘You… you take care. As long as you are happy, son.’
Bastard. But Draco almost couldn’t suppress his smile.
Each time he resumed the position, the cane would come down immediately. Soon he was shaking and crying, unable to stop, terrified of resuming the position, but he forced himself to do just that.
The man looked surprised, but grinned: ‘So you will be careful about your consent, and let me take care of you then.’
This happened before, when they were still rivals, so it should be okay. Isn’t it?
It was a nice piece, but it finally reminded Draco the shirt he ‘took’ from the man.
Draco invited him to sit down and talk for a while, and the man sat quite rigidly, carefully kept his distance and fidgeting the coffee cup while he listened and answered Draco’s questions.
The man was busy with his gauntlets and answered with a smile without looking up: ‘Yeah. It’s my favourite sport. Why, you want a seekers game before our scene?’
I want to say Draco was good at lying to himself, but once he stopped lying to himself about his father, he had to stop lying to himself about Harry too.
He always touches Draco’s heart in the weirdest way possible.
magazines with Potter’s face on the cover hanging around the room——including the one he was fully naked and shot with Buckbeak to raise money for the charity foundation protecting the habitat of hippogriffs, of course, one couldn’t really see his private parts on the shot, but it got a lot of witches and wizards crazy, they had to reprint it three times and eventually had enough money to protect a few other magical beings too, that one had some cake on it——empty butter beers everywhere, and at least a dozen Gryffindors (a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs too, the Slytherins among their friends were all at Draco’s party. Except for Blaise. He was head over heels for Ginevra and attended Potter’s to be with her. That traitor.) passed out everywhere.
‘Look at that
Draco picked up the delicate narcissus flower hair ring, smiled as it slowly dangled its petals, rolling the diamond dew: ‘I might just do that.’
Draco’s smile apparently fascinated him, he blushed hard, seemed sheepish and awkward, looking at Draco with his head tilted and through his eyelashes.
Knocking at the door broke Draco out of his thoughts.
‘It’s… it’s not your concern!’ Crabbe shouted.
Then there’s the delicious and rather expensive truffle chocolate from Belgium, an old wine, a beautiful high-end white fur coat, a silver engraved pocket watch with memo charms, a cologne, and so on.
The man was off him immediately, Draco heard him vanished the cuff, the chain and the belt with an audible spell to comfort him.
The man hesitated, and finally sighed, he leaned down and was about to kiss Draco’s forehead, but remembered Draco had safeworded it last time, so he settled with placing his cheek against Draco’s forehead and stroked Draco’s hair a few times before he left: ‘You need that sobering potion regardless.’
‘Any other time you talked about marrying?’ She asked.
Potter briefly stopped, only to walk to his side and firmly place his hand on Draco’s lower back to pin him on the table, and asked teasingly: ‘Whining already, Malfoy?’
‘And I’m sorry, sir.’
‘No.’ Draco repeated.
Draco raised a vial in front of Neville’s eyes: ‘Pain potion, harmless to the baby. Took me a while.’
‘Once a slut always a slut, Potter——Good luck with that.’ Malfoy said as he quickly collected his things, submitted the vial and left.
Draco’s heart leapt at his words, involuntarily thought about the possibility. Pansy saw him and casually pulling her fork away, concealing what she had just done, then smiled innocently at Draco: ‘Draco! We were just catching up about school.’
‘That…’ prick! But Draco wouldn’t say that in front of mother.
With that, the man broke into a big smile.
It was all Draco could do not to cry out in abandon.
The man was thoughtful, but laughed at Draco’s last sentence, at some secret Draco didn’t know, in a cat stole a fish kind of way: ‘That… that actually made a lot of sense.’
Rosier, on the other hand, was full-blown crazy by this point; he threw another curse, his eyes bloodshot and frantic: ‘You two are way too comfortable as hostages —— he cut the magic flow to both his hands, he’s forcing his magic out. If his magic was a river normally, right now? It’s just tap water. The more he uses his magic, the more he bleeds. How long do you think he has till he bleeds out, Malfoy?’
However, the man didn’t seem affected by the holiday spirit, Draco brushed elbows with him, and asked as quiet as the man can hear him: ‘You have something against New Year?’
‘Think about it.’ Rosier chanted joyfully, ‘How perfect it was going to be. The beautiful face, perfect body, and the soul of our rational, ruthless Lord.’
Potter yanked him up by the heavy metal chain and pulled him to the punishment bench in the middle of the stage. They used this kind of bench before, so Draco knew how Potter wanted him. As Potter locked the chain on the bench, Draco kneeled on it and supported himself by holding the rail on each side, then pushed his arse out to the exact point Potter taught him. It’s a difficult position for the punishment he’s about to endure, as there’s nothing in front of him to catch him, so he had to hold himself if he didn’t want to fell off the bench and embarrass himself.
Draco avoided Potter for the rest of the night.
For some reason, the man didn’t mute Potter, and at some point, it was just too much for Draco, he moaned and pushed back as the man bit on his shoulder and slammed into him hard. A tear was hanging dangerously on his eyelashes, but Draco couldn’t tell what it was for.
‘Well,’ Potter shrugged, ‘It is.’
Draco abused his bottom lip but complied, let go of the snitch, reached his hands back shakily and grabbed one cheek in each hand, parted them until his arsehole was on full display. His pale fingers presented a stark contrast with his red arse, sinking into the swollen flesh slightly, made one wonder its softness, and his pink arsehole tender and vulnerable, flustering a little in the middle of the the still white cleft.
‘You don’t really know me that well.’
It was weird, having a tail. Trying to use it was like a newborn ferret figuring out what its tail was. Draco’s clumsy attempts at using his tail amused Potter greatly, Potter chuckled and disrupted Draco’s attempts a few times by stroking his tail, Draco moaned and his tail involuntarily wrapped around Potter’s wrist.
‘You would do that?’ Draco asked, blushing for no reason at all, it’s just his heart was beating so fast, ‘You will have to…’

Together they ran to the third floor, the man pulled Draco into one of the boxes where they can have a direct line of sight to the stage, waved his wand, activated the spells installed, switched the glass window into a one-way mirror and muted the box both ways.
‘No nono. Too much information.’ Draco complained as his heart softened at Pansy’s bright smile.
The man took Draco’s wrist between his fingers, gently pried away Draco’s hand, and clad his other hand over the mark: ‘For what it’s worth Malfoy, it is always difficult for everyone to do the right thing. No one is perfect, we all have our moment of fear and weakness, we all just deal with it, make our mistakes and hope we fail better next time. And I doubt even your Saint Potter was able to make the right choice every time.’
He gave one last hard suck, and Draco was coming in his mouth, moaning so loud that he could hear his own voice echoing in the Quidditch field.
‘It’s not your concern.’ The man caught his wrist, fingers a bit tighter than necessary, his eyes cold again. Draco flinched, and the man’s expression turned a little wicked, ‘A Dom is nothing if not in control, that doesn’t just mean I would have perfect control over you, but myself too. I don’t believe today is the right time to introduce this into our game. Besides, you don’t deserve it yet. I doubt that you know how to please me, and I’ll teach you that lesson when I see fit.’
