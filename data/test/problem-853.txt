Draco takes one look at the place and turns to Harry with a raised eyebrow. "Quite a different setup than usual tonight," he says.
Elise Abbott turned her shrewd eyes on Ron and held out her hand. "Mr Weasley, don't tell me you're here unaccompanied."
The muscle at Harry's jaw worked hard as he regarded Draco. Harry was still leaning against the wall but the tension at his shoulders was gone, even though Elise Abbott was still doing her best to push her daughter past Draco. Harry spared one glance for poor Alice Abbott who tripped over her feet as her mother gave her a particularly forceful shove forward.
"The only place where I can be sure no one is going to see us," Draco called, his voice echoing in the distance.
Harry stops again and lets his head fall into his hands. He can feel that same warmth spreading through his chest, something pleasant and right. He runs his hands through his hair, thinks of Sunday mornings and Draco in bed. He imagines all the nights they've had together, the way they hold hands like it's second nature now.
"McLaggen's gone and offended the gate," he said, waving his bouquet rather forcefully towards the group in front. "Now, it won't let us in and no one knows how to make it open."
Harry stretches his hand out and Draco hands him the iPod Shuffle. It's lighter than Harry expected. He examines it all over for an "off" button and can't find one.
Parkinson Manor sat at the centre of acres of forested land with winding pathways that led to various gardens and lakes. From the entrance of the manor, a pebbled driveway led to the main street, the way lit by floating bulbs of white light. About halfway down, there was another path hidden behind a mossy curtain in between the large green hedges. Harry hadn't noticed it on his way to the manor earlier, but as he followed behind Draco at a proper distance, he saw the mossy curtain part, allowing Draco to step through.
"I have to go and make sure Mum and Ginny don't kill each other," Ron had told Harry earlier that evening.
When he reached the Manor's entrance, there was a small mob surrounding the gate. From the front came Cormac McLaggen's deep voice, his words unclear but the tone hostile. Harry turned to the person closest to him, a young Wizard in his late teens or very early twenties, and asked what was happening.
Draco says nothing but he stops moving and Harry remembers their Eighth Year, how many times he'd run into Draco standing at the end of hallways or in abandoned classrooms. How he had a tendency to stare at nothing when he was thinking. How very familiar every one of Draco's quirks is to Harry after all these years. How easy it had been to finally ask Draco out almost four months ago when they'd both been ready.
"Just because everything I say with regards to mannerisms and familial expectations goes right through you, doesn't mean that I didn't try," Draco says, but he's smiling as he takes Harry's hand. "Is that what this is then? An apology for the fiasco that was lunch with my mother?"
After the initial disappointment, the Wizarding World had decided that Potter was off on another secret mission, for surely someone as great and as powerful as the Boy Who Lived must have a purpose. Never mind that Potter had abandoned Wizarding Britain in its most vulnerable state, right at the time when they needed guidance and someone to look up to. Never mind that Potter disappearing meant that there was no one willing to speak up for the Malfoys during their sentencing, and no one to say no when they'd been stripped of most of their wealth.
Draco's fingers were light on Harry's skin as they went, the leather of his glove just brushing against Harry's arm. Everywhere else, Harry could feel the scratch of fabric from Draco's outer jacket, the touch feather-light, as though Draco wanted the least amount of contact between them. They said nothing as they went, Harry content to know that Draco's eyes were on him and not on anyone else.
Harry does his best to fight back his laugh. "Oh? And I suppose you've never been attracted to any dark-haired men in your life."
Draco never felt the need to lead him somewhere quieter, to study him under the moonlight. Gregory just took his one dance before leading Draco to the side of the room where everyone could see them. They talked about their parents and the party, about how good the food was, how much trouble it was that the drinks were on the opposite side. The pleasant conversation was easy to follow, so much so that Draco found his eyes wandering. He answered when it was needed and let his eyes roam over all the people in the room, to the Weasleys with their fiancés, and finally, because he couldn't help himself, to Harry.
Harry's lips twitched. "Wouldn't dream of it," he said, his gaze leaving Draco for a moment. "Besides, we're hardly unchaperoned."
He stepped forward towards the gate and as Harry watched, the veil came back down, effectively blocking Cormac's entrance. Neither of them said anything a moment as Cormac stepped back. The veil lifted and when he made his way forward, it dropped down again. Harry's mouth twitched as he stepped under the veil and crossed the gate. Cormac glared at him, his hand tightening on his bouquet of flowers until one of the stems snapped.
He knew if he moved, Mrs Weasley would pounce. Worse still, he could feel Mrs Parkinson's eyes on the side of his face, could practically hear the whirring of gears as she thought of a natural way to reintroduce Pansy to him. That wasn't counting the various eyes he'd felt since he walked into the ballroom, the whispers that followed. The only reason no one had approached him yet was because he'd been away for so long, no one knew what to do with him. But sooner or later, a mother would get brave and he'd be surrounded.
It took two strokes, and then Draco was coming hard enough to see spots. He didn't even feel like he was in his body, but holy hell he could feel everything
is." At Draco's continued confused and annoyed expression, he elaborated. "Like from space? Creatures from other planets?"
Once the food was on the table, Draco picked up his bread and tore a piece off, unsure how to eat the food. Was he supposed to put it on the bread? Was he supposed to eat it with a fork and have the bread separately? Was he supposed to try and dip it?
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well I agreed with whatever you were saying! It's hard to hear when you're practically eating the duvet."
He took a deep, steadying breath, and looked over to Harry, who didn't appear to be in much better shape. He looked to be counting quietly under his breath, breathing slowly and intentionally, still staring out the window into downpour.
He came hard onto the floor, still babbling disjointedly. Harry kissed up his back and massaged his sides, waiting for him to be coherent.
"Well, I'm can't say I'm surprised," Harry tried to interrupt her, and she held up a hand. "I didn't expect it, but I'm not surprised." She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. "But
Ginevra seemed likeable too, though, and that was the other problem. Draco really didn't want to hate her, and he couldn't help hoping that what Harry had said before they'd left (about the two of them getting along once she warmed up to him) would be true. But as he watched Harry put a comfortable arm over her shoulders and lean his head against hers — even as he held Draco's hand on the other side — he resented her just a little bit.
"Oh Harry, come on, don't go all mopey because I mentioned Ginny. It's true, you've been taking it too hard."
"Why not? I might. I might end up with anyone, I might end up with no one. Why can't I be with a man if that's who I end up falling for?"
"Is this completely necessary for them to believe we're in a relationship?" Draco couldn't keep himself from asking lowly, as Harry backed him against the sink. He swore he could feel his heart pounding in his ears, and the traitorous Snitch beating its wings on his throat certainly wasn't helping matters.
Draco had proposed to Harry on Boxing Day, and the rings were connected magically in such a way that when Draco slid the ring onto Harry's finger, an identical ring had appeared on his own finger. They could not be removed unless the engagement was broken off, or when their wedding vows were spoken. Then they would be able to move their engagement rings onto the same finger as their new wedding bands.
"Tiring. They were alright though. The students mostly seemed to know what they should up to now, but they never want to focus. The Sixth Year Gryffindor/Slytherin class has been the worst so far — they just would not shut up. I had to start taking points, but I think they like me anyway though, it's weird."
"Yeah, er, I'm fine," Harry spit out quickly, hoping Malfoy would just go away. Dealing with people right now was not what Harry wanted at all.
Harry just shrugged, and glanced warily at Bartholemew's open cage hanging in the window, where he sat preening himself. "Where's your parchment?"
," Harry warned him before turning back to the students. "Madam Pomfrey looks after Luna in her office when we're in classes, otherwise she's with us in our room."
He'd been out in the field all day, chasing after the heads of a wizard trafficking ring. The whole case was horrid and had given Harry quite a few nightmares, but those sneaky bastards were always slipping out of their grasp at the last moment. Harry supposed it would be awhile again before they caught onto their new trail.
The photo-version of him was swaying with photo-Draco, and brought their intertwined hands up to kiss his ring. Wow — nauseatingly coupley.
Hermione had talked a lot with Draco about her work in the Ministry pushing for more creature's rights and protections, and then Harry had asked if they had any news about how wedding planning was going, which led both Ron and Hermione into long rants about how much work it was — not that they weren't excited!
Harry, but that's why we've got to work toward— you know what, nevermind. I don't wanna argue right now. What's up?"
"Sunflower — tends to symbolise loyalty, adoration, and longevity," Jamie read aloud for the students that couldn't see. "Okay, has anyone found honeysuckle yet?"
Draco was glad to know they didn't seem to suspect anything off about his and Harry's relationship. It was a bit embarrassing that they'd heard him threaten to punch Harry in the throat, though. And if they'd heard that, then they'd also heard him accidentally tell Harry he loved him.
Why was he even friends with those two? Right. Because they forgave him for doing stupid shite like getting himself into a fake relationship and lying to them about it.
Draco seemed unfazed by all of this — arching up against Harry's hands, clenching his fist tightly in his hair again as he kissed him, apparently lost in the feel of his mouth, his hands.
from. Or maybe you just turned into a massive nymphomaniac, I don't know, but my point is that whilst we're not on the best terms, it
"You wouldn't mess it up. And it's clearly fine now, so I don't know what you're whingeing about. What I want to know is what's got you humming back here like a drunk lark."
"Okay," Harry answered, stuffing more mashed potatoes in his mouth. He had the feeling that the pompous git was going to try to one-up his comment yesterday about them liking him.
interesting. Not as interesting as what happened at dinner, though. It's funny how they think they're being all inconspicuous."
When he arrived at the Great Hall, he discovered he was a few minutes late. Oh well. It was worth it to not have to go back to his office after dinner. He headed for the only empty seat left between Draco and Pomona. It was time to test that truce, he guessed.
Her accent took Harry briefly by surprise — though he couldn't quite put a finger on where it was from, perhaps somewhere in the Middle East or northern Africa — but he continued on.
He topped off and corked the last of the vials, placing them in a box to bring to the front. It was nearly closing time and he doubted someone would come in so late. It would be terribly inconsiderate to do so, in Harry's opinion.
"They wanted to meet you again, you know, fresh start?" he finally responded, avoiding the (pretty valid) points Draco had brought up.
The smug look on Draco's face, was quickly wiped off when Harry was over him, mouth against his ear, whispering dirty things and pushing down his boxers. Harry pulled back to completely strip Draco of them, and grabbed his hips, directing him onto his hands and knees.
"Ugh," the pillar was pushed open, and the students came face to face with an angry, shirtless Draco Malfoy. He promptly turned back around and slammed the pillar shut.
At the end of the lesson, one of the students hesitantly tried to approach him, only to discover that he'd actually fallen asleep at some point.
Harry laughed. "Unconventional, yet tempting. But I'll go quietly, no bribery necessary." He slid himself up slightly to kiss Draco softly on the mouth. "Goodnight."
He sighed, grabbed his coat and keys, and left, heading down the street for some curry. Well, 'down the street' in a sense, meaning that he Apparated from his front step into an alley in London, and it was down the street from there.
"Shite," Harry swore, but didn't explain further, merely shaking his head at Ron. He braced himself for what he knew was about to come as he heard the water turn off, followed by a very deep, dramatic sigh.
sure it was spinach) mixture on the bread and ate it once he saw Harry doing the same. He didn't know what the hell was in it, but it was quite nice.
Draco's eyes lit up. "Merlin, is that even a question? It's been years, and I honestly doubt I've been seeing the best selection at that old place on Baule Row."
"I rather think they've gotten the point," Draco said, with much less conviction than he'd intended.
Ugh. Now he had his thoughts to himself and a busy work day ahead of him, and he'd probably be distracted thinking about Draco fucking Malfoy...and probably also fucking Draco Malfoy. But he didn't have to admit that — even to himself.
they could twist to fit their narrative, and Harry denying them that one bit of information wouldn't change that.
"Ugh, I'm so tired, but I want to keep kissing you. This isn't fair," Draco complained, tucking his head against Harry's chest.
Harry cleared his throat, as he came up to the front of the shop, ready to leave for the day after cleaning up.
Draco's hand traced over Harry's body as he continued his ministrations on Harry's jaw. Harry's eyes shut and he let out a ragged breath as Draco's hand squeezed experimentally over his boxers.
It seemed like he would only be intentionally blinding himself to the way the world really was and the fact that he would never be able to be left content. To that side of Harry, it seemed just silly of him to wish for that when he knew he could never have it. He'd just hate himself more because he'd be faking it the whole time. Or maybe he would eventually get close, but then something was bound to come along and send him spiraling right back down like it always did. There was no point in stringing his friends along only to disappoint them more later — this way they could just go ahead and get used to him this way and move on like that.
having to go through everything alone the past few years, but now that Harry was in his life, he found it hard to imagine how he could ever go back. Harry wasn't just someone there to lean on when he needed it, but he was someone who actually
Harry grabbed Draco's hand as they entered the narrow alleyway, and Draco raised an eyebrow. Harry shrugged. "Figured we should side-along."
Harry's voice softened. Neville was so kind, and he was willing to share his secret hideouts. The ones he'd only found out of necessity during the horrible things he'd been through during Seventh Year. Harry thought to himself how selfish he was. As many ghosts (both literal and figurative) and horrid memories as this castle held for him, those who had been here through the last year — and
. You were a kid too, and I'm not confident others wouldn't have done the same things if put in your place."
"Actually, I think I forgot something in the back room," Draco's voice came out noticeably strained and higher than usual. "Harry?"
Draco butted in, ignoring her presence. "I'd like to check out upstairs." He grabbed Harry's hand and dragged him upstairs.
They swayed together, and even Celestina's corny lyrics couldn't dampen how full Draco's heart felt.
"Suit yourself," George said, and then turned back to the kids. "Do you want to go watch everybody play some Quidditch?"
Bartholomew nuzzled into Rodya's hand, and Zylphia leaned over to stroke a finger against the side of his pleased, fluffy little face.
"Erm. Yeah." He saw Harry get up out of the corner of his eye, and turned toward him, silently pleading
Draco had been doing some Thinking™ over the summer holidays. He liked to believe he was usually a very sharp person, but he was starting the think Harry's obliviousness was catching. The fact that he was catching anything from Harry at all was the disturbing part.
There weren't many options for places to eat, as there were only nine businesses in total (many of which appeared to be deserted), but there was a small pub, which Harry was delighted to find served excellent hot chips and sandwiches.
Harry groaned and picked up his quill, trying to focus his attention back on the essay he'd been in the middle of marking.
"I almost killed him with that hex in Sixth Year. Hermione erased her parents' memories. Percy renounced the family. But you still love all of us, even though we've done some messed up things. He was a kid too, and can you imagine being raised by Lucius Malfoy? Living in the same house as Voldemort? I'm not saying anything he did was okay, I'm not saying there's an excuse, but I
Harry's speech cut off as he was grabbed tightly around the middle. Draco turned around to see what had happened.
"But there are two of us. How are we supposed to share it?" Draco spoke slowly, as if trying to see if he was missing something.
"Yeah, well that's not quite like you. You could've at least told us," he said, sounding hurt. "And did you stay up all night again?" he added, taking in Harry's fully clothed state and glasses.
"Yes, well, some of us get a bit bored with takeaways. It's pasta with vodka cream sauce — surely much more exciting than whatever you were going to have."
Draco shrugged awkwardly, and looked down at the sofa cushions. Okay so maybe he should have exercised a bit of restraint, but Harry had found it funny at least.
"I feel terrible because he went through a lot, but he's being a royal prat to you. You don't deserve it, you've always stuck right by him, but he was really laying in."
Draco sighed. "Ridiculous," he muttered, and then raised his voice to normal volume, turning away from the records he'd been aimlessly stacking and restacking. "You know I can hear you, right?"
Things heated up a bit faster than either of them intended, especially as it was currently only dinnertime. And speaking of—
been had been good-natured, so Harry figured he had at the very least found a way to deal with this lot.
hasn't stopped. So since ignoring it hasn't worked, you want to show them all that you're not their idyllic little golden boy. You're not a life-saving, bad-guy-chasing Auror. You're not getting married to your school sweetheart and rearing another little horde of Weasleys. And now, just to really make the point, you want to date a washed-up Death Eater who's practically been thrown out of wizarding society — and a man at that, because you just know they'll have plenty to say, even if it's not outright condemnation."
"So," he broke the silence, quickly eating the last of his cone, "I have some potions work to do, and I'm sure you'll be visiting St. Mungo's..." He trailed off.
Draco glared at him, and then paused when he turned back to grab his wand. He brought his hand closer to his face...huh. It was clean already, and he could feel his boxers were too.
"Well I'm just heading off to work," he turned back to Harry. "I left a plate for you on the table."
All of the students heard, and remained silent for the remainder of class as their teacher slumped in his chair, his head hung.
Out in the hall, Serena heard Draco laugh loudly, and she smiled before quickly heading for the main castle doors for the last time. It had been a good run.
After two tense minutes the shaking stopped, and Harry opened his eyes, glaring at him. "You know, you're complete shite in crisis."
He was pleasantly surprised to actually be able to see into the living room. Of course, he could only see the empty sofa, but still. "Ron? Hermione? Are you up yet?" he called.
"Did I say you could make noise?" He slid his fingers back inside and Draco stayed silent, biting his lip.
Draco knew he was being sharper than usual with Harry, but uncontrolled magic was really the last thing he needed right now. He did
Harry kissed him. "No, I really should have thought before I spoke. But thank you." He kissed him again. "I'll mind my words in front of Muggles, promise."
He sighed. Of course he was being called in. Well they were out of luck — even as awkward as he felt here, he couldn't just leave. Also, he didn't particularly feel like going into work on Christmas.
. Everything. So you aren't going to win the misery Olympics with me." It came out in a flat, tired monotone, but it was clear Harry still felt the emotional impact of his words.
Filius led in the new First Years, and they were sorted fairly quickly. Minerva went through the usual start of term announcements, and informed everyone that Professor Longbottom would be joining them again as Herbology Professor and would arrive the next day.
They were currently kissing lazily on their sofa, happy to have time to take things slow and relax. The book, which had lain open on Draco's lap, slipped off and tumbled to the floor, but he seemed to pay it no mind.
. He ended up making an unnecessarily fancy omelette with cheese, tomato, capsicum, spinach, mushrooms, and basil; and he came to the conclusion (as he was adding the
Now that he was an adult, Christmas was more of a chore. A monotonous list of people he had to find things for. Honestly, he found the whole thing rather boring, although he still appreciated his gifts and the thought behind them.
"I'm sure it would, but that'll have to be a no from me," Harry said as he finally hauled himself off the floor and walked to his room with his blanket around him like a cape.
At dinner that night, the Great Hall was decorated sickeningly. Pink and red covered nearly every surface, and random showers of pink confetti hearts would spontaneously rain down on couples. As soon as Draco sat down, he voiced his disdain.
"Growing up, finding yourself, anything. Take your pick. Make up a new one. I'm just proud. It's nice to see my baby brother happy."
Draco let out a breath when he and Harry finally turned away from the counter. "I think that's enough excitement for me today," he muttered.
The last day before winter holidays had arrived, and Draco didn't have a final class. As a result, once he'd finished adding the boomslang skin to his newest experimental healing draught and set it to simmer, he had nothing to do.
Harry murmured something unintelligible and turned over, and Draco checked the time. Half seven. He should probably get up, because he hadn't a clue when the Weasleys usually started their festivities, but he could surely let Harry sleep a little longer. He looked so peaceful, and really, he deserved it after the nightmare he'd had.
Professor Potter sat back down at his desk. Luckily for Jamie the flowers were still there, although they had been moved off to the side.
"HARRY!" Several loud voices greeted him, and suddenly he was hugging Bill and Fleur’s children, who had jumped on him, and then George and Percy.
Draco blinked in surprise at being addressed directly. "Oh, erm. It's not too bad. He's sweet when he's sleepy."
Harry moped around Andromeda's house. He missed Draco, but he refused to admit it — really, they barely passed as friends.
He read through the entire letter, something about esteemed guests and influential figures welcoming in the new year hand in hand with the Ministry, blah blah. Something about it was niggling at something in his mind, though, and he read through it again.
When Neville announced he'd better head off, somewhat late on a Friday, Harry and Draco had continued talking for a few more hours quietly in the dim light of the fire. They had been sitting quite close with Neville there — even with Draco's arm around Harry's shoulders — but now he was practically curled in Draco's lap.
He stepped inside, grabbed one of his kebabs, and opened up the window whilst holding out the kebab like a peace offering. Bartholomew ruffled his feathers (presumably in indignance at being left outside), but seemed to accept the offering.
was sure to be an awkward lunch — but still, he just couldn't tell Draco until he'd finished talking to Ron and Hermione about it all.
. Harry, we just work so well together and they're so perfect, and I just." She let out a slow breath.
. He had failed to account for just how very charming Harry could be, and dammit, he couldn't pretend he wasn't affected.
It was fairly late in the day, as Harry had never been a naturally early riser, so he decided to go ahead and visit St. Mungo's after his coffee. He figured he could pick up a bite to eat afterward, and then go check out the job prospect.
Harry's classes were going more smoothly, and most of his students really liked him. They were only about two weeks into the term, but he felt like he was really getting to know them already. There were a lot of students, but he had the general feel of each class and how to handle them. He and Draco would still brag to each other every time a student gave them a compliment or a class went particularly well.
"I'm impressed — buying actual ingredients at an actual shop." He saw Harry shake his head, and quickly continued, "Seriously though, this is really good."
He knew he was horribly self-centred, and a coward to boot, but he just couldn't lose Draco quite yet. The more he thought about it, the more the sinking feeling in his gut grew, and he just
Harry had been right about Neville and Draco getting along. Unfortunately, he'd also been right about them spending hours talking and hypothesising about the uses of plants. Harry didn't mind so much though — it was fun to watch Draco when they got into conversations like that.
"I love you," Harry repeated, forcing his tongue to obey. It came out in a near-whisper, a final protest from his mouth at being stopped there, but it would have to do. That was all he was
," she whispered in his ear, and promptly scurried out of the kitchen before Molly could say anything.
"You know you can use my given name, right? There's nothing wrong with it," he said with a small smile.
That's a bit different, isn't it? Like what if they can tell it's not real, or what are we supposed to do when this is all over? What if it gets out that this is all fake?"
Ron looked like he was biting his lip hard enough to hurt with the effort to not laugh, and Harry could swear there were tears in his eyes.
"I mean, you don't have to. We can stay here if you really want, I'm not going to leave you alone on Christmas. I just don't want you to say no just because you're afraid they won't like you. That's why I talked to Molly first, and nobody's going to give you a hard time, I promise. Teddy and Andromeda were already planning to go away on holiday for Christmas this year, so you won't even have to worry about them. I really think if you give them a chance they'll love you, and...I just want you to be able to be with family on Christmas." Harry shyly looked up from staring at the fork he had aimlessly been twirling during his speech. "So? Will you consider it?"
Draco shook his head in a vain attempt to clear it. "Why would I be...? Just— Are you really serious? And
He closed his eyes again, and took several deep, slow breaths, which made the murmuration of starlings undulate in a truly fascinating way — not that that was where Harry's attention was focused, of course. "Okay. Okay. Uhm...okay." He opened his eyes again and stared at the ring. "Right. Okay. So, I'll wear it. You're right:
Draco held up a hand to cut him off. "Yes. And don't bring it up again. I swear I'll spend the rest of my days trying to forget I have that god-awful tattoo."
Merlin, he was incredibly self-centred, wasn't he? No, he'd just had a lot to deal with...but then, that was really no excuse. And he hadn't
He slid carefully out of bed, shoved his glasses onto his face, and gave an almighty stretch, which produced several rather alarming popping sounds from his joints.
"Hey Angelina! I can take over helping if you like. They're starting a Quidditch game out back and Ron told me to send you."
When they first arrived at the Burrow on Christmas Eve, things were a little awkward. Most of them didn't know how to act around Draco. Honestly, when he'd first written Molly, she had been hesitant, but he had patiently explained the situation. Eventually, she had said that she would be more than happy to have Draco if it would make Harry happy, and that she would talk to the others for him.
However, when the new school year started, and neither Harry nor Draco had shown up to any mealtimes (save the welcome feast) for the entire first week back, the students really started to ask questions.
Harry attempted a grin and shook his head, hoping that Draco would drop it. Fuck. Draco pulled him closer by the hips and starting grinding on him, and
When Draco came back to his classroom half an hour later, it was in uproar. His shoulders sagged in defeat, not feeling up to looking formidable and scolding them. He walked through the students, who quieted as he passed, to the front of the room where he slumped into the chair behind his desk.
And when Harry woke up the next morning to the bed being jostled by Draco pulling on his boots, it only resulted in Draco turning and giving him a nod before letting himself out.
Draco felt his mobile vibrate in his pocket, and pulled it out to look, grateful for the distraction from the discomfort of sitting at the Weasley's breakfast table. Harry was beside him, chattering away with Ron and Hermione, but Draco still felt horribly out of place.
— you can't go around bickering all the time anymore! I know you don't particularly like him, and neither do I. He was a right git throughout most of our time at Hogwarts, and he made some really poor decisions, but he also didn't turn you in to the snatchers. And
say earlier that the only way we'd be able to shag for the next week and a half would be if it was on your desk in between marking assignments."
"Great. I'm gonna write an anonymous letter to the Prophet that I have 'inside info' that the famous Harry Potter is moving house." He rolled out of bed and stretched.
Draco nodded and toyed with his croissant, ripping it slowly apart. "I do, but I miss it. I don't really have any friends to go back to, but it's just...
"Shite." Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "I didn't expect this to happen, if it helps?"
"No." Harry lapsed back into silence and Hermione made a 'well carry on with it then' gesture with her hand.
help him. He didn't know if anything could help him. Harry had been very prone toward feeling lately that maybe he was just past help.
"Mm, but is it really kindness if I'm benefitting from it?" Harry asked as he snaked a hand down to grab Draco's arse and grind his thigh against Draco's cock.
"Yeah." Draco set his wand carefully back on the bedside table, and sat back down on the edge of the bed. "Are you?"
He turned and picked up his trunk, cradling it to his body as he walked toward his classroom. The poor thing probably had about ten broken items in it now.
He quickly stepped forward and tilted his head down slightly to kiss Harry before he could overthink it. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's shoulders, slipping one hand into the back of his hair. He was certainly prepared for this show then, Draco thought.
When Christmas Day arrived, he awoke to a giant package from Mrs. Weasley at the foot of his bed. She had, true to form, included a hand-knitted jumper and an array of sweets, including several mince pies. Harry decided it was worth it to make himself sick by eating four for breakfast.
"You know, you can say something if you want to," Ginny spoke, making Harry swallow guiltily. She was just too observant. He still didn't want to burden her with the things going on in his head; she had enough to deal with on her own.
"That really is lovely to hear, Madam Zelinsky," he was saying. "Be sure to tell me when you hear back about the proposal; I do hope it goes through."
yourself to enjoy company anymore. I gave you space because you wanted it, and frankly I needed it to work on healing some of my own wounds. And I'm going to continue doing that, but I'm not going to completely remove myself from your life—"
She handed him a quill from her robe pocket, informing him that it was self-inking, and proffering the book excitedly. He signed it quickly and tried to bid her a courteous goodbye so he could leave before anyone else could get any ideas, but she interrupted him.
He awoke to Draco clucking his tongue in annoyance. Harry had apparently curled up against Draco in his sleep and had an arm flung over his waist. Draco didn't seem to mind, as he'd stayed where he was, save for sitting up. He had a hand on the back of Harry's head stroking his hair as he read the Prophet with a frown.
"Students," he warned Draco and Harry, who both looked up as if they had forgotten that the rest of the world existed.
Harry flushed crimson and resolutely did not look at Ron. "Don't you, erm, don't you have to go to work?" he got out.
Harry was settled in on the Weasleys' overstuffed sofa, with Ron's arm around him, and his arm hanging over Ron's shoulder to hold hands with Hermione, who was leant against Ron's other side. Draco quickly made his way over to him, and dragged a padded stool over from under a window to behind the couch, hoping he'd feel a little less awkward if he could physically keep himself on the periphery of the room.
Harry did, in fact, have something to do with it. After a few minutes of watching the two play chess, he had gotten bored and wandered over to talk to George.
"It's Peeves, sir, he's wrecked the Potions classroom. We were on patrol when we heard all this crashing, and when we went to go investigate, well...it's a complete mess."
Draco was actually quite funny, and his confusion about all things Muggle without the disdain of past years was especially entertaining. At some point he seemed to have discovered the concept that 'different doesn't mean bad,' and it showed when he talked about Muggles. He may think some of their ideas were ridiculous, but others he admired, and he seemed able to be confused about certain things without taking it as a sign that Muggles were inferior.
There were still a few whispers, but Draco was mostly satisfied that he had terrified them enough to keep quiet.
He'd sent a package of sweets for Hagrid by owl, along with some dog treats for the puppy he'd gotten after Fang died. All in all, Harry was exhausted by Christmas, and he really hoped he hadn't forgotten anyone important. He'd already sent presents to the Weasleys, Teddy, and Andromeda, but the Holidays always gave him the feeling that he was forgetting something.
"Great, well can you tell all the crap that's happening in my head it's unnecessary too? Maybe it'll listen to you and stop, but I don't really think telling me my words are unnecessary is too constructive right now."
Harry stumbled slightly on an uneven stone in the floor, and caught himself in surprise. He had forgotten that he was, well,
They finished the first bottle of wine fairly quickly, then two bottles turned into three, and before he knew it, Draco was pronouncing Harry absolutely unfit for Floo travel.
He pushed those thoughts aside (before he ended up stewing over the same things again and again, as he was prone to doing) and flicked a hand at the coffee maker.
"Welcome, I'm Professor Ludgor, as Headmistress McGonagall has informed you," A voice boomed from the front of the room, with a slight lisp. The man it came from looked quite average and unassuming. Not at all the type who would produce a voice as forceful as that. He had wavy black hair and a face that looked as if you could mould it like clay, although it was currently quite flat.
Harry chuckled and turned back to his students (all of whom seemed very intrigued by their quiet conversation).
him since this time the year before. He felt like he was an awful godfather; he needed to spend more time with Teddy. He had stewed about that all month.
"Predictable." She said, finally swallowing properly, and brushing crumbs off of her front. Presumably she was talking about the Quidditch, but perhaps also about Harry's complaining. "Anyway, I've missed you!"
It had honestly gotten beyond ridiculous. Just the night before, after several other failed escapades, they had gone out on a date. A bona fide date — to a fancy restaurant with a private room and everything. They'd held hands across the table and Apparated back to Harry's place together, yet the next day the headlines speculated whether the two were new
"Yeah, the two worlds are very different; it can take a lot of adjusting. Would you like something? I was going to go order, I haven't eaten since lunch."
Unfortunately, now that the dishes were taking care of themselves there was no more stalling to be done, and he'd have to go out there with everybody else again.
Mercifully, the day passed quickly and free of gossip from the students. Draco wiped his quill, and set it down, gathering the marked assignments into a neat pile. Sure, Valentine's Day was a silly holiday, and ultimately meaningless, but all the same he was rather glad he'd finished his work for the day before dinner.
Malfoy sat behind him, head on hand, eyes drooping, absentmindedly moving his quill against the desk. Harry quickly turned back around. Really, the noise was infuriating, but he didn't want to antagonise Malfoy — it would have been hard enough for the boy to come back to school at all.
Harry smiled widely, and, whilst Draco knew he was prone to being dramatic, he didn't think he was exaggerating
"Could just be your general aura," Ron said, trying to sound mysterious. He let it sit for a moment, before showing his hand and continuing. "Or I tried to firecall you last night to see if you wanted to go for drinks for Seamus' birthday, but you and blonde tattoo guy were a bit busy making sure I never touch that couch of yours again."
, that is not normal Malfoy-Potter behaviour. Do you know how long we hated each other for? The only way we can communicate is through antagonising each other." He looked at Draco for affirmation.
Draco finally regained enough use of his body to run his hands over Harry in return, kissing him back sleepily. After a few minutes, Harry pulled back, frowning.
Draco gave him a questioning look, but complied without comment. Harry continued prepping him and added a couple lovebites to his back, which it became quite clear Draco was enjoying.
. He knew it didn't make sense, but he continued to glare at the books, wanting them to know what they'd done.
Ron made a pained face, and signalled to the bartender for a pint. "Don't really want to think about the two of you fucking
"And don't even give me that shite about him not feeling the same way. I told you about all the ridiculous soppy eyes you make at him and everything, but he does it all right back. Come on Harry, it's so obvious it's painful."
By the end of two hours, he managed to put everything in order by summoning the ingredients one by one, and repairing the jars. Once he had ascertained that his veritaserum was, in fact, miraculously untouched, he dragged himself up to the sixth floor.
Harry hummed contentedly and obediently dropped back off into unconsciousness. Draco shut his eyes too, but he quickly realised his brain was wide awake and there was no chance of him getting back to sleep now.
Harry wouldn't say the man looked the embodiment of a long line of proud pureblood aristocracy, but he certainly looked recognisable.
Harry rolled his eyes, and then, when that garnered no response, raised a judgemental eyebrow until Draco sighed and finally removed the hand.
Harry dropped the hand from Draco's mouth, and pressed a kiss to his cheek. "It won't take them long to warm up to you, I know it. They're all very nice, and they love me, so I'm sure they will be very willing to give you the benefit of the doubt."
"Fucking hell," He reached for his bedside drawer and pulled out a bottle of lube, "I'm going to fuck the shit out of you."
He stood quickly, putting his wand into his robe pocket, and stripping the whole thing off carelessly onto the floor whilst he toed off his shoes (shoes of a kind that really were not meant to ever be
studies, there was widely varying information on its properties. All that was known was speculation, and the discovery of when to pick it may not be at its
Several students dropped by Harry’s office to wish him happy holidays, and he even got a few chocolate bars (Honeydukes, at that)! He was elated. His students actually liked him,
Grabbing the finished cup of coffee as it floated toward him, he headed back upstairs to get dressed.
Perhaps Harry should have predicted that Ron and Hermione would be suspiciously hard to get ahold of the next day.
Eyeliner smudged to his satisfaction, he added a nifty little temporary vision spell he'd found so he could do without his glasses for a few hours. Whilst he was at it, he charmed his eyes brown and his hair a bit lighter and longer. He knew charms wouldn't do a thing about the state of it, so he didn't even bother. Looking in the mirror, he tapped his wand on his chin (something he'd been repeatedly not to do by Hermione — honestly it was quite dangerous) and frowned. He made some minute adjustments to the way his facial features sat and...
"Fuck. Come on Harry, you know how I want it right now." His head fell back against the tree as Harry ground against him again.
Draco brought their hands up to his mouth to kiss the tops of Harry's knuckles. "Yeah? Was that a possibility before?"
"What if they don't like the food? They already kind of hate me. Should I have made a second option? I mean it's aubergine parmigiana, that's fairly inoffensive, right?"
"I told them to go back to their dorms, it's not my fault they're nosey little bastards. It's too bloody early for this." Honestly, Harry had barely been awake this whole time — how was he supposed to somehow know everything?
There were several new faces at the faculty table, so he supposed starting out his classes this year would be quite the adventure. Not, of course, that he forgot why there was more than one. His mind snapped to the image of Professor Burbage suspended above the table in Malfoy Manor screaming as she was tortured, and then to Snape's memories leaking out and covering the ground. Harry shook his head to clear it and took a sip of tea to calm himself. It was still quite hot and his tongue smarted at the burning liquid, but he took a few more sips anyway.
He stalled on the staircase, debating whether to just go up to his dormitory and stick it out or go to the kitchens and risk being late for curfew. The staircase made a deep rumbling sound and began to move. Well that settled it. Harry began heading back down the stairs to the kitchens; he hadn't made it far anyway.
Just as he was thinking this, a promising advert caught his eye. Yes, he just might check the place out. He wrote down the information and decided he'd stop by that afternoon after visiting St. Mungo's. He'd gotten in the habit of visiting several times a week, because if he couldn't work, why not at least do something somewhat impactful?
"Not today. Just not— I'm too tired. I can't deal with you lot doing this too. Draco didn't drug me, as hard as that apparently is for some of you to believe, so can I please just go see the kids so I can
Acting out of habit, Harry grabbed a slice of buttered toast and commenced staring at the table. Robotically, he began pulling it to pieces and occasionally nibbling on one or the other. He hadn't eaten much at dinner the night before, and his stomach growled, but he ignored it. It wasn't only hunger — he felt quite queasy as well, but was well used to it. At Grimmauld Place he had kept to the same ritual every morning, and it was working fine so far. His stomach had felt off ever since their irregular year traveling. The past few months hadn't really done anything to fix that.
bloke gave him a blowjob on the fourth floor once during a free period. He might've been lying though, he
"Thank you," he said sarcastically, once he got it free (both the letter, and his hand from the bird's pointed grasp). He unfolded the parchment and the owl gave a high pitched screech.
Lavinia slowly stood and made a few complex motions with her wand, muttering an incantation under her breath, and a clear blue orb appeared in front of his chest.
," a Seventh Year Gryffindor butted in with a smirk. "Beth! I've been looking for you. Are you lot all talking about Potter and Malfoy?"
They had meant to go to sleep, as it was already somewhat late on a school night. That hadn't quite happened though, and they had fallen into a rather heated snogging session instead.
"I'm reasonably sure I didn't have all this stuff just lying around my kitchen?" he finally said, trying to steer the conversation away from all the things Harry never got to experience because everybody around him had died too soon.
Well. That wasn't how he'd planned on his morning going. He glanced at the clock and swore, rushing back to his bedroom.
"Pretty much," he laughed. "I only learned how to make it because Sirius used to talk about how much he missed my grandmother's cooking. This was his favourite, so I thought I'd at least look it up and give it a go."
Rodya could be rather imposing when they had a mind to be — they were very tall and had a strong nose and solemn face that easily lent itself to scowling. Not that they actually
"We'll just be gone for two days — maybe less — and I left you a fresh bowl of water right here, see?" He pointed to the bowl of water in Bartholomew's cage. "The window is open just enough for you; you just got in fine, so there shouldn't be any problems."
"I'm getting the distinct impression that there's something I'm missing. And that none of you are going to tell me. You're all adults, come on, give me a break! Just, fill me in on something."
As he walked down the street, he caught sight of the shiny haired person he'd seen from the window leaning against the light post on the corner, smoking a cigarette. Harry thought he looked rather pale and pointy, almost like a Malfoy.
And maybe Draco felt pretty content right now too. Even with his discomfort, feeling like he didn't belong at the Weasley family's Christmas, and his silly jealousy, and his stupidly hopeless pining after Harry. The room was warm and filled with laughter and chatter, and he was holding hands with the man who had so quickly wormed his way into his life, and who was now — to Draco's surprise — his best friend. He was safe and full of good food, and he thought maybe things didn't have to live up to your highest hopes to be worth enjoying.
After Harry Apparated back to his house, he went through his firecall with Ron and Hermione in a daze.
"I will be teaching you transfiguration and, to be quite honest, I'm glad I've got you lot first," Professor Ludgor continued, "You're adults, and therefore less likely to shred me to pieces on my first day."
Harry stuck his tongue out and Draco raised a brow. "Better put that away before I get any more ideas."
Harry's frown deepened, and he ran a hand over Draco's left arm, fingers trailing over the faded mark.
"Ugh." Draco hauled himself up and pulled on one of Harry's pairs of ridiculous Muggle sweatpants. He swore this was the only occasion Harry's habit of leaving random articles of clothing all over the floor would ever be helpful.
Harry grimaced at the fawning and cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Erm, not really, sorry. I wasn't really heading any place in particular, I just stopped in."
Harry didn’t roll his eyes, but it was a near thing. “Everybody’s been yelled at by Harry Potter — it’s not scary at all, judging by how willing people continue to be to violate any and all personal boundaries.”
He slicked up his cock, and slowly pushed in. Draco moaned loudly trying to push down, and Harry thrust all the way in, making Draco's voice go up an octave. "Yes, yes, please fuck me. Please, oh Merlin." Harry set a fast pace, snapping his hips up frantically. It felt so tight he figured it must have been at least a bit painful for Draco, but if it was he didn't seem to mind. He dug his nails into Harry's back, leaving scratches up to his shoulders.
"You may call me Minerva now Harry, you are, after all, a part of the staff." Her eyes twinkled as she spoke. "Shall I show you to your living quarters?"
as well. Speaking of the outside, he realised that lunch may very well be over and he'd better see if he was late for class.
Six months ago, Harry would have wanted to startle him and mess up his brew (admittedly, a small part of him still did), but now he realised that not only was it not worth it, but it also wouldn't make him feel better in any way. He was starting to realise how pointless most of the time and energy he'd spent antagonising Draco had been.
Hermione bit her lip. “We were all unsure of how he was still alive till now. But with this information, we have proof that he might have something like that.”
Lily nodded. "These objects could only be created by committing the supreme act of evil and that is murder." She looked pained as she voiced these things out.
Her own voice rang in her mind. She was the one who said that to Chang in their younger years when she was still naïve. Well, no more of that now. She took a deep breath and with eyes filled with conviction and determination, she entered the passage.
Hermione looked down at her Grimoire as she recited the names of the Forbidden Grimoires. “The Inseparable Thee or the Trinity, The Infinite Door, The Twins and The Non-existent.”
Theo looked at the witch who finally opened her eyes to the hidden darkness of Chang. “I have eyes everywhere, Granger. We have always been watching what happens inside of this castle, but it has never been in our place to interfere.”
But then Lestrange did something that made Harry’s blood boil again. He ruffled up Marius’ platinum hair in an attempt to make them a bit presentable. As a reaction, the human had a very annoyed expression on his face, but the fondness still seeped out of his eyes. That, in reply, earned him a look of pure adoration in Lestrange’s eyes as they joked around.
Ron could not comprehend what was happening as the woman then crouched to the ground and stood up using the sword as a cane. He was scared for the old woman if she fall since all her wounds have opened but she held up her hand and stopped him from assisting her.
Orion shook his head. "Go, Blaise. I will not be tolerating a weeping bumbling mess of a Longbottom if he finds out you are mangled to death by his Alpha."
“This better be good.” Pansy crossed her arms and tapped her feet to the carpet as she stood and Theo merely looked at them pointedly.
“While Andromeda was born a Light witch, Bellatrix was her opposite. The latter was promised to become the High witch, but when their mother retired, she announced that Andromeda would be her Heir. This caused Bellatrix to go on a rampage. She was stopped by the death of their mother but she swore to take back everything Andromeda has taken from her.”
Hermione followed her to see what was happening but then she saw that what Narcissa entered was the lavatory where she was puking her guts out. From behind Hermione, a figure appeared and helped Narcissa as she patted her back carefully.
Hermione nodded along with the two. The took several steps forward and as soon as they passed the doorway, the passageway going down was lit to life as fire began to pop from the torches. The group then carefully threaded inside, flinching slightly when the entrance snapped shut.
“Our Grandfather married someone from the Black family and since the Black name is never allowed to be forgotten or erased, he took on the name Black as his surname. It was a small thing for him to sacrifice as he would do anything for his mate.” Orion stopped for a while. He looked toward his cousin who looked in deep thought as if figuring out what Orion really wanted to tell him.
Neville, thinking Blaise was upset at him, started panicking out of his mind. He chased after the other in impulse before he hugged him from behind to stop him. “’m sorry.” He snuggled his face further to the back of his mate as Blaise’s scent began calming him down.
The Headmaster merely smiled at him. “No, I never thought that this would escape your notice. After all, you have worked the longest as a spy for the Order in the past.”
"Dilato," she whispered with careful words as she took out her wand. The bracelet glowed dark and it expanded, creating a circle made by an elaborate twisting and knots of what seemed to have been vines.
“Ow!” she said as she rubbed her bottom. She then looked up unknowingly with a glare, only to see Luna Lovegood began to ease away from her. Hermione realized she must have scared her due so she took a deep breath and held in her anger. She then offered her hand for the blonde girl to take. Lovegood merely looked at her offered hand then her brown eyes as if uncertain.
As she looked into Draco’s eyes, she knew that he would not answer her. She just grinned and released him, seeing the chains settle and assuring that the binding spell was complete. She looked back at the Witch Tree now burning and her gaze fell to Draco as she voiced out. “So that was your aim.”
Blaise blinked his eyes. "I have never seen Granger that speechless before." He then began to chuckle.
, the way she tried to apprehend him in his mischievous ways, in trying to sneak up on her or brewing potions he was not supposed to.
“There is your answer”, then Harry closed his eyes and tried to remember the scent he grew up in, Narcissa’s scent, it smells of pine, morning dew, and a tinge of mint and he always feel comforted in their lands.
Marius held up his hand to stop Harry’s tirade of questions and allow him to continue. The werewolf seemed reluctant but he allowed Marius to do so.
Orion huffed. “Of course I know that, but you know what will happen if he does find out. Draco will tear this place to shreds and he will die before he would get to them.”
“Draco can handle himself mate”, shouted Ron as he sided up next to him as he backed away from his own opponent. Harry took one look again and nodded at Ron, his eyes glinting and the two attacked simultaneously.
Beneath the azure sky, in front of a newly erected tomb a teenage boy crouched in front of it. His blonde almost white hair mingled along with the soft breeze, his eyes that of molten silver with a small hint of blue near the black of it. His pale skin almost looks ethereal, making him look like a woodland creature lost in the land of men. Beside him sat a St. Bernard dog its tongue lolling at the side of its mouth, he also stared at the tomb as if waiting for her to rise up and ruffle his thick fur.
“Uh I-I’ ll j-just g-go”, Neville stuttered a reply, he did not think that any one would be outside of the Great Hall when everyone is currently having dinner, so he was pretty astounded when he saw Zabini and Nott.
Hermione then looked at Ginny with disbelief, not fully understanding what was just said. Harry and Ron remained quiet.
"Then call me Marius", he stated as they both let go but then Neville’s smile suddenly disappeared and bowed his head and Marius looked behind him to see what made him do that only to see, Blaise Zabini smiling down at him.
“Now answer me, human”, when Marius determined that he is fine he stood up and faced those cold blue eyes.
He never knew who mutilated Cedric to the point that Draco could no longer feel the presence of his soul in his body. When he found him in the woods that day along with his family, cold and so
“What is this thing?”, he shouted at no one in particular and Penny Elmore then woke weakly she looked towards Auror Weasley who was healing her wounds, to Auror Potter who was holding a shield against them. She then looked up at Auror Weasley who looked torn to helping his partner or to continue on healing her. She saw his shining blue eyes and that cemented her gamble.
“Mom I-I…why did you leave me?”, after long hours of holding it all in everything came crashing down to him. He was now kneeling on the carpet and his arms holding onto the couch for support. He knew even if he asked any questions nor say anything he would not be answered, so he cried his heart out.
. Then watched as Clarke easily chopped, diced, mixed, stirred and added the ingredients as if he had already done those potions regularly. He was not even looking at the books to follow instructions and he was even humming.
“Huh? We are related to the Longbottom’s?” Draco blinked. He never really cared much about his grandparents as all he knew was that they were already dead, so it was quite a shock to suddenly know that.
When he saw the Dark Lord, he still looked weak as only one part of his Seal was removed due to the death of Narcissa, his aunt, the main castor of the Seal. He was given a mission that was to act as a Spy and poison Albus Dumbledore to weaken his connection to the ward. That way, he could easily help his Mother to destroy the barrier and allow them to kill the Headmaster.
“I found a loop-hole. When the Dark Lord disappeared years ago, it gave me time to research more about the Mark, but I only found little knowledge about it.” Minerva’s eyebrow rose at this feeling a huge respect to the vampire in front of her. She listened as Severus explained. “Long story short, I found out that perfecting what you witches call Occulemency would be the perfect shield from him truly controlling me further.”
Marius smiled to himself when he was about to brew the last potion in his exam for potions when he realized that it might cause some problems seeing that there are werewolves and vampires present, that has heightened senses. So he decided to raise his hand and hope that Professor Snape would notice him. And as soon as he raised his hand the Professor raised his eyebrow at him and he began to drawl in a bored tone.
"How would be able to go against such a thing?" Molly voiced out, feeling hopelessness seep through her body as she clutched her trembling fingers together.
“Good Morning.” A yawn was heard from beside Theo. When he and Blaise looked at who it was, they realized that it was Pansy who sat beside them as she always did in the past.
“Do not worry. I have no idea what your plans are Headmaster, but is it wise for a stranger like her to weave her magic amongst these walls?”
The old vampire could only nod as he began to speak. "The Horcrux I know of is an object that has hidden a fragment of the creator's soul for the purpose of attaining immortality."
Shaking his head to focus on a much important matter, he began thinking of ways on how he would have his own protection and when his eyes darted to the unconscious witch, it sparked an idea in his brain as grin bloomed on his face. He closed off his potions book and made sure that the curtains were closed behind him. After that, he slowly stood up and approached the sleeping witch.
He turned to Severus with tears on his eyes and the old Vampire could not help but place his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I don’t want them to be born to be nothing but that monster’s vessels. But when I felt the life thrum within this Tree, I knew I would do everything to protect them. Even if I have to kill the Dark Lord here and now to do it, I will.”
Orion’s eyes landed on the center of attention before they met Marius unwavering gaze. Within second, he was already standing feet away from the human. He closed his eyes as he savored the smell of blood in the air and when he opened his eyes, it was swirling blue with a hint of it turning red.
She watched the witches with Bellatrix were slowly backing out along with a few of the werewolves who were injured. Hermione found this odd, but that was when she realized the hooded werewolf that felt just like Harry began to move. Before she knew it, Ron fell and soon, the others began to fall as well. It all happened so fast that she felt a chill run up her spine and she kept herself on high alert now knowing where the werewolf would strike next.
“Listen to me Gin, if Nymphadora leaves this place with my body, she will not just take Leviathan with her but also Lucifer”, Ginny’s eyes snapped to meet Luna’s her eyes widening.
The Dark Lord’s eyes grew dark at this and so he nodded. “Fine. Train the weaker one as you desire, but he will remain my spare.”
He turned to his right, staring at Regulus. And then to his left, to Corvus, whose bond with him seemingly weak. “What did Bellatrix do to you?”
Almost all eyes were on Marius and Orion now as they sat together cordially next to each other. Orion glared at them, causing them to look away.
That was when Marius realized he apparently didn’t have the whole day for himself. He pouted once again. “Tomorrow, then,” he offered. “Harry told me things about the war but only the gist of it. Besides, I want to learn it from your side as well. I want to understand.”
Harry was about to protest that Marius did not belong to anyone but Pansy did not even allow him.  “We leave you to Orion’s hands. Or claws.” She laughed as she walked out, followed by a nervous looking Neville. They were followed by Blaise and Ron who gave him a pat on the shoulder as if bidding him good luck. Harry looked back to see the glaring face of Orion.
“Young Clarke we bid you the best of luck”, then Griphook bowed and apparated away after handing Marius with a watering can portkey.
As if on cue, the locket shook slightly and afterward, she heard the opening of a door and gears moving to finally reveal to her the entrance to the Chamber where Salazar Slytherin's familiar's slumbered. A wicked smile appeared on her lips when she gazed back at the locket she held.
Draco looked back at the huge castle behind him which caused Fred to stop on his tracks along with Ginny, who looked at his back wanting to know what was on the thoughts of the human. Beau sat by Draco’s side as he nudged his fingers. Draco then patted the dog’s head.
“Where is she headed?”, Hermione voiced out as she held her wand upward casting another of her Patronus to cast away the Dementors that are swirling towards a group of younger years. Ginny looked towards Hermione and she voiced out.
Hermione shouted back. “Says the one who needs it most!” She smiled a bit knowing that the werewolf had heard it.
“Well, actually I was sitting next to Orion, but came to sit with Theo to ask him to teach me about some Vampire traditions I was hard up in explaining for my essay to Professor McGonagall.” He looked at Snape with that sheepish smile of his once more and the Professor yielded, though reluctantly.
Hey! Its been so long, how have you guys been? I hope you are all well! Finally found the time to write and update despite these busy times! I appreciate you all for being so patient with me hugs to all of you and a huge huge thank you!
With the Aging Potion that Severus brewed himself, the children were able to grow faster than they expected and with their special circumstance, they were able to endure their training and the fast changing of their bodies. They both grew strong and wise, while Severus taught the child he was assigned to about the meaning of this war, about his Father, about his role to play, about the truth of everything.
Dumbledore could not hide the fact that he was a bit put out by that, but he has no control over it. Draco was free to do as he wished. He was not bound to anything anymore since his mother died. He was no longer startled when the blond began to ask.
Luna stared at Ginny as if asking her the exact same question. It took the other witch several long sighs before she finally muttered, “Wanna go to classes with us?”
Standing up from where he sat, he gave his dog a pat on the head along with a small smile. He placed on his cloak over his clothes, removing all pieces of evidence that he was even a student at Hogwarts. Walking towards his trunk, he kneeled down in front of it, Beau following him and watching closely as if knowing what he was about to do.
“Thanks, Professor,” he said as he easily slipped from his seat. Before going to his place next to Orion, he stopped a bit to whisper to the still gaping Neville.
“That is our difference, Aunt. I found someone who accepted me despite everything I have ever done. That person told me that I was brave for not running away from what I did. I know that it does not excuse what I did and it never will, but I would spend my life repenting for it. By defeating you. By helping Harry defeat the Dark Lord and finally bring peace to our worlds.” He then surprised his Aunt as he cast a spell that threw her to the farthest corner of the room. He saw a cloaked figure jumped up to her side.
"Yes, I don't know how or when but it is possible that within this castle we have a traitor in our midst."
Draco gave Dumbledore a grateful smile. With a deep released sigh, the fog dissipated and his magic sealed up once again, no trace of it left in their surroundings.
Lestrange rolled his eyes. “Oh, I’m sorry, Princess. This must be embarrassing for you.” And when Lestrange was about to stand up, Marius wrapped his hands around his neck, grinning.
After a few minutes the door to his room opened only revealing Head Auror Robards. He gave a sigh of relief as he will finally know of what happened after the incident.
"Do I have to?" It seems that even in his child state within his mind, Harry knew of his fate. Draco gave him a sad smile as if not wanting for this small child in front of him to face the real world where he truly is. Something within Draco awakened. He wanted to protect Harry whose small shoulders held the fate of their world.
The witch was startled from her musings when she felt hands on her shoulder. “I’m sorry I was lost in thought,” she replied.
"That he was struggling and having fears upon fighting the Dark Lord?" His eyes glanced Harry who was asleep.
He looked up to see who placed it. He knew it was Hermione just by the look of the book. But how wrong was he when he saw the smiling face of his mate right in front of him. His heart beat was acting up quick as he was sure Pansy Parkinson would be able to fully hear it.
“I shall see it done, I will also ensure that any use of your vault will not be traced to the Black family vaults”
“I know, but I would rather die by your hand than fall to the wrong side.” Harry’s face was scrunched up. He looked like he was about to burst into anger as he tried to turn away, but Draco held him still as he stared up into those eyes. “I don’t want to burden you with that pain, but I don’t want to be turned into a person who will be a thorn against you in this war. I know how capable I am. Mowing down a single village is nothing to me. What more when I reach my age and my magic is fully released?”
“Narcissa never liked attention nor war nor power, but amongst her sisters she was the one that was graced with it. Yes, she remained neutral but when the Vampire factions almost obliterated us all, but Fate made her move. She casted a Blood Ward, the one that protects our pack lands, and ever since then Vampires cannot enter it. It became a safe haven for all werewolves during the war, and with the alliance they brought down the Dark Lord. And well we all know what happened, the Dark Lord’s followers disappeared, some were caught and casted to Azkaban and some of them died.”
Snape rushed to his office to create the cure for the poison, the others began to take a step back away from Harry's form.
Draco looked contemplative for a second. “I will figure something out.” He paused. “Are you really Rowena?”
“He loo—“, Theo abruptly stopped his words when he heard a sudden squeak and he and Blaise both turned around to see Longbottom staring at them widely.
Bellatrix looked around her at the barrier casted around her and the Dementors she had summoned. She cackled in delight as her dark aura puffed out of her like smoke, she could feel the panic of all the professors and it fuelled up her glee.
Her daughter tensed and fear began to overtake her nerves. She knew she was not paying much attention to whom did the signature belong to. She was about to apologize when her Mother spoke.
“Well, he is very good at finding out things. He would eventually know if we lie and he might misunderstand if we don’t explain it to him properly.” Marius’s eyebrow raised at this—true. Instead of helping, Harry might go against their plan.
“You’re not meant to be here”, Barty’s cheery tone was back and amusement laced his very words as he looked up to the hooded figure but he coughed out blood due to Harry’s attack.
Neville looked down once more and Blaise did not stop approaching him, Marius and Theo was watching this development with keen interest. Theo was a bit surprised he knew this would happen eventually but he did not expect it to happen this soon. He then looked at Marius who was currently watching the scene unfold his eyes guarded, but his smile betrayed his face as he seemed pleased.
“Hey, what are you guys doing here?”, Harry looked at them amused and Ron shrugged his shoulders as he began to move towards the kitchen holding what seems to be a case file.
Orion then began to carry him to his quarters, leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione stunned on their places.
“Gred, Forge.” Harry greeted. Beside him, he noticed how Lestrange froze at his spot. His posture was stiff and his eyes empty as he looked up at the twins.
“Hurry, Gin! Before she comes out again”, Ginny was shaking her head tears flowing down her cheeks and even Theo looked down at the ground as his fist clenched at his side feeling helpless at that moment.
Orion sat down at one of the single seater couches and settled himself comfortably. Marius sat at the seat next to Pansy and immediately Pansy let her head fall to Marius’ lap. Neville watched the reaction of Orion from this and he noticed that he did not flinch at all. Gaining the courage to ask, he directed his question to Orion. “Uhm, aren’t you mates?”
“I’m sure you know of this, but no one was ever born to be a hybrid even though you have a mixed blood. You could only be a werewolf or a vampire or in females case, a witch. Despite having both parents who are a vampire and a werewolf, you could only be born with one race,” Orion said.
Harry watched as Draco wretched himself away from his embrace and held onto his head, his face that of in pain. His grunts of pain were all that Harry could hear. The werewolf had no idea what to do. He kept on asking Draco what was wrong but it seemed like the blonde was lost to the world around him. His ear-piercing screams made the hairs on Harry’s arms stand with fear and worry.
Then Draco did the only thing he was good at and he glared up at the wolf and stepped back only to cross his arms. In this form, he could only look up at Harry's huge stature.
this chapter has been edited by Authlene, she actually sent this edited chapter to me two days ago but today was my only free time to post it haha...thanks again for editing my story Authlene
Her protégé turned towards her. “Mother!” the girl voiced out her worry and something indescribable in her voice.
“Seriously, mate. I thought there was another huge problem, that was all?” Harry huffed but then Neville’s voice made Harry’s eyes snap to him.
“Looks like no one is home Harry”, Ron voiced out and as soon as they both decided to leave for the Hospital a voiced startled them.
Harry could not hear any words exchanged between them and Remus suddenly stood by his side along with Ron taking in a defensive position. “This is bad”, Remus voiced out and Harry has never seen Remus this worried in a while.
"Where is he? Oooh I wanna talk to him..", then she began to babble but then the human's soft voice rang to his head.
Her eyes found Sirius’ sad ones and he shook his head. “It is never advised, Hermione. I know that your intention to do it may be pure, but if you change the fate of someone’s death, another might have to die in their place. Time will eat you alive if you use its powers recklessly and without thought or practice.”
Pansy pouted at him. “Tsk! I don’t want to. Orion is not fun at all. That person is more like a walking statue than anything. At least with Neville here, I get to see interesting expressions.” She grinned wickedly at the end of her sentence which forced Blaise to drag Neville and go sit somewhere else.
“Your dog is huge Marius, what’s his name?” Pansy asked as she avoided the dog’s attempt to lick her face.
“Then—” The gleam in the Dark Lord’s eyes was something that could make up for being unable to take control of Draco fully.
“Woah there, mate. Chill.” Ron reflexively held both of his hands up in surrender and that was then that Harry realized he bared his fangs at the other werewolf.
“What would you want us to do?”, he stood firm, unwavering and with determination in his green eyes that it sparkled in the light of the fire.
“You plan to only use him to strengthen the Blood Wards?”, Remus sighed as if in resignation, but there was nothing they could do. They were desperate and the boy could be the only thing saving them from the annihilation of their race so he hardened his features.
Marius did his best to catch her before her head hit the ground. He laid her down on the ground carefully along with the two.
A twin laughter, so like his own except for the coldness, echoed throughout the clearing. "You allowed us once. When you desired power, when you desired revenge, when you wanted blood; don't you remember?" The memories flooded Draco's mind of that day and he clasped his hands to his head, wishing the onslaught to stop. "Remember, we are you. We are the you who wanted to raze the world in flames. We are everything you wanted to deny about who you are, and no matter what you do, that won't change a thing."
"What is wrong?" He held up his hand to touch Draco's face and it was warm, so warm that Draco could not help but lean into it as he whispered back.
The voice was of a child's but it was cold and full of the promise of punishment. She turned her head upwards as if she was facing her master back in the underground where he was sealed.
They reached a wide open room with a room full of books soon after. Shelves after shelves of books that seemed to have been preserved were present and books that have been said to have been extinct were all there as well.
Orion nodded, eyes closed as those horrible memories clouded up his whole being. He clutched on his cousin’s hand who acted as his only anchor now when his head was trying to rip him apart once again.
“It’s just that…nevermind”, then he looked away from Blaise’s scrutiny and Blaise looked like a bulb just lighted up his head.
Had Harry’s eyes always been that green before? How could Marius miss that before? Those eyes reminded him so much of the spring fields where he and his Mother used to go and have a picnic. Stunning
“What does this mean Bellatrix?”, Bellatrix grunted, she needed to find the child quickly before he/she gets to the hands of their enemies, she has no time to be explaining.
“It’s rare to see one of the remaining pillars of the Vampire faction to actually come all the way here,” James voiced out only to be proven wrong when another person came out of the carriage with a face they all knew too well.
Hermione clenched her fists. It hurt but it wasn’t like she cared anyway. So she picked her wand and pointed it towards Cho Chang who blinked at it. This time, she wasn’t kidding when her brows furrowed in confusion, her eyes screaming disbelief.
“That is admirable of you”, Theo’s eyes were bright as they stared at Ginny’s own and she could not stop the flush that run up to her face. In order to hide it she looked away and she could not stop her voice when she stuttered.
Hermione glared in return and Lestrange seemed to be enjoying this more and more. From the corner of her eyes, she could see Pansy staring at the scene at the Whomping Willow and she had a look of envy in her eyes.
“We refuse to serve a Lord who will bring about the doom of everything,” a Centaur bravely voiced out.
The first ray of sunshine hit Harry's face who was so happily curled around Draco, his green eyes peeking slightly to see that it was probably now late in the morning. It did not surprise him as they both talked about everything all night long, but he knew there were some things that Draco still couldn't tell him. He was all right with that. He just had to be patient and wait for his mate to open up to him more.
"Ah, Avada Kedavra", this made Harry look back at him when he was about to leave, trying to confirm what he heard he took a step closer.
“You are?”, Elmore voiced out as she then began to grab at one of the umbrella’s in the stand where they were placed and the woman that Elmore knew as one of her close friends smiled at her.
“You are such an obedient child.” Nymphadora patted the head of the boy as he waited for his blood to be spilled to call forth Bellatrix.
“You really think Albus that after all of the things they did, that their children would be born with Angel’s wings and proclaim that suddenly they did not want us to be killed?”, she looked sharply at Dumbledore before she Apparated away her eyes deadly.
Marius was then suddenly tugged toward the bed. His face, hands, arms, and body subjected to the inspection of one Harry Potter.
Meanwhile, Harry was sitting on one of the couches. He was silent, in a somehow strange way that may or may not be only Hermione’s feeling, only recognizing their entrance by nodding his head before quickly staring at anything that was not the both of them. This time, Hermione’s eyebrows scrunched in confusion.
Marius blinked and blinked. When he could finally think clearer, there was a faint smile appeared on his face as he let his hand fell away. The smile didn’t last long, however. He finally proceeded that he had let someone witness his vulnerable moment, so hang his head low.
Neville was confused when Blaise released him too quickly. He looked back at Hermione, trying to make up on what Blaise meant. Hermione was looking suspicious as well and so she asked.
Underlying the words that Narcissa spoke out loud, it seemed that a secret message only meant for the three of them to hear was embedded. ‘My friends, once the dagger is embedded in the center of the ward, the true prophecy that I have hidden shall reveal itself to you three. Someday you will understand its true meaning just as I have.'
“That wasn’t you, Harry, because the Harry that I know has a big heart, very kind and would never even hurt a single fly.” Harry snorted at that, but a voice that called his name rang in his head. It was so seemingly similar to Marius’s voice, but Harry shook his head knowing it was impossible.
“But what about your Father? Would he be alright within the Dark Lord’s lair?” Hermione asked and the others perked up at this, forgetting for a moment that this was only possible due to another person’s sacrifice.
“One life or everyone’s,” rang the spirit’s voice and Hermione’s brain went to work. She then recalled the way Narcissa would touch her stomach. The look of pure and utter love for her child was displayed there so it would be impossible for her to sacrifice her child for the war. But there was no news of her having another child. During the sealing of the Dark Lord, she was not pregnant at all.
His thoughts traveled back to his conversation with Harry in the Astronomy Tower. He tipped his head back, closed his eyes as the warm water washed upon his lithe form.
Albus Dumbledore assured that all of Hogwarts occupants would be asleep other than him, Minerva and Draco. The new recreation of the wards was going to be cast for tonight and he was anxious. He understood so little about the Prophecy that Narcissa whispered upon them when the Blood ward of Gryffindor lands was renewed to its former strength.
He looked toward the Alpha he was born to kill and all he sees within those eyes are nothing but the eyes of a pure wolf, desperate, rage, and the full need to protect. He watched as the blond within the dome break and he felt something within him broke as well. Soon the Dementors began to suck everything out of the huge black wolf, he released a breath.
They all knew they had to do it soon. The mark on Orion’s hand had begun to hurt him more and more as the days passed. The Dark Lord was getting impatient and he was demanding results. They had to do it before Christmas break.
“I know.” Severus held Draco’s hand and he gave him a small smile. “I apologize, but I had no other choice.”
Marius was seething with fed up energy. He wanted to blow off some steam. However, he could not do just that. His cousin, as soon as he had calmed himself and assured Marius a dozen of times that he was okay, headed off to the dungeons. He couldn’t do anything after that.
“That idiot. He distanced himself from us, as soon as Sixth Year began. He became someone we did not know.” He scoffed at no one but himself and continued. “We tried, you know. But he just won’t let us in, he even almost wounded Blaise to death during our training the past month. And I was so mad, I convinced Blaise to stay away from him.”
“Well it is for Neville to be able to relax inside the classroom and not be scared of Snape”, he grinned then Theo asked him.
Harry was about to ask something but Draco looked at him with a tired expression so he yielded. He picked up Draco seeing that he was not capable of standing by his own while Draco wiped the blood from his nose with his white sleeves and tucked his head to the nape of Harry’s neck, inhaling in the scent of Harry.
Bellatrix hummed as she casted a dome to envelop them both as she began to tell her tale, with her connection to the dead she knew of things only dead people knew. “To be honest I never found out who did one of the most horrific thing I have ever seen till the day I felt your magic.” Bellatrix hugged herself in joy as she remembered the day she felt that dark magic.
“I can’t sleep, Aunt Bella.” He leaned his head at the window as he picked up a dagger that glinted with the moon’s light. The memories in it flashed before his eyes and he clutched the dagger tightly.
“And yet you massacred a village, in your rage not even remembering that you ever did”, Draco stood shell shocked his mouth agape, his eyes blank as tears flowed from them. A soft whisper of
Orion looked up at Severus who looked at the scene grimly. They both knew what is about to come. “When should we inform Draco?”
He tampered it all down and watched as Orion then inhaled deeply at Draco's wrist. His eyes then widen in shock and full of horror as he tentatively returned Draco's wrist down. He snapped his gaze to Harry. There was no question to what he was saying, they needed to talk now.
“What? It seemed like the right thing to do”, Ginny ignored the idiot not after she rolled her eyes and directed a glare to Luna, no, the one possessing her body.
“You are not thinking what I thought you are thinking right, Orion?” Marius asked warily and a bit scared.
To all of you who left kudos, comments, subscibed, bookmarked and read this story of mine, thank you all so so so much!!!! Stay safe everyone!
“Ah and I have heard from Severus that you were able to perfect all of your brews yesterday, he also wishes you to enter his Sixth year class and not the Fifth”, Albus said as he opened one of his candy from the table and gestured for Marius to pick one but he shook his head. Then the words sunk in to Marius’ brain then he stared at the Headmaster.
“You are the same, Harry.” The human chuckled darkly.  “You only protect those under your wing, but what about those who aren’t?”
“No, she—she would never”, her eyes darted to Hermione, but when she looked down her eyes closed and her hand was gripping tightly on her wand Ginny could not accept what she just heard.
He looked down in fear that that blood might be Harry's, but then when he looked down the corpse was no longer there. The other him smiled at him. He was offered a hand to stand up. Shaking, Draco tentatively took it.
“…And that is all that have occurred here in Hogwarts.” She finished her report of the day with little emotions as possible.
“I apologize Remus, Headmaster and Lady Andromeda but we have to go”, he then dragged Ron out of the Room of Requirement and as soon as they were out Ron exploded.
He did not notice how Harry’s eyes widened, body frozen. The werewolf heart’s skipped a beat and he clutched his clothes just above his heart to calm himself. Harry shook his head furiously, all the while chanting,
Hermione held the Grimoire close to her heart. It gave her a warm feeling of hope that they are now closer to figuring things out. She knew she had to share this information with the adults but this was not the time. First, they had to put Marius’ plan into action. She was snapped from her thoughts when Ginny suddenly spoke up.
“Don’t hurt her too much, we need her still”, Leviathan then Lucifer released and he fell to the ground.
When it was over, the color of the room tuned dark red as if feeling the rage that Andromeda was feeling right now. She turned her sharp eyes at the three Ravenclaws before she stood up and shouted, "Where is the Dark Witch that has tainted you, Cho? Tell me!”
Most of the Dementors were trapped within the barrier but some has escaped and Hermione and the rest of the higher years who were present casted their Patronuses to chase the rest away. McGonagall locked eyes with her signalling them to escape, she nodded her head as she then began to lead the students to safety.
“Something big is about to happen and I need your help.” The air became tense and all his pack mates sat up to listen carefully. They all know that everything said within these walls would not be known to anyone else.
“But Professor isn’t that too much?”, and both Professor Snape and the human looked at him as if he was saying something wrong, then Snape raised his eyebrows at him.
“Though it would have been much more satisfying to kill them in that way. We don’t have much time.” Bellatrix then picked up her cloak that she draped over the chair where she once sat and began to chant as she took out her wand.
“Hey if you guys need help in Potions I will gladly help you along with Neville, and Neville can help you with Herbology and you can help me in both Vampire and Werewolf Studies along with History. How about it, I mean it’s not that bad if we study together, right?”, he waited for their responses and Blaise nodded along with Theo.
Marius smiled at her reaction before he began to explain what was written. The girl seemed amazed at his knowledge before Luna spoke again.
“No, Beau. We might get caught by Filch and I don’t want you chasing his cat.” He chuckled softly as he imagined Beau chasing the cat and Filch running after them to stop Beau.
Draco smiled, again. Now, though, it looked terrifying and Orion didn’t even know why. “Because we both know that you never wanted to walk the path she set out for you.”
“Don’t you have anywhere better to sleep in, Nott?” Hermione voiced out, knowing that the vampire heard her loud and clear. The hand that was hanging suddenly picked up the book from his face as drowsy eyes awoke. Soon, they found Hermione’s brown eyes and the vampire gave a small lazy smile. Hermione’s eyebrow rose at this, not knowing what made the vampire so amused.
His thoughts then made its way to Harry. The way he had been avoiding him these past few days had begun to be so obvious that he was growing irritated. He was not sure whether to snap at the werewolf or just be silent and allow things to happen.
Marius covered his mouth as his form shook a bit but he caught himself. Good thing the others’ attention was upon Narcissa or else they would realize there was something more to it. But then, he felt a spark of something within him as he felt deceived. He was prepared to spit out the impostor in front of him when Ginny began to ask.
Hello again guys! thank you all so much for your support, geez i cant believe it i reached 500+ kudos! it made me happy thank you all so much! to all the kind and supportive comments i loved reading them it made me happy despite having a crappy day in college.
“Well, I leave you to whatever it is that you plan to do,” he turned back but before he could walk away a line of light appeared in front of him. His eyes followed this to see that it was a circle surrounding all four of them. Severus’ eyes found those icy blue eyes that seem to understand his whole being and asked.
“Not to be rude or anything but why is an Unspeakable investigating this case?”, Harry asked Hermione and she replied crossing her arms.
As soon as Orion and the rest entered Slytherin Common Room, some of the vampires were still awake. Most of them Orion found out were marked by the Dark Lord. He stiffened his posture and wore his usual cold demeanor. He signaled Blaise, Theo, and Pansy to leave so he was left alone with the marked Slytherins.
The cold slightly damp floor of a ground full of snake skeletons appeared on view as Nymphadora within Luna's body jumped from the unused girls' bathroom where she found that god awful ghost who wouldn't stop crying as if anyone cared about her tears. She banished the ghost easily to the toilet where she crawled from with a single flick of her hand. A door with fingers that were actually real-like snakes once again greeted her. She clutched the necklace again and as if on sync, the door's mechanism began to move as the snakes curved out of the way to open the door.
Soon the ground where they were standing began to shake and the stone where the words were engraved seemed to sink to the floor, replaced by another stone. All eyes snapped at the wall when the bricks began to reform themselves, opening a doorway. The four gasped in shock and in admiration at the doorway.
The world around them seemed to change then. Hermione watched in awe as the Room easily weaved its magic. “This is?”
“Mom”, he caressed the couch and he stood in front of it, as if he could see her sitting there and looking up at him and asking him such questions, he could now hear her voice in his head.
“Since the other one will be a spare, may I, my Lord raise him?” The Dark Lord’s eyebrow rose at this and so she explained. “I wish to train the spare to be my heir. Children born from Witch Trees are rare and I wouldn’t want to pass up on an opportunity such as this.”
Now those two vampires turned toward the poor werewolf. “You knew!?” Both their booming voices now echoed through the room and Neville was shaking at the duo. And then the three of them—Marius, Orion, poor Neville—were now under the scrutiny of a mother-like glare by Pansy, a father-like disapproving eye by Theo, and a disbelieving stare by a certain someone’s mate.
“The Dark Lord wouldn’t be able to possess them even if he were to try.” Draco’s eyes snapped from the Tree’s bark to Severus in an instant. “You have every right to be furious at me, for what I have done. But I changed the properties of the Potion used to grow the tree.”
Slightly, his eyes widened as he remembered himself coughing up black blood—rotten black blood that would soon happen to him often as the change and battle for his magic would begin within him. He felt pathetic letting a single word from Harry break him.
“I had to do it, you know? If we allow dark witches with huge amounts of magic in their bodies challenge us, we will lose,” Chang explained and Hermione shook her head.
Draco could feel the exhaustion seeping into his bones, his magic core losing the battle of endurance. The controlled amount of magic he could use is running out. He could see from his peripheral view that another battle began. Sweat was forming on his forehead and he could see that his Aunt is now playing with him by now.
“You’re not mad at me for being mates with a Vampire?” His eyes were wide and unbelieving but all Harry did be gave a small smile as he shook his head.
“So, why are we all here for? Are we planning something?” Pansy asked as she folded her feet on one of the couches. Neville looked lost when Blaise went to the bathroom as well and he did not know where to sit. Pansy noticed this and gestured for him to sit next to her. Neville swallowed and the smile that Pansy gave him was implying that he was not allowed to refuse. So he sat next to her, what he did not expect was when Pansy laid her head on his shoulder. He instantly stiffened at this and looked to Marius for help but he was not in the room. The human went to fetch towels for Orion and Blaise. He then turned his head to Theo but even he was not looking at him. Rather, he was absorbed in mesmerism by the dog that was now sitting below Pansy’s feet near the couch he was sitting on.
“There is no other way”, Luna voiced back as she steeled herself. “I would rather be killed by a friend than to die by an enemy’s hand.”
A dozen questions spiraled his mind. One thing was clear if his sister came personally to Hogwarts something big is about to happen and no matter what he must assure that Draco is out of the castle before everything falls.
She looked up to see Sirius looking at her sceptically. “What did I tell you about pushing your limits?”
“Headmaster this room was not even present in that book my—“, Albus noticed the sudden paused and he watched as Marius easily schooled his features to that of indifference.
“So, what brought you here?” Hermione then broke her silence before things got even messy and Blaise answered for them this time.
When Harry noticed Marius wearing Lestrange’s school robes, he almost couldn’t stop a growl from his throat. It didn’t help him when Lestrange’s sharp eyes went to his direction once again. The Vampire was coming closer after that, but fortunately, he was tugged by Marius. This was then that Harry noticed they were holding hands.
"She said that she left the key to destroying the Horcruxes in her Grimoire, but we don't even know where her Grimoire is."
“You did it.” Harry beamed at him with pride and Draco sighed in relief. He did not even care when Harry began to pick him up bridal style and laid him down on the bed. The werewolf removing the covers to cover him with it. He crouched down near his head and folded his arms atop the bed to watch him. Draco wanted to talk to him more but Harry just brushed his stray hair away from his face. Draco found this so endearing.
“I can’t. Mother will kill h—me,“ he stopped his sentence as he realized he was about to touch a corner of his memories that he never wanted to be opened. Marius seemed to have understood this and he then looked down in deep thought.
“—survive this.”, the hooded figure then turned his back as he helped up Barty and the Dementors, Draco held back broke out of their chains. Hermione and the other witches casted a barrier made out of Patronuses.
Barty Crouch Jr. and the cloaked werewolf figure were staying still as if waiting for something. He parried with two werewolves who tried to attack Harry as Remus tried to connect with Harry to regain his senses. He wounded the werewolves and they retreated near the cloaked werewolf. He huffed his breathing and kept a cool head. He shook his head to stop himself from thinking too much, for now, that was. For now, he had to keep those wolves from Harry
Orion smiled at him and Pansy spoke as if in exhaustion. “Finally, all this drama is over. I am about to get tired of waiting.” She smirked, amused. They all continued their breakfast not caring about the stares of the other houses directed at them.
Orion was so close to standing up and go find a mop to help him wipe off Draco's smug grin, but the change in Draco’s expression a blink later stopped him. The human threw his gaze away, settling on the surface opposite him as if the bare wall provided him with more sense of comfort than Orion’s presence ever could. "I am the very first of my kind, the first male wizard ever to be born,” he said a beat later. “That was one of the reasons my mother disappeared. All of it was in order to protect me."
Next was Luna’s turn. “I have to go as well,” the girl informed them with a small smile. "This mini-adventure was fun. See you later, Hermione, Marius.” With a wave, she followed Ginny out.
“Fifty points to Hufflepuff, and you may not brew that potion. Perhaps you can assist Mr. Longbottom in his potion as I am taking you as a student of mine now in this class. So you better pass all of your exams.”, he said then his robe billowed along with him as he returned back to his seat and continued grading some essays. He ignored the shocked expressions of his students and when he lifted his eyes to gaze back at them one glare made them all continue their brewing.
Blaise's eyebrows knotted at this and he sighed. "To be honest, I was a bit hurt when you started avoiding me. But I guess, we both needed the time to think this through." He gave a small smile until he noticed that Neville wasn't so tense anymore.
"What is it, Andromeda?" Sirius voiced out, worry laced his voice. Andromeda ignored him and opted to cast a spell on the rune. As soon as the magic touched the rune, she hissed. The magic rebounded back to her. She then turned her eyes to Penelope and pointed at her. "You. Try a tracking spell."
He smiled at her in return before shaking his head. “I’m afraid I can’t. I don’t want to be caught in the crossfire,” he smirked. Ginny’s eyes widened and she laughed, clutching her stomach.
"What?" Lily voiced out softy, confusion in her voice as she did not know that such a ritual had another effect or use. Then she began to counteract, as that was just a scary bedtime story. "But this was just a myth, a story made up, by old ancestors to warn us of the horrors if we ever try to dabble with achieving something impossible and unreachable unless—" at that moment, Lily could not help but feel nothing but despair,
Suddenly, she stopped from her walk to look up at the ceiling of the hallway, only to see a familiar vampire seemingly taking a nap. Theodore Nott sat in one of the beams, his foot crossed with each other and his one hand hanging and the other was placed on his stomach as a book was rested on his face, balanced.
"I will help you with your Vampire Studies essay and in return…" she then leaned in as she placed one of her elbows on the table so she could rest her chin on the back of her hand. The way her hair cradled her face made Ron want to touch her cheek, but he drove that thought away as he raised an eyebrow with a bored look. "...You will help me with my Werewolf Studies essay. How about that?"
Orion glared back at him and pushed Harry away as he stood. "No, Potter. This was not something a Vampire could do and you know that."
“I memorized all the properties of the Black Family and besides that old cottage has been known to be destroyed, no one will be able to enter but me”
The Vampires then began their search for the Chamber as soon as the sun hit the horizon during their breaks. Whenever they were free, they scoured the whole of the castle. Marius, too, searched around the castle and when he was alone in his room, he did his hardest to cast the minute magic that he could.
It took the cooperation of several departments to track down all of his clients and obliviate and cure them from the effects of the pseudo-love potion, which they learned to be harmful to the muggles especially if overdosed. Mcnair did not have the necessary ingredients for the potion so he improvised and those improvisations led to eleven muggle deaths.
She watched as the three left the Great Hall. She followed but with one last glance at the Great Hall, she could still see that things that occurred and could feel the magic humming. She was sure she could never look at the Great Hall the same way again.
Orion was worried about leaving his cousin alone as he left the Headmaster’s office, but he cannot disobey the order of the Headmaster. Since it was found out by the Headmaster that he had been feeding on Draco, the Headmaster made it his priority to provide Orion with his own food source.
She could feel the rage within her swirl as the darkness enveloped her and claim her. She clutched Theo’s hand and cradled it on her cheek. “Your death will not be in vain. I will not make it all in vain”
Hermione began to think of a place and her eyes sparkled, an idea in them. “Don’t worry about it. I know of a place.” She then began to stack up the potion ingredients to better hold them and charmed them to look like books.
Molly then gestured for Albus to follow her as they both walked towards the office of James Potter. She knocked on the door and soon they both heard a voice telling them to enter. The door opened to reveal Lily sitting at one of the couches near the bookshelves, her hands folded on top of a book. Sirius seated next to her while Beta Remus stood near the large mahogany table where James' hands were clasped.
Marius’ ears perked up at this. “I have read things about rare Vampires who can view memories when drinking blood, but I never thought you are one.” When he offered Orion his blood, Draco could only guess his cover would be blown up because the vampire would recognize the similarity of their blood, being family and all that. He definitely didn’t think his memories were being read too.
Luna stopped her body from shivering to the cold touch of the woman as she swallowed and let her face remain blank and emotionless. Nymphadora regarded her with eyes proud and truly happy that left Luna's blood to run cold. She knew her Master was planning something when she asked her to summon her in Hogwarts.
Hermione nodded and Theo grinned. “It seems that you are right, Marius. The Chamber does exist and we were not the first ones who tried to seek it.”
That was the thought that crossed her mind as she looked to Harry and Ron who seem to understand what it meant.
All eyes were wide and some were even gaping at him. Even Orion, who in a million years would never expect such convincing reaction, gaped too.
She could feel her muscles tensing. Hermione panted when she felt blood trickling from her nose. Her shoulders slumped and her hands leaned into the wooden table. A handkerchief was handed to her.
“He took the glass that I hid and began to grab my hand. He was different toward me despite me being a vampire. He helped me and I was awed at that. I protested that it would easily heal but he said, ‘How could you be so selfish. What would your mate feel if they knew of what you are doing to yourself?’. I was stunned at what he said and I became quiet. He bandaged my hand with his handkerchief.” Orion chuckled a bit and Draco smiled at him.
Orion reached the entrance to the Great Hall in record time and he saw his friends waiting for him there. Pansy kept on checking her nails, Theo was leaning on the wall while Blaise was nowhere to be found and as soon as Marius' eyes saw him, he had a grim look on his features that brought warning signs to his head.
“Shame. You were still supposed to give life to a few more children using the Tree for spares, but no matter. I guess the twins will be enough, for now.”
"What game are you playing at Harry?" his voice was unsure with a mixture of things Harry could not place.
When she was sure that the spell was cast, she left the wand to her side and placed one of her hands to Draco’s chest as she began to chant again in long mutters of Latin. Soon, a darker shadow began to seep in within Draco’s body and he began to slightly convulse as his body trashed, his arms seemed to hug himself as he curled up into a ball. Nymphadora smiled.
Dumbledore's eyes widened. "Does he know who you…" Dumbledore did not think of continuing as Draco shook his head. Then his eyes regarded Orion and he asked, "Young Orion has been…"
Hermione’s eyes widened. She had tried for months to destroy the Horcrux they found a year ago, but it only reformed itself proving to be indestructible.
Harry never thought that his day off would start of this way, a cold case that has now been re-opened. Though to think they never saw this coming, meaning that whoever was doing this was very smart and very old. If Hermione was right, since the wound from 20 years ago was seemingly the same as the victims they had lately. Or perhaps the perpetrator this time was an imitator or a cult continuing their work now that the Dark Lord is gone.
The Gryffindor stared at the blonde as he smiled whole-heartedly. He cannot help but look up to him as if he was the moon that soothed and eased the souls and silently, without knowing, lighting up the darkness within people’s hearts with his illuminating light.
Sirius, who was watching from the side-lines, could not help but voice out what was on his mind. “I’m sure you did not come here just to introduce yourselves, did you?”
“If those objects do give him power, then it is imperative that we find it all and destroy it.” Dumbledore looked at his students who looked prepared for the upcoming war. He felt a huge pang of regret that in this war, he could not offer his help to any of them and yet, they decided to protect him. He wished that their true Elder could be here at his side to order them or tell them to wage war against the Dark Lord. But alas, he was also lost to them. “The others must be informed of this. I will convince them of your plan concerning me. That is the least I could do for all of you.”
Ginny’s lips didn’t immediately curve upwards at the answer, but the slight twitch at the corner was as close as she could be to a smile at the moment. She then darted her eyes towards Orion who was playing with his food, faking uninterested gesture which kind of failed horribly.
“It is the rose that only blooms once every thousand years. I had my mother encase it in a stasis spell so it won’t ever wilt.”
Orion looked away from the blood that was dripping on the dagger as he could smell slightly the smell of Draco’s blood. Despite being able to control his hunger, he still could not control it now with the mark making anyone’s blood so appealing to him.
Said boys were left with a smile on their faces as well and for a few seconds, it was quiet again. Perfect. The human then began searching for a book to read. Surprisingly, though, his movement halted as a sigh registered in his ears.
“Want me to help you?”, Marius thought for a while before nodding and they both headed to the ingredients cabinet.
Harry then tested his limits when he placed a soft kiss on Marius' neck. He could feel the fast beating of his heart even without his hearing due to their close contact. He felt himself inwardly smile as he learned he had this much effect on Marius.
The scene suddenly changed and once again it showed Narcissa who looked distressed sitting on one of the couches. Regina Clarke, sitting next to her, held her hand in her lap. Her voice was soft and cautious as she spoke to Narcissa in a calm manner.
Draco swallowed, it was clear to Dumbledore that he wants to ask something from him. “Mother once had something like this, she said it belonged to my—“ He cut off his sentence as he looked away, that topic has always been a huge taboo between him and his mother. His loss had been a huge thorn in his mother’s eyes, as she left him with only but a promise to return. But she could no longer return to his side, as the city where he was, was burned to the ground. “—but that is impossible, he was human”
“Do we kill the unconscious ones?” Barty voiced out, his claws already out. He hissed when the snow touched him.
Neville blushed as he slowly nodded his head. Pansy then sat in front of him. Good thing the Hall was empty because most of the students were in Hogsmeade.
Orion and Severus watched the twins as they held each other, laughed together, and spoke to each other.
A scream that sounded so close to that of a child having a huge tantrum echoed within the quiet hall. Draco and the others lifted their heads to the direction where the sound came from. Their eyes widened when they could not believe what they are seeing. A slightly crazed than ever Bellatrix Lestrange stood where her usual smile now gone and the only rage reflected her eyes.
“I will destroy you, Bellatrix, even if it’s the last thing I will do!” Draco shouted, but was ignored as Orion voiced out.
Orion’s eyes then flashed to Hermione sharply as he began to ask. “What the hell happened in the Chamber?”
Marius was the one who answered. “Magic script. I saw Narcissa use this in one of her letters. It can only be seen when embedded with a sufficient amount of magic.”
He could feel his body slowly losing consciousness as it focused all his energy on his wound. But before he fully passed out, he could hear the others screaming in pain. He could smell the blood and hear the laughter of Barty in the background as he raved about their future Alpha.
Draco snuck his head to Harry’s chest. His grip on his clothes was tighter as if he was scared of Harry leaving him, so he just hugged Draco and combed his blond hair to soothe him. He kissed the top of his head. He wanted to know what could make Draco this vulnerable but he was afraid to ask him.
Her eyes mirrored the flames as it burned. Luna watched as the ashes of the vines danced in the room. When she looked at the center of the circle a moment later; there, she stood.
Harry sat there, frozen. His time stopped, his body rigid and his wolf howled in despair and rage as if the mere thought of Draco’s death was something he could not imagine. He could not speak. He felt like even his breathing stopped and he was stuck in a loop as he could not comprehend what Draco just voiced out to him.
Neville smiled at the acceptance and Blaise side-hugged him with all the affection he could give out at that moment.
The Vampire seemed to notice this and so he stood up from where he was and voiced out, “I am sure this is not only your decision to make. Therefore, I will leave both Lady Ephira and Blaise here as my ambassadors. Please, treat them well.”
please tell me what you guys think, i like hearing your thoughts! thanks once again and see you all in the next chapter!XD
Orion knocked on the door. Severus looked around them before he allowed them in. On a couch by the fireplace, sat another boy. The disillusionment charm fell away as he looked at a boy who looked just like him. The only difference was that the colors of his eyes were each on the opposite eye.
Some of the owls appeared to be asleep while the others were watching them so keenly as if every move was recorded. Hermione was about to take a step further when suddenly she felt a pulse of magic on her shoulder. She held onto it using her hand, furrowing her eyebrows as she thought of why it was buzzing with magic. The answer she got made her eyes widened.
Marius sat on the rug along with Beau who settled his head on the lap of the human. Hermione joined him as they talked about what kind of breed Beau is and how did he find the dog. They waited in silence for the remaining members of their weird group.
“May your gold multiply and prosper”, and Ragnok smiled at this and bowed his head as Draco did the same.
The doors of the infirmary was suddenly pushed open. Marius' head snapped only to see Theo, Blaise, and Neville. As soon as Theo's eyes met his, they approached him. The human thought that Theo looked like a man on a mission. Suddenly, hands were on his shoulder. Theo's eyes hold his gaze sharply, his orbs looked threatening and it made a shiver ran down Marius’ spine.
“Sorry, Marius,” said Harry, his eyes not completely meeting Marius’s grey ones. “I just came with Hermione to deliver them.”
Marius then began to talk about herbs but it wasn’t long before he was interrupted by Professor Snape as he walked out of his office and began to scold a pair. Marius angled his head to see who it was, only to find out that it was Harry and Ron he was scolding. He sighed and shook his head. Thinking about Harry, he frowned. It wasn’t like he was still mad. He already forgave the werewolf, if he were to be honest, but
A loud howl filled up Draco's ears as his eyes widened. Without hesitation, Harry began to attack him again and Draco activated the other bindings only for them all to be broken. Before Harry could pounce on him, Draco raised up both of his arms, his mouth didn't stop throwing incantation over incantation, until a circle barrier appeared around himself. The set of jaws coming for him was stopped as the werewolf hit the barrier.
“Goodbye, Professor”, flashes of memories, of a girl that smiled and laughed like there is no tomorrow. One who spoke of achieving the impossible and making it into reality now faded into nothing.
“Luna”, Ginny was about to rush to her side and undo the bindings she placed on her friend but Luna screamed.
“I can’t just trust your word about Lestrange, Marius. Despite me seeing that he has changed, it still does not erase the past that I have with him.”
Orion and Marius shared a look. There was a bit of silent when the two began to wordlessly argue of what to do. In the end, though, Orion sighed. It was a clue they decided that no secrets should be kept within them.
"Don't worry, I am very patient, unlike my mother who would surely force you to submission. Though, this will be an interesting game between us." She smiled as she turned back on her heels, walking back to the entrance but continued talking.
Harry sighed, knowing that the vampire would not explain more. So he stood up and opted to leave when the vampire's voice stopped him in his tracks.
Bellatrix Lestrange was slightly startled when she heard a voice hissed to her ear. She stood from a chair she conjured. In the huge field in front of her, there were a group of Centaurs being held down by a group of wild werewolves. She held up her hand to stop the lashings so she could hear her Lord’s voice much more clearly.
dead that something chained deep within him awoke, he called it forth and he delved in it, he permitted it. The presence of humans within the area was prominent upon him that in his crazed state. He committed a crime he did not know he was capable of doing.
“It has been a long time since I have seen people enter this place.” A voice boomed. It sounded feminine enough to pass as a female’s. The echo it made around the room made it hard to point exactly where it came from.
“This is farewell, Hermione. I hope that the next time we meet, you will be the High Witch.” Cho gave a full-blown smile before she ran up her room, soon followed by Marietta and Padma who gave a nod of thanks to her.
“What a bunch of nerds.” A nearby vampire muttered under his breath as he picked up a book and left the Library. But his comment was left ignored as the three concentrated in their reading. A few moments later, Hermione stood up abruptly in her seat and pushed the book towards her two companions.
“Cedric”, she uttered and the figure before her gave her a smile that she knows all too well. One she had so desperately missed all days of her life, she could feel emotions swirling within her that she had so long buried and her eyes then turned steely and without an order. The figure she called Cedric was then pinned to the wall by Leviathan.
“To us, Dark witches, our magic signature is black. It is always black, the tainted, while the Light witches have white or silver. Pure, they say. But the witch who did this is both. Dark and Light. An unnatural phenomenon.”
The Potion's Master did not look back and the Headmaster could see the tension and the slight sag of his shoulders.
"What NO! Just shut up Pansy", his face was red as he stomped out of the Great Hall, Theo followed him shaking his head. Then he turned his head to look at Neville who is fixing his bag to leave as well, so he followed Blaise outside the Great Hall.
Zabini sat at one of the love seats along with Neville Longbottom who looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Meanwhile, Parkinson leaned on one of the passages that seem to lead to the quarters, boring holes at the back of Ron’s head which the werewolf seemed to ignore.
“Because they are cousins, Orion’s Mother is Bellatrix.” Marius did not expect to let that information be free but it seemed that Harry is as stubborn as they say that he had to use all of his arsenals just to convince him.
“Uh-uhm..I don’t think it is a good idea, I’m a werewolf and they are vam--“, Neville did not get to finish his sentence as Marius pinned him with his grey eyes.
Harry looked at him gratefully. “No, no, we really can’t. So before these feelings of mine get even stronger, I have to bury them all away.” He paused before saying, “For his sake and mine.”
“Tears do not fit you, Marius.” Even his voice sounded so soothing, so calming. Only his mother ever managed to sound that caring of him before. “Try smiling again, will you? That works better.”
Bellatrix skipped to pick up a knife on a nearby table and she slit her palm as she began chanting, she could almost feel the fear and taste it emanating from her slaves. Then a spell she learned from one of her dear sisters she casted on the five simultaneously.
He rounded up on an empty alcove as he felt like he was going to get sick. He clutched his stomach to stop his body from hurling, but all too soon he began to vomit. His throat hurt and he was heaving, but when he saw that he did not vomit his breakfast rather he vomited what seemed to be like black goo, his blood ran cold. His mind frozen.
“I will be fine Headmaster, thank you for your concern”, he said as they reached a door near the dungeons but before they were to enter, Dumbledore looked at him.
Dumbledore was cut away from his musings as he then stared up at Draco’s eyes and gestured for him to continue.
Remus called him inside of the Conference Room. He gave a bow to all those present before saying, "Alpha, Bellatrix Black has begun amassing a huge army."
A small smile began to form in Draco’s lips. The thought of having someone to share everything with, someone who would stand by him no matter what, was something he longed to have for so long but thought could never have. Now that he has it, he assured himself that he would never let it all go. He was only human, despite it all, as long as Harry is by his side he would face everything even if it would go against his Mother’s will. He wondered, when has he became so selfish, but with the warmth of Harry that enveloped him… He hoped that she would forgive him.
“If you really are that suspicious of Severus, I already removed the mark on his arm. And, besides, from the start he has always been loyal to my family,” the vampire glared at the adults as if reprimanding them and challenging them for their animosity.
"I apologize for that Professor," he said but the amusement dancing in his eyes told another story. He was glared at in return but Draco knew that there was no malice in them as he saw the swirl of amusement in the vampire's eyes as well.
“Hey, hey.” He held onto the cheeks of the boy whose eyes were glazed, nose bleeding and muttering words as he pointed his hand at the now dead animal. “You have to stop. Please, look at me.”
She discontinued her sentence and Narcissa understood what she meant as she placed a careful hand on her stomach. She caressed it and Hermione then realized—
“No, I won’t meet with him unless necessary. What he needs right now is to focus on defeating the Dark Lord.” His hand fell away to reveal heterochromatic eyes, his left bearing emerald color and on his right mercurial. It was a sign of his origins that he was deigned to protect.
“I know that this might seem like a Phantom chase, but Narcissa’s protection on him puts us in an advantage as Bellatrix won’t be able to find him with magic. We will search for him our way.”, this made the others grin and chuckle.
He killed Cedric, his Aunt who has an affinity with death showed him that. He can’t think he could live with that. Draco, lost in his darkness, was not able to see the smile his Aunt hid when she eased away from him.
Marius was baffled by what was happening. Orion then released him to look down at the balcony as if measuring how high it is from the ground.
“Orion.” Marius’ voiced echoed through the silence and Orion’s sharp eyes met his. Just by one look alone, the vampire knew what Marius was talking about. He grunted and looked away, but that only made things worse as he felt the eyes of all of them on him.
“Why don’t you ask your fellow Light Witches?” Marius said, sarcasm dripping his voice, without turning his head to face her as he helped Madam Pomfrey apply a salve to the poor girl’s back.
The female looked confused at her but then a realization seemed to come to her. “Ah, the Chamber took my form, didn’t it? Though, how? You haven’t even seen what Narcissa looked like just by seeing your memories.”
Harry’s eyes were beautiful, Marius concluded easily. He had never thought of spending some time staring at them before, but now he was aware he had been wrong before. As cliché as it sounded, he couldn’t even think of anything else but stare and stare. Funny that he almost thought as if he was being sucked by those pools of green that seemed to be glinting as they reflected the light.
"Seems like they were able to tame the young Potter," she whispered to herself wickedly. "I will let you take control of your body for a bit, my Luna." She then yielded control and Luna awakened with a gasp while she was standing. She felt the violation of having no control of her body but knowing what is happening. She tried to evict Nymphadora from within her body but there was something else entirely preventing her from doing so. She clutched her head trying to remember a name that Nymphadora called her once before.
“How were you able to sway from complete submission to the Dark Lord?” Minerva began to ask her voice unwavering and Severus scowled at her.
The Headmaster’s words were final and even if Minerva wanted to ask more questions, she knew she had to ask them some other time. “Of course, Headmaster.”
, he did not even notice the tears streaming down his face when he finally awoke from his musings. He covered his mouth to muffle the sounds coming out and he clutched the arm of the couch so much his knuckles turned white.
Neville looked at Marius with glee, as no one really was that interested in Herbology as he was. He felt happy to be able to share it with another person so he nodded vigorously as Marius gave him a smile.
“Did you know?” he asked as he slumped into the ground, finally understanding what Albus Dumbledore asked of him. Why he needed to personally enter the Malfoy Manor, why he needed to be here.
He looked down at the form in front of him. Draco's lips were slightly parted and his face showed such a serene expression that Harry could not even dare wake him up despite the numbness his arm was being subjected to: a pillow. If it was for him, it was all worth it.
The Dark Lord grinned at this. His red eyes shining with mirth. “I leave them in your care Severus.”
"Harry, you have to come back with me now." The stranger—Marius? Draco—then began to voice out and the child seemed to have stopped with wrapping his hand as he looked down and slowly inched away.
“Who would have thought that a Weasley would be able to produce a child who has this much magical power?”, Ginny gritted her teeth.
“What—Are you challenging me?” Chang’s voice came out shaky and a bit betrayed, but Hermione just looked at her with eyes full of sadness and conviction. Her eyebrows were scrunched up though, showing just how much the gesture inwardly pained her as well.
He closed his eyes and whispered in Latin successively a protective spell, but before he could finish, the doors of the room were opened with a blast and he casted a shield to protect them. He turned his head to see that Bellatrix was not alone. He pointed his wand at the intruders and casted consecutive spells, only to find them deflected by Bellatrix.
“Now, now my dear, snap out of it”, a cold sweet voice whispered upon her ear, black curly hair, with red blood lipstick, pale features and a black dress. Her smile spurred a shiver down their spine, Harry and Ron’s growl on the background was heard as they raised their guard up. Her eyes shifted towards them and her voice was so cold when she spoke.
you cannot disobey the Dark Lord as long as that mark is marring your skin.” Marius then subtly eyed Orion’s wrist, only for the latter to clutch it. Orion looked down and stared at the ground once again, feeling powerless despite his mother not being present.
Orion then looked up when a sudden clap came from Marius. He stared at his cousin whose eyes were darting everywhere as if he had reached a breakthrough.
“Don’t worry Alpha, Luna, the spell Bellatrix used is powerful and she would not dare any attempt soon…but the wards my blood cannot sustain it alone”
The boy snapped his head back at him so fast Draco was afraid he hurt himself by doing it, but the boy just stared at him with wide eyes, unbelieving. “Corvus?” His voice was small and trembling that Draco was afraid, afraid of knowing what Bellatrix did to him. But he was sure as hell he would burn that witch to nothing but ashes if she ever dared to hurt him. He would pay her back for all of it tenfold. “I-is that my name?”
“I am glad. Everything turned out alright,” Narcissa voiced out as she looked at the three witches with a smile on her features. When her eyes found Marius, he understood they spoke about what the three was going through when they were left alone, along with his plans. But her voice still rang in his mind as if a never-repeating record.
Hermione and Marius were the first ones to enter the Hufflepuff Dorm, seeing a grumbling, irritated Ron Weasley and a smug looking Blaise sitting on opposite couches.
Orion knew he was going to be left behind by his friends. Despite them being on different sides of the war, he truly did acknowledge them as his friends. He would understand if they all leave, but he was suddenly engulfed by Pansy’s warmth and scent that he felt tears beginning to form in his eyes. Theo held his hand, Blaise gave a pat on his shoulder, while Neville gave him a supporting smile.
Marius' posture straightened and he pinned them all with his eyes as if telling them to be ashamed of themselves. "I suggest you not judge a being by its race but by who they are and who they want to become. I will not just stand idly while you accuse my friends." With that, he turned his back and headed to the direction of Theo, Blaise, and Neville who was just watching him, as they heard every word.
He felt Marius squirm at the gesture, but he did not seem bothered by it. Instead, he seemed to welcome it as he tilted his head to the side, giving Harry more access. He then opened his mouth and the warm breath from his mouth made Marius shiver.
“Ah. Kind, neutral Narcissa. Had she become the High Witch, no Dark witch would ever be judged by their nature. But alas, she loved them both so much that she could not bear to choose a side. That was why she ran away from fate despite having the power to stop her sisters from destroying each other. Then the war happened, she reappeared and after she did her role, she once again vanished.”
“Don’t listen to him, listen to me”, Ron snapped his eyes toward her as he saw a silhouette of a man in an armor like the armors he had seen within the hallways of Hogwarts, then it disappeared when Elmore opened her closed eyes a faint smile on her lips. Ron has no idea what he is getting on here but all he knows that if he does not do this, all of them will die here.
“Shit”, he cursed as he saw the time and he was already late for his meeting with the Headmaster, he looked back one last time to the room and although he had already memorized every nook and cranny he still looked at it as if it’s the last time he would see it, and with a lighter feeling in his chest he exited.
His thoughts turned back to the werewolf. But even so, he decided he couldn’t stay. He shut his eyes in determination and when he opened them, he stared at the Headmaster. He knew Orion would understand and he knew the bond they all forged would not be broken that easily. Everything had already been set, and he, the unneeded piece of this war, needed to walk away.
Ron then procured the photo from his pocket and Ms. Elmore’s eyes widened as she placed down her cup, she released a sigh.
They were all stunned at the revelation. Albus remained quite shocked was an understatement. To be a witch born to the light and dark is rare. What is even rarer is that he is a male—an unusual phenomenon, indeed.
Her daughter approached her slowly. “I have never seen anything like it before, Mother. What is it?” she asked carefully.
He gave a tired sigh as he sealed his letters and began to call upon his owl to deliver them. He was going to send messages to his fellow Order members if they would be inclined to help. He might not have been their True Elder, but he held a bit of power to try and command them.
“Don’t worry, I set up a shield.” He placed one of his hand on Orion's forehead and whispered. “Sleep, cousin. I will take care of Harry.”
Then like a rope at the end of her wand, Hermione pulled on the bind she placed and Chang lost her balance. Hermione bound the other witch again quickly before using
“Glory to the Table”, Elmore voiced out with life now brimming in her once tired eyes as she gave a bow.
“Did anyone tell you?” Harry said, looking up at the ceiling and closing his eyes just a bit. He could feel the eyes of Marius watching his every move. He could feel the slight confusion in Marius' voice as he replied.
Marius sneered at that. Now he understood why Professor Snape was so bitter, what’s with dealing bunch of bullshits like this every day.
“Where are you going?” Orion asked him in a bored tone, releasing his collar and Marius faced him properly. He was about to reply when Orion sighed then turned his back.
"If you could all see this, it means that I am dead and my son has yielded this dagger to my cousin Sirius Black." They all turned to Dumbledore for this sudden turn of events, but Dumbledore shook his head. He was shocked as well.
”, a shriek was called out from the living room only to echo into the entire house was heard and the house shook from the sheer power.
Bellatrix’s eyes glanced at his son and Orion shook his head. “Now, come along, my darling. We have to present these children for our Lord.” She began to walk away, followed by Severus who remained quiet and Orion after giving Draco a final glance, as he was now unconscious. The door was closed and locked by several witches to prevent Draco form ever attempting to escape.
At first, he felt something warm touched his shoulder, causing his tears to slow down and his thoughts to pause. He recognized it as a hand, comforting and so familiar.
He heard a whine that emanated from Harry, his eyes daring him to leave him again. Draco did not have the heart to look back at him because he knew that he would not be able to let go. He would not be able to perform the spell needed to save them all. He released a breath he did not know he was holding and steeled his voice.
“How are they, Severus, Orion?” Draco asked. His back was facing the door, his magic dancing in the air as he tried to undo the binding spell they casted on him. The magic cancelled itself out. He cursed under his breath as his attempt was again a failure. “I’m getting close to breaking this. I even found a way to—“ He stopped when he noticed that there were a few more people to visit him than usual. Then he felt it, the warmth that he cradled and grew within this very room sung to him.
“Of course I covered it up, the Ministry doesn’t know a thing”, she huffed at the reply of the woman.
"Ah… I haven't had a fresh source of blood since I entered this school and you look so delicious. The way you flaunt yourself—ah… as if you are begging us to prey on you." His face was now close to his neck and Marius whimpered in pain.
He didn’t wait for them to answer as he ran at his own pace as well to the hospital, again, leaving the Granger and the werewolf standing behind for exactly two seconds before the both of them quickly caught up to him.
“All right then this Potion…”, then Marius began explaining the Potion that they were going to brew and the easiest way to cut the ingredients and some pointers for them to remember.
“Ah, he broke”, Barty smiled but was interrupted by a hand on his shoulder, he looked up to the hooded figure and smiled.
Hermione gave a worried look. They might not be close, but they were all on the same side. “Don’t let your guard down.”
Pansy smiled, knowing that the werewolf understood. She ruffled his hair before standing up, offering her hand for the werewolf to take.
“I will not make a deal with you Parkinson,” he said as he ignored the Vampire and decided to write stuff again on his parchment.
Marius watched and observed at how kind Potter’s eyes were and how he cared for his people. He almost gave in but his Mother’s warning rang to his ears that he sighed exasperatedly.
“I know that.” He almost shouted and his frustration seeped out of him that he was sure Orion was able to sense it. He was expecting the vampire to laugh at him or retort in any way but he merely yawned as if bored and this irritated Harry more so he turned his back to leave.
“Shut up, let’s just get back to the tower. I wanna go to bed”, Hermione and Harry shared a look then they dragged Ron to the Gryffindor Tower their footsteps heard in the dead of the night.
The werewolves, other than Lily, were glaring openly at Severus. The tension in the air was thick and heavy. Hermione could not help but turn to stare at the vampire who still hadn’t revealed himself. She was unsure on how the he was feeling, but she noticed that the he did not shy away from their glares and seem to glare back at them.
"Because I saw the Malfoy Family Tree. His date of birth and death was written there before the Dark Lord asked my Mother to burn the Malfoy Family tree in the old Malfoy Manor.”
“Oh my nephew, surrender is not an option and so does a deal. When I take you and I will—“ she pointed up her wand towards him. “—your very soul and being will be tainted black. I will revert you to the child that mercilessly plucked a village into nothing”
“How is my little Raven?” she quipped and the boy merely tilted his head towards her direction, his heterochromatic eyes glowing in the darkness. His left eye was mercurial grey and on his right was emerald. His black hair tousled and clothes rumpled, clearly showing that he hadn’t got any sleep.
Marius wished he could cast a Warming Spell but that would be a huge no for him. He needed to be more careful with his magic. But then, he felt someone rested a warm cloak on his shoulders. He looked back, only to see Harry without his black cloak in his form. The werewolf only wore his school robes now and he did not even look cold a bit. The human was about to protest but Harry spoke before he could.
Smiles bloomed from every person in the room when they all saw Dumbledore. Lily stood primly as she greeted Albus, followed by James who then gestured for the Headmaster to sit. Molly left the room saying that she would bring up some tea for all of them.
Hermione was also experiencing a mixture of feelings from what she saw before in the Chamber. It showed her things about the Dark Lord that they had never known about even though she still couldn’t understand what the spirit meant by telling her about the Dark Lord’s ‘chains of power’ that they had to break somehow.
“—got along so well?” They finished together that made Harry look at them with a face of horror. He was about to retort when Lestrange began to speak, his voice devoid of any emotion as he placed both of his hands behind his back. Harry could see that he was clutching his right wrist tightly.
Neville turned conscious when he noticed that Blaise was staring at him brazenly with his light brown eyes. He looked down embarrassedly, but his chin was lifted up once again. He was forced to face those piercing eyes that look at him as if he was the sun.
Dumbledore decided not to speak but instead, he took what seemed to have been a purple cloth. Everyone in the room waited with baited breath at what it was. As soon as Dumbledore revealed what was wrapped, an audible gasp was heard from Lily when she saw the achingly familiar dagger of Narcissa.
In the distance, Hermione was hiding behind a column, watching them with a small smile curling up her lips. She was about to leave when a voice whispered into her ear.
A smile graced Nymphadora's lips as she watched Luna fell asleep. She caressed the top of her head and kissed it softly. A dark shadow now began to envelop both of them and seemed to seep into Luna's body. Nymphadora looked down at Luna her eyes soft and endearing, but full of sadness in its wake. She spoke so softly and so fondly as if she had finally gained a heart.
“You’re my mate,” she said breathlessly and the silhouette nodded. Ginny wanted to run up to him but she could see that he was just an illusion of the room. Then, her defenses were up again. Her eyes turned serious and the man as if amused by her actions raised both hands.
“None of them told me,” Hermione gritted out, finally seeing her friend letting out her true colours.
“Well at least you already found your mate”, Hermione stated and Ron sighed deeply, he knows that his two best friends haven’t found their respective mates.
The elf disappeared with a pop to the kitchen, hiding the vial in her clothes she started to do her chores along with the others and the order still ingrained in her mind.
"Vampires search for their mates for almost a lifetime. I found you this early. Do you really think I would let anyone get in the way of my love for you?" Neville stared at him, not believing his hearing. Blaise just smiled wholeheartedly at him. The werewolf couldn't respond, so he was left gaping at the beautiful man in front of him.
Severus remained quiet as he merely watched the exchange of Bellatrix and the Dark Lord about the twins.
There he was, the very person who messed up with his thoughts sleeping peacefully under the tree. Harry's breath hitched when he drank in all of the details that were Marius. He felt like he had never seen anything so beautiful. The platinum hair in contrast with the bark of the tree, making it more prominent, and then his pale complexion. It was ethereal, even. Harry wasn't even thinking when his body moved forward. As soon as he was close enough, he could see his thick eyelashes fanning Marius' cheeks. This scene was much much better since it was close up.
It wasn’t a heartbeat later, as soon as Orion disappeared, that Harry, Ron, and Hermione rounded off the corner.
“Ha! And look where Longbottom got to huh?”, Blaise said as he snorted and Marius pinned him with his gaze.
“Orion, we are in this together, okay?” Pansy said as she hugged the life out of the vampire. “You can’t hide if your burden gets heavy. Please let us help you carry them.” She held the vampire’s cheeks in her hand as her eyes went glassy, unshed tears appearing.
Cho’s eyes were filled with tears along with Padma and Marietta who looked sorry for what they had done. Hermione did not expect the High Witch to act this way nor Chang. It was unlike her to take the blame.
Sirius huffed in amusement and James looked exasperated at the exchange. He was sure even Remus was doing the same. But because of this small banter of theirs, the heavy mood in the air cleared up slightly.
This seemed to push Harry out of his stupor and then decided to follow Orion as they braved through the empty hallways. They were both stopped from their tracks when a voice that Harry recognized all too well called upon them.
