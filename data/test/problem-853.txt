They then walked up and wrapped an arm each around her shoulders.
I don’t think i’m going to stay in Canada much longer.
The Ministry pardoned me but you knew that already I'm sure.
(Yes dear he’s fine...you know how he gets when Draco writes. - Hermione)
“Ok Harry, remember what the lawyer said.  He’ll handle it with Malfoy.
“Oh Hermione the lawyer contacted him he may have good news soon” harry said excitedly
And then you picked Weasley over me and I was crushed.
/Harry turned to look where the new demon was sitting surrounded by the others.  She was eating and nodding along to whatever they were saying./
“I suppose that would be alright...but please be careful.” she said
Sam cooed at Draco “It’ll be ok.  It’ll all work out you’ll see.” He said
“What on earth?” she said
And Ron needs to leave the post birds alone
“Why the hell do we even have cupcakes at breakfast anyway...totally barmy” she muttered
Harry just shook his head and opened his letter..leaving the package for last.
“Are you going to open your package Severus?” the headmistress asked
Draco nodded with tears in his eyes
“Thank You...Now I have an errand I need to run.  No Ron alone.  So that means all special detentions have been cancelled for the day.  /Everyone gasped/ I know ...I know and I hate to do it but this is very important .  And frankly I should have dealt with it myself long ago. Now you can still do study hall in the Library.   Ginny you’ll be in charge.
“What?” Cas started to ask
Harry handed over the letter.
“Good Boy….yes black with green studs then.” she said never once looking up
Ok Bye Love you...hugs!!
Harry just stayed with his head on the table.
It could be worse...
“Ok ‘Mione” harry said
Tell Hermione i heard of a place here where she can have Ron tied to a cross beam and publicly flogged.
“No, I think i should stay sober.” sam said
“Ronald….” hermione said glaring at him
“Big boy words Ronald...Big boy words.” she said
“Mr Demon do you like cookies?” ron asked
Draco
Hermione went over and gently picked up the bird and sat it by Neville .
Yours Frustratingly Forever ,
“I should hope so….bad boys get put in time out. Lest we forget.” she said firmly
My lawyer said the minister looked like he was going to cry.
“No you don’t classes start today.  Harry James Potter where are you going?” she yelled
I also enclosed some other items I thought might help with my loving god father..
“You will bloody well will not he’s a married man….Keep your feathers off of my husband!!” harry said
And honestly things seemed to be getting stranger.
“When is Draco going to be able to come back?” he asked
No clue where i’m going next...someone suggested Canada.
“WHAT?? WHY???” gabriel asked
Gasps and people pointing up…
“I’m not sure how i feel about Draco hunting vampires or traveling around with good looking hunters.” harry said
Dean had walked in and face planted on the sofa making funny mewling noises.
The bird swooped down and landed in Harry’s plate.
I hope everyone is having a great weekend .
“Awww come here darling….i’ll take such good care of you.” she said holding out her arms to him
Hermione you have to come to Colorado!! Seriously it’s brilliant lovey.
Pansy nodded and went back to eating
I have decided to just travel randomly for a while to see if I can find somewhere that feels like home.
“Yes” he said from where his head was tucked into Nevilles shoulder
“Me too mate.” ron said patting his back
I’m fine...it’s bloody hot here.
“Oh look a stork...Huh interesting.” Hermione said
Very flowy…
Get to work for Merlin's sake woman!!
I handling the end Supernatural just fine....i'm not crying and clinging onto the impala!!
“Of Course it is...now eat your breakfast.” she said glancing over at ron
Draco ,
I heard once that sharing is good for your soul or maybe that was chicken soup i don’t remember.
“Trust me I can relate.” Minerva said walking past him to leave the hall
Draco
“Do you think Miss is ok?” Pansy asked, tilting her head towards Hermione who was tapping her chin and muttering.
“Clarence what the hell? Wait is that a collar??” Meg asked
It’s so lovely!!
Hermione told him not to worry but he couldn’t help it.
“And while we’re helping we get to spend extra time with our Hermione….” George said smiling
He said waving a package around..
/EVERYONE IN THE HALL NODS/
Harry ,
Everyone turned and looked at Snape
“Oh Minnie, I need to borrow your floo.” she said
A bit slow to start but it will pick up once they're in school.
There was a gasp throughout the great hall
Hermione reached over and patted harry's hand
“Where??” Harry shot up excitedly
She looked up as Harry started to laugh.
“Mistress “ Severus asked walking up to the table
“Good Boy here eat this darling” hermione says hand feeding Severus
Someone asked 'What was that'
He then held out the glass to Sam and Draco.
“I will Missy  Mione”  Dobby said turning to go into the other room
She heard a bang and then some muttering.
That’s not even everything...this place is deadly.
“I never knew...I didn't know he loved me back. And now he’s gone.” harry said crying fresh tears
They wander around during the day and if direct sunlight hits them it’s like i’m a rave or something.
OMG that would be fantastic!
…...WHOOSH….
Harry handed her the letter and opened the package.
And going around to smaller towns I'll be able to find all sorts of cute baby things.
I really do wish you the best Harry.
“Oh Demon in the his house…woop woop” Gabriel yelled from the front table where he had stood up and was doing a wiggle type of dance
Hermione you owe me i truly pissed off this voodoo mambo to get you the stuff you wanted.
“Harry what’s wrong?” Hermione asked walking in and seeing the strange look on his face.
Best description was Hunger….
“Exactly harry….ahhhhhh...who are you?” Neville asked sounding scared
He opened the letter and smiled…
And out came Professor Snape.
“YES!.” Harry screamed
And with it a very strange bird…
I need a nap .
Not on her face and rarely on anyone elses face.
“But i requested detention” he said with icing on his chin
So you may need to beg….
“I am so confused right now and that’s rare for me.” Gabriel said
Where was he?  Was he ok? Was he sick or hurt?
(Harry are you alright...Hermione asked)
Severus is whipped....possibly literally.
(Dracos upset - Harry)
Everyone in the hall shuddered….
And you are to stay out of it...completely!!” Hermione lectured him
“Oh My!! Well upside she's not day drinking.” hermione said
“Oh you bloody heard me you git!.” Hermione yelled to him
LOVE YOU BYE ,
“YES!!” Harry cheered
Draco
Omg that reminds me I have been finding the most adorable baby clothes my love.
I'm going to be adding a bit of others in as well.
(Yes - hermione)
Is Minerva still day drinking??
“No, Harry, he told you to stay out of it.” hermione said
“Of Course Professor” she said smiling
Where is Granger ?  She’s supposed to be taking care of you. I left her in bloody charge of your helpless ass.
In one spot he saw Gabriel cuddled up to an older witch with his arm around her shoulders.
“I help Master Harry hunt post birds.” Kreacher said holding up an umbrella , a net and binoculars.
Oh well….whatever she thought
So i’m in Salam….and crazy i meet these hunters.
“Thank You Mistress” ron said running over to Castiel and pulling him to sit down
“That's true ...i do wish he’d smile less though he’s scaring the children.” minerva said
Granger what the hell?? You’re supposed to be looking after him.
Oh tell Castiel he can have Hermione explain the pizza man to him.
Mind you he doesn’t seem concerned about the other two.
“As my Mistress wishes.” Severus said
(Harry are you growling?-hermione)
And I have to go stop Ron from making explosives.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank You Mistress” Ron said
And why in the hell have you spent the last two weeks looking like crap and all sad?
Hermione looked at her with a raised eyebrow
“Here demon birdy….come have some cookies. Do you like to cuddle?” ron asked
“Dean, we'll have to take a plane to Scotland, you know that right?” Sam asked
Please let me know in the comments.
“Oh good lord….” she muttered heading out to deal with the damage.
It’s been a month since Draco's last letter and Harry was going nuts.
I need to put on some clothes
“Oh dear Merlin '' Hermione said, then swished her wand sending the birds back to wherever they came from.
One Week Later….
Did you know some vampires sparkle??
It almost sounds like you fancy me as well Potter…
“Yeah I have a let….” Meg started but was shut down really fast by a dark haired blur flinging itself at her and yanking the letter and package from her hands.
(And she sold me for 3 pigs...3 i was worth at least 4 i could juggle-crowley)
Not much going thankfully.
“Mail Harry” Neville said
“Oh i’m going to catch and when i do i’m gonna give you some kielbasa,” he said cackling
“But …” harry started
He was carrying a hammer and chisel.
(Well of course to Draco don’t be daft - hermione)
“Everyone can have your attention.” Hermione stood up and called to everyone
“Dean! Have a heart.” Sam said going over to rub Dracos back
“It’s ok Harry...Draco wouldn’t do anything with him he has you.” he said patting Harry’s back softly
“Kids Dean….his future kids.” Sam said smiling
“Always have a safe word…..consent is everything….after care is mandatory.” Castiel said
Leave nothing to the imagination but i love them.
“Well that’s odd.” hermione said looking at the owl
“Need me to tag along bust some heads and what not.” He asked cracking his knuckles
Younger years are welcome in study hall….if needed we can get you a tutor for whatever subject you’re having issues with.” Hermione informed everyone while pushing a plate to Neville
“Heya Harry mail “ seamus said pointing
But it’s creepy...so i left that area very fast.
And the moose seem a bit tense as well.
“Oh Castiel...do you want a cookie?” ron asked
Harry had his head down on the house table in the great hall.
Harry stood up quickly
So Sam and Dean had to salt and burn it.
Hermione had tears come to her eyes as she reached to hug Harry.
“Oi Harry mail..” Seamus called
Hermiones definatly losing it...
The muse just hasn't been working with me.
“But Hermione…” harry said
(flutter of paper as it tore itself up)
Professor glanced back and then lowered his eyes.
He’s hunting post birds.
Handing Harry back the letter
He was holding up tiny onesies…
Also I can't believe you have ‘detention’ with almost all the weasleys you brave thing you….that’s a huge sea of red.
“Exactly…..it’s Rons fault.” Draco said
(See the end of the chapter for
“We have to go catch Harry…” she said
“Magical Transport Dean.  It’s much quicker. Although you may both feel a bit sick when you land.” Draco said
Harry smiled as he read the letter.
“Dear Merlin yes...I mean yes of course how can i be of assistance?” he said
Draco
“What kind of bird is that?” Dean asked
“Harry calm down before you do serious damage to the planet.” hermione said
What the hell….
I may let you see it at some point….granted it’s in a rather sensitive location.
“Are you feeling alright?” he asked
Everyone looked at her like she was crazy...
You always wanted people to see you and not the boy who lived or the great Harry Potter.
“Oh are you the one that did Casa Erotica?'' Hermione asked, sounding intrigued.
Yeah i don't know either
“I wish to cuddle you Mistress.” he said quietly
A Few Days Later - Hogwarts
“Oh Harry i’m so sorry.” she said crying
“Arctic Tern oh how pretty…” hermione said
Because when i get back you’re shagging me for days harry….days!!
He whined when she reached his belt.
/Knocking/
“Alright Harry...get some rest” she said
When she looked up she saw Minerva running and Gabriel following her.
Or sense self preservation...
“I need to understand...i watched detention with Severus yesterday but i feel that i need to go through it myself to truly understand how they both felt. Although i did learn a lot yesterday.” Castiel said
Thanks so much  :)
So i think i may check out Colorado...not sure yet.
I apologize for all the issues I've caused over the years of our acquaintance.
My Luscious Slayer of Dark Overlords ,
Bobby gets an update...
I met this handsome older man...i forget his name
Hermione grabbed the letter and read it.
Draco doesn't like the tropics.
“Did the professor just giggle” a ravenclaw asked
“But it’s still dirty” ron said
I had a wild idea and ran with it...i blame insomnia.
“Hello boys….Why are you here today?” she asked
“But what did she do?” Harry asked
“I”ll go get it Miss that way Neville can stay with Harry.” ginny said getting up
He spent a lot of his time pacing and looking for birds.
Although i am open to that type of thing..
“Nevermind ….sorry.” he said looking down at his plate
I included that one from Louisiana  .
Then this morning I woke up to a rather large snake in the tub.
Hermione these hunters are so hot!! They would benefit from detention with you. Serious daddy issues!!
Crowley looked confused “What the bloody hell is going on here?? What is this damn place? And no i don’t cuddle i’m a demon.” he said
(Harry stop banging your head like that-hermione)
Dean sighs “Gabriel to….and I guess Crowley as well if we just have to.” He said reluctantly
You will find a package attached to this letter.
“I don’t know, dear the lawyer is working on it...hopefully soon.” she said
Dean made a high pitched keening noise
Sam pointed to Draco and nodded
So now i’m in Canada...it’s lovely
(So i’m getting married? - harry)
So i’m just not putting anything at all….Now as to why i’m writing.
“Ron take bites don’t shove the entire thing in your mouth you’ll choke.” hermione said rolling her eyes at him
My Darling Lucious Love Lumps,
I am so relaxed right now….
/Harry glanced at Crowley who was still surrounded but now he was crying/
“Ginny is that a collar?” harry asked
He dropped his head to the table
Love You MWAH
“NO we are not doing that today Ronald...You can’t kidnap post birds.
“Hmm alright ...there’s a good boy” she said
Hermione thought a moment it was good advice.
(What…-harry)
Harry handed over the letter while eating..
Draco cringed outside the room door.
(Harry calm down...good grief - hermione)
She listened closely.
Darling you are stressed the hell out…
Rolonda smiled and walked out of the hall.
Sam looked shocked .
“Neville psst.” Pansy called
Harry is still confused
“I’m going to go back to my room...you know since it’s the weekend i think i may just relax .  Stay in bed except for meals.”He said
School was looming closer and closer with every passing day.
“OK!” Hermione said watching winky giggle as she walked out of the kitchen.
Oh I like it when I arrive and can relax but actually getting somewhere .
“Oh go right ahead ...you know the password.” Minnie replied
It’s done and we’re both ok with it.
My Handsome Snake Charmer,
“Hermione why does Ron need a collar?” harry asked
“Hmmmm Is it for the portrait?” she asked
Draco is still out and about
“Well we were hoping for some quality time with a very special person.” Fred said winking
He may have mentioned that you were upset about being parted from me. {I’m laughing at the wording}
Hermione muttered “Highly bloody unlikely considering your track record.” she huffed
Do you know what I've realized?
Sorry about the birds darling...i tried to use eagles but they wouldn’t go.
“Or some juice pretty bird?” Ginny asked
She huffed a bit at ron’s hopeful expression.
Now I know our Hermione said he’s working through something in her letter.
“Oh good lord!” she said shaking her head
Severus thought for a moment then Rolonda whispered to him.
Trust me…
Hermione walked into the kitchen to see a sight they had sorely been missing.
“Don’t worry you’ll get used to it.  We all have.” Neville said soothingly
Good Luck...
“Yes definitely a win...win scenario.” Fred said
And that Gabriel is supporting him in his search for himself as well as shagging one of the professors. And apparently Crowley is having a crisis, something to do with his mother selling him for 3 pigs when he was human even though he could juggle.” Draco explained
Upside my lawyer thinks he might have it all almost dealt with but it’s going to take a bit more time my love.
Taking the letter she saw it was addressed to Harry
“Oh no sweetie...it’s Ron , Fred , George , Percy and Charlie randomly from Romania. I’m not sure if i can handle another one of you...But i tell you why don’t we have a private detention and we’ll see how it goes?” hermione said patting Ginny on the leg
And they still haven't given the flamingo back.
Well I'm getting into my special sexy Pjs and I'm going to have lovely naughty dreams about you darling.
Send me your wish list !
Harry
This is my very unsubtle way of saying take a nap.
I know it’s been stressful for you too my handsome cuddly teddy bear.
Hermione was sitting quietly in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place just having a cup of tea and contemplating life.
Demon.../she glanced over at the new addition to see her being hugged by the others as she cried her face covered in icing / Oh no not again!!
He was shocked to see who it was from..
Hermione is very popular
I find this all very frustrating darling here I am in my prime baby making years and we’re separated by an ocean. How am i supposed to get knocked up with our sprogs like this.
Hermione read the letter
Bollocks that i wasn’t made for this weather.
One Week Later
/Harry got up and started pacing and ranting about babies and diapers.  Onesies and booties.  Chapped nipples and mood swings./
“Do you think if we ask nicely she’ll take a whip to us?” she asked
As for the fire thing…..yeah be worried darling.
Hermione
After a few minutes Professor Snape was walking out of the hall and he stopped by our table.
“Of Course sir...if you think you’re up to it.  You know at your advanced age.” She said smiling sweetly
“I mean yes Mistress.” Castiel corrected himself
I was too young to understand what i was feeling but i realized what it was as i got older.
/Harry looked over at the other table where the flamingo had made himself at home eating a plate of kippers and drinking pumpkin juice/
I suppose I feel comfortable telling you this cause I'm leaving.
“What the hell is wrong with Dean? What have you idjits done now? And who the hell is the blond guy?  Wait is that a hell hound?” Bobby ranted
“Harry breath….do you want to cuddle with Neville?” she asked
I hope this letter finds you well.
(HARRY- hermione)
Plenty of practice before our sprogs arrive.
“Hey hermione look at these.” harry called
I get stuck in a muggle area with no owl post for a while.
“Yo Bro what the hell? Deans been praying up a storm trying to find you.” the new angel said
“No Missy today i help Master Harry.” dobby said
“Harry do you want Neville to go get your Draco blanket…” hermione asked
The people have been very nice….everyone calls me sweetie and tells me i’m precious.
There was a small bang and a cheer followed by booing.
“Omg Ron don’t feed it that...You’ll make it sick.” she said
“Now i want everyone to remember...I have special detention but afterwards we have study hall for N.E.W.T.S
“Shut up Ronald!!” Hermione said
“Did he growl at you??” Dean asked
Deans Freaking out
I thought I'd swing through Salam just to show you some respect for our fallen sisters.
“Why hasn’t he written??” harry said banging his head on the table
I must dash. I need to check on the boys .
“Ronald Bilius Weasley I said no ! Now give the flamingo back !! And stop feeding the heron donuts.” hermione said
“Neville you and Harry both need to eat.” she said
But from the top it was gorgeous….won’t be coming back now that i know it’s a void.
He spent all these years loving him and now he knows he loves him back.
And her eyebrow raised glaring at him.
“Ok wait i thought this was like a school….school….i’m confused” gabriel said
“Sounds like a great idea Harry….Ron where’s the flamingo?” hermione asked
Hermione smiled “While I appreciate the offer something tells me i won’t need to bust any heads. But thank you just the same.” she said
Potter
“Hmmmm flamingo /glancing at the other table/ legal action...oh bother
Back To Harry….
Severus almost ran to throw himself into her lap.
Two Weeks….
So i'm going to be dealing with certain stories on certain days starting this week.
On the Ron front ya’ know just let him play….not with explosives mind.
(Castiel  Draco said hermione could explain the pizza man-harry)
“Oh Harry i’m sure you’ll get something soon..” Hermione said
I mean that works for boys or girls and it still shows respect for Slytherin.
“Oh the hot blond hanging around with the moose and squirrel. I’ll have to thank him personally.” he said winking
Hermione stopped then turned to the front table
“Mr. Angel sir” Ron called
However I wish you lots of luck in your endeavor.
You need to get laid...and now from the sounds of it.
And Snape is in over his head with Hermione.
It had been two weeks since Malfoys letter admitting he loved him.
Merlins balls Potter the effect you have on people….
“What the HELL!” meg yelled
“Yes Missy.” Winky said heading out
Minerva isn't day drinking anymore
It’s best to just roll with it.
It’s heaven...the only thing that would make this better is if you were here to pound me into the mattress until I passed out.
“Oh those pj’s sound cute….reindeers that don’t fly, how sad….awww bless baby clothes….the sprogs will be adorable...huh never knew that about a moose….oh the nursery will be lovely …..oh definitely making a list for that store...more lube , new whip….” she muttered
Harry was getting used to waiting for letters.
Still a bit upset about that darling, it was so cute and cuddly.
“Minerva do you think Severus would give me detention?” Madam Hooch asked
I swear to god I will send you a howler Harry James Potter!
(That’s nice Harry...i’ll be an awesome Auntie-hermione)
I wasn’t aware of how many deadly things they had in Texas.
“You’re a very messy bird..do you know that? Stop eating my hair. “ Ron said while having a conversation with the bird.
Professor Snape got up and strode out of the hall pausing at the table Hermione was at.
Beware of the buzzards they bite...
Snape is scaring the kids
Sam closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose
Draco
“He may….i hope he does Harry.” Hermione said hugging Harry
…..--POOF--.....
Oh well i’ll decide later.
BEHAVE POTTER!!
“Yes” harry said
What to do???
“My letter!!” harry said jumping up
We need a flying carpet darling…..
Seveus could feel his eye twitch
“I’m here if you need me Minnie.” hermione said as she passed her
Take care of yourself Potter..
Just stuff it in your trunk for me dear.
Hermione couldn’t help but wonder how much trouble Ron would get into if she went back and took a nap herself.
Harry looked up at the tapping noise and saw an owl at the window.
(Of Course you were...i bet you were an adorable sprog-ginny)
“Of course you do dear….alright just be safe .” she told the elf
“But there’s just Ron” ginny said
“I’m supporting his desire to find himself , oh and shagging Minnie while I do it.” Gabriel said
So make sure you eat right and get plenty of rest.
Mind you not as profound as the thought of your cock but still.
Did you know that angels did porn?? I kid you not...one of Castiel's brothers did porn...Casa Erotica
(You can have it back in a minute Harry- hermione)
Well I can't ever go back to Louisiana .  There was a voodoo thing involved.
I’m running out of space darling so i’m sending some of the baby stuff to you.
“Yeah and it’s actually kind of nice.” Harry said sounding a bit surprised
“Mails here…” someone called out
“Hush Harry” she said
Apparently deciding to do as Draco asked and watch after their friend.
I TRUSTED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HIM…. DO BETTER!!
“Miss Granger i was wondering….well might i have detention?” Madam Hooch asked
(Good Boy Neville-Hermione)
What is going on with you?
(Awesome! - harry)
Just feel you one time...just once.
“Oh all right but only if he wants to .   No force feeding.” she said
Hermione thought for a minute.
“Neville please take care of the bird. Ron we’re going...now!” she said
“A jumper, it's cold here….Mrs. Weasley made it for me.” He said
There’s also still a post bird strike because of Ron and he still hasn’t returned the flamingo.” Draco said sitting down at the table
Who knew that the bookworm would turn into what she is today.
In the background she could see a flamingo walking down another table randomly eating things as it went.
If it wasn’t for the fact that i can’t afford to lose everything to the damn Ministry i’d already be back there getting you in line.
So he’d stand by him no matter what.
“I swear Ronald I'm becoming very concerned with your bird obsession.” hermione said
“Mails here” Someone called
Be nice to the bird he was conflicted about the trip.  Apparently Ron’s getting a bad reputation with post birds.
I was very lucky that Meg was willing to bring this letter to you.
Oh Bother they’ve hijacked the demon now as well….
Harry made a whining noise
Just saying...
“What the hell is a sprog?” dean asked looking at Sam
…..-----flash---....
Seriously if i wasn’t so in love with you i’d strangle you…
With a ban of a minimum of 10 years mandatory.
Sorry I haven't updated before now.
Everything was pretty quiet at Hogwarts.
Harry opened his letter
There’s also lots of mermaids in the waters here.
What on earth has been going on there since I left??
Dean gets a breakdown
So FYI if the M.O.M. contacts you that’s why.
I woke up the other day and found a scorpion just wandering around the room.  So I freaked out and set the rug on fire while trying to vanish it.
“If that’s ok with you Mistress?” Castiel asked quietly
“But that’s going to take so long.” Harry said not picking his head up
“Hmmmm Ron, do you want a purple collar?” she asked of randomly
/reaching over to pat his hand/
Including a jackhammer…
I was a bit concerned because hello wizard.
And did she care???
So I peacocked and tried to make myself look fancy.
But there was no chance of getting Ron away from that damned painting.
Harry slowly opened the howler
Harry went back to reading his letter
But i am happy to be leaving….Be nice to the bird he’s a bit clumsy.
Hermione was to busy unwrapping her tall dark and broody stress cure.
Love you darling
“There’s a good girl.” hermione said squeezing the back of ginny’s neck lightly
I went off on a tangent
Sam is kind of coping...
“Well you know the painting of Sirius’s mum?” he asked
There is a North Pole Alaska darling.
“Proper way to respond to me is??” hermione asked
“Oh yes….we both know you’ve been bad so i won’t bother to ask.” hermione replied
Gasps and surprised noises started…
Oh I couldn't get a post bird to bring my letter apparently they’re on strike because of Ron.
(Are you sure he’s ok Hermione-Neville)
“Oh yes Mistress very naughty…” Rolonda said smiling
“Sneaky git Malfoy!! “ she said quietly
“Huh didn’t know that about eagles…” she said
AND IF I FIND OUT WHO TOLD YOU MY LAWYERS NAME I’LL CHOP THEM UP AND USE THEM FOR POTIONS
“Hermione i think i’m going to go take a nap in my Draco blanket” harry said
What the hell is wrong with you?
Unsure of what to do Meg took the cookie and started to eat the plate of food that was put in front of her.
Granger please stop letting Ron feed the birds. I've been getting letters about it.  What in Merlin's name did he feed the booby??
“I am an angel of the lord.” the man in the trench coat replied
“Awww Bless!” said everyone in the great hall all at once
“Come along time for class….” she said primly getting up from the table
“Darling…..yeah.” Sam said
“We’re demons, we don't get cold.” Meg said
Dean just looked confused.
Mail time…
I hope everyone likes it so far.
“Port Key??” Dean asked
Draco misses Harry...
You need more than an extra pair of hands darling.
Also maybe don’t let Ron around the birds anymore..
“Oh those are buzzards Neville...Don’t get your hands close to them.” Hermione said
Apparently he’s Dean's pet angel i think...but they have a strange relationship so i’m not really sure.
“Ummm not to change the subject but where is the puppy?” Sam asked
Remember you’re in charge!
Dean isn't doing well without his angel...
Dean ...mental...coming to scotland….oh dear
Draco and the puppy just watch the chaos
Dear Lovely Bane Of My Existence ,
Draco writes back to Hermione
Harry had been true to his word he’d been staying out of trouble.
Can you believe that darling...Draco Malfoy had to use muggle means to do something.
The leprechauns had formed the words "HA HA HA" in the air. This upset the Veela who got up and started to dance again. Harry put his fingers in his ears to avoid being put under their spell but not even seconds later Hermione was yanking one back out.
"Don't worry, I'll be back in a couple months." He responded before shoving his mouth full of biscuit. Hermione shuffled into the kitchen looking tired but fully dressed and ready to go. Kreacher served her up a plate.
Harry looked down the table to Ginny. She was staring sadly at Hermione. Maybe she wanted to be the one cuddled up to Harry. Though it seemed intimate Harry, Ron and Hermione were just close friends. He could understand why it may seem differently. They had all grown up isolated and now that they had found total acceptance in one another, the three were close.
"Oi, you two, come on. We've got something fun planned." Seamus said quietly from the landing just below. Harry looked around. Not many were paying attention. He and Ron could sneak away unnoticed if they took their chance.
"All jokes aside, I want us packed up in 20 minutes. There will be enough mess to clean up without us being in the way. We leave tonight via emergency portkey. We'll be heading to Sirius' house. Molly is waiting there. Mr. Kingsley and Lupin will be accompanying us." Arthur ordered. He seemed way more tense than normal.
of the Ministry is going to be there." She said excitedly. Ron looked at her incredulously.
"Those were Death Eaters, no doubt. What they were doing, I have no idea. Did you see those people floating in the air? That was the muggle at the check-in gate and his family. The one who handed us maps and sun visors." Seamus explained. He trailed off not knowing what else to say. Harry reached in his pocket to grab his wand, something he had been doing for comfort since he had been thrust into this magical world, but it wasn't there. He started to pat all his pockets but couldn't find it.
School this year would be so different. Harry wondered what else was in store for them. Voldemort had already tried to ruin the Quidditch cup for him. He could only imagine what plans he was concocting now.
"Scared you'll fall in love Potter?" He asked snarkily. A few students oohed behind him. Harry would rather punch Draco in the face at this moment then spend any alone time in the closet with him. He looked to his fellow Gryffindors who had all fallen silent. They were waiting for his next move. If he wasn't careful he had a feeling that the tension between the two houses might erupt into a fight.
"I think I ought to take you kids back to camp." Sirius suggested seeing the looks that all the witches and wizards had given them. Amos Diggory held up the wand in Winky's hand studying it more closely. Harry recognized it instantly as his own.
"Hey Neville," Hermione sighed.
"Probably nothing to worry about. Every time the cup is held there are threats from some organization or another. The Ministry has a department dedicated to it." Sirius explained vaguely. Hermione nodded but Harry could tell she was still deep in thought. Just then voices started to carry from the trail they had just come down. A pair of ginger heads rounded the bend. Suddenly, the twins were in full sight racing towards them and laughing. Behind them another pair of boys, much older than the twins appeared. He recognized one of them as Charlie and assumed the other must be Bill  Ginny was walking alongside her dad in the back laughing at whatever the twins had just done.
in the middle of things." He joked. Harry chuckled. He couldn't deny that his Godfather was right. Ever since Harry had found out he was a wizard, it seemed the magical world had it out for him. Harry finished writing and looked out the window. The dream slipped from his mind, every detail except a cold high pitched laugh. He wondered if he'd ever be able to move on with his life or if he would always have nightmares like this.
"Harry Potter! Who is the best legal guardian you know?!" A loud boisterous voice yelled from down in the living room. The front door slammed closed and Harry smiled. Sirius had come home with a surprise. He jumped off his bed and raced down the three flights of stairs between his room and the main level, almost running over Kreacher in the process. The small house elf was carrying a stack of freshly cleaned laundry for Sirius that blocked his face from sight. Harry darted to the left to avoid him.
This time Draco closed the distance between their lips. He leaned into Harry, pushing him against the barrels that stood behind him. Draco's hands tangled in his hair and yanked his head back.
The same lusty feeling overcame him again and he lost what little control was holding him back. His hands shot up and pulled Draco in close. He gripped tightly onto his hips and kissed him hungrily. He felt Draco's hands come up and touch his chest. He was kissing him back with the same intensity, catching Harry by surprise. He grabbed the front of Harry's robes in his fists like maybe he was trying to break away. Harry thought maybe he had made a mistake. Draco hated him after all. When he felt the other boy's hands shove against his chest he pulled back. Harry snapped his eyes open and saw his look of confusion was matched on Draco's face.
"That's where you're wrong, young man." A cold voice said coming from his left. Harry looked up to see Lucious Malfoy curling his lip in disgust. A woman with a similar facial expression stood next to him. She put a hand on Draco's shoulder and pulled him to stand in front of her. She held her face as if something awful smelling had entered the area and she wouldn't take her disgusted gaze off of Hermione. Harry stepped to the side, moving in front of his friend in the process. The whole dreadful family was decked out in black robes, not a festive bone in their bodies.
"Are you okay my sweet?" He asked as he picked her up. He stared up the stairs looking around for whatever had startled the poor cat. Mrs. Norris purred as Filch stroked and comforted her.
" Ow, what the-" Harry snapped.
"Damn them!" He shouted before Disapparating in the night. The pop scared Ginny who jumped closer to Harry. Their arms brushed against each other.
"He did say number 6 right?" Ron asked. Harry nodded. Hermione whipped out her wand with an eye roll.
"Good idea. Let's meet back at the last lantern on the path." Hermione responded. Harry, Ron and Hermione went farther into the forest continuing to where the group had encountered Ludo Bagman.
The fans were quiet as it started to sink in that the game was over and a winner was apparent. A sound like a jumbo jet started up as the Ireland supporters got more and more rowdy.
"Hey, earlier Sirius mentioned we would need new dress robes for school, any idea what that's about?" He asked. The others shook their heads. Harry hoped that this school year would just be normal but it already seemed like there would be a twist.
"I want you boys to look out for each other this year. Be safe and don't do anything stupid." Sirius warned as he collected the empty plates to put in the sink. Harry felt a twinge of nervousness. There had been enough bad omens before the school year had even started. Sirius pulled him in for another hug.
"I'm going to get a few snacks for later tonight from the Trolley, do you want anything?" Harry asked. Hermione had her nose in a book and shook her head without even looking up. Ron had been nodding off. He unstuck his face from the window and shook his head.
"Ginny? Harry? That you??" They heard a voice call. Harry dropped Ginny's hand at the sound of his best friend's voice. She looked at him confused but instead of explaining he ran in the direction of Ron's voice. Ginny followed. He broke through the edge of the forest and onto the path. His friends all stood together, pale and shaking.
"Well we've got to find it. What if someone looks at the last spell you cast." Dean said getting up from the tree. A rustling noise started from their right. The group turned and those who had wands raised them. Ginny still had her wand lit up from before. She raised it a little higher.
"Don't worry I got him back, punched him in the stomach a few times." He added. Ron smiled and clapped a hand on his shoulder. He just hoped that Draco didn't tell a different story in the morning. Ron would be furious. The boys got up and continued to their dorm. When Ron opened the door, the others cheered.
"And that boys, is why you should never ho for looks alone!" Arthur shouted over the chaos. The rest of the group erupted into laughter but Harry's eyes were glued to the chaos below. Ministry wizards had spilled onto the field, attempting to separate the leprechauns and veela with almost no success.
They ran through easily and immediately spotted the Weasley family. Ginny saw him and quickly turned to her parents to say goodbye. Then she disappeared onto the train. Harry felt a twinge of sadness but still joined the rest of the Weasley's on the platform.
"Show that 'nasty git' some respect, he made the food you're so hastily and rudely shoving in your mouth." She snapped. Fred and George both opened their mouths mid chew and stuck out their tongues. Bits of gravy fell out onto their plates.
Harry dropped Draco's other wrist suddenly feeling uncomfortable with himself for scaring the other boy. Silence fell between them. Neither were sure what to say. Both were drunk and questioning their sense of self. Harry sighed and leaned back against the barrels again. He rubbed his fingers across the stinging mark on his cheek.
"Dinner is ready in the dining room, masters." He said with a bow.
"Honestly Hermione, why do you bother? He's a nasty git." Fred said chuckling. George joined in. They grabbed plates from the counter. Ron came in after them and got two plates for himself.
Harry looked to his right, down the steps again and noticed a pair of familiar heads bobbing up to them. Harry nudged Ron and pointed. Ron grinned.
"What do you mean? What are you doing?" He snapped back.
"Goodnight." He said starting down the hallway with his owl in tow. He opened his door and shook Hedwig off his arm. She flew to her perch with another angry squawk. He opened the window so she could fly in and out as she pleased as it was still nighttime. Harry closed his door and climbed under his thick blankets. The Dursley's crossed his mind as he lay in the darkness trying to go to sleep. He wondered if they missed him or if they just missed having someone to yell at or if they were perfectly happy now that their nephew was gone. How strange it was that the people who had raised him up until age 12 now wanted no contact with him. Not that he wanted that. He could only imagine how awful it would be to invite the Dursley's over for a holiday. They would laugh and probably throw his invitation in the trash. Or worse, they'd show up and ridicule everyone, Harry included. The young wizard fell asleep with visions of pigs dressed in a similar fashion to his cousin.
"Let's get this over with." Harry sighed, standing up and crossing the room. Draco bounced up and followed him. The boy at the door was too stunned to move so Draco shut the door behind the both of them. He seemed almost too enthusiastic about the situation. Why did he seem excited? Harry looked around the room, trying to find anything more interesting than the Slytherin behind him. Now that he was in such tight quarters the feeling of dread had been replaced with something else, an attraction that he had not paid any attention to before now. Harry had felt the same thing the night Ginny had come into his room. Though this time he found it was much harder to stifle his feelings.
Harry didn't bring much for their one night stay. He had barely unpacked too. Gathering his belongings took about five minutes. Once he was done he was directed to wait outside with Kingsley. One by one the other's joined him. Charlie and Bill got the tents put away when everyone was out. They were set. All of them ready to leave the Quidditch World Cup.
"I'll need to call Molly. She'll have heard about it by now." Arthur said solemnly. Sirius nodded. His expression had turned from one of anger to sadness. All of them shuffled into the boys tent and sat down at the picnic table. Sirius put a teapot on the stove. Then he sat down next to Harry.
"See something interesting, Potter?" Draco drawled behind him. Harry finally turned around to face him. He was leaning against the door, probably trying to put as much distance between them as he could. Harry couldn't help but stare at his lips. They were so pink compared to his pale skin. He couldn't tell if it was his state of drunkenness or how attractive Draco looked in this lighting but his face was suddenly feeling quite hot. Draco raised an eyebrow, questioning the silence that had fallen. Harry was sure he was expecting some witty reply but his brain was on a completely different track.
"There was an old man... and he was eavesdropping. They were in a big mansion. Voldemort, Wormtail and another man were talking... About the Cup. They were saying something bad was going to happen at the Quidditch World Cup. They mentioned a woman too from the Ministry. They said she was dead. Then they killed the old man too." Harry explained as he wrote. He tried to remember what the man looked like but nothing significant came to mind. He remembered brown hair, a long flicking tongue like a snake. He wrote that down too.
"Well now that everyone is here shall we start the games?" Pansy suggested. Harry hadn't noticed she was sitting next to Draco, fawning over him. A spike of jealousy shot through Harry. He looked away from the two. Now that he was a bit tipsy the feelings had only intensified.
"Let's find you lot a compartment?" Charlie suggested. He lifted Ron's trunk and they went in search. Luckily they had been standing pretty close to an empty one. Bill helped Harry and Charlie get the trunks in. When they finished, Sirius had just walked through the barrier. Harry waved to him. He crossed the platform and hugged Harry tight.
Hello
She watched ginny skip out of the hall
They all stopped and turned to her.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked
Kept muttering through the flew about grandbabies.
(here birdy-ron)
“Good Boy” hermione said
I started not to send this.  Oh hell who am I kidding I started not to write it at all.
Thank You darling
We need to get a dog darling….a cute little crup maybe.
“Anything at all...I know it’s a long trip...Come sit down and eat something “ Cas said wrapping his arm around her waist and showing her to a seat
She walked over and let the bird in.
Ron was bound and determined to get Walburga off the wall.
“I’ll be good.” he said
“Too bloody right there isn’t.” hermione said
“What does he mean he won’t call you Mistress.?” harry asked
“He loves me . He still loves me.” Harry said holding the letter out to Hermione
“Do you need to talk dear? I’m here for you…..” hermione said
“Have a cookie Demon birdy.” Ron said, holding up a plate of cookies.
“A cookie??” Cas replied confused
Suddenly there was another pop.
I apologize for nothing....NOTHING!!!
“He’s mad at me” harry said smiling
Neither did i…
Go to the tropics Draco it’ll be fun.
Gabriel did a little salute before sitting down and wrapping his arm around Minnie again.
She tried to start the letter but was unsure of how to do it best.
“Explain...now!” he said pouring a hefty amount into the glass
Just to clarify....These are just for fun.
“I need a drink.” Minerva said
“Exactly...which is why we won’t tell you.  Once you graduate then we’ll tell you. I’ll even help you with port keys and such.” she said
"How long until they're here, you think?" Harry asked. Sirius looked at his watch and then at the sun.
"G'night then." Ron yawned. He disappeared into his room as well. It was just Ginny and Harry left in the hallway.
He reached the staff table and started to speak with Dumbledore. It was obvious from the expression on the other teachers faces that they were rather unhappy with his late presence. The man took the seat that was usually reserved for the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
"Thanks guys." Neville said. He continued to huff and puff as they went up the stairs.
"Like I'd tell you. It's a surprise and it'll stay that way." He explained. Harry opened the curtain to his cheeky grin.
The man started to walk and with every step a loud clunk echoed through the Hall. Harry wondered if the event Dumbledore had been mentioning was pirate themed. This man looked like he had come straight from the novel
His door opened and closed again quickly startling him and Hedwig both. The light was still off but Harry could already tell who was standing at his door.
"C'mon we're going to go back to camp and pack up. We leave tonight." Sirius said quietly. Everyone followed his lead silently. None of them had reason to argue. The sooner Harry was back home, the better. The campsite was wrecked. It looked like no tent had been left unturned. Green flames were still eating away at the roof of the boy's tent. Charlie and Bill were already there casting spells to repair as much of the tents as they could.
"This is my room down at the end." Harry pointed. They followed him to the room which had been decorated in forest tones, various browns and greens. His Firebolt hung up on the wall and a grand perch stood in the corner where Hedwig slept. It was made up of fake branches twisted and tangled together to form a large tree that spanned from floor to ceiling. A large hole in the center supported a nest of twigs and leaves which Hedwig was resting peacefully.
"In it's stead, we will be hosting an exciting event starting in October. It will keep our staff very busy and I'm sure all of you students as well. I'm excited to announce that this year at Hogwarts--" Dumbledore was suddenly interrupted. The doors of the Great Hall slammed open and hit the walls with a loud bang. A flash of lightning spread across the ceiling adding to the dramatic entrance.
"Well we heard the blasts and I thought it was just fireworks when I turned around but then the blasts continued. That's all I know. Sirius and Kingsley went to look for you at the tent. The rest went to help the muggles suspended above the death eaters. Two of them were kids." She said. It wasn't much more information then they already had but it was something.
"That's so cool." He replied. Charlie flashed a smile and started to introduce himself to Sirius.
"No, just Lynch!" Ron yelled back. Just as he predicted Lynch crashed into the ground and was surrounded by a horde of angry veela.
"Tell me, when have you known a Gryffindor to miss a party? Of course we're in." He responded. Seamus cheered and high fived him. The Hufflepuff boy quickly went back to his table so as not to attract attention from teachers. House fraternization wasn't discouraged but it was a bit suspicious.
"He's just a boy." Arthur snapped.
Mcgonagall placed down the three legged stool. Then she set down the old sorting hat. The tear in the brim that seemed to serve as a mouth opened wide and sang it's song.
"We bet Krum gets the snitch but Ireland wins." He responded. The other twin overheard and started to cheer loudly. Then the both of them disappeared up the stairs whooping and hollering along the way.
"Firstly, our caretaker, Mr. Filch has asked me to tell you that the list of forbidden objects has been extended this year. Please refrain from bringing and using Screaming yo-yo's, fanged frisbees, and ever bashing boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty seven items I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch's office, if anyone should wish to read it." Dumbledore let slip a grin as he said the last sentence. Everyone disposed the castle caretaker just as much as he did them and the only students with enough courage to go into his office voluntarily were the Weasley twins. Dumbledore continued his speech.
"...Father considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts. He knows the headmaster and all. They don't accept all that mudblood riffraff there. Mother had a fit though. She couldn't stand the idea of me being so far away. Father says they're so much more sensible in their teaching of the Dark Arts." Malfoy rambled on. Harry doubted Crabbe and Goyle were even listening. Hermione got up, tiptoed to the door and slid the compartment door closed, blocking out Malfoy's voice.
"You've handled so much already, I know you can face whatever this school year throws at you." He assured Harry. Harry didn't say anything back but Sirius was used to the silence. Often times Harry didn't know how to articulate his words into feelings. Sirius had been trying to break the habit all summer by encouraging him to talk more, about whatever he fancied.
The last week Harry spent a lot of time with Sirius. He hadn't realized how attached he'd grown. Now leaving for School felt more melancholy, less like an escape and more like an exciting trip.
The fact that they're bold enough to pull a stunt like this, is frightening. Conjuring a dark mark is now considered a war crime. It was all planned out just like Voldemort's back then. A vicious attack and then a dark mark symbolizing where it happened. They had the numbers to pull it off too. This wasn't just a couple of kids in masks. I think this was planned by him to scare people or remind them that he's still out there." Sirius explained.
"I've spent all summer reading up on Quidditch history. Britain hasn't hosted the world cup in thirty years! It'll be so cool to be a part of this historical match." She said excitedly.
"Mr. Bagman, all due respect it's safer here than back at camp, what with all the death eaters marching about." Seamus snapped back. The young boy didn't take kindly to being yelled at even at school.
"Sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop. Hedwig flew in my window and landed on my bed. I figured you'd want her in your room." She explained. Harry smiled.
He looked toward the campsite as the fireworks went off in the air above him. He was supposed to be running but he couldn't take his gaze away from the camp.
"Yes but it's a horrible place. They put a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts and it's run by a former Death Eater. Explains why Malfoy is so close to him." She explained.
"That dragon you gifted me, he's a feisty one." He explained holding a thumbs up. Harry stared in wonder. Sirius looked over at them curiously. He had never told his Godfather about the incident with the dragon in his first year.
This statement was met with gasps and boos. Harry looked back at Fred and George, his fellow Quidditch teammates. They looked just as upset by the notion. Dumbledore cleared his throat and the Hall silenced once more.
"He's an absolute git." Harry muttered glaring at the door Draco had dissapeared through. The other fourth years in the room burst out laughing. Really, he felt bad but he didn't want his friends knowing what he had just done. He still didn't understand it himself. He walked back to his spot in the circle and sat down. Hermione passed him the bottle of Firewhiskey and he took a gulp before passing it off. A few Slytherin got up and walked out of the room too, glaring daggers at Harry.
She pointed to the dark forest behind them. The shadow was gone before the wizards had even appeared. Mr. Crouch started on her. It didn't seem believable even to Harry.
"I'll warn Dumbledore but I know they won't cancel the cup. We'll just have to double up our security. I know how you kids are when there's any sort of trouble,
"You know nothing about me." He snapped. Then he turned around and flung the door open. Pansy Parkinson was barely able to jump out of it's way in time.
The scoreboard was flashing Bulgaria: 160 Ireland: 170
Harry retreated to his room not wanting to get caught in the hallway by one of the adults. Hedwig let out an affectionate screech when she saw him. The noise made him smile. He crossed the room to her perch and ruffled up the feathers on top of her head. Her quiet hoots told Harry that she was enjoying the attention.
His stomach knotted with worry. How could they blame Sirius for all this. He deserved the night off. He deserved to enjoy being a wizard again. What they did had nothing to do with any of their guardians for the night. It was a harmless prank with poor timing. The worry turned to guilt. He should've just stayed put.
"Thank you Kreacher. I appreciate your service this summer. You've been a great help to me." She started, smiling kindly at him. Kreacher grumbled and dissapeared through a door.
This only added to Mostafa's frustration. He began to jab his finger violently in the air, clearly telling them to get flying again. They crossed their arms and he put the whistle to his lips and gave two short blasts.
Harry had a million questions burning through his mind. Until now, he had never seen Voldemort's mark. He knew almost nothing about death eaters. He remembered his very first conversation with Hagrid. That same feeling of disbelief and confusion had overcome his brain.
"The young master and his guests leave for Hogwarts today. No more cooking and cleaning up after you lot." He responded with a sneer. Harry smiled. Even Kreacher's nasty attitude couldn't stop him today.
"Your dad just kept pestering and flirting with your mum until she said yes really. She was not a big fan of his at first but he wore her down. You have your father's looks but your mother's charm so it shouldn't be nearly as hard. My advice to you, don't do what your dad did. If a girl says no respect that and if you upset her apologize." He explained. Harry bit his lip in thought. As much as he wanted to make a grand gesture of apology, he couldn't risk Ron and his brothers finding out. Losing his friends and getting beaten up by the whole family didn't sound pleasant to Harry. He could always just leave her alone and hope the anger subsided.
"What are you doing, Potter?" He snapped. Harry felt his anger building. Malfoy had returned that kiss even if it was only for a moment.
"How's life, Harry? What are you and Sirius up to?" Hermione asked.
The forest that they were hiking through was dense and beautiful. The light barely shone through the canopy of leaves, casting a greenish light on the tree trunks around them. They saw a few bunnies on their hike, as well as a herd of deer and even a skunk that sent Ron running into the woods for fear of being sprayed. Hermione spotted a few bowtruckles that Ron insisted were only stick bugs. About an hour into their hike Ron started to complain loudly about the amount of walking being done. Harry admitted the hike was starting to wear on him too.
"Harry Potter, privilege to meet you. I'm Bill. I work for a wizarding bank in Egypt otherwise we would've met much sooner I assume. Ron told me all about you when he came to visit last year." He said. Harry raised his eyebrows. It was an impressive title for a man with a ponytail to be holding but Harry felt it gave him character.
"Excessive use of elbows!" He heard Bagman call out. "Penalty to Ireland!"
"Never mind that, which one of you summoned the Dark Mark? Who was it?" yelled a cold, shaky voice. Sirius turned around to stand between his godson and an enraged Mr. Crouch.
Magical teens are still teens!
"Hey, no fair, you two still have a minute left." She cooed.
"Don't push me." He said quietly. Instead of the fear that he expected Harry was met with a different look from Draco. He looked hungry. Once again the Slytherin boy pressed his body against Harry's and kissed him roughly. Harry wrapped his arms around his waist and eagerly returned his kiss. This time they didn't spring apart or try to stop it. Harry let his desire take control.
"If he's taken a physical state, then he knows he's safe and he's growing his power." Sirius whispered. A quiet knock brought them out of their conversation with a start. Hermione was peeking through the door.
"What's got you in such a state?" She asked. Harry climbed onto his seat and dropped the snacks into his trunk.
"What's this? Mostafa is attempting to kick the Bulgarian mascots off the field!" Bagman roared, erupting into laughter. Mostafa was gesturing angrily at the veela and very obviously yelling. They had stopped dancing and were now looking ready to kill the referee. The two Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Volchanov, landed in front of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him.
"Oh, just to warn you kids, there have been a few threats of Death Eater attacks on the Cup so I arranged to have my old friend Kingsley accompany us to the game. He'll be staying in his own tent, in the site right next to ours so he can help me keep an eye on the three of you." Sirius said. Harry knew the only threats were the ones he had dreamed up but he was glad his Godfather was taking them seriously.
Ron's face had become as red as his hair. He led the charge to the car after that, quickly getting over his embarrassment. He was among friends after all. Sirius' car fit all their trunks and pets comfortably. Harry thought maybe because his trunk was also charmed like Mr. Weasley's.
"Wh-what?" She asked wondering why he pulled away. He looked her in the eyes again.
"H-How was your summer?" He blurted out. She smiled sweetly.
Ever since his Godfather had been released from Azkaban something had haunted him, keeping him up at night. He didn't like to talk about it much but the memories he did share were horrific enough to keep
"Well, you're awful chipper." He remarked. Kreacher handed him a heaping plate of biscuits and sausage gravy.
"I want to know what happened. Where did you go and when?" He asked. His voice was quiet.
"Oh, a good one. Though these kids of mine have been driving me crazy. Sirius it's a good thing you took this one for the week because our house has been more than enough chaos." He joked patting Ron on the back.
"This is the Portkey. In about a minute, this thing is gonna take off so I want everyone to hold on tightly to the boot. Don't let go and we should all make it safely. Oh and bend your knees!" Arthur explained to the kids. Everyone started to grab a piece of shoe, whatever they could get a hold of. Then they waited staring with wide-eyed wonder at the magic boot.
"And what are you going to do if I tell everyone?" Harry asked. He saw fear flash through Draco's eyes. He recognized that fear. He was sure he looked the same way before every beating he'd ever received from his Uncle Vernon. Draco freed one of his hands and slapped Harry across the cheek.
"Johnathan pass the firewhiskey this way." Dean called. Harry saw the Hufflepuff that had invited them pass the large glass bottle to his right. He looked as though he had already downed one by himself.
"I know that all of you are probably eager to enter the Tournament and represent Hogwarts. This year, the heads of of the participating schools along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders. Only students of seventeen years of age and older will be allowed to participate in this event." -- Dumbledore raised his voice slightly to talk over the cries and boos of outraged students, such as the Weasley Twins, " This is a measure we feel is necessary to ensure the safety of our students. We feel, even with all the precautions that any student under sixth or seventh year is unlikely to have the skills to handle these difficult tasks. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks the impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion. I beg those of you who are underage, please do not waste your time trying to enter."
"You tell no one about this. I mean it, no one." He hissed. He still had a hand gripping the hair on the back of his head. Harry grabbed his wrists tightly and easily removed them from his head. He was confused about all this too but he hadn't felt the need to threaten the other boy until now.
The day went on much the same. Harry had to talk his Godfather out of buying quite a few expensive items for him. He couldn't see himself using the solid gold collapsible cauldrons, at least not without catching some critic from Snape. He did splurge on some Quidditch gear he could use to decorate his bunk this year including an Irish flag and a miniature figure of Viktor Krum on his broom.
"Mad Eye is claiming another break in Arthur, you've got to get over here. The please-men are just everywhere. He's inconsolable about his rubbish bins. They attacked him, you see." He was shouting. Arthur groaned and looked to Molly and Sirius. They nodded and with a turn and pop, he disappeared. Harry couldn't wait until the day he too could apparate.
Harry looked up at the score board and almost choked on his food out of shock. The Irish had quite a lead and were showing no signs of slowing down. Bulgaria was actually losing. Another cheer burst from the Irish side. Looked like he'd be eating his words tonight.
"You don't have to be so nervous. She likes you too, you know." She explained. Harry didn't want further explanation to that. It would only make him more nervous if she did have a mutual crush. Harry felt the train slow to a stop. Ron lifted his head again and wiped away the drool.
Harry used his binoculars to zoom in on Viktor Krum who was staying still and flying above it all. He was looking for the Golden Snitch. Harry zoomed in on the handle of his broom. Gold letters spelled out the word Firebolt. Harry already felt a pang of guilt for his Nimbus back home. Nothing like the world's fastest racing broom to make you forget about your own. Suddenly Krum shot out of sight and Harry's gut did a flip.
"Where is it?" Ron asked. It was comforting to hear Ron didn't know it all either.
After the game had concluded, they stayed in their booth for awhile celebrating the win. Ludo Bagman had come by to hand over their winnings. The twins won the most and were ecstatic. Even Arthur had to give them props.
"I think it's going to be a new teacher. Someone famous I'd bet." Hermione guessed. Ron rolled his eyes.
Also some Harry/Draco action
"I'm leaving." Draco spat. He stalked out of the dungeon and disappeared. Pansy followed calling after him. Harry's heart was pounding in his chest. He wasn't sure if anyone had guessed what happened.
"Good, good. I went to the cup with my godfather. It was a historic match really. I'll see you around then." He replied quickly scurrying away. When he got to his compartment he quickly slammed the door behind him. The noise spooked Hermione who looked up from her book sternly.
As they went down the path, they passed somber looking fans and families. It felt as if they all had overheard the conversation. Harry kept his eyes down on the path. He could feel everyone staring him down wondering what his role was in all this.
"NO! We just kissed but I don't think she liked it and then I said it was a mistake because she's my best friend's sister and that offended her and now she's mad." Harry snapped. Both Lupin and Sirius burst into laughter.
"Neville, none of us are of age. There's no chance of us being able to enter anyway." Hermione lectured. Neville hung his head but unfortunately, it wasn't in time to see the trip step that he somehow always forgot about. Neville let out a yelp as his leg sank through the empty space. Harry and Ron sighed and pulled him up by the armpits. He smoothed his robe and attempted to catch his breath.
in unison. There were intense flashes of light and the air above him rippled as spells soared across the clearing. He could feel his and his friend's hair whipping around. Sparks singed the back of his neck.
"Good morning! Bagels are waiting on top of the stove. Eat quickly and then get packed up. We have to get going soon if we want to make it to the Portkey on time." Sirius called out. Harry looked toward the Stove to see him spreading cream cheese on a bagel of his own. He and Ron rushed over and split the last of them between each other. Harry sat next to Hermione and leaned her book forward a little bit.
"That's alright, I'll be right there." He responded. He looked back to Sirius as Hermione left. He wanted to talk more about what his Godfather had said but with Hermione waiting it seemed best to end their conversation there.
"If you ever get confused, just let me know Hermione. I'd be happy to explain it to you." Sirius said patting her on the back. Her death glare changed to a small smile. Harry and Ron turned to babbling excitedly about the game, with a few interjections here and there from Hermione. When they had finished breakfast, they all ran upstairs to pack and get ready. A bustle of excitement was coming from their floor as they rushed around. Harry didn't think he had ever showered that fast. All three kids were packed and by the front door in under an hour. Sirius who had just finished putting his own pack in the car was surprised to see them all lined up when he came back inside.
"Look at the referee!" She giggled. Harry looked down to see Mostafa had landed in front of the Veela and was attempting to show them what little muscle he had.
In the doorway stood a wild man. His grey-blonde hair fell down to his shoulders. He leaned to the right and used a large staff to hold up his weight. Another flash of lightning illuminated his griseled face. It was covered in scars but his eyes were the scariest part. One was rather normal though slightly bird-like, brown and beady. The other eye was electric blue. It bulged almost comically and was held in place by a leather strap.
Harry looked around in confusion. The firework had soared out his hand but it hadn't gone off quite yet. Where had the noise come from?
"I'd be really careful how you speak to me Malfoy. Your daddy isn't here to save you and neither are any teachers." Harry growled. He had a new found confidence and his childhood bully wasn't going to stand in his way anymore. Malfoy's eyes flickered for a moment but Harry didn't think it was because of fear.
"Good, really good. So much better than it ever was at Privet Drive. Sirius is an Auror for the Ministry. He loves the job. It was hard at first, since he's been gone so long but he's adjusted to work well. He's dating a muggle right now. She owns the coffee shop down the street. Her name is Alma. She's pretty sweet but she knows nothing about the magic world. We've also been catching up on all the Wizarding World's news and sports since both of us were kind of isolated. The house already came with Kreacher, the house elf, who was foul but he's getting better now. It's been a bit lonely here by myself though. I mostly just spend time in the gym we put in on the second floor." Harry explained. Overall life had been going pretty well for Harry and Sirius.
"That's good." He managed to sputter. Ron passed it back and he took a smaller swig than the first. He held back his cough much easier the second time around though it still burned. He felt warmth spreading throughout his body from head to toe. He felt looser and more confident.
"Oh Harry, THE NIGHT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN!" He yelled.
" Ginny cried, frustrated. The forest lit up around them.
He had an art room down the hall from Harry's bedroom that he spent his restless nights in, creating masterpieces out of the pain he'd lived through. They were dark and creepy paintings but they were beautiful. A few had even been bought by wizards in the Ministry. Dumbledore had also bought a painting he became particularly fond of when he came to put protection spells on the house.
He had been worried that Harry would have a harder time adjusting to a world of magic when he had been deprived of it for so long. Then there was the matter of the Dursley's having inflicted a number of harsh punishments leaving Sirius to deal with the trauma that had come from it. Getting to know Harry was both extremely difficult and extremely rewarding at the same time. He took another sip from his pint and turned back to his conversation.
Though they tried the adults would not budge on the secret events of the school year. They managed to learn that it was a big part of history but that was about it.
" Harry asked with a smirk. She snatched the book away.
"Well, it was in Europe at the time. Ireland vs. Someone. Almost everyone spoke different languages but that's just part of the World Cup's atmosphere anywhere, I think. It was just your dad, Lupin and I. Peter didn't go. Neither did your mum. It was so fun. We got so hammered. And of course our team won. We partied until dawn." Sirius said raising his eyebrows. Harry laughed.
A knock at the front door interrupted their conversation. His friends had arrived. Harry excitedly ran to the front of the house and threw it open. Ron and Hermione stood on the porch, suitcases sitting behind them. They all crashed together into a group hug. Harry had been a bit lonely over the summer while his uncle worked. Seeing his friends again was a bit of a relief. Sirius walked in from the kitchen and greeted the pair of kids at his door.
"He ought to call a time out for the poor young man." Lupin called. Pointing out Krum to Sirius.
"Nice to meet you. That must be an interesting job." Harry remarked. They shook hands and Bill continued to introduce himself to Sirius and Hermione. Charlie wasn't far behind him. His hair was shorter but he had scars marking his arms and a couple on his cheeks.
"Hello again Harry! Staying away from those dragons I hope." He said with a wink. Harry shook his hand too. As he did he noticed a particularly bad bite mark on Charlie's thumb.
"Dad, is this it? It's just a dirty old boot!" Ron yelled from the circle. Laughter could be heard from the group of adults who had just broken over the hill. They pushed their way into the teenagers circle.
"Right! Room, ahem, uh, down here, it's actually right next to mine so if you need anything you can, well I'm only one room away I mean." Harry babbled. Ginny had him feeling flustered now. She smirked and turned around. She walked away with a sway in her step that Harry couldn't help but stare after. He felt hot, confused and slightly nervous. Was this how Ginny always felt?
will be on that council, they think they might have an even easier time of bending the magical side of their country to their own agenda.
They got jobs, most of them in the Ministry itself, but quite a few also in a variety of relevant but unconnected fields, all of them intent on
It’s the first death of a magical at muggle hands within their own borders.
Not that they actually manage to fulfill any of those promises they made, their politicians far too worried about losing voters if they were to be seen to be on the magicals’ side instead of that of their normal citizens, any bills suggested for discussion promptly shot down by those opposing any sort of compromise with the magical side of their country.
In the first couple of weeks after the Uncovering, he has a number of heated arguments about the willful devaluating of entire swaths of what are just normal people for no other reason than due to their lack of magic, not only with friends and colleagues but also in his own home. Then again, he has always found the heated arguments and the just-as-heated reconciliations are one of his favorite parts about his relationship. Lest his life ever get even close to boring.
, the muggles are beyond atrocities such as the witch hunts these days. Surely, such a thing could not possibly repeat itself
To ensure that you have implacable leaders, willing to put the protection of the ordinary citizens above all else, unwavering in their strength and determination to see to everyone’s protection.
So, Magical Britain closes ranks.
It takes them until the very first ‘negotiation’ with their magical counterparts to realize just how wrong they are.
Their thoughts are wonderfully confirmed during the first couple of meetings they have with the magical government, the Minister of Magic easily placated with a couple of platitudes. It gets a little more difficult when some of their country’s normal citizens go to rather shockingly abhorrent lengths in making their disapproval of magic known. Still, they promise to pass laws, promise to punish those acting against magicals and the magical side of the government once more lets itself be placated, a little less willingly but still just as easily made to concede as they’d thought.
And the two creatures they brought along clearly aren’t particularly pacifistic either. Quite to the contrary.
They had steel poured down their spines by the last war. They defeated the most powerful Dark Lord to walk this earth for centuries. They will not bend for anyone, won’t simply bow to anyone’s demands. Not even in the name of peace.
As much as they would have preferred for everything to stay as it was – having to deal with just one wizard, just the Minister of Magic, who clearly knew very little about the normal side of his own country – certainly made their lives much easier where getting the concessions they wanted out of the man was concerned. Still, considering that they themselves have been attending the negotiations with a group of experts, they can’t really say anything against the magicals doing something similar.
There is nothing special about the day the muggles find out about magic.
They are willing to accept that.
. For everyone.
Which must be some sort of mistake. It
Thankfully, Harry at least isn’t entirely alone in feeling mainly caution at the muggles finding out. Once the news of ‘The Uncovering’ – as the magical world quickly comes to call it – reaches them, it doesn’t take long for various people in his life to contact him, pretty much all of them old classmates of his, some of them his life-long friends, but also quite a number of those who used to be his enemies but have long-since become at the very least allies, sometimes even good friends. Or even more than that.
Their goodwill has been used up, too many casualties on their side brushed off by the non-magicals for them to feel responsible for any violence that the muggles themselves have wrought and were happy to watch unfolding just as long as it wasn’t affecting their own ‘kind’.
A consensus about how they got lucky, how they have it comparatively easy where dealing with their magical counterpart is concerned.
Hell, if he were to guess, he'd say it's rather likely that all of his friends have been aware of this mess, likely even kept an eye on things to make sure nothing might go awry, but simply never bothered to inform Harry, knowing that he avoids the Daily Prophet with single-minded determination and would thus never find out on his own.
Well, there have
You can’t just decide that someone is your political leader without at least asking their opinion on the matter.
Harry watches on worriedly, the knowledge that things are going to get much worse before there is any chance of them getting better sitting heavily upon his shoulders.
In the coming weeks, certain groups meet a little more frequently in the sublevels of the Ministry, murmured discussions about preventative measures, securities, assurances, gaining quite a few additional members happy to contribute. Especially, the muggleborns amongst them, those who in addition to Hogwarts also got at least some of the muggle equivalent of an education, are suddenly rather intent on getting their hands on as many muggle books on military structures and weaponry and the likes as they can.
If they have no choice, if they are going to be forced into yet another war no matter their preferences to the contrary, if only to protect the peace they themselves created, then they’ll make sure to wage it
So, maybe it shouldn’t come as such a surprise when they receive a missive ahead of the next round of meetings that Magical Britain has decided to change a few things. As in, they will be replacing the Minister of Magic in the negotiations with a sort of council, a group of wizards and witches and magical
And thanks so much for your wonderful comments and kudos!
any war someone else might dare to confront them with.
The muggle black market for magical goods – mostly for the trade of magical plants and items, but also quite a few magical creatures and even, to everyone’s horror,
Though, even perfect inaction is better than those few countries where, upon discovery of magic, wizards are promptly declared second-class citizens, no repercussions whatsoever for any crimes committed against them, the governments even joining in on ridding themselves of their magical counterparts. Wizards and witches quickly desert those places entirely, even most magical creatures following in their wake, as they find themselves systematically hunted within the borders of their own countries, and thus decide to seek refuge in other places around the world.
The witch the muggle police finds in a laboratory, a muggleborn somewhere in her early twenties, just a few years out of Hogwarts, and quite literally plucked apart by so-called scientists trying to figure out the secret to magic, flayed open like a specimen on their table until even her magic could no longer keep her alive, is proof of that.
But, in the end, only the children survive. After having held out against all odds for fear of what might be done to their children if they were no longer available to perform the magic demanded of them, the parents hold out just long enough to see their children once more safe in wizarding hands. Before giving in, following Death’s soothing call beckoning for them.
It’s reassuring. More than. It makes them confident that, even in case of an actual conflict, their side would still have the upper hand over the magicals.
There are attacks, neighbors pointing fingers at supposed magicals in their neighborhoods, children hazing each other for supposedly being magical or having someone with magic in their family. In the weeks that follow, muggles kill far more of their own in various lynch mobs around the globe than they ever manage to get their hands on a trained witch or wizard.
Magical Britain is furious. At what was done to one of theirs, at the insult to magic itself, at muggles doing what the purebloods had once used as a supposed-to-be-ludicrously-over-the-top propaganda horror scenario of muggles trying to steal their magic.
And they will not let
Which does happen, of course, but it’s rare for anyone with magic to be taken off guard on that level. It does, however, make it even harder for the more diplomatically inclined magical governments to demand recompense from their muggle counterparts for the injustice done to theirs when most of those harmed in those situations are not magical at all.
Because. If muggles can study magic to figure out magical weaknesses? Well, then Harry’s group is perfectly willing to return the favor.
It starts with just that one video.
Random plot bunny be random. And this entire fic is simply an excuse to write some BAMF Harry. 'Cause, why not?
kind of curse-breaker exactly – but everyone knows that he has remained fully entangled with the Ministry’s various issues nonetheless. If only because of his friends and allies from the war very much remaining involved.
They start with small things, like a bill uncharacteristically quickly pushed through the Wizengamot, which sees to the Ministry handing out free, emergency-triggered portkeys to every single witch and wizard within Magical Britain, their own citizens and visitors alike.
beautiful when someone dares ask her about individual battle skills in the context of exchanging notes, and certainly not the wizarding representatives, who, unsettlingly enough, simply do not react at all to any mentions of militaristic prowess – are nearly as intent on avoiding armed conflict as their side had admittedly assumed ahead of this meeting.
It hadn’t even been all that hard.
Would love to know what you think :D
Because, while nothing really changes for magical societies anywhere, all of them of course having always been aware of the non-magical side of the world, the same isn’t true for muggles. And it doesn’t take long for the first more radical factions to form amongst the non-magical portion of their world. Radical, on both sides of the spectrum.
It’s a simple set of wards. But it’s also highly effective.
Harry Potter who apparently does not
On the other side of the spectrum, most muggleborns seem mainly excited for the possibility of their two worlds finally merging, the potential of getting to live in both worlds without having to hide anything about themselves, convinced that Great Britain’s magical and non-magical government will be able and willing to work together to take care of all of their citizens.
There are countries like Russia where the magical world refuses to accept so much as a single trespass against any magical being by their muggle countrymen. Within days of the first attack against magicals on their soil, the fronts within their so vast country have hardened, both sides, magical and muggle, willing to ruthlessly defend the interests of their own. Quite a number of people die on either side in the immediate and brutal conflicts that arise. However, rather counter-intuitively, Russia, a few of its neighbors, and their magical equivalent – the magical version of the Soviet Union never having disbanded like its muggle counterpart and thus incorporating several nations beyond just Russia at once – somehow manage to reach a tenable compromise between both sides much earlier than most other countries, if only because the lines in the metaphorical sand were drawn right from the get-go and the retaliation for any trespassing against said limits is harsh and instant on both sides.
No one on their side entirely knows how to feel about the sudden change. Alas, while their country’s magicals might be subjects of the Crown, they have also always had complete autonomy in how they run their side of the government. So, they simply have no right to interfere.
The point is that the world struggles to find a new balance, something to fit the respective ‘other side’ into their societies.
The point is, when the news of the muggles finding out reached Magical Britain, quite a number of people promptly got in contact with Harry, just to let him know that they’ve taken note of the new development and are available in case something happens that Harry might need a couple of extra sets of hands for.
For a while everything even works out more or less as they had thought it would.
‘Expertise’ which includes things like all the main magical locations within their own country, includes entire treatises about the wizarding population’s general mindset on different things, how they tend to be rather happily ignorant of things, utterly disinterested in learning anything whatsoever about the non-magical side of the world they live in. They also have quite a bit of information on magical beings’ general threat levels, creatures and wizards alike. They have talked to enough muggleborn wizards – most of whom may have decided to leave the wizarding world for various reasons but all of whom did finish their magical education and whose information can thus surely be relied upon – to be certain of having been given a sufficiently complete picture of any wizard’s or magical creature’s offensive capabilities. It is reassuring to know that, in the end, a wizard with a wand isn’t significantly more dangerous than a normal person with a gun, that even magic has its limitation where ultimate effectiveness and applicability is concerned, that magical fights are still a one-on-one sort of thing, not at all like the destructive capabilities of their own military, capable of taking out an entire city with their firepower within a few minutes if need be.
The peace they fought so hard for and lost so much for is barely a few years in the making, not a full decade yet since the Light won and then spent another few years struggling with itself while trying to find a balance between victory and oppression, a balance between Light and Dark for once that would not see either side as
Thus, Great Britain thinks itself safe in that regard, doesn’t worry about having to play to their magical citizens instead of their actual voters. Because, if need be, the
, is what they are told.
Except for the fact that, in the morning the muggles have no idea that magic even exists. And by the evening
The list goes on.
Then there is the vampire, the second magical creature representative, who looks like she might be in her early thirties but none of their research or contacts has been able to come up with the woman’s actual age, and who keeps throwing their own laws, the inherent loopholes and supposed-to-be-inextricable clauses back into their faces whenever they try citing anything in their own favor, all-the-while making references to certain passages in said laws and about the intention with which they were originally written that make it sound like this vampire might have actually
At the forefront of everyone’s mind is of course Harry Potter.
Most countries, of course, fall into neither of those categories, instead caught up in their own red tape and opposing interests of their citizens, looping their way through repetitive arguments, collectively dragging their feet. Like the UK government and its magical counterpart, politicians haggling over details, getting stuck in negotiations that go nowhere.
So, Magical Britain looks at its current Minister and decides that, while decent enough in peace times, they’d much prefer to have someone who has proven themselves willing to fight for Magical Britain as a whole in that position, someone whose motives they do not need question, who will fight for anyone no matter their race, background, or political allegiances.
Their counter offer which is effectively a council of several people, designed to only act during times of conflict, to be mostly useless in peace times but to supersede even the Minister’s office itself, in times of war, only remaining answerable to the Wizengamot itself.
There are also a couple of countries like Malaysia, where the family of the ruling monarchs are apparently first-cousins to the mirroring rulers of their magical government, both sides always having been fully intertwined – even if unofficially – and easily brought even closer now.
there while said laws had been passed the first time around, shadows pulled in close around where she is sitting, a skill they didn’t know vampires even had, the cloud of shrouding darkness around her all the more unsettling for the red eyes glowing amusedly from within.
– that the Aurors unearth in the aftermath is the last straw.
Add to that, the fact that magicals can be easily corralled just by taking their wands away, more or less rendering them incapable of using magic in any directed manner, and the fact that there are rather harsh laws on the side of the magical government against ever using any sort of magic against normal people…
Then again, it’s admittedly reassuring to know that the people around him are aware enough to recognize the potential dangers of their current situation, the fact that, good intentions of their non-magical government or not, ‘public sentiment’ can be a dangerous factor, to know that, while muggles’ knowing about magic in itself might not be something particularly positive or necessarily negative at this point, it’s still definitely something to keep an eye on.
In the aftermath, Harry’s group smoothly steps forward, back into the limelight they have been avoiding since the end of the last war, since they had the choice to live normal lives. They bring with themselves plans and well-thought out contingencies and defenses already preemptively prepared. Because, as much as they may have hoped to be able to keep the peace they fought so hard for, they still saw the writing on the wall, saw what the tensions were building up to.
Even most muggles are aghast at everything that particular investigation turns up, but their sudden sympathy changes nothing at that point.
Then there are countries like Japan, where belief in the supernatural has always been part of normal life, so-called superstition never having been something to be ridiculed, belief systems where the existence of something beyond that which normal people can perceive has always been simply assumed, and thus the ‘revelation’ of magic being part of their world garnering little more than a vague shrug and an agreeing hum and nothing really beyond a few debates on the issue from their citizens. That, however, seems to only apply to their own people, the entirety of Japan turning perfectly isolationist, refusing to permit even a single magical being from anywhere else into their country.
at their own convenience.
deems it necessary.
However, to appease said public opinion of Magical Britain’s general wizarding population, they then also proceed to provide a legislative counteroffer. An offer that is far too well thought-out for Harry to even doubt that his friends have been preparing this for a while.
It snowballs. Far too quickly for the magical governments of the world to get a handle on. By the time they realize the snowballing uncovering of their world to the eyes of the broader non-magical side of the populations, it’s far too late to do anything about it..
They already showed their hand, proved their willingness to stand aside as their muggle citizens wreak havoc upon their country, magical and muggle alike, for fear of losing voters, their priority very much not to uphold the peace or to protect all of their nation’s citizens.
And, beneath their feet, magic herself grows agitated at the threat to her own.
(See the end of the chapter for
They were the ones who fought the war against Voldemort, the ones who paid and sacrificed and had to watch their friends – only children at the time as well – die along the way. They will not let those who were happy enough to let children fight a war, a war pushed upon them by the older generation, now dictate what the world they all want to live in is supposed to look like.
take it from them, be the offender  magical or muggle or another upstart Dark Lord reaching for immortality. They forged this peace with their own blood and magic and sacrifice, and they are fully prepared to go to war in order to defend what they only so recently attained.
Harry stares at the Daily Prophet spread out on the breakfast table in front of him, the headline mocking him.
The Aurors tear into the hideout, horrified at what they find, freeing the family, healers joining to help.
All of the more popular wizarding locations within Britain have already been warded with this exact ward scheme and the goblins are still making the rounds to any private wizarding residences, handsomely compensated by the Ministry to do so ‘free of charge’ for the residents.
It happened naturally, when their generation finally made it out of school, all of them, no matter which side they had been on, so utterly disillusioned by their parents’ way of handling the last conflict between Light and Dark, barely having made it through the war none of them had any part in creating but bled for anyway. And the Ministry, full of people who had no part in the fighting, neither hide nor hair to be seen of them once the going got tough at the height of the war, but who had promptly popped back up in the aftermath, happy to attempt to once more rule Magical Britain as they had before.
Fear and envy, powerful motivators by themselves. And utterly lethal in combination.
Even Harry is somewhat surprised at how far the muggles are willing to go and how quickly they got to that point.
Some countries choose other approaches, like South Africa and Germany, where the respective muggle governments push through sets of legislation within days of ‘The Uncovering’ – apparently preemptively prepared by certain people within their governments in preparation for the day where magic would inevitably be discovered by the general population – and then their law enforcement proceeds to crack down instantly on any violence against magicals just as they would for any crime committed against their non-magical citizens. It’s a good deterrent for most people, though it admittedly does nothing against the more radical factions that promptly form in response. Even more so, in some of the countries that try to follow that particular example, that particular approach ends up leading to political unrest as muggles feel like they might be the ones losing their rights to magicals. Several muggle governments are toppled in sudden revolutions springing up around the globe as a result.
A family in Wales, kept as personal, magical slaves by a group of muggles, by way of threat to their children, a little girl, still a toddler, too young to even be talking yet, and a boy just old enough to understand everything that is happening to his family, to know it’s wrong, but too young to do anything about it. Until the muggles take it too far, and the young boy’s magic explodes outwards from stress at what he is witnessing being done to his parents, in a truly spectacular display of accidental magic that lays waste to an entire city block.
But by that point, Magical Britain has already closed ranks.
Aurors are dispatched, to investigate, to help, to keep any potential frictions from escalating in case any muggles were witness or harmed in the outburst. What they find is not what they expected.
It starts with a massive explosion in Wales, an outburst of accidental magic sending alarms blaring through the Ministry of Magic’s halls.
Hm, maybe that’s another concession they could demand from the magicals in the future during the negotiations… It would certainly be nice if the UK’s government got a say in how the magical side of their country is run…
Magical Britain is beyond fury at that point. And beneath their feet, the ancient magic of Albion herself – primordial and powerful and inescapable – rears up. And clamors for justice.
No, they truly don’t think they have any reason to worry. If only because, war heroes or not, the three wizards and witches they are about to meet across the negotiation table are also still young, inexperienced, couldn’t possibly know how to play the political game. As young as they are, they just won’t have the political experience. At least not where it counts. Not when it comes to going up against politically savvy opponents such as themselves.
The next attack on British soil is aimed at the Leaky Cauldron.
It’s the witch hunts all over again, and no corner of the world remains untouched, muggles so very, desperately afraid of these powers that have always existed alongside them but that they had no idea could ever be real, powers that they still don’t really know anything about, except that it is power they do not understand, are unable to protect themselves from, and will never be able to attain for themselves.
Things are moving forwards! Finally! XD
The muggles know. It’s everyone’s new reality.
, just like most others around him, that his fears of how bad things might get would prove over-the-top, just post-war paranoia once more making itself known. It’s disappointing to find all of his fears confirmed. Then again, he is all the more glad at the knowledge that his group prepared for the worst-case scenario anyway, despite their willingness to hope, to believe in the good of humanity.
The veela cleared to the side of the field angering every male fan in the stadium. Ron slumped down in his seat. Moments later the Irish team mascots started to fly around the stadium. Leprechauns dressed in brilliant green and gold soared in a shamrock formation. Gold rained down from the shamrock showering the fans in galleons. Ron collected huge handfuls into his lap, laughing in disbelief. The leprechauns settled down on the opposite side of the field.
People wandered through the sites, already starting up the festivities. A man in giant stilts walked around throwing little magic candies to kids below him. A fire breather, painted like a dragon, sat on a post and puffed a giant flame straight up in the air as they passed, causing Mr. Weasley to nearly jump out of his skin. From the back of the group Sirius let out a yell.
I know that details don't line up with the book.
"Oh! Arthur, Sirius, I think work is calling." Molly shouted. The both of them rushed to the fireside.
"Okay let's hear your theories." Harry started.
"PEEVE'S, YOU WILL STOP THIS NONSENSE AT ONCE." Professor McGonagall ordered. She had just stormed down the steps and she was angry. Peeve's flew high into the air, blew a raspberry and disappeared through the ceiling. McGonagall whipped out her wand and muttered out a spell. Suddenly everyone in the Entrance Hall was dry and warm. A cheer sounded for their heroine. Then they happily filed into the Great Hall and found their seats.
"We were already in the wood. What happened? How did it start?" Fred asked. Everyone had caught up.
The sorting went by quickly after that. Little Colin Creevey's brother got sorted into Gryffindor as well. Now there would be two of them following Harry around and bothering him. He impatiently awaited the end of the sorting. When the final name was called and the first years finally sorted, Harry and Ron snatched up their forks.
"I'll make dinner, you three can catch up." Sirius said leaving the three friends in the hall.
"Ron you're next door." Sirius explained. He pulled his suitcase into the next room.
The house was peaceful and quiet except for the slow shuffles of the other kids who had just started to get up. Kreacher was singing a pleasant tune when Harry came into the kitchen for breakfast.
"Won't they know we used magic to light them?" Ginny asked.
"Well, let's get going then, shall we?" He asked with a chuckle. They raced outside to Sirius' car, backpacks crashing behind them. Sirius drove a black SUV type that he had gotten from the ministry for work. Harry got in front and shoved his backpack by his feet. Hermione and Ron slid in back. He waved goodbye to his house and to Kreacher who was looking out the window with bitter resentment. Sirius got in on the driver's side, started up the car and they were off.
The group started to climb the steps to where they had their own viewing booth set up. All the adults (Sirius, Charlie, Bill, Arthur, James Diggory, and Kingsley) had pitched in to buy a private party booth. Sirius said it would stop him getting in any fights with annoying fans but Harry was just happy to be away from the chaos of the general public. Yelling could be heard at every landing of the giant staircase they were climbing accompanied by arm waving and the occasional hex.
"Alright, everybody up the hill. Let's go, move it people." Ron shouted as he started to race Harry to the top. Soon all of them were sprinting up the hill, except the adults, and Hermione of course. When they reached the top, the teens were surprised to find nothing but rolling hills for miles. The only item in sight was a dirty, rotting left boot. They all crowded around the boot waiting for the adults to tell them if this was indeed what a portkey looked like.
Their eyes met and Harry smiled and winked hoping his minor flirtation would go to unnoticed. Instead of calming Ginny down, his gesture seemed to have a different effect though. She promptly fell backward off the bench with a loud squeak. Everyone looked at her with wonder.
"Who's there?!" He called again. Hermione gave him a light smack to shut him up.
"Yes, well he's my boy isn't he? I get to decide how honest I am with him." Sirius snapped back. Harry relaxed onto the bench a bit. Harry felt as though his Godfather could easily give him up at anytime. He constantly wondered if the man was looking for a way out. If he was he was doing a good job of hiding it.
"You know you lot have a whole week left, right?" Sirius asked watching them struggle down the steps.
"What the hell? I couldn't find you. Why did you disappear?" He questioned while stroking the back of Harry's head.
"Wait for me! Harry!! " Someone shouted from above. Again Harry's heart dropped. The fun was over. He looked up and saw Ginny running down the stairs. She was alone. He looked farther up and saw that no one had followed her. He was surprised that this many of them had succeeded in sneaking away.
"Who's that?" Sirius called out. Harry pushed the door open a bit and peeked in. Lupin sat in an armchair next to Sirius. Something about the sight was comforting, his two father figures sharing tea after a long day.
to be dead. Especially, if the man can't be killed in the way that a normal wizard can." Sirius said carefully. Harry paused to think about what those words meant. Sirius was right. For some reason, Voldemort was too powerful to be killed by the curse that was blasted back at him when Harry was just a baby. That curse had been cast by the powerful wizard himself. Suddenly a horrible image flashed through Harry's mind of a pale, shriveled, human-like creature. He shuddered at the thought of what must've been Voldemort's new body.
"Who's there?" He called not moving from his spot. He was rooted in fear. The person quickly moved out of sight. Harry stepped backwards until Hermione was able to grab him and hold onto his arm.
"There's Harry! Harry we're placing bets. What'dya say?" Sirius yelled when he saw him. He put an arm around his godson as the boy thought.
"Krum's found the Snitch!" He shouted to everyone. They stopped mid cheer and watched as Krum did a death dive. Dropping hundreds of feet down in a matter of seconds. The other team's seeker noticed and dived too though Harry didn't think he had actually seen it. The two wizards were dropping toward the ground so fast they looked as though they were skydiving.
"Is Durmstrang another wizarding school?" Harry asked. It was crazy how much he still didn't know.
"They'll crash!" Hermione shouted but just as she did, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive, spiraling off to the side. The Irish seeker was not so lucky. He hit the ground with a loud thud.
"I would also like to remind students that the forest on the grounds is out of bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
"Alright kids, it's going to be a bit of a hike. Luckily, we have that extra time so don't worry about making stops along the way if needed. It's got to be hidden so the muggles can't find it." He explained. They all got out of the car and waited as Sirius loaded his own, much bigger pack onto his back. His Godfather helped him adjust the straps on his own pack and then they were off. Harry was so full of energy that the backpack felt weightless and so did he.
About five more rounds of spin the wand passed and everyone in the room had become quite drunk. Even Hermione had taken a couple swigs. She was giggling at everything. A pair of girls had just come out of the closet and Seamus was determined to get a pair of guys next. Harry couldn't tell if he was bi-curious or just joking around. The wand had landed on Ron and a Slytherin boy but both flat out refused and said they'd rather leave. Harry wondered if the wand was going to put him in a similar situation and what he might do.
Harry had just shoved an entire biscuit in his mouth when a Fourth year from Hufflepuff house promptly sat down in front of him. A strange thing to do, considering they barely knew the boy's name.
"I'm excited to meet all the fantastic witches and wizards in attendance. You know,
"What sort of trouble are we getting into tonight boys?" George asked excitedly. Dean opened his coat to reveal a handful of colorful fireworks.
"Oi, I've got someone over here, but, oh blimey." He shouted from the trees. Everyone ran, scared to see who the Ministry wizard had found. When they got there, they saw a house elf laying on the ground. A wand was in it's hand.
"Starting the festivities early I see?" He asked judgmentally checking out the drinks that were sloshing in their hands.
"Master Potter, anything to drink or eat sir?" She asked in the squeekiest voice Harry had ever heard.
"He's not dead, but he's not alive either. He's in this weak shriveled state. I remember seeing it in my dream. He was awful." Harry said quietly. He wrote down the little details that had come back to him on the paper. Sirius looked troubled.
Amos Diggory worked in the Ministry and was particularly welcoming when Sirius returned, unlike some of his other coworkers. This led to a steady friendship that kept he and Harry from losing their minds in the giant house alone.
The morning of September 1st, Harry Potter was awake before the sun had touched the sky. He was ready to go before his Godfather had even cracked his eyes open for the morning. Hermione seemed to be the only person matching his enthusiasm as she was awake before him.
The rest of the fourth years stayed and partied through the night. It was only until a Ravenclaw girl pointed at the clock that they decided to start leaving. They filed out a few groups at a time, some carrying their drunken classmates with them. Johnathan had passed out cold and was woken up just as the last of them were deciding who would leave next. Harry was leading Ron and Hermione out to the dark hall.
Below the green glow there was a group, marching menacingly through the camp. They blasted tents and people alike out of their way. Shooting green flames from their wands as they went. Black cloaks and evil masks hid their identity from the crowd. Witches and wizards were running across the field, attempting to escape.
"Everyone at the Ministry calls him Mad-Eye Moody. He's looking right at you." Ron whispered. Harry elbowed him in response. Harry looked down at the table breaking the intense eye contact between the two. He wanted to vomit. Something about the stare made him uneasy.
"I'll accompany you." Arthur responded. He put an arm around Ron and Hermione and gently pushed them in the direction of the camp. His entire head was a shade of red that Harry thought probably wasn't healthy. He looked up at his own guardian and realized Sirius was just as angry. He wasn't red in the face but a wrinkle had appeared above his brow that Harry was concerned might now be permanent. They were silent as they marched back to camp.
Draco pulled away again, snapping Harry back to reality. This was the boy who had called one of his best friend's a mudblood. This was the boy who regularly insulted his other best friend's family. This boy believed in the superiority of purebloods. He felt disgusted with himself and with Draco too.
"Looks like I'll be accompanying you lot to Diagon Alley then." Molly sang out. Fred and George groaned which earned them an enchanted smack from the wooden spoon serving their breakfast.
"I guess we'll see you lot around." He called with a nod. He was careful to make eye contact with everyone in the group. The message was clear but he had to remind them. Seamus stopped too and waved.
"Thanks Kreacher, we'll be down in a minute." Harry responded. Kreacher shuffled out and disappeared, the way he often did which was very suddenly and without explanation. They all stood up and followed him out. Ron and Harry raced down the stairs while Hermione trailed behind admiring the house as she descended. They went to the dining room and sat down at the table with Sirius.
"Harry?" She asked, sounding even more nervous than before. He snapped his eyes up to hers. He was having a hard time remembering anything. Her question swam back into focus.
"Now, Arthur and I got our tent sites all arranged so they're next to each other. We're going to have a tent for the adults, the kids and one for the girls, Hermione and Ginny, and of course Hermione is coming. I bought her ticket and I already talked to her parents. She's on her way over here, now! Ron is too.They're going to stay the week. We'll be meeting the rest of the Weasley's and the Diggary's as well, I believe, Monday morning to catch the Portkey to the stadium. This is it, Harry, your first world cup!!" Sirius excitedly recited the plan. He went to the kitchen and broke out the butter beer. Harry took a mug and sat down in the newly renovated kitchen. They had painted it a light sandy color and put in white cabinets and counter tops. Six wood stools stood around half the kitchen island. Sirius had been working hard to lighten up the originally Gothic house. They'd even gone so far as to knock down a couple walls. All while Kreacher grumbled the whole time.
He was so excited for school that he packed his trunk as soon as he got home along with Ron and Hermione. They brought them downstairs to set them next to the door.
"I've lost my wand!" He exclaimed looking back in the direction he and Ginny had come from. Everyone looked at him. They needed a distraction from their thoughts.
"Ginny?" He asked.
"Harry! Couldn't sleep?" He asked looking at Harry with a bit of concern. Harry shook his head and sat in the armchair next to Sirius'. There were no clouds in the night sky, giving the both of them a perfect view of the stars and moon.
"I-I know I heard something. Is one of you ghosts messing with me?" Mr. Filch muttered. He stepped forward a few more steps. His lantern swung towards them, stopping inches in front of Harry's face. Harry grabbed Ron and Hermione's arms and did a slow side step towards the wall. The group quietly shuffled out of the way. Filch grunted and started down the hall again. They watched his lantern sway away.
Time jump to Monday, the day of the Quidditch World Cup.
"So this is the new house, aye Harry?" Ron commented looking around. They were standing in the living room which had been decorated in warm colors.
"Right, thank you Winky and that he is." He said in response. The house elf beamed and bowed herself out of the room. Hermione gazed after her.
"Which room is, uh?" She trailed off turning away from his intense gaze.
"Guys, hey, Harry, Ron wait!" A voice behind them shouted. Harry turned and saw Neville running toward them. He pushed and waddled through the crowd but right before he reached the trio someone stuck their leg out of the crowd, tripping the clumsy boy at the last second. Neville tumbled to the ground landing directly in front of Harry's feet. He and Ron helped the boy up and dusted off his robes a bit.
Here, here!" Harry cheered joining the chorus of excited students. The feast materialized around them. The gold trays in the center of the table were suddenly overflowing with delicious food.
They all rose the fireworks in the air. They cast the spell and then...
"You don't think they'll keep us from school do you?" She asked biting her lip. Harry couldn't stop himself from staring. They were bright red and just barely swollen. Probably because she was nervously biting them all day like she just had. Her pink tongue darted across her lips before she closed her mouth.
"Well, everyone's been well. Percy got a rubbish job at the Ministry, now he's all high and mighty. He's only an assistant. Fred and George have been working on these new joke products that are brilliant in my opinion, been experimenting all summer. They call 'em Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Mum's furious though. They didn't get as many O.W.L.s as she was hoping for. Then she found out about their joke stuff and how they were planning to sell them at Hogwarts. That was a big fight. Oh, and the owl Sirius gave me, he's on his way right now. He's amazing. He's so big the only window he fits through is the one in the kitchen. He likes to talk to my mum too. She just loves him. Also Bill and Charlie are in town for the cup! They'll be going with us. They're really cool you'll like them. I know you'vemet Charlie but Bill, he works and lives in Egypt he's got all sorts of stories." Ron blurted. Harry remembered meeting Charlie his first year after he had taken a baby dragon from them. The man had scars all over but was still ruggedly handsome.
"Alright, I'm going to park. Go ahead to the station find a compartment and then keep an eye out for me to say goodbye. Arthur and Molly should already be inside." Sirius explained. They all got out of the SUV and got their heavy trunks and pets into trolleys near the entrance. Harry and Ron's owls attracted some attention as they entered the station. The birds were a bit annoyed by the noise and made some screeches of protest of their own. Harry felt uneasy about all the staring. Even in the muggle world he couldn't escape it. He took off his jacket and draped it over Hedwig's cage to calm her down. Ron noticed and did the same as his owl was even louder.
"I still can't believe it. Broken nose and all, he caught that snitch. Ireland won but Krum will go down in history. This game will go down in history." He muttered to Harry who was only half listening. Harry was replaying the final moment in his brain over and over. He couldn't imagine how Krum was feeling right now. For the first time Harry considered life after Hogwarts and what he might do.
"Hello, hello, everyone!" Fred shouted pulling Harry up for a hug.
"I won't tell anyone. Just don't do this again." He muttered. Draco's eyes went from shock back to anger.
"What are you doing Ginny!" Ron scolded, "You'll get us all caught."
Dessert replaced the dinner feast and they continued to tuck in. Harry thought his stomach might explode. He heard a groan from Ron but turning his head back felt like a challenge at this point. The Great Hall had become quiet. Some students were already nodding off at the table. Others were so full they couldn't talk.
The seeker laid in a heap on the ground as mediwizards surrounded him. Harry watched as he drank cup after cup of potions. Ginny hung over the edge of the box waiting in anticipation.
"Hello Harry, how's summer treating you?" Arthur asked as he approached them. Harry smiled and hugged him.
"I made pie for everyone, it's cooling in the kitchen. You kids run along and enjoy a slice and then right to bed. Kreacher prepared rooms for all of you." Molly sniffled. Harry led the way to the kitchen. Most of the group hadn't been there before. As they filed down the hall, Harry heard angry whispers being exchanged among Sirius and Mrs. Weasley.
