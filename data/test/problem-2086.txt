-"Alright," Draco relented.
Maybe, one day, Draco would be able to stop the poison-spread, befriend the beast...
And Draco was utterly drained.
It should have. But it didn't.
-"Yes, however could I forget how different our socio-economic classes are?
It certainly wasn't a crush.
-"What! Really? How long?"
Although Draco was an asshole, he wasn't unkind to Harry anymore. His careless and rude remarks didn't sting as they once had, because they were halfhearted and just who Draco was. He had a sharp tongue, acted insensitive and like he couldn't care less about him but he nevertheless emitted a sort of warm,
-"It'll come to you later. Maybe you should sleep all this off."
? And why is it such an awful thing when
-"I'm sure she understands. It was your wife's funeral after all." Blaise said prickly.
-"Draco." Theo murmured in his ear, his tone thick with concern and sorrow.
Harry put his back against the door and took a long breath.
Manipulating bastard.
Harry did not have a crush on Draco Malfoy.
Draco Malfoy dropped to his knees in front of an actively crying and screaming Scorpius. Draco frantically looked his son over, demanding what happened? Where was he hurt? Touching him everywhere, looking pale and scared.
him to his death?"
-"Draco. It’s  been bad.
shit.
Lucius Malfoy would never grant him unrestricted clearance to access his property. So Harry would need to beg to be let in. And beg he did.
Harry's body temperature soared dangerously high; for days he kept the curtains closed, unable to witness life outside going-on as usual when his fucking world had crumbled; he felt continuously nauseous, an awful, queasy feeling in his stomach that made him want to vomit all-day, everyday.
Draco scoffed and muttered '
Fucking hell.
breath. It was always like this - breathing, every cell in his body would demand and protest vehemently for oxygen, yet still feel unsatisfied when it was delivered, like his body was disappointed Draco had obliged and breathed. Like it wasn't oxygen his body craved but something else or nothing else. Nothing. Nothingness. Death—she was walking around wearing muggle clothes: threadbare, pale-blue jeans, a white t-shirt, tattered muggle sneakers, holding a tray of empty drinks in one hand and wiping down an empty table with a rag in the other.

Every tear that fell from Draco's red-rimmed eyes, fueled the inferno that was heating up the torturous chunk of coal lodged inside Harry's chest, between his lungs, on his heart.
Nothing and no one could bring back the dead.
Its been almost a month. Harry was no longer able to literally
-"WHAT!" Harry exclaimed, instantly riled.
-"I am?" Potter asked hopefully.
-"What about my letters? Have you gotten around to reading them? I wish you'd sent me just a little
A single tear made its way down Théo's pale cheek.
love with Ginny—He couldn't have been any more wrong.
-"Hmm, what the fuck?"
-"You can't be serious. Honestly, don't you remember that
-"I know."
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. Draco just said his name. His first name. For the first time in forever. Merlin. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Harry's heart thundered in his chest, his insides fucking tickling almost painfully, he felt dizzy, overwhelmed with the onslaught of emotions running wild inside him.
-"No you're not."
-"EXACTLY. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN EXACTLY TWELVE HOURS."
-"Mine is still a peacock." Theo said.
you. Would you like to be Scorpius's mother now?"
Malfoy Manor was even bigger on the inside than it seemed on the outside, Harry observed - magic.
Draco stood up from his seat and moved to sit on the desk, right in front of Harry. He was close. So close, Harry could smell his intoxicating fragrance, sweet, lush and fruity but Harry didn't have the presence of mind to accurately identify it.
Draco growled at her and instantly started premeditating her gruesome assassination.
of this fair? How was he supposed to live on? How was he expected to move on? Draco didn't want to move on. He wouldn't move on. Never. Draco didn't want to be in pain either, he just wanted to
-"So, is it true?" Tom asked curiously.
Fucking hell.
Chemistry was almost the equivalent of Potions in the wizarding-world. He smiled back.
Harry hated her - hated himself.
-"LIKE I FUCKING CARE!"
-"Oh, but Draco. I
They were all seated around the master bedroom. Théo's bedroom. Pansy was leaning against Blaise, hyperventilating, on the king-sized, dark-sheeted Bed. Everything was dark colored. The fancy furniture, the rugs, it all screamed wealth. Yet, it was insentient. It didn't know it was fancy, it didn't feel pride or vanity from its beauty, it didn't feel pain when it was broken, it didn't feel loss when replaced. It didn't
-"No,"
-"That's not as much of an incentive as you seem to think it is, Pansy." Draco said.
At the sound of Draco's gasp, Théo's eyes flew open, they were dark pools of sheer blackness but held so much love, fear, pain and sadness, for
think so, do you? None of you do. Not when you awkwardly joke about it, and breathe an inaudible sigh of relief when I laugh along you. Why do you keep bringing it up, Blaise? Because you feel guilty, because you know what you did. Sometimes the guilt creeps up on you, Blaise, and you can't ignore it, so you seek relief, you joke about it, I laugh, you feel better. A sporadically persistent feeling of guilt to soothe, a mere annoying itch to be scratched, mild curiosity to be satiated—IT’S MY FUCKING LIFE, BLAISE! EVERYDAY. YOU RUINED MY LIFE. YOU RUINED MY FUCKING LIFE. YOU TOOK EVERYTHING, BLAISE. HE'S EVERYTHING. I'VE LOVED HIM
-"No, 's alright. Thanks." Harry said laconically.
Fuck it.
-"Quite the opposite, actually, I've been loved and spoiled rotten by my uncle and aunt, still am."
He stepped into the en-suite Bathroom, followed by Theo, stripped off his clothes and stared at his reflection in the mirror.
-"I'm always pretty, how dare you!"
-"Yeah. Harry's obsessed with him, again."
And then a familiar scent tickled his nose - Harry abruptly sat up, which was a bad a idea for someone who hadn't eaten more than an apple in the entire day and had been living off fruits, nuts, mysterious potions and little water for a month, the room spun and went out of focus, his skin broke out in a cold sweat.
," he laughed maliciously, "Me, a Slytherin, a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy's son. Oh, this is just perfect. Isn't the weaslette doing it for you anymore? Did you finally let go of your obstinate self-righteousness and your unauthentic principles? Did you finally learn the wrongs of your actions and that you can't just fucking slice people open in bathrooms and leave them to bleed? Is this what lies beneath Dumbledore's carefully constructed personality, an immoral, deceiving scum-bag? I doubt I'm the first, what are you, a compulsive adulterer? Did you think I wouldn't refuse you, Oh-Holy-Savior? Salazar, Potter, look at you, flinching with every word like it was a physical blow. Does it hurt, Potter? I can hurt you. Oh, yes, I can and I will."
He shook his head and said nothing.
, fucking sorry—"
-"We're friends. Friends hug all the time."
-"No. You're worse. You're Harry Potter. Your pity would feel like magnanimity for a lesser rival,
She smiled proudly.
-"You can't seriously expect me to go away after all of this. My life's boring and predictable. You're so much more fun."
-"I admit, it's a well thought-out justification. But Potter, none of the people gossiping about me, came thrice to visit me when I was. . . sick. None of those people had Death Eater Lucius Malfoy smiling and simultaneously sneering at them and oh-so-politely and not-so-subtly conveying that they weren't welcome in his home, yet still came back for a fourth visit. None of those people follow me around. You're all in this together you say, but none of those people need me, Potter. None of those people have
-"Hmm?"
-"Why, yes. Thank you, I do my best."
-"Yes and I can't keep on living like this, when it's
-"Fudging heck!"
-"Damn you, Draco. The world doesn't revolve around you. I pity me!
Draco smiled at Théo's reflection in the mirror as he brushed his teeth, getting ready for bed.
-"Salazar! Don't you fudging have a job?" Draco said, upon finding Blaise still conversing with his Mother and Father over an opulent breakfast.

Harry Potter was utterly fucked.
-"Let's go shopping!"
He wouldn't pretend with Hermione, nor anyone, really, he was too sick to

will be.
-"What?" Harry whispered.
Harry didn't really know what to say to that. He understood it for what it was - a fair warning, one Harry wished to heed but knew enough to not even bother trying with. He'd only end up terribly missing Draco and unable to stay away.
Draco loved Astoria more than anything, anything, else in the world, but she was dead.
Not even when his mother died.
-"This was a one-time thing, Potter. Now, off you go." He said it like it was nothing. Like it didn't mean anything, didn't change anything.
One doesn't compose ballads about the agony of having their limb cut off while it's happening.
-"What's wrong Potter, you've barely uttered two words. Had your speech-skills deserted you alongside your worth, after the war?" Parkison said.
It never will. This is my life. But now that he's in pain. Now, I know the true meaning of Draco's pain being my own. Being pained

Draco pushed away from Theo again. He didn't want to be coddled. He wanted his wife back.

Harry threw his arms around Draco's neck only to be immediately pushed away by Draco.
This is happening?
He braced his back against the headboard and inhaled deeply. Panting. Gasping. Horrified. Craving more.
shut up, Draco!"
! Draco's breath hitched and caught in his throat, it ached. Everything ached.
fondness for Harry that made him feel safe and accepted. Strangely, even if Draco judged him, which he did all the time, Harry didn't feel self-conscious or less, around him, like he'd used to as a kid. Maybe because Draco's often nasty indiscretions weren't meant any longer. Maybe because Harry loved him too much to resent him for anything. Maybe because after every time Draco would make a truly mean or potentially hurtful comment—always about the Weasleys—he would stare at Harry, challenging him to say something in return, gaze unwavering, unapologetic, as if to say: 'I am what I am, so are you still sure about this?'
-"I'd hate to disappoint, Pansy, but no.
Yet, when he opened his eyes again, when the feelings halted just as suddenly as they'd started, when he could feel the ground beneath his feet again, he was
Théo startled at Draco's bitter, raspy laughter and cupped his face in both his hands, stared at him pleadingly, begging Draco silently to stay. But Draco was gone and would hopefully never come back.
-"I feel like organizing a party, now. That bitch Pansy will try to outshine me, though. So I need at least a few months to decide on what to wear and only mention that I'm hosting a party a couple of weeks before it, so she wouldn't have enough time to do shit."
After they finished eating, and in Draco's case criticizing Harry's culinary skills while eating the entire sandwich Harry made him, they went back up to the bedroom.
Harry saw a gleam of triumph in Draco's eyes—not unlike the one Dumbledore had had all those years ago. Dumbledore who'd manipulated Harry, who'd had everyone's best interests in mind except Harry's, raised him like a pig for slaughter. Dumbledore, whom Harry loved despite it all. Because that was just what Harry Potter did, when he gives his loyalty, it's meant for forever. Unending. Unquestioning. And Harry had given Draco his heart.
-"What in the world!"
He watched Potter. Their faces so close, Potter unable to hold his gaze, his cheeks were pink and he was visibly quarreling with himself, trying to find something to talk about, a reason to prolong this private talk with Draco, without talking about the dragon in the room which was '
-"YOU SAID HE WOULDN'T DIE! WHAT THE FUCK, POTTER?"
How could Harry feel that his life culminated in Draco, when Draco doesn't want him back? How could Harry love Draco when Draco doesn't love him back?
The Chaise-lounge was too small for the both of them to lie across it side by side. So, Theo did the reasonable thing and elbowed Blaise off it. Blaise fell down, colliding into Pansy who'd been in a diligent glaring match with Draco.
What??????
-"Get the fuck off me! Since when is cheating forbidden. I'll kick you in the balls, Draco. I swear."
-"Oh, that's too bad Potter. You see, I'm not going down to lunch. I'm leaving earlier today for personal reasons. And I really should be going. How about you owl me?" He smiled evilly. Yet, no one saw it because they were all awkwardly shuffling their feet, looking down and pretending not to be there and listening in on their conversation.
And there was no right time to leave her in the future, either. No right time for her to be upset.
Draco breathed a deep, stuttering,
She must never know.
Blaise laughed at him.
wasn't careful with his fragile, sickly father, that he would die too. Leave him too. And Draco couldn't, for the life of him, sit down and talk . . .
Why? Why? Why?
-"Did you make it?"

-"I'll go get us a few drinks. Stay close by." Theo said in Draco's ear. Draco nodded at him before he left.
Harry smiled, Draco was such an endearingly oxymoronic person.
Suddenly, and just as quickly as it all started, Draco's outburst came to an end, visibly drained, he slumped back on the sofa next to Harry, and produced a muggle cigarette. He lit it up with the tip of his wand, took a deep drag, he then exhaled the smoke into the air. He did it once. Twice. Harry watched him mesmerized.
-"I will disapparate the moment the door opens."
-"Shut up, Potter. We're not your friends and frankly don't care." Theo said.
The ever-growing crowds gasped.
would mean anything. Don't you see?"
-"My wife is dead." He mumbled weakly. But the stone-hearted bastards only laughed at him.
-"It's never going to happen."
-"Excuse you, I give amazing head!" Pansy said.
He sobbed freely, his sobs muffled by the sound of the water hitting the floor-tiles.

Blaise was the first to find a Portkey and therefore the first to get there. He appeared in their little château's drawing-room, to find a shaking Greg who could only manage to nod in the right direction.
She got up, knowing where he would be - The Narcissus Garden, exquisite, yellow flowers, symbolic of a young life cut short. Her favorites. Narcissus not unlike her had been doomed since birth. For hadn't the prophet Teiresias forewarned Narcissus's mother of his impending death were he to ever see himself? An impossible demand. A cruel farce, was Narcissus's life, not unlike hers at all.
-"Don't say that." Draco murmured.

You don't move on from shit like that. It lives on, unprocessed, a deadly venom, an untamable beast, thinly-veiled, locked away yet invading everywhere inside you. While from the outside you smile and laugh it off, because while the sun killed Icarus, the moon would have kept him locked away. Neither was a faith better than the other. Draco, not unlike Icarus, was
With the clean shirt halfway on, Harry heard a sound...the doorbell? What?! After another ring Harry was sure it
Everyone started laughing. Draco's cheeks turned pink.
Three weeks after Harry Potter had ruined someone's life in a garden and had his own life ruined by someone else in another garden, Harry Potter was minding his own business, pretending that no one was sneering at him, that he wasn't hanging by a thread and that his boss wasn't about to fire him any day now for bringing shame on an already disgraceful department, when Ron Weasley shoved him against the wall of the soon-to-be-busy-and-he-needs-to-fuck-off-before-Nott-catches-him-still-lurking-around cafeteria. (Harry had decided he didn't have much time to live anyways and might as well try the cafeteria's ghastly food). Harry rolled his eyes. He was genuinely sorry for everything he'd done, but these days, he was honestly feeling like an elderly lady who'd lost everyone she cared about, had a foot in the grave and straight-up ran out of fucks to give.
-"What are you doing?" Potter squeaked.
-"I was." He answered reflexively.
He was sure Ginny would have sympathized with Malfoy and kept it to herself but Harry hadn't been able to bring himself to tell her. Because Malfoy didn't need sympathy. He needed something. Harry didn't know what it was but he'd find it out and do it. Malfoy needed help. Malfoy needed someone, and Harry would be that someone for him.
-"I want to," Harry choked on air. "But Theo doesn't; he says he doesn't want to replace her because no one can. It'd make him feel inadequate and somehow less. I don't know, they're both very disparate. Theo is Theo and Astoria is Astoria—what truly pains Theo, though, more than anything, more than his own pain and regret, is seeing
Harry beamed gleefully like a
-"We'll leave if he doesn't like it or gets sleepy, Draco. I promise. I really want you to go out on some adults' outings a little. But I understand that you can't bear to be away from Scorpius, so the party will have to do. Please, Draco. For
They stepped in a vast hallway, like
Ginny frowned.
-"Draco." Harry said, grabbing Draco's forearm and turning him away from the fireplace.
DID SOMETHING WRONG! THEY THINK GINNY SHOULD BE HOME MORE! THEY THINK
He turned his face away as tears filled his dark eyes to the brim.
-"I can't breathe," Draco croaked out.
-"I havent seen you in nine days and sixteen hours." Harry blurted out, immediately mortified, he slammed a hand against his mouth.
-"Now, now, children, Potter is our guest, we shan't accost him further. Let's sit down. What would you like to drink, dear?" Asked Narcissa.
-"Come on, guys, it's fifteen to nine. Time to go." Pansy said, checking her muggle watch like the blood-traitor she became.
Draco ripped his arm from Harry's hold and took off down the hall.
His face crumpled, brows furrowed in pain, an expression of such incongruous anguish on his face,
Oh, yeah, because Draco, from time to time, after laughing at Harry, to his face, would be chuckling and watching Harry's reaction, his face, and Draco's derisive laughter would fade into a smirk that would sometimes, faced with Harry's own scarlet cheeks and scowl, turn into a little, soft smile that was only for Harry. It was an amused, marginally fond smile that was the last thing and the first thing on Harry's mind these days.
-"Scorpius! I miss him so much! Him and his Daddy don't come for weeks now. So sad!" Rose said.
He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco's neck, pulling him to his chest. Draco went willingly and let Harry cradle his head, kiss his forehead, stroke his hair, his back, breath him in, hold him tighter. After a while Harry's body calmed down.

Your first real father figure, he shaped your life, sent you out on little adventures, gave you just enough information to not get frustrated or Merlin forbid ask questions for yourself, doubt him, stray from the path he'd carefully made. He treated you better than the rest of us but never when it truly mattered. What was a house cup for poor, orphaned Harry when he'd be dead before long? Let him break rules. Let him feel special, feel needed, feel counted upon, let him feel like he had any say in anything. Make him feel like The Dark Lord's fight was with him and only him. Let him feel guilty for everyone's death. So, when the time comes, he'll die for us all. For the greater good. I certainly don't hate him for

They all whipped their heads around.
-"And I'm not actually going with you?"
Or did he?
-"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'd been really worried about them and now I know I needn't worried because they'd been having fun and had apparently forgotten that I was having daily meltdowns just two floors up."
Harry thought. He stroked Draco's hair and didn't dare make a noise. He was scared Draco would remember where he was,
Ron wrenched him roughly to his feet by the collar of his shirt, ripping it. He punched him in the jaw - Harry tasted his own blood.
Draco didn't know what the fuck anything meant or was anymore, feeling unrealistically
-"Okay. Let's have lunch first."
Harry felt sluggish and slow, his body was pumped full with potions and muggle pain-killers to enable him to get through the day.
-"Fuck, yeah. You know, we seriously don't have to go. We can just head out to the Manor. I already bought Scorpius a thousand galleons' worth of toys. And so did everyone."
-"Spare me." Draco sneered and spun around.
, the
-"Emma."
Everyday, for ten days, Harry thought of Draco. What was he doing? Who was he with? Was he crying? Was he thinking of Harry? Was he thinking of what he'd said to Harry? Was Nott with him? Was he overwhelmed? How was Scorpius? Wasn't he missing Rose? Was he bored with his father actually working? Was Draco tired? Sad?
-"I love love love love love love you, Scorpius." Draco said out loud. A big smile on his handsome features.
-"YESSSSSSS!" Ginny screamed and hugged her Mother, who'd instantly known by some motherly-miracle that Ginny was carrying Harry's lifelong dream and worst nightmare.
A few hours later, found Draco kneeling on the bed, sobbing and throwing pillows left and right, Harry ducking down to avoid being hit, his hands in the air as a sign of peace and surrender. But Draco wasn't having any of that and screeched for his wand that Harry'd had the presence of mind of picking up from the nightstand before he swiftly moved out of Draco's reach to save his life.
Harry held Draco tighter to him. He was with Harry now. He wasn't with Nott or Astoria but with Harry. Harry refused to think about anything else.
-"Yes. I strangely feel very protective of you."
-"Fucking hell!" A familiar voice said.
Pain.
He hurried inside, sat in the nearest booth to the bar, scanning his foreign surroundings. The place was somewhat decent, didn't smell disgusting, the tables weren't greasy, and the music was pleasant if a bit loud; surprisingly, for a Monday evening, there were many customers already; in the center of the club, was a dance floor where a few couples mingled, awkwardly shuffling around and bouncing stupidly to the music. Gross. Draco was embarrassed for them but nevertheless, they provided adequate entertainment.
-"Why are you doing this, then?" Harry demanded.
His voice was laced with out-of-character emotions - despair, anger, fear and
-"W-what?"
The following morning Harry's body felt as good as new. His heart was another matter entirely.
Harry wept for an hour.
Tom sighed, rummaged around his side of the bar and produced a copy of the Daily Prophet. He pushed it towards Harry and raised his eyebrows like Harry owed him fuckall.
-"Why? You didn't know. It was Blaise's fault. Pansy too. She knew."
After which, Pansy and Blaise announced their intentions of 'properly' celebrating the new year in vague terms. Draco didn't appreciate the reminder because it was disgusting and he really didn't want to imagine his friends in compromising positions and mistakenly didn't keep his sentiments on the matter to himself which earned him a subtle hair pulling contest with Pansy in front of their chosen fireplace in the middle of the still marginally full atrium. Greg and Blaise dragged them away to different fireplaces. Pansy shouted that he was jealous because he wasn't getting any. Draco smugly reminded her that she couldn't say shit like that because his wife was dead. Everyone facepalmed and hurried to fuck off.
But most importantly he
Draco sighed.
Harry had felt irrationally angry and equal parts intrigued. Why the fuck was he here? When did he come back to England? And why? Was he back at Malfoy Manor?

-"What...?"
-"I live to serve." Theo breathed before resuming their quite passionate and unexpected make out session.
I do not believe you capable of such a thing.
Draco struggled to stop laughing so Harry gave him a minute.
, would probably look like him, have his green-eyes, his unruly hair...It's what all Harry had desired before he'd met Draco again.
Nevertheless, Harry's irritation and outrage at Nott's narcissism and assholery helped him, if nothing else, keep the tears at bay.
Draco was suffering. He was a proud, self-indulgent man. He didn't feel contrite for what transpired during the war. Because he didn't have anything to feel remorseful about. Nothing to atone. He did what he had to do to keep himself, his mother and father alive. And he succeeded. Self-preservation was what Draco valued the most, he was a Slytherin after all. He didn't do self-flagellation, or self-loathing. He didn't like to suffer. Yet, he was suffering. But he didn't want to. Why wasn't death an option? Draco couldn't remember anymore. But there was nothing one can do with suffering except to suffer it.
Draco knew he was quite
The days that followed, he hadn't even been let in past the gates, he spent those days pacing around the property, which was fucking huge, and trying to pinpoint where the fuck Draco's room could be, not that he could do anything about it even if he did, but he figured he'd stare at it all day instead of the racist gates, and maybe go crazy imagining every movement of the curtains, that was most likely caused by the breeze, was Draco looking for him, smiling at him, waving at him...Never mind that that was fucking ridiculous because if Draco wanted to see him, he need only say so to his Father and Harry would be racing up the stairs and looking, smiling and waving back at him in person.
-"YOU CAN'T MARRY HIM—"
-"Are you sure it's been a month? I don't look bad. Just as devilishly handsome as always." He smirked at Theo.
-"Yes."
He never, ever, wanted to contemplate or go down that line of thought.
-"Sometimes. Only to the people I love."
-"Don't fucking touch me!" Draco Malfoy yelled at Théo. Shoving him away with all the strength left in his inebriated, exhausted, sadly not dying body.
-"Is it? Your Godfather was a disgrace. Hadn't he been disowned? He had no right to leave you this. Hadn't it been a time of war, Mother would have certainly taken it back. I suppose we still can, out of spite if nothing else. It's nothing much, you see. I've never really liked it."
-"Yes. Well, about that—"
The next day, a Wednesday, Harry Potter popped in for a couple of minutes in his department so they wouldn't think he'd ditched work or something, only to remember as he was racing towards The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, that he hadn't seen his boss—the head auror, in months, and that everyone was half-psychotic and probably unaware of their whereabouts, let alone Harry's irrelevant existence. He spent the entire day trailing Draco, to Draco's utmost annoyance.
Harry sputtered and spat Treacle Tart on his fresh shirt, and table. Harry's eyes widened like saucers, his cheeks flamed red from mortification. Lucius, Parkison, Zabini...they'd read—
-"Alright. Where's our office?" Pansy said.
-"I love you, I swear. I left her and I can't even hate myself and feel guilty because I'm too terribly scared you'll never forgive me!"
-"I don't know, Potter. I still love my wife."
-"Language!" Scorpius said. "Oh, hey, Harry! Daddy say you a evil, unicorn-hater and that I should not tell you he cry because he miss you." Scorpius said.
Eyes red, eyebrows furrowed, lower lip trapped between his teeth, so as not to be loud, shaking and gasping sporadically, Malfoy wept. He brought a hand to his mouth and bit on it,
Draco pondered what to say briefly.
Besides, Harry's life was boring. He'd readily admit it. Everyone's lives was boring as a matter of fact. And Harry was kind of a thrill-seeker, he'd killed a Basilisk when he was twelve for fuck's sake and now he was reduced to staring at the ceiling of his auror cubicle and occupying himself with thinking up wild theories about his steadily going mad auror partner's imaginary love life. The man was constantly blushing and smiling shyly, mumbling stuff like,
Draco on the other hand had been dwelling in Heaven for years, had gotten used to its glory. Only for it to burn down and leave him behind. Lamenting, in the middle of its ashes and debris, what was and never will be.
Harry was sure Draco wasn't originally planning on leaving and that he only said that to avoid Harry. Great. Now, Harry had given him the opportunity to go on a date with Nott.
Yet, depression, in its most basic form - is a part of oneself hurting the rest along with itself. Why is that? Draco thought. But the thought quickly slipped away in the grey omnipresent haze that was Draco's existence - numbness, his friend in the dark, seemingly eternal captivity, receded for him to succumb to the fluctuating ache that was his other friend. Why? What was he imprisoned for? Whatever it was. Draco wished he were dead.

Semaus jaw dropped when the boys finished their demonstration. “When did you guys learn that?”

And he does.
are we here for?”
The picture they'd come into and the one he'd just left. It made his stomach flip. It was a weird feeling he couldn't quite place. Now that wasn’t to say he regretted his decision but he knew there was a good chance those would be the last friendships he’d ever have. There was no given that he was about to make any new friends soon and the friends he did have would most definitely fizzle to the part of his mind he left all those miles away.
“I don’t know what to do.”
Ron had asked him to walk him home. Harry found no reason to argue, he’d wanted to talk to Mrs Weasley anyway.
Cedric came back home that morning looking triumphant. Harry hadn't a clue what he had done and he didn't want to. Amos seethed in rage when he saw him. His brother only grunted and went to grab his signs. His nose was red and he looked like he had a black eye.
“Of course not, I love it here! now let go of me!”
Seamus bit his bottom lip. “Someone should go with him right?”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Are you defending him?”
He didn't know, so he told her such. “I don’t know Miss…I feel like a right sissy.”
Malfoy appeared confused. “What made you think I would quit!”
Harry’s routine began to consist of such lessons. It seemed like how avoiding Malfoy was impossible, being near him was also such. Harry could count on no hands how many times practise
His word sent Harry back a moment. The recital? It seemed shocking that the thought of it had barely crossed his mind. Of course he’d known there would be another one—there was one very year after all— His mind hadn’t registered that fact. It was funny how something of such big importance could slip one’s mind after it had already been done once.
“No—No he’s my son. Thank you for everything you did but I’ll take it from here.”
Her voice rises. “Don’t speak to me like that!”
Harry stilled for a moment. He saw Ron's ears turn red. He shrugged and beckoned his friend to follow him.
“Only when he thought no one was home. C’mere.”
Draco sent out a little prayer to whatever god hated Potter the most before taking his running start and jumping into the air.
Harry could hear sirens. This time he thought he might have imagined them though. They seemed like warning bells. They told him not to say what he was about to. They warned him to stay silent. He didn’t care though. Harry was an angry person, he got that from Amos.
Harry wished Malfoy had taken his own advice. He could almost understand the other boy’s reasoning for not going near each other, but it seemed the blonde boy wasn’t able to do it himself. There wasn’t a single lesson where Harry didn't hear a sarcastic comment or half ass'd joke from Malfoy.
“You sure you not coming in?” Harry asked.
“It’s a ballet school Potter, not much happens round here. We dance, we ache, we sleep and we gossip. It's the nature of such a place.”
I hope to continue working on this fic more while also my others, i'm so attached to all of them though I can tell this fic is going to be chonky :D There's just so much planned so It might take a while but I hope it's all pan out.
“Scary innit? The names Seamus, nice to meet you.”
“—What song was it? Just now.”
“I thought I was thuggish?” Harry asked, confused.
“Miss yelled it out during roll call, not to mention we sit in alphabetical order.”
His Grandma, and old hunchbacked woman with glossy eyes told the same story every time they walked to his mother's grave. He’d never paid attention until now though.
Harry didn’t really care where he ended up, but now that Seamus had said that he found himself agreeing. They made their way past the gates and Seamus looked to the left side of the school. “A friend of mine will be waiting for me over there so I have to go off. I’ll see you later!”
She raised her eyebrows and shrugged. "Suite yourself."
“Oh yeah! He used to trip me over during class and pull on my tutu. The git never left me alone.”
She’d only shook her head. “This Math homework yeah.” He’d sigh for she’d already finished all the homework.
"Luna? why do you do ballet?"
In the warm summer heat the meal hall was abandoned for the coolness of the outside shade and Harry took his time to glance around at the sweating student body. The first years kept close to the school doors as the older years spread away further.
Ron walked along the under bridge. “Ginny told me you've been doing ballet.”
For a moment he thought the other boy looked intimidated, but in hindsight maybe he was just confused. His upturned lip and slight grimace reminded Harry of someone he hadn't met yet. No thought of his really mattered in the end as a shiny boxing glove met Harry's face in an uncomfortable
must have been difficult at first.
It’s Christmas. The miners are having some sort of get together raffle night and Harry finds himself out in the snow with Ron. A crooked snowman comes into existence between their fingers. It's ugly.
“I hope you don’t get in...but I know you will.”
No tears fell as determination set in
The boy’s nose was almost blue and his eyes were stained red with tears by the time the two brothers had found him, curled up beside a phone booth. Cedric hadn’t the time to berate the boy as he helped Harry usher him to the heat of the car.
Hermione shook her head and tried to compose herself. “Harry, I don’t like ballet, In fact I'm pretty sure I hate it. It’s useless and unhelpful and it kills my feet.”
. They hold auditions in Newcastle”
She let out an exaggerated sigh as frustration grows within her. “I don’t do it for the money Harry, If you're bloody well not interested that’s fine by me!”
gets it.”
Harry paled as he saw an even taller boy leaning outside the door of a classroom.
Ginny stops for a second. “Well—
There are soft slow footsteps that move through the locker room quietly. “Harry. I’m sorry”
“I didn't even say
“Who's going to be in the audience?” Harry asked.
to have been. He knows this as he knows most things he's never been told. A start contrast formed in imperfect reasoning. Before was a definite, secured in the steady stream of his life. Before did happen. Even if he couldn't remember it.
"Are you going to ask me for mine?"
His fist hurt, his stomping foot and pushes hurt. The lack of his attention… hurt.

Harry felt the ghost of a smile come upon his face. “I wish they’d play music more during my class.”
He’d even tried to egg her on with kind words.
Dean seemed to grimace and smile all at once.
yet. Unless Moody thought eleven was manhood age.
Harry wasn't sure what he should be feeling. There were the nerves from that morning that still had him mostly on autopilot but he wasn’t sure what else. He recounted his day. He didn’t like Snape he knew. Then again Harry didn’t really like a lot of people, and in the end he wasn’t here to make friends. He was here for his career, which is honestly an odd thing for an eleven year old to think about but he didn’t let that sway him. He could tell his teacher was the type of person Ron and Ginny would both hate. He was a snob and at times cruel and Harry was glad he had some semblance of self control when it came to shitty teachers, after all he'd dealt with Moody and he hadn’t even
Harry paused. “—What?”
Ginny sat down equally exhausted but with a cruel smile. “Told ya it takes loads of practise.”
"Dunno. They joke about starting a joke shop so much that they might actually be serious. Mum thinks its bollocks."
“You’d look like a twat in makeup Seamus, what’d you think Harry? Seamus in Lavenders eyeliner.” Dean laughed as his friend blushed.
Amos folded his arms. “You're
Harry chuckled. He liked the idea of this possible future. Any future that involved dancing, hopefully a future like the one Penelope was living.
He stays silent for a moment. “—I dunno. Never really thought about it.”
“You know! The two small classes, Me, you, Seamus, Hermione, Lavender. The whole lot.”
Draco looked forward and side eyed the other boy. “Hard not to when you have the volume moderation skills of an elephant.”
Malfoy seemed to pale at the teacher's words. “
Harry didn't know if he complied to spite her or himself. He guessed either way it didn't really matter. His feet were quieter with the shoes and he felt as if he had the pointed toe thing going pretty well. What he didn't realise was how pronounced it made his mistakes look. Every wobble of his leg and stomp of his foot looked competently out of what the shoes seemed to expect of him. What he had expected of himself.
“At the Cathedral.”
He knows they're the only things that he can really count as
She looked up. “What? I was invited just like you.”
Seamus shrugged. “Fair point. Guess I’m just a little nervous.”

He can tell she wants to speak to him, but she doesn’t. Her face is tight and her eyes never waver from the road. She’s got two hand gripped on the wheel and her seat is so far forward that to look at her face he would need to lean. He doesn’t.
Two boys passed them as he walked down the stairs. A few years older than him they wore the leotard and tights he’d seen in pictures. Harry had the chills as they passed. He could feel himself losing his breath but he forced it in. He couldn’t get exhausted. Not now. He ignored the black pit of dread in his stomach.

Harry gazed wistfully at his friend. The blond pampered like a wild animal brought indoors, frightened and still though ultimately comfortable. He sat crossed legged on the mattress gazing towards the telly, which broadcasted one of the royals he couldn’t bother to name.
Draco looked confused. “For different reasons I assume?”
He’s given up on the idea of an audition, he reckons helping girls who couldn't care less is the closest he’ll ever get to being a professional dancer, It’s a depressing thought for an eleven year old. Knowing the peak of his dream career is this. He can’t even think about it though without getting angry. His shoulders snap hastily with the music. Rose doesn't notice. Miss tries to console him, says he’s improved quite a lot. He’s hit a roadblock and they both know it. There isn’t much more she can teach and there's no more for him to learn here. But that doesn’t mean he’s good. It just means he can’t progress.
The boy glanced at him. “Yes…”
“Harry Evans P—Potter Diggory…”
Penelope blushed but frowned. “You over exaggerate.”
afraid of the dark. How could he be? He’d grown up in the dark of all places. Spent his days in dark corners spying on his parents and their guests. He’d lived in dark rooms with dim Victorian lights not made for electricity for as long as he can possibly remember. With all this he was half sure his eyes were built to
He was crossing a small wooden bridge above a silent creek when he heard the sound of footsteps behind him. He didn’t think much of it, presumed it was a jogger.
Harry didn’t understand how Malfoy seemed to instantly act like he understood the dance moves. Apparently they were supposed to click continuously while doing some form of agonisingly slow moves. Harry pushed away his complaints as he tried to examine and follow Malfoy’s moves.
“Oh.”
name. He wasn’t one to say much about names but the man before him struck Harry as nothing other than odd.
He doesn’t smile for the whole bus ride though. Seven hours is a long time to have to sit in one place.
“Suite yourself.”
“Do you have anything better to do
“You were at least three tenths of a second late.”
Cedric chewed on a toothpick. “What you after a list?”
He huffs and can feel his lungs pound in pain but he doesn’t stop running. He sees Amos get off the bus. He looks at him and then turns away. Cedric doesn’t stop.
He promised himself to never stop.
“Sure the songs a little weird but—”
He thinks it’s a pretty bitter memory. A quintessentially sad becoming. The music stuck this instance to his mind, kicked it awake. It was the start of his past.
Ron looked scared. His ears are red but Harry can't tell if it's from the cold or not. “You won’t tell anyone will you?”
“What?”
“Okay then... Farewell. You should receive your answer in a few weeks time. I hope you both understand that this
“Cancer, yours?”
She seemed to think before answering.
He had to go into a changing room and put on the same attire he’d seen the two boys wear. He kept his gaze firm as he untied his shoes. He could hear a boy chatting to someone next to him.
“Don’t patronise me.”
. As of now...
“Go home son.” It sounded like he was about to cry.
“I’d hope.”
“Harry.”
Dean nodded. “It’s unorthodox isn’t it? Apparently the Headmaster suggested it.”
And they weren't quite sure who’d spoken.
Harry tilted his head. “Are you okay?”
“Then don’t work with me!”
“His name was Ron, His mum was my first Ballet teacher.”
“Have you got a tutu yet?” His friend questions.
He knows the music will come back. And he knows when it does, it'll
Even so…
The boys quickly shuffled to follow his instruction. Snape seemed to eye out all their abilities before taking them to the floor to practise stretches.
“You can’t with Cedric!”
“What for.”
“Dad was right you know. Your mum would have let you. She was kind like that”
“Sod off.”
He throws the dish towel he was holding towards Harry's face.
“I agree.”
Draco looked like he had a hundred objections. But, in the end, he didn't voice any of them. Instead his eyes softened and he shook his head a bit. "All right."
The redirection worked; Harry cringed a bit. "Suppose you're technically out of a job now."
“No, you didn’t. Besides, we’ve been over this. Voldemort was forcing your hand—”
“Then you might as well have a proper harness, in case we go out, and a proper muzzle to keep you from nipping.”
She stifled a yawn—she’d probably been up late dealing with SPEW issues. “Perhaps Harry can invite your parents to dinner at Grimmauld Place next week, when Draco’s friends are there? Your mum always keeps her temper in front of strangers.”
"Have you?" Draco gave him an odd look. "Where did you get the cash from?"
He rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter. You chose the right sort of people for friends.”
Suddenly he couldn’t breathe, as if there were iron bands around his chest, as if he were pressed hard from all directions—
After a few seconds of squirming, Draco complied. Harry was still holding him by the scruff of his neck as he became a twitchy human instead of a twitchy ferret. A twitchy human in silk pajamas, no less.
"Marrying into a family isn't the same as being born into it."
Harry laughed. “Good point.” A thought seemed to strike him. “You didn't tell McGonagall why you were spending so much time as a ferret, did you?”
“Azkaban,” Harry said. “That’s where it might have happened.”
Harry grinned; Draco could smell his amusement. "That looks like a yes."
No, not Harry. This was Draco’s memory, and this was Draco critiquing the architecture of the Twin Towers. This was not a pensieve: Harry wasn’t just viewing Draco’s memory, he was living it.
He wondered, for a moment, if the family had closed the dining room off. Perhaps they were trying to shut out the memories of living under the Dark Lord. Once Lucius dropped from his favour, they’d been living in terror.
“Oh! I’m going to meet Shira and Jamie after all. Wait, what time is it here?"
“That’s true,” Hermione admitted. “Although she never took the dark mark. Still, we don’t know for certain that the mark prevents one—but be patient, Harry. It probably won’t come easy to him.”
“I’ve got work to do—”
"JFK." Draco scowled. "That's unacceptable. Write back. Tell him you'll need a different flight. One that lands in Newark."
Harry winked. "Very proper."
"You won't like it," Draco warned.
“Trying to work out how many life debts I owe you first.”
“Wait, you let Voldemort know you were gay? Did your parents even know back then?”
Harry leapt to his feet. “Draco—”
->*<-
“Longer than that!”
But not everyone was hell-bent on some call or bit of paperwork. There were people laughing and joking with each other too, or throwing their hands up in mock despair at some piece of news or other.
“So you must be Hagrid." There was an odd note of satisfaction in her voice. “I’ve heard so much about you from Ron and Hermione.”
"You're sure?"
She stared at him. "Could you try for a bit more snark and self-loathing in that sentence?"
Of course, things might turn ugly. The man despised Draco—in fairness, understandably. Weasley wasn’t wrong when he named all the reasons. Hell, Hagrid had a right to turn Draco away.
He woke up the second time because of an apologetic little tap on his shoulder. This time Harry sat straight up, wide-eyed, and grabbed for his wand.
"You don't want to talk about this just yet." Draco eyes were narrowed, but his tone was surprisingly free of judgment. Mostly.
Draco frowned at him, as if deciding how much he should reveal.  “I spent a lot of time here as a child.”
Ron nodded with considerable feeling. "Yeah. Look for a rabbi like that, mate."
“No.”
“Oh, I know what they are.” Harry gave her a grim smile. “But, trust me, they love him. I don’t know for sure, but I don’t think they ever mistreated him.”
“So you can apparate.”
"That's true." Draco sighed. "What happens the first time Skeeter refers to you as a member of the Malfoy clan?"
In fact, she and Ron should confront Draco with an unpleasant truth. He deserved to know how much more he owed Harry.
“Sorry,” he said. “Lost in thought. What was that?”
Harry smacked him again. "Off now, Malfoy."
Harry squeezed his hand. “No, but like you said, he’ll tolerate you as long as you’re under my thumb. And stop calling him Weasel.”
A moment later, Ron opened the door. Harry watched his sleep-heavy eyes grow wide before he let himself into the sitting room and closed the bedroom door behind him.
“Wanted Harry and me to lose our tempers so that we’d be banned from Quidditch?”
"You're not like him," Harry repeated. "Your real crimes were committed under duress. Lucius all but ran into Voldemort's arms, at least until you were in danger."
"I saw it when I visited you in Azkaban that time, remember? Back during the trials. And I saw it during your trial when you were made to expose it."
"It is?"
But Harry ignored him in favour of stroking the owl. “Sorry, but I don’t have any treats on hand. I’ll make it up to you next time.” He paused to shoot a wicked grin at Draco. “And no, I won’t feed my pet to you.”
Granger sighed. "Harry would have helped you even if you hadn't agreed to honour this stupid life debt, you know."
Before the Malfoy family's spectacular fall from grace, his father had picked up on every Ministry rumour. Which wasn't surprising, considering his methods: he had fawned over some contacts and blackmailed others.
Draco seemed almost to relax at that. “Fine. I’ll get my mobile.”
Still, the write-up was friendly and factual enough, covering Draco’s work for Robards, Harry’s daring rescue, and the fact that Harry had saved Draco’s life back during the war as well. There was an approving tone regarding the life debt, and the mutual consent—confirmed by Mr. Ronald Weasley and Mrs. Hermione Granger-Weasley—of both parties. His parents had chosen the reporter well.
Harry grinned as he helped himself to a seat. “I don’t care that you’re still pouting, Malfoy. I still get a say in what happens to my house. What do you want to do to the kitchen?”
“Make it clear that you might not accept any arranged marriage.” He paused. "That's what I want, Draco. Give us a chance."
“No. I never did, really. It was all necessary; we had to defeat Riddle. Voldemort, I mean.”
"Only your father. I don't mind your mother so much."
Draco shrugged. “A precaution, Potter. I might need to build a case against your tyrannical tendencies. And while you’re busy with Granger, I’ll need to borrow Weasley.”
Harry dug his hands into his pockets, trying to hide his surprise. "So you want that to be public knowledge?"
Harry felt himself tense. “Dunno. I suppose I’ll be civil to them if they’re civil to us.”
He huffed, but started walking with her back toward the mansion. “Which is?”
“I know. But Ron was afraid—well, he thought you might have different interests than his father. What aspects of the culture did you talk about? Was it all, er, financial?”
“Sorry, my love. That’s impossible. On both counts.”
“Come on, then.” Harry kissed him again, but Draco scarcely seemed to notice. “You’ve got a mobile, haven’t you? I do own one, but I don’t use it much, and I don’t even know if it will make international calls—”
"We have plenty of time to discuss this," Harry continued. "And I promise to take your feelings into account. But I'm the one who will decide on our surname."
Hermione shifted back toward the laptop, but somehow she couldn't let it go at that. The injustice of it galled her too much; there was no reason for Draco to pledge his service to Harry for the rest of their lives. Especially if they were dating—didn’t Harry want a relationship between equals?
Draco let out a long suffering sigh. A seriously exaggerated one. “If I wanted to forget about it or cancel it or anything like that, obviously I’d go to Granger. She hates the whole concept of it. I’m going to Weasley because he understands it and approves of it.”
“Don’t thank me yet. I don’t know how my parents will react. Ginny won’t like it either. And Bill—he might forgive Malfoy for letting Greyback into Hogwarts, but Fleur never will.”
He knew what Draco looked like in the middle of a breakdown too: Harry would never forget the sight of him sobbing in the bathroom or the haunted quality of his voice, despite his forced bravado, as he tried to bring himself to perform the killing curse on Dumbledore.
And apparently they were mates now. In Weasley’s eyes, at any event. Draco wasn’t sure he could truly be friends with the man, for the same reason he couldn’t truly be friends with Harry: they weren’t equals. He was too conscious of what he owed the Weasel. Not as much as he owed Harry, perhaps, but a great deal regardless.
“Bisexual,” his dad repeated. “That might take getting used to, but . . . well, of course it doesn’t matter. But his choice of boyfriend is problematic.”
Bill felt his eyebrows shoot up as he met Ron’s eyes. They both knew exactly what the other was thinking: neither of them had seen George laugh like this since Fred was killed.
“I’m Shira Baumgarten.” She held out her hand. “New York Baumgartens. My girlfriend and I are staying with Harry.”
But Lucius refused to be goaded. After one penetrating glance at his son, he turned back to Harry with a thoughtful expression. “Oh, Blair and Labour will triumph this June, as expected. Blair is popular, Hague hasn’t healed the divisions amongst the Tories, and no one wants to upset the apple cart just now. I imagine few people will even bother to vote.”
Shira snorted. "Don't be flattered, Jamie. Mostly he wanted to torture me."
“Do you want to see my memories of Dobby or not?”
Now Harry was even more confused. "Finances?"
“Come here, Draco.” Harry put his hands on Draco’s arms and tugged again. Gently.
Harry finally released him. “I know. It was back during the trials.”
That didn’t seem to make him feel better. He was still acting calm and indifferent, but he didn’t shake Ron’s hand off his arm and he even walked a little closer to him.
“No,” Ron said. “That is . . . well, we haven’t discussed that.”
“Or to screw with its genetics,” Draco muttered.
“How did you survive undercover for so long?” Ron rolled his eyes. “Hogwarts is safe enough, especially since no one expected us. But we’re out in the open.”
“Dunno. You should ask him.” Harry paused, looking both earnest and hopeful. “You, ah, seem to be getting on well enough. I mean, dinner with Ron and Hermione wasn’t torture for you, was it?”
Whatever. Malfoy took the chair without complaint, pulling the legs of his trousers up a bit as he sat down. Because of course he was sitting properly, even if he was still grimey from the explosion.
She nodded again, looking especially pleased to be let in on a secret.
“What, Hermione?” George rolled his eyes. “He is Harry's pet. His sex slave too, I gather. But it's all consensual, yeah?”
“I'm not. That undercover work was probably worse. Anyway, he tried to apologise to me, but I didn’t want to hear it. I told him we were okay, as long as he doesn’t disappoint you or Harry.”
Draco and Kreacher both stuck their heads out of the spare bedroom and peered down the first-floor hallway. Harry, Granger and Weasley were traipsing up the stairs.
That startled a laugh from Harry. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and grinned down at him. “Right.”
“Not an option,” Harry agreed. “Anyway, the mark has no more power. Voldemort is gone, even if he managed to leave his marks behind.”
“So you were in the field already?” Harry’s blood was starting to boil.
->*<-
Harry quirked his eyebrows at that. “Do you mean that?”
"Me too," Harry confided. "I know this—whatever it is between us—is moving fast, but . . . well, I'm glad you're here. Glad you're staying.”
Draco shifted, forcing Harry to lift his head and look him in the face. Those grey eyes of his were suddenly intent. “Is there something else you want to do?”
“Episkey!” Hermione went through several more of those as she healed the scrapes, bruises, burns and possible strains both Draco and Potter had incurred. The mudblood know-it-all had her uses.
Harry smiled again. "All right. I might have deserved that one."
Three or four people—no, just three—were walking upstairs. Granger was leading two others who shared the same loud and boisterous timbre.
Nothing would end the friendship between these two—Hermione knew they were too dear to each other—but she could almost feel the shift in their relationship.
"Yeah, unless we can convince them to start texting us instead."
“I couldn’t risk slitting your throat, Potter.”
“If that's what it takes to keep you from being an idiot, then yes.”
But he had been one. A much more committed Death Eater than Draco had ever been. So if Snape could cast a patronus, there was no reason Draco couldn't.
Draco did that thing he always did with his eyebrows: that weird but effective way he had of arching them. "Then I'm a better actor than I gave myself credit for."
But she didn’t remember moving and didn’t quite understand how she ended up where she was, in danger of being cursed by either or both men as they aimed for each other.
“You could do more work for us, you know.”
Ron shrugged. "No idea. And I doubt Harry's heard anything in New York."
“Except that the floor doesn’t make a good pillow.”
So Harry was smiling as he walked out of the master bedroom and down the stairs to the sitting room. No sign of Draco there, though, so he headed down further, to the ground floor, where he could hear Draco’s voice wafting toward him.
Harry smiled and scratched him behind the ears. "That's called a dooking sound, per this book. You're happy enough, then?"
"You stroking my hair?"
Harry didn’t bother to bite back his laugh this time. “Uh, I don't think muggle London will be shocked at the sight of two goths.”
Hermione sighed. “In fairness, he didn’t poison anyone or allow Death Eaters and a werewolf into Hogwarts.”
“Come’ere.” He pulled her down on top of him and kissed her soundly. “I don’t want to spend the whole night talking about Harry’s problems. Or the ferret’s.”
Harry regarded him with a thoughtful look . . . a look that turned almost devious after a moment’s consideration. “Well, perhaps more time with Hagrid will help you two appreciate each other. And he did mention that he could find some chores for you. I know just what you think of manual labour—”
"Don't, Malfoy," he warned. "And Ron, stop it."
Draco managed to sit up, more or less. He didn’t say anything, though. He just stared.
“Oh. So this is about my parents?”
Then he remembered the intense instruction on how to become an animagus, courtesy of Shira's aunt. Because it wasn't enough to follow the ritual, which took nearly nine months in his case. (He'd had to wait for the proper weather.) There was a certain amount of wandless magic involved too, assuming one was being forced to go undercover and needed to be as inconspicuous in animal form as possible.
“But Ron won’t break that confidence, Harry.” Hermione was leaning forward now, a strict and almost-McGonagall-like look in her eyes. “And you won’t ask him too.”
“Draco?”
Draco’s voice seemed carefully neutral as he responded. “Yes. They don’t think it was as recent as three years ago, when we were all awaiting trial. So more likely back when—well, you remember.”
Harry squeezed his hand. “Go on. It’ll start making sense as you say it.”
Malfoy turned back to him with a look of surprise—unpleasant surprise.
“Yes, but never mind. I’m in a forgiving mood.”
“What? Harry, what do you mean?”
He was about to step away from the doorway to make room for them when his eyes found Draco. For a moment, Hagrid just stood there staring, but then he shook his head in distaste.
"Don't change money there again." Draco looked surprisingly serious as they shuffled forward in the queue.
“Merlin, you're adorable,” George cooed. “Clever too. Tell the truth: you were the genius behind those Potter Stinks badges, weren't you?”
“Ambitious?” Harry felt his eyebrows shoot up.
Harry grunted. “I have them too sometimes. Could tell you about mine.”
Nothing. He swore through another cough as his stomach clenched. Harry could feel Malfoy breathing, so he knew he was alive. But he wasn't sure he was conscious.
“Well, he doesn’t!” Weasley stood his ground. “No use sugar-coating it. Remember how he made Hagrid’s life miserable, trying to get him sacked and gossiping to the Prophet? And never mind him and that vanishing closet and letting those monsters into Hogwarts—”
“Ah, the bar mitzvah should be interesting, I guess,” he managed. “I’ve never been to one.”
“Come on, Ferret,” Weasley took hold of his arm.
“How did you find out about me? Did Robards send you to my rescue?”
“I’ll walk him to the castle,” Weasley said again. He tightened his grip on Draco’s arm and turned them both toward Hogwarts proper.
He blanched. “I . . . I know that. I just meant—fuck, never mind.”
Draco scowled. “Because I wasn’t raised as an ill-bred muggle, taught to use fists instead of a wand.”
Oh no. Suddenly Ron understood. He glanced at Hermione, hoping she had some clever response, but she had turned white.
“It’s always going to be awkward, isn’t it?” Draco said at last. “Us talking about the war?”
“Potter here has placed us all under his protection,” Draco explained. “He’ll make sure you keep your liberty, Father. And he’ll make sure the Ministry doesn’t seize our home.”
Harry forced himself to pay attention again. Unfortunately, this didn’t sound at all like a style he would enjoy, especially when it came to gilding.
“But Draco is a ferret animagus,” Hermione said suddenly. “He has a special connection with ferrets. And, Hagrid, hippogriffs hunt ferrets and feed on them. They're natural enemies.”
He was a beautiful animal, no question, with an adorable, pointed and, yes, twitchy face—though hopefully Hermione would never remind him about the twitchy part. His whole sleek body was covered in gorgeous Malfoy-blonde fur. All except for the discoloration on the inside of his left foreleg, but Harry understood about that.
Harry bit back another grin as he rested his hands on Draco's waist. "Get off or . . . well, this book has a lot to say about proper ferret cages. I'm sure I could transfigure one for you. Might be just the thing for a time out—"
“Really?” Harry planted another kiss. “All my fault?”
Thunderstruck—that’s how Hagrid looked at the moment. Until his expression cleared, and suddenly it seemed as if pieces of an irksome jigsaw puzzle had just clicked into place for him.
“Yes.” The affirmation was out of Draco's mouth before he had even given it a conscious thought. He fought not to look embarrassed as he realised what he said. “Of course I do. You think I'd say no to the holy saviour?”
Harry stepped in front of Ron. “No hexes, George. No fists either.”
Draco was grinning back—hopefully not as stupidly—as he crossed over to Harry and knelt between his knees. His hands stayed steady as he started to undo the button and zipper of Harry's jeans.
“Thanks to a lot of us, Draco.”
"Kreacher," Ron continued, "we all overslept. And what happened . . . well, it wasn’t a disaster.”
->*<-
He didn't smell as musky and ferret-like as Bill expected, but that wasn't surprising. As soon as that picture appeared in the Prophet—the one of Harry holding Draco in his ferret-form and smiling down at him—Bill had done some research. A skilled animagus had considerable control over his animal form, so even though Draco-as-ferret seemed to be, er, whole, he could probably tamp down his scent and even keep himself from going into heat.
“I’m not—Draco, please.” Harry sounded annoyed now. “I’m not looking to hold the past against you, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
->*<-
"It was perfectly innocent," Granger insisted.
“Pretty sure your memories are a part of you.” He kept his voice light and teasing.
Harry had prepared for this moment. Draco had likely imagined—with considerable pleasure—Hermione delivering a blistering lecture. Possibly with a hex to drive the lesson home. But Harry was too experienced with Hermione to allow that; he knew just how to distract her.
Shit. The press didn’t know about the blackmail, did they? Would Skeeter uncover that too?
Harry grinned back. “Fuck you! I wasn’t. That was just a cover story.”
“I want them taken down! It’s just that Kreacher won’t hear of it.”
"I owed you and your family two of those," Potter said. "You didn't identify me to . . . to those other Death Eaters when you had the chance."
“Please stop. Do you want me out of your head? It’s all right if you do.”
Harry felt another irrational urge to contradict him, but he had enough experience with house elves to know that there was at least a little truth in his words. “That doesn’t bother you?”
Draco made a face. "Potter?"
"And now—shit, Potter, there are Scarhead groupies everywhere. You never shagged any of them?"
“I have, actually. Auror business took me into one—we were under cover, of course. But it wasn’t as large or so high up!” He paused. “Was this a first for you?”
“I’m sorry Master,” it said in a high-pitched, squeaky little voice. “Master Draco says if you are wishing to arrive at your office on time, you must be getting up.”
Draco bit his lip, and then tried to explain in greater detail. “All our religions, I suspect, are human ways of grappling with each other, and with ourselves, and with however we see the Divine. But I don’t think that makes them wrong, exactly. They all have plenty of faults, of course, but  that said . . . well, I’ve grown used to the Jewish way of grappling. Does that make sense?”
Harry laughed. “They didn’t disown Noa, did they?”
Harry smiled. “Do you suppose Anthony Goldstein had one? He didn’t invite any Gryffindors if he did.”
“About what? That you want to sleep with Ron and Hermione?”
Harry snorted. "Merlin, if you had come to me sixth year—"
Draco grinned. “When you supposedly had extra classes with him because you were doing so poorly in Potions?”
How was he supposed to answer that? It wasn't that Harry thought Draco was a coward, exactly. Not anymore. But he still wasn't the sort who would willingly hurl himself into danger. Especially without minions to protect him.
That raised a protest from Hermione. “I haven’t once ordered him around!”
"You won't take up with them again, will you?"
That, to Harry's astonishment, was the right thing to say. Ron let out a short but genuine laugh. "Yeah."
Draco looked down at his hand and furrowed his brow. “We should fix that. Let me get my wand.”
He shrugged. “All right. Try me.”
“I—Potter, I have no idea.”
"Rescuing you—that was all because of Harry," Granger added. "When he heard you screaming, he couldn't leave you like that. And we . . . we just followed him."
George, who had recovered somewhat, grinned up at them. “Stop. I refuse to let this conversation digress into interior decorating tips.”
Draco watched Shira the whole time. She seemed angry with 'this Robards guy,’ as she called him, impressed with Draco's undercover work, grateful to Harry . . . and not in the least bit jealous of Draco's new relationship with him.
She took his arm with a sigh. “Don’t worry, I doubt it will come to that. Let’s not despair—or plot—until we discover one thing.”
"They had already abandoned ship by then," Draco explained. "Bound me up with some impressive charms I'd love to reproduce, and rigged the house with a muggle bomb and some petrol accelerant that would destroy me, all evidence and any auror stupid enough to come after me."
“You deserved all that for eavesdropping.” He didn’t look in the least repentant. “And I managed to break your nose, didn’t I?”
“That’s fair, I imagine.” Harry’s face turned serious. “Um, what about you, then?”
"I know. You wrote
“I don’t want you sitting up at night worried, Draco. But I don’t want to get sacked either. I just want the aurors to do things differently.”
"Yes," he admitted. "No one at the Ministry would dare interfere—not if Potter ends up with it. More importantly, I trust our saviour here to hold it in trust for my heirs. I know he won't make a grab for it himself."
“When I visited you in Azkaban that first time. When you were waiting for your trial.”
“He died at the Battle of Hogwarts.”
“I know. But we—if we can get past our history together, we can get past anything.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed.
“I don’t suppose they’d take it.”
"What's wrong?" he managed. He didn't like the odd way they were both acting.
Harry couldn’t reveal everything he’d seen in Draco’s mind, but he reckoned that Draco would be all right with him sharing the good memories of New York City and that suburban synagogue.
A commotion woke him up. He almost bolted out of Ron’s shirt, but Ron grabbed hold of the scruff of his neck to keep him in place.
“You’re right. I’m really sorry about that. Um, I suppose this is a bad time to ask, but—”
“I don’t think I had even read the spell at that point,” Harry explained, sounding lame even to himself. “And if you really were willing to confess, I wouldn't have attacked you.”
That earned Harry a playful smack on the arm. "Mind yourself, Potter. And for your information, it was the indoctrination that ruined me, not the spoiling."
“No, he’s not.” Ron was giving him a thoughtful look now that seemed completely out of place. He only took on that particular expression during a game of chess. “And I think Hermione and I will need to join this boycott.”
“You do?” Draco sounded almost surprised. “Even in person? They weren’t, uh, too much?”
Harry’s mobile was ringing. It took a second or two for that information to sink into his sleeping brain, but at length he reached for it without bothering to open his eyes.
He looked astonished. Still terrified, but astonished too. But he nodded and, after a reassuring look from Harry, crossed the room.
“I don’t want your hints! I want—”
“I know.” His own face must be as red as Weasley’s by now. “And I won’t.”
“I know. I just don’t want him to obsess about it.”
For a moment, Harry didn't think Draco would answer. He'd probably had his fill of questions for the day. And this level of cooperation, at least with Harry and his lot, was a new experience for him.
“Only if you tell me!”
But Draco would have to learn how to cast the patronus charm. And re-learn how to apparate. Those spells could help any wizard out of a tight spot—and Draco was especially vulnerable. There were people who wouldn’t accept that the war was over, who still wanted revenge against anyone who had sided with Voldemort. And now there were neo-Death Eaters who knew that Draco had spied on them on behalf of the ministry.
“You don’t want people worshipping the saviour more than they already do?”
“Yeah.” Harry favoured him with a soft smile this time. “I don’t regret it, believe me. Whatever the fallout is. Anyway, it will probably be worse for Robards: the ministry is launching an investigation.”
“I’m not.”
“And what would I do here? Not to heal it, I mean. Just to . . . exist in it.”
He hadn't, not really. He should have guessed it, though. Especially considering some recent conversations. But there was still a great deal Harry had to learn about Draco.
Shit. That was Potter's voice. It sounded tired and a little hoarse, but also tinged with amusement. Draco turned in time to see him lean against the frame of the now-open office door.
Time to put him out of his misery. “I really like Benjamin and Noa."
“No idea, Potter. But that’s how important meditation is to occlumency. And she said that even whilst believing that muggles are far beneath us.”
“Kreacher is saying it is a great honour,” Toffee piped up. “He is promising that our heads will be mounted someday too, when we are finding ourselves too old to work.”
“He—” Harry broke off and straightened up. “He wouldn’t have told you that.”
Harry blinked. “Really?”
“I reckon so,” Harry agreed, staring up at Draco fondly.
They were gathered in the sitting room of Grimmauld Place. Hermione and Ron had snagged the rather, er, colourful chesterfield. Draco was sitting between them, but on the floor with his back against the chesterfield and his legs stretched out in front of him, crossed at the ankles.
"Yes. That's partly why my parents—and hers—think a marriage between us will work out."
"Are you still speaking to me, Harry?"
“I could shove you away, you know.”
Harry laughed again, but then his face grew serious. “Speaking of, er, disowning . . . I don’t suppose you’d be willing to meet your Aunt Andromeda? I know your mum’s not on speaking terms with her, but Andromeda’s grandchild—she’s caring for him, you know—is your second cousin or something.”
Harry’s never had a pillow fight before. He feels the laughter flow out of him like bubbles under water and the noise fills up the room. He feels light, like he could float to the ceiling and float back down. It isn't music but it's almost as brilliant.
Harry cringed at the name, he hadn’t really noticed till then how much people were calling him
Amos nodded. “—He’s always dancing. Can’t seem to stop him. God knows we tried.”
He’d never liked the house...because every so often a doctor or nurse would appear and Draco would know why. He never liked this because it would happen nearly everywhere in the largely built house. There was no escape from the men in white coats and women with blue gloves.
feelings a little too weird so he looks towards the mirror. He can see that Ron doesn’t do too bad of a job.
“Harry.”
“Delightful cousin you have there.”
“Thank you.” Harry grins.
“it’s not.” He defended the sport once more without reason.
“Well...maybe it’s all for the best.”
. He flinched as he noticed that Draco’s once straight pointed nose did in fact seem to appear slightly crooked. It was in such a way that might have been once worse and then pushed back into its proper placement. Harry still thought he looked a certain type of pretty. The word was odd to describe another boy but true even though he wasn’t sure how an eleven year old could pull off such elegance. Guilt seeped within him and he almost spoke up to apologise like he hadn’t the chance to during the incident.
Ron chuckles sadly and turns away. “Just go.”
“No...My Mom’s name was hyphenated.” He lied.
Time seemed to slow as Draco felt two insecure hands grab his waist before pushing him high.
He shrugged again. "You could ask Ginny that but she'd tell you it was bollocks too."
Harry soon realised he didn’t like Snape. The man was always sneering and for some odd reason didn’t sit right with Harry.
“It’s just punching Harry.
. The little boy with the scar. The kid who'd sewn jealousy within him once and then brought out a pure kind of love, and now he was expected to let that boy go. His brother, not of blood but of heart. Amos wouldn't do such a thing for anything other than Harry.
"Harry."
“Draco stay where you are! I’ll come get you.”
His voice was soothingly warm, like a fire or a cough-lolly.
“Don’t worry about him for now. In the meantime I can help you prepare on your own if you want.”
Harry hated to admit it, but those little afternoons spent amongst echoed music and muttered words were maybe some of the best. It reminded Harry of his and Draco’s first year, and how they practised in the senior rooms on Sundays, barely speaking and always working up a sweat. He coiled to admit these feelings but at least this time there was a lot less yelling and tensity.
“Technically.”
It was like he’d dug so deep within himself that he found a well. A well full of energy. One that when it was found just
A dance, A dance, A dance. A bonfire and the fears that follow. Thus music that washes it away. The practise and the issues that arise. Draco dances with a girl for the first time, cheering up the sad broken one. Harry admires and is asked he question that's been right in front of his eyes.
This was going to be one really long chapter about the entire first year but I decided to spit them yet again~ also I know nothing about what the school is actually like so don't @ me lol;3
“Your an—an idiot.” Draco bit down on his palm and his voice came out muffled and airy. “I’d never find—I’d never—”
Harry shrugged as he slipped on the shoes. "Dunno."
“I don’t need you!”
He looked back at Daniel who had spoken up.
The girl’s voice dimmed. “What do you mean?”
Cedric laughed from the kitchen. “He’s probably wanking!”
She shone her torch on his face but lowered it as he glared towards her in annoyance.
She smoked. “What did I tell you about those arms?”
Draco rolled his eyes. He was aware the only reason he’d been allowed to attend the royal ballet was because of his outward skill. He wasn’t amazing but he’d convinced his father he couldn't be a failure and such he was allowed. He’s sure if Greg and Vincent had even expressed an interest either of them would have been immediately sent off to some military school.
Snape watched his students and made sure not an ounce of surprise could be found in his expression.
The assembly had talked about the older years. Those students after sixteen were moved further into London near the theatres. Harry was glad for that. He’d never met many nice eighteen year olds.
Draco sighed from across the hall as his hosts continued.
He tried to imagine being with Seamus like that, and he almost could but it felt off. He could picture Dean looking proudly upon his friend with a wide smile, and Blaise with the same expression while looking in a mirror. Everyone seemed to have someone, even if that someone was themselves.
Harry walked amongst the regal walls to the faint sounds he was beginning to realise might actually be real. He was soon getting lost in the noise and hadn’t begun to notice his surroundings… until he felt his front collide with a box.
She walked inside and Harry had no choice but to follow.
place?” He remembered an anxious boy, panicked enough to let fist meet his nose.
“This is the only way! We have to take action before there's none of us left. Jerry crossed the picket line last week and I won't be having anymore!”
Amos knew it as late. He didn’t care. His legs ached and he flinched as the neighbours dogs barked at him but he didn’t care. He banged on the Weasleys door in a hurry.
Malfoy was sitting next to him, looking sore and bored.
He gulps. “How much is it gonna cost?”
A boot stomped on Harry’s delicate shoes. He jumped up and met the cold eyes of his new teacher.
Harry wondered if one day he'd look upon Hermione with pride like that. He tried to imagine but for some reason he just couldn’t picture it. In fact Harry couldn't picture Hermione Dancing in the future at all. It was a blank option.
“Dance!”
Harry felt as if the headmaster was looking right at
Harry didn’t bat an eye as he continued to warm up, already improved since the start of last year Draco could see.
“Fuck off.” He complied.
twenty hands.
Harry frowned. “Shut up. It was embarrassing.”
Harry’s mind sped up.
Oh when will my multi shipping arse end with the self indulgence~
The two ran past the grass fields in the rapidly approaching sunset towards the promised car. Cedric paced further ahead, preparing his groveling speech to his unsuspecting friend.
! I can’t find my shoes! they were supposed to be in the dressing rooms an hour ago and they're not!”
Harry had never seen a ballet class before. He’d always just assumed it was a bunch of girls in tutus prancing around. Well they
He’d find himself skipping every second step home. Running around much more that he used to.
Seamus grained as he bent forwards before speaking. “Guess we can’t be too hypocritical, I mean we do
“Draco was right. It’s unfair for me to be here stealing a spot I don't want.”
Someone helps him scale the fence and in a quick few seconds he’s running towards where he knows the bus goes. The mines.
Daniel seemed torn. “You sure Penny? I don’t think first years are allowed down these halls.
going.”
Lavender and the Patil twins seemed content in their big sun hats as they had the foresight to pack them. Hermione herself had a massive blue umbrella held above her head as she nibbled on her sandwich. Somehow it seemed Draco and Blaise had been allowed to share her shade though Harry was sure she only let them out of fear.
Snape never failed to point out one flaw made from either boy and Draco could only remember one time he didn’t outright insult their capabilities.
Harry mumbled. “The song
“Dad pulled me out of class.”
They fall to their knees weak. Both in tears. This is their heartbreak.
“She was beautiful.”
“Those songs are all crass and thuggish. They hardly count as music.”
She let out a ‘o’ and let him walk her back home.
“Who’s dress is that?”
Harry began to play the song. Clicking and bass came around the room and Harry began to understand. “Were ‘gonna practice with the music.”
Draco was pointedly avoiding the boy on his left. The same boy he couldn’t shake who somehow
Potter fake laughed. “Jokes on you! We don’t have any vases.”
“Harry!” A familiar smooth voice picked up.
"Don't mind the green eyes monster Harry." Her soft voice didn't sooth his shaky exterior.
The blonde scoffed. “I could mean anyone, we all know Hermione‘s dedication to practise.”
Dumbledore waved his hand around as he spoke. “I’ve always wanted the children of today to partake in the arts. A fine course of study and a fine course of life. This is why I am beyond pleased to inform everyone that this year we will have more students who will be taught than any other year before. I can feel the world of ballet waiting with open arms for all of you...
“You won’t get eaten by a bear for one.”
Like he once had before, Harry began to form a routine. He and Dean, who had turned out to be his roommate for the next year, would wake at seven for breakfast with the other boys. Dean would be sure to make as much noise as possible before they walked out, banging every bed frame and side table before sunrise. Their small class was rooming down the hall from the other boys meaning they would have to walk behind the others and wait for the rest of their year until they all ended up in their general classes. Around midday they would be sent to their gendered practises before combining. The boy's day would end at around six before they were left with free time. Dean had told Harry there was a curfew but Harry had never seen a single teacher enforce anything like that and was pretty sure it was a myth.
Harry didn’t know if his words derived from nervousness. “About what?”
Harry stood there in silence for a moment. He looked down at his aching leg relived to be on the ground one again. He looked around before lifting it up once more. He never thought a leg could look pretty.
"Stop whining."
He knocked the book over once.
“You wanna take him away! What about him? He's only a babe. What about his childhood?”
“Pardon?”
He ponders for a moment. “Aren’t you a bit old miss?”
He had to be seen by a doctor or physician or something before the audition. He didn't really listen. All he knew was that two men walked around him and measured his height and arm length.
Harry looks up. The sky is gray. Harry wonders if everyone hears their own music all the time. He wonders if dancers do.
“I don’t know why you even go in, you're gonna get kicked in.” Ron spoke truthfully.
Draco wore his heart on his sleeve. Worked harder than anyone else and Snape almost felt sorry for pairing him up with Potter.
Sometimes Harry wished there was a way to listen to music and run at the same time, he thinks he’d run faster if he could. He probably did't really need it though. He had his own personal soundtrack.
Ron eyes it curiously.
of us won't fail on stage.”
Harry had never practised something so hard before in his life. He hardly used the piano anymore and he couldn’t be arsed with what they were learning at school, so
She looks around before lowering her voice. “You know I'm moving out of White lodge right? Th—this is goodbye.”
Snape, who was helping Theodore spoke up. “There will be
Harry thinks he feels time scattered, little pieces he picks up and discards to remember later. He’s glad to know that there was a before.
“Yeah. You?”  Harry sighed relieved it was just another school kid.
Molly crosses her arms. She can see the temper runs in the family. “Excuse you! This is not for my gratification.”
"She doesn't have sex with him, 'cause he slept with a lass from his work. I heard about it. I think they like to yell."
Harry grimaces. “Is that all you think about? Mines.”
outside of their own personal practises.
Ginny sighs. “Harry do you not fancy me?”
TW- Description of an injury but not that graphic
Snape drawled. “Has anyone here practised contemporary before?”
—I don’t know what you're talking about.”
Harry's first day goes a little unexpectedly as a familiar face pops up with lies on his tounge and a teacher who seems to sneer when he sees him.
Blaise didn’t look up. “Going to France.”
Draco would continue to wonder what the other boy might have said days after, it would have been his last mundane thought before his life changed.
“I’m not sure. Ginny says I could be. Your Mum says she’s never seen a single good Ballet dancer leave her class.”
Time hadn’t stopped though. Draco's father seemed to look between the two boys before turning to his son with a raised eyebrow. “Draco. Who is this?”
