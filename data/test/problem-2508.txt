That's one thing I would have never imagined. Me sitting on Draco Malfoy's bed in his dorm room next to him. I suppress a shudder.
"If you stop bothering me I'm going to…" She made a dramatic pause for effect. Malfoy rolled his eyes. "I'm going to keep your secrets."
"Have you ever seen someone fall asleep in less than five seconds?" The Slytherin asked scoffingly. He noticed that his heartbeat was fairly normal again. It was probably all thanks to Potter and her stupid pinching. Or the fact that she was saying stupid things.
"I mean it," she added, thinking that she should try to find something nice for the girl during her next Hogsmeade visit.
"Picking on you," he continued, in a bored tone. "I've got tired of it."
Draco scoffed. "I think I have a good reason to be." He sat down opposite Luna again, scrunching up his brows.
Snape sighed, closing his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again he looked incredibly tired. "There is nothing you can do, Draco."
was floating before her inner eye.
"What?" Haley finally looked at him, completely taken aback. She hadn't expected something like that. She hadn't expected him to be this… considerate.
. If he had to choose one moment he had to relive again and again until he died he would choose this. Here and now. Kissing this infuriating girl that he had initially despised. And now? Now she meant the world to him.
"Fine. I'll make an exception this time." She tsk'd. "Password?"
Haley chuckled. He was just a
There was a quiet
Clearing her throat awkwardly, Haley picked up the book and turned toward the two people who'd surely witnessed the scene. "Um… hi…" She greeted them nervously, her gaze meeting Draco's for no more than a split second. Then he returned to his book again, as if nothing had interrupted him.
"No." She shook her head. "How would I?"
"Okay. I promise, too." She breathed, taking her hand almost in awe. "Gryffindor's honour."
"I told you, it was an emergency." Haley sighed. "And I missed only two classes yesterday."
"I guess you're right," I say instead. I've never thought about it like this before.
"I think you've got your answer," Hermione said with a smirk. Haley bit her lips shyly. She was one step closer to making a decision.
. Hermione noticed Haley grabbing Malfoy's hand. It seemed like an almost unconscious action. Like she was intuitively seeking the boy's comfort. And Malfoy? There was a fond smile on his face. And his eyes… they were resting solely on Haley. Ron took that moment to find his voice again.
was doing to him. To his heart that was so hopelessly gone for her.
As far as Haley remembered, Agatha was the girl Simon liked. She groaned. "Please don't tell me you're part of a love triangle. You're far too young for that."
Neville glanced down at his and Draco's intertwined hands. Haley swallowed. She did want Draco to get his magic back. But she also didn't want either of them to get hurt. Any more. They didn't even know if the potion actually worked. Was it really worth the risk? What if Neville lost his magic as well?
Draco shrugged. "That spell is useful for something at least. Tell me you've read my mind and brought me food."
"What are you saying?" He whispered.
"I think it's a brilliant curse if it makes sure the bad guys are punished." Simon cut in, mouth filled with chocolate.
something I've been wondering about," I muse.
I turn around, seeing the Slytherin jog toward me. I hold up my arms in front of me like a shield. Malfoy doesn't stop. A second later, red flames burst from my fingers and create a hot wall of fire between me and the boy. That makes him stop at last.
"But-" Before she could even say another word, she found her mouth full of leaves and petals.
"Right. I hope it will work out for you. You deserve some happiness," she gave her hand a squeeze, "And don't forget to tell me once you've figured it all out."
"Probably because of Malfoy," Fred commented. Haley almost choked on her pumpkin juice. Had George told him? Was he insane? "We've seen him earlier. Limping his way to Madame Pomfrey. Wish we knew what happened to
"What? Sirius asked you to spy on me?"
with Malfoy. Almost too good to be true if she was honest. But she would take what she got. What other alternative did she have? She didn't want to keep pondering about the way her godfather had reacted. About the way he had looked at her. Eyes filled with disappointment and anger. It would just make her sad.
"Hermione? Is that you?" Haley asked hoarsely. She hated how small her voice sounded. There was an additional weight next to her. Then a hand, squeezing her own quickly.
Draco sighed. "Fine. Meet me at the tree house, okay?"
He smirked. It made her shudder somehow. "Then that means you can share something else with me."
"What?"
"What else was I supposed to say? I didn't know what to do! I still don't know…" She bit her lips anxiously. This was so frustrating. Hermione smiled at her warmly.
“Hello darlings, what can I get you?” Asks a warm voice suddenly. I know that voice. I turn my head so fast, I almost fall off my chair.
"Hello Draco," the girl greeted him without acknowledging the book. Her priorities were really messed up. On the other hand, Draco approved of her insistence on greeting him above all else.
Malfoy strokes a hand over the girl's face slowly. It looks almost like a caress. But that's not possible. On top of everything the git also starts to smile at the girl!
"Because you're the one who tricked me!"
"So…" he started to say, trying to return to the point.
He frowned. "Is there something wrong with your hand?"
"You were right." She admitted with a sigh. "It was about Malfoy." It felt so embarrassing to admit it out loud! Her cheeks were burning up, too! "Just the thought that he's been thinking about me like that all this time makes me sick! That's why I've been so tetchy this morning."
"Oh." Neville didn't say anything more than that. Almost as if he understood already.
"Watch out!" Someone shouted near her. Haley turned around, to find Neville crash into her forcefully. With her right hand she managed to hold onto a nearby table, preventing them from falling over.
!" He insisted. "Why can't you just leave it alone and go? It's useless. My own father would disown me if he knew what a failure of a son he had. What good am I without magic? Who'd want someone like that? A pathetic disappointment. That's all I am. A broken, miserable-"
Fleur darts her eyes at him, smiles a little, relieved that he’s chosen to trust her with this.
"But that's just the problem, Haley!" He gripped her shoulders urgently. "You're not even giving me a chance. Maybe I
"Get off me, Potter!" He yelled angrily, trying to push her off him. But she didn't move an inch, sitting on his stomach and gripping his wrists tightly.
"But you did! You think I'm stupid for trusting him. That I'm too naive to see that he's using me for some nefarious Death Eater plot, am I wrong?"
He glances from her to the heap of shiny stones in all colours of the rainbow. His hand hovers above the stones for a moment, indecisively.
Malfoy exhaled soundly, "Is that...all right…?" He asked tentatively.
"What?" I blink at her, realisation sinking in slowly, "That's why I've been feeling so tired lately, isn't it?"
Right. There had been something in her hand. She'd thrown it into the grass, before leaving. Draco knelt down and started to look around in the grass. With the setting sun it was quickly becoming dark around him but the thing couldn't be far. Then he saw it. It really was nothing special. Just a note. Folded together tightly. He picked it up and began to unfold it eagerly. It wouldn't be cursed, would it?
"Why didn't you tell me?"
Malfoy glares at me even more than he did when I suggested inviting myself. Well, damn.
to take your side!"
"The gobstone, you stole from me, you mean?" She replied sweetly, buttering her toast with more force than would have been necessary.
"I'll be more friendly next time, promise," she said, trying to hide her exasperation. Why couldn't he let it go already? Hermione could be back any second now.
"No." Haley shook her head again. "But you are."
Haley snorted. "That's not even funny."
"Merlin, Hermione! I can only answer one question at a time!" Haley quickly weighed her options. Maybe she could answer some of the questions without lying. Well, she didn't have to answer
like the sun, always putting a smile onto her face.
"Simon," I say. My voice sounds slightly wobbly.
. With a pout Draco sank back against the wall next to her.
With a sigh, Haley urged Malfoy to continue walking.
"there are really only two options. Well – three, if you consider melodramatic pining an option. But who would do that?"
"You weren't supposed to tell her that, Hermione!" Ron complained.
"I don't know," he answered uncertainly. "Do you want to go back?"
Haley bit her lips nervously. "I…" She started to say. "It's not what it looks like?" Her statement came out like a question. Which was fitting, seeing as she didn't even know what it
(See the end of the chapter for
So much for putting on a cool and indifferent mask. He had tried that for a few seconds. But in the end he had lost the battle against the ambush of his feelings.
"How is any of this my fault?" Draco fired back. "It's not like I – suddenly decided to have feelings for her. It just happened! You can't choose who you fall in love with." He bit his lips. He hadn't meant to say that. But it was the truth, he realised. He was
The realisation made Draco's face fall. "Right. Quidditch." He chuckled humourlessly. "That's important. You have to be there, of course." He encouraged her. But his voice sounded strangely hollow.
" He yells. "
"I – they weren't for me," she stammered helplessly.
"Why?"
"Hedwig?" I ask stupidly. I'm still not all there.
Haley hadn't even heard the bell, but it seemed Professor Snape had arrived already.
"I see," Lovegood said with a sceptical undertone.
"A lot of people kiss others just for the sake of it," she interrupted her almost harshly, "Kissing is something that just feels good, I guess. You don't need to be in love to enjoy it."
you." He was whispering now. "It didn't take me long to realize why the sight of your unharmed face every morning filled me with such relieve. Or why I caught myself staring at you more often than I was not."
"And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way. Lead on." And with that Umbridge left her office, keeping Haley and Granger at wand point.
"It's nothing, I just -" Images flashed before her eyes. Cold grey, eyes. Merciless laughter. Long blond hair behind a black mask.
Then he felt a sharp pain in his arm. Almost like someone had pinched him. Draco turned to lie on his side.
"It's fine, Neville, I knew you already had that card."
Malfoy raises an eyebrow at me. "Search him," he suggests, with a nod into Neville's direction. It's astounding how quickly he found his confidence again. But I'm not done with him. Not by far. I smile back at him, which seems to reassure him somewhat.
"Yes," Malfoy said, grinning amusedly, "I do."
With that thought in mind Haley closed her eyes and waited for sleep to come.
"It's not a myth!" She argued. "I'll show it to you. You'll see!" Her outburst could almost be called passionate. It was cute somehow. Her conviction. He smiled.
"I'm… a bit tired," she mumbled, her eyelids drooping again.
When she pulled away for a much needed breath, he growled impatiently and pulled her back down, hand warm on her neck. It seemed she wasn't the only one who found the kiss intoxicating.
"I could be wrong, but… I think that you're one of those people who –"
"Come sit with us, dear. The knitting is really relaxing," the older witch invited her.
us – Ron and me that is – a study break. But that's almost over." She said dramatically.
. But from his grumpy tone she figured it might be Hermione. And although, his tone annoyed her, for once she actually agreed with him. What
. "Put me down, or I don't know what I'll do!"
The girl was right. Haley had almost looked like she was about to faint. It had been so hard not to run to her side and make sure she was okay.
"At the grave yard," she whispered to the floor, "Malfoy… he was there, too."
"What do
The days following that conversation Haley kept trying to come up with solutions for her problem. It was harder than she had anticipated. The fact, that she was half-asleep most of the time because she kept spending her nights behind a certain Slytherin's dream door didn't help her case. Quite the opposite. Although, she was having fun during those dreams.
The laughing became louder and more hysterical by the second. Haley wanted to run but she couldn't leave Cedric here alone with them. And then… he was right in front of her. Voldemort.
"As I said, back in fifth year, there was a boy at Hogwarts who would always harass me and bother me and – well he was constantly up in my face, announcing he was there. You'd have to be a troll to miss his presence. It really drove me nuts!"
Haley groaned. George Weasley – or was it Fred? – had appeared at her side. He was chewing an apple noisily.
, he thought. Luckily Draco's noble background allowed him to step on the ground in the most soft and elegant of ways.
"Stop that." He frowned, his gaze focusing on her now. "What's… wrong with you? You're usually not this…" he trailed off, a soft pink blush dusting his cheeks. "Well, not like this."
"Mm. I like it," he says, grinning triumphantly. There's a mad glint in his eyes that makes me slightly uncomfortable. What is he planning?
"The gillyweed!" That's what the boy had been talking about! Now she knew where this was going. Except… no she still didn't have an idea.
Without actively making the decision, Haley picked up a quill, dipped it into her inkwell and wrote two words.
"I like this table. Nobody ever comes here, so I can do my homework in peace, without having people steal my notes or hiding the books I need." The way in which she stated these facts sounded strangely neutral. She wasn't looking for pity or help. It was just the way things were.
"Luna! I didn't mean to confront you like this but you leave me no choice!"
"Come on, Ron," Haley said quietly and pulled at his sleeve.
Draco looked around in alarm. Had someone heard her? He felt the urge to shush the Ravenclaw but he was sure she would just ignore it. She tended to always say what she wanted to anyway.
"Of course, master Draco!" The house elf exclaimed joyfully, jumping up and down and almost stumbling over his own feet in his eagerness to comply. Huh. For the first time, it felt as if the elf was genuinely happy to help him instead of doing it out of sheer dutifulness.
"Wow, that's amazing!" He exclaims, looking at his face from every angle. After, what might be hours he trots back to me, still beaming and gets seated on the bed beside me.
He nods. "In my imagination I go back to that night and dance with you and hold your hand and-"
"Who said that? Who made you think it was a mistake?" She asked, sounding indignant.
"Fine, I'll help." She offered. "I can… stand guard outside."
"-that we're really tired of school lately," finished George.
Followed by the sound of urgent footsteps, Simon returned along with Lily and Professor Snape.
He leaned close to her and whispered in her ear, "I'll tell the house to let you in."
"Shut up," she muttered irritatedly.
"Yeah, we're – we're in the same house," Michael said to the window. Luna eyed him curiously over her magazine. But she didn't say anything.
But the Hufflepuff was stopping her. And with a hand on her wrist at that!
Hastily, Haley got up. For a moment longer she could hold them in. The feelings. There was no way, she was going to let Snape see her cry. Before the door had completely closed behind her, she swore, she heard him say, "Bloody teenagers." She didn't linger to check.
"What is it, birdie?"
"Yeah… remember our Anti-Umbridge meeting?"
"My shirt? Are you sure that's what you wanted to tell me? You like my shirt?"
That short statement almost knocked him out. "What?" He asked weakly.
. Well in the left corner of the front page anyway. The full title was:
"I…" She started sheepishly. "I'm… not sure… it's Valentine's Day," she whispered, not looking at her friend.
Still grinning, she shook her head. The boy took another sip of his sugar tea and watched her warily.
He nodded.
Draco nodded absently, before getting up and lifelessly marching in the direction of the hall.
But I figured it would have disrupted the whole flow of the chapter. So, you get it as a sort of outtake :D And earlier in the chapter I first wrote chocolate "ship" muffin, which was stupid of me. But for ending this on such a bittersweet note y'all deserve a laugh :)
It wasn't a bad idea. There probably wasn't much else she could do at the moment anyway. At least she'd be out of his hair like this.
"What about Malfoy then?" She asked, deciding to humour her.
"So, where are you headed looking like this?" Mum asks curiously.
" Malfoy hisses angrily, getting to his feet in one quick move.
Wow, that helps a lot. Well, it actually helps a little bit. "Little Prince?" I ask confusedly. Mum nods toward my painting. I snort. Paint-Draco does look similar to the little prince from that French story.
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow. "I wanted to keep this as brief as possible."
"I don't remember asking you, Zabini. We all know you've got the hots for that French veela girl. I was asking Goyle." Malfoy interrupts, looking at me expectantly. "Now, Goyle."
Haley snorted. She couldn't help it. Her mum was strict indeed. But that didn't mean she wasn't above breaking a few rules every now and then. Hermione didn't look convinced.
She was slightly surprised to find the Slytherin waiting for her in front of the oak front doors. She wouldn't have put it past him to stand her up. Pity he hadn't.
"You've heard of it before?"
The girl's eyes wandered across the slightly crumpled letter with a frown. "Another one? What did Haley say when you showed her?"
She took a step closer to him. "Um… it's not really made for more than one person. So, we'll have to huddle together a bit." Draco grinned. He didn't exactly have a problem with
"Professor Snape – oh – sorry – I didn't know you were…" He said in surprise, glancing from Snape to her slightly surprised.
Hermione.
Draco bit his lips and looked away. He couldn't stop the heat rushing into his cheeks. It seemed to be all the confirmation he needed.
"Ah! So this is how you make a heel!" Hermione exclaimed, triumphantly. Haley turned her head to see what had caused her friend to say something so strange. The other girl was sitting by the fireplace with Mrs Weasley who was apparently giving her knitting tips.
It was Neville. And just for a second, when his familiar scent surrounded her and she saw his blue eyes from up close again, like before – like when everything was normal, when there were no dreams or fights or lost magic – she wished herself back. To that simpler, less complicated time.
" he said with a carefree laugh that was so infectious that Haley found herself laughing along with him. Even if it was completely absurd.
With a wave of her wand, and a whispered spell, Hermione made the needles and the thing she was knitting sink to the table. It was weirdly quiet without the clicking of the needles.
"Oh, that." She gave a dismissive wave. "That's not really personal."
For the first time I wonder, if this might actually be wrong. Am I going too far? He can't even defend himself. He doesn't know that he's dreaming or that I'm here. That I'm actually
No. "What are you doing? It's yours!" He protested, shaking his head violently.
"Well… considering we're trying to revive his magic with this potion, a reaction like that really isn't surprising," Lily mused. "Strong magic like that takes its toll on the body."
But even more peculiar was the person standing in the midst of the trees. It was a boy wearing a pale pink shirt with long sleeves that seemed two sizes too big for him and a pair of light blue shorts.
. Anything you want to hear. Just
"I'm so sorry," Haley whispered, stepping forward and hugging her best friend tightly. It seemed like a dam had broken, as the other girl fiercely clutched her back and poured out her heart against her shoulder.
Something was tugging at his arms. Was that Potter? He pulled away slightly to look at her.
At least not to the boy she had visited in his dreams. He was so different from the mean, despicable git that had made her life a living hell. Intruding on
It looks a bit like the Wronski Feint.
"Are you sure that would be okay?" Emily asked shyly.
about you. Which is kind of understandable. From
. And is that a mane? My head looks like a lion's head.
"Gloves!" She burst out, suddenly hit with an idea. "Can you teach me how to make gloves?" The raven-haired girl asked excitedly.
The look of disappointment and betrayal on my brother's face almost breaks my heart. I turn to Hedwig for help. But the room is empty except for me and Simon. Typical. Throwing a bomb in front of my feet and then leaving me alone with it. I would give anything if I could finally wake up now. It feels like I've been dreaming for hours. Although I've technically been sleeping I've rarely felt this tired in my life.
Haley flinched. "Hermione! Do you want to give me a heart attack?" Her friend had appeared out of nowhere. Like when she had temporarily used that time-turner.
Haley carefully opened her eyes. She was on the ground, blinking up at the cat turned boy again in confusion. He was sprawled all over her, his teeth bared. "Um…" She didn't know what to say. Had he turned back mid-jump? That must have looked impressive.
"I'm going to blackmail him." He grinned smugly. "If Umbridge found out he was in possession of something this dark, she would surely fire him, don't you think?"
"The headmaster has ways to protect your mother," Snape interrupted him. "Should you choose… the unexpected path." He turned around in his seat and opened a drawer behind him. When he turned back he had a plain white envelope in his hand. "Neither path will be easy. But be aware that once you have made your choice, it cannot be undone."
"It's hard to understand, I know that." The girl continued. Hard? More like
annoying. Was there a problem with his ears? It seemed as though she would have to take matters into her own hands. She grabbed his collar and silenced him in a way that actually worked.
"We would have been caught by Filch without it."
"What kind of mirror is that?" Haley asked another time.
She should at least let him explain. After that, she could still decide whether to dump him or not.
"Of course," he said mechanically, grabbing Weasley's arm and snatching his wand out of his pocket.
"He's
"They were from two worlds, if you will. But instead of letting that keep each other apart they carved out a third one. A world that was their own. Where no one could touch them." He paused, reaching for his own cup and staring into it, as if the rest of the story was reflected on the surface.
"I was… but I kind of understand it now. Why you did the interview."
Swiftly, Professor Snape flew to the boy's other side and deftly checked his vital signs. "He is merely unconscious. But that was to be expected." He said calmly.
What? Had she gone completely insane? Normally Draco would never have listened to such a crazy suggestion but there was something in the girl's eyes that told him, she knew exactly what she was talking about.
Malfoy shook his head and looked away. "Never mind," he muttered.
"Exactly," She interrupted him with a pointed look. At this rate, he was going to let the whole castle know. "Which is why I… kind of need your help. Come with me for a second?" She asked, a tinge of urgency creeping into her voice.
"Nothing," she offered nonchalantly.
His lips were still gentle but something was different about the way he kissed her. The hesitancy from before was mostly gone now. It felt more confident somehow. The fingers of his right hand were interlaced with her own and he angled his head to the side so he was able to reach her lips better. It was strange how little it bothered her that her glasses were sort of piercing the side of her face or that her hair tie was pressed against the back of her head in an uncomfortable way.
I jump down from my broomstick. My feet make the slightest of sounds when they hit the earth. Standing right behind Malfoy, I feel like some kind of super hero or villain with my cape floating dramatically behind me. It really does add a nice touch.
"The expression. It's actually 'For Slytherin's
The timing of that boy was terrible. They had been in the middle of kissing, hadn't he noticed that? He seemed to be in a state of shock, the way he was just standing there, his eyes wide and mouth gaping open. He looked rather stupid like that. For some reason Haley was copying that expression. It didn't suit her. It looked funny though. He grinned despite the tension surrounding them.
Malfoy lets him go without protest.
“Portkeys don’t come cheap,” Ron observes, voice low and tone noteably flat. Harry spares a thought to wonder if it’s his friend’s typical reaction to ostentatious displays of wealth that is driving his reaction or interest in the other Coven’s response.
Fred slipped too, he was already on the verge.
Before Fleur can answer, however, Bill glances up at Harry and freezes instantly, obviously simultaneously taking in the distress he’s emitting.
Can you check on George every hour or so?
Unable to sleep, Harry lays on his side on the bed Fleur had just vacated where he can keep an eye on the other Omega, who doesn’t stir, not once, until morning.
Tonks is going to head over to Bill’s later this afternoon.”
“Poor Susan,” Harry breathes and George nods.
And personality, maturity, experience with Omegas…all of these things seem to be things that indicate whether an Alpha is susceptible to it.
Do you think we need to have a Healer on hand?”
Remus stands, rummages in a trunk that is pushed up against the wall.
His scent is threaded with just the faintest touch of anxiety, but the look he levels on the two Slyhterin Alphas is calm as anything and Harry has to give him credit.
Bill looks over at Fred who has been silent so far and the younger Weasley raises an inquiring eye before seeming to realize by Bill’s pointed expression that he’s being asked to leave and give him some privacy with the two Omegas.
“He’ll give you gifts,” Ron says, unexpectedly.
At just this moment, they both get distracted as both Seekers simultaneously dive for the pitch.
If there was one thing he could depend on Hermione for, it was that he knew she would never question his own bodily autonomy.
Easy to talk to, too.
As soon as you get a whiff of the Fight-scent, you’ll be out of your head, and another Omega is the last thing Fred and Bill need to be added to the mix.
“It’s awful to be unpresented Harry.  He’ll probably never understand why he feels so left out and why he can’t seem to get ahead in the world.  Since everything is done via Covens, people will go out of their way to exclude him from parties, companies, anything where they would be prevented from interacting according to their true dynamics.  He’d be living a lie and he’d never know it.”
A thousand times, no.”
“They have power over me, don’t they? Alphas?” Harry finally asked the question directly, acknowledging that he already kind of knew.
“It was one of your mother’s nesting blankets,” Remus informs him.
But yes, George, you do, eventually.
They’ve never really interacted before.  Sure, they have classes together, but the Houses don’t tend to mix much, especially Gryffindor and Slytherin.  Notts always been a loner too, not ever really adhering to Malfoy’s primacy in the Slytherin hierarchy and thus not making too many Slytherin friends.  Harry’s new, weird sense tells him that the other boy is an Alpha, and it’s a hot, intense sensation, one that perks his attention.  He felt something similar standing in Fred’s presence earlier, and it’s distinctly different than the almost calming sensation that George gave off and the fairly uneventful ones he’s been getting from Ron and Angelina.
It’s from Terry Boot of all people, a Ravenclaw Harry hasn’t given more than a thought to aside from the time the boy had accidentally dropped frogs legs into a potion and sprayed himself and three other Ravenclaws in collateral damage from a mutated shrinking potion that kept their torsos undersized compared to the proportions of their limbs for days before Madame Pomfrey found a permanent solution after consultation with some Healers from St Mungos.  Snape had been so furious he had docked Ravenclaw 100 points for the error.
Of course, I’m hoping for at least several weeks between cycles, but it’s already worth it.”
“How are you getting along then, Harry?”
“But —“
Harry wasn’t sure if it was the length of time the Trio had proposed or if Malfoy had just changed his mind about Courting him altogether, but the Gryffindor was feeling strangely forlorn about the whole situation.
“I do not want to watch you snogging with Malfoy.”
Harry’s had an argument with Hermione.
“I’ll talk to her.
you.”
Fred, though, is quiet.
“We’ve been friends a long time.  I may be strong-willed and obviously so are you, but we’ve been able to navigate each other’s strong wills for years.  I think we could have found a balance that worked for us both being Alphas in the same pack.  If you had presented Beta, there also wouldn’t have been any issues but neither Dumbledore or I thought that likely.”
He smiles dopily and Bill chuckles, rubbing his thumb back and forth across the back of his neck.
Fred, have you ever thought how you would feel if you Presented Omega instead?
After two hours, around 10 pm, Hermione gave the Coven the signal to head over to the Quidditch Pitch.  Harry had noticed other older students discretely removing themselves from the Great Hall for the last 30 minutes or so.  Making his excuses to Neville (and ignoring the strong thread guilt that wracked through him for it), Harry met up with the Coven in the corridor outside and the all traipsed down to the Quidditch Pitch….
He meet’s Fred’s eyes without concern, vanishing the proposal with a flick of his wrist, and Harry takes a moment to admire his friend’s mastery of the wandless magic, even if it is a relatively simple spell.
She casts the Patronus while Harry anxiously considers using his Firebolt to run a sweep of the property.
But I fear she took advantage of the agreement and used magic anyway, and did not enlighten me as to her deceit.”
“You do,” Vincent confirmed again.  “And you also have the right to call in the COA if you feel your Alpha has crossed any lines or that the Coven is an unsafe environment.  We are your official advocates, and trust me, Harry, we will do right by you.  I will leave you my work address and you may always reach me by owl post or, in dire scenarios, Floo.”
It’s an unlikely approach for the Malfoy heir and the entreaty is honest enough.
“It’s worth a shot.
“It’s easier, sometimes,” she continues, “to think of it as some other creature that you have to keep content in order to live the life you want to lead.
Groaning he turns to head back to the Common Room.   But Theodore Nott is standing directly in his path.
They're both in Fight."
Smith spins away and marches down the corridor.
“Fine, ‘Mione.”
“Olive should be in the thick of it by mid-afternoon,” Padma is saying.
“Mum hightailed it out of the way, dragged George with her.
I know about your …. erm… gift?”
“Yes,” Vincent confirmed solemnly.  “Omegas enter formal mating arrangements instead of marriage like Betas and some Alphas choose to engage in.”
“My inheritance?” Harry wrinkled his nose, confused.  This was honestly the last subject he had expected to be addressing with his friend today.
“No kidding.  That’s why we decided to make our own Coven.  We didn’t know what you’d present as but as long as it wasn’t an Alpha, we figured we’d be in pretty good shape and even if you did, we figured you’d probably be able to make it work as a Sub, given how close we all have been and what we’ve been through together.  We weren’t sure if we would have anyone else at first, but we weren't super upset at the idea of just the three of us.”
And the more time you spend with him, the more susceptible to his Voice you’ll be.
Hermione’s quiet.
Will you trust me?”
“So what you’re telling me is that I’m your second choice,” Harry cuts in, raising his brows high as he waits for Boot’s stumbling reply.
He is my Alpha and I am his Omega and he will lead our household, but he isn’t my Master, he’s my Partner.”
Presumably this is common enough an occurrence that you would take care to ensure you wouldn’t be caught in such a position.”
“I’m familiar,” Harry noted dryly, before signing the sheet swiftly, tamping down on his wince and handing the quill back.
She does.  He breathes in and out, in and out, the way he used to when he was hiding in his cupboard as a kid, running away from Dudley or trying to comfort himself after another one of Aunt Petunia’s cutting remarks.  The breathing helps and after a few moments he manages to look at the other Gryffindor again.
Harry firmly clasped his hands over his ears and stuck his tongue out at her, crossing his eyes.  Caught off guard she laughed, Ron sniggered, and the tension was broken.
“Assuming I don’t go into my first post-Bonding cycle.
“As you wish Weasley,” Nott says.
Quietly he affirmed his Second’s last statement. “Yes, I will obey.”
He’s starting to feel more himself.
"It's ok, you have instincts too," Harry parrots back Ron's words from earlier.
Hermione nodded decisively. “I would, but I would prefer to wait for my Second.”
Distantly, he hears Ron barking at Hermione, stepping in between the two of them to confront Hermione head on, and Hermione backing away slowly.
“It’s hard but I guess there’s nothing to be done.  Ernie even paid for a specialist to come to Hogwarts to advise.  The Healer said that my short cycle is just a natural result of my high fertility and he should be grateful at having acquired such an Omega for his Coven.  Ernie fired the asshole, of course, but Madam Pomfrey had already told me something similar - in much more polite terms - so unfortunately it seems like this is just something I’ll have to learn to live with until I’ve Bonded and my season levels out.”
“Yea, so we are.”
“I’ll leave that for another time, but its one of the many advantages Bonding provides an Alpha and Omega pair to better allow Alphas to protect Omegas.”
When George comes out of it, he tells Harry that all the Omega’s will learn the spell but they’ll make a rule that it can only be used once an hour.  It’s too dangerous to become mentally dependent on it, and the Omegas already spend too much of their seasons begging for things they can’t have.
“It wasn’t because of all the angry Alphas in the room? Pushing you to do it?” Ron presses, tone reluctant, and Harry fails to suppress his irritation.
“It…..yea.  When I’m fighting the Imperius, I can hear these two battling voices - the one is the order, telling me what the caster wants me to do, but the other is my own.  If I’m in the right state of mind, I can choose which to follow.  This …. there weren’t any voices.  I didn’t…I didn’t think about it, I just responded.  When you told me to stay, my body just stopped….”
“Omega Potter,” he says, pulling Harry’s hand up to linger by his mouth, where his warm breath tickles the hair on Harry’s fingers, “Your beauty is a treasured sight,” he says, pressing a kiss to the top of Harry’s hand and lingering there a touch.  Harry can’t help but feel just how much more intimate a greeting that was than what Fred had offered.
Harry is mollified to see Padma blush at Hermione’s greeting much as he does seconds later when Malfoy reaches for his own hand.
My Presentation expedited things a little.
I should have given you a heads up but I truly did not believe it would be an issue, as we usually have it well under control.”
Because they often are not in control of their power, they’re often feared by Wizarding Society in much the same way that werewolves are.
It’s a striking image, such an utterly rare sight prior to their Presentation when they had both been so in sync.
Harry nods.  He eyes her; he’s full of questions but he’s not sure where to begin.  They sit in silence for a minute or two, both staring at the crackling fire place before Susan sighs and turns her body a little to angle herself more towards Harry.  She pulls up a leg to sit atop the sofa under the blanket, and her knee touches Harry’s thigh just slightly.  It’s comforting in a way, and it puts him more at ease for this conversation.
If there are any enemy Alphas, we'll be at their mercy or we'll distract our own Alphas with our presence."
All three Covens sported Omegas, which Harry was told was important in establishing ranking, but only Ernie’s sported an Alpha sub in the form of Zacharias Smith, which was supposedly an advantage in head to head wrestling for rank.  Given what Harry knew about Zacharias Smith following his Premonition, he’d take a million Ron’s over one of him, no matter what kind of advantage it might give them in the court of public opinion.
“This kind of news spreads quickly through the circles I travel,” Travers says, brushing it off.
“Look, Draco has a lot on his plate,” Padma says, as she rushes around the Quarters collecting her belongings.
He sets his silverware down with a clank, avoiding everyone’s eyes as he takes the letter from the owl, who turns a wing and is gone as suddenly as he appeared.
She knows you can’t play hooky from the war effort, Harry.
Ron approached and stood at Hermione’s right side.
“Tonks told me you would be amenable to a Courting contract.
You heard Ron.
And the encompassing, depressive state from earlier doesn’t return.
I have to admit, I don’t know why.
“Yeah,” he agrees, finally.
Harry didn’t know how they had worked things out with their mum though - both boys had been studiously avoiding her in the past few days and the woman had begun to look frustrated and somewhat harried, clearly on the verge of expressing some surely disastrous opinion even up to the point of putting them all back on the train.
Slowly Fred raises his eyes, takes in George’s posture, his scent.
“I hadn’t given it as much thought.
"The three of us, we need to be smarter in our dealings with the Order in the future," Hermione nods.
“Me?” she asks, voice sharp.
After a moment she says, “Are you positive, Harry?
The important thing is , he's victorious in his quest and they all get down to the serious business of S'mores.
They can draw on your instincts to submit and make it into something beautiful, make it into something that doesn’t have to do with fear at all.
“As my Second, Ron will need to make the rounds with the other Covens as well, specifically making his greetings to the other Seconds, particularly Zacharias Smith and Blaise Zabini.  Dean - can you partner with Ron?”
Harry shakes his head, as much in denial of what Hermione is claiming as an attempt to clear his head of her anger scent.
You might find that you can be content in ways you had never previously considered.”
“I wouldn’t beat you!” Fred exclaims, face flushing red in shock and shame.
They both got a few hits in, Fred’s got a broken nose and Bill’s got a nasty gash on his arm from where Fred knocked him into the corner of the table.
“Miss…Granger, was it?”  the official stood now to approach Harry’s bed: Mrs Weasley, who had been holding Harry’s hand and smiling at him in that way she had - like he was something precious, frowned at the man and stood up at his approach, clearly finding his behavior somewhat reproachful.
Bill sighs, looking torn.
“He killed him.  He killed my grandmother’s Oma.”
Abruptly, George stood up. “Let’s go for a walk,” he said, and started walking towards the portrait entrance.  Angelina’s voice sounded from across the Common Room. “George, you’re under guidance not to leave the Common Room right now.”
“What? How?”
Please, Alpha.”
And he’s always had a bit of a temper; we used to joke about it with him and Charlie when we were younger.
He tosses and turns for an hour or so, George talking to him softly every once in a while, wiping his face of tears periodically, with a cool cloth.  But no matter how much he grinds and rubs himself - far past any embarrassment a sober Harry would have - he can’t get himself off.  He’s achingly hard but can’t do anything about it, and in the past few minutes he’s begun to produce a liquid between his legs as well, emanating from his hole.
“I’ve already had this fight with Bill.
In spite of Hermione’s arguments to the contrary, Harry was not a complete idiot and did have a modicum of common sense. Harry wasn’t about to discard what happened in the hallway with Malfoy & Nott easily nor was he going to ignore the warnings Hermione had given him regarding the nature of the relationship between Alphas and Omegas.
Oberon follows his direction gracefully enough and keeps quiet, patiently waiting Harry out.
“Mating?!” Harry did not shriek.  He didn’t.
Susan pauses and rubs her forehead wearily.  “This is…I’m coming at this sideways,” she says, sounding frustrated.  Harry hums, low and comforting and meets her eyes with gentle patience.
," Fleur mutters distractedly and Harry sends her a grateful look even as he ponders his own idiocy in wandering through the dark when he could have just used magic.
You don’t have to give your entire life away just to execute a war strategy.
“Do you trust me Harry?” Bill questions softly.
“Ron had a few points in your favor as well," he tells the Alpha girl eventually.
Leo?”
“Sounds amazing,” Traver says, smiling.
What is the point?”
When that Arrow’s Seeker had been flying those lazy z’s and he was marking the field?
The Betas all righten up.  The Alphas walk towards and then through the crowd of Betas, which parts for them respectfully and when they have come to the end of the Betas, the Beta’s all turn so their backs face the fire and the Alphas are at the head of each Coven, facing the remaining, lone Omegas head on.
It broke my heart to be honest with you.
Dean and Seamus followed suit before the pendant made it back around to Hermione. Looking somber she repeated the spell and then, filled with some impulse Harry didn’t fully understand, he moved to stand in front of her.  Hermione held the pendant up to his robes and a second later it was affixing itself there magically, right on his left chest, above his heart.
Fleur blushes, flames instantly reddening.
Travers smiles.
As a favor.
Harry shrugs.
“WHAT!?”
Her scent, it soothed me.
Without direction, Harry feels his knees fold in, guiding him gently to the ground below him.  On either side of him, he sees the other Omegas doing the same, obeying the magic that is pulsing through all of them.  Hermione had warned him what to expect, but he hadn’t fully understood what it would feel like.
Oberon shrugs.
I’m in control of it most of the time but complete control is potentially impossible, at least I’ve not learned of an Empaths who have it.”
Fleur doesn’t let him leave.
“You think?” Harry snaps, ripping the letter back and shoving it deep into the bowels of his robes, praying he won’t have to think of it ever again.  It’s not to be though, as Ron is both persistent and a wanker.
Harry nods to Ginny and heads off toward his friend.
“Y’know if it was up to me, nothing would ever be enough to make up for what Smith did to you that day.”
Hermione jumped into the encroaching train wreck bravely.  “Sir, we’re very happy to have Harry register and will comply with all your rules and expectations.  But if you don’t mind terribly, it’s been a long day for my Coven and I think we’ll let Harry process some of this information.  Surely you remember how overwhelmed you were at your own Presenting?”
She’s also chosen to be quite vulnerable and although they don’t know each other that well, he’s always liked the French girl.
Harry’s quiet a moment, considering.
Harry blushed at the indirect compliment but just nodded.  “I assume you’ll be taking over for him as Captain next year?”
Doesn't make them bad people necessarily, but it does mean that I need to have my eyes wide open.
For his part, Fred looks ill, face going ashen and scent turning sour with dismay.
He gives the Alpha’s hand a quick squeeze before he pointedly begins untangling their fingers.
“Omega spot.  It make Omegas submissive.  It’s called gentling. It can … it can hurt you, Harry.  It’s very dangerous.”
“Yes, Sir,” Hermione responded as sweetly as anything, but Harry knew his friend and he could tell she had her back up.
“Olive,” George reprimands, voice taut.  “There’s no need to be so crude.  And that’s not what we’re going to be doing anyway.  It can be a little overwhelming is all, Harry.  Having other Omegas - ones that are not also in season - is soothing.  We’ll talk to you, touch you a little - not anywhere private, I promise.  And we’ll help you keep hydrated and fed.”
“Two things - one, you’re a powerful Omega, and, based on the history you alluded to yourself, there’s good reason to believe that you might be the most powerful Omega on the market.
Oberon and Harry set off in one direction with Leo and Ron trailing slowly behind, caught up in their own conversation.
The relief is transient - a break so brief it might as well not have existed and George looks worried.  Because now Harry is chanting low, under his breath, “Alpha. Alpha. Alpha. Alpha.” And all of a sudden he just knows that that is how he can stop this pain.  That if only he had an Alpha, he could avoid this torture.
It’s the most in sync Harry has seen them since his Presentation - a feeling of good will pervasive between them over the past few days.
“You’re Omega, Harry.  You did the best thing you could in that situation, and you listened to your instincts.”
He moves his hand up and very gently gets a grip on Harry’s neck so the palm of his hand is warm against Harry’s Omega Spot.
Please review! I appreciate them so much!
“Will that be weird?” Harry asks, genuinely curious.
Ginny shrugs.
Ron reaches down to gently push Harry back from hands and knees to his knees, and then to sit cross-legged on the grass, rubbing a hand gently in circles against his back.
We’ll see them at the Bonding in a few months.
The last part of this she bites out, looking at Travers levelly.
I didn’t enjoy what happened just now, but if you tell me you didn’t mean to do it, I’ll believe you and I’ll trust that you and I will learn how to behave towards each other so neither one of us gets hurt.”
“Which you can do after Mr. Potter has had some time to rest,” the healer interjected. “His body is undergoing a fairly dramatic change and the sleeping draught I just gave him will allow him to process those changes with the least amount of discomfort.”
“Indeed,” Hermione says, still laughing.
When the Gryffindor remains silent, he continues.
The magic didn’t erode all at once.
The normally boisterous, mother-hen Alpha had become quiet herself, so much so that Arthur had actually taken on the mantle of serving up the breakfast fare and cajoling his children and guests into additional heaps of food.
She’s been Travers’ Second for about six years.
“Omegas are Magic’s gift to our Covens.  They bare our children, and are our heart and soul.  An Omega is a treasure that requires our protection.  As the Alphas honor tradition and the Betas honor the Alphas, so do they all now honor the Omega.  On this Samhain, having nourished our ancestors and pledged our vows to one another, let us ask the magic we have called here, to be called forth for the protection of our Omegas.  May Magic grant this blessing.”
Omegas are almost always involved in the lead-up.
"It's Bill and Fred.
And we really do need to give an answer to Malfoy.
“What?!”
Harry nods, “Yeah, I saw them arguing yesterday when I walked in with Fleur.”
Harry’s distracted by unwrapping the third of his chocolate frogs and George chuckles a little bit and puts the box with the remaining frogs just out of reach.  “Enjoy that mate, but wait at least an hour before you start in on the rest, yeah?  The last thing you want is to make yourself sick just as your Heat is starting in earnest.”
She trails off awkwardly at the end of that thought, clearly thinking about Fred’s bizarre behavior towards George and Harry fusses with a loose thread on his Weasley sweater from last year.
I decided to let it go.”
“Oui. There is growing support in France for He Who Must Not be Named.
Takes a long breath of his own.
Snape, sitting at the front of the room and observing his students’ behavior, only nodded.
He sees him almost as a somewhat-distant elder brother.
They’re driven by similarily primitive impulses.
For all he’s enjoys the sport, he’s never truly entertained the idea of playing professional Quidditch, for all that people tell him he has a gift.
The worst was Molly.
Not only in the relationship between our Covens, but these particular Portkeys are reusable if not triggered, so we’ll ask for them back when we return this afternoon if you each wouldn’t mind terribly.”
“Tell us everything.
“Oh goody,” Harry mutters wryly.
Dumbledore isn't looking out for me and neither are the Order.
“Well, let’s go to the Apparition Point then.
“I know.”  Hermione reaches out and sets her hand on top of his.  She leaves it there for a minute, a comforting weight, before she withdraws.
Now Fleur is blushing under the intensity of the gaze Bill has levelled on her and Harry makes a beeline for the exit, only providing a quick affirmative to Bill before he makes his escape.
My father could never take his eyes off her.
George is asleep but he’ll be up soon if I know anything about his season.”
“Well I suppose I was going to anyway,” Harry says.
"Of course not," she says, so calmly Harry has to fight the urge to bare his teeth at her. "We have a system."
Anyway, he’s always been more weary of regretting the risks he didn’t take.
Malfoy waited until she had grasped Harry’s arm before withdrawing.  “Congratulations are in order, Granger,” he murmured quietly, nodding his head in a small gesture of respect.  “May Merlin smile on you and yours.”
“Remember, sweet one, this was your idea,” he chides and Fleur subsides, scent not particularly irritated.
“—will have to join another Coven when Fred and George graduate this year.
Looks at George.
George doesn’t acknowledge the motion, eyes fixated on the spectacle of his family squaring off with him at the center of the debacle.
"Here," Hermione's voice said, and then there was something shiny in front of her. Her glasses. She took them from her friend's hands and put them on.
PS: I know, Denis and Colin don't have a sister. I made her up... for reasons ;)
I raise my paintbrush to the wood again and after a few well placed strokes a caricature of the blond Slytherin smirks at me. His head is extra big (big-head) and his chin even pointier than in real life. I even managed to depict his arrogant sneer and the way his nose is always high up in the air. It's
"Mum?" I call again, wondering what kind of dream I have walked into.
Wait, did they plan to… ? Umbridge, who was standing among the crowd, opposite them, seemed to realise what they were planning, seconds before they mounted their brooms.
He caught her gaze and waved at her, smiling widely. Haley felt herself blushing. She removed the hair tie from her high ponytail and let her auburn locks flow over her shoulders freely. They were framing her face in a nice, curly way. In her mind she thanked her mum for braiding her hair the night before. It also had the added effect of shielding her face from too observant eyes.
In the Entrance Hall the three friends were awaited by Luna Lovegood.
that. All this time she had suffered because of him and now? Why hadn't she played this card before? It felt exhilarating to be the one who pulled the strings for once. Victory really
Haley closed her eyes, seeing the scenes clear in her mind. "He says I'm supposed to stay away from 'Malfoy'. And that he's evil and dangerous."
"Hm." Draco said again. "A chocolate owl? For Valentine's Day?"
Haley sighed. "Yes." She admitted. "He knows about Draco and me," she whispered.
"But I hope you'll understand… that I can't."
"You might," Lupin replied. "We've still got Transfiguration, if you're bored you could test me. Here..." He offered the other boy his book.
And then off they went, disapparating with a loud
The Slytherin sighed, "Well… you know…"
"Have you spotted any glumbumbles yet?" Neville asked, as they were traipsing along the pumpkin field.
Suddenly she got up. "I gotta go."
Once he had reached the table he sat down in the seat across from Potter. He felt his mask settle back onto his face automatically and asked, echoing Longbottom's question,
was scribbled in a cursive scrawl.
Harry hums, mind full of questions now, but not wanting to pry.
“I can’t say for sure right now.”
In the end, Angelina ends up being the one to deal with George when the other Omega awakens.
Harry shrugs.
A palpable silences between the three comes after that with Harry unable to prevent himself from shooting Ron an incredulous look.
He nods to acknowledge what Ron is saying.
What if you had never Presented?
But she doesn’t like the Order making decisions about what to do with you behind our back and only coming to us with their desired outcome.
“Are you angry that I decided to allow the courtship or that I undermined your stance in front of
I have four offers now, surely one is at least good enough to court?”
But five minutes…in a war, that could be the difference between life and death.
“How large are Covens normally?”
Harry can tell they come from a high class Potions-shop - they have the stamped seal of an accredited Potions Master affixed to each vial.
Only the Potions Master at each shop knows that shop’s specific sealing charm and with the shop’s reputation on the line, they take the matter quite seriously.
“Not as much as you,” it slips out and Harry flushes red and hot, but Malfoy chuckles, his timber low.
“How old were you? When she - “
“Let’s use our first time together to talk about your biggest concern as it relates to your new Presentations.  I assure you, this is a safe space to ask even something you might think is embarrassing.  There are some things you may need to know, and I cannot have any of you afraid to ask those questions. If you do not respect each others’ privacy,” she paused, looking Stebbins right in his eyes, “I assure you that you will not like the consequences.  Do you all understand? Speak aloud, I must hear your word.”
But it’s a necessary evil for the sake of the Order - we all have a part to play in the war effort.
It was always his intention that I return to Britain, take up the mantle of my heritage, when I was grown.
“Must I have future suitors?” Harry asked, sighing.
Standing at his side is a female Alpha, with dark hair flowing down
Alphas, even the good ones…they can get possessive over Omegas.
“Clearly, it’s hard and I’ve seen so many friends taken advantage of since I Presented.
Harry hesitates when he sees her but Ron gives him a friendly push and he reluctantly sits next to her while Ron settlesh himself adjacent to Hermione.
I am so sure that this courtship is the right thing, I am so interested in you, that I wanted to make sure I had everything setup on my side to give it it’s best chance of success.
I don’t believe in lies.
“Why not?”
And you’re right.
Nott’s eyes flicker down to the intentional threat before snapping up to meet Hermione’s.
Earlier today, Harry had been a bystander to the arm’s attempt at a grope of Hermione’s breast.
But that’s what I have with Bill.
When Harry has recovered as much of his composure as he thinks is possible following such an experience, when he’s showered and dressed in clean robes and drunk the potion George has left for him and eaten the chocolate that his fellow Gryffindor had promised would make him feel a little bit more himself before the older Omega had hurriedly excused himself to class, he chances a foray into the main common area to track down Susan.  She’s waiting for him - he can tell that’s why she’s there - and the furious rage that had seemed to encompass her after whatever that vision was is no where to be seen.  Instead she looks exhausted, but she shoots him a small smile when she sees him and pats the sofa seat next to her, lifting up the fleece blanket she has covering her lap in invitation.
“I am your Alpha,” Zacharias says, furious, his hand reaching down to twist into Susan’s red hair, curled carefully for the occasion.  “You love me.  You will obey me.  Tell me who you obey.”
His designation doesn’t make him a child or some kind of pet.
For all the intensity of her eyes, her expression is open and guileless when she meets Harry’s gaze, giving him a smile that instantly sets him at ease.
“Well Hannah’s a Beta isn’t she,” Boot says back.
I know you’re scared for him, scared that what happened to your brother, your sister will happen to him—“
“Reconciliation with your Alpha is usually the best course,” Fleur says and Harry groans, not quite ready to go work things out with Hermione.
They trust each other, and neither permission nor forgivness is required.
So I I had taken them in to the tailor down the road, with whom I had not yet been acquainted.
“Yes,” Harry said, instantly.
Behind him, Ron has approached at a fast clip, face turned down in a disapproving frown.
“But it didn’t help matters - what with two Alpha brothers in proximity and him all freaked out.
“I don’t doubt that you’re trying to protect me.
Oberon frowns.
“Hey, hey ‘Mione.  It’s okay, yea?  I asked you to, remember?”
Susan nods.
“We have that in common,” Harry notes quietly.
If you release the spell then, it should create the strongest memory.
I hate that some of them think that way.
Belle walks silently behind him, and Harry wonders if she’s aware of how fixated he is by her presence.
“Do you not like Quidditch?” Harry hopes that’s not the case, given the man had been the one to organize this entire outing.
“Alright, alright Alpha,” huffed George, from the ground.  Harry stared at him in shock.  Fred suddenly seemed to notice him.
Nott glares at him, thrown off his game from the interruption, but Smith doesn’t seem bothered.
We hurried downstairs, we thought maybe it was Death Eaters or something.
Ron shrugged, looking uncomfortable but not angry.  “It’s fine.  I’m getting used to it.  Mum and dad talked to me and Ginny about it too.  After all, they had 7 magical children which is pretty much unheard of for an Alpha and Beta pair.  Mum told me her family, the Prewetts have always been blessed with better fertility, even among their Betas.  Most of Mum’s family was killed in the last Wizarding War, but her parents were a Beta and Omega pair and had five children.  So as long as Ginny and I end up pairing with an Alpha or Omega, we have better than average chances of being able to have our own kids.  It’s not guaranteed of course, but it’s nice to know.”
Does that appeal to you?”
Harry doubts the attempted interruption to the game was deliberate - the extra appendage has shown itself to have a mind of its own in the 24 hours since Ron had consumed the New Year’s candy George had so innocently offered him.
When they enter the Quarters, Susan Bones is cuddled under a large furry blanket looking less that tip-top.  Harry frowns when he sees her but she sends him a shaky smile and struggles a hand out from where its buried beneath the heavy blanket to waggle her fingers at him tiredly.  “Hiya, Harry. Welcome to the club. Most exclusive in the school.”
But I didn’t.
Hermione and Ron are, thankfully, outside the library, engaged in a quiet but clearly heated discussion when Harry approaches.  Hermione glances up with blazing eyes before she takes in that it’s Harry standing in front of them.
“Of course,” Hermione responds.
The man is funny, after a fashion, and fairly laid back, which is a relief after the intensity of their courting conversation.
Saturday morning brings a surprise.
“Yes,” Travers says, almost distractedly.
She shakes off Arthur’s hand when he triest to stop her.
“Draco keeps his own counsel, Potter.
“There are interesting people I get to meet.
“Not exactly sure what that all was about,” he admits.  “Thanks, I guess.  But how do you know I haven’t spoken to Hermione.”
They both blush bright red at that.
“Omegas care for and are cared for by the Coven.  As our Alpha has promised, you have our protection.  Omega, will you care for the Coven?”
“Oi, cuz my having to watch you and Hermione snog is so much better?”
He’s speaking to Hermione but he’s catching Harry’s eyes as he says, “My sincerest apologies, Alpha Granger.
"What do you propose then?" he snaps back, "We're blind in this room.
“Good enough technique on both sides.
“You also need a way to bloody remove it!” Ron fumes, third hand curling into a fist.
And he’s got a big Coven, you know and an Omega that’s part of it right there in the room, his twin no less, so he’s got a huge reservoir of magic to pull from and when he unleashed it…”
Before he knows it, he realizes he’s sinking to his hands and knees, head tipped to the side to bare his neck, making low, whimpering sounds.
“Ron,” Arthur cuts in, trying to calm him, “you’ve only been Presented a short time.
“I’m satisfied,” he agrees, reaching out to take the Potion and pocket it in his inner robe before assessing Smith and Nott and giving them each a curt nod.
She pats his hand gently.
The other Omega settles softly down next to him and without pausing reaches out to tangle her left hand with his right.
scent was awful, I was choking on it, even as a Beta.”
“Everyone, let’s calm down.
From what Harry had picked up from general acquaintance with the kid, he was a little …. off-step with people.  He came across a little over-eager socially.  It made people nervous.  And he wasn’t exactly Harry’s type.  He paused.  Did he have a type?  Besides an ill-conceived attraction to Cho back in fourth year, he hadn’t really given a lot of thought as to who he was into.
It was just physical at first.
There wasn’t much to do but think about things last night when he couldn’t sleep.
To Settle your Omega, an Alpha has to appeal to it and give it some of what it is looking for.
Besides, I’m sure you’ll recall that I didn’t agree to Bond, only to Court.
“Sometimes,” Remus tells him.
As far as Harry knew, the twins hadn’t conversed since the Fight itself, and George had been quieter than usual, dodging out of being alone with anyone lest they attempt to trap him into discussing it.
“Alright, well the only thing that’s left here is your registration!” The man sounded positively chipper now.  He held out the portfolio which was now opened to a page showing a very official looking certificate which his name and designation.  “This is a blood quill,” the man warned.  “It’s used in official documents so there can be no forging of identity.  You’ll feel a bit of a prick, but it won’t leave a mark.”
Thankfully, the mind shields itself from what it can’t really comprehend.  And the fever is not inconsequential, it does its part in keeping Harry’s conscious thought absent.  He can tell the heat is building, building, building.  Susan is there with him at the worst of it.  He knows that he’s at the crest of the wave, that here is where he either crashes and dies or comes out whole on the other side.  He’s been mostly out of it, but he has a moment of cognition at the very height and he reaches out, desperate, for Susan, wanting the contact of another human being in this utterly terrifying fight.  She grips him and its like a dam breaking.
“Yes, an unlucky burden,” Oberon responds, fingers smoothing over the robe covering Harry’s hip, as though in consolation at the ancient wound.
And I didn’t mean it.
“Did it feel different?”
She’d been rather spare on reprimands for her elder sons as well.
George shrugs. “Now you know.  One day you’ll be the one giving this talk on the other side.  We look out for each other Harry.  We have too.  World’s a dangerous place for Omegas and our Covens try, but they don’t understand what we go through day to day.  Come talk to the rest of us if you’re struggling.  Dad reminded me the other day that generations of Wizards before us have gone through this same transition.  Presenting doesn’t have to be the end of anything, its just a rite of passage into something new.”
Oberon lips widen against his in pleased delight and he maneuvers a hand up to clasp Harry’s chin, pulling him up to press tighter against his mouth before he parts his lips and invades Harry’s own, slowly pressing Harry’s mouth open until the other man’s tongue is inside his mouth and Harry lets out an aroused little whimper.
The witch emanates a sort of mournful intensity, and in spite of the bustle around them, it’s such a compelling center of
“Wizarding Dynamics are not….necessarily predictable but there are certain patterns.  If a Wizard has abnormally strong magic, they tend to fall into either an Alpha or Omega presentation.  There’s a genetic component involved too, I suppose. But muggle borns with strong magic seem just as likely as purebloods with strong magic to present Alpha or Omega, so its not foolproof.  You’ve always been strong willed, extraordinarily lucky, and your magical abilities are far beyond the average wizard.  Some of that is your connection to Voldemort, I guess, but by all accounts your mother and father were extremely talented Wizards and you have a lot of inborn strength.
he commands, making both Omegas in the room shiver, and George’s hand shoots out in blind obedience, almost knocking over his tea in his haste.
“I think you have it too.”
And it’s been 19 days!”
He might not realize using it would offend you.”
“My uncle pulled me out when I presented Alpha.
“Tell me why everyone is so nervous about Omegas being taken advantage of ‘Mione.  Please.  I can’t stand being in the dark any longer.”
Belatedly, looking around at the other Omegas, Harry realizes that this is what Malfoy meant during that hallway confrontation with Nott - that he had been “missing something” at the time.  Clearly, the omega pendant was a universal sign that an Omega had the protection of a Coven.
At least he assumed it was just a Coven meeting, which she had courteously scheduled on a day when he didn’t have shifts taking care of Padma who was deep into ther season and in such abject mysery that the experience of it dogged most of Harry’s waking moments.
When they take their seats, Oberon settles in next to Harry, draping a proprietary hand over Harry’s knee.
We should have talked about this going in.
Oberon’s quiet for a second, also watching the commotion as all the team members fly in to strategize. “Oh, well, I didn’t want to antagonize the woman.
Hermione looked over from where she was sitting at the table Harry had just abandoned and widened her eyes as she took in the situation.  “Yes,” she responded.  “Thank you Malfoy.  Professor, I will need to excuse myself and Harry from the rest of this class.”
Harry sees Ron do a double take at that, mouthing ‘
“That’s what I like about you, Potter,” Malfoy murmurs, “always so straight to the point.”
Bill’s own pheremones sway immediately towards
If he asks me to stand down, I will, but if not, then you bloody hell better start listening to him.”
Ron sobers slightly, looking around skittishly for a second before concluding on one else had overheard them.
“So….we’re a Coven, now,” Harry said.
“It’s called Alpha voice, Harry.  Betas are susceptible to it too, but not the same way Omegas are.  I’m sorry - I promise I won’t use it on you unless the need is dire.  I don’t like having this ability.  I don’t … I don’t want to be able to control another person like that.  I’m really sorry, Harry.”
He was not accepting such an upfront approach, if he was being honest.
But George is not to be deterred.  “As if I would give any of these Alpha cads my attention,” he dismisses.  “One only has to look at Susan for a reason to stay away from Alphas.”
Everyone picks at their food in silence for a bit, before Molly bustles in.
Alphas…they can’t always control their instincts, especially in that state.
“Oh yea,” Harry muttered, leaning back and picking at the grass under his fingers with barely suppressed bitterness.  “Another thing I’m looking so very forward to.”
“It’s entertaining enough, but it’s not the most interesting thing in my line of sight by a long shot.”
“Speaking of Seasons,” Padma says, voice tentative, “we need to plan.
He thinks some space is probably best for right now.
She does mostly freelance work. And! She plays in a Quidditch League in her free time - Keeper, if you can believe it.”
He takes the quill Hermione proffers and scrawls his name on the line Hermione points to.
“I’ll be right back,” Ron says, and jumps up to eagerly interrogate his mother over the contents of her pantry.
Slowly, the redhead seems to gather himself, straightening slightly and answering Harry in a soft voice.
Happy Christmas, Remus.”
“I have his express permission,” Travers agrees, “but we have no qualms waiting for you to confirm.”
To his credit, Travers doesn’t flinch.
Of course, the real test would come in the next few days, as they adjusted back to school and being with their Coven.
gravity that Harry finds himself at risk of being pulled in.
Now, sorry, gotta run if I’m gonna make it in time.
“What kind of stories?”
You’re going to say yes to the proposal?”
She levels Harry with a serious gaze.
“But you, yourself, can cast magic just like the rest of us, right?
The time out has ended and the players are racing across the field, but the Arrows Seeker is flying much more disciplined now, clearly reacting well to whatever plan the team had rallied behind during the break.
Fight, I want to talk about Fight. In general.
“On this Samhain, as every Samhain, we honor our ancestors who have sacrificed so much and who’s legacies we cherish,” the Alpha started, his tone somber and serious.  “We honor those Alphas that fought for their Covens and defended our way of life.  We look to them for guidance as we face our own challenges and our own sacrifices.  Alpha, proffer your offerings.”
“No?” he questions, voice mild.
Can’t be at Hogwarts without a fledge in proximity, even as a Beta.”
They’re still in charge, but it’s in a way that makes you feel like something special, rather than just some prize that they’ve won or some tool that they get to control.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure Madame Pomfrey will set you right as rain.”
Mum says he and Fred should both sleep through the night, but in case he wakes up, he’s probably going to be worried.”
“It was all she could do to keep a straight face in that room when you agreed to do what the Order wanted.
Hermione’s eyes widened slightly in surprise but her composure didn’t break.  “And the same to yours, Malfoy,” she responded, as they both ignored a confused Harry who couldn’t decide whether to demand an answer as to why his impending trip to the Hospital Wing was generating congratulations from his nemesis to his closest friend or just to demand that the trip become more immediate.
After a minute he winds it back up, then holds it out across the table in George’s direction, still refusing to look anyone in the eyes.
“What? No.  Nott approached me in the corridor, it was bloody strange, he barely said anything but he, I dunno, growled at me when I tried to walk away.  Malfoy calmed him down, I guess.”
the point
“What else is new?” Ron muttered but subsided when Hermione fixed him with a hard stare.
Aside from their Escort, both of whom follow far enough back that they are not privy to the courting pair’s conversation, Harry sees the other members of their Covens strolling amidst the crowd, stopping in to check the wares of the various vendors who have set up shop.
“Careful,” Fred snapped and for some reason Harry felt himself shrink back, intimidated, eyes cast down.  “Go find your Alpha, Omega.”
“Omega Potter,” Fred said, reaching out pointedly, “a pleasure, as always.”  Taking the hint, Harry offered his hand which Fred pressed to his lips briefly.  Harry fought a blush even as he distantly noted a similar greeting happening between George and Hermione.  The other 8th years that had banded around slowly disbursed, allowing the allied Alphas to speak privately.
“What was that?”
Harry asks.
“Why haven’t you signed the contract?”
Oberon frowns, looking concerned.
“That’s a start,” he agrees.
Hermione rolls her eyes at Ron’s exuberance, but she nods anyway.
Luna, without a word, plucked the pendant from the redhead’s hands and repeated Ron’s motions.  She smiled after the pendant had fallen back into her palm and looked at Harry with searching eyes.  “Welcome to the Coven, Harry.”
Refusing was putting us in an untenable position - Hermione was already threatening to take an action we can’t afford to execute.”
“I’m not a child, Fred!
Harry whines - the sound is involuntary and Hermione abruptly lets go, lurching away to sit several feet away from him.
Hermione shrugs, lips gently upturned as she watches her boyfriend hurry inside.
“Seven.”
“Far be it for me to order the Golden Boy about…” Malfoy starts and Harry rolls his eyes at the other boy’s droll tone.  “But maybe you shouldn’t be wandering about the castle when you’re so woefully ignorant?”
“I do,” the blonde responds, voice soft.
Harry had sat through the dialogue growing more and more confused.  He was also at about his wit’s end with being ignored as though he wasn’t here when the conversation was clearly about him.  He finally burst out, “Second? COA? Sponsor?  Hermione, what is going on?  What’s happening to me?”
Ron looked uneasy.  “He’s unpresented still, Harry.  I know you guys were born on the same day, but honestly Harry, you were incredibly late to present. We were getting pretty nervous over the last few weeks. It’s…unlikely…that he will present at this point.  It’s rare, but there are cases of permanent Neutrals.”
“And Hermione knows quite a bit of the history, bookworm that she is.
I watched how it went down yesterday - Bill was beating Fred when it was physical.
They would have all been worried.
“I’m not sure,” Oberon shrugs.
“How do I make it stop?” Harry demands, skipping over the question entirely and getting to the heart of what he wants to know.
“I assured you during our unfortunate interaction a while back that my Second would make right on his affront to your Omega, and to your’s, Alpha Granger—“
Harry hasn’t been exposed to it much and he hides the shiver that trickles across his skin at its use, not wanting to give away even more of how he’s feeling at this moment.
“Besides the important reason that we want to look out for our friend,” Hermione continues, glaring at Seamus before continuing.  “Vying for rank is a hallmark of Coven society.  Even if we decide to dissolve our Fledge after graduation, future Covens as well as employers will want to know how our Coven performed inside of Hogwarts when considering us to join their ranks.  It’s as much as part of the vetting process as our NEWTs.  Aside from that, its not just Harry’s dating prospects I’m concerned about.  If any of us want to date outside the Coven, we’ll need to be in good standing to do so.  There are not as many restrictions when it comes to Beta courtship, but there are still rules to follow, and the more powerful Covens often have more negotiating power. Is that enough reason for you all?”
The look he had received from Mrs. Weasley had made the decision more than worth it.
“Ronald!” Molly screeches as Angelina stands up next to Fred and Ron lurches to his feet.
“What you are, Harry.  That’s what you’ve presented,” she leaned forward, suddenly earnest.  “I promise, Harry, this wasn’t about keeping you in the dark.  I know you’re confused right now, but what you’re feeling now is something that everyone newly presented feels.  We aren’t allowed to discuss these things with neutrals.  But now we can tell you everything.”
a bunch of Alphas?”
Harry nods at her, before resuming his walk to Remus, raising an eyebrow in inquiry to the former Professor.
“Harry, stay here,” Hermione commands, unconsciously throwing some Alpha Voice herself, and Harry freezes as she pushes her way towards where the two Hufflepuffs are putting on a show.  But Ernie gets there first, roaring in fury and clasping a hand around where Zacharias’ hand is tangled in Susan’s hair so tightly that the other Alpha is forced to let go.  “Susan, get up and go to Lavender. Now,” he commands with yet another Alpha voice and Susan scrambles away on hands and knees before a Beta at the edge of the crowd reaches down to help her to her feet and deliver her into the arms of Lavender Brown, who tucks Susan’s head into her shoulder and immediately turns to make for the castle to get the Omega out of the spotlight.
His opportunities to spend holidays with people he truly values have been few and far between, so its easy to allow himself to fall into the traditions and joys of a Weasley family Christmas without dwelling on the gloom of the night before.
“Enough,” Fred says.
Ron, for his part, looks unruffled.
Harry thinks about it for a second.
That’s when the Arrows really lost the game. She tried to come back, and did a passable job, but she was too far behind.”
There’s a large owl completely covered in midnight-black feathers that comes through the window with a parchment tied with a bright red bow in its claws.
“Is that what you found with Bill?” Harry asks her, genuinely curious.
All of the terror of the magical world, but none of the beauty?
And he has.
Things are genial enough, although the twins are not interacting, sitting as far away from each other they can at the table, with an increasingly discontent Angelina - who had made no indication that she was likely to return home anytime soon - lodged up against Fred’s side.
“Not yet, but I think we better start looking into some options.
She reaches out and grips Harry gently by the shoulder pulling him suggestively toward her.
“Yes, she apparently rejected Zacharias Smith’s proposal the other day and he’s not taken it well.  Their whole Coven is in turmoil over it - and not at a good time.  Look at the idiot - brooding over there alone when he should be helping his Alpha negotiate this party.”
The Cannon’s Beaters are smarter but the Arrow’s Beaters are more brutal.
He’s taller than Harry, just slightly shorter than Ron, standing at about 6 foot 1, with a decidedly athletic frame, trim enough, but corded through with attractive muscle.
“Many hundreds of Wizards have performed detail research into Stricture to try to uncover it’s origins, but the consensus has always been that Magic itself intervened.  There are no known examples of immunity to Stricture, and eventually Wizards learned to accept it’s existence and to alter Wizarding culture to adapt to it.  In time, it came to be considered a gift by many as the newly Presented were able to come into their dynamics without the weight of their familial Coven’s expectations.”
Hermione and Luna catch up to them with two of Oberon’s Betas .
It’s horrible.
he kept making these whimpering sounds, he was on his knees, just behind Bill.
“You have to accept them, without making a fuss.
Ron shrugged.  “You’d have to ask him, but I think he thinks Mum and Fred are being overly protective.  His whole life changed after Presenting.  He feels stifled by all the restrictions and I think he misses the relationship he and Fred used to have.  Their bond is…just really different now.  Add to that that Fred refuses to hear courting proposals for George until after graduation….well the two of them have been bickering pretty much non-stop.”
“Ah. Testing the waters, George?”
“Actually, you’ll find that I reached out to Professor Dumbledore in advance of this trip.
She lets out a little growl of irritation at the action and Harry feels his own lips pull back in a snarl.
Irritated, they proffer the gargoyle several potential candy-oriented password options before ‘Pumpkin Pasties’ finally has the gargoyle stepping aside and they ascend up the circular staircase.
“I see you’ve all gotten comfortable,” Hermione comments from Harry’s side, but her voice is light and he can tell she’s feeling some of the same warmth he’s feeling at having their friends with them.
If you don’t Bond, you’ll always, always be at risk.
I spend more than that on a meal occassionally.
What set them off?”
Hermione sighs.  “I feel bad for Susan,” she says quietly.  Harry squeezes her arm affectionately.
Probably send in Raphe if you see him, would you?”
Emma Hobbes and Polly Chapman - two Omegas Harry hasn’t yet interacted with much, take the next shifts for George and Harry doesn’t see him again until he’s clearly in his peak and just as out of his mind with it as Susan had been.  Resigned to seeing his friends in constant agony, Harry has come prepared this time, with an icing spell that he’s picked up from a book in the library - it allows him to target a specific area of the body and cool it substantially for a short duration of time.  When he had tested it on himself on one of his arms, it had been almost too cold, forcing him into a teeth-chattering shiver, but he suspected an Omega in heat wouldn’t have cause for complaint.
Harry thinks its a ruse to escape lingering awkwardness until they’re settled in the tent and Hermione is thrusting a long piece of parchment under his nose.
,” he growls.
He sighs.
They’re fortunate that Hogwarts always has students return to school on Fridays, leaving them the whole weekend to get back into the swing of being at the castle before having them attend classes again.
“Does George even want to court?”
“You’re missing something,” Malfoy responds and merely shrugs when Harry makes a confused face.
For his part, Zacharias doesn’t seem to have noticed that he’s caught the attention of everyone else.  He has eyes only for the Omega on her knees before him, and with the silence, Harry can make out the words, heavy with the power of Alpha Voice.
“You should have told us,” he throws his support behind what Hermione said, but he’s careful to try to direct only calm, sincere emotions in both his scent and his voice.
“Is that necessary, Madame?”
Slowly he pulls the ribbon and tugs open the package to find a baby blue blanket with gray patches spilling out.
Hermione had had an unfortunate first meeting with Fred after initially presenting, dashing Ron’s hopes that she might be able to operate as his brother’s Second.  While she and Fred got along fine under normal circumstances, it became clear that on one hand, Fred was more traditional of a Coven Alpha than Hermione planned to be and that she would struggle to follow his lead and second, that Fred already highly relied upon Angelina as a capable Second and that Hermione would be trodding on more than one set of toes if she should try to usurp the older girl's place.   So the two Alphas decided they would make better allies than members of the same Coven, and Hermione and Ron forged their own Fledgeling Coven.
It was more than a little stressful. But at the end of the lesson, she corked up a flask of her finished Invigoration Draught and walked up to Professor Snape's table to hand in her potion with a triumphant grin.
"Nonsense," her mother, Lily Potter admonished, "I know for a fact that you love Hogwarts. Why would you want to stay here with your boring old parents when you could learn how to brew the
"The Talking Hat… it… it… it wanted to put me into... Ravenclaw." I try to school my features into something innocent. But of course he notices and quirks an eyebrow. Well, it hasn't been a complete lie.
"I..." Malfoy started to say after some time, "I... probably owe you… an apology." He chuckled, never looking away from Haley's hand.
"You always do this," he muttered, scowling in irritation.
"Stop – you – prat!" She giggled breathlessly.
"Fine. Close your eyes," she orders. I eagerly close my eyes. After a moment, I feel something funny on my head. It's like my hair is fuller and something tickles around my nose.
him."
"Don't know, but we should definitely take a sample for later." His twin brother replied with an unnaturally high giggle.
"You're right. But sadly it was the wrong tune." He informs me, wiggling his pointer finger at me.
His anger only angered her more. This was ridiculous! "I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, Ron! Next time I'm choosing a boyfriend I'll make sure to consult you first!"
Haley raised an eyebrow at the boy who had stepped to her side. "Is this where you usually bring your conquests?"
"But didn't you check there?" She was almost certain she had seen him do that.
The potion master seemed taken aback for some reason. Something flickered in his dark eyes like surprise or… maybe a distant memory?
hadn't she given it to him sooner? He squinted his eyes at her, suddenly suspicious. "So, you knew I was cold the whole time and you happily watched me suffer?"
"It's just," the girl continued, "One day you're kind of nice and the next it's as if you despise me."
"Then what-"
His legs moved on their own accord. Toward her. He wasn't that much of a coward it seemed.
While I’ve been busy looking around, Draco has already found us a table. He waves me over toward the back of the room close to the stage.
"Can you tell me why…" Potter began, disrupting his plan, "why you were this horrible to me a few weeks back?"
"How can I calm down, when he knows? He knows and he's going to tell everyone and then we'll-"
At last he turned to her, breathing heavily, and smiling so widely as if he wanted to beat the Cheshire Cat. He looked so
"You really don't have to do that," Haley argued. But Hermione was already stepping away and leaving, waving back at her one last time.
The girl shrugged. "I wouldn't call it disapproval. I merely have a… different opinion than you."
"You're not going to thank me?" The young girl asks.
about all this.
Malfoy looked up. "And…?" His tone seemed somehow cautious, as if he thought, she had told Mrs Weasley about the two of them.
"Look, there's something written beneath the feet," Ron noticed, turning the doll upside down. And sure enough, in dwarfish letters there were two phrases engraved into each foot.
. Haley turned the page.
The urge only became stronger when Draco opened his mouth and seemed to be screaming in silent agony. He was in
She looked up at him with big eyes that made her look more innocent and young than ever. "I've never… liked someone like this." She glanced into her chocolate pot. "And my classmates… they're not exactly nice to me." She shook her head. "I don't think… any of them could ever see me as anything other than Loony Lovegood."
Tentatively, he sipped on the still hot liquid. It tasted fruity. Like oranges. That was unexpected. And sweet. That was expected. Just the way he liked it.
"Oh no!" Haley burst out, as soon as she got her breath back. "It's all crinkled." Pouting, she stared down at the ruined letter paper. Sometimes, she really acted more like a muggle than a witch.
"What is it?" The boy asked with a pout. He felt like she had somehow tricked him.
Then why had she told him? Perhaps she had wanted to let him in for once. Only to see what it might be like. And even if it was just for a day.
, he thought despondently.
"I was so done with his shit," She rolled her eyes. "And then one day he asks for a second chance and practically begs me to come to Hogsmeade with him."
Every step she took toward the boy felt meaningful. Haley was afraid that Malfoy thought the same. That he wouldn't let her turn around again once she was there in front of him. She was probably overthinking this but she couldn't help it.
"How could you ever think she might like you?" He continues in a more than slightly mocking tone. Who is he talking to? I follow Neville's gaze toward a boy that is slumped on the floor, hugging his knees to his chest and burying his face in his arms. All that is visible of his head is his strikingly, white blond hair…
"Here," the Gryffindor instructed, while reaching for Malfoy's other hand. "Put them in your pockets." Haley wanted to shove the boy's hand in his coat pockets herself but just as his fingers were vanishing inside the fabric, he took a step back and shook off her fingers.
The faint smell of mint and lavender and something else – something earthy – filled her nose. It was a strange combination but somehow it worked. Without a warning Malfoy had pulled her toward him and wrapped his arms around her. His scent was surrounding her. It was surprisingly pleasant. Calming. And distantly familiar. She buried her face further into the fabric, where it was coming from. Somehow it made her forget why she had been this upset, almost panicked. But she
her back to her common room? So, maybe she had deserved that. Kind of.
"Let's go," she said, her voice sounding too high, too breathy, too nervous. Holding onto her friends left and right, she quickly stepped around the boy, without meeting his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked to the side, sighing frustratedly. "I can walk on my own." His voice sounded small. Embarrassed. But he let her wind his uninjured arm around her shoulders and snake her own around his back in order to support his weight, nevertheless.
"So?" She crossed her arms, tapping her fingers on her arm impatiently.
"Catch him! He's trying to flee!" Umbridge screeched.
"He?" Hermione tilted her head to the side. "Oh. Is that why you're this upset? You talked to Malfoy? Did he give you trouble for the interview?"
DRACO
Haley clenched her teeth. How dare he insult her in such a situation? Well… it
DRACO
"Sirius!"
Before Malfoy could do as much as squeak (not that he would ever squeak but…) Haley sank to the ground, pulling him down with her forcefully.
with them.
"What's that?" She wanted to know, noticing the little folded note on their table only now.
No. He shook his head. No. It was wrong. How had he ever convinced himself there was a good reason for his father's behaviour? For his own behaviour. It was fun, yes. But only, as long as you were on the side of the people who were laughing.
"Morning," Draco said somewhat shyly, his fingers still entangled in her hair. She needed a moment. When had she even taken off her glasses? Or relocated from the chair to the infirmary bed? The bed seemed wider than before as well, as if someone had magically enlarged it.
She chuckled. "It means as long as you take care of your pretty mouth, I'll be stuck to you like… like bubble gum." To demonstrate her point, Haley threw her leg across his lap and wound her arms around him like a koala bear.
treating him with kid gloves. That's why she wasn't able to figure out what Malfoy was hiding. She wasn't even
"Hi sis." Simon said hesitantly, as he waited by the foot of the stairs. A tray with tea and far too much cake was in his hands.
"Let me talk to her, okay?" She asked cautiously, reaching for his hand and giving it a light squeeze.
"I was going to let you try one of my
The following day, Haley asked Draco to meet her in the kitchens for supper.
I don't know what I expected but I certainly thought it would be more spectacular than that.
It was a Hufflepuff from their year. That muggleborn that had been petrified in their second year. They were talking but he couldn't hear the words clearly. Potter was laughing about something.
"I don't see the big difference. Basically people can't see you anymore, right?"
It didn't matter now.
He doesn't look at me. His smile is gone, replaced by a sad frown. "I…" He begins, his fingers playing with the cap of his bottle. "It's complicated." He offers. Like that explains anything.
"I really like…" He started to say, but trailed off, when she suddenly turned to face him again.
They had fought, yes. But he knew now that fighting wasn't the end of the world. They could also get over it. Together. They could get over anything together. As long as they didn't give up. So what, if they belonged to different worlds. No one could stop them from building their own world.
Alone. She was alone quite often lately. One of her friends didn’t talk to her because she thought Haley was a monster. The other didn’t dare take her side in their fight. And the last one had kept a humongous secret from her for a year! She didn’t know which was the worst.
"You mean the golem?" She asked, an excited gleam lighting up her face.
"Now I only need to figure out what to do about Ron." Haley muttered seemingly to herself. Right. There was still Ron. Hot-headed, impulsive, irrational Ron. But he was a loyal friend. And fiercely protective. Hermione had always liked that about him.
." He said quietly. "
"I think he would," she whispered honestly. "Surely, he would."
"Spit that out!" She yelled, anxiously worrying what the toffee might do to him.
Hermione glanced worriedly from her to Luna, while Rita watched Haley again as if she was a delicious slice of cake. "Well." She raised an eyebrow curiously. "If that's all. When do you suppose the interview will be published in your father's rag?"
"Oh, right." Haley looked inside the pockets of her morning robes and found a forgotten owl treat. She only hoped it wasn't too old for the bird.
would know," He added the last sentence in a slightly mocking tone.
"I…" She was at a loss of words. Her friend was right as always.
Pansy narrowed her eyes suspiciously. "Doesn't look like nothing important."
"Come along kid, you should have some lunch, as well," he called, turning his head back.
Before she could walk over and study her mum more closely, the atmosphere around her seemed to change.
"I thought you missed me?" He complains, "Could you maybe let go? I can't eat like that."
Ron nodded in confirmation.
The next morning passed by in a blur. Haley felt even more tired than she had the day before. She slept through most of her morning classes and during Divination she broke almost half of Professor Trelawney's tea cups because she walked headlong into the cupboard. Well, thanks to her clumsy little brother she at least knew a good charm to make them whole again.
Malfoy stopped but there was an ugly grin on his face. "You can have your peace offering back," he drawled, glancing at the cupcake in his hand. "This is what I think of it."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know you're on the team now but that doesn't give you an excuse to slack off on school work," Hermione chided.
The Slytherin snorted mockingly. "Not my fault if you don't take care of your things." He smirked in that annoying superior way and for a moment there was something in the air. Something electric. Haley could swear that there was something else he wanted to tell her. It seemed like he was fighting with himself, trying to decide whether to say it or keep quiet. She waited for the outcome with bated breath…
Haley didn't turn around. Which didn't save her because the boy whose voice she'd heard had already caught up with her.
Haley turned to the door in surprise, finding her dad standing in the door frame, his face a furious mask.
"What? I will do no such thing-"
"I'll be back in a blink," she promised, her hands finding his cheeks again, fingers caressing skin gently. Then she leaned upwards and lightly pecked his lips. Like someone who planned to be gone for ten minutes at most.
"Oh. You noticed?" She was honestly surprised that her friend had noticed anything besides his baked beans.
"Let's go back this way. We also need some Dirigible plums for the flavour," Luna said, leading them to the other side of the greenhouse, where there were even more trees.
There was a cheeky grin on her face.
"Huh?" The boy pressed.
"I know," she whispered, taking his hands into hers. "It's important… yes. But… you're important, too." She hesitated. "To me… you're even more important."
! His eyes are still closed… Maybe it's enough if I kiss him very lightly and definitely not on the mouth.
Then Angelina continued with a sigh, "But I'm also your captain and I want nothing more than to win this damn cup!" She hit the table with her fist, scaring a few first years down the table. "I'll let it slide this one time but if you miss another practice for no apparent reason and without even telling me, I will throw you off the team!"
"An accident?" She repeated mockingly.
Malfoy didn't wait for any more encouragement. "It's a time machine," he told her, in a rather casual tone. Like time machines were the most normal thing in the world.
The man didn't turn around. Instead he gestured toward the chair opposite from him.
What else? Maybe she should put on something more than just her bra. A shirt? She hadn't brought too many nice clothes. There was that midnight blue shirt with a hundred million stars imitating the night sky stitched onto it. She was going to wear that. And a cardigan in case it got cold. Stepping in front of the mirror, she admired herself. She was so beautiful. Sometimes she was surprised
"People?"
With a frustrated sigh, she stabbed her chopsticks into her noodles. "Mostly, it's my friends I'm avoiding." She hadn't meant to admit that. But it bothered her. And she had no one else to talk to. Besides the house elves. Who admittedly were incredibly nice. And made delicious noodle soup.
"Goodnight professor. And-" He bit his lips. He had been about to say '
"What are you talking about?" It didn't make any sense. "Save him? But he's already dead, how-"
"Thank Merlin, I thought – but you said she forgot something in the divination class room – this is already the second time! What if it's something serious? Ronald, you really shouldn't have left her alone when she was like this."
The girl smiled but didn't say anything. She was already starting to make more chocolate in a new pot.
"PEEVES! Is that you? This time I will get you kicked out! This time I'll catch you!" It was Filch's voice that was drifting down from the upper floors. Haley's alarmed eyes bored into his.
"What… what are you doing then?" He asked, feeling weak and defeated.
Turning back to the frozen figures in the middle of the room, Malfoy glanced at Snape's hand once more and raised a questioning eyebrow. The potion master let go of her arm at once, seemingly remembering where they were.
." He adds the last part with a grin.
There was only one more question left to answer. How had Snape known about them?
"What is it?" Malfoy heard Conners (or whatever his name was) asking. He had an ordinary voice. Nothing special. If Draco pushed the big red book (
He did none of that. Because as much as he wanted to, he was afraid
. Okay?" The words spilled out without her being able to stop them. "I
"But… that's not the fascinating bit."
"You're good at drawing," the boy offers after a moment of contemplation.
It was surreal. It was overwhelming. This was Sirius, her godfather. But as a teenager. No older than fifteen. And Lupin. And Wormtail. And… her
She told herself.
, she thought, feeling her breathing pick up.
"Yes, mostly." Luna nodded. They both looked so earnest that Haley couldn't fight her own grin any more. Ron seemed to finally notice the state of his two friends.
"It's not stalking," I protest weakly. In a way it could be considered stalking. And we both know it.
"What?" She was hearing this for the first time.
"Do you still need that?" Potter asked, "That's exactly the book I was looking for."
"Good. Because I do want you to."
strange that she asked Snape of all people… But who was he to complain? He had a lead. Now he needed to follow it.
Professor Snape sighed. But he still followed her out of the living room.
Professor Snape nodded. "Tempted by the description, he used the curse against his enemy without knowing exactly how it worked."
Luna shook off his hand and gave him a look that said, she thought he was being extremely stupid.
"You really care about him," Hermione blurted. "You really care about
What were they talking about again? Right. The colour of Potter's hair.
"Knew it," the Gryffindor commented, lifting one eyebrow. The boy still didn't move. What was he waiting for, now? Was he embarrassed that she caught him lying?
He bit his lips. It seemed like he was actively stopping himself from telling her. "It's nothing. Probably just the stress," he mumbled with a grin that didn't reach his eyes.
"Well, I… he picked it up and read the stupid page out loud..."
The difference was that in a dream she could tell Draco whatever she wanted because it wouldn’t make a difference in the end. He wouldn’t remember. And even if he did, he wouldn’t consider the information important. There would be no consequences. In reality every action had consequences. Everything was a thousand times more complicated than in the dream world. Telling him would mean letting him in. Opening herself up and allowing him to see her weaknesses. She would give him the chance to hurt her.
Ron picks up on things
"Thank Merlin, everyone's been worrying. Ron and Hermione…"
He vanished through the stone barrier, followed by his mother.
And during one tiny second she'd almost caught him. When she'd been just about to talk, seemingly too surprised that he was actually
"Just because," she offered with a shrug. "So, did you have a fight with him?"
" Someone calls. For a moment I'm afraid, Malfoy has followed me after all.
to Sirius, it should be herself… If only she hadn't acted so foolishly… If only…
“Stop it already.” He groans, crossing his arms in annoyance.
"Hello," replied Lovegood in her dreamy voice.
. Was he dreaming? Would he wake up only to find that none of the events of today had ever taken place?
"Haley! Haley, wait!" Hermione called, catching her just at the exit.
He ran his hand down his face, sighing. "Say, you convince him," he offered, "What then? Is he going to help my family, too? My mother? My father?" He paused to glance at her sceptically. She didn't look so determined now. She said nothing. Of course she hadn't thought that far.
made something flutter pleasantly in his stomach.
Malfoy raises his right hand and I fear the worst. Is he going to hit the girl after all? I have to stop him!
With searching eyes she looked up at him, her cheeks slightly flushed and her lips even redder than before.
Which was much heavier than she had anticipated.
If it did, she didn't let it show.
"Dean? Hand me the sausages, would you?" Ron asked at breakfast. Even though the bowl with the sausages was located right next to Haley. The boy hadn't spared her a glance all morning. Let alone, talk to her. It was like fourth year all over again. Haley sighed. How long would his indifference last this time? She glanced at Hermione who only gave a shrug in return. Obviously, her friend wasn't going to get involved in her and Ron's argument.
"I…" What was she supposed to answer?
Free…
"We… didn't go around looking for it all day," Haley offered, not quite lying, "There were… other things."
It calmed her somewhat. The familiar feeling of the gobstone against her skin. But before she even became aware of that thought, she was lost to the dream world.
"No, I didn't," she answered without hesitating. Haley waited for her to say more but it seemed Luna was doing the same.
"It might neutralize the effects of the fairy dust." At least it probably wouldn't make it worse. Fortunately, the fairy hadn't floated anywhere close to
"What does
He shrugged half-heartedly. "They all know," he admitted almost soundlessly. "All the teachers. How could I have kept it from them?"
"Enough work for today," he drawled, "I want to do something a bit more pleasant now. You do remember this is a date, right?"
"Do you… want to talk about it?" Hermione asked cautiously.
Haley was shocked at the accusation. "You really think I would do something like this?" She snorted. "It's not like he wouldn't deserve it."
"Yes, mum. I'll behave." Simon replied loud and clearly.
Beryll, the owl, hooted in irritation. Didn't he like pumpkin soup? The owl hopped onto Haley's shoulder and nipped at her ear gently. Then it flew away.
"And Pomfrey? What are we going to tell her? That you found me? And kindly carried me all the way to the hospital wing?"
it that he wanted? The way he stood there under the oak tree, shaded by the leaves above... The expression on his face mostly hidden by the shadows. Who was he? What did she really know about him?
, Haley realised.
." He whispered almost to himself. "I can't."
"Can we talk?" She said quietly, cautiously. As if she was afraid of his reaction. As if she was scared he wouldn't want to. He did want to. It was almost impossible to resist the urge not to at least
Neville frowned. He looked from the boy to Haley to her hand resting on Draco's, seemingly wondering which question to ask first. Or whether he should ask at all.
"I like him." The girl answered as if the question had been a trigger, setting free the one thought that was constantly reverberating inside her mind.
"Why does my door look like that?" I ask no one in particular. I see a white wing peek out from between the thorns. I was right! From this side the other half of the owl is visible.
HALEY
"My whole family basically was in Gryffindor. Dad never stops going on about how amazing a house it is and that all the other houses suck and
Draco froze. She hadn't noticed him yet. He could still turn around and go. She'd never even realize he had been there. Or he could stay… it wasn't as if he could avoid her forever. Go or stay? He didn't know which was the right thing to do. He didn't know–
Luna nodded once. Then she seemed to remember something. "Oh, I almost forgot." She opened her shoulder bag and rummaged through its contents.
"It stands for
Luna shook her head. "I don't know. I wasn't there."
to you," he repeated, reaching for her arm to stop her from trying to leave once more.
"Don't ever start dating," I tell my brother with a groan, as I let myself fall onto his bed backwards. "Honestly, it's not worth the trouble."
a challenge.
He watches the broomstick sceptically and shakes his head. "You know I can't fly any more." The pain reflected in his grey eyes makes my heart ache for him. I want to hug him and make him forget all his pain. But somehow, I don't think this will help him.
She nodded toward the wide couch, making her insinuation clear.
Wide green eyes looked up at him guiltily. "Oops," she said, biting her lips sheepishly. It should have annoyed him but her expression was just too endearing.
Haley found herself nodding without even thinking about it. If anyone deserved a bit of a scare it was sodding Malfoy. And she liked that idea much better than the thing Hedwig had suggested.
The boy sent her an extremely pointed look.
Haley pushed him away with a chuckle. "Who's the one using distraction strategies now?" She wasn't stupid.
She didn't feel like doing this now. She hadn't even talked to Justin yet. That was one conversation she did not look forward to. And she sure as hell didn't want to have a similar conversation with Malfoy now. Not with everything that seemed to be floating between them unsaid. Not when she still didn't have the slightest idea on how to behave around the boy. How to talk to him. How to not stare. How to not blush when she looked into his eyes. How to forget that not a week ago this boy had asked her out on an actual date. How was she supposed to keep herself from freaking out over the whole situation?
instead of
Haley squeezed his arm once, before removing her hand and blindly reaching for her cup of tea. It wasn't there.
Well, she wasn’t awfully keen on eating with the Creeveys again. Or possibly facing Neville. So, she followed the boy up the stairs instead.
. Not that
"Simon," she cooed, crushing the boy in her arms, "Of course I'll miss you, dummy. Who wouldn't miss their cute, annoying baby brother?"
always provoked him to such childish behaviour?
"I don't want to sit-"
Did Draco detect worry in her voice? Was she worried about him? He growled. This was hardly the moment to be moved or overcome with useless emotions. He didn't want to be a cat!
When she finally stumbled into The Three Broomsticks it was already early afternoon. Hastily, she squeezed through the mass of students toward the table she spotted Hermione waving from.
"I'll prove it to you." Phew. He didn't seem suspicious. More determined than anything.
HALEY
He snorted, before full out bursting into laughs. It was a beautiful sight. Also, extremely offensive, of course but still… undeniably beautiful.
"Pumpkin," she welcomed her daughter warmly, when she noticed her. She didn't seem the slightest bit surprised to see her. Or ask any questions, for that matter.
"What kind of mirror is this?" She asked in annoyance.
"Shit," Draco cursed. The owl had bit him again. This time it had picked his finger. "Blasted bird", he mumbled, shooing the brown owl away. It hopped closer again. What did it still want? A treat?
She chuckled in disbelief. The
"Let me guess. Another heirloom?" She asked with a nod toward the umbrella.
"Don't look at me like that!" Haley vented, panic starting to creep into her bones. He was always making her lose control. Just by looking at her. Just by showing her that almost-smile. She had been trying so hard to block out her feelings. Any feelings. And he was about to ruin it.
"Your face is way too pretty for that," he says. It's enough to halt me in my tracks.
Now it was time for Haley to get nervous. She hadn't even come up with a suitable excuse to separate from her friends yet.
Haley gasped. "I'm the one not behaving like a human?" She was appalled. She hadn't even said she was playing with Malfoy and she hadn't planned to do that. Not really. She wasn't even sure what she was doing. But these accusations made her question whether it would actually be that wrong if she were planning to string the boy along. "He's been – nothing but a nightmare the last year. Do you know what it was like? Wondering what he might have planned to torment me every single day? Always anticipating another stupid prank with which he could humiliate me?"
"What were you reading earlier by the way?" The girl asked. It was a rather obvious method of distraction. He rolled his eyes but decided to indulge her.
Simon nods. "Dad said that, too. He also said I'm clearly a wizard, or else I couldn't ride a broom. Cause Squibs can't ride broomsticks and everything."
HERMIONE
"What do you mean, Mr Malfoy?"
"I know." She got up on her tip-toes and gently pressed her lips against his cheek. He clasped her fingers tighter.
"What a relief that I don't have a crooked nose or a froggy mouth," Haley said sarcastically, when he pulled away.
"How does it work exactly? The dream walking? How many times have you done it? Which of my dreams have you seen?" He started asking question after question like an eager curious little boy. Even the way he was sitting with his legs folded underneath him and completely turned toward her, showed how hungry he was for answers. And the way his eyes were shining…
"You wanted to thank me?" I say in a casual tone, not even looking at him.
But even though she was never able to save him, at least he was
"Professor Snape," he said politely, while the door closed behind him.
"And your hair is down."
." It was impossible not to hear the sarcasm in that last part. At least the mood seemed lighter now. Playful almost.
"You still haven't reached 4000 yet," a hippogriff informs me as I start to scramble to my feet. What do I do? What do I do? Hermione! I jump over toward my friend's bed and throw the bed curtains open. The scream dies in my throat as I spot the hippogriff that is sleeping in Hermione's bed instead of her.
"So, is there a meeting tonight?" Zacharias Smith asked expectantly.
Now it was Haley's turn to snort. Hermione Granger? Scared of being right? That was one of the most ridiculous things she had ever heard. Did she wish she'd been wrong? Haley didn't dare to ask. The brunette plopped down next to her, pulled her legs up and rested her arms on top of her knees.
"Shut up," she hissed at her brother, elbowing him lightly.
"I sat with the Ravenclaws. That's why you didn't find me," he whispered, his breath ghosting over the side of her face.
HALEY
Draco snorted derisively. "Now I get why he keeps favouring you."
"I'm at the graveyard again and there is Cedric and he-" Haley stopped, unable to continue. Hermione squeezed her hand in support.
The more he learned about the expectations of the evening, the more he both dreaded and looked forward to it with a type of morbid curiosity.  But before the Ball, they had to get Susan and George through their Seasons.
“You said you had a question for me?”
McGonagall eventually returns with grudging permission and after a quick walk to the edge of Hogwarts anti-apparition field, they apparated to the coordinates that Travers provided them.
He is a kind Alpha, he would not like to see you pained in this way.
Oberon mimics him and they resume their walk.
“Ok. Ok.
Harry squirms.
“I was … strongly encouraged to consider your suit.
“I want children,” he says, after a few long moments.
“The Prewett’s fertility is well-known.  George is the only Omega alive from our line.  He’s a  bit of a commodity.  Mum told me she was always worried she’d have an Omega child, that we’d have to be vigilant to keep George safe his whole life.  She said she was thankful when the rest of her children presented as Betas and especially thankful when Bill and Fred presented Alpha.  I think it’s why Fred worked to make his Coven so large so fast, and why he’s so strict with George.”
“Please,” Malfoy interrupts, eyes widening.
“Where’s ‘Mione?” he mumbles after a minute and Ron’s hand stills before slowly retracting.
Burble nods.  “Alpha’s have the ability to hold the attention of Omegas - I’m not sure you would have yet experienced it? It’s called Alpha voice.”
“Alrriiiight, that’s enough bonding for us Omegas today.  Harry, let’s get you back to Dean. I’m sure he’s bored of out his damn skull.”
“I’m glad,” Hermione says.
“Alpha,” she says, reaching out a hand to tangle with Bill’s as she settles gracefully into a seat on the couch beside him.
Harry accepts it without looking down, eyes like lasers meeting Remus’.
Harry bristles. “I was looking for Hermione.”
What you’ve experienced so far with Alphas has been them trying to impose their will on you, for the most part, or not being in control of their rage, which presses on all those troublesome instincts inside of us that want to appease.
Hermione seemed to lose that patience at what was perhaps Harry’s fourth overly-dramatic shudder.  “Alright Potter.  What are you, a first year?  Ron and I are dating.  We kissed.  Get over it.”
“Fred—“
become second nature to him in the way it is to his pureblood classmates.
“There’s … a lot more Harry, honestly.  And I promise that I will do everything I can to get you up to speed and help you thrive.  I promise.  I’ve only been an Alpha for a little while myself, but every day I understand more and between you, me and Ron, we’ll make it out okay.”
Only Hermione and Ron had Presented in time to attend the Ball last year, so the Coven listened attentively as they were told what to expect.  The un-Presented would be kept distracted by the Halloween Ball, held the same night in the Great Hall.  The Presented students would join for the first part of the evening before excusing themselves discretely to attend the Coven Ball on the grounds of the Quidditch Pitch.  There would also be a celebration of Samhain, which Harry, in spite of attending Hogwarts for the last seven years, hadn’t realized was such an important holiday to Wizards until he was told about it in context of this Ball.
To ask another Alpha to make better a pain that she created…”
He hadn’t realized until the prospect had seemed to dwindle how much he’d been looking forward to courting the boy.
Perhaps there was a worse outcome than presenting Omega after all, Harry thought silently.
Her hazel eyes, set in a round face, are narrow and similarly intense, staring out at the trio in an assessing fashion.
“That’s the first thing I don’t get!” Harry exploded.  “Ron tells me everybody gets to choose which Coven they’re going to join, and sometimes it takes weeks for people to decide.  But no one asked my opinion at all!  What if I didn’t want to be in Hermione’s Coven?”
“What will Granger have to say about that decision?” the Ravenclaw replies, because he clearly has a chronic foot-in-mouth problem.
Harry’s eyes felt heavier suddenly and he just nodded, hoping the love in his eyes would be sufficient to comfort Hermione that it was more than okay.  Hermione smiled and continued.
“Don’t start,” George commander curtly, rolling his eyes.  “My brother appears to think I’ve lost my wits as well as my manhood - no don’t look at me like that Harry.  I fear my twin has devolved into nothing but a protective brute, no sense of fun in that one ever since he Presented.”
“Looking good, Potter,” he comments inanely from the armchair to Harry’s left.  Harry shoots him an unimpressed glance.
“You seem better,” the redhead comments.
Which was why it was such a delightful surprise to find that Oberon Travers had been quietly arranging with Hermione a surprise trip to a Professional Quidditch match, for both their Covens to meet and begin to get to know each other as Alpha and Omega courted.
Fred backs down first.
All of a sudden, Harry feels like he’s able to breath again, pulling in an almost panicked breath of air, as he feels the morose lift away.
Ron continues hurriedly, “He’s ok, er, he’ll
“I’ll be in the library,” she says, voice soft, before taking off back in the direction of the castle.
“But that was the full expression of the gift.  There are lesser expressions, permutations like I said.  Prophecy is one of them” - Harry hides his reaction here, familiar as he is with this particular ‘gift’ - “What my great-Oma had was Premonition.”  Susan pauses again, meets Harry’s eyes.
“Don’t finish that. And yes, you stubborn Gryffindor.
“Please, ‘Mione.  I won’t get mad.”
“Yes, that too.”
They all look at George.
Hermione nodded.  “Yes, Mrs. Weasley took me to the Ministry to register me as your Alpha and then to Gringotts right away.  I would have brought you if I could have, Harry, but they won’t allow Omegas to be included in any of the proceedings.  We couldn’t afford to wait, not even a day.  You presented fairly publicly and word had already gotten around the castle that you had presented Omega.  I’m sure some of the Slytherins already had owls headed to their parents to let them know of the news.  We couldn’t risk any competing claims.  Not for you.”
The other is Belvina Burke; Also, as he understood, a family name, who instructed them, quite severely to call her Belle.
He raises an eyebrow and she rushes on.
I bet you would be a lot more comfortable if you were seated, yeah?”
“I see your point,” Hermione sighs. Harry is a little shell-shocked at the sudden realization.
Ron, without a word, held out his hand for the pendant.  Hermione handed it to him and he cast the spell with quiet efficiency, his gaze intent on the pendant cupped in his left hand even as his right hand moved his wand in a competent design.  The pendant floated off his hand after a moment, glowing a light purple hue before dropping back into his palm.  Ron, more solemn than Harry could frequently recall seeing him, looked up at him and met his gaze. “I’d do anything for you mate, anything.  You were always my family, but welcome to the Coven.”
“I’m sure it must be confusing for all of you,” she tells them leaning forward eagerly in her armchair, palms flush against her thighs.  In spite of her welcoming and kind aura, there’s something about her that Harry instinctively dis-likes.  So far this feeling isn’t justified though, so when she glances at him he sends her a wavering half-smile; she smiles warmly back and continues her opening address.  “You suddenly have all these new instincts and you’re expected to just fall into this Wizarding culture that you had absolutely no way knew existed.  Stricture is really cruel in that way.  That’s one of the things that we’ll talk more about in this class - the history of Stricture.  In subsequent lessons we’ll talk in depth about all these new instincts you have, the culture you’ve suddenly entered, and how some of you may have futures that are a bit different than how you originally imagined them.”
Have an awesome weekend and leave me your thoughts, Feather :)
"Is this a letter?" Fred wondered, inspecting the handkerchief carefully. "Could be an… I don't know… an
He reached into his pocket, then turned to her with a frown. "Where's my wand?"
"Hm," she said in a pondering tone, "do you think he…" She turned to Haley for a second.
She couldn't help it. Draco Malfoy as a cat had to be the cutest and at the same time overly dramatic thing in the world. How was he this melodramatic even as a cat? Haley chuckled. She couldn't stop it. She realised her mistake a split second before something white and blurry came flying at her. Fangs bared and hissing madly. It was terrifying, really. Intuitively, she raised her hands like a shield, closing her eyes and waiting for the impact…
Draco slowly took a seat. The man wasn't giving anything away either. With a flick of his wand he made the door fall shut and did something else. Lock it, perhaps? Now, he was starting to feel worried.
It was beyond her how no one took the exams as seriously as her. Didn't they care about their futures? Ron grunted in his sleep, using his homework planner as a teddy bear. The sight was strangely sweet.
HERMIONE
"This is a dream, isn't it?" He asks, his mouth pulled up at the corner.
"What?" She asked and then it dawned on her, fingers flying to her mouth in surprise. "It worked!" She exclaimed, beaming at him. "It's normal again." Her excited little laugh gave his heart a familiar squeeze. He loved seeing her like this. It was even better than the pouting.
"What are you-?" I gape at him, as he licks the ice cream from his fingers. "
"I wish I had a sibling," he says with a sigh.
"Hey, Ron, why don't we play a round of chess, once we're back?"
"What is it then?" Luna asked, still sounding more curious than anything else.
"You forget that I have known you since you were a tiny fledgling. I can tell when something bothers you."
"That." The Slytherin reached for the quill that lay on top of her finished essay and held it in front of his face curiously.
Everything hurt. His body felt as if he had been launched right off the Astronomy Tower. Which was only slightly exaggerated.
What an idiot. "Sure, that's exactly why I'm on the quidditch team," she replied sarcastically but started to climb up the ladder nevertheless. She wasn't going to let the boy think she was scared of a stupid ladder.
"You dreamed of this?" I reply mockingly. It's so sad that he can't appreciate the irony.
"I'm not the one who forgot this precious quill in the library. I merely found it," he said, as he inspected the quill closely.
The Slytherin left their compartment and marched away without a glance back.
"See you," she breathed in her dreamy way that said everything and nothing at once, before turning around and disappearing down the hall in the opposite direction.
"She's not in there," Luna said quietly.
"Sure. She won't break the Code."
"Master Draco! Your chocolate!" Dobby exclaimed in horror. Oh, shit. He had forgotten to keep stirring the liquid. And now his chocolate was a stinking, black mass at the bottom of his pot. He groaned in frustration.
Malfoy's smile widened, and he sighed in a way that Haley swore was full of relief.
"I'm trying," she muttered, balling her hands to fists. She couldn't let him get this far into her mind again. He had almost seen…
He folded it up and shoved it over toward the girl.
"I know! What do you think I'm doing? You're the one who walked into me."
She closed her eyes, then. "Goodbye, Draco."
"I'm sure I can make it work," he replies, grinning cheekily. "Pick anything you like. It's my treat." He informs me, nodding at the display in front of us. I want to tell him that it doesn't matter anyway because this is a dream and he's not
DRACO
?" He asked for the third time without getting an answer. And what was taking Potter so long anyway? He wasn't too early, was he?
What Simon said made sense. On a certain level.
"I'm fine," the girl answered, squeezing her friend's hand that was gripping her shoulder tightly.
. And what meeting were you talking about anyway?"
"Haley! Breakfast!" Simon yelled the two words as if his life depended on them.
"Yeah," she breathed looking at her hand, that Neville was still holding, inspecting it for injuries.
Disappointments. Wherever he looked there were nothing but disappointments waiting for him. Hermione. Crookshanks. All that blasted cat had to do was rip up that scumbag's skin. A simple task. And the biggest disappointment of them all? Ron's so-called best friend. He'd never felt more betrayed than this. Not even when Haley had been chosen as the Hogwarts champion two years before. Although he had been really mad because of that. Or when Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Krum. That had felt like a stab in the back. And now… well, mostly he was disappointed. And incredibly angry. He still wasn't completely sure this wasn't actually a gigantic joke by the twins. Had he fallen into some kind of parallel dimension?
– courage maybe? – on his wand, Haley decided to give him some space after all. At least a little bit of it. She stepped backwards toward the huge circular window between her bed and her desk and hopped onto the windowsill. (It was her favourite spot in the room. Terribly comfortable with pillows and her favourite books and everything.) (Even a secret stash of chocolate.)
"And that may just serve as enough of a diversion to give you a chance to speak to Snuffles," Fred added.
"You could say that," Malfoy confirmed. He raised his eyebrows expectantly like he was waiting for her to understand. But what was so great about a magic umbrella that recorded memories?
His fingers reached for her face and started to caress her skin. "You know the rest." His grey eyes flicked toward the chocolate dragon between them. "It's like a reminder," he continued. "that I don't ever want to hurt you again."
"Watch your mouth, you wretched little – what do you have there?"
Haley crossed her arms and lifted her chin defiantly. "No. That's unlikely."
to prove it.
He raised his hand toward her face and tilted it upwards, making her look at him. The movement caused her hood to fall away from her face, but it didn't matter. They were the only two people in the night.
Haley bit her lips. She had to admit her excuses didn't sound plausible at all or pretty original.
"There's really no reason to be that happy about it." He said grumpily but pulled her closer nevertheless.
What? But I'm the one who stole his gobstone. Why…?
"Oh, right." Draco cleared his throat, obviously swallowing down his curiosity. "It's Professor Umbridge, sir – she needs your help. They've found Montague, he's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor."
"You're just going to let her go like that?" He asked sceptically.
"It wasn't Filch's cat, was it?"
"Yeah," she answered quietly, "I got it from my godfather."
The words got stuck in her throat. He looked so sincere. His eyes alight with sparks of emotion. She'd never seen him like this. He never showed his feelings so openly.
"How?" He finally asked, his voice trembling with eagerness and helpless desperation. "How can I make it up to you?"
"All right." She said, interlacing her fingers with his. "We won't give up, then."
"No, we didn't break up – we–" I stop myself, needing a moment to make sense of the chaotic mess that is our conversation. "You want me to come visit… and bring Draco along… so we can try out your new potion experiment?"
"That was brilliant! You really are a potions genius," Hermione complimented her.
"I know who you are," Luna said without looking up from her magazine, "You're Ginny's brother."
She'd get another chance to tell him. Luna had said the interview wouldn't be published until another two weeks. There was still time.
Hermione sighed. "Fine, I can't force you to tell me. I'll be here, when you're ready."
"White blond is quite rare actually," he replied, taking a step toward her and running his fingers along her braid. "It's a Malfoy thing." He winked at her in a way that was mischievous and somehow warm at the same time, leaving her strangely nervous. As if there was something he wasn't telling her. He was even blushing slightly. Was it something embarrassing?
"It's either something incredibly expensive or… a really dark and evil artefact that can only be found at Nocturne Alley."
Hermione watched her for a moment, before nodding once.
No longer confined in that house he hated more than anything.
"You know… that list you make so everyone else knows what to get you for Christmas," he explained to her in a tone that made her feel
"That's the whole point of it," I agree with her.
. He wasn't perfect. Far from it. But Haley wasn't perfect either. All she knew was that being with him made her feel happier than she had felt in a long time. If ever. And that was what she wanted to show him.
Malfoy left the scene, but Haley could still hear him cackling along with his cronies.
"I… I don't know if I…" Almost self-consciously Emily kicked her foot. She did it in such a clumsy way that she lost her balance and would have fallen if she hadn't reached out to hold onto Haley's sleeve.
"Hm?" He sounded slightly distracted.
"That wasn't just attraction!" Haley protested. But Hermione didn't seem to believe her.
"What?" He asked, quirking an eyebrow and adding another spoonful of sugar.
“Why’d she wink at you?” I want to know.
Haley sighed. "Fine," she agreed.
room!" Simon argued, ducking out of the way. The pillow hit the wall with a disappointing thud.
"Mum, why…? Is that Professor Snape?" I ask, nodding toward the man in the back, who I now notice looks as young as mum. "And did you just call him
Now, that was enough to melt the heart of a big sister.
"Not until you've promised you won't bother me anymore!" Haley insisted. Her long braid was hovering directly over Malfoys face, tickling him. He freed his right hand from her grip and swatted her hair away in annoyance.
What book? She couldn't be talking about
"It doesn't have to be exceptionally big." He interlaced his fingers with hers. "Just make it big enough to fit me… and you."
"Oh that," Lovegood answered, "Feel free to take it, I don't need it."
"My prank book!" Haley exclaimed, clutching the book to her chest. "I knew you'd taken it."
It took him a moment to understand she was talking about the book.
Mum openly laughs at me. "You wanted to look intimidating and fierce," she replies with an amused grin.
"My little pumpkin," Mum soothes, gently brushing the new tears from my cheeks with her knuckles. I feel like I'm five again, falling off my broomstick, my back hurting and the disappointment in dad's eyes hurting even more. Or like when I was ten, and dad chose to go and watch one of Simon's junior quidditch games instead of coming to support my first guitar performance. Or like when I was thirteen and Professor Trelawney told me I had a pretty face but she could see little beyond that in my future. Or like at the beginning of last year when Neville told me he wanted to break up with me for no apparent reason at all. I'm never enough. Maybe I'll never be.
A quick glance told her that he had indeed been burned by something. His right hand was soaked with a dark liquid and the teacup that Haley hadn't touched was upside down next to it. The Slytherin glared at the cup like it had personally offended him and wiped his hand on the blanket.
As Haley watched her brother lick the syrupy chocolate off his finger, she pondered the meaning of his words. What else could it be? The beginning? Well, she'd certainly find out, once Draco woke up.
With a smile on her face, she bounced down the corridor toward the Great Hall.
"What is it then?" Hermione asked curiously, crawling onto the bed beside her. Haley sat up and rubbed her face.
"What's that?" He asked pointing at her bowl of soup. "I've never seen it at our table."
"Morning." She greeted him with a yawn.
"My mum," she murmured finally, "It's what her hair looked like."
Draco nodded once. Then he seemed to make a decision. "Alright. I want to try."
"It's not Diggory though, is it?" Draco called, grabbing the first best thought from his mind.
When he noticed her, he seemed almost surprised. Maybe, he'd thought she wasn't going to come just like she herself had.
Hermione sighed. "I'm not going to lie," was all she replied.
"Maybe," he replied. "At least he couldn't try out his 'Approval' on us."
Haley looked up in surprise.
"Um… Hermione?"
Haley sighed. How was she going to explain this? "So… my mum invited me to come home on the weekend…"
She pulled away, sinking back to the soles of her feet again. A fiery blush was colouring her cheeks red, making her look even lovelier than before. She bit her lips nervously, her eyes fixed on his shoulder. "Good night, Draco," she whispered, her gaze flicking up to his for a split second. Then she removed her hand from his face, picked up her broomstick and the Invisibility Cloak and fled into the darkness of the hall.
Haley woke up with a start. The darkness around her left her disoriented and confused.
!" She hissed angrily.
"You're not going to follow me, are you?" She asked suspiciously.
"But sometimes," he interrupted her, "I'm doing my best to ignore it because there are things that are more important." He whispered that last part. Was he talking about her? He was so close that she could feel his breath on her face. Was he going to kiss her? She glanced at his lips briefly, realising that she wanted him to kiss her. She looked back into his eyes that were shining silvery and with a hint of blue. They seemed so steady, so sure like he exactly knew what it was that he wanted. But she still didn't know what it was that
"For example," Haley continued. "Instead of making a pillow float, the whole class would end up floating. Or… he would transfigure a button into a four poster instead of a chair…" Now that she thought about it, there had been lots of instances like that in the past year. "What… does that mean?"
"Ah, that," he mused, "Why are you so sure, I didn't mean it?"
." I scoff. "I'm not brave at all and much too selfish and-" Why am I saying all this? And why are my eyes starting to burn? I'm not going to cry!
Haley simply watched her, surprised over her strong reaction.
"Who are the two of you waiting for?" A dreamy voice asked into the silence. Ginny and Haley both jumped at the same time.
"Ah, shoot!" Simon complained, messing his hair up in annoyance. "That was my knight."
"'s fine. You don' have to," she mumbled, already half-asleep. Maybe she would just sleep right here. But then she was suddenly lifted up, two arms coming up around her back and under her legs.
"Haley, over here!"
That sounded familiar. Was the boy trying to re-enact that dream he'd had the other night?
Have fun and keep reading, Feather :)
"And?" Haley urged. She twirled the end of her braid around her fingers in anticipation. She couldn't even eat.
She bit her lips, feeling her heartbeat speeding up. "Do you–?"
"Yes, totally."
"What? You've never noticed them before?" I say arrogantly, rolling my eyes.
"So, does this mean you forgive me?" He sounds so eager. But I can't let him off this easily. It's much easier not to be charmed by him now that he doesn't look like a child any more.
"Oops, thought you were Simon. Why'd you steal my brother's bed?" Haley replied nonchalantly.
"I messed up," I wail dramatically. "I m-messed up
Haley snorted. "You're the one who wanted to meet up after curfew! Should I tell your new favourite teacher about that?"
kind of cute." He teased her with a smirk.
"I…" He didn't know. He didn't know what to do.
DRACO
"Because–" she started but she had no idea how to answer him. "Because I…"
He continued ignoring her. "She's fine," he told himself, starting to walk back and forth in the dank bathroom. "Just fine. You don't need to worry."
With a groan he sits up and glares at me. "What is it? I'm trying to fall asleep!"
She ignored his protests.
"There might be another way." Professor Snape revealed, leaning back in his own chair.
"Have you tried picturing it?" She asked finally.
"Fine," he agreed. "But you have to keep your promise."
"No." She replied lightly.
"Oh! It's because of your name, right?" Luna commented.
Draco shook his head. He wasn't in the mood for this. "Nobody calls me 'Draco'. Except for my family." He frowned. "And Pansy, I guess. But she's
HALEY
Haley said nothing. Just silently returned his smouldering gaze. She didn't know whether it was stubbornness that made her react like this. But what else could it be? Why did she suddenly feel this protective of Malfoy? Why did she feel the need to defend him? If nothing else, she knew she didn't like her godfather talking about the boy like this.
"Sugar Tea?" Malfoy questioned, frowning slightly, as he picked up the umbrella and stuffed it into his bag as well.
"Yeah? Then how do you explain the notes and everything?" He pressed.
"Sure," she agreed and took the books. Hidden behind the books, Luna slipped something else into her fingers. A piece of paper. Haley's eyes widened but Luna wasn't even looking at her and instead kept sifting through her bag.
The music builds up in preparation for the chorus. There is a little grin on Malfoy's face as he gets ready for the next part. The chorus starts and as Malfoy finally opens his eyes I notice that we're not in the class room anymore. The tiny makeshift stage has turned into a gigantic space with stage lights and huge amplifiers. In front of the stage a crowd of screaming and dancing teenagers has appeared. While I find myself at the edge of the stage, noticing all of these changes Malfoy continues singing in the background.
memories? She only hoped the potion master would be busy taking care of Montague for some time…
"No, it's not that, it's just–" he sighed, running one of his hands over his pale face that was blotted with red spots. "I'm really trying, you know? I want this to
"Right. So, you said I can enter someone's dream only if I have something that belongs to them right?"
The boy raised an eyebrow, obviously expecting her to go on. But there was nothing else to say. For the moment.
she had found out about Malfoy in the first place.
"Look, Michael, I'm-"
At least she knew what she was doing where potions were concerned. One more pinch of glum grass and – the potion turned a warm purple. Just like it should. She sighed in relief.
"You'll see when it comes to that!"
. Huh. The potion master would have laughed at him!
I look back toward my door with the painting and the thorns. How did mum get in there anyway? I don't even know my own defence mechanism! If I even have one. I'll have to come up with a riddle or something. Just in case. But for now there is something else to do.
Simon's eyes went innocently wide. For a second, he even looked sympathetic. "Okay," he answered, slightly pouting. "But you owe me."
"See you after lunch!" She called back, filled with a sudden excitement. Running off with Malfoy like that felt exhilarating somehow. Even if she was ditching her friends for him. Or maybe even because of it. It was one of these things that seemed silly until you tested them out yourself.
“I’ll talk to Hermione,” he says.
He tries to stay out of it and enjoy the day.
“Don’t be ridiculous. You can’t go to the COA over an Alpha asking his Omega to consider a reasonable proposal from a viable Alpha.
What bullshit.
Well she’s definitely garnered Harry’s undivided attention now.  He’d never really given a lot of thought to where magic came from or why some people had the ability to tap into it and others didn’t.  Strange, in retrospect, given his childhood in a muggle home.  But after he’d learned about the wizarding world, magic had always just flowed so easily for him.  It just felt like another part of nature - one that only some people were in tune with.
So I really don’t know - you’re going to have to ask him.
“Yeah,” he agrees but doesn’t expand.
“I don’t care that you would consider others.
He needs Settling.”
Harry splutters, hands fidgeting in surprise at the pet name and he shoots a glare at the man, annoyed at him for the chuckle he gets at his reaction.
Harry tries for an inviting smile, but it comes out wavering and he casts his eyes down before he’s forced to take in Fleur’s reaction.
Slowly, Ron and Hermione follow suit.
Surely you have suitors falling out of your ears.
The Hogwarts Express runs several schedules for the return after the holidays and the Weasley party had taken the latest departure tiem.
“Good to know, but that wasn’t my question.
Oberon crinkles his nose.
Spent a lot of time watching it on telly.”
Harry smiles.
“It’s signed,” Malfoy tells him after a moment.
He meets her eyes and gives her a small smile.
He nods, jerkily and Bill hums.
“Except for the whole infertility thing,” Harry said without thinking before wincing at his thoughtlessness.  “Ugh, I’m sorry Ron.  Maybe Boot’s foot-in-mouth disease is contagious.”
George snickered. “Zachy-bear and Susan here have been courting for the last 6 months, since about 5 months after Susan presented.   We’re all expecting the news of their impending nuptials any day now.”
I think she was rooting for some of them to escape the Ministry’s Oblivators.”
“I want to head over to Mungo’s.
But Ron just nods, shrugging slightly.
We’d spend hours out there while she worked.
Do you … do you want children right away?”
Harry frowns. “How - “
His eyes, almond-shaped, and framed by generous, dark lashes, are a deep blue color that settle on Harry with an intensity that immediately has butterflies fluttering in his stomach.
The Slytherin is gazing at him with earnest, pleading eyes.
Ron drops down to his elbows on the grass and looks up at the sky.  “I don’t know.  But I think he wants the option.”
It’s brutal and physical, in the way that Harry has really only seen Muggles behave.  Wizards have a tendency to manage their disputes with magic, which has its own physical toll, of course, but Ernie must have been so infuriated that magic felt too impersonal.  Instead he wracks the other boy under a barrage of fists and kicks.  McGonagall and Flitwick look on disapprovingly but do not intervene, much to Harry’s consternation.
“I think we should talk about Fight.”
She specifically thought their obession with ghosts was hilarious.
“I don’t want to send you off on this note.
“Yes, that’s true.  And someone with full Sight is known as a Seer.  But as much as Professor Trelawney likes to tout she’s got the Sight, there hasn’t been a full Seer in generations.  Not since Cassandra Trelawney.  It’s a dangerous gift.  It drove Cassandra mad.
“It’s a game played on a big grassy field.
Hermione and Fred are finishing up their conversation and Hermione crooks a finger at Harry who rolls his eyes at the summons, but obeys regardless, giving George a little farewell wave as Fred rejoins him.
The emotion must translate in his scent because Bill says softly, “It’s no problem Harry, this is just between us.
And in one fell swoop, after one burst of magic, Fred and George were both out for the count.”
The two are just overlapping - Harry is coming in to take his shift while Padma is leaving to rush to Transfiguration, but the girl is cagey when Harry tries to ask her about it.
Wouldn’t you want to know about Covens and Alphas and Omegas and Betas, even if you couldn’t fully participate?”
“I was courting another when we met, but Bill’s proposal was more promising by far, and my Alpha decided we should pursue it.”
“Excellent, it’s a date.
Harry considers.
“I mean..that is…no?”
Don’t know how she slept through the initial crazy, but there was no way she missed the magic.”
They break things off regardless, speaking in low tones to each other before Tonks laughs and turns away, heading back up to the house with a “Hi’ya Potter,” as she passes.
Hermione glares but Ron carries on.
Fred sighs, stares down at his hands.
Won’t you forgive me?”
But, Harry, you have to have hope too.
He twirls his arm in a manner Harry assumes means he’s been given leave to speak.
Harry shakes his head, confused.
Hermione invites Ron and Harry back to her tent after, citing some ‘Coven business’ to the rest of the household and they agree to come back soon for gifts and festivities, with the unspoken hope that George and Fred will be up as well.
“No one is quite sure where magic came from,” Burbage says, “but there has been wide consensus in the field of magical theory for many years that it has a form of sentience.  That is - it is not a passive force in the world that exists only for Wizards to tap into at will.  To some extent, magic appears to have its own will and agenda.  This has been proven, for example, in the occasional genesis of new magical creatures and beings - forms of life that have been shaped by magic Itself.  Other ways that magic has proven It’s intent has been in the development of new forms and styles of magic.  There is more that we do not understand about magic and It’s intent than what we do, but we know that the most important goal It possesses is its continued existence.  Magic, for example, has provided insight via the future arts and the gift of prophecy in order to avert crises in the past that would have resulted in large numbers of magical deaths.  It played an active role in the development of Hogwarts and other magical schools and it shaped places like the Forbidden Forest to protect its creatures.
“Oh?” Harry asks.  He definitely hadn’t mentioned the situation between Susan and Zacharias to the other Gryffindor and was curious as to what he had found out since then.
Finally, he nods, pushing away from the table to stand up and head to the entrance of the room.
“New Fledge Alphas almost always have an adult sponsor who helps guide them in leading a Coven.  Hermione’s pretty rare, being a female Alpha and all, so it was a pretty perfect fit for mum to sponsor her…”
“I’d rather it last for days if only it would come less!” Susan exclaims.
I think we can trust them with that much.
“Thank you for proving my point,” Oberon tells him and Harry can only drop his jaw indignantly.
I want to give my Coven every advantage, and there’s no denying the need for an Omega.
But the twins don’t look at all guilty by this failure in foresight.
When they’re back by the pond, and away from any hidden ears — Ron casts a privacy spell to ensure it, while Hermione, obviously sulking, waits, facing away from Harry and tapping her foot impatiently — Hermione spins around and bites out, “What are you playing at, Potter?”
Then I slip out of his room and find myself in a hall with familiar doors. The dream corridor is deserted as always. Closing the door behind myself, I turn left and walk down the hall until I reach the door with the
"What was the password?" She wanted to know.
Haley narrowed her eyes at him, pushing him down into the couch. "I might still change my mind."
"What?"
And Luna… Ron tried to think of a useful spell to free her from her own captor but the girl sort of slowly ducked out under Warrington's arms, giving him a smile and whispering an incantation that made his eyes droop and him fall asleep at once. Ron blinked. Impressive. It seemed, she knew how to defend herself.
"Not if you turn him into a cute little kitten before he gets the chance," the boy replied with a grin that seemed so mischievous, she was afraid that her clothes were actually see-through and she was the only one who hadn't noticed. She looked down at her pyjama bottoms and jumper combo, which seemed as non-transparent as before.
HALEY
"Brought me a snack, did you?" Malfoy remarked, glancing toward the blueberry cupcake in her right hand.
Haley crossed her arms, feeling strangely exposed.
you keep beneath your pillow."
"Good morning!" A high voice greeted from behind her. She turned around trying not to groan. One of the Creeveys. What did he want this time?
"Mum, the potion alarm went off. It says 'stir clock-wish' or something." Simon informs her.
"Wow, this is…" Draco couldn't hide the awe in his voice. The cellar was at least as well stocked as their potions classroom at school. There were three fireplaces at the far side of the room, the walls were lined with shelves, holding countless jars filled with all kinds of mysterious ingredients. In the left hand corner, several spare cauldrons were stacked. From one of the cauldrons in the back small clouds of steam were fogging up the whole room.
This was just a little fun. They were having fun
"Well, then," the girl said after a moment, "Goodnight, Draco Malfoy."
"Hi!" She greeted them nonchalantly, plopping down on one of the armchairs.
He punched against the glass from inside, not even causing a small crack. "Help me!"
"Yes. Everyone is talking about it. But as of yet nothing is confirmed. As the president of the Gryffindor quidditch team fan club I need to take care of your image. Do you want to give an official statement?"
Obliviously, strutting down the expected path. A path he'd chosen himself as well.
"Good luck with your mission!"
," Hermione said firmly, putting out the fire and leaving behind a wet little pile of ash.
"An idiot? Didn't I help you get your voice back?"
He settled under the covers, struggling to keep his eyes open. And then, like a switch had been flipped, his eyes closed, his breathing evening out. Draco Malfoy looked peaceful when he was asleep. Who would have thought?
(See the end of the chapter for
He nodded seriously, the tip of his nose tickling lightly when it accidentally touched hers.
" he added nonchalantly, his self-satisfied grin made her think of a striped cat she had once seen in a muggle book. Wait. What had he said just now?
Her gaze wandered from Haley to Ron and finally lingered on their blank parchments. She rolled her eyes and sighed. "I see. This really shouldn't be that surprising," she muttered taking the seat Luna had vacated only minutes before and spread out her notes over the table. Working on the assignment wasn't any more fun than it had been before but with Hermione present they at least got
"Ha ha," Haley retorted.
But then, what was she supposed to do? Give up and admit defeat?
"It's fine, I- I hope she says yes."
HALEY
The obvious way he was trying not to laugh gave her the rest. She had to make a hilarious sight. She snorted, before chuckling softly herself. The absurdity of the situation! If Uncle Vernon could see her now.
"It's fine," Haley shook her head. "Right, we should-"
"I'm here." She whispered back, pressing herself closer against his body, taking in his familiar scent, mixed with coffee and sweat. It could've smelled unpleasant but in that moment, she really couldn't care less. "I can share my magic with you. I've got enough for both of us."
The words that were glaring up at him like a twisted ironic joke hit him just as hard as a curse would have.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, actually. Uhm, do you know the tapestry of that wizard who's trying to teach trolls ballet? It's on the seventh floor and there's a room on the opposite side of it."
The map lead her out of the castle, across the grounds until she found herself close to the Great Lake beneath a huge willow. (Not the whomping one.) The long branches reaching softly into the water against the slowly darkening sky painted a dreamy scene that she couldn't even appreciate the beauty of. Where was that dunderhead? She couldn't spot him anywhere. Was this a trick?
"I would also advise you to stop trying to find out things that are none of your concern about someone who is willing to help you. For now."
With one raised eyebrow he replied. "Well, sometimes, things change."
Ron shook his head and turned back to the blonde. "Don't mind them. They're mental," he said dismissively.
"I'm here," says the voice and then I spot something fluttering close to my face. It's a tiny human with leathery, dragonlike wings that glimmer in different colours of the rainbow. It's my mum.
"I-I ne-never said a-anything about l-love," she stuttered, feeling a bit flustered. "But… I may be dating him."
," she told the Fat Lady and stepped through the portrait hole into the common room. As she sunk into one of the armchairs and closed her eyes she thought to herself that she wasn't going to set a foot into the dream corridor this time.
"Nothing," she said quietly, silently pleading with the boy to just let it go.
at me."
Haley didn't say anything, she only stared at him in silence. She couldn't believe the git was actually using these words
Haley kicked his leg underneath the table.
"This is a library! How dare you disturb the peaceful silence with these dirty words!" Madame Pince shrieked. She had appeared out of nowhere and only seconds later she shooed them almost violently out of the library.
He followed her gaze. "I wasn't killing it," he said around a scowl, placing the poor, pitiful muffin back with the luckier ones. Oh, he was annoyed with her now. Well, at least he wasn't hiding how he was feeling any more.
"Neville!" She exclaimed, thinking of another thing.
she said instead.
Was he trying to become the next Draco Malfoy?
"Guess you'll have to find out at the Yule Ball along with everyone else."
"Mum!" I whine, tearing at my new hair. "I look like a
She hadn't known it was possible to feel this much pain.
"I promise." She cut him off, diving forward to plant a clumsy kiss on his oh so soft lips.
Hey there! This is terribly late. I apologize. I was kinda in a slump lately. You know, it's really hard to get motivated during this quarantine... Anyhow. Hope you enjoy this fluffiness :) Stay safe and positive and leave me your thoughts!
Potter turned to look at him. "It's over," she said quietly. Draco's heart sank at her words. What? Why was it over when it hadn't even started yet?
"No…" His eyes started to focus once more. But his mind still seemed far away. "I saw him again… walking through the hall. It was a few days after the ball and I just – I was so
. Inside, there are people laughing and joking and seem to be having a good time. There is a bar counter to the right and a small elevated stage in the back corner, where a witch that looks suspiciously like Gwenog Jones is playing a jolly tune on the harpsichord.
"There was… a spell." His voice began to tremble, only a bit. Haley almost didn't notice it. "I found it in an old potions book. '
"I didn't-"
Haley didn't want to talk to Neville any longer. This conversation had seriously been exhausting. Why wasn't he leaving? Maybe he'd get the hint if she pretended he wasn't there. Instead, she focused on Draco. His blanket had slipped down somewhat. So Haley leaned forward and pulled up the covers, gently tucking them in around his shoulders.
"What's that?" The girl asked curiously.
Haley nodded.
"Thank you," she said, filling some water into a bowl and placing it in front of the owl.
"No more exploring tonight," she instructs.
"So, quidditch." He tries again. "I confused Baz' bag with mine. He took my bag and found my diary. And then… I told him to give it back but he didn't want to. So, we fought about it and then it fell to the ground."
"I mean – I
I'm floored. She's completely right, of course. But I never mentioned a name in my letter. So… how does she know?
"Come on, we should go," she said, voice still tinged with laughter. Draco didn't want to go. If they left now it meant their time together was almost over. The walk back to Hogwarts was all that was left.
"Alright." He whispered, his heart beating slightly slower now. Then his eyes widened and it sped up again.
A surprised gasp slips out of my mouth. It's not loud. And he definitely shouldn't have heard it. But somehow he did as it seems. (Maybe because this is a dream?) The boy turns his head, looking for the source of the noise.
– it's just…I…" She shrugged, unable to express why she found all of this so unsettling.
"Tell Haley that." Luna advised, placing a hand on his arm. The weight was comforting. "Why don't you go and tell her after the game? You're going to cheer for Gryffindor, too, aren't you?"
"Go!" He thundered. "It's not a spell! It means I don't want to see you any more!"
"It's Thursday!"
Haley took that as a sign to continue. "I'd tell you to think about it carefully and take your time but… we kind of don't have much time because the full moon is losing its power and then the potion will stop working, I think."
"You like painting, don't you?" The boy asks, a soft smile on his lips.
