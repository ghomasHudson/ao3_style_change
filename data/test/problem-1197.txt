“Right,” said Harry, attempting to sound unimpressed, but his eyes darted over the page with interest. “And what, they just fly around like this?”
He tumbled through a string of memories, which bled together like dripping paint. Clearly the memory had been played through so many times it was becoming distorted, merged in a way Draco had never seen before. A dark-haired boy and a red-haired girl befriending each other on a playground, a sorting ceremony, a fight, the word
“Don’t you dare,” she said, her wand already in her hand in a duelling stance.
“Yes, I suppose growing up together as two only children, we became something of siblings. She has no qualms telling me everything I’m doing wrong.”
said Harry, tucking the moving picture of his parents standing among a group of people back between the pages as a bookmark. He scrubbed his hands over his eyes and leaned back in his chair.
“Oh! That reminds me, there was one thing Harry brought up that was strange,” she said abruptly. “He was asking about his reading, you know, from the gala night. He wanted to know more about this betrayal.”
“Right,” said Harry, pulling the chain around his neck to draw the heavy golden locket into the light. “Horcruxes. So far we have the ring and the diadem. Where did you find the locket?”
“Cheers, you two,” he said.
“What’s wrong with it?” asked Cedric, turning to Draco.
They stared at each other silently for a moment before she spoke. The sound of Vernon’s heavy snoring resonated from the far end of the hall.
“I seriously can’t think of anything more useless than a switching spell,” said Harry.
“Can I come in?” he asked from the doorway.
“It definitely is,” said Hermione, casting a diagnostic spell which glowed blue. “And no curses on it either from the looks of things. Old Riddle probably thought it was safe in Gringotts. Should we test it out? It’s meant to have healing properties.”
He was being ridiculous. Sure he had feelings for Malfoy – who wouldn’t? He was beautiful, powerful, brilliant. That he was a boy had been a flicker of a question in Harry’s mind that he bypassed with ease the first time Draco looked at him after a Legilimency session and understood him completely.
“I know what you mean,” said Luna, attempting to puff up her parchment ball. “If only you could see more of the castle. I just know you would love it.”
Harry let go of a tenseness in his chest, and his grip on the wand relaxed. “Thanks,” he said. “I promise we’ll do whatever we can with this information. For everyone’s sake.”
But when the door opened it was not the gaunt frame of Professor Snape that answered, but a harassed looking house-elf.
Draco folded the map and handed it back to Voldemort. “I’m sorry, my Lord, but I know nothing of the Potter boy other than what I read in the papers.”
What in Merlin’s name was going on? Draco immediately went into emergency mitigation mode, mumbling out some excuse or other, but his brain was shutting down on him. He stood, refastening his belt and sorting through which cover story would have the most lasting power in this situation. Perhaps it was the whiskey, or the lateness of the hour, or the insane series of events he’d lived through in the last day, but he was not ready to be found out by Angelica of all things.
“I don’t understand,” said Harry, frowning. What had the other wand done? Was his wand strong or weak? Of course, he would pick a wand that added another hurdle to his journey.
“Merely that the ring disappeared around the same time as old Marvolo Gaunt died and the bloodline dried up. It’s been decades since it was seen, but was prized by many as a relic of Salazar Slytherin,” recited the shopkeeper obediently, though he was looking at Draco with a certain shrewdness. “Young master certainly wouldn’t be trying to sell the ring, would you?”
Draco scoffed. “Your big ego must be getting in the way of your memory. Slytherin beat Gryffindor practically every year.”
“Not to worry, I plan to keep her alive a while longer,” said Voldemort, bending low to place his face close to Charlotte’s. He inhaled deeply. “Let’s make a deal. I’ll give you the girl, if you agree to meet with me here.”
They were just determining whether a
Draco started to reply, but the words caught in his mouth. “Well, not anyone in particular, but people who fought for the right sorts of things. Most of the general public are too inept at politics to really govern themselves. But appointing a counsel of leaders who knew what was best for society, the right and proper order of things, it would maximise utility for the whole.”
For Potter’s part, maybe it would be some comfort to him to believe he had a friend in these most trying of circumstances. He was doing Harry a kindness, really. After all, what would hurt worse in the end; betrayal or suffering in solitude?
Draco kicked himself for the flicker of interest and excitement he’d started feeling every time the bespectacled idiot was in eyeshot. If he were smart, he wouldn’t have let himself get so invested in the mark.
“Great!” Tonks rose to her feet, slapping Draco on the back unceremoniously and levitated their plates to the sink with a clatter. “You’ll be fine, chances are nothing even happens. Nine times out of ten it’s just a walk in the park.”
“It can be used for healing too.” Luna glanced over to observe Harry’s progress. “Maybe when we repot the mimbletonia, I can pickle some clippings. That’s bound to bring out its hidden properties, don’t you think?”
“Obviously not,” said Draco, as he willed himself to be patient. Even if Potter was raised by Muggles it really wouldn’t do to go through life knowing nothing. “There’s centuries worth of history to the game. You have to see it for yourself, our first match at Hogwarts is in November.”
Draco paused for a moment, processing what she’d said, and before he knew it she was playfully pushing his shoulders down to the bed, now completely on top of him. The golden curtain of hair fell over her shoulders, brushing lightly against his chest.
“No!” he cried, his hate-filled eyes turning back to Harry. “My servants are loyal, Potter. You may think you have found the key to my undoing but there are vessels impossible for you to have claimed, items close to me.”
“Keep reading, Granger. Does she say whether she thinks she can get out?” asked Draco.
The remainder of the holidays at the Manor were a grim affair.
“How did you know that?” asked Hermione, her voice no more than a whisper, tears welling in her eyes.
“There was a note in it,” said Cedric, handing it across for Hermione and Harry to see. “Someone already came for the locket in the cave and replaced it with this one. He knew it was a Horcrux too – someone called RAB.”
“Master…” said Kreacher, in a strained voice, dropping the tea tray and taking a few shuffling steps towards the group.
“To pay for a place to park your car,” said Harry, flipping to a chapter called Non-Magical Professions.
They were reaching the end of the front nine when Draco connected with Mr DuPont again. He’d taken a strong first shot and he and Edgar were heading in the same direction towards their balls.
“You’re lucky I don’t think you’re a suspicious arse anymore, you know that?”
The news reported showers of shooting stars and unusual flight patterns for owls, which made Minerva nervous. Not because those were bad omens, but because she realised she was in the middle of one of the rare moments when her world threatened to break open into the Muggle world.
McGonagall came around on Monday to escort Hermione and a glamoured Harry back through the castle for Ollivander’s return visit.
More to the point, the task at hand was obvious. To teach Potter Occlumency would be to have access to the deepest part of his brain. To train him would mean delving into his most protected memories, perhaps even discovering how Potter survived. The limitations of the Fidelius Charm would be a hurdle for another day.
If he wanted to learn about potions, which he very much did not, he would rather approach a prickly Professor Malfoy than listen to her  monologue about how she invented Amortentia, no matter how impressive it was. The unending flirtation alone was enough to put him off the subject, and women, altogether.
“Are you sure we should keep going, Hermione? You seem distracted,” said Harry. Hermione sat opposite him at the table by the elf shelf, furiously scribbling notes into a weathered journal.
“Except for Harry,” said Luna.
“I’m with Harry on this one,” said Cedric from his place by the window. All eyes in the room turned to him. Even Harry was shocked to hear the usually stoic Auror agreeing to something the others clearly thought was ludicrous.
They had tried tracking down objects of value from the Gaunt lineage as well, but that line of searching dried up once it was discovered that the last members of that family died in destitute squalor. The ring, wherever Al had found it, had certainly been a lucky break.
The figure of Albus Dumbledore reached into his pocket (surely he had not travelled all this way with a baby in his robes?) and pulled out his Deluminator, darkening the street lamps before approaching the garden wall where she was perched. He sat down slowly and deliberately, keeping his eyes fixed over the quiet lawns of the neighbouring houses.
“Yes, yes, alright,” said Draco, as Kreacher started pushing him out of the kitchen by the back of the knees. “We better clear out of here then.”
Her red lips were pressed into a straight line, her fingers twisted together on her lap. “I’m not,” he continued, more calmly, placing a hand over hers. “I’m just annoyed.”
“Professor, we’re here for the Pensieve,” said Harry, turning away from the portrait of Al and feeling no longer afraid of telling McGonagall the truth. “Dumbledore left a set of memories behind to show us what Voldemort had done to amass his power.”
“You really want to have another go at me, Diggory? I don’t know if it’ll turn out for you as well as last time,” challenged Harry with a smile.
Draco headed for the door muttering something that sounded like “pointless,” but Harry grabbed his arm before he could leave.
At the moment, Professor Lockhart was swanning about in lilac robes, reading passages from his book,
with a set of funny glasses balanced on her nose. “They are only found in Indonesia but they might migrate.”
“What the fuck gives, Draco?” hissed Blaise, his eyebrows pressed together more in concern than anger. A rare moment of vulnerability for a Slytherin as practiced as he was. “I thought we were friends.”
Nymphadora bent double with laughter. “Ha! Nice try, but no. I’ll be getting you a Cleansweep replacement just like the last one was. What kind of salary do you think I’m on, anyway?”
“Like the founder,” clarified Luna, putting one hand through the centre of the diadem and flexing her fingers experimentally.
“There’s a lot that Muggles don’t bother to see.” Luna stood by Harry’s side for a few more quiet moments, before turning back towards the edge of the forest.
“Probably because that’s where Ollivander’s shop is,” said Hermione, casting a diagnostic spell on the ring. “Your leg’s looking better by the way.”
Hermione tensed visibly, and the room seemed to grow unnaturally quiet. Even Ivy had poked her head out of a stack of discarded Quibblers and was looking on with the others.
“Yes, I looked at the Fidelius chapter, and yes, I was trying to figure out whether the charm could be broken,” he started. “The only way to break a Fidelius is for the Secret Keeper to die. If someone were to attempt Legilimency, they may see a gap, but they would drive the holder of the secret to insanity and still not be any closer to the truth.”
which crinkled under the clear plastic. He paged through the first pages, landing on a vibrant illustration of a wooded scene, with a set of small house-elf type characters walking down the path together.
Blaise smiled easily. “Nah, mate. Have fun with that.”
“I saw others who did it. Marcus Flint, who was a few years older, was sent to kill a girl who had defected. She’d fallen in love with a Muggle and tried to disappear. Flint couldn’t do it in the end, so two other Death Eaters brought them both in front of the Dark Lord and forced him to watch her die. I laughed about it later when I heard how he’d cried, thinking I would never be as weak as him.”
“No need,” said Draco resolutely. “I assume that once I commit to this arrangement, you’ll be able to introduce me to the rest of the Collective?”
What was he expecting? That Draco would be waiting for him there, feeling the same way? If they hadn’t been thrust together by McGonagall, he would never have even given Harry a second thought, he’d said so himself. He was a penniless half-blood orphan, standing in the hallway of a home that belonged to the only son of a pure-blood dynasty. Harry suddenly felt his bravery curdle and die.
Umbridge snatched the wand out of the portrait and ran her pudgy fingers across it, brimming with glee.
“Welcome,” she said, ushering them through.
Draco’s hand reached out reflexively, but instead of placing it on Harry’s shoulder he diverted it to the edge of the chest, not knowing what to say. Not for the first time, he had the vague sense that he’d underestimated him. Instead of crying or flying into a rage or succumbing to the throes of grief, Harry was taking up the mantle of a task that seemed herculean, if not impossible.
“Seems like a pleasant place for somewhere named the Forbidden Forest,” said Harry as the two passed through low-hanging branches, stepping on a mossy carpet and suddenly surrounded by the musical sounds of the night.
But of course, he and the invisibility cloak were nowhere to be found.
“No,” said Draco, jerking away. Hermione stood now too, placing the plate of biscuits down and looking about as confused as Harry felt at this strange turn in a normally calm and collected Draco.
Harry stepped away just long enough to pick up the flaming sword from the ground, line it up with Hufflepuff’s cup, and pierce it through the centre, shattering the last piece of Voldemort’s soul.
Minerva dropped her Animagus form, feeling her bones settle into their natural, human shape. She became aware of the chill of the night air on her face as her fur disappeared around her square framed glasses. The small sounds of crickets in the grass and the last dry leaves rustling in the trees immediately dimmed.
There was no point stirring up emotions on the eve of battle. It would accomplish nothing except give Harry a sliver of hope for something that was probably never going to happen. No, the mission was too important for distractions now.
“You’re not afraid to lose to me?” she asked, with an edge of challenge in her voice.
But Draco could not. Snape had voiced a sentiment that had been quietly growing inside him for some time. There were people he cared about, people he didn’t want to see hurt, no matter the trade off. He had already put his mother in jeopardy with his foolish attempts at breaking the Fidelius, as the letter from her that burned in his pocket reminded him.
Draco took a few quick paces into the kitchen, seeing the offending kettle billowing steam from the spout. He glanced around for something to hold the blasted thing with and when he couldn’t find anything, settled for levitating it onto a nearby trivet. As he did so, he realised he was wearing a set of plain navy robes rolled up at the sleeves.
“Wrong,” said Voldemort, pointedly. “It says that Dumbledore was a manufacturer of his own destiny as well as yours, and that your trust is misplaced in him.”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Wormtail, as the snake flicked its tongue threateningly in his direction.
Draco glanced at the board in surprise. He clearly hadn’t seen it coming. “That’s annoying,” he said, folding his arms and re-assessing his position. “Very sneaky, Potter.”
“What is it?” asked Harry, sleepily. He was lying with his arms folded under his chin, tilting his head to get a better look at Draco next to him.
“It’s more than possible, there's a prophecy. It’s the reason the Dark Lord went after you in the first place. It said the one with the power to defeat him was born to rebel parents at the end of the seventh month of that year.” He watched as Harry’s eyes widened, remembering how deeply Snape wished he could have protected Lily. “He believed it meant you.”
“Looks like that sort of crowd caught up to him,” said Draco drily. His eyes traced over the face of the wizard, who had flushed cheeks and was walking with his arms around two Gemma-esque women in nightclub attire. He was smiling and shouting something to the entourage that surrounded him, but Draco could detect a certain hollowness in his eyes.
Hermione scoffed. “What a load of rubbish – any number of people could have been born around that time.”
“That’s good. I’ve been working on a charm to turn things inside out, you know for laundry and the like, but I had an accident with a turkey dinner and was given an official warning,” said Luna, airily.
“Um, Harry,” said Hermione in a low voice over his shoulder. “Maybe you ought to tell them what we’re planning so we can get a move on.”
No sooner was he out of the throng of people than Blaise was jumping up on stage and grabbing the mic, belting out over the din of the music and pointing out to Pansy in the crowd. Angelica was shrieking with joy as she bounced up and down, and Pansy covered her eyes in embarrassment and laughed.
Harry didn’t come back to Regulus’s room the following night either. He was cordial enough in front of the others, but Draco knew he was still thinking about the memory of Alice Longbottom.
“Diplomacy is boring,” said Draco. “I’d give him a year before he’s sick to death of it.”
Harry was reaching out, nearly touching the portrait on the powder blue clad shoulder, when a hand appeared on his arm.
“You’re absolutely right. The magical products are superior. You can heal a fully broken body overnight with skelegrow, where you can only hope to numb the pain with muggle pharmaceuticals. But that’s where the money is,” said DuPont with a shrug and a swig of coffee. “Population size alone is a factor.”
An old man with a wispy nest of silver hair stood conversing with McGonagall at the front of the room, next to a large trunk. He held up a wand to the light, talking animatedly about “a tune up every decade or so.”
“What do you care?”
“He’s like a little first-year,” said Hermione
“Get her out of my sight,” snapped Voldemort, and two men rushed forward to take her away.
“Move it, old man,” came a leering voice from altogether too close.
The memory he picked this time was one he’d played over in his head for years; the day Tottenham drew with Chelsea, ending a years-long plague of losses. He remembered the smell of the pub that he had sneaked into to watch, and the brawl his mates got into with a few Chelsea fans. And he could picture with crystal clarity the goal by Armstrong that tied the match 17 minutes till the end of the game. It wasn’t until Vernon caught him wearing the kit and threw him into the sitting room wall that the memory faltered and Malfoy had to pull him out once more.
“Ok, wow,” said Harry, still smiling good-naturedly. “I think a few million fans would disagree with you.”
“I’m sure you can appreciate the delicacy of the news on the matter,” he said, fixing the old proprietor with a serious look. “I am, however, here on a related errand.”
“That’s fine and all, but half the reason we’re here is for consistency. One lucky hit won’t be enough when you’re defending yourself in the real world,” said Cedric, crossing his arms at the other two.
For another, the Draco of this reality didn’t seem to believe in pure-blood ideology at all. In fact, the thoughts nipping at the back of his brain were those of rebellion. Of rights for all. Not only pure-bloods and Muggle-borns, but non magical folks as well. Everyone had a place in this world, and everyone deserved to be protected. That’s what Ted and Andromeda had taught him.
“What does she mean by the eighth doctor, my lord?” asked Carrow
“Perhaps they can feel it too?” Luna continued. “The strange presence that’s arrived at the castle.”
“Word to the wise, Granger, if you want someone to confide in you, maybe don’t make their lives a miserable timetable. A little bit of freedom goes a long way.”
“Oh, and I’ll bet you’ll say he called me Mudblood just to give us a reason to leave, right?” Hermione glared daggers at him. “You don’t even know what it means, do you? It’s a really foul word for someone who’s Muggle-born. Something to remind us how inferior Muggles are to pure-bloods.”
“That’s a terrible move,” said Draco.
“I also think Harry would be happier if we could get a few of his items from home. He’s refusing to wear anything but his Muggle clothes, for instance,” said Hermione delicately. “Maybe if we could get a couple things for him he’d feel more at ease and his magic would mellow out a bit.”
Draco waited, expecting a greasy sneer to appear at any moment. But there was no sound from within.
Harry was immediately recognised as he made his way through, returning nods of greeting and sharing a few quick words with the Seeker of the Falcons, who jumped up to clap him on the shoulder as he passed. He seemed to be acquainted with most of the patrons in the room, who greeted him not out of awe but with a certain cursory familiarity. Harry, for his part, seemed genuinely happy to see them and be seen. It seemed slightly out of character for Harry, who in Draco’s memory, had often tried to slip out of the limelight, despite
He ran his hands down her sides, landing on her waist, and was struck by how small she was. Compared to Potter’s sturdy frame, she felt light and frail, like a little bird. She tugged him into a sitting position on the edge of the bed where she straddled him, letting the open robe slip off her shoulders.
“I would love to help Harry,” said Luna, smiling. “My specialities are Divination and Herbology, but I’m taking Advanced Care of Magical Creatures this year as well. Professor Grubbly-Plank says I’m a natural.”
She certainly did not. He locked eyes with his mother as she gave him a meaningful stare – she was silently protecting him. Willing him not to ask questions that might expose either of them when the Dark Lord inevitably raided their thoughts.
“And right you are,” said George, motioning them to the back. “I keep telling everyone that with your flying you ought to be doing runs daily, but they keep telling us you’re better use on strategy.”
Draco’s own hands immediately found their way to the small of Harry’s back, then his hips, as he pulled him closer. Insistent lips pressed against his, soft but strong. The kiss with Theo so drastically paled with the real thing he almost laughed.
With an unsettling lurch, Draco was whisked away as Tonks side-alonged him without so much as a warning. They landed in a small clearing which appeared to have been at one time a park, only now it was overgrown and disused. The bare trees scraped together in the wind overhead and rusty swings creaked nearby.
“You can’t possibly be here to play golf, so what is it you’re really up to? Trying to expose me for a fraud, hm? Because I’ll have you know it will not work. I’ve already gotten Edgar’s blessing on the match. It’s practically a done deal,” he lied.
“By then, of course, the entire country had gone to pot and by the time the world was back in order, it was largely forgotten,” continued Greenacre, swivelling slightly on his creaking chair. “Flamel & Sons even ended up making up for their losses after the war, but who’s surprised that war is good for medical alchemy.”
which was now warming their faces.
before Carrow too was sending blasts of magic down the platform with his retrieved wand.
“Keep talking,” said Harry, a dark laugh emerging from within him as he reached into the bag, drawing out the gleaming sword of Gryffindor.
There was Sophie Goldstein, who had a crisis in the Gryffindor common room after scalding her skin in an attempt to remove her newly growing armpit hair (Harry had given his second years a very stern lecture, punctuated with a smattering of giggles).
Hermione was looking at him with such an intense earnestness that he hardly knew what to say. The fact that she was actually wrong in any other scenario would have made him feel vindicated, but had the strange effect of making him feel guilty.
“They didn’t,” said Cedric, as Hermione let out a little noise of disgust. “I had to sneak in, but they were none the wiser. Someone else was asking after you though, said her name was Lois.”
“That one was a Tickling Charm!” said Luna, clapping her hands together.
“Since we already tried the Un-Sticking Charm once, they might be ready for it,” said Hermione, over a bite of biscuit. “So instead I’ll head to the defence classroom and release Lockhart’s Cornish Pixie swarm. They’ll be easy enough to lead to the Hall to cause chaos and – oh!” Hermione stopped so suddenly the others jumped. “Kreacher, these are delicious!”
At that, Blaise burst into laughter. “Oi, who said anything about marriage? We’re just messing around. Hannah doesn’t want anyone knowing or she thinks it’ll mess up her good girl image. Which is fine by me – I’d rather spend time with her alone anyway, if you catch my meaning.”
“Still. It has a nice gravitas to it.”
McGonagall huffed in exasperation. “Prophecy or no, you’re still under my protection. What do you plan to do with all this grand knowledge, now that you have it?”
“It’s true.” Hermione looked forlornly at Harry. “Anyone who’s attempted to cross him has ended up dead.”
Bright green eyes locked on his, and Draco nearly laughed at himself for the picture of Potter he had conjured in the hall. The boy rose, almost Draco’s height, though built more fully across the chest and shoulders. Draco had enough of his wits about him to see a curious apprehension in his face.
“Not always,” said Hermione tartly, sorting through the books on the coffee table. “Great discovery can often benefit from open-mindedness.”
The halls were empty as returning students enjoyed their first dinner back, so he was fortunate to make the journey alone. Only the eyes of the portraits followed his swift movement. He felt them penetrating him, as though they could see his shame.
“What about this one, Beedle?” asked Luna, pointing to a painting of a fern grotto with a gentle waterfall.
But his muggle clothes were feeling particularly warm suddenly, and he could feel sweat on his brow. And why did it feel like the air was suddenly stagnant? The pressure of Mr Dupont’s expectant gaze, Angelica sizing him up, and Potter just physically being present culminated in Draco miscalculating into a sand trap. Unacceptable.
“Come in,” called the now familiar Scottish lilt of Professor McGonagall. Hermione flicked one more glance over Harry from top to bottom, pushed a few more hairs over his scar, and led the way into the room.
The Dark Lord held his hands out dramatically, to a few laughs from the audience of Death Eaters. He circled Harry, the closeness of his presence bringing a chill in the air.
“That’s dreadful!” said Hermione indignantly. “They weren’t concerned he’d disappeared?”
Only Luna Lovegood, who sat to Hermione’s left, was paying any attention. She gazed dreamily to the front of the classroom, as Professor Lockhart struck a heroic pose and read aloud, “For no mere mortal could survive a night with a horde of Inferi! But – as I later found out – no mere mortal had ever been brave enough to try.”
A few of the younger students looked nervous at this, but a witch with a short black bob towards the back of the room called out, “If it’s a matter of fighting to win, don’t worry about us.” Harry spotted her and recognised her as Pansy, the girl Draco had been dating at the start of the year. “Professor Lockhart started us on duelling in second year and we’ve been competing at it ever since. Anyone on my duelling squad could knock any wizard flat in a minute or less, Death Eater or no.”
Draco turned, Snape was right on top of him, grabbing him tightly by both arms and staring earnestly into his eyes. His expression was one of grief.
“Great,” said Harry, looking up to meet Draco’s eyes as he entered.
“Witness summons, Search and Seizure, Ah – Here is the court order notifying you of your de-seating from the Wizengamot, and here is your arrest warrant for undermining Ministry authority,” said Umbridge, smiling ever broader as she tossed the final pages on the desk and snapped her purse shut. “I think you’ll find the paperwork is all in order.”
“A psychologist?” said Luna, flipping to the index of her book. “I’ve never heard of that creature before.”
The elf was inconsolable. Cedric looked confusedly around at the others, letting the locket go so Kreacher could have it. He hugged it close to his heaving chest and ran to a dark corner of the room where he faced the wall and cried.
Minerva lingered a few moments longer, momentarily tempted to take Harry for her own, but she knew it was a futile wish. In a flurry of robes, she returned to her Animagus form, leaping up to her spot on the garden wall and twitching her cat ears in the direction of the sleeping child.
, and he was sucked down into his memories.
The Ravenclaw Seeker was in front of him now, arm outstretched, when a stray Bludger knocked the back half of her broom, sending her spinning. There was nothing between him and victory. He sped up, arm outstretched, and his hand closed around the struggling golden ball.
“So you’ll miss us then,” said Luna.
“In that case, I don’t expect you would mind sharing your thoughts,” said Voldemort, the space where his eyebrows would be raising into an attempt at an endearing expression. “For my peace of mind.”
asked Ivy, who was now coiled around Harry’s wrist, her nose poking out of his sleeve.
“Can’t sleep?” asked Harry.
“I think I have,” said Draco, honestly. “But this person… They may not be the type you would have picked for me,”
“Uh, guys,” said Cedric.
Hermione bristled and shoved the tile back into her robe pocket. “More like a symbol that she actually trusts me. What are you trying to read, anyway?” she asked, looking past him.
Draco willed her to keep asking questions in the hopes she might guess he was under a charm, but more likely he’d only be able to respond to questions if the charm knew she couldn’t piece together the answer.
He pressed her against the wall and ran a hand across her cheek and into her hair. Part of him was relieved that the Pansy he knew was still the same girl. That she didn’t flip a switch at the chance for power like a psychopath. If only he could scare her enough, maybe he could spare her the same fate.
Luna nodded obligingly, but Hermione spluttered.
With a sigh, Greenacre opened a side drawer of his desk and pulled out a long green box. Opening it on its hinge, it revealed a sharp black quill.
“But why? Surely they were no real threat to a wizard of his calibre. What power did they possess that could reduce him to such a diminished state?”
Harry considered this. His eyes darted to Charlotte’s blank face and a sting of regret sliced through him.
to avoid printing a scandal. Did the Ministry notify Harry?” asked Pansy, shooting a worried glance in Draco’s direction, which he returned with a pointed stare.
“I remember a happy childhood. One with doting parents who would do anything for me and for each other. It got harder once I was old enough to realise everything we stood to lose. There were certainly a few mistakes made, but nothing done without the interest of our family first,” he said, truthfully.
“Another bad piece of intel, if you ask me,” the other man was muttering under his breath.
He turned the corner into the living room, which had felt so spacious when it was just the four of them. Now, it was packed side to side with a dozen or so students in black Hogwarts robes with more emerging every few minutes through the flames.
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” said Cedric, gathering up the file. “There are many who still share a purist belief, and many more who are simply anti-Ministry or anti-Muggle enough to be swayed if the payoff were right.”
“Ouch, what’s the rush, Hermione?” asked Harry as she yanked him towards an alleyway. “We already got what we needed.”
“Incredible,” said Luna, putting her eyes level with the table. “These combinations hardly ever work. You must have tried out a lot.”
“Fine then, if you don’t want to learn Transfiguration we can go back to Charms,” said Hermione, bending over the parchment and scratching out the
As they withdrew from the memory, he caught a look of concern on Hermione’s face and worried briefly that she hadn’t been convinced. But in a moment she was up off the chair and had wrapped him in a hug, removing the
“Alright,” she said, with a resolved nod, grabbing his hand and placing the locket in it. “But we’re going to need backup.”
“What you’ve been through—” he ventured finally.
“Not really, Luna,” said Harry, dropping his hand.
“Will you come meet us as well? We may need all the help we can get in the end.”
“What about McGonagall? It sounded like she was in danger,” said Harry.
“Thanks,” said Harry, accepting the heavy books.
Draco kept his eyes on the board, lining up a few moves as he waited to see whether Harry would go on and tell him or whether he’d have to draw it out. “I’d wager a guess that he never told you he was a wizard.”
that Draco had brought round for him. If there was one thing he was more excited about than anything in the magical world, it was Quidditch. But he wasn’t here for frivolities, he reminded himself sternly. And his followup Legilimency session earlier that afternoon had not gone well.
Voldemort looked at his hands too.
“Yes, it is,” said Draco. It only just occurred to him that Potter might take offence to a memory of quality time spent with a mother.
“Not at all, Professor,” said Draco, drawing close and putting on one of his best model-student expressions with a hint of sympathy for good measure. “And might I say how sorry I am to hear about the loss of Headmaster Dumbledore? I know you two were very close.”
Hardly registering what the others were saying, Harry swallowed against a lump in his throat. He wondered if he ought to try and wake the portrait of Al, but something told him it would only hurt to see his friend alive. Who knew if a portrait would even recognise him.
“I don’t mind. I can come whenever I’m free,” said Luna, wandering over to the desk to peer at Ivy.
He allowed the old man to work on the ring for a few minutes longer, until the spells started making hissing noises, like water being tossed on a hot pan. Finally, at a loud crack, Borgin stepped back, pushing the glasses to the top of his head.
“Come on, Cedric, leave him be. He’s had enough of a hard time,” chastised Hermione.
“Me too,” said Draco, honestly.
“Nothing to get upset about, they’re only Muggles,” joked Draco.
In all honesty, Harry hadn’t thought that far ahead, assuming that if they’d made it this far, they could easily go anywhere their cash would stretch. The thought of suggesting Scotland occurred to him, feeling a pang of regret that he had so much unfinished business there, but thinking for their safety, it was probably a good idea to get as far away as possible.
Snippets of memory started whipping by; a park, a wrought-iron table, the shape of a man in a brown tweed suit. Draco attempted to press in on one or two of them, to get a better look at the man’s face, but Harry resisted with surprising force, so Draco kept his pace up, diving back in time. The park flashed through winter, summer, streaking by before Harry could get a foothold and push him away.
“I know. But I’m going to have to wing it,” said Harry, looking around at the mess of the room.
“I just mean, Harry’s so interesting, I would have thought he’d go for someone a bit more outspoken,” she said. “Is she his usual type?”
A man on a train holds that same edition of the
“I don’t know what you mean. I was really excited to win that calculator,” joked Harry.
There was a light knock on the door, and it cracked open ajar. A mop of messy black hair peaked in over the side.
He lay there for a few moments as the doors closed behind him, trying to get a sense of what was broken in him. What he now realised without a shadow of a doubt was that the Dark Lord intended to kill him. Whether he got information about Harry or not, Draco would not survive.
“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’m just glad someone’s proven Granger wrong for a change.”
“Wait a minute, look at this. It’s—” he said, but Hermione had already snatched the paper out of his hands and pushed him farther down the dark side street. “What the hell?” Harry demanded, pulling his arm away. “What’s the problem?”
Draco sighed, but a look of reticence creased his brow.
Harry sat in silence as Draco waited anxiously for any sign of reaction. It wasn’t what Draco wanted to say, but he knew it was what he had to say first. He could never live with himself if he kept this part of his past hidden.
“And they eat meat?”
“How interesting,” said Draco, as the waitress returned with their coffees. “And what about the history of the DuPont family?”
Draco pushed a hand through his hair and sat the full glass down on the table. Pansy was right. He needed to come to his senses.
“Girlfriend?”
“Will you just watch the film!” said Harry, kicking Draco as Hermione burst into laughter.
She rifled through her bag, pulling out a folded copy of the
“You Apparated within the castle?” asked Hermione in disbelief. “Incredible. Well, I’m sure with practise you’ll be able to control it, but it sounds like it’s attached to an emotional response.”
But much to everyone’s surprise when Cedric turned up that day and they’d reconfigured the room to the practice hall, the holly wand let out a beautiful stream of sparks that cascaded down the length of the room, bang on target.
“But Harry, it might really be an impossible task,” said Hermione. “I mean I don’t know about the rest of you, but I still want to finish my education and get a good job before I go risking my life.”
“But it’s true, isn’t it. You think I’m one of them, just like in the vision. You clearly haven't told the others what I showed you or Granger would have sent me packing. So if there’s anything to hide, you agree with me that it should be hidden.”
“Annoyingly, she got me thinking about how close my aunt was to Voldemort, and when we were talking about the cup I remembered seeing something similar in the family vaults. I went over the break and there it was.”
His name? Hermione hadn’t equipped him with a false identity, only a longer nose. He glanced over to her, where she was biting her lip, realising her mistake as well. It sure would be a good time to know Legilimency, he thought reluctantly.
“And as such, we’ve been sanctioned on a confidential mission of sorts,” she continued, picking up speed. “We remembered you’d said you never forget the name of someone you sold a wand to. And we’re aware of a wand that has performed some particularly dark magic, but the owner has changed his name. If you remembered the wand, we thought you could remember the wizard.”
“It is true, Minerva,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “I have long known that this is a quest Harry would be destined for.”
“Hermione is doing both,” said Harry with a shrug.
By the time they were back in the corridor, Hermione didn’t waste any time grabbing Harry by the elbow and leading him to an alcove where she cast a Disillusionment Charm and marched him back to the Room of Requirement, grumbling about inferior wand cores and the setback this would cause to their lesson plan.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow in bemusement. “In wizard sports, the teams are there to win,” he said with teacherly patience.
Harry felt like the wind was knocked completely out of him as he beheld the torture of the woman who had brought him to Hogwarts. It was excruciating to watch and inconceivable to think that the four Aurors standing by – though they shifted uncomfortably – did nothing.
“What are you trying to say?” asked Draco, his hand tightening on his wand, in case the portrait knew more than he was letting on.
“Just here,” said Harry, closing the door behind her and gesturing to the terrarium on the desk.
“Aren’t you going to say anything?” asked Harry after a while.
To his annoyance, Potter had a similarly strong first shot, although it went high and veered slightly towards the left in the direction of the wind. So much for being a novice. As Draco walked up to the box for his turn, he was concentrating as hard as possible on making a better shot than Potter. He set his ball up on the self-teeing grass, squared off his shoulders, and knocked the ball hard. It went high and left, landing close to Potter’s ball.
The room crackled with antagonistic magic as Draco and Hermione stared each other down. Then Hermione took a step back, crossing her arms as a look of smug satisfaction crossed her face.
“Doesn’t sound any worse than the odds we’ve had till now,” he said, his eyes flicking up to meet Draco’s.
“I’m saying this changes things,” said Harry. “It’s not just about the people we care about anymore. It’s up to us to save the world.”
“All I’m saying is, we’re a lot farther along than I initially thought,” said Hermione, pointing to items on the list. “Seven pieces, right? The first is the ring, second is the diadem, third is the locket. And Dumbledore’s letter said he believed at least one Horcrux to be living — Voldemort himself has to be one, and I reckon Quirrell has to be another. So that’s five there.”
“Do you think it’s something your mother will be able to understand?” Pansy asked, eyes darting back to the scribbled mess of a letter.
As Hermione sped off down the main stairs, Harry and Draco took off in the opposite direction, taking an indirect path to the second floor to avoid any main thoroughfares.
The stack of old issues of the
The brunette caught up with Harry and twined her arm around his waist, looking bored. Harry guided her over to their group, breaking off to accept Blaise’s slap on the back and to kiss Angelica and Pansy on the cheek in greeting. He nodded in Draco’s direction with a warm smile, while Draco kept his expression carefully blank. He didn’t want to set any expectations that they were friends after all, and something about the fluttery feeling he got at Harry’s arrival annoyed him worse than anything.
“Yeah, like what’s been going on in the Muggle world for the last four decades,” said Harry, narrowing his eyes. He was certain that Draco had to know something about world affairs beyond the small bubble of wizarding Britain, but he looked just as confused as Harry felt. “Jesus, don’t they teach you anything about the Muggle world? Surely wizards are impacted just the same if there is large-scale political upheaval.”
“It’s a funny thing,” Voldemort continued, taping a long finger on the edge of his glass. “I don’t remember Narcissa faring poorly in the winter. And I resided here for many years at that.”
Hermione tried to smile back, but he could see tears brimming in her eyes. “Good luck, Harry,” she said, flinging her arms around his neck.
By the time he turned around, Luna was holding up his notes on experimental charms, with Ivy poking her head out of the pocket of her overalls. “Are you testing charm combinations?” she asked.
“Harry’s a Parselmouth,” said Hermione, astounded to have a piece of information revealed that she wasn’t already privy to. “But what can that mean? Only dark wizards have ever held that skill.”
Tonks bit her lip, looking like she was straining not to cry.
It quickly became clear that Draco had not imagined the vertical stretching of the room, as they were now at the very top of the muggle building they’d entered, looking out on the evening skyline from a penthouse view. On all sides, the space was framed with large, sweeping windows framed with floor to ceiling curtains dripping with tassels. Beyond which the lights of London glimmering from every angle. Past the bottle service area and an expanse of open floor was a low stage, where a group of melancholy looking women sang a chant-like song.
The room rang with a loud silence as Draco blinked back unbelievingly at this revelation.
“No, it’s fine. I think we’re done for the day,” said Hermione, shoving her timetable into her bag and holding out her hand to Harry. “Wand.”
“Thanks, but I think I’ve got what I need,” said Harry, marching to the end of the bed and zipping up his backpack roughly. “If anything comes up, I’ll be sure to flag down the nearest owl.”
The dark room rang with a loud silence. Draco’s arm burned, searing his conscience.
Harry had been smaller then, like a malnourished puppy. Now he was filled out across the chest. Strong arms raised the club and brought it down in a neat arc, making a loud crack of contact with the ball. As it landed and rolled a short way towards the flag, Angelica called out, “Woo! Go, Harry!” and bounced up and down, her skirt flouncing around her in the breeze. If Angelica really saw something in Harry, he might actually be in trouble.
“Charlotte?” Harry tried turning to look at her and got a sharper jab in the back.
“You’re dead lucky I pay attention to you in class,” snapped Draco, tossing the leaves into a glass on the desk and filling it with an Aguamenti. “Drink this.”
Draco knocked his ball back on the green, but not before stupefying every gnome in sight.
“Oh, and I suppose we’re just supposed to ignore all the times you had more information about Voldemort than the rest of us?” said Hermione, throwing her hands up. “The Borgin connection? Occlumency skills? What else are you keeping from us?”
“That’s true,” said Harry, rubbing at his neck with a sheepish smile. “Should we dive into a Legilimency session then? I thought of a great memory that I can show you.”
“You know what I mean. If you’re only getting your history lessons from Binns, it’s no wonder you’re falling behind,” she said, blushing furiously and returning her nose to the book. Nope. Original judgements confirmed.
“Isn’t it?” he said, leaning in to press his forehead to hers. “Me at the right hand of the Dark Lord. You, there by my side. Maybe I’ll even keep you around, if you promise to burn this place to the ground with me.”
,” said Cedric, correcting Harry’s stance.
The feather on the table fluttered promisingly, and then made a sizzling sound as it curled up from point to tip like the moisture had been sucked out of it.
” and
“Are you telling Draco the Augusta story?” said a deep, jovial voice from behind them. “One of those suckers nearly took my foot off!”
“The only thing more delusional than this petty show of power is thinking you could have been any sort of threat to Albus Dumbledore,” spat McGonagall.
Draco was floored. How could he have thought mere hours ago that this man was of the same ilk as Arthur Wesley? “So the Pharma business isn’t about helping muggles, it’s about—”
The one holding Charlotte’s spell was hit by a stunner from Pansy’s duelling squad and fell back, and Charlotte shook her head as if coming out of a dream. In a moment, Blaise was by her side, pulling her to her feet and shielding her as Hermione set down a heavy offensive line of Blasting Curses in their wake.
Harry took the envelope with a shaking hand, turning it over to reveal a broken wax seal bearing the Hogwarts crest.
“Very well, I’ll send Cedric,” said McGonagall, trying to bring the conversation to a close. “Anything else, Miss Granger?”
Draco took a few staggering paces after her, standing shoulder to shoulder to look down one long street beyond which lay a scene of destruction. White stone buildings gave way to rubble halfway down the block, like teeth in a broken jaw, and the taller city buildings in the distance were dark and empty. The city was quiet.
He smiled after her and attempted to exude a demeanour of nonchalance as he watched her line up her next shot, but internally his mind was whirring away, calculating how all the pieces of his plan would fit together with this new request. He’d been hoping he could ward off any intimacy until they were a few months down the track. Angelica had seemed so conservative at first glance and had been perfectly demure at the Manor.
The heavy double doors of the Manor library swung open, and two figures walked in. Harry jolted at the memory, his magic growing quickly restless.
“Whatever you say,” said Pansy with a sigh. “It just makes me nervous to see you like this. The last time you were this on edge was about fifth year. You were keeping secrets then too—”
“I can’t do nothing!” he snapped. “For weeks, they’ve locked me up here, teaching me a few magic tricks, on the pretence of keeping me safe. Yet they never bothered to tell me—”
“Well, I know that much to be sure, Albus,” said McGonagall with an exasperated sigh. She turned back to the desk, locking the drawers with strong sealing spells. “Well, seeing as it sounds like you’ve very much made up your minds, you boys had better leave while you can. The Fidelius has served its purpose. Come here, Potter.”
While Hermione was under, Cedric turned up after a morning of casework and the others caught him up on the diadem over lunch at the coffee table. Harry even told him what he had witnessed after the Triwizard Tournament, and though it chilled him, it seemed to make him even more confident in the fact that – in this timeline at any rate – they were on the right path.
“Watch it, Malfoy!” jeered Zacharias Smith, before Theo made contact with the same Bludger, sending it hurtling at the Hufflepuff captain and knocking him sideways on his broom. Theo nodded in Draco’s direction before zooming off down the pitch.
“Well, yeah, I’m just trying to learn as much as I can. And now I don’t have to learn a melting charm if that comes up.”
“Hey guys, what did the real locket look like?” asked Cedric, still inspecting the old one.
cried Lily, her grip tightening on the rail of the cot behind her.
“What do you mean exactly?” Hermione asked, catching Luna’s gaze.
“Yes, well as it happens, the phoenix that provided the feather for your wand, gave one other. Your wand is already quite rare as a phoenix core almost never mixes with holly. The combination produces one of the strongest wands imaginable, though it may take some time to build up to its full strength,” said Ollivander as he busied himself gathering his things from McGonagall’s desk. “It’s brother, phoenix feather and yew, is also very rare. Both powerful combinations, with great potential. Though by Merlin’s grace, I wish we had not seen it.”
“He’s not going anywhere,” said Luna, nudging Draco on the arm.
he said, his half-moon spectacles bobbing on the end of his nose as he spoke and reflecting the light scattering of stars overhead.
“Well done, Potter,” said Cedric, nodding appreciatively. “Could do with a bit more vibrancy, but that’s not a half terrible job.”
Draco accepted the locket and turned it over in his hand, remembering the one they had seen in the Pensieve. It had been a heavy gold thing, oval in shape with an ornate jewelled S. This locket was octagonal with a bevelled gold front. Another dead end.
“Honestly, what has Hermione been teaching you?” she asked, rising to her feet and Transfiguring her Muggle clothes back into robes. “Alright, I better show you. Have you got any robes?”
“Come on, Granger,” said Draco, completely off his guard. “There’s no need.”
“Well, if you were thinking about resolving past disputes, now is as good a time as any,” she said with an encouraging little smile.
Draco could feel the warm weight of his arms, the flutter of breath against his cheek, the pulse of the music through the floor of the balcony. He felt a pang of desire that he had never realised existed inside of him, and was suddenly ravenous. He drew a hand against Harry’s jaw and threaded his fingers through the wild, dark hair.
“What are you on about?” asked Draco, not bothering to hide his tone of annoyance. The last thing he needed was a nosy painting telling McGonagall he’d been wandering around suspiciously outside of her classroom.
“And it was after a near death experience that put him in hospital. Somehow this is all connected,” said Draco, trying to remember what Potter had said about his departure from the force. Something about an ongoing investigation.
“It’s happened, Professor. Potter has accessed the mental link,” said Draco, taking a few long strides across the room. “He knows about Quirrell, it’s only a matter of time before they put the pieces together about me. We have to act. I need to break this Fidelius once and for all.”
Hermione stammered in response, her expression of resolve wavering.
Without another word, Harry closed the space between them. Before he knew it, his hands were on Draco’s neck, drawing him into a kiss.
“Not to my knowledge,” said Draco, calling Blaise’s bluff. “When the time comes, we will all be made aware.”
“Shove off,” Harry said. Not his best comeback, but it was three o’clock in the bloody morning.
“Well, I never!” The portrait’s shrill cry shattered the silence.
The wheels in Draco’s mind were spinning at full tilt, trying to figure out a way to twist what he’d just said when the door burst open and Hermione raced into the room.
“Business dealings… with my father?” said Draco, still trying to wrap his mind around what was being said. In all the accounts he’d heard of his father’s ties to the American wizarding community, he was positive neither golf nor a business venture with Edgar DuPont had ever been mentioned.
“Come on, Potter. Not cut out for the wizarding world after all? Would you prefer to settle things the Muggle way like your cousin does?” called Draco, a purple jet of light streaming past him, which he blocked.
He sighed, forgetting his daily ritual of complete silence as there was a rustling from the living room through the crack of the door.
“Thank Merlin,” said Draco, coming to kneel next to her and shine his wand tip near her eye, checking her for any lasting spell damage.
“Honestly,” snickered Pansy under her breath. “How the Longbottoms are pure-bloods is beyond me, they’re a disgrace to the name.”
Harry couldn’t help but to look back at McGonagall’s limp form as Umbridge circled her slowly, a superior glint in her eye. It tore him up to abandon the professor, but he swore to himself that he would even the score with Umbridge someday, on McGonagall’s behalf.
Draco smiled smugly at Harry’s performance.
Harry stumbled back from the memory as the battery fell to the floor with a thunk. He was on his feet, pacing towards the door, his hands laced through his hair.
“Great. Now that that’s settled,” said Cedric, walking a little ways down the room and taking a stance facing the others. “Another skill that will help you in an emergency is concealment. If an attacker cannot locate you, you might be able to buy yourself some time to escape or get into a more desirable position.
Questions started flying in from the crowd – everything from “where have you been all these years?” to “is it true you’re secretly Voldemort’s son?” Harry tried answering a few of the more reasonable ones, but the questions started coming harder and faster, and Harry could feel the time they had to act slipping away.
“Good grief, it just says ‘some Slytherins,’” said Hermione, handing him the parchment.
On Draco’s suggestion, he’d convinced Luna to come around during the Halloween Feast under the pretence of sharing the meal together. But instead, he’d get her to let him out of the wards and ideally down to the forest where he could find his way back to the Thestral grounds. He felt bad about taking advantage of Luna’s kindness, but he and Draco had agreed that her gullibility would protect her from any punishment for the action.
Draco raised his eyebrows warningly at the other two and they fell back, Luna linking arms with Hermione and babbling about all the milkshake flavours at Honeydukes.
Draco relaxed in his chair. It had been easier than he would have guessed to keep Potter in the dark. His sort were always too trusting for their own good, Draco thought with an internal smirk of satisfaction, followed by another annoying twinge of guilt.
“Pesky bird,” said Umbridge, storing the wand safely in her purse and clasping it shut. “Dawlish, gather the others. Tell them we’re moving into phase two. All the professors are to be confined to their quarters while they await questioning. Take the students back to the dorms. We’ll lock down the school once the Dementors arrive.”
“If I can’t get in touch with them, maybe I ought to just go home quickly,” said Harry, with the overtures of a suggestion, but an undertone of someone who felt trapped. “I’ll come right back.”
“Then where do I sign?”
“It’s just an act. If I stop it now people will be even more suspicious.”
Draco stared. Amid the chaos of the ruined city, memories started coming back to him. Years living with Tonks, being teased by her, watching her go into the Auror academy, hearing horror stories about the world crumbling outside and begging to come along and fight.
“But Harry, that’s crazy. You’re just a kid,” said Luna.
With a doubtful glance, her mouth drawn tight, she turned and sped down the corridor and out of sight. When she was gone Draco let out a shaky breath and turned instead towards the Transfigurations corridor.
Hermione stopped writing. It was unusual for other girls to speak with her, as she’d made a reputation for herself the last couple years as the type that liked to be left quite alone, thank-you-very-much.
“I don’t want that
“Adorable, really,” said Malfoy, quirking an eyebrow.
“Convenient for a skilled Occlumens to say,” muttered Hermione.
“Fine by me,” he said, wondering what a proper wand would feel like if the ones he’d been using so far weren’t a match. “Thank you, Mr Ollivander.”
“Where did you get this?” asked Luna, levitating the chess set out of the bag and setting it on the coffee table.
The wandmaker looked at Hermione with eyebrows raised in approval, but after a pause he handed the wand back to Harry, saying, “I would not risk it. The danger is too great.”
“More to the point, let’s pick up where we left off on memory recall,” said Draco, brushing the unwelcome sympathies away and lacing his fingers together, just as his mentor had sat when he first began tutoring Draco. “Our last session was a good baseline for shared thought experiences – now you know what the presence of a Legilimens feels like. But I think we can go deeper.”
“You’ve just seemed so distracted lately it’s hard to tell where your head is sometimes,” said Pansy, leaning her chin in her hand. “I mean you hardly spoke on our date to Madam Puddifoot’s, and you didn’t even laugh when I cast that sticking spell on those two fifth-years that were snogging.”
“I’m in this completely,” said Draco seriously, setting his papers firmly onto the pile on the marble table.
“All the better to be prepared,” said Hermione, as Cedric entered in a casual set of robes, with a Muggle backpack slung over his shoulder.
Hermione was busy running healing charms over Draco’s arm as quickly as she could to stop the bleeding, though a few drops were trickling off his sleeve onto the floor.
“He had everything at his disposal to be both, but either way he lost.”
“I started wondering when you showed me your memories of the Manor. There was something in the dark corridor you didn’t want me to see,” said Harry. “But it wasn’t until we were walking back from Hogsmeade that I knew. You’re meant to take the Mark.”
“Sometimes I wish I could get back to my old life.” Luna stared dreamily off. “Back when my mother was around. My father was different then too. I’m not sure why but I think people took us more seriously as a set.”
“That really won’t be—”
“It’s kind of like the Muggle equivalent of magic,” said Harry, realising he had not thought about programming or Salerni or Edinburgh in months, and feeling a pang of guilt for how easily the ambitions of his Muggle life had been written over. “You use a special vernacular to give commands, and if you do it well enough, you can build a machine that does anything.”
“Maybe we really should get McGonagall involved,” ventured Hermione. “We have no way of knowing what this thing is.”
Harry tensed, but Draco put a hand on his shoulder, trying to steer him back towards the Pensieve. “Forget it, Harry. It’s just a portrait. It’s not really him.”
“We were just finishing
Damn, Borgin was testing him. If only he had his Mark, he’d be able to put the weasel into his place. As it stood, he’d have to cover himself fast to make sure word didn’t get back to his father. But if he didn’t get any useful information about the soul magic in the ring, the trip would all be for nothing.
Draco couldn’t even muster up the energy to be annoyed by the git. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Now’s not the fucking time, Potter.”
“That’s absurd,” said Draco with a huff of laughter. He knew there had been a well of feeling rising that he’d suppressed, but surely he was more in control of himself than for that sort of thing to be noticed. And after all, only an idiot would fall for the chosen one. “I’m sure I don’t know what you mean”
“Now we know the worst-case scenario,” said Cedric. “If we don’t stop this thing, it could mean the end of everything as we know it.”
“Potter? What are you doing here?” he snapped, an accusatory expression marring his sour features.
“Shut it, Theo,” Draco warned. “We don’t want our agenda being known by the entire school.”
“Oh, well, yes I see,” said Draco quickly, unsure of what to say. The only squibs he had ever known had been, well, incompetent, hadn’t they? Greenacre continued to smile, unperturbed, as though he knew the exact thoughts racing around Draco’s head.
She reached into the drawer of the end table and pulled out a now all too familiar hinged box. She lifted out the deck of tarot cards and shuffled.
Harry said nothing. It couldn’t be. Malfoy, his closest friend in this whole strange world, couldn’t be betraying him under his nose, could he?
An impossible task, to be sure, thought Draco. They were kidding themselves if they thought they could teach Harry anything more than basic charms in such a short time. McGonagall was too smart for that. She must have something else planned.
“What were you going to say earlier?” asked Harry from under the cloak, as he walked quickly to keep pace with Draco’s long strides.
shouted in anger but dripping with regret.
“Why don’t you come and have a seat?” asked Pansy.
His father blinked at him, clearly expecting some sort of response, so Draco quickly collected his features. “Oh? I’d imagine that made our Lord very happy indeed.”
“Gets loud in there, doesn’t it?” said a familiar voice. Draco looked up and saw Harry on the far end of the balcony, hands in the pockets of his suit, wind rustling his hair.
“They’ll be the first blood traitors to go,” sneered Draco.
“Funny, Malfoy,” said Cedric, going to retrieve his wand.
“My father is incarcerated on a term of life imprisonment in Azkaban with no connection to the outside world,” said Draco, placing the papers back on the desk with a snap as he could feel his temper rising. He was done beating around the bush. “So yes, I would say he will be ‘indisposed’ for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, I am the de facto custodian of my family’s investments. And frankly, I’m surprised that we have not been contacted directly about these matters.”
“You shouldn’t have done that,” said Harry, darkly.
“All students are meant to be gathering in the Great Hall,” said the moustached man, taking a few steps to make sure the rest of the stairwell was empty. “There’s an active Ministry investigation going on in these halls.”
“Garrick Ollivander, maker of fine wands,” said the old man, extending a hand to shake. “Dursley, you say? You wouldn’t by chance be related to Dorevitch Dursley, the renowned Alchemist?”
“I know.”
“How though? It’s not like we haven’t thought about it, it’s just not as simple as putting out an ad in the paper,” said Hermione. “Anything we could do to call attention to the Order might get us noticed by the Ministry.”
“Well, we always knew you were good at starting fires,” said Hermione, swatting at the singed pages of notes.
Draco froze, keeping his gaze carefully on his friend, certain there was no way Blaise could possibly know about his well-laid plans.
He went through the motions of his final few strokes, but there was a strange ringing in his ears that seemed to dull the surrounding sounds. He putted abysmally, which meant Angelica and Harry were in the lead after the round. Draco plastered on a smile as Angelica came bouncing towards him, babbling about something or other and he could hear the deep tones of Mr DuPont’s voice scolding her playfully.
“I think so. I told myself I would,” said Draco, his arm burned with the honesty but he found that his wall had fallen away. Here in Regulus’s bedroom, he could tell Harry anything.
Looking down, Draco saw the faint outline of the Dark Mark beginning to form on his arm, before Voldemort stripped away another layer of skin. “Not good enough,” he hissed. ”Again.”
“Casualty of war,” joked Harry.
“I’m not going to tell you what to believe. But I think we can all agree that a second wizarding war is not an option, and we have the power to stop it,” said Harry. “This ends tonight.”
“I want to tell you, but I—” Nope. That wasn’t it. He couldn’t come right out and say it.
“It’s not my father I’m worried about,” said Draco.
“Oh, yeah?” said Harry, who was looking cross. “Fine, you’re on Malfoy. You must have forgotten all the times I trampled you in Quidditch. Maybe this will shut you up for once.”
“Well, now, that’s a good question. I like where your head’s at. And the truth is, it definitely toed the line. Ultimately, the business now is in complete compliance with the statute. We keep our magical and non-magical branches totally separate.”
“We don’t speak his—”
“It would be my pleasure,” Draco said, brushing past Harry to take his place down the practice hall. “Hate for you to end on a low note, Potter, but sometimes that’s the only way you learn.”
“Come on Granger, I’m sure you’re capable of an original thought,” said Malfoy, turning back to Pansy and attempting to lead her away. “I think we’ve got enough time to make it to the common room and back before last period.”
“Diagon Alley, why does that sound familiar?”
He owed her the truth at least, thought Harry. If she was willing to leave her life behind for him, she had to know what they were running from.
“But you are,” said Voldemort, rising. His long black robes draped to the floor around him, making him look part man, part shadow. “You are here because of a prophecy, are you not?”
“Alright,” said Draco, reaching around for his wand.
Harry froze, breathing as quietly as possible. He considered re-casting the charm, but clearly the presence in the room would smother it. He readied himself to attack, despite knowing he’d feel quite foolish if it turned out to be nothing more than one of Yousef’s invisible turtles. After a slow exhale, he settled in to wait. Whoever was here was clearly trying to make contact.
“But—” protested Hermione.
“Stay away, Harry! He’ll die without you.”
“No, my lord. Never,” said the hulking Death Eater, who had already drained his glass and was pouring another.
Harry bent over his parchment, writing out all the charms combinations he’d tried and their general result, to see if he could discern a pattern. He’d had to send a fair few melted spoons back through the magical shelf with the rest of his dishes, but besides that he had avoided any particularly messy experiments.
Draco scoffed and turned to take a few paces away. “Here’s what I think, Professor. Potter shows up in the middle of the night with unprecedented powerful magic, an ability that’s passed down through Salazar Slytherin’s bloodline, and a reason to learn to separate his mind from the Dark Lord’s. Dumbledore wasn’t hiding him for his own good, he was hiding a weapon. Someone hand selected by the Dark Lord.”
Snape’s eyes jumped to Draco’s face with a look of confusion. “You mean… the boy?”
“It’s true,” said Harry. “The Hermione in my vision mentioned a prophecy also. I just didn’t realise it would be so personal.”
“What if they never tell him where he’s come from? What if they keep the letter a secret or refuse to send him to Hogwarts when the time comes?”
Draco steered her back down to the cushions by one slim shoulder. “It’s good to see you, mother. But you don’t look well.”
The Thestrals were patient and accommodating of their new riders. Draco was surprised how comfortable he was mounting the closest one and leading the pack out into the chilly night air.
“I would have picked a different set, but you could do worse.”
“Yes, back to the hard skills,” said Draco as the other two rose. “Very important to concentrate on – Sweet Merlin, what are you wearing?”
Harry frowned reflexively, and he looked away. “Doesn’t seem very sporting to torture a helpless woman. That is what you were doing, isn’t it?”
He could feel a light tugging on his consciousness, and blinking, he was back in his room at the castle.
“But what is it?” asked Hermione, already flipping to the index of a book called
“Can you resist the visions?”
Only Luna returned daily, wilfully oblivious to the change in the patterns of the others. Her latest hobby was paging through collections of obscure ancient artefacts which Voldemort might have targeted for use as a Horcrux.
The fire roared up again and a boy with an athletic build and a green emblem on his robe walked out, joining Pansy at the back. Seeing the boy who had kissed Draco somehow strengthened his resolve.
“Like he’ll ever come around to it,” Draco scoffed. If the day ever came where Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy put old arguments to rest, he’d donate a thousand galleons to the Save the Hippogriff Foundation.
“He has many questions,” said Lucius, refusing to look Draco in the eye. “I would strongly suggest honesty. For your mother’s sake.”
Draco looked up, not missing the obvious nod to Wisteria Hall. Though how the hell Blaise knew anything was beyond him.
“He was none the wiser. The secrets of the human heart are something he can never truly understand. It was easy to play a loyal follower when I had nothing else to live for,” said Snape, in a quiet monotone. “I only wish I could have saved her.”
“Just doing rounds,” said Draco without missing a beat. “Most everyone else is asleep.”
“It’s ghouls again,” she said in a low tone without looking up from a copy of
“Evidently,” said Snape. “You mean there’s someone else here from beyond the grave?”
“We can’t get sidetracked,” said Draco, laying a hand on Harry’s elbow.
“Sure,” said Draco, pushing back from the desk. “And by the way, you missed an error in the first paragraph. Lattice fly instead of Lacewing fly. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were losing your edge.”
Draco frowned to himself. That was the one piece he wished more than anything he could confide in Pansy — that he was sure he’d be seeing Harry again. But as he played the conversation over in his head in the days that followed that fateful night, he became more steadfast in his commitment to keep Potter’s position a secret. After all, it wasn’t just Potter that would be hurt if he was found out.
She hummed a little noise of triumph, planting another tacky kiss on his lips and sitting up to her full height. She stared down at him with heavy-lidded eyes, biting her lip. He rested his hands on her hips, bracing himself and trying to recall the feeling of holding Potter in the alley. It wasn’t the same.
Harry jumped to his feet and padded over to the door, opening it to find a blonde, but not the one he was expecting.
said Harry. Looking down at his hands and sending a surge of magic to them, where it crackled at the end of his fingertips. Not all change was good, though. He wondered whether Al would be proud of the person he’d become.
“Merlin’s fucking beard, Snape, what more do you want? I need your help!” He landed his fist on the door with a resounding bang, and at last heard scurrying footsteps from within.
“Stop that at once,” said Draco. “You’ll get wrinkles.”
McGonagall smiled in spite of herself as she knocked on the door. “Now don’t forget, he needs a teacher, but he’s going to need a few friends as well.”
Draco felt a rock drop in his stomach. This unassuming item had been the cause of Dumbledore’s demise. Though how he’d managed to survive the curse as long as he had, Draco could hardly guess.
“Lately it feels like nothing does.” Draco refilled Snape’s glass and pushed it back in his direction. “Potter knows about the Dark Lord. He and his little cronies are planning to – I don’t even know what. Hunt him down? It’s ridiculous.”
“My dear professor,” Dumbledore said in a calming tone, putting her in her place with the title. “I assure you, this place will be protected by blood magic from Lily’s sister. There is little that can harm him here. What are you afraid of?”
Right. Riding a bike.
Instead of feeling sorry for himself, he tried to imagine what the diadem version of himself would be doing with the information at their disposal. He had all the knowledge of the Death Eaters fortifications on the Manor and the Hall, if anyone could devise a plan to break in it was him.
“Thanks,” said Harry, actually feeling grateful for the git for the first time. Malfoy’s self-confident smile wavered, then fell into his standard, neutral expression.
“Well, Potter, unlike you, I don’t have the luxury of being retired at the age of 25.”
“Defeat the Dark Lord?” said Malfoy, stunned. “You’d have to be mad.”
Draco brought them back to the night they met. McGonagall had just told him he was going to be teaching Potter Occlumency and taken him up to the Room of Requirement. Harry watched apprehensively but openly, knowing the meeting would end badly, but not knowing what was about to follow.
“Destroying things is Dudley’s favourite hobby,” said Harry, scornfully.
anywhere near our son!” screamed Narcissa, throwing the crystal tumbler into the back of the fireplace where it shattered, causing the flames to sputter wildly.
“Well, I—”
“Listen to this,” said Harry, breaking into laughter. “‘The names of non-magical professions may be misleading. For instance, an accountant is a professional at counting, but a plumber does not work with plums.’”
“But what if he needs to protect himself from a Nargle swarm?” asked Luna, tilting her head.
As they played, Draco pondered whether to bring up the fact that he had seen the chess board before, in the memory Harry first Occluded him from. It clearly meant something to him if he’d brought it on his attempted escape, but he’d reacted badly the last time he’d been pressed on this particular point.
It took a solid moment before Lockhart noticed Neville curled up on the floor like a dried up Flobberworm, and even then he looked doubtful about whether it was the right moment to drop character.
Harry looked back, resolute. “Exactly what I said I’d do. I want to see your side.”
Well, that answered that, thought Draco, turning to the elf. “You, go and fetch an—”
“The relative rights of the non-magical and, er, muggle born in the broader wizarding society.”
“I only meant,” Draco continued quickly, adopting a more sympathetic tone, “For the exercise, we were starting out somewhere you felt safe, right?”
Draco hesitated momentarily but something about the calm way she sat there, the knowing glint in her eye, told him the jig was up. In fact, some part of him had known she always knew more than she was letting on. Maybe it was that day on the golf course or the damned cards.
Draco and Harry shared a nervous glance, but Luna barrelled on. “It was like I was looking through my own eyes, but things were different. Voldemort had already returned and they were rounding up Muggle-borns and half-bloods. No one was at Hogwarts anymore. I was with my father and a group of other rebels working on how to overtake St Mungo’s, where they were holding people captive and—”
“So good to see you, Harry,” said Hermione, wrapping him in a big hug. There was still a light dusting of snow on her outermost cloak after running in from the return journey to Hogwarts, but she tossed it to the side, revealing a woolly knitted dress and stockings underneath. “Hope you had a happy holiday!”
“Guys I still can’t see.”
Kreacher toddled into the room as Harry was silently pondering Draco’s expression in the firelight, bringing a plate of biscuits for the hardworking group. Draco looked up from his writing to smile politely at the elf, accidentally catching Harry’s eye.
“You played golf with my father?” Draco asked, hesitantly. He was almost certain this could not be the case. He couldn’t remember a time his father had touched a non-magical item, much less picture him walking around a green.
“Excellent, the two of cups,” said Angelica brightly. “A strong partnership, based on balance and respect. Two opposing forces coming together. Between them is the staff of Hermes, a symbol of commerce and negotiation — the balancing of ideals.”
“Muggles really can’t see this?” he asked, wonder-struck.
“Well, at least apologise to Theo. You owe him that much. You ripped that poor boy’s heart out,” said Pansy in hushed tones as they sped past two Hufflepuff girls squealing and chatting outside of the Great Hall, turning down a more isolated route.
“It hasn’t changed anything yet,” said Draco, glancing back to the foyer door. Where was the messy haired git?
“Yeah, it is actually, thanks,” said Harry.
Draco faltered, catching the eye of the little snake. He wasn’t sure why, it wasn’t like the creature could understand him. But something in her piercing black eyes made Draco feel like he was being seen through.
“Come with me,” said his father, steering him down the corridor towards the north wing of the house. “The Dark Lord has requested your presence most urgently.”
Hermione continued reading, “Umbridge is mandating all sorts of rules to try and keep the student body in line, but they convene in the Room of Requirement when they can to look after each other and share news.”
He was pressing in again on the thoughts of Harry, of McGonagall. The Fidelius held, but when pressured, they became hazy, like white paint had been sloppily applied to any memories of Harry. When he couldn’t make any headway there, he raked over any mortifying or personally guarded memory he could find – his kiss with Theo, his fear pulling Snape’s unresponsive form from the basin of the Pensieve, the sadness in his heart at the loss of Dumbledore.
Luna and Hermione were to keep a cursory discourse, though Luna informed the group she would write in a secret language of her own design for added security, handing Hermione a key of strange symbols. Draco would have paid good money to see Hermione’s face when she opened one of Luna’s letters.
“You’re overthinking it. Being a Muggle isn’t so bad. You don’t have to wear robes for one thing.”
“Silence, you fool,” spat Voldemort, turning away from the room to look at his own reflection. He still looked whole, like the last time Harry had seen him, but Charlotte was right. His cheeks were growing hollow, his red eyes were ringed with purple like a bruise. “Quite the Muggle you’ve found yourself, Potter. She reminds me very much of your mother. It would be a shame for her to end up the same way.”
He’d been exiled from the Room of Requirement, the one place he wanted to be, and he had no interest in running into another living soul who would inevitably want to talk about something meaningless. Or worst of all, be alone with his thoughts.
Draco hardly noticed the surprised look on the face of the late night front desk attendant at the Langham, as he made his way from the floo corridor to the lifts at Merlin only knew what hour in the morning. His steps echoed off the tiled floor, just like they did in the corridors at the Manor, reminding him very much of home.
“Really?” asked Angelica innocently. “He seemed perfectly at ease last weekend, and we were on a muggle golf course out in the open.”
Hermione summoned a large book titled
This was not what Draco was expecting. The weight of the last six months was lifted off his shoulders just a hair and he could breathe.
“Thanks. For coming to check on her,” Harry started.
This chapter contains some text sampled from Deathly Hallows. No infringement is intended and sampled text is italicised.
In the end, the noisy box was fixed and the enormous man settled himself in front of it for a few hours, while Minerva eavesdropped from her position on the garden wall. The great oaf seemed quite perturbed at a team of men in blue uniforms who were fighting over a ball with their feet, but changed the channel intermittently to the local news, which he watched while anxiously tugging at his moustache.
“Longbottom?” Draco scoffed. “Come on Luna, you can do better than that. You’re a pure-blood, aren’t you? Let me set you up with someone, just tell me what you’re looking for.”
“Seems about as likely Indiana Jones’s Arc of the Covenant,” said Harry, pretending to sort through memory phials but too distracted with thoughts of the others to do anything useful.
“It’s melted!” said Harry, as if this were a triumph. “A softening charm followed by a warming charm gives you a melting charm. But interestingly, it doesn’t work the other way – warming then softening only gives you a warm soft thing. It’s like coding, there’s an order of operations, you just have to know how to stack the building blocks.”
Hermione arrived a few hours later to find Harry dozing in the window seat and Luna asleep on a pile of cushions on the couch, with Ivy curled up between the pages of a Herblogy text on her lap. Ignoring the evidence of several failed experimental charms around the room, Hermione pulled some coffee off the elf shelf and started going through the hundreds of small memory phials, selecting a new pile for review.
“Basilisk venom is really rare,” said Hermione. “I don’t think you can buy it even if we had the money. Neville mentioned that Dumbledore said something about Fiendfyre. I don’t know much about it but I can look up the spell and see what it would take.”
“I think I’d rather take my chances on my own, thanks,” said Harry, withdrawing his wand from his jacket pocket.
“Snape?” he said.
“It was actually really great,” said Harry honestly, regaling Hermione with his and Luna’s adventures of the past few weeks.
“Well, uh. We’ll be off then,” Draco said, addressing the portrait. He glanced back at Tonks in the doorway, who was standing with her arms crossed. “Off on a transport run, as Tonks says. Sounds like it might be quite dangerous.”
he reminded himself sternly. But it rang hollow, even in his own head.
The paper bore a picture of a Morsmordre that had been spotted in the sky over Surrey, and the headline:
The portraits on the wall were already chatting animatedly as Harry and Draco arrived. Some were packing their things as if to move out of their painting, others were speaking angrily with their neighbours about the indecency of a Ministry raid on the school.
“Right,” said Hermione, pulling on her robes and looking more unconcerned about breaking school rules than Harry would have thought possible.
“My, my, but you’re acting suspicious,” drawled the voice of Blaise Zabini from behind the wing of the armchair.
“That’d make her older than you, Ced,” said Harry, refilling his own Butterbeer.
Harry studied Draco through the cloak. Where there would normally be a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips, they were set in a straight line, his jaw tight. The usually cocky raised eyebrow was flat with seriousness.
“Don’t be overeager, Draco. It is unseemly,” said Lucius over his wine glass. “The book may yet pass to you someday when you are deemed ready. Until then, hold your tongue. One does not wish to seem desperate.”
“That’s just great.” Harry shoved himself back from the table. “If I wasn’t already being hunted by unidentified dark forces, I’d be dying anyway of a magical parasite. I’m starting to think I was better off as a Muggle. I haven’t gotten any answers about what happened to my parents, or why I’m being targeted for this, only that I’m probably not safe anywhere at this point. On top of which I can’t do basic Transfiguration to save my life.”
“What, so you’re just going to abandon us now?” demanded Harry, his magic crackling around him. “For all we know, Charlotte could be—”
Whatever concerns Potter had, they paled in comparison to Draco’s burdens. Not only did he have his mother’s safety to worry about, and his accursed guilt over his deception of the rest of the group, he now had Theo following him around like a lost puppy. His dreams were alternatingly tormented with visions of watching Tonks disappear into the rubble of a deteriorating London, and doing things to Potter that he wouldn’t even have attempted with Theo.
“Do you think they’re trying to tell us something?” she asked in her airy way to no one in particular.
“And I was back at the school training students how to fight in Dumbledore’s Army,” said Luna, her eyes wide. “Where was Draco?”
Looking around, he could see the uniform little houses of Privet Drive whizzing by as he cycled past. He turned onto Lilac Ave towards the park, and the street stretched out ahead of him, the warm summer sun glinting off square windows. Harry could feel his feet turning as he pedalled, and his heart lifting as he remembered the feeling of escape – what if he just kept cycling? Somewhere the roads would stop looking familiar and who knows where he’d be then.
“Just anxious, I guess,” said Draco.
and flicking it closed in frustration. “I’m positive there’s nothing about Horcruxes in any of the books on dark arts I’ve read. Cedric, have you seen it in the field?”
“So what are you doing here, Harry?” asked Draco, turning his head to look at the other boy.
“You planned this from the very beginning,” said Harry, his features contorted with disbelief and disgust. “The train station, everything. It was all your doing. You
“The Dark Lord believed the Potter child had the power to defeat him,” said Snape, tears of laughter forming in his eyes. “And now they both do.”
“I will tell you about the meeting when there’s time,” said Draco, putting an exasperated hand to his forehead. He’d divulged as much as he could to Pansy following the golf weekend, but after what he’d learned from his afternoon’s meeting, he wondered if he’d already said too much. He needed time to think it over before he told anyone else what Lucius had been up to. Draco was furious with his father. And really, what had he been thinking, going off to Azkaban without telling him and his mother what was waiting out there?
His logical brain knew he needed time to process this, maybe time to grieve, but the hum of magic coursing through his fingertips told him otherwise. The only thing that would bring him resolution was to act.
“Now, Malfoy,” said McGonagall pointedly.
“I have nothing but Harry’s welfare in mind,” said Dumbledore, serenely. “Now let’s say our goodbyes.”
“Quirinus Quirrell was a professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts for several years before he took a sabbatical to travel the world, returning after a nasty run-in with vampires in the Black Forests,” said Cedric, laying out a few clippings of evidence from the file. “The experience bolstered him to apply for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position which he taught in 1991.”
“The same reason we were all unsure in the beginning,” said Draco, gesturing out to the group. “I was concerned Potter might be dangerous. That
“They say I can do whatever I want,” said Draco, settling back down on his elbows and surveying Harry. “You can stay here as long as you need, if that’s what you’re worried about. I could stay here as well… we could see how that would work.”
“The room seemed like a good place to start at any rate,” said Draco, avoiding the subject of the memory as best he could. “What was that place?”
“Do not tell me you’re frowning because you forgot an ingredient,” said Pansy’s voice in his ear. “There’s literally five minutes left of this lesson and I don’t have time to re-brew this.”
“Can’t you see how that can go wrong?” said Harry. “Without balance of power, the people at the top will just choose anything that’s in their best interest. It’s human nature.”
“The lyin’ arse!” choked out Hagrid, big tears now welling in his eyes. “How could he do that to Lily an’ James? An’ little Harry here, huh?” He sniffled loudly and rubbed at his nose with the sleeve of his coat. “And I almost fell for it! He tried to take Harry as well, but I told him I was bringing him to you. Strict orders.”
“Great.” Draco squared up to Harry, attempting to sound more optimistic than he felt. “This will help.”
If he could just end this game, he could get to the Room of Requirement and see what was going on. If Potter had somehow made it back alive, then what could have caused the
“Where are we headed?” asked Charlotte, slinging the bag over her shoulder.
The water from Hufflepuff’s Cup had healed him almost entirely, but the Mark remained, jet black on his pale forearm. By the time the cup healed him, it was already part of him. Draco tugged the sleeve of his jacket down reflexively.
“Punished? You think the Mark is a punishment, Lucius?” thundered Voldemort. “It is an honour. With this Mark, your son becomes one of my disciples, hand selected from the many to rise to power by my side. It is a gift.”
“Whatever happens, it won’t affect the game we have to play in a few hours,” said Draco forcefully. “Nott, channel that energy into smashing Hufflepuff. Pansy, I’ll come find you after the game. My father will know more about this.”
Narcissa pulled Draco closer and kissed him on the cheek. “I defer to your judgement on the matter entirely.”
“If things are getting that bad, maybe we ought to go back and see if we can’t get a few of them out. I reckon Abe would help,” said Harry.
“Thestrals of course,” said Luna.
“Great Gobstones!” squeaked Hermione in alarm.
“Great, I’m dying to know.”
“Yes, a gift. You know, something someone gives you because they care about you,” said Luna, looking at Draco with indulgent patience.
“Do you think we may get called up early?” asked Theo, drumming his fingers nervously. Pansy bit her lip, turning to Draco with a look of concern. Draco recognised his window to exert control over the group; now was not the time to fall to pieces.
“My apologies, Dolores,” said McGonagall, her back straight and hands laced in front of her on the desk as though she were facing a poorly behaved student rather than a grown woman. “I wasn’t expecting an unannounced visit at 8pm on a school night. I was tied up here with an important matter involving the school poltergeist.”
He tried to steer Harry back to the small cupboard, but Harry didn’t listen. He took a few more steps into the spray, feeling the water come up to his waist, now his chest. It lifted him off his toes and he was floating, grinning and kicking his feet experimentally. Harry swam farther. His ears submerged, the din of the beach died away and he felt perfectly calm.
When Draco came around next, it was one of the rare times in the past few weeks that Harry was perfectly alone. He was worried he might choke when he saw him again, revealing his missteps in a flurry as Snape had done the other evening. But when he laid his eyes on Harry, he felt surprisingly calmed.
“Not great,” said Harry, coming around beside him and trying to lift the thing with his arms. It didn’t even budge. “That won’t work either.”
“You’re not ready,” said McGonagall, a bit too quickly. “But Mr Malfoy is here to help you with that.” She gestured to him and he put on his most endearing smile.
He showed her harder times too; his runaway attempt, the visions through Voldemort’s eyes, the blowup within the team. Hermione watched dutifully, like a silent jury member as the memories paraded by, until they were up to the present. Luna handed him the diadem and suddenly he was here.
“But the Pensieve—” said Harry, glancing back at the mysterious silver liquid. All the answers they needed, they wouldn’t be able to unlock them without this.
which flew across the room and slammed into the far wall. Harry raked his hair out of his face, trying to think logically. What would Draco want him to do?
“I know it’s late, but it’s urgent.” He attempted to unlock the door but it held fast. Snape must have really had it with his intrusions. He thought about twisting Snape's arm – surely he would open the door if he thought Lucius would hear about it. But he was too exhausted for threats.
And then there was Lucas Martin, whose eyes in every DADA class flicked from Harry to the space just to the left of his head, causing him to turn around and face completely empty air, and who had raised his hand to say, “Who is that man?” much to Harry’s bewilderment and, disturbingly, none of the student’s surprise.
“Don’t be,” said Draco. “My fault for not getting a shield up in time. More’s the pity, I was about to hit you with an excellent Stunner.” Yet Malfoy’s smile didn’t reach his eyes.
“Go tell the others I need you to apparate me home, and I’ll tell Gemma,” said Harry, his voice controlled. “Then take the Italian restaurant exit we came in on and meet me in the side street in the opposite direction from the hotel.”
“Right,” said Harry, with an eye roll.
“Do you recognise this from any of the artefact books?” asked Harry, glancing down the long list of items written in Luna’s curly handwriting. “Maybe the Crown of Caligula. ‘The legions of Rome were bound to follow the orders of the wearer.’ That sounds like something a tyrant leader would be after.”
“What you’ve missed is me,” said Angelica frankly. “Did you think daddy just tells me when to jump and I jump? My father had no idea you existed until a few weeks ago.”
His mind turned to Draco. Harry flopped back in the window seat with a groan, remembering how he had shut him out of his mind, turning his friends away in anger when they told him a truth he didn’t want to hear. If there was any loss of trust it would be on their side.
“Sorry I’m late, Professor, had to reschedule Quidditch practice,” said Draco, taking a few steps into the classroom before acting surprised at seeing the Head of Gryffindor house. “Oh, Professor McGonagall. I didn’t realise you’d be here.”
“And while we’re on the topic, I find it interesting that when we were having our little heart-to-heart, you neglected to mention that you were nearly the casualty of a full on Reductor Curse a few weeks before leaving the force. Can’t imagine that has something to do with your little ‘ongoing investigation’, does it?”
She laughed, and he gave her a kiss on the cheek, took a swig of his whiskey on the table and went out into the club to find Harry.
“I want to understand,” said Harry.
“Oh yeah?” said Harry with a laugh. “Hate to break it to you, Malfoy, but sports betting does not count as employment.”
“Still, we better hurry. I think we should go down the east corridor stairwell.” Hermione turned right down the corridor. “It’s usually empty on the days there’s no Defence seminar.”
“You don’t get it do you,” said Harry, wheeling on him, his eyes flashing dangerously. “This isn’t just some show to watch for your own entertainment; this is my life. If there are memories that are buried it’s because I’ve spent damn near my entire life trying to keep them that way.”
“Roast it is,” said Harry, pulling down the shade on the enchanted shelf.
“The implications of this are that you will not be able to speak of this student to anyone, including your parents, in which case Severus is taking the burden of your guardianship in this decision.”
Draco paused, kicking himself for missing something so obvious that Granger had spotted it. Potter wanted to get to know him. To feel like he wasn’t alone. He wasn’t impressed by titles or blood status like Draco’s peers; he was looking for a level on which he could relate.
“You’re gay.”
“Making a buck? Yeah, I guess you could say that,” said DuPont with a shrug. “But if life gives you a buck, build an empire.”
“Can it, Fred. I’m too desperate for a drink for that to be funny,” said Tonks. “Shacklebolt’s going to have my hide if I’m late to one more drop off. Is everyone ready?”
“Look, I didn’t come here for you people to change me,” said Harry, his temper rising. “I didn’t come here for anything, frankly, but since I’m here I’ve agreed to learn what I have to to protect myself, and there was nothing in the agreement about what my vision had to be to make that happen.”
1 November, 1981
“I can spend time with him first,” Draco offered, looking around at the unlikely team McGonagall had assembled. “He doesn’t need a wand for what I’ve got to teach him.”
“When this is all over,” said Harry. “I want to give it a shot. With you.”
“Draco! I was wondering when you’d be back,” she said, placing the cake on the end table and hopping off the side of the bed.
Draco recognised his cue to step forward and extend a hand. “How do you do?” he asked.
They sat in silence for a moment, listening to the leaves rustle. The sun was setting and the park was getting colder, but Harry was happy to stay in the park as long as Charlotte would. It was definitely better than whatever he’d be walking into at home.
“Granger?” Draco interrupted. “Professor – you can’t be serious. Granger’s a nut, everyone knows it. Remember when she hexed Weasley after the Yule Ball for not wanting to dance with her? He was vomiting slugs for weeks.”
“What, the room?” Harry scrambled after her, grabbing his invisibility cloak off the back of his desk chair. “You can’t actually think the Room of Requirement will be able to pull a Horcrux out of thin air for us.”
“You don’t want to make this hard on yourself, boy, it’ll only prolong the pain,” threatened Yaxley, bearing down on Harry. Harry had time to cast a
“Surely you have a tracker on him, something we can use to find him?” said Hermione in a panicked voice as she, Draco, and Cedric gathered in the kitchen after finding no trace of Harry in the rest of the house.
“So keeping me a secret at the castle, avoiding telling me anything about this evil power that’s hunting me, I’m the only one that’s still in the dark?” Harry could feel his pulse rising.
“I don’t know, but we need to keep him here until we’re certain,” said McGonagall. “Perhaps we can leverage the Occlumency lessons to learn more. Are you sure Draco is up to the task?”
“Maybe it was an accident?” said Hermione, biting her thumbnail. “He could be trying to get back right now and unable to find the house under all the wards.”
“More importantly,” said Harry, reaching into his shirt pocket and feeling a tiny body twine around his fingers. “How’s our stowaway?”
Suddenly, there was a sound from the hall. His mother ran into the room. She was afraid. She turned to Harry, an unfamiliar expression on her face, and ran to him, laying gentle hands on his small frame. Whispering something, attempting to calm him, Harry could see her chest heaving with worried breaths. He realised for the first time just how young she was – no more than 20 years old.
“What mark?” Harry lay very still, letting Draco run his fingers through his hair.
said Harry, holding out the sleeve of his jumper so Ivy could coil her way around his wrist.
A few minutes later, Harry and Charlotte dropped down to hide behind tall bushes in the park, gasping for breath after having made a break for it from the scene of the crime. They could hear the thundering steps of Dudley and his crew not far behind them, growing closer, and then passing their spot as they held their breath. Once the danger had passed, they looked at each other and broke into laughter.
Hermione hesitated, her straightforward gaze making Draco’s stomach turn. “It’s funny. I always thought you were just another spoiled pure-blood. But Harry seems to think there’s something more to you than that.”
“I don’t,” he said. “And I didn’t. Now run along before I have to dock points for lingering.”
Narcissa wiped away her last tears and closed her eyes. “Alright then, I trust you. Do what you need to do.”
“Oh,” said Harry, turning towards a smug Draco and remembering the barrage of jinxes he fired at Cedric last time.
“Now is not the time to be threatening the Ministry, Minerva. Not from your position,” said Umbridge with a chuckle, withdrawing her wand and tapping it in her palm. “Dumbledore was a threat to the sanctity of our government and had to be stopped. I only wish I could have been the one to stop him. Alas.” Umbridge sighed wistfully.
Draco massaged his temple and wondered why in Merlin’s name had he been saddled with this twit for the last half hour. He looked at Gemma incredulously, but she seemed not to notice and carried on with her story, as enthralled with the sound of her own voice as Gilderoy Lockhart on his autobiographical book tour. Draco took a big drink from his glass and scanned the crowd for the rest of his group.
“Yes, and that is why I have entertained the idea to begin with. Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t dream of putting you in this position, but professor Snape has assured me that based on your private tutelage, your skills at Occlumency are second only to his in the castle, and seeing as he is unable to be involved for personal reasons—”

“We’re honestly just really good friends,” said Harry, feeling Draco’s eyes on him. “Why?”
