“Very well then. I’ll take it into consideration”. She smiled broadly at him.
Harry groans. He remembers the drawings well; it was another one of those instances where he had a nice little chat with his Muggle teacher, wondering how he got such ‘fantastical ideas’.
“No! I have a friend who’s concerned. He’s also Teddy’s cousin, incidentally” she smiled at Sanaz, who nodded thoughfully.

My thesis should be finished in two weeks, and I'll resume writing lengthier and more in-depth chapters again.
“Yes, but-”
, had outweighed the annoying minutes of shaving, and he had gladly complied. These days, he just felt so tired. And it wasn’t like anyone was touching his face
It hurt too much, and in that moment, Harry had known he was a coward too, and that was unbearable. And perhaps, he realized, now confronted with the Malfoy that came to Neville’s shop, that had the patience for tea with Mrs. Picklewilly (no small feat, that), that came and cooked for Teddy –and him, incidentally- because Teddy’d been ill and he was his cousin, that there might be things about Malfoy that he
Thank you, for bearing with me. Next up is Harry, and after I have finally laid some foundations, we'll get to the actual romance, shall we?
“I’m sure you know about the role I played in the war, Lawrence. So you can imagine we weren’t best mates on the quidditch pitch, before.”
“What?” Potter croaked in confusion.
Draco coughed awkwardly. “I’m afraid I’m not Granger, Potter”. He stated, still disbelieving at Potters appearance. Potter frowned, squinted again. At this point Draco realized Potter wasn’t wearing his glasses; perhaps that was why he was squinting so much.
Ron and Hermione had come for their near-weekly Saturday brunch. Hermione seemed recovered from her illness, and had tried to make up for her absence at Teddy’s birthday party by waking him up with an extra present –clawed socks, and Teddy had groggily hugged her in delight. The three of them used to all go out to a indistinct muggle club on Friday night, crash at Grimmauld, and then sleep in, sharing hangover potions and breakfast. Nowadays, especially since Harry had permanent custody of Teddy, Harry found he couldn’t really justify going out out as much. Plus, Marcus had never really liked clubbing, despite Harry’s need for letting go once in a while. "I want you to be able to relax
Oh Merlin. He hadn’t meant
“Shelly, aside from being quite a wonderful cellist, is a fixture within the Ministry’s department of Internal Wizarding Affairs. He has the Minister’s ear when he wants it. He’s been especially useful since the birth of his grandson. Found his spine, so to say”.
“Ehm, well, yes, he has”. He answers awkwardly. Neville is displaying a little smirk, and continues
“Ahem. I intended the strawberry cream thing for him, actually. It seemed more… age appropriate?” he cocked his head slightly. “
After the puddings have been eaten, Teddy is obviously flagging. The colour he regained with his cooking enthusiasm has leached from his face, and he’s slumped in his seat. Potter has spotted it as well, and strokes his brown hair.
“Not at all my intention, Mailwizard Fawcett. I’ll take my leave.” He bows a little, and leaves, taking with him the forms.
“We all know Potter and Belby broke up, Granger. It’s not news”.
“Would you like them to sing a specific lullaby?” he asked.
He frowns at Harry as he sets the spell on the flowers, but figures asking is impertinent. He wonders too, at how it is that
“Get up” he says to himself. Brighid hoots at him. His job wasn’t about him, really. It was about doing
“Shhh, Teddy, that’s normal” he stroked his godsons hair, leaned back. “The Healer said no metamorphing for the next week, okay?”
I've had the first sentence of this chapter floating around in my head for ages.
“Actually, Potter, I’m not sure I can tell Hermione that”.
“Flower Delivery for Reginald Edgecombe.” He stuck out the bouquet, and hated that he had to look
Neville shrugs. “We all choose to show different parts of ourselves. I reckon Draco wanted you to know him
‘Dromeda came by Grimmauld with chicken stew that night, and they had a lovely cosy evening. She tucked Teddy in, even if he was ‘too old for it’, and Harry was happy to keep the leftovers. That would mean another hearty dinner tomorrow, no takeout or ready-meals, or the more likely cereal. When Andromeda came downstairs, he had lit the fire and poured some wine.
“More than you care to know, Potter” he whispered in the space between them, voice low. Potter’s pupils dilated a fraction.
All in all, the house was livable, but not overly homey. Not somewhere you'd want to be, all alone, rattling about. Harry figured he’d get round to redoing it someday, really. When Teddy was older maybe, or –and he cursed himself now for being so sentimental-, with someone else, expanding their little family. But he could forget about all of that, what with the horribleness of the Witch’ Weekly article, and Marcus’ lousy scribble saying “

“Do you happened to have any Amaryllis?” he posed.
“Due soon, is she not?” he stepped in further, put down his pastry bag on the counter.
“Wow” he croaked. “Oh god. Wow!” he added, voice rising. “Mione, that’s amazing!” He jumped up and leaned over the table to hug her, smiling widely. Leaning over to Ron, he knocked over the pumpkin juice, but nobody cared, except Teddy, whose toast was now drenched. “You’re having a baby!” He laughed, clapping Ron on the back. “Well done mate!”. Teddy stared with wide eyes at Hermione, dripping toast still in one hand. “You have a baby in your belly? Like, now?!” He exclaimed. Hermione laughed loudly and leaned over to hug him, and Teddy let her with an ‘umph’.

“But, how would Lucius know to do this?” he asks, incredulous. Lucius had been in Azkaban for years now. He should be half mad, not up to making cunning plans at all.

He turns, and apparates home.
wouldn’t allow him to. He would see what bastard had thought to lure Marcus away, and with it, his hopes for a normal family. He took off his disillusion spell, making the little Witch next to him jump and squeak. She hadn’t seen him enter, obviously. She seemed to be one of those who were so shocked by both his fame and his sudden disappearance that she was temporarily struck dumb. That suited him just fine. He briefly regretted his scruffy clothes, complete with some stray twigs, but at least he had on the Spectral Sprout apron, a cloudy grey embroidered with dark blue leaves, hand sown by Hannah, who was surprisingly crafty.
Neville snorts in laughter. Harry feels a bit wrongfooted, but also pleased. It seemed Malfoy really wasn’t out to get him, and this just proved it. At last, the tension seeps from Lawrence’s frame, and the conversation turns to Teddy. Harry learns little of who this young man actually his, but he can’t help but like him. Something about him is familiar, in his sharp questions, his eagerness to know things.
their strings, scattering all over the floor. Expensive plants, those were. Wanted as potion ingredients, show-pieces in terrariums, and as of lately, jewelry. All the rage amongst the Muggle-borns, deemed an animal friendly alternative to other pearls. Neville had started growing some just before Hannah fell pregnant, but still had a hard time keeping them healthy, let alone grow a variety of different colours.                                The red and purple bouquet was due at the Ministry, as had a lot Neville’s orders lately. He had disillusioned himself several times to bring them in, not wanting to be haunted by both the press nor other Ministry workers. Occasionally he stopped by at Hermione’s office, or went to chat with Ron.
He looked down at his side when he felt a weight press against him, and saw that Teddy had fallen asleep against him, after all. His irritation melted away into tenderness, and he looked up to see all three of them looking at them. “What?” he said quietly.
He now reached for Neville’s parchment, which read:
“At least they know who you are, and not to believe a word you say!” Lawrence yells back, pushing against Draco’s chest. “God! I feel so stupid now, trying to be friends! Thinking we were equals!”.
“Indeed,” Draco nodded, but he didn’t share her apprehension –or at least, had resigned himself to the fact. “You do realize you will start showing at some point soon, do you not?” he drawled.
Teddy’s room was at the end of the first floor landing, up a few steps, and was –as to be expected, a riot of colour. The walls were done in a tasteful minty green –when Harry had taken over care for Teddy when he was three, he figured the calming tone would be best, but over the years Teddy had made it his own. Stuffed animals were lying everywhere, as were uneven socks. Tacked on the walls were drawings, little memorabilia Teddy liked to collect –tickets from the movies or the zoo, magazine clippings of muggle robots, and above his bed, a picture of Tonks and Remus, holding a little bundle with changing blue and pink hair, Remus looking up in delighted disbelief, Tonks full of pride and love, glancing from Teddy to Remus. Harry ignored the stab of grief in his chest every time he saw it.
“Oh, this and that. Not important dear.” She settles a bit more comfortably in the chair, and continues  “I can tell you she’s not all that happy with old Lucius, you know.” Harry’s mind was reeling. This was private information! He sincerely hoped she didn’t divulge his secrets so easily, but then again, he’d never heard a whisper of this before, so perhaps she
, of all things.
“So, Teddy will be fine,” he probed again, even though he knew it wasn’t that simple. “why are you so worried, then, Hermione?”
Harry, feeling chastised, turns around to properly take care of his hands. He hears the muffled sounds of a tense conversation, the boy biting out short sentences and Neville’s soothing timbre. Harry takes a few deep breaths. He wasn’t on trial, and neither was Malfoy, he has to remind himself. Maybe he should hold off judgement on this boy until he knew what was going on. He forced his shoulders to unclench, and turns to the sunroom.
Thank you for bearing with me, and for leaving comments and kudos. It is especially those comments that have given me the motivation to finish another chapter, and that keep me writing. Being ill is isolating, not even mentioning the ongoing plague. So, please tell me what wonderful thing you've discovered in your life, and make this a very cheerful comment section. A favourite tea perhaps?
His keys jangle as he opens the door to the apartment. He pushes away any thougt pertaining to how often he will get to do that again, and steps inside. He wants to sleep for a week, now, but he still needs to get to the office, and he can’t afford to slack

In his eyes had been everything that Harry had wanted to use as a counter argument. How Malfoy had bullied Hermione, called her a Mudblood. How he had tried to get Buckbeak killed. Hagrid fired from his job. How he had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Attempted Dumbledore’s murder. How

someone had to come and ruin it, and of course it had to be bloody Malfoy.
“Hey, Teds. I hope you behaved, hm?” he ruffled Teddy’s black hair, relieved there was no imitation scar hiding underneath this time. Andromeda sighed deeply and set down the shopping bags in the hallway.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded. “Sure, but only those stripy ones over there”. He pointed to the delicate white and pink striped blooms.
funny!” she sniffs, rubbing at her eyes roughly. “These stupid hormones make me cry at everything” She exclaims, frustrated. Draco squeezes her shoulder. “Do you need some carrot cake?” he tries, with a little smile.
“Oh, I’m not even a person, now, Belby?” Malfoy sneers again, and with all the dignity he can muster, wipes his face with a tea towel. There’s still some flower dusting his collar, but his posture is again rigid, his chin high.
There was something scintillating about Malfoy, standing in front of him, swirling grey eyes intent on his, one eyebrow raised in impatient anticipation –was that a pureblood thing?- looking elegant in his slim-fitting black robes.
Viriliter age: act manfully or courageously.
son, in Mungo’s. You did!” Teddy had jumped up, looking ready to spit fire, despite that he had been vomiting not an hour earlier.
Draco nodded towards Teddy, then gave Potter a pointed look. Potter looked angrily at his strawberry and cream pastry and started poking at it. Draco took the cue and took a large bite of his own.
Teddy pulled a face when one of the other boys missed a shot completely. He seemed to be feeling fine today, after a hefty dose of Pepper-Up. He’d only woken once that night, finally not with a bloodcurdling nightmare but with potion-induced nausea. Easily soothed. Harry was still sleeping in Sirius’ room across the hall, but at least he was sleeping. Some.

?”. Malfoy laughed, out loud, a light and joyous sound. Harry wondered if he had ever heard it before, and decided he mustn’t have; he would have remembered.
“Beats me, kid.” He answers, and they enter the kitchen. On the table, next to the flowery bulb rests another two mugs of hot chocolate, steaming. Malfoy’s standing with his back turned, but has turned on the hob again. The kitchen is warm, and the radio has been turned on to a Muggle blues channel, where a female singer is crooning for her lost love. Not what he would’ve pegged Malfoy for, but then again, what would have pegged him for?
“OK, OK. I’m doing it,” he says, bothered by their hassling.
Harry is confused and agreeable all at once.
“You reckon?” asks Justin softly. His hair is dishevelled from where his rings got stuck, and it falls down his cheeks in waves which frame his heart-shaped face.
next chapter will be harry's arrival at hogwarts and what ensues ;)
It’s absence almost makes him run back, and he realises how foolish he is. He wouldn’t even know which way to go. He feels tears well up in his eyes against his will and he fights to keep them down. The atmosphere seems to feed on his anxiety, growing stronger as he becomes weaker. What if this is dark magic? For all he knows, Malfoy could have been tricking him into a false sense of security these last few days, waiting to pounce.
pressure. Pressure so great that Harry hadn’t even been aware he was suffocating under it until it was lifted from him, and he suddenly felt like he would drift off if nobody tied him down. The weight pushed him forward, into rash decisions and reckless behaviour. If he hadn’t gone ahead, he would have gone down.
He brushes his teeth and even manages to wash and cleanse his face, thank whatever God is blessing him with productivity on this chilly September night. Maybe it is just the adrenaline of being back. He hopes not, for this would mean impermanence.
“I suppose not, Mr. Potter. And are you not at all interested in pursuing a career in Quidditch? I can think of several teams who would be eager to sign you on,” Mcgonagall says earnestly. Harry’s heart aches. Here’s the thing: Quidditch will always have a place in his life, for how could it not? Being his release of tension for such a long time means that he is bound by duty, and at the very least, nostalgia, to love the game. But in the way that one unwillingly outgrows their favourite childhood jumper, he feels like the version of him who would have thrived in that type of competitive limelight died in the Forest, was left behind as Harry boarded the train in the Kings Cross Purgatory.
harry finally reads draco's mysterious 'papers'
After his discovery of Malfoy’s stuffed pet, Harry had had no clue what to do with the rest of his day. He had waited for Malfoy to show up, anticipating a reaction that would have fueled Harry’s sudden hunger for a fight. Alas, the bastard was frustratingly absent from both the common room and the dormitory the entire day, and this left Harry feeling lost and a little disappointed. He was overwhelmingly bored, and concerned that if he stayed still for too long he may begin to deteriorate. So far the unfamiliarity of his sleeping quarters had both managed to unsettle him, in their strangeness, and comfort him, as he has no traumatic memories associated with them. Harry had been festering in his bed for a while, glaring at the plush dragon perched opposite him on Malfoy’s perfectly folded sheets, when the general sense of tediousness which hung around the room made the decision for him that he needed to leave. So he had exited the dorms, with no goal in mind other than keeping his mind at bay.
He looks to others and the realities they all live. Hermione suffers with nightmares about Malfoy Manor, he knows, and the memory of Bellatrix. Justin has no clue how to handle his prejudiced family. Ron thinks about Fred almost all the time, Harry sees it when his eyes go distant and zoom in on nothing. They all struggle, but the common denominator between them all is that all their problems lie with people, with the impact of others on their lives. Between their flashbacks, between their moments of sadness, they function- can live normally, even. Harry’s issue is with himself, and
“Yep, you got it! I just got your text,” and Harry takes that as confirmation that the service at Hogwarts is truly shit, since he actually sent it days ago. He had begun to think that she wasn’t going to reply; had resigned himself to accepting this fated rejection. It had been disheartening- the fact that even strangers end up abandoning him- which doesn’t even make sense, considering that they are precisely that-
Again, she just giggles softly and continues with her craft. He studies her subtly, she has thick eyebrows and a nose ring- something he hasn’t seen since the punks that would cringe from Dudley’s bulbous figure at his old primary school. Weirdly, it looks soft on her, feminine and delicate, and he realises that it has a daisy gem on the hoop. Her small but straight nose is splattered with faint freckles, something he hadn’t noticed from afar. Ginny’s could be seen from Mars if you were looking, he’s sure.
“Not really, sorry. Just thought you were quite good looking.” She grins good-naturedly and he’s shocked into speechlessness, rather humiliatingly.
Not anticipating the comment, Harry snorts quietly. At this, Malfoy appears moderately shocked. He seems to forget his facade at times- it is increasingly inconsistent. Having to uphold such a stiff wall all the time must be tiring, it is natural he would slip sometimes, even in spite of being the natural cold bastard that he is. It’s either that, or Malfoy is half way to lunacy. With the way he flips between a blank state one second, to something resembling normalcy the next, it’s also a plausible explanation. Harry can understand it, at least- the switching on and off. You can be riding a gigantic tidal wave of anger, pain and loss, only to find yourself sliding along a bubbling stream in the next instance.
He doesn’t physically, but Harry can feel Malfoy mentally flipping him off.
Then, a
Harry waits patiently for him to wrap his head around the words, because he knows that distractions can be excruciating when you are having to read over the same sentence for the second, or even third time, because your brain is having a meltdown. That was him with the takeaway menu over the summer. It seems comical now but it made him feel dumb and useless.
It almost offends Harry that Malfoy has had the audacity to change. How dare he? All Harry wanted after coming out on the triumphant side of history, yet feeling more like a loser than ever, was a sense of normalcy. His mind went and deserted him in collapsing in on itself, becoming its own worst enemy. The same with his traitor of a body, losing any shape it once had, letting itself get weaker by the day. So he looked to others- but how the fuck can he expect Ron and Hermione to come out unchanged, after all they did for him? He couldn’t. Hogwarts was never going to be his ‘normal’ again, but he had crossed his fingers, toes, and anything else cross-able, that there might be some solace in lessons. No, they feel as stilted and useless as ever. Malfoy was his last hope and he just had to go and be all
His eyes are glowing, though curiously not as filled with rage as his words. It looks more like a type of desperation, tinged with sadness. He flails his arms once before folding them across his lap. If he thinks it will help him gain composure, they’re long past that stage.
“Oh...shit,” replies Harry, at a loss for words.
A piece of Ron’s hair falls out when he scratches his head, and the petrified expression on his face is enough to send Hermione and Harry into fits. By the time he has finished laughing, he has a stitch in his side and feels like it is very possible that he could also have abs.
It would have never worked.
“You what?” asks Malfoy, and the way he says it is empty, lacking. There should be at least a smidge of confusion in his voice- any other person would be perplexed by Harry’s erratic behaviour, but if there is any genuine feeling there, it is buried far too deep to be seen. The scornful wrinkles between his brows, however, are harsh, and certainly have no qualms about hiding. They make him look eerily like his father.
Harry laughs, unafraid of being loud. He wants Malfoy to hear.
Justin guffaws when the lights switch back to their dingy, normal colour upon his exit. Harry sighs and brushes his teeth even more vigorously.
Mcgonagall looks a little faint but in that no-fuss, practical way of hers, she sends her own Patronus off to Madam Pomfrey and rushes over to them. Suddenly, a thought seems to occur to her and she whips her iron gaze to Harry, pain in her eyes. “Potter, please tell me this wasn’t your doing,” she says, a plea in her voice.
He finds it strange that back in Hogwarts, he is finding it easier to block out the memories of the battle itself. Rather, he is tantalised by nightmares, both in sleep and consciousness, of the run, the fleeing, the year prior where everything was bleak and wreaked with dread. He supposes perhaps it is because Hogwarts feels changed. Maybe Mcgonagall’s reforms were a helpful idea, after all.
“My family are full of witches, did you know? That’s how I know these things.” she says seriously and he does a double take, thinking perhaps that she has caught onto him. There is a tense few seconds before she breaks character and laughs again. Her cheerful mood manages to make the heavy feeling that had been beginning to settle inside him again, dissipate.
Malfoy frowns a bit and the smallest sneer appears, like a reflex. “And what am I usually like?”
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy gestures to Harry’s general figure with exasperated hands. He says, bolder than Harry remembers him ever being before, “Potter, you literally broke into the Hospital Wing just to watch me.”
He can hear it now.
“Look, mate” he says, a furrow between his brows, and he hesitantly hands Harry the sheet, “See for yourself.”
And so Harry forces himself up, grabbing some toast from the hovering plate, and just about makes it through the day.
It is nonsensical. When all is said and done, he hasn’t the foggiest what kind of Potion would require such a bizarre ingredient. Not that is necessarily something he would have any knowledge of- Harry isn’t a Potions master by any standards. Speaking of...he speculates- granted without any evidence- whether this is a task Snape could have left behind for Malfoy. It would have been just like the greasy bastard to refuse to go without a dramatic exit. Truly, it is almost too easy to envisage Snape entering Kings Cross Station, or whatever his equivalent was, with his signature ridiculous swooshing of his robes. Harry hopes he tripped over them upon arrival.
He follows it, and try as he might, he cannot completely settle. There is still a tentative stillness in the air, a pressure that suffocates him. And of course, Harry himself continuously proves to be an issue.
He would skip Malfoy, of course, who has steadily ignored all of them, much to Harry’s frustration. His stoic face and poised expressions seem to deliberately miss Harry’s gaze, turning from him whenever there is any chance of interaction. The snubbing annoys Harry to no end. Yes, he had promised himself before coming that he would dismiss Malfoy, no matter how many taunts he would throw at Harry. And it isn’t that Harry isn’t pleased to see the need for such measures proved unnecessary. Candidly, he hasn’t the energy- but to not even warrant one single insult? Harry can practically feel the bruise on his ego. His plan was to go on as he always has, but apparently he cannot pretend that everything is normal, because in a sane world, Draco Malfoy wouldn’t act as if Harry doesn’t exist, or rather that he does, but as just some irritating bug on his shoulder. In a sane world, Harry would mean something to Malfoy- even if that something is
In the end, he says none of this. “Not that I can think of,” Harry responds, downtrodden. Anxiously, he jounces his leg. The quill rattles in its pot, and he realises that the entire desk is shaking along with him.
He whips out some forgettable excuse for Justin and Tony, who don’t seem to believe him, or care. Passing through the common room, he can hear Blaise Zabini taking the piss out of Ron in their dormitory and he grins, hoping that Ron’s ego can take it. If it ends in bloodshed, Harry will have to be the one to take him to the Hospital Wing. And he doesn’t relish that idea, thinking about Ron’s grumpy mood, justified but exhausting none the same.
of emotion in his presence. Merlin forbid.
Calling upon the memory of Neville’s golden eyes, a sure sign of his honest and true Gryffindor character, Harry wills himself to be brave once more. It is a skill that he is having to relearn, so he is a little rusty.
to me this was a wild one to write but who knows about reading
Trying to drown out the ringing in his ears, Harry curls in on himself and screws his eyes shut as tightly as he can.
A faint noise comes from the direction of the bathroom, indistinctly resembling a bird squawk. Taking a peek through a gap in his duvet, his eyes dart around the room. There is nothing alive but the dust mites that grab the light of the sun. The numbness that is long settled in his bones begs him to remain in bed,
“Don’t be ridiculous” Hermione scolds, although her lips wobble amusedly, “However, I won’t lie. I’m not particularly thrilled to be with Pansy. The look she gave me when we found out who we were being roomed with was almost feral. Still, we’ll see.”
“I-uh. I-I- uh. Thanks? Uh.” he splutters like an idiot and she laughs at him, boldly and with great volume.
The second piece of paper lies crumpled beside him too, but the single word that is written,
Maybe if he approaches it with the truth, Malfoy might not serve him up boiled for Fang’s dinner. “It’s not, but I want to know,” says Harry, on edge. He wraps his arms around his knees, noticing a significant gravy stain on his robes.
. “I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have, it’s just th-”
“So what is the potion for?” he inquires. If he is having to spend free hours in this dungeon, he wants a bloody good justification for doing so.
They are soon moving through Hogsmeade and everywhere Harry turns, he catches glimpses and flashes of ghosts of a battle once fought. He looks to the Hogshead Inn, and a memory replays in his head of Aberforth hurrying him, Ron and Hermione inside in the dead of the night. It drifts away but the recollection of the blaring alarm still screeches. Over at the Three Broomsticks, the image of Malfoy striding through the pub purposefully, his mission: to Imperio Katie Bell, is stuck in his mind's eye. He almost thinks he can see that blonde head of hair now through the window panes, a look of terror painted upon his features. He squints, and it’s somebody else, laughing and punching their friend’s arm, expression liberated in joy.
But something he had said jumped out at Harry.
“Me and Ron Weasley? I don’t think that would go over too well, do you?”
“I was going to wait till you were free. I thought it would make you more comfortable.”
Harry felt a tightness in his throat.
“I’ll have you know that I was considered quite tasteful, at school.”
Malfoy sat next to Harry on the sofa and curled up his feet. The tips of his stockinged toes touched Harry’s thigh. There was no reason it should be erotic. Harry wasn’t into feet.
“I told him everything,” he said.
” said Malfoy. “All the things on the list—I couldn’t even remember doing most of them… how much
“I think he really thought about each person he was apologising to, and what he had done to them,” said Hermione. “He just… misjudged the tone.”
“That’ll be nice,” said Astoria, moving away from Mirth to go look for something in her wardrobe. Mirth tugged unhappily at the bobby pins in her hair, pulling the hairstyle down around her ears.
“Jesus, chill out, I’ll take the kid to a museum!”
“I wasn’t pretending.”
“Absolutely not.”
“But you didn’t like LA,” said Draco, after they’d eaten. “You never talk about it.”
thought Draco,
“Would it matter, if I did?” asked Potter. “Pass me the crushed narwhal horn, will you?”
There were two wardrobes in the bedroom. One was empty except for an old cardboard box, which Harry made a mental note to return to Malfoy sometime. The other was full of the most beautiful clothes Harry had ever seen. Crisp shirts with permanent ironing charms. Soft cashmere jumpers in shades of bottle green, completely free of piles. A thick brown coat with toggles and a hood that Harry had the disorienting feeling he had once seen someone wear—Malfoy? And been envious of. All the trousers fit him perfectly. They made him seem taller, somehow. The shoes were Italian leather.
“No need to apologise. They look good, don’t they? I’ll let you in on a little secret.” Blaise leant in conspiratorially, and Harry leant forward despite himself. “The secret to dressing well… is to have a
“Society. I don’t know,” said Draco, flapping his hands. “
“Tiny,” said Harry. His fingers paused in Draco’s hair. “How are you feeling?”
“Adelaide. I

“Draco,” said Clarence. He looked as if he didn’t quite know what to say. Draco’s divorce had been in the papers, so everyone knew about it.
would feel if
“Yes.”
Draco rubbed his eyebrow with one finger.
“Okay.”
“You’re always reading something,” said Harry.
“I wouldn’t.”
“They look terrible. I’ve never seen them look like this.”
Adelaide locked herself in her bedroom, the music blaring. She had been cruel and sullen all evening. She hadn’t done her Transfiguration homework, and when Draco chided her, she said “You were a good student, weren’t you? Brilliant at magic? Why would I want to be like you? I’d kill myself if I had your life.” And Draco had blinked a few times, the way he always did when she said things like that, feeling as if something had just hit him in the head—and he would know—trying not to show how crumbling it was to be told all the worst things about yourself by someone you loved. He got back to the lesson, she stormed out and locked her bedroom door.
“He’s unhappy,” said Draco. “He’s all fucked from the war. And anyway, he’s right, it’s mental that we were ever together.”
“I know. I’ve quit my job.”
“You did such beautiful magic with it, when you buried her. I think that’s when I fell in love with you.”
“Give me a minute.”
“What did you wish for?” asked Draco. He spoke quietly, but he was so close that Harry didn’t miss a word. His lips were pink and chapped.
“No, I’m sorry, Potter. I appreciate you keeping me up to date. I’m just.” He laughed. “Frustrated.”
“You know. The usual.”
“You really didn’t know?” Malfoy’s voice changed. It sounded rather choked. Harry shook his head violently.
When put like that, Draco had to admit that it didn’t sound great. He wanted to defend himself, but he couldn’t seem to find the words.
With that, she stormed out of the room. They heard the front door slam shut a moment later.
At the time, Harry had been disgusted by his cowardice, by his pathetic excuses. Now, though…
Hermione put her hand on Ron’s.
“What does he say?”
“Hallo Dipsy. Would you make Draco some mashed potatoes?”
“I want to see him,” said Ron.
, if I was twenty-five no one would think twice!”
“You think he’s guilty,” she said.
Harry had the distinct impression that Draco had been waiting for him to return so he wouldn’t have to repeat himself. He handed Draco the tea.
“I’m not going to trust you until I’ve slept with you,” said Draco. The words sounded rehearsed. Harry cocked his head, confused, and Draco took a deep breath. “What if you’re only being… like this… because you haven’t had me yet? What if it’s just the chase?”
Ron, who had been holding back laughter, finally gave in, snorting loudly. Draco grinned at him. Parvati looked at Ron icily.
“Malfoy? Have you been in my room?” A pause, while Harry went to investigate. Draco didn’t stir from the window. He knew that Harry would soon be adding
“I’ve been thinking about that,” said Draco. “Pansy has agreed to be my Fancy Friend. We’re going to the Jules Verne on Thursday.”
Harry shook his head.
“But I don’t.”
“He is. Trust me.”
“Hello,” said Draco, uncertainly.
“Sorry.”
“Is that his coat?”
“I don’t want to hurt you. But I’ve got to try something. If it’s going to trigger the cruciatus—”
Malfoy laughed, but Cassie looked furious.
Astoria rolled her eyes, and Pansy grinned lecherously.
“Aren’t
As Harry had learned in fourth year, there was a lot of time spent in the library when your best friend was Hermione.
“No,” said Ron. “No way. I’m sorry, mate, but you absolutely cannot come.”
Fifteen minutes later, there came a loud series of clatters in the stairwell that re-awoke Walburga.
Draco closed his eyes, wincing slightly.
“How did you know?”
“Were you always this insecure?” asked Ginny, in wonder. “How did we miss it?”
“No,” said Draco. “Because the plan isn’t going to work.”
“She never noticed,” said Harry.
Pansy shook her head, amused.
“I’ve sometimes wondered,” said Seamus, holding his shirt pensively to his chest. “I thought, maybe that’s why Dean couldn’t keep it in his trousers. Because I was rubbish in bed.”
“To get some air, when I’m feeling jumpy,” he said.
Hermione cried during Draco’s act. Ron just stared, open-mouthed.
“He hated Harry,” he said.
They were surprised whenever he snapped at them, wounded when he made caustic remarks.
“Ginny and Neville will be at the Burrow,” said Harry.
“You’re such a cat,” Harry told him, twenty minutes later, when Draco opened his eyes and stretched.
“Point taken,” said Malfoy, smirking into his wine glass. Then he put his face into his hand and laughed.
“Are you all right?” asked Harry, when they were nearing the locker rooms. Draco smiled unconvincingly.
“All right,” said Draco, absently. “I’ll make something up. What shade?”
“C’mon,” said Ron. “Let’s go home.”
“Are you thinking about work?” asked Draco.
The crowd erupted in cheers.
“If that’s your only concern,” said Draco, “then—maybe he could come over this weekend? And you could see for yourself.”
the next morning.
“That’s classified,” said Harry.
“I’m just letting you know that I’m going to be bringing Draco’s muggle friends to St Mungo’s. Five of them.”
“Fun,” said Draco, and Harry realised he had said the wrong thing.
“It didn’t work,” said Harry. His eyes were painfully green. It didn’t matter how handsome Clarence was. No one would ever be more attractive than Harry, because he was Harry. “Connemara. I have no idea what happened last time, but I wandered around fucking rainy fields for weeks and
“Hi,” said Draco. “Is this all right?”
“You dear thing,” he said. “You have no idea how much I relate to that.”
“I don’t have any other children,” he said, with a panicked glance at Pansy. “Do I?”
c) Please, please don’t make me go back to Azkaban -
“You could read these?” asked Harry, surprised, because the insurance policy L had filled out included personal information. The Mysteries charm generally blanked out things like that, just as it prevented Harry from actually knowing what L looked like. Harry could see bits of him at times, when he was looking straight at him. He knew he had seen L’s eyes before, although he couldn’t remember them. They stared at each other enough, and sometimes, as Harry’s gaze flickered across L’s face, he felt as if he was on the verge of understanding something. But he never did. L’s features vanished like a dream the moment Harry looked away.
She looked him seriously in the eye.
“Hmm,” said Hermione. They were in the Mysteries Cafeteria. It was typical of the Department of Mysteries to be unable to produce anything so mundane as a normal cafeteria. Unspeakables ate in a terrifying nuclear bunker, and the food was magically designed to do things like increase bone growth and cell activity.
“Me too,” said L, in a low, solemn voice.
“How are you this thick, Draco? You
“You can fuck me occasionally, if you really need… a release,” said Draco stiffly.
“But you’re getting better?”
“You’ve been very quiet,” said Harry.
“It’s not as if he didn’t do anything to merit being there, Harry.”
“Oh,” he said, and he sounded, briefly, as if he was going to cry. “Oh, it hurts!”
“Fine. Just don’t write off his feelings as a syndrome.”
“But it
“Pansy! What the hell are you talking about?”
“Draco… you can’t think like that.”
“Oh,” said Harry. This hadn’t occurred to him. Watching Draco and Teddy had made Harry feel calmer than he had in a long, long time. There was something soothing about the way they clearly loved each other, despite all the good reasons for them not to. It was like a physical representation of post-war healing. It had sapped Harry of his anger.
And they did. It was easy. And Harry paid at the end of the meal, and walked Draco back to his flat.
“Right,” said Harry.
“How did you find me, anyway?” she asked.
“I know,” said Harry. “That’s the job.”
Harry nodded enthusiastically.
“Yeah,” said Ron. “He’s really good at chess!” he added defensively.
Harry shook his head. He remembered that last conversation he’d witnessed, remembered Michael, almost in tears, saying
“Right, yeah, I meant Draco?”
“No, Potter. Tell me, did anyone ever try to keep you a secret?”
“Saturday, sure,” said Draco, sounding slightly manic. “Don’t think I had any other plans, so I may as well just marry you.”
“I’m fine. I think maybe I need to put my head in a bucket of ice water.”
“I still see Dan and Haroun,” said Draco.
it’s so much more fun than
Draco laid his pen down on the table.
“Blond,” said Harry, without thinking. Malfoy laughed.
“Are you okay?” she asked him.
A heavy weight of sadness fell on Harry’s heart. It did that, sometimes, came down on him like a cloud.
“You can’t know someone, if you don’t understand what made them,” said Harry.
“I feel ridiculous, asking you to stay and watch me sleep,” said Draco. Harry bent down and kissed his temple.
“No,” said Harry. “I guess not. So what happens to them?”
Adelaide went to the mirror and stilled. Draco stood next to her. Their mirror images stared back at them, both blond and tall and slender. Neither of them spoke for a moment.
He was feeling low, so he was quiet as Harry, Ron and Hermione chatted and toasted crumpets on the fire using long iron prongs.
They could not stop smiling at each other. Draco had bought all the ingredients for her to make a chilli, and he sat in the kitchen as she cooked, occasionally reflecting on how strangely soothing it was to be happy with her, despite the Harry-shaped ache in his chest.
“I saw it in Brighton,” said Lucius. Harry laughed. He couldn’t help himself.
Harry laughed, but only for a moment. He wanted to explain to Draco about… he wasn’t sure about what. About redemption, maybe. Forgiveness.
“He doesn’t care,” said Adelaide, again. “Seriously, you just don’t get our relationship.”
There was only one solution, and that was to brazen it out. He would simply act as if everything was fine until people stopped looking at him. He felt reasonably sure that Potter would have the decency not to mock him about the kiss.
Draco gave him a shy smile.
“Like—a whim. A punchline. ‘Then I married my worst enemy, it was hilarious.’”
“I broke his heart,” said Harry.
Harry groaned and turned over on the bed, so that he lay on his stomach.
“Of course I give a fuck about you,” said Draco, quietly.
“I don’t pay rent on this, you know. Or tax. I inherited it.”
Ron looked tired.
“I did.”
“Mrs. Weasley’s invited us to the Burrow for Christmas dinner.”
Their lips touched softly, tingling and sensitive, so little needed—each movement huge because of the attention it commanded. Harry’s hands went to Draco’s back, but they moved slowly, and the pressure was so light, as if Draco was something peerless, that must be handled carefully or not at all. Draco, for his part, had his fingers in Harry’s dark hair, feeling the elegant curve of his skull, the strength of him, the wholeness.
“Are you?”
“Okay.”
“I have a bit of a bad track record,” said Draco. He paused. “I almost killed his best friend, once. Among other things.”
“How did it change?”
breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Wizards had long ago discovered an anti-cancer potion; it just needed to be taken every day for a prolonged period. If Malfoy had been caught giving it to a muggle, he would have been sent back to Azkaban in a heartbeat.
“Then he will hate you.”
“Oh, who cares,” said Draco. “You’re Harry Potter, they’ll get you any table you want. I want to fuck you while you wear this.”
Lamorak looked at him thoughtfully with his unsettling brown eyes. It made Harry uncomfortable.
“No. Fine. A drink.”
“You need to stop thinking about this,” said Blaise. “Yeah?”
Blaise stared at him.
Harry traced Draco’s profile with his index finger, and Draco blinked rapidly, the way he did when he was trying not to cry.
After they’d eaten, Ron and Hermione sat on either end of the sofa, Harry in between them. It felt purposefully engineered. They had both been on good form all through dinner, funny and easy and in love, apparently unperturbed by Harry’s quietness. But then, Harry was so often quiet.
Harry looked nonplussed.
He wondered whether Draco had gone to the pub quiz with Ron and Dean and Luna, as usual, or whether that only happened when Harry was there. It made him miserable to think that Draco was cut off from people because of Harry. In fairness, everything to do with Draco made him miserable.
Draco looked up.
. Everything is easy, compared to before.”
“I’ve done something that’s going to piss you off,” Harry told Draco, that afternoon. Draco was leaning against the kitchen counter as Harry filled the kettle.
“Is that why you agreed to take me?” asked Draco, trying to sound casual. But Harry saw through him.
“I haven’t done… they’re coming,” said Draco. “They’ve been informed.” He felt light-headed. Had he eaten that day? Maybe not. He had a habit of pushing meals later and later, until he was too tired to eat and just went to bed.
Harry drifted in and out of the story, which took a long time to tell, because the Slytherins kept interrupting. Draco had closed his eyes, a small smile on his face. Occasionally he frowned, clearly in pain. Each time this happened, Blaise or Pansy would kiss his head or squeeze his shoulders.
So Draco told her.
“Draco!” shouted Adelaide. “Stop hogging the broom, it’s my turn again!”
A nurse came in and told them they all had to clear out. Harry leant close to Draco and whispered.
“Bullshit,” he said.
Harry grinned.
“Look, Greg, come on, pull yourself together.”
Harry put a hand on the back of Draco’s neck and pulled him gently forward, so that their lips could touch. It was a delicate, soft little kiss. Draco tentatively responded, his hands going to rest on Harry’s ribs. Draco broke away first. People were cheering, but Harry barely noticed. He searched Draco’s face for a reaction.
“I can’t promise that. Maybe I can have, like, a monthly gift allotment or something.”
“He was so drunk that night, anyway,” said Ron, biting into a bagel. “I doubt he even felt it.”
“Why?”
“Shurrup!”
“I don’t understand,” he said. “
“I didn’t,” said Harry. “Not for most of it. He had no one except Pansy and Blaise, and he was starving and lonely and poor.”
Harry couldn’t flee the bathroom fast enough.
“Casanova!”
“You’re very good looking!” said Draco angrily, as if he was speaking to someone who had just insulted Harry, not Harry himself.
“You… James. That’s amazing. That’s great. I’m really happy for you.”
“He wasn’t wearing a
“She’s been acting perfectly normally around me. I bet she isn’t upset at all.”
Harry wondered how he could tell Draco he loved him without actually saying that he loved him.
“Good thinking,” said Pansy. “Doesn’t Andromeda have a kid?”
“Who? Malfoy? Which one?”
Draco finally managed to jerk his hands away and buried his face in them. Harry was seized by a sudden uncertainty.
“He really likes you.”
“Draco. I’ve literally paid money to see you naked before. I don’t care about your Mark.”
“Surprised to see me alive, Granger?”
to me. That doesn’t mean…”
“Yeah, and then I kissed you, and it felt pretty fucking clear, actually!”
He touched Draco’s shoulder, gently guiding him back to rest against his chest.
“Everything all right with your dad?” asked Harry, as he passed Malfoy the water. Malfoy didn’t meet his eyes.
lifestyle? I’m wearing second hand pants.”
“But a choice, all the same.”
Harry shrugged. Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, and Hermione changed the subject.
“Oh,” said Harry, and laughed. It was a surprised sort of laughter. Draco smiled at his knees.
“Potter. Don’t be so unbearably
Draco lifted his eyes to the ceiling.
“It would make me feel better if you kept it,” said Harry.
“Don’t be. Just get some sleep.”
It had been consistently strange seeing his friends’ memories. One of the peculiarities of the process was that the memories tended to begin a little before Harry entered them, and end after he had left. With Ron and Hermione, this had meant watching them make out with each other more than was ideal.
He hadn’t meant to say that. He chewed on his lip, embarrassed.
“It’s okay. Stay.”
“What do you mean,
“Yes,” said Harry, wrapping an arm around Malfoy’s waist.
Harry tried to follow what he was saying, but it was hard, because his stomach ached. Different parts of his body were always hurting, and he had given up trying to figure out why. It was probably all psychological, anyway, which made him feel stupid.
“No,” said Blaise. “You’re being crazy.”
you.”
“A bit,” said Ron. “Not really. It’s tiny mental breakdowns. Say you have thought damage, and you think, I’m bad at my job. That leads you straight into
“Yeah,” Draco had answered.
Hermione was visibly pregnant.
“Obviously it was stupid. And not true. What that person said.”
“Are you sure you’re ready to go back to St Mungo’s?” asked Pansy.
“I’m not ratting out Draco’s feelings,” said Ginny. “But he’s definitely not in love with Steven Hodges. Whenever Steven’s name comes up, Draco closes up completely. I don’t think he even likes him very much.”
” said Draco.
“But why didn’t Draco tell us this before?” asked Nick.
“Don’t look at me,” said Steven. “I didn’t hear it.”
“So you don’t care about Malfoy dying,” he said, “except on a conceptual level.”
“I wish I could hate him,” said Harry. “But honestly, if he treats Draco right, I can’t.”
“He likes you because he can help you,” she said. “And Ron told me what you said at his trial; you called him
“They’ll have me killed,” said Draco.
“No,” said Harry. “Thank you for telling me that much.”
He worked for hours on that hair potion, hours and hours. He expanded his research, looked into Muggle chemicals, into keratin conditioners and silicon treatments and moisturising oils to counter the stripping agents of the potion. When Adelaide washed it out in the bath—Draco holding the shower head, as he always did, and drying her with his wand when she was done—his hard work was immediately apparent. Adelaide’s hair was soft, healthy, icily blond. It looked
“I’ll go to bed,” said Draco, starting to sit up. Harry snatched his wrist.
“You… what?”
Astoria put her hand to her head, apparently trying to steady herself.
Draco didn’t know how to answer that. Distantly, he knew that wasn’t really how blame worked, but he couldn’t deny that his actions had led to Adelaide’s broken arm.
“Please,” said Draco. It sounded like a warning.
“What if he dies?” he asked.
for a little longer, and he could worry about everything else later.
little secret?” repeated Draco in astonishment.
“Oh, it was terrible. Absolute nightmare, and I’m never going again. They had all these men in cloaks and masks? I must have seen at least three. And people were paying them to take pictures.”
Harry would have been concerned about the Statute of Secrecy, except that Malfoy had clearly accurately judged the level of drunkenness of the club patrons. No one blinked an eye at their sudden appearance.
“It’s good,” she said. “Tricky for us, because we don’t understand about muggle religion. But beautiful writing. Do you read much?”
“Slime,” said Teddy. “You make it with glue; it’s a muggle thing.”
“You’re dying?”
“Yeah,” said Draco, roughly.
open.”
“That’s all right, you don’t need to tell me. I know. Harry Potter will come to the rescue. I’m grateful, honestly, I am. I want to claw my eyes out when I look at you, but I’m grateful.”
“The bond uses the cruciatus curse as a fail-safe. It’s to prevent disobedience.”
“Draco. You’re
“I live with him,” said Draco. Potter made a cruel, scoffing noise.
“Might I enquire how long you anticipate this
“He’s been taking ecstasy all night long at underground warehouse raves!”
“Sure as the seashore. I’m sorry for waking you up; new place, that’s all. I’ll sleep better tomorrow.”
But Malfoy had already gone.
, though.”
The next wobble took him by surprise, and he called Blaise first.
“I’ll make it good.”
Draco turned around.
Eve’s eyes flashed dangerously.
“You do this to me all the time, so I’m going to assume it’s okay,” he said, then kissed the top of Harry’s head.
“Timothy…”
“So. Spill. What was he really like?”
“It’s nice to see you,” she told him.
He lingered near the snacks table, wondering when Malfoy would appear. Although, maybe he didn’t come to events like this, where no one was swinging from a chandelier. But no—there was Michael Corner, in the shadows near the bathroom, looking fucking miserable, actually.
“Oh,” said Draco blankly. Somehow this hadn’t occurred to him, despite the handcuffs. “But I didn’t do anything.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Look! They have the latest one in the series!”
“I’ve enjoyed the holidays,” said Harry.
“Good,” he said. “Let’s keep doing this, then.”
“She doesn’t want for anything,” said Draco. Potter made a disbelieving sound, but didn’t speak. Draco waited another few seconds at the door, then left.
brave.” His face grew serious. “I understand if you don’t want Teddy to get any more attached, but I had to make sure that you and my mother—” his voice broke. “I don’t want her to be… alone… she doesn’t know yet…”
“Malfoy still wants to kill you,” said Ron, checking for a curse spell in the index of
“It’s no fun doing this with you, because you know them all,” he said.
“Try saying how you feel,” suggested Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry. He tightened his grip on Draco’s arm. “Like. Joy, maybe.”
Malfoy hesitated, then nodded. He drank the rest of the potion with a grimace.
“Yes,” said Steven. “You’re madly in love with me. I’m just using you. That’s what I’ll be telling people, anyway. You have to go along with it.”
Sometimes, Harry flirted as himself. Sometimes he was glamoured or polyjuiced. Sometimes, he didn’t flirt at all, but stared seriously into their eyes and made them feel important.
“And he treats her well?” asked Blaise.
“You can’t control how other people feel about you, Draco.”
“He was let out of Azkaban four months early. Good behaviour. Only Astoria was never very organised; she missed the letter with his release date, so he got out—wandless; that was one of the stipulations; a year with no magic— and she and Scorpius were still in France. His parents were dead, of course. He was allowed to send one short-distance owl. He asked me if he could crash on my couch. I said no.”
“You know where Draco is,” said the woman, and as she spoke she leant into their table, so that light fell across her face. Her small, pug-like face. It was Pansy Parkinson.
“Morning,” said Draco.
Pansy: Fine! I’ll admit it! I already made you an account on the Sugar Daddy website, and you’ve had twelve requests since Wednesday.
But Blaise reacted quite unpredictably to Draco’s words. His eyebrows drew sorrowfully together.
Ron shrugged.
“Is this meal solely vegetables, or is there to be some sort of carbohydrate?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, and Draco’s smile widened. So they were housemates.
Draco smiled.
“Hang on,” said Harry. “You never spoke to Neville about your parents?”
“Draco. I shouldn’t have said it today, okay? I didn’t mean to.”
“Two years,” he said.
“You didn’t get me any meat,” said Draco, balancing the plate on his knees. He had put his shirt back on, so that Potter wouldn’t have to look at his arm.
“I can’t be happy,” said Draco, distracted, because his mother was making a strange hissing sound, and he was suddenly aware that she reminded him almost as much of a dementor as of his mother; with her greying, rotting skin, and the chilling doom she evoked. “I can’t—Harry, you don’t
“I love you,” he said, urgently.
“Really? I’m impressed.”
“Well, shit,” said Seven.
your dad do?”
One of the knots in Draco’s mind was to do with organ donation. He always came back to that idea, and although he would remember that Blaise had talked him out of it before, he would find himself entirely unable to recreate the argument himself.
“Dobby!”
“I don’t want to go! Please don’t make me!”
“I wanted to talk to you about the war
did. Father always made sure I ate first,” said Cassie, glaring at Ron. “Spoiled me rotten. Such a bad parent. But then, he
“You think this is like that?”
“He didn’t technically tell us, Ron,” she said. “He just talked about Cedric’s hair in a way that made his proclivities apparent.”
Harry nodded. Malfoy tipped his head and smiled.
“Yeah.”
“That sounds interesting.”
“I read that Skeeter article about your childhood. I thought it was a load of bollocks,” he said.
“It’s dark magic,” said Spooner. “And Malfoy’s missing from his cell.”
“Forgive me, won’t you?”
“English breakfast,” said Potter. “Who told you the story?”
“Yeah, and it turns out if there’s no one pushing me I’m a total fucking waste of space; I know, Malfoy.”
. So all Harry said was,
“You liked me so much more as Lamorak,” said Draco sadly.
A dozen rounds later, Harry was crying with laughter, and Draco was still warm across his chest.
Draco made the teas in silence. He didn’t drink his. He fell asleep at the kitchen table, his head in his arms.
For eleven years, people had pitied or admired him, but no one had depended on him. Without that steadying pressure, he had felt himself grow slack and rudderless.
Draco looked up sharply.
“That must be hard for you. I know how you like to be liked,” said Kevin.
“That is so kind, Parvati,” he said, laying down his knife and fork to fix her with an expression of sickly sincerity. “There’s… something about you… you know, it’s difficult for me to talk about my feelings, because of my relationship with my father.”
How the hell was Harry supposed to think about anything else ever again, now that he knew
“I don’t know, someone a bit more… pampered.”
“No, no,” said Harry, making himself comfortable against his pillows. “What’s going on? Are you okay?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry. “I wish I did.”
“People will be angry if they find out he worked at the Ministry. You know that’s not technically legal. We had to pull quite a few strings.”
The worst of it was that Harry was
“What?”
“List all the Latin phrases you know,” said Blaise.
Malfoy laughed
“You bought me a shop,” he said, finally.
“No,” said Harry. “I don’t think that. You’ve been through hell, we all have, of course you’re not over it. No one expects you to be.”
Greg seemed to crumble. He sank to his bed and put his head in hands.
these episodes were only temporary. He soon found he could sleep through the night without waking himself with dreams, and he got hungry at mealtimes again, and stopped crying at unpredictable moments throughout the day. It was easier to be alive.
Harry winced at his notes. Of course Malfoy was bored. He was with
Harry perked up.
“St Patrick’s Day gig,” he said, when he caught Harry looking. “Walk?”
“I love you,” said Draco, without looking up.
After about fifteen minutes, there was a knock on his door. He opened it to see Draco, still looking rather unwell. Dean had gone.
Adelaide looked at him with interest.
“Luna give that to you?” asked Harry.
“You dear old thing; aren’t you a sight for sore eyes. I’m so comfortable, would you fetch us a round of gin and tonics?” His nose dipped close to Draco’s face. Draco turned to look at him with easy intimacy. “You’ll have one, won’t you, darling?”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He didn’t like to bring it up.
“Draco, wait,” said Harry, jumping up to follow him. He didn’t even know what he wanted to say, only that he didn’t want Draco going off, drunk and alone and embarrassed. But Draco didn’t wait, of course. He was halfway down the corridor when Harry caught up with him. Harry grabbed his upper arm.
They were in an empty classroom. Harry and Ron were seated together on the professor’s desk at the front of the room, discreetly playing a game of hangman while Hermione monologued. Draco supposed they didn’t need to listen. It was quite clear that if any potion was to be brewed, it would not be Harry and Ron doing it.
Harry thought about Draco’s quiet reserve. Remembered how Draco had treated Harry before they were friends, like a teenager who didn’t want to disappoint anyone.
“Slytherins aren’t all bad,” said Harry, somewhat defensively.
“Hermione,” said Harry. “It’s okay. I’ll sort it out. You know I will. Just leave it with me, okay?”
“Then let’s make him jealous,” said the guy, and kissed Harry.
“Yeah, I, uh, I’ve just got a headache.”
“I thought Ginny cheated on me once, but actually she hadn’t,” said Harry, then winced. God, had he really said that? Malfoy was looking at him with a puzzled frown.
Cassie turned on her heel.
He was sure he wasn’t imagining the brief look of sadness that crossed her face.
“What?”
“Well, I
“I can’t tell you,” said Harry, dragging his eyes away from Draco’s mouth, “or it won’t come true.”
Draco pulled his hands into the sleeves of his jumper.
“So, James, talk to me,” said Malfoy, with a flirtatious smile. “What makes you tick?”
“You have no idea,” said Harry. “You have no idea how much I need you.”
“Have you got a broom she could borrow?” he asked, as Harry bustled around the kitchen, getting them glasses of lemonade.
“Probably,” agreed Harry. “Are you okay?”
The castle emptied over the holidays. Families wanted to be together, after the war. This was not, of course, an issue Draco had to worry about.
He stormed through the castle corridors, trying to outrun his thoughts, which tumbled after him like a poisonous flood, furious, endless, relentless, incurable. He didn’t want to die— did any suicide? But he wanted peace. He wanted it so badly he could taste it.
In the Easter holidays, Draco’s sentence was officially ended and his assets returned to him. The first thing he did was go to Diagon Alley with Ginny. Harry didn’t even ask to go with them. The more time Draco spent with Ginny and Luna, the steadier he became; the less prone to unpredictable bouts of silent gloom.
Draco stared at him, then slowly, purposefully, rolled up his sleeves. The Dark Mark bruised across his forearm. It provoked a visceral reaction in Harry, like seeing maggots seething in a dead body. He flinched and looked away.
Harry looked at him in surprise.
“I showed you my scar on purpose,” she said.
“It was a
Draco glanced at him. Harry looked so real, standing in the snow next to Hermione’s ridiculous sleigh.
“That howler was being sent by a very sad, angry woman,” said Misty. “Master Draco must not listen to her.”
“Always,” said Harry.
“I already ate,” said Harry.
“I’m doing what I think is right for you. You’ll thank me when you’re older.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I am.”
a) Please don’t make me go back to Azkaban -
Harry wanted to ask more, but Draco has closed his eyes and fallen asleep.
“No, it’s on the fifth floor, by the Auror training rooms. He’ll be comfortable. And he should get his trial within a couple of weeks. If he’s innocent, like you say, you’ll have your dad back in no time.”
“Harry Potter,” said Potter, holding out a hand to be shaken.
“You were such a twat about Norbert.”
he reminded himself.
“Yes. I… I’m sorry we didn’t meet earlier. That was a mistake.”
It was a devastatingly lonely prospect.
him,” said Harry.
Ron sent out three patronuses as Hermione handed out the trackers, and Harry explained the protocol for if they found anything. Luna, Dean, Michael and Susan arrived halfway through his explanation, and he had to begin again.
“I wasn’t going to invite him for
Something was trying to get into his head. Harry could ignore it. But it felt bad to ignore it.
“Harry,
“You just don’t know me well enough,” he said. “I’ve—I’ve manipulated you into liking me.”
“I know,” said Harry. “I’m just glad.”
“Can’t you just let him be happy?” asked Ron. Harry wondered when it was that Ron had learned to get defensive about Draco.
“No, wait, I think I can—” Draco paced to the window and back. “It’s connection.”
They were at Ron and Hermione’s flat, and Harry had just told them about his disastrous attempt to break off Draco’s wedding.
“Master Draco,” said Kreacher. It had been such a long time since anyone spoke to him with respect.
Blaise frowned.
If Cassie were there, she would have flicked a rubber band at Harry by now, because he was definitely playing with his food. He didn’t want to meet Hermione’s eyes.
of you,” he said, “that I shouldn’t have been able to see. It’s like…”
“All right,” he said. “So you really did fall for me. You also sought me out with the deliberate intention to humiliate me. You deceived me for months. You abandoned me with fucking
“Answer me!” said Steven, his voice pitching desperately. Draco took a step backwards. He knew how this went.
Harry was too tired to answer. He took Draco’s hand in his and squeezed. Draco squeezed back, and Harry knew he understood.
“It’s complicated,” said Neville.
They made up. They always did. They loved each other and respected each other and fought with kindness. But he knew she was still sad, and she knew he was still somewhere else in his head.
“Draco’s had a hard time, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, and that made sense, to a degree; that Mrs. Weasley would pity Malfoy enough to overcome her repugnance.
“Potter.” Draco stepped away from him, creating space between their bodies. “You’re just horny.”
“Do you often get high by yourself, Pansy?” asked Harry, filling a glass with ice and giving it to her. She picked up a wedge of ice and put it down the front of her top.
“She threatened no dessert for a week.”
“—because you’re scared of me?”
“I is not liking to think of it, sir,” she said.
“Ow, for fuck’s sake, Potter!”
Draco stared at her. Her voice was calm, and he understood it. It made sense to him. He could feel his mind groping along the train of her words, a thread that led out of the maze.
“What? I’m what?” asked Harry.
Harry’s face seemed oddly cold.
Misty laughed, then stopped suddenly, looking panicked.
Draco stared at him some more.
And Draco wasn’t picking up his phone.
“It’s just a slowing down,” he said, zipping up his wash kit. He didn’t really believe it. He and Harry hadn’t talked about what would happen when Adelaide came back, beyond vague and miserable mentions of things that could not continue. It wasn’t very clear whether it was a break-up, or something else. However much Draco had said it was just a slowing down, he had no illusions. Harry wanted to wait
“So—he can come on Saturday? Just so that you can—so you can see that he’s—and if you still don’t trust him then that’s fine, like I said, I don’t want to make things difficult for you, I’m so happy you’re back.”
Where before Harry’s life had been empty, it was suddenly bursting. Not only was his job intense and satisfying, but his social life had taken off. Most nights, when Harry came home, Draco and the Slytherins were already there, drinking his beer and eating his food. Of course, they didn’t need to meet in Harry’s flat, because there was no call for secrecy anymore. But neither Harry nor Draco mentioned this, and Harry grew used to the sight of Pansy Parkinson sprawled across his sofa, to the smell of Blaise’s French cooking, and the strange habit Daphne had of tidying everything.
“No,” said Ron, who had finally found his muggle wallet. “I got you, mate!”
But Drunk Harry had no compunction, apparently, about swaying over to where Draco was sprawled on the floor on a pile of cushions, and plopping himself next to him.
“Because—well—I don’t know, it probably just… won’t,” said Draco.
“No, you’re right, I’m reading into things,” said Ginny. “This is all totally normal.”
“Well, I suppose it will pass the time. Go on then. What’s my first lesson?”
You can find me on Instagram and (newly) Twitter at @let_them_eat_books if you're interested in seeing the books I've been getting excited about lately!
“I’m not in a hurry,” said Draco. “I’m just getting out of your hair.”
“That’s terrible,” she said evenly. “I didn’t know you felt that way.”
The chocolate warded away the clinging, icy misery for almost twenty minutes. As he ate, he remembered that he would get out one day, and there would be trees, and sunrises, and wide open skies, even if there was nothing else. He thought, then, of Potter’s strong reaction to Dementors in school. He wondered if Potter had known what effect the chocolate would have. It was kind of Potter, if so—it was kind either way.
Misty found him in the library.
“Harry,” said Kingsley. “What a wonderful surprise—”
“Are you okay?”
Draco closed his eyes.
When Harry smiled at Draco the next morning at breakfast, Draco didn’t smile back. He just made a sort of sneering, confused face and looked away. But Harry wasn’t discouraged. The fact was, Draco had been
“Listen to me,” said Harry, ignoring what he knew was a pretty fair point. “We get married, and the whole narrative changes. I don’t want you to be a pariah your whole life, and Cassie sure as hell doesn’t either.”
“You can’t train cats,” said Harry. Pansy gave him a disdainful look.
Hermione nodded.
, and
Hermione and Ron staged an intervention, at one point; or tried to.
They have been here a while already, and have been making easy conversation about a variety of topics, but primarily the things they miss about Muggle life. It is in the fact that Justin spends so little of his energy, is so full of comments himself that he doesn’t expect much from Harry, that Harry finds endless pleasure. Harry has already expressed his adoration for the TV, and Justin has been recommending him films to watch. So far in his short life, the extent of his movie knowledge stretches to the
And Harry? He wants to jump up in celebration, fist pump the air and scream with relief. A bubble of laughter rises in him- he feels almost hysterical at how refreshing it is to have the boy he once knew become real again.
hi guys... im really sorry ive been MIA for over a month (i'll be adding some more detail on me personally in the end notes), i hope you enjoy this! its about 7k and took me a while because i felt like it was quite important? harry and draco have quite a significant exchange in this! this will be a turning point! (By the way i have a proper plot for this planned,, thats why im setting up so many things with draco (the letter, the potion making, the spell he was practising) but it is just taking ages to build! hope you dont mind slow builds! im worried everyone has forgotten what i have already written so i will try my best to reference back to the events in the book as reminders to everyone!xxxx
It is almost cathartic.
Harry keeps quiet, mostly from having nothing to contribute, and partly because his head is still spinning. Suddenly, as if he hasn’t spent the last month being as stoic as possible, Malfoy speaks again in the middle of the silence. “I won’t ask you if you are alright, Potter, so don’t expect me to.”
And he doesn’t know how, or why, but the atmosphere shifts. It is only by a couple of centimetres, but Justin definitely moves closer. The air in the room has turned thick and oppressive; he begins to sweat a little, despite the Autumn chill.
“A sleeping potion? Like Dreamless Sleep?” asks Harry curiously and with a shudder. He has come very close to developing an addiction to the substance in the past few months. On those nights where the flashbacks and fear just won’t stop flooding through the gates, he feels like Eve must have done with the Apple upon seeing the potion glimmering in his bathroom cabinet. It is a dangerous game, but oh so worth it.
“And thank Merlin it doesn’t,” grumbles Anthony. “Answer it, Harry, for fucks sake.”
Until it fucks you up forever, as Hermione had shown him. She had taken him to St Mungo’s Rehabilitation Ward with tears in her eyes after finding him unconscious on the bathroom floor, refusing to wake up even with the use of spells. The people there had shocked him back into reality, thank god. Even in the mess of a state he was in, he could still recognise how frightened the idea of a future like this made him.
The stairs creak and the mirage is shattered. It is like a switch has been flicked when Malfoy’s head whips around, clearly nervous, checking whether anyone has caught them in the act. And by
For a moment, Harry has no clue what he is talking about. He has been so absorbed in his own humiliation that he altogether forgot that he has been made even more of a fool by the fact that he is sodden in gold glitter. Well, he could not have made a worse off-the-cuff decision if he had tried. As his favourite morning-mirror-pep-talk goes,
He glances back just to check that Ron and Hermione aren’t watching him incredulously, but he needn’t worry- they are absorbed in each other. From the way that Hermione moves her hands passionately across the papers and Ron stares at her with a dopey smile sitting on his lips, Harry knows that Hermione is trying to tell Ron about whatever it is she is working on. He also knows that Ron isn’t listening in the slightest.
had he known that he had an audience.
“So, are you, uh, coming to lesson?” Ron hesitates, allowing space for the answer that Harry never gives, “‘Mione, and me as well, think it’s probably a good idea- considering it’s the first one of the year, and all that. I don’t think Mcgonagall would be very happy if we missed it.” Harry appreciates the solidarity from Ron in the implication that he would, however grudgingly, miss the lesson with him should Harry wish it.
“Delightful,” drawls an unexpected voice from behind him.
“Alright, alright, ‘Mione,” says Ron lightheartedly, which juxtaposes Harry’s own mood in stark contrast, “Give a man a second to get settled again.”
“Just... just-”
See- complicated.
hangs heavy in his mouth.
In a strangely contemplative mood, Harry flexes his fingers and burrows his body down into the bed’s warmth. He revels in the sensations, allowing them to flow through him, reminding him of his presence.
Speaking of rich bastards, he notices with discomfort another one on the opposite side of the room. He hasn’t said anything as of yet, hasn’t bothered to open that pretentious mouth of his- as if he would- but Harry knows that he is awake. How, you might ask?
Of course, Malfoy could still be hatching an evil plan for all Harry truly knows. In a moment of sudden realisation, Harry contemplates why he thinks he could ever foresee Malfoy’s actions again when all the dickhead has done is surprise him ever since they got back to Hogwarts.
“As if he could, with that massive bloody bruise,” chuckles Ron, “No clue why he doesn’t fix it up. For a Pure-blood, he's not great at using his wand, is he?” And Harry ponders about whether he should give back Malfoy's wand- his proper one- which is dusting away in a trunk at Grimmauld Place. He thinks he might have seen Kreacher crying, fondling it- probably at the sight of something new from the Black family line. Everything in that house has lived at least two hundred years, he is certain .
“I see,” she says, concerned. As she scans Malfoy’s sapless form, she seems to come to a conclusion. “I don’t want to risk moving him until Poppy has arrived. It could do more harm than good in his fragile state. Whatever that abhorrent substance was, I removed the majority of it, but there is no telling what havoc it has already managed to wreak on his body.” Harry nods in agreement and she stands up abruptly.
Harry peers at Hermione sitting opposite him, knowing from the scrutiny on her face that she is already making calculations in her mind as to what Mcgonagall might be about to say.
“What?” he asks as innocently as he can, but he thinks that his weak voice betrays him.
Oh. That’s right. Harry’s treasonous subconscious.
The next day finds Harry in Mcgonagall’s office. He had completely forgotten during the events of the previous day, but each Eighth year student has been called for a meeting, relating to careers and their dreadful ‘future prospects’. During the walk to breakfast, Ron, whose hair has nearly all grown back, was so nervous for his own that he began referring to Fred in the present tense. He had drawn back from the group upon realisation, clearly distraught by his own mistake. Hermione and Harry had been unsure what to do but were about to intervene nonetheless, when a whirlwind of red spared them the effort. Squeezing his shoulders and ruffling his hair, as if Ron were the younger sibling, Ginny managed to pep him back up.
Harry squirms and wipes his hands on his trousers. “Definitely,” he replies, not breaking eye contact.
- complete with comically large cartoonish eyes and a spiky tail. He cannot believe it. Wonders truly never cease.
Once downstairs, he assembles the items he needs to take with him. He grabs his robes from where Hermione had set them out as a reminder the day prior. She seemed to be fretting that he might turn up in his carrot orange Chudley Cannon pyjamas. Seamus would have a field day.
“Who is in your dorm then, ‘Mione?” Harry asks, trying to bring his attention to more important matters than his upcoming death.
Malfoy just looks him up and down in assessment, seemingly unimpressed, before rolling his grey eyes and turning over. Harry stands dumbfounded at this rejection until it appears Malfoy has fallen asleep, breathing quiet but repetitive fucking sounds that make Harry want to throw him in the Black Lake. He’d fit in there. The Merfolk are an ugly bunch too.
harry settles into dorm life.. kinda
“For sure, I would’ve asked for at least three bands,” Harry says, light-heartedly, and he receives a laugh in response. It is a bit too melancholy to be a complete victory, but he allows himself to feel the slightest bit chuffed for managing to put the tears on hold, at least. Then, he looks at Justin’s trembling lips and a wave of guilt envelops him for being happy at someone else's grief.
physically in second year.
“Nothing. Some of us are just trying to pass our NEWTs.”
A group of young teenagers walk past and upon regarding something, presumably him, they start to giggle. Only a select few are polite enough to stifle their laughter and even then, it is only once they see who he is. He sighs, resigned and fed up with the day.
A heart bubble floats over from where the couple are still celebrating. It hovers above him and he stares at it for several moments, not expecting to feel so oddly touched by how close he has been permitted to get to this display of love. It is a rosy colour and glows ever so slightly, so that when Harry reaches up his hand to touch it, it leaves a blushing hue on his brown skin. Like an idiot, he gives it a prod and it disappears with a loud
“I didn’t ask you to. You don’t need to, I mean,” Malfoy begins to speak, looking ahead at nothing. He is emphatic when he talks, the intent behind his word lands a punch with every syllable. “Some people might think it a blessing to be saved by you, but I see it more as a curse.”
He turns the cover and reads the small description on the front page.
He turns around to face him, somehow feeling alright about the situation. Distractions are welcome. Perhaps his legs knew where they were taking him, working where his mind couldn’t. Often, Harry wonders if his body has had to grow a new brain to make up for the fact that the original one has gone off the rails.
As he travels through his newfound passages, he wonders why Malfoy is in the Astronomy Tower of all places. These days, it pretty much has no function. Mcgonagall decided that lessons there wouldn’t continue, out of respect for Dumbledore. There are plenty of other towers available in the castle anyway, ones which don’t have associations with murdered headmasters. Formally, you can go up there upon request. However, it has become, despite Mcgonagall’s efforts to keep it bordered off, Hogwarts’s newest snogging spot.
Far below, he sees where it landed.
wand, it’s-
“My Father wasn’t happy, obviously, and that is a gross understatement. He kicked me out. Mother was upset too but I could tell she didn’t agree with his decision,” says Justin morosely, in that slightly snooty way which only exists in those with wealthy upbringings. Like Malfoy. Harry laughs under his breath darkly when he realises how aghast Malfoy would be to have something in common with a Muggleborn. He wonders whether they have anything else in common, like an adoration for soft toys.
A hazy memory- one which feels elusive, even eternal. Standing with his soles buried in the sand, the waves licking at his toes, a salty breeze fresh on his cheeks, he looks upon the sea. He realises that he could search every corner of the ocean, could spend years crawling the seabed, and she would still never completely trust him with all her secrets. She would simply change the tide, maybe invoke a storm that creates whole new caverns, and it would all change.
He remembers Malfoy’s dragon and a little life gets breathed back into him again as he huffs a laugh. Watching Malfoy in his peripheral vision, he collects his soup-soaked spoon from the bowl and begins to eat. Hermione seems satisfied, if the loss of her gaze is any indication. The meal is enjoyable, but Harry’s mind cannot settle, for it is suddenly rampant with curiosity for the boy that has become a stranger.
Harry plays along, “That checks out then. Filch is...um... extremely hot.” His mouth feels dirty after saying it, and he scours the ground in case some water magically comes to him.
It is the echo of Malfoy’s voice in his head,
, as you might gather. He can’t catch a break.
They search around for some free seats and Ron heads over to the bar. Fortunately, they manage to find a booth in a backroom, where the crowds of people are less hectic. Rather than numerous groups of young adults, drunk and booming, they are greeted by what appears to be a knitting group and some elderly men playing a card game. Harry breathes a little easier. From the corner, a lone wizard with hair so untamed it looks like it wrestled a bear- and lost- smiles at him and he returns the gesture.
“Good for you,” Malfoy says indifferently, the picture of stoicity.
Not taking his eyes off of Malfoy’s breathing pattern- the only thing holding him together- he wandlessly casts a Warming Charm. It spreads to them both slowly, but him first. With Malfoy, it takes longer, so much so that Harry begins to question if it is actually doing anything. He wouldn’t be surprised to find that Malfoys can't get warm- that this temperature is depressingly his perpetual coldness. But, remembering the Astronomy Tower, and the heat against the edge of his body as Malfoy had stood beside him, he knows that this isn’t true. It feels like a secret.
As if one day without answers wasn’t enough, it rolls onto the next, and then the next. Another. Another. Hermione and Ron get distracted by a new trip that they are planning to take in the holidays, and soon they forget to check up on Harry so often. He reflects once more on how pathetic he is when left to his own devices. They are thinking of going to visit Charlie in Romania, and then touring the country a bit. Ron is practically bursting with excitement, and as much as Harry would like to believe it has something to do with seeing his absent brother, he cringes and resigns himself to the fact that it is probably more about the empty tent and enlarged double bed. Better than a broom cupboard, for sure.
On a normal day, he would most likely hate the contact; it would suffocate him, make him panic. But today is proving to be far from normal, and Hermione’s earl grey scent is strong enough to ground him in the moment. Instead, he feels safer than ever. It is different, but welcome. Hagrid’s hugs, for that matter, have such a nostalgic distinctiveness in his height and warm grasp, that even Harry couldn’t possibly find it in him to associate it with anything frightening.
Malfoy is climbing out the bed, suddenly fully dressed despite never having left the spot to collect any clothes. Harry hasn’t heard a single shuffle, rustle or breath, either. Since yesterday’s incident, since Malfoy snapped at Harry- the first real sign of, well,
“I didn’t mean to come here. I just...uh,” Harry fumbles for the right words, “ended up here, I guess. By chance.”
The walk back is silent, neither of them say a single word. There is no need, and frankly, Harry appreciates the space. It isn’t exactly friendly, but it is accepting. Between them is at least a metre, and Harry finds himself forgetting that Malfoy is there at times, with how quietly the boy treads. His walk is elegant and pacy, like the ground is coming up to meet his every step. Running alongside him, Harry has less gentility than a troll. He lumbers as fast as possible, determined to get the better of his fatigue tonight and to match the speed. Before now, he had never noticed how long Malfoy’s legs are, but then he supposes that he didn’t have any opportunities to walk besides him. Now it is all he can bloody think about; he laments his own stubby ones as Malfoy strides forward. Until they reach the common room, they stay like this. Blaise Zabini ruins it.
“Yeah, I don’t know. She seems to really like coming. And I like her coming” If Harry wasn’t becoming steadily more insane by the day, he could have sworn Ginny was blushing. A flushed pink is spreading across her face, reaching her ears. Interesting.
He imagines the clicking of cameras as the team dismantles their brooms, the roaring of the crowds, like Fiendfyre. All around him are hundreds of hands and arms, grabbing for a piece of him, just so they can say that they have touched Harry Potter. He would practically be offering himself up on a platter, a fat suckling pig ready for the taking.
The looseness of the gown means that it has slipped even further; Harry swallows. Odd- his throat feels dry.
Hermione grunts and narrows her eyes, but pats him on the knee as a demonstration of understanding before turning to Harry, “What about you, Harry? That was awful for us but I imagine even more horrific for you. Did anyone hurt you?” She scans worriedly up and down Harry’s body.
It sounds harsh and ill-meaning against Neville’s kind words, and Harry curses himself for his ineptitude with social skills. They both share an uneasy chuckle, and he suspects neither of them find anything especially amusing in the recycled joke.
He also doesn’t want to think about the time bomb ticking away inside his body- loaded, wedged tightly into his skin. Every moment it counts down the seconds till his next anxiety wave in excruciating punches to the gut, which Harry feels each time with heavy dread.
“Not in the slightest,” argues Malfoy, but he is losing steam.
It is when he is rubbing his eyes, trying to assure himself that he did not just see Dean on his knees,
Afterwards, they wander down the street aimlessly. He picks up on the dilemma between Ron and Ginny of wanting to visit Weasley’s Wizard wheezes, in all its chaotic glory, but not wishing to see the place that Fred put his whole heart and soul into without him there. Hermione makes the decision for them to instead purchase some lunch in Muggle London, the animated nature of Diagon beginning to affect her too. Glancing at each of them, he notices a slightly sallow pallor to all of their faces, and he can only imagine at the horror that is most probably his current appearance. There’s a sense of relaxation at Hermione’s words, and they all set off.
“Four AM,” retorts Harry smartly, and Malfoy’s top lip twitches and quivers. Harry could be wrong here, but it looks like he is fighting amusement. It is a rather odd gesture on someone who still has the air of a spooked lamb. He wants to ask whether Malfoy is actually changing rooms, but practises restraint.
He loves it, the freedom. It is infectious. Maybe- it is only a small chance, but just maybe, it could help him to stop regarding the place as his prison.
“You do exactly the fucking same. If you’re going to call me a hypocrite, at least realise the irony in the statement first,” says Malfoy and Harry wonders if they always knew each other this well. Ron and Hermione would never dare to speak to him like this these days, though he deserves it almost all the time- he has heard them discuss his ‘fragility’ before.
Before the war, he would have answered Mcgonagall “Yes” with absolute certainty, though debatably that was purely from a lack of other options. He had had a drive in him then, a drastic need to prove himself the saviour everyone assumed, demanded him to be. Because, although he had liked to pretend he wasn’t special, there was a
She has papers strewn everywhere on the desk, and he has no clue what she is even working on. From the looks of it, it has transcended homework and has perhaps entered another realm completely. Rooming with Ravenclaws has been good for her in a lot of aspects, Harry knows; they provide her with the intellectual discussion that he and Ron have never been able to give to her. However, as he eyes the obscene spread of work, he has to admit he feels a little afraid. It looks like it could eat him alive; Hermione looks like she already has been.
“Why?” responds Malfoy, a warning flashing in his eyes, “What is it to you? Are you here to gloat?”
Harry sits in the living room of Grimmauld Place, alone, empty and drinking a cup of tea. The rain trickles faintly down the window pane next to him, the noise of it soothing the headache that was growing with the evening. His tea is a dark brown, not quite comparable to burnt toast but somewhere close, he thinks- builders, as the Muggles call it.
. Harry has no fucking clue where he heard that but it seems appropriate in this moment.
Hermione rolls her eyes. Harry agrees.
“Not at all, Erin. Not at all. So how are you?” he offers as a change of subject.
“Yeah.”
The following silence eats up his thumping pulse, the only noise he can hear is the ominous melody of nothing.
“Yeah I told him last month, once I found out I was coming back to Hogwarts. I put it off as long as possible but he wasn’t taking any more rubbish excuses.”
. He could lie and say that it was the fault of the other boy alone- that he came at Harry from nowhere, all soft lips, strong hands and bold movements. It would be in his best interests to do that, to go back to how it was before. It is as if Harry has been living with his curtains shut his whole life, existing in a hollow darkness but not knowing any different. But now, imagine that he has tripped, fallen head-first into these curtains. Picture the way they would open- just a glimpse- and a slither, only small, of golden light would burst into the room like a comet blazing through the sky. It would illuminate the spot on the wall opposite, a flowing outpour of energy never seen before. Would he just be able to just leave it at that? Keep them only half-open, doomed to never learn more, or even more torturous, dare to close them again?
as Justin. Think of all the well-meaning, solid advice he would have to endure and possible take up. Ignorance really can be bliss.
“Uh-” he falters, scrambling for the appropriate answer and not finding it, “Kind of? I don’t know.”
“Potter-” calls Malfoy, but it is too late. He hurls off of the Astronomy Tower, before collapsing onto the hard metal.
Ron and Hermione order for them both and when the food comes, simple but delectably gooey pizza, they all dig in ravenously. Conversation bounces between them and Harry zones out, thinking of his now very apparent status as a lone bachelor.
“Well, that‘s what Fred and George once told me, so spread it at your own risk, I guess,” says Neville with a sad smile.
“I bet you’re gonna be a famous Quidditch player one day, Gin. I see it now: First successful Weasley- nation shocked!” he jokes in an attempt to change and drop the subject. If the implication of their previous conversation is what Harry thinks it is, he is both confused and a little angry. It hasn’t been that long since they broke up, he thinks heatedly. Maybe that’s unfair of him, but he recalls the weeks after it ended, and the bone-deep agony that he felt at each and every reminder of her. In his pit of despair, he had thrown away his favourite Quidditch magazines, the ones that they had shared together.
Boredom- in that his life, his lessons, his conversations, the days which blur into one, feel so exceptionally pointless to him now. Sadness- in quite literally every way possible, and so bloody different to the picture of Malfoy’s beaming expression. And an overwhelming sense of
. He has to admit that it is that now- stalking. The echoes of sixth year make him feel violently ill, with everything that comes with it, but he must proceed. It wouldn’t be particularly useful for him to vomit now, just as Malfoy has let down his guard. Granted, that is because he thinks nobody is watching but, frankly, to hell with black and white morals- they went out of the window a long time ago. We live in a grey world; not even one tone- dozens of different hues- and we just have to learn to deal with that uncomfortable truth.
Actually, he is lying. It’s terribly awkward, and he only hopes that soon she will run off to find Dean, as the latest gossip tells, and by that he means Ron. Who told him this with a bucketful of bottled anger, an accusatory finger pointing at the wall for emphasis on the particularly harsh notes, and a chopstick funnelling Pad Thai into his mouth.
Several beats pass and Harry realises that the Headmistress is staring at him. His mind draws a blank, still struggling to process the events, until he remembers that she had asked him a question.
“I’m going to look like Seamus’s left testicle when I lose my hair, I’m telling you,” and Hermione wacks him for being crude, before guffawing. Whilst Harry wants to laugh, he is rather sent into a mild state of horror, remembering that he has indeed seen Seamus’s left tescile. And his right.
Currently, he is sitting on the Astronomy Tower. It isn’t as pleasant as he thought it would be; the long lengths of plank suddenly seem to accentuate how large the place is, and how little fills it.
- in his head at night.
He sits unassumingly, knees drawn up against himself and eyes closed. If it weren’t for his irregular breathing, Harry would think him asleep. Thanks to the wind, his hair is in complete disarray, whipping madly at his high cheekbones. Harry almost feels guilty for disturbing him.
That night Malfoy doesn’t snore, and Harry suspects that they are as wide awake as each other.
Mind, it still isn’t now- not really in the grand scheme of things- but he will admit that his and Ginny’s unbothered way of living didn't really spark the excitement in him that he had thought it might. He can see how Luna, with her perplexing and elaborate style, both in clothing and lifestyle, would be good for Ginny. Something new, to shake up the stale routines that she, and he, had settled into. He wishes them great joy, he does, even as he frowns a little.
“As if. You’re just as terrified to talk to people,” quips Harry. He steadfastly ignores the fact that he just gave away his social anxiety like it is anybody’s information. Thankfully, Malfoy seems to discard it as important; it is likely something he didn’t need to be told to know that it’s true. Harry isn’t the most subtle.
, in the expanse of Malfoy's bed. Whilst not knowing definitively, he can doubtlessly assume that Malfoy had arrived back in the common room at some point in the day, hidden it, and is now hoping desperately that nobody has noticed. As if that was possible- the beast is sparkling emerald, for Merlin's sake.
“It’s OK, Harry,” Hermione says tenderly, “I wouldn’t blame you if you had decided to run away. Frankly, I’m surprised you didn’t,” her eyes widen and she adds “and I’m happy that you haven’t!”, as if she fears he is about to bolt out of the carriage at any given second. The idea is tempting.
He arrives on the corner of Hyde Park without even realising it. It’s late August, a sunny day, and therefore, brimming with energy. Groups of teenagers in skimpy tops and shorts are dotted around and a few yards from him, a plump couple are topless in the sun, their pink skin sinking into the grass. Is that even legal? He’s out of touch with Muggles. And Wizards, his subconscious adds.
Now, a new feeling, half relief and half dreadful anticipation. “What do you mean?” inquires Harry, though he isn’t sure he will be able to digest any response which isn’t just Malfoy calling him an idiot.
, Harry isn’t sure whether it is linked to anything, or if he is forming non-existent connections out of the madness of his mind. Merlin, maybe neither the spell, the potion, nor his silent demeanor have anything to do with each other. He feels as if he has dug himself into an abyss of which there is no way out, regardless of whether there is anything to discover in there or not.
Alas, he has no choice but to bury that pit somewhere where the sun doesn't shine as signs of the forthcoming day start to show themselves. This is primarily the ceasing of the snoring from his roommates, which, at an almost Ron-like level, blare out aggressively through the night. Anthony, in particular, is a powerhouse of noise once sleep takes him. For a boy who started out so quiet, he has proven to be rather raucous in his grandest moments.
even if it were more subdued than before. It is only now that Malfoy barely speaks at all that Harry realises how loud he had once been, how much of a bloody drama queen. The contrast is harrowing. Thinking back to Hagrid’s advice, Harry realises that maybe he doesn’t even need to pretend that Malfoy is a stranger. He is one already. And he didn’t realise until now how difficult that would be to admit- he has always considered himself as someone who knows Malfoy well, even if it were antagonistically.
“Thought my heart was devoted to another?” he asks Erin jokingly and almost wants to bat his eyelashes in a teasing gesture, before he remembers that she isn’t actually in the room with him. He abruptly stops himself in time- thank god. Justin’s proving to be a nightmare anyway, and goodness knows what he would do if he had actually seen Harry fluttering his eyes like some floozy actress from the 50s.
hi guys!! pretty proud of myself for how long this is considering i wrote it in only a few days. i've read over this a million times and i now hate it and really can't tell if it actual utter shit like i think it is, or if im just sleep deprived. maybe a mix of both. anyway hope u enjoy!
Ron just shakes his head, looking embarrassed. Whether this is on Harry’s behalf, or because he doesn’t want to be spotted next to a human disco ball, Harry isn’t sure. “Didn’t work, mate. Must be some type of extra special, sticky love glitter.”
How is he supposed to know how to respond to that? For starters, he barely understands the answer himself. And secondly, he would really rather jump off the Astronomy tower than be here, discussing the complexities of his encounter with Death, with an eleven year old boy whom he has never met before. He looks perplexed and dissatisfied at Harry’s half answer and the expectation of a follow-up is weighing, so Harry inches away, towards the bottom of the steps. Today is not the day to ponder about whether he should be alive or not. What ifs are dangerous, he has learnt. He thinks it certainly feels like the right time to avert an existential crisis.
Finding that it doesn’t work, and rather just gives him a minor headache, he decides to get up. He realistically isn’t going to be sleeping tonight, as much as he craves the respite. Thank you, Justin, for that. Harry cringes and feels like sobbing when he remembers just how close he had been to nodding off. It seems Malfoy manages to plague him even in unconsciousness.
have failed you slightly.”
Harry smiles at nothing in particular. As it grows brighter with the arrival of the night, the moonshine alights Malfoy’s hair, making it glow. It is reminiscent of the silver light from the spell that Malfoy has been practising. Though it has been a few weeks since he saw it last, the memory is still fresh in his mind. After having read that small introduction to
“Pansy Parkinson,” she grumbles unhappily, but then brightens a fraction, “Padma, and Susan. I’m actually rather excited to be with those two. Susan is lovely and Padma has incredibly interesting theories on Runes in the Age of Alexandria the Forlorn which I cannot wait to hear.”
Malfoy tilts his head, a shiver of a smirk on his lips. “So you admit it? You’ve been stalking me?” His voice is dripping with menacing tease.
The following day refuses to bring Harry any clarity and he feels cheated. Why was the phrase ‘sleep on it’ ever invented if doing just that made his brain fuzzier than before?
“Walking in the Forbidden Forest?” he says casually, raising an eyebrow to convey his disbelief, “Nice place for a stroll I guess, if you’re into that sort of thing. Werewolves, Centaurs and stuff.”
“Hey, Harry! Care to join?” says Seamus cheekily, almost causing Harry’s body to go into some sort of cardiac arrest. Dean slaps him playfully on the chest in horror; Harry wishes he could get one in too, as revenge for the wobbly feeling that overcame him when Seamus opened his gob..

“Whereabouts?” asks Harry, rubbing at his cheek. When he pulls his hand away, it is bejewelled in gold sparkles and he groans. Switching to his other cheek, he does it again and receives the same distressing news when he once more brings back his hand. “Fuck. Ron, is it everywhere?”
“Quite rubbish. Pomfrey has some vile tasting potions,” replies Malfoy, half-serious but clearly avoiding the seriousness at hand. He twists his skeletal fingers even harder now; Harry stares, in awe at this uncomfortable, openly flustered version of his longtime rival. Just as Harry thought would happen, Malfoy appears to notice his gaze and flushes deeply before stopping immediately.
“Because he said he could never be with someone like
just a little filler. harry goes to diagon alley and we meet an important original character.
when he remembers how he had blurted out that forsaken question about Malfoy’s burnt Dark Mark.
“It was just from a nosebleed,” Jenna says from behind him, startling his lungs back into normalcy. Sympathetically, she takes the offending object from the stack and, with a flick of her wrist, vanishes it wandlessly. “Maybe we should have put this one away earlier. My apologies, Mr Potter.”
“That’s not what this is,” defends Harry. Something in the other boy's words struck a nerve in him, even though it’s not entirely applicable to this situation. He isn’t lying when he says it’s more than just his admittedly existent Saviour complex.
Malfoy stops about a metre away. He parts his lips, body rearing like the air before a lightning strike. Then, abruptly, he stops in his tracks, and appears to change the course of his sentence. Some of the painful tautness in his body eases to just a recognisable rigid as his walls go up. Nothing in the known universe could explain why this frustrates Harry.
“Did it hurt when you burnt your Dark Mark?” he asks, and regrets the question as soon as it is out in the open. He has crossed an unspoken boundary, entered new frontiers. Whether Malfoy will deem it too far, or let him across, is a different matter.
Although, considering the brief glimpses of anger that Harry has been a witness to, maybe he hasn’t completely transformed. The livid look on his face earlier today was more akin to the boy he once knew. The curiosity kills him, but he must resist. It’s pointless to him now, when there are so many other things that need to be addressed. He cannot let Malfoy be at the front of his mind, as he had in sixth year- he
Harry is mildly horrified at such a depressing statement, but he also wants to laugh. It is typical of people head over heels in love to focus on the small weed in a field of flowers. For Justin to get so wound up about such pedantic things, like the number of bands, means that he misses the bigger picture: he has been given a fucking wedding ring. Even if it weren’t intended for marriage, it should tell Justin all he needs to know about luck and love.
“Welcome, my dears!” Madame Malkin startles, busy tailoring and trimming a petite girl’s robes next to the expanse of mirror, which seems to stretch for miles somehow in the tiny room. “Do try to not cause a fuss in my doorway, if you will.”
, he offers himself as comfort, even though witnessing Malfoy in just a t-shirt and trousers is still enough to make him squirm uncomfortably.
Ron looks up dejectedly, “It happened, Harry. The old bugger must have done something.”
. It is covered in painted Phoenixes of all different shades, and they swoop around with as much grace as possible for a crockery decoration. One, a rich and wine-like merlot, rests on the crevice between the handle and the cup and seems to look up at the elderly witch, awaiting her response. It flaps its wings agitatedly; Harry understands.
He scoffs angrily, just once, and then goes silent. Harry, suddenly terrified that he might burst into tears, searches for something to comfort him with, “It’s pretty, but you could do better.”
He circles cautiously, making sure he has checked over everything. No stone can be left unturned. The hair on the back of his neck prickles, his hands shaking, though he pretends they are not. There is no time to panic.
Now on his wander around the castle, he gazes wistfully upon the first years buzzing from corridor to corridor. They seem to share a hive mind, swarms of young bees congregating in groups only; no child appears left behind. It’s heartwarming, all things considered. However, whilst they still retain that limitless energy that only eleven year olds seem to have the power to muster up, they do appear more subdued than normal, somehow. A sandy haired, thin girl hurries past him and he wonders whether she was the sister of the boy whom Harry had seen die, their eyes locked as he fell. A silly thought, but they shared the same hair colour at least, so it could have been possible. His heart clenches painfully as she smiles at him on her way.
The evening finds him in the library. Despite his intentions the day before, he is yet to even open the book he bought in Hogsmeade. After last night, after Malfoy, he has been left feeling a little wary. When his hard edges are wiped away, it is difficult to see Malfoy as the villain that Harry’s instinct tells him he is. There is a disconnect between the snarky, silent boy who has been sneaking around with suspicion written all over him, and the one last night, who confessed to Harry his love of Jasmine tea in whispered tones. Needless to say, it is much easier on his soul to envision the former, and this is what shakes him of his guilty conscience.
As he lies there, cursed by his thoughts to stay awake even in spite of his need to sleep, he imagines that instead of some random dorm, Malfoy is in the lab right now. The image makes him restless to go and check, and a wave of self-loathing throttles him for entertaining the idea. Harry clenches a fistful of his pillow, willing his subconscious to pipe down. He envisages Malfoy: glasses on, sleeves rolled up and baring his hideous scarred Dark Mark proudly to the ghouls that lurk down there. The cauldrons bubble furiously, masking the noise of Malfoy scrawling more senseless Potions recipes.
“You, Malfoy. I saw it, all green and scaly, at the foot of your bed this morning. Looked really worn from cuddling.” Harry has completely made that up. In fact, the dragon looked almost brand new when he had picked it up earlier that day, but his insults are lacking and he feels like he is sorely losing whatever battle this has become.
It makes him feel relatively normal.
“Shut it, Seamus. You’re right, Harry, it’s just that our dorm seems to be plagued with a Slytherin meeting right now. Could be a cult thing, for all I know. All I know is that me and Seamus cannot be there right now. Dangerous stuff.”
He watches as Malfoy does something else, something new in tonight’s episode of
Ron and Hermione walk closely together, their hands entwined as if they are one entity. He’s happy for them, he really is, but if they could save their affection for private so that Harry doesn’t have to plod alongside Ginny, as he is doing now, it would be most appreciated. Ginny’s long and auburn hair is swept into a ponytail, and he knows this means that she is going to Quidditch practise later. It’s something that he most admires about her. Her refusal to give into darkness- the way she throws it to one side like one of the Quaffles that she plays with.
“Alright, Potter,” Malfoy puts his slender hands in the air, “I believe you. Don’t get your panties in a twist.”
Ugh. It’s no wonder. Not when Harry isn’t even making the minimal effort task of opening his curtains to bid them all a good morning.
Of course he will be expected to sit through Auror training like a good, obedient little Saviour. Privately, he is dreading the idea. It seems laughable that anyone could visualise him as an Auror, as Ron and Hermione especially so often do. Harry has gotten into the habit of just smiling and nodding along whenever the subject arises, willing the sick feeling he has at the thought of going back into the field to settle. He supposes it will probably be alright. Ron will stick with him, and they will be the crime-solving, villain-defeating, heroic duo that the rest of Wizarding society expects.
“Because that is a Vanishing charm, Ron, and I don’t know about you, but I feel like doing one on my own face would most likely be a bad plan!”
When he awakes, Hermione and Ron are shaking him, and he realises that he has managed to sleep the entire journey. Congratulations Harry, he thinks, consistently proving the impossible, possible.
Justin.
Despite this, the churning and uneasy feeling in his gut outweighs his head and he continues along behind it. It takes him around countless bends and turns and, with a small cry, he realises that they could possibly be entering the Forest. The trees have assuredly risen high enough to be those he remembers every night in his nightmares, and a fog is beginning to materialise near the ground. He can no longer see where the dark foliage meets the sinking clouds, instead it forms one lid to a glass which traps him in it’s vile grasp.
------------
Ah. Relationship drama, perhaps? Not every tear is a result of deep war trauma, Harry, he reminds himself. Most people have normal struggles, with normal lives and normal levels of misery. As opposed to the crippling anguish that causes his body and mind to collapse on an almost daily basis- that is. It is strangely humbling to put into perspective how ridiculous he is.
There are several beats as neither of them say anything. Despite the silence, Harry can tell Mcgonagall hasn’t finished. She is purely giving him the opportunity to mull over the situation. He can tell by the twinkle behind her silver spectacles.
He wishes he could spare this same energy for Ron. Merlin knows the man deserves it, with everything he has to put up with in regards to Harry and his mood swings, let alone his own issues. Fred flashes before his eyes with a cheeky grin and his heart lurches. He wonders how many times a day Ron sees him. Beside Harry, laying on his back with his arms behind his head, Ron has his eyes closed, and Harry imagines sadly that he could be at this very moment. His ginger hair has created a halo of red around his face and looks like fire amongst the grass.
“Well, everyone is entitled to their own
He is afraid of the answer; hopes that it never comes.
“You’re no fun, ‘Mione,” Ron had complained grumpily, and was promptly hit with the force of her scorn. He had frowned and aimed for an angry bite of his crispy toast. The crumbs fell down his shirt and a splodge of the tangerine marmalade fell onto his white shirt. He groaned and Hermione looked smugly satisfied. For his part, Harry had simply eaten his own toast in bewilderment and thanked Merlin for being single.
He pays for his book and tips generously. Perpetually on time, Hermione meets him at the door, apparently having paid for her own bloody mini-library at another till in the shop. She has at least four bags full, but when Harry questions the need for such a copious amount, the bloodthirsty hint in her eyes makes him drop the subject.
What he is not sure on, is what the fuck it all means after that.
“No?” says Malfoy, “You really should. It can’t be healthy.”
“Not ungrateful, no!” Harry desperately rushes to clarify, not eager to cause Justin any more distress. Without thinking, he grabs Justin’s hand, causing the boy’s eyebrows to raise, and pulls him back down next to him. His hand is warm, fingers knobbly, and Harry drops it, embarrassed. “That isn’t what I meant. I just meant to say...things might not be as bad as they seem. Nobody gives someone a wedding ring without caring for them first. I don’t think.”
. Even more terrifying is that he thinks that Malfoy understands what he is saying. He sees it mirrored in his expression, in his cold eyes which search for something in Harry’s face, though he doesn’t know what. As he shuffles uneasily, Malfoy seems to find what he is looking for and comes to sit up straight.
He grabs the phone, noting that the number is unknown. Panicking for a second because he doesn’t know which key to press, he pushes a bunch of random buttons in the hope that one will be right. He must hit the jackpot, because one goes through and a voice rings out of the speaker.
hiiii ok so harry speaks to mcgonagall.... has a moment with justin.... has more draco moments..... you'll have to read i guess ;)
Harry wonders in shock. He has not a single fucking clue what he will say if he is. When he scans his memory, he can’t recall ever having to deal with this before. Like all couples, Ron and Hermione have had a few tiffs, but never anything as significant as an actual break-up. Of course there was him and Ginny, but even Harry, for all his inadequacy at romance, knows it wouldn’t be smart to use how he handled that as any sort of example.
Recovery isn’t linear, yes, he knows, but it seems to have taken another form entirely. It’s not a curved arrow. It’s not a zig-zag, or a circle. It’s a full stop, an unbudging blot in the fragile paper of his life, and he’s stuck in the ink of it.
“At three AM?” Malfoy says and raises his thin eyebrow fractionally as if he considers Harry an utter imbecile. Even so, it is way too polite. Where is the
The corner of her lips upturn, as if she is trying not to agree, but soon she has returned to frowning at him in displeasure. Oh to have a Hermione-level of restraint, it must be so helpful. He drops the subject but keeps the picture of Malfoy on his pointed knees, whilst scrubbing a toilet, in the back of his mind for further amusement. Sue him.
There is a question burning in his mouth that he doesn’t want to ask, but it is a poison. And like all poisons, he’ll either have to swallow it down or spit it out.
, Harry isn’t being dramatic. Would it be the worst thing in the world for a boy to get some good quality sleep once in a while?
“Silence!” Mcgonagall demands, “That will be all. Please enjoy your meal.” and as she speaks the words, the food materialises into existence.
“We broke up,” says Justin.
As he walks down the steps from the entrance hall, a huddle of girls are crowded around their friend, whose shaking shoulders give the impression that she is sobbing deeply. He witnesses a brief moment of lunacy from himself in which he wants to ask them why she is crying- some perverse side of him needing others to be sharing his pain. It would make him feel less alone though it is a horrible idea, really. But then he notices one particularly sharp looking girl, dressed in a Ravenclaw tie, glaring daggers at a boy who is sheepishly smiling back from across the courtyard. The strength of her glower still manages to wither Harry’s insides, despite the fact that he isn’t even the poor lad on the receiving end. In the midst of a deep sob, the crying girl looks up to flip the boy off.
Harry smiles unhappily. He doesn’t want Malfoy’s appreciation anyway, isn’t sure why he said it.
, is so very disturbing that Harry reckons it would be a wise idea to check himself into a hospital straight away in order to get the image professionally Obliviated. He wouldn’t trust Ron with a task so important.
Leaving, however, means going back to the dorm- means Justin, means confronting something that he isn’t ready to think about even slightly.
As it happens, it proves a good distraction. Soon Harry’s eyes are drying a little, enchanted by what they see before it. The incandescence is strong and as the surrounding area comes to light, he is able to spot where the sky begins once more. It helps him breathe a little easier, but he still refuses to look at the floor. You never know when an enemy may attack, not until it is too late. Eyes up, Harry.
“I can imagine.” he snorts, “I didn’t realise that Luna was the type to, you know, come to your games. I mean I know she used to watch all of the Hogwarts ones but I thought that was only because everyone did, back then. House pride, and all that.” and he chuckles at the memory of her lion hat, because Luna supported all the houses, not just her own. “But then I guess Luna wouldn’t be the one to do something she didn’t want to just because others were.” Harry loves that about her, erratic as she is.
“Fuck, I can’t find it!” Justin says manically and Harry takes the rod from him, so that he doesn’t need to worry about doing two things at once. Murmuring his gratitude, Justin wipes a bead of sweat from his forehead. For being buried under a lake, and encased in cool stone, the lab is proving to be unfairly hot.
. Feeling a tug in his stomach, he pushes the door open. A bell chimes somewhere as he enters the chilly room. Hermione follows a few moments later, and Harry faintly hears Ron mention that he is going into Zonkos, before dashing across the street.
Where does that leave him now though, when the only urgency he feels is one to climb into bed? Which direction does he take when he can’t see past the end of the day?
Harry thinks she’s better off without him. He’s not so sure about himself, but he recognises now that he was devastating her, as if she could have been any more so after Fred’s death. And he could not cope with the pressure and responsibilities of a relationship, not when a trip to the bathroom to brush his own fucking teeth is more uncommon than not. She thought it was disgusting, Ron doesn’t understand it, Hermione tries, and Harry? Well he’s just proud of the days where he does manage the trek along the landing, no matter how heavy his legs feel, and how much he just wants to collapse right there on the wooden floorboards. Kreacher would probably eat him for dinner if he died in the house.
“Just having a browse, thank you,” Hermione answers politely when Harry doesn’t. Jenna nods her head in understanding and returns to counting the Sickles at the till.
“Pretty much.” If it is even possible, Ron’s grin widens and he begins to point at a dozen spots on his own face. “It’s here,” he says, jabbing himself particularly harshly in the tip of his nose, just where it begins to curve up. It goes slightly red where he pokes it. “Here, too” he says, prodding his large forehead right in the centre. “Oh, yeah, and here,” and then he proceeds to gesture to the whole of himself with a hearty cackle.
harry arrives at hogwarts and stoof happens
This same intuition tells him not to lift his head. However, some of the rot in his head must finally be spreading, because he completely misses the memo and rather, does just that.
The fast-paced and hasty plod of Malfoy’s sock-ridden feet signals that he is returning. Harry just stands still, hands behind his back and smirking at the figure striding towards him. Despite an obvious attempt to appear unbothered, a blush creeps high on Malfoy’s cheeks as he comes into view, and it is this bodily betrayal that is revealing of his humiliation. His pale complexion is also extremely telling, letting every blemish and flush be blasted in full view. The juxtaposition of the increasingly darkening pink with his pallor is striking- and equally, hilarious. Biting his lip so as to not comment, Harry watches humorously as Malfoy brushes past him and tries to put on his shoes, still with a calm manner.
Yesterday, he had walked past Malfoy on his way to the toilet. Habitually, they had both stopped in their tracks, two metres from each other, bodies tense. Harry opened his mouth to speak, because, well, they always had
“Dorm room?” he asks.
No, he’s going to stay outside. Do something worthwhile and, Merlin’s Beard, healthy. The sun beams brightly, which invites warmth to drizzle through Harry in a manner more satisfying than any Warming Charm.
However, he had been pleased to note that Malfoy’s shoulders had been as stiff as stone on Sunday evening, back snapped straight, and clearly listening as Harry and Justin recounted the names of the returning students. He had clearly been trying to appear disinterested, but the distance he has been trying to set between himself and the rest of the school had shattered at the mention of Zabini.
him. It can’t be.
Eventually, just to make this spectacular night even better, Justin betrays Harry in leaving him alone with Malfoy. He utters some excuse about needing to owl Elliot, but it’s all just words to Harry. As far as he is concerned, there has been some mighty treason committed this evening.
“Of course you’re not,” Harry sighs.
It’s deathly silent apart from the noise of Malfoy turning the pages of his book. Harry had somehow never imagined that Malfoy would do anything as humane as read for pleasure. This whole experience is remarkably unnerving and he wishes with great fervour that he could go back to a simpler time. One where he is blissfully unaware of the length of Malfoy’s skincare routine- it’s ungodly long, Harry will confide- and of the fact that he likes to read before bed. Earlier, Harry had been deathly disappointed to find that the dragon was not where he had left it- perched, blatantly obvious and
“No, it’s OK. Thank you though for offering,” says Justin, “I’m probably staying with Elliot, if his parents can stand to be around me after what they said. He thinks they’re embarrassed,” he rearranges his robes and adds, “As they should be.”
Her eyes flash with anguish and he knows that she is remembering the pain of Bellatrix trying to split her mind open with Legilimency in a rabid, hungering fit of madness, peeling it apart like a wolf rips at the flesh of its fallen victim. At Malfoy Manor. Harry feels a little sick when he recalls how Malfoy had stood there- dark mark stark against his pale skin- with cold sweat and frightened eyes. And he had done nothing. Coward.
Malfoy shuffles against the wall, looking uncomfortable now that they have no excuse to bicker. If he is considering ignoring Harry again, he
“The idea that just about anyone could read my mind is bloody terrifying. Wouldn’t want someone like Zabini digging around in there- not that he wouldn’t now, even if it’s illegal,” Ron says, “Shady git.” Harry snorts, thinking of Zabini’s mysterious poise and slippery manner, and deciding that- yes- it’s definitely an appropriate description.
“Okay then,” he whispers, looking at Harry like he can see all the way through him, right down to his thundering heartbeat. Then, he hurries down the steps, out of Harry’s sight.
“I cannot say I am all together shocked,” she says with a slightly disheartened expression on her face, like his lack of enthusiasm for a job (which is ultimately half-violence and half paperwork) has disappointed her. This is exactly what he was afraid of. His heart sinks, and he realises with sovereign pain that the pressure of being Harry Potter is still there. When he says it in full like that, there’s a disconnect.
“Harry,” she starts, and the use of his first name shakes him from his somber thoughts, “I know I don’t need to remind you how many options are open to you, but it is worth remembering. Frankly, I’m certain that you could do whatever you so desire. Many people would give a lot to be in the very same position,” and Malfoy, on probation, largely in part to Harry’s testimony, springs to his mind at that. Harry knows it would be smart to take advantage of his good fortune, but truthfully he just wishes he didn’t have any leverage. Because, with it comes jealousy, and therefore, attention; after all that, expectation. Mcgonagall smiles at him with a sad sort of pity in her eyes, “Do you truly have nothing in mind?”
