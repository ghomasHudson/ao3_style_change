The atmosphere was relaxed, teasing, and that alone would be enough to unsettle him because this was
Potter did, but Draco almost wished he hadn’t, because when he slid down to the ground, Potter didn’t let him go as Draco thought he would, but pulled him closer instead. The room felt smaller than before, his skin hypersensitive to the slightest movement against it. He wasn’t sure if he was imagining the look in Potter’s eyes, because there was no way Potter could be looking at him like that, not when he wasn’t drunk.
“Wow,” Harry said, quietly, right before he started to laugh.
He had to turn away from the look in Potter’s eyes, unable to comprehend exactly what he might be seeing—too scared that he was only seeing what he hoped for. He pulled out his notebook and wrote a message to himself:
Blaise had disappeared to get clothing early on, returning with steaming coffees and bars of chocolate for them all. Draco’s tasted like ash but he knew it would help, and Blaise had gone to the effort of it, so he ate it all. Every bite caught in his throat, the rich scent of sugar drowned by the bile he kept wanting to spit out. The coffee was better—at least it was warm.
But he’s not… He can’t…
“You know, I genuinely thought—” he broke off again and turned back. “It doesn’t matter what I thought. Can we do this, Malfoy? Can we finish this without resorting to stupid little fights and insults?”
Something strange appeared in Malfoy’s expression, and when he opened his mouth to speak, Harry found he was holding his breath to hear what came next.
Isn’t that what they were here for, though?
Then, he pulled away, leaving Ron to dissect that cryptic remark on his own and making his way over to Malfoy.
It was like nothing he’d ever experienced before. Masturbating and even fingering had been fantastic, but the feeling was wholly different from this.
Later that day, when they were out in the forest checking once more for the unicorn hairs that they needed for their final assignment, it dawned on Harry that everything had shifted. It had started with small little touches when no one was looking—a hand on the shoulder, fingers running through hair—but soon enough he found himself not caring who saw. And the change that came over Draco as a result was breathtaking.
With an aching heart and blurry vision, Draco stood up and navigated a path to the bookshelf so he could research his newfound predicament.
She was the only person specialising in medicinal herbs, and Harry could feel her panicking that she would somehow miss out on the value of cross-departmental knowledge.
“Dragons for the dragon?” Malfoy had drawled, leaning on the bar so that the line of his collar hung low enough that Harry could see his nipples. “How original.”
“Yes, Potter. Like a fucking gift. Now don’t be a bore about it for too long—gifts can still be rejected.”
Everyone fell silent, hearts thumping. Then, they heard it.
The door widens and Draco steps aside to let him in. When Harry enters the room, he sees two suitcases laid out on the bed and all of Draco’s things packed neatly inside. He wonders if Draco would have left without saying goodbye, and if maybe Harry actually deserved that.
He unrolled the paper slowly, not entirely sure what to expect.
Malfoy shot him a patronising glance out of the corner of his eye, but didn’t comment.
example?”
“That’s quite a lot of important things weighing in the balance,” Draco said idly.
There was a truth in it all; this was how things were. Harry was sorry, and Draco was sorry, and they had been for years. They simply hadn’t yet accepted it.
“I need to feel you,” Potter rasped.
The way he eyed Malfoy gave Harry no illusions about who he suspected might end up in hospital by then.
Ah. Harry understood why Malfoy was pissed, now.
I’m not entirely sure what to say. I don’t recall writing you a letter, though the amount of torn up parchment I woke up to that morning is beginning to make an awful amount of sense. What did I say?
And it had been sent to a joke shop, of all places.
An owl whooshed through the open window, carrying a thick letter stamped with Blaise’s seal, and it was deeply important because Blaise had been researching the final reparation for him, but Draco didn’t open it.
The gentle wailing of
“Must you do that?” Draco asked, snapping the book closed and glaring at him.
Draco fought back the surge of anger that threatened to overwhelm him and struggled to view things from Granger’s perspective. He knew she meant well and wasn’t an idiot; he just had to remind himself that they viewed things a little differently.
Why had Potter taken so long to appear at his doorstep?
“What was the prophecy? Was it the one I heard in the dream?” Potter nodded, and there was something in his features, something that made Draco’s blood run cold as he realised the rest. “What line did you change?” he asked, even though he already knew. It was the line he had dreamed of, the night Potter first appeared and this whole mess began.
The dream whirled strangely around him, and he could feel the rage mounting beneath his skin. The curse sensed its end approaching, the Veela in him scenting the proverbial blood on the wind, because if this was no execution curse it was a redemption curse. For both of them. Perhaps the curse didn’t always bind the transgressor to the Veela they had wronged, but in this case, there was no one who could fit the role more appropriately than Draco. Potter wanted to forgive him, Fate or no Fate, and Draco wanted to forgive Potter for leaving him there. They both held that power, and if one of them would not see then it would destroy them both.
Heat coursed through Draco as the curse latched onto their blood, thriving as the walls closed in tighter. Blue flame flickered in Potter’s eyes, and Draco wanted to burn in it.
He passed out onto the ground. As his eyes closed, they took with it the glittering vision of an hourglass before him with only three slow grains of sand yet to fall.
Slowly, he let his hand drift down beneath the sheets, gripping himself through his pajamas. It felt amazing, but was he really going to do this? Was he really going to wank over Potter?
He waited until Potter had finished securing the area, then told him, “It’s a hellfire curse. Likely the only one, since they always set each other off when they’re in close proximity.”
“He’ll be fine in a day or two,” Granger went on, reaching across the table and patting Draco’s hand. “You’ve just never seen it before. He’ll hardly even remember what he said.”
Draco shook his head mutely, and the words fell out like they were the most natural thing in the world, “I’m sorry I insulted you last night. I went too far. I didn’t mean to accuse you of abandoning your friends.”
“What about the Security Project?”
Afterwards, he lay panting, staring blankly at the canopy of the bed while Harry removed his fingers, stripped out of his pants in record time and pulled at his cock until he was coming, too.
Harry
Harry laughed. “Yeah, yeah,” he said, waving Draco off. “Have you got them all? Can we go?”
“Yeah, you know, houses in areas that have been targeted a lot. High crime areas.” He cleared his throat. “Families with Squibs. Half-bloods in pure-blood districts.”
“Yes, no, I don’t know,” Draco snapped, dropping his hands to his trouser pockets. “Where the fuck is my fucking pen?!”
Like Umbridge, but somehow worse. I’ve never been able to look at cats the same after her,” Ron paused, face wrinkling as he swallowed. “And I live with Crookshanks.”
Now that he was looking closely, Draco could see how bloodshot Potter’s eyes were. There were dark circles underneath them, and although he was alert, his body seemed to sag.
He turned to face Potter and saw his own shock mirrored back at him.
He Vanished the board and stared dully into the fire.
Harry cast a glance at Malfoy, expecting to find him sneering or on the verge of a nasty remark. Instead, he was just as pale as when he’d first opened the door to see Harry, and from the look on his face, he didn’t find it very funny at all.
One by one, a series of wheels lit up with a gentle, purple light until they were surrounded by an undulating strip of purple on all four walls.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed, flushing a brilliant shade of red as he realised what Malfoy meant. “Good idea. Nobody ever comes to the library.”
Weasley’s voice scoffed in response. “When do you not fall head first into the middle of things? You’re Harry Potter; it’s what you do.”
Another mum came to stand beside them. “Are your kids on the field today?” she asked, rubbing her hands together to warm them and glancing over at them. “My Ben couldn’t make it today, but he insisted I come along to make sure they hadn’t started the new fixture without him.”
Everything in him willed him to stand up and walk away, to throw something cutting and cruel at Malfoy and leave. Old habits die hard, and Harry was more shocked than he would have thought to see that look on Malfoy’s face once more, when he’d thought it was gone for good.
“Stop?” Potter looked at him, confused. “Stop what?”
Then, his eyes caught Draco’s, and Draco forgot how to breathe.
“A broken heart, of course. How long was I gone? A year? A decade?”
Malfoy stopped dead, and his eyes flew up to meet Harry’s. It felt scarily like they were frozen together in that moment, like if Harry so much as dared to breathe or think or move, the moment would shatter and they’d combust or something equally horrible.
“You think I’m a freak.”
“Stop.”
Potter’s eyes slid to his, and he took a step forward, wand raised. “I have an idea,” he said, cheeks slightly flushed. “It’s a… er… spell that…” he trailed off and gestured helplessly to Draco’s arm.
“Fucking bollocks,” Draco hissed, climbing to his feet and looking around at the curse. After a long moment, he admitted, “I didn’t expect it to be an entire room.”
“Did you acknowledge when things were going wrong and do your best to right them, to the best of your ability?”
He cleared his throat, trying to work out the best way to begin this. “We need to make them think they have the upper hand,” he said. “No matter how natural we make it, if we act like we’re falling for each other out of nowhere, they’ll suspect we’re up to something. But if we let them think they’ve foiled our attempt at tricking them, but that we accidentally stumbled on something real in the process… well.” He finished his drink and poured another.
Except Draco was the monster.
Draco pushed open the door to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and winced as the gigantic pumpkin above the archway screeched like a cat.
“You really think it’s just a hellfire curse?”
“Seventy percent.”
Harry doesn’t know how long they rest like that, each of them spent and a little broken, but he knows he’s not the only one slowly being filled with a tentative, new hope. He thought this was his Daydream come to life, but so did Malfoy. Though one question still remains.
“Can—” Granger began abruptly, her expression turning sheepish. “Can I hug you?”
“Yours glitters so much more than mine,” Harry snickered. “We match.”
“Oh, the flu’s going around at the moment!” Evie said, turning to the other mum and widening her eyes. “So late in the season, too!”
It had been so long since anyone visited like this. He would have Blaise for tea, or Pansy via owl or Floo, but it was never like this. Never so… companionable.
He waved goodnight, wondering why he felt a sudden and unfamiliar apprehension at facing Malfoy. It wasn’t like the irritation he was used to—if anything, he would say that he often
The second he could break away from his friends, claiming tiredness and a need for an early night, he did. Malfoy had already left, and for a moment Harry was scared that he wouldn’t find him in their room, that he’d have disappeared somewhere in the castle. But when he opened the door, he was sitting there on the bed, leaning against the wall and frowning down at his hands.
She turned to him and grinned. “You think it makes you look like a tosser, don’t you?”
“Nope. Found it out the back of Flourish and Blotts. Mildred hadn’t put it out for sale because she thought it was too terrible to sell.”
“I always did have good taste.”
The wooden chest had a shiny inbuilt lock, and Draco wasn’t going anywhere near that for all the galleons in Gringotts. With a sigh, he checked the shields around the circle and left the room. When he found himself at the liquor cabinet, staring uselessly at the lock whose key was still somewhere behind the armoire, he swore and left the apartment for Diagon Alley. He couldn’t very well drink at home, not after tearing into Potter for it. He’d go and have a civilized drink with company at
It was why, when Potter leaned close enough that no one else could hear and whispered a question into his ear, it took him several seconds to realise what he’d said.
Come on, Potter, think about it for half a second. While there may be a very valid need to single this group out, you can’t say that there aren't also pure-blood families in need of extra protection, too. Just look at the Weasleys.”
If it couldn't find them, if the magic was too strong, it would at least give Harry a name.
He threw his spoon into the bowl where it landed with a strident clatter, sending flecks of chocolate liquid onto the table cloth. When he looked up at Blaise, there wasn’t even a hint of chagrin in his expression.
Slowly, Draco held it out and watched as Potter pushed up the sleeve and let his wand trail across Draco’s skin. Something that looked like syrupy ink dripped onto Draco’s skin, spelling out the words “Sweetheart Roland”. It tingled faintly in a nice sort of way.
Harry pulled him close and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Yep. Did you want to take the wards down?”
“As much as offering self-care suggestions to you goes against every ounce of free will in my body,” Draco said with a sigh. “Don’t you think you should sleep instead? The urgency has disappeared—Weasley is awake. You’re of no use to me if you’re falling asleep on the job.”
“The first time I saw you fly in Quidditch, it was like watching a hawk,” Malfoy went on, his expression never changing. “You fly like you were born to.”
He threw his hands up in the air. “Heaven forbid I treat the Saviour like a real human, capable of mistakes just like the rest of us. Silly me—I forgot you’re some kind of demigod instead.” He gave an elaborate bow. “Would you like your tribute in cash, or do you take credit?”
“So, you just ignored him?” he asked finally.
“I know,” she said. “That’s why I’m telling you, isn’t it?”
There was probably something pathological about the twists and jumps Draco’s mind had done to take joy in this situation, but since it presently involved Potter being wrong, he didn’t question it.
“Right,” Draco said, louder this time. “Potter, shield the civilians and protect the innocent, or whatever it is you do. I’m opening the box.”
“Fuck,” Harry breathed, clutching the sheets in two fists and fighting not to thrust into Malfoy’s mouth.
Near his mate.
Ron’s face crumples in sympathy. “I’m sorry, mate. Can I tell Hermione what’s happened, or do you want to tell her yourself?”
“It was addressed to me, and I’m opening it. Now, do what you do best, Harry, and make sure no one dies.”
They passed notes back and forth for hours, and Draco couldn’t recall a time when he’d smiled quite so much. Giddy like a teenager, he threw a final note into the fire, telling Potter for the eighth time that he really had to go to sleep.
“Fuck,” Potter breathed when he lay back beside Draco, a cleaning charm fresh in both their mouths.
A look of comprehension crossed Malfoy’s face, and he lowered himself down beside Harry, so they were both lying side by side on the bed. Harry was acutely aware of his trousers pulled halfway down his legs, and he wasn’t sure whether it would be more appropriate to pull them up or shove them down, so he just left them there.
Then, they were all covered in a mass of yellow. The boy stood there, staring up at the house with a dumbfounded expression.
But chaos descended, and Potter—naturally—fought him as the enemy, wrestling him for his wand. Even still, it wasn’t until Dobby proclaimed that he had come to rescue
How could he possibly figure out the curse when Potter was looking at him like that? He swallowed, searched for the words, and then swallowed again. It was pointless. No matter how many mysteries Potter kept throwing at him, he had to just shove them away or he’d never be able to focus on the task at hand. It’s not like he was going to get any answers anyway.
Lacking any other choice, since he’d only brought curse-related items with him, he’d outlined everything in great detail to the professors below and hoped Lockhart could figure it out.
“Sorry?” he asked again, blinking in confusion.
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he said nothing. Eventually, he fell asleep.
He didn’t get the chance. Another voice spoke instead. “My parents deserve to
“What the fuck,” he breathed quietly before reaching down and double checking that he hadn’t done something incredibly embarrassing.
He couldn’t even begin to care about the insult in Malfoy’s words, he was so relieved that it wasn’t going to come to a sudden end. That, if nothing else, was insurance that Malfoy wouldn’t go spreading rumours about Harry’s lack of sexual prowess. Even if he did, Harry had a pretty good idea how to retaliate. And what did it matter, anyways? They’d just end up humiliating and exposing each other to their peers’ ridicule.
It made Draco shiver, lines of fear running down his spine.
Malfoy turned back completely and came to stand in front of him, so close he could feel warm breath ghosting across his cheek.
The pointy git is actually opening up to you, by the sound of it. Merlin knows why, but if you want to make sure he doesn’t regret it and send you packing, you need to reciprocate.
This time, the silence seemed full of something, expectant and waiting. Harry wasn’t sure who moved first, but after a moment they had both slowly risen until they were standing in front of each other, close enough to feel each other’s breath on their skin.
Maybe he’d kill Potter, but he’d get to kiss him first.
As the dream swirled around him, soothing him, healing him with the joyous possibility of a life he could have lived, Draco slowly woke up.
Ron knows about the cupboard. He knows all the many ways that Harry struggles, even to this day, to grow beyond it.
Malfoy sighed. “You
“Yeah,” Harry said slowly, watching as Ron crossed his arms over his chest, glaring mutinously at Hermione who had walked off in exasperation. “I don’t know about that, actually.”
“Never better,” Potter murmured with a wicked grin, doing up his trousers and leaning back against the railing.
Malfoy gave him a strange look. “What?”
“Well, we let their imaginations run wild,” Potter said with a private smile. “Refuse to fill in the gaps, and then—” he paused, mulling it over.
“You don’t know that for sure,” he whispered, holding the door to the shop open for Potter.
“Bullshit. If you won’t talk to me, you should talk to a professional at least.”
It was an odd experience to be chastised by a bodiless entity.
He thought this might have been the looming sensation he was trying to escape, the sense of something bearing down upon him. But now that it had hit… he found he could hold it after all. At least, like this, with someone holding him too.
Potter shrugged. “Community service is as much as they get for that. Meanwhile, the shopkeeper is terrified for his life and thinking of closing up. It’s not right.”
It led, of course, to Potter.
“Malfoy, look, I know you’re trying, and I’m glad. It might be nice to get to know a Malfoy who isn’t a prick through and through.” He ran a hand through his hair distractedly, taking stock of what Malfoy’s face was doing. He’d started pinking again, though this time probably not from embarrassment. Harry rushed on, trying to beat him to the punch if only to avoid an argument and so he’d still be in time to grab a slice of toast if he was lucky.
Potter snorted derisively and glanced up at him. “There’s always a new plan.”
Draco heard Ron Weasley’s voice clearly, and he fought back a sneer.
“Surely, we’re smart enough to figure out that leaving no notes at all is a bit strange,” Potter gave a bitter smile. “And I mean, I’ll have activated the amulet. Surely we’ll realise you forgot a pen and something bad has happened.”
“I recall how you sat,” Potter mumbled, mopping the last of the sweat from his brow with his sleeve and closing his eyes. “Like you had a stick up your arse.” He snapped his eyes open again. “Oh look, you’re doing it now.”
Harry turned back to Malfoy, and they stared at one another in equal states of speechlessness.
“No.” Pansy shook her head, already reaching for the door, like Draco was a lost cause and she wasn’t going to waste another moment more on him. “That’s not why you’re doing this—you’re doing it for Potter.” With that, she opened the door and left, letting it slam pointedly behind her.
are talking about manipulating society.” He raised a hand against Potter’s objections. “Manipulation is a dirty word, but it doesn’t have to be. You’re not lying. You’re not deceiving. You are simply considering what you want the public to see and how that might affect how you want the public to act. You want them to understand the consequences of their prejudice—yes? That’s why you wanted to accompany that family to the station. You want them to understand that the Ministry will not stand for the sorts of attitudes that led to the rise of a Dark Lord, and on a deeper level—a level you don’t entirely understand yet because it’s not a way of thinking you’re familiar with—you want them to be faced with the direct impact of those prejudices.
let me help you, Harry.”
Potter’s brow furrowed as he stirred the brew, three times clockwise, three times anticlockwise, and then raised it to smell. As the smell hit his nostrils, his nose wrinkled in distaste, and he wiped the fog of heat from his glasses with his sleeve.
He nearly stumbled when Potter’s eyes met his. The unsteady Apparation had left his hair even wilder than usual, sweeping across his face and shadowing his eyes. If he didn’t know better, he would have said Potter
“How is he?”
And if those boundaries were to tell Draco to fuck right off, that was what he would do. But before he left he would made it clear that Potter only had to say the word—there was
Malfoy stands slowly, his eyes lingering on Harry’s open fly. “I would have hoped that would be obvious.” He leers at Harry, but it’s a little unsure, still with a hint of fear.
He stared at the letter for a long time before he opened it. His hands shook a little and it took him several attempts just to break the seal.
get something in return. It’s a partnership program, just like the supplies. Pure-blood families volunteer to work with the at-risk families to apply the potion-based wards and tailor a plan to suit their needs. All the Ministry needs to do is come by and approve it at the end, which will ensure no corners were cut in the application of the security spells.”
Internally, Draco shrieked. Externally, he fought to keep as calm as he could.
“You’ve been an arse.”
Love, Hermione
Draco eyed the package, taking in the way it pulsed softly in the light. Hellfire curses didn’t pulse; only transfiguration or ignition curses had enough residual power to hum like that, and they didn’t explode. It didn’t make sense.
Draco realised, abruptly, that the anger he kept seeing in Potter was completely gone as well. He actually looked happy.
“Sure,” Malfoy said, lifting his chin.
Draco stuttered. “For what?”
“I said, can I kiss you?” Potter’s eyes were warm, the little crow’s feet in the corner crinkling with genuine affection.
“Nothing.” Draco spun back around and glared at the wall.
“Believe me, Ron,” Potter said sharply. “I know Malfoy’s the wrong sort. I’m not about to forget that.”
“You’re insufferable. Why did I think this was a good idea?” Malfoy groaned. He got up, apparently unselfconscious of his nudity, and frowned at the mess they’d made of themselves and the bed. He fished for his wand in the bunch of his pants. “I hope you’re decent at cleaning charms, Potter. I won’t clean up after you every time.”
When Harry opened his eyes again, something had changed. He hadn’t dared hope that when Draco had agreed to come back tonight, it might mean anything. As far as he knew, they were simply adjourning to somewhere more private, continuing the celebrations in comfort.
A surprised laugh escaped Harry’s lips, and when he looked up to see Malfoy smirking sheepishly, he couldn’t stop. Soon, Malfoy joined him, the sound carrying clear and bright across the roofs of London.
Potter grimaced. “The one before. Technically.”
“This is all very,” Hermione groped for a word. She settled on “big. Harry, you’re sure this is what’s going to make you happy?”
“Upset?” Potter frowned and pushed away from the stairs. “I’m not upset. Shall we have a drink?”
The last of the curse left him, sapping him of his energy, and he sank to the ground. “What happened?” he asked, stronger this time.
“Of course.”
“Kalen O'Fearadhaigh?” He read out. “Ever heard of him?”
Getting the message, Harry groaned and pushed back as Draco slicked his fingers with lube and slid them inside. Before long, he was panting and writhing, and Draco didn’t waste time lining up his cock and thrusting inside, slow and hard. He gripped Harry’s shirt beneath his hands and reached around, tugging at Harry’s cock in the same rhythm as his steady thrusts.
A strange look crossed Potter’s face. “Wait.” He picked up a previously abandoned text and flicked through until he obviously found what he’d been looking for. “Curse words.”
Malfoy gave a surprised laugh, glancing at him quickly before looking back at the parchment. “I suppose we’d better get on with it.”
“Snap out of it,” Draco muttered, his eyes searching Potter’s for any sign that the man was fit to be in public. He didn’t find it. “You’re going to cause a scene.”
“Malfoy, you don’t need to go all stilted and formal,” Potter tried. “Look, I’m sorry how that came out. It’s not the whole story. I can tell you what—”
“Ah,” he said wisely, leaning back in his chair. “And, like a conscientious mate, you’re willing to prepare your new lovenest to their liking?”
The silence overwhelmed them, sick with disbelief and inevitability. Harry let it. Sometimes, you just had to let it.
Even the knowledge that he was doing something so stupid and irreversible as pining after the impossible wasn’t enough to completely ruin his mood, though it was making him more introspective than normal. He wondered if, had he been able to avoid this curse business and live his life with a continued distance from Potter, would he have been able to avoid this realisation? Or was it simply one of those things that had a sinking inevitability to it? Perhaps he had only ever been living on borrowed ignorance, and now his stash had run out.
Harry had simply assumed he was. Malfoy was so hesitant, so unsure about taking things quickly, that he had just taken it as fact that Malfoy was unexperienced. So, when he overheard Zabini and Parkinson laughing about one of Malfoy’s old conquests who was apparently trying to win him back via a drunken strip tease on the other side of the club, his mind went strangely fuzzy and blank.
Draco stopped drinking. He felt sick with the realisation that he had never seen it, and then the sickness—the guilt—evaporated as the twisted burn of rage took its place. Perhaps he had never noticed, but Potter’s friends should have. They should have understood it; how could it be that
Stacy’s mum had been a little more nervous, confiding to Harry that she was mildly terrified that something would explode with glitter and she wouldn’t be able to think of a believable lie quick enough. But it had gone as smooth as possible. All four children had occasionally broken up into fits of giggles that left the other kids bewildered—particularly when one of the parents had commented on the old-fashioned broom tucked into the corner of the kitchen—but that was it.
“Some of them were difficult to move, but since we still don’t know what we’re dealing with… we thought it best to confine… the items.”
At that, Malfoy seemed to freeze. Harry watched him go through the motion of taking in a deep breath and steeling himself against whatever he was planning on saying next.
“You don’t think I could be a dancer? That’s rude, Potter.”
Looking at the careful way Malfoy held himself now, he found himself more curious than ever about what was going on inside his head. Had it started back then? It was nearly three years ago now. Had Malfoy been different all this time?
“Intense,” Draco breathed, though he wasn’t entirely sure if he was answering the question or commenting on the green eyes currently holding him captive.
Malfoy laughed and climbed off him, and they managed to make it into the showers minutes before the others returned, calling down the corridor looking for them.
“You think I’m falling for him.” The words sounded oddly distant, like they were said by someone else.
Potter finished writing Kalen O'Fearadhaigh’s name on Draco’s arm, and then he stood back and retrieved the amulet from his shirt.
Draco stared at him, unable to think what to say or to guess what might have happened to make Potter look like this. He gave up without trying and got to his feet. “Shall we?”
Potter turned to him, green eyes wide and guileless. They hadn’t planned this, but it was hardly out of the bounds of what they had discussed. Now Draco just had to get the words out without feeling like he was somehow doing something he was going later regret.
Harry took a deep breath and was surprised to find wetness coating his cheeks, his lips. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been. “I’m sorry your parents were gits who thought that was a normal thing to do for a child who wanted to play Healer,” he said brisquely, hoping Malfoy knew what he meant.
“We don’t have to,” Potter said, his voice several notes lower than normal. “If you don’t like casual sex, just say the word and I’ll go back to work.”
“I have an idea,” Potter said quietly.
The wolf continued to speak. “Meet in five for a full report.” Then, it vanished.
“It’s…” Malfoy waved his hands. “An instrument. I made it, and it’s hard to explain.”
The succulents looked a little worse for wear, which was odd, because according to Neville you had to be an absolutely terrible gardener to kill a succulent. But the bee had travelled a long way for it, so Harry withdrew his wand and muttered a careful
The dust coating on his medical texts was so thick, it floated into the air in giant chunks when Draco blew on it. At age seventeen, these books had been a constant bedside companion as he poured through page after page explaining his symptoms. At twenty-eight, he hadn’t looked at them in years.
Draco breathed in and out slowly through his nostrils and took a step back. “You know you look eleven years old again when you pout like that?” he shot out, and then he poured them both tea.
The specifics of the letter wormed their way into Draco’s mind, and he stiffened. The Stevenses, his mother had said… but surely they were tied to Draco. Why else would a Veela Curse of all things have turned up
Granger placed a placating hand on his shoulder. “He’s right to ask, Ron. It doesn’t sound like we did.”
The moment drifted around them, and between the time they laid down upon the sand and the time they stood, Potter reaching down to help Draco up with an offered hand that Draco gratefully accepted, they became friends.
Then the horror of the situation truly hit him, and he watched, numb, as George fell to his knees, hugged his dead twin, and sobbed.
Malfoy’s voice jolted Harry out of the strange train of thought he’d fallen down, and he frowned, trying to parse sense from the words. “About what?”
“You’re not going to like the answer.”
“Lots of reasons. I don’t really want to have to sneak around to meet you. It would also stop Ron and Neville from just barging in whenever they want. They might actually learn to knock. If we’re doing this, I don’t want to have to hide it. I’m not ashamed of what I am or this. If we’re going to keep seeing each other after this is over—”
Potter’s fingers brushed against his as he took the paper cup, and Draco felt a rise of irritation at the way it made his heart leap. He sat down in his surprisingly still vacant seat and marvelled at how the strange circumstances of the last three days had led to such an unpredictable moment.
“I do give a shit, Potter.”
The curse washed over him, and with cold certainty Draco realised that, whatever it was, if he didn’t get it, Potter's wouldn’t be the only life the curse would take.
It was pure coincidence that he looked at Potter just before the room faded away. There was no noise to alert him, no sensation of being watched, just a chance turn of the head for no reason at all. As their eyes met, Draco was thrown by the depth of longing he saw there, the way that Potter’s eyes seemed to hold sadness and fear and want with the same fierceness that they used to hold nerve and fortitude.
“It is.” Potter paused. “Do you remember when I said dying was my biggest accomplishment?”
Draco pulls back and stares up at him, eyes wide and brow furrowed. “No, wait,” he mutters. “That’s all wrong.”
Harry’s stomach sank, nausea setting in immediately. “I’m so sorry.”
He’d shoved it aside and carried on. Potter was safe, surrounded by friends who finally understood the severity of his condition. Had Draco been welcome back home, he would have Apparated that second. It was no great hardship to travel to France for his own therapy sessions, and he longed more than anything to be by Potter’s side as he took those steps toward hope. But Potter didn’t want him there, and Draco’s presence would hurt more than it would help—a visual reminder of the seething emotions and poor coping skills that ruled Potter’s mind.
“What did you say about Veela?” Potter asked.
. Harry leaned in, accidentally bumping their noses together as they met eagerly, lips parting as they kissed each other like they’d been apart for days.
The casual angle of his lean seemed suddenly deliberate, forced. Draco willed himself to act normal, like he was talking to a wild animal who was about to spook.
“Yeah,” Potter agreed, smirking a little even though his cheeks were still pink. “We should try it some time.”
Something painful stuttered in Draco’s chest; he ignored it. “Go on.”
Potter raised an eyebrow. “That really took a lot out of you, didn’t it?”
When he’d agreed to sign up for the summer program, he’d been secretly overjoyed at the chance to come back to Hogwarts for three months. It wasn’t that he didn’t enjoy studying in the pre-specialist program at the Ministry, but even after three years away, he couldn’t pass up the chance to come home. Besides, Hermione had told him there would be a range of past students studying a number of different things for the program, along with students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. It had sounded fun—a light-hearted escape from his newly adult world.
“Barbaric,” Draco breathed.
At his desk in the corner, Malfoy turned to look at him.
I’m going to France. Does the wizard district use Galleons there or do I need to change over currency?
Potter gave him a wicked grin, and he nearly died.
In fact, he would need to ask Blaise to investigate the lead he had found regarding the O’Reillys and two peacocks discovered roosting in an old barn near Bath. If he was right, it would be the last of it, so he could not afford to miss the chance, but neither could he afford Potter messing it up for him. Potter had always been a nosy child, and since he had grown up to become an Unspeakable one could only assume he had become not only nosier but more entitled about it. Draco would send Blaise a letter now.
“Pleasant.” His eyes met Harry’s, their gaze heated.
“Yeah, it was much simpler than that: you’re Veela.” Potter huffed a laugh, a tinge of pink blooming in his cheeks. “Who knew?”
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, hiding his smile behind his glass. “You look like you’re doing a fine job of it yourself.”
Draco caught sight of the cover of the book and gave a small start. “I used to have that book when I was younger,” he said, smiling at the little girl. “It has wonderful fairy tales in it.”
Apart from that initial interest hitting him in a rush, it didn’t seem to be physical at all. It didn’t even feel like a lie.
Potter rolled his eyes. “Because I thought it’d be a fun activity. I need it to stop the curse, you git.”
Harry loves lasagne, and he loves Wednesdays because that’s when he gets to cook it. He’s not sure if it’s the fact that it’s such a simple dish—something the Dursleys never allowed him to cook because it was messy—and so it feels almost like a rebellion. Maybe it’s just because he likes cheese. Or, maybe it’s because of the look on Draco’s face when he sits down, glass of red wine in hand, and tries to not to smile at the plate in front of him.
“You arse,” Draco breathed, and then he straightened himself up and followed Harry into their bedroom.
Nathan had been wonderful, but they’d ended on bad terms. Nathan had insisted Draco was using him as a “fill-in” for what he couldn’t have. Draco had called him a self-obsessing idiot, and that had been that.
He rifled through his trunk—placed at the end of the bed by the house-elves, just like old times—for his instruments. Curse Breaking didn’t require too much from him, usually… Most curses were known. This one wasn’t. He’d brought every instrument he owned.
“Well, to be fair, the feathers are more about the wands and my magic’s… weirdness. They probably have nothing to do with the curse.”
Draco snorted. “So it’s just a lark to you, then.”
“It wins,” Draco agreed reluctantly, sweeping his hula-hooping Santa Claus off the table and onto the floor, where losers belonged.
After a long, drawn-out moment, Malfoy nodded.
“If you can’t erase the invasion, you can at least dilute it. Spread a few rumors. Give a ridiculous interview. Have a little fun with it.”
He noticed, then, that George’s expression had lost the casual humour from seconds ago. His mouth was pressed into a thin line, and when he looked around the room, his movements were stiff and jolted. It struck Draco that he had never before seen him afraid.
“I figure if we’re going to do this whole friends with benefits thing, we should probably talk about it. Things we do and don’t like so we don’t end up doing something one or either of us doesn’t enjoy.”
Draco set down his spoon. “Some things changed,” he said carefully.
Potter stood abruptly, hands clenching by his side as he ignored the soft coos of the sleepy birds and crossed the room to the armchair beside Draco’s. “I dreamwalked, because we’re running out of time, and I thought, since this curse is your own unconscious casting, your subconscious might hold answers your mind doesn’t. Don’t worry, I didn’t learn any of your deep dark secrets.”
Even in the darkness, his fingers kept moving, caressing Potter’s face, his jaw. When Draco opened his eyes, he was struck by the fierce longing he saw on Potter’s face, the white-knuckled grip of Potter’s hands against his jeans.
Ron was patting him on the back while Hermione peered at him concernedly.
With each press inward, Draco rocked down on him, fucking himself crudely.
The girl immediately turned her attention on him, delighted to expand her audience. “It does! It even has ones that Aunty Morgan doesn’t know! She tells the
“Perhaps they thought you might want to eat your hot chocolate instead of drinking it,” she remarked thoughtfully.
“No idea,” Potter admitted. “I couldn’t remember any of this, so I didn’t know what I was looking for, did I?” He looked around with a thoughtful expression. “Though, I kept wanting to read about wizard clocks, which in hindsight makes a lot of sense.”
He went to bed that night making a mental list of all the different things he’d like to try with Malfoy, and for perhaps the first time in his life, he felt the desire to visit the library in the morning without Hermione having to nag him about it.
Draco answered by undoing his trousers and shoving them down his thighs, making sure Harry’s were quick to follow. He took them both in hand and began to set a rhythm in slow, measured strokes.
Potter laughed bitterly. The remains of the mystery fell into place, and Draco decided he probably no longer had to wonder why Potter was all sharp edges and hollow stares, these days.
Draco dropped the notebook by his side and glared at him. “Can you stop doing that? It’s very disconcerting. If you wouldn’t mind just drooling and staring vacantly at the wall every now and then, I’d be so much more at ease.”
“Whose is it, then? Your cat’s?”
They were currently looking at a moving photo of a man suspended on a rack by his wrists and ankles whose testicles were being teased by a cat o’ nine tails. The man in the picture had red lashes all along his thighs, arse and back. The man seemed to be enjoying it, but Harry agreed. That wasn’t for him, at least not right away. Maybe once they’d eased into it, and only if Malfoy agreed to give it a go.
He needs to fight this. He needs to stand up and yell and scream and fight for his man.
“I think we have to break into Gringotts.”
“You make it so easy,” Potter mumbled, so soft Draco could barely make out the words.
She didn’t know what had happened; Draco could tell as much from her confused expression. She guessed, maybe. But for some reason, she didn’t bring it up, didn’t probe him for answers. He was grateful for the space.
Draco sat, and Potter sat beside him, and Draco rather thought Potter was wrong—he
And then they were in their room, and the door was closed, and Draco was
Draco waved in his pinboard while they were talking and marked off the final—or ninety ninth, technically—debt owed. A warm pool of contentment settled in his chest; he’d done it. One more to go: just this blasted curse with its notation on his board exasperatingly free of any connecting ties, and he would be free. He would never succumb to the horrifying tuberculosis-ridden end his father had chosen.
Draco bit his thigh again. “I didn’t catch that.”
Harry frowned. “Surely they—”
a blood curse, and those don’t need a casting. It’s blood to blood.”
“Of course. I just… I just need to talk to you.”
“What if you could. Know what it was like. Sex, I mean.”
That’s what he and Malfoy were for. Harry had to stop the curse; Malfoy had to cure it. But they were only given two days interaction with the artefacts suspected of causing it, and they couldn't go home until fourteen days of quarantine at a Ministry facility. Harry had received special permission to quarantine back at home… but that was a whole other thing.
“I know! This is awful!” Draco wiped happy tears away from his face, unable to look away from the sight of the egg-covered kids.
completely certain?” Potter repeated drily.
Blaise frowned. “Your feelings are always important,” he said softly. “And you understand that this is going to take a toll on you, right?”
His eyes snapped open and he found Malfoy watching him, still lying so close that his breath was ghosting across Harry’s side.
“Not stupid.” Malfoy’s voice sounded strangled, and when Harry looked up, he swore Malfoy was standing closer.
His honesty drew forth a strange hitch of breath from Potter, and the judgement, bizarrely, disappeared.
And the pieces were slowly sinking into place.
“There. Good as new.” There was a smile in her voice, but it was tinged with anxiety.
They fell into silence before Blaise gave a little sigh and spoke again. “He’s using you to cope; that’s normal. You’d be better equipped to handle this if you’d spoken to a professional when I told you to, but it’s certainly not too late to start, Draco.”
Draco’s chest filled with warmth that had nothing to do with the crackling fire in front of them. The thought that Potter enjoyed his company enough to waste hours of time together made his inner eleven-year-old dance with glee.
Draco mulled it over. After so long racing against the clock—to live, to save his family, to save Potter—it was difficult to identify the feeling, but eventually he did. Everything about the curse, about his destiny, had so far been a mounting pile of problems. Even the good parts were still something new added to a pile of stuff that got taller and taller and wobblier and wobblier. Knowing Harry was with him for good didn’t feel like one more thing to add to the pile; it felt like the pile had disappeared. Like time no longer existed, and fate was something he could choose.
Harry had ignored it—mostly. He took note, raised his eyebrows here and there, but Malfoy was just a footnote in his hectic daily life, and he had never bothered to think about it too deeply.
“You commissioned it,” Draco insisted. “You must have.”
Draco laid their two wands side by side and studied them. “Phoenix feather?” he asked, glancing at Harry.
He hadn’t even touched Malfoy, and Malfoy was already proving to be the best partner Harry had ever had.
Hermione,
“It’s hardly my fault.”
“I didn’t—” he began, and then tried to think how to phrase ‘I didn’t mean to leave you out’ without sounding like a twat.
Draco turned out the lights and went to sleep.
The question was: did he want it enough to turn this down? Were his principles too high? Was his self-respect so strong that he would refuse a night of comfort in Potter’s arms—willing, enthusiastic,
Potter grinned at him. “Are you sure? I hear there’s a really good wall just behind me.”
“At first, we thought you had an elaborate scheme going,” Pansy said, her eyes fixed on Draco. “But there were too many details that you couldn’t have faked.”
The second he wrapped his hands around his cock, he was gone. Malfoy’s eyes met his, dropped lower to where Harry was palming himself, and suddenly Harry could feel the weight of that gaze like hands on his skin. It was electrifying. He bit down on the knuckles of his left hand and closed his eyes, focusing on the way his fingers slid slowly up and down over skin that was slick with pre-come.
Pansy sighed. “It’s never that easy, not when it matters. Did you try to do what you thought was right?”
“We’re all right, George,” Potter said with a grin. “Won’t be much longer now.”
Harry swallowed and shifted in his chair. Draco’s eyes dropped lower, to the slight bulge at the front of Harry’s black jeans.
He felt again that overwhelming certainty that no one in the school knew how he felt, that he was alone, completely alone. He felt the cool grip of the sink beneath his fingers and thought about how he had never been offered a turning point, and even if one came now, it was too late. He had been led down this path from birth, and by the time he had realised how to think for himself it had been too late. No one had cared enough to question it, to think of a way to offer a child a solution that hadn’t meant disowning his family and everything he loved. No one had cared enough to try.
“Take a second, Potter. Take a really long second.”
, and just because you don’t personally give a shit doesn’t mean you can act like this is all one big game with marks on your pretty bloody scoreboard.”
Draco’s heart thudded. The sensation in his chest from earlier tugged again, and he fought the urge to cough. “We’re running out of time,” he said, glancing at the hourglass.
Harry starts to explain about the giant jellyfish theory, but Draco cuts him off.
He rolled them carefully back and stared in horror for several moments. He could feel Potter shaking with laughter beside him.
Something soft hit his face, and he opened one eye to find a pillow as his only protection from Potter’s glare.
“Right.” Potter pushed off from the desk. “Let’s get back to your flat and make a start.”
Harry sipped his drink and tried not to smile. It was the first time Draco had seen his flat, and Harry was suddenly pleased with the careful choices he’d made when decorating the place. He hadn’t done it for the prestige of owning something bespoke; he’d done it because of the enjoyment he got out of supporting local artisans—wizard and muggle alike. Every time he looked at the coffee table or the ceramic bowl on top of it, he’d think of the people who made them, their lives, their stories.
“Do you like anything?”
Potter shrugged and waited for him to go on.
“Table for two?” The waitress smiled at them, smoothing down the checkered apron she wore over her black trousers and shirt. It wasn’t quite the homely Muggle look Draco was used to, but it was strangely endearing.
Was it Draco’s imagination, or had Potter’s voice dropped half an octave?
But that was it, wasn’t it? There was no easy way out of this one. Draco was fucked no matter what he did, because
“You didn’t seem to mind,” Potter replied, taking a long pull from his glass and letting his eyes roam across Draco’s body.
“What do you remember?” Potter asked hesitantly, confirming that he had witnessed Draco’s dream. “Did we change the past?”
Draco started moving, short, rocking thrusts that he built up to long, languid ones. Faster than he’d been expecting, his perception of weirdness turned into something else that felt pleasant, like he could sustain himself on Draco’s gentle movements forever if he wanted.
“Where did you two meet?” he asked in an effort to change the subject.
He took a sip of his whiskey, opting for casual even though he was practically vibrating with a sense of anticipation, of urgency.
But then… this feeling wasn’t exactly new. And now that it was back, he was quietly stunned he had ever forgotten it. He closed his eyes, wincing as the familiarity of it sunk into his skin. It had to be the curse, warping his mind and replacing cultivated disdain with curiosity, but he couldn’t deny that his Hogwarts days had been marked with a similar curiosity. An obsessive, furious curiosity that he really did not need to see start up again in his late twenties.
When they realised, George quickly withdrew the product line and began tweaking the samples, muttering quietly to Harry and Ron when Molly wasn’t listening that he was planning on a new range for adults. Under the counter, so to speak.
one in an embarrassingly long time. The only possible way that I could have this is if something happened in the last twelve hours and I

sick, he couldn’t even get out of bed.”
There was an audible click as the door at the end of the corridor unlocked.
“Like what?” Malfoy asked, a deep frown etching into his forehead.
Draco scoffed. “Care? About the Weasley brood? Absolutely not. About upholding the credibility and reputation of my name and profession? Of course.”
“You are,” Draco stressed, enunciating very carefully, “a total imbecile.”
Dearest Harry,
No, he was not too old. Not when the catalyst in question had the ability to regress him right back to the age of eleven without even being present. How dare Potter even
“Harry,” Draco hissed, urgently now.
Something in his face must have twigged for Draco, or maybe it was just catching, but in the next moment, he let out a small huff, and then another that turned into a chuckle, and soon he was laughing right along with Harry.
He threaded his fingers through Potter’s hair and looked down into eyes that were dark and hooded. Holding him still, he began to pump slowly, rhythmically, until Potter’s eyes were closed in unfathomable ecstasy and he spilled over, crying out “Harry” just like he did in his most secret of fantasies.
“Is there a reason for the double act?” he asked.
“Well, it was!” Harry retorted cleverly. “Don’t tell me it felt exactly the same for you as when you do it yourself. It was better, right? Different.”
“Yeah, Ron,” Harry looked behind him into the corridor. “Didn’t the elves bring your stuff up?”
“Merlin, have you seen the luggage Lavender’s brought with her?” Neville’s voice sounded from the corridor, just before he rounded the corner and came to an alarmed halt in the doorway. “Oh. What’s going on?”
Draco reeled from the new information. Still, Potter’s opinion didn’t sit entirely well with him.
Draco frowned. “Why don’t you just do that then?”
“That’ll be George and Morgan,” Potter said, leaving the workroom to go open the front door, as if he owned the place. “I asked them here so that if something went wrong when we opened the box, they could get help.”
George had considered removing the flaw while enhancing the tactility of the experience, but strangely enough, it was harder to give yourself over to the daydream when it was limited to the mind’s eye and invisible touches. It was too obviously fake. When the vision was right there in the room with you, it was easier to lie to yourself, to pretend that what was happening was real. All the product testers had unanimously agreed that it was worth the risk of exposing yourself, and in a way, the increased need for privacy made the experience seem even more real.
“I can do a test on these to make sure there is no lingering danger,” Draco offered. “Then, perhaps George won’t have any issues with his stock or personal mail.”
The first time Harry took his hand while they were walking out of the Great Hall, where anyone could see them, Draco’s whole body stiffened in shock. But then, slowly, he forced himself to relax, and when he turned to smile at Harry, it felt like the room had suddenly grown both lighter and warmer. After that, every time Harry looked at him, there was a secret smile on his face. Harry was fairly sure it looked exactly like his own.
“You don’t mind that I just called you Draco, do you?” he asked quietly. It was meant to be just between them, but he was very aware of Ron and Hermione a metre away, who were probably able to hear everything they said.
“I think I might.”
“I wasn’t sure how far I’d want to go, or if I’d like any of it,” Harry went on, tracing small circles across Draco’s back. He laughed suddenly. “And you were a surprise.”
“Bit late in the game for that isn’t it?” Malfoy shot, acid in his tone. “The way I hear it, you’ve fucked your way through half the wizards in London. If you’re still confused after that, I’m afraid I can’t help you.”
“Unless,” he said slowly. “That’s not quite what you meant?”
It was old, years old, and frayed at the edges. Both ends were damaged, as though each side had tried to pull the knot free over the years without ever succeeding.
He wonders how long it will take before Draco packs his things and leaves. As he stares at the ticking clock above the door at work, he thinks perhaps he should prepare himself for the likelihood that Draco isn’t there when he gets home. It would be the easiest way for both of them.
He straddled Harry, Vanishing the mess of with a wave of his hand and sliding their mouths together with unbridled desire. He kissed like it was the first time, like it was the last time, and Harry drowned in it without ever thinking to come up for air.
from the desk. It flew over obediently and he leafed through the pages with his free hand until he found the one he wanted.
“Well, you said I didn’t respect you, for a start.”
When the family had dispersed, Draco asked the nurse if he could speak to the Healer in charge. He felt Potter join him as they were led down the corridor to a small office, its door decorated in festive tinsel and marked with a wreath in the centre.
“I spelled it clean first!” Draco insists. “Merlin knows I’m not drinking from some stranger’s stinking footwear.”
would never let me live it down if they caught wind. The guest room is down the hall.”
He found himself ruminating on what Potter had said earlier today, what he’d been afraid of. Perhaps Potter’s ‘ordinary life’ lacked this level of friendship as well. Maybe this was his awkward way of saying that he enjoyed Draco’s company and wanted to have more of it.
Ron and Harry shared a look. “Yeah,” they both replied, in equal tones of dread.
Draco sighs. “You’re no fun to tease anymore. You don’t rise to the bait like you did when we were children.”
but he spooks so easily, Blaise. I tried to bring up the idea of therapy and he nearly attacked me!”
Then he asked, “Do you want to forgive me?”, as though that were all it took.
He leans up, brushing his lips against Malfoy’s. They’re warm and full, and for all the hundreds of flowery descriptions he’s read in romance novels, they taste like skin. It’s intoxicating. Pressed so close together, he can smell the subtle scent that is uniquely Malfoy—no cologne, no deodorant, just him, clean and rich.
Granger blinked in surprise. “Apologise? Whatever for?”
them—and they’ve made me see the world a little differently. When I saw you before, I was still stuck in survival mode, I think. But that doesn’t allow for compassion.” He took a breath. “I had to learn compassion with... with this man. It feels different now. I’ve spent so long trying to convince them that change is possible that I think I accidentally convinced myself along the way.”
“There’s our first pathway.” Draco couldn’t contain a smile. “I have to say, I had been imagining I would use this powder to illuminate the veins of a leaf, or the framework of a cupboard, or something equally simple to observe.”
When the doors to the Great Hall came into view, Harry tried again.
Eventually, he’d run so far he’d ended up here. He hadn’t intended to keep searching for therapists, but he’d found one all the same. In the middle of a night quite similar to this one, he’d sent up a beacon from his wand. It wasn’t meant to reach anyone—didn’t even mean anything. It was just a bright, golden light full of glittering blue stars, filling a tiny corner of the sky above France. He’d lit up the night for hours, lying on the top of these apartment roofs while confused Muggles crowded below and tried to work out where the fireworks were coming from.
Potter’s eyes ran over him, and Draco swallowed. There was something heated in them now, even more so than in the brief glance last night.
“I don’t know,” he said, voice full of regret. “I’ll have to turn it over to Robards and find some other way to make a difference. I can’t stay there.”
Potter continued, unaware. “Did you know how well he
The look Malfoy gave him spoke volumes, but when he responded, it was timidly, like he was admitting something private: “I think it would be easy to convince myself it hadn’t really happened if it was just for the summer.”
“Years,” Draco said lightly as he threw it back. “I like it here.”
By the time their session ended, the sun had long since set, and Draco felt lighter.
“Use a Pensieve.”
“Er. That’s alright?”
“The man’s a moron.” Draco was surprised at the venom in his own voice. “Did you tell him you’d addressed all his issues?”
favourite team, and Harry generally told Ron everything. Some things. Most things.
At least they’d have to quarantine after this, so they couldn't infect anyone else. Harry was only risking his own health. Malfoy could make his own choices.
Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest. Maybe there was another path. Maybe what they were building had been real after all and they could turn it into something solid, something with the power to rescue Potter without destroying Draco in the process.
And then, suddenly, he’s there. The city of the Gold Coast lives up to its name; it’s golden and busy and full of bustling crowds in a way that is subtly different to anything he’s used to. He’s surrounded by tanned skin and people walking the streets in bikinis. The barbecues across the road from the beach are sizzling away with sausages, punctuated by the crisp sound of cider caps being popped no more than two feet away from a No Alcohol sign.
Massaging his temple, he tried to think once more of the box and the carefully wrapped gifts inside. He felt a surge of curiosity, but even as the box morphed into the cursed package, his curiosity remained warm and safe.
Ron made a face as if to say, “but it’s
“Besides,” he muttered, sliding his chair closer to get a better look at the page Malfoy had stopped to look at in greater depth. “I
And there was the conversation with Granger. She’d said he hadn’t changed. Granger was smart; surely, she’d know if Potter carried this much damage from the war. So, if that was the case, what did it all
“I wonder if Rita will be spying tonight,” Draco mused, mind racing with scandalous rumors they could spread through the pub, tailored for the reporter’s ears.
“How did you shape up after the pub last night?” Draco asked, his voice deliberately low and sultry for the benefit of anyone who was listening.
“I swear, Malfoy, you’d take offence at a brick wall.”
“No.” Draco shook his head. “The past can’t be changed.”
His reactions made Harry feel powerful. He didn’t have much patience for foreplay; however, the idea of going all the way,
Potter knew exactly what he meant.
Draco opened his mouth to answer and then frowned. “Well, because they’re so familial. It’s all about defending their bloodline with the harshest justice possible, and you don’t get much harsher than a scorned lover. Which then proves the Veela’s loyalty to their flock: they’ll destroy their own soulmate if that’s what it takes to defend the territory.”
It must have shown in his face, because Malfoy just nodded. “And I can’t get anyone to fetch it for me, because my apartment is warded to hell and back.”
And then, Merlin help him, they’d be back at Draco’s flat, locked in his workroom, working together.
Harry nodded slowly, incapable of anything else because his mouth was still full of mashed potato. He forced himself to chew and swallow.
Draco’s stomach did a little flip for no reason that he could identify, but outwardly he didn’t move a muscle. After a moment, he asked, “Can we?”
to see Malfoy, if only so he could have a chance at hexing the git. But he remembered how Malfoy had waited for him when they’d left the Hall, how he’d hovered, almost nervously, while Harry chatted with everyone. He remembered the look on Malfoy’s face when Harry had followed the rest of them into their rooms, and how he’d melted into the darkness before Harry could think of how to phrase the question of whether Malfoy wanted to come in with them, let alone figure out if Harry wanted him to.
“Shit, do we have to go back?” Potter asked with a wry grin, stepping back nonetheless.
On the plus side, their investigations allowed Malfoy to develop a potion that would allow the infected to pass from their frozen state into an ordinary spell sleep. But they couldn't yet wake up. On the other hand, prodding at the hex and the hexer like they had meant a whole new spate of infections popped up across Scotland, and Harry wasn’t sure how much more he could take.
“Should I go?” Draco asked, hesitation in his voice.
“Therapy can take years,” Eleanor said when he expressed this to her. “And our relationship will change over time. We try to stay vague about this at the start. Can you imagine how you would have felt in those early days, if I’d told you there would be years of this?”
Draco couldn’t help the incredulous expression on his face. “You
when the rest of the world had always been so quick to tell him what he was without ever wanting to know… That hadn’t changed, not even a bit. Not even at all.
“I didn’t…” Draco trailed off, staring up at the cavernous ceiling of Blaise’s ballroom. He didn’t know why the fuck he’d led Blaise in here when he turned up in the Floo tonight. It just seemed like the best shot of being in a room where the walls didn’t feel like they were closing in. “I didn’t get help. You know how you told me to get help? I didn’t do it, and now he’s in trouble, and I think I need help.”
After an agonizing two minutes, Draco fled the room.
Draco stared at him, open-mouthed. “You really don’t think very highly of me, do you?”
“Now, now, Potter, don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re as smart as at least two brick walls.”
Slowly, Potter turned to face him. He blinked, like he’d only just realised Draco was here, and then his face changed. The vacant stare fell away and his face broke into a smile. If it wasn’t for the sweat and his sickly pallor, Draco would have thought he’d imagined the whole thing.
“Are you done?” he asked, his voice chillingly cold.
Potter smiled at him, radiant like the sun. “You think so?”
And despite all that Draco had assumed, Potter was equally lost, too.
And he stumbled, the earth catching him as he fell, branches snagging on his clothing, before the dream faded away.
Malfoy laughed—a sound Harry had never heard from him before—and pushed Harry back down into the pillows. His mouth on Harry’s was more teeth than lips, vicious as he unashamedly took what he wanted; Harry gave it all. He let his head sink back into the softness of the bed while Malfoy took him apart, laving a path down his chest, over his ribs, and onto his cock.
“Well,” Draco said. “You?”
“I thought it might be fun to spice things up a bit. Don’t you think?” He pushes Harry back down onto the bed.
“When I looked at you, though,” Potter continued suddenly, standing straighter, “that’s when I knew. I feel whole when I’m with you.”
As it happened, she arranged an extra session in her schedule to see him the next day. When he woke up to her ferret Patronus skittering about the living room, he’d just about cried from relief. He hadn’t known how much he was holding onto until that moment.
He cracks an eyelid. What in Merlin’s name is a shooey? A crowd of lads in their twenties are circling around something by the water, and Harry climbs back onto his feet to investigate. When he gets close enough to see—one of the lads immediately draws him in with an arm over Harry’s shoulder like he’s one of them—he realises they’re surrounding another bloke who appears to be drinking something out of a shoe.
“I’m not a bloody idiot, Ron,” Potter hissed into a device on his wrist. Draco hadn’t noticed it before, assuming Potter was simply wearing a watch. “I know there’s something bigger at work here. I’m not going to fall into it just because it’s knocking on my door.”
How must it feel to believe Fate is making you forgive the one person you shouldn’t?
He really did need something for the children, and damned if he was going to be outdone by Pansy’s electric eel, whatever the hell that was. But aside from the gift-hunting, Pansy had told him she had heard Potter mention, offhand, that he would be back tomorrow to help unpack the new stock.
“When you grow up beneath my father’s thumb, Potter, you learn a thing or two about how to manipulate people. The question that remains is how you choose to equate that possibility with your own morality.”
Harry was sure he’d come any moment with how hard he was. There was bound to be a puddle in his pants from how much he’d already leaked. It was crazy how arousing Malfoy was when he wasn’t even doing anything.
There was very little Draco could do to turn the tide of the war, not with all he had so far done. But he could perhaps do one thing. He could get Potter out of here before the Dark Lord came.
“Are you all right?” he asked, the words dropping from his lips before he could rethink them.
“Merlin, no!” he nearly shouted, paling at the thought. He’d probably have had a fit if he had. Hermione might’ve had an apoplexy. Ron would surely have died if he found out. The thought of it had him squirming uncomfortably in his chair. “No offense, and I’m not ashamed, but I don’t really want to think about Ron or Hermione knowing about
Malfoy’s eyes met his, loaded with meaning. “The door, the words on the parchment… It’s been antagonising us from the start. It’s constant, dynamic… tailored precisely for us. To get us in the same room because it knows that’s the best way we’ll piss each other off. How many magical spells do you know that do
Harry was unappreciative of the blatant sarcasm.
Potter laughed. “Maybe. I’m thinking of quitting my job.”
the book said helpfully. Harry made the effort to inhale slowly through his nose and read on:
“No it’s not! Look, it’s just gonna bounce right back at you!”
Very quickly, it became apparent that the angle they were working with wasn’t to their advantage. The bed was too low or Harry was too tall, and he couldn’t go very far without having to bend his knees uncomfortably or hunch awkwardly over Draco.
“You saw it in the dream?” Draco asked flatly, studying the creature although it made no move towards them.
“Talk about what?” Potter asked, leaning into his space. “What I’m going to do to you the second you say yes?”
with the need to push Potter down onto the bed and explore him with unhurried ease. He wanted to take Potter apart until Potter’s eyes were closed and he’d sunk back into the mattress with the blissful headiness of sex that was poised on the edge of sleep.
Malfoy met Harry’s eyes and nodded.
“I wasn’t sure,” Malfoy admitted. “But…”
This time, Draco jolted at the sight. Up until now, he had been astutely avoiding Potter’s gaze, lest the spell ignite the second stage. After the feather confession and smug pulling of rank, he was so pissed off he didn’t care. As Potter grinned, Draco met his gaze evenly, and this time he saw what was underneath.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice was strange, and Draco’s eyes snapped open to see a peacock feather floating between them.
Draco knew what almost none of those words meant, but he shook his head. “I want to help,” he said, and found it—for the first time—to be true.
Miles’ face fell. “Knocked back?”
Neville nodded furiously. “Let’s just keep to our side, yeah?”
“You didn’t what?” Malfoy prompted, a strange tone to his voice.
Appropriate mate loosely translated to: the Veela most likely to tear the victim’s heart out.
Tan fingers reached across the table and squeezed Draco’s hand gently. “Absolutely,” he agreed with a warm smile. “Whatever you need.”
Like blood pulsing in a vein.
Prophetic.
“Don’t!” Draco whirled around and glared at him. “You’ve said your part, now do as you like to so eloquently put it—shove a sock in it. What am I looking at?”
He didn’t want a chance, anyway.
Draco’s eyes land on Harry and grow wide with desperate relief. “Potter!” he yells and scrambles forward to grab Harry by the collar of his shirt. “Save me!” he hisses.
Harry looked up, face bright with hope, but then he froze as his eyes landed on something behind Draco’s head. “Nearly.”
“No. Draco,” Malfoy said, teasing himself languidly. He repeated his name, drawing out the vowels, and Harry couldn’t tell if the exaggeration was because stroking himself felt too good, or because he felt Harry was just that stupid. “Draaaaaacooo.”
Malfoy,
“You’ve no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that,” he gasps, dropping lower to mouth at Draco’s neck.
Stomach sinking, Harry stuffed the parchment into the pocket of his robes and backed away. It must be a new symptom which meant Harry was likely infected, and…
“Because,” Draco said drily, looking up at him like he was explaining something very simple to a young child. “My wand’s core is a unicorn hair. Do you know why unicorn hair is so sought after in potions and transfiguration?”
“Do you have any plans tonight?”
Harry’s leg was jiggling. Draco rested his hand on it, but he kept fidgeting even still.
Harry looked over at Malfoy, who appeared to not be paying attention.
“What’s happened?” Blaise asked, like the traitor he was.
Malfoy looked up, his face a mask of shock. “The
The polite chatter of the professors welcoming Malfoy filtered around him, and he focused on cutting into his desert, consuming it bite by bite. It wasn’t until someone began waving something in his face that he realised he was being spoken to.
He’d crept around his property after midnight for Merlin’s sake. Would it have killed him to knock on the door once and say,
Draco nodded, and Harry slipped out, dropping down beside him on the bed.
A hex that didn’t actually want them to reach those heights. Pushed them not to get them there, but to see if they
One of Draco’s hands started wandering up his chest, pausing to play with his nipples before continuing on to explore the sweaty planes of his chest and back down to his abdomen. Harry twitched and all of his muscles seemed to clench every time he hit upon a sensitive spot, of which there seemed to be many more than he remembered.
“You know, what look are we going for? Are we secretly pining for each other? Is it a slow transformation from friends to lovers?” Potter winked. “Angry sex?”
Potter ignored him. “We went in to make sure we hadn’t missed anything. Then, we came out early, and didn’t leave any important notes to ourselves. Logically, it was probably fine.”
“Your hair might look like it’s been plucked for broom bristles, but the just-shagged look suits you. It suits you so well, I just want to shove you up against a wall and take you apart whenever I see you.”
Their lips curved together, warm and soft. The conversation fell away, replaced by the gentle heat of their languid exploration. Harry shifted his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, running his fingers across bare skin and tugging at his waist band questioningly.
He took a few deep breaths, because the last thing he needed was the curse to infect him—not that it really mattered, he supposed, since it wasn’t a curse after all and Harry was summarily useless. Nonetheless. In… and out…
It was a horrible, useless circle. They couldn’t get their memories back without the original cursed item, fully intact. They couldn’t get the item without their memories.
Potter yelped in triumph. “It’s working!”
For the most part, Potter didn’t even acknowledge their argument. There had been a small moment there where Draco thought he might be getting the cold shoulder, but then Granger had bumped into them and received the same treatment. He decided then that it must simply be that Potter’s bad mood had not yet evaporated.
Granger looked up with an indignant frown, but the moment she laid eyes on Draco her expression softened. She put down her parchment and smiled at him.
Draco blinked in surprise, momentarily taken aback.
“I don’t think I really want to try toys just yet,” he said, leafing through the next several pages of toys that looked more and more like torture devices in all their wicked styles and colours. Something that was called
Potter wouldn’t look at him. He stared mutely ahead, eyes blazing. “Why are you even here, Malfoy? We’re not
He unscrewed the lid of the container, took a pinch of the purple dust, and blew gently onto the largest gear.
If you want it to be, this will be my last letter. I don’t know what’s going on with you—why you’ve left England, or why you’re so hot and cold all of a sudden. Actually, it’s not really all of a sudden, I suppose… Anyway. I don’t know what’s happening or why I’m involved, but I do know why I haven’t left yet.
He heard Potter give a soft laugh and withdraw his fingers, and then he could feel Potter’s cock pushing in. Strong hands gripped his ankles, massaging gently and pulling them up so they were braced firmly on the bed. He gasped as Potter lifted his hips, propping him up so that his arse rested on Potter’s thighs. It was a more intense angle, and when Potter started to move in a slow, controlled slide, his hands fell away from the headboard to cling to the sheets beneath him and he bit down on his lip to keep from crying out.
Through the haze of lust, Draco could hear that something was off about Potter’s voice. There was a darkness there, more than just the heady tide of desire. Potter was losing himself in this, giving over to the need, the
He first touched Malfoy’s stomach with his other hand, splaying his fingers wide and just feeling the motion of his breathing and the sporadic twitches as he moved at a quick, unrelenting pace.
Draco wasn’t sure how the rest of the night passed; he was powerless to focus on it. Drinks were set in front of him, laughter surrounded him, conversations ebbed and flowed, but it was as if every second was transient, lacking connection with the seconds before and after. The only constant was Potter, and Draco was drowning in him.
in a relationship with Malfoy?
He wanted to make a quip about how many curses the Ministry inflicted on its Unspeakables for training, if Potter could identify them by feeling, but judging by the look on Potter’s face he didn’t want the answer.
“What the fuck happened to the furniture?” He doesn’t mean to say it like that, but his heart is racing, and the impromptu date from last Friday has suddenly settled into an awful sort of context.
“I’m fairly certain you faced a hurdle or two when you took down Lord Voldemort,” Draco drawled, searching for that cutting tone that would rile Potter just enough to make him lash out rather than run. “It didn’t stop you then. What’s the difference now?”
Draco stopped and stared at her, but there was no shrewdness in her gaze, no strategic calculation. Her expression was uncharacteristically open.
“Aah, there’s my Slytherin boy.” Pansy reached across the table to pat Draco’s hand affectionately. “I knew you hadn’t gone far.”
“Please,” he murmured, just when Draco wasn’t sure he could wait any longer.
Their eyes met, and Draco felt the cold, icy fingers of dread creeping up his chest as he realised there was a good possibility that, even if they survived whatever the curse did, he and Potter would never remember this.
The bedroom was tiny. It made sense, Harry supposed. There hadn’t been time to focus on luxuries—only the essential. Decision after decision, each made with no time, no precedent. But then, it had been that way during the battle too…
He doused the flames with a poorly aimed Aguamenti, soaking the walls and half the window, and held his glass out for Pansy to pour him a new drink.
“It…” Harry began, and he wasn’t even sure what he was saying. He kept saying it anyway. “It shouldn’t matter in here, right? I mean, we get quarantined anyway, after.” He wasn’t making sense. Worse—he wasn’t making sense, and he was
Draco had said he’d learn to live with him, and, well, Harry was quite alright with that. He could learn to live with Draco, too. Though, maybe not without insisting he wear socks to bed.
She smiled sadly. “Sorry, Harry, Draco. I have to go. I know where they’ve taken him, and only I can get him back.”
“And how will you do that?” he pressed, failing to keep the smugness from his tone.
Neither he nor Potter were responsible for those words, and Draco’s blood chilled as the voice—sounding like infinite skies and the howl of wind around mountains—washed over him.
“And you—
“I have one idea,” Draco said slowly. “And I think we should discuss a time frame as well.”
“They just keep growing,” Harry said, the smile stretching into an enormous grin.
“Not exactly,” Draco said, feeling a little foolish in light of what he was undoubtedly intruding on. “I guess I just wanted to apologise.”
Not with how they were throwing anyway.
Draco sighed. “It’s not just about the bet,” he confessed.
Harry laughed and gestured to the paper. “Does it win?”
“Still up for a late-night planning session?”
Potter twisted his finger deeper, slid another one in alongside it. “I’m sure.”
Draco frowned. “When did you hurt me?”
“Accidentally,” Harry clarified, his voice dull to his own ears. “She probably doesn’t even know she’s doing it.”
. Now. This.
Harry made a mental note to remember that, to tease Draco’s hips and thighs later on, and dropped back down to straddle his legs.
Malfoy made a tired noise behind him, and when Harry turned around, he noted that Malfoy did not look like someone who had watched bees all afternoon. Black circles rimmed his eyes, and there was an edge of terror in the whites of his eyes. Harry crossed the balcony quickly and cleared the small table they had been using for their meals. In perfect timing, the house-elves sent up the plates, and Harry made sure that Malfoy got his first.
“Everything all right?” he asked, clearing his throat and wondering what to do with his hands.
“It’s not a competition,” Harry said with a soft smile.
Draco paused for a beat in surprise before falling into the topic with enthusiasm. By the time they’d finished talking, they’d made it around the lake three times. Draco checked his watch. It was lunch time, but he didn’t want to push this. It was still so new.
“Wow,” Harry said what felt like an eternity later, stretched out beside Malfoy. “So that’s the prostate.”
Potter was right—of course. There was something there… Something deeper than the outer urges to hunt and kill.
Slowly, he grins. “Never mind.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I mean before that.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. A throbbing headache had just started up in his temple.
He warred with the idea of just ignoring it, of pretending he hadn’t noticed and waiting to see if anything came of it without his interference, but he’d had enough of letting everyone else lead him around. He wanted an answer.
Harry looked up, trying to read the expression on Malfoy’s face. “Would it be alright if we only did that? Slept, I mean?”
But he isn’t complaining. Draco’s face goes soft, his expression open with want and something bordering on disbelief. His lips are parted just enough that Harry can hear the small gasps of breath escaping him, the tiny whimpers as he positions Harry exactly where he wants him.
Then he was going to give Potter the flat he deserved. He was going to purchase light curtains for the windows and a big, cushy sofa for the living room. He was going to commission artwork for the walls and buy stupid Muggle appliances so that Potter wouldn’t have to use the same pot for every single meal.
She glared at him for long moments before finally nodding. He moved to go back inside, but she stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
He runs his tongue along them, and Harry realises that they are just as shiny with saliva as they are with Harry’s come, and the thought nearly sends him over again. He slides his hand to the back of Malfoy’s neck, relishing the way the skin is slightly damp with sweat, and grips him, not hard enough to hurt but firm enough to hold him steady. He’s not sure what Malfoy sees in his eyes when he turns back, but something there makes his breath hitch, and then he is coming, thrusting into his own hand and crying out.
I haven’t been doing any of that!”
Draco looked up at him. “That’s usually how it goes,” he admitted. “The fall is so gradual it’s impossible to notice until after.”
Morgan glared at him. “Three hours.”
“Arse. Please. Please, Draco.”
“Against all odds,” Pansy went on, her lips quirking into a reluctant smile. “You two are good for each other. I never would have believed it, but you seem to be in the depths of a healthy, mature relationship. Congratulations, boys. Shall we head to
Ron’s laugh was too loud in the library. It filled the echoey room unnaturally.
“So I’m a problem now?”
“Malfoy, I promise I’m going to do everything I can to look out for both of us. We’re in this together. But I’m not going to pretend our relationship is something it isn’t. That’s why you wanted me as your anchor, isn’t it? Because you can trust that everything I say to you is honest, and because you don’t have to second guess anything I do?”
“What in the name of Merlin’s
“But…
He nodded, but just as he stood up to get back to work, Potter reached out and grabbed him by the wrist.
Potter checked his watch. “We were in there less than twenty minutes,” he said, confused. “I must have pulled us out early. Check your notes—what happened?”
of course.” He gave a mocking laugh. “But I’m sure there’s something in my
“Christ, Malfoy.” He coughed, stumbling through onto the carpet and rubbing the soot from his eyes. “Don’t you ever clean your Floo?”
Draco frowned. That almost sounded like… “How do I accept them?”
Harry
It was a box.
.” He took a step closer to Harry, so close his breath brushed over Harry’s skin and sent every nerve-ending into chaos.
“Other signs?”
“Why?” Harry asked, frowning, but pulled his wand out and handed it over all the same.
You’re right, Malfoy. It was beautiful.
“At this point, just let me concentrate.”
“I was getting around to it.”
Then, he remembered: of course, the Ministry had seized everything—but he had never thought someone he knew would read it. Potter knew what Draco had done, what had been done to him. It felt like everything inside Draco had been stirred up, scraped out, and laid down for everyone to see. He was hollow, and all because Potter couldn’t differentiate between brutal honesty and genuine evil.
Potter bucked beneath him, surging forward to meet Draco’s lips. Draco braced his hands against Potter’s inner thigh and began to set a steady rhythm, laving the soft skin with his tongue again and again while Potter writhed beneath him. The sounds he was making had turned from rough and sensual to downright filthy—whines mixing with muffled curses as Potter turned his head and bit down on the pillow.
Pansy gave a fake gasp and fluttered her hand over her chest. “How very un-Slytherin of you. Clearly, you’ve been spending too much time with this Gryffindor lunkhead.”
Harry bit back another groan and slowed down.
“No,” Harry said with a smile. “Those are for the Weasleys.”
It has been a privilege to know you, Potter. In whatever sense that may mean. I wish you the very best in your life. It is a shame we were never friends, but some things aren’t meant to be.
Potter shrugged. “I just—” He stopped, Quaffle poised above his shoulder. “Don’t you ever feel lost out here, all on your own? You’ve only got yourself for company.”
“I figured it was pretty obvious by the titles. I did some research. I wanted to be prepared, too.”
All those families. Everything he’d done wrong. How could he ever deserve to let it go? One hundred lives, two hundred—how could his debt ever be repaid?
Eleanor nodded. “Absolutely.”
Suddenly, Draco remembered why he’d come here today. He lifted his head and gazed up at Harry, seeing his own languid affection mirrored in his lover’s face.
He made a noise of agreement. “We also found the source of the explosion. There are small mercurial readings, but they’re so negligible it looks like the explosion was only intended to draw attention.” He considered that properly for the first time, feeling suddenly lighter at what that news meant. “Which is an excellent result, Potter; it means that the explosion hasn’t done any curse damage at all. Whatever the curse’s purpose, I’d bet my money pouch that it lies within the box.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Yes, of course I know what you should be sorry for. I need to check if
Potter looked at him like he was barmy. “Truth? To what?”
“I was hurt.”
“Sorry, what?”
To his surprise, Malfoy smirked and reached for him, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist and turning them on the spot. When they reappeared on the roof, Harry staggered against Malfoy, fighting for balance as the sudden wind threatened to bowl him over.
Potter’s eyes lifted to his, flashing with something fierce—
He swallowed. The future opened up before him, and Draco suddenly felt more scared than he had in years.
Ron’s eyebrows rise, but he says nothing, just waits.
“I mean, I’m all for going at your own pace, but we are on something of a deadline.”
Draco couldn’t hold back a laugh when he saw it was a tiny anchor. “Subtle.”
Norman, it appeared, was a large mop with a fiery orange head, leaning upside down against the back wall with a bow tie stuck halfway up the handle.
“It seems that way,” Draco acknowledged reluctantly.
“Should we talk to them?” Hermione asked.
The contrast of his pale skin against the green bedspread was tantalising. Harry realised quite abruptly that he wanted to taste that skin: wanted to see if it really was as perfect as it looked, or if he could taste and feel the imperfections that were no doubt there.
The Manor disappeared in the blackened ink of Apparition, and solid ground found him standing before a beachside cottage, holding hands with Harry Potter.
After a while, Harry gave up and they fell into silence before it was time to return, unfortunately empty-handed.
Potter gave him a feral grin. “Don’t give me a sharp object.”
With a wave of his wand, he locks and secures the front door. When he blocks the Floo, Malfoy looks up at him with a knowing, hungry expression, and he can’t hold back any longer. He crosses the kitchen floor and brings his hands to Malfoy’s waist, pausing for the merest fraction of a second before resting them there. For a moment, he is overwhelmed with the desire to just rest his forehead against Malfoy’s and stay there, breathing in synchronisation until the weight of the day has drained away, but he doesn’t do it. He only has an hour, and that tiny action feels like too much, like it might break him with the strength of how much he wants it, how much he wishes it were real. It’s easier to keep this daydream to something he might have a chance of walking away from.
Spinning around, he ignores the startled protests behind him, runs onto the balcony, and jumps over the edge, Apparating just before he hits the ground.
Potter’s eyebrows shot up, incredulous. “You think I want to stay here with you? The curse is keeping me here!”
“Malfoy,” Potter mumbled, grasping for Draco and succeeding in wrapping the gilded lines of his collar around feeble palms. “Help me… It… It
Then, Draco shifted ever so slightly, hitched his hips up so they were partially suspended off the bed, and he started moving more energetically. The new angle had him brushing past Harry’s prostate, and he found himself moaning and squirming, trying to get more of it.
He could see his own weariness reflected on all their faces, and he wanted to speak, to make sure Potter was all right, but he knew that this part wasn’t for him.
after third year.”
George shrugged. “No one knows. It’s driving Ron crazy,” he broke off, his face a sudden mask of undisguised pain.
All the time, Draco realised silently, noting it with the same quiet sadness he noted all of the consequences his choices had led him to.
Draco laughed, the sound harsh and bitter. “Well if the curse is to be believed, it should be very easy to save us. You need to repay me for the wand you stole, and I need to accept your payment. If it’s that simple, why can’t we do it?”
It was odd. And the more Harry thought about it, the more pissed off he got. What right did Malfoy have to take this tragedy so casually? Just because he didn’t have anyone to care about. Just because he wasn’t personally affected.
This year, he was fairly certain her obsession had turned to bee-keeping, which Draco was at least seventy percent sure she had chosen mostly for shock value. Not that he’d tell her that, of course.
Draco’s cheeks flushed, and he looked away. “I don’t think that will work for what we want.” He cleared his throat. “Even if we do ignite rumors that we’re… together—”
“We’re not far from the end,” he said. “I’d say there are only one or two more mechanisms left. No need to open the box after all, thank Merlin, because I was having second thoughts.”
Blaise’s words were light, but his mouth was pursed into a tight line. He knew what was wrong. Any other person, and Draco would assume they were faking empathy, but with Blaise it was real. He’d clearly been asleep when Draco arrived, past midnight—probably enjoying an early night after his party the night before—and yet there was no sign of annoyance. He simply sat there in his white, silken robe and sleep-mussed hair, gazing at Draco and waiting.
Beneath the layers of confusion and rediscovered emotion in Harry’s head, a tiny sliver of understanding began to unfurl. “Continue what it was doing? What do you mean?”
“What type of arrangement are you considering?” Draco asked, leaning back against the bench. “The beginning of the relationship is going to be the hardest part to pull off, since they’re going to suspect something like this after they all laughed themselves stupid at the prospect the other night. Ideally, we’d have to begin the process of infatuation in front of them, but I don’t know how good an actor you are.”
Harry pushed himself back so that he was lined up between Draco’s legs and began to ease carefully forward until they found themselves back how they were before. He felt a flutter of anxiety to get it right this time.
“Potter,” Draco whispered, laying a hand on his arm.
Potter began to mumble a number of charms under his breath, firing off tests across every inch of space he could reach, and Draco followed suit. Before long, a picture began to emerge. It wasn’t a map, like Draco had hoped, but he hadn’t really expected one.
“If we can do that,” Draco finished. “Then Pansy will buy it.”
And Draco’s… Draco had never felt like this. So light and pure.
Draco smirked to himself, hiding it behind the cover of a book titled
Potter slowly nodded. Behind him, Draco could see a strange silver arch and a messy-haired man standing in front. The man’s eyes widened, but even as he cried out, Potter stayed looking at him, green eyes fixed to his.
“While you’ve already proven you don’t need it, yes, you have my permission. Just watch out for Igrelda. She bites.”
The gate of the Sanctuary creaked open in his dream, and he saw Potter tiptoe onto his property. Something looming and ancient surged within the cottage where Draco of the past slept, because this was clearly a memory—just not his own this time. Even though Potter of the present was nowhere to be seen or felt, and had not been since the Manor appeared.
“Writhing in paradoxical jealousy?” Draco offered, dropping his hands to Potter’s jeans. “But maybe we shouldn’t do this. There are more important things. And the anchor!” He was quite impressed with himself that his sentences were coming out with even an ounce of coherency. Ten points to him.
Draco lifted one shoulder in a shrug and turned away, poking his fork idly at the food on his plate. “I’d like your help nonetheless.”
—the air shifted strangely, as though time were slowing down, impeded by the fog of despair and unhappiness that permeated from Draco as he realised what was about to happen, how defenceless Potter was about to leave him—
“You’re a cruel, cruel man, Draco Malfoy,” he said miserably.
“You don’t trust anyone,” he guessed.
For a moment it felt like the walls were closing in. There was something in Potter’s voice, something that was all twisted in upon itself until there seemed no clear way free of the darkness. Was that really how Potter felt? Was that really how the
Perhaps he didn’t have his latent fantasies as under control as he’d thought. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He simply could not afford to deal with this right now—it was too dangerous to become distracted in here. In the same way that he’d pushed aside all unnecessary thoughts when the package had exploded, he pushed aside all thoughts of Potter. He would focus on what needed to be done, and that was it.
It was both practicality and believability that led them to choose the library as the location for their first date. They were able to continue the charade of Potter helping Draco with his security charms by doing research in a public space, but also give the carefully cultivated impression that there was chemistry between them.
Draco did. He really, really did.
It was through knowing and sharing himself that he finally found himself falling properly, completely, inevitably into love.
“Who can tell me the first safety rule on a broom?”
The strangeness was still there, evident in the slight fumbling of Potter’s movements, the awkward way he seemed to be unsure of where his body began and ended. Even with the warmth of conversation the two were sharing, Potter seemed absent, like the only moments he was truly here were when they were laughing over the bet. But it was superficial laughter—triumphant and proud, but barely cutting the surface. His eyes kept darting to the door and Draco realised he had chosen the seat against the wall. It sharpened his resolve to end this tonight.
“The one where you’re all ‘Harry Potter, Boy Hero’, to your friends, but ‘Harry Potter, Traumatised War Victim’, to me.”
Potter didn’t sound like he was even aware it was trauma. He sounded like he thought it was fact. Like he still believed the vicious words that had been said to him all those years ago. That explained why Granger wasn’t much help to him; this was just the Potter she’d known all along. A little rough around the edges, a little over-emotional, but competent and strong in spite of it all. He’d been like this since they were children; Draco didn’t blame Granger for being unable to see it with fresh eyes.
“Forget it.”
Draco eyed off the food, but found he wasn’t really in the mood for something so decadent. “Shall we go for a walk through the gardens?”
“Chin up.” Blaise patted him on the back. “The worst you can do is fuck everything up completely, and hey—you’re already doing that!”
Potter’s head snapped up. “What? What is it?”
“When I finally take you home, Potter, I want to devour you.”
As he thought the word, the dream folded around him like the warm haze of a cozy fire, and someone began to speak.
Merlin, the man may as well have told all of Diagon Alley that they were just faking it. A librarian passing by looked at them oddly but continued on without stopping, her trolley squeaking into the distance. This place wasn’t quite as hushed as the Hogwarts library, but Potter’s voice still travelled.
The streets were covered in a light, dusty snow when he left, and he found himself thankful for the extra scarf he’d thought to grab on his way out the door. Since his apartment wasn’t far from the Leaky Cauldron and the entrance to Diagon Alley, he opted to walk instead of Apparating, mostly in the hopes that it would clear his head enough that he could make sense of the last few hours. His mind was a swirl of horrible, festering emotion, and if he couldn’t clear it with a walk at least he could be certain to drown it with alcohol.
“So, I went after Potter,” he said pointedly.
“I’m sure whoever takes the case will be more than familiar with it,” he said, instead.
Draco stirred his ice cream around in his bowl with the spoon. It was already almost entirely liquid; warm swirls of what had once been chocolate icecream oozed sluggishly against his silverware. If he stopped stirring, he’d have to look up. If he looked up, he’d have to see Blaise’s face. If he saw Blaise’s face, he’d see just how soft and gentle Blaise was being with him, and
There was a lot, Draco realised, that he had missed over the years. And as tears slid down his own cheeks, memories overwhelming him—of Dobby sneaking him treats and helping him clean up messes he had accidentally made while his parents were out—he had the strange thought that those things may not have been so far out of reach as he had always assumed.
“There’s nothing here.” He held up the book, rifling through the pages in case he’d written elsewhere.
pay? I can’t afford
Malfoy reached out to him, and Harry flinched in surprise and a little alarm, but Malfoy only rested a hand on Harry’s knee and pushed down with gentle pressure. Harry realised that his knee had been jiggling. With great effort, he forced himself to stop; the world lurched unpleasantly.
Ron didn’t seem to notice.
Harry’s head drops back involuntarily at the soft moan that falls from Malfoy’s lips. In that second of distraction, when he is staring at the ceiling and wondering if he has taken the first step down the road to madness, he feels soft lips close around him.
There came a sound like someone’s hand clapping, perhaps on a shoulder, and Blaise said quietly. “Because the curse chose you both for a reason.”
Luna,
Harry shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
He did not need to ask to know the past had not been changed. His two opposing memories of the war ran alongside each other, but one was visceral, imprinted in the scars left behind on his body and the weariness in his hands. And the other was the golden memory of a dream, something that never happened.
He heard the sound of clothing rustling and something heavy hitting the floor, and just for a moment he froze as the mental image of Potter undressing and lying back on the ground, legs spread, hit him out of absolutely fucking nowhere. A terrified whimper escaped the back of his throat, and he whirled around in horror.
Love, Luna
“Why didn’t you try harder?” Draco asked before he could stop himself, acid in his words.
“Yeah.” Potter laughed again, more relaxed this time. “Fucking barmy, right? You’re the last person I’d ever expect to get infatuated with me. You scared the crap out of me for a second there.”
“You’re not so bad after all, Malfoy,” George said, clapping him on the back. “Harry was right.”
“I know,” Potter muttered.
“Oh no,” Evie shook her head. “We think she might be a Squib. Her sister showed signs of magic at four, and Emily’s nearly eight.”
“Did you find anything useful?” Draco asked, opting to ignore Potter’s vulnerable admission in the same way one might attempt to win over a wild animal by not looking at it straight on.
Draco peeled back Harry’s shirt and pressed slow kisses to Harry’s neck.
“What about you, Malfoy?” Ron asked, already halfway through a bottle of beer he’d pulled from somewhere. “What are you even studying?”
Potter swallowed, seeming to know exactly what Draco meant, but his answer hit a different note entirely. One Draco was not prepared for. “Malfoy, I never forgot you.”
George stuck his head around the door, grinning when he saw the two of them. Draco felt strangely off balance when he realised the smile was equally intended for him as for Potter.
The room was already dark. Harry undressed as quickly as he could, uncomfortably aware that Malfoy hadn’t closed his curtains, and hopped into bed. Minutes passed. The silence felt uncomfortably thick, in that way it did when two people were pretending to be asleep, but not trying particularly hard.
“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” Potter asked, before casting a couple of protection charms over the bead and slipping it carefully into his shirt pocket.
“Why do you call George and Ron by their first name?” he asked.
“Feels good,” Malfoy told him. His head was to the side, the long column of his neck exposed. He’d stopped stroking his prick vigorously in favour of shorter, more languorous pulls that were in time with Harry’s fingers moving in and out.
The distant lights from the city cast strange shadows on Malfoy’s face, shielding his eyes so that Harry couldn’t quite read Malfoy’s expression. Was he sure? Why wouldn’t he be sure? There were times when he did nothing for days at a time; of course he sat still.
“You’re sure you have the lubricant?” His nerves were getting the better of him. He’d read and reread the chapter in
“I want you,” Harry whispers.
magic. It’s why we use hair and feathers as wand cores rather than blood. We don’t need it. When Veela blood takes hold…” He swallowed. “It feels raw. Not even like you’re on fire—like you
Draco let out a long, slow breath. Potter might be closer to some semblance of normalcy than he had been yesterday, but he still looked like he’d just leaped off the back of a motorbike while it was still moving. How did someone like that become an Unspeakable? Everything about him—his beaten-up leather jacket, his arrogant slouch, his untameable hair—screamed brawns-no-brain. And yet, even Draco was finding himself forced to admit that Potter was hiding a level of intelligence with unknown depth.
“I think you’d make a quick distraction, like complaining loudly about the signage above the bar, so we we’re all looking at it, and then quickly confirm you were going ahead with things because you’re both so terrible at working together you couldn’t trust that one of you wasn’t going to hang the other one out to dry,” Weasley suggested, smirking. “Am I right?”
“Oh?” Potter turned to him and propped his chin on his hands in a gesture that was entirely too sober. “So, has it been longer, then?”
But even if that were her way, hugs were not permitted. Not now, not for a very long time.
Didn’t remember handing over his coat. Didn’t remember sitting down at the best table, high on the mezzanine with a view of the beautiful pond outside. He knew that Potter’s hands were on his waist for most of it, knew that Potter kept leaning in to whisper commentary in his ear, like they were actually lovers instead of just one big fucking mess. Draco made sure to smile and laugh when necessary, but he felt like he was floating. The sounds of surrounding conversation blurred into one, and he couldn’t focus beyond the painful tightening of his chest.
Carefully, softly, he began to place small kisses along his jaw, down his collarbone. Harry felt strangely tense—not in the sense that he wasn’t enjoying it, but simply because there was something different about Malfoy’s movements, something that made him want to melt back down into the covers and bring Malfoy with him.
“Draco,” Pansy drawled, summoning a new bottle and uncorking it with a faint pop. “Don’t you think you’re too old for these childish tantrums?”
“Where are you going now?” Draco asked, dropping down beside him.
Draco nodded slowly. “Just making sure you were still keen. It’s been weeks; you might have become bored.” He grinned, trying to take the edge off his words, making sure he didn’t reveal just how much it meant to him that he maintain this closeness to Potter right now.
“Okay,” he rose, and the two of them walked stiffly out of the Great Hall. As they left the table, Hermione and Ron started furiously whispering to each other.
“We nearly didn’t make it,” Ron said in a rush, a little sheepish. “I couldn’t find my robes.”
“Malfoy,” Potter breathed, and Draco was certain he’d never heard his name said like that before. He ran a hand across his face. “Shit. I didn’t—” He broke off and laughed bitterly. “We really don’t remember any of this, do we?”
“No matter what happens now, they’re safe,” Malfoy said, packaging up the formula and the potion samples carefully before Vanishing them to the professors below.
“I do,” Malfoy said, the words tumbling out in his rush to correct Harry. He shoved his hair back from his forehead, the gesture making him look uncharacteristically messy and unsure. “But I want to enjoy it, Potter, and as of yet I have no frame of reference for what that would feel like.” He paused, and then, looking faintly disgusted with himself, added, “And, oddly enough, part of that enjoyment means that you have to feel good as well.””
Draco drew back sharply. “You make it sound like Potter’s a burden. He has no idea what affect his moods have on me and the people around him, and he is entirely unaware that I’m trying to help—”
Draco nearly laughed. The idea that a passive, unnoticeable visitor to his large estate could make him feel unsafe was hysterical only because it was true.
Malfoy stared at him, his pointy face suddenly sharp and cruel. He opened his mouth to say something, and then Harry watched as that same restraint and caution Malfoy had been using these last few weeks kicked in and he pulled himself back. But he didn’t apologise.
They stared at one another, chests heaving with adrenaline, eyes too filled with terror to hide behind walls or protections. Just two boys, lost on some shore together—for once, on the same side.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, before hurrying to respond. “Beginner’s luck,” he muttered. “Next one. Animagus.” Before Harry could say anything, he rolled his eyes and interrupted. “If you put down ferret, I will murder you in your sleep.”
“I thought you’d want to stop fooling around,” Malfoy said, a little breathless.
He wrapped his magic around each part, carefully separating them from each other, and with the precision of many years of training, dismantled them piece by piece. The final part—the entrapment spell—proved the most difficult of them all. In the end, all he could do was make it go dormant, but so long as no one reactivated it—and there would be few people alive who knew how—it wouldn’t be a danger to anyone.
Draco just didn’t know what it was yet.
“We won the war but nothing changed,” Potter continued.
He watched Potter for the remainder of the evening, watched him in a way he’d never thought to before. It was there, in every movement, every subtle shift to his expression. Potter was never calm, never just
Harry shrugged. “Personally, I’ve always found relief in accepting things as they are.” He smiled wrily, and Draco realised then that Harry thought himself weak, for being relieved that Fate might make his hardest choices for him.
“Still,” Potter said. His voice was surprisingly firm, the unexpected authority in it sending shivers down Draco’s spine. “I’d be more comfortable if you had some kind of additional security in place.”
“Except when you step in.”
The room they were in, now that Draco looked around, was very obviously not the workroom they had left behind in the physical world. It was approximately four metres square, and its most striking feature was its walls: they looked like the inside of a mechanical watch, interspersed with sections of metal lattice that pulsed gently with a faint white light. Draco turned around slowly, looking the walls up and down and determining that there was definitely no door. Thankfully, the floors and ceiling were ordinary floorboards and plaster, and they had no sensation of hot or cold in here, so, apart from being surrounded by imposing layers of moving metal, it was a relatively pleasant place to be stuck for the next few hours.
Malfoy’s concern vanished in place of one of the biggest eye rolls Harry had ever seen. It looked painful. “I don’t know, Potter, maybe because I’ve been cursed to live in
Draco took a moment to be annoyed that he couldn’t even properly savour the fact that Potter was, for once, asking his advice instead of jumping to infuriatingly correct answers.
For a horrible minute, Harry was certain he’d just said the wrong thing and he would be accused of sympathising with the enemy or being insensitive and devaluing the traumas they’d all gone through in the war.
“But you’re not familiar with it,” George said, a strange look in his eye.
“Let’s find out what it does,” Draco said, waving his wand.
An indignant shriek from upstairs had them both turning and breaking into as quiet a run as they could manage.
was printed underneath the illustration.
He watched Potter closely out of the corner of his eye, pretending the question was casual, dismissive. He took in the way Potter froze, steadying himself against the desk since he was still swaying slightly from the drink, and turned to glare at him.
He dropped three rolls of matching wrapping paper on the table, and Draco gasped. Set on a background of what could only be described as vomit-yellow, the paper was covered in tiny creatures that oozed slowly around each other, leaving little trails of grime behind them.
“It wasn’t pretty,” Weasley interjected.
Draco blinked at her. “Neither.” And then, because he had to give the right impression, “We talked.”
liked it. It was better than I ever imagined having someone else’s hands on me might be. I liked it when we got into a rhythm together.” His face felt hot at what else he had liked, but he wanted to be honest,
Malfoy twitched. “Joy,” he said, sounding anything but.
“What the—” Harry’s head snapped up, an ill sense of foreboding spreading down his spine.
They took their seats and ordered two bowls of the daily special, which arrived before Draco had even settled properly into his chair.
Draco lifted one shoulder as elegantly as he could manage when he was also fighting for space with three sponges.
“The shop,” Draco breathed, barely listening.
know…” he trailed off.
“How long do we have until the curse takes over?” Potter asked quietly.
No matter what angle or position he tried, though, he didn’t seem to be finding it. Malfoy was no help at all, too busy enjoying the sensations.
Draco woke to a twilight sky and Potter’s concerned face staring down at him.
irritable, and it just hadn’t worked out.
Harry nodded, and Draco couldn’t help laughing.
“I do.”
After a moment of silence, Potter gave himself a little shake. “Did you listen to the match last week?”
Draco froze. Where had that come from?
Draco lifted a shoulder, picking up one of the pigmy puff toys and examining it. “Just doing a spot of shopping. You’re here on official Auror business? Or is it strictly civilian today?”
Gritting his teeth, Draco reached over to pick up a basket from by his foot, hooking one slender finger beneath the handle. All plans to inform Potter of the facts he had overlooked fled his mind—let the git suffer. “Surely not,” he agreed with a smile, quietly relishing the anticipation of the moment Potter did his little spell and realised Draco was the Veela he would have to tangle with.
Potter shook his head. “Not yet.” He looked a little sheepish. “I’m thinking about something else at the moment. Did you know that the Ministry hears word about a potential Muggle-born within two years of birth?”
Draco pulled out his notebook and opened it up, but the only notes he’d made were from last time.
Draco yelped at the sudden cold of the metal, but the sound died—transformed into an embarrassing moan—as Harry dropped to his knees and took Draco into his mouth.
Somehow, together, they had found a kind of peace out there in the Muggle world, pretending that everything was far behind them, when truthfully the war was as much a part of them as their skin, their lungs, their heart. It always would be. But when the music played, they could throw themselves into it and laugh and drink, and most of the time the rest would fade away.
“Why did you get so mad?” he finally asked, somewhat stupidly.
“I liked him,” Draco said simply, because he had. Then, because Potter appeared to be judging him, “He was good to me.”
Draco plucked a vial out of his pocket and leaned forward to examine the hairs. “I need your wand.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “It was meant to be
Pansy moved in front of him and began tapping Potter on the cheek, lightly at first and then harder as she became more panicked.
“No.” Malfoy kicked the trunk again.
Draco really would have preferred the Veela to appear in its beautiful human form, but he supposed it was angry, since it was a curse after all.
I don’t know how to say this to you, but I’m leaving England in the morning. I’m fully aware that this letter is unsigned and without a seal, and so you may well wonder how you are to know who I am and why you should care. The answers to both of those questions, respectively, are: you aren’t to know, and you don’t care. Simply presume that I am one of your many fans; it is accurate enough, and Lord knows you have enough of them to ensure me some anonymity.
He turned away, but before he made it two steps, he heard a quiet voice from behind him say, “Yes, I forgot something.”
The next moment, he was between Draco’s thighs, pressing the head of his prick to Draco.
The girl rolled her eyes. “Duh, that’s because the tentacles have a hovering charm, like on a baby broom, so you can get away faster.”
When Malfoy broke, Harry wanted to go back and do it all over again.
Ron caught sight of them and beamed, and the three of them hurried over.
“You what?” he whispered.
Taking a deep breath, Draco followed.
Stupidly, and in a very Harry-like fashion, which had got him into trouble many times before and probably would many more times in the future, he opened his mouth and didn’t think at all.
Malfoy startled and leaped from the bed, spinning in a circle as he surveyed the room. There was no one there.
Hermione and Ron had arrived before them and were occupying one of the couches in the corner off to the side. It was situated in front of a fireplace, which was flickering with a small fire to keep the room warm and modestly dry.
Right, bribery. Great idea. You’re the best.
“Is that right?” he asked, bracing himself on the wall by Draco’s head.
Potter shrugged. “Well, yeah. I thought if I could trick the Veela into thinking I’d made a nest for us, I could make the curse think it had… worked.”
It was as he was falling asleep that Harry realised he had found one small thing he could do without fucking up. Powerless over everything of importance, he could still water a succulent and watch the bees collect pollen.
It was late, the lamp-light casting long shadows on the kitchen table between the two of them. Draco tried to ignore the way Potter’s posture had shifted, the way he seemed to hover on the edges of the darkness like it was something he was itching to sink into.
That was… Honestly, I don’t know where to begin. If you were trying to convince me to open up to you again by opening up to me first, then, it was… well, truthfully, it was pathetic. I’m not here to tell you how to live your life, but if you want to be vulnerable with someone, Potter, you have to actually be vulnerable.  I don’t know who you’ve told that story to, but I can practically hear how many times you’ve said those words. They don’t mean anything to you, and neither does the act of sharing them with me.
.” His face grew tight and walled-off. “Maybe I don’t want them to know quite as much as I thought.”
“Sorry, Malfoy.” The grimace on his face almost did look apologetic. “I am going to need the two of you to swear it—it’s policy. Do you think Parkinson could come by in—”
Potter’s fingers slid against him, firm between the cleft of his thighs. Every time they passed over him, they would press a little deeper until Potter was knuckle deep inside him and Draco was writhing against the cold wall. Any thoughts of trying to salvage their relationship into something verging on healthy disappeared; if it was healthy, he wouldn’t have
“The second one.” Malfoy sat down on the edge of the bed, legs crossed and his chin propped in his hand. “If we freeze in the middle of this, we’re no use to anyone.”
“Yes, I’ve added you permanently to the wards,” Draco answered. “You can Apparate from anywhere here, if you want. But, just wait a second, I have information.”
Potter stared at him, his mouth gaping. “You have to write a message,” he said finally. “If we wake up and there’s no record of what’s happened here, we’re going to open the box.”
He didn’t say anything to that, and as he watched them he found it felt oddly as if he were standing in the wings of a stage, eyes drawn to the spotlight. The two men before him were nothing like the children he had known, always in each other’s pockets, sharing inside jokes without even needing to communicate. There was something stilted between the two of them now.
