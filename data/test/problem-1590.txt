because, well, Harry was too big around for just the one. Draco broke off the kiss to stare down at where he was wanking Harry off with both hands, clearly turned on. Harry was glad Draco didn't fall into the intimidated or jealous category, but given the way he was licking his lips, Harry braced himself for a change in their plans for the evening. It wouldn't be a hardship fucking Draco—far from it—even if it hadn't been what he'd been dreaming of over the past several months of foreplay.
"Okay, good, that's good," Draco said, clearly doing his best to sound encouraging and soothing, though Harry could hear the undercurrent of relief. "Liked it as in, it was fun to try as a one-off? Or liked it as in, you'd enjoy exploring that dynamic further?"
"Now," Draco said, turning towards Harry with a wry smile on his lips and a slight wariness in his eyes. "While I can appreciate the need for space, I promise you England is plenty big enough for the both of us. In the future, while I'd much prefer we actually talk through any issues we may have, if you truly want to avoid me, you probably shouldn't involve one of my closest friends in your schemes."
"I think the victim's flat is just a couple of streets away," Draco said, glancing down at the file that he must have taken from Harry at some point while Harry was distracted by Draco's… everything. He started off at a brisk pace down the road, and Harry scurried after him. Draco wasn't more than an inch or two taller than Harry but it was apparently all in his legs, and Harry had to practically run to keep up with his stride.
Harry shook his head, the idea patently ridiculous. Sure, he'd found Draco's presence comforting and commanding—safe, even—while he'd been "playing" but the feelings he had for Draco right now were very much not of the kind Harry had felt for the parental figures in his life.
"I'm sure you're all wondering why I've called you here for this emergency meeting, so let's not delay any longer. As you all know, Byrne has managed to ingratiate himself with Lady Foley's inner circle, and he's brought us some news." He gestured towards Byrne, who nodded calmly.
Draco's lashes fluttered as his arse settled into the cradle of Harry's hips, Harry's cock buried to the hilt inside of him. His eyes slitted open, lazy and content as a Kneazle's, his smile equally indolent.
"I hadn't planned on disciplining you tonight, but perhaps we're overdue," Draco mused. Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco cut him off with a severe glance. "Don't argue, Harry. We've got to go or we'll be late." His expression softened as some of his earlier anxiety crept in. "I want to make a good impression."
"Okay, so maybe I'm not the only one with these fantasies, and maybe I'm not the only one who's struggled with feeling ashamed, but…" Harry trailed off, flushing. True, that was the biggest hurdle he had been trying to overcome, but it wasn't
Harry shook his head, refusing to believe what Robards was saying while his boss explained that the attack had been planned by Lady Foley as a way to strike fear into the hearts of those that dared to escape her rule. She seemed to have taken her cue from Muggle suicide bombers and had given three dedicated followers special charms layered with several explosive and extremely volatile spells. They'd stationed themselves strategically throughout the building and had self-destructed, taking out everyone and everything around them.
"You won't, I'm right here," Harry said, confused by the turn the conversation had taken, but remembering well how wildly his emotions had swung during the war, and how terrified he'd been of losing his friends. "I swear I'm not trying to be reckless. I promised Draco I'd come home to him, after all. God, he'll kill me if he finds out about the duel—you won't tell him, will you?"
Harry blinked down at him, loose-limbed and dazed in the wake of his powerful orgasm. His thoughts were as slow as treacle as he attempted to process the hotness that was Draco licking Harry's come off his lips.
Harry nodded, reaching out and pulling Draco to stand between his spread legs. He nuzzled at Draco's bulge, maintaining eye contact and watching as Draco's flimsy resolve began to melt away. "Yeah," Harry breathed, right against the damp patch beginning to form from Draco's leaking cock. "You should give me
"I can live with that," Draco said, stepping close and running his hands appreciatively over Harry's bare chest. "It's just… against all odds—our history, your fame, my infamy, my family and upbringing,
"All right," Draco said several minutes later as he finished casting the spell. The lone bead of sweat dripping down his forehead was the only sign of the effort he'd just expended in healing Harry with his magic. "You should be all set."
Harry nodded and held out his hand. Taking statements wasn't as exciting as taking down an illegal potions ring, but it was necessary work. And, more importantly, it was still more interesting than filling out case forms.
Draco's jaw clenched. "I'm not saying we should ignore what's happening over there—I'm certainly not doing that myself. But pretending nothing's happening and going over to fight aren't the only options! There are other ways to help, to get involved. You could volunteer at the relief organisation with me if you wanted. They need more than just Healers, you know."
"Err…" Harry was, as ever, eloquent in all situations. Though, to be fair, he wasn't sure there was an eloquent way to ask somebody if they were freaked out by your
It wasn't as if he and Draco hadn't worked with one another before—they'd gone through three years of training together and had collaborated on multiple teams and task forces in the six years since they'd become fully-fledged Aurors.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but Harry saw the hint of a smile he was doing his level best to suppress. "I hoped you might have finally got the hint, but I suppose that was naïve of me."
"Was that a yes to this Friday?" Harry shouted down the corridor after him, ignoring the curious stares of the patients and Healers walking down the halls.
"Oh, yeah, I'm fine," Harry muttered. She gave him a sceptical glance that sent a pang right through him. He and Parvati had grown quite close over their years working together as Aurors, and closer still since they'd both come over to Ireland, but she wasn't Ron or Hermione. Her gentle concern, while touching, mostly just served to make Harry miss his best mates all the more. It didn't feel right, fighting a war without them by his side. He knew why they couldn't come, given Rose was still just a baby and Hermione was pregnant again with their second child—he would have stopped them himself if either had tried to volunteer. But this was the longest he'd ever gone without seeing either of them in person, and he missed them.
." He winced and wiped his greasy fingers on his napkin, having finished with picking apart the rest of his fish into tiny flakes. "If it's not something you're interested in exploring, I don't want you to feel pressured. I've never been into any of the lifestyle stuff, and it's always been more of a bonus for me as opposed to something that's necessary."
"Sorry, Parvati, but would you mind if we pick this up later? The battle's left me wiped out and if I don't get some sleep now I'm worried I'll pass right out. I want to make sure I'm up tomorrow in time for the interrogations."
people. They'd be people who were like Harry, who had maybe struggled the way Harry was struggling. "That… might be nice."
Draco nodded slowly. "Of course. I'll wait right here for you." He sat in the armchair in the corner by the window.
"And wine," he added, brandishing the bottle. "I would've brought beer but I didn't have enough hands. The lady at the shop said Riesling should go well with Thai, so hopefully it's not shit."
that we can also do away with this entirely. I think that would be a mistake, not because I don't think we couldn't have a fulfilling relationship without it, but because it's clear to me that it's something that brings you genuine happiness and peace, at least when you allow yourself to forget about the rest of the world and just do what feels good. I want you to know that's always an option. Even if you just want to put a Freezing Charm on it for a few weeks or longer while you work things out in your head. It's not a prerequisite for us having a satisfying relationship, at least not for me."
The sight of Harry floundering seemed to call to something in Draco because the signs of his nervousness dropped away. He straightened and gave Harry a warm smile before stepping in and brushing a kiss against Harry's cheek.
Something complicated flashed in Draco's eyes—fear and hope and pleasure—and he reached out, pulling Harry in for a toe-curling kiss. His fingers slid through Harry's hair as Harry's arms wrapped around him, relishing the feeling of Draco's hard, strong body up against him. Draco's lips were soft and sure, and fuck if Draco didn't know how to kiss, deep and coaxing, easily getting Harry's mouth to open beneath him. Harry'd been kissed plenty before, but never like this, with such passion and skill, like Draco had been dreaming of kissing Harry for a long damn time and was keen to make it count. It was exhilarating, and Harry never wanted it to end.
All week he'd carried the black ring box with him in his pocket, a small, steady weight to remind him of his plans, his future. He'd been planning this for months but as the event grew nearer, Harry became more frazzled, eager for the day to finally arrive. Harry firecalled Draco every night, and it was clear Draco knew there was something going on with Harry, though he'd thankfully left it alone beyond a couple of penetrating looks. They knew each other well enough by now to know when to push and when to wait for the other person to come to them. Harry hoped Draco was able to hold off just one more day because Harry wasn't sure he wouldn't blurt the question right out with the slightest provocation. A part of Harry would have almost preferred that—the wait was positively killing him—but he'd been planning this moment for far too long not to see it through now.
They made their way to Draco's living room, sitting down together on the sofa close enough that Harry was painfully aware of every move Draco made, though not quite close enough to touch. Draco turned on the telly and flicked through the channels, finally settling on some kind of baking competition that made Harry's mouth water despite the fact that he was currently stuffing his face with food. They both relaxed, eating and drinking wine and chatting about their week as Muggles panicked about deflating soufflés. It was nice, comfortable, almost like hanging out with any of Harry's other mates, besides the persistent desire to reach out and run his fingers through Draco's hair. That, and the flashes of the various fantasies Harry had been having over the past week, ever since that fateful interview, that kept popping into Harry's head and making his heart race.
Two days later, on an incongruously sunny afternoon, Foley's team struck. The alarm blared throughout Fathi's manor and adrenaline flooded Harry's system as he Apparated straight to the scene, not bothering to check in with any of the others. They all knew the plan; he'd see them there.
Thankfully Byrne was experienced enough not to let the man's accusation get to him—Harry would have worried about his placement in Lady Foley's camp if he'd been ruffled. Working undercover required an unflappable temper and the ability to think on your feet.
—Merlin, was Hermione giving lessons?—and Harry promptly zipped his lips. It probably would not be smart to rile up the man with the wand pointed at his side.
understand that whatever it was she was telling Fathi, she was backing Harry up, and he felt a rush of gratefulness to her.
Draco couldn't be gone. This couldn't be real. That wasn't the last time he got to see Draco's face, to hold him in his arms, to see that smile. This was all just a dream. A nightmare.
"He got into our greenhouse," Cara explained, as if worried about what Harry might be thinking about the bandage. "Got into some plants he shouldn't have and broke out in boils, s'why we're here. My parents had to step out so I offered to stay with him while the Healers—" A large cracking sound echoed through the corridor, like the sound of a beam giving way. While they'd been speaking the fires around them had become much larger, and Harry realised that the damage to the building was much worse than he'd originally thought. They needed to get out of there.
Draco grinned, pure pleasure beaming out of him. "That's all right. It took me years to really accept myself, and I know it's not some spell you can cast and, swish and flick, it's done. Just promise not to run away next time and talk to me instead."
Draco's eyes flashed, and for a moment it looked like he might argue, but eventually he gave a jerky nod. "But we
"This is it," Draco announced as he came to an abrupt stop, so sudden that Harry didn't have enough time to halt his momentum before barrelling right into him.
starting to feel a bit light-headed. Not that he was going to admit as much to Malfoy. He might have changed from the horrid boy he'd been at Hogwarts, grown into somebody decent and competent and unfairly fit, but that didn't mean Harry was keen to show him any weakness.
"Not you, too," Harry said with a groan. He wasn't sure what had started it, but lately his mates—Ron and Hermione in particular—had been on him to go on holiday. True, the only time off he'd taken since he started the Aurors had been when Ron and Hermione had got married several years ago, but he
"All right, Sean," Harry said to the boy, who was crying and hiccuping as he clung to his sister. "I need you to keep your eyes closed for me, okay? So the smoke doesn't sting them." Harry's eyes were already watering, and there were gritty tear tracks sliding down Cara's sooty cheeks. Sean looked to his big sister and she nodded encouragingly. He screwed his eyes shut and buried his face against her shoulder. A lump formed in Harry's throat and he looked away.
"Okay, but what's that mean for us?" interrupted Imogen impatiently. She was the star Chaser and Captain of the Ballycastle Bats, an extremely accomplished duellist, and a long-time vocal critic of Lady Foley before the Lady had grabbed enough power to issue a warrant for Imogen's arrest. She was an asset to the resistance, but was not the most patient of people, and being unable to play the sport that was her life's calling for so long was starting to take its toll. "Are we thinking with her gone we can take back the country?"
Harry perked up. He'd been planning to work his way through the towering backlog of paperwork that was balancing precariously on the edge of his desk, but working a case sounded much more interesting. The paperwork could wait.
The resistance might have cut off the head of the monster, but they didn't yet know if Foley's party was a snake or a hydra. They'd captured most of Foley's inner circle as well but not all of them, and the last thing they wanted was for one of her followers to pop up and take Foley's now-empty throne. If Foley was anything like Voldemort, she wouldn't want that either, which might work to their advantage.
Harry didn't even have enough energy left to muster up the requisite guilt he knew he should feel for being relieved, nor the sadness that should be there at leaving his friends and loved ones behind. Draco, he knew, would be furious at him for being so reckless, for giving up. He'd never forgive Harry, he knew that, but Draco didn't understand. Harry was so
"How do you like it?" Draco asked as he sucked on a spot behind Harry's ear that made Harry quiver. It was clear from Draco's tone that it was more command than question.
Graham hesitated. "She's a little… indisposed right now. I actually need to be getting back to her, but I suppose… If you wouldn't mind…"
Harry blinked up at the ceiling, his eyes dry and aching from the complete lack of sleep. Judging by the light now pouring in from his window and the birds chirping far-too-loudly outside, it was now officially morning and Harry was no closer to figuring out what the hell he wanted. He'd tried to sleep on it, but sleep had evaded him. Instead, he'd spent hours lying in bed, his stomach churning and thoughts racing.
Their duel, heated as it was, required all of Foley's considerable focus, so when Fathi and Parvati joined the fight—while the rest of the resistance kept Foley's remaining minions preoccupied—she didn't stand a chance. The sudden presence of Harry's comrades by his side brought him back to himself, helped settle some of his fury, and reminded him that as much as he might desire otherwise, they needed to capture Foley alive. They needed her to break into her manor's wards and root out the rest of her followers, and they were all fairly certain she was the type to have a self-destruct set up in the event of her capture.
It looked like several of their defenses were holding up under the onslaught; a cluster of brightly-robed wizards blasted the silvery dome of protection surrounding the hospital in an attempt to weaken it. Judging from the screams coming from inside, and the smoke pouring from several open windows, something or someone had already made it in. Harry swore. This wouldn't be the first time Foley had used explosive charms and spells, sometimes even sacrificing her own people, in order to inflict maximum damage.
He didn't give Draco a chance to protest further, just walked slowly but resolutely towards the guest room when what he wanted to do was run. Once the door was closed he tore off the clothes—literally, unfortunately, as the weakened fabric was unequal to Harry's need to get out of them and back to
Aesthetically, he understood the appeal, but Harry wasn't generally attracted to older men, and he'd never been all that keen on blokes who were massively bigger than him, either. When he went for men, it was for somebody like Draco—long and lean, with interesting features—and he'd never been drawn to anyone more than a few years older than himself. Technically, Draco
"If you'd like. It's not a formal scene, more of a… hypothetical. I know you can get a little caught up in your head. I thought it might be easier for you to determine how you really feel about something if you had sex as a bit of a distraction."
Draco's cheeks flushed a pale pink with pleasure, and all Harry wanted to do was reach out and muss him up further. "That makes me very happy to hear. It's important that we're on the same page and imperative that we trust one another or it won't work. As I've mentioned, the world of kink is vast. Even within ageplay there is a broad spectrum of activities which may or may not appeal."
"Yes, but I wasn't your partner, then," Draco fretted. "I just want this to go well. I know how important they are to you."
"Well?" Draco prompted after Harry was silent for several long moments, losing himself in the pleasure-pain of Draco abusing his nipples.
"Why, because I like being in control?" He swivelled his hips and clenched around Harry's cock, a smooth, graceful move than had Harry moaning with pleasure. Draco smirked. "Having a cock up my arse doesn't change that." His gaze softened and he reached down to cup Harry's cheek. Harry nuzzled into the touch. "I'm still calling the shots, aren't I, baby?"
There were several boxes stacked against the wall of the spare office, which Harry noticed had been mostly cleared of furniture. The boxes were glossy and covered with brightly coloured moving images of the toys contained within. Harry's gaze immediately went to the grouping of boxes that clearly contained the various Merlin action figures and accompanying sets, watching as knights raced around the corner of the largest box while a dragon swooped behind them. Harry's fingers itched and he bounded over to the box, tearing it open before freezing when he remembered the fact that these were technically Draco's toys and he should probably ask permission. He looked guiltily over his shoulder and Draco laughed.
do that." Draco took another sip of his wine, settling himself more comfortably on the sofa. Harry hadn't realised how tense Draco had been before now, and it made some of Harry's own tension ease knowing he wasn't the only one who was nervous and unsure. "As I've said before, I've only dabbled in this particular subsection of kink. But I've been doing some more research and spoke to a friend of mine who's more experienced with the Daddy/little dynamic."
Harry didn't stay to hear more, just took off sprinting down the corridor towards the Apparition platform. He wasn't sure he'd ever felt so panicked, so terrified. Draco was supposed to be
This was always Harry's favourite part, when he not only got to watch Draco work his literal magic, but got to
But Harry had never been one to let other people's judgements prevent him from going after what he wanted, and he knew he wanted Draco. More than that, Harry couldn't deny that he didn't want to lose that sense of joy and freedom he'd experienced during their scenes together, when Harry had felt safe enough in Draco's presence to slip into that littlespace. He knew from his research that many people were able to get there all on their own, but Harry knew that wasn't for him. His notoriety and profession made him far too paranoid to be able to truly let go without having somebody he trusted there watching over him. Besides, Harry couldn't deny that there was something slightly addictive about being cared for the way Draco cared for him. Draco made it clear that he respected Harry as somebody strong and capable, a true partner, while also creating space for Harry to lean on him, to let Draco sometimes carry the burden. It was a balance that had been missing from Harry's previous relationships, where there'd always been a tacit expectation that Harry would take the lead and make the decisions, regardless of Harry's personal feelings on the matter. It was nicer than he could have expected, not having to always be in control.
"The last time you promised to get yourself sorted you ended up with a mutated curse infection caused by your shoddy Healing spells that had
Draco's lips twitched as if he were fighting a smile, but he gamely held his arm out to Harry. "Of course," he said solemnly. "I'd hate for us to land right on top of one another." The hot gleam in his eyes belied that particular statement, and Harry's belly gave another enthusiastic shiver.
He let out a sound which could only be categorised as a moan, far too tinged with desire to be mistaken for a groan of pain. Malfoy's gaze moved from Harry's now-healed side to his face, his pupils blown as he met Harry's stare. Harry saw with a sudden, dizzying rush, his own want reflected back at him. There was a moment of silence. Two. And then suddenly Malfoy was half in his lap and they were necking like teenagers, Malfoy's hands sliding through Harry's hair as Harry moaned into Malfoy's mouth.
"And what's she got planned for a distraction? It would have to be massive if she's hoping it'll draw the bulk of the resistance away from standing guard here."
surprising was just how appealing the thought was. He'd never been a particularly jealous person, but it had hurt as a child, seeing Dudley with a shiny new outfit every week, clothes he'd use and discard without thought or consequence while Harry was stuck with the same three, faded shirts. By the time Harry had money of his own to spend he was off to Hogwarts, where there was not only a uniform but an entirely different manner of dress, where people wore robes instead of jeans and flashy T-shirts. Harry had never liked drawing attention to himself, so he'd stuck with muted, solid colours, even if his gaze occasionally strayed towards something loud and flashy,
"There we go," Draco cooed as he began to move. "Put your hands on my hips. Good, now I want you to keep them there. Just lie back and let me take care of you."
"How are you feeling?" Draco asked as Harry rolled off of him and pressed himself along Draco's side in a stealth snuggle.
"We also—" Draco broke off and took a deep breath. "I know I keep harping on this, but I feel like I need to make it clear"—he gave Harry a rather severe look—"
"Imogen!" he called out, drawing her eye and her wand before she realised it was him. Her gaze quickly travelled to Cara and her brother, and she snapped into action, yelling something in Gaelic outside. One of the younger members of the resistance—Neil? Niall?—popped up by the door, clearly on point to escort Cara to wherever they were taking civilians. Harry turned to face her.
"I'm sure it'll be great," Draco said. "Though I've got beer on hand if it's unbearable. Are we getting plates or eating from the cartons like savages?"
Harry let out a somewhat sheepish laugh as he picked up his spoon. "No, it's great! I was just… distracted. You seemed like you were enjoying it enough for the both of us."
Draco settled in against the arm of the sofa, giving Harry an expectant look as he opened his arms. Harry didn't need any further encouragement. He wedged himself between the cushions and Draco, wrapping an arm around Draco's middle and pressing his cheek against his chest. Beneath him, Draco hummed, his body vibrating pleasantly as he ran a hand through Harry's hair and down his back.
had gone a long way towards changing Harry's feelings towards Draco. After three years of training together, they were something almost like friends. In the six years since, that friendship had grown and evolved into something a little different, as Harry realised his appreciation for Draco's sharp smile and strong shoulders and broad hands was a little more than friendly.
Harry tried not to make a face—he was a grown adult and thus above such childish antics in reference to his best mates having kinky sex, but ugh—before turning pleading eyes on Draco. "I bet
Harry goggled at him. He'd not expected Draco to come right out and say it so baldly. Draco stared at him patiently, and Harry gave a brief and somewhat reluctant nod.
He opened his mouth to say something suggestive but he looked down before he could speak and realised he was still dressed up in the clothes Draco had got for him. It wasn't exactly an outfit that inspired the kinds of sexy thoughts Harry wanted Draco to be thinking right now.
Harry didn't bother drawing things out, they were both too far gone for that. He nestled the rounded head of his cock into the cleft of Draco's arse, feeling around for his arsehole before pressing steadily inside as he stared into Draco's eyes. This was one of his favourite parts of fucking Draco, if he had to choose. Harry loved watching his expressive face when Harry first pressed inside, observing his micro-expressions as Harry sank all the way in, filling Draco up. It was all there, the pain and pleasure, the overwhelming intensity of being so full, the trust and the love as Draco opened himself up to Harry. It was beautiful, and humbling; it made Harry want to offer Draco the world.
"I thought—" Harry broke off, gasping as Draco began to sit down on his cock. "I didn't think you liked it like this."
turned out perfectly, well worth the lingering ache in his arm from all that stirring. He was sure Molly could have told him a spell to keep the wooden spoon moving, but there was something about doing it himself that made it taste all the better. Besides, he enjoyed the ritual of doing it by hand.
Harry sighed, relaxing into the sensation he'd grown to enjoy. It had been a long damned time since he'd experienced this with another person as opposed to using his own hands and toys, and he let himself enjoy the feeling of Draco's finger as it slid in deep. Draco had gorgeous fingers, long and dexterous, the kind of fingers Harry had imagined doing all kinds of filthy things to him. He thought he might enjoy it if Draco spent some time fingering him open until he begged for it, but not tonight. Tonight he was too damn keen to get Draco's dick inside him, and thankfully Draco seemed to be of a similar mind. He quickly slid in a second finger, pressing the lube inside of Harry and making sure he was nice and slick, his muscles suitably relaxed, before pulling out and settling on his knees between Harry's spread legs.
real, Harry, don't you get that? Using your fame to garner support and donations might not be exciting or glamorous, it might even be uncomfortable, but in the end, so much comes back to money." He gave a bitter laugh as he tugged at the buttons on his shirt. "Trust me, I grew up with money, I know. Yes, the work that they're doing right now over in Ireland is important and necessary, but they also need funding, and they'll continue to need it after the war is over and they need to rebuild."
exploring this dynamic with you, and if you never felt up for any kind of kink beyond what we've been doing, I'd be genuinely satisfied. I wouldn't lie to you about that. If I thought there was any chance it might not be enough for me, I'd tell you straight off.
The door at the end of the hallway was open just a crack, enough so that Harry could hear the low rumble of Graham's voice, followed by a higher, softer lilt. A few moments later, Graham emerged and gave them a small smile.
"Salazar, what a bloody nightmare. I was really hoping we'd have a bit longer to figure things out between us before I scared you off with the whole kink thing. I mean…" He paused and made a face before seeming to force himself to continue as he met Harry's gaze, "I still want to see where this thing goes." He gestured between them. "We both know the odds are stacked against us, but I don't want this to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. If it freaks you out, I promise it's not something we ever have to pursue. We can forget about it"
"Woah," Malfoy said, stepping forward and placing a strong arm around Harry's waist. Harry might have normally bristled at the implication that he was about to pass out like some Victorian maiden, but Malfoy's arm felt quite nice wrapped around him and his knees
, but there was strange heat in his belly that indicated perhaps he wasn't as opposed to the idea as he might have believed. Yes, it all seemed a little baffling and strange, but it was the kind of strange that made Harry want to dig deeper and learn more. There'd been a spark of feeling inside of him earlier as he watched Graham and Emily interact, something not unlike envy and longing. He wanted to deny it, to pretend he hadn't recognised what those feelings might mean, but he generally wasn't very good at lying to himself, even when he really, really wanted to.
Draco only seemed somewhat mollified by this, and Harry could tell he was working himself up into a lather. Harry needed to stop his anxiety spiral before it got out of control. He wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and leaned in to whisper in his ear.
"How could I ever give this up?" Harry asked after he'd somewhat recovered, brushing a kiss across Draco's sweaty forehead as he eased out and reached for his wand to clean them off.
Her tanned skin flushed mulberry and she sputtered angrily. "What? No! It's not like that. Ugh, he's like, twice our age! And so serious. And condescending. And—and—and
"I also have the names of a few kink-friendly Mind Healers, if that's something you'd be interested in pursuing," Draco continued a bit more hesitantly. "I should have realised sooner that you'd need more than just my help, especially considering how desperately I relied on my Mind Healer and the kink community when I was first starting out."
"I'm glad you liked it," Harry said. "Just give me a few minutes and I'll go take care of the dishes. I didn't make anything for pudding, but I've got a pint of chocolate ice cream if you want—"
Oh, sure, he'd gone out every day and explored nearby Florence, but the sights barely registered. The gorgeous city and scenery were leached of all colour and passion in his current state of mind.
Ron laughed. "Better let him tell you when he gets back from the loo. He seems legitimately narked off this time but it's Seamus, so…"
Harry swallowed heavily and sat. Draco took the seat opposite, his brow furrowing as he looked at Harry.
"—he stabbed a threatening finger towards Harry—"get a chaperone until you prove you can be trusted to take care of yourself and not cock up my weekend plans."
Draco looked like he wanted to argue, like he was worried that letting Harry leave right now would be a mistake, but Harry couldn't handle talking about his feelings right now. Draco would make him face what had just happened, and Harry wasn't ready.
, purposefully targeting the injured and sick, innocents that were the most vulnerable and least likely to fight back and protect themselves, and the dedicated witches and wizards who cared for them. It was horrifying, and they had to pay for what they'd done. For what they'd taken from him.
Harry's cheeks warmed at the gentle rebuke and he forced himself to ease up, to really savour the feeling and flavour of Draco's cock on his tongue. He looked up at Draco, not even realising that he was hoping for praise until Draco gave it to him.
"Come with me to the centre later today," Draco urged. "We can talk to Leslie about you volunteering. I don't want to seem like I don't get it, I do. But it's not selfish to want to live your life. You've earned it, Harry. More than anybody I know, you deserve to be happy."
Draco nodded, seeming somewhat relieved. "That's understandable. And that actually brings me to the first thing I wanted to discuss. I need you to choose a safe word. It should be something that's easy for you to remember, but not something that you might say accidentally in conversation."
trio, and he missed that indelible thread of knowledge and connection he'd always had with his best mates. It was almost enough to make him miss the chiding he'd have got from Hermione as he let one of Foley's hexes close enough to the singe the ends of his hair, giving Fathi and Parvati a critical few seconds to put their plan into action.
No, if he wanted books on that kind of thing, he'd need to go somewhere a bit more modern. He knew Flourish & Blotts had a sexual wellness section—Luna had spent a very long pub night detailing the many helpful books she'd found there to spice things up in the bedroom with Rolf. Harry wasn't sure if the shop stocked books on his particular kink, but if they didn't have them on hand he could probably special order something. There was also the recent sex shop expansion of Weasley Wizard Wheezes, which was much more likely to actually have what he was looking for in stock. Both were decent enough options for the average wizard, but for Harry they were really only one step up from involving Hermione. Given his unfortunate level of fame, word of his perversions would no doubt show up tomorrow on the front page of the
, so empty. He hadn't set out to die, but he'd been living on borrowed time from the moment he came back from that platform seven years ago. He'd been ready then, and he was ready now.
Draco's lips ticked up into an amused smile. "Not like that. But I thought this might help with our decision to
He wasn't sure how long he and Parvati sat there together outside the door to the dungeons, waiting for news. Long enough that Harry's arse went numb from forgetting to renew his Cushioning Charm. Long enough for several empty teacups to appear next to them both, drained on autopilot as they waited.
"As far as I can tell, we've got control of all the entrances," Imogen said brusquely. "We have two dozen of Foley's followers in custody, and suspect another six are still at large inside. Gemma and Logan were tracking several of them on our end, and I know we've got others inside as well. Most of the patients and hospital staff have been evacuated, but there are still a few unaccounted for." She grimaced, her voice low and pained. "We miscalculated how big an attack this would be."
"Blaise," Draco confirmed. "He knew I was seeing somebody new, though I'd not told him who—I know we'd discussed keeping things private for now. But apparently he'd put two and two together. I hope you won't be too hard on him about telling me where you were—he's quite loyal and wouldn't normally be the type to divulge a friend's secrets, but I'm not the only one who was concerned by your sudden and out-of-character departure."
"I like waking up with you in my arms," Draco whispered into Harry's hair. "I want to have that for a very long time."
"Is she playing?" Draco asked quietly, and Harry glanced over at him in confusion, baffled by the sudden line of inquiry.
Draco's fist was raised, clearly about to start another round of impatient knocking, though he'd gone utterly still the moment Harry had swung the door open. His normally perfectly coiffed hair was mussed and windswept, and there was something slightly rumpled about his robes, as if he'd dressed in a hurry and without his usual precise care. The delicate skin beneath his slightly wild eyes was stained a pale purple-grey, and Harry felt a pang of guilt at the evidence that Draco apparently hadn't been sleeping much better than Harry. Harry knew it was all his fault, but even through the self-recrimination and confusion, he couldn't help the sudden rush of pleasure at seeing Draco again. It hadn't even been a full week, but the force of missing him hit Harry right in the gut. He gripped the door to prevent himself from throwing his arms around Draco and hugging him tight, unsure of his welcome.
"Oh, right," Malfoy replied awkwardly. "Well, I have more patients to see. I trust you can find your way out?"
"Maybe later," Draco replied. "As much as I love fucking your arse, right now I want you inside me. Want you to fuck me just like this."
"There's been an attack," Ron said, and somehow Harry knew what Ron was going to say next. "At the relief centre for the Irish refugees."
Draco let out a rumbling growl of approval that made Harry's entire body grow warm with pleasure. Draco's fingers wrapped briefly around the nape of Harry's neck and gave a comforting squeeze, and the lingering tension Harry had been carrying melted away. He was safe here. There was nothing to worry about.
. I've got the skills for it, and it feels selfish not to put them to use. But maybe you're right, maybe doing something else to help out here will make me feel better."
Of course, that was before Harry was forced to work with him day in and day out, forced to listen to his keen insight, forced to watch him competently unravel the most complex of curses, forced to stare at his stupid shiny hair as it gleamed beneath the Ministry's overhead lights. He'd tried to stay away from Malfoy, really he had, but it was hardly his fault if the Ministry all but dropped him in Harry's lap like an incredibly attractive, spiky present, ripe for obsessing over. Harry liked to think he was pretty good at his job, but it was made infinitely more difficult when Draco bloody Malfoy had him all wound up and twisted into knots.
The rest of the meeting was strategic, Fathi outlining his tentative plans, taking note of volunteers and doling out assignments. It was just the start of what was bound to be a week's worth of planning, and Harry knew he'd be more involved in the sessions that got into the specifics of the battle plans, so he mostly sat back for now, bolstered by the enthusiasm of the room and the possibility of being so close to their goal.
Even though Harry was the one who'd asked him to stay, he found himself overcome with the shyness of a little boy, like he'd just met a strange adult he thought he liked but wasn't quite sure of yet. He turned his back, blushed, and quickly undressed, leaving on his socks and pants as he tugged on the new clothes. Harry wasn't sure why he felt so embarrassed—it wasn't as if Draco wasn't
"That's what you get for ignoring me," Harry said primly as Draco cast a Healing Charm on his burnt fingers.
sex when he was like that. Something about it felt wrong, and no amount of telling himself otherwise seemed to diminish the shame writhing in his guts when he thought about it, so he just did his best not to.
doing the fucking, but he preferred being the fuckee, all things being equal, and just once he'd like to be with a bloke who didn't take one look at his dick and either run screaming for the hills or immediately try to climb him like Mount Everest. Just once he'd like it to not be about his dick at
He looked down at his regular clothes and debated pulling them on over his pants, but the thought of being curled up with Draco skin-to-skin was unbelievably appealing. Harry felt a bone-deep need inside himself to be as close to Draco as he could get, so he grabbed his clothes in a bundle under his arm and made his way to Draco's bedroom.
They both groaned in unison as Draco filled Harry up. These first few moments always took Harry's breath away, and he gasped as he relaxed into the pleasurable burn. Above him, Draco's eyes glittered, his mouth slack with pleasure as his hips pressed up against Harry's arse. He held himself there for several moments while his hands found Harry's and moved them up by Harry's head, pressing them down against the mattress, holding him there.
"What? You know how bad it's getting over there! It's not exactly a surprise that I'd want to help."
Draco nodded, draining the last of his wine before standing and making his way over to Harry, standing between his spread knees.
"Go!" he shouted, and she dashed off, Sean held securely in her arms, his head buried in her neck as she dodged through the fiery obstacle course that was once the hospital's entrance hall. Harry flanked her, tossing up a Shield Charm when something exploded nearby, sending molten hospital cart hurtling towards them, and doing his best to clear their path. The air began to clear somewhat as they neared the door, which Harry realised was open. Shadowy figures emerged from the smoke, clearly guarding the entrance, and Harry felt a spasm of terror before recognition set in.
as rubbish, preferring to read other, more reputable, papers, though they'd both maintained their subscriptions to keep a pulse on what was being said there. It was rare that either of them took it at all seriously.
Harry was nervous enough about telling his friends about his relationship with Draco as it was, but what if somebody were to find about the other things he and Draco did together? He could tell himself over and over again that pretending to be a little kid for a while was nothing to be ashamed of, but it was hard to make himself believe that when he imagined other people discovering that particular proclivity. How would anybody take him seriously? Thinking about the judgemental looks and horrible
family and upbringing—we found each other. I never could have imagined this, that we'd make such a good partnership. After the war… well, I didn't think I'd ever be worthy of
"Listen, Harry—" Parvati began urgently, but all this talk of Draco had given Harry the urge to write to him immediately. He might not be able to tell Draco about his heroic capture, but he could talk about other things. He could tell Draco how much he missed him, how sorry he was for coming to fight this war instead of staying home. How sometimes he wondered if he'd made a mistake. He could beg for forgiveness and daydream of what it would be like to hold Draco in his arms once more. All of that sounded better than thinking about the monster they currently had locked up in the dungeons below.
"That's good to know. I wasn't getting any of those vibes from you. It's perfectly fine if it doesn't ever have a sexual component for you." Draco paused significantly. "It's
Harry's stomach flipped as he tossed the waiting owl a treat and reached for the letter. He opened it with shaking hands, steeling his spine as he prepared himself for whatever was inside.
"Yes, I suppose I did," Draco said softly. He looked back down at his meal, prodding at his fish with a hesitant finger to test the temperature, as a tiny smile plumped his cheeks.
Harry imagined himself in Emily's place, his cheeks burning with shame at the squirmy pleasure that suffused his body at the image. He knew he shouldn't desire it, that it was weak to want to act like a baby, that he should be strong enough not to desperately crave such freedom of responsibility. But now that he'd seen the possibility, he was powerless to ignore its allure. How lovely would it be, to be the one taken care of instead of the one always doing the caring? How liberating, to want for nothing more than to play, and to please?
," Harry moaned, changing course at the last moment, pretending he didn't realise what he'd almost said when his guard had been so lowered.
Quill in hand, he went back to the beginning of the list and began to slowly make his way down, pausing at each activity and really trying to picture it before making his decision and writing his preference. Heat began to ebb and flow within him as he imagined all kinds of kinky, sexy scenarios—interspersed with less enjoyable possibilities—and he learned a whole lot more about himself and his desires than he'd been expecting. Like that the idea of wearing a collar was a shockingly hot image, and that he apparently wasn't entirely opposed to a bit of edgeplay. There were quite a lot of hard limits—anything involving intense pain or another person were immediately out—which once again made Harry worry that he was being too particular, that there wouldn't be enough activities left for Draco to enjoy. He had to remind himself that Draco had said he'd be content even if kink was off the table entirely, but it didn't stop the little niggles of worry from burrowing deep.
, had all but resigned myself to being alone." He looked at Harry, his eyes so clear and grey, piercing straight into Harry's soul. "And that it's
!" Harry blurted out, unable to keep quiet. "It's not like I was by myself, Draco. You were there, too."
A whisper of those earlier nerves stole back across Draco's expression as he reached into the bag. Harry steeled himself, Draco's anxiety setting him on edge. Draco placed the items on the table as he withdrew them: two large, slim books, one decorated with a bright and intricate geometric design that swirled and glimmered, and one with cartoon renderings of magical creatures; and a box of what appeared to be coloured pencils and crayons. Harry's brow furrowed.
The walls around him were cracked and charred, little fires burning and beginning to grow and spread. He hadn't seen another person yet, dead or alive, but he could hear panicked shouts echoing down the halls, letting him know there were still people inside. He ran towards the sound, his heart pounding in his chest, blood rushing through his ears. Time and space seemed to warp around him as he ran, the walls around him shifting and blurring, interposed with snapshots of a different ruined building from what felt like a lifetime ago. Anguish out of place with this current moment enveloped him, threatening to bring him to his knees, but he fought his way through it, forcing it down deep inside where it belonged. There was too much at stake to get lost in memory.
Harry shuddered and kissed Draco hard, very much on board with Draco's plan. He loved all the things they did together in bed, and though he couldn't deny he had a particular fondness for losing his mind on Draco's cock, there was something about fucking Draco that always undid him. Maybe because he knew how much it meant for Draco, who hated being vulnerable, to open himself up to Harry in that way. Maybe because there was something undeniably powerful about reducing his beautifully controlled lover into a quivering mess of desire. It was a gift that Draco trusted him so much, one that never failed to fill Harry with awe and gratefulness.
certainly wouldn't be. Which meant he didn't so much as feel a flicker of guilt about using some of the more unsavoury curses and hexes in his arsenal, ones he'd not learned from the Auror Department, but found in old books at Grimmauld Place. He'd spent a lot of time in the library there in the weeks before he was sent over to Ireland. He had been looking for a different sort of spell at the time, some kind of solution to a problem he'd desperately wanted to solve. Harry hadn't found the answers he'd been searching for, but he'd walked away with a whole host of new knowledge that he'd thought might come in handy while fighting a war.
happen, someday soon, and for now he was content with Draco's company and the memory of his indecent moan as he ate his pudding—a moan that would no doubt feature in tonight's wank session.
Grimmauld Place, being a thoroughly wizarding house, didn't have access to the internet, and the only place he could think of with free access to both computers and the internet were public libraries. It hardly seemed like the done thing, to use the library computer for kinky research purposes, but Harry was getting desperate. He could always cast a (very subtle) Privacy Charm to ensure he wasn't caught and thrown out for being some kind of pervert.
Draco kept right on sucking, apparently unconcerned about Harry coming down his throat. If anything, he seemed to redouble his efforts, moving faster and sucking harder until Harry's toes curled and his nails dug into his knees as he came down Draco's throat with a shuddering cry. Draco's eyes glowed up at him, molton-hot as he swallowed, licking Harry clean as he slowly pulled off.
"The Auror Department has put out some feelers, too," Harry said quietly. There'd been rumours for months, but last week they'd finally made an official announcement. They were asking for volunteer troops from the Aurors, Unspeakables, and Hit Wizards to
Harry sat there for a long moment after he finished with the lists, his half-eaten plate of spaghetti carbonara cold and congealing next to him. He stared at the parchments, which appeared so harmless and innocent lying there on the table; one would never even know the filthy depravity they contained within. He felt the sudden, blinding urge to set them alight with a swift
Normally, his first step when he had something to research was to enlist Hermione's help, but that was definitely not happening this time around. Just the thought of having to explain to Hermione what he was looking up and why made his cheeks flame and his stomach twist. It was bad enough Draco knew about Harry's strange desires; he absolutely didn't need anybody else finding out, especially not one of his best mates. Besides, this wasn't exactly the kind of research that he needed Hermione for anyway. Harry very much doubted the musty old tomes in the Grimmauld Place library had detailed information on full-grown wizards who liked pretending they were little kids.
Draco nodded. "We can head to her place of work if she's not in, but hopefully she was able to take the day off after a night like that."
They settled down, Harry on the sofa and Draco on the adjacent loveseat. He looked just as gorgeously put together as he always did, and as desperately as Harry wanted to touch, he figured it was smart to keep their distance. It would be all too easy to get distracted, and they really did need to talk.
"And being with you makes me happy, so it's settled. No more talk of fucking off to Ireland without me, hmm?" Draco said, his tone light, though Harry could hear the thread of steel beneath it. But then Draco's face brightened as he grinned over at Harry. "If you want to travel so badly, we can go somewhere together. Somewhere where a war isn't being fought. Somewhere… tropical." His expression went dreamy. "Like Fiji. I've heard it's beautiful there. I've always wanted to go."
Draco cleaned them both off with a quick spell, then tossed his wand onto the bedside table before burrowing under the covers, pulling Harry against him.
"Merlin," Harry said in exasperation. This wasn't the first 'Auror consult' Seamus had requested of him. "What have his housemates done now?"
Things felt different now that they were… something. Harry wasn't sure he was quite ready to call what they were doing dating, exactly, even though last night had most definitely been a date, the two of them sharing a nice meal together before Draco walked him home. It had been relatively chaste compared to some of the other first dates Harry had been on, but that goodnight kiss on Harry's doorstep had made Harry's stomach flutter and cramp with want, and it had taken all of Harry's willpower not to invite Draco inside for a 'nightcap'.
"And yet somehow the rest of your colleagues manage to go entire months without gracing my examination room," Malfoy said with a sniff as he looked down at Harry's chart. "It says here you believe your arm is broken?"
His brow furrowed. Blaise's villa was unoccupied for a good portion of the year, so there wasn't any reason for unexpected visitors to come calling. Hardly anybody knew that Harry was here in the first place, and the few that did wouldn't just show up unannounced—if there was an emergency, Ron and Hermione would come through the Floo address he'd sent them, otherwise they'd write first. Slowly, he got up from the sofa and made his way towards the incessant knocking. Wand at the ready, he warily opened the door and promptly froze when he saw who was on the other side.
Blaise rolled his eyes. "Mmhmm. Nobody here believes that story, not even your unobservant Gryffindor friends."
, partially because he couldn't help but remember how good it had felt, how happy and relaxed he'd been doodling at Draco's feet. As much as he wanted to instinctively deny the whole episode as an aberration never to be repeated, there was a part of him that cried out at the thought of never getting to experience that freedom again. Draco was right. He needed time to think.
Robards looked deeply uncomfortable, as if we wanted to comfort Harry but wasn't quite sure how. Strong arms wrapped around him, and he was filled with a momentary elation before he realised those arms weren't Draco's, but Ron's. He sagged into him as Robards gave him another compassionate look.
than liked Draco, and though Harry was pretty sure it was too soon for that other L-word, he thought it probably wasn't far off with the way things were going.
"As lovely as that would no doubt be, this was just for you. It really is getting late, and I've got an early start tomorrow."
Blaise tipped his glass in acknowledgement. "Fair enough," he agreed, a knowing glint in his eye that made Harry feel slightly uneasy. "I'll stop pestering you about it… for now."
Harry took a deep breath, calming the anger and instinctive desire to lash out that was usually his go-to when mortified. It was awkward feeling so vulnerable, particularly in front of Draco, a person who, historically, had not been someone Harry could have ever trusted with something so intimate. But Draco wasn't laughing at him, wasn't looking for ways to shame or hurt him. In fact, there was something equally exposed in Draco's anxious gaze and bitten bottom lip as he waited for Harry's reaction. Yes, this was new and strange and a little uncomfortable, but Harry had been filled with these confusing, yearning thoughts all week now, unsure what he wanted or how to go about getting it. And here Draco was, offering him an easy way to test things out. There didn't have to be anything more to it if Harry didn't want there to be.
Harry tempered his approach, adjusting to account for the switch from one-on-one to three-on-one. By some unspoken agreement, Harry continued with his offensive assault, doing his best to keep her occupied and distracted while Parvati and Fathi got into position, easily deflecting the occasional spells Foley lobbed their way. It wasn't a new tactic, but it'd never made him feel so much like a third wheel before. Which was ridiculous, his role here was crucial, and the three of them worked well together. But he was used to being part of a
"Yes, looks like a fractured ulna. It's a clean break, so I should be able to mend it without too much time or difficulty."
Harry sighed and nodded, his stomach churning with anxiety as he gestured towards the living room with the air of a man marching to his death. It wasn't doing him any good to keep trying to put things off, though, and he was already about as ready as he could get.
"Hey, so I think I'm gonna head home," Harry said in his best attempt at casualness as he walked into Draco's living room.
There were two place settings on the table, and it was no mystery whose was whose. Draco's meal was set on fine china and looked to be some kind of roast meat with sprouts and potatoes. Harry's meal, on the other hand, appeared to be alphabet soup, presented in a bright-red bowl clearly meant for children with a matching spoon and plastic cup. Harry's stomach growled, reminding him that he actually
"I was planning to tell you about all of this eventually, of course. It's something I enjoy, and most of my past relationships have had an element of kink, but it's not… it's not something I
It had been three days since he and Draco had conducted that particularly illuminating interview with Emily Sheffield, and Harry could not stop thinking about it. He thought about it at work as he finally made his way through his backlog of paperwork. He thought about it at home as he mechanically chopped vegetables for a homemade ratatouille. He thought about it late at night as he lay in bed staring up at the ceiling, unable to fall asleep. It wasn't the actual interview itself that occupied his every thought—sadly, violent assaults on solitary witches weren't exactly an uncommon occurrence—but rather the dynamic he and Draco had witnessed between the victim and her fiancé. That, and the information Draco had confided in him afterwards about his own… predilections.
The barman placed a foaming beer down in front of Harry and Harry handed over several Sickles before making his way back to the table. He settled into the free chair next to Blaise, who'd become a regular at these outings about six months ago when he and Ginny had started dating. Things had been a bit tense at first between him and the rest of the group, but he'd doggedly continued to show up, and eventually the tension had more or less eased. Harry had discovered, much to his surprise, that he and Blaise actually got on quite well. They'd formed a friendship of sorts, albeit not one that had progressed beyond the confines of pub night or the occasional Sunday lunch at the Burrow when they were both in attendance.
Once again, the silence dragged on between them, and Draco bit his lip, his expression nervous and unsure.
"Just think about whatever you've got planned for us after we get back from dinner," he said in a throaty murmur, nuzzling into Draco's neck. "It'll be our reward for making it through in one piece."
"Sorry, Harry. I know you keep saying this is just dinner with your mates, but we don't have the best history, do we? And there will be… children present. You know how I feel about babies."
The silence between them was strangely comfortable. Harry hadn't ever been all that keen on small talk, and it seemed Draco wasn't either, the both of them content in one another's company without the need to fill the air with nervous chatter. Just being near Draco filled Harry with a buzzing warmth, his heart leaping every time their fingertips brushed, which was frequent enough to make Harry suspect he wasn't the only one looking forward to each 'accidental' touch.
Harry couldn't deny there was something exciting about the waiting though, the slow build-up of tension crackling beneath every glance, every word. They were still finding their legs, figuring out if there could ever be something serious between them, but Harry was fairly certain when they
, none of that was safe or easy. It was uncertain and unknown, thrilling and terrifying, each day a new discovery as they figured out how they fit. Normally Harry's stomach was a jumbled mess every time they were together, filled with butterflies and want, tentative excitement tempered with caution. Right now, all of that was gone, and it was a relief. Those were the thoughts and cares of adult Harry, and for now, at least, they were no longer his concern.
Ron was standing in the doorway, his freckles standing out like drops of blood against his unnaturally pale face. His fearful expression made Harry's heart momentarily stop. Ron was panting, like he'd run all the way here from the Floos, and his eyes were wide with shock.
"Any progress?" Harry asked Parvati the moment she came up from the dungeons. He was sitting on the floor up against the wall across from the door that led down to the lower levels, waiting for an update. Parvati had been part of the group that was currently questioning Foley, the group that
Harry grinned at the thought, a gentle wave of desire cresting over him as he thought about all the filthy things he wanted to do with Draco. It had only been a couple of days since they'd last been together, but Merlin had Harry missed Draco's mouth. And his arse. And his cock. And
"Agreed. Byrne has a high level of confidence in this information, but he'll be spending the next week continuing his reconnaissance to confirm. In the meantime, we'll proceed with the intelligence we've been given."
Harry had been here for four days, and his thoughts were no clearer than they'd been when he'd left Britain. As soon as Harry got the letter from Blaise confirming that Harry could use his villa, he'd immediately sent off a missive to work requesting two weeks of leave. Robards had clearly been a bit annoyed at the lack of advanced notice, but he'd been unable to deny Harry's request, especially considering how much time off he had banked.
Now, confronted with the man he hadn't been able to stop thinking about all week and listening as Draco tried to talk him through his anxiety spiral, Harry finally felt strong enough to go after what he wanted. He didn't want to lose Draco, and he didn't want to lose that peace he'd found with him either, even if it was unconventional. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't understand it—maybe
"Wait!" Harry called before Malfoy could leave. Malfoy heaved a heavy sigh before turning around with the air of somebody greatly put upon as Harry continued, "What are you doing this Friday?"
Draco's smile was beatific as he snuggled into the bedsheets, freshly clean. "I'm glad we're in agreement. Now that you've got me used to a regular dicking, it would be cruel of you to deprive me."
Harry huffed out a laugh. "I know. And it's not like I'm dying to fight another war, or for us to be separated. I just feel like I
Draco groaned, his hands flying up to Harry's hips, gripping tight. "I'll call you whatever the hell you want, just don't stop."
and get rid of the evidence of his apparent loss of sense and reason. The thought of Draco actually reading through the lists and seeing what Harry had written, knowing the wicked things Harry dreamed about… It was enough to make Harry's skin break out in a cold sweat.
"Has the space helped?" Harry flushed and looked away. "That's what I thought," Draco said softly. "I think it's time for another one of those talks you enjoy so much. Let's go sit down."
His hand found his dick, sliding slowly up and down as he coated it with the rest of the lube, hypnotising Harry with his movements. Fuck, but Harry wanted to get his mouth on him, wanted to feel that thick length on his tongue, but that would have to wait for another day. Tonight, he'd rather have it in his arse, and he spread his legs a little wider just to make that fact abundantly clear. Draco huffed out a laugh as he shuffled close, rubbing his cock along the cleft of Harry's arse.
, something he and Draco were still navigating, still deciding if it was worth the risk. Some might even think they were being overly cautious—which wasn't something Harry was often accused of—but he knew once they crossed that line, it'd be too late to take it back, and Harry felt they were more than justified in worrying that a relationship between them would be doomed to implode.
Parvati put a hand on Fathi's arm, and he looked down at her. Harry couldn't understand the look in her eyes, the devastation, the helplessness, the weary acceptance. But he
He'd thrown himself into his work over the past few days, glad that he had something to focus all of his attention on. Every spare moment when he hadn't been absorbed by work was spent obsessing over his plans for tomorrow night, and there was only so much of that he could take before he exploded. He was already vibrating with excitement and anxiety as it was, wondering if he should confirm his reservation with the restaurant tomorrow for the third time as he walked from the Portkey station to his office,
"Fiji, eh?" he said, leaning over to press a kiss against Draco's lips. "I think I like the sound of that."
inside of him, rubbing right up against his prostate as Harry rocked up and down on Draco's cock. He could already tell this was going to be over embarrassingly quickly, but he didn't mind, not when they'd already agreed they'd be doing this again, that this wouldn't be the first, last, and only time.
Malfoy seemed reluctantly impressed at the forethought, which probably shouldn't have made Harry feel as warm and tingly as it did. His cheeks flushed as he activated the Portkey, and a moment later the both of them were stumbling into Harry's bed.
There was a mirror hanging on the wall and Harry peered into it with a small amount of reservation, unsure of what he would see. He was immediately captivated. It was wild how much a set of clothes could age somebody, or rather,
He was panicked and desperate as he burst through the doors, his mind so far from the deadly focus he'd felt when he'd been duelling Foley. Then, he'd been channelling his anger into one single purpose, intent on his task to destroy; saving people was so much harder than hurting them. He'd failed so many people in his lifetime, people who'd cared for him, trusted him, depended on him to protect them. The weight of those losses pressed down on him as he rushed through the corridors, checking each room for survivors who'd been left behind. He knew saving others wouldn't make up for the people he'd failed to protect, but maybe it would ease the burden. Maybe it would make it possible to bear.
"Okay, what's going on?" Harry finally demanded when Draco shifted for the thousandth time. He was grateful to have something to focus on other than uncomfortable desires he had no interest in pursuing. Really. "And what's in the bag?"
played on a loop in his head. Draco was why Harry was doing this, the reason why he was here. He had to make the world safe again, safe for the people he loved. Draco was his guiding star, his guardian angel.
"Oh, Harry." Draco's hands twitched as if he wanted to reach out and touch, but they stayed folded in his lap. "You're not weird or a freak, and liking kink doesn't even make you all that different. There are a lot of people who are into various aspects of kink and BDSM—it just feels like there aren't that many of us because it's not something we really talk about publicly." He growled, clearly frustrated, though it became obvious as he continued that it was directed at himself, not Harry. "Another way I've fucked this up. I should have introduced you to the community straight away instead of keeping you all to myself. I was worried it would be too much, that it would overwhelm you and scare you off, but it left you feeling isolated and alone instead. If you'd like, I could bring you along to our next munch and you could meet some other people in the lifestyle. Maybe talk to a few other subs about their experiences."
This was their shot, the only one they'd had in the six months since Harry came over to fight, and he'd be damned if he let Foley slip through their hands; who knew when they'd have another opportunity like this? She needed to pay, and Harry needed this unbearable war to end, needed to get back home to Draco. Draco, who had been stretched so thin for months and months before Harry had left, more than overworked between all his hours at St Mungo's and volunteering to provide medical care for the refugees from this godforsaken war. Draco who'd
In his heavy, sluggish mind, Harry had the thought that he might be dying. The idea of it was accompanied by a profound sense of relief.
there as a spy. If I were to rely solely on the information I've been told, I'd not be of much use to the resistance."
Harry had to rescue them. He couldn't let another person die, not if there was a chance he could save them.
Draco's brow furrowed as he thought it over. "Yes," he said slowly. "I suppose the concepts are… similar."
The moment Draco's cock was free from his pants and trousers, Harry was swallowing it down, choking himself a little in his eagerness.
"And how confident are we of Byrne's intel on the time and place? Given how critical that is to the success of the mission, I'd say we need to be pretty damn sure."
Harry shuddered so violently that there was no way Draco could have missed it. His smile turned indulgent, generous.
"Fuck," Draco growled, his hips continuing to bounce on Harry's slowly softening prick as he batted Harry's limp hand out of the way and began to fist himself quickly. It didn't take much longer before he reached his own climax, his arse clamping down around Harry as he spilled onto Harry's stomach.
Harry flushed, Draco's words stirring up his libido once more. "I definitely think the play is non-sexual for me, at least it seems to be right now. Sex isn't something I was thinking about at all."
, but that time would come later. After. When Harry wasn't so laser-focused on getting Draco's dick in him as soon as humanly possible.
"Take me to bed," Harry murmured against Draco's lips, too addicted to his kisses to pull away entirely.
All at once all the anger and pain that had been fueling him for the past few hours, for the past few
They were sat next to each other at a large table that was crowded around with various members of the Irish Magical Resistance. He and Parvati were in Ireland on loan from the Auror Department in London, both of them having volunteered to help fight against Dark Lady Foley who'd been wreaking havoc in the country for years, and who had recently overthrown the Irish Ministry. It was a different time, a different place, with different people, but looking around this table always filled Harry with a pang as he recalled the Order meetings at Grimmauld Place. It felt like a lifetime ago, though it had only been seven years since the end of that war. Being an adult at the table now, it was hard not to cringe as he remembered how difficult he'd been back then, filled with the righteous anger only a teenager could truly manage. He now knew from experience that these strategy sessions were not nearly as exciting as he'd imagined them to be back when he'd been barred from attending them.
The wards in front of him shimmered and nine figures suddenly appeared at the edge of the forest, like a mirage solidifying. Unlike the resistance members, who were dressed in black to better blend in with the night foliage, Foley and her followers were clad in the rich jewel tones they'd become known for—Foley, it seemed, had a fondness for colour. In Harry's experience, that was somewhat of an oddity amongst Dark Lords, but at least it made it easier to differentiate the enemy from their own at a glance.
"I understand that, I do, Harry—you know how important it's been for me to choose the right side of the war this time around, and if going over and fighting had been the only way for me to do that, I'd be there right now." He scrunched his nose and gnawed on his lip, a sure sign he was thinking something out. "Maybe we can try and find other ways for you to get involved that would feel more productive and tangible but don't require you being out on the front lines." He hesitated. "You know, my expertise would be valued just as much in a war zone…" Harry winced at the thought of Draco going over there, putting himself at
Harry paused on the doorstep, a bag of takeaway in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. Realising he'd need to free a hand to knock, he shifted the handle of the plastic takeaway bag from his left palm to around his wrist, then switched the bottle of wine from his right hand to his left. With his newly freed hand, he knocked on the door to Draco's flat, his heart racing. His hands were already damp with sweat, and he wiped the palm of his free hand on his trousers while gripping the slippery wine bottle harder with the other, praying the glass wouldn't slip loose and shatter on the ground. There had to be useful spells for exactly these kinds of situations, but bugger if Hogwarts had taught him anything so useful in everyday life as that. He'd have to ask Molly the next time he was at the Burrow—it seemed like the kind of practical spellwork she was particularly proficient at.
longer dry spells and had been perfectly fine, but his body was used to regular sex now and wasn't keen on going without.
Harry's lips pulled into a smile, charmed and amused entirely against his will. "Normally I'd go for the savage route, but I got us a couple of different items to split, so I suppose we could make use of proper dishes, just this once."
teenage boys, all of whom seemed to agree that having a big dick was basically the best thing that could happen to a bloke. But Harry had quickly realised that, contrary to Seamus's emphatic assertions, there
Harry's belly flipped but he nodded, and something seemed to change within Draco, a subtle shift in the way he carried himself that made Harry sit up and take notice.
. We should have been calling for the Healers and admitting her to Janus Thickney, not interviewing her as if she wasn't in the middle of a psychotic break!"
So he took out his frustration with barbed banter and snarky repartee that Malfoy seemed all too willing to return. Without the malicious undercurrent, Harry found himself quite enjoying the back and forth, though he found it did nothing to quell his desire. If anything, it was like a very long, extended bout of foreplay, the kind that made Harry desperate for the main event. Even now, dazed and panting with pain in a grotty alleyway, Harry's prick made a valiant effort to chub up at the sight of Malfoy all sweaty and worked up from the duel. There was a smudge of dirt along one sharp cheekbone that Harry kind of wanted to lick off, which was probably a sign that the pain was beginning to get to him, because there was no way a mouthful of dirt would be pleasant, no matter how delectable Malfoy's skin might be under normal circumstances. Harry's gaze drifted upwards, taking in the furrow of Malfoy's brow, which indicated an unusual amount of concern as he gazed at Harry.
about the possibility, it was clearly the kind of thing that could easily blow up in both of their faces. It was only natural to be curious after what he'd witnessed between Emily and Graham. With Draco's subsequent confession, it wasn't exactly a leap that Harry might start to wonder and fantasise. It didn't mean that Harry wanted any of that for real, it just meant he had a healthy imagination and a natural inquisitiveness—a trait that had got him into all kinds of trouble in the not-so-distant past. Just because he'd thought about it, it didn't mean he really wanted it, or that he needed to make those curious thoughts a reality.
"What if it weren't me you were being good for? What if"—he gasped, his hips twitching, clearly close to his peak—"what if you were being good for
"I can only imagine," Draco said kindly. "Is she too far down to speak to us? If not, and if it's within your limits, I assure you my partner and I won't judge. Since we're already here, it really would be preferable if we could speak to her now so that we can get to work on bringing her assailant to justice."
"Shit, sorry," Harry mumbled, grabbing hold of Draco's arm to keep himself from pitching forward onto the pavement. His bicep was firm beneath Harry's fingers, the muscle flexing as he righted himself. Harry stared at where he gripped Draco, struck with the knowledge that he'd never seen Draco's bare arms before, and was overcome with the sudden and powerful urge to do so right that very moment. He'd always been attracted to muscular, athletic bodies—in men and women alike—and the sinewy strength beneath his grip sent a bolt of lust straight through him.
"I didn't get on with the person you were when we were back at Hogwarts, but I know full well people can change," Harry said. He wasn't sure yet whether or not Malfoy
"Yeah, okay, anything," Harry babbled, too lost in the sparks of pleasure shooting out from his groin with each roll of Draco's hips to pay his words much mind.
Harry bit his lip and nodded. "Yeah, I can do that. You're not the only one who struggles with talking about emotions and personal stuff, but I promise to work on it. I want to be better at it. I really mean it, you know. I was a git for running off without properly talking things over with you, and I've been a mess all week. Having you here is the first time I've felt like myself. I want to be with you, I want this to work."
It had taken quite a while before Harry realised he wasn't the only one feeling that way, and even longer for him to actually do something about it. Harry couldn't deny that he wanted Draco, but he still wasn't entirely convinced that dating him was a good idea. He wasn't sure a relationship between them could ever really work. It had taken a lot of hard work to get him and Draco to a place of friendship instead of animosity, and though Harry had seen first-hand the strides Draco had made to become a better person, Harry still struggled with his feelings for him. It was one thing to believe that Draco wasn't the hateful, bigoted child he'd once been and decide he was worth befriending; it was another thing entirely to want him so desperately, knowing all the terrible things he'd done. It was something Harry was truthfully still coming to terms with, just as he knew Draco was still working on making peace with his own past while figuring out how to atone for his sins and build a new future for himself. Draco had his own reasons to be wary, to be cautious of a romantic entanglement with the
send over and help out in Ireland if the situation escalated. Their Ministry had requested reinforcements from their allies, and apparently they'd finally convinced Britain to take the threat seriously. They were still working out the details, but Harry knew he wasn't the only one with the urge to go and fight. Parvati had told him in confidence that she was planning on signing up, though she wanted to get her sister's blessing first, which wasn't going well.
"Newton. Graham Newton. I'm Emily's fiancé." He held out a hand to Harry, then Draco, his grip dry and firm.
Draco flashed him a somewhat sheepish smile. "I think that might have been an unrealistic aspiration, given our history."
It didn't take long to finish out the fight after that, the ending sudden and rather anticlimactic. Fathi managed to incapacitate Foley with a Stunning Charm that Parvati expertly followed up with an
He launched onto the platform, completely ignoring the queue. Thankfully he was still in his Auror robes and he was Harry bloody Potter, and the grumbles quickly cut off when they caught sight of who was cutting in. It took him a few seconds longer than usual to clear his mind enough to Apparate, but eventually he focused so intently on Draco that he was whisked away to the street outside the centre.
Draco frowned, an adorable furrow forming between his brows. "My Healing spells are impeccable," Draco said with a sniff. "Your side probably looks better than it did before you got cut up."
Harry's chest expanded, because there it was again, further proof that Draco had grown, that he was a different man, a
Ron must have really been keen for his anniversary plans because he didn't even bristle at Malfoy's referring to Hermione as Granger instead of Granger-Weasley. He just flashed Malfoy a shockingly sunny smile before nodding at them both.
what she thought. He stiffened and made to push himself up, but she reached out, grabbing his arm and pulling him down.
a work night after all—but you've been so good and brave this evening and I think you deserve a reward."
"All the others are quite distracted by Seamus's latest tale of housemate woe," Blaise told Harry as he sat down. Harry snorted. Poor Seamus lived in a house with five other people, all of whom appeared to be absolutely bonkers. They'd all tried to convince Seamus to move out at one time or another, but Seamus never did; Harry was pretty certain Seamus actually liked the chaos, if for no other reason than he always had a new story to tell at pub night.
Draco stared at him. It was as if he saw something in Harry's expression that he wanted to dig into, but he appeared to let it go, for now. He relaxed back, giving Harry an encouraging smile as he pulled several folded sheets of parchment from his jacket pocket.
," before pulling out of Harry's suddenly slack mouth and wanking himself fast and hard until he came into the palm he had cupped over the head of his dick.
Draco was waiting for him on the other side, pausing mid-stride as if he'd been pacing when Harry stumbled through the fireplace. Harry gave him a somewhat awkward smile. What was the protocol here? Should he act like this was just a regular date? Would they jump right in?
Draco's eyes widened momentarily before he shoved a truly gigantic chip into his mouth. He hummed questioningly, as if he hadn't quite heard Harry the first time. A little flag popped up in the back of Harry's mind and he narrowed his eyes. Draco was stalling.
Despite expecting the sight, Harry's heart still leapt when he walked into his bedroom and saw Draco Malfoy in his bed. He was sitting up and leaning back against the headboard, his brow furrowed as he read the newspaper spread out over his legs. The bright morning sun shone in through the open curtains, giving the whole scene a light, ethereal quality. Draco looked like an angel, not that Harry was foolish enough to tell him that. In the tree just outside the window, the family of goldfinches that had made their nest there chirped merrily, and Harry smiled as he watched the bobbing heads of the recently-hatched chicks vying for food and attention from their parents.
"I'm sorry, Harry," Parvati said, her entire body wilted with evident misery. She was normally so confident and collected; he'd never seen her such a wreck. She seemed totally lost and more than a little terrified. Of him? But no, she was grabbing hold of one of his hands and squeezing it tight, as if worried he might disappear right in front of her. "I don't know how to do this. You're my friend, the closest one I've got here, and I don't want to lose you."
"You're close already," Draco said hoarsely, looking up at him, his silver eyes seeming to glow in the low lamplight. "I've never been with somebody so keen." The rough, awed tone of his voice made it clear that he liked Harry's eagerness very much, and Harry picked up the pace, crying out as Draco filled him again and again.
"We also don't know what kind of little you are—I doubt you'll be too bratty, but the Daddy Dom I spoke to about all of this has a boy who likes throwing tantrums. For him, it's part of the experience, as is the punishment that follows"—he flashed Harry a warning look that made his cheeks heat—"but it doesn't mean he wants the scene to end. Having a safe word makes all of that clearer."
Draco went still and his eyes were dark with want when Harry pulled back to look at him, his cheeks hot. He'd not said that word often, and never outside the heat of the moment, when Draco would kindly allow him to pretend he'd not said it at all. He was hoping the word would halt Draco's tailspin and remind him of the things he
"I heard I'm with you today," drawled a smooth, familiar voice that sent shivers tingling down Harry's spine. He raised his head from his hands, his heart skipping a beat as he locked eyes with Draco Malfoy, who was lounging gracefully against the edge of Sue Li's empty desk.
"Goldstein owled in this morning, which means the case he and his partner were working on will need to be put on hold for the time being." Harry swallowed, realising what Robards was intending the moment before he continued, "Why don't you go ahead and take Malfoy with you, he should be free today."
"I know," Draco replied patiently, unruffled by Harry's confusion. "I went through your forms thoroughly, but I find it's best to have a safe word regardless of what activities we engage in so that it's unequivocally clear when something crosses a line and you need to end a scene. Just because we won't be playing with consent doesn't mean there aren't instances where you might tell me no without wanting the scene to end."
"No, Harry. You don't want to see that. There's not"—he cleared his throat—"there's no way to make a positive identification."
"Oh," Harry said, oddly pleased that Draco had been looking into things as well. "I did some research, too. There were definitely some things that didn't appeal to me, but some of it…" He gave Draco a sheepish smile. "I think maybe I'd like to try it. With you."
Harry had expected to perhaps find Emily in bed, resting after her ordeal. What he hadn't expected was to see the woman—who appeared to be close to Harry's age—sitting in the middle of the floor surrounded by baby dolls. She was wearing a frilly pink dress, much like the kind that Rose was always begging Ron and Hermione to buy for her, much to Hermione's consternation. Emily's hair was braided into two neat pigtails, a bright pink bow adorning the end of each plait. Harry blinked, looking instinctively over at Draco in confusion, who gave him another pointed stare.
"These nice gentlemen are here to speak to you about last night, princess," Graham was saying to Emily, crouching down so he was on her level. "Do you think you could put your toys down for a moment and answer their questions?"
Harry blinked, feeling as if he was coming out of a daze, his entire being relaxed to the point of sleepiness. His mind was hazy, but every one of his blurry thoughts was focused on the soothing motions of Draco's fingers carding through his hair. It felt so nice, so good, and all Harry wanted to do was nuzzle into Draco's hand so he did, his heart leaping with joy at the distinct sound of pleasure that escaped Draco's lips.
In one fluid motion he rolled them over, pinning Harry to the bed and taking Harry's lips in a hungry kiss. Harry shuddered into it, sliding his hands through Draco's hair and arching up into the firm weight of his body. They'd barely even started but Harry was keyed up and ready to go, already desperate for Draco's touch. He wondered what Draco had planned, eagerly hoping that getting fucked was on the menu. They'd not gone that far yet, and it had been ages since Harry'd had a proper shag. Right now, getting fucked through the mattress sounded like just about the best idea ever.
"No touching. Keep your hands on your knees or I'll stop." Something hot slithered through Harry's body at Draco's command, at how clearly Draco managed to control the situation even though he was the one on his knees. He wanted to obey Draco, wanted to make him happy, so he slid his hands to his kneecaps, holding on for dear life as Draco swallowed him down.
"Why don't you get on the bed for me, sweetheart." Harry shuddered at the endearment, his cock twitching appreciatively, and Draco's lips stretched into a satisfied smile. Draco nodded towards the bed. "Go on, then."
"You," Draco said sharply, his voice low, "are incorrigible. Good boys don't tease, not when they don't have time to follow through."
Draco flashed him a wry grin, but he edged back just a tad, enough so that the scent and feel of him wasn't quite so overwhelming. Harry took a deep breath, focused on their destination, and Apparated them both.
Harry wasn't particularly familiar with BDSM, but he'd imagined it with more leather and paddles, and less princess dresses and baby dolls.
Three of Foley's guard hit the ground, immediately incapacitated, but the other six, and Foley herself, were all quicker on their feet, springing into action as they ducked and shielded themselves from the onslaught. Harry jumped eagerly into the fray, calling on all his old Auror training as he worked to subdue the enemy. Foley's guard encircled her, doing their best to create a barrier while she continued trying to create a Portkey and make her escape.
"Back at their flat, you recognised him. Graham was all set to kick us out before you all but told him that you knew he was into some kinky shit and that we wouldn't say anything about it. He just looked like a normal bloke to me, so how did you know about the Daddy stuff?"
Draco nodded and gave Harry a gentle smile before leaning forward to brush a soft kiss against Harry's lips.
, seeing as how getting injured ended up with him half-naked in his bedroom with Draco Malfoy, maybe it wasn't
Committed to his course, Harry dragged himself out of bed and hurriedly got dressed. He stopped at a café down the street for a flat white and a croissant, and was finished with both by the time he arrived at Finsbury Library. He settled in at one of the free public computers, cast a gentle Privacy Charm to prevent any nosy Nellies from getting an eyeful, and got to researching.
Harry couldn't help himself; he walked up to Draco and gave him a hard, passionate kiss. God, he was so in love with Draco he could hardly stand it. He was so smart, and courageous, and fucking
"I'm just antsy I suppose," he continued. "The last week has been pretty quiet—that always makes me wary."
It was immediately clear that Harry was trapped, helplessly pinned by the heavy chunk of ceiling lying across his lower half. The shock of it left Harry stunned, and already Harry could feel his strength leaving him; he wasn't sure if he could still feel his legs. His wand had tumbled out of his hand when he fell and lay uselessly a good ten feet away, well out of his reach. Harry was decent at wandless magic, but it required an immense amount of will and focus, and right that moment all of his body's energy was focused on the hunk of metal and cement crushing him to the ground.
"Next time," Harry began, kneeling up and reaching behind himself to take hold of Draco's cock. "Next time you can finger me until I beg for it, but right now I really just want to get fucked."
Sitting there, though, drinking his beer, surrounded by his friends and thinking of Draco, Harry realised it wasn't too far for
Their relationship was never going to be simple, but things between them had become so intense so quickly, and Harry couldn't have anticipated the additional confusion that the kink had thrown into the mix. Every time Harry had thought he'd made his peace with it—that there was nothing wrong or shameful about his desires—he remembered the hot shuddery feeling he'd felt at the idea of calling Draco
"Right," Harry said with a grin. He didn't have to be told twice and quickly began to tug off his clothes. It hadn't even been a full week since they'd last had sex, but Harry was already desperate and keyed up. Harry had experienced
Draco hummed thoughtfully, wriggling beneath Harry as his large hands slid down Harry's back to squeeze his bum.
," Harry said emphatically, his gaze caught on Draco's cock. It was flushed pink and leaking at the tip, just long and thick enough to make Harry really feel it.
"Yes. Maybe. I don't know." Harry threw up his hands in exasperation. "We're still figuring it out, aren't we? But I do know I want somebody who sees me as a partner, not a child they have to take care of."
"We can't, of course, completely discount the possibility, but I've been able to verify the information from a number of sources and believe it to be genuine. I wasn't directly informed—as you say, I'm not sufficiently high enough in Lady Foley's estimation to warrant such a confidence—but I
Harry hadn't ever thought about a Dom needing to end a scene because of their own crossed boundaries.
"Not on purpose!" she cried out, her expression rumpled with guilt. "But you can't deny your magic has been a little… erratic since you came here. And when you were duelling Foley… you almost lost control. You wanted to kill her."
"Right, well, it's getting late, yeah? I should probably be heading out." He began to walk at a very quick pace that was definitely
The manor butted up against a large forest, and given the natural cover it provided, they'd decided to have the majority of their strike team waiting for Foley in a secluded clearing they estimated would be her most likely point of exit. Fathi had stationed a few other groups at other possible locations around the perimeter of the manor, and Harry had provided each team leader with an updated version of the message coins Hermione had created for the DA back at Hogwarts so that they could communicate as soon as Foley and her team made an appearance. Something told Harry that
"Yeah," Harry agreed grimly, a heavy dose of guilt joining in the riot of unpleasant emotions wreaking havoc on his insides. "Have we heard from Fathi in regards to the rescue attempt back at the Manor?"
Draco grabbed his wand with his free hand and whispered a spell Harry didn't recognise. For a moment, nothing seemed to happen, and then Harry gasped as sparkling light began to pour from the pages of the book that Draco had Levitated in front of him. He looked down at Harry, seeming to realise Harry hadn't ever seen anything like this before.
"Can we—?" Harry broke off and took a deep breath. "Look, can we talk about this later? I'm not upset at you for pushing, that's part of your role here. I just need time to process, and in order to do that, I need some space."
He'd been mostly silent during their walk home from the pub, and it was obvious something was weighing heavily on his mind. He'd seemed fine at the beginning of the night, and
made Harry feel awkward and oddly exposed. Draco had emphasised that there was nothing shameful or bad about Harry's desires, but he couldn't help the small voice inside him that insisted this was, if not outright wrong, then still weird and freakish. But his trust in Draco and his desire to rediscover the peace he'd felt on Friday was great enough to override that voice. For now.
"I apologise for the delay. Is Emily available now? This shouldn't take long, and the sooner we can get her official statement, the sooner we can start investigating."
"Yeah," Harry said, managing to force the words out of his dry throat. "Robards needs me to take a statement on an assault case. You're my babysitter."
A faint whimper caught his ear and brought him to a stop. He could still hear the frantic shouting up ahead, the sound of a battle, and of somebody leading others to an exit, perhaps. It seemed as if whoever was helping to evacuate had already swept through this corridor, but there it was again, that sniffling cry. Harry cautiously made his way towards the only door that wasn't thrown entirely open.
Did Harry see himself more as an adult baby (under two years old), a little (ages three to seven), or a middle (ages eleven to seventeen)? That one was easy enough. He didn't much see the appeal of infantilism, personally, and he wasn't sure what was so great about being a teenager either, all acne spots and crushing insecurity and helpless anger. But being little… He marked down his preference.
Harry was used to following his instincts, and finding his inner child—whatever that meant—was what this whole afternoon was supposed to be about, so he listened to his gut. He turned around, grinning at Draco, a flash of pride going through him at Draco's pleased expression.
Draco barked a sudden laugh. "Oh, neither, really. I mean, I suppose I'd say I'm more like Graham than Emily, but you remember how I said the dynamics are different depending on what you're into?" Harry nodded, and Draco continued, "Well, most of the men I've been with weren't really coming to Draco Malfoy for the nurturing sort of Dom." He flashed a small, self-deprecating smile. "I can see the appeal of that kind of dynamic, for both parties"—he gave Harry a strangely penetrating stare—"and I've gone there a few times before for partners in the past, but it's never led to any kind of sustained arrangement."
. Tonight"—Harry shifted until his lips were mere millimeters from Draco's—"want to make out like teenagers until we fall asleep?"
something. It would be his pleasure to take each and every one of these bastards down. Just as soon as Fathi gave the bloody signal.
a child. Normally he'd temper his excitement, but wasn't the whole point of this thing with Draco that he didn't have to tamp down his childish impulses?
For now, he settled for offering Draco a mind-blowing fuck, screwing into him with the hard, deep strokes that he knew Draco preferred. Draco let out a series of gratifying moans in response, wrapping his arms and legs around Harry as he urged Harry down for another kiss. It was messy and wet, more a bumping of mouths than a proper snog, the both of them more focused on the pleasure of Harry thrusting in and out of Draco's body.
"Of course, I absolutely understand," Draco said, sincere and empathetic. Harry stared at him, entirely lost, as Graham turned and walked up the stairs. Draco made a move to follow, but Harry grabbed hold of his robes and held him back.
Draco let Harry pay on the provision that he'd cover their next date, and Harry knew he wasn't the only one feeling slightly giddy at the tacit promise that there
Emily nodded. "Will you play, too? Sophie wants her prince." She looked over towards the toy chest in the corner where the handsome crowned head of a male doll was sticking out of the chaos.
He didn't bother waiting for Parvati to answer, just flashed her a tired smile and turned to head up the stairs, ignoring her crestfallen expression. Harry would apologise for his rudeness tomorrow.
—could kiss. Harry had always enjoyed a good toe-curling snog but had found them increasingly hard to come by as he got older and his dates seemed to view kissing as an annoying prelude to the main event. But it was clear Draco enjoyed kissing just for kissing's sake, because nobody became this good at it without an honest love of snogging.
The last thing in the world Harry wanted to do was hurt Draco, and he had to admit, fucking off to fight abroad would certainly put a crimp in his upcoming plans. He thought of the ring currently burning a hole through the top drawer of his desk at work, and the reservation he'd just made a few months from now at Draco's favourite restaurant. He'd ask now, tonight, but he thought popping the question on the two-year anniversary of Harry ending up in Draco's examination room for the very first time had a nice kind of symmetry to it. Draco was the person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, and Harry wanted to make it official, to unequivocally claim Draco as his own in front of the word. It wouldn't be the most auspicious start to their life together if Harry were to propose right before leaving for a dangerous volunteer mission he might not come back from.
"No!" Harry immediately protested, horrified that Draco might think that Harry was anything other than blissfully, ecstatically happy with him. "No, that's not it at all. I can't remember the last time I was so happy. That's part of what gets to me. How can I be so happy here with you, living my life practically without a care in the world, as if I'm unaware of what's happening over there, that in Ireland people are being robbed of this same happiness?"
The note was short and to the point, setting Harry's pulse racing and sending pure, distilled want rushing through his veins.
each other on a deeply fundamental level that Harry hadn't experienced with anybody other than Ron and Hermione. And even then, there were things Draco knew about Harry that even his best mates weren't privy to. Harry had let Draco inside in a way he'd never done with anybody else before, and he trusted Draco with those most secret, shameful parts of himself, something Harry didn't do lightly. He liked Draco, he
a run towards the door. "Thanks for having me over. It was fun. I guess I'll see you at work Monday." Draco got up and Harry waved him off, his heart racing with something not unlike panic. "No, no, don't get up! I can see myself out. Totally—"
The entire world went still and quiet for what felt like a small eternity before exploding like a supernova as Harry came in his pants. Draco eyes went wide and he muttered, "
He settled at the table, nodding in acknowledgement when Parvati's eyes flicked meaningfully towards Fathi, clearly wondering if Harry was seeing what she was. Harry could barely contain himself, his entire body thrumming with the need to hear the news. But he made himself wait, knowing Fathi would prefer not to repeat himself.
That was a relief. He pushed himself up off of Draco almost reluctantly, feeling quite clingy. "What time is it, anyhow?"
Harry's eyebrows went up and he put away his quill and the partially written letter with a sweep of his wand. "Do you know what's going on?"
"Thank you for dinner," Draco said as he turned to face Harry, his eyes glowing beneath the yellow streetlights. "I had a good time." His brow furrowed and he met Harry's gaze, looking strangely vulnerable. "I don't know what it is about you, Harry Potter. My head tells me there's no way this will lead to anything but pain for the both of us, and yet…"
"Now," Harry said, stepping closer until their chests were flush, "I want to be with you. I want this to be real, to tell our friends, and file paperwork with the Ministry's Wix Resources. I want to keep going on date nights, and I want to keep exploring kink the way we have been, though I can't promise I won't freak out again."
Parvati chewed her lower lip and tugged at the end of her plait, her expression a mixture of worry and guilt. "I know you're a good Auror, Harry, I didn't mean to imply otherwise." She paused, clearly weighing her next words carefully. Already Harry felt a surge of anger at Parvati and the way she always seemed to be walking on eggshells around him like he was an exploding cauldron ready to go off at any moment. Did she really think so poorly of him? "Surely you can understand why Foley's different from the criminals we caught as Aurors back home. With your… history, it's only natural that it would feel more personal. Fathi's just being cautious. We need to know what Foley knows and what she has planned. We can't risk losing her."
Byrne had been feeding them information for the past few weeks, but thus far he'd not had much to offer. It was understandable that they might not trust their newest recruit with all their most sensitive information right off, but they didn't have time to wait around forever while Byrne proved his mettle. For Fathi to be calling an emergency meeting, it meant that Byrne must have finally brought something they could take action on.
burn up the lists. He could tell Draco he'd changed his mind, that he didn't want to pursue any of it, and Draco would let him, he wouldn't push. The whole thing would fade into memory, a mere blip on the radar, and Harry would never have to face it.
one. The coward Harry had known back at Hogwarts would have gladly grasped hold of a chance to bury his past wrongdoings and pretend everything was sunshine and daisies. But this Draco understood that there was no way forward in denial.
"I'm definitely… interested in experimenting with other things, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that just yet."
"Draco!" he finally managed to say around his dry throat. "What are you doing here? How did you find me?"
older than him, even if it was by less than two months. That was something, Harry supposed, even if it didn't quite settle the discord in his chest. He was still trying to come to terms with the fact that this was something he wanted. Harry had finally had a chance to do some research, to maybe realise that he wasn't the only one who wanted this, that he wasn't so alone. Instead, he'd discovered that even in this area he was a freak. He didn't look like a little should look, and he didn't want the right kind of caretaker. The whole thing had left him confused and conflicted, feeling drawn to the dynamic but certain he was wanting it in all the wrong ways.
to help, even when it drained him, even when it brought back memories best left in the past and triggered night terrors that kept them both up. Draco, who Harry hadn't seen in so damn long, who Harry missed more than anything, like a piece of himself had been lopped off, leaving him aching and bereft.
"That's one good thing at least. They're fairly certain they managed to capture all of the people who came to break Foley out. We'd assumed they'd split their force more evenly between the distraction and the rescue mission, but the bulk of her base came here to provide a bigger distraction—made it easier for Fathi and the others at the Manor to nab them, but we weren't prepared for the level of devastation here." She shuddered, grief deepening the lines in her face as she wiped a dirty palm across her damp cheek. "It would have been so much worse without our preparations, but…"
"You want us to attack before she leaves," Harry said, knowing his grin was a little too wide. The plan was risky, but these days Harry lived for a bit of danger to break up the monotony. "It's going to be a tight window between when she leaves the protection of the Foley Manor wards and when her Portkey activates. And she'll be on the lookout for trouble."
Harry leaned back against the bartop as he waited for his refill and looked out over the crowded pub. His mates occupied a large table in the corner and he couldn't help but smile as he watched Seamus gesticulate wildly, clearly in the middle of one of his epic tales. Their group of friends tried to get together every month or so to catch up on their lives now that they'd all gone in different directions, and the table was quite full tonight, with fewer people having to beg off than usual. Harry still saw Ron and Hermione several times a week, but with Rose still in nappies and baby number two on the way, the dynamic between them had changed. Most days Harry didn't mind, but it was hard not to feel a little left behind when confronted by the fact that he and his best mates were at such different places in their lives.
"What?" Ron answered, his tone alarmed as he strode into view. Ron and Malfoy had formed a surprisingly solid bond over the course of the case that Harry absolutely was
"If we want to prevent this same thing from happening over and over again, here or abroad," Draco continued, his face flushed with the force of his conviction, "Then we need to change people's minds, we need to change who's in charge, and we need to restructure." He turned to Harry, his eyes blazing. "There is no shortage of things you could be doing to help make things better, especially with your level of fame and influence. People love you, they
Harry frowned as he looked over at the clock. Bugger. They were due at Ron and Hermione's in five minutes.
"Merlin, I needed that," Draco said several moments later as he slid off Harry's dick with a wince and reached for his wand.
"Li's still out," Harry said. His Auror partner, Sue Li, had been one of the first to come down with the flu and she'd been laid up for nearly a week now, though she'd sent Harry an owl last night to say she was feeling much better and should be back to work soon. "Should I go alone or do you want me to take somebody else with me?"
"Good." Draco hesitated. "I'm not sure how much longer you were planning on staying, but if you wanted to extend your holiday and wouldn't mind some company, I happen to have the next week off myself. I'm no local, but I've spent a decent amount of time here. I thought it might be nice to show you some of my favourite spots."
It was almost like an out of body experience, some separate, cooly analytical part of his mind noting that Imogen had miscalculated how many baddies were still loose, because Harry had not counted on a seventh wizard popping into the fight. There was a shouted "
"Harry?" Parvati prompted when he didn't respond, her tone more concerned as she gave him a gentle nudge that pulled him from his musings.
Blaise's lips quirked into a charming grin. "Oh, I wouldn't dream of robbing him of the chance to tell you himself. Be prepared, though. This one involves an improperly filled ice cube tray, an unfortunate absence of loo roll, and several minor explosions."
Harry rummaged around in his jeans pockets until he found an old sweet wrapper, which he offered to Malfoy, mostly just to see the look of abject disgust on his face at being offered what was ostensibly rubbish.
Harry's eyes went wide. So many options! He'd not even thought about the fact that magical toys and games would be different from Muggle ones. Harry wanted to try them all, but he had no idea where to start. He gnawed on his lip and looked pleadingly at Draco.
Harry's cheeks warmed and he cleared his throat. "Right. Well. Shall we head out?" He looked down at the file Robards had given him, scanning it for an address. "St Mungo's already sent our victim back home with an order to take it easy for the next few days, so I figure we'll drop by her flat."
Harry hadn't ever had a proper parent, nor a traditional childhood. There'd been nobody to love him unconditionally, nobody to make him feel safe and cared for and adored. The only toys he'd had to play with were Dudley's broken hand-me-downs, useless and discarded, castoffs much like Harry himself had been. He usually did his best not to think about it; there was no use crying over the past, especially given all the true horrors he'd eventually had to live through. Yet the pain of it had lingered like a bruise, forgotten until pressed against, bringing forth a tender ache.
One down, then two, and Harry was working on the third while his allies duelled the others. Harry could vaguely hear the sound of sobbing and screams, and he wondered if the resistance had been escorting more civilians out when they'd been attacked, or if the anguished sounds were all in his head, echoes of past battles that wouldn't ever truly leave him. Either way, the sound only fuelled his inner fire, pushing him harder. Nothing existed beyond this moment, beyond the throbbing call for vengeance pulsing through him with each fevered beat of his heart.
This. This is what Harry had to remember when the itch to go out and blow shit up for the greater good got under his skin. The feeling of Draco in his arms, the taste of the lips, the way Draco made him feel strong and safe, protector and protected all at once. Draco was right; it was a miracle that they'd found each other, that they'd been able to work through all of their differences and grow into something so beautiful together. Harry didn't want to give it up, not for anything, and if that made them selfish, then at least they had one another for company.
than fine before they left for the pub when Harry had blown him in the shower. But as the evening wore on, and talk turned more and more towards what was happening in Ireland, Draco had grown more quiet. Then again, he was never particularly boisterous and he always appeared more shy than he truly was whenever he was around Harry's rowdy group of friends, preferring to observe the chaos rather than jump into the fray. Harry was grateful that most of his mates had made a genuine effort to get to know Draco and include him in conversation, but he understood why they weren't all quite as comfortable together as Harry wished they'd be.
"Hmm?" Harry blinked and tore his focus away from Draco's hands, realising they were already at the Apparition Platform in the Atrium. "Oh, right. Err… maybe we should Side-Along. Since we're going to the same place anyway," Harry added, not wanting to seem overly eager to get his hands on Draco despite that being very much the case.
Draco let out a pleased, fond laugh as he pressed up off of Harry and settled back on his haunches, his arse rubbing against Harry's cock. He muttered a Lubrication Charm, but instead of coating his own cock with the slick handful, he reached back and slathered the lube over Harry's. Harry's eyes widened as Draco's knuckles bumped against Harry's erection, as Draco then spread the slick along his own arsehole before grabbing hold of Harry's dick and holding it steady as he pushed up onto his knees.
Harry nodded. He wasn't entirely sure what a Story Spell was, but cuddling on the sofa with Draco sounded nice. Harry followed him into the living room, crawling onto the sofa and waiting while Draco disappeared for a moment before returning with a children's book.
With all of that baggage, did Harry really want to add another layer of complication into the mix? He wasn't even really sure what he was feeling and, given how off-kilter and confused he was just
But Draco, for all that he'd worked hard over the years to become a better person, was an imperfect guide, more inclined to see the world in shades of gray than Harry was. The Draco in his head had no problems with taking Foley out before she could hurt another soul, had no qualms with Harry playing jury, judge, and executioner. Harry might have had a problem with it, once, but things were different now, and the rage inside him was relentless and all-consuming, urging him to end this once and for all.
The look Harry had on his face must have reflected his doubt, because Draco huffed out a small, amused sound before continuing. "For example, you listed orgasm delay and denial as something you might be interested in, as well as spanking. In both of those instances I could push you far enough that you'd beg me to stop without actually meaning it. I don't plan to start out with anything quite like that for today, but while our scenes might not be physically strenuous, right now or possibly ever, we don't quite know how it'll affect you emotionally." He hesitated. "This kind of arrangement can be extremely taxing emotionally, and sometimes the smallest thing can end up pushing us past our limits in ways we never anticipated. If something gets to be too much for you to handle, I want you to use your safeword and put an immediate stop to it.
"Oh, Harry," Draco said, his voice softer and filled with regret. He stood up and reached out, tentatively at first, and then more boldly when it was clear Harry welcomed his advances. Draco pulled him off the armchair and into a hug, squeezing him tightly and pressing a kiss against the side of his head. "I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm not very good at talking about my feelings." He stepped away, sliding his hands down to Harry's and tangling their fingers together as he looked him in the eye. "You asked what I get out of caring for you while you're in littlespace? Well, you're not the only one who gets into another headspace when we're in a scene. My childhood… it was charmed in a lot of ways, and I know that my parents loved me, but they weren't what I'd call demonstrative or affectionate. Hugs and 'I love yous' were rare occurrences, and more often than not, I was in the care of our house-elves. That kind of distant, slightly cold affection is my default, but I know that isn't what you need when you're little. I was worried I wouldn't be able to give you the care you deserve, but instead you've brought out a side to me that I didn't know I had. It gives me an immense amount of pleasure and satisfaction to be able to care for you, to receive your open and unguarded trust and to shower you with the kind of praise and warmth and devotion that I sometimes wish I'd had as a child. This isn't a one-way thing, Harry. I might not be playing the same role as you, or getting the exact same things out of it, but you're not the only one benefitting. I've
Draco's fair cheeks grew pink and he paused to take a large bite of fish, seeming to ponder as he chewed. "Yes, the Daddy thing. Traditional BDSM relationships generally involve at least one Dominant and one submissive partner. What that looks like can vary, but I'd say that Graham is pretty clearly a Daddy Dom, and Emily is his little girl. Those kinds of relationships are usually less focused on things like impact or sensory play—those whips and blindfolds you mentioned—and more about care and nurturing. Though, of course, there's an element of punishment when necessary."
Harry's eyes grew wide. That… had not been what Harry was expecting. Or, well, maybe that wasn't entirely accurate, because something about the way Emily and her fiancé had interacted had struck a strange chord within Harry. It hadn't felt precisely sexual the way he thought kink was supposed to be, but Draco throwing out that term wasn't quite as shocking as he would've thought. Still, hearing Draco—the bloke he was kind-of-maybe dating—saying things like
Draco huffed out a laugh. "Yeah, all right. We can pretend we're emotionally mature adults and talk about our feelings."
"What would you like, sweetheart?" Draco asked, his voice still a bit drowsy. That must be why he called Harry sweetheart, which he never did when Harry was big. It made Harry's heart thump and his stomach wriggle. "Do you want my cock?"
hasn't written about it, of course—they've always been quite England-centric and never ones to stick their neck out, but I subscribe to a number of European wizarding newspapers, and it doesn't look good."
So he followed Draco down the hall and into the guest bedroom with a broad grin of delight, and Draco gave him a fond, indulgent smile as he gestured inside the room. On the bed was an outfit made up of primary colours of the kind Harry remembered Dudley wearing when they were both wee. The shorts were bright red, and the shirt was white with a print of brightly coloured trains. There were a pair of trainers to go with, pristine white with three velcro straps instead of laces in red, yellow, and blue. It was quite Muggle, and undeniably an outfit made for a little boy, though everything looked to be about Harry's size. Harry's throat grew tight and he looked helplessly at Draco.
"Story Spells are a kind of magic that's been woven into a particular story. The magical illustrator has created moving imagery that activates as the story is read aloud."
, Parvati, and I've questioned my share of witnesses. It's a little insulting that you all keep acting like I'm going to fly off the handle at any moment. What the hell are we here for if Fathi doesn't make use of us?"
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Is there a reason why I shouldn't? I mean, if there's nothing wrong with it, then…"
"So," Harry said, eager to change the subject. "Have you heard about what's been happening in Ireland?"
Harry's stupid cheeks grew warm of their own volition, and he forced himself not to wriggle in his seat. "Yeah, uh." He coughed, his cheeks growing brighter as he averted his gaze. "I liked it."
There'd been something in the little's posts that had resonated: a plucked chord deep inside his chest. It had sent him down a rabbit hole of related blogs and
Draco nodded. "That's absolutely normal. I've been involved in the community for years and I never would have got far if somebody hadn't taken me under their wing and showed me the ropes"—he smirked—"in my case, quite literally. I know it's overwhelming, so if you have any questions, please ask me. If I don't know the answer, I have other resources. I want to make sure this is good for you, Harry, whatever comes from it. Your comfort is paramount."
Harry's rhythm faltered at the sudden burst of pleasure, and Draco gave him a smug little grin, his fists twisting along Harry's shaft. Harry's size didn't seem to negatively affect Draco's technique as he wanked Harry off with expert precision; he would have brought Harry to his knees if he weren't already on them, sliding up and down Draco's dick.
Harry hummed, thinking it over. As much as he wanted to say he didn't care at all so they could just skip the conversation and get straight to the sex, Harry knew it was important.
? Because Harry was pretty sure that was a no for him, both giving and receiving. In fact, Harry Summoned a quill and marked down
"I hope you're right," Draco finally whispered against Harry's lips as he pulled away. And then he was gone, disappearing inside his flat without a backwards glance, leaving Harry dazed and dreamy on his doorstep.
"I'm still processing," he admitted, figuring if Draco was brave enough to tell Harry about his BDSM experience, Harry could be brave enough to share where his head was at, not that he had a clue where that was. "Honestly, I don't really know how I'm feeling about it, or what I may or may not want. But what if I promise not to make any executive decisions about our… relationship, without discussing things with you first? If we do continue to see one another, I'm sure I'll have a bunch of questions eventually."
"Me too," Harry replied, pulling Draco's arm more firmly across him as he thought once more of the ring in his desk, just waiting to be slid onto Draco's finger. "Me too."
It was ridiculous how much every single thing seemed to remind Harry of him, as if to constantly reinforce how much more fun this trip would be with Draco by his side. Certainly it highlighted what Harry had long been suspecting: he'd already fallen for Draco, hard enough that the thought of not being with him, of calling things off, had Harry's heart screaming out in protest. Harry was mad about him, but was that enough?
love you asking nicely," Draco said with a grin as he began undoing Harry's flies. He gave a nudge and Harry lifted his arse up off the cushion so Draco could pull down his pants and trousers, leaving Harry sitting bare-arsed on the sofa with Draco between his spread legs. Harry's cock was fully hard, bobbing towards Draco's face as precome began to bead along the head, and Draco extended his tongue, lapping it up and sending pleasure shooting up Harry's spine. Harry's hands twitched, overcome with the desire to touch, and Draco gave him a firm stare.
"Are you planning to let go of me anytime soon?" Draco's tone was more playful than accusatory, but Harry quickly released him, the red of the Auror's robes beneath his fingertips reminding him that they were on duty.
"Steady on, Malfoy, it's just a scratch," Harry replied, suppressing a wince as said scratch throbbed with a burning pain all down his side. It wasn't anything particularly nasty, just a Severing Charm he'd not managed to fully dodge before it sliced open his torso. He'd mostly staunched the blood flow with a hasty Healing spell, but he
, not exactly, even though just thinking the word sent a white-hot bolt of lust-tinged shame spearing through him.
With what was almost certainly less grace than Draco had displayed when getting on the bed, Harry crawled over to Draco and straddled him, unable to resist leaning down for a leisurely snog that quickly turned filthy as he groped inside his bedside table for his bottle of lube. Thankfully he didn't have to grope long. The nearly empty bottle was right near the front of the drawer, a result of the drastic increase in wanking he'd been experiencing due to working in such close proximity with Draco's smirky, sarcastic face. Smirky, sarcastic faces really did it for Harry, as did Draco bringing him cups of tea when they all worked late, and them sharing amused smiles when Ron went off on a tangent about the Cannons. Draco's…
"You look even better than I imagined," Draco continued while his hands slid up Harry's flexing thighs. His gaze fixated on Harry's cock, which was smacking against Draco's belly as Harry rode him, leaving a trail of sticky precome in its wake. It was ridiculously hot, and Draco seemed to agree, because he licked his lips as he reached out, grabbing hold of Harry with both hands.
Harry nodded, kissing his way up Draco's throat until he reached Draco's lips, sighing as their mouths met. He always seemed to have the horn after coming out of his littlespace, as if his adult side could think of no greater way to reassert itself than by getting off. Draco certainly never seemed to mind, always ready to give Harry whatever it was that he wanted.
, and they both were well aware that everybody and their mother would have opinions to share if their relationship were to develop and become public knowledge.
He and Draco had been in the middle of a… a scene, with Draco reading him the book while Harry watched the magical rendering with fascination. At some point Harry must have fallen asleep. He wondered how long he'd been out for, and if he'd broken some kind of etiquette. Surely it wasn't on to just pass out while one was in the middle of playing. His cheeks warm, Harry shifted and looked up at Draco, who was awake and looking down at him, his eyes crinkling slightly as he smiled.
," Draco said, brandishing the book. Harry could just make out an animated black and white Crup bounding across the cover before Draco tucked the book against his side.
"I thought using charms like that damaged the fabric," Harry said, mildly alarmed at the thought of harm coming to this outfit he'd already become ridiculously attached to.
"Half the night, eh?" Harry said, nudging her with an elbow and giving her the flicker of a teasing smile. "And what did you spend the other half of the night doing?"
"So what are we watching?" Harry asked as he piled his plate with noodles and curry and fresh spring rolls. When Draco had to move out of the Manor after the war, he couldn't find anybody in the wizarding districts that would rent or sell to him. It meant that, for the first time in his life, he was forced to live in an entirely Muggle dwelling. Harry knew it had been an adjustment for him to live in a building without any of its own magic, but it also meant there was no atmospheric magic to interfere with Muggle appliances, and Draco had quickly become obsessed with his television. Not having grown up watching it, his tastes were quite… eclectic, to say the least.
"All right then, that's settled." His expression took on a more predatory gleam, his eyes smouldering with sudden heat. "That frees us up for our final activity of the evening."
"Come on, Harry," Draco murmured, his voice low and strained as he clearly approached his own orgasm. "I want you to come for me, want to watch this big dick of yours come all over me."
Of course, missing them always led to him thinking about the other people he missed, which inevitably led to him thinking of
Harry huffed out a frustrated breath but nodded and released his hold on Draco's robes. Draco gave him one last measured look before heading up after Graham, leaving Harry to follow.
who I've found this happiness with… Now that I've got you, I don't want to give you up, not for a second, not if there's any other option. I know it's selfish, wanting to keep you for myself, but I can't help it. The thought of losing you makes me crazy."
Harry bristled. "We don't need both of us manning this entrance, and I'm one of the best offensive fighters we've got. Tell me it doesn't make sense for me to go in there. We both know there are innocents still inside, possibly being terrorised right this moment, and I can help stop it. I'm going in."
. Then he'd given Harry that small, fond smile he only ever bestowed upon Harry, the one that Harry knew meant
out there and he'd rather have a partner who preferred playing with pain as opposed to building blocks?
I thought you'd never ask! The key is both an un-activated Portkey that will take you to the edge of the property and a key to the wards and front door of the villa. The place is all yours until further notice—enjoy!
Harry's heart was in his throat and he swallowed around the lump. He didn't want to make Draco miserable, he never wanted that. He reached out and tugged Draco back into his arms. "I—You're not a bad person, Draco, you're just being honest. And it's not an outlandish request to make of your partner, it's just hard. At least you're able to utilise your expertise by helping dole out medical care, and you're actually able to see the results of your contributions. I'm not good at the administrative, behind-the-scenes stuff, and I hate the gladhanding. I know it's important, and intellectually I know that it
want a Master (or to be one, for that matter), but having somebody to take care of him, to cherish him… well, Harry could maybe see the appeal in that. He thought of Emily and how happy and carefree she looked, sitting cross-legged on the floor surrounded by pretty dolls, the way her face had lit up with uncomplicated joy when she showed off their outfits to her Daddy who praised them and her both. It made Harry's belly squirm and wriggle, hot with envy and want and shame.
have control of, but he hadn't expected it work quite so well, or for it be so hot when he felt Draco's cock begin to respond. For all that Harry had come a long way in accepting his desires, there was still a bit of a block in his mind when it came to using
He wasn't using his dommy voice, but it clearly wasn't a suggestion. As much as Harry had been putting off and dreading this very conversation, there was relief, too. Maybe now he could finally come to some kind of decision, get some type of closure, whatever that was. He followed Draco into the living room, curling up in the armchair while Draco took the chaise longue across from him.
The night was silent, eerily so. No owls hooted. No wind rustled the wild grass at the forest's edge. No crickets chirped in the distance. It was as if nature herself sensed the evil emanating from just beyond the Foley Manor wards and had decided to give it a wide berth.
As close as Harry was himself, the extra stimulation from Draco clenching around him was enough to put him over the edge. He came deep inside Draco's arse, burying his face in Draco's neck as he trembled through his climax. Draco held him through it, his own body clenching and releasing as he worked through the aftershocks.
Draco was still waiting for an answer, growing visibly more agitated by the second. "You don't have to, if you're not interested," he finally said, his voice strained. "I didn't mean—"
Harry nodded. "Yes, you're much smarter than that. So smart, in fact, that you'll see the wisdom in finally agreeing to go out with me. This Friday at eight?"
Harry's cheeks grew red-hot as his gaze flickered between Draco and the colouring book. He wasn't an idiot, and based on Draco's nerves and the keen way he was watching Harry's reactions, this was… maybe not a test, exactly, but certainly not as innocent as Draco was making it sound. Something had given Harry away, had made Draco think that what they'd witnessed between Emily and Graham was something Harry could be interested in. He hadn't realised his absorption and curiosity had been so obvious, though clearly it hadn't been so obvious as to make Draco certain Harry would react positively to a more frank discussion. In classic Slytherin fashion, Draco had opted for the more subtle approach, offering out the bait and leaving the Quaffle in Harry's hands.
It had taken all of his strength not to take a peek the moment Draco had left the night before, but he knew once he started he wouldn't be able to stop, and he really had needed to get some sleep. He had a feeling that
would be fine. He'd tease Harry for worrying and Harry would make him promise to be more careful, and they'd go out to dinner tomorrow like Harry planned. And when Harry asked him to marry him, Draco would say yes.
"When you say you want sex outside of our ageplay scenes, what kind of sex are you thinking about? Do you want to keep things totally vanilla? Are you interested in experimenting with other types of scenes and kink?"
. It was particularly timely for the resistance, as their only other undercover agent, Kelly, had been missing, presumed dead, for weeks; they'd just discovered his body a few days past. It made Byrne's position all the more precarious, as Foley would no doubt expect the resistance to try and plant another mole, but Byrne knew the risks; taking down Lady Foley and her followers was more important.
. His voice was softer, kinder, than Harry had ever heard it before and that, more than anything, drove home his next words. "There were no survivors."
Draco gave him a pleased look that made Harry's stomach flutter. "Such good instincts." He gestured to the sofa. "Why don't we sit and we can have a chat before jumping into things."
Draco's lips spread into a knowing grin, a little pleased, a little smug, and it made Harry's heart stutter. "I've always had quite the sweet tooth."
Remorse flickered across Draco's expression. "I'm sorry, Harry. I knew you were struggling with this at the start, but you'd taken so well to the ageplay I hadn't realised it was still weighing so heavily on you."
Harry had been trying to lighten the mood, but apparently he'd missed the mark, because Parvati's eyes filled with tears.
"I'm not stalking you!" Harry protested, perhaps a little too emphatically judging by Malfoy's dubiously raised eyebrows. "It's not my fault I've got a dangerous profession."
"Easy there," Draco murmured, running his hands through Harry's hair and tugging a little to get him to slow down. "There's no rush."
Draco let out a full-body shudder at Harry's words and then he was coming, spilling warmth across Harry's fingertips. The sight and feel and
"Right, shirt off, then," Malfoy said crisply, like asking Harry to strip off in his bedroom wasn't the kind of statement that could give a bloke
Draco nodded, relief flickering in his eyes. "Yes, of course. I'm happy to answer any questions you have."
Harry held onto Draco's hips for dear life as Draco started to ride him in earnest, fucking himself on Harry's cock with a fluidity and skill that told Harry this definitely wasn't the first time Draco had done this. Not that Harry had ever thought Draco was inexperienced, but for some foolish reason he'd not expected Draco to display such a clear and obvious enjoyment of a good dicking. But as Draco had said, there was no confusion as to who was in charge here. Harry lay all but helpless beneath Draco as Draco brought them both closer and closer to climax.
Harry buried a smile in his shoulder. Fuck but she reminded him of himself when he'd first realised he was attracted to Draco. Well he remembered that glorious stage of denial, and seeing her and Fathi dance around each other made him sweetly nostalgic. It also hurt, an ache deep in his chest that reminded him that his own prickly other half wasn't here. It was what made the waiting so unbearable, what made Fathi's refusal to involve Harry in the questioning such a bitter pill to swallow. Keeping busy was the only way to distract himself from the empty hole in his chest that had formed the moment he and Draco had been parted. He just wanted it all to be over.
Draco smouldered at him and Harry swallowed heavily as Draco clarified, "No sex while we're doing an ageplay scene. Outside of that, however…"
Not even with Voldemort had Harry felt this kind of bone-deep hatred, this desperate, clawing need to take his foe down by any means necessary. Perhaps because Harry was older now and had already lost so much. He'd lived through his war and made his sacrifices, only for a similar evil to crop up entirely too close to home. He wanted to make Foley pay for all the havok she'd wrought, for all the lives she'd destroyed. He wanted to make her
Harry grinned at him. "If it would make you feel better, you could always stay the night for observation. Keep a close eye on me and make sure I'm okay."
"As you wish," Draco murmured, ghosting a kiss against Harry's throat as he disengaged his hands from Harry's cock and climbed gracefully onto Harry's bed. He lounged back against the pillows, hands folded beneath his head, looking haughty and gorgeous, a prince waiting to be serviced. His cock was hard and leaking against his stomach, making Harry's mouth water and his arse ache as he tried to decide if he had the patience to give it a quick suck before moving on to the night's main event.
