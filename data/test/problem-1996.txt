- Don't worry, Rose Marie, they won't have you. - She rubbed against the Alpha's neck. An innocent gesture to perfume yourself
Zefrina looked at her husband who took the pen and signed without hesitation. She arose with the dignity learned in more than ten years of being the wife of a nobleman and signed the document in her native language, not in the elegant handwriting that she had had to adopt by her husband's family. The goblin who acted as a mediator validated the agreement after the signatures
The Potters possess many secrets and treasures as an ancient and noble family. But there is one in particular that they would die to protect. His most adored and sweet secret
She and Draco had lain on the ground so they could look at the stars, although Narcissa had gotten mad at them for doing something that could make them sick.
Draco could hear the conversation through the door as he watched the bruise change color on Rose Marie's cheek.
-Tom, call me Tom or I'll give you another spanking. You don't answer me truthfully so I'll be forced to do this until you do.
A cheerful red-haired woman who had come to visit Aunt Dora had said that Harry was the living portrait of her father minus the eyes that were her mother's. She also said that Magnolia was a replica of her mother except that she had the silver eyes of the Black.
That is why Magnolia was the heir to the title of Lady Black, waiting for a consort, instead of Harry who was the current Lord Potter. Because metamorphomagic was the most precious gift for the Blacks. Metamorphmagi would always take priority on the family tree. And no one had burned James or his wife, so the current Black heir was the girl.
Sirius felt his ejaculation and moaned loudly in Harriet's ear. That's it, it was over. There was no reason for her to be in his bed since he had given her potions to increase her fertility. This time it would be successful.
Only Dumbledore was known to turn his Patronus from a phoenix to an eagle. That is why he was recognized as the leader of light, because the Patronus was a spell that only a pure heart could cast.
At least they were better than all the Hogwarts looks on the two of them. Harriet's friends had stayed close, but not very close. And the Slytherins with whom Draco had made pacts were still on his side. But the rest of Hogwarts would glare at them every chance they got.
The goblin just raised his eyebrows and Hagrid was quick to explain to Rose Marie as they went to the wagons. What the Alphas were, what the Omegas were, roughly and without specifying much.
The man sat next to Harriet and she looked at him in amazement, it was rare to see the director outside his private rooms or at meals
Euphemia began to cry as Fleamont comforted her. Heather was an original. They were said to be the first magicians. Those who created the magical society and did great things
Walburga got up and called out to Kreacher, the elf his father had gifted him with when it was decided they would not live in the ancestral Black mansion.
A click echoed through her room as she quickly slipped into her everyday robes, preferring Muggle clothing. But that robe was the closest thing he had.
Regulus had always loved the Potter property, after all he lived in a windowless room on Grimmauld Place with Sirius. It was not that they could complain, but it was a damp and cold house, very dark and not only because of the lack of light
Andromeda felt her wand holster on her forearm and wanted to go after the Dursleys, but the look from the social services woman was one of sheer horror. So she let her record that
-You are telling me that you have run away from home to go to a cave full of corpses of reanimated Muggles to rescue a man caught in a potion that caused him to suffer hallucinations
Later that year, Magnolia learned that her fiancé had asked the French girl to be his date for the Yule dance. Parkinson had the pleasure of informing her of that fact to her face while laughing. Magnolia just gracefully turned and walked away
She could only look lovingly at the gentle man and watch his muscles move under his clothes. His marriage was uneventful, and Neville made money selling the potion ingredients he grew.
The woman had one last orgasm that she almost screamed as she clung to him tightly and fell limp into his arms. Severus kept moving until he had an orgasm and I enjoy the sensation of pure ecstasy for a few seconds on the woman's body.
Walburga looked at the newspaper announcing the birth of Lucius Malfoy, the proud son of Abraxas Malfoy.
Sirius ran a finger over the single lock of the girl's head, a shade of red like Lily's, and her hair changed to the same green color as Sirius's tunic. Sirius gasped loudly and pulled away. James seemed nervous
Morgana law was the right of a noble family woman to reject the fiancé chosen by her family for not finding him worthy of her. Killing him most of the time. The law was reinstated nearly twenty years ago when Bellatrix Black was insulted by her fiancé for being sterile.
Draco had been left alone on Madame Malkin, it wasn't like it was the first time his parents had done it, so he was fine. He argued with the dressmaker about fabrics, hems, and so on.
Dudley Dursley was taken into the care of her father's sister while her parents were taken to jail for child abuse and maltreatment. But the twins were not taken in by the woman, they looked for a blood relative until they found a certain Andromeda Tonks, née Black. Black was a very strange last name, that's why they contacted her
-If they keep looking at each other more intently I will start to think that my fiancé has feelings for my brother- Luna laughed to the side as she covered her mouth tightly to avoid attracting attention. On the other side, Ginny Weasley started coughing so badly that they hit her on the back several times to help her.
But the romance novels penetrated the magical world. And the wizards decided to imitate Muggles and created the only place where two wizards could elope to marry without the consent of their families.
-Our daughter is studying at a boarding school. It was the same one your parents went to and the one we will send you to when you are eleven years old- Ted looked at the children who turned like lightning to look at her
Draco rushed up and opened the door in time to see a flushed, fat man punch a figure five times his size in the face and slam it against the wall.
For Gryffindor, the test was finding and wielding Godric's legendary sword. The sword that only a true member of his household could find. Only 20 students had found it, despite the fact that it was known to be within the castle walls.
Harriet looked off into the distance, sitting on a bench after reading Draco's last letter before the words disappeared after the protection spell they had both tried upon seeing the Marauders map. Just showing up to them and the letter was bi-directional, joining two pieces of parchment.
-Yes, before mommy gave up on you, Grandpa used to bring me here because he said it was good that Heather knew children her age more sensible than James and that you
Normally she did her rounds with Ron and Hermione. But a bookcase had given way in the dungeons and many students had to go to try to fix their potion projects for Christmas. Fortunately, Harriet's had been spared, as well as those of ten other students.
-And the Black family will support them. And if we have to explain the situation to all the families with whom we are related to obtain their support, we will. - Orion took a step forward- The ministry cannot go against all 28 without risking that we overthrow it
* Hmmm…. I didn't force anything on you, dear. Except to get close to me * Tom kissed the back of Harriet's neck * Then…. Do you agree to be my partner? *
-Okay- The lord smiled- As if you were even capable of giving birth to some bastard with whom we wanted to relate
Rose Marie entered the store and a friendly woman greeted her. She was caring for a child and for some reason everything but the child disappeared from Rose Marie's sight. She recorded some noises as the boy approached her
Harriet stayed in the Gryffindor tower. It was a custom that if the mourning was for a woman the woman could not be present
Draco was an Alpha, and an Alpha's destined Omega was said to smell like the flower the Alpha hated the most. Because it wasn't the scent of his partner, just the scent of a plant. The Alphas hated him because he made them want someone who wasn't there
It was not recognized in the wizarding world, but most of them considered sex a waste of time and energy.
-The troll wars? You're ahead of the syllabus I had thought out for you, good boy. But don't try too hard- Walburga looked at the part that Tom struggled with- I'll look for a book where they explain this battle in more detail. Now go study the effects of the different wand movements when casting, then you have time to rest
- Twenty-five years ago two young people came to this school. She was Muggle-born and he was a half-breed from a pure blood family. They were childhood friends and had been important pillars in each other's lives from a very young age. The boy was in love with the girl and she only needed a little to fall in love with him
That night, for the first time in years, Magnolia fell asleep while holding Harry tightly. It wasn't Harry who approached Magnolia's bed.
- Is this the price of the supposed purity of blood? - She shouted it to nothing in the house full of blood and corpses.
- Are you sure this is not a twisted plan to show me what a good mother you can be and that I stay with you?
Lily looked at the girl, she shouldn't be able to get a good look at her. He hadn't turned in her direction and she was behind a tree.
-Our schools chose their champions and the others they brought in were weaker magicians who would make them stand out. Krum gets more fame in his career just by participating in the tournament and is Karkarof's pretty boy. For his part, the director Maxime is half giant and Miss Fleur is partly Veela. Director Maxime wants to support mongrels of magical creatures and wizards over Mudbloods or mongrels for Muggle marriages
A house elf walked past him as he scooped dew from the leaves, another ingredient for potions. Severus walked straight into the last greenhouse. There was a spell to increase the space and an artificial sun. As well as different areas imitating different climates.
All the Alphas that had been approaching moved away and began to whisper among themselves. Less Ron who only snorted with derision
Ron had been desperately searching for information on the 1345 magical treaty between fairies and goblins when he heard something strange. The magical creatures history section was almost deserted, but as he made his way through the shelves, he could hear the sounds of two people.
* Not many know, but women who speak Parseltongue are unable to resist the commands of a compatible man. As long as they are said in Parseltongue. It's like a feeling of pleasure that comes from obedience * Tom's arms spread * Come here *
James cursed and sat down on the grass next to Lily who was enjoying one of the desserts Heather had put on her plate. It was very good
-I did not think. I could only think of Regulus suffering in that horrible cave-Heather looked at her mother- Maybe it's time to accept Dumbledore's invitation and go to Hogwarts, I already hide very well with the wand. And we can say that I had a health problem and that is why I have not been able to attend until the last year
-I hope you're not talking about my girlfriend- If he bragged more about his new relationship and brought it out more often in each conversation, it would end up being a catchphrase of all his sentences. Smug bastard
They could only have one child. They both agreed with that, they both had careers they were passionate about and one child was enough.
However, strange as it seemed to everyone, what the master of the Slytherins wanted most was the girl who wielded the sword of Gryffindor
He tried to relax, as had happened in the greenhouse when Black threw him into the devil's lasso. However, the plant did not release him. It did not matter how long he waited, he did not let go even though he was left lax
-. He is going to try to get me to marry an Alpha from a light family. - Rose Marie had read of Dumbledore's opinion on destined couples in a newspaper. She was against and said that she took away free will from the Omegas
-No, Opal. I'm fine- House elves born into the Potter family were named after precious stones.- I barely remember the incident.
It all happened shortly before her fifteen-year-old's summer vacation. He and Draco had found themselves alone in one of the rooms to practice potions. Both had reserved it since there was space for two cauldrons
- Do you want to come to the dance with me? - She knew that the boy was engaged to a girl in his land, they had spoken before. She was quite clever and entertaining and Magnolia liked her ideas for making rune artifacts- As friends, it will be fun
-Do you remember when I was captured and you recovered me an hour later? The order captured seven Death Eaters, but one escaped
- So my father isn't James Potter? - Unlike Harry, Magnolia saw her biological parents as very distant and distant figures from her. She loved her adoptive parents very much.
-It is obvious that this is a case of gross negligence on the part of the magical guardian- The healer of Gringots and that of Saint Mungo looked at each other- Custody of Rose Marie Potter passes to the Alpha of hers, according to the old wizarding law. However, since the Alpha is a minor, custody will go to his parents.
Harriet crept into the bedroom. Detection spells were easily altered by her long ago. She looked at the bed and saw Professor Snape touching himself under the covers
Zefrina looked at herself in the mirror. She had missed the clothing of the Gypsies, compared to the ancient Greek-style robes the Melittas forced her to wear. Those things were awkward as hell and it took half a dozen spells to make them comfortable so they wouldn't slip through carelessness.
-According to my grandfather, he fell in love with a certain Alpha. But it turned out that the Alpha was the one for his Omega sister, who was almost a squib. Although those are just things my grandfather says and he is half senile. But we do know that they argued and a lost spell killed Dumbledore's sister.
After that Aunt Petunia stopped Rose Marie from taking care of the garden, but the smell of roses never disappeared from her body. She didn't care that her aunt forbade her to shower for days, her scent only got stronger.
-We're going to storm the ministry and bring her back. Raise the alarm, James. We won't be back until Heather is released
The lights began to dim and Zefrina saw Albus Dumbledore. She wore a Turkish anti-detection charm which was very illegal in England, although it only gave protection for four hours. She went to retire so as not to spy when she heard the old man's mind, heard about the blockages in the girl's body
Draco couldn't help but smile before hugging her and burying her face into the girl's neck. She moaned as a pin pierced her flesh and Draco turned away in embarrassment.
"I know, but…" Millicent thought of other children like her. Deformed children, children affected by madness, children erased, forgotten,… -At least make sure that the generations are separated between the marriages, okay? My grandparents were siblings, my parents were cousins, and my great-grandparents, and my great-great-grandparents. My fucking family tree is more than a tree is a rope.
Ted verified that the children had run to read Dora's letter to their bedroom before hugging his wife and kissing her passionately
Heather had once told Regulus that the walls were dripping with evil magic like mud. Heather had always been good at telling her which rooms or objects had a curse, something the mother had said they had to learn on their own.
*Thank you. Did she talk to a boy today? * Tom didn't feel any guilt about using snakes to watch over Harriet. After all, the girl avoided him as much as she could and he could only see her in classes and the great dining room
-I do this because I want to, Harriet. Also, it looked like you were going to invoke Morgana law and I don't want you to become a murderer
She was pretty too in a way that made her aunt cut her black hair hideously short and dress her in Dudley's ugliest clothes. Rose Marie learned because she did it one day when Uncle Vernon was away on business and Dudley was sleeping with a friend. It was the closest time she saw her aunt getting drunk.
-The pregnancy is going well- Her mother looked at her as she shook a branch of something burning. It was a curse detector that had been preserved since the age of the pharaohs - Gold is clean of harmful things, but it has a couple of trackers
After graduating Harriet entered auror school and continued to live with him instead of returning to the Potter mansion. It wasn't that Sirius was complaining about having the woman she was in love with close to her. Although he could take advantage of the situation a bit, as much as the house elves looked at him badly for noticing things that Harriet missed
However, once the genes were passed on, wizards had a hard time having a second and third child. He clearly remembered Lucius's complaints about trying to have a second child with Narcissa, even though he loved her.
Kreacher appeared before Heather. She knew the elf very well. Kreacher could be ... rude and rude, but what did they expect from someone who had been serving the darkest family in the wizarding world?
He ignored the woman who yelled at him when she moved, the pins digging into her skin and everything else. I ignore everything until I grab the girl's arm and she blushes. She was adorable
The girls knew they were not blood sisters. Their mother had always been sincere in calling them her "blood" and "magic" daughters. Even so, both sisters felt like twins
The bad thing was her husband's asshole. Their in-laws had moved them to Grimmauld place after thinking that the smallest space would unite them more. Her goddamn husband had rented a muggle flat and slept there before he came home.
-Those who control publishing houses and magazines are thoroughbreds. They will not go around announcing a fact that shakes the foundations of everything they proclaim.
Zefrina left her daughter and the Potter girl in the gypsy crib covered in colorful fabrics and charms. The poor Potter girl, Harriet, had so many blocks that it surprised her that she was still breathing. It must have been terribly powerful to be able to withstand all that.
They married for love, fleeing previous commitments, offended three families, the Blacks, the Potters and the family of Fleamont's fiancée. Fleamont's parents only spoke to him again when his cure for dragon pox made him famous
Severus Snape woke up before dawn and got dressed to go see the greenhouses. There were three. They had told him that he could collect ingredients as long as he did so responsibly
Millicent Bulstrode knew very well that she was not beautiful. It was the bad thing about Inbreeding among the Thoroughbreds. Some were born beautiful and affected by the event known as "red magic" and others were like her, with slightly deformed features due to generations of cousins marrying each other.
Rose Marie said nothing, she knew that the giant's words were nothing more than the messages of the mysterious director. Honestly, the man was beginning to seem like a complete manipulator, not an educator
Harry got up next to Magnolia and looked at her dark blue hair as she put on her new glasses, prettier and better graduated than the previous ones. The two five-year-olds got dressed quickly and quietly while the social services woman helped them.
- I'm sorry girl, but you will also find your home in…. Gryffindor! - the last word was shouted. Rose Marie froze as the assistant principal took off her hat and pushed her a little toward the loudest place.
They took the galleons necessary for her to buy her school supplies, the most appropriate ones, and left the bank after emptying a vault.
-Yes, with my cousin Orion to renew the blood of the family. He is not very funny and it has not occurred to him to think that I do not
-Good brain, bravery, cunning and loyalty. Without a doubt you are worthy of all the houses just for your comment. But you love your freedom and the Slytherins would steal that from you. You love learning, but you won't dedicate your life to it. Only Gryffindor and Hufflepuff remain. Still, badgers are too quiet for you, you need someone as wild as you to be at ease. You will find a place to thrive- the voice left her ear and shouted to the rest of the room- GRYFFINDOR!
-I left home without permission. My parents haven't punished me, but James wants to chain me to my room. When you have children you will be lucky if he lets you get out of bed
But there were lines that Sirius didn't cross. Although on one occasion Remus saw how he looked at Harriet who was holding Teddy in his arms, a look of longing. I wanted to see more of that scene, but with a different child
The social services woman picked up the claims the children's aunt had told them about their parents and the truths, for Muggles, of the Tonks.
In the magical world, the seal of the family was necessary to marry. When a Muggle-born man or woman entered the wizarding world they were given a seal with their magic engraved on it. It was illegal to get married and for the marriage certificate to not have at least one of those stamps
-Slytherin ... There you would have the opportunity to grow and develop your talents, you would reach fame in a way that you have not even dreamed of. You have ambition and cunning. It's all in your head. However, there is another house you could fit into. And if I don't put you in it, Albus has threatened to transfigure me into a shoe for a whole year.
-It's strange, he and your brothers get along. I could ask them to speak well of you to him- Irma sighed- I will go and calm Arcturus and your father about your toy. But remember that we still hope to see a child of your blood and that of Orion
The woman widened her eyes upon seeing the beautiful little boy entering the room. There was a snake around Tom's neck
The boy climbed the stairs slowly as he tried to listen to them. Of course, while they were within earshot of the boy, her mother said nothing bad. I only praise him slightly
Leanne had dedicated herself to gutting them and was there, reading quietly in her rusty orange silk robe in front of the fire. She hadn't even changed her clothes, she had only washed her hands
-I will call upon the children of the wind and we will remove your curses, Lelwani. And then we will travel the world, learning new magic at each stop. Isn't it wonderful? - two toothless smiles greeted her from inside the crib
-Objects move around him, snakes follow him and one of the men who tried to adopt him in the past died of a heart attack as soon as he touched him. Next week we will try to exorcise him, if you want to adopt him you should wait a month. After that we will take them to the coast
Magnolia ran her hands through the hair and it curled until it was similar to Harry's, although the color was its natural red. Thanks to the advice of her cousin, she now had the natural color of her hair, not like before that she always darkened it to black because it was more comfortable. However, her natural hair was not as curly as Harry's, it was more similar to her mother's, only smoother.
The girl was beautiful, that is to say, very pretty. Being objective and non-homosexual, all the men in the world could tell that James Potter was very attractive. And that girl was his female counterpart, equally attractive and beautiful. A beauty only broken by a slight scar on her forehead
Walburga's madness became more and more justified for Harry. Seduced and betrayed, the promised couple turned out to hate her and despise her contact, alone in the old and horrible house,… Well, it was fortunate that it was not Walburga.
Millicent knew that she, too, had improved with age. No one who spent years with someone as vain as Pansy did not learn a few tricks. Restraining herself from eating, exercising to soften her bulging muscles a bit, grooming herself, make-up spells, ... She wouldn't be beautiful but at least no one could call her ugly anymore
The elf disappeared with a click and the door swung open. Harriet was beautiful. Her long black hair was combed into thick curls, her emerald green eyes were sparkling like a spell, and she was flushed.
Rose Marie climbed onto the stool carefully. This whole selection was somewhat humiliating in her opinion, especially with so many people watching her. The sight of her was covered by the worn hat in a few seconds
- Uncle Vernon used to say we're weird and beat Magnolia every time her hair changed color. Are we magicians?
-Yes, he's a half-breed of the Gaunt family. Her mother eloped with a Muggle instead of following the family tradition of mating between blood brothers- She looked up- She was in a Muggle orphanage and they were going to do an exorcism. I couldn't leave it there.
*Silly woman. I don't want you to be strong forever. I am a snake, I am cunning by nature. I have long known that most of your daily behavior is a facade. I also know the situation of your family * Tom spread soft kisses on Harriet's face * But you must understand that you are not your family and your life should not be dedicated to restoring her honor. Your life must be dedicated to me and loving me *
Harriet held Draco's hand as they ran to the hidden portkey in the Screaming House. No one was chasing them, but it was best to disappear quickly.
-You are a Gryffindor, without a doubt. Throwing you into danger without any plan- Heather blushed as the elf pulled an Inferi's finger out of her hair- However, if it weren't for how fast you were Regulus would be dead. That's why I'm not going to punish or reward you
-If this is the protection for only one of those things, I don't even want to imagine what it will have done for the others.
James glared at the people coming to his house. Potter Manor would take in that summer these four people who had helped along with him to the defeat of the dark lord.
When they finished they parted without saying anything. But they had fallen again, over and over again over the next two years and at parties to which both families had been invited.
And worst of all, he knew it was true. Sirius had sold him for freedom and without looking back. But, as Heather had once told him, maybe Sirius didn't care about him since he never complained to Sirius.
To get married they had to sign a contract with James's mother with several very important points regarding their offspring
-Fine thanks. They would be better off if that woman decided to stop wearing her title as Lady Black and started being a mother. But she says she doesn't want to go near stinky babies
-Do what you like, Orion. Live your life away from me and just come to this house to make an heir and a second on the line, because that's all you will get from me. Because love and respect must be earned. And you insult me  at every opportunity that comes your way, you don't deserve either of the two things. Go home Orion, nobody wants you here
It was almost painful to get it wrong in practical classes. But for Harriet to worry about him afterward and accompany him to the infirmary reinforced his resolve to get better. Until the day he managed to reach the level necessary to win Ron
She didn't know how Draco had managed to get a portkey, she wasn't expecting his marriage proposal either. But there she was, running to the most haunted house in Britain to grab a portkey.
Few knew of the girl, since thoroughbred custom indicated that girls would be announced on their sixth birthday in patriarchal families. Only a few Blacks knew of the girl's existence, the most powerful only. And that helped protect her
Magnolia Black woke up as usual when she heard footsteps heading for her room. She quickly grabbed one of her long strands of hair and realized that it was a beautiful turquoise shade similar to the sea in the photo on the bedroom wall.
On the other hand, Harriet's parents had been strangely quiet after her letter. She told him it was because they preferred to reflect rather than act impulsively.
And he was the last living Black male. Those laws were ingrained in Black magic, and Harriet was covered in that magic. Sirius could take it
Severus finished with a groan before returning to her bedroom and closing the door behind her. Still, she wondered how long it would take for the dreams of completely devastating Harriet to disappear.
- I love peach candies. - Lily looked in the basket and found another plate ready to be used. He smiled and handed it to James who immediately poured himself a couple of sweets.
"... And the Inferi kept ignoring me and pulling Regulus down." So I launched a destructive magic wave while sharing my air bubble with Regulus and managed to push them far enough away that Kreacher could appear back to us here.
-The young man tried to apologize, but she was still upset at that moment and rejected him. Some time later she married a member of her house who was very much in love with her and he was left alone forever.- The director adjusted his glasses and took out some mint and lemon chocolates.
She wanted her children to grow up in a peaceful world without war. Wizards should adapt to Muggle inventions and not just their clothing. Frankly, many Muggle inventions were very useful and practical.
The children were brought home and settled in a room that they swore was bigger on the inside than it appeared on the outside. Dinner was delicious and they were delighted to be seated with people who really wanted to hear them and acknowledge their presence
The winner of the duel could demand what the winner wanted from the loser. Anything. Ron had taken advantage of this to get money a couple of times and other things
-Sounds like an excuse why we had been hiding you from Voldemort's eyes- the woman made a serious face- After what she did to Bellatrix while cursing her with an Imperius is enough to justify it
-I am going to London, or to a small town in its surroundings, I will rent a house until I give birth. When I recover I will go to Asia or South America for a while. - Her mother nodded while looking at her
Harriet had been in love with Sirius for as long as she could remember, but whatever she did, he still treated her like she was his daughter. And I wouldn't take Tonks advice to use aphrodisiacs against the man
*And her? Does she want to mate with someone? * Tom didn't want to feel that way, but the idea of someone else touching Harriet ... Of Harriet craving someone else's touch ... He wanted to send poisonous snakes at them
-No. I am the head of a family part of the sacred 28 and I refuse to let them take my only daughter- Fleamont se picture
Harriet was making her rounds of the school. Although she was not a prefect like Hermione or Tom. But wielding Godric's sword made her have to deal with conflicts between houses and for honor.
The truth is that there were several red flags. Like only Magnolia and Harry taking care of the garden and other heavy tasks while Dudley just seemed to play. The low weight of the twins colliding with the alarming overweight of their cousin. The twins only wore inherited torn clothes and Dudley had something new almost every month. Magnolia bruises. The glasses Harry wore, cheap from the drugstore and the wrong prescription. That they seemed to have forgotten to school them while they applied to the best schools in the area for their son.
-Thank you, we'll go to Gringots to see the details at a later date- James dismissed the goblin with some galleons to make sure he didn't talk about the past that day
-Canuto ... I think you should tell him and together decide what to do. Living with her soon won't be enough for you and you will want more. You could attack her
The eldest former minister congratulated her for taking the ancient custom of taking talented young people and raising them in powerful families. As it had happened to her. Especially when Walburga's mother leaked that Tom was the last living descendant of Salazar Slytherin.
Magnolia blinked softly out of sleep before looking at her. The girl looked at her and then noticed her white hair. She backed against the bed as she begged for mercy. Harry woke up and looked at Andromeda before seeing Magnolia and rushed to cover her while hugging her tightly
-Remember how it was and in which house they classified me. If I hadn't become Pansy's shadow I would have been the target of my home harassment in less than a week. Pansy knew she looked prettier next to me and I knew that if she found me useful she would serve as a shield.
It didn't help that the girl with the short hair and boy's clothes was now an attractive witch, legally adult and always clinging to her side. Brushing her breasts against him inadvertently as if she was still seven years old and that area was flat.
Lel and Ari were running through the streets while a wizard yelled rude words behind them. The twin girls turned to stick their tongues out at him and keep running. The flowing tunics they wore with coin-shaped beads, the white blouse that seemed to float in the wind, and the thick braids mixed with kerchiefs marked them as gypsies.
In the end, the incident was not investigated, only the bodies were taken and buried in the cemetery. Millicent played her role as a slow Slytherin girl very well and the Death Eaters bought her in a second.
The black dress, the black veil, Black Mannor,… And the groom who looked like he was dying was a nice touch next to her.
The great hall was magical. The floating sails and the roof that revealed the night sky. Rose Marie had seen both at Malfoy Manor, but not together. The stellar observatory with the transparent roof was certainly beautiful.
Upon reaching Gringots the goblin looked her up and down and the eaves of her nose opened about four inches
Fleamont Potter decided that this moment was as good as any to show them around the house. Severus and Lily were excited to find another potionist to talk to, and yet another as famous as Fleamont.
There wasn't much to do given the limited margin the uniform gave, but it was the difference between looking good and looking like a noble. As the heir to the lord that he was he had to look flawless
But after suddenly growing up, for unknown reasons, the girls arrived. To Harriet, he was still the same Ron she had seen being scolded by his mother for sticking his finger up his nose. But for the rest of the women in Hogwarts he was the "so handsome, so tall, so strong"
Tom was stroking Harriet's back with an absentminded gesture as she read the pages of Salazar's diary with a strong blush on her face.
-Sorry, the magic you emit is very comfortable. I couldn't help but dive into it and know what you were thinking about my green eyes.
The snakes said that she had a special map that she used to avoid him. When she was his, the first thing Tom would do was burn that damn piece of paper. Even with all the snakes in the paintings and the ones that crawled along the castle walls he could hardly meet her
Rose Marie looked at the boy. She didn't like him instantly, she clung to Draco tighter. That boy was one of the ones Hagrid had mentioned
It was strange, he had no recollection of Walburga and Orion meeting or talking. Walburga was homeschooled when her engagement was decided, so she didn't go to Hogwarts like her younger brothers and her husband
-If she hadn't been so stubborn they could have been together- Harriet looked away- The same as if he had been less proud and hadn't insulted her where it hurt the most.
- James, you've come. - The voice was lively and sing-song. James knelt before the young woman in the room and began to kiss his hands.
-We understand that while she was away from the magical world she did not have her key, but that he did not give it to her when she arrived is unacceptable. We will issue a new key for her- the goblin went to the fireplace-Congratulations on this successful meeting, may your cribs be filled with powerful heirs
The boy's mother always laughed saying that she hoped Draco would find her partner soon so that she could refill the vases around the house with the beautiful roses they grew. But Draco knew that the search could take years.
-Well, I'm always serious- elbow in the ribs for the bad joke- But yes, I'm serious. I intend to stay away from her
And she was bored, a lot. Like really boring. There wasn't much she could do, and there wasn't some crazy homicidal maniac going for her life to distract her. In these years it was frowned upon for a married witch, a lady, to go for walks without her husband.
A rush of raw pleasure ran up Harriet's spine and she gasped before looking at Tom. He was looking at her with a beautiful smile on his lips, a satisfied smile that looked quite dark.
Regulus remembered when everything was easier. Before Sirius had let his mother down as heir and he had to take his brother's place. Although his mother refused to let Sirius leave the property or their sight, Regulus had more freedom until his brother was selected into Gryffindor.
Shortly after being fired Lelwani felt her arm grasped by Lord Black and her companion. She smiled at them as Arinna stood next to her.
She walked over to a wall and touched a random brick, driving it into the wall. Some stairs came down and the sunlight came through the water.
-He is not dead. He has four more of those things. As long as they continue to exist, he cannot cross the threshold of death. May resurrect - Regulus couldn't make long sentences yet. And when he finished he coughed and saw blood on the hand that had covered his mouth
-Draco, this is Magnolia Black. She is your fiancee. Magnolia, this is Draco Malfoy, your future husband
Fleamont returned with a series of potions and began to diagnose Regulus while Kreacher cried and broke several fingers.
There was a half-blood child who dreamed of dominating the magical world years ago, however, that child cast a deadly curse while still a student and was locked up in Azkaban.
She was a French girl her age and Draco spoke French very well, as well as being charming when he wanted. Normally used to seeing Draco with other women, Parkinson had done a lot to Magnolia's patience. But seeing her fiancé lean in and steal a kiss from the girl was a bit too much.
- Haven't you learned manners, Weasley? Treating an Omega that way is very rude, if we add the fact that she is an heir to a noble house we can consider it illegal.
Which had meant having to chase Cornish pixies for almost three months who stole girls' underwear from their trunks or crawled under their skirts and cut them up to steal them. Damn Lockhart
It was true that Neville was magically one of the most powerful students in Hogwarts, but his performance in Defense of him was among the lowest. The boy was just too sweet and kind
The girl stirred and leaned over to where Draco was to snuggle against the Alpha's warm body. The boy could only hold her while she thought about the blow that he had seen that she received from her. Hit for refusing to give up magic
Narcissa and Lucius had been advised of Magnolia's change of guardianship. It was fortunate that they never bothered to learn the address of Andromeda and her husband. For a few seconds Magnolia wondered what her sister would think of her son's fiancée.
Fleamont watched Regulus until he fell asleep and then left Sirius with him. The boy had assumed his animagus form and was lying at the foot of his brother's bed. At least first he had let it be cleaned and thoroughly brushed by the elves
-Yes, in my defense ...- Euphemia's hand went up as she looked at Heather's robe torn in various parts
Draco was describing Rose Marie to her parents with an enthusiasm never seen before. Anyone would say the boy had spent weeks with her instead of just a few minutes.
-She will be… Talking to the house elves. She will be asking you to take good care of you- James smiled calmly before following the others
She returned to the Ravenclaw bedroom and stroked the beautiful green dress that Draco's mother had sent her for the dance. She grunted and straightened determined. She went to the library and found a boy from Drumstrag.
- Oh, any of those trains will be fine, Harry. Each and every one of them will help you end the war. Although in different ways - Dumbledore laughed - Choose wisely, Harry, boy. It was an honor to watch you grow
- She is very polite - Irma let out a strangled sound- This is my mother, Irma Black. Mother, this is my ward, Tom Riddle.
-Harriet… You are very beautiful this morning. Your eyes shine like emeralds, the color of Slytherin- Harriet took a step back. She had always hated (loved) how he always called her by name and flattered her. It made her feel feminine and small, until the weight of the sword at her waist reminded her that she was not feminine.
-Do you prefer the comfortable happiness to which you are accustomed or take a risk and get something much better? In life, there are times when you must take a risk or you will lose something very valuable. If Severus had apologized several times Lily would have accepted it in the end.
The son or daughter in question should be engaged before their fifth year of life by a magical contract
A tome fell to the ground and Tom approached in time to see a small purple snake in the place where the book had been.
A soft gasp and suppressed moans, the rustle of clothes and sounds of wet kisses. Also the rubbing of sweaty skin
That day the Potter family closed their doors and stopped appearing together in public places. Their house was full of protections and you could only go to see them by making an appointment in advance
- It wasn't the first time that Regulus and I… Well, it happened when we were at Hogwarts. - Lily grabbed Remus's hand. - The prophecy talks about Harry or Neville, he can come for both children. But Magnolia was born on the first of August. The prophecy does not speak of her. Remus, please, if something happens to me take care of Magnolia and Harry, tell them the truth. Regulus was my first love and what he did was to keep his cover. I could never hate him! But I see that James treats Magnolia differently than Harry and that hurts me.
It was as if everything up to that point had been black or white and now he saw color for the first time. His nostrils flared and the scent of roses filled his nose. A delicious and magnificent aroma
That desire for the girl in his arms. The daughter of her best friends and the one she had raised since they died
-Your magic is more anchored to nature than the rest, Neville. It's normal for plants to love you- Harriet smiled at him as she admired the beautiful leaves of Neville's mandrake.
-Yes, we adults have to destroy these things. The children have already defeated him, destroying these fragments is the responsibility of the adults with a wand.
-Angelina is lucky- Lee huffed- My Alphas are twins and her mother is the number one admirer and follower of Dumbledore, Fred and George Weasley. They do not blindly follow everything the director says, but it is difficult for them to accept me. I would like to be with them already
Three hours later they returned to the house and she sent Tom to sleep before ordering a drink from Kreacher. Not only Walburga's failed love but Orion Black had been glaring at her as well. Especially when all the magical Londoners found out that their "toy" was a "protege"
So Neville, the summer before his fourth year, went to his father. To know how to fight a duel. His father knew right away why he did it and Lord Potter and Lord Black joined in the lessons.
It turned out that the woman was a second cousin of the father of the twins and was willing to take them in. They checked their family income history and prepared to hand over the twins after taking all of their statements of things that they viewed as normal but were not.
From that day on, James changed. He became more protective of her. She could hardly see the playful and joking boy because he cared too much. But when she went with the Blacks she came back being that happy boy from before. So Heather always adored Sirius, although she was sure the boy did not remember her.
Harriet would go to mediwizard school to follow in her mother's footsteps and marry someone her parents recommended. Her parents seemed very eager and tried to get her to get close to the Weasleys (Any of the Seven), Neville, Dean or Lee. All the men who thought for her were Gryffindors with very Gryffindor behaviors
Severus grunted loudly and got up before going to clean up in the bathroom. The room was already paid for and she didn't have to worry about getting the women pregnant since she had used a male contraceptive, a potion to make her seed sterile.
-That's good, Regulus is very shy- the man looked at the little boy- Walpurga has said that if he doesn't do some magic before his fifth birthday she will start using methods to get it out of him by force
-Okay, Rose Marie. Answering your question, bravery is not a very predominant trait in the Omegas. Gryffindor is historically the house with the fewest Omegas. Followed by Slytherin. Most Omegas end up in Hufflepuff. Although in total we are only 48 Omegas in a school of seven hundred students- Angelina sighed as she began to comb her hair and pick it up to sleep
-There are times when life gives you explosive oranges and you still make cakes with them- Luna's voice was soft and comforting. Magnolia smiled at the girl with more spirits
For a moment she wondered if Professor Snape knew that he had sex while sleepwalking, but she didn't care. A moan tore her throat after being penetrated.
Maybe that's why the news spread like flames in a dry wheat field in the seventh and last year of classes for both protagonists.
A considerably tired brown owl came to the store and alighted outside with the mail. Zefrina took out her wand and looked at the letter
-I already live the life of a widowed mother. What more harm can my husband do to me? Besides, I think it is time for you to meet the man I have brought to this house. Kreacher, bring Tom
- Delicious of food or delicious of very attractive? - - Sirius often envied werewolves' ability to smell true beauty. Although they could also smell bad personalities, like once his mother went to Hogwarts and Remus told him "It smells great, but it's like it's rotten inside"
Since that day the two girls had been away from him. And he didn't even notice it. Each new girlfriend was one more offense and everyone in the wizarding world marked her as cuckold after the gossipy reporter of the Prophet, Rita something, brought it to light in an article
- Bulstrode. - Granger's quiet voice received it. The beautiful girl in front of her looked little like the second-year-old girl she had a fist fight with at a wand dueling club.
Rose Marie was with Angelina and Lee on the patio, the three of them together having an Omega bonding moment. Or rather, explaining to Rose Marie how to survive being an Omega at Hogwarts
-The director is an odorless Omega- Angelina touched her nose- Well, they call them Omega. But they really are neither of the three genres. It is something rare that can happen with mestizos.
Magnolia couldn't look away, she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. Her silver lashes were long and cast a shadow on her childish cheeks. Her lips were thin and she had a proud aristocratic nose. Her hair was quite short and she seemed to have trouble pinning it behind her ears.
Sirius hugged him. That hadn't happened in a long time. When they were little, and their mother used a riding crop to correct their manners, they hugged each other in his room. But eventually those blows stopped coming, and Sirius said hugging was for little girls.
Tom Riddle didn't seem very special, at first. A very pretty boy from a muggle orphanage who had been unlucky enough to end up in Slytherin. The day after the selection ceremony he appeared before his house leader as a parsel speaker, proving that his mother came from the Salazar Slytherin lineage. In his left hand he wore Salazar's ring, as a proud prince of Slytherin
Millicent was as silent as she could as she drew her wand and hurled the deadly curse at the ten-year-old's back. Then she went to the bathroom to vomit and when she turned on the tap she understood why everyone was asleep. Potion of the Living Dead
-Your brother has defeated the dark lord. The best curse-breakers in the world would be willing to dissolve our marriage contract. After all I have the mark on my arm and you will be the most coveted bride in magical society, there are no benefits in our marriage.
Harriet's hands had traced her back so many times that the man was surprised they hadn't already memorized it. Before he could withdraw any more, Harriet squeezed her butt with her hands and hit her.
-Tia Petunia said that Mom was a whore who was looking for men non-stop and Dad was an unemployed drunk who caused the car accident in which they died. They didn't tell us anything else- Magnolia said it with a clear and loud voice, as if she were talking about the weather
-I will not get angry because you listen without permission. You can go out- Tom got up and came into view- Really mothers are something ... Difficult
He had asked the elves of his old house to drop a couple of drops of veritaserum into the cup of the young woman's mother who would take her place. After her fifth drop the woman began to brag about how she had slipped abortifacient potions to end Zefrina's pregnancies.
Furthermore, she had only had contact with other women in her family besides her brothers and her lord father.
-A greater good? - Arcturus got up together with Orion, who was only following his father, letting him lead for that time- Are you telling me that stealing a girl who carries the blood of two ancient and noble houses of pure blood is for a greater good? What dissecting it and using it as a lab rat is fine?
- I hope that good old Cissy leaves me alone while we raise her. I see her sending me daily letters to force me to remember all my education that I threw away for marrying you
Severus followed the girl's back closely. Even when the tunnel moved she just kept smiling, like she knew exactly where to go. Even though her tracking spells were failing she moved as if following one. But it was impossible
She told him that she was doing it so Rose Marie wouldn't take Vernon's attention away from her like her mother had done to all of her previous boyfriends. After that, Rose Marie went to the library and looked for a book about the dangers of an older man taking an interest in a girl. The librarian gave her a tome and asked her if something was wrong, Rose Marie simply told her that her aunt had warned her to be careful with men who pay attention to girls. What she read was kinda gross
Before James ran to one of the magic tools at the entrance, a creak resounded and a large amount of water spilled into the room. A girl with soaked black hair coughed a few times while holding her hands together with a young man who looked bad.
Questions filled Magnolia's mind. For a few seconds she doubted a lot but then she calmed down. She didn't need to know how she was conceived, she didn't need to know many things. But there was something that was burning her inside
- Yes, Aunt Andy - the twins answered at the same time and Andromeda thought they were cute. If the situation had been different years ago she would have tried to have other children with Ted
-You can call me Aunt Andy and my husband Uncle Ted- Andromeda Tonks was a normal woman with brown hair and brown eyes, she seemed warm and friendly. Her husband seemed equally kind
-Children, your father and mother were independent researchers at a university- the muggle cover of the members of the order- And they died in an explosion when you were one year old.
Severus Snape hates many things about himself, but there is one thing he hates in particular because it keeps him from being a wizard like everyone else. But there is a person who does not care about that at all, indeed, she enjoys it immensely
- We told the lady who was receiving her courtship gift that she had a lust charm on the gem. - Ari nodded
The last two princes were so rare that they had never coincided in the thousand-year history of Hogwarts. What's more, being elected gave you great benefits in the political world. All the princes had ended up as ministers of magic, directors of Hogwarts or being the heads of the Wizenmagot
Lily blushed deeply. That silly, romantic, noisy boyfriend of hers was incorrigible. She still loved him, even if it took her life to admit it. Heather gave Lily a plate and put a couple of sweets on her. At that moment Lily noticed the picnic basket beside her.
-Difficult, very difficult- a voice whispered in her ear with sweetness.- Loyal to those you find worthy of your loyalty, intelligent and eager to learn. But neither Hufflepuff nor Ravenclaw are for you.
-Maybe a regulated instruction will help me. But I am sorry to leave mother alone with her little brother
He remembered holding her the day he arrived at Grimmauld Place after his fifth year and realizing that she was almost as tall as James, that she was a head shorter than Sirius. As well as her breasts pressing against his body.
Fleamont and Euphemia looked at the remains of Inferis that the elves had recovered from the boys' clothes and hair.
- Do you want us to do the polite farce or do I speak directly about what I want to ask you? - - Millicent had some pleasure to see Granger's eyebrows rise.
On a warm summer night the birth occurred. Euphemia Potter gave birth to James Fleamont Potter and that birth was announced to the entire wizarding world. But also that night was born as James' twin a girl, Heather Lyra Potter.
Later that night, Draco was lying on the guest bed next to the girl. Between Narcissa and Severus they had cured her, but that did not explain why the supposed heroine of the wizarding world suffered from prolonged malnutrition and she had so many broken bones and bad soldiers.
He began to take pleasure as the memory of Harriet filled his mind. The breasts barely contained by the cups of the bra, the perky rear, her blush,… Severus imagined how beautiful she would be lying on his desk while he took advantage of every nook and cranny of her body.
Of course they enjoyed gold, you couldn't travel without gold. They went to countries, learned spells and rituals, techniques, created amulets that they sold,… Most gypsy families had much more gold than all those lords and ladys. But it was not known why they preferred a nomadic and untethered lifestyle, nothing to show and show off
Harriet's parents had been furious, Ron's parents had been furious, Ron's brothers had been furious, Harriet had been furious, and Ron hadn't cared.
How many of the people she listened to would end up living unhappy by rejecting a gift from the magic mother? For rejecting fate?
On the train most people turned away from the possessive scent of the newly mated Alpha and his Omega. Even the people Rose Marie knew knew Draco from before. The boy led them to a separate compartment and there they sat quietly
-Is there no more Omega in the house? We were one of the fullest tables- Rose Marie was surprised- And call me Rose Marie, in my school there were eight other girls named Rose in my class and I used to being called that
-Hogwarts plants are used to a lot of people. Mel, on the other hand, is only used to catching intruders on the Potter estate. And, in addition, it is a hybrid created to identify the magic of the person it captures and to know if it is from the family
Rose Marie looked at Hagrid, the giant had rushed her away from her Alpha under the excuse of completing her shopping. Draco had yelled at her that he would write to her as soon as he got home and she had told him that she would wait for his letter
Harry looked at the pin for Magnolia's cape in disgust when they were eight and headed for Diagon Alley. It was something that had come to them through the headmaster of Hogwarts School. Neither of the twins knew why things had to go through the man, but they did. To make sure there was nothing wrong with them
-You told me to do whatever I wanted. That's what I'm doing. If you have complaints you just have to go home
She averted her gaze to the staff table when several of her charms vibrated, warning her of danger. Legimens and a dark force. The one who wanted to get into his mind was the headmaster, but the dark force could be both Professor Snape and the one in the purple turban.
On the part, Ron had entered with her by the force of auror. But otherwise it seemed that everything was the same for the boy she had been engaged to. Only now he was the lover of womens already married.
As children she had adored him, all the Weasley children and Neville. The Weasleys had been the noisy group with whom she burned adrenaline. Neville was calm and quiet.
- Who is Magnolia's real father? - Remus was with Lily while Sirius and James were on a mission. Lily left Harry in the crib next to her sleeping sister who now had orange hair.
Unless Heather looked in the mirror and saw the lightning bolt scar on her forehead. It was relatively small and went almost unnoticed. But it had been made with magic and it would never go away
-You know, dear girls, that the birth name gives power over you. To curse you. That is why we gypsies give public names to our children on special occasions. She kissed the two girls. They were similar with the black curls, although one had many more curls than the other, the only difference was the onyx eyes and the emerald ones. Zefrina looked at the Hittite mythology book she was reading, they were names indicated- My blood daughter, you are Arinna Arate, like the Hittite goddess of the sun. My daughter of magic and spirit, you who defeated death itself when it came to claim you, your name will be Lelwani Arate, the name of the Hittite goddess of the underworld.
-Come in, dear. You are the only hope that this boy will marry and start a family. I noticed it even when I lived
He was aware that Harriet did not love him. But that could always change, he had the determination to make that change
Oh shit! Well, it was true that she could stop the war, currently Tom Riddle was still a child and could adopt her. But…. Memories of Harry brought to mind the memory of Walburga's portrait
After that his mother decided to condense all the years of education to be a Sirius lord in him. Being an obedient child he had wanted to please his mother in everything. He would have carried the dark mark had it not been for Heather's hands on a human Patronus that she sent for him.
- Dora has sent us a new letter! Harry held up the envelope and Magnolia got suitably excited. Andromeda and Ted laughed, Dora was taking her new duties as a big sister very seriously
- So they wanted to do that to break you and Regulus offered to go first to make sure they didn't harm you. - Remus nodded his head
* Only with the redhead who mates with her friend and some classmates * the snake shook his head * When will you convince her to do more talking? Many want to mate with him, we smell it in the air around him *
Draco looked at the sheet of paper where Harriet's letter was being written, a letter in which she revealed her heart. Draco wished he could elope with her to Gretna Green right then.
Regulus rose and flopped down on the pillows of the Potter family infirmary. There was a small place to make urgently needed potions, but the infirmary was quite comfortable and smooth. A very bright and bright place
The Dursleys had tried to say that their son's second bedroom was the twins'. But the bed had a layer of dust and there was nothing in that bedroom that seemed used in a long time. And then the guest bedroom, which was empty except for the bed and the closet. Not like the closet under the stairs, which had pictures of both children and the remains that they slept on that little mattress.
-The Omega emit a unique floral aroma. And Alphas can recognize what Omega is meant to be with by smell. It's something similar to soul mates but deeper. - Hagrid explained it as the goblin gave Rose Marie a bag from which she could take ten galleons a month from her chamber, her allowance
Tom looked out the window. Harriet had been unable to play due to her role as the Gryffindor princess. But this window was the closest to the playing field. You could see perfectly and they could see you too.
Zefrina wrote a letter in the language of the gypsies making it very clear where her suggestions could be put. And then I enclose a polite note in Greek refusing to return to Greece
And she was awakened when news of the dark lord's death swept through the wizarding world. Magnolia entered the compartment of the train where Draco was, alone for the first time in his life. Without Crabbe or Goyle, without Parkinson or Bulstrode. He was better than his twin brother's wagon full of admirers
Rose Marie was reading a book and Draco was looking at it over her shoulder before the door swung open so hard the glass would have been broken without magic.
To think that the dark lord was only thirteen years younger than Sirius was strange. But there he was, in front of a Tom Riddle who was looking at him defiantly and an alcoholic matron who seemed willing to do anything for a bottle.
A part of Severus wanted to scream really loud. Especially since the damned James Potter did not hesitate to blame him for being Harriet's first love. It wasn't his fault that happened!
Magnolia got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and looked out the window in time to see a very old man in a shiny dress walking out of the house. Beside her was a woman in a peaked hat. The man turned to look at her and smiled at her before winking at her.
Severus was carefully picking young leaves from a plant with very poisonous teeth when he fell through a broken grate. At once many tentacles began to surround him.
-Lily, my brother has been so in love with you since the day he met you that we could have painted a portrait of you without seeing all the letters he sent me describing you. Besides that he sent me a howler when you agreed to go out with him
-Twin- the girl turned and started walking through what looked like a sewer- The tunnels change every ten minutes. You won't find the way out if you don't follow me
The rumor was spreading and the last she had heard was that the Gryffindor was pregnant. Or that she liked having orgies with people from other houses and there were several Slytherins in the library waiting their turn.
In the thousand-year history of Hogwarts, only fifteen marriages had been recorded between members of both houses. There weren't even romances between the houses
Arcturus had married her as fast as he could to a LeStrange, but that had only increased Bellatrix's madness and obsession. She had brought her husband from her native France to Great Britain to serve "His Lord"
Rose Marie pulled the cape over her forehead even more. The Malfoys walked proudly through the train station as she followed Narcissa's hand. The woman said goodbye to both with a kiss on the cheek and wishes for a great year
- Heather Potter, nice to meet you. - The girl smiled, if she looked like James. There were so many Potter present that calling him Potter would only be confusing.
-She's my twin… She… The situation is complicated, she couldn't go to Hogwarts. If she leaves the house, the ministry people may try to capture her. But no need to worry, there are protection rooms to prevent him - a breaking sound was heard throughout the property and James ran to the window and looked outside.
-From what I know, it's because he wanted to keep your claws away from his cute little sister. She didn't want you to play with her and break her heart-Sirius took offense at that and started making a fuss while walking in circles.
Fortunately, they had managed to move everything to the vaults before cleaning. That relieved Magnolia a lot.
-Remember, act as I have taught you. Only eat from things that you see others eat. And only five sweets. If you like, I will send a letter to the hostess to ask her to lend us her house elf for a few days.
Her family had been tainted after her great-uncle endorsed Grindelwald, and the few nobles who held them in esteem had turned on their sides when her father married a Muggle-born. They really only had the Blacks now, who were the most powerful family. But Uncle Sirius had to deal with his own family of lunatics and couldn't always protect them.
They took her back to her room and after a while the door opened to reveal an Orion who looked as dark as the clouds in the sky.
-I would never have done that! - Five circles- Well, I don't think I would have- Three more circles- I respect James too much to do something like that- Ten circles- Would I have tried not to?
Faced with that offer, he wouldn't say anything. Remus might kill him later, but he was a profiteer and an opportunist
Of course the thoroughbreds and others were laughing softly. Lelwani felt bored and surprised. Surprised that the newspapers had nicknamed her Harry Potter instead of her full name, so everyone thought she was a boy.
- Let me clarify this, harpy- he approached the bed and grabbed the front of Walburga's wedding dress, the seams were slightly ripped.- I didn't want this wedding and I don't know how you convinced them to happen. But I hate you and I despise you, I want you to know that I will not touch you until the term of the contract is close to its fulfillment. I will not stain with you
Magnolia liked the two first-year girls, they were cute and pure. Besides, spending the summer with the Weasleys had been interesting. Although her future mother-in-law had insisted that she visit her to check her manners.
-She was classified in Gryffindor and he in Slytherin. Even so, they maintained their friendship. I hoped at that moment that one day they would become a connecting link between the two houses. End the conflict. But the young man one day insulted the girl in a moment of rage, he called her Mudblood.
-Yes, dear- Tom lowered the newspaper and smiled- Or do you think something of what happened that afternoon was a coincidence?
Watching Harriet be humiliated the following year was painful. Ron seemed not to notice how every day the smile of that cheerful and outgoing girl that Harriet had been disappeared. How the other heirs of important houses insulted her and whispered things about her behind her back and when she cried when Ron's infidelities were made public in the newspaper
Part of Harriet wondered what he would do when he grew old or crippled from aurora's work, but that was none of her business. She had withdrawn because of the pregnancy and she did not believe that she would forcibly return. There were too many bad things there.
-No, they all have good and bad things. Gryffindors shine brightly on these walls, but rarely outside. Slytherins dominate politics, but are looked down upon at school. Hufflepuffs are underrated by everyone, but they will be the most supportive of you and the strength is in the numbers. And the Ravenclaws have a lot of knowledge and intelligence, but they live locked in their tower full of books without ever living a single adventure.
A scroll appeared before Harriet and unrolled in front of her. Her engagement agreement. Ronald Bilius Weasley's name faded before Harriet's eyes to be replaced by another
-Most of the people we will see today have inflated egos and an important position in the ministry. Remember that you are my protégé and lift your head with pride. The Black family supports you, Tom
-Mother will be fine, I care more about the lions of England and what they can do to you if you are alone- Arinna smiled- Besides, two gypsies are not expected in that school of magic. We will prove to them that we are cheating, deceitful and charming ladies of the Gypsy clan. Although you are the lady of a house there, from what I understand
The woman looked at Aunt Andy for a few seconds before lowering her gaze to Magnolia and then looking fondly at the boy clinging to her robe.
She hoped that as they followed family law he would develop other feelings for her. Although Kreacher had been complaining about the two of them together for some reason. Harriet brushed her belly.
Rose Marie looked at the other two beds in the Gryffindor Tower Omegas bedroom. It was in the farthest part of the castle from the dorm for Slytherin Alphas. She wanted to be with Draco, damn hat
Zefrina Melitta, née Arate, looked at the divorce document in front of her. One of her hands caressed her belly secretly as she listened to her father argue with the Lord of her husband's house.
Harriet went up to the attic when her legs were working again and she reached where the portraits were kept. Specifically those of Sirius' grandparents
From time to time aurors could be seen flying around the property and the Potters were believed to have done something the ministry suspected was illegal. But they could never prove anything
-What are their names? - Remus was more discreet, but the man did not hesitate to smile when her finger was grabbed by the baby in the crib
The department of mysteries was still trying to dissolve the curse given by the holy 28, as far as Heather knew. It wasn't that bad, in the girl's opinion. It was only a curse that made all the ineffable who entered the doors feel all the damage they had done to minors. The minister himself had refused to let the curse-breakers come to help them because, and he literally quoted: "You provoked them, deal with it."
Also, she had time before Orion tried to do something, since, according to Sirius: "My father waited until the last possible moment before leaving my mother pregnant with me."
- Grandpa, do magic, do magic. Sirius clung to Arcturus' knees in such a way that Euphemia smiled. The wand came out of his sleeve and Arcturus summoned a Patronus. The hawk-shaped patronus flew around the children who exclaimed in happiness.
That happened a week before Rose Marie's letter from Hogwarts arrived and they fled to that lighthouse. Now she was with Hagrid going to get money. Rose Marie was a little worried about the giant, but she seemed harmless
Andromeda silenced her steps with magic as she approached the nursery. The children were asleep in a knot of limbs in the same bed, despite the fact that she had left them lying on both beds
-Draco ... - Magnolia extended her hand towards the boy but he moved further against the window of the car- Draco, what's wrong with you? - At that moment Magnolia realized that it was their first private conversation since Yule's dance with fourteen. years old and now they were eighteen
* The only time she seems to have a closer relationship with a male is you, heir of Slytherin * the snake laughed in a chilling way, the snakes did not know how to do otherwise. * Although she runs away from you a lot *
Ron would not be a good husband to Harriet, Neville doubted that he would change at some point in his life, and being a lord would only make it worse. Ron wanted attention after spending his entire life with six siblings. And that desire would never disappear, it would be an eternal hunger
-They say that since that moment Dumbledore has hated the idea of destined companions and has separated several couples. That's why many of us hide the fact of being paired, at least those of us who don't believe all the Dumbledore shit-Angelina sigh- My partner is Oliver Wood, we are part of the Quiddicht team and we have decided to go out publicly as a couple next year
-Hi, I'm Angelina and this is Lee. We will be your roommates as the only Omega in Gryffindor. It's wonderful to meet you, Rose
-A mix of mama bear and mama hen with a hint of helicopter breeding. But yeah, James is very overprotective. But it is one of his good points, if he cares he will take care of you to death
-Yes Luna, you're right. Also, our marriage agreement makes infidelity on both sides very painful, physically speaking- Magnolia looked out the window at her fiancé who was still chatting with the blushing girl- There is no love there, only mutual benefits
Orion left the room and Harry / Walburga could hear her father-in-law and mother-in-law arguing with their son over her. She sighed and watched as the dress slid off as it was now torn.
-Wrap your arms around my neck. It is best to start with a kiss to relax. You just let me take care of everything and let me know if you feel uncomfortable or upset about something
-His family served the witch who killed your parents. Dark witches, of the worst kind. It is better that you associate with more suitable families. Like the Longbottoms or the Weasleys. The director said ...
He showered quickly before appearing at the doors of Hogwarts and going through a secret tunnel to his quarters in the dungeons. Years ago he limited his getaways to Saturdays and Sundays. But this year he couldn't hold back.
Harry turned to look at the headmaster who had already left. How could he choose if he didn't know where the trains would take him?
- - That's because she likes you, Harriet. She wouldn't give you that privilege if she didn't like you. My mother was black before she married my father, and your paternal grandmother was also black.
Lily looked at James as they did the lineage test. She knew what would come out, but that didn't make it hurt less for James to do this. She had told him everything, she had not hidden anything. James knew exactly what had happened.
She knew that Dumbledore was just a gentle looking spider. At any moment its thread would catch you and leave you behind to flee from predators.
- - I don't want to break our engagement, Draco Malfoy. You protected me during the war and I have known you since childhood, you were threatened in your own home and in your school. I'm not going to break our engagement and I'm not going to leave you so easily- Magnolia blushed softly, looking at the painting as Luna had said so long ago. She loved her brother, she certainly loved him.
Narcissa thought that it was a little mercy for the girl not to see what Draco's magic had done with the house or with the family that lived there.
-You shouldn't talk to that boy- Hagrid looked at Rose Marie who was cooing the snowy owl they just gave her- He's a Malfoy
The boy was silent and in a few seconds his magic exploded out of sheer rage. Narcissa looked at Lucius knowing what was happening. It was as clear as day to someone traditionally educated what was going on
One evening, a few weeks later, Harry arrived back at his comfortable home at Godric's Hollow. It was the same one his parents had lived in, and it honestly hadn't been in bad nick. A couple of house-elves - ably marshalled by the always-enthusiastic Dobby - had got it ship-shape in no time. There wasn't really any lasting damage from the attack all those years ago, as most of the spells hadn't even scorched the walls. And the protective spells still held firm, given that he'd manually removed the knowledge of the location of the house from Wormtail's head. The last thing he wanted was for that little annoyance to turn up on his doorstep unannounced.
"So." Harry spat a bit of blood on the floor. "I guess you like beating up kids then. You're what, seventy or something, and you've been obsessed with me since I was one year old?" He smirked. "Go on, Tom, since we've established you've still got a cock... Is this what you get your rocks off to? I guess it'd explain why you're so keen to recruit all of your minions' kids into your little death cult. Does it make you hard when you hurt kids?"
"Oh please. What mad historical dark lord would create a resurrection ritual that specifically missed off the nose? Why the nose, anyway? Surely you'd have lost your ears too, if it was just slicing off extremities willy-nilly..." Harry broke off with an expression of horror. "Hang on.. surely it hasn't... do you..."
Harry breathed, deeply, enjoying the almost orgasmic euphoria of draining the magic of a powerful wizard. Nothing quite compared to it. The high was just as good as when he'd done the exact same thing to Dumbledore, a few months earlier.
hillbillies better known as the Gaunts, who lived in a shed in the middle of a swamp and had sex with each other. Honestly, it's a miracle he wasn't born with webbed fingers."
He considered just removing the man's head, but honestly you never knew when you'd need a rat, even if it was just as target practice.
. Although, following the debacle in the graveyard, Lord Voldemort had learned at least a microscopic grain of caution, in not handing him his wand back and demanding a duel.
for the man, for a brief moment then. "Hang on, you call that mug fully restored? Merlin, how ugly were you before?"
That floating voice appeared in the back of his head, once again, trying to fill his head with cotton wool and happy visions of obedience and supplication. Wouldn't it be better if he held his tongue? If he obeyed? If he gave in to the Dark Lord's wishes, accepted his Mark, and then accepted his inevitable death?
Harry blinked, and took a moment to focus on the man addressing him. "Oh, it's you. What's new, dickhead?" He looked around at the cavernous stone chamber and barked out a laugh, more wild than humorous. "Nice place you've got here. A real ambiance to it. Can't fault you for style, I suppose."
He dropped his head and looked at the floor. “Well, at least I don’t smell like cheap perfume.” He whispered in his defence.
About an hour later, Harry caught the bloody snitch, finally, ‘cause he was really tired. His times were getting worse, and he  wasn’t sure if it was because of the year he spent in the hunt for Horcruxes and didn’t pay, or if it was because he was super distracted this year.
Once alone, he looked at the mountain of “get-well-soon” catds and all those sweets people had left him.
“Okay.” He whispered back, heart beating against his rib cage, the confirmation of a future… relationship ringing in his ears.
“Hey, Potter?” he asked, while Harry messed with the hair that clang to his forehead, too tired to even lift his head and to contemplate the flushed look on that pale face.
Hermione looked a Ginny questioningly and kicked Ron’s leg under the table—who had been discussing something with Dean about his first month with Seamus and had probably forgotten about the fact that he should be watching his friend— and they all watched as Harry stumbled through the Great Hall and made his way to his room.
Every pair of eyes —including the teachers’— were following the boy who lived as he left the Great Hall.
Throughout the whole game, Harry noticed something was off with Ron. He was usually distracted during practice, it could be because of the Slytherin laughing as they passed by, because of the last Bludger that had hit him in the head, or—recently— because of the new thing the Headmistress, McGonagall, and the other professors were altering in the pitch, behind that white blanket they used to cover it up.
Slowly, not wanting to break the illusion, he reached with his hand to his abdomen—feeling a rush of minor pleasure wherever his fingertips touched— laying it flat on his stomach and reaching down carefully, touching and examining the feel of the bites and marks he knew were there.
Madam Pomfrey was trying to heal him, but it was a difficult thing to do when she was out of skelegrow for his leg, which was broken.
“What do you want, Potter?” He spat, walking forward. “I’ve seen you look at me. I’ve seen the WAY you look at me. I bet you think of me as the filthy Death Eater who tried to kill Dumbledore, don’t you?” When he finished, Harry felt his feet hit the wall behind him— since he had been walking backwards the whole time— but that didn’t scare him.
They stayed there maybe a second, maybe an hour; but what brought Harry back to reality from the trance they were in was the hair that fell in the blond’s pale face—which he now noticed that, besides not being gelled back like in he previous year, it was also longer, but not in a feminine way.
Those memories were like seeds that no matter how many times you rip them, they’ll eventually grow back.
“We.” A kiss “Can’t” another couple of kisses “Shouldn’t” Harry grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him so their chests were pressed together. “But” kiss and a soft bite on the bottom lip. “We.”
“Yes!” He interrupted her, getting up from his spot by the fireplace. “About that, I need to ask you both for a favour”
Maybe he should find an excuse to talk with some nice Hufflepuff or a honest Ravenclaw—something Harry had learned over the years was that no one should ever, EVER, ask for Gryffindor or Slytherin's opinion without being sure of themselves first, because they would probably totally honest without filter or try to lie to you and totally fail because the smiles would end up being totally fake.
The Patil twins already had someone to go with, as did Hermione—of course— and every Gryffindor girl.
She shrugged and kept eating, trying to ignore Ron’s confused glances as to where she had been looking at.
Oh, how Ron would love to spend hours dancing with Hermione and everyone looking at him while he wore Percy’s old suit that he had worn at Bill’s wedding along with his first interview at the Ministry.
Shaking her head, ‘Mione managed her best to ignore the sexual tension and confusion following Harry and her boyfriend, respectively, and to not smack her own head against a wall and went back to her book about the translation of old wizarding runes.
Harry looked at the Great Hall again and saw the person he was looking for. Malfoy was just leaving, with Pansy pug-faced Parkinson in his tail.
Izy nodded. “Dobby gives Izy socks, sir.” The Elf showed him his feet, the left one with a red sock and the right one with a green one. “Izy miss Dobby, sir.”
Malfoy sneered ar him, Harry rolled his eyes and gave a step in the opposite direction of the Slytherin, trying to be as distant from the cunning snake as possible.
Malfoy’s face was stuck in a weird facial expression—as if he were in pain— and he was red from the top of his head to his neck—which made Harry wonder how fat the blush would go.
Harry, after drying himself with a quick wave of his wand, he put on his clothes calmly, noticing that some Slytherins still hadn’t left.
Merlin knows why George would make Ron pay double the price and Harry could have their products for free.
In his head he could hear the part of him whispering “breathe” fading away as the last seconds ticked in the clock and, finally, the bell rang. Everyone started to pack their things magically, but he did it the old muggle way and grabbed his things and leapt from his seat, running toward the Gryffindor tower and completely forgetting about dinner and the fact that he had barely eaten the whole day.
“From now on,” he said, “we’ll have practice just before the Slytherins! I heard our captains discussing it and—“
Ron looked at her with a raised eyebrow, but it was quickly changed to a pleased and exited expression.
He should be in practice right now. He only had two days until Monday’s game, he was so bloody screwed.
He got in front of the mirror in the bathroom and stared intensely into his own eyes and asked himself out loud “What are you doing, Potter? What would your father say if he were here? And your mother? And- and if you keep this up, will you ever tell Ron and ‘Mione? Will you tell them you’re dating Draco-Slytherin-ferret-Malfoy? Are you dating Malfoy? Or are you just fuck buddies with him? They will be so mad! What the hell is wrong with you?! Why did you have to be such a perv? Boy-who-lived my ass, more life creep-who… I don’t even know! Ron is the funny one!” he sighed and hit his head against the mirror, closing his eyes and groaning loudly like the frustrated fucking idiot he was.
All Harry could feel was the weight laying on top of him, his breathing hard and fast, and the butterflies on his stomach.
And Harry, of course, would be very pleased as well with his gift — a little help with his “relationship” with Draco Malfoy.
Harry watched as they lips were pressed together and their hands travelled around each other’s bodies.
“Hold that thought.” George said, then cast a quick spell on the box and it stopped moving. He nodded, urging Harry to continue.
But at the time he had only been in the common room, now he was in one of the dorms— the boys’ one, judging by the pair of boxers he had just stepped in.
In someone else’s mind, this would make no sense. In Harry’s, though, knowing what he knows, makes I’m think of himself as a genius.
The bemused chuckle came back as the blond shook his head and waved his wand, casting a silence charm around them and making both of their underpants disappear.
As he looked outside the window, appreciating the colours the sky got in the morning , he noticed that there was a head of messy ginger hair in the grass and went to see why Ginny was up so early.
The kisses on the neck continued; a cold hand crept up his tight and under his shirt. A shiver ran down his spine, he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and closed his eyes. Draco’s lips kept softly kissing up his neck, biting sweetly once in a while; he reached his jawline and started kissing up to his cheek, dropped a slow kiss on his forehead, the tip of his nose and on and on until he finally kissed the left corner of Harry’s- much hotter than Draco’s- lips; which should be turning blue any moment.
“What’s wrong, Potter? Did my lips not taste Gryffindor-ish enough?” he asked, seductively licking the blood from his bottom lip, making Harry forget about his prior concerns immediately, reaching up and kissing him again, pressing his legs tighter around his waist and moaning when his hand made its way down his body again.
But it felt so good whenever he and Malfoy kissed. And he still wanted more, needed more. Also, there was no one around, so what could go wrong? As far as he knew, even if they did get caught, he wasn’t aware of any rule that stated student couldn’t get involved with each other. Sure they wouldn’t go further than they already had, at least not if the ferret kept escaping through his fingers every time.
Ginny, for example, would certainly go with Luna —and even if it pained him to admit, they made a great couple.
Several minutes later and the only thing that had made him feel at least a bit alive was a spider that came out of a book.
So he left the Great Hall. He literally ran to the tower where his dorm was, and stayed in bed until classes had ended that day
He was quite bigger now, compered to his earlier years, so the cloak only covered one person now, unlike the good old time when he, Ron and `Mione walked around school grounds under it. Still, he liked his rule breaking side.
Even Zabini, the only fool at school who would dare date Pansy— used to be pug face— Parkinson, told him he liked his fresh cut grass of the Quidditch field smell.
He took his cloak off just to feel the breeze on his face and walked and walked until his feet hurt. It was cold, just like he liked, now that he could sleep in a comfortable bed in a large room with people he liked instead of under a staircase. Though, he really liked snow as well as the cold weather, he hoped snow wouldn’t ruin his plans.
There was cold and a feeling of emptiness, his lips were searching and only found air, his hands were free and he was so hard it hurt. His breath left him in short, fast puffs, his head hit the wall behind him and he rested his weight against it, afraid that his legs could give in at any second and he would be on his knees but not how he wanted.
He had been so focused on every detail around him he could name every single person in the room and where they were sitting, how they sat or even how many quills they had brought to class; but could not repeat a single word the tiny professor had said.
And, from that moment to the end of the class, Ron payed attention to every word said and, above all, tried to hide his blush that made his face look redder than his hair.
And then—right beside a green, old book, whose title was to worn out to even read— there was the book he was looking for!
sorry if it was not as good as expected, and soooooooooooooo sorry it took me so long to post again!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, Harry was tired. So, he dressed his pyjamas, and went to bed after washing his teeth the muggle way, as he always did. He closed the curtains around his bed and, just like Hermione had taught him, placed a silencing charm around him so no one could hear him if he had nightmares nor could he hear the others if they made any sound.
As Draco kissed down Harry’s neck, biting at his pulse point and licking over the same spot, sending shivers up his spine, there was an annoying fucking thought nagging his bloody mind. Unfortunately for him, it was probably one of the few things that could make him even consider slowing down what was happening with the blond.
And when he opened his eyes once more, the speed of the bumping muscle inside his rib cage doubled. He WAS in the exact position Parkinson had been just moments before.
Once the cloak was hiding his entire body, he went to the stairs that led to the girls’ dorms, only to remember he couldn’t walk in there because of the enchantments—of course the professors would repair this damage after the war, but the male’s bathroom in the fourth floor with doors that don’t lock properly are totally fine ( Harry knows this because of personal experience).
Harry grabbed the small object after his face got a confused expression, but soon it was replaced with a frown and then a red face and angry eyes.
“Neville, I need your help! Please! How can I take this smell out of me? It's driving me crazy; everyone is gossiping about me me because of it! Please, help me!” He gripped his friend’s shoulders and shook him a bit.”Besides, if you have time, do you have any perfume that you would give me— just because I hate my old one and I wanted a new one and I went through your bag and—“ Harry said as quick as he could even though he still hadn’t caught his breath.
Ron was so thankful at the moment for having a cunning Slytherin helping him plan when Hermione couldn’t or refused to.
Unfortunately, his mind changed a lot. He might have wanted to get this person out of his system before, but at this precise moment, he wanted nothing more but to hold him for hours on end and hear their moans mixed and smell their scents mixed and have their bodies mixed as one.
Those despicable long fingers he wanted to beg for, the mouth which mouthed the words as he wrote too. Oh, and the fucking quill he was using. He had to lift the quill and nibble at the end of it with his teeth, of course.
“Have you seen the Patil twins this year? I mean, I’d shag Parvati senseless and still have energy to do the same to Padma...”
"What do you want?" He whispered back, his hand reaching for his wand, however before he could grab it, another hand with sharp nails and cold skin was on his wrist.
A few minutes later—when his feet were already tired and sore and he was leaning against the wall—he heard the water in one of the sinks inside the bathroom running and held his breath, waiting for the steps about to come in his direction.
He looked again at the trio discussing perfumes and smells and saw the girls giggling to each other as Harry sniffed his arms and shirt. Ron assumed he had already been sprayed since the smell reached his nostrils almost immediately and gave him a huge headache.
Besides, he was truly excited, just like everyone else, to discover what McGonagall had been doing and why it all had to be such a big surprise.
“He’s completely bloody obsessed!” Groaned Hermione, as Harry left the hall with his eyes fixed on the blond. Even though he thought no one had noticed, Hermione was sure everyone in the Great Hall noticed.
Malfoy sighed and looked at Harry with wary eyes. “It relaxes me, alright, Potter? Not everyone has a life as careless as yours.”
Stepping closer, Harry tried to explain how it worked, just like George had. He explained about the Evanesco spell that was placed in it so that the pieces would automatically disappear and that, however, you wanted to bring the parchment back, you just had to click on the reverse button and it would come back good as new; funly enough, he also explain, if you wanted to destroy the parchment permanently and destroy all proof of its existence, all it took was to do the damn incendio yourself.
Harry knew this, of course, because he had been, again —not in a creepy way, though —spying in the blond with his magical map and had gone to the astronomy tower to see what he was up to while on the lake.
Malfoy looked away, checking to see if they could leave and probably to hide the new wave of redness on his face—that Harry just assumed was from relief at the thought of being free.
He heard the blond excuse himself to the bathroom after a couple of jokes about the Gryffindors, so he followed him.
He had been staring at his ceiling all morning. While his friends were at breakfast he was just doing what seem to be his favourite hobby now, questioning his actions— thank Godric Quidditch practice was going to start right after the Yule Ball the next day, so he could take his mind out of this mess.
His pace got faster and faster until he was practically running. He passed a few students who were still up, for some reason- it was already past curfew- who looked at him as if he were crazy. Not an entire lie, honestly. For what he was about to do, he definitely had some problem.
He gave Harry a heartless, tired glare and Harry simply pointed up. As soon as he spotted he key, Malfoy threw himself at the floor, laying down like the dramatic little bitch he was.
“As you all know, during the... last year incidents, our Quidditch pitch and locker rooms were damaged —like the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff’s— or totally destroyed—like the Slytherin and Ravenclaw’s.”
He had planned , with his new “friend”’s help, a plan that, if everything went well, would only last two weeks to be complete.
He threw a few galleons to the counter where an old witch was cleaning, yelled a “thank you” over his shoulder and made his way back. As unnoticed as he had been the other way around.
For a slight second, when Malfoy unglued his lips from his body, Harry thought he was gone again, but as he looked up he noticed the blond was just taking his own shirt off as well as his trousers, leaving only his dark underwear on and a very visible bulge Harry wanted to lick so bad.
“Potter!” Draco called, snapping his pale, long fingers in front of Harry’s eyes. “I’m doing my best here and would appreciate it if you at least pretended to care”.
Ginny would strangle him, or even use an unforgivable. She was capable of anything, that crazy sister of his! How was it possible that the girl, a few months younger than him, had created the evil Bat Boogy Hex?
Thanks, Morgana, Harry had left it in the same place he always did since Fred and George has given it to him:
anything else is the same.” Madame Pomfrey explained with a smile, looking at something behind Harry's back—but, of course, when he looked, nothing was there.
It all started when, after such a dreadfully erotic night, Draco made everything in his power to ignore Harry. And by all that is sacred he noticed: he noticed him purposefully walking past him in between classes and bumping into him without even a glance to spare; he noticed him picking Ron, because he had chocolate all over his face, and didn’t even remark about the fact that Harry did as well. He even stopped himself from laughing at Harry’s failed attempt at casting a spell in class, which cast his own hair on fire.
And he left. Going as fast as possible, as to not get caught, entering his own dorm and taking a cold shower. He was so hard it didn’t take much for him to end. A few images of Potter’s body contorting with pleasure and his blushing face holding his moans his passed through Draco’s mind as he rested his forehead against the cold shower wall. Completely forgetting the reasons to why he had been upset in the first place; which would come back to bite him in the ass, later.
McGonagall had announced that the Yule Ball would require formal robes —just like it was written in the letter— so almost everyone went there to buy theirs.
The grin he had before quickly disappeared and was replaced by a frown and then face that only appeared when he was too frustrated to even make a joke about a certain situation.
To his big surprise, that damn cam chose Dean and Seamus— or Deamus, as Ginny called it— after that.
It felt good, for about five minutes, when he finally remembered how nervous he actually should be and the reason for it.
He felt like he was trying to prove to a scared wounded animal that it was safe and that he could trust him.
Once they got there and changed to their respective clothes, Ginny explained the new techniques they’d be using against the other teams.
When he made sure the other Seeker was not looking at him, he sped up towards his target — with Zabini narrating every movement he made — and the snitch flew away once more, stopping right in front of the screen of the kissing cam.
He got up, bid his friends goodbye —without noticing the roll of Hermione’s eyes, the grin stretched across Luna and Ron’s face or the odd look Ginny gave him— and left the Hall. Aware of the pair of grey orbs following him silently.
It would be nearly impossible— because they wouldn’t notice a hint even if glued to their eyelids—she knew, but what else did she have to do this year (since she had already read every text book) without someone threatening their lives?
“She’s crazy, Harry, mate! I’m telling you! She started to get angry when I mentioned Luna and I guess she went over the edge because of the bloody frog! Merlin” he whispered under his breath, “I wanted that card!”
“Hermione, PLEASE, let me go back to my dorm. I’ll even do my transfiguration homework.” He was so fucking bored.
When he opened his eyes again, he spotted a head full of silvery blond hair, almost shining from the moonlight a few meters away from him.
He wanted to tell them to go to hell, but Parkinson leaned her head so her lips were right beside Ron’s ear and whispered something.
Harry pressed his head to the wall behind him, sensing that it truly helped to relax, even if not much and that’s when he heard it.
As soon as he complained- more precisely, his stomach almost yelled at him to go get food- Izy smiled, those big round eyes sparkling with joy, and wrapped him some scones and wished him good luck after he told the Elf he had somewhere important to be- or better, someone important to meet.
Harry’s green eyes focused on a pair of puffy, blood shot where they should be white and a dull grey where it should be the colour of a silver dagger of some sort.
He would never admit it, but he was extremely grateful for the fact that Malfoy called them to the pitch and warned them to hurry up or they wouldn’t have time to practice.
She gave Ron and Harry theirs and, after finishing reading it, they both looked at each other and screamed at the same time. “We are going to need formal clothing?!”
They’d both be alone in the hallway and, Ron knew— even though Harry would never admit it— that Harry had been observing the blond. Just sparing glances whenever he thought no one was looking.
Slughorn cleared his throat and the class looked at him again, “Very good, MrMalfoy, five points to Slytherin.” He turned to Ron. “We had already talked about this potion a few years back, MrWeasley, I would expect you to pay attention in my class, instead of daydreaming about your former potions-master, professor Snape.”
Draco stopped their kissing, just for a split second, biting the bridge of the glasses he was wearing and taking them out with a smirk, placing them – well, wherever they landed when he threw them.
After a while he realizes, though, that he still felt relaxed, from the soap and, he’d never admit it, from the sounds coming from next door.
It was either that or think of a solution an the best he had come to think of was to wait until someone passed there, but the mistletoe had a notice me not charm and it was unlikely someone noticed anything.
Harry gritted his teeth and closed his eyes, taking his glasses off and stepping into the shower, closing the door right behind him.
Harry blushed unconsciously, turned around and left in a quick pace, leaving a smirking Pansy Parkinson behind who ran the opposite way to warn her red headed friend of what just happened.
Of course, with Harry’s luck —he wasn’t sure if it was good or bad luck yet— those seventh and eighth years were exactly who he was looking for.
Well, the second-best option would have to suffice. To the Ravenclaw tower he goes, still holding his breath whenever he remembered what the advice he was seeking was for. How funny was it that he was going to ask his best friend’s sister slash ex-girlfriend’s girlfriend for romantic advice about the guy he… liked.
Harry followed with his eyes as the drops of milk in Malfoy’s pointy chin fell, slowly, one after the other.
When a tear escaped Malfoy’s eye, though, Harry ran his hand through his dark hair and decided he couldn’t take it any longer.
He was in no mood to face Malfoy right now, but he knew he could do nothing to prevent their encounter, since they were like a magnet of opposite poles who attracted each other even against their own will.
He kicked the wall out of irritation and then regretted it, cursing under his breath and sitting on the bed, casting a quick ‘episkey’ on his foot.
He might have even fallen asleep, but the next thing he remembered was seeing only MrsNorris and Filch were walking around the castle.
Oh, right! He's obsessed— for some reason— with that blond, annoying, bouncing ferret who says he stinks and Harry is more determined now than ever to get his revenge on him since his staying at the hospital and everything happening to Harry is Malfoy’s fault.
There was silence. Everyone held their breaths as the Headmistress pointed her wand at the blanket covering a part of the benches in the pitch.
“And— OH!— the Ravenclaw with a big nose has the Quaffle! He passes it to that long brunette boy with the longest hair and — uh, what a shame!— the red headed Gryffindork blocked it, and now his annoying sister has it with a grip as strong as the one she has on that sexy blonde with a lion head, seriously what the fu—“
I’m already working on the next chapter. Sorry for taking so damn long. I was grounded and now with school starting and all. I know my excuses are shitty and all but fuck if I like writing for you. And damn do I love reading your  comments! 💚🖤💚💚🖤
Hermione was with Ginny doing “girl stuff”, which meant Ginny had dragged his girlfriend along with the other female Gryffindors to buy dresses.
Harry swallowed— trying to vanish the dryness from his mouth — and subconsciously licked his lips to moist them as well.
“You are too cold; you’ll get sick if we don’t take you inside.” The lips stopped and Draco’s head dropped on his shoulder again. Harry grabbed his arms to help him get up and walk, but he was trembling so much it would be difficult.
He could not have been more wrong about getting the other boy out of his system once and for all! On the contrary! He wanted him inside as urgently as possible, over and over and forever, making this pain he was feeling inside turn into pleasure until he cried out for more; and anyone who told him to do otherwise be damned. He had wanted to freeze the moment Draco’s tongue touched him, wanted to stay there permanently, forever, memorize the feeling and never let it go, holding the rush that coursed through him until he could take no more.
They reached a moment in Harry’s monologue where Draco stopped walking backwards while he kept walking forward towards him. He didn’t stop until their chests were touching slightly, so he could feel the other boy’s breathing, very deeply for that matter.
“So, tell me,” he reached for a ring of hair hat had fallen in front of his pale forehead “you gonna keep it?”
He tried to convince himself that they were just going to torment some first years or something, but that kept walking until they were standing right behind Ron, both sneering in displeasure.
“Poisonous aquatic plants”; “human eating dangerous whatever”; “the cursed flowers of blah blah blah” he read out loud, rolling his eyes and smirking a bit at his own childlike behaviour.
He wanted to yell out, this wasn’t right, it didn’t feel right. Yet, his hips kept pushing involuntarily, trying to go deeper, as if his subconscious was sure it was just not enough yet, but it was going to get better.
He looked at Malfoy from the corner of his eye and caught him staring questioningly at him, an eyebrow raised to emphasize the mocking, along with a contained smirk.
Ron groaned when he saw his girlfriend run her hand through the cover of every book she thought interesting and rolled his eyes when she grabbed and opened one; but a smile crept in his lips when she smelled it and her expression turned from excitement to pure adoration.
“don’t you dare finish that sentence, Potter!” he yelled as he turned again, eyes shining with tears, as if there was something else in his sentence he wanted to add, like he wanted to yell ‘not you too’.
Every practice, it didn’t matter which house was practicing—there would be a beater colliding in mid air with a seeker, or a chaser with the keeper or, in Ron’s case, with the ground. They would look every time someone —usually a professor or a house elf, which, thanks to Hermione, could only work if they accepted new clothes or a payment for their work— would pass the giant curtain that was hiding whatever it was they were preparing in there.
Sure, why didn’t HE think of THAT before. Oh, right, because he wasn’t a love sick bastard that acts like a moron when he’s close to the person he likes even though that person rejected him!
They tongues fought for dominance, but—unlike in a duel using spells and magic—he didn’t really care about wining, specially when the other boy’s hand started moving around him, finally allowing him to move toward the edge he needed to reach.
It also had a lot of difficult words he didn't know, so he got up from his chair to search for a dictionary.
Malfoy looked at the group of fifth years who were still there and nodded his head towards the door, telling them silently to leave.
“And who are you to tell me what to do, Ronald? If I want to put a fucking chocolate frog in my mouth, I will; just like Hermione will put your dick into hers!” And with that, she stole his last chocolate frog (which had an extremely rare card glued to its leg) and left the compartment.
Mostly, because of the agitation and uneasiness on his head and chest, but also because he was insanely afraid of enjoying the sinful wet dreams with that bastard.
“Looking for this?” Someone behind him asked, and he jumped at the sound of the voice, expecting to be alone until much later.
He reached his destination and stopped. He closed his eyes, breathed in deeply -the smell of grass after the rain. Hmmmm.
Only a few more bloody minutes and he’d be free! After this class he could go to his Quidditch practice!
“After all, who are you going to the Yule Ball with?” That would be a really useful information to prepare the final phase of his plan that could lead to a wedding or a funeral —if he succeeded, Harry and Malfoy would marry, if he didn’t, Harry would probably kill Ron.
“Shh. Don’t say anything.” He whispered in a weirdly seductive voice that made him shiver. The hands that were close to his face, slowly covered his eyes so Harry couldn’t see anything. His mind was blank and his vision dark. His senses were perfected and he felt as if he could fully sense everything happening around his body and feel the magic pulsating through his body.
Yeah, good reason...  Now that he really thought about it, why was he so worried about— oh right! Because now there was a little ferret who didn't deserve kindness and who would be sorry for everything he said to Harry so he followed Neville and drank something his friend put in his hand.
She shook her head, promising herself to ask Ginny about it later and looked at the two oblivious idiots in front of her— Ron and Harry.
He followed him, having no other choice, since the collar of his shirt was being pulled to the point where he’d very soon have a lower neckline.
Then, sudden and unexpectedly, the person who was beside the blond— who Harry identified as Theodor Nott— started laughing at something Blaise Zabini— who was sitting in front of those two with his back turned to Harry — said and elbowed Malfoy is in the arm, making him spill milk and cereals all over himself.
He was so fed up with this so, right after potions, he decided to confront him about his behavior. However, when he was looking around the hallway, trying to spot a blond head in the middle of the crowd – while Ron and ‘Mione kept walking and discussed Merlin knows what— a cold hand grabbed his arm and pulled him behind a tapestry.
They walked into a little closet where the ginger proceeded to turn on the lights and search through some unorganized piles of boxes.
Parkinson and Malfoy had their foreheads pressed together. The girl sitting in the blond’s lap, smirking.
He, for some reason, was swearing as if he were extremely hot. He took off his coat and cast an aguamenti on his hair to keep himself fresh.
Now Malfoy would certainly not be able to contort his nose in that way he always did when he disliked something.
“Leave me the fuck alone, Potter! This is all YOUR fault! Why the fuck cant you just fucking leave me alone! If it weren’t for you no one would suspect anything, you are the reason why they know! I am tired of pretending! Why, Potter!? Why?! Why cant you just let me be. Besides…” he was yelling for most of his speech, except the last part where he whispered, as if warning him. “I´m not gay.”
Maybe the last time he had been alone had been before the war— No, at that time his thoughts were connected with Voldemort’s.
“Do— do you know who that person was?” He noticed her confused expression and added. “In the cam with me, I mean.”
It hadn’t even been an hour since he arrived at the castle and he had had to go to the kitchen to ask the Elves for help. They could at least give him some tea or something that would calm his nerves.
That seemed to shock his mistletoe-parter since he didn’t even make a disapproving sound or anything, only his eyes reacted by almost popping out of his skull.
Harry wondered what he had to be nervous about, what could be so bad that the always so stoic and strong and confident Draco Malfoy would have to destroy every proof of its existence. Maybe a bad grade, though it was unlikely, since the line that usually appeared between his eyebrows when he got a grade he disliked wasn’t there, neither was the small twitch of his wand`s hand, nor the almost unnoticeable almost unexistent twitch of his left eye.
For Ron’s heath it was not very good, since he almost had a stroke when he saw his little sister and Luna already shirtless and snogging so fiercely that they didn’t even notice him.
The snitch was certainly making fun of him, flying out of reach every time his hand got closer to it.
So he grabbed the front of Draco’s black shirt and pulled him, making their chests colide with each other.
The good part of the day was that, during lunch, he and Hermione has talked and she swore she’d spend more time with him. And she always kept her promises!
“Understood, everybo—“ she looked over Harry’s head and, before he could turn around to see what made her stop so abruptly mid sentence, he heard a familiar voice.
Harry was extremely grateful for his friend’s act of kindness and, also, because Neville was very naive.
When I entered she seemed really scared and was all sweaty. She tried to tell me something that seemed important, but was struggling so much that the only thing that left her mouth was ‘I wanna break up’. After that I left and we haven’t talked since.”
He was doing as much as he could during practice, the game against Ravenclaw was almost there; studying for his lessons and, on top of that, like the cherry on top of the cake, the dreams that were haunting him.
He let his mouth explore every part of his neck’s skin and dared bite down hard enough, just to hear his name escape those soft looking lips and his cock got impossibly harder. Suddenly, he was flipped and their positions were changed and the first thing he did was close his legs around the other boy’s body and brought it so close to his own they both lost their breath and had to break the kiss for a minute with their foreheads pressed together.
It’s sad to hear him speak as if his brother was still there, but no one ever corrected him so he’d just let it go.
They looked into each other’s eyes, and the awkward moment became a cheesy one. One of those moments when both of them realize they would rather stay here forever, memorizing each other’s faces, than letting go.
He looked around, focusing on a shadow behind an armour he was sure had just moved, but shrugged off the feeling —reminding himself that the castle was magic— when a head full of platinum blond hair appeared.
Pale grey piercing eyes met his and Harry was sure he wouldn’t be able to ever breathe again. He slid his hand up, until they found Malfoy’s messy, gel-less hair. The blond’s hands were holding Harry’s lower back firmly. They could surely feel each other’s “excitement” by now.
At first, it was just two pairs of lips glued together—just enough to break the spell; then Harry felt Draco’s lips tentatively moving against his own.
But after watching the strange display of affection between Blaise and Theodor, he started to doubt his own assumptions.
When they reached the men’s loo—Harry many meters behind Malfoy—he hid behind an armour and waited—for what, he wasn’t sure.
Harry was still not sure why she was trying to engage him in another conversation, but at least this time he liked the subject.
Ron is bored. What’s better than Quidditch and  a Romance between his best mate and their enemy to end this boringness.
She knew her boyfriend was up to something, especially when he met her eyes and his smirk grew. He took something from one of the pockets of his robes and winked at her, placing the small object close to Harry’s plate.
He was so thankful for having Hermione, since he didn’t want to turn out like his friends. At least— now that Harry was oblivious to every single detail around him — Ron had Neville, who was the only normal boy in that school.
He couldn’t remember his dream, but he was sure this instinct to have a quick release was caused because of all the speculation about the shag between Parkinson and Malfoy.
“Hi, George!” Breathed the girl he now recognized as Luna Lovegood—his sister’s ‘friend’. He remembered now why they called her Loony, since she was always fantasizing and dreaming with her eyes still open.
When he entered the train, he searched for a red head—Ron or Ginny’s— to share a compartment with, supposing they’d be with ‘Mione already.
Harry was, per usual, glaring at someone at the Slytherin table —who she knew was Draco-ferret-face-Malfoy. This time, however, he was whispering something under his breath that sounded like he was reassuring himself how good he smelled and that he didn’t stink.
He read a few more from the Gryffindors and a couple from the Ravenclaws thanking him for the game and saying they’d win next time.
That was enough to keep his eyes open while he was daydreaming about the movement he practiced during the summer.
After the final thrusts, after both of them were riding out the climax, they just laid there. Sweat dripping from their bodies, their scents mixing, their ragged breaths synchronizing, eyes closed, hands intertwined and legs tangled.
Hufflepuff table, almost empty; Ravenclaw table, half-full of people with big shadows under their eyes; Gryffindor table, some third, fifth and maybe second years trying to hold their heads up; last, but not least—since the teacher’s table only had teachers— the Slytherin table was full with almost every Slytherin present, except, of course, the person he wanted to see there the most. That blond flashy hair that stood out on any crowd was no where to be seen.
Now he was here, missing the old “two-hundred-points-from-Gryffindor”Snape. At least in his classes the hatred would make the ginger feel alive. He really hated having potions with the Slytherins.
He would never admit it, but he missed Snape, at least he could be entertained with someone yelling at him for being—
“It’s from Hogwarts!” She exclaimed. “There’s one for me, for you, Harry, Ron and for the two giggling girls down there.”
Ron and the Gryffindors we’re entering the  male locker rooms to prepare themselves for Quidditch, just like the girls in their team were doing in the female one.
Ginny laughed at that— actually LAUGHED!— and shook her head. “I’ll be concerned about Ron when he stops eating a chicken and a half every day. Seriously, ‘Mione, he stole your toast and you didn’t even notice.”
“Still distracting Draco, but we only have a few more minutes before he starts complaining and gives some excuse to leave.”
Thank Merlin at least this walk ended up as soon as he saw an oddly recognizable dark blond head near the lake.
Stepping forward, not sure what he was about to do, he felt the urge to protect the person in front of him from something that he didn’t even know what it was.
“Parkinson” he shot back, lifting his chin so his neck would be exposed and the perfume could reach her nostrils easily.
They all went and she smiled with a slight blush when Ron complimented her with red ears and a red face.
The easiness seemed to not subside, since he started to unbutton his shirt and Harry got up, not believe nope that bullshit.
He got up, got dressed, got a shower and then practically showered again with the liquid inside the bottle which Ron had given to him, which he had been staring at after yesterday for at least a couple of hours.
And so Ron gets distracted, thinking about how his friend and Malfoy are so freaking perfect for each other and forgets to listen to the conversation to actually know what he should do for the next part of the plan.
‘Now I am studying, Ronald’, ‘More five minutes to finish this chapter, Ron,’ ‘Ginny and I this , Ginny and I that’ she can’t even spend bloody five minutes with me and—“
Okay, Harry thought, last day to try this and have his revenge on the only person in the world who got in his nerves more often than Voldemort.
That’s why he chose to be obsessed over Draco fucking Malfoy, the only one who knows how much he suffered because he lived it as well.
“Don’t mess with them, Theo. Pansy isn’t here to watch you can stop pretending now!” Every other Slytherin started laughing and Zabini made kissing noises at Theodor, making him blush as fiercely as Ron.
“Call him a bastard again, I dare you, ungrateful idiot! I bet it’s your fault he came here, crying, upset, sobbing some gibberish about losing the most important thing in the world, and how it was unfair that-“
They all nodded and started whispering to each other what was going to happen and who’s idea this was.
He now regretted almost killing the blond, they were at war, after all, no one really wins without scars.
He started kissing down Harry’s shoulders, annoyed at the fact that Granger and the Weasel were on Potter’s mind while they were doing THIS, of all things. He moved to Harry’s chest and belly, leaving a wet trace of kisses on his way, until he finally reached the hem of his underwear and bit it as seductively as he could, never breaking eye contact as he pushed it down to Harry’s knees and proceeded to take them off with his hands and tossed them aside.
He didn’t know if it were because of the bite itself if the groan —that was more like a moan, in reality — he made, but it made reality too overwhelming for either of them to ignore it.
Malfoy looked at what he had just been given and was now holding, confused, and with an angered tone said “what the fuck?”
She looked at the new kids, looking terrified. There were some second years—boys and girls— some third and forth year girls and a fifth year boy alongside a sixth year girl.
Yeah, that’s great, Harry, why don’t you just get going? It’s late and you have stuff to do.” She hurried him outside, which only added to his confusion.
Harry didn’t know who the fuck he was talking about, but Merlin did he not give a shit about the bracelet now that he was awake and tight down there. “Let’s just breath and go inside, it’s too cold here and if you want I’ll go down to the kitchens and ask the Elves to make you a mug with hot tea with two honey spoons.”
He looked up and saw just who he was looking for, twice. Both the Patil twins were in front of him. In their first year no one was able to distinguish one from another if they weren’t using their respective house uniforms, but as the years passed by, since they were in different houses and made different friends, they started to grow some differences in their facial expressions and it was easier if you were paying attention.
Only then did his fingers touch his cock, sending shivers up his spine. He stoked himself, up and down, repeatedly as he would usually do, unfortunately, he realized, it was not enough, not anymore. Draco Malfoy had spoiled him to the point where he was forced to sleep fully hard, as he was unable to cum with only the help of his hands and the thought of getting up to take a shower and washing the minty smell lingering around him away made him sick.
His only response was the closing of his eyes and the tightening of his heels around the other boy’s waist, pulling him in.
This morning they had had care for magical creatures with Hagrid, and the Hufflepuffs, where they simply stood by the lake and searched for the giant skid which— surprise, surprised— didn’t appear.
He would have noticed the blond hair the moment he entered the locker room if it was not hidden under the hood of his sweatshirt.
The raven haired boy ignored them and tried to catch the little flying ball, the words “kiss, kiss” giving him a migraine.
He looked at the image of Hogwarts. Hermione and Ginny were still in the Great Hall; Ron was heading towards the library—and that surprised Harry very much, but he didn’t really think much of it, Ron was probably just rememberers some homework due tomorrow that he hadn’t done—; Neville was, in fact, heading towards the lake; Luna was leaving the Ravenclaw tower and walking really, really slowly.
She thought for a bit, and remembered hearing the Patil twins gossiping about something along the same lines with Lavender. Was it Darry? Haco?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He needed to ask ‘Mione for help with his plan, because it was a bit complicated and he wasn’t entirely sure how to begin to put his mischievous plan in progress.
Another person entering the room made him stop mid-sentence. Hermione approached them, sat beside Ron and grinned widely while holding two letters for them to read.
After that, they stayed in their little bubble, Harry’s hips matching each thrust, both running toward the desired edge of sensations. They both wanted more, needed more.
As they started to pack their things, Harry remembered something and asked, “‘Mione, can you stay here? I need to ask you something.”
Then, as she looked to her other side, she noticed Luna and Ginny, giggling at each other. They were touching more than usual. Luna, for example, seemed more focused than on reality than is normal, while Ginny seemed a bit loony —actually, Hermione noticed, they both seemed to be glowing in a strangely good way.
She shook her head. He sighed and thanked her, telling her she could go enjoy the party with the others or go to the library or whatever.
Harry sighed, he missed Ginny sometimes, when he saw her with Luna, giggling and hugging and— to his surprise, since it was the first time he’d seen it— even kissing.
He blushed, feeling as if the gesture of being washed, even if with magic, by someone while you slept, was way more personal than what they had done—and what they’d do again, for sure.
He tried to ask him, through not so subtle gestures, what the fuck he thought he was doing. The only response he got was a wink and a sudden pull on his pants that, when he looked down, made him realize his zipper was fully open and was tugging at his underwear.
Draco Malfoy has just entered the Great Hall, right in front of Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Theodor something.
It had a price attached to it and the description of what it did. It was a patronum bracelet — a weird coloured one, in Harry’s opinion, a colour suppressed between gold and silver. A patronum bracelet, if Harry remembered correctly from previous Hermione lectures, was a bracelet that transformed itself into the wearers patronum.
When the tension thickened as none of them spoke another word, though the still bright red in Draco’s cheeks pleased Harry so much he smiled a little, receiving an odd look back.
After a few tries, he finally rolled his hips in just the right way, giving the blond the confirmation he needed to push forward, slow and carefully, allowing him to feel the pressure.
He followed them with his eyes and, without noticing, started glaring at the letters that formed Pansy’s name.
“Okay, Harry, think... think!!!” He yelled at himself in the mirror of the empty boy’s bathroom. He was not used to be the one to actually think of a plan, that normally was Hermione. But right now he was standing alone. What was he supposed to do? Where was he supposed to get a perfume?
Ron rolled his eyes and sighed, containing himself to not hit his head as hard as he could against the nearest wall.
He still hadn’t bought anything to wear and he certainly did not have a plus one to bring. He thought of all the options, all the girls in his year and none seemed right.
He had seen Ginny stare at the Quidditch captain’s arse —Angelina Jonson, who he now dated— and he knew his sister better than any of the other brothers, she started to share her secrets with him after the diary incident.
“For the last time, I didn’t call you FAT!” He yelled back, trying to intimidate her and only getting a wand pointed at his neck. He gulped. “I only said you should stop eating so much candy!”
He said the password—after getting an earful from the fat lady—and ran up the stairs, getting into his bed and closing the curtains around it, freezing for a moment for having no idea what to do next. Should he get undressed? Should he wait at the door? Was this a ruse for Malfoy to be able to make fun of him and black mail him? No, it couldn’t be, that was too complicated and evil, even for a Slytherin… right?
He shook his head out of his thoughts and did as she asked. Mounting his broom and flying to the goalposts.
I promise I'm already working on the next chapter and, if you want more smut, i promise it will be better (and if you have notes or something specific for me to add please tell me, tho I do have ideas so do not worry much)
He’d be a bloody fool if he ever considered letting her go— and thankfully when he got Harry off his back he’d have more time to worship her.
“Ron.” Hermione called, trying to calm her boyfriend down, with a reassuring hug and kiss in the cheek. “I’ve already explained this to Ginny.”
He was shoved back with such strength he almost fell and had some difficulty recovering his balance.
They left the Hall, but, to their surprise, the spot that had originally chosen was already occupied.
Ginny and Hermione looked suspiciously at each other as if asking what was going on and at Ron again.
She looked at the Slytherins watching them, trying to eavesdrop. She turned to the Lions once again.
Though he didn’t remember the specifics and details from his dream, he knew exactly what images had caused his hard-on.
They were both gonna pick Hermione,  Ginny and Luna at the Ravenclaw tower— who were all doing their make ups and hairs, probably — and they’d all go to the Ball as a group.
By the end of the meal he would notice his food was still on his plate, but now all he cared about was Malfoy’s lips closing around the spoon full of cereals and milk which he was eating.
Rip and throw a few papers in the lake —very bad for the planet and very idiot, since he could just use magic to burn them— and then fit ontem the probably very cold ground for almost two hours—head between his knees and the only movement of his body being the rising of his shoulder in tune with his breathing.
He rolled to his side and groaned. For some reason, his hand had made its way into his underwear and was holding his hard erection.
It created a distraction, like a noise of someone walking, so you could escape the snatchers. The cat turned around and looked for the source of the noise, hissing at nothing. He ran for his life once he heard Filch`s voice asking who was there until he was outside.
He betted it was Malfoy and his mother, Narcissa, since the blond would probably go back to Hogwarts to torment them.
First there was a hint of confusion, as the red haired boy frowned and his eyebrows almost touched; then, Harry saw, almost in slow motion, the blush of anger crawling its way from Ron’s collar bone to his face.
Maybe it wouldn’t be this awkward if he knew hat he was doing, unfortunately he didn’t. So, when Malfoy grabbed his wand from where it had been discarded on the floor, his reaction was to grab his and point it back, protecting himself.
He grabbed the hand with which Malfoy had been pointing in his direction threateningly and changed their positions, pressing the blond— who was a bit taller than him— against the wall.
It felt lonely, knowing Malfoy had left, but as he saw the note left on his pillow—reminding him of their agreement—it reminded him of it not being over yet.
‘Who the hell was that?’ He asked himself, turning around to look at his cheerful and joyful teammates to ask if they knew who that was.
Harry swallowed, trying to breathe normally. He knew what that was, he had seen it more than once while at the Dursley’s, when Dudley started watching sports even though he didn’t know the teams or players.
Knowing Seamus only woke up at a quarter past eight and being aware of the fact that his morning brain was still mush and wouldn’t be able to remember any silencing charms, Harry gave up.
When he finally found a compartment with one red head, a brown bushy one and a pink one, he entered— ‘wait... pink hair?’
Malfoy and Parkinson were now in the same bed and, even though he didn’t know why, he felt his stomach twist. Like he had ate something rotten at dinner when he hadn’t even eaten at all.
Ron shook his head out of his thoughts, he didn’t know about the future yet, but he knew that they HAD to be together first.
Since they had come back to Hogwarts they had more time to spend with each other without his brothers or parents bugging them all the time.
“Weaselett didn’t tell you?!” At that moment, Harry looked around and noticed the room full of half naked Slytherins —which, he didn’t know why, made him blush. He looked away.
What shocked them both more than Harry’s lips responding to this by moving as well, was wave that descended both of their bodies, making their movements become like a flame instead of the inicial spark.
Harry entered the pitch and heard a voice — which he assumed was Blaise Zabini’s, the new Hogwarts Quidditch’s commentator— saying:
And this specific dream had been more realistic, specially since that had gone all the way. Harry had given Draco permission to do to him whatever he pleased and both of them had surely enjoyed it.
“I did nothing! Your friend is the real bastard, he was the one who-“ the arm on his neck tightened.
“Leave me alone” Draco tried to push him off of him, failing completely and giving up, letting his head fall on Harry’s shoulder and continuing his sobbing. “I hate you” he’d whisper occasionally, though Harry just kept running his hand through the still wet hair and saying he knew, that he hated him too and nodding all along.
Hermione had confronted her boyfriend about it one day, during lunch, and the only answer she had been given was a nod toward the Slytherin table, where she spotted a familiar blond, stare glued to her table— one she knew all too well, one she was sure if said stare were to be followed would land on none other than the boy who lived. He was eating slower than one normally would, however it was easier for her to spot details that would be invisible to the untrained eye, such as the spoon he was using to provoke Harry with, tightly wrapped around his lips, which were slightly dripping with milk from his cereal.
He was going to mark him, so he remembered what they had done, whether they liked it or not. They might not be visible for the rest of the world to see, but as far as he was concerned, if Potter knew who owned him, nothing else mattered.
“Bloody hell” he whispered as he closed the books and grabbed his broom and Quidditch robes to go straight to the field as fast as he could.
“Found it.” Malfoy smirked, pushing against he had before, making him burst with pleasure, not knowing the difference between inhaling and exhaling, his breath being as uncontrolled as the yells coming from him.
The raven haired boy nodded and kept eating, but she was sure he didn’t get a thing of what she had explained.
Harry knew his friend, he knew those ‘oh-shit’ eyes, the eyes every Weasley had when Molly caught them doing something—like stealing a bloody flying car, for Merlin’s sake— and Harry was sure it all had to do with that comment Dean had made about Hermione’s birthday.
So this is what it felt like… he really didn’t understand what all the fuss was about, it was good, but he probably would have to wank after this to be able to cum.
He kissed her and followed the pug-faced girl while Hermione made her way towards Harry to distract him.
The next week was certainly interesting. Not only was it awkward to be around Harry, who seemed to be locked in some kind of daze which made him two times as oblivious and unfocused as he usually was, but Ron was acting oddly as well.
McGonagall had just opened the curtain, around that secret thing everyone was talking about in the Quidditch pitch, after Hermione accepting to help with the project.
The red nose and eyes were no surprise, since Blaise had affirmed he had cried earlier. The bloody hands, though, was something as unexpected as the fact that, as soon as his eyes focused on Harry, he seemed to regain the colour on his face and fell to his knees, shoulders falling forward and head following soon enough, hair hiding the tears.
He should have brought the cloak. But of course he forgot all about it. Now all the students will make fun of him and comment about what he is doing if they find out.
Of course he had to blush AT A MOMENT LIKE THIS! Control yourself, idiot! Now you must make a bloody damn move; you could’ve done more than kiss him at this point, dear Merlin.
This was her home. Even if she loved spending time with her parents, or at the burrow with the Weasleys and Harry, Hogwarts was the place that made her who she is today. Where she learned about magic, potions, herbology and about life in all the adventures with her friends.
Suddenly, the blond thrust forward and he lost his vision for a split of a second, his eyes rolling to the back of his head and his hands pulling at anything they could grasp. He heard someone moaning in the back of his head and his conscious part registered that it was him.
It was now the first day of the holidays and she'd lost an hour of her life listening to Harry complaining about the Slytherins — Zabini, Nott and Malfoy — making fun of him while he was in the Hospital Wing.
Fucking Draco Malfoy, with his fucking, little, pale, pointy, perfect nose with which he sneers and with which he also smells people and then tells them they stink.
He stood there awkwardly for almost a full minute, before he heard them whispering to each other and giggling—GIGGLING! Ginny Weasley didn’t GIGGLE!
He stood there looking at Harry with his jaw clenched and his Adam’s apple moving as if here were swallowing nothing.
But here they were and here he was, thinking of anything he could do to make Potter go mad with pleasure and ask him to stop while also begging for more. THAT would be a revenge worth planning. Whatever consequences were waiting for him, he didn’t care anymore.
He just leans his head against the other boy’s chest, arms around his torso, eyes closed, heart beating in his chest loudly.
That blond hair that stood out in any crowd was not gelled back as it had been in previous years; his pale skin was now so pale that instead of the natural glow it used to have, it was almost a lifeless blue; his eyes had dark shadows under them, but his stare was as strong as always; his clothes were still all black, but were not black formal suits anymore, now they were just black, informal, wizard clothes.
“What are you going to give Hermione for her birthday, Ron?” To which he just smiled and said it was a surprise.
He felt a blush crawling up his throat, just like Ron’s had, and rushed towards his clean clothes, trying to clean himself and only hearing chuckles from the others as his towel fell to the ground and his butt was exposed. He thanked Merlin for the fact that only his back was facing them.
Harry was really proud of his friend’s achievements. He was already preparing himself for the life he wanted.
“It said that, after the war, the problem will not be the difference between our blood, but the side you chose on the battle...” she explained, but trailed off as she noticed, at the table on the other side of the wall, a pair of silver orbs glaring at the back of Harry’s head.
Eyes still closed, he turned his face slightly to the left and a second later his mouth was open, allowing his tongue to do some sort of fight with Draco’s.
They both made it to the dance floor. He placed his hands on her waist and she placed hers around his neck l, looking down and blushing unusually hard.
“Yeah, that too. Your face looks like that time when Hermione used a spell on you so you wouldn't be recognised during—“
Harry stepped closer to him in a blink of an eye and grabbed Malfoy’s face with both of his hands, pulling him.
“We don’t. Yesterday, I went to their room while Hermione was in the bathroom to have a moment alone with my girlfriend and, well, now she’s my ex-girlfriend...” he said, holding his face with one hand while drinking his tea in one go.
They—from what he heard—were heading for the Lake to watch some seventh and eighth years who were there.
And, the more he thought about it, the more he realized the reason why this was sixth year all over again, just like Ron warned him.
This hadn’t happened to him since he was fourteen or fifteen fit Merlin’s sake! But all it took was to imagine Potter’s — and he would immediately —ugh, how frustrating!
Harry's clothes vanished with hardly a blink from the dark-haired boy, and a twitch of finger was enough to stretch the blonde teenager, and fill him with a cool slickness. Harry was already rock hard, and in no mood to wait - he pressed his cock against the other boy's entrance, and slowly, inexorably, pressed himself inside.
The crumpled figure groaned, and slowly dragged himself to his hands and knees, blinking the blood out of one of his eyes.
Harry scolded himself internally as the fist connected. For such a wiry almost-man, Tom had a decent punch on him, Harry'd give him that. He'd have to get his jaw looked at once he got back to the safehouse, or he might lose a tooth to that one.
The audience muttered to themselves. Not quite the screaming vengeance he expected, but this was probably better. Not to mention, seeding doubt was always quite good fun. He turned back to Voldemort, who, in hindsight, he probably shouldn't have looked away from for quite so long. Just because the Crucio didn't work, didn't mean that the man didn't have other weapons up his sleeve. Specifically his fist, which was rocketing directly at Harry's cheekbone.
"None of you are to speak, or to interact with either he, or I, during the demonstration - today you will bear witness to the Light's ultimate downfall at my hand alone!" His eyes glittered at the shocked murmurs going travelling around the hall. The statement wasn't technically true, he'd had quite a considerable amount of assistance in reaching this stage, but he didn't care particularly. He waved a hand airily, and two of the physically larger Death Eaters - probably Crabbe and Goyle, although he paid little attention to his stupider and weaker followers - dragged the limp body of a slim teen with scruffy dark hair. He was wearing only a ripped t-shirt and trousers, and there were bruises and blood, both underneath the rips of the shirt, and on the boy's face - it appeared a wound had opened in his temple, bleeding down his face and dripping slowly from his cheek.
It impacted Harry directly in the chest. His flared nostrils, and a frown, were the only sign Harry gave of feeling any kind of impact.
was the stuff of legend. His signature spell, his favourite. Magical theorists had estimated that Voldemort could push a level of power into that spell unmatched by any other wizard in history. And yet, Potter had brushed it off as if it was the flutter of a butterfly's wing.
"The ritual went perfectly!" Unlike this conversation. Honestly, Voldemort was somewhat nonplussed. He was expecting defiance, but he wasn't expecting quite this attitude. His whole plan to dismantle the boy's defiance, and make him bow and scrape before the

?' If nothing else, though, Harry had seen the looks some of the followers had given, specifically at the front of His High Noselessness' robes. They were too voluminous to actually give an answer, but he'd successfully spread a little doubt about where Voldie was getting his kicks these days. Good. Time to spread some more.
"Good boy." Harry crooned, and the kneeling Dark Lord's look of devotion was so absolute, that you could almost believe he was Harry's pet.
, who has kindly volunteered himself to help me with my demonstration of my vast and ever increasing power." Voldemort declared, looking around the echoing chamber at the sea of bone-masked faces, his minions kneeling before him.
, before he granted the boy a well-deserved death, was looking more and more remote. "There was nothing wrong with the potion, nor the ingredients! I am restored to my full existence, just as the ritual intended!"
A moment later, Draco came around the corner, and Harry's breath caught in his throat. Draco was slim to the point of delicacy, like spun glass, and moved with an elfin elegance. His silver-blonde hair hung delicately in front of one eye, and his lips were upturned in a loving smile. Naked but for a silver collar around his neck, with Harry's mark of the stylised lightning-bolt motif on the front, and the small metal chastity cage around his genitals, he padded softly towards his Lord, enjoying the feel of the soft shag-pile carpet under his bare feet. The house was a pleasant temperature, and he enjoyed surprising his Lord and partner. It had been a few days since he had been able to break himself away from the business of ruling.
He gritted his teeth and exerted a touch of mental force on the curse, after a moment of focus, flicking it back the way it came.
The Dark Lord had hoped he could intimidate Potter into obedience without having to do this, but so be it. "
The crowd gasped once more, as some sort of array of colours seemed to drain from the older man. He remained stoic and in position, as his very essence drained into Harry - every scrap of magic Voldemort ever had, draining away like bathwater down a plughole.
Slowly, one by one, other voices joined in, until eventually the whole room was a cacophony of noise. Each person bowed so low their faces almost touched the floor, each pledging him their devotion and submission.
"Do you still have a cock? I mean, that'd explain why you're so mad all the time, you know, just pent up and all that..."
At least, in the eyes of most of his followers. With a howl, one wild-eyed witch broke free from the crowd, charging at the dark-haired boy who was forcing her beloved lord into such humiliating acts.
Harry laughed. "He'd have to start with himself, then. I present to you, Tom Riddle Junior, aka Lord Voldemort, aka You Know Who, aka Darth Arsewipe, son of the muggle Thomas Riddle Senior, grandson of the equally muggle Thomas Riddle Senior Senior." Harry scrunched up his face, as he often did when he thought about Voldie's rather murky gene-pool. "Also scion of the
Harry slung his cloak onto a chair, and toed his shoes off, kicking them untidily into a corner. Dobby didn't appear to tidy them away, knowing how much the
"Harry Potter..." the Dark Lord intoned, his eyes flickering with ill-concealed glee. "How good of you to join us once more amongst the living... for the time being, at least." His followers chuckled obediently. How dull. He'd had to punish them for not enjoying his humour more richly, once this was done.
"It was all you, you know." Harry whispered into Draco's ear. "You were the one who got the other Slytherins on side after my re-sorting into Slytherin last year, you helped Hermione find the rituals I used in the Black and Malfoy libraries, you helped me dispose of Dumbledore after he decided I'd turned dark. Not that he was wrong." He gently bit his boyfriend on the neck, and smiled at the blonde boy's blissful moan. "You even concocted the plan for the Knights to supposedly betray me and hand me over to him. You will always be the first of my court, the leader of my Knights, and my beloved."
