“Oh, no. Only you. The others usually have the common sense to leave once they realize who did they just sleep with,” chuckled Harry, placing a little kiss on the top of Draco’s head.
“I still might,” said Draco, tying the bandages at the base of Harry’s wrist and realizing it’s done. Harry’s warm breath was still dancing around Draco’s neck, his hair tickling his cheek and he really didn’t want it to end. He touched those soft, curls, letting his hand stay a bit longer than needed on Harry’s neck. “I’m done.”
“So Luna… a baby, eh?” he started out of nowhere but he knew Luna did not feel the need for small talk.
“What’s this?” asked Draco, looking confused at the piece of paper.
Another long pause fell between them as they looked into the fire, remembering all the things they’ve done to each other all those years back.
“Even Goyle?”
Dominic Greggs was a spaghetti noodle of a person and he looked like he might break at any sudden gust of wind. He nodded towards the three of them, sending him a concerned look.
trying to kill each other. Draco wasn’t a good person back then, there’s no question about that. But he was a teenager. A grossly misguided, terrified teenager.
Harry was locking his classroom door when his phone buzzed and a photo from Draco appeared on the screen.
“Is Harry… is he always like this with people?”
“Stop being so… nice and comfortable,” he looked at Harry with confusion in his eyes. “Last night sure, I could understand that. We were both drunk but now? How can you just sit there and talk to me and tell me that I look good in your sweater after all that I’ve done to you?”
Harry thought.
“Thank you, Harry,” he whispered so quietly that the sound of the sea almost overpowered it. His slim hand was so cold against Harry’s.
He sat in the chair listening to the water in the kettle boiling and looking at the witch brewing his tea. Her long, grey hair was braided and put in a high bun with a couple of hair pins sticking out of them. He was pretty sure one of those pins was her wand. She was dressed in classic, wizard garb which usually would look ridiculous in the Muggle side of London but somehow fit perfectly into the shop. Her long robe was very dark plum with a blue spiral pattern going from the back and weaving itself around her.
“Do you often have those
“I guess… we grew up?” sighed Harry, stabbing the stew with his spoon. “Ron and Hermione got married, they’re staring a family. It’s more of a duo plus one now than a trio. Can we change the subject?.”
“Did I?” he asked, taking the pale, long hand of the man into his and placing the glass full of gin into it. “Because I thought you looked rather appetizing, too.”
“I panicked, alright?” admitted Harry, trying to hide his face in his hand.
Meeting Harry made him realize just how much he missed normal human interactions and he began to think. He has nobody in London. At least nobody that was willing to reconnect after his time in Azkaban. That’s why he was drunk in a club by himself that cold night in the beginning of March. That’s why he went to a stranger’s house with little to no thought. And that’s why he stayed even after he knew who the stranger was. Loneliness was the worst thing that had ever happened to him and he clung to his company, however pathetic that sounded.
already up, sir?” she asked, turning towards the stove again.
A heavy moment of silence fell between them. Draco leaned forward, elbows on his knees.
Draco looked down at what he was wearing. It was just dark jeans with a thin, tight dark shirt. It wasn’t anything special but he haven’t grasped the muggle fashion yet.
*** Friday, March 10
“Or tomorrow? Whenever suits you,” murmured Harry, feeling like the warmth of sleep calling him again.
He vaguely felt it when Harry pulled him lightly towards the bathroom door, sitting him on the toilet and turning on the water in the shower.
. The contents started swirling around, blending into a smooth lilac mixture. Draco smiled over his success and charmed a glass straw to put into the drink that he held out toward Harry.
He hit send before a group of fifth-year students walked passed him, gossiping loudly between each other going towards the dinning hall, making him suddenly aware of how hungry he was.
Under his long, black apron Draco was wearing the red jumper he got from Harry the first night he stayed over and he looked just
He kissed her hand and her cheek and turned around towards Harry.
The magic of the door tugged on him just like the last time but the strong hand holding his pulled him through and into a dark garden. The crunch of gravel under their feet announced their arrival. They hasted through the garden, finally reaching the back door and entering the warmth of the interior. They started kicking off their wet, muddy shoes and unbuttoning their coats even before the door slammed shut behind them. The moment the door closed behind them Harry was pressing Draco to the wall next to it, his hand on Draco’s face, his thumb caressing Draco’s lover lip.
“Sir?,” screeched Tommley opening the door. In her bony arms she was holding a small silver tray. “We found your wand and glasses in the kitchen. Are you alight?”
sound announced that the door is ready to be used and he lost his train of thought.
They were walking down the street to the Black Snitch, the only magical club in London with decent music. Hermione handed him a vial of Polyjuice Potion and he chugged it quickly without even noticing the taste. It wasn’t exactly legal to brew the potion but it wasn’t strictly
“Mrs. Brimm… you know that I don’t believe the cards.”
“What?” asked Draco, taking the invitation and curling up next to his warm body. Harry’s thumb started to caress his shoulder almost immediately but he didn’t say a word. He just leaned in for another kiss.
Harry attached his prosthetic, clenching the stiff, plastic hand a couple of times to try it out. It wasn’t anything fancy – just a usual Muggle prosthetic with some charms Luna came up with, helping with adhesion and movement. Harry still disliked the unnatural weight, or lack thereof, of it and how it sometimes got stuck in weird positions.
“What a gentleman,” Harry smirked but walked through the door and into his back garden. The small space was only lit up by the faint light coming from the house. The wet feeling in the air started to turn into actual rain and the first heavy droplets fell on his face when he looked up. He walked a couple of steps along the gravelled path and turned around to see the stranger struggle to go through the door.
“Well, it’s hard to say.”
“Since when are you so grown up about everything?” Malfoy asked, playing with his glass between his dainty hands. “The Potter I know would rather punch everyone in the face rather than talk.”
“Sorry for accidentally stabbing you.”
“Can we just stay like that for a minute?”
He washed off most of the blood from Harry’s clothes by hand before he remembered that he was indeed a wizard and used
And he kept quiet.
The ceremony, if you can even call it that, was short. Draco and Narcissa said their quiet goodbyes over an open casket where Lucius lied motionless and cold. Draco held his mother’s hand when two dark-robbed wizards took the casket away, pushing the metal cart through the back door with a loud clacking noise following them. After they took Malfoy senior away Narcissa slumped onto the closest chair and started sobbing quietly, being hugged by her son tightly.
“It’s alright, sir,” said Draco, looking back at Harry, his mother on his arm. “Harry is a friend.”
“Thank you, Potter. Thank you so much,” Draco said quietly.
Draco looked at him with a puzzled look in his grey eyes when a waitress walked over to their table and placed two menus on the table. She was in this weird age gap between 30 and 50 when women just look
“I can pay for myself,” said Draco, putting his wallet away but he was really grateful for the free meal.
“I think you’d rather not know,” whispered the stranger back, pulling Harry closer to place a small kiss right on his jawline. “I think you wouldn’t be so… willing if you knew.”
Draco nodded slowly and touched the hand still clutching his shoulder and it felt
“I… um. I’ll get the one down the corridor then,” Draco said detaching his eyes from the softly sculpted body in front of him. “Sorry if I woke you up.”
“Yeah, turns out it doesn’t work like that. But we got all the leftover Death Eaters.”
“See you later,” said Harry, trying very hard to stay awake.
“Hurting. Meaning it’s still there,” answered Harry trying to put his glasses on. With just the tips of his fingers being available to him it was a pitiful to see.
The café was cosy and small so it didn’t take Draco long to notice him. And when he did that shy smile creeped its way onto his face. He wiggled his way through the room, gracefully dancing between the tables and sat down in front of Harry.
Right.
“Oh you know. Dark. Depressing. Gloomy. I saw my father. Once.”
“Are you sure?”
“I don’t tell lies, you know?” Harry said after an uncomfortable amount of silence. The man cleared his throat. “Well… Right. You got me there. You are him. I- ehm- I think I’ll be leaving now,” and he started to get up. He avoided eye contact and started stumbling towards the front door.
you?” asked Draco, now more terrified than confused. Harry laughed and cocked his head up to look at the man. He was looking straight at him. God, those eyes were pretty.
Draco stayed quiet after the door clicked behind Harry, focusing on the fuzzy bathroom matt underneath his feet.
He stayed for a while with Ron and Hermione after they got married and it felt good. Like the good old days. But one evening they sat him down and very gently told him he has to find his own place to live. So he did find his own place.
And now she was helping him here.
“And here are your stews, lovelies. Enjoy. Let me know if you need anything else,” interrupted Agnes, placing two huge bowls of steaming stew between them.
“You killed Voldemort with it,” whispered Draco.
“Well,” Harry said, letting his head swing back behind the armrest of the chair. It was easier to talk about it when he didn’t have to look someone in the eyes. “I didn’t faint. I actually kind of… died?”
“Her state? Are you alright, Luns?” worried Harry.
“Good morning, sir,” said Tommley stopping the pancake making to bow. Harry never got used to it but he stopped trying them to stop after the first year. “Is your
The backroom was a strange mix between Muggle and magical. The potion station, kept away from the eyes of the shop’s Muggle customers, stood in the back surrounded by cabinets full of actually magical ingredients, nicely labelled and stored in glass jars. Next to them stood a table with an old microwave and an even older kettle. Mrs. Brimm pointed to one of the chairs and Harry sat down politely thanking her.
“Good morning, Pipps,” said Harry, sitting down in one of the chairs. Pipps stopped and bowed, because of course she did.
Harry was still not looking at him.
He pointed at the jar and said
And then the paparazzi found that place.
Harry looked down. Through the curtain of silvery hair he could barely see Draco’s face in the light given by the fire. He reached and touched his cheek, running his thumb over it.
“No, everything is ready, no worries,” said Harry, taking off the apron. He was wearing a plain white shirt underneath, extenuating his tan skin. He pulled the chair back for Draco. “Would you like a drink?”
“Um… no problem. I should’ve given it back sooner,” said Harry, swaying a bit under the weight of Draco’s body and the amount of alcohol in his bloodstream. He pushed him away a little bit, breaking the hug and looked into Draco’s face. He was greeted with a huge smile and very wet, drunken eyes hidden again behind the unruly hair. He couldn’t help himself and tucked the strand’s behind Draco’s ear. Fuck, if he just hadn’t asked questions…
“Oh, alright then. Thank you.” She bowed and walked away, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts.
He walked through Harry’s garden door with an anxious feeling in his stomach and a box of strawberries. He wasn’t prepared to see Weasley, not to even mention Hermione. He had a feeling they wouldn’t be as welcoming and cordial as Harry was. He was certain that there would be some nastiness present, he just wasn’t sure how much.  The pull of the magic door was less than what he had expected but it was still harder to make that one step than any other step he has taken. He could see Harry standing at the top of the stairs leading to his backdoor and waving at him.
“I had no idea,” admitted Harry. “Well, have a good afternoon, Draco.”
“From Azkaban? Last month.” He took a long sip, starring into the fire. The warm orange light framed his thin face and made his hair look like pure gold. “Did eight years out of my ten and they decided I was good to go.”
“Evening, Harry,” smiled Draco as Harry sat down. “Sorry to force you to leave the house is such shit weather again.”
“Is this how you always treat your
“Lack of an arm. Yes,” Harry filled in the sentence, biting on a small smile that creeped onto his mouth. He
“Alright,” agreed Harry, pouring himself a glass of white wine. He sat down next to Draco, extending his legs under Draco’s chair.
“I can’t really get my thoughts straight,” he said weakly, leaning onto Draco’s shoulder again.
“So… what do Muggles see when they look at it?”
“Sure, I can figure something out. Magical side or the muggle side though?” asked Harry.
“Oh…” said Harry, eyes wide in shock. He started stumbling for words, the alcohol not helping. “I’m sorry. I didn’t forget. I just didn’t realize… I’m sorry.”
“So what you’re saying is that there is a chance,” teased Harry.
“Captain.” She nodded and send him a shy smile at their little inside joke.
“Harry?”
“Sure. Do you already know where?”
“Don’t mention it.” She grabbed him by the elbow, slowing them down a little and putting a bit more distance between them and the other group. “So why are we helping the Malfoys?” she whispered.
“Alright big man,” whispered Harry, patting his shin. “At least get under the blankets. It get’s awfully cold when the fire goes out in the morning.”
“Draco, it’s been years since the war. Tormenting yourself is not going to help anyone, believe me. I tired,” Harry said softly, reaching to Draco’s shoulder, covered in the familiar fabric of his jumper and warm to the touch. “You were a scared teenager trying to survive a war.”
“Well, turns out I’m pretty good at both. What are you doing?”
“Don’t you have a comb?” asked Draco, taking Harry’s umbrella into his hand and walking towards the door.
“Like an hour ago? I don’t know. I was still in class when the kids started talking. Where are you going?”
“Yeah, that’s not gonna work, Draco,” Harry laughed when Draco tried to put his hair in order. “But thanks for trying.”
“Do you want to leave?”
Draco sat Harry in one of the armchairs in Harry’s bedroom next to the table where Pipps left the disinfectant and fresh, sterile bandages. Draco crouched in front of Harry, noticing that he already had his eyes closed and hand extended.
“Oh it was great. We went to Hogwarts to see some of our friends from the kitchens. Winky is sending her greetings.”
to have someone to just talk to. He was left alone to deal with the aftermath of his teenage choices. His friends, at least those that were speared the prison, cut him off completely. His own mother abandoned him in this mess that she and his father created for him. He was alone and this show of basic human decency made him feel like bursting in tears.
“Oh fuck no,” said Draco, slightly laughing into his beer.
Harry patted him on the shoulder and pushed him lightly towards the living room. He handed him his glass and started to pour some rum for himself when he heard Malfoy laugh.
“Did you sleep well?” asked Harry in that soft, warm morning voice of his. Draco knew he was lost at this point.
They stayed like this for a while, the rhythm of seconds passing by them marked by the clock was interrupted only by their quiet breathing and the chirps of the birds outside. The morning bliss found them again. Draco decided to enjoy it while it lasted, his heart beating like crazy in his chest.
Hermione ran into him and pushed him towards the dancefloor, taking his place next to Luna. He joined the rest of the group and danced between other half-drunk, sweaty people, not having a care in this world. George, already after a few deeper drinks, started singing “Weasley is our king” with the rest of the Weasley boys and Harry accompanied them with a
That day she came back at her normal hour, dressed in full uniform with a newspaper under her arm. She looked exhausted but happy. Keeping her mouth shut she handed him the newspaper. It was the Prophet. The front page covered in a moving picture of shackled, flailing Greyback with the title “THAT’S ALL, BOYS” in huge letters above the picture. Lower, a smaller photo of Astoria, smiling and proud in the bright flashes of the reporters.
Harry looked at his buzzing phone and smiled.
“Captain, thank you for coming.”
“Mhm?”
“It’s fine. I just… I just need to sit down,” said Harry, slumping down onto the floor. Draco grabbed a kitchen towel and squatted next to him, afraid to even touch him now. He looked at the palm laying on Harry’s leg. Through his clenched fingers the trickle of blood was gushing hard, spilling over the trousers and the floor. He pressed the kitchen towel into it, wrapping it twice and tying a knot on top, pressing hard to stop the bleeding. That would buy him some time to think. He raked his brain for something useful.
“A little help would be appreciated here,” muttered Harry, chuckling and looking at him from behind the dark, messy curls that fell over his face. Even with just the dim light of the dying fireplace Draco could see how intensely green they are. He reached down and wiggled free from his trousers, leaving nothing on him and started undoing Harry’s belt.
“Sure. I’m not working today anyway,” Harry lied. He had heaps of work to go through before the end of the day. “Do you know where you’d like to go?”
“Sure. So what are you doing?”
Wednesday, March 15th
Harry looked inside the store through the stained glass window. He could see a couple of patrons still looking around the shelves, Draco standing next to them, pointing at something. He looked so happy confident explaining something to the clients, a perfect picture of customer service.
“I’ll be sure to use my Golden Boy privileges then,” smiled Harry, secretly hating that nickname. “Do you have today’s Prophet maybe? Mine was stolen by those fucking papzz in front of my house.”
“Morning, Pipps,” chimed Draco, from the bed.
“No. Are you sure you want to leave this way. There are always at least four or five idiots trying to snap a pic in front of the house.” He put his hand in his back pockets and lowered his head, looking at his feet. “I can let you use the floo. Or you can apparate from the attic. And there’s still the garden door…”
“WOAH! WOAH! STOP!” the man shrieked, rising his hands up and falling backwards onto the wet pavement. “WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU DON’T JUST POINT A WAND IN SOMEONE’S FACE!”
He looked at the man in question who was throwing everything out of the drawers just to find something. Maybe “mature” was not the best descriptor of Harry but it was close enough. He placed the glass on his chest and closed his eyes, feeling warm and cosy for a second.
“How are you… just talking about it? He tried to kill me once and it just stuck with me… I still have nightmares about it,” he whispered, unknowingly touching his Dark Mark.
sound behind the door he put the collar of his jacket over his face, trying to hide it from the wind and rain, and turned around, looking at the old building in front of him.
Harry stood still while Draco was buttoning up his coat. He also fixed his scarf, his slim fingers brushing against Harry’s face. He had to admit that he enjoyed this slight touch a bit too much. Way too much.
It wasn’t much different from any other house in the street. Three stories in red brick, framed in white corner trims with a small garden in the back. The magical real estate agent said it doesn’t really matter how it looks from the outside since the inside is going to be custom made to suit his needs but he liked how normal it looked.
“Sounds good. Are they treating you well?”
“You look like you’re stressed, love.”
He rushed back to his classroom, to the door leading him back to his house, to London. To Draco.
“Yeah. Everything is fine. Sorry to wake you up,” said Malfoy, quietly. Harry could tell that he regretted making the call already.
Harry handed him a glass of white wine and they continued their dinner. They chatted about school, about the new quidditch season starting, Draco’s job and a case that Harry is helping with on the side. The bottle of wine was quickly devoured and changed for rum.
“Yeah… but he’s still your father. I’m sorry you had to see that,” he took his hand off. “You know, Hermione is trying to ban the Kiss.”
He followed the mourning family out of the crematorium. Narcissa’s hands were now clutching a small wooden urn – all that was left of their father and husband.
“And how is that freedom treating you?”
“No worries, you didn’t,” said Harry, stretching his shoulders out and yawning. He ruffled his hair and fixed the glasses on his nose. Draco just noticed that his hair was wet, like he had just left the shower. “I’ve been awake for quite some time. Do you want some coffee?”
Harry turned around and put his hand on Draco’s waist, bringing him closer. Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body against his and hell, he wanted more.
“That’s even better. So… around one, then?”
“Oh, no. Thanks. I actually enjoy being sober from time to time,” said Draco, sitting down, surprised by the act.
” he said, cleaning up the visible reminders of the cut.
“Are you sure you’re Harry Potter?” asked Draco, looking at him, faking concern
“Would you like the breakfast to be served in here, sir?” asked Tommley with just a sliver of judgement. Harry looked at Draco then back at Tommley and back at Draco. He just shrugged his shoulders in the silent version of “I don’t know?”.
“I- I need to prepare a funeral. And contact my mother. She can’t learn from a newspaper.”
“Close your eyes,” said Harry, hiding whatever it was behind his back. So Draco let his eyelids slide close again and held out his hand, expecting the worst. But he felt something smooth and light and… warm?
“One moment!” said Draco, finishing explaining the properties of sage and mint herbal brews to his clients.
“I still have a working thumb so that’s helpful.” He tried to laugh at the whole situation but it was clear he wasn’t happy about loosing his one working hand. He tried to cast a few sparks from his wand, just to check if it’s going to work but the single spark that did appear was dim and small.
“Oh yeah? Who are you to have the papzz follow you around?” whispered Harry next to the strangers ear. He could feel a strand of hair tickling his cheek while his hand found its way to the stranger’s lap, his thumb caressing the inside on the stranger’s thigh.
“First of all, rude. Second of all, what am I not getting?” asked Harry, again.
“I told you already, you were defending yourself,” argued Draco, propping himself on his elbow to better see Harry’s face but he refused to lock eyes with him. Draco cupped his chin and turned his face towards him. “Look at me. I literally tried to kill you. Please, stop apologising to me for defending yourself. It’s really fucked up.”
“I was hoping you’d propose something to be honest,” he chuckled. Harry might’ve felt very happy because of that sound if he wasn’t so goddamned tired.
On Friday evening Draco was giddy with excitement. They agreed to meet at Harry’s for dinner and drinks and talk, nothing extravagant. But Draco was so excited for that sliver of human interaction he could barely stand as his shift neared to its end. It was almost 6pm, the usual time to finish but there were still costumers in the shop, looking around.
“Other than the… arm, are you alright?”
“You should see a healer about it. I don’t really know any healing charms apart from
“I hope she has friends,” says Luna in her traditional, absent voice, looking right over Harry’s shoulder at the group of their friends.
“Stop that,” mumbled Draco putting down his cutlery.
“You were supposed to  call her, Draco.”
“If you could.” Even though his voice was barely a whisper, it broke hallway through the short sentence.
“Harry.”
“Don’t get too sad or you’ll ruin the mood.”
“See you later, Harry,” said Draco’s voice, muffled by the loud sound of files being flown to Harry’s study room.
. Thick liquid opal droplets started to fall on the bottom of the glass and he counted them in his thoughts.
“Don’t joke like that,” said Draco firmly and shook his head at him.
doesn’t like you.” Harry was already climbing the stairs when Draco joined him.
“See you, Harry.”
The hot water of the shower felt great on his skin making it pink. After years of the cold and damp of Azkaban he really appreciated the scolding hot coming from the showerhead. He loved how it made his body tingle, his muscles relax and his head light. It was just the best thing.
George came in next, messing up Harry’s already messy hair. Angelina gave him a little smile from behind her husband.
He opened his eyes and there in his hand it was.
But now he was tucked into a soft bed. The body of Harry sleeping next to him, his arm still enveloping him tightly. And he kept quiet again but it was a different type of quiet.
Draco became aware very quickly of how effective his personal charm was. As a child he could get everything by just putting a sweet face and  the older he got the more familiar he got with it. By the time he was 14 he knew he was considered handsome by most of the girls and later he noticed that the boys weren’t indifferent either. He wasn’t bashful about it but he knew that he was easy on the eyes.
“You heard it, Pipps? Do we have some gin in the bar?”
“Honestly, it’s pretty shit but I’m not going to complain,” said Draco, rising his glass to Harry’s as if to toast. “To the papzz.”
After a minute or two Draco walked through the door, closing it shut behind him and smiling at him widely. Harry got up from his seat, all his confidence gone out of the window, dreading the next minutes and hating himself for being the bearer of bad news.
“No need to thank me, Draco. But I’m here. In case you would want to talk. Whenever you’d like to.”
“I know. He only served like what? 8 years?” said Neville, looking over Harry’s shoulder to find the answer to his question. “They say it was of natural causes.”
“Evening, Harry,” said Draco, handing him the box of chocolate-covered strawberries. “Sorry it’s not much. I wasn’t sure what to bring.”
“My Draco?”
“Hello,” he said, hanging his dripping coat on the back of his chair. “Sorry to make you leave your house in such a nasty weather.”
A couple of hours later, Hermione had to chime in when George started levitating Ron above their heads and the security guy kept glancing at them way too often. Ginny and Luna left a while ago with Bill and Percy abandoning Harry left with two, very happy couples. George and Angelina couldn’t be separated from each other even for a second. Even Hermione had nothing against Ron’s public displays of affection. Harry on the other hand was a bit overwhelmed with the sudden feeling of being lonely in the middle of a crowded dancefloor.
“You too, Harry,” he shook Harry’s hand and handed over the useless umbrella. “I’ll see you around.”
“Um… alright,” said Draco, quieter than he intended but Harry was already downstairs, talking with the Elves. Draco touched his shoulder where he could still feel the touch left by Harry.
He kissed Draco’s neck and pushed them away from the wall, making their way up the stairs and towards his bedroom, the old wooden floors creaking under their rushed steps.
“Take your time,” said Draco sitting in one on the armchairs and placing the bottle on a tiny table next to it. He poured himself another glass of liquor and got comfortable in the wide chair, letting his head and legs swing over the armrests. Only now did he notice a pair of doors on both sides of the fireplace.
He learnt how to go about his life without magic. He learnt how to cook and wash dishes. How to do laundry. How to use the underground. Even something as easy as locking the door and switching the lights on. It wasn’t hard, just… bothersome. Different. But he couldn’t complain. He was free. And alive.
“Hey,” he heard in his ear and felt someone’s hands on his hips. “Do you need someone to dance with, handsome?”
“Always a pleasure, Malfoy,” Harry smirked taking Draco’s hand into his.
“Yeah, whatever you gave me works great,” he said, scooting closer to Draco. “God, I hate blood.”
“Shit, sorry. It’s a reflex.”
“What is wrong with you, Draco?” he whispered to himself and headed to the bathroom door trying not to think too much about how
Harry thought about how well Draco looks in that damned sweater. And those dark jeans. And his hair, freshly washed and still a bit damp but looking soft and silky. It was tucked over both of his ears but the right side started to slowly fall down. Harry sensed it would be crossing a line if he reached over and fixed it back to its place.
Draco looked at the handsome man laying next to him and kicked himself inside for fucking up so bad. He turned off the old lamp on the bedside table, got up from the bed and moved towards the door, understanding that the
,” laughed Harry swirling the alcohol in the glass. “They should be here before you close, don’t worry.”
“When did it come out?” asked Harry, hiding the paper in his robes and getting up.
“Yeah… he was… yeah,” said Harry, giving a deep nod and laughing under his breath. “So… what about that scar?” asked Harry, getting up to get another drink. ”Is it from Azkaban?”
Harry moved between the shelves, looking mindlessly around just to kill some time and calm himself down when a short, stout woman stood in front of him. He assumed this must’ve been Mrs. Brimm.
“I swear that thing is getting greyer each year, Bill,” said Harry, pulling on the braid. “Where’s Fleur?”
The walls were covered in a deep green wallpaper with a pattern of vines and birds. They didn’t move like many of the wizard wallpapers but it was still quite charming.
He shook his head, trying to focus on something else and took one of the blankets from the drawers. He threw it over Draco who curled under it and seemed to fall asleep instantly.
“Nothing happened. I always have classes on Friday.”
“Did you hear about Malfoy?” Neville asked, sipping on some wine. Harry’s eyebrows rose, surprised that Neville, out of everyone possible, heard about Draco first.
He made sure to shut the door behind him and walked into the street, making sure that his face is still covered. He should’ve put a masking spell but it’s too late for that now. His hand was getting cold from the ever-present mist in the air at this time of the year and Harry put it deeper into the pocket of his jacket.
“That would be appreciated. With tea, if you could.”
“Um… alright. You cooked?” asked Draco changing the subject.
“Yeah, I noticed,” smiled Draco. “Try not to think about it too much.”
In the small room of the apothecary his quiet whispers of consolation mixed with the loud cries of grief.
“Good morning, Sir. I hope you slept well.”
Neville’s face looked somehow even more confused when he put down his fork and asked “You’re going to the Azkaban after work?”
“Never liked him that much.”
“Thanks for checking it anyways. I owe you one.” He put the file inside his robes, planning to give it to Draco after the ceremony if he wants it.
to use it and if Hermione is cool with it, so is he.
“He died today,” Neville said, bringing a piece of the fish to his mouth.
He was led out of the room and into the door across the corridor where he was met with a slightly smaller and slightly less colourful version of Harry’s bedroom. The wallpaper looked the same but the vines were more muted, like it changed from a summer day in Harry’s room to an autumn evening in the guest bedroom.
That is until Ginny broke up with him.
Harry looked at the man from above his glass of whiskey. He was handsome, simple as that. Tall and lean but not skinny. Definitely built well enough to make Harry’s mind wonder what is he hiding under that white dress shirt. His hair was still a bit wet, dark as the night outside, sticking to his pale face and almost hiding those grey eyes, peering straight at him, waiting for an answer. He had a long, curved scar over his right cheek, nicking the corner of his mouth. The hand holding the glass of gin has never seen a day of physical work. He still looked vaguely familiar.
“Thanks mate,” he said. “You might want to brace yourself,” he added quietly. Harry looked at him confused but braced himself he did.
“So… open? Hopeful?”
“Well… yeah. Pretty much,” said Harry, sending Draco an encouraging smile. “You should do the same. And if you let me, I’ll continue to assume you’ve changed.”
“Do you know what you’ll be ordering, lovelies?” asked the waitress while putting down their drinks.
“You are the last person that should apologise to me,” whispered Malfoy, sipping on his rum but he patted Harry hand and let himself linger a little longer there.
Harry’s brain tried to figure out if he knows that man but the familiar
“Then talk about something else.”
“You should stay on the boat, mother. I’ll bring him out.” he said calmly, knowing full well she’s not going to listen.
“That’s… that’s great.”
“Rosemary?” asked Harry, rising an eyebrow.
We got a tip that Greyback was in the nearby woods, hidden in a cave system. The tip didn’t mention 9 other werewolves. And so we were ambushed. We took out five of them but we lost 3 of ours. We were outnumbered with the only escape rout narrow enough for just one man to fit through. I told Ron and the rest to get the hell out of there when things were heating up and that piece of shit lunged at me, teeth and all.
“Can you let me leave? I don’t think we are going to continue… that thing.”
He hoped his face was not too red for the kids to notice. But they looked too busy chatting among themselves. He walked quickly towards the teacher’s table, catching bits and pieces of the whispered conversations.
“… my parents said he was his right hand man,” whispered Hugo Inglebee, the class clown who was somehow also the class smartest guy. He turned around, just in time to catch Harry looking at him. The boy looked away quickly.
“I am Draco Malfoy.”
“Alright, yes. If you’d like to, of course.”
“I’ll get you some camomile with peppermint. Do you take honey?”
“You wouldn’t be. I’m not really socialising much these days, you know?” Harry looked back at him, with that self-assured, crooked smile.
They finished their breakfast in relative silence. Harry didn’t want to impose anything onto Draco but as the breakfast time passed and they were walking down the sunny garden path towards the blue, wooden door he passed Draco a small piece of paper.
“I’m all yours, Draco,” whispered Harry back.
He put the robe on, walking slowly towards the bed. Draco was still deep asleep, his face calm and relaxed under the cascade of that silky, light hair. Harry smiled lightly, feeling how his heart started to beat faster in his chest. He liked this feeling and refused to feel bad about it.
“Are we getting wasted today, Harry? I have this Muggle hungover remedy I really want to try out.”
in Bulgaria,” said Ginny, “but gobracks are too dangerous for Luna to wrangle her in her delicate state.”
Draco moved through the garden, gravel crunching under his shoes. Harry was right, it was cold. The wind hasn’t stopped its hard work to blow half of London away and Draco could feel the promise of snow in the smell of the air and the colour of the clouds. At least no more rain.
Neville showed him the folded newspaper. A moving picture of Lucious Malfoy in his prison garb covered most of it. It was taken just after the arrest so he still looked proud, his head high, looking straight into the camera.
“Ginny! Luna! Oh my god!” he said louder than expected, pulling them both into a one-armed hug. “I thought you were in Bulgaria looking for gobracks!”
“I… well, I was thinking about the evening? Around 9?” answered Draco.
“What?” he asked.
“Fuuuuck, right. I forgot. That must be annoying,” commented Harry who now felt a bit dumb floating that bottle back and forth.
“Lucious Malfoy died today,” said Neville slowly, checking I each word entered Harry’s brain properly.
“Luna is pregnant, you bum. We’re going to have a baby!” said Ginny, her brown eyes gleaming with happiness.
“Some scars here and there. And I take wolfsbane everyday.”
“Sure. That sounds alright.”
This one was warm.
“Show me one rule that says I wasn’t allowed to!” exclaimed Harry, bumping his hip into Draco’s, sending a soapy bowl from his hands back into the water in the sink.
“Are you?”
“What’s so funny?” he asked , sitting down in the armchair next to the guest.
“Come in,” said Harry, taking a deep breath and getting up. “That would be all for the morning bliss.”
, he thought, knocking angrily three times on the door and waiting for the familiar sound.
“See you, Harry.”
“Hm?”
“I know I have it somewhere, just give me a moment,” said Harry, throwing stuff out of the desk standing between the windows.
Through the door entered what seemed to be a herd of mostly ginger heads in various states of wetness.
charm. Was it obnoxious? Yes. Did Ron deserve it? Also, yes.
“Ok, let’s get shitfaced! In my little brother’s name!” yelled George, hanging one of his long arms over Harry’s shoulders as they walked into the club.
in the meantime,” said Tommley and with a loud, sharp crack in the air she was gone.
“I invited you in and insisted you stay. Relax, Draco. The war is over. We can share a breakfast without trying to murder each other,” Harry said, patting him twice on the shoulder on his way to the staircase. “Get downstairs when you’re finished.”
“I’m taking an apprenticeship at a potion’s lab, actually not too far from here. Court appointed. The owner didn’t really have much to say but she’s alright. Wants to know everything about everyone but she’s sweet. And very strict. At the end of the day she only wants the work to be done and I’m good at what I’m doing.”
“Oh. My god. Harry. Stop it.”
The day continued without any other hiccups. Draco helped Harry to dress up, trying to remain professional against Harry’s hardest efforts. They took their lunch and afternoon tea in the garden, enjoying the first rays of sunshine in a very long time.
“Draco,” gasped Harry in a fake shock, finishing up his lunch. “I didn’t know you are into this kind of thing.”
“A magic Police Officer, and yes. I was, until a year ago.”
Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, closing his reddened eyes. He reached for Harry’s hand and intertwined their fingers without the previous shyness or uncertainty.
“No. I’ll just grab a shower and leave,” said quickly Draco, trying to move past him in the narrow corridor without touching him.
He extended his hand out to Harry.
“Are the Weasleys here already?” asked Draco quietly, stopping mid-step as he was following Harry deeper into the house, towards the kitchen.
“Oh, I slept great,” replied Draco.
“What happened?” he asked, his voice quiet and shaking almost as much as his hands did, holding the paper. Harry reached out to touch him, hoping it would calm him down but he moved his hand away.
Draco looked at him from below his eyebrows. Those grey eyes should’ve been enough to recognize him now that Harry thinks about it.
It looked like the beginning of a great night.
, he asked himself. He didn’t deserve this dinner. It was too nice. It felt too warm, too safe, too good.
“You’re doing just great,” said Draco, continuing to unwrap the bandages. Only once before had he seen the bandaging spell at work and at that time he was too scared to focus on what was happening and appreciate the complexity of it. It was crude, sure, but he was sure the spell saved many limbs through the ages.
Comfortable in Harry’s embrace he felt like he was drifting away back into the hazy warmth of sleep when a knock on the door shook him right out of it. Harry groaned sitting up.
His handsome face was beaming.
“Um… no, thank you. I’m just waiting for Draco to finish.”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
When they got to the bedroom Harry was in no space to joke around though. He took a glimpse at his blood-stained shirt and lost all the colour that managed to come back to his face already. Draco sat him on the soft bed and started to unbutton his shirt. Harry’s breath was again shallow and his eyes kept rolling.
“Welcome home, sir,” screeched the taller one, Tommley. She was wearing an ankle-length, brown dress with a white collar and dark, woollen socks. Her ears were long enough to touch her elbows and were ornated with a couple of golden rings. Harry had to admit that she was the classiest Elf he has ever seen. “Would you like the dinner to be served? It’s duck tonight.”
And then he saw him.
Bill and Percy were in the front, greeting him with wide smiles. Bill’s long braid swung behind him when he jostled through the crowd to envelop him in one of his signature bear hugs.
“It’s been a while. I got used to it. Magic is helpful though.”
“I like the confident you,” he whispered into Draco’s ear before he bit his neck. A slight sigh left Draco’s mouth before he could stop himself. Harry chuckled, kissing his forehead. “Get some more sleep, Draco. I’ve got to go.”
At the bar they ordered an arrangement of shots, drinks, and cocktails except for Luna who just ordered a tea and sat at the bar, enjoying one of her favourite activities – people watching. Harry stayed behind at the bar with her while the others took over the dancefloor, cramming themselves between the already dancing people. The group changed into a flailing mass of hands and legs and red hair and he couldn’t stop laughing. It felt great to see them again. He missed the warm feeling of fitting in.
The bed looked the same though. Invitingly soft. So Draco did the only thing he wanted to do now and swung himself over the bed. His head was spinning so he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, breathing in the smell of clean laundry.
Draco looked at Harry who sat next to him with his back straight, dressed in a dark suit and a traveling robe. His hair looked put together, the defined shiny curls framing his serious face. Draco almost didn’t recognise him when he appeared next to them in the back garden, ready to go through the blue door. He looked so professional and almost cold, without his usual warm smile on his face. The white flashes of cameras around them felt like stones being hurled at them and for a second Draco thought of just running away. But the green eyes stabilized him, grounded him in reality.
“What? Flying?”
“I promise you, you will not regret it,” said Harry walking in and going straight to his desk.
Draco nodded, bringing Harry’s tan, warm hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles lightly. His mind drifted away.
“Really. I took up enough of your time already,” said Draco, heading to the other end of the corridor and not looking back.
“Malfoy?” asked Harry still not certain if it’s maybe, just maybe, a drunken dream.
“They pay me good enough to go by with a bit of change left over. Honestly thinking about getting roommates to afford the flat,” he chuckled but it was a sad chuckle. “But I can’t complain. I should be happy to even have work. With my name it’s a… complicated matter.”
“And how did you become the captain?” asked Draco, now staring into the huge gash on Harry’s hand. It looked rather morbid, the whole thing drenched in old, dry blood. Draco put a trashcan under it and started pouring the disinfectant, the red dripping over the edge of the palm and into the papers in the bin.
A soft, silent cry left his mouth and shook his body as he felt first tears rolling down his face. He covered his mouth as not to wake up Harry but he could feel the other man’s arm tightening around him.
Draco nodded, his head moving lower and lower again, hiding his face behind the wall of silvery hair.
Draco fell face first into the pillow with a smile, feeling all warm and soft. And wanted.
“I’m not uncomfortable,” said Harry, sitting up straight, smiling wide as if taking up a challenge. He looked him in the eyes. “And yes, it is a date. If you’re up for it.”
“I’m sorry,” said Draco, holding his spoon motionless halfway between his mouth and the bowl. He couldn’t believe the way Harry talked about it. Like it was nothing. Like it was something that happened in a story, a long time ago and not actually to him.
The light hair, previously so well put together, was now in a state of dishevelment over those grey, warm eyes. The shirt leaving nothing to imagination clung to Draco’s body like wet cloth.
Ron in a dark-green jean jacket with a party hat on his head and Hermione under his arm was surrounded by the mostly ginger gaggle of happy, loud people. He waved at him and Harry jumped off the barstool, threw a sickle into the waiting hand of Tom and crossed the bar to meet his friends.
“Thank you, Agnes,” said Harry sending her his signature Golden Boy smile.
“It’s going to be fine, Harry,” he said, his voice almost stable. “Just don’t look,” he felt Harry’s head resting on his shoulder, his eyes hidden in the crook of Draco’s neck.
*** Friday, March 17
to just talk. He was surprised Harry was so… mature and chill about it. A therapist? What the fuck is a therapist?
Friday, March 3
“I don’t think he expected Snape to die but I know for sure he was aware of that possibility. He was fine with me dying too. It is pure luck that I’m still here.”
“Draco,” she said, coldly. “What is it that you’re wearing? You look like a muggle.”
“Harry!” Neville waved at him, patting the chair next to him. He wasn’t hard to notice being the tallest and youngest of the teachers. He has already started his dinner. Salmon with baked carrots and fresh greens.
“What
“Good morning,” he said after Draco had picked up after a bit of a wait. Clearly he expected Harry to just text him back. “Sorry to call. It’s just annoying to type when I’m trying to eat breakfast.”
“Damn, she definitely wasn’t wrong,” laughed Harry. “I’m sorry. This is not how I planned this evening.”
He didn’t say anything. Just laid there beside him running his thumb over Draco’s face, drying away the tears that just wouldn’t stop falling.
“I am not sure? I don’t know my way around Muggle London yet. I was hoping you’d suggest something,” Draco said sheepishly although Harry would’ve never thought of him as a shy person.
They laid in silence for while. Draco kept counting Harry’s breaths and noticed they were going back to normal when he felt a small touch on his shoulder. He looked at the man next to him.
“I just wanted to make sure there was no foul play involved.”
The silence that fell over them felt heavy. They avoided looking at each other and focused solely on the breakfast and their thoughts.
“Thank you, Harry,” said Luna, doing that thing every pregnant person does where she put her hand over her belly, as if protecting it. “She’s going to be a strong little one.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I really am but… don’t you have friends?”
“No. It looks like an actual heart attack. No foul play. I had our coroner check it.” She passed him a thin file. “Here’s everything. Nothing out of the ordinary.”
“Good morning,” said Harry, quietly. So that’s how he sounded in the mornings. Low and gruff but still with that joking tone. Through Draco’s mind ran a thought of “I could get used to this.”
They caught up with the Malfoys in front of a pair of thick metal doors leading towards the crematorium. Mrs. Malfoy and Draco were already past the threshold when Greggs stood between them and Harry with Astoria. Astoria backed away immediately, sitting on the chairs lined under the walls.
Draco smiled. It felt like a dream except Draco’s dreams right now were full of darkness and screams and memories stained with Azkaban. Except for those nights spent at Harry’s. For the first time in years he slept through the night without a major case of nightmares.
“Would you believe me that I actually do?” Harry answered, getting greeted by a wall of rain behind the door. “You’ve got to be kidding me. How long can it rain like that?”
“Two House Elves?” asked the stranger with a smidgen of judgement as they sat down with their dinks of choice in front of the fireplace. Pipps left the room to look after the roasted duck that is not going to be eaten tonight. “Who did I bump into at the Black Snitch, eh? You’re not an heir to the Sacred Twenty-Eight, are you?”
“No,” whispered Draco, almost too quiet to hear him over the running water. He played with Harry’s hand, not really knowing what his fingers were doing.
They drank rum and chatted about work and life until the dancefloor in the room behind the bar started to fill up. Harry suddenly got up from their place around the bar and looked at him with those lovely, green eyes.
“I don’t want you to get bored of me,” joked Draco, making Harry roll his eyes back.
“Stop being ridiculous. You’re not Draco. His hair was like… platinum blond. And he’s in Azkaban.”
“How’s your hand?” he asked after a few quiet sips, his long fingers curled around the thin porcelain as if trying to take all the heat from it.
“You can use my Floo if you want.” he assured Draco and pushed his tea towards him. “I think you need this more than me now.”
“Oh we were.”
Harry took the plate of orange slices and walked in to the dining room here Pipps was putting out the napkins.
“That’s very good, very good. You stay here, dear. I’ll go get him for you.”
“So responsible of you,” smirked Draco, looking him up and down. “At least I get to see you in the robes again.”
“Why not both?” Harry looked at Draco in the reflection with a smile.
Harry kneeled above him, just letting things happen, enjoying the view of Draco’s head right next to his zipper. He touched the pale hair, fixing it behind his ear like he did so many times already and it felt right. It felt nice. And he couldn’t ask for more.
“You don’t remember?”
He almost slept with Draco fucking Malfoy.
“Hey,” he said, feeling the curls of Harry’s hair touching his face. “Do you need someone to dance with, handsome?”
“It’s me, Tommley. No worries,” Harry yelled from behind the man when the Elf didn’t seem to want the random guy to enter the house. Tommley looked at the stranger for a second and opened the door wide. It wasn’t the first time Harry brought home company but the House Elves have never stopped silently judging his dates.
“Anything can happen, Harry,” Draco teased back. “See you at the bar.”
, he thought.
Finally, the clock chimed in, announcing to everyone that the store is closing and they should move towards the door. He sold the aloe vera ointment to the older lady and started mopping the floors when he saw the shined, black shoes of the owner standing in front of him.
“Em… let me just…” Harry mumbled and pointed his wand at the stains on the stranger’s trousers. A gust of warm air went through the man’s clothes and left them dry and clean.
“Yeah, but a straw is not a jar, is it?”
Draco touched his face and looked at him confused as he handed Harry his glass.
“Yikes. What happened to the Golden Trio?”
“My wand?” he asked, rising up from the armchair, spilling the rum all over the chair, the floor and the rug.
“Got it. And for you?” she looked at Harry.
Harry smiled at his phone and quickly looked around the corridor, in case any students paid any attention to him. He quickly typed out the response.
and it doesn’t look like it would be good enough.”
“Yes, he is, Tommley. And I’d greatly appreciate it if you were nice to him,” said Harry, biting through the orange. It felt like a blessing after the sandpaper that seemed to fill his mouth.
“Ok, no problem. I’ll take care of it. Hey, Draco,” Harry moved closer to him, placing the blond head on his shoulder and embracing him as tight as he could, gently swaying left and right. He could feel the first sobs building up, ready to explode. “You’ll be alright.”
He moved his fingers up, towards Harry’s neck where another thin scar marked another fight. The scruff of his unshaved jaw left warm tingles on the tips of Draco’s fingers. He trailed it down, towards the sleepy lips, parted lightly in a sleepy daze. He put his thumb against them, touching the soft skin and jumping slightly when they moved, leaving the tiniest of kisses on the tip of his finger.
Anther moment of silence fell over them but this time a more comfortable one. It felt good to be able to talk about it without the need to be
It took Harry anther three hours to finally go through the essays. He wrote some notes on how to go over some of the most pressing issues and let a long, heavy sigh as he stood up from his chair. No work was going to be done here anymore. He tapped with his wand the pile of the notes he had made and they disappeared, transferring to his desk at Hogwarts. He still left a copy of them in his personal study, just in case.
“Having dinner.”
“Well, I don’t know if you can call it cooking. But I cut up some things and boiled some potatoes?” said Harry, showing him to the dining room where the table was set in light, casual tableware with a raclette grill in the middle.
“Not the circumstances I would’ve hoped to hear that sentence in,” said Harry, trying to get up but his legs had a different idea.
Harry Potter left his house through the back door, away from the paparazzi stationed in front of the building. He crossed his small back garden and knocked three times on the heavy blue wooden door propped against the brick wall in the back. As he waited for the familiar
“Oh my god.” Draco hid his face in his hands, laughing. Harry laughed with him. He felt the touch of Harry’s bandages over his hands, pushing them away from his face.
The war has been over for seven years but it never felt like it was for him. Three years after the War the magical side of the Great Britain seemed to move past the tragic history. Funerals gave way to weddings. People started to trust their neighbours again, the use of guarding charms fell drastically and everything seemed to go back to normal. Shacklebolt as the new Minister of Magic did a great job of de-corrupting the ministry, creating new departments in hopes that the next generations will never have to go through war ever again.
He left them alone, together in the small study, grieving over their loss. A bit later he sent in Pipps to serve them dinner while Tommley prepared the guest bedroom for Narcissa.
“Sir?” a knock made them jump. Harry moved away, his warmth disappearing quickly from Draco’s skin. “The healer is here,” screeched Tommley from behind the door.
Contrary to popular belief Harry wasn’t stupid, he was fully aware that he liked Draco. Hell, he was very aware of how
“Um, sure. I’ll go for the beef stew, please” said Draco, handing back his menu to Agnes.
“Damn, how much did you drink, mate?” he asked, walking back to the door and catching the stranger’s shoulder as he was just about to plop face down on the path.
After leaving the Grimmauld Place 12 he couch surfed from friend to friend and it was alright for a while. The Weasleys were always happy to see him.
“By last name? Are we back at school?” asked Harry.
They stumbled out into the cold, putting their coats on clumsily and  their hoods up, trying to save the fleeting warmth of the club underneath the fabric. Harry began to walk away backwards, giving Draco the most wicked of his smiles. Draco jogged to catch up with him and slipped his hand into Harry’s. They walked into a small alleyway just around the corner from the club and found a door far enough form the lights of the street for them to use as a portal back to Harry’s.
“You owe me a drink, Potter,” said Ron, sliding Hermione, George, Angelina and Bill a sickle each. “I believed in you.”
Fucking papzz. Can’t even have one night without them fucking shit up.
“Didn’t I bump into you at Weasley’s birthday party?”
“It’s so sudden. I barely got out and he… I thought I still had time.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” asked Harry clearly unsure what to do.
Harry closed his eyes and turned his face towards the sun. It was still very cold and Draco could see each deep breath coming from that crooked, thin nose. He was holding both cups of tea, letting Harry sip from his whenever he turned his face towards it. It worked most of the time. Draco kept having to dry Harry’s coat the other times.
He finished his tea quarter to two and walked down the stairs with the cup in his hand. The kitchen was empty so he just put it in the sink and moved towards the back door. He put on his trusty woollen coat and grabbed an umbrella. He disliked using it since it took up his one and only hand but he would look out of place walking around Muggle London without it in this weather.
“Um… sure. My boss read Tarot for me, or more like… at me? She paints her own decks. Beautiful works, by the way. Anyway, she said something thrilling is going to happen to me today.”
“Ouch. Would you believe me if I said that even Slytherins don’t want to be seen around a someone convicted of war crimes?”
“Mr. Malfoy, I’ll close the shop today,” she said firmly, trying to take the mop out of his hands.
“Well… alright then,” replied Draco, unsure. He was already in debt with Potter and he wasn’t really keen on getting deeper into it. On the other hand, the sweater was nice. Nicer than anything he could afford right now.
“What? Oh no, definitely not.”
Draco shook off the water from his coat and looked around, scanning the room for Harry. He didn’t know why but he felt a bit self-conscious about their meeting. It seemed like they just weren’t able to have a normal date. Always something had to come up. The dinner was nice, sure, but of course he had to mess it up big time. Even though Harry said it was a date Draco felt like the accidental stabbing kind off broke the mood. But this? This is planned. This is premeditated. This came from him. This is definitely a date.
“Yours,” answered Harry, not even noticing the mess. “You can have it back.”
Draco was glad Harry proposed going there with him. He was fine with the side looks and stern faces from the fellow witches and wizards on the daily basis but going back to this wretched place only weeks after he left… it felt suffocating. The situation got even worse when his mother insisted on joining him. Draco would’ve been concerned about her if it was just the two of them but Harry’s presence definitely took most of the attention away from them, especially with the paparazzi waiting for them in the port.
“I can’t understand why you wouldn’t want this sweater back.”
“Oh, definitely. Have you ever seen her failing at something?”
Harry turned around, looking for a spare door that he could use. He bit his lip trying to hide the smile creeping onto his face. It’s just dinner. Just dinner. Nothing more. They’re just both lonely. They’ll just talk. And that’s it. Just. Dinner.
“In the back of McDonalds?” he asked unsure.
He decided to keep Tommley as far away from the Malfoys as possible.
“I’m not quite sure. My friend made it for me and she’s a clever witch. Come on, let’s go inside. It’s pretty nasty out here” proposed Harry after pulling the man onto his feet, straightening the jacket on him and shutting the door behind them. They stumbled in silence down the pathway to the backdoor of the house.
“Can you count then? Count to ten and back.”
“Great,” he run back to the bed, placing a small kiss to Draco’s lips and ruffling his hair. “See you later then.”
“Why is everyone so surprised by that?”
Draco put the paper down and away from him, picture facing the table. Harry took it as a sign to hide it back into his jacket. While he was doing that he heard Draco’s quiet voice.
“Oh come on. Don’t be like that,” exclaimed Harry but he laughed. “I guess I can see it, though. With all that pink. How is that tea of yours?” he asked, changing the subject.
Harry could swear his heart stopped for a second. He looked at his phone, checking if he just imagined the messages he received in the last 10 minutes but no. They were there. They are having a date at six.
was now over and he should just leave when he heard him murmuring.
“It’s ok, Draco,” he felt Harry’s quiet whisper touching the back of his neck. Harry’s hand was intertwined with his, close to Draco’s chest. “Do you… do you want to talk about it?”
And that was a scary feeling to just roam around his chest.
“I have some news, Draco,” said Harry, motioning towards the chair. “Can you sit down?”
“Harry. You lost an arm. It’s not fine.”
Draco finished taking the shirt off to the sound of Harry counting to ten and back and again. His breathing got more stable with each pass.
“Ah, right. Yes, I’m fine. Thank you for your concern, Tommley.”
Alright then.
Two sweaters, one burgundy and one cream sitting on a well-made bed with light-blue bedsheets. The message under the picture read
He blinked heavily and very carefully turned around. Harry was still asleep, his messy hair cascading over his peaceful face in a wave of shiny curls. With the bright light of the morning behind him he looked like a sleeping god. Draco breathed in slowly, enjoying the moment. The weight of the arm over his, the calmness of his expression. The chest poking from underneath the blanket, light scars of various shapes and sizes standing out on the darker skin. Draco felt a need to touch one of them, the one shaped like a star, right under his collarbone. Harry’s skin was warm under his touch, the scar lower than the skin around it like it covered a deep hole. He wondered what kind of spell could that have been.
“Thank you, Draco,” he said quietly and drank the whole thing in one go. After taking a sip Draco noticed a hint of honey and mint in the tea and he wondered weather Harry made it himself or asked the Elves to do it. He hoped he didn’t wake up the Elves to do it. They disliked him as it was. Draco drank most of glass before putting it on the tray and moving it on to the bedside table.
“Some gin would be great but I’m not picky,” answered the man following him past the stairs and to the right, into the living room.
“The Black Fog has decent drinks. The music is pretty good, too. It’s a bit far out from the city centre so you can stay over if you want.”
“I think she doesn’t like me,” Draco said after he could no longer hear the little steps on the corridor.
His mother never cared for Voldemort’s ideas. All she ever wanted was for her family to survive, to succeed, to prosper, no matter the means. She was loyal to her husband, not the madman that took over the wizarding Britain a decade ago. But she still believed in those wicked ideologies of blood superiority and separation of muggles and wizards.
Harry pushed himself away and for a moment there Draco was certain he had second thoughts. But then he saw the wicked look Harry was giving him, the way he was undressing him with just his eyes and his cheeky smile. Draco leaned in to kiss Harry’s again, his hand touching the hot skin underneath the now open shirt. Harry was so glad he went for it at the club. Felling Draco’s slender hands finding their way around his body made him even more sure.
Draco nodded slightly and he felt a light push towards the soft bedsheets. The moment he felt the bed shift under his weight he realised how exhausted he was. He closed his eyes, breathing in slowly the warm smell of Harry still lingering on the sheets. He felt Harry’s body coiling around his tightly, his heavy arm surrounding him and bringing him closer. Safe again.
Harry had to admit that even though he felt sorry for Draco and could maybe emphasise with Narcissa, he wasn’t sad that Lucius had died. Out of the Malfoys it was Lucius who actually followed Voldemort, disregarding the basic human decency or even the safety of his own family. Harry went to too many funerals and too many memorials to those lost to the war caused by the actions of Malfoy and his comrades to feel bad about his death now.
“Then stay. But can you be honest with me for a second?”
“I wanted to ask you to dinner. I don’t know why I got them involved. I tried to invite them but they already had other plans. Sorry.”
“I would love to but actually, I should go. Duty calls, you know.” said Draco, reaching for his wand and deactivating Harry’s
At the entrance they were greeted by the head guard and captain Greengrass from his old division.
“Yes way!”
“Well, I can’t blame them. They were just trying to make sure that my other arm kept being attached to the rest of my body. I didn’t actually do any desk duty anyway.”
“That’s actually working,” said Harry after a while. Draco could feel his lips moving against his neck. Harry’s face was less tense now but still visibly paler than normal, only centimetres from Draco’s. They sat there for a moment, Draco’s left hand trailing through the soft mess of Harry’s hair, the right one holding Harry’s injured hand high to lessen the bleeding.
“Or, and here me out, we could not do that? How does that sound?” asked Harry, not opening his eyes but leaning in for a sip. Draco obliged, holding the cup to his lips and tilting it until it was empty. No drying spells needed this time.
“That’s rough.”
“I got your coat, sir. And the coat of the guest, too. There was a commotion at the Black Snitch, that’s why it took so long. I do apologise for that.”
“Yeah, no kidding. I’m trying not to think too much about him. He fucked me up
“Yeah, just don’t tell her that,” laughed Harry. “I miss it.”
“Do you really not want this sweater back?” asked Draco, not looking up from his food.
When he left the bathroom, his skin red and prickling from the heat of the shower, Harry was standing right next to the door, leaning on the wall, clearly waiting. Draco reached over to him, his head finding its place back on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco didn’t answer. He was still staring at the picture, not reading the text surrounding it. Harry reached again, squeezing his hand hard. “Draco?”
They walked for a couple of minutes until they stopped under an awning painted in dark blue and green stripes with the name “Brimm’s Apothecary”. The shop’s windows were made of stained glass, showing the process of distillation. It looked very out of place.
“Mr. Malfoy, the cards have told me something thrilling is ahead of you today. And I don’t think they meant the floors. Go.”
. Over the last couple of years he didn’t let himself to have anything
“How are you feeling?”
“How good you look,” Harry answered, truthfully. The consternation on Draco’s face was confusing. He remembered Draco as someone who was pretty certain about their looks.
“I am… uh… well. Draco wanted to meet,” said Harry, picking up the cup. The smell of mint was dancing on his senses.
It took Draco a second to decode the message behind those words and when he did he closed the distance between them, connecting their lips. Harry’s hand landed on Draco’s cheek, pulling him closer. They shared the kiss, slow and happy and blushed and in the moment. Not carrying about the past nor the future. And it felt right.
“Sure, Draco. Whatever you want,” he sighed and kissed his forehead. They laid in silence for a while, enjoying the quiet crackle of the fire and the sound of their breaths together. Harry was slowly drifting away.
“With milk, please.”
Luna was glad to leave to him her crazy little hut in the woods of Scotland while she travelled the world. But then she got married and Harry felt it was his time to leave.
He swallowed the pills in silence, looking out of the window at the pouring rain. This part of the year filled him with the worst feelings. Mostly thanks to the almost constant lack of sun and the cold moisture seeping through his flesh and bones. He hated being cold.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake. How thick re you? It’s called hair dye and I
Draco smiled walking past him to pour some tea for both of them.
to float the half empty bottle of rum across the room and pour himself another glass of the drink.
“How was your day off?” asked Harry while she was folding the papers away on his desk.
He opened his eyes and was not prepared to what he saw.
“I’m not against it,” said Harry, smiling lightly but his face was tired.
. “Malfoy is in Azkaban.”
He put the new clothes on, the heat of his skin amplifying the soft feeling of the sweater hugging his body from all sides. He hoped Harry would let him keep this one too.
at Draco when he pushed the man over the bed. And he was a phenomenon to behold.
“I’ll get you something for that soon,” Draco assured him as he started to get the bloodied jeans off of Harry’s legs.
“Hi, I’m Agnes. May I get you two something to drink?” she asked in a thick, northern accent as she opened her little notepad.
Harry couldn’t form a coherent sentence. His thoughts were solely with Draco, wondering if he already knows. He just asked him out on a
“What?” he shook his head, as if his brain just froze. “Oh yeah, here,” he handed the little metal plaque to the Elf.
“What the actual fuck, Potter,” he whispered. “You actually died?”
Draco couldn’t keep the eye contact. He did feel guilty. He felt guilty for what he has done. For surviving when so many haven’t. For getting out of prison without finishing his sentence. For enjoying life, as crappy as it is. For cutting Harry’s hand even if it was an accident. Even for taking up Harry’s time. He looked down into his tea, steam rising from the hot liquid.
“Take a nap, Draco,” Harry whispered back straight into his ear placing a small, quick kiss into Draco’s hair. “You’ve had a long day.”
He got interrupted by Draco throwing his arms around him and pulling him into a tight, drunken hug. At first, he was not sure what to do with his arm but soon it quickly found it’s place on the small of Draco’s back. Harry was a good two inches shorter than Draco and his head fit perfectly in the little nook between Draco’s neck and shoulder which he had to note, felt quite nice.
“I will try to get the blood off the clothes. You try not to die,” he whispered as he went back towards the on-suit.
‘Well, short version is that Greyback took it. Long version is… well,” he paused, looking around the room. It was definitely too busy to just talk openly about this kind of stuff. He carefully took out his want from the inside pocket of his coat and cast a
“Yeah. Life happens” Harry answered, shaking his hand. He liked Greggs but he was a long winded guy if given a chance so he turned to Greengrass.
“At yours then?”
Harry cocked his head slightly and shivered. Fuck, the guy was
“I’m glad nothing serious came of it,” Draco said in a quiet monotone, his thumb trailing inside of Harry’s palm absentmindedly.
“Can’t be mad at the Golden Boy,” teased Tom, giving him a toothless smile.
It was slightly before 9pm when Draco arrived and the Black Fog was booming with people when he walked though the heavy black door. It didn’t look like a club. The interior was illuminated by heavy chandeliers hanging from raw wooden beams with the bar in the middle like an island surrounded by mostly full tables and booths. The walls were covered in random pictures of people and the guests were invited to add more to the collection by a big banner above the bar.
“Oh shut up,” Draco answered back, elbowing Harry in the arm. Harry laughed, lightly kicking the other man under the bar. “But thanks.”
“Well, then let me get some for you,” said Harry, finishing his drink in one swift motion and hailing the barman again. Draco in the meantime made sure to leave their coats in the cloakroom and he really hoped tonight will be different than the first one.
“Fiiiiiine,” groaned Harry but he got up from the bench and walked inside behind Draco. They passed Tommley cleaning in the main corridor and Harry asked to take the cups from Draco, which she did but Draco was again the subject of her deadly stare.
“Oh yes, perfectly,” assured Harry and watched how the wave of anxiety exits the little figure. She was wearing a baby blue dress that Tommley made for her last year and a pair of yellow socks she got for Christmas from the Weasleys. He smiled at her as she went back to the kitchen to help Tommley with the pancakes.
Draco looked at him confused.
This time it was Pipps who walked in holding a silver tray full of fruits, yogurts, milk, and muesli and levitating another one behind her with a teapot and two teacups. She put the tray on the small table between the armchairs and left the tray with the tea on the desk, first pushing some of the papers away.
“Hello Harry, hope life is treating you well,” said Percy with his stoic mannerism.
“It’s alright. I don’t want to be a bother.”
Harry smiled and looked around again. He tried not to be too obviously happy or the fifteen year olds would notice and spread some wild rumors.
“What are you smiling at?” asked Draco, hiding behind the piece of laminated paper.
“I was honestly so surprised that you became an Auror, mister fuck-the-rules.”
“I would love to kiss you right now.”
“Well… If it was genuine then I- I guess… thank you, Harry. You look great, too,” Harry caught another smile from Draco before Agnes came back with the drinks and a fresh page in her notepad.
“I’ll just finish my drink!” yelled Draco behind him but there was no way that Harry could hear him. The music coming from the dancefloor was enveloping every inch of the place as Harry disappeared into the crowd of dancing bodies.
Since then it’s been over a year. Harry still on sick leave and then working at Hogwarts, Astoria in the field being his eyes. He was there when she got her captain stripes after they’ve caught the rest of Greyback’s gang, working around the restraints of bureaucracy.
He waved at Agnes and she started to rush over to them as if she’s just remembered she had another table right there. Draco took out his wallet, fiddling with the Muggle money, not really sure about how much he should pay.
“I’ll just light it up again,” said Draco, clenching his wand to his chest with that innocent smile of a drunken college girl.
“Yeah. I need to… eh… I need to go, Neville. See you tomorrow.”
Draco wrapped his arms around the strong figure, his fingers digging hard into Harry’s shirt and for a moment, he thought that Harry felt like safety. His soft murmurs soothed the pain and calmed the storm raging inside of him.
reached his ears and he opened the door. He popped his head through, checking out where it would lead him. It wasn’t a very precise spell but it usually put him in a short walking distance to wherever he wanted to go. This time it got it almost perfectly and he walked out of an EMPLOYEES ONLY door in the back of a McDonalds that has just opened around the corner from the Leaky Cauldron couple of months ago. The dead-end alley was illuminated by an old lamp that tried really, really hard but it was way too dim to put a dent in the darkness around him.
“I’m fine. I’m just… I thought I would see him again, you know.”
Draco smiled and shook his head, grateful at Harry’s easy way of moving past that topic.
“You’ll need to get up a bit,” he said as he sat next to Harry. He helped him sit up and held his arm as he downed the opalising liquid and laid down again, closing his eyes and turning to his side. His soft curls fell on his face but Draco could see that the colour was coming back very slowly. His breathing was deeper and calmer too.
He passed the door to the other bedroom, listening for any signs of life. All he could hear is a grunt and some rustling proving that Harry was indeed alive. He passed the length of the corridor between him and the, supposedly, bathroom door quickly and as silently as the old wooden floor allowed him to. He turned the doorknob and was disappointed when it turned out to be an airing closet, because of course it was.
He turned away and started walking towards the heavy, green door.
“Is it true about Snape? That it was all Dumbledore’s plan?” asked Draco.
“Draco, calm down. It’s not your fault,” he said, looking up at Draco with absent eyes. His face was ash, almost ghost white and it was clear he was in a lot of pain.
Astoria was surprised to see him like this. Laughing through tears with the newspaper tucked firmly against his chest he didn’t look like her hot-headed, boss. She felt out of place, like she shouldn’t be seeing this. Her colleagues sometimes joked about how emotional their boss was, especially when the higherups forbid him from doing something but they’ve never seen him like this.
And then he felt his hand being lightly enveloped in the warmth of Harry’s palm. He looked back at Harry and this time their eyes met, together with a soft, encouraging smile on Harry’s face.
“At mine’s,” Harry said, opening the door to show his little garden and lights in the windows of his house. “You coming?”
“Since when are you so nice to the House Elves?” asked Harry, curiously.
The Merchant was just a small, family owned café, nothing extraordinary but nice and cosy and not too busy all the time. He took the empty table by the front window and starred out of it. People were running  from one place to another in haste, trying hopelessly to stay dry. Some poor soul waiting for a bus at the stop got splashed by a car rushing past and defeated, didn’t even move further away from the street.
“Yes?”
The barman brought Harry his drink and they clanked their glasses together. Harry gave him a side look from above his drink, swirling the contents.
“They say it was heart attack. Do you want me to check it?”
Their eyes met and Harry sent him a warm, calm smile.
“Can I walk you to work?” Harry asked with a shy smile, getting up and starting to put his coat on.
Fuck.
“I’m not,” he whispered back. “I’m terrified.”
A nice, middle-ground answer. A “maybe” in the world of yeses and noes. Harry studied him for a bit before he nodded his head and said:
“Will I see you next week?” Harry asked, a corner of his lips curling upwards. Draco was suddenly very aware of just how close they were standing.
The travel back to the mainland was calmer, filled with silence and thick sense of grief. Narcissa again sat straight, looking out of the window and gently trailing her hand over the small wooden box on her lap. She hasn’t spoken a word to any of them since the ceremony ended. She only looked into the distance, clutching the urn to her body.
He looked to his mother. She sat to his left, looking straight out of the window, into the chaos of the sea. Her eyes were still red from crying even though she hasn’t shed a tear since they left Harry’s house. She was clutching her new wand tight on her lap, knuckles white from the force she had in her grip.
“Sounds like a date,” said Draco, taking a bite of his hot potato. He could feel his face blushing but when he looked at Harry who was definitely blushing too he felt a bit better about himself. “Where’s that confidence of yours, Potter? It’s not as funny when others are making
He started to bite through my arm. He wasn’t in his werewolf form, we weren’t that stupid but he’s just mental. I don’t remember much after the first couple of bites. The pain was… let’s just say it was a lot. I regained consciousness at St. Mungus, no arm in sight. Later they transferred me to a muggle hospital. And then I did physio for a while. They even gave me a prosthetic arm but it’s clunky and I couldn’t get used to it, even with Luna’s magic. So I’m just without an arm when not working.”
“Of course I will talk to you,” agreed Harry, quietly. “I’m in a… similar situation. Nobody really wants to deal with the repercussions of dealing with me.”
“What is a straw if not a very thin jar without the bottom?” asked Draco, levitating the smoothie next to Harry and sitting down to finally enjoy some of the breakfast.
“You’re just gorgeous,” whispered Harry, before placing a kiss into his neck. His hand slid through Draco’s wet hair and he felt like he could melt under Harry’s cold, wet fingers when the sound appeared and he was being pulled through the door.
to clean up the spilled rum. The liquid disappeared from the rug and the armchair, leaving just the empty glass on the floor.
“It’s nothing. Sorry for ruining our… date.”
A stream of warm air went through the stranger’s hair, taking the dark pigment with it. And it was him. Draco Malfoy in person. In his house.
“May I kiss you?” he asked in a hushed voice, looking him intently in the eyes. Draco reached for his voice to answer “yes, please, now” but couldn’t find it. He never wanted anything more than to be kissed right now. Instead of talking he closed the distance between them and placed a kiss on Harry’s soft, smiling lips. It was just a small touch, a spark really. But he could feel Harry’s hand getting lost in his hair, pulling it delicately as if making sure he’s still there. He leaned in to deepen the kiss, enjoying the scent of rain on Harry’s warm skin. Draco’s hands started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, button by button taking his sweet time. All he could think of was how good it feels to be kissing that gorgeous,
After giving him a couple drops of
“Draco?” Harry’s voice brought him back to earth.
handsome. He leaned over the stranger with his left hand on the arm of the chair holding most of his weight.
“Damn, she’s really mad at me,” Draco whispered, walking towards the stairs, his steps creaking softly on the old floor. He touched the soft fabric of the sweater and remembered that he didn’t ask Harry if he wants this one back. Draco could feel his heart beating hard in his chest on just the thought of the other man’s name. He looked back at the bedroom door, soft sounds of a muffled conversation reaching his ears, and smiled softly.
“So it’s just… us?”
Draco’s head was full of contrasting emotions so he just kept quiet, holding his mother’s cold hand while she started reminiscing about her life. About her marriage. How Lucious was a great husband and a great father. How brave he was. How much he gave up for them to have everything. About the times before the war, before Voldemort, before it all went to shit.
“So… Care to explain?” asked Draco, putting some bacon on the grill and wedge of cheese onto the little pans.
Draco looked into those sweet, green eyes, fire twinkling in them, feeling the blood warming up his face and the tips of his ears. Harry was smiling, his face inches away from Draco's. Very carefully he took the injured hand in his own, bringing it closer to his face. Only the tips of Harry’s fingers were visible over the white gauze and he placed a small kiss over them, their warmth leaving a ghost of their touch on his lips.
I think she calls them,” he laughed squeezing next to Draco and laying his head on Draco’s chest. In turn, Draco tried to convince his heart to calm down.
“Yeah, you don’t say.”
“Do you still serve that cinnamon coffee from last year?”
making people uncomfortable. It was one of the few joys of his life right now. “So you said something about lunch?”
They lied down, facing each others with their hands entangled, Draco’s eyes feeling heavy. Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how
Harry snapped him out of his thoughts with his fake cough.
Draco shook his head. “No. But thank you.”
“You haven’t read the paper?”
“Doing well, thanks. The kids are being annoying to deal with but what can you do. Are you still cleaning up after your assistant screwed up the audit papers?”
“Oh my god! Congratulations!” Harry laughed, hugging them both again.
“How much do you know?” asked Harry, looking at the other man from between his eyelids.
Draco, still, looked at him confused.
“Oh god, no. I think we’re way past that option,” he laughed, awkwardly. “But the guest bedroom is yours, Pipps will get you a change of clothes and Tommley makes the best hangover pancakes this side of the Thames,” Harry smiled encouragingly. “It’s fine. Just… I don’t know. Let’s both calm down and get you another one of those gin and tonics.”
“So you can own it but you can’t buy it?”
“Draco? Wanna go first?” Harry asked, motioning towards him with the open menu in his hand.
Like a passenger, trying to survive a car crash that was unfolding in front of his eyes.
“Well… we are 26. I thought it was time to grow up,” answered Harry, honestly. “When did they let you out?”
“Twice in a week? You’ll get tired of me in no time. But yeah. I’d love to.”
“Sure. I’ll let you know.”
“If you want to,” Draco answered, taking the cue to get dressed too. He was done with his coat while Harry was still struggling with his buttons. “Do you… need some help?”
Draco nodded, swaying just a little bit. His eyelids were heavy and he felt like his head was floating a foot above his body.
“I know you can. I just wanted to treat you.”
Harry slapped his forehead and took his wand again. He had to focus for a while and he wasn’t sure if he even should try to do it but the alcohol in his brain definitely said ‘DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!’
“As a felon I’m forbidden from purchasing a wand in the UK,” answered Draco “I can have it. Just not buy it.”
“You know… I never looked at it like that,” said Draco, looking intrigued. “He did try to kill you an awful lot of times.”
“Let me take it,” proposed Harry, taking out a fifty and handing it to Agnes. “Please, keep the change.”
“You can barely call this a stab wound,” Draco joked back, playing with one of the curls on Harry’s head. “Aren’t you afraid they’ll go to the press?”
“So what’s the deal with you not having a wand?” asked Harry politely floating the bottle of rum towards Draco’s glass again and then back to his own.
“You really can just stay here.”
“I honestly forgot how good you were at charms,” said Harry, leaning over to take a sip. “A straw? How the hell did you charm a straw?”
Saturday, March 11
He stretched away from Draco, the cold air usurping the empty space between them so fast Draco shivered. But Harry went back to exactly the same position from before the stretch, defeating the cold in the fight of the space closer to Draco. He pulled him closer, taking a deep breath.
“Alright. Do you want me to talk with Mrs. Brimm?”
“Shh,” whispered Harry, touching Draco’s face, moving some one the hair away, enough for him to place a soft kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Go back to sleep.”
“Harry?” said Draco, that warm, sweet smile still on his face but now a tiny bit less confident and a tiny bit more concerned.
“You cursed me. In sixth year,” said Draco, unbuttoning the first two buttons of his shirt and showing the long, thin slashes over his chest.
“Hi,” he heard on the other side. Harry shook his head to wake himself up a little bit more.
“It is 8am. Mum just left and I was thinking about…” Harry could hear Draco taking a deep breath and exhaling slowly. “I was wondering if you’d like to go out. Sometime. For a drink maybe?” admitted Draco.
“Thanks for saying that.”
“Or you could stay,” murmured Harry rising from the armchair. Draco could see the tension going back to his face. It was surprising how easy it was to read his face. He smiled at that thought.
, he thought sitting on the toilet. How did he mess it up so badly? How did it go from a lovely dinner to mending wounds in the span of 3 seconds? The whiplash hurt his head and he was sure he’s going to regret this evening for a long time after he gets home.
“Shit, then do I have something for you, mate. Come on,” said Harry, getting up from the chair. “Get the rum with you. We’re changing the sceneries.”
“Because I have four identical to it,” Harry stated, sipping on his coffee. “And it looks good on you,” he added, staring back at Draco with a wicked smile.
Tom, the barman, stood behind the bar polishing glasses that seemed to always need polishing. Harry was not sure if Tom is an actual person because he hasn’t changed since he saw him for the first time 15 year ago. His wrinkles are still as wrinkly as they’ve ever been and teeth as absent as before.
“Muggle,” he said quickly. “As far away from the magical side as possible.”
“Oh my god, Harry,” barked back Draco but he did laugh. A little bit.
“I’ll be fine as long as you don’t take advantage of me,” he tried to wink but he was definitely not fit for it so he just blinked slowly with a shadow of a smile on his face.
“Uhm… well, I did go though the training pretty quickly since we were still hunting the Death Eaters and they needed the personnel. Ron worked with me back then.”
“Draco?” Harry touched his face lightly with the top of his hand making Draco look at him. “Do you want to go back to mine’s?”
Draco thought about it for a second, letting Harry interlink their fingers together. The heat emanating from his hand felt almost painful over his cold skin but in a good-painful kind of way.
“I’m afraid it comes out only after a few deeper ones,” admitted Draco.
Couple of days have passed and Harry was getting pretty sure that he’s never going to hear from his school archnemesis ever again. He was going through a thick file of unchecked essays when he got interrupted by a text from an unknown number.
“Yeah…” he said softly, quickly looking away from it and putting it back on his chest.
Harry didn’t think much before placing that kiss. He never thought much about things like this. But when Draco turned and just looked down at him with a question in his eyes and a smile on his face Harry’s thoughts began racing towards something very inappropriate. He felt a slim hand grabbing him by his belt and pulling him in, closer. Draco’s light, soft hair brushed Harry’s cheek when he heard him asking:
“Can I still help you with something?”
“Fuck, I’m sorry. I didn’t mea-”
“Oh, they see exactly the same thing. Mrs. Brimm takes care of the Muggles too.”
“There’s also my phone number,” interrupted Harry, He ruffled his hair and scratched his neck feeling suddenly self conscious. “And the address. In case you’d want to… come over for another drink.”
“Oh, I am Harry Potter,” said Harry, sitting down in the armchair.
Harry took a deep breath and looked at his watch. Draco should be done soon enough, he can wait until the end of his shift but it was cold outside. He straightened his jacket, fixed his hair, took another heavy breath and walked into the store.
“No worries, Tommley. What was the commotion about?”
“We were a bunch of fucked up kids, weren’t we?”
It never felt right to be wandless.
“Sure. Green tea with rosemary, please.”
“I wasn’t aware that we were taking turns,” murmured Draco, but he looked glad to change the subject.
“Sorry, Harry. Pipps said that you’d be here and I…” Draco started, his voice cracking but he couldn’t finish as Harry pulled him closer, enveloping him and a tight, warm hug.
The house was silent but filled with the smell of pancakes an fresh coffee. He looked around. There were a couple of doors down the corridor to the left of the staircase but they all looked the same as the ones near to him. He knew the one across the hallway is Harry’s bedroom and so he hoped that the door at the end to his right is the guest bathroom.
over the two of them. “Stop it, Draco. You’ve served your sentence.”
uncomfortable?”
“You’re great, Pipps. Thank you.” Draco decided that he liked this one. She reminded him of Dobby.
“No problem. And for you?”
“Yeah, you don’t say,” whispered Draco, hoping that Tommley wouldn’t hear them talking about her.
They sat in silence for a minute or two, studying the lunch options and catching glances from above their menus. Harry was now convinced that the thought of how handsome Draco is was not just a drunken feeling but pure fact. He smiled at this thought.
“Your father?”
“Did you wear a uniform?” asked Draco, looking back at Harry with the curious glimmer in his eyes.
in Azkaban. And who are you to tell me that you know me?” asked definitely-not-Draco-Malfoy. “I don’t recognize you at all.”
“Yes, she did. Thank you. I’ll give it back after I wash it,” said Draco as he pointed at the chair next to him. “May I?”
“You look great,” he said, lowering his gaze. “If I knew you’d be dressing up I would’ve chosen something better.”
“Well, it’s a bit complicated. He actually killed a part of his own soul that lodged itself in me when he tried to kill me the first time.”
“I didn’t want to jinx it,” she smiled.
“Yeah, you don’t say.”
“Yeah… You can’t really fly in London and I can’t really leave without half of the country knowing.”
“No, it’s his nephew. The parents moved to the States but wanted the kid to study at Hogwarts. Slughorn treated him as his own though.”
“Well… what was left of him after the Kiss at least.” Malfoy lowered his head, letting his hair fall down in a curtain of gold. “He didn’t recognize me. He just… stared into a wall, murmuring something about duty.”
In the Manor when he lied to save their lives and again, he was so scared. Sure, that wasn’t much considering literally everything else he did but there was hope. And god, Harry needed hope to be present in this world.
“That must’ve been annoying,” Draco noted, taking a sip out of cup. “Getting desk duty.”
“I will,” said Draco, sliding the piece of paper into the back pocket of his jeans.
“Come one, Draco. I’m getting cold!” he yelled, hugging himself with his arm and backing into the house. It looked like he was wearing an apron.
The man pushed him back just enough to face him and look right into his eyes. Crooked smile present on his lips but it didn’t reach the steel grey eyes.
Harry recoiled back, dropping knife and shaking his hand with a breathy “shit” on his lips.
“What about your mother?” asked Harry, focusing extra hard to magically pour another glass for Draco.
“Oh shut up,” laughed Draco punching him in the arm.
“And tell them what? That their Golden Boy is enjoying some casual sex? That he’s a bit fruity? They can’t really touch me. I saved their asses and they still need me.”
“What?”
“I should’ve apologised a decade ago then,” sighed Harry but he stopped his hand, intertwining their fingers. “I shouldn’t have even used that curse. I didn’t know what it would do to you.”
“See you around, Draco.”
“Never took you for someone respecting the authorities.”
He sat next to Draco, putting his wet coat on the stool next to him. Underneath he was wearing a long-sleeved, black shirt and he looked
“Why are you dressed?” asked Draco, sitting up and rubbing his eyes.
Neville looked at him, confused. “You were texting with Malfoy?”
“Sleep well,” Draco added after a second. His voice quiet and calm.
“I’m sure you say that to every one of your
“I’ll send it over,” she screeched and left the room, still shooting glances at Draco.
“Do you want to stay?” asked Harry quietly, almost too quiet for Draco to understand.
“Happens to the best of us.”
The stranger sitting on his armchair looked absolutely mortified. With his back straightened and his eyes wide open he looked at Harry in disbelief.
He started unwrapping the wound, the gauze white at first quickly started showing the dark brown prints of old blood.
“Shame those papzz got involved,” the other man said, looking up straight into Harry’s eyes and holding onto his forearm.
“Sure you can. It’s yours. I kind of stole it from you anyway. Sorry about that,” Harry messed up his hair. He felt so drunk and so warm and so… just happy. That’s what rum does to you.
He noticed a neatly folded bundle of clothes at the foot of the bed with a fresh toothbrush on top and a towel. It’s still very early. He could grab a shower before leaving, right? Draco looked around in search of a door to an on-suit bathroom but it looked like it was not there. He could call for the House Elves but he’d rather… not do that. So he got up, took the little bundle into his arms and opened the door leading to the corridor.
He threw a couple of logs to the fire, watching it catch and grow, relishing in the feeling of heat on his whole body. The warm smell of burning wood entered his nostrils and he took a deep breath letting it flow through him. He heard rustling behind his back and soon felt Harry’s body behind him, his arm pulling him closer, his palm spread wide over Draco’s chest. His neck was being kissed again and Draco let his eyelids fall, enjoying the sensation.
Harry sighed. The papers floating over the table in the line of his eyes closed and flew to the table under the window. He had to put down his egg muffin to open the text, quickly scanning through the contents, then dialling the number of the sender. He put the phone on speaker to continue his breakfast.
tapping the tip of his wand on Harry’s hand. The strips of stark white gauze started enveloping the bloody wound, being immediately coloured red. He kept holding Harry’s forearm while the spell took its course in covering the injury and looked around. The blood was everywhere. The sink, the cabinets, the floor. On his hands and clothes. The bloody rag that was once a light blue kitchen towel was lying nearby, accusatively.
He walked swiftly towards the door almost walking over Pipps who was ready to knock when he moved past her. She was carrying a change of clothes for Draco in her thin arms and looked a bit startled by Harry but she just shook her small head, her ears bouncing left and right.
Safe.
“You asked me to. And I told you already. I’m just lonely.”
But then it was over. He could leave this chapter behind him. He could start anew. He could do anything. The feeling of relief washed through him and he felt relaxed for the first time in his memory.
“An apology is the least you deserve,” said Harry, laying on his back, his eyes pointed straight at the ceiling. Draco curled up right next to him, placing a line of kisses over his shoulder and neck.
“Thank you, Pipps,” he said when she put the tray on the desk. He turned to her, doing a little spin. “What do you think? Is it alright?”
“Get a shower. You’ll feel better,” he said, half-kneeling in front of Draco’s still form. “Can I get you something?”
“And the cards don’t really care about that, Mr. Malfoy. Now go do whatever you have planed,” she said, taking the wooden handle of the mop and basically pushing him out of the door, into the cold March evening. He didn’t even get the chance to say thank you before the door locked behind him.
