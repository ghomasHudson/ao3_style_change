Granger looked awkwardly around the ridiculously tiny bedroom, just enough space for a bed and wardrobe with precious little room between to walk. A single Puddlemere United poster adorned his wall. Soon, she noticed the books and notes covering Draco’s bed. She walked forward, like a moth to a flame.
Not to be outdone by Potter on anything, Draco sat beside him on the bench, and took the stick gingerly between his fingers. Bringing it to his lips, he took a long inhale. And promptly hacked up most of his lungs.
“Positive,” Potter answered. “It was right here by Ron and Hermione’s stuff when we all went down to dinner.”
I’m somewhat aware of this. He sent me my wand and a letter after my trial. And, yes, I’m fully aware that I was only acquitted because of his testimony (and Ginevra’s and Longbottom’s and Luna’s and Thomas’s) as to how I was a minor acting under duress. In the letter, amongst the apologies he definitely didn’t owe me, he’d said he wanted to talk. I was so fucked up at the time, I could barely talk to my mother, let alone Potter.
He leads me down the street to a small park. The midsummer sun is just getting low enough for the trees to cast long shadows on the pavement.
The cutesy couple name was nauseating enough, but then the article analyzed Granger’s and Weasley’s underthings. It speculated as to the details of their physical relationship based on the more alluring items: red, lacy pants and tight, black trunks respectively. There were accompanying photographs of said underthings. Frankly, it was a mental image that Draco would have happily lived without.
It's a strange question considering I thought that they'd dated. Ginevra doesn't seem uncomfortable with it, though. And Longbottom is practically passed out with his head in her lap.
I glance at him out of the corner of my eye. Potter's laughing, like her leering is some inside joke.
I look him straight in the eye. My heart is threatening to escape my chest, and a bead of sweat is rolling down my neck. “Yes.”
Later, Draco was on his bed, reading yet another volume on security charms, notes spread around him, when he heard a gentle rapping on his door. No one knocked on Draco’s door. No one talked to Draco.
Potter returns with some muggle brand. It’s not bad. I keep my eyes forward, hoping that Potter will take the hint, but he just continues to lean silently against the wall next to me.
Harry-fucking-Potter, whom I have spent the last four years avoiding. As this strange friendship evolved between the least Slytherin Slytherins and the most Ravenclaw Gryffindor, I’ve had the misfortune to see Potter at pub nights. And I’ve flat out scarpered every single time. Because, yes, I am a terrible coward, and what else am I to do with the man who was my first schoolboy crush, whom I’ve nearly killed, who’s nearly killed me, and who’s the reason I’m not rotting in Azkaban with my bastard father?
It’s Potter that I can’t deal with. Pansy seems to think that if she gets us drunk and dancing, we'll admit to being soulmates or some such nonsense.
Late that evening, Draco sat beside Potter on a sofa in the otherwise empty common room. Potter swore his way through a Potions essay while Draco alternated between advising and mocking him. Every once in a while, their legs would brush, sending tingles all through Draco. It seemed, at times, as if Potter was flirting with him, but Draco was careful not to be forward. This arrangement with the vaunted heroes was too delicate to risk misreading signals, not that Draco had much experience reading those, having spent far too much of his adolescence afraid for his actual life rather than cultivating a social one.
I hide in the loo for quite some time. Turns out, it’s the first door on the right. Which I’m positive Pansy knew. Conniving cow. If she keeps this up, I’m going to run out of original insults before the end of this party.
Draco stubbornly maintained his schedule of common room appearances, refusing to let it appear that Smith’s accusations even registered with him. But one clear night, he just couldn’t take the whispers anymore and went for a walk. He wandered deep into the gardens, where tall grasses had gone to seed, boasting multi-colored tufts. Following a strange odor, he came across a figure perched on a bench. As Draco approached, the figure looked up, moonlight reflecting off his glasses. Of course it was Potter, looking absurdly handsome despite, or maybe because, of his messy hair and shabby jumper.
“Are we fourteen, Seamus?” Granger asks with an eye roll. It’s an excellent point and evidence of Granger’s vast intelligence.
Since the incident with Powell, the eighth years seemed to be making an effort to be friendly with Draco. Thomas and Finnigan decided he needed to follow muggle football, which Draco admitted wasn’t completely without merit, despite being confined to the ground. Longbottom animatedly discussed the intersection of Herbology and Potions with him. Smith had actually apologized for his accusations, although Draco doubted his sincerity as he’d chosen to do it loudly during lunch. Draco still didn’t feel entirely comfortable around the eighth years, as if this peace might suddenly disappear, but it was refreshing to not be ostracized.
gotten ahold of these pictures? Students were restricted to the grounds with so many Death Eaters still at large, meaning no Hogsmeade trips. Mail was being screened to watch for threats from increasingly desperate Death Eaters as well as to protect the privacy of celebrity students.
And it led to there being entirely too many toiletry bags stacked on the shelves next to the sinks. He searched around, eventually finding his, only to discover his comb was missing. “Bollocks,” he muttered again as he plucked leaves out of his hair by hand. He may have cut his hair in a taper style as a way to further distance himself from his father (fuck the manipulative arsehole) but it was also pleasantly easy to care for. He used a bit of potion to artfully spike the longer hair on top and spelled his clothes neat.
The group cheers, then dispurses. Some out the french doors at the back of the room, some up the stairs, presumably to change. Pansy appears in the empty space beside me.
Luna Lovegood hops off the back of the bike, taking off her helmet and beaming like the sun as she rushes up to us. Pansy gets a kiss on each cheek before Luna exclaims, “Draco! I’m so glad you made it!”
So, yes, he might have been forced into working for the Dark Lord, but he was not a petty criminal. And sure, there was a day when he might have stolen Potter’s bag to mess with him, but Draco was beyond bullying Potter to get his attention.
“Yea, that’s it,” Weasely nodded. “These photographs look like copies of copies. What if that’s how the arsehole is getting it out around the security charms? They aren’t physically sending anything out. Just a duplicating charm.”
Finnigan waves an inebriated hand. “What about that bloke that blew you in the alley behind Innuendo?"
Declaring himself once again suitable for public appearance, he walked back to the common room to find Potter looking around a table anxiously.
Draco, who had been carefully avoiding the conversation, finally looked up to find the whole room staring at him. “I didn’t steal your backpack, Potter,” he said with careful nonchalance before looking back to his book.
But it’s completely changed. Walls have been removed to open the first floor up into one giant room with neutral tones and big windows. All the morbid decor is gone, replaced by bright but tasteful pieces. It looks good. Welcoming.
He tells me about the panic attacks after the war and leaving auror training. About getting help. He seems nervous to admit he’s been to a mind healer, but like I’d judge. I’ve spent plenty of time with one myself.
A few days later, Draco arrived at breakfast to find the eighth year table taking the mickey out of Potter. While Potter appeared to be taking the mockery lightheartedly, Draco could see a subtle tightness in Potter’s expression. No one else seemed to notice, but then Draco had spent a great deal of time staring at Potter.
Draco thought about his long sessions with the Swiss mind healer his mother had employed for them over the summer and met Potter's gaze. "No, I imagine we all need some mind healing after what we've been through."
We find a bench, and he produces a flask of whisky from a hidden pocket. Does everyone have these extension charms? We can’t see the sunset itself for all the buildings, but the sky turns a gorgeous mix of colors.
Granger left breakfast abruptly that morning, Weasley followed after her, unwisely insisting that she’d just gained back weight lost in the last year. Ginevra had been quite upset that the article had discussed a Weasley propensity for accidental pregnancy. “Mum is going to lose it when she sees they brought up Bill’s birthdate,” she’d lamented. Lovegood gave a surprisingly medically accurate lecture about early pregnancy symptoms, at least until the part about nargles.
Granger opened the door. “I just wanted to say thank you.” Granger smoothed her jumper over her perfectly normal midsection. “You didn’t have to be kind to me.”
He didn't understand; no, not at all! What was Malfoy talking—saying—wanting of him, now? Wasn't he already giving over all that he was; all he was made of? What more could there be?
Time, like Ancient Runes, was Mystery with many possible interpretations. Or so Harry had concluded, possibly whilst he was in Norway or maybe it was the second time he found himself staring at the same very large red rock and explaining patiently to the pushy gentleman who'd accompanied him there that these were not technically 'runes' so much as they were the art and history and sacred property of the natives and that the pushy gentleman and his equally pushy government owed the natives a massive apology--plus the promise to fuck right off and not bother DoM or the natives ever again.
"Seriously, you're mad, alright? I'm not--repeat, not!--having a child!" Draco shouted, highly irked to be fetched up to the entry to the Mansion's latest addition: the Sports Room. Billiards, trikes, an entire funhouse arcade in miniature, ensconced right in the midst of his formerly staid marble manse. "Not of my own, at least. Leave off, I say! I'm warning you!"
"Oh! Yes, Potter—sorry," he grinned. He tightened his loose hold on Potter's hips and buttocks—and such firm ones they were, and ones he'd plans for—
Ichika-san bobbed back up again, pink-cheeked, looking a lot less likely to imminently expire and huffing in her relief, the sound nearly lost on the wave of the ever-present desert winds and subsonic white noise of sustained concert casting.
Draco talked through it, the throbbing sound; 'round it, below and above it, desperately. Listing reasons, trotting out data, talking up Veela and Malfoys and the many positive attributes he could boast of, despite being only nineteen years of age.
"Draco Malfoy, you're an unmitigated arse," Hermione informed him from where she sat plumped and prissy-faced on the centre of the double-wide ottoman, twirling her wand like a bloody baton and she an anti-cheerleader. Ron nodded, crammed in next to her, one leg tucked up, one half-falling to the carpet but still tall and broad and ginger, oddly sphinx-like. He'd his arms crossed and Draco eyed his muscular forearms warily.
“There go your arteries, Ronald—more fool you!” Hermione huffed, chewing her apple slices with deliberately loud crunches and tossing her two sickles in between swallows. “Huh! I’ll give you twenty years, Ron, and you’ll be in for it. Drop dead one day, likely, straight off your silly broom.”
romantic, Mister Malfoy! Perfect place to browse for odorous items for two young Wizards in love! She carries all manner of oils and lotions, as well, I do recall. Ah! Would you…would you perhaps wish her direction, Mister Malfoy? As a courtesy for such an excellent order?"
“I know, Pansy,” Theo nodded, a concerned frown wrinkling his brow. He turned his eyes to Draco. “Hmmm. Perhaps a visit to Pomfrey?”
He was, Draco admitted to himself in his most private moments, still reeling. With the wonder of it all, with sheer gasping awe that Harry seemed to return—no, match almost exactly!—the depth and breadth of Draco's runaway emotions. Staggered, too, by the heartfelt relief he felt, engendered by finally locating and latching onto the most important person in any young Veela's existence: his mate. His true love, his partner. For Harry Potter was exactly that and every day Draco counted himself the most fortunate of beings: Harry loved him.
“Oh, Merlin, Mum,” he moaned over the floo to his mother, who was living permanently at large, and currently gallivanting through Tuscany with Blaise’s newly widowed mum for company. “It’s been a month now already. What am I to do?”
“Oh! That,” Harry nodded wisely. “That 'Condition' you mentioned and then didn’t have the opportunity to tell me about, at dinner. I was wondering about that…” He cocked his chin inquisitively, a glint of reproach in his gaze. "You know, you could have said something a great deal sooner. It's been a week since I heard a peep out of you, git."
at all. Harry tromped down his urge to leap forward and wipe that smirk off with two lips. Actively snogging ones, too.
Above it, emblazoned upon an ornate medallion, all wreathed about with bas-relief carvings of baby animals and miscellaneous florals, was an eye-catching polished brass plaque proclaiming ‘NURSERY’.
Also, a curious point had been raised in Harry’s mind, at least. If Malfoy’s hair was that…fascinating, what about the rest of him?
"Yes." He blinked up at Draco from behind the thin shield of his spec lenses, exuding earnest intent. “
Why ever should he? Love Harry? Harry hadn't meant to, either, but that hadn't stopped him. Why would Draco?
"Yeah," Harry agreed, panting. "Me, too," and they both shut their eyes for just a quick moment—a moment.
“Of course I do!” Harry informed his fingers fiercely as he jammed them together. They made a lumpy mess on his lap, all jumbled like that, but he didn’t care. “I mean to say, ah. You’re my partner, Malfoy. Right?”
"We'll play a game, Potter," Draco grinned in return, his gaze promising all sorts of creativity behind those Charmed hangings. "Just the two of us."
"Oh…well. Fine, then. Legilmens!" Harry sighed. Sighed again as the spell came whispering, creeping up. He shut off the light that was his startled, wondering eyes by simply closing them, leaving Draco in the dark. Draco closed his own, knowing the dark was better shared. Besides, he'd be dizzy in a second. "Okay—
"In fact, stay the bloody hell away from him, Dad. I know what I'm doing, thanks ever so. Better than you, at least."
"I don't know what you mean!" he snarled. "I haven't! I've not done anything to you, Malfoy! Nothing recently, at least. 'Cept maybe save your arse in DADA yesterday—remember that?"
“No fear, I shall not deny you this simple pleasure,” he smirked. “Merlin knows you don’t get all that many, Potter. Be right back--oh, and please Scourgify that?” He pointed at the table’s surface. “Teddy was here with Andromeda, remember? There was a plethora of that Muggle Playing Dough spread all over it. That shite sticks like the dickens.”
“About that. Supper with me at mine tonight? No time like the present, is there? Carpe diem, sieze the day, all that shite, and--and, Draco, I really could do with your help with, er, something. Ah-um,  something’s that’s cropped up since I’ve been home. To do with Grimmauld, actually.” Harry's intensely earnest stare shifted to a pointed look, a minor species of glare. "Besides. You still haven't told me what your trouble is, have you? A bloody 'condition'? What even does that even mean, anyway?"
Harry, Draco noted, looked pretty confident. Of course, he’d had some little success with quelling Grimmauld’s own declaration of ‘House Knows Best’, the lucky bugger, but even so, his control over the Place was a bit spotty. It may've been merely that Harry hadn't an ounce of spare time to truly set it to rights, but Harry's Ancient and Noble manse still rather more resembled a bawdy house than the home of a highly respected Runes Archmage. Too, Kreacher and Hermione had both reluctantly admitted Potter was ultimately fighting a losing battle. Draco had made sure to consult them--discreetly, of course. He eyed Harry suspiciously. Gryffindor bravado was not going to get him his old familiar Manor back, no. But a Harry Potter fighting tooth-and-nail for his friend? Now, that was an entirely different cauldron of flobberworm spit, and Draco was gambling on it.
"That's funny." Draco blinked at the floor, strewn with the litter of bachelor living. "What you said, just now."
"I know, my sweet git. You'll get over it, I'm sure. But—isn't it fortunate the timing's worked out so well?
lover coaxed. "It was all for a good cause, admit it. Now we can go wherever we want, sit with one another whenever we wish—meals here; even Hogsmeade, come Saturday, if we care to—and
"Or so I assumed for some years, Draco, though quite incorrectly in your case, my love. I quite believed you'd taken after Lucius, Draco. I was so pleased to find you hadn't." Draco emitted a high-pitched wordless squeak of shock, blinking rapidly at her. Scary! "Mmmm. In any event, how things do change, dear—do they not? And at times in a most pleasant way imaginable, yes. I imagine you're finding your new life to be precisely that way, are you not, darling? Delightful for you, son. I am so pleased."
“Well, you could have said something!” Harry scowled darkly, closing his book on his forefinger with a peeved little thump. He twisted about to face Draco full-on, ripping his specs off his face and rubbing a hand over a set of clearly tired eyes. “Gah. I’ve been holding off supper for ages!”
With a simultaneous sharp slash downward and the left, they ended the Negatus, tearing it to harmless shreds, and then continued their flow of amplified casting on the upswing, sealing the affected glyph with Protectives and Conservators Charms. Luce would be by to ascertain all was well with it at a later time, naturally, being the resident Archmage.
"Oh, yes," Harry mumbled, tongue inserting itself in the seam between thigh and groin, newly revealed now that boxers had joined Draco's sleep pants, carelessly flung off to one side of his spread legs. Harry was between his knees, head buried against Draco's springy blond shot hairs, and snuffling like a pig rooting truffles. "Say my name, Draco. Say 'Harry', luv—I'm not just Potter, am I?"
“Agh, sorry.” I say with great articulance. My shoulder slams into the doorframe as I rush out. I don’t even know if I close the door behind me.
The late afternoon’s cooled and everyone’s migrated back to the sitting room, more or less fully clothed now. Pizza boxes and beer bottles are strewn about the floor. Cristiana is trying to convince Pansy and I that grated, raw tuna is an acceptable pizza topping. Luna just smiles adoringly as she braids Cristiana's hair up in elaborate coils.
Huh. I take a deep breath and push down every cowardly instinct. “I thought you were fit, too. Might have been why I spent so much time being an arse to you. Pulling your pigtails as it were.”
The articles continued. A photo of Potter smoking cannabis like a muggle. (Cannabis was a common enough ingredient in potions for anxiety and chronic pain, but Draco had never heard of anyone smoking it before.) Speculation as to what Weasley would buy Granger for her birthday. (Weasley had questioned nearly every female in the castle for advice.) A topless photo of Longbottom working in the garden. (Draco had to begrudgingly admit that Longbottom had gotten quite fit in recent years, so fit that Draco idly thought someone should name stunning puberty transformations after the bloke.) It was all silly gossip, but Potter was still clearly worried about the missing journal, searching for it daily.
I'm just about to apparate away from this disastrous attempt at socialization when I hear Potter calling.
She gives me another one of those shit-eating grins as she reaches into her little hip bag. It's a B&P original, sold in the store she and Blaise run. The height of style, made functional with an extension charm. She pulls out my trunks. “Don’t worry, love. I came prepared.”
It’s awkward as fuck, especially with Weasley hovering beside her, watching me carefully, like he doesn’t believe I’ve changed. Can’t blame him really.
Draco sat at the end of the table and tried to be unobtrusive. Lovegood slid down next to him. Out of everyone at Hogwarts, she was the only person who tried to be friendly with him. She said she’d seen his true heart while imprisoned at the Manor. While it was true that he’d done what he could to sneak extra food and supplies to the prisoners, Draco still felt guilty that he’d been too terrified to do more.
“It’s fair, Harry. Very little splash compared to Ron,” Thomas answers, his arms around Finnigan from behind, chin resting on his shoulder. Interesting. I wonder how long that’s been going on.
Draco had spent most of the party in an armchair off to the side with a glass of neat firewhiskey in his hand. It was not a particularly good firewhiskey, but Malfoys did not mix their drinks. Harry (who insisted on first names if they were going to continue figuring things out together) seemed to be making no effort to maintain discreet distance and edged a little closer to him with every disgustingly sweet concoction he ingested. Around his fourth, Harry had slid down the arm of the chair to squish beside Draco. Between the sensation of Potter’s body beside him and the firewhiskey, Draco was feeling quite flushed.
Seeing no way to conceal his actions, Draco chose instead to disguise his motivations. He couldn’t stand Granger knowing that he wanted to protect Potter. “Yes, well, if everyone is going to accuse me, I might as well know how it’s being done.”
The Hogwarts governors had thought it prudent to house the returning eighth years away from the rest of the students, reopening a section of the castle previously used for graduate students. Most of the eighth years had been quite surprised to learn of this when led on a tour of their new dorm. Granger had exclaimed, “Have none of you read
From then on, Granger insisted that they work together on their research. At first, Draco found this thoroughly irritating, as she talked through every find.
I’m frozen. He’s just standing there, completely naked, and I can’t stop staring. His bronze skin is beautiful despite being marked by more scars than I would have assumed. There’s thick, dark hair on his chest thinning to a line on his smooth abdomen. Running all the way down to… something I am definitely not going to look at. I snap my eyes back to his face. Somewhere, my fifteen-year-old self is screaming.
“I don’t know why everyone thinks they’re funny. I think they exude childlike joy,” Lovegood commented as she pushed a magazine in front of Draco.
I nod, but I’m still staring at the motorcycle because Harry-fucking-Potter is dismounting in slow motion, wearing horribly tight jeans and a leather jacket. He takes off his helmet and shakes out his long hair before pulling it back in a messy bun. There’s a bit of stubble on his chin, like he’s too lazy to shave every day, and he’s looking at me with the slightest hint of a shy smile. It’s June in London, so not exactly tropical, but suddenly I’m sweating.
Draco’s gut twisted as the search died down, but the suspicious glares continued. Even Powell gave him dirty looks as she set up her ‘house bonding’ game night. Draco stood and walked towards the bedrooms so he wouldn't have to endure being pointedly left out of that nonsense.
Granger’s smile grew as she flipped through Draco’s notes, without asking of course. “Hold on. I’m going to get my notes, and we can pool our information.” Granger hurried from the room, nearly vibrating with swotty excitement.
had cropped up to fill the void for salacious and unsubstantiated drivel. This week’s cover article seemed to be about Potter:
Granted, I guess they are now. It’s a weird post-war reconfiguration of relationships that I’ve only witnessed from the sidelines. It started with Granger sharing classes with Bulstrode and Greengrass. Then studying, then the pub. Eventually, other Slytherins and Gryffindors joined in. I heard there were some tense incidents along the way, but it all seems smoothed over now. It helps that the Bulstrodes and Greengrasses weren’t supporters of the Dark Lord. Parkinson’s mother was heavily involved, but she and her father only paid lip service, switching sides easily after the dust settled.
“Looks like she’s set us up,” Cristiana says with a smile and an unfamiliar accent. Portuguese? No, Amazonian flora. Brazilian.
Draco followed suit. The small bench meant his arm pressed into Potter’s, shoulder to elbow. It felt terribly nice, sending little shivers through Draco with every slight shift. The stars shined brightly over Hogwarts, and they stared up at them in silence for quite some time.
However, the room is quickly convinced. I stand, because there’s no fucking way I’m playing Truth or Dare with a bunch of drunk Gryffindors. Pansy has other ideas, pulling me back down and literally sitting in my lap. There’s no way I can get up without making a scene. Bitch.
“Well, I didn’t find my hand in a girl's pants distasteful.” Potter swallowed audibly before speaking again. “But I think I might like to do it with a bloke too. So I guess I’m not sure I know yet.” He sounded afraid in a way Draco didn’t think he’d ever heard from Potter.
Draco thought of Potter’s fear that his private thoughts would be published. Weasley and Granger’s embarrassment. The threats against Longbottom and Ginevra. “It stops now,” Draco hissed.
He’d taken to studying in the gardens to avoid other people as he wasn’t exactly feeling welcome this year. Pansy was living with cousins in Japan while Greg and his mother had gone to America of all places. And Vince, well, Draco didn't want to think about him. The only other Slytherins to return for eighth year were Zabini and Greengrass, but as their families had had the good sense to avoid entanglements in the war, they were being treated with only slight caution. Draco seemed to be absorbing all the animosity. He was well aware he deserved it, but it’d be nice if people remembered who was really to blame once in a while. And so, he had developed a careful strategy of being seen just enough to create the image that he didn’t care what people thought of him and flat out hiding the rest of the time. He was having a shite year, but it was a decided improvement on constant fear of torture and death, so hooray for that.
“He is.” And suddenly, I feel guilty for every birthday party I’ve skipped to avoid running into Teddy’s godfather.
She’s smiling, probably thinking it’s going to be something like dying my hair green. But the whole room has gone silent. Cristiana’s face falls as she realizes she’s fucked up. I take a deep breath.
I hold out my arm for her to side-along. “Are you coming?” I snap, looking out into the street. It’s full dark now, with little islands of lamplight.
“These photographs are a bit blurry, fuzzy, or something. Bright flash. Like a camera.” Weasley mumbled and stroked his stubble. “Hey, Gin!”
“Malfoy.” Potter’s voice came quiet and tentative as Draco approached his door. Draco took a deep breath and turned.
Potter took his disgusting thing back, taking a long inhale with ease. “To each his own.” Potter leaned his head back on the bench and looked up at the stars.
I'm the only one with any real dark past here. A point everyone seems well aware of given the amount of side-eye I'm getting.
“What’s all this?” she asked. Glancing over the papers, her eyes lit up. “You’re trying to figure out how someone is getting the photos out!”
The mystery of the smuggled documents occupied Draco’s thoughts during Potions as Slughorn reviewed material Draco had learned on his own years ago. But as he had no amazing revelations, he’d mostly forgotten about it by the end of the day.
“Umm.” Potter’s face is bright red. “Well, I kissed that girl at the pub in April? But she never called me.”
“Lovely view out here, isn’t it.” She doesn’t bother hiding that she’s admiring Potter. The bitch winks at him.
This had become an issue over the summer when Longbottom and Ginevra’s relationship had become public knowledge. They’d received a number of threats to their lives and property.  Potter’s ‘fans’ accused Ginevra of breaking his heart, with rather unsavory commentary concerning the number of boys she had dated. Longbottom was merely accused of being a shite friend. Potter had been forced to make a statement explaining that he’d only dated Ginevra three weeks, and he was thrilled his friends had found something together. The threats had ceased, but the desire to pry into the private lives of Potter and his friends continued.
Draco tried to study, but his foot tapped restlessly. He hated that people assumed the worst of him. He was fully aware that he had done terrible things during the war. (Not like he’d had much of a choice when his other option had been death.) He’d written letters of apology to those he’d hurt the most and made quiet reparations where he could. McGonagall, of all people, had told him over tea and biscuits that she felt as if she’d failed him for not helping him get out of his father’s control. He’d even had some tense, awkward apology trading with Potter after Draco’s trial.
“I didn’t realize it at the time, of course, but I was kind of obsessed with you in school. And not just because I thought you were up to something. If you hadn’t been such an arsehole, and I hadn’t been so clueless, maybe I would have snogged you.”
Fuck. Not dare, I don’t want to make a fool of myself. Truth then, she probably won’t ask anything too scandalous.
“I’m so pleased that you have faith in me.” The words should have been sarcastic, but Draco couldn’t get the tone quite right.
told him it was half six. “Bollocks.” Draco stood, shaking the pins and needles out of his left foot. Brushing off his trousers didn’t help the wrinkles, and a crinkling sound told him he had leaves in his hair. He’d missed dinner, but if he hurried, he could still make it back to the eighth year dormitory and get cleaned up before the others returned. He was going to let anyone see him disheveled; he still had his pride.
He didn’t have the energy to feel or care about anything anymore it seemed. It all hurt too much. So he turned himself off. He became numb to the world and all reality. He even turned off his Floo, not allowing anyone to come in to visit him. He stopped taking his medication, figuring there was no point anymore. There was no point in getting better.
Hermione threw her boyfriend a disgusted look before hitting him on the arm. Now was not the time or place to be making remarks on Harry’s BO.
“Draco! Don’t be stupid. Your skin is flawless!” cried Pansy in amusement from behind him. She’d only said it to get his mind off of his boyfriend, and it had worked, she noted happily.
Harry didn’t recognize the song that was currently playing. But that’s not what had caught his attention in the first place. It was Draco. Draco hadn’t noticed Harry yet. The blond appeared to be lost in his own little world as he danced along with the song.
Harry sang to himself as he returned home and moved around the kitchen putting his purchases away. He couldn’t help but plant a kiss on each of the peaches as he put them into the fruit bowl carefully, making sure not to bruise each one of their perfect fuzzy skin. He was in a chipper mood. Getting coffee with Malfoy had gone well and he’d even managed to talk the blond into getting dinner together Saturday night.
Harry’s absences at work soon started to piss off the Head Auror and his other superiors. There was only so far being The Chosen One or the Minster putting in a good word for him could get you. It didn’t seem to matter how many dark wizards and witches he caught on his good days. He eventually had to face the music that he couldn’t keep on living like this. Bipolar was kicking his ass.
In the time it took for Draco’s beautiful grey owl to return to with his reply, Harry had not only had a shower but also shaved and had a spot of tea and toast. He was seated at the large worn wooden table that took up a good portion of the kitchen, flipping through an old issue of the Prophet. He rarely read the rag of a newspaper nowadays. But Hermione had left it behind the last time she’d been over, at least a week ago now, and Harry had nothing better to do. He was eager to hear Draco’s response.
He had tried to juggle his demanding career as an Auror while he was also struggling with his mental state. But within four years he had burned himself out.
“It was a birthday gift from Harry,” announced Draco proudly. It was a black sheer button-up shirt with a floral pattern.
As Harry turned off the faucet and ran his wet hands through the unruly curls that sat atop his head, his best mate and work colleague, Ron, walked through the locker room door.
It was at that moment that Malfoy looked up from his book, as if he sensed Harry’s eyes on him. The blond just stared at Harry for a brief second before his face lit up into a small smile.
The single ceiling light in the small room immediately buzzed to life as Harry stepped into the small cramped space. He stared hard at his reflection in the mirror for a second, before dropping his gaze onto the round basin and turned on the faucet. He tried not to notice the flickering of the light above him or the slight tremor of his hands as he pushed his glasses off of his face and splashed cold water onto his cheeks.
Walking On Sunshine was playing loudly from the store’s sound system, ironically as Harry walked through the automatic doors and reached for a plastic shopping basket. He couldn’t help but smile to himself again. Walking on sunshine, indeed.
“Harry?” he whispered as he made his way towards the bed and towered over Harry. He placed a hand on his shoulder and gently shook him.
“I couldn’t,” said Harry flatly. He knew it sounded like a weak excuse and it was. But it was also the truth.
Harry enjoyed sex, but he didn’t necessarily crave it. When his sex drive was high though, usually when he was in a manic episode and wasn’t in a relationship and his hand wasn’t able to satisfy the need, he would go to a club for a pull. There were two muggle gay clubs he liked to frequent when the need struck.
Harry sighed as he looked at his reflection in the mirror. It wasn’t that he looked terrible. The actual physical features of his face weren’t the problem here. It was more of a struggle with the clothes he was attempting to carry off. Being a bit of a gym rat and personal trainer, Harry spent most of his time wearing athletic clothes. He was way more comfortable in t-shirts and trackies than anything that required pressing or had actual structure to it. Usually, Harry didn’t care what was on his body, but he knew it would matter to his fashion-forward boyfriend what he looked like tonight, so it was important to Harry too.
Harry scratched at the stubble on his chin as he peered at Malfoy in puzzlement for a second. He didn’t recall telling the blond that, but he figured he must’ve at some point. There was a slight flush to Harry’s cheeks in embarrassment before he let out a nervous chuckle.
“HARRY?” Draco called. There was a slight echo to his voice as Harry heard his name being called out from the other room as well as on the monitor.
He lay there for what seemed like forever, fighting with himself when the Floo downstairs went off. His heart began to race as he heard movement from downstairs a moment later. A cold sweat ran down his neck as he forced himself up into a seated position. He knew who it was.
Harry buried his face in his hands as his stomach twisted with anxiety. He heard the click of Draco’s shoes on the worn wooden floorboards before he saw him. He didn’t dare to look at his husband at first. He didn’t want to see what was written across his face.
Harry had barely looked at the lunch menu as Draco waved for a waitress and ordered another dry cappuccino and the lunch special (which was half a Reuben sandwich and a cup of chowder soup). Harry, who didn’t care what he had, ordered the same and another coffee, this time a mocha. He knew he would probably regret the caffeine later when his manic episode kicked in but right now the coffee seemed like a good idea.
Dating was already hard as it was. Throw in some mental health issues and it made the whole thing almost impossible to do.
The couple slept for a few more hours before being awoken yet again by an alarm going off. This time it was Draco’s. Both men groaned as the song on the radio came to an end, and the radio jockey’s cheerful voice blared around the room.
Those lucky classmates were Luna Lovegood at tonight's party, who had tagged along with Ginny, who Dean Thomas had invited. Ginny had been present at most of the parties since she and Dean were dating again. Since that night at the Burrow, Harry made sure to keep his distance from Ginny and Dean. Since returning to Hogwarts, he’d half been expecting Ginny to spread the news that he was gay. He was always on edge those first few days back. However, no one said a word to him about it, not even Ron. It seemed like Ginny had believed that he was joking about the whole being gay thing. As for his friendship with Dean, it was no more. Not that there had been anything there beforehand. Sure they had shared some laughs and good times earlier; however, those carefree days were gone. Harry wasn’t sad about this. He would rather be alone most days if he were being honest, which was hard enough as it was in the saviour of the wizarding world and all.
“I thought you said you didn’t drink,” replied Malfoy in a playful manner. His eyebrows wagging as he leaned slightly into Harry. His grey eyes were bright with humor.
He was the fucking saviour of the wizarding world, he shouldn’t need medication just because of some silly mood swings.
Harry pushed his way through the dimly lit club until he reached the bar. As he waited for the bartender, his eyes took a quick glimpse around the place. The walls were painted red, and there was disco and funk memorabilia plastered everywhere.
Harry didn’t answer right away. He let out a shaky breath as he tried to gather his thoughts. What was wrong, he thought, everything.
“Malfoy. I am sorry. I really am sick. I’m not just some shit date that bails last minute like this, especially when I made such a fucking deal about it having to be tonight.”
Harry once again rushed to the window at hearing the familiar tapping on the glass. His heart was racing anticipation of what Draco’s response would be. He rarely dated nowadays and when he did, it didn’t last much past the first date.
Harry then made his way into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. As he did so, he noticed a familiar owl perched on the open window sill. He couldn’t help but smile a little as he took the letter and began to read it.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen Draco like this before. This loose, silly, and free Draco. Harry had seen this side of his boyfriend a few times in the two months they’d been together. But it was a rare side. Draco only acted like this when he was drunk or in private, surrounded by those he was most comfortable with. But here, Draco knew each word of the song, being carefree, cute and fucking beautiful as he did so.
“Yeah. So you see, I’m not some saint. I get frustrated with Harry too,” said Hermione as she finished off her tea and abruptly pushed back her chair. “Do you want cake? I feel like cake!”
“Of course,” replied Draco, sincerely. Of course, he loved Harry. When had he implied that he didn’t? He wondered.
It had become their sort of bit. Any time now that they ran into each other, Harry would always point out how shocking and out of character it was for Draco to be seen amongst muggles. The first couple of times that Harry had done it, it was true. Not in a million years had he thought he would ever see the blond in the muggle world. But now he did it more just to get some sort of rise out of Malfoy who both hated and loved it at the same time.
Draco moved his hips from side to side, gently teasing Harry as he did so. His hand slid upwards and began to play with the curls on the back of Harry’s neck.  Harry’s eyes immediately closed for a second before opening and locking with him again.
They both stared at each other for a second. Neither wanted to part but knew they had to. Malfoy had dinner with Pansy to attend. Harry watched as Malfoy licked his lips and cleared his throat.
They exchanged awkward small talk, as best as one could do in a crowded club while dancing poorly with each other. Luna was not a bad dancer and didn’t care if she looked terrible. It was more Harry who was struggling to keep up with her. He was hopeless without Draco to lead him. At this thought, his eyes drifted away from Luna and her wild moves, over to Draco. He was a few feet away from Harry now; few people were separating them.
Harry let out a shuddering breath as he began to fight with himself. Anger and sadness twisted painfully in him. All thoughts of self-doubt begin to bloom like large hydrangeas in his mind. The hopeful, happy side of him that was only there moments ago fought and tried to push down all these negative feelings and thoughts suddenly threatening to consume him.  He shook his head rapidly from side to side, trying to erase all this sadness from him. “Please,” he begged with his reflection in the mirror. His eyes were wet with tears threatening to fall, but he quickly blinked them away.  He didn’t want to cry. He didn’t want to fall apart now.
He knew he shouldn’t let something like this, something out of his control, bother him, especially at his own party. But he couldn’t help but feel like the entire universe was against him tonight. He’d been looking forward to showing off his sexy, fit boyfriend to all his friends. It wasn’t that far into the party yet, though. He knew that when Harry did finally manage to show up, there would be plenty of time to introduce him to everyone and grind together on the dance floor, showing off to everyone how utterly disgustingly perfect they were together.
Harry, who was taken off guard by this small and intimate gesture, just stared at Luna in bewilderment before trying to pull away. However, despite her airy appearance, Luna was quite strong and held onto Harry’s hand, not letting him go. Harry tried to pull away a second time before giving up. He let out a sound which was a mixture of a sob and sigh, before pressing his forehead into his knees. He allowed Luna to continue to hold his hand, but he didn’t dare to look at her.
Harry gave Draco a quick nod of his head, a small smile forming on his face before he began to lead them down the road.
Swallowing over the lump in his throat, Harry gripped tightly onto the plastic handle of the basket, gathering all the courage within him to make his way over to Draco.
“I have to go,” he said, suddenly sitting back on his haunches and closing off the Floo before Hermione could get another word in.
“Potter. Nice of you to finally show your face. I was beginning to worry that this was all some sort of bloody setup…” teased Malfoy in a playful tone before trailing off as he took in the disheveled appearance of the other man. “You look like shit.” The smile was gone and replaced with a look of concern.
They stayed like this for a moment, pressed up against each other, listening to the music playing from the Wireless before Draco broke the silence. As much as he wanted to stay in the moment and pretend for once that they were a normal couple. The little voice in the back of his head kept on nagging at him to ask. Draco pressed himself close to Harry for one last second, breathing everything in before taking a step away.
“What is this?” asked Draco with curiosity as Harry slid the gift towards him. He eyed the silver bow before looking towards his boyfriend for some sort of explanation.
In the present,  Harry lay in his dorm bed, willing his erection to go away. He often woke up like this. Most of the time, he could get the unwanted erection away. However, all his usual tricks weren’t working this morning. His erection continued to throb painfully against the strain of his boxers. He let out a sigh before once again looking around at his roommates, who were still fast asleep.
“Whaaaat?” Harry gaped as his evil git of a friend ran through a very odd set of opening musical scales. Horridly offkey ones. “Excuse
for once, git! Don't be sly! I don't get you! And don't talk about spells and potions when you mean something else entirely—I'm not a brick, you know. I can thnk for myself, thank you!"
?" Lucius Malfoy's voice barreled through as an enraged squeal, so high up the register in emotional portent it was well nigh ear-shattering. Draco's wince threatened to overcome his hard-held serene façade. "
"How are you feeling, love?" Potter bent over him, his face lined with worry and loving solicitousness. Draco scowled.
"I love you, too!" Harry vowed sternly, not caring a hoot about his clothing, as his cape was safely out of the way. He blinked up at his Veela; Draco looked quite fierce—and rather pointy—Veela-ish, and very handsome indeed, bearing down upon him. It was…thrilling—in a very good way.
Harry, caught up in a fugue state of contemplation, didn’t notice their by-play. He’d developed the most amazing ability to concentrate on several events at once (and sometimes even coursework) and then sort them by priority, according to a personal scale of how much he actually gave a damn. Ron being a twat tolled in as ‘not important’; Hermione pestering Ron to ‘Stop playing about, Ronald!’ didn’t even register and neither did what passed for heavy flirtation between his two best mates.
Goyle and Abbott, Parkinson and Weasley, Granger and Zabini, Patil and Brown, Finnegan and Thomas, Longbottom and well, erm, anyone available and breathing: those were the other steady couples the group had grown accustomed to, despite or because of the Friday night Shag 'N' Swap thing. This, effectually, had muddied up the categories Percy Weasley so adored, and cast all concerned in Eighth into a state of alcohol-hazed and usually contented 'togetherness'. They might be bored silly continually, stuck in the limbo of not-quite-adult-yet, sod it, but they were family, now.
“It’s just his hair’s…that peculiar colour—and very different,” he explained seriously. “It’s unusual, is all. Not even Luna’s hair is quite like it…though I s’pose she’s the closest. In, er, hue. Maybe they’re related. Everyone else is.”
Weaslebee clearly wasn't satisfied to let the matter rest and the darkling glare he sent Draco's way caused the hairs on the back of his neck to rise. Doubtless, there'd be some sort of retribution coming and Draco would do well to watch his back in the near future—there'd be hexes sent first opportunity when they returned tonight, no doubt.
"Oooo-errr!" Harry gasped, not sparing a glance at his lover, who shifted uncomfortably. "Whoa!" The flagstones were quite painful, seeming to grow harder as he waited patiently for Harry to look at him. "Merlin's Bollocks!"
Potter meanwhile completed a triple loop-de-loop, ‘round and through the smallest hoop, whooping all the while, and the Snitch was so close to being his, Draco could practically taste that, too. The Ravenclaw Seeker was reduced to simply staring, bug-eyed, from a distance.
"...Good to see you, too," Draco said faintly, hastily recalling his manners. "You're, um, certain it's alright?"
Three fingers, all deep in and searching, reaching for a little bundle of nerve endings Harry knew well from his own explorations; finding it and skillfully manipulating it into a pulse of blinding ecstasy. And all the while tongue—Malfoy's—and also teeth, invading his drop-jawed orifice with passion.
Draco barely noted it. He kept his eyes solely on Hermione, leveling his stare. "I am never a dog, please."
“Luna-san, I believe a Muggleborn colleague at Yamagata has contacted the Magical Attaché there, yes, but nothing much has come of it yet,” she replied, her soft voice nearly carried away by the constant steady wind. “Takahashi-san has persisted but the organization is always very busy. They barely have time to spare for us here.”
"No, no," Draco hastened to assure his father. "I do believe, Father, he's proceeding. In that, exactly. A…well, let's call it an
It had seemed so satisfactory….till he recalled Draco was wealthy and it would be coals to Newcastle, likely. But still…it wouldn't leave his head, the notion. Muggles looked upon jewelry as being important, as being a worthy gift. And he'd not been much trained up in the art of giving to his lover. Had never before given much of anything to anyone, outside Hermione and the Weasleys.
“No, no,” Millie giggled, dumping everything down upon Harry’s blotter. Being as deft as she was sharp, not a drop spilt nor a missive was lost to the updraft from the small fire crackling away merrily  in Harry’s hearth. “Arse. I meant that it’s the topic of the day, apparently, going by what I’m seeing coming though the post from Antwerp. I rather think your gentleman friend over there has a bit of a pash for you. He’s certainly eager to consult on the slightest of prevarications.”
Draco yelped—teeth! The little bastard had deliberately scraped his incisors down Draco's family jewels, just now!—and let his heavy head fall back upon the cushion, squinching his eyelids shut tight against the sight of that black mop of hair, returned to flopping with a will.
It is a place of danger to Wizards and Muggles alike and every little while it is needful to come and strengthen the bounds that contain it. So they do come, all the Rune Mages, their students, their elders, as many as can gather, and rebuild the warding magic handed down over millennia. As they have done, and their forebears before them.
Malfoy chortled, bucking that rather large part of him that was jammed deep in Harry’s arsehole. The resulting jiggle made Harry catch his breath in an inward puff, and he blinked rapidly.
"Mmmm," Harry mumbled lazily, not really wanting to be roused. He was comfy, but that damned Draco wouldn't let up; he knew that. "'M'kay. Whatever. Yes."
That was a bit of an alright, Harry being a reluctant early waker. Or rather, he would struggle up from the usual nightmare and lie huddled fœtal in his bed, not shifting, not stirring, but with eyes wide open, drying out, and staring into space, caught up in the wish that the grey light of dawn would function as a great eraser for his troubled mind. Time would pass, like treacle dripping, and the sky would lighten at the dorm windows: four o’clock, five o’clock, six. Then he’d fall back asleep finally,
"Of course we can, Potter," Malfoy sighed gustily, dropping a stray kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth, the tip of his tongue picking up the tiny red velvet pearl of blood that welled in the centre of the lower one."What did you think I ventured all the way down here for—mere handholding? Hah!" He emitted a short, sharp bark of amusement, and Harry revelled in it: the gleam in grey eyes, the tiny curl of twitchy upper lip, thin, pink and highly snoggable.
“No!” Harry burst out, gallantly attempting to ignore the weird bubbly rush of strangely icy heat up his throat. His spine had stopped twinging but now his esophagus felt bathed in Fiendfyre. “You don't have to! It’s nothing--I’m fine--really I am, it’s just. Just inconvenient!”
"Idiot!" Harry exclaimed, and halted his spin. There! The tiny hillock that rose from the far end of the Lake—the one he'd discovered quite by accident when he'd first flown on Buckbeak.
"You!" Draco yelped abruptly, impelled by a growing sense of urgency and swallowing down what felt like boulders jamming up his windpipe. "You, Harry—you need me, don't you? Y-you want me? I know you do, damn it!" He jerkily got on with what was, hands-down, the absolutely most alarmingly humiliating, most crucial moment of his entire life—the final act of proposing. "I mean I do, Potter, and don't you forget it! Want to—with you, git! Only you. Don't you dare not know that, Harry Potter—don't you dare forget!"
"So I—and you—I mean to say, won't you, Harry?" Draco entreated, not noticing, but half his words carried no solid sound—and hadn't. His powers of speech had deserted him. His voice, what there was left of it, was reedy and atonal; half-mutter, half-squawk, with much Veela evident. "Harry!"
Hermione blinked at him, slowly. What might’ve been a smile appeared slowly upon her puzzled features. Or…maybe not.
“It’s not quite all that for me, though,” Draco went on, his tone musing, his wandering hand somehow slipping round Harry’s twitching back to land casually across the hollow between Harry’s hip and rib cage. “I’ve known you for a long time, haven’t I? There’s feelings between us two, stretching way back. Aren’t there?”
“It’s pretty,” Harry remarked innocently, both eyes returned to the shiny, not minding that. “The water in the Lake.
A quickly caught breath and a sense of utter stillness in the room was the immediate response—the only response for an entirely too long stretch. The body beside him glinted as its elegant lines fell into a cast of carven marble; Harry could make that much out at least, even in the dearth of reflected, refractive light. It was raining outside: torrents of rain, and the half-drowned gaslights on Diagon Alley were struggling to stay lit. The curtains were drawn and there was nothing but their faintly glowing cast-aside wands on the bedside table to betray either of them.
Er, right, then. Draco gathered his thoughts and returned to his military-style stratagems with gusto. He's a lot to accomplish and no time to do it in, really. Harry had better be stunned by his superiour quick thinking under pressure, as well as the sheer grandeur of the Ceremony Draco had in mind.
“Shag, actually,” Harry corrected him. “But snogging’s a good start, so yes. That too, definitely. So, ah? Are you game?”
Ron didn't react to that, much; certainly he was still mumchance and uncannily silent, not crowing aloud over Draco's failure, his loss, his stupidity. Well, excepting that his fists loosened up finally and his eyes narrowed, assessing. No, Weasley sat very still instead, like a coil, compressed under pressure, dangerously inert. Hermione, of course, reacted differently.
“Malfoy…!” Harry growled. “Malfoy, you’re pushing me, way too damned far, git. I’ll be eighteen before you know it and then we’ll see—not that I can’t make your life miserable right now, if I want!”
Draco on the point, preferably right into the forgiving mattress; keep him pinned there forever, so he’d never leave and Harry would know that Draco would always, always be there—to come home to.
They shouted, nearly in unison, Draco crying out 'Harry!' and Harry stuttering Muggle obscenities, and Draco went down in an exhausted heap next to his partner, gasping through his dried-out nostrils and swallowing over and over.
“Well,” Harry said slowly, laying the book aside, and setting down his own mug, his gaze never leaving Draco’s face. “I rather wanted to talk to you. I was going to lead up to it, but I’m not so good at that, really, so I just. I just wanted to say it. Get it off my chest, so to speak. I’ve been thinking, Malfoy. Rather a lot, but especially since last night.”
“Fuck me,” Draco bit out, snatching up his discarded quill and absently rending off half the fletching in one go. “And we dare call ourselves Aurors, you and me.”
“Cheers,” Harry replied, taking what Draco handed him, and they both got on in peaceful silence with the unshrinking of the takeaway and dishing out from the multitudinous cartons.
the fucking bastard here, for just walking out on me. And for not listening, not even trying to—why is it won't you hear me out? Why are you even like this? It wasn't that bad, what I did, Harry—it wasn't even that awful! It can't have been; I never meant it to be!"
…The curve of the arse; well, he couldn’t manage to keep other eyes off it no matter what. No incantation, no cloak of invisibility would ever hide a Malfoy. They stuck out, like Purebred thumbs. The height and the slimness and the elegance—all that was common fodder, known fact.  There was no way those attributes of Draco’s would ever be private between them; no more so than would Harry’s eyes or Harry’s flying or Harry’s horrible hair. Too common, all of that—too much used to the public eye.
"NEVER! Arsehole!" The epithets came through in spotty blips, thank the Three, sounding more like an obscure dialect than anything. Perhaps Orkney. "Pipsqueak! Interfering! Do-gooder!
And, gods, but Harry's body was so hot, so searing hot, even through their clothes, and it was like dancing naked on the lip of volcano, how they used to feel for each other, almost palpable but hovering just out of reach. How it was just there—within a hand's grasp, if only he could manage some lift, a little boost—a ounce of mercy. Just…a dream of mercy on Harry's part and they'd be fine again, Draco knew. And how hard they were still, hips mated, what with Draco's cock gouging a little dent in Harry's midriff and the both of them panting away in each other's faces as if oxygen were in short supply and the world burning down round their ears, unnoted.
Draco folded his lips thin. This was more than enough, this whole ridiculous tiff. It had gone far enough, and he must needs put to a stop to it. Anything he needed to do, he would do.
"Oh, yes." His Mum was tapping a long fingernail against her chin, bobbing her intricate coiffure ever so slowly, her eyes bright with speculation. The fond maternal smile had slid subtly into what Draco perceived as a rather evil and reptilian grin; she seemed entirely too highly intrigued with this topic, his Mum, and Draco shivered over it. Nothing about that expression boded well for his peace of mind. "Mmm-hmm. I see now, Draco. You know, I find I do completely understand your quandary, darling. Really, you must have had a particularly difficult time with it, all these many years at school attending with him. As it was of course Potter and not just any old Tom, Dick or Harry, correct? But naturally instead, ah, the Harry." She waved a white hand at him, reflexively shooing off all other potential contenders for her son's affections. "Couldn't have been any other boy, though—really, no. No, no, no—not remotely a possibility, not now I consider the entire picture. The Slug Incident, dear, and then the mudslinging you complained of so bitterly, not to mention all those Quidditch games you forfeited, darling…why, it's almost as if it were Fated, dear. How very…sweet."
Harry grinned madly—a great barmy beam of delight—and snuck sideways glances as best as he could upon Draco's intent face as
“I, ah.” Harry stopped, swallowing. The surreal pressure was vanished, his body was all returned to normal, the effects of the Veritus well and truly gone. “I care for you, very much. I do.”
“Down there, isn't it, the nursery?" Harry blinked at the newly renovated hallway. "Huh. Your old rooms from when you were a kid? They were all very green, as I remember.”
It was so, so soft, the feel of Malfoy's mouth and yet it seared him. It left him jittery and blissed out and panicky in a good way—the best way. Sexual tension; the sort that one could hack away at with a butter knife for eons and never make a dent in: that was practically a palpable force between them, pulsing. And too, there was this godawful feeling of being left bereft when the quick, dry brush of lips withdrew, as if he'd been granted heaven for an instant, only to have it ripped away.
“Well,” Harry grinned, casting his glance covertly about the other diners. “Spain doesn’t lack for lovely people, does it? And a nice shag goes a long way to soothe away the pain, right? I’ll do, Luna. Don’t fret over me.”
Luna giggled, promptly discarding her coffee. She rose unsteadily to her feet, her lemon-hued sundress and scarlet-patterned shawl swishing about her, and cast the swathe of her abundant hair over one shoulder.
Draco could swear he heard Harry's teeth gritting over that last…and then the world thankfully fuzzed out and Draco Malfoy, Headmistress McGonagall's contentious choice for Head Boy and a known ex-Death Eater, tough as they come, came as close to fainting dead away as a Malfoy ever did, his elegant person dipping and swaying and approaching the Reparo'd flagstones at top speed as he tottered and stumbled.
“Oh dear, darling,” Narcissa smiled, looking years younger after her recent months of sunny holiday, “I am afraid that it’s no use, really. The Manor’s got a mind of its own, you know. Always has, always will. Doubtless it only wants what’s best for you. Doubtless you’ve been terribly lonely, rattling ‘round there all on your own.”
Draco swallowed hard, fidgeting in his seat, his hectic flush growing under his mother's scrutinous eye.
“No time, not for that,” he testily informed the unfurled scroll, wincing at all the handwritten notes Mills had scribbled helpfully along the margins. “No time a’tall. I just hope it’s a decent curry and not that shite from that new place she brought me last time. Ho! To work, Harry. It’s not going to do it on its own, now is it?”
"Not at all. It's entirely beneficial. Vincit omnia veritas, Draco—'the truth conquers all'. In fact, I cannot think of a more…fitting…way of officially beginning your relationship with your Harry than by offering him this particular ring, Draco. You'll see."
"It's distinguished, Potter," Draco had sneered then, though his eyes danced with merriment, lighting the grey panes with a glow. "A touch of gold about you. You could use a little more of that, don't you know? Scars are so passé these days; everyone has them."
He didn't have the faintest idea of what had set Draco off. One moment they'd been snogging comfortably, all wrapped up together in an armchair before the hearth, the next Draco had slipped sinuously down the length of Harry's very relaxed person and ended up on the floor. He'd gone through a little gyrating dance balanced upon his kneecaps, digging through his pockets madly for a little box, and then stared up at Harry as if he—Harry- were something strange—something frightening, and enough to terrify even the most doughty of Wizards.
“I’ll do it. I'm off out anyway, down to the town for a little shop,” Harry offered, perking up under the effects of his beverage and eying Luna’s discarded plate with interest. “You go back to bed, Luna. You look as though you could do with another eight hours. Perhaps also a Pepper Up of your very own."
of note, pretty Pottyhead, so that’s hardly to the point. Camping like a bloody plebe all across the boring countryside doesn’t count. Thing is, we can go, soon as you’re old enough to apply for the International Apparation license. Got mine, naturally, days ago now. Came in the Owls. But…oh! You’ll be needing to obtain your passport first. Visa, too, I’d think. Gah! More sodding paperwork!”
It was more than a matter of mere moments, cleaning the flat, bathing, digging up clothes that wouldn't highlight the sallowness of his fair skin, the gauntness of his wasted wrists, and that would pass in places either Muggle or Wizard. Shoving down a bowl of stale cereal and possibly off-date milk as a precaution because he'd not eaten much he could remember recently and remaining too long standing produced a wobbly result in the kneecap region. His blood sugar was low; Harry always complained of him driving himself, of being too focused to take 'good care'. Harry had always been there to take care of Draco for him.
"We're both in this, right?" he'd whispered furiously in Potter's ear after he'd drawn him privately aside in the Kinkleshaft's shop, resisting somehow the overwhelming urge to lick it. "
"Let the future take care of itself, Harry," Draco kissed the ear; he couldn't resist. "Let me give this to you now, please."
Draco—and he was really a difficult, contrary git, even if Harry had realized he was as dependent upon Draco's many flaws and faults as he was upon his cock and his courage and the very occasional warm light that filled those expressive eyes, now and again, as they turned upon him. Now, he snapped his teeth as he twisted his head upon that pale column of neck to confront Harry, the tumbled sheaves of hair shifting across his high furrowed forehead. Regarded Harry most seriously, as if he were a stranger come stumbling into the quiet little room. Or perhaps a stray erumpent, found lurking unsuspected in a dim corner.
“Oh, no, but thanks all the same. I really cannot manage another thing; I'm so sorry. Another time, I promise. However. Since you insist, then.” He regarded his friend gravely. "There is actually a specific reason I called, yes. It is to do with the Manor, yes, just as Hermione told you, but it's not a curse, so much. It's a condition, rather."
The campaign started small, by first reprovingly installing an extremely upscale padded changing table and then shortly thereafter accelerated, via enlarging the already voluminous toys-and-books collection exponentially until an entire separate Children’s Library elbowed itself into existence, right next door to the Nursery proper.
Knowing full well he'd flubbed his first fence, he fell back on to the old familiar and tried for a teasing tone. Perhaps it was too soon to broach the subject of his Manor's misbehaving. Perhaps this was a foolish venture entirely and he'd really only come to the Ministry because Potter hadn't come to him and he was indeed feeling vaguely slighted, just as his mum said? But, fuck's sake, they'd only just met again, and it had been quite a long while. It had to be far too soon for him to beg Harry's aid with his hellish Nursery. Better to delay, really. Too much too soon was a rookie mistake, a common error that could have dire consequences. As an amateur status apiarist and airborne equine trainer, Draco definitely understood that part.
be discussing it later, Harry; don't think for a moment we won't!" the angry boy grumbled in a furious undertone. Only stopped there because Granger pinched him quite hard on the forearm, Draco noticed, wincing in unwilling sympathy. By Merlin, the Walking Library was a fierce one!
"Go on, then." Granger was coaxing him, in an imperiously impatient manner. "What exactly were you doing, Malfoy, to set Harry off like that?"
"No. It's a jeweler's," Harry replied, and snatched Draco's one hand as if it were a Snitch he wanted. "Come on; last one there's buying lunch!"
Draco waved a languid hand, as if this entire occasion had really been only accidental and not something he'd felt far too driven to make happen. A sour feeling filled his gut, and for no good reason at all. Potter meant nothing by his unasked for confession; it was merely unfortunate small talk, that was all. Best to not think upon it, really. Perhaps he was being unreasonable. He turned himself about, ready to bid Harry adieu, focusing as best as he could manage on his friend's familiar features, his top-notch suit, his air of inexplicably filling a space he was always meant to be. It was fine. All of it. Typical of them, really, given that they'd always had the habit of telling each other the blunt, hard truth.
. Now go away, before I bloody well make you go. Take your poncey arse out of my face, out of my house. Because I can't stand you being here, in my home. This is mine, mine alone."
throb of their Hygieian. The triangular flight pattern they’d been maintaining all through became visible at last, a strong ribbon of green light springing to life and wrapping their wind-whipped forms together via their core heartlines. “Vires In Numeris--
"Look, er. Thank you for Flooing me, Father, Mother. Please know that your opinions are always highly valuable to me, as your son and—and I'll be sure to consider them, Father."
"Mmm'okay," Harry moaned, shifting just enough to escape a stray rock beneath his shoulder blade. For now, though, he wasn't comprehending so much as a single syllable. Bee buzz in his head, those Malfoy tones, and all that mattered was the lax laziness that left him replete and complete: he'd never felt this brilliant. There was nothing to compare.
“Different, yes. Don't fret, Harry. What's done is done. And Auntie's never really said, one way or the other. But the boy’s certainly always been entertaining--even if maniacally energetic--and it’s a pleasure for me to help out Auntie when I'm able. She’s a remarkable woman but he's definitely a handful and a half. I'm happy to give her a respite whenever I can.”
Draco remained tethered to Harry's side only by the spin of his wrist bones within the loosely constructed cage of Harry's sticky fingers. He could—and likely would—bolt at the drop of one more ill-considered word. It was an awful prospect to consider. Lowering.
They shut Draco out, those eyes, and the chin he loved to kiss was turned sharply away. Every muscle was tensed in that shorter length of body caught between Draco's form and the filthy bricks of the Leaky's rear wall, as if Harry were but a moment away from simply turning a heel into Apparate in place, no matter how cramped the space was he had was to work within, no matter how much Draco flinched at the thought of Harry dissipating like smoke when he had him nearly in hand's grasp…and then he'd bloody well do so and then Draco would be left again. Bereft again. Alone.
Ron finished off triumphantly and copped a little swaggering bow, left and right, from his seat.  Several of the Firsties actually clapped, the nervy little twits. The remainder of the Gryffs, well used to a sexed up Weasley, either wisely ignored Ron entirely or rolled their eyes at him in disgust.
Naked skin slid deliciously across skin at every point of contact; they both felt the unusual level of slickness that coated and drenched, concentrated mostly down by their respective bits, but every-bloody-where else as well. Excepting their heads, of course; that would've been awkward…and possibly dangerous. Harry moaned as he slithered a hand up his boyfriend's slinky spinal; Draco exulted.
Draco shivered abruptly, and wrapped his scarf more carefully ‘round his throat. It was chilly. Well,
Courage was dry, dull, dreadful stuff, like stale biscuits. Draco choked it down, even mindful. Concentrated on the art of looking as earnest as he felt. Perhaps if he tried it on long enough, it would take.
“Oh bah,” he testily informed the Nursery every single morning. “This again? Look here, I’m only twenty-five, you know. And no real prospects, either, so you’re a bit out of touch. This is so not happening. Please, give it a rest, do.”
Not that Draco didn't care for children. He rather did, actually, and had an excellent relationship with his young cousin Teddy. Had had himself an excellent relationship with young Teddy’s godfather too, but that was well besides the point, given that Potter was not in the picture, as it were. And not that the Manor wasn't meant to hold a family made of up literally scads of young people--because it was, too, and especially after Draco, his mum and his mum’s professional Magical Renovators were through with it. It could contain a whole village, not that the prospect of that was especially appealing.
"Isn't your sister on the market, Ron?" Finnegan asked curiously, "I heard she was looking for an older man."
"I—Harry. No!" Draco licked his lips. Blinked away a bit of lint that obscured his vision for moment. That was what must be making it blurry. "That's. Tha-"
“Flies well, the git,” Draco mused, his eyes fixed relentlessly upon the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain Emeritus.
“Is it--is it that I can’t really talk about it? My work.” Harry tilted his chin, curiosity evident. “I can't, of course. It’s awkward as fuck, you know? Other chaps can natter on and on about what they do all day but I'm not able to. Literally can not.”
be enough, now! Remember your Little Issue, dear. Brandy, my dear; yes, that's the ticket. Or Calming Potion and brandy--even more efficacious, my sweet."
Draco drew in sharp, pleased huff; he nodded in a dignified fashion at Potter’s thanks, in acknowledgement of a deed well done.
"Arrghh! I'm bushed!" And that was Harry right now, stumbling through their Floo, three hours later than he should be, and likely somewhat fly. "Heeey, Draco! Hiya!"
Except that, well…Harry had no bloody idea, the fool. Blinkered git-he'd not a clue that the little bitch was actively employing every wile in her petty arsenal to lure him in: breasts like Muggle torpedos, magically enhanced faux eyelashes and that horrible, helpless little whinge she'd perfected recently—springing from the same species as the evilly tiresome squeals she'd regaled the Great Hall with in their Hogwarts days. The one that left Draco wincing and with a furious migraine pounding away at his temples.
"Well…" Draco sighed and folded his arms across his chest. "I can't speak for you, Granger, but I'm bored shiteless."
“M-Me?” Harry squeaked, allowing himself to be forcibly marched towards the staircase. “What, why me, Malfoy? It’s your bloody Manor. Don't you have control over it, as its Master?”
has published our schedule of public appearances over the next week or so, before the actual ceremony—we can celebrate with everyone that way-and then your mother's handing all the details of actual Bonding. She's just consented, via Owl, before you came down to breakfast, so it's all settled but for the shouting. A June wedding is what every Malfoy betrothed has aspired to, these thousand years—so
made it, despite dragons and that bleeding basilisk he'd heard tell of and the Ministry and even—even the Dark Lord.
“Alright,” Hermione nodded happily, and flicked her wand at the wine bottle. It promptly refilled their glasses and then bobbed off discreetly. “It's settled. Let’s drink to that, shall we? And tomorrow I’ll help you two with your flat search. I daresay neither of you have ever even gone through that
It is dark and frozen damp, the air still and heavy, sticking muddily in Harry’s lungs as he breathes. Luna is budged up close by his shoulder on one side, Garambeau on the other. They form one of several triads compressed into a columnar shape, each of them pointing the tips of their wands to their partnered Wizardkin standing before them at a little distance. There's perhaps three score Wizarding folk in attendance, stationed to describe the form of one of the most powerful spells they ever employ as Rune Mages, the Great Cup, or Chalice.
“In the rear, by the section on Cryptozoology and don’t make me wait, Potter. I’ve rounds after; I’m Prefect. Did you know?”
“Oi, it’s not just that!” Potter protested, giving Draco’s hand a squeeze. “Sometimes we do have to confront Dark Magic, you know. This isn't all about making rubbings and speculating over ancient spelling errors. Sometimes there’s actual danger.”
"Yeah?" Harry snapped back, a wee bit miffed. The pants and jeans stopped moving downward at knee-level; Draco frowned at them fretfully. "Well, sod the fuck off, rich boy—prat who shall be jobless when we matriculate. I
very well funded, we all know that; Hermione's said so," he soldiered valiantly on, only slightly quailing as Potter's expression grew more confused by the second. "And Masters of Ancient Runes command a quite high salary, naturally enough. Even by Goblin standards. But?”
—a dull grinding throb that gutted Harry, standing. And it happened whenever the git was within any short distance; say maybe less than a yard of Harry, and perhaps in Potions class and reaching blithely for a knife to chop dried purple sage leaves into mince or perhaps politely passing across his meticulously recorded lecture notes from DADA for copying over in the library. Perhaps anywhere a'tall and he was a bloody fool for
"You mean, for this weekend?" Potter, it seemed, was also strangely breathless, or at least he sounded so to Draco. "Tomorrow, right? Gods! Is it a Hogsmeade weekend already? I've lost track, really—been so preoccupied lately."
New specs; quite stylish, Draco noted, letting his gaze slip down and proceeding to conduct his own sly once-over: Same old hair; perhaps a shade longer. A marvellously tailored suit beneath the departmental robes; likely Italian. Not a single extra ounce on the man beneath the suiting either; Potter was as wiry and leanly built as always.
Draco's voice was low and cool and he seemed to have withdrawn deep within himself, impervious to the quiet sounds of people about them, giggled and sipping, spending time with friends or family whilst out shopping. Just as an island, rising spare and tall, caught meditating amidst teeming reefs.
He slicked himself expertly, feeling the way his cock angled off a bit to the right—not quite perfect, but respectably long and unblemished, his privates furred with a fine, thin opaque fuzz below the jut of him.
The remainder of their side of Gryffindor breakfast was still setting themselves to rights; Harry fielded a stray glare or two when he ventured a glance beyond the still scowling Neville. All of this botheration was seriously cutting into Harry’s available Auror practice time; he felt the ominous beginnings of his hero-sized temper forming…which was all Ron’s fault. And Hermione’s, because essentially she was enabling the ginger-haired demon git.
Draco’s omniculars were the best to be had in the Wizarding world; showed every single solitary detail, right up close. He could actually count Potter’s eyelashes, as the prat was flying goggleless today, the only protection for his uncommon eyes those awful spectacles. And the git’s pickle-toad-bog green eyes actually weren’t too bad to look upon, for a speccy berk. Pity one couldn’t see them all that well, behind those horrid ancient squareish frames and smudged lenses.
"So, is it?" Draco insisted. Staring avidly at Potter as if this were the sole and only reason he'd come to call and nothing else had ever mattered more than Potter's reply. "
"Mmm," Draco agreed with that idea; he'd enough to do, what with staring down the Swot and the Weaselbee. "M'kay. But...hurry, Harry."
"Ejaculate and excess lubricant, Harry? No, you can't. I quite agree. But you can ask her to come here and help sort the remains of a failed…experiment. She'll help, I'm sure of it. After all, you're such a sodding swot now you want to be in Aurors and she loves it; eats it right up. She'll probably leap at the chance, Harry."
But Ron sang out despite them, his volume rising as he picked up the rhythm of the decrepit nursery rhyme, used to torment unfortunate children the world over in some form or another.
Oh, yes. Malfoy had been an excessively gittish get, before. More so than Ron was now…although that was debatable. Ron on a steady diet of sex was mostly unbearable. He bounced. He cavorted. He annoyed the hell of his best mate.
There was a sudden scrambling…or, rather, a floppy struggle. Harry extricated his tangled legs from Draco's gingerly; Draco managed to remove his manicured talons from Harry's scratched and sluggishly bleeding shoulder blade and waist.
"Bring!" roared the elder Malfoy, his pale face so red Draco rather thought he'd implode on the spot. "The!"
"Remember Perkowski Plotpopkin from Durmstrang?" Ron wanted to know. "He's looking—and he's a great chap, Nev. Very shaggable chap. Just what you like."
“But what if--what if I choose wrong?” Draco burst out, sitting forward. He threw his hands up in a helpless gesture. “What if we’re really only meant to be friends, Pansy? I don’t want to ruin this, I really don’t. It would--”
He allowed himself a quiet sigh, making sure to bump knuckles with his beau. For the moment there was peace, at least. The day was still bright before them.
“Hermione, I think our lad here might be sickening for something,” he remarked ‘round his breakfast, contemplatively. “Awfully distracted lately, our Harry; went right off to sleep last night over my new
“Even for a past Saviour there’s got to be some limits, you know?" Draco laughed quickly, nervously. "Ah, Circe's skivvies, is that a genuine Picasso over there?”
“Thanks,” Harry said sincerely, setting his unfinished butty down with a sigh and taking up his own cooling coffee. It, thank Merlin, was well laced with cream and sugar, and tarted up with a dash of cinnamon, just as he liked it. “I know you do, Mills. But I doubt it’s solely me the rune’s referring to. Luna’s home as well, even though she’s gone straight off on sabbatical, and Chaz has just departed. It’s likely more general in nature. Even you, Millie. Not immune.”
"Thanks, Harry," she said. But passing gratitude for a friendly favour wasn't sidetracking her. "Still—a wimp and a bit of right tit, too, Harry," she went on, albeit very fondly. "But look here—if you
“Ichika-san?” Luna called over to their local guide, a young Mage recently graduated from Mahoutokoro and now attending the Master’s programme at Castelobruxo. “Has UNESCO been recently? I see some minor damage but it’s likely not a concern of ours, particularly. Environmental.” She looked to Harry inquisitively. “Thoughts, Harry?”
Draco shut the Floo connection down posthaste, backing away from it as if it were a dangerous beast. Certainly it had contained one, just now. He stumbled to his feet, weary and with ears ringing still. Duty called, despite all this nonsense and paternal idiocy. And he'd a Harry to torture, besides. Torture with snogs and sucking and licking—It could all be much worse, really.
But it must've worked. He must've been convincing, because Harry was back, back with him again, just like that. In a blink and a sigh. A rush forward and Draco had a loving armful, a solace and his joy.
Harry casts and casts and casts, saving only the modicum of energy he knows he will require when they all Apparate off away to safety at the close of the ritual.
“You see what I mean now?” Draco asked tensely. “It’s that level of insane, Potter. You see how I’m counting on you, really. I don't know what else to do at this point.”

. Still. Not agreeing with you," Harry muttered, scowling darkly down at his boot tips, but he did keep up the pace. “You sell yourself short, sometimes.”
“I know, Potter,” Draco said softly, turning his hand about so that their fingers could intertwine. “It’s alright, really.”
"'Kay," Harry blinked long and hard, enjoying all the sensations assailing him, not the least of which was anticipation. "Nitwit daredevil. Yes, then. Let's."
"Ronaaaald?" Granger trilled suddenly, her bushy head slewing about to face her seatmate. "Oh….Ronnikins?"
'Unknown'-'Runespoor'-'Demiguise', for example, was approximately the number of days counting from when he'd first departed the shores of his homeland and begun his Journeymanship in earnest till his exhausted but triumphant arrival back at Grimmauld. Two years. That exact same set (familiarly 'Giant Squid'-'Three-Snake'-'Horus-Headed') was--not uncoincidentally--the number of days Harry had dearly felt the absence of his best mate and mainstay at Flamel University, Draco Malfoy. Well, a little more than that, but it would do in a pinch to express an expanse of time that felt both endless and all too short.
unexpected flights of child-sized hobby-horses down the stairwells and painfully abrupt showers of monogrammed silver rattles and tiny booties during breakfast.
. You swore it to me, I know you did. I remember—I remember every word, alright? Was as good as a vow, what you said. So—so?" Draco was struck again by the unreality of all that was being said between them. Appalled, more like. This couldn't be happening; he'd wake up any moment…wouldn't he? "Er—ah? What exactly even happened? Because it can't have changed that fast—you can't
"Stop that," he mumbled aloud, taking random whaps at Draco's chest with limp wrists and floppy fingers. "Grabby. And you didn't, either. You didn't know it at all."
"Ready?" he breathed and Harry nodded after a slight pause; he'd had to pry his eyes open to focus on Draco before he could do so.
"Um, alright," Harry said, waggling his brows and tossing a spare tendril of hair off his forehead. "Be that way, why don't you? Difficult and cryptic. And grabby.
won't you? Look, Malfoy, I'm well aware this is all arse about face, and I know for certain we're going to shag later, which is when I
But the theme was by no means contained solely in the one wing of Malfoy Manor. Oh, no. Not a bit of it.
"Why in Merlin's name would you ever think to alight upon Potter in any sort of connection to my romantic prospects?" he pressed her. "You know we've never exactly been even the slightest bit civil, Mum, so I don't see where your blasted 'of course' is coming from—I've only just now mentioned that our relationship even exists!"
"As a matter of fact, Mister Malfoy…my extended family just happens to specialize in the very thing! How…fortunate, isn't it?" Floribunda trilled. "I'll direct you."
“Oh…kay, Harry,” she said. She looked at him for a while longer, as if it were something odd, his theory concerning the largest body of water he knew and Malfoy’s bloody hair.
"Mmm…no, don't think so," Harry shrugged philosophically. "I'm alright, but—what a ride, yeah? Fucking
“Idiot!” Harry snorted softly, sticking the pot lid back on with a hasty clatter. “Taking the piss. I am perfectly well, ta. I do have a real life, you know." He shrugged ruefully when Draco squinted disbelievingly at him. "Or sometimes I do. Today’s one of those days, I guess.” He beckoned, indicating a higher degree of hurry. “Well, come on then, will you? If you're coming, that is. It's half past eleven already. We should make a start before the morning's gone. Shift arse and get your kit on; I'll wait.”
"Anyway, Malfoy," Harry very firmly attempted to steer their conversation back on track. "I like what you're doing here for Nev. Let's get him settled first, alright?"
“Oh,” Ron blinked, staring at Neville blankly for a moment. “Oh, right. Sorry, I’d forgotten. Want me to spell that for you?”
"They do, " Potter nodded wisely.  He took a deep breath, straightened his posture. "Right. And, as it happens, and remember I’ll likely have to kill you if you breathe a word to anyone, even your own mum, I’ve been triply promoted since, direct from the field." He shrugged casually, sending the fine fabric creasing across his shoulders and torso, as if this were nothing, just a trifle noted in passing. "Before you even ask, Mysteries operates a little differently than most departments, alright. So...Don't ask, mate. But it's why I'm here now. In Ancient Runes Head Office. It's mine, you see. I'm the Head High Muckity-Muck Thingie. The boss."
"—love you forever, Draco," Potter was saying, a goofy, gooey Gryffindor look in his green eyes. "So, please
, a book that had rather mysteriously appeared in his bag one afternoon, recently. Didn't know where
He should've done more, but he was so tired, so terribly fatigued by the very thought of it. Likely only because he was actually physically exhausted; he never slept well without Harry. He didn't know what to do, how—when—where?
Harry, responding like an opium addict, cracked his jaw open as wide as he could pry it and angled his head for better access, arching his throat in silent submission. Malfoy wasted no time following his tongue with the rest of his excellently fit self; he'd pinioned Harry's wrists and was clambering to cover him in an instant, pressing Harry flat into the rug.
“Nope, nope, no sir! Not a thing, mate. Go on with you,” Nott nodded. “Celebrate Potter’s marvellous victory. You know you want to.”
told me all about it—showed me the candids, Hermione! He's bloody smiling at her, that little bi-bint—right in Madame Puddleby's! And she's got a bloody great diamond rock on her finger!"
Still. Harry wishes he’d done as Mills had and poured his glass of exceptionally nice red wine down his gullet before he’d yanked on his cloak and grabbed hold of a section of the old wellie Chaz was using as a Portkey. But he hadn’t and is thus rather wistfully entirely sober, with little to do but wait for the signal from the local Mage and stare up at the stars in wonderment.
"Now, you see, I—" Malfoy indicated himself with a poke to his chest, "snog you, and you—" and then he poked Harry, similarly, "love every sweet second of it. Alright?'
The wrist Harry had pinioned so fiercely turned counterclockwise in his grip and withdrew, tugging carefully away from Harry's clingy fingers. He'd expected as much and much sooner, really. Hadn't thought he could hold on forever. No one stayed forever, after all.
He bit down upon his lip, nearly sharp enough to draw blood, and shut his eyes reflexively against Draco's pointed stare. This entire situation was really rather humiliating; Draco was correct. They were seasoned Aurors and he never should have allowed it to happen. Especially since Draco was watching him as if he’d grown two heads already and was about to sprout a third.
"What?" demanded Weasley, flushing. "It's just an expression, for Merlin's sake. Shut the fuck up, Harry!"
. And I wasn't truly planning to brew the Amortentia, Harry—that was a placebo we made up, nitwit. Didn't do a fucking thing 'cept stink up my clothes. So you were safe, all along, alright? Don't let them tell you different; this is all
And here it was clear the other two were approaching their mutual culmination, judging by the growls, howls and high-pitched giggles they were making.
"Mmm-hmmm," Harry hummed, complacent, "sure you do, Draco," and Draco nearly shot his load then and there.
“So…” Draco breathed out a huge sigh, shoulders slumping. “You’re saying just do it and to fucking Hades with the consequences if it all goes to shit? If we were to end up hating each other--or just...just be indifferent? Not even mates anymore? I don't know if I can bear it.”
"Certainly," his Mum replied staunchly. "Stands to reason, Draco." Her tea was partaken of once more; she nibbled a Hobnob and cast upon him an inquisitive stare. "So, my darling dear, what exactly has occured that has caused you both to admit your mutual attraction?" His Mum, who was not by any stretch of the imagination ever particularly given to bonhomie, much less chattiness over personal details, beamed at Draco, her lazer sharp eyes twinkling. "And do tell, Draco—have you kissed him yet, your darling little Potter? Or have events moved well beyond that stage? I would hope so, actually—you are a Slytherin, Draco. Slytherins do not waste their time waffling about."
Now that Harry recalled, Draco had mentioned…well, he'd mentioned a very startling topic. Harry had rather blanked out on that bit, he'd been so startled.
He closed his eyes, for there was one place he could go—one location that was entirely secluded, a sanctuary of sorts.
Harry shuddered at the resultant noises Ron made, all of them, and kept his eyes steady on Malfoy’s soothing hair. Really, this was disgusting, Harry fumed. Too much fuss! Idiot Ron!
”, and oh my, but it was an invitingly whimsical summons, promising all good things in Nature.  Not creepy at all, no.
Draco raised his chin and rubbed fretfully at the scruffy stubble with a damp grubby palm. His eyes were red-rimmed, his immaculate self long since overlaid by a grey sort of fug, one that spoke of prolonged tension and sorrow. The flat was covered with a thin layer of dust, papers and clothing abandoned in every corner, carryaway boxes half-consumed and left ignored. It smelled. So did Draco's body, just a bit. He didn't give a fig; he deserved to smell bad.
“Well, yes,” Harry replied blankly, as if he was surprised to be even asked the question. “I’d not have said it if I wasn't, Malfoy. Um, where are you going? Because I’m not quite finished and you’ve not really said anything to the point. Like, um, you know, ‘yes’...or ‘no’?” He shrugged, blinking fast. “Well, hopefully not ‘no’, right, Malfoy?”
"Isn't it sweet?" Harry prodded at him, tickling Draco's perspiring ribs. "They're so in love it's gross, yeah?"
"Potter!" Draco spluttered. "Potter!" Or frothed, really—like Father, like son. "Potter!" He went red and only barely swallowed back a vicious Dark hex. "Potter, Potter,
Harry gasped in surprise, stumbling red-faced and panting through the open door and into their shared office. He huffed a loud breath and hastily dumped an armload of messy files onto the surface of double-sided desk they shared.
we could, Harry. It's just a little applied dexterity—and some slick. And we've got both, and—and I do want to try it, at least once. So we can say we did."
“Can we go now, please, darling?” Pansy asked, plaintively patting at Draco’s knee. “I require cocoa—and maybe a hot bath. I can’t feel my toes. They’ve fallen off, darling.”
Pain flashed through his temple, but he welcomed it. He needed to feel something. He only deserved to feel pain, he thought as he felt his heart begin to break.
Their eyes locked as Draco then fully entered Harry. His long, graceful cock slid to the hilt. There was a little pain, but Harry quickly grew accustomed to Draco’s size. Their bodies moved slowly at first as they found a rhythm they both liked. Their eyes never left each other; they both wanted to see what the other one looked like during sex.
After ending the short call with Hermione, Harry made his way back into the kitchen where he vanished all the rotting peaches and spoiled milk and eggs with a quick switch of his wand.  He craved to go back into bed, burying himself amongst the blankets and pillows. But he pushed through the craving. He had already wasted four days of the week. He didn’t want to waste any more time. Not that he had anywhere to be. He was ‘retired’ now. At 27, he fucking retired.
“It was the middle of the party when things went sour. Harry’s mood had shifted very suddenly. He’d gotten very sad. He’d tried to kiss Ginny I think or something. I think he just wanted some sense of normality and Ginny had always been that for him. Anyways, Ginny was dating Dean at the time and the kiss wasn’t welcomed. Ginny was in tears. Dean hit Harry. Ron hit Dean and then Harry. It was a bloody mess. I screamed at Harry for ruining my party, like some brat. And then we didn’t talk for like a month.”
After interviewing with a couple of adoption agencies, they’d decided on a private one that paired both wizarding and muggle families together. They knew that adoption wouldn’t be the easiest route, due to them being a same-sex couple and everything, but they remained confident in their decision. It took them almost two years before anything happened.
“Piss off, both of you!”  huffed Harry as he dried his hands on the back of his jeans and shoved his glasses back onto his face. He usually wore contacts when at work. It was easier to work out and train clients when he wasn’t constantly pushing his glasses up his nose as he sweated. He hated wearing contacts, though, in general, and instead wore his glasses whenever he could.
Neither dared to speak a word as they entered the moonlit room. Both their eyes falling on the large white king-sized bed that took up most of the room. Harry was glad he had decided to put on fresh sheets earlier. He hadn’t been thinking about sex at the time, but he figured some part of his subconscious had. He never changed the sheets if he was being honest.
“I’ll grab the mochas, you grab a table?” he asked, gesturing towards the line in front of the till.
Draco tore his eyes away from the grass and looked abruptly up at Hermione. Grey eyes bore into hazel ones. Draco raised an eyebrow before fusing them in a puzzled look. The statement was out of the blue and took him slightly off guard for a second.
Now, Harry felt rushed as he gave up on the tie and threw it into the black duffle bag on the bench behind him. He’d planned on taking his sweet time showering and making himself look perfect for tonight. But that idea was out the door now. After the mind-numbing long meeting had finally wrapped up, Harry had taken a quick shower before getting dressed. He was glad he’d chosen to pack his outfit that morning into his gym bag, just in case. He could’ve gone home, but then he’d be wasting more time than he wanted to.
Harry was awoken later by the ringing of the wards on the house going off.  He groaned and rolled over onto his back, blinking up at the ceiling. He didn’t know who was at his front door, probably some reporter or something he thought. His friends never used the front door, they always used the Floo.
An overwhelming feeling of guilt rippled through Harry as he noticed Hermione was barefoot and her hair was pulled back underneath a satin head scarf. She’d been sleeping, he realized. He bit down hard on his bottom lip as a fresh set of tears filled his eyes. He abruptly looked away from Hermione and her bare feet. It hurt too much to look at her. It hurt too much to think about waking her from her peaceful slumber just because he couldn’t fucking control his emotions.
Harry, if he was honest, didn't feel like eating. His confession had left him feeling rubbed raw and vulnerable. He was resisting old habits of retreating inwards on himself. He was fighting all his urges in order to keep himself from making some excuse and going home to bed. He needed this lunch with Draco. This was the normal social interaction he craved and dreamed about having. He couldn't shy away from Draco just yet.
Harry didn’t know if it the pounding of the beats from the music or the alcohol coursing through his veins or the beautiful grey eyes pouring into him or a mixture of the three, but he was suddenly overwhelmed with the need for more. Dancing was fun, but he wanted more of Draco. He wanted to feel his hands on his waist, roaming down his back to his ass. He wanted to feel those lips on his, sucking all the air from his lungs. He wanted to melt into Draco.
The bedroom was dark and damp smelling as he threw himself onto the bed. He immediately reached for the bottle of pills on the nightstand. He tapped out two pills onto the palm of his left hand and swallowed them dryly. The pills made him feel numb and groggy, he usually resisted taking his medicine, but today he welcomed the numbness that they brought. He just wanted to drift off into a dreamless slumber.
Harry didn’t reply and Hermione didn’t wait for one as she got up and made her way into the kitchen. She particularly made tea because it was a habit of comfort for her. Her mum had always brewed a pot of tea whenever she was feeling trouble or down. It had stuck with Hermione and was something she relied on heavily. Not only drinking the tea was a source of comfort, but the whole ritual of putting on a pot and waiting for it to boil. She knew that Harry would most likely not drink the tea. She knew from experience that Harry didn’t drink or eat when he was in a depressive state.
The most perfect, round, ripe peaches that he had purchased four days ago were bruised and rotting away. He’d left them in the large wooden bowl that Hermione had gifted him as a housewarming gift, in the centre of the kitchen island. Along with the milk and eggs.
Draco cleared his throat slightly as he pushed back his shoulders and tried not to let himself combust underneath Harry’s gaze. “You can always spoil me! Remember that! Birthday or not,” he said, winking playfully at Harry.
Both his therapist and Hermione had told him he needed to. Not only for his own self-worth but for Draco’s sake as well. His therapist said he needed to be more open about what was going through his head with his loved ones and that included Draco. Draco would need to know how and why Harry was acting the way he was at times. By telling Draco about his bipolar, it would help them both in the long run. However, as much as this did make sense to Harry, he just couldn’t find the words or courage to really do so. As much as he understood having open communication and so forth, he just thought it would lead to Draco leaving him.
“But you already gave me my gift.” Draco gestured to the shirt he was wearing. He hadn’t been expecting anything else from Harry tonight. He was aware that Harry didn’t make a lot of money with being a personal trainer, and the shirt had been somewhat on the pricey side already.
Harry was practically glowing by this point, he was in such a good mood as he walked into the produce section and his eyes immediately went towards the delicious selection of juicy, soft fuzzy fruit. The brunette couldn’t help but lick his lips at the sight of them. They were gorgeous.
The kiss was soft for a moment before growing in passion. Malfoy’s hands went to Harry’s hips as he pressed him up against the wall of the hallway. The blond let out a noise as his back hit the wall just as Harry’s tongue swiped along his bottom lip, before roughly prying open his mouth. Malfoy knew that Potter would be a good kisser, but he couldn’t quite get over the initial shock of it all. Potter’s lips were unbelievably soft.
“It means I like girls and boys and everyone in between,” explained Luna in her signature dreamy way. A small smile appeared on her face as she added with little pride, “I like people.”
Draco pushed open the door to find Harry curled up in the centre of the bed, hugging a pillow. He appeared to be asleep, but Draco wasn’t quite sure.
His boyfriend, Draco, had already texted him back, saying it was fine, but even with his boyfriend’s reassurance, Harry still felt like shit for running late. This was not how his night was supposed to start. He’d primarily planned on leaving work early. He’d even moved up his last client’s session by an hour so that he could leave the gym early for once and arrive at the party just as it was starting.
It was then that his eyes shifted over to the clock on the nightstand. He squinted his eyes and read out the tiny numbers on the clock. It was just past 2 in the morning.
Harry undid the small scroll which was tied there with a green satin ribbon. He gave the owl some treats before reading the message and quickly writing out a reply to the bottom of it.
Harry’s heart was racing as he stared into Draco’s eyes for a second before gathering up all his Gryffindor bravery within him and kissing the other boy on the lips.
“No,” Harry breathed out in a quiet voice. He was suddenly painfully reminded of Malfoy and their date. He bit down hard on his bottom lip as he felt a new set of tears fill his eyes. He felt ashamed and guilty all over again about how he’d ruined things between him and Malfoy.
Draco just looked at Harry in puzzlement before bagging the three perfect peaches he’d just found and placed them carefully into his basket, making sure not to bruise them. “Well, as fun as this has been, Potter. I’ll leave you to it.”
Harry nervously drummed his fingers against the kitchen island, glancing towards the clock on the wall before deciding to pour his tiny glass of wine now. He wouldn’t even drink it, he thought. Just holding the slender glass in his hands was comfortable enough for him. He took a slow inhale of the wine before moving into the living room. He had another hour to kill before Malfoy was due to arrive.
“Go away, Luna,” he spat, but there was no bite to his words. It was as if seeing Luna had broken something inside of him. He could never be angry or cross with Luna. She never treated him like the others did. He held the girl’s gaze for a second before looking away as another wave of emotion washed through him. He then violently wiped his eyes with the back of his hands, biting down hard on his lower lip, preventing a sob from escaping. He didn’t want to cry anymore.
Harry turned his head briefly to acknowledge the freckled face man. A wave of irritation washed over him at Ron’s statement. Ron’s teasing was the last thing that he needed at the moment. The other man's banter didn’t usually bother him. He usually enjoyed it and would volley back, but not today. He knew perfectly well that he should’ve left this god-forsaken place by now and already be halfway across town.
He didn’t enter Harry right away at first. He just pushed the tip of his cock into Harry, hovering there for a second before Harry’s hips thrust forward, encouraging him to go further.
“It all seems rather stupid and childish now. It happened just after Harry had been officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 1. They were still trying to figure the best course of action to take to stabilize his moods. He was on all sorts of meds at the time. His moods were all over the place. He would have one episode after another it seemed. Nothing was working…” Hermione’s voice trailed off briefly as she thought back to those early days where Harry’s moods would go from being super upbeat and happy to low and depressed rather quickly. “Anyways, it was also around the time of my 21st birthday. I wanted a big party with all my friends and family. It was two years after the war and everything, things were finally looking hopeful. My parent’s memories had just come back and I wanted to celebrate. The night had started well, everyone was mingling and getting along just fine. Harry was even having fun, which was a plus for me.”
“Oh,” was all Hermione could muster up to say. She could tell that Harry was upset about it and didn’t want to push the situation any further. The brunette continued to stare at Harry for a moment longer, before taking a long sip of her tea, cradling the warm mug in her hands.
Almost five years had passed since that grocery store run-in at the produce aisle. There had been some rocky moments over the years, but for the most part, things had been good for Draco and Harry.
He knew it was a rude question, but he was just generally curious. Harry wasn't the easiest person to deal with at times, especially when he was in one of his moods like he was today. He had only been dealing with Harry for a couple of months now but Hermione had been dealing with him for a lot longer.
“He needs to make himself look pretty first,” teased a thick Irish accent from behind. Both men turned and looked over at Seamus, another personal trainer, as he came into the locker room, smirking at Harry before going to his locker, besides Ron’s.
As Harry began to tap his foot along to the music, the lights flashed like lightning in the middle of a summer storm, and his eyes went straight to the middle of the dance floor. His eyes zoomed in on Draco. The blond looked striking as he moved his slender hips to the soulful beat. Harry watched, captivated as he pressed himself up to Pansy and began to sing along to the song.
“What for? So you can hold my fucking hand as I cry like a child!? I’m a bloody grown man! Mione!” Harry lashed out in annoyance at his friend.
“You too,” muttered back Harry as he slipped the ticket into his wallet and slid it into the back of his jeans. He glanced down at the screen on his phone to see if Draco had answered his text. Only the image of his lock screen stared back at him. He put his phone away then and moved towards the bar. He figured he would get a drink first before he tracked down the birthday boy.
That quote there, pretty much summed up his dating life. The people he brought home with him, man or women went to bed with one version of him but woke up to another.
“Yes, Mione, a fucking date!” Harry snapped. He ran his hands through his hair, pulling at the curls before dropping his hands to his sides. He looked down at his feet. He didn’t dare to look at Hermione. Harry hated how quickly he could lash out at someone with rage. He’d been going to anger management classes, but with his bipolar, it made his rage ten times harder to control at times. He wasn’t really angry with Hermione. His rage was more of the frustrating kind. He was frustrated with himself for not being able to have a proper fucking date.
That had been a thoroughly rotten series of events. Like the stench of three weeks old caribou gizzards rotten. But…
"Ron and Hermione? Oh, they're fine. Glad to see me, of course, and busy as anything--of course. Never a dull moment between them, I suppose."
He’d been startled into saying something in return. Something a little dirty, something a little risqué. Unthinkable, therefore to. And then Malfoy had said something clever back at him and Harry replied in kind, and it was banter. And three more paragraphs along of Slytherin-esque talk Harry had clued in they were flirting.
"That'll be a cold day." The reply was fast and flat, unemotional and spare. Spec lenses glinted at him, reflecting Draco's frown, the bags under his eyes. "In hell. That you should even consider I'd return to the debacle you've made our old flat. I'm not a fool, Draco. Do run along." Harry gulped, and seemed to stand a little taller, if anything. Draco took another step towards him, involuntarily. "Really. Be real, okay? You're not wanted here, Draco. Not welcome, got it? Go back to the fucking flat. Hell, sell the flat, why don't you? Burn it and all the contents for all I care. But
Judging it truly appropriate if slightly unkind, Harry turned to his friend with a glare. He provided him a more than decent thumping across the back and shoulders to clear the daft git’s airways. He may’ve struck his twisting back and broad shoulders a few more times than necessary and perhaps a bit harder than required, but Ron did deserve it. The breakfast table was in ruins and all the assorted Gryffindors were engaged in glaring at the three of them, muttering darkly.
Draco quailed. Why now did he have to be overcome with such debilitating fear? Why now, when what he needed most was the fine art of gentle persuasion?
Harry inched up on his elbows and took in the same sad and sorry sight his boyfriend had just freaked over: books upon texts upon parchments and scrolls, all damp and streaked, oily and sparkling here and there, as if they'd been dipped in lube and dusted with coloured glitter. In heaps and in piles and scattered far and wide, in a great semi-circle about the wobbly worktable's environs.
His friends resumed inspecting their fellow mate quite carefully, presumably safe via the small distance they’d made disassociating themselves from him physically, much as one would view a mad Erumphant from the environs of a magic carpet, observing as it rampaged about the Gardens of Magical Zoology.
Draco, swimming a rosy haze of anger and anguish, decided promptly he would remove the arse's gorgeous, touchable skin in small pieces and with a sharp dagger, dip it in a highly flammable acid, toss it in hot cauldron, watch it fritter 'round the edges till it was golden-brown, and then Incendio the remainder to ashes. Then, for good measure, he'd distill those same Potter-ashes to a fine liquor and spray it all over his mother's prized blue roses as fertilizer. Just to begin with.
“Of course, Mum; I’m listening." Draco sat up straight abruptly and nodded dutifully, recalled to his vaguely uncomfortable present. "Every word. Yes, I promise I’ll Floo him. And I'm sure he wouldn't ever, Mum. He's likely run off his feet, settling in. Now what was that about the Prince’s cousin? Oh, another distant Black relative...ah, right, right. Fascinating, naturally. Yes, yes, of course. Please tell me more.”
Silently, and without the teeniest creak, the door finished its grand opening arc, revealing an absolutely gorgeous suite, filled with lovely light, beautiful furnishings, delightfully aromatic scents, truly pleasing to the senses in every possible manner, and clearly the best possible place ever to house an Heir to the House.
Nevertheless, he muscled his way back into Harry's space again, sweeping an arm about Harry's back, and rather forcefully wedged Harry’s legs open with the hard bones of his hips and sank that eager dick of his a good two inches deeper—enough to leave Harry purring, almost without volition.
And there it was. Vincit omnia veritas. He had, it did, and it was mutual—oh, Merlin's Whiskers and Bollocks, it was mutual!—and Draco was in desperate need of some way of cementing that commonality before the eyes of the world. Because as strange as it was to behold Pottyhead as the object of his affections, it was stranger still to be consumed with bitter, burning bouts of insane jealousy over Harry's every spare smile—every and any small sign of concern or attention he lavished upon anyone other than Draco. The Mu-Granger, the Weaselbee, the—that blasted wench Weasleyette; all of them! Draco was bloody all claws and red canines when it came down to it, practically seething like a cauldron on a constant parboil over his prized Potter. And it was…it was horrid, to be so dependent—so unsure. From one day to the next he was never certain that Potter might not simply take a quiet moment to reconsider his choices. That the entire affair might all end as abruptly as it had begun, in a flurry of moulting feathers and an unbearably tense confrontation atop that stupid Astronomy Tower.
"Hmm," Harry hummed, unconvinced. "Well, then what do we do? I don't want to hand this over to Slug and have it be the wrong one, Draco. We still have tomorrow morning to ask her."
! came the sound of a Bludger and its unwary Ravenclaw target, as both spiraled away to the ground below, the latter shrieking like a bloody banshee.
"Wait! What?" Ron protested, but Granger was whispering furiously in his ear as the two of them pulled ahead, and in a minute, she glanced back at Harry and Draco, her smile a shade less tense, though still tentative. "There we go; alright now. An hour or so, okay, Harry? Then we'll meet up?"
Draco only shook off his feeling of vague foreboding with effort as he stepped out of the Three Broomstick's capacious hearth and made his slowly back to Hogwart's grounds. At least he had the ring in his hot little paw, though, as well as his Mum's hearty (terrifying!) approval, and he supposed that was all that mattered in the long run. He was now officially able and ready to tackle the hugely daunting task of asking Potter to bestow a lifetime of sharing upon him and that was something amazing, at least.
had sprung up from but it had hardly mattered—he liked it, and it had wonderful advice. Likely a passing shy fan had slipped it in his unguarded bag—maybe a Ravenclaw, even—but Harry couldn't be arsed to care about that. He was thankful, of course, for their kindness but then they never let up on him, did they?
"You," Harry sniped, face fox-narrow with matching fury, chin tipped in heady challenge as he stared straight into Draco's eyes, "won't have a choice in the matter. Don't, in fact. I've already left you, haven't you noticed? Been gone, weeks now I've been gone. I've. Left. You. Draco. Got it? It's a simple enough concept if you'd just
Draco trailed off, gesturing vaguely with the remote. Potter did not reply, as such. He turned another page instead, scanning it so fast Draco half expected his silly toad-coloured eyeballs to start spinning.
Nothing could, it seemed, not even Gryffindors. There were hordes of them, just as he'd feared, and they were certainly curious and not at all timid about quizzing Potter as to why he'd chosen Draco Malfoy, of all people, to accompany him to Hogsmeade. There were a few that were furious, as well: the gingers, male and female, and the Granger, who glared at him beady-eyed. But a quiet word from Potter and the chaperone's continual presence seemed to keep any outright aggression under control and Draco wasn't molested—too much—as he strolled along with Potter. It was hardly ideal, and not what he'd really wanted, but still…they had the day before them, and no reason to hide their 'togetherness'.
Go see Pansy? Now?” Harry exclaimed, starting forward again, clearly upset and just as clearly about to come after him, likely with the intention of stopping him.
"Arrghh!" Weasley was still hovering, and the rest of the Common Room was watching curiously, always ready to focus on the famed Potter-Malfoy rivalry and attendant altercations. "You're both seriously sick-making, you know that? Do, please, stop already. Get a room."
“Merlin, I hate you, sometimes,” Harry gritted tersely, glaring with all the firepower he could muster.
Harry giggled, and Draco hid a smile. He'd have shared it but he'd already given away his whole hand. No use encouraging Potter to believe he was a complete wuss…even if he was. But only for Potter.
"Yes." He said it simply and let his fingers do what they willed, wreaking damage upon the present Draco had gotten him. Gone in a flash and crunch-crinkle was the green-and-white striped wrap, the ribbon of contrasting scarlet satin coiled uselessly round his discarded mug, tangling. "Yes—and make sure to do yours, will you? Same time as me."
“Malfoy!” he snarled, his voice chock-full of warning. “Gitface, he’ll be back before we know it! You want to end up doing this up on Astronomy Tower? Do you? You know how fucking chilly it is up there, even in bloody June? The wind, Malfoy—the wind!”
“Yeah, right,” Theo muttered darkly, “if one actually cared about those things. Which, ahem, I must say
"You're so wide open and it's a sin, really. Likely I shouldn't take advantage, Potter—but that's not stopping me, alright?" Draco's usual voice had transformed into a weird combination of shaky and determined; it wobbled, which was unheard of. "You've sealed your fate, just now;" it dropped abruptly to a low, gritty rumble, menacing Harry if by implication of dire endings. "I hope you do know
Because of course it would. It would be smashing, actually. Go out to pubs, have a few drinks, perhaps even go clubbing? By Merlin, that was a much more attractive prospect than Portkeying his solitary arse off to Monaco to watch a herd of flying horses go 'round about over some twisty Muggle streets in the company of his mum and her bosom pals. Harry was also and incidentally a damned decent wingman, which he’d proved over multiple times during their Flamel years. Well, at least until he’d up and been recruited by the Ministry and before Draco had become more involved with Theo, but all that really wasn't to the point, these days. Nor was pulling.
“How so?” Millie cocked her sharp chin at him. “You know Eihwaz better than I do, Harry. It’s been cropping up far too often these last few weeks to be ignored as a mere fluke. That’s why I’m asking, seriously.” She frowned, a quick grimace that flitted away as quickly as it came. “I do actually care about your life, you know. At least a little. Stranger things and all that.”
“I was hoping you didn’t have plans," Potter exclaimed, breezing through the open archway leading from their entry foyer to the flat’s much larger kitchen/pantry area. He shed his Ministry robes over the back of a chair as he went, bypassing the closet meant expressly for purpose of storing such garb with nary a glance, and grinned merrily at Draco in his passing, giving him a mately slap on the shoulder. "Slept well, I hope?"
"What?" Hermione probed, scalpel-sharp, never missing a trick, a fleeting shift to her expression Draco couldn't quite interpret. Or couldn't be arsed to, actually. "What, Draco? You're laughing?"
"Sure you do," Harry scoffed, patently unimpressed. He barely flinched; didn't bother himself. "Right, then," he went on, supercilious and sarky as shite. "Pardon me, so much.
"But she wouldn't shut her gob about it, so I nipped round and whipped some cologne—lavender waters, and some lime rind and a few scarabs, crushed—made it sparkle. All to convince her to drop it—leave us alone—"
Instead, Harry chewed bran-and-currents mixed with teeth that felt as though they might crack with the pressure and ignored his mate with all his might, just as Hermione said. She should know, yeah? And it wasn’t as if he’d not endured torture before, right?
Draco, hunkering down upon his heels and haunches, schooled his face into an even stricter bland mask as the wave of tidal paternal ire rolled deathly inarticulate through the Floo, emanating like a freak tornado from the reserved ice floes of his parent's newly re-elegant Mansion.
"Better," he said. Draco simply nodded, smiling, letting his wandering fingers do the talking. They took a little pleasure stroll right into the warm creases of Harry's Muggle denim trousers, and right smart about it.
It was in the Altamira caves in Cantabria, and a little over a month into their tour that Harry spontaneously sorted the hard, nasty fact that, of all the many people he ached for, all the ones he so wished to see and to speak to, it was Draco fucking Malfoy he missed the most. In a
would, but still! You could be blabbing any old thing to random passersby and no means of controlling it!”
“Whose, mate? You don’t mean Dean’s, do you? They’re nothing special, Harry. I mean, he’s alright, I s’pose, but still and all—nothing special. Now, my brother Charlie,
"Oi!" Draco heard faintly behind him, the anxiety and surprise in the beloved voice clawing residual trails across his bruised heart. "Git, what in Hades are you doing? Come back here this instant!"
"I mean, I still want you—you're really fit, Draco. That's not changed," he gabbled. "The way you—and we're sort of compatible. I mean,
"…t's cruel," Draco could only protest it, this outrage. This…oddity. "That's...that's really cruel. Harry." His head sank down, slumping shoulders going with it. His whole body felt thinned out, compressed; he even went flat on his heels as if waiting for the carpet to swallow him. He clasped his arms about himself very tightly, to hold it in, his not understanding. This not-Harry. "I never knew you were…that you could be…mean, Harry."
“Well, yes, Pansy,” Draco nodded absentmindedly. “That’s how you do it, to stay astraddle when you’re cornering. Not that you’d know that, seeing as you despise flying.”
Nor heart, either. Draco was long past pulling Harry's chain in other ways; hadn't mentioned his Mum in ages. Likely never would again, after what his own Mum had done, either. That was alright, then.
"Ack!" He caught himself up again, gasping. "No, sorry! It's more...well. It's just caught up with me, what you said. Just now. You're truly home to stay? Not going instantly off again? That’s fantastic, Harry. I thought you were having me on, I really did.”
But that fling with Oliver was long over, naturally. One didn't keep a lover when one was Journeying. Not usually, at least. It was all too exhausting enough, already.
"Unspeakable. Yes, yes, I know," Draco sighed, draining his glass and setting it down. "Too, too well. Right. Carry on, then. So, how are your other two thirds doing? I swear, I've not been out of my damned manor for a month or more, Harry. I've no idea what's been happening in the world."
“Draco, you are an idiot,” Draco’s oldest friend in the universe pronounced in damning judgement. “You and Harry don’t have to do a single thing you don’t want to, and that includes shagging, and marriage, and children! You should both know better by now; I’m downright distraught with you.”
Draco straightened where he perched and stared beseechingly at Harry. But with a bone-deep hauteur, of course, because Malfoys always looked that way: po-faced, starched-up, lemony. A bit too high in the instep, they were. But Draco couldn't help it if his stupid face always sent mixed messages. He couldn't help if he never seemed to work out how to send all the right ones, at the right time, and especially to Harry. But Harry had never objected overmuch to Draco's manner, his usual methods; well, at least not after they shagged that first time. He'd understood, or at least it really seemed he had…until he'd simply not wanted to, one day. And then he'd walked out on Draco and all because of some misunderstanding that Draco still wasn't completely clear on.
by now. At the very least, mate; it's been a month already, you know," he chided, wrinkling his faded scar in disapprobation. "Exactly how bad is this 'trouble', really? Are you in any real danger?”
. K-Y. Love Juice; that slippery, sometimes edible goo Muggles used for their sex acts—or so the references said. The ones to be found in the Muggle adult shops, that was. The same ones he and Draco frequented ever more often when they had a free weekend and the opportunity to pop over to Edinburgh and browse the city for fun. Draco, as it had turned out, was an adventurous git; that old French chevalier blood in his veins must've contained some lowbrow brigand stock as well, as he was damned nigh irrepressible over certain things. Like sex. And Muggle sex shops were just the tip of the exploratory sexual iceberg. Draco had also dragged Harry off to view various homosexual pornos, all of them shown at dark little hole-in-the-wall back alley theatres, just perfect for a spot of one-off fun.
Draco gritted his back teeth, settling his heels more firmly onto the pavers. He wasn't going, no matter what Harry said. It made no nevermind. This was real as it got. This was his life, his and Harry's. He glared down at Harry—
Draco also nodded, wordlessly. Sighed soundlessly, eyes on the floor, shoulders slumping down and barely noticing just how sickly white was the skin of the knuckles on Weasley's punching hand, clenched so tight like that. His lips twitched wryly after a long moment, the faintest of scoffs coming out of the dark, dead space where his heart once beat so strongly in his chest.
"You. You don't trust me," Harry informed him gently, deceptively so. "You never did." The fury of angry voices was vanished; somehow this hushed conversation was just so much worse. "I don't think you even have it in you, honestly."
"Um, Harry…" he muttered, craning his neck just enough to glance fleetingly up into his lover's intent visage, "...come to think, I dunno about thi—
Or perhaps it was the stylish yet devilishly safe new play areas he’d discovered randomly distributed around the grounds during his morning and evening constitutionals. Sand and shallow waters in the one sunny place, a perfect array of what Draco immediately knew were ‘climbing trees’ in another shady glade. The child-sized maze made of honeysuckle and thornless yellow roses in yet a third, all a’flutter with beneficent, non-stinging insects. The mini-broom arena, the play castle, the nearly perfect replica of a Muggle play yard.
Draco nodded at this, but reluctantly, nose scrunched up and forehead furrowed. Frowning, or maybe just frowning all the more.
"Um." The young man in question scowled a bit more than he smiled, peering down at Draco with a distinctly perplexed set to his dark eyebrows. He poked Draco's upper arm with a hard forefinger. "Draco, um. Are you…are you alright, mate? You look funny, git. Do come up. This is weird."
"Huh," he snorted. "Hmmm, I don't think so, Potter; I think they've more limbs than the Squid does when it comes to standing about on them and objecting to me. They've never even so much as scowled at me halfway kindly, alright? I hardly think being boinked by their Boy will change that."
Draco smirked wider and harder than ever, till he was practically all over smirk, tip to toe. Harry scowled in return, purely out of habit.
"Indeed, I suppose I must confide I am…ah…pleased with this turn out, son." His mother's lips quirked in wry amusement behind the gold-leafed rim she peeked over. Draco sat up in a hurry; his mother seldom waxed lyrical concerning his actions, no matter how much she truly adored him. "Your choice is rather more than merely acceptable, darling—even I cannot deny your Potter is a bit of catch, these days. A very fit young Wizard, Draco, and really quite, quite above reproach in the marriage stakes, upon consideration. A champion, as they say. Excellent potential for a future Malfoy."
“Uh-huh,” Harry nodded eagerly, happy to agree. “We did indeed and I recall it quite well; I was the one who cast it. But he wasn’t in the room till after that point, it seems. Snuck himself in behind us in all the commotion and ducked behind that racketty old metal cabinet Professor Snarlph and his minions used for storage. Did a DisIllusionment.”
gripping Muggle mystery novel he wasn't really reading sent sliding carelessly away down the slippery cushions, his particular page lost in the shuffle. "Idiot, I told you, didn't I? More trouble than she's worth, La Brown. Tell me—is she any better yet? At least ceased with that horrible endless whimpering of hers? So tiresome, that; like a kneazle in heat. Loathsome. No wonder Finnegan left her."
"Surely," Malfoy replied, shifting his weight and casually standing back. "Take your time." His eyes shifted to Harry, who was moaning faintly where he lay splayed, green eyes wide and staring. "Thanks, then. I'll owe you, alright? Oi, Potter. What're
, particularly. Want that. Although Grimmauld seems to have developed different ideas, if the décor and diet are anything to go by.”
Namibia, the west coast of the African continent, close by Twyfelfontein, and he and the more than fifty other Mages are stood about in a loose circle, all under their various DisIllusionment charms. Harry and Luna, Millicent and Meneer De Oude stand in a huddling line, clad still in their various elegant dinner attire, having been pulled away by Chaz’s urgent summons mid-meal, and Harry shivers in the chill. Too, there’s an annoying bloody sandstone pebble already that’s somehow worked into Harry’s one dress shoe, chafing him.  Bollocks!
"Too true," Harry nodded, looking thoughtful. "I wonder if Tonks was like that, as a child? Your cousin."
“Oh!” Harry beamed at Draco, eyes alight. “I guess that’s it, exactly! I suppose I’ve missed that too, that feeling. You know what?”
"No, clearly not," Harry snapped, shifting from one foot to another and glaring. "Should've, obviously." He waggled his fingers, brushing it all off as if it were nothing, his lack of foresight in the matter of the wards. "Right. My mistake. But thanks for the reminder, Malfoy. I'll alter them as soon as you're out. Now, if you'll please to be on your way? Door's that way."
"That's a lie!" Draco lunged stiffly forward, hands first, desperate and incensed. It was such a lie, the worst ever! "I do
Measly burns and tiny scrapes, trailing sleeves caught inconveniently in doorjambs, legs that were apparently permanently Jelly'd when confronted by smooth, flat, easily navigable surfaces—tile and wood and flagstone, it mattered not, Harry could trip somehow and make himself an idiot. Too, there were the accumulated awful and gormless acts of fumbling his wand no less than three times in ten minutes in DADA, and always—and only!—when Malfoy was assigned to be his partner. The embarrassment of stumbling down stairwells he could normally tread blindfolded on a moonless night; the sheer humiliation of repeatedly whacking his shins and his no longer-very-funny funnybone on stray bits of armour and statuary. All of these incidents and more (too minor to dwell on, really, like the tangles in his hair that panged his scalp something fierce when he brushed it) plagued Harry Potter continually. It was as though he'd been cursed, and was left doling out a sulky sort of blame to the oblivious git who was the prime cause of it all. So, yes, he still technically 'disliked' Malfoy for having this horrid effect upon him…but only with a wry, unwilling fond affection, in part fueled by a creeping sense of karmic justice.
"I." Draco's jaw worked; he licked his own lips, feeling that they might be freezing. Funny, how cold one could be when one was burning up with a contrary fever. He'd never understand love—never. He just knew he could lose it. If he didn't say something—anything.
Harry rolled his eyes at her—and himself—in quick derision and limply fell back into a boneless heap upon the conjured rug Hermione had so thoughtfully Transfigured her pocket handkerchief into a while before. His friend abhorred (on staunch principle) sand and gravel and damp where they might possibly threaten her precious texts. Harry—who'd enough trouble with his grooming as it was, thanks—could only be happily thankful she was so prissily careful as to mind the welfare of bound parchment and dusty spines. He benefitted directly when she did; hence the thick woolen weave that lay between him and the moist, gritty ground of the shoreline. He was already mussed and leaf-littered and grass-stained after an hour's worth of merely laying about, dozing over DADA and keeping Hermione company; why make it worse instead of better?
“Well,” huffed Draco, “I don’t see how an outright flouting of my wishes is in any way to be considered ‘what’s best for me’, Mum. It should know by now that I’ve not had a sha--er! A date!” Draco blushed and backpedaled furiously; his Mum, quite happily divorced, was still a bit of a stickler. “A romantic partner, I meant, for blo--er,
"Love you, babe; easy now," Harry crooned sweetly, softly, his lambent green eyes fixed upon Draco's stormy rolling ones with every indication of ardour. "Breathe in, m'love. Breathe out—yes, that's it. I'll take it nice and slow—promise."
"Now be off with you and the very best of luck, son. Likely you'll be needing it. And don't waste another moment, Draco—ask him as soon as possible. It's best that way, darling."
He—well, Malfoy was once again taking Magical Creatures, which he'd not done in years; likely aiming for an easy NEWT, and thus he, Harry would be subjected to yet more wild-arse crazy Malfoy pheromones in the morning, straight after their shared Potions lecture. A double dose, then, with barely any time to recuperate before they trotted off to Transfigurations for an extended afternoon lecture. Throw Sinestra's required Astronomy practicum in the evening into the mix and Harry wagered he'd end up far closer to death via prolonged over-exposure to Malfoyshness than he'd ever been, back in the good old uncomplicated days of dodging absurdly powerful, completely mental, megalomaniac Wizards.
"You won't go?" Draco earned a bitter smile and a 'tsk!' "Huh. I'd've thought you'd be happy enough to. You're well shot of me now, aren't you? Don't even have to think up a good way to dump me. I've done it for you; aren't I just so helpful like that? Now," Harry snapped his fingers. "Stop faffing about and be off, like a good little boy. Show me your precious proper Malfoy manners and take your damned leave from where you're not wanted. We've nothing more to say. Not a dingle damned word."
“Well,” Draco said, staring about, sharp eyes picking out the newly updated and apparently now also Harry Potter-biased design features. “There weren’t. But now there are.”
But Harry didn't want that. He could hear Draco's teeth grinding even from where he stood poised to run after; his arms flung out wide and beseeching, his miserable face stretched in a pleading rictus, his forlorn heart thumping frantically away in his chest like a drum. He didn't want that; didn't care to be that helpless and stupidlyfeeble, needing his friends to hunt his ne'er-do-well, tempestuous lover down for him.
It was a bit horrible, all of it. The transformation. The feeling of being a stranger in his own home, being poked and prodded about by an unseen but powerful force.
"I didn't catch hide nor hair of her nor of anyone else when I was poking around." Draco cocked a cheery thumb, gesturing to the special Section-within-a-Section in Restricted that only NEWTS-level 7th and 6th Years had been provided access to. "No on up front either. All that time; must've been a half hour. I'd say you're shit out of luck, asking Pince anything. Missed the boat, Harry. Try tomorrow."
Malfoy cocked his chin, the one Harry longed to gnaw on, and sent Harry a long slow inscrutable look from under his smoke-tipped pale lashes.
!” he chanted, in time with the rest of the plebes, and felt not the slightest regret for indulging in the incredible rush of pleasure inspired by Potter’s stupendous feat. It was—it was glorious, what Potter could do on a broom!
Harry gasped with relief as he launched himself forward, across that intervening space. Like a rocket, like a missile, attuned to one target—the only other soul on the planet whose bloody interior bits matched up to his own so fucking perfectly, so utterly exactly, their fit was seamless.
The quality of Potter's gaze shifted, becoming a little more careful and several degrees more intense. Draco shivered just bit, under it.
"No, Mum, it's not quite like that--of which you are aware, so stop implying things--it's that I have a great deal of work before me and I really cannot just up and leave it at the drop of a broom bristle. Not that it won't be nice to see Potter again, of course."
"Well..." Harry tapped his chin with a considering forefinger, "maybe. I mean, the mandragora he talked about in Lecture today was helpful—at least we've narrowed it down. Shredded, dried, only use Tibetan pure. That's here, right enough—and so's the bile of an albino grasshopper. On the right track with those, at least—oi!
Then there was the Muggleborn bint and Weaslebee to contend with; likely they'd be climbing the walls by now, awaiting their Hero. Draco would be hexed to sodding pieces.
"No—" There was nothing to do but stuff his face into Harry's throat; keep it there, where it was warm and Harry's cool voice was muffled. "Harry, no. That's not true."
'Here' was the Place, the one Harry had been handed down from his dead godfather. The Place which looked ever so much…so much improved than when he'd been last, that glorious day Harry had moved out of Grimmauld and into their flat. At first glance he could see that, just staring blindly about. At second glance, Draco's eyes widened as they really starting taking in the sights. Things had definitely changed, and in such a short while, too.
“Ah…yes? I suppose,” he allowed warily after a long moment, even as the sensations of the fading Veritas Charm snaked through his intestines and straight up his gullet, pushing and shoving. "Umph!"
“Infirmary,” Luna answered simply, wordlessly holding out her own mug for a top-up. She shook her head carefully, wincing as she did. “Pepper Ups and a full day’s rest, the Healer said. Poor thing.”
That is, the newly refitted, absolutely darling Nursery suite, which sported both the lovely old heirloom Malfoy cradle and a spanking brand-new Muggle-adapted Spello-O-Mind baby monitor, and abounded with a symbolic yet soothing updated décor of great fecundity, all comprised of various flora and fauna, Magical and Muggle, gaily frolicking and disporting, sprouting and blooming and fucking bounteously fruitful.
Well…perhaps there weren't that many, but Harry might not know it. He might not see that Draco was key to his happiness. Prat was not all that difficult to seduce, after all. Draco had accomplished it and it had only required a little effort—and his wings, of course. Harry really was quite fond of them.
Harry nodded instantly, though not quite certain how he was to go about that. The post-Voldemort Ron Weasley was a bloody firecracker. Highly volatile. He jabbed at his friend’s ribcage for starters, using Hermione’s elbow tactic.
"I know—but is it the one he wants us to find, Harry? That'd be the crucial question, least to me. He's not exactly given over enough clues, has he? Barking Toad eggs are used freely, for one. Kneazle fur from a male calico is another—all common as your average armadillo ichor, really. Both have been listed for every damned Potion we've found so far.
“Of course,” Luna beamed. “My dear, if you’ll come over nearer me, we shall try the Hygieian on them, using the concerted cast method. You know it?”
“Oh, Malfoy,” Ron crooned passionately, his honest, open, wouldn’t-hurt-a-fly expression taking on a decidedly faux-lustful glaze. “Oooooh, my Slytherin Sex Machine! My Ice Prince! Do let me pet your beee-you-tif-all hair, Draaaco darling! I want to touch it; wanna’ run my fingers through it, you great sexy git! Ooooh! So silky!”
"Well, son, I cannot provide you all the ins and outs of it, but rest assured your Grandme're's ring shall bind you and your Harry much more intimately than you can even imagine." Narcissa winked at her son, a sign that the entire world had run mad and frothing. "You'll be all the more connected, Draco, in every possible way. You'll see."
“Yeah! Can’t we go now, mate?” Theo piped up, finally showing some form of animation. “Potter will win it, of course. He always does. And Ravenclaw’s such a dead bore. Always strictly regulation.”
"Hardly, Father. Potter's intentions are honourable, I'm sure, even if a little misplaced. There will be a Bonding, one day. When it's suitable."
“Yes, Mum. I said I would, didn’t I? First thing tomorrow. But don't count on me for the races, please.”
"Draco!" Harry seemed frustrated, leaning forward with a palm cupping his one ear. "Draco, I can't hear a word you're saying, git. Stop that infernal flapping and do get your arse up off the damned floor now—come on!"
Weasley calls up Daphne and Millie as well, complimenting them on their political science and economics degrees respectively.
“Now we both know you wouldn’t enjoy that. There’s a loo on the second floor, first door on the left.”
Draco jerked back at the sudden sound of a hoot. His stomach lurched as the whole room stared at them. But then Granger smiled and Weasley laughed. Ginevra collected galleons from Finnigan and Thomas. And the party’s focus moved on as if former nemeses kissing was of no consequence at all.
Turns out, the first door on the left is not the loo. It opens into a large bedroom, where a very naked Harry-fucking-Potter is rumaging in his bureau drawer, perfect arse on display. He startles and turns.
“Well, I probably wouldn’t have been such an angry prat if I hadn’t been parroting my father’s pureblood bullshite. Probably would have had more real friends, enjoyed school more.”
It’s odd at first, but then stupidly easy to tell him about my life. How McGonagall pulled strings to get me admitted into Oxford’s Potions Mastery program. About my thesis on Wolfsbane.
The article analyzed a series of dragon drawings that might have been done by a seven-year-old, except for the hints of high level magical coursework at the edges. These were obviously doodles Potter had done on his class notes. It didn’t take Slytherin cunning to put it together: whoever had stolen Potter’s backpack had passed the doodles on to
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick entered the eighth year common room and pushed past the gapping, pajama clad students on their way to the loo. Draco, Potter, Granger, and Weasley entered the room behind them.
Potter snorted, then, turning to look at Draco's expression, broke out in a genuine belly-laugh. “Fuck, Malfoy,” he breathed, pressing his arm once more against Draco’s.
But then, Potter is pulling himself out of the pool. Water drips down his bare back as his muscles flex with the effort of lifting his body. His arse looks just as amazing in the tight, crimson trunks as it did without them. As he moves to stand beside the equally wet Weasley, I can’t help but mentally compare them. Weasley’s clearly bulked up in Auror training. I’m not really into that, but I can admit that Granger’s a lucky woman. Potter, however, is still slender and lanky. He’s lost the underfed skinniness of his youth and now has the trim build of someone who’s active, but not obsessed about it. Rather annoyingly my type.
The mystery caused a scene the next Friday, as Draco arrived at breakfast only to be nearly trampled as Weasley and Granger stormed out of the Great Hall with all eyes following them.
Granger had been reading the memoirs of Gethin ap Hywel, who had apparently fancied himself quite the lady killer, and had lived in what was now the eighth year dorms in the 16th century. Despite restrictions on student communication with members of the opposite sex, ap Hywel had managed epistolary affairs with a number of married women during his time at Hogwarts.
Draco entered the castle through the herbology classrooms and walked along seldom used halls. The eighth year common room was thankfully empty when he arrived, the tables and couches strewn with various study materials abandoned as everyone went to dinner.
“No, Merlin, Potter! Because I have no interest in the sexual antics of your friends. And I certainly wouldn’t sell the details to a trashy tabloid. I may have been on the wrong side of the war, but I still have class.”
Draco hurried past the ‘House Unity Board’ with Powell’s photos of students ‘caught being united’ and down the long corridor of tiny bedrooms to the communal lavatory. For the most part, Draco was quite pleased with the eighth year dorms. He was thrilled to have his own bedroom, but the shared lavatory had taken some getting used to. When these dorms had been in use, witches were not allowed in mastery programs, hence only one loo. The Roman style communal bath had been converted into private shower cubicles to accommodate modern views on group nudity, but it was still very odd to see a woman brushing her teeth next to him while he used a depilatory charm.
Soon, Weasley jumps up on a table. “Your attention please!” he booms. “We’ve all gathered here today to honor three wonderful ladies.” He smiles broadly at Granger, who bites her lip in response. He pulls her up with one hand. “First, my wonderful fiancee! She’s brilliantly managed to become qualified in both magical and muggle law in only four years.”
It’s possible that we snog on that bench for quite some time because when we get back to Grimmauld Place, Pansy is sitting on the steps looking worried. But she smiles when she sees Harry and I walking side by side.
“Thanks for the talk, Draco,” Potter said, placing his hand on Draco’s knee with a slight squeeze. He stood and walked off into the night.
Draco turned to face Potter, standing tall with all the superiority he could muster. “I would not touch Granger’s underthings for all the gold in Gringott’s.”
Potter calls on Cristiana, who chooses truth. He’s clearly trying to clean up this game as he asks her about the most embarrassing outfit she's ever worn. Turns out, it's a Christmas dress her grandmother had made her with a truly excessive number of bows.
Zacharias Smith continued to accuse Draco, and, from the increase in dirty glares, it seemed most of the castle believed him. Except Potter. He never spoke up to defend Draco in public, but Draco noticed that Granger and Weasley weren’t glaring at him anymore either.
Entering the lavatory, he found Lavender Brown meticulously putting her hair in curlers. Draco restrained himself from commenting that she spent entirely too much time fussing with her hair for a girl with extensive facial scars. He was trying to be a better person after all.
. Only eighth years and professors could have gotten in their dorms to steal the backpack and photograph the pants. Draco was the only one nefarious enough to do it. He was frequently seen walking around the dorms suspiciously. And he clearly needed the money after the reparations his family had been forced to pay. (Draco declined to counter that money was never going to be an issue with all the creative ways his father had hid funds over the years.)
The way Weasley’s chest puffed with pride made Draco slightly nauseous, but he had to admit, it was a damn good idea.
So I extricate myself from the conversation and lean against a wall as unobtrusively as possible to examine the room itself. Grimmauld Place was the home of the Blacks, so I was here a few times as a child, before Great Aunt Walburga passed. Frankly, this house used to scare the shite out of me, and I grew up in Malfoy Manor.
He peered inside the alcove, noticing the same symbol on bottom. He ran his fingers around the edge, then lifted the bottom tile like the lid of a box. Underneath was a sheet of clear crystal. He placed his palm on it, jerking back suddenly when a bright light flashed through the crystal.
Weasley stepped forward. “S’true. It took a while to sort it all out, but she confessed to the whole thing.”
After his encounter with Potter, Draco began properly investigating how information was being smuggled to the magazine. He read books on Hogwarts’ security and surreptitiously questioned Flitwick about charms to disguise text. Draco told himself he was doing it to clear his name and beat Granger, but really he had this intense, protective need to help Potter.
He tried to think through the significance of this alcove but, between the late hour, the earlier adrenaline rush, and the fact that he was standing naked in a cold spray, his brain wouldn’t function. The only thing he could think of was to carefully close it up and set an alert charm so he’d know the next time it was opened.
magazines. Draco’s efforts to look over his own notes were severely hampered by the fact that Potter was looking over his shoulder. Potter’s warm breath on his neck was so reminiscent of the night before that he really wasn’t sure the words in front of him were even in English.
“I think I’ve always known.” Draco paused, calculating how much to share. “But I was sure in fifth year when I found putting my hand in Pansy's pants thoroughly distasteful."
Suddenly, Potter pushed his text off his lap and threw up his hands. “What is the fucking difference between minced and diced?”
Draco felt heat rush over him, eyes locked with Potter’s. Never, in a million years, had he thought that Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, could be queer. That they could have this in common. It had taken years for Draco to figure out why he was fascinated by Potter, to realize that his desire to torment him was born from not knowing how to handle his attraction. But by that time it was too late for him to do anything about it. They were on opposite sides of a war, and there had been so much violence between them, and Potter was, by all accounts, straight. And now, to realize that Potter also might fancy men. The implications made Draco’s head spin.
“I calmly informed our headmistress that Powell was the one selling gossip,” Draco drawled, arms crossed over his chest.
had cleaned up its reporting and now focused on ‘factual journalism,’ meaning no more celebrity gossip.
I affect nonchalance as I follow Pansy. She embraces Daphne, Millie, and Granger, congratulating them. I follow suit, although I only shake hands with Granger. When this whole friendship thing started, I made a point to apologize to Granger for being a bigoted arsehole. She accepted. Now she seems to go out of her way to make me feel welcome. I think she has a bit of a thing for a redemption story.
Over the next few weeks, Draco found himself beside the Golden Trio more and more often. Sometimes researching ways to smuggle information, but also just… socializing. (Something fifteen-year-old Draco would have found absolutely impossible.) He was utterly shocked to find himself enjoying working through Arithmancy proofs with Granger. Weasley was a surprisingly cunning chess opponent, and, despite his strange allegiance to Chudley, had insightful things to say about Quidditch.
The sensation of Potter’s arm against his made Draco feel like he could do anything. “What about you?”
The symbol on Gethin ap Hywel’s memoirs. The man who had secretly sent dirty letters while living here.
After that, Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep without a very cold shower. So despite the late hour, he gathered his toiletries and went to the communal loo. He was relieved to find it empty, allowing him to waffle between misery and joy in peace.
The assorted eighth years only looked back at him in confusion. Granger and Weasley joined him at the table, picking up their things and looking around as if said backpack might suddenly appear. Draco sat down by a window and opened his Arithmancy text again.
“Doesn’t know what he’s missing.” He raises an enquiring eyebrow. “What would have been different for you?”
“I said I didn’t take it, Potter. I have no desire to read your homoerotic fantasies.” Draco had meant it as a joke, something to lighten the seriousness of the accusation. But Potter’s head snapped up, his eyes wide and brown cheeks darkened.
I clap politely as the rest of the crowd hoots and hollers. Granger really is quite intelligent. I’m fully aware that I was an utter prat about it in school. My inability to score above her called into question everything my father had taught me about blood superiority. I handled it poorly to say the least.
Pansy Parkinson is a lying, scheming bitch. Which explains her shit-eating grin and why I find myself having just apparated outside of Number 12 Grimmauld Place as a black motorcycle pulls up to the curb.
He leans closer, resting his hand on the bench behind me, smelling amazingly of whisky and sun. “Can I kiss you?”
Draco shoved the loose shower divider in frustration. It fell, revealing the original tile wall of the Roman bath. One large tile, just over where the edge of the old tub would have been, was inscribed with a double heart, one shadowed behind the other.
Potter asked Pansy to invite me? I'd thought this was some daft plot of hers to socialize me or incite reconciliation or whatever.  But Potter was behind it?
The party had devolved into a series of toasts led by increasing tipsy Gryffindors standing on tables. Longbottom jumped up onto the toasting table, managing to gain his footing only with the help of two Weasleys. He turned to Draco and held up his glass. “To Malfoy, who saved us from salacious gossip!”
After another too-long moment Draco averted his eyes, idly examining his hands where they lay clasped. They seemed oddly nervous and somewhat artificially posed so he promptly folded them neatly in his lap, uncrossing his legs and sitting forward.  The armchair was comfortable enough but
“Famished, actually,” Draco smiled, gratefully accepting the glass of wine handed him. "But thank you. Throat was a bit dryish." He cast his light cloak carefully over the back of a convenient armchair, peering more closely at his old mate. “Hmm. You look harried, Harry. Haunted, even. Aright there?”
No, a Malfoy was a Malfoy, after all, and bright as a bloody banner waving ‘surrender!’ when it came to notoriety. Fuck, Malfoys even liked it—the Press. Clamoured after it, the gits. Even he admitted there was not a thing he could do to cover up a Malfoy and keep him hidden safely away, safely stashed for his own personal grabby-handed delectation. Not a bleeding thing.
“Of course there are, Draco,” Pansy said, face going stern as she returned to her stick-work and worked on a tricky bit of furling yarn this way and that. “There’s always consequences. I should know, yes? But it’s your heart you must follow. Do what you really truly want to do, Draco. Life is too bloody short not to.”
“Not anymore, I don’t,” Draco hissed grimly at Harry’s ear, urging him up the marble steps all the while. “It’s resisting every incantation, even the Blood ones, and the ones you showed me last week at dinner no longer do a fucking speck of good. Believe me, I've tried them on my own, repeatedly. They may work for your tawdry Grimmauld but they do nothing for my Nursery. I need you here, Potter, and you need to do the casting for me. It's all I can think of to try, now. You know them better than I--Hermione taught you the wand movements directly via floo call, you said--and besides, we both know you’re the more powerful Wizard of the two of us.”
"Yes, love. Whatever you say." Harry nuzzled him, cuddling into Draco's taller form like a puppy, his gorgeous green eyes closing in delight. "'Cause you're mine, right? Very much mine, aren't you, Draco? All mine."
The recently resettled Gryffs began to turn heads and gawk. Harry blushed red as the jam Hermione had spread on her toast.
!" Draco barked. He was mortified. All this effort and Harry was not even minding the most crucial event of them all—a Real Honest-to-Merlin Proposal, from a genuine Pureblood. A
“Oh, yeah. Um, oops!” Harry flushed, nodding apologetically at Nev even though he was in no way guilty; that had all been Ron, the demon. Still, Harry hated to rile his dormmate, who was still a bit accident-prone. Why make Nev’s life yet more difficult? He’d enough on his hands, dealing with Ron’s little sister. “Sorry about that, mate. Won’t happen again.”
He threw up his hands, uncaring that he was still clad in his muddied outdoors working robes and his saggiest, oldest wellies and not at all dressed to be in the presence of the recently installed Head of DoM, even via a casual Floo call.
"Bosh! And of course I have!" Potter remonstrated, keen eyes telling over every part of Draco's person intently, from polished boot tips to buttoned-up collar. "Ah, you look the same, bloody wanker. Natty as ever and still smirking. Fuck, but's a treat to have you here. Tea, was it? Or do you need something stronger? You're a bit ghoulish, for all your smart robes. Are you sleeping? Oh, hang on.”
Draco laughed, hand rising to his throat to tug off his tie. "Hmm. Y'see, I'm intrigued. There's possibilities to this situation. Excellent, brilliant possibilities, the sort we don't come across nearly often enough."
“But—but…did you at least catch that last move of Potter’s?” Draco demanded, quite unable to keep his bubbling excitement contained. “That, my friends,
Seizing the moment, Draco descended gracefully to his kneecaps, just inside the Great Hall's double doors. Everyone who was anyone, and even those who were not, had already been gathered; the first course served and gaily-tea toweled garbed Elves were unloading lashings of champagne on the multitude of guests. The mood was blithely ecstatic; people couldn't wait to see what Harry Potter would do next.
“Yes, shut it, Potter,” Draco said, clapping a hand over Harry’s mouth. “Let her speak, then. Hermione?”
The Muggles—the ones who even noticed, for they'd all business of their own to mind—chuckled along, almost without volition. It was Christmas, after all, and the first snowflakes blew brilliant through the open door. Like crystal cobwebs, cartwheeling madly—madly. And melting upon the crest of warm air that carried them, as the two men were melding together, seamless and shining.
Like a burr under his saddle. It tickled away at him, at his consciousness, day and night. He was attracted, he was smitten, he was caught and
“A Picasso? It is, yes," Potter smiled affably enough. "It was a  recent gift; thanks for asking. Grateful client, very American, you know how they are. He bestowed it upon me personally and I couldn't refuse. Not politic, right?"
"Mmm—oh, Harry—no! No, it's a lot of magical draw but we manage, together," Draco assured him, laying out his long arms along his lover's to keep them still. "I...I think." The nipple twisting was wonderful but horridly distracting. Besides, they'd bigger fish to fry. "No, I'm sure of it, actually." Their fingers curled into and through, twining lovingly. Draco dropped a constellation of kisses across Harry's hairline, encouraging him silently. "In fact, I
"Then...you'll go?" he asked aloud, his voice quite deliberately bland. He did want to make sure Potter understood what he was asking—
Runes, of course, as the UK Wizards understood them. So, some derived from the Norse and some from the Picts and then the Romans, the Druids and various tribes and bands that had occupied the Isles over time. But not only those. Harry learnt of others. The larger world was full of many different sorts: the staves of the Baltic areas, the worn-away glyphs and faded pictographs, the markings and scratchings on tipped-over standing stones, the painted ochre and charcoal handprints found hidden away within caverns and mounds. All of these and many, many more, in Europe and Africa and all the continents--they had spoken to him. The magic of those ancient Elder messages shouting out, down from the times even before mankind--and Wizarding kind--had even begun to bury their dead, all of them called out to Harry, and he could not help but to
she was off at a trot towards the castle and Harry was left gaping at her jaunty arse cheeks under her newly well-fitting school robes, turned pertly toward him as she made her way back to the Great Hall. She was practically skipping, Harry noted, vaguely affronted. How…weird of her.
"Yes, Ron," Harry cut in wearily. Draco only rolled his eyeballs. "It is and now we'll prove it to you. Right, so…ready, everyone? Let's go."
Both students craned their respective necks, staring about them again for any signs of sapient life, the whisper of their nearly inaudible Seek spells falling away into the comfortable silence of a hundred thousand spines and a million plus pages. There was only the hush of books at rest and respiring, musing through their own ToCs and finally at ease after a long day of students manhandling them. Nor were there any muffled squeals or giggles to be discerned from swotting Firsties, nor the shuffle of rapidly riffling leaves turned by speed-reading Ravenclaws—peaceful, it was, in the Hogwarts library…
It was three weeks to the dreadful Tuesday later Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger staged a sort of intervention. In Harry and Draco's flat but not with Harry present, naturally (he'd moved out, on Day 254). Only with one Draco Malfoy, the recent 'ex'. He'd stayed, ever in denial, ever hopeful. Counting days and moping something fierce. ('Pitiful', Zabini called it, the insensitive lout.)
"Let me hex him, Harry!" Gin-appearing mysteriously at Harry's elbow joint—took the opportunity to poke a supporting elbow into his ribs, eyes sparkling with a frightening fierce form of minatory sisterly protectiveness. Harry shrugged it off, casually enough;
™ lip-gloss he'd discovered on one of Harry's shirt collars of an evening and he absolutely would not tolerate Harry ditching a quiet dinner at home with his partner to plod over yet
But Harry had never teased—Harry never would. Harry was so brutally honest, even when he was lying. Draco could read him; Draco knew him because he needed to, he must, to make sense of his world and his place in it.
They were private and cosy-warm, within. Harry caught a glimpse of sizzling grey eyes as Draco gnawed his way across his throat and simultaneously pumped his hips. Harry lost track, his expression twisting into mindless glee as he was wrestled about, legs flying. A hungry snarl sounded in his ringing ears—but more in his head, or perhaps his chest.
"What?" he gulped hard and forced himself to look up, finally. Only to see a pale Draco Malfoy, eyes brilliant, smiling giddily. "What, Draco? Don't you like it?"
“Umm…” Harry squinted off into the the corner of their office, mentally calculating out what the Healer had told him. “Um, fifteen minutes or so, maybe? A little more? A little less?” Looking back at Draco, he quirked his lips hopefully, willing the other man to relax. “Not long, though.”
He paused, telling himself it was for proper conversational emphasis, but really, it was more he needed to take stock. It wasn’t only Harry who was more than a little miserable and irate.
Harry, however, had a pensive and earnestly thoughtful expression. He was nodding his head, very, very slowly, and he and Malfoy seemed to be holding a conversation of sorts, silently, purely via some sort of intense close-range staring contest. Finally, he raised a brow inquisitively at his longtime archenemy…and friend.
"Oh, no," he chuckled, when he'd caught his breath, gay and droll in the face of Draco's utter bewilderment. He gasped, stung to the quick. This was not his Harry; this stranger, all cold-eyed and flinching away as much as he could in close quarters. Laughing with no humour. "No, no,
Harry's expression went blank, as he considered briefly the consequences of grabbing one of those perfectly cobbled loafers: a twist of the ankle would send Malfoy tumbling down atop him…and it might be considered an accident, his inevitable rough grope. He'd give most anything to get his fingers on that arse, even a thorough hexing by a brat of an ex-Death Eater. Malfoy smelt so very good, it was heady—intoxicating.
"Yes, you git," Harry chuckled, from his vantage point high up over the grounds of Hogwarts. He peered about him. Draco was nowhere in the Castle, so he must be elsewhere—and Harry could practically feel him close by. "He does indeed like the shagging! And your bloody cock!"
“I have,” Luna smiled. She rose to her feet, casually stepping back into her shoes and spelled her cup clean with a lazy wave of her wand. “Here you are, Millicent. Harry, if that’s all?”
“Draco, darling,” Pansy whinged beside him, “do we really have to stay through the whole thing? Really,
Draco snorted softly, waving a careless hand; the annoying issue of his boyfriend's likely highly dangerous future occupation could be sorted later. There were more immediate things to deal with.
“You look it,” Draco observed gently, quickly and quietly making his way round the desk to Harry’s side. “I’m sorry I shouted, Potter,” he added, laying a warm hand on Harry’s shoulder and giving it a careful squeeze. “But I really am concerned, you know. Auror business aside, Veritus Charm--even a ‘tiny’ one, cast by a minor--leaves a person vulnerable. And I value your hide, whether you realize it or not.”
“Oh, come on, Hermione, give the fuck over,” Harry replied, coming to Draco’s defense instantly. His green eyes flared with anger behind the frame of his specs. “Stars or no stars, he’s got a life already. A perfectly nice one, thanks. He doesn't require children to be happy. Nor do I, and it’s a bit harsh of you to imply it.”  He made a vaguely disappointed face at Hermione, who countered it with a completely deadpan stare. “Not everyone needs or wants what you have, alright? Nice as it is.”
them, going at it like bloody rabbits, right after each other. If they so much as say a single word against you from now on—"
“Best think fast, Draco.” Pansy rose, stuffing her knitting into a little bag tucked next to the sofa. She widened her eyes at him, tilting her pointy little chin in a challenging manner. “He's not a bad catch. I’d hate to see him forced out on the open market--and then there you'd be left behind, darling, moping about in your rut and wondering why life hates you. Let’s avoid that scenario if at all possible, shall we?”
"Ah? Obvious?" Draco gulped, which must have caused the choke of surprise that overcame him. "A decade? Ah-ah-excuse me?" He blinked at the blandly beautiful face across from him, confusion resolving to a dark scowl. "Mum, whatever do you mean? I would hardly call this turn of events obvious! Nor expected! It's Potter, Mum—Potter! I didn't even think—would never have—"
Harry jerked his head in the affirmative, biting his lips to keep them from flapping on about precisely how much ‘better’ all his feelings for Draco were now. “Mmmrgh!”
own that height, those ranks of manly toned muscles. The sheer stone of him—the way it all flew together into someone highly desirable and heavy as a pile of boulders when sleeping.
It left his groin feeling hot and heavy—swollen, as if ripe. It sent his life blood in a crazykart race through his over-worked veins. It rocked his Gryffindor sensibilities into a Hufflepuff reel, dizzy and breathless in its choppy wake, and then jerked him after it as deftly as a hapless puppet on a twisty string. All the fine dark hairs prickled wildly on his nape in gleeful static when he chanced to see
Flustered beyond reasoning, Draco shouted out the first thing that came into his head, going all hot and then cold, totally feverish; one thought and one only had entered his mind and he clung to it, like a Nargle to its favourite mistletoe sprig:
did?” Draco countered quick as lightning, his casual survey turned vastly more fierce in intent. “Right, then. What for, Potter?” he demanded, shifting his arse about in his seat as if he were making ready to jump up, stride 'round, and conduct his own very thorough examination of Harry’s person. But he caught himself up instead, settling for scowling like a thundercloud and jabbing his quill point at Harry accusingly.  “I see no new scars, no bandages, no blood on your robes--nothing! What in Merlin's name happened to you? You were supposed to be not even a minute behind me, Apparating out! How could you possibly manage to injure yourself in that short a time?”
"Sod off," Weasley said casually. "Just so you know, Pansy's coming over to retrieve you if she feels she must. She fancies this plan, Malfoy, so you've only yourself to blame."
“R-Right, stop it.” Draco got his head together and ordered Harry, as staunchly as he could manage whilst awkwardly wrestling with the gawping, sniffling idiot intent on simultaneously clinging leech-like and also scrambling frantically to get as far away as possible. It was bloody confusing as fuck and he was flat out of patience. “That’s bloody enough of that, alright?” Merlin, he’d dearly love to snog Harry again but not like this--never like this. He grasped Harry's biceps and gave him a shake instead, scowling. “
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle to himself as he got dressed and caught his reflection in the full-length mirror on the back of the wardrobe door. Somehow by not paying attention to what he put on, he had subconsciously picked the brightest and loudest piece of clothing he owned. It was a rainbow tie-dyed shirt with a happy face on it. There was no better shirt to reflect his upbeat mood this morning than this one. He thought briefly of changing, thinking it was too loud, but quickly decided against it. He liked it.
Draco smiled softly at Harry as he noticed he was awake. The blond was still dressed in his clothes from earlier. “You’re awake.”
“Do you want to get ice-cream?” asked Harry as they stumbled out of the restaurant together and into the warm summer air. He ran a hand through his hair, while the other nervously adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose which had begun to slip down.
Harry let out a moan as a wave of pleasure surged through his body at feeling Draco’s touch on his scalp. His cock was rock hard and pushing painfully against the fabric of his briefs, but Harry ignored it. As painful as it was not to reach down between his thighs and pump himself as he continued to mouth at Draco’s. He didn’t. He waited.
"…G-Good," Draco confirmed, nodding. His heart sank ever so slightly but he told himself that was only reaction to all this unforeseen stress, and then fervently thanked all the old gods this Kingleshocks person wasn't hovering about to witness him losing his composure—and if not marriage, precisely, then what exactly did Potter—Harry?—mean by giving him a ring? Rings were for…special people. Er, Bonded or 'to-be-Bonded' Witches and Wizards. Not…just friends. Lovers, perhaps, but emphatically
“Okay, Harry,” Hermione gulped and then nodded tentatively at her best male friend. “If you say it is, then I suppose…maybe…so. Er, Lake water like.”
"Right, right," Draco shrugged, "fine. You track her down if you need to. I'm not so sure she'll even be useful."
"Right, sure thing..." Draco tilted his head to focus severely upon his idiot Gryffindor boyfriend. The one who had great plans but sometimes neglected the finer details. "And how, exactly,
"And bet on it, too," Finch-Fletchley murmured slyly. He nudged MacMillan, who'd passed out earlier, during Round Two of Truth or Dare, and was right on the verge of blacking out again. "Right, Ern?"
"Yes?" Draco employed an inquisitive eyebrow; Merlin forgive him if he wasn't quite buying into this all-out attack Harry was laying on his sensibilities There had to be some ulterior motive; Potter wanted something of him. "I'm perfectly well, Potter—perfectly! And not tense at all, damn your eyes! There's no need to butter me up, arse—"
"Oh, you're so right." Harry's teeth closed. He smiled, thin as knives, and the words whispered back intimately into the hollow of Draco's neck, formed where he was bent over Harry like the arc of a bow, they sliced as deep as any ice-coated steel. "It was never that. Clever, Draco."
“Oh, come on now—surely you recall ‘Weasley is Our King’, Harry? And—and, well, that’s inspiring and—and
"Here, then," he murmured softly, for they were close together as they could be, scrunched up on the one end of the table. The other shoppers had gone back to politely ignoring them, but for the occasional sly sideways glance of amusement. "We match."
"I'm shagging you tomorrow, Harry—got it?" The question was a bark, rough and startling in Harry's buzzing ear, jolting him out of his stupor. "I'm fucking you more stupid than even you are now, git—
