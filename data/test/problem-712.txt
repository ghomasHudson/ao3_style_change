“Then come for me, Harry.” Draco growled huskily in his ear and lowered himself just a little more so that Harry's cock was rubbing against his stomach.
“I thought you were a figment of my imagination as well. I had a very lonely childhood so I thought I dreamt you up to deal with it. When I told my parents about you, they said imaginary friends were pathetic muggle things and that it was wrong. That’s why I thought you stopped coming back.” Draco said softly. “I really missed you for a while. Then my father had some other kids my age come over so I could have some real friends and… I forgot about you.”
“You’re going to be just fine, Harry.” Madam Pomfrey said reassuringly. “But there’s one more thing I want to check before I let you go.”
The next morning, Harry awoke with a start to loud pounding.
At this Harry stiffened. This did not go unnoticed by his husband.
The dark-haired boy nodded and also
A creak from the opening door had Harry cracking an eye open to see who was coming to bother him now. He sat upright and smiled when he saw that it was Draco carrying a plate full of food. Classes must’ve been over with already.
Draco then turned his attention to
“So, Scor. What do you wanna do now?”
The wait feels like forever. Ron goes and gets them all coffee and pastries from the hospital canteen. They all drink the coffee, but merely pick at the food. Hermione is dosing slightly when she hears a muffled cry. When she starts awake and looks around she sees Malfoy as he holds out the alert globe to Ron. The yellow is gone, the smoke a pale grey fading quickly out to white, striped through with wisps of purple. Ron takes it gently from the Unspeakable's hand and places it inside his satchel. Malfoy drops his head into his hands, elbows rested on his knees. Ron’s hand rests on his back between his shoulder blades. Hermione drops her head back to the wall and drops back into a fitful sleep.
"Yeah. Fuck. I need to go and see her. I've been avoiding it. I've seen her at Andi's, although not recently, but then there's the distraction of Teddy. I've not been to see her on my own." He feels so guilty. He and Narcissa had been on friendly terms. A weird by-product of Ministry enforced reconciliation efforts. It was through her that he'd met up with Draco again, back in the days when Draco was still Malfoy to him. Seeing her alone again after he left had felt too much.
He knows too, that the garden is private. From the windows of the other townhouses in the row the view is of an inoffensive but pretty garden. Occasionally an image of a gardener appears in view, maintaining the illusion of occupation. He remembers Draco and he had taken advantage of that privacy once, when Draco had been staying here while the bathroom in his own flat was replaced. He studiously avoids looking at the hammock they had defiled (or so Tassy had called their actions, much to Harry’s embarrassment and Draco’s amusement). It is THIS, this intertwining of both his former romantic life with Draco, and his friendship with Narcissa, that had driven him away. It is the reason it has been at least three months since he last saw Narcissa and then only in passing, but the tug the memories have on his heart hardly seem important now.
Her takes her hand, brushes over her wedding ring. She knows he does this for comfort, and the fact that he’s doing it now both gives her comfort and strikes a deep fear into her. He looks at her again, "There is someone more senior coming now?"
“Sorry. Just, who would have thought, eh?”
"I mean. I thought I'd moved on too. And Nate and I were good. I was happy. Until I realised I wasn't."
When he listened to this song a thousand times before it had felt like an annoyance. Cliché idolisation. It’s a dominant theme in fan letters, ‘broken Harry who needs fixing’. It grew in intensity as details of his childhood were exposed, but it had always been there. It made people think they knew what he needed.
“...”
Myron. “What’s it for?”
Hermione remembers one time that they had joked about putting a official plaque on the double swing doors billing it as “The Harry Potter Corridor”. Harry had laughingly but sheepishly insisted it unfair. After all, it wasn’t just him who got put in this out of the way room. He had pointed out that if the Minister, Ron or Hermione got spell damaged they would be hidden away here too. Maybe even other well known individuals who would otherwise be gawked at in the higher traffic areas of the ward. Back then Ron had pointed out that those other visitors were, however, theoretical, while Harry’s own occupation of the room on a regular basis was proven fact.

He doesn't waste any time with hellos or explanations, and she finds she appreciates that, despite being intrigued.

, Harry”
“Please, Harry. Sorry. I.” He swallows. “I was going to write to you.” Harry barks out an incredulous laugh and turns towards Draco.
“Because it’s worth it.” Harry touches his face again. Leans forward and kisses him softly when he looks up. He can feel his chest squeeze with it, his heart flutter. “I’m being selfish. I want you to be mine.”
“I can owl it. Or...you could pop round? Have a coffee? Lil’s with her Grandma. The house always feels so empty once they go.”
would be taken. Time is weird. He wonders idly if it’s existence would have reassured him, back in the days when he wondered if they would even survive.
You were right. She wasn't as innocent as I
“Good.” He’s a little embarrassed at how breathless he already sounds. “I can think of plenty of other things you could be doing instead.” Harry grinds down a little, eliciting a shameless groan from Draco.
After Ron has finished locking down ‘Harry’s Corridor’ he transfigures a doorstop from the vase on the windowsill, props open the door. Malfoy settles himself into one of the chairs in the corridor across from it, while Ron and Hermione settle themselves on the chairs inside the room.
He puts his beer down with a shaking hand. “I thought that too. When he said it at first, said that he needed to move away.” He takes a breath. He’s never said this out loud to anyone but Draco.
‘I love you’.” Harry shifts so that he’s turned towards him, touches his face to make him look up. “I make that decision every morning when I wake up. To love you. Love isn’t a thing that just happens. It is continuous. It isn’t something I'm stuck with, it’s something I do.”
He spins towards her as she steps closer, his wand up defensively, then lets out a gust of breath as he takes a step towards her.
So. A curse. A pretty nasty one.
I miss you.
“Wine or Beer?”
“You love it.”
“Does Myron have a portrait?”
"What the hell have you done, Malfoy? If you have stepped one hair’s breadth out of line and it has harmed him, I swear..."
“Some artefacts came to light in a haul from a robbery recently. It seems they might be related to this old case. So we’re going back through it. Trying to make the links. It’ll be good, two snitches with one seeker.” He taps his fingers on the couple. “It was a bit of a scandal at the time. Death. Love. Intrigue. Mysteriously vanishing heirlooms.” Draco looks intrigued. He is. Genuinely. He has no idea about Harry’s case, he’d been at the party for entirely different reasons. Which is presumably why this photo had been missed in the usual Departmental sweeps through Ministry files.
“How can you even stand to be near me?”
It's been ten years since she last saw him. Accompanying Harry to the post-War trials she'd received a stilted but seemingly sincere apology during a pause in proceedings. After he was freed Malfoy had swiftly left the country.
“Malfoy.”
Hermione ghosts her fingers over the back of Harry’s hand. “You had all of us convinced too. If that is any consolation. It probably isn’t, I realise.”
May I send Olivetti to you? She's always been more faithful to you than to me. I won't send a letter, just her. Keep her as long as you want.
Hermione is sat by the bed checking reading a paper on Magical Prison Reform in Sweden when she looks down to see very green eyes blinking up at her. She smiles and hands Harry his glasses. “Hello, sleepy head.” She’s been in this situation, or similar, so many times before when they were younger. The feeling of relief is still monumental. It always will be. She helps Harry to sitting against the pillows, and hands him some water to drink. He groans as he sits, clutching at his head.
Beyond, in relative calm, Granger stills him with a hand to his arm.
’, so he’d thought himself safe here. Scratch that. And damn his luck, Hana calls him over. Most of the other seats are taken, and Harry can see Draco take a wild look around before realising it is either run rather indecorously out of the door, or sit with Hana and himself.
She huffs. “It would be a damn sight easier if we all weren’t such secretive bastards and actually published lists of who was doing what. Bloody Unspeakables. Think they are so much better than they are.”
The brunette boy nodded again and followed his dad through the swinging door into the kitchen.
Draco reached into his bag, pulled out a cloth, and used it to start wiping make-up off of his face. “Yup, that’s me.” He replied nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t acted like it was a huge mistake just seconds before.
amount, Draco held the spoon in front of Elliot’s mouth but the toddler refused
Taking a closer look at the door, the seven year old saw that it wasn’t shut all the way. She tiptoed forward and peeked through the crack to see Scorpius bent over the toilet. His hair was sticking to his face and his lack of a shirt revealed that he was shiny with sweat. He also appeared to be shaking.
again. “Just in case though, let me fix them.”
“Alright then, it’s bed time for you as well.” Harry said as he began unstrapping James from his high chair. “Draco, I’m going to get the boys in their pajamas. Would you mind clearing the table?” His tone was stiff and he refused to look at the blonde man.
When Madam Pomfrey returned, she was carrying a bag. She set it down on the bedside table, opened it, and pulled out a potion. “These are nutrient potions. They’re designed specifically for pregnant women, or in this case pregnant man. You only have to take one every other morning and there should be enough to last you the next few weeks.” She explained. “It’s not very common for students to get pregnant anymore so I’ll have to order you a full supply from St. Mungo’s.”
Harry moaned against Draco’s neck as the paler body slid above his own. One of his hands gripped a tight bicep while the other moved to hold on to the other’s side.
The first thing that ran through his mind was the same thing every time: how glad he was that this room hadn’t been destroyed in the war. After that his thoughts turned to the war itself. Harry couldn’t believe it had been nearly a year ago already. It didn’t feel that like long and he didn’t feel any different. And yet, he felt completely different at the same time.
With nothing else to do and his only companion gone, Harry laid down and stared at the ceiling as he waited for it to be nine-thirty so he could talk to Draco.
Love,
Ethan put his hands up in defense. “I was only joking. I know that’s not even a legal option.”
“When!?”
All thought left Ron’s mind as his mouth dropped open of, what felt like, its own accord. He felt a few drops of the liquid hit his tongue before sliding down his throat. Then the carefree feeling left him and he was plunged back into reality.
Draco frowned. “Of course. You didn’t think I was just going to leave you here after that letter, did you?” He asked.
Harry watched him with trepidation and started shaking, almost violently. The blonde stopped moving and looked at him with a questioning eye. The other said nothing though.
He finally settled on a pair of faded jeans with slight rips in the knees and a plain green t-shirt that Hermione always insisted brought out the color of his eyes. Not that he cared really.
his body protested against any movement. There was a small groan from the
“Caesarian, or C-section, is when a fetus must be removed surgically for various reasons. I was told you were catatonic when you were brought in, so that is likely the reason.” Emma clarified.
An hour later, and the two boys were stowing their trunks in a compartment on the familiar scarlet train that was the Hogwarts Express. The pair sat on one of the bench seats and made themselves comfortable as the whistle signaling the trains departure blew in the distance.
“Draco.” Harry breathed, forgetting the blonde didn’t know he was awake.
“Harry!” She nearly shrieked as she rushed to his side and knelt beside him, immediately conjuring a stretcher beneath him. “How long have you been in labor?” She asked as she spelled a nearby pair of pajamas onto his naked body.
Ethan chuckled lightly. “Good. Good. Now flip over.”
Harry noticed that Draco still hadn’t removed his hand from his, still flat, pregnant belly. “You know, it won’t disappear if you let go.” He said with a chuckle.
“Draco?” Harry asked and suddenly
“Harry!” A female voice exclaimed. He snapped his attention to the closing door to see Hermione running to him. She gave him a quick hug and sat down next to him.
Draco gave up the search for the elusive shirt and climbed into the free side of the bed.
Everyone was gathered at The Burrow.

By the time Mrs. Weasley brought
A few moments later, eyelids fluttered open to reveal watery, gray eyes. Instantly tears started spilling from them.
“That’s correct, Mr. Potter. Now, this conversation is not going in the direction I had intended.” She looked at the headmaster and then at Draco. “Albus, Mr. Malfoy, if you would please excuse us, I would like to give Harry a pre-natal exam.” The two men nodded and left; Dumbledore to his office since he didn’t really need to be there anymore and Draco to wait in the corridor.
“She’s so small.” Ethan marveled, running a hand over the dark fuzz that adorned her head.
registered in both their minds that someone else was in the room.
The sudden movement of Draco sitting up forced Harry to follow suit. He put a hand on either side of the brunette’s head and held him there so that he couldn’t look away. “Harry, what happened to you was a horrible, horrible thing that I would never wish on anyone.
Harry managed to suppress a laugh but shook his head a little as they walked to the other bed. “I’m not used to being called that. At Hogwarts I go by Potter to avoid the confusion.”
Draco smiled down at his lover. “I’ve missed you, too.” He kissed Harry’s temple.
“I love you, too, Harry.”
“Give me your hand.” The older boy gently ordered. Ethan took the offered appendage and flipped it palm up. Then he squirted a little lube into. Lastly, he guided the hand toward his own raging hard on.
“Thank you very much for telling me.” Harry helped her jump down from the counter. “When Papa gets home with dinner, we’ll see what’s up with him, ok?”
Twenty-five minutes passed before the high-pitched cries of an infant filled the room.
“Have you gotten to see him yet, Mr. Potter-Malfoy?” Carter asked as they walked.
He rested his hands on Harry’s naked belly
“It’s nice to meet you both.” The woman stated as she sat in a lovely wingback chair. The teens sat opposite her on a small love seat.
Almost immediately, Harry headed in the direction Draco had come from. “Alright then, let’s go meet your mother.” He looked back with a cheeky grin. Draco sighed and shook his head a little as he jogged a few steps to catch up to Harry.
The two teenagers left the room and were halfway up the stairs when a loud, excited shout reached their ears followed by an exclamation of, “Finally!”
Finally, Harry rose from the bed. “I should probably get going before anyone wonders where I disappeared to.” He said as he began to gather his clothing once again.
Harry's mouth fell open and his hips automatically lifted up to meet Draco's.
“Let’s go back to sleep though, Harry. Madam Pomfrey said you need to rest.” Draco said caringly.
“Are you sure you’re ok with this?” Draco asked a few moments later when he was comfortable. He didn’t get an answer though as Harry had already fallen asleep. “I guess you are.” He said to the back of Harry's dark head.
With a smile, the official announced, “I now pronounce you partners for life. You may k-”
Immediately, he jumped up from the bed and ran to the blonde’s side. Before kneeling next to him, he grabbed a washcloth and wetted it with cold water.

Percy. The evening was going fairly well. Everyone was laughing and talking.
“Then what do you want?” Harry asked, dropping his wand arm to his side.
“Alright.” Draco said as he stood up from the couch. “But it’s not wrapped.”
Harry felt his heart start pounding in his chest and his palms became sweaty. He swallowed and took a deep breath to calm his nerves before quietly replying, “I… I want you.”
“No, but-”
Draco squeezed his lover’s hand reassuringly. “I understand.”

Draco nodded and handed the child to the mind-healer. He then moved from his chair to the edge of the bed. “What is it, love?”
The raven-haired boy didn’t feel like talking, especially to someone that could be as annoying as Dobby.
Draco looked at Harry and then followed his gaze to his own stomach. “I’m fine. Just a bit of a stomach ache.” He replied. He was startled when Harry suddenly bolted up right, still staring at his abdomen.
“What kind of doctor was he?” Draco asked curiously.
“I’m not seventeen yet.” Harry answered dejectedly.

quickly hid his face behind the book, hoping he wouldn’t be noticed. Finally
“Alright then.” Draco gave him a bright smile as he got off the bed. He quickly kicked off his shoes and stripped down to just his shirt and boxers. Harry, already wearing hospital pajamas, scooted down the bed so he was lying down and waited for the blonde boy to re-join him.
“I-I want you.” Scorpius nervously murmured.
“Almost done,” the blonde man whispered against Harry leg.
Harry bit his lip in an attempt to

When he pushed open the door, he froze in shock at the scene in front of him. Harry was on the ground, naked from the waist down, and Ron was standing over him with his cock out.
“Ok then. Are you gonna finish that?” Ron asked pointing at Harry's plate.
“I know. I don’t want you to either.” Draco said and held him a little tighter. “In a month, it’ll just be you and me.”
Finally, Draco moved to the end of the bed and yanked the duvet off of Harry. Said boy cracked an eye open to look at the already dressed blonde. He shivered slightly and wrapped his arms around himself, continuing to feign sleep.

“Why didn’t you just tell him?” Harry asked. “He might have been more understanding if you’d just explained yourself.”

“Was Teddy with Aunt Dora today?” Harry asked with a small smile toward the boy’s antics.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” He asked, simultaneously trying to soothe the infant and the crying man.
Two tiny sets of hands moved up and started rubbing and poking the skin all over his stomach.
“Yeah, we have, actually.” The younger dark-haired man replied.
“I’m sorry.” Draco said with a pout and then he pulled Harry onto his lap.
“Really?” Harry asked, now slightly curious, as he sat up straight so he could look at Draco.
Draco quickly unrolled the top of the bag and pulled out the contents, a single plastic bottle of generic antiseptic.
Draco walked into the bathroom just as Harry was expelling what was left of his dinner into the toilet. “I thought you said you were better.” He said sternly as he knelt beside the sick boy.
Draco walked out of the bathroom a moment later with wet hair and fresh robes on.

“It’s a date.” Draco replied. The two of them then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to swallow each other’s tongue.
Once inside, he flicked on the light and was surprised to find a prone, female figure on his floor. He quickly recognized it as, “Monica,” he spat.

Immediately, one of Draco’s hands flew to Harry’s belly and began feeling for any movement. A few seconds later, he felt a soft thump under his hand.
Silver eyes widened as they stared into endless pools of jade and his knees suddenly buckled. Harry sat down next to him and waited for Draco to gather his thoughts.
“Second richest.” The blonde stated through a wince. “I heard enough bitching about “That Potter Kid” from my father to know he’s angry about not being number one. You ever heard of him?”
The added stimulation sent Harry over the edge almost immediately and he came with a hoarse cry of, “Draco!”
“What was this about?” Draco asked, confused but less angry now. “Why did you trick into having sex with you?”
In too much shock to react, Harry

honor, but why don’t you just stay home?” He asked.
“I—” Draco started angrily before shaking his head and sighing. “I don’t know. But it’s my child and Harry's my husband. Don’t I have the right to be in there?”
Inside, Harry immediately headed toward his room, completely ignored by the rest of the household. But he preferred it that way. The more they ignored him, the less “trouble” he’d get in.
“We have twin boys, which is mostly why we chose Healer McNamara. He specialized in multiples, that and he was Draco's mother’s maternity healer. And we’re both twenty-six, why?” Harry asked, confusion written all over his face.
their old potions professor.
“Terrible.” Harry said shortly.
Draco's face betrayed his confusion. “What are you on about?” He asked. He’d only ever had one best friend before and he had been imaginary.
“Hi, Luna.” Harry greeted with a stifled yawn.
After twenty minutes of this, Ginny
realized how long Harry had been in there.
My Sexy Slytherin,
At the same moment, Draco's hold on Harry tightened and he pressed completely against his backside. Harry couldn’t help but to notice the hardness pushing into the back of his thigh. He took a few deep breaths to calm down and reminded himself that this was Draco, not Ron. Draco would never hurt him.
Unfortunately, this is all I have finished right now. I do have ideas for two other chapters, but I'm really focused on Lucius' Pet right now, so who knows when there will be more.
“Yeah.” The two fingers began pumping in and out once more.
Harry returned the smile and squeezed the hand in his. “I want to be surprised.”
Draco collapsed onto of Harry before rolling off to the side. The pair lay in a comfortable silence as they came down from their orgasmic high.
Harry smiled again which quickly turned into a look of suspicion. He was about to ask his son why he was home early when there was a whoosh in the next room and a shout of, “Potter!”
Ron said as he clapped Harry hard on the shoulder. “Looked painful though.”
“Are you a virgin?” Harry asked seriously.

Once his skirt was one, he pulled a small vial out of a pocket. “I brought extra.” He replied. “I probably should’ve drank it while I was waiting for you, but it’s obviously too late now.” He tipped the contents of the bottle into his mouth and morphed back into the strawberry-blonde bombshell.
“Where’s dad?” The teen asked.
The frizzy-haired brunette was taken aback. “I’m… sorry Harry. I didn’t know you cared so much.” She said in confusion. “So, what happened?”
It worked.

Several questions ran through Draco’s mind. He knew he had to ask the right ones or else Harry would just shut down.
The man smirked at him. “Just as hotheaded as well, I see.”
Before his throbbing cock could make its way to her wet entrance, two of his fingers slid into her. Their lips met once more and Harlot moaned into him.
“I’m afraid not.” The headmaster said calmly.
“I know today is important. But it’s an important day for us too.” The blonde whined slightly.
Draco trailed kisses across Harry’s jaw and neck. “Of course, love.” He replied huskily.
.” With that, he gave Harry a peck on the cheek and left him alone.
Harry really didn’t want to go back there, not right now at least. Right now, he wanted to be as far away from Ron as possible.
The dark-haired man cracked his eyes open and glanced at the clock before glaring at the one who disturbed his sleep. “It’s after three o’clock in the morning, Draco. Go back to sleep.” He said as forcefully as he could while still being half asleep.

“Harry, you’re okay!” Cried a voice from the doorway. The man in question looked from the baby he was holding toward the voice.
“Harry…” He started softly. “I don’t want to upset you, but earlier, when you told us why he did what he did, it seemed like you might have left something out. You don’t have to if you don’t want to but I’m here if you want to talk about it.”
Immense relief filled Harry when Madam Pomfrey finally told him he was just about ready to start pushing. But that happy bubble was quickly burst when she added that Draco had to leave the wing.

“And he miscarried at the end of September.” She read out of the file.
“Yeah…” Harry started. “So… um… are we, are we friends now or something?”
The two girls looked up and smiled
A few minutes later, two sets of hurried footsteps were heard in the corridor through the partially open door.
“Oh, yes sir! Dobby will be doing what Master Harry Potter asks!” With another crack, the house elf was gone.
After letting Harry cry for a few moments Draco asked tenderly, “Look at me please?” He helped Harry sit up.
Harry bit back a smirk even though no one could see his face at the moment. “Harry.” He softly replied.
“Of course you can,” the other replied with a small chuckle. He laid back against the bed and presented himself for Harry.

The pile of ash on his desk drew his attention for a moment. He’d written a letter to the ministry asking them to get him out of the contract. But apparently, they thought it was a good idea. Harry thought they were just afraid of him and wanted to keep him under control somehow. This was the solution they had been looking for as restrictions would have to be placed on his wand since he was marrying a non-magical being.
“Yeah.” Harry said with a sniffle. Then when he went back to pull his shirt up, he started throwing up again, more fiercely than before.
Harry sat up. “But what about you?” He questioned, noting his husband’s erection standing tall.
Takes place the summer Scorpius is 14.
“Fine. I’m a male prostitute, happy?” He asked sarcastically. “But you don’t know me and you don’t know my situation. So don’t just stand there and judge me.”
“I guess that would be okay.” He stated quietly, staring into his tea.
Ron then moved to stand directly in front of Harry’s face and began to lazily stroke his hardened flesh. “I won’t tell you to cooperate, Harry.” He started breathily. “Not this time. No, this time, is going to be very bad for you.”
Harry sat up straight and disentangled himself from Draco. “Great. I didn’t have to stay at my muggle relatives all summer for once and we got married.”

Before the show could continue, Minister Shacklebolt spoke up. “Why don’t the three of you go have a seat somewhere while we talk?”
“Yeah.” It was so quiet the other almost missed it.
Harry sighed as a warm autumn
“So I heard. Congratulations.” Luna sang.

Harry was silent for a while as he absorbed and processed everything the man next to him had told him. As he opened his mouth to ask Draco what his son’s name was, there was a scream from upstairs.

Before the man’s robe had even whipped out of sight through the door, Draco was rushing back to Harry's side. “Are you ok, Harry? He didn’t say anything to upset you, did he?” The blonde boy asked.
“Ron… he-he was gonna k-ill the baby.”
“Let’s do ours now!” Harry bounced excitedly. “You first.”
Harry started. “What other articles?”

Harry stared at the pile of junk that was haphazardly thrown on the bed. He knew he had to go through his trunk, but after seeing the mess outside of it, he really didn’t want to.

Draco sighed again and explained to Harry about being prepared properly so as to cause the least amount of damage and pain. He also told him exactly what made it feel so good for two guys.
one question though. Are you a virgin?”
Eric patted the space next to him and Harry slowly moved to fill it. “This is the last innocent kiss before we’re married, Harry.” He said before his lips descended upon the boy’s.
“Yeah.” Harry said quietly.
After a few passes around the room, Scorpius had found no one he knew or anyone he would be interested in talking to. Bored, he decided to sit at a table until dinner was served.

It took nearly twenty minutes, but eventually Harry had his youngest boys cleaned up and in their pajamas.
The short brunette could practically hear his uncle’s mustache bristle in anger. He was a man who thought it was extremely rude for someone to interrupt a meal, especially dinner or Sunday breakfast.
Harry grinned. “Yeah.”
The next couple of months went by rather smoothly. The world kept spinning and life had returned to being normal and occasionally, somewhat boring.
Harry ran both of his hands through his hair in frustration and sighed. He had to know if it was real and make the other remember. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself down a little more and said, “I was your best friend once.”

“Yes.” The shorter boy grumbled and dropped the book, Quidditch Through the Ages, into his trunk. “How was Quidditch practice?” He asked, changing the subject.
“Oh.” He leaned forward so he was practically lying on top of the smaller body. “You like that?” He purred, his hot breath ghosting over Scorpius’ ear.
“I am a very wealthy man, Harry.” He had said. “I need, and would like to have, an heir to pass my business and wealth to but, I find myself in a very awkward position. I’m gay, so obviously marrying a woman is out of the question and I absolutely refuse to raise a bastard child.”
“Harry, are you alright?” He asked warmly. A moment later the door opened.
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy.” Harry said with a small smile.
“Save it, Harry. He’s two with legs
“I know. I think I was confused when I didn’t see the inside of a cupboard.” Harry replied and rolled completely onto his back to look up at the blonde.
a Malfoy and every Malfoy first born has been male for the past seven generations.” He replied seriously.
Draco looked at his fiancé with a soft smile. “Whatever Harry wants.”
“Me too. Me too.” The older teen panted above.
Finally, the brunette man broke the silence. “I’m really tired and I just want to sleep. Could you please leave me alone, Malfoy?” He turned slightly away from the other, attempting to make himself comfortable.
“You have to remember. It had to have been real.” Harry demanded.
minutes, but with a little magical help, they arrived in half the time.
Harry grinned at his husband’s complaints and started twisting his fingers in search of the other’s prostate. “But what if I got pregnant at the same time?” He asked innocently.
Scorpius hesitated for a brief moment before handing the bag over.
“What’s so funny?” He asked.
“No. You’ll be lucky if you’re not dead by the time I’m through with you!” Draco screeched. “Actually, maybe you’ll be luckier if you are dead.”
“Will you tell me who the other father is?” The medi-witch asked Harry.
following his girlfriend’s path.
Scorpius didn’t like any part of that plan. He didn’t want to have to tell Ethan anything and he certainly didn’t want him to be obliviated, but he knew all of it was necessary. He nodded feebly, indicating his agreement.
“You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.” Draco began, “We don’t even have to finish what we started if you don’t want to”
“I-wai… How? Wha? He’s not a mu-” There was a dull thud as the young man slid from his chair to the floor, unconscious.
“Physically, at least.” Harry replied as he fidgeted with the corner of his hospital blanket. It wasn’t a lie either; his stomach really didn’t hurt anymore.

Scorpius gave a damp smile and finally fully relaxed. Ethan grinned next to him.

In potions class halfway through the third week, Draco was bored. The potion they were working on was far too easy and Potter wasn’t in class for him to annoy. He spent a few minutes pondering over where the precious Chosen One could have been but quickly tired of that train of thought.
“I love you so much, Draco.” Harry breathed against his lips when they pulled apart for air.
Harry beamed and nodded.
At that moment, there was a sniffle and a sob from the occupied bed. Harry immediately jumped up from his chair and rushed over to his husband.
The blonde man moaned into Harry’s ear and lowered his body closer. His hips started picking up speed, nearly slamming against the other’s body.

“What are you looking at Harry?” Ron asked
“Well, I don’t really consider you a stranger anymore. Besides,
“Yes, baby!” Ethan groaned in response as he started to speed up.
“Uh huh!”
Finally they managed to pick themselves up and redressed, casting cleaning spells on each other as they did so.
“If we never do anything more than kiss for however long we’re together, its ok. I don’t need sex. Just being here with you is enough. Now that I’ve got you, I don’t intend to lose you.” Draco said lovingly as he wiped Harry's tears away with his thumbs.
“Do you have kids?” He asked as he took it from her.
Draco was panting and moaning against her neck as he pumped into her harder and faster with every passing minute, despite having been exceedingly close to the edge since the moment he entered her.
Harry swallowed thickly when the door was opened all the way and Professor Dumbledore walked in with Draco on his heels.

Tears pricked at Harry’s green eyes. “Wh-why don’t I remember… my entire life?”

grounded for two weeks.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, exasperated, when they reached the table the girls were occupying.
“I’m sorry.” Draco repeated. “But you know now and we’ve still got two weeks.”
“So it’s fifty-fifty then. That doesn’t mean you win!” Harry said childishly and stuck his tongue out at the blonde.
“You’re sure you want it?” Draco asked when he sat back down. “If you don’t like it, you can’t blame me for it.”
“I love you, too.” Harry replied in a hoarse whisper.

The blonde pulled the smaller boy back to him and held him reassuringly. “Tell me what happened.” He said gently.
“Ginny
“Come on, Harry. You need to get to the hospital wing.” Draco said as he stood to help Harry up.
“Absolutely neither of those things bother me, Potter.” The blonde stated. “Sex is just sex. No one cares who’s doing whom. Besides, you’re plenty hot enough for me. Sure we may not like each other, but there’s still a passion there. And that’s all that’s required.”
“May I?” A voice directly above him suddenly said.

“How much did it cost?” Harry suddenly asked.
“You… are wearing… entirely too much.” Ethan panted at last, his hands headed south toward the other boy’s zipper.
Sirius saw red almost instantaneously.
Harry smiled a little. “Yeah. My… my boyfriend, Draco.” He replied.
Draco looked at Harry in confusion before his expression changed to one of complete shock. Two seconds after that, a shout of, “Daddy!” had Harry whipping around in surprise. He’d never been called that by Scorpius. The toddler had only just started to be okay with calling him Papa Harry, never Daddy though because he already had one.
Harry had finished with the eggs and was now putting strips of bacon in the pan. Uncle Vernon was reading the morning paper while Aunt Petunia had gone to finally wake Dudley, when the doorbell rang.
Draco respectfully got off the bed to give them more space.

when the door suddenly slammed shut and locked behind him. He whirled around to face it, pulling out his wand as he did. A light came on behind him and he turned back, lighting his wand as he went.
“Sorry, just unpleasant thoughts.”
“Yes, ma’am.” He said respectfully.
He was about to drop to his knees and vent his frustration by punching the floor, possibly breaking a few fingers, when,

Once he’d found the bottle he was looking for, Ethan returned his attention to the body splayed before him, specifically the hard cock that was waiting for his touch. He wrapped one large hand around the appendage and gave it a few strokes, earning him a soft moan.
Madam Pomfrey sighed sadly. “It was a little boy, Harry.”
He replied breathlessly and smashed their lips back together.
“Watch your language, Mr. Potter.” She scolded.
Harry smiled at that and Draco
Suddenly Harry flashed back to feeling trapped by Ron and he instantaneously started thrashing about, trying to get away from Draco.
Once they reached the hall, Harry stopped outside of Elliot’s bedroom and turned to look at it. Then he turned a fearful look on his blonde husband.
Harry look became crestfallen.
For a while, the two young men just sat there and talked about everything they could remember from Harry's visits. Given they were only four when it started and six when it stopped, it wasn’t that much.
nine. Wake me up then.” Harry flipped over and snuggled deeper into his pillow.
“He kept abusing you just because he couldn’t get off with Granger. He deserves to die.” His voice laced with anger.
“A few months later, mum told me that it was definitely a boy. By that time, the idea had grown on me and I was really excited to be a big brother. I wanted to help and mum let me go shopping with her so that I could pick out stuff that boys would like.” Draco paused and took a deep breath.
In his peripheral vision, the teen boy noticed the snake head slide slightly away from the rest. He glanced down for half a second and saw what was clearly a concealed wand. Naturally, he reached for his own. Before the situation escalated any further though, the man cleared his throat and slid the cane back together. He transferred it to his right hand to help avoid the temptation of drawing it again.
Harry didn’t answer. He just looked at Draco with wide, fearful eyes.
“May I?” Draco asked, gesturing to the necklace. Harry nodded and handed it to him.
With a shrug, Draco replied, “Muggle world or magical, Malfoy’s only get the best.”
“I missed you so much.” He practically sobbed into the taller boy’s chest as Draco put his arms under Harry to hold him up.
“Oh. I see. Do they really expect strangers to send us gifts?” Harry asked.
“Harry Potter, sir!” Dobby squeaked when he saw the state the boy was in. “Why is Harry Potter on the floor?! Has you been injured?”

Draco fumbled for an answer before finally replying with, “Because you didn’t have anyone to teach you any better.” He hadn’t even finished speaking when he realized that was, absolutely, the

“Of course, Mr. Malfoy. That was my next order of business.” She replied and grabbed a vial off a fully stocked tray. “Unfortunately, it’s not very strong as too much of certain ingredients could harm the baby.”
Ron fell sideways and slightly forward, luckily missing Harry, the side of his head smacking into the corner of the dark-stained end table next to the bed. He landed on the floor and remained motionless.
“Really, Hagrid, I’m fine. I can get there myself.” Harry said, politely trying to get him to leave as they made their way across the courtyard.

Stubbornly, Harry grabbed the piece of toast from Draco's own mouth and took a big bite out of it. “Happy?” He asked with his mouth full.
Finally, the older man took hold of the base of his hardened length and lined it up against Harry’s prepared, virgin pucker. He slowly pushed forward, stopping once or twice to allow the smaller body time to become accustom to the fullness.
“Yeah,” Scorpius replied, “I’m just
“That,” The woman started gently, “I can only speculate on.

looking away.
“I’m sure you are, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, but that changes nothing. There are still other forms of intimacy you can participate in.” She explained. “Now, there’s just one more thing I want to make sure of.”
I’m sorry it’s been so long since our last meeting, but I’ve been terribly busy with homework. I’m sure you have been as well.
Next to him, Draco had one hand in his and the other soothingly running through raven locks, repeating things like, “You’re almost there, Harry. It’s almost over.”
Instead of words, Draco captured the other boy’s lips in a gentle kiss.
“Yes, it was.” He added with a
“Are you alright?” Draco asked a distraught Harry as the pair made their way back toward their chambers.
Finally, the door to the compartment slid open and a head of stringy, dirty blonde hair adorned with a pair of spectrespecs popped in. “Hello, Draco.” Luna said dreamily. “Oh, I see Harry’s asleep.” She slid the specs down over her eyes. “Probably for the best. He’s surrounded by wrackspurts”
This chapter is just a tiny bit smutty.
The two boys jumped so bad that Harry fell off Draco's lap and landed on his arse on the hard floor. He hid his reddening face behind his hands while Draco watched him in slight amusement.

At least he was a minimum security
Today was one of those days. The
and Harry was lying on his bed, watching the light fade from his room and rubbing his belly. Eric would be arriving soon to receive his good night kiss. He hadn’t tried anything else since the one time he attempted to give Harry a hand job through his pants.
“I’m not that much taller than you.” He laid back again and a pale leg came to rest on the top of the couch. “I’m wearing heels.” Sure enough, a strappy, white wedge was adorning his foot. The heel of it had to have been at least six inches.
“I hate it there.” Harry moaned and then continued, “It’s just a bug. It’ll go away on its own.”
In the hall, the pair ran into Narcissa and the three girls. Lyra was now asleep in the woman’s arms. Draco quickly explained the situation to his mother before they parted ways. He also asked her to put the girls to sleep with Elliot. They then continued on their way to find Healer Carter.
Suddenly, he felt a lurch in his stomach and quickly turned back to the toilet to throw up.
They were figuring out that something strange was going on with Harry and it doubtlessly wouldn’t be long before they questioned him about it. If they were to find out about his pregnant state, his uncle would probably do more to him that just a smack upside the head. That was something he wouldn’t risk and mostly likely wouldn’t live through a second time, accidentally or otherwise.
“Is he alright?” The journalist asked, lowering her quill and parchment for a moment.
The door to the adjoining kitchen swung open and a handsome, young version of Oliver stepped through, shortly followed by Oliver himself.
Ethan smiled back and the raven-haired teen felt his heart flutter.
“No, I guess not.” Harry said, crossing his arms and pouting.
“That’s right. You gave birth by caesarian to a healthy baby boy at roughly nine-forty-five last night.” She explained.
“Draco, my stomach hurts.” He said softly.
“I think that day might be today.”
“But you just said… we want a baby brother!” Scorpius exclaimed, thoroughly confused.
With a sneer, the younger Malfoy said, “The contents of my family are none of your business.”
“Me?”
“Ron woke me up and he was angry. He pulled me into the shower and smacked me. I made sure to do everything he asked so he wouldn’t hurt me as badly as he usually does. He still has to hit me though, every time.” Harry explained as he tried to calm down.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” He asked gently, using his free hands to try and soothe the other.
Draco was getting worried. Potions class had started ten minutes ago and neither Harry nor the weasel had shown up yet. He knew that somewhere in the castle, something terrible was happening. Against his first instinct though, Draco decided to wait five more minutes before going to look for Harry. He ended up not being able to wait that long though.
“Hmmm…”
Hearing footsteps, Harlot snapped her head to her right and jumped up from the floor. She seemed happy to see him at first, but then she got a little angry. “You’re nearly forty-five minutes late! I would have left if I wasn’t so unbelievably horny!” After her short tirade, she immediately calmed down.
looked as their oldest child. “Take your sisters to the car.”
“You… you like that, Harry?” The older of the two groaned as he sped up yet again.
It was over quickly, only a dozen
Having had to take several disgusting potions, Harry swallowed it quickly only to smile and giggle a bit as it went down.
Harry sighed and turned to head out the door only to find his way blocked by the half-giant Hagrid. He mentally face-palmed himself. The world seemed to be conspiring against him and his date.
“After a while, I decided to try my hand at parenting without a partner and one of my friends suggesting becoming a foster parent. It’s worked out well so far.” He finished with a small smile.
Scorpius glanced over his shoulder at a smiling Ethan. “Yeah, okay.”
“You know, you talk too much.” She kissed him again, only for a few seconds before pulling back. “Now, are we going to fuck? If not, I have better things I could be doing.”
only reason he was on edge.
In case you haven’t realized this yet, I’m pregnant with your child. I’d say probably close to five months by now. Yeah, I wasn’t sick toward the end of the year. I wish I would have listened to you and gone to see Pomfrey.

“What’d ya do, jinx ‘im? Or just shove ‘im when his back was turned?” The enraged Hagrid yelled as he advanced on Draco.

Harry mumbled something unintelligible in response before his head fell slightly to the side and his breathing completely evened out.
“Alright then. We’re leaving in
“Who is ‘he’, anyway?”
After a short elevator ride, the small group arrived at the fourth floor. Almost immediately, they were approached by a short woman with a floating stretcher.
“So where are we going?” Harry asked with a shiver.
“Where is she?!” Harry bellowed, now aiming his wand at the unarmed boy’s chest.
“But aren’t you gay?” Harry asked when he realized what Draco said implied.
With a sigh, the man began, “When Harry was fourteen…”
Draco thought he was going to be sick. How could anyone do that, let alone to their best friend?
“Well you’re quite welcome, Harry.” He responded, smiling at Harry's sudden shyness around him and at the fact that he had just used Draco's given name.
was rewarded with a nip to his bottom lip.
“Good. I’m going to add another finger now.” He announced as he pulled his index finger out to add more lube.
“Yes,” Harry replied meekly. “But you weren’t supposed to find out! The polyjuice wore off.”
Hands shaking, Harry held out his left for Eric to slide his ring on before performing the same action on the other man.
Draco grinned and asked, “What’s my prize?” The brunette leaned up and kissed him, hard.
Draco smiled and reached behind him to grab whatever it was he had for Harry. “Close your eyes.” He said before he revealed it.
“Later.” Harry said with a soft
“I didn’t before. B-but now…” Harry
Draco maneuvered them so that he was lying across the seat and Harry was on top of him. “Take a nap. I’ll wake you up when we get there. Or the driver will if I fall asleep too. Ok?”
“However, the next time I saw you, you didn’t seem to have any questions or problems with what should have been a physical impossibility. I foolishly assumed your friend, Ms. Granger, had researched and explained everything to you. But when you… miscarried, I realized this was not the case, as you didn’t know I had to perform surgery on you. I won’t be making that mistake again.” Madam Pomfrey explained as they waited for the other two.
it was good enough for her.
The very experienced medi-witch wasn’t so sure she believed him but she had no reason to think otherwise and went about healing this newly revealed injury.
Harry quickly schooled his expression to one of amusement. “There’s that bratty son of mine.” He replied with a grin.
“Did they explain what may have caused it?” She asked.
“Sirius, stop!” A choked cry came from behind the man.

door in his husband’s face.
When he was within arm’s reach, Draco grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him into a deep kiss. His other arm wrapped loosely around Harry's waist to pull him onto his lap.
“I’m so sorry, Harry.” He said tenderly and pulled Harry into his arms.
“All the money I had, I spent on him. I only ate enough to keep myself alive and relatively healthy and I didn’t waste money on anything unnecessary, like television. My outfits were all either given to me or… stolen. I didn’t spend a cent on myself if I didn’t have to.” The blonde explained.
“Talk, tell me what’s getting you so stressed out.” Harry said softly as he moved his hands to the back of the pale neck in front him.
deserves even half of what you’ve had to go through in life. First a madman tried to kill you for 14 years of your life. Then your best friend turned on you the way he did and you ended up pregnant. Now you just lost that baby. Voldemort himself would feel sorry for you.” Draco said.

With a quick nod to each other Professor Dumbledore left for his office and Madam Pomfrey went into her own office to change.
Harry's thoughts were completely jumbled as he attempted to figure out a way to contact Madam Pomfrey or anyone at this point. He was screaming names of everyone he knew; hoping beyond hope that one of them would somehow hear him, but he knew it wasn’t possible. People didn’t just appear when they were called.
“Off,” Draco demanded as he pulled at the green garment adorning his bed partner’s torso.
“Do you want more of that?” Draco asked with a chuckle.
Please user subscribe so you'll be updated when I start posting the sequel, Not Again. (It's not what you think. ^_^)
A sharp crack filled the air and Harry sobbed in relief that the elf heard him even with the lacking strength of his voice at the moment.
“Teddy’s mommy called me that before she sent me through the floo.” Scorpius replied. “And she had rainbow hair today!” He squealed excitedly, momentarily forgetting his question.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Scorpius…” That’s all it took for the boy to break down in tears. “So, you are then? …Pregnant?” He nodded and wiped at his eyes.
After only a few minutes of hard thrusting, Harry felt warmth fill as him as the body above him stiffened and Draco moaned his pleasure loudly.
At first he didn’t notice the blonde in his room because he was currently rubbing a towel over his hair to dry it. He jumped when he tossed it aside. “Do you need something?” He asked as he pushed his still damp hair out of his face.
Other than his relatives founding out, the worst part about it was how small he already was. Despite his growing stomach, the renewed vomiting was causing Harry to lose weight. If Draco were to see that he was lighter than when they parted, he’d probably kill him, or more likely his relatives.
Before continuing with the preparation, Draco moved back up and distracted Harry with a mind-blowing kiss.
“Is that it?” Harry asked almost sadly.
Finally, the train slowed and the whistle blew, signaling that they had arrived at their destination.
“He’s going to find out eventually.” Draco said sympathetically.
Before answering, Emma pulled a file from her satchel and opened it. “You’re thirty-two, almost thirty-three, Harry.” She replied upon finding the information she was looking for.
Any and all gifts and well wishes should be sent to Malfoy Manor, care of Narcissa Black.
Harry felt his own legs automatically spread so he could straddle Draco's lap, but that wasn’t the only thing he felt. A hard length slid against his own, causing the blonde to moan loudly into the kiss and his hold to tighten considerably.
“Draco?” Both Ron and Hermione interjected suddenly.
“We love you too.”
The small, rectangular object in his hands was… confusing to say the least.
It was nearing nine o’clock when the nurse told them that Harry had less than a centimeter to go. “It may be almost over, Harry, but remember that the hardest part is still to come and unfortunately, I cannot give you any more pain relieving potions.” She also told the two older men that they had to leave the room at that time.
The blonde felt kind of bad for

Draco pulled Harry into a hug and held him as he spoke. “First of all Harry, you aren’t supposed to be doing anything besides sitting there and enjoying it. Second,
“What?” Harry asked when Draco just continued to stare at him in a way that was making his heart race.
“Children, really? If you don’t mind me asking, how old are you?”
In the doorway, the woman paused. “I almost forgot.” She pulled a small camera from her bag. “I’m supposed to get a picture of the happy couple. If that’s alright with the two of you, of course.”

Harry smiled and snuggled closer.
? That’s the day after my birthday! You were only going to give me one day’s notice?!” Harry shrieked. “What if I hate everything you picked out?!”
“What do you think you’re doing, Draco? We’re supposed to be comforting him right now, not yelling at him!”
Unshed tears filled the green orbs looking back at him. Clearly Harry was sticking to his resolve of not crying anymore. Draco gave him a soft kiss on the lips and gradually moved so that he was straddling Harry's lap. It felt strange. He was usually the one being straddled.
Twenty minutes later and the pair of boys were clean and dressed once more.
“Yeah.” Harry mumbled.
Slowly, the blonde approached until he was entering Harry’s personal space. Even then, he didn’t stop and the green-eyed boy took a step back. But Draco kept getting closer and Harry had to keep backing up, until he found himself against a wall. When Draco finally stopped, their faces were mere inches apart.
The brunette boy glared half-heartedly at Hermione for telling Ginny his secret about being gay. He had, of course, known Ginny would find out about what Ron did to him and didn’t blame his friend for that.
Excitedly, Harry set his bag down and walked over to the bed that captured his interest. It was the biggest one he had ever seen, not that he had seen many.
from his father’s hand.
“Ok.” Harry said as he sat up and put his glasses on. “How long before you have to go?”
“Come in.” He weakly called. The door creaked as it opened and a much hated face popped in. Harry didn’t even have to look to know who it was.
Running a hand through his hair, the blonde reluctantly turned away from the barrier and went back to his mother.
Draco leaned forward, looking at the young man with scrutinizing eyes. “So, you’re Ethan?”

“And how long have you been friends?” He added next.
Immediately, Harry pushed him away and shouted, “Don’t touch me!” Then he stood up to try and put some more distance between them.
Which Harry was pleasantly surprised to find out the other actually liked the
“Yeeess.” Scorpius moaned at the delightful friction against his own burgeoning flesh.
The brunette teen suddenly laid a hand across Scorpius’ shoulders. “Why don’t I help you with that stress.” He whispered practically in the other boy’s ear.
Soon, the blonde teen decided this wasn’t quite what he was looking for.
Scorpius released the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.
“Perfect, just perfect.” The blonde
Harry stared around the pub and considered
“Well, when you came in, I was mostly asleep. When you said “Back again?” that had it all rushing back to me. You always said that to me when I showed up in your room.” Harry replied. “Speaking of, how did I get there?”
Blue eyes met Sirius’ gray ones. “Thanks a lot, cousin. Where am I?”
“I think… Scorpius is sick.” She finally replied.
Draco nodded. “Harry needs to rest now. I suppose you can come visit him after he’s feeling better.” He said.
“Merlin, what happened to you?” Madam Pomfrey asked.

“Boys!” She intervened before they could get anything further in their arguing. “Would you like to see your baby sometime this century?” Harry smiled almost blindingly and nodded.

Finally he put his quill down and reread the letter:
“Harry! It’s ok. I’m not going to hurt you.” Draco said firmly over the noise of Harry's splashing. “Harry, Ron is not here. He can’t hurt you anymore.”
Draco smiled down at him and answered, “I was working on our wedding, of course. How do you feel about August 1

Elliot, looking for all the world like he was going to cry, opened his mouth
“Oh, uh, yes, I do.” Harry responded somberly.
“You have a lovely family. You’re both incredibly lucky.”
“Is that all you can say?” The blonde asked.
“I know who I am. Do you know who you are?” The blonde teased. “And keep it down, unless you want to wake the entire school.”
“I automatically started thinking the worst but I didn’t want to start panicking for nothing. For all I knew, it could have just been a routine check-up. So I looked up the doctor’s name to find out what his specialty was. I was furious when I found out.” Harry paused and shook his head to help clear the anger that was suddenly rolling off of him.
Up in Harry’s room, the door intentionally left unlocked, the dark-haired young man sat nervously on the edge of his bed. “Well, this is it.” He gestured around the room. A bed, a dresser, a chair, a hamper, and not much else.
arms around his blonde husband’s neck. “Thank you, Draco.”
By the time the kiss ended, Draco was fully on top of Harry and he had divested them both of their sleepwear.
“How?”
“Remember, you made me do this.”
“What is it?” Draco asked as Harry sat up.
Harry remained silent for a minute longer. “I need to think about it.” He finally said.
“Yeeees. Yesyesyesyesyes.”
Tuning out the din of conversation, Scorpius slowly finished his first piece and reached for another from one of the boxes in the center of the table. At the same moment, he felt a slight tug on his left sleeve. He glanced down at his sister and she beckoned him closer.
“Finally.” He sobbed as the other male approached. “I-I thought you weren’t coming.”
No warnings apply.
“I see,” the healer said as she waved her wand over Draco. “Rennervate.”
“And just what do you think you’re doing?” Draco asked, causing Harry to let out an undignified squeak and jump away from the blonde who was apparently no longer asleep.
“He used to.” Harry sighed. “When we were kids.”
The raven-haired boy in question glanced up at the pale face above him. “Hmm?”
The woman quickly removed her hand, which she thought had been comforting. “Look, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, we have everything under control here. Why don’t you take your family to the hospital to be with your husband?”
Draco leveled a glare at the woman speaking to him. “I didn’t protect my family.”
“How do you know?” Harry asked.
gold than red and gave it the appearance of a halo.
Draco looked up at the girl in confusion. What the hell was a wrackspurt?
Healer Janus’ face fell. “Unfortunately, he had a massive stroke in his sleep a few nights ago. We’re still working on getting his patients assigned to different maternity healers.” She flipped through in the file in her hand. “In fact, a letter was to be sent to you today informing you of your new healer and how to get a different one if you disapprove.”
“I need an invitation to that wedding.”
Draco growled lowly. “As you wish.” He replied and began ridding himself of his pajamas.
The slightly younger man hurried over to his nearly catatonic husband and sat on the edge of the bed. Gray eyes flicked up to his face for a moment before going back to stare at a spot on the blindingly white wall.
Harry,
Ethan gripped the base of his erection in his hand and guided it toward the stretched pucker awaiting him. Beneath him, Scorpius’ breathing sped up. He slowly pushed passed the ring of muscle guarding the boy’s most intimate place.
Harry cutely nodded his agreement and understanding. Right now, the faster they got through it, the faster he’d heal.
“Stop talking about my dad like that!” Scorpius seethed.
Healer Carter tittered. “You expect me to get the best mind-healer we have on staff here at nearly one in the morning?”
The teen rolled his eyes at his father’s slightly vague suggestion. “Whatever.” He shoved his hands in his pockets as he stomped off.

With a small shrug, Lucius replied, “It’s worth a shot.”
“You are a sixteen year old teenage boy, Harry, and this is the second time in less than a year I’ve discovered that you’re pregnant. Then there is also the fact that sex between students is against the rules, though not a rule that’s strictly enforced unless a teacher walks in on it.” She explained.
Ten minutes later Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, and Pomfrey were congregated around a still unconscious Ron in the headmaster’s office.
“It hasn’t moved for a while now. I think it’s asleep and I’d rather it stay that way for a while. It seems to think my bladder is a punching bag and every time I get hit there, I have to rush to the bathroom.” Harry softly replied as one of his hands joined Draco's.
Suddenly, a small, third year Hufflepuff came bounding up to them excitedly. “Hi, Draco. Hi, Harry.” She squealed elatedly. “Oh, I just love babies.” The girl gushed and then begged, “Can I touch your belly? Please?”

“Look it’s, Potty.” Pansy said in the shriek she calls a voice. “Where’s your weasel and book worm?”
“Ready, Harry.” The wedding planner quietly asked him as she walked up to him once more.
The blonde man abruptly remembered their deal to tell each other their stories. “You wanted to know why I do what I do and I told you. It’s your turn. How is it you have my son?”
Love,

“You left me there for a second.”
A thick silence filled the air once the house elf had gone.
“Can all wizards get pregnant? What about muggle-borns?”
“Nuh uh. Most of the time he calls you Harry, or love, or something mushy but he only calls you Potter when he’s mad. Does Papa hate you?” Scorpius asked, fear watering his eyes.
“You… you’re not mad?” Harry was shocked.
“Sir, just to be sure Mr. Malfoy wasn’t lying about the… sexual abuse, I examined Harry's rectum and found sites of tissue damage, most overlapping others, which, I'm afraid to say, suggests that each wound had time to heal before the act was repeated. I did the best that I could to heal any and all injuries I found but there is a chance of permanent damage.” Madam Pomfrey added.
“Draco.” Harry finally choked out. The young Malfoy was across the hall in two seconds flat.
Finally Draco broke the kiss to look Harry directly in the eye. He lifted himself up and then slowly began lowering on to Harry's hard length. He felt tears pricking at the corners of his eyes from the intense burning that was coursing through his body and reluctantly squeezed them shut to try and block out the pain.
After very slowly finishing the rest of the cold food, Harry pulled his mirror out and laid it on his pillow. He flopped onto his stomach and could feel the changes to it. With a small smile on his face, he drifted off, waiting for Draco to contact him.
There was a pause in the speech and then the sound of Petunia’s shoes clacking across the overly polished kitchen floor. The door was opened but Harry couldn’t hear what was being discussed.
“I’d tell you to stop acting like a
In an instant, Harry felt as if he was wrapped in chains before it seemed to sink into his body and the feeling disappeared. He wondered if Emma had felt it too.
Upstairs, Scorpius was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and listening to music. He heard a knock at his door, barely, and shouted, “What?”
Halfway there, he stopped and came to a decision. He whirled around and marched to the other side of the room.
For a moment Ron fought against the truth serum running through his veins and tried to say, “no, I haven’t,” but he lost. “Yes.” He said through gritted teeth.

“Daddy, you’re gonna have another baby?” James asked, hope evident in his eyes and voice.
Sirius tackled the unfamiliar person and yanked him away from his godson.
“Harry, I’m so sorry.” Draco said after he’d finished emptying the contents of his stomach and cleaning it up. “If I would have known something like that was going on, I wouldn’t have been so hard on you.”
“Do you want me to leave? I will if you tell me to.” Draco said urgently. It had barely been more than a week ago that Harry kept Draco hidden from his godfathers. Would he still want that?
Scorpius looked up at the man who still had a hold of him and was surprised by what he saw. He was older, much older, with long blonde hair and had a refined look about him. What surprised the brunette was how familiar he seemed, he just couldn’t place him.
Harry could hear someone calling his name, telling him to wake up. He didn’t want to wake up though. He didn’t want to face the tragedy his life had become.
“I’m so happy for you. Well, I gotta go. See ya!”
Ethan suddenly got nervous. “If you’d rather your dad come back, I’ll leave…”

“Just give it to me.” Harry demanded.
“A few days after my name came out of the Goblet of Fire.” The smaller of the two replied quietly.
Draco was happy to comply. Leaving just the head in, he slammed forward. Harry’s hips lifted off the floor and he threw his head back as his prostate was struck for the first time.

“I suppose, but it won’t be the same. We haven’t been apart for a single day since before Christmas.” Harry whispered miserably. The couple held each other for several minutes that passed by as mere seconds.

Scorpius found himself sitting up. “I like you.” He replied simply before engaging in another scorching kiss.

“Just… don’t do that again.”
Finally he asked, “Why did it hurt you when I tried to pull you up?”
Finally, Scorpius felt his orgasm building once again. “I’m close.” He breathed between harsh kisses.
“Also, Eric wants you to take this potion.” She produced a vial of dark blue liquid.
“I’m going to go see Scorpius.” Harry suddenly announced and took his leave.
“Keeping them clean, turning them daily… don’t you remember anything from getting Lily and Emma’s ears pierced last year?” Harry asked, flabbergasted.
“Ah yes, I suppose the pain in your heart will take much longer to heal.”  He said softly. Harry nodded dejectedly and curled up for warmth now that he didn’t have Draco's body heat next to him.
“What did I ruin?” Draco asked sarcastically. “Your plan to legally rape Harry?”

“Of course, love.” Said blonde
“Why..?”
After a minute or two, the blonde felt Harry's renewed erection against his own and he reached down to stroke it. He felt the vibrations of Harry's moan in his mouth and chest as he kissed him harder.
“Do you want a sleeping potion tonight?” Draco asked after a brief silence.
Harry shivered visibly when it touched his skin. “It’s cold.” He said to reassure the blonde boy.
Draco smiled, wrapped his free arm
“What’re you talking about?” The other twin asked as she went through the different colored lipsticks they had available.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he glanced up curiously for half a second.
“Yeah, yeah.” He replied as he dragged a hand through his messy hair.

Draco read the article aloud as his mother and Harry ate their breakfast.
“I should’ve known. I should have known!” The blonde nearly shrieked.
“Sweet Merlin, Harry.” Draco dragged a hand through his hair. “We need to get you to St. Mungo’s. Now.”
“Pott— Harry, contrary to what you might think, I’m not that much of a bastard.” The blonde said as gently as he could.
“Now then, there’s one more thing. Do you want me to be on top?” Draco asked, not realizing what that could imply.
“There!” Harry nearly screamed. “Yes!”
Instantly, he jumped back up from the bed, having sat in something wet. Almost immediately it occurred to him. “Are you in labor?”
he decided to chance a peek at the other person willing to venture into the area.

“Yeah, I haven’t exactly told anybody. I didn’t think it would be a good idea to give the Slytherins anything else to make fun of me for.” Harry replied hastily.
Harry’s head snapped in the direction from which he was being spoken, suddenly remembering who had been in his house. His eyes widened in fear.
Father and son continued with their banter as they followed the smell of hot pizza. When they reached the door to the kitchen, however, Scorpius froze.

bit as they tried to find their balance.
“I’m sorry.” Draco said softly. “I’ll go tell Madam Pomfrey that you’re awake. I’ll be right back.” He said reassuringly.
In the hallway, Draco could hear the clear sounds of intermittent sobbing. He turned to head in the direction it was coming from, but another thought occurred to him first. “Elliot.” He mumbled to himself.
Madam Pomfrey then turned to Draco. “You should have known this was possible.” She practically snapped.
Unfortunately, their love began by Draco discovering a severe trauma the boy-who-lived survived. What started as a tentative friendship quickly blossomed into something more as they continued to spend time together.
Forty-five minutes later and the door to the hospital wing was still firmly shut. Sirius and Remus were sitting together on the floor against a wall, Hermione was attempting, and actually failing, to distract herself with a book, and Draco was furiously pacing in front of the entrance.
Finished with that task, Draco began placing kisses across Harry’s torso and down his stomach. When he reached his goal, he sucked the hardened flesh into his mouth.
Harry quietly got into bed after taking off his blood stained night shirt. For the first time in a long time, he fell asleep smiling.
“Or she. I just think it’s weird calling the baby “it”.” Draco replied as he lay back on the bed and pulled Harry down with him.

The official closed his book. “It’s time to exchange the rings.”
“I don’t want to.” Harry whined and buried his face in Draco's chest.
A few slow, deep thrusts passed before something was struck inside Scorpius’ body that had him seeing stars and moaning, “Ethan!”
“Good. Just don’t be angry when I wake you up in a few hours for round two.”
“Wha… what are you doing here?” Harry asked when the other pulled away, neither of them noticing that the majority of the room was watching them and whispering.
Draco shook his head a few times and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to wrap his mind around what his husband was on about. “Wait… wait. Are… are you talking about sixth year when you told me what Weasley did to you?”
Emma smiled at her patient. “That is certainly some better news. You’re here because you’ve just had a baby. You’re fifth, actually.”
With a soft sigh, Draco said, “Look
“Did you send out the invitations I gave you for your friends?” He started rubbing circles on Harry's knee with his thumb in what was supposed to be a soothing manner. It only made Harry want to vomit or punch him. But he had already resigned himself to his fate and ignored both feelings.
to suppress a shudder at the endearment. He didn’t want anyone other than Draco calling him that.
Forever yours,
When he finally pulled back to look at Draco's face, Harry immediately noticed that something was wrong. The blonde’s eyes and mouth were shut tight and he was nearly hyperventilating through his nose.
The other three were slightly taken aback by Harry's outburst and warily followed him as they were afraid something was going to spontaneously explode.
Harry pulled his eldest child into his arms. “It’s alright. We’re not mad at you.”
“Friends.”
Harry’s face paled drastically and

After being poked and prodded in all of his private places, Pomfrey asked if he wanted to see the baby.
Almost at once, Ethan pulled back until just the tip remained. He slowly slid forward again until his hips were resting against the slimmer ones beneath his own stocky body.
Draco carried Harry into the next

“I didn’t start getting bigger until I was already here.” Harry explained. “Half way through July, I woke up one morning and it was just kind of there. Since then, it hasn’t stopped growing.” He pulled up his shirt, exposing the bump. “I just put two and two together from what Eric told me. He reminds me every single day what he wants me for.”
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed as he ran past the headmaster. “Are you alright?” He asked as he got to the brunette and tried to hug him.
Draco snorted and mumbled, “as if that helps your case any.”
“Good summer, Harry?” Neville asked cheerily, though he gave Draco a mistrustful look.
“How was that?” Ethan asked a little while later once their breathing had returned to a semblance of normal.
Harry just stared at his husband for a long moment. “Scorpius, take this…” He took the antiseptic from Draco and handed it back to the boy. “…and go to bed. We’ll tell you your punishment tomorrow. Your father and I need to have a talk.”

One long soak in bubble filled water later, Harry felt decidedly better, only now he was very tired and ready for a nap. That had been the only reason he got out of the tub to begin with. It wouldn’t do to fall asleep and drown, Draco would kill him.
Harry's legs came around Draco's waist as the older boy began rocking his hips. Their lips parted so Draco could trail them across the other’s jaw and down his neck.

“I highly doubt it’ll come to that.” Draco said. “I think we’d both agree that the next one will be planned.”
“Well, you can’t tell me that and then not give it to me!” Harry said excitedly. He didn’t want to seem selfish but having gotten very few gifts in his life, he really liked getting them.
He whipped back around to face Draco. “Bathroom?” He asked hastily.
“Ron, Hermione!” Harry shouted. The trio ran to each other and embraced.
“I meant, why’d you call me ‘love’?”
Tonks smiled brightly down at them. “I would love to, but my boss here has asked me not to.” She pointed a thumb a Shacklebolt.
Harry yawned again and nodded. “Ok.” He snuggled down into Draco's chest. “I love you, Draco.” He whispered once he was comfortable.
Then, for one brief moment, Harry thought Draco was completely stopping when he sat up a bit to look him in the eye. But then he spoke and it felt like chilly silk running over his heated body.
Harry heaved another sigh and slumped against the headboard, eyes closed. He just wanted to curl up and hide for a while, until everyone forgot he ever existed. Then he would be safe.
“Better, actually.” Harry panted softly.
Harry ran a hand through his son’s dark, sweaty hair. “I’ll be right back.”
“Draco.” Narcissa Malfoy called when she saw them. Draco sped up a little and hugged her when he got to her. Catching sight of Harry a few feet behind him, she asked, “Is this the young man you were talking about?”
“Oh, okay.” He said and unceremoniously shut the door in the woman’s face.

Heart pounding in his chest, Harry held his breath, wondering what the hell Malfoy was up to. He noticed the other teen was anxiously chewing on his bottom lip before glancing up a bit to look him in the eye in an attempt to figure out what he was doing. There was nothing to see, except fear.
Three chapters in and Draco's eyes
“What the fuck do you want?” Harry screeched and started struggling against his bonds.
After an agonizingly long time, Draco’s hardness finally found its destination and slammed into her. She threw her head back and screamed in delight and in no time they fell into a fast, pleasurable pace.
“Harry.” Draco said with a soft
Draco looked surprised. “What responsibility?”

“I wrote a very good friend of mine a letter and I haven’t heard back yet.” He lied. “He probably hates me since I didn’t tell him about the wedding myself.” His voice held little to no emotion in it. He’d have to learn to be indifferent if he wanted to stay sane.
Once that task was completed, Harry
“I’m scared.” Harry whispered to Draco. “It’s just so… bizarre.”
“Brace yourself for this, Mr. Potter.” She said bleakly.
Harry’s demand was immediately complied with. The hard cock inside him slid out slowly before returning just as slowly.

“Fine, just make it quick. I want to go back to sleep.” Harry stated as a warm tongue began lavishing attention on his burgeoning cock.
Professor Snape got right up in his face. “So you think that gives you the right to beat him up and rape him?!”
“Of course, Harry.” The woman replied with a cheery smile.
He quickly racked his brain and came up with only two places Ron would have taken him without getting caught; The Room of Requirement or Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.

“You mean the boy in the next room?” Ron asked, pointing over his shoulder as he did so. “He’s fine. I promise. He came in while I was tying you up but I made sure he got back in bed. He actually thinks we’re related, asked if I was “papa’s brudder”.”
“We’re best mates.” Ron said uncontrollably. ‘Fuck!’
The whine Harry let out turned into a moan when Draco's lips left his and latched onto his throat. He could feel the blood rising to the surface of his skin and he knew, undoubtedly, that a mark would be there for the next several days.
“Emma? Isn’t that…” He trailed off and looked at the woman who was silently occupying the chair on his left.

“You’re a great kisser, Harry.” Draco reassured him. Harry smiled warmly and cuddled up to his boyfriend.

Harry was barely paying attention

Before picking him up, Harry adjusted the boy’s jacket and pulled the hood over his head to ensure he’d stayed dry until they were in the house. Then he carefully scooped him up, shut the door, and ran toward the door that Draco was just reaching. By the time Harry got there, it was unlocked and being held open for him.
“Thanks.”
With a pale hand, Draco cupped Harry's cheek and kissed him gently, hardly more than a brushing of lips. But there was more feeling behind it and it meant more than any kiss they had shared to date.
Draco almost felt his stomach churn. “Oh, Merlin, no!” Harry sighed in relief.
“Are you ready?” He asked when he was up on his knees. Draco could see that Harry was trembling slightly but he wasn’t sure if it from pleasure or fear.
“It’s a simple, outpatient procedure. From what I’ve gathered, they make a small incision in the scrotum, pull out one of the tubes, cut it, tie it off, and put it back.” He quickly described. “You can read about it, if you’d like.” Draco handed the pamphlet over.

Groaning in frustration, Harry picked up the closest item, a wrinkly, gray t-shirt. He realized that it used to be Dudley’s and threw it on the floor to be thrown out later.
“Boy, get down here!” His aunt’s shrill voice pierced the relative silence around him. With a sigh, Harry stood and cast the glamour on his stomach before heading out of his room.
Harry smiled a bit but couldn’t bring himself to laugh like the others. He tore open the other letter and this one he read to himself.
Even though they had taken him in with them, Harry doubted they would let him eat and was extremely surprised when his uncle ordered him a kid’s chicken nugget meal, the cheapest thing on the menu.
“Wow, everyone’s being so nice.” Harry marveled as Draco helped him into their carriage. Behind them, Neville, Seamus, and Dean climbed in.
“I wanted to apologize for the…
“I didn’t think he’d take it this hard.” Harry said sarcastically but with a look of complete seriousness on his face.
Finally, she decided she wanted Draco to stand behind Harry with his hands on the pregnant boy’s slightly protruding belly.
Harry took a deep breath and walked around the corner into the main hall, his eyes immediately assaulted by the bright light of the room.
Harry nodded and then maneuvered them so that they were lying down together. He held Draco and listened to the occasional sniffle or sob until the other was asleep.
Immediately, both boys scrambled up from the couch and each clung to one of the blonde’s legs, beaming up at him.
“Tell them I want sex. That would be more than enough to make them leave.” He answered with a huge grin as they headed toward the train.
The blonde was staring at Harry. Something stirred in his memory but it wasn’t clear. The only thing he knew was that it was about the imaginary friend he’d had for a couple years when he was still very young. He shook his head trying to make sense of what Harry was saying and why it brought these memories with it.
“You really want to parade around
“How are you feeling, Harry?” Draco asked as he sat on the edge of the hospital bed.
Dobby beamed at him. “Thank you, sir!” He squeaked.

“Oh, why do you wear them then?” Now that Draco wasn’t wearing the heels, Harry could see that the man was only two or three taller inches than himself.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Eric started as he took a seat on Harry’s bed. “You seem happier today than usual. Excited for tomorrow?”

Harry grinned back. “A small one. Now, I’m tired and want to go to bed. You should do the same. We can talk more in the morning.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, his eyes fluttering shut as the other teen’s tongue flicked along the head of his cock. “I like that.”

That small action seemed to do the

The fight that ensued was one of
In an instant, Draco was up from his chair and taking the now fussing baby from his distraught husband.
“Draco and I… we’re in love.” He stated simply. Then he explained the true nature of his relationship with the young Malfoy, though he chose to leave about the bit where he got pregnant. He didn’t want to put his friends into shock.
Narcissa pulled her only child into a comforting hug as angry tears began rolling down his face. He was angry at Dumbledore for making Harry go back to that house, Voldemort for making it unsafe for them, and himself for not ignoring the Headmaster and taking Harry home with him anyway.
and allowed his papa to give him the medicine.
“Hmm?”
“It’s only a month, Harry.” Draco said as he wrapped an arm around said boy’s shoulders and pulled them together. “We’ll be together again soon enough.”
“Shhh. Too early.” Harry mumbled and snuggled deeper into the warmth of the blanket and the blonde’s embrace.
“Touch me… please.” Draco begged.
to try and beat Harry at something.
“Harry was
Harry tilted his head back and gave the blonde a small smile. “Of course and… he?”
“Alright, alright.” Harry said, raising his hands in surrender. “I only live a few blocks from here. Why don’t you come home with me and you can get cleaned up? I
“Yeah. We can do that really quick.” Ethan chuckled.
“Anything?” The raven asked with a leer.
Harry held a breath as he reached for a handle on his trunk and sighed in relief when he easily lifted it. He set in on the ground and then reached for Hedwig, who hooted angrily at him for being left in such a small, dark place for so long.
After a few minutes of leisurely thrusting, Draco pulled Harry's arms from around him, slid their hands together, and intertwined their fingers. He then moved so that their lips were just a hair’s breadth apart. “Kiss me, Harry.”
Harry sighed heavily. “I can’t. He’ll kill me.”
The slightly younger man chuckled. “It’s hard to imagine you being nervous,” he responded.
Lucius entered the manor library a moment later. “What is it, Draco?”
“R-ready.”
As he neared the door to the rarely used bathroom, Draco could hear sounds of a struggle and he quickened his pace.
Scorpius sheepishly rubbed the back of his head. “Nowhere. Just hanging out with a friend.” He replied softly.
“Yeah, much better.” Harry answered without looking at him.
their understanding and said good night.
“Harry, are you alright? What did Mr. Malfoy do to you?” McGonagall asked hurriedly.
Now standing directly in front of the boy, Draco stated, “You can either hand it over willing and get to keep it in the end, or I’ll take it from you and you’ll never see it again.”

“Leave me alone.” The smaller boy mumbled.

swallowed and took another sip.
“Hey there, little guy. You still feel sick?” He asked in a soft voice.
In the car, Scorpius was sitting in
Harry sat up. “Why can’t you sleep here with me?” He asked cutely.
The man in question dragged a hand through his hair. “I can’t say, but…” He trailed off and looked at the man he once called ‘father’. “I don’t trust you.” He suddenly stated, “but I need you to watch my children while I apparate home.”
When Harry came to, he found himself in his bed, hands bound behind his back and gagged.
Harry sighed. “I know what you mean.” His sentence was followed by a large yawn.
“Before.” Harry answered quickly, “And I don’t think Dumbledore knows.”
“Potter?” Draco asked curiously.
Draco, not being tired at all, just laid there and held Harry for a few hours until he finally did fall asleep. He didn’t want Harry to wake up alone.
“Emma Haysley.”
children now, plus, a grandchild, and I love them all dearly. But… I think it’s time to stop.” Draco slowly and cautiously explained.
“I am never leaving this bed.” Harry said happily.
Emma inside, and all of you start getting ready to go.” He softly ordered.
Draco laughed, released Harry's hand, and turned his attention to his own breakfast, both ignoring the stares and excited whispers.
the end, he was visibly shaking.
surreptitiously pulled out his wand to cast a few locking charms on the door.
“O-okay.” The younger boy stammered, his eyes fixing on Draco’s still living erection.
Draco lifted Harry’s chin. “You have nothing to apologize for. You’re a pregnant, moody teenager. I’d expect nothing less.”
As the two continued to make-out, clothing was slowly shed until they were naked and writhing together.
A squeal followed by a giggle filled the air as Harry tickled a four month old Scorpius’ tummy. The infant then reached down and pulled the toes of his left foot into his mouth. Harry tickled him again and nearly received that foot to his face.
It was getting late, nearly 10 o’clock as Harry Potter made his way home from work. The sun had gone down hours before and the road was wet with early spring rain.
their ribbons around their waist. “There, perfect.”
“Of course.” She said with a kind smile. Then she went to out to the corridor to retrieve the blonde father-to-be.
Ten minutes passed and Draco returned with pizza. He walked into the kitchen where Harry was setting the table and put the two boxes on the counter.
Harry laughed heartily. “Oh, that’s what you’re on about? I thought it was something serious. Or, bad, at least.”
“Well… I suppose I could grace you all with my presence.” Scorpius replied cheekily as he stood up from his bed and stretched. His shirt rode up with the action and Harry noted the slight bump he saw there with no small amount of anxiety.

“Wow. That… that would mean…” Harry stammered.
Green eyes flicked up at him for a moment before losing focus once more.
Warnings: None.
“Stop what exactly?” The raven-haired man asked, dripping with confusion.
“Where’s Healer McNamara?” He asked, nearly in a panic.
Finally, when Harry was about ready to give up, it felt like something gave way and a few seconds later, the cries of a newborn infant filled the air.
“No, I’m glad that you didn’t. If you had, they might have shipped you off to Azkaban. What use would you be to me if you were in prison?” Harry whispered and then yawned.
“How are you feeling?” Ethan asked Scorpius when the small family was finally left alone with little Olivia sleeping in a bassinet near the bed.
“Besides, what would you have done if you had found me broken and bleeding like that?” Draco asked. Harry just shrugged at first but the older boy gave him time to think about his answer.
Harry's plan finally unfolds.
“Are you sure you want to do this now, Harry?” Draco asked quietly as the blonde woman came into view. “I can always tell her everything later so she can get used to the idea before you come live with us.”
Applause sounded throughout the room as the blonde man stood and made his way to the stage. The clapping died down as the man reached the podium, but before a single word could pass through his lips, a loud shout of, “papa!” filled the room. He searched for a few seconds before he spotted his son hastily making his way toward the stage looking frazzled and frightened.
The obviously bottle-blonde woman
This time Draco moved his lips slowly against Harry's hoping to coax a response out of him. Surprisingly, he felt Harry's lips moving with his almost right away.

The next morning, Harry woke up feeling extremely giddy. Everyone was giving him strange looks except Ron. Ron was confused and angry that Harry could be so happy after last night. He’d thought that he’d taken care of that.
Draco attempted to tug his arm out
Draco scoffed. “You don’t know my father. He likes things the traditional way, which means no bastard children and certainly no homosexual sons.

After the door closed, Draco got up and walked to the door. He could hear Harry retching on the other side. He knocked when the sound stopped.
“Really.” The blonde said with a feral grin. “And what exactly does “do it for you”?”
“Pomfrey now, then we’ll talk about seeing Dumbledore.” Harry said stubbornly.
that were silently watching their brother dig himself a deeper hole.
After a few moments passed, Scorpius experimentally shifted to slide the cock inside him out slightly. The pain was mostly gone now.
“Don’t worry, I won’t.” Draco said, much more calmly than he actually felt at the moment, and smiled at Harry.
Draco picked up a heavy, brown, square package. “Mrs. Weasley.” He tore the paper off to reveal a lovely blue sweater with a silver ‘D’ in the center. Folded inside the sweater was a five pound block of homemade fudge. “Nice.” He exclaimed.
