Hermione's words come out in a heaving sob, the disillusionment cracking with her concentration, her grip tightening painfully over burnt-orange fur.
I lost my godfather to the Veil when I was young. His passing hit hard, his absence like fragments of my future torn off and left to fray. “Such a pity,” others said, and I would nod, a silent rage unwinding in the back of my throat.
Hermione smiles in near tears. "You've never actually said that you believed in my campaign before."
"They're not
“He didn’t say much about you,” Draco said. He stood in the middle of Harry’s bedroom wearing trousers and a clean linen button-down rolled up to his elbows.
Sunshine drips from Draco's face like tangerine juice beading down a glass, Sunny D but without the fake stuff. Liquid sunbeams bottled up in a human body, mouth bright and sweet as the first moment in a morning when Harry remembers why he's alive.
Draco takes Harry by the wrist and kisses the back of his hand. His throat is thick, but he doesn’t cry.
Harry doesn't know what to do after Ginny's gone, so he makes himself a drink and watches the people walk by outside his townhouse until he's so bored that he can't think clearly anymore, as if a scarf's been wrapped around his brain.
"It's just so—
"Merlin, grow up," Draco snips back. "You don't like closets? Fine. No closets." He slashes his wand once, viciously, and the door to the closet door melts back into the wall as though it never existed at all.
Harry slams the fridge shut.
I hung the plastic bag in my window. Sun shone through the thin film, and
"Cool. Love you too." Harry wiped his mouth. "Hold on."
What a waste of a night.
"Good job," Harry grins. He gives Draco's knee a squeeze. "
pensieve daydreams for
him."
"Which means…"
“Can’t. Well, shouldn’t. I’m sick.”
"Tell me."
"You come to me," Harry said. The pizza flopped distastefully in his grasp, the cheese already congealed.
The road is two-way, and they’re headed south, so Draco’s window on the passenger side looks out to where the sea reaches sky. It’s almost four, and the sun hangs low like a ripe pomelo. They’ve got the wireless on a frequency that blips between mariachi and opera and sometimes fizzles out to static, white as seafoam.
They order pizza for dinner and sprawl over the bare floors to eat it, their chewing reverberating grotesquely off the empty walls. Ginny eats three slices, then says that she should show herself out. Harry can't think of a single reason she shouldn't, so she grabs a broom and disappears up to the attic, leaving him alone again with nothing else to do except sleep.
The toilet flushes in the adjoined loo. Harry waits for Draco to turn on the shower before reaching for the invitation despite knowing full-well its contents. Lavender and Parvati were his friends first, though he already prepared his excuses. Their wedding, only three years prior, was a pastel lace fantasy, the air so thick with strawberry bubble butterflies that Harry coughed up suds for days. He isn't sure he can stomach a repeat performance for all the fruit wines in the world.
"So...can you get me his address?" They ask for it on the volunteer registration form. Harry remembers filling it out and having to ask Hermione for his postal code.
"Yeah, yeah. You too," Ginny says. She yawns, stretching. "Alright, I'm off to bed. Don't call me unless you're literally about to die."
"You're not the same girl who gave Harry up either," Draco says.
"Have you heard of conversion rates?"
Sunshine drips from Draco's face like tangerine juice beading down a glass, Sunny D but without the fake stuff
It isn't fair. Why is it so hard for Harry to decorate a house the way he wants it? He won a bloody war; you'd think he would actually use the extra years he fought for. Even Draco fucking Malfoy could move on. Harry wouldn't be surprised if Draco nestled a whole mini Malfoy Manor within his Victorian terrace; Draco sitting perfectly at home under a chandelier the size of a dining table, darling crystal peacocks squawking this way and that. Draco's bedroom at Hogwarts had been homey too: framed photos, sheets with twice the thread count of the standard-issue fare. Draco would know how to fill up a room.
The people pass by good days and bad, though largely in-between. A woman breaks up with a man, and the man grabs their kneazle and runs
The next week, the boys get caught sneaking into Hogsmeade.
But he’s never been able to stay out of trouble when it comes to Potter.
“Dolohov.” Draco sets the mug down on the table and wipes his lip. When he’d gotten hold of the coffee, Harry can’t recall.
refracted red over my desk. Something about it pleased me, so I sat down to write my mother a letter. I signed and sealed it with my thumb, which burned, but I had salve. Then I put the letter away in a drawer with all the other envelopes. Some were starting to yellow.
Harry’s hand tightens around his belt. “Uh-huh.”
"You have no idea. Harry makes us do No-Magic Mondays. And he's as bad as I am, honest. Last week, he had us bake a quiche, but we don't own a single measuring cup. Or a baking dish. And he wrote down the temperature in Fahrenheit, thinking it was Celsius, so you can guess how well that went."
"Got it," Harry says. He settles on a spot near the end of the handle and signs with his usual unprofessional chicken scratch.
Nobody asks Harry to explain himself. They simply take it as a "Harry Potter" thing. "Couldn't possibly understand what it's like to be famous," Dean said more than once, snorting his disbelief as Harry downed two shots before giving the paps the finger.
So I was free, my hours mine aside for an hour every Wednesday, when Potter came to check my wand. He was my probationary Auror, of course, and he'd bring me something Muggle with each visit, as though I could turn the bad parts of me good by coating my insides with Diet Coke. Of course, it didn't work.
The barman moves down the counter to let them talk. Harry motions him back over.
The scar curves up Draco's chin and cuts across the lower lip in a jagged white line. "You have two hands," Harry reasons, his eyes on Draco's mouth.
"What changed?" Draco tone is cautiously curious; his fingertips a nervous curl into the sheets.
Harry blinks. "What?"
I bite back my “No”. I don’t know why it makes me nervous—the streamers, the silver balloons; the way his tongue curls around my name like he’s saying, darling, or dearest—words I dare to reach for only under cover of darkness but that he displays so plainly, as though hung up.
"Really, Harry?" Draco mutters before waving his wand and painting the walls a vibrant magenta. He mutes the walls to a neutral cream before Harry can protest.
Harry threads their hands together. "You did?"
Draco lives by a thin stretch of park rolled out between two traffic lanes, the cars swimming thick as sardines around the quiet green belt.
Harry's chest twisted. Not recently, of course. He's an idiot for coming.
“What?”
“We’re late,” Draco agrees. His hands slide off.
"I can do, um," Draco says. He waves his wand weakly, and the walls splash with the bright blue of a perfect day for Quidditch, the clouds forming over the ceiling in swirls of eggshell and ivory white.
did an amazing reading of it too, which you can listen to on
They stalk up to the lovebirds. The redhead breaks apart first with an apologetic grin that’s vaguely reminiscent of Ron. The wifebeater guy looks ready to punch a hole through Harry’s chest.
"So won't you open the door for me?"
Draco leaned down and licked a salty strip up his palm.
Malfoy's hair is hot violet-pink under the neon lights, shaved on one side but cascading long down the other. His arms are thrown around the thick neck of some bloke, and he keeps his eyes squeezed shut, his mouth moving to the music. Harry shifts his stance as he watches him, reluctantly intrigued and unable to look away.
It feels good to move on.
"I want this," Harry had said, the future shockingly clear in his imagination. Harry wants to open his eyes to a perfect day for flying every morning with Draco. Strangely beautiful Draco, with his alien blond brows and his sharp, upturned nose, asleep against Harry with a hand curled around his arm. The roof is painted, and it is only a matter of time now.
"I'm not—"
"So we'll go back to my place instead, it doesn't matter. None of it matters, as long as I can get off."
to break up, not that they were.
Harry traces pansies, narcissi. His fingers stop. “Why peonies?”
that space? Do we get reassembled or put back together, or is that Apparition? Can you imagining flowing through the Floo and getting mixed up with someone else, maybe something else, and you come out half-Granger-half-meatloaf-sandwich?”
I woke up in Courtroom Ten the next day and thought I dreamt up the whole thing until I caught sight of my body again, bound in that chair, my hair greasy and dirt under my closed lids.
Next time, maybe.
Harry had the sudden, horrifying recollection of scrawling, “Can’t stop thinking about ur arse. Come down to Leaky. It’s my bday u ugly git.”
Sunlight filters through a gnarled cherry tree outside the kitchen window. Harry imagines Draco taking his morning tea across from where Harry's sitting now. Would he have a book in his lap? Would he reach across the pine table for Harry's hand, for comfort?
Draco makes no move to remove his wrist from under Harry's hand, so Harry thumbs at the joint before raising it to his mouth and kissing it softly. He's too exhausted to think of what this all means or where it's going. Whatever it is, it's good, so he just holds on until he falls into a dreamless sleep.
"Yes, well." Draco could deny it all he wanted, but Lucius did that to himself. "Men are stupid. Oh, I didn't mean
Electric. That's what it was like between me and Potter in Courtroom Ten that summer after the war. Pansy thought I was delusional. "You can't keep living in your head like this," she said, slapping me across the arm. The Auror on duty yelled at her to cut it out, but I didn't mind; she smacked a pack of cigarettes right up my sleeve.
"Yes," Harry says, smiling. His hand moves across the table. Draco flinches back.
Harry came by a few days after, saying Hermione wanted him to pick up a book. "
Ron reaches for Harry's half-empty drink. "We're what?"
No one’s come through since the storm, so it’s slow-going on snowshoes. Draco would take the boat if it were summer, or Apparate if he were desperate—Harry did that, sometimes—but Draco likes the wind’s bite and how every step sinks, leaves a mark; every stride a slough when he could’ve had it easy. It makes him think he’s less of the boy he used to be—like every foot forward is another foot further from his past.
"That sounds like a ton of work," Harry says.
"Oh, shut up." Draco chuckled. "Are you going to demand tea again? I could do with a break from the quill."
"That's not true," Draco says. "I never believed in the prophecy. Believe me, I didn't. Father made sure of it. But, near the end, I started to believe in you."
"Right." Harry claps his hands together. "Let's not make the same mistake. Toilets?"
"It's nice, but it's no Lambo," Ginny says, running her fingers over the leather interior.
Where does the water go when you’re drowning in yourself.
Harry shoved the book back in its place. "You're doing a lot of work for books you don't even like when you could be out flying with me."
"You took a
"You hate Draco," Harry accuses.
"Why don't you throw them out?"
"I know, I know. I hate them, Pansy hates them, everyone hates them."
The kitchen is painted a pale robin's egg blue. Neatly affixed on the wall is a chore chart, and Draco's name scribed between his two roommates. Underneath, Eltanin's name glows red.
ref. That call in the second half, even you'd admit—"
, he said in my dreams. Here, his hand only roams down to the base of my neck, where it sears into my skin like a brand.
"I don't want to lose you again," Harry said. "I love you."
Silver. Right, Harry should have expected Eltanin to be difficult. Harry waves his wand and wills the ink silver.
He was always scared. He was scared of the dark, of hippogriffs, of what Voldemort would do to his family—his future. “I’m always scared,” he said when I asked him if he was scared when Scorpius was born. When he’d first kissed me, and his father had disowned him. Twenty years and some things never changed. He was always scared—cheeks aflame; heart fluttering double-timed to mine.
I’m not sure why I didn’t kill him the moment he started asking questions that had me second guessing my truth. Sometimes you don't know these things until you pull the trigger. And I don't want to do that anytime soon. Not when there’s Augustus Rookwood to murder instead.
"I'm on my way out. I've only stopped by to—to tell you off, because you deserve it, with how you've treated me, you
"Sorry," the bartender says. His brows are knitted with sympathy. Harry's disgusted to discover that it's genuine.
Draco’s Muggle flat is a hotchpotch of three oddly-shaped rooms that sum up to about twenty-seven square meters total in living space. The kitchen table is a fire hazard rammed up against the oven door, but Harry sits at it gamely enough, his legs squished between cans of beans and a box of instant ramen.
"Hi," Harry says as he sprints past Draco.
Ginny stands and waves. Ron drops by their table and eats a fistful of chips in one go, which he washes down with the rest of Ginny's negroni.
“Wh—time?” Draco mumbles, his eyes dragging open, only to close again.
He upended his trunks in search of more books. Books! Where could he acquire more—Flourish and Blotts? No! He needed more bookshelves, first.
"I can get them if you promise not to run," Harry jokes.
“How long is this going to last?” Potter asked Pansy when he dropped Draco off again the following week.
Harry seized Draco’s wrist. “What changed?”
“We can’t leave him.”
"Which book?"
It’s ten when Draco stumbles toward the bathroom. Ginny catches him on the way back and asks if he wants breakfast.
“Draco, I’ve been saying it this whole time.”
, oblivious to my torment. You—"
warnings: werewolves
“I didn’t know Muggle things could be good or bad.” They couldn’t hold a curse. That was why I liked them.
As if Draco needs another excuse to gawk after Potter.
For his mother: 6.53-carat tennis bracelet with dragon tail clasp, charmed with the usual perfumes & protections.
," Ginny insists.
, the same one that I've been chatting up practically every night. He," what was his name again, "kept trying to introduce his blond friend to me, too. What if he was referring to Draco this whole bloody time? That's suspicious, isn't it?"
“You’re lucky that I’ll let you have my move,” Draco says, his hands over my shoulders. “You can have everything I have.”
"Oh, Harry," Hermione whispers. "I'm so sorry I made you feel that way. But you'll always have me." She climbs onto his bed and takes him into her arms as sobs bubble up and foam in his throat. She misses her Wireless interview the following day, but it's fine; she says it's fine.
There’s a commotion at the door. Draco twists in time to see Potter entering the saloon wearing a cowboy’s hat and chaps and boots and generally looking very rugged.
Harry huffs, not quite a chuckle. “Yeah, me too. Things okay?”
The crup whines again, circling between Molly's legs. She picks up the fuzzball and gives him a good scratch behind the ears. "Alright, alright," she says. "I forgive you." He's a cute bugger, she'll give him that. Got a face that can get away with anything. Just like her youngest boy.
Draco swallowed a disbelieving breath. "A celebration? What are we celebrating?" But Pansy had already left to answer the bell.
Harry showed up the day after and ribbed Draco all afternoon before leaving to catch a match with Ron. Draco had dinner alone and then went to bed. He spent all next morning pacing in his kitchen. At noon, he owled Pansy for Harry's address. Except there was no home when he arrived, because of course Harry Potter would secret-keep his house. Draco Apparated home and picked up his copy of
"He's okay," Draco concedes, his fingers tapping over his glass. "Can we talk about something else?"
"No," she slurs. "
A cruise ship came in today as it always does in July when the wind blows buoyant, and everyone wants a little piece of heaven for themselves.
I lost my godfather to the Veil when I was young.
"When you're at the Ministry working till three-am like you are every bloody night. Who the fuck do you think feeds him then? You think food magically—"
“Oh.”
“No, I was listening. You were saying how much you loved me.”
"I can bring it back," Draco says with a guilty swallow, the tips of his ears flushed pink.
"Another?" the bartender asks with a tentative smile.

“You’re besotted, mate.”
for the may run of the drarry discord drabble challenge! the prompt was used. thanks very much to @the-sinking-ship for looking this over for me.
Why does the heart take sides? Always to the left, as though we were born to teeter, unbalanced.
, Harry wants to correct.
I told him to shut up and take us somewhere else.
"Do you think they started hating me after I split from Dean? Or have they always hated me and just been too chicken to show it?"
Harry looked up. Draco dabbed his face with a serviette, little crumbs smearing dark against white linen, like comet tails.
, who prompted "my empire, for this."
"We can save the rest for Ron. He loves these Oompa Loompa chips."
Harry snorts.
"Maybe I should keep this one," Harry says about the one in his bedroom.
The man grins, his canines flashing. "You know him? Bit of a screamer, bit of a biter, that Malfoy. They all come out of Hogwarts that feisty?"
Legilimency was Draco's idea. They'd botched another mission as junior Auror partners, neither trusting the other to have his back. "Get it together, or you're both fired," Robards said behind his desk, his fingers steepled like he'd planned it all along. The Death Eater and the Saviour with Unsavoury Opinions, out of his way with only themselves to blame.
If it were anyone else, Harry would've gotten in their face about it already. He'd say something like, "If you wanna fuck me, then you gotta kiss me too." Or "Listen, my bed would be loads more comfortable for your knees." Or, even, "Dinner?" But Draco isn't just anyone, and that's the whole thing, isn't it? One hand down Draco's chest, and Harry's in the second-floor girl's loo again with his robes drenched in Draco's blood. It's a fucked up thing to have done to someone you want to love.
"Why would you do that for me?"
“It’s alright. Albus Severus says you’ve got the memory of a pygmy puff, and—”
The bartender pushes a third drink toward Harry, who downs it before standing up to leave. No use in wasting good alcohol; Ron would be proud of him.
The crup yips once, excited, and drags Molly ahead before skidding to a stop before a tree. He squats, raising his tail.
"Do you actually eat any of these? Or do you just let them sit, like some museum artefact? Private collection of Harry Potter's discarded sandwiches and chips. Notice the teeth markings in this one, that's from the Awful Toothache of 1999—"
“Where does what go?”
Draco spoons two level teaspoons of sugar into Harry’s teacup. The cup chimes with every stir, Malfoy silver ringing sweet against fine china.
"About your roommate," Ginny says. "Harry says he's blond?"
Malfoys never borrow. Draco learns this the first time he reaches for Father’s quill and receives his own instead. It’s an easy lesson, and he swallows it comfortably as he does the word “mine”:
"Do you want the address or not? You're going to have to choose."
Draco saw Potter all around the Healer Conference though he never got within five feet of him. Mostly he saw Potter’s name under bylines or citations or speaker bios which, even without his illustrious career as Harry Potter: Dark Lord Destroyer, was several paragraphs long. Draco’s own career could be summarised as “the ravings of one man’s self-serving quest to redeem himself in the study of the prolonged effects of exposure to dark artefacts on the human psyche”. It was research deserving of an “oh that’s nice” at best, and he was fully prepared to avoid Potter’s notice today as he had all those other days and months and years after the war.
But can you really explain an entire existence in a slice of a few hours?
“You can’t drop me in medieval Merlin-knows-what dressed up like some wicked witch and expect me not to — mmph!”
“It was just an idea.”
. You…" Draco's words sputter, his chest heaving. "Fuck, do you really hate me that much?"
Harry stops Draco's wand with a hand on his wrist. "You keep doing that," he says. There's a soft, confident grin on his face.
“Not that it’s bad,” Jamie adds quickly, ever the thoughtful eldest.
"You don't enjoy making money by merely existing?"
For @drarrymicrofic prompt dangerous by big data
morning, with little beyond your lover's eyes and the murmur of nonsense between him and you; soft as kitten paws, strong as trust.
No, not quite. Draco's been an itch under Harry's skin since the day they met. Whatever Draco is, is more than quid pro quo, though Harry doesn't understand how.
“Have you ever considered the glow of a candle in a dark room,” Draco says in the still space between them, his eyes a shining yellow as unblinking as the moon.
“You think this is a uniform?”
at Hogwarts, but now he picks up Harry's calls, even when Harry's been a shit to him. Was it really so farfetched to assume that Draco would always do exactly the opposite of everyone else?
She wipes her eyes. "I guess I should say that I broke up with Ron."
"No reason!" Ginny yells back, but the darting look she gives Harry tells him that whoever this woman Ginny wants to desperately "hold hands with" is, she's mad rich.
"So close them," Harry says, and Draco's mouth curls so that his teeth show, pearl-white.
I had nothing to say to that, but we kept looking into each other’s eyes until finally he opened his mouth again and asked if I believed in redemption.
Ginny leaves after to meet up with her friend for whom she's divorcing Dean.
Hermione wrinkles her nose. "Was it good at least?"
that woman? Girlfriend? Harry frowns.
In Little Whinging, what Harry remembers are the driveways rolled out before every squat house, lawns mowed flat, a stretch of sidewalk so straight that you could measure with it. What Harry remembers is trailing after the fumes putt-putting from Vernon’s dull-grey car as it took Dudley to school and Harry behind it, too-big trainers scuffing on the pavement in a meandering, unrushed lethargy, the sky a uniform blue all over, as though filled in with a single button-click.
“Potter? What are you doing here?” Draco gasps, standing up. There’s a warmth near his crotch as Pansy spells away his spill (bless her).
"Good," Ginny says, her hands clasped around a cup of tea, "because I'm going to need you to tell her that I have a girlfriend."
I waited one day before I came up behind him on the street and shot him twice. Just pressed the barrel into his wool coat and pulled the trigger. Then I caught him around the waist and moved his body to the side to watch the light die out of his eyes. You know, to make sure I’d done the job right.
Harry slides both his palms behind Malfoy, under the elastic of those joggers, and squeezes. Malfoy gasps, twisting back in time for Harry to capture his lips. Harry slides onto the broom behind him, wrapping an arm around Malfoy's waist to grasp at his cock.
“This can’t be safe,” he declares. And then he takes a sip.
"How much ice did you want again?"
"What does he do again?" Ginny asks Draco.
"Yeah, it was, well. Brilliant. Beautiful. What did you think?"
Harry steps past her and unlocks the front door.
"What? You're leaving?"
"I'm not afraid of that." There's a tremor in Draco's voice. His head's bowed, and he has something clenched in his fist, though Molly can't see shite from her angle.
Harry rolled his eyes. "And what? Get banned from the league for unruly conduct? Ginny's right—we're twenty-six years old. We can get into real trouble for pulling this kind of shit now. Let's go."
Harry could use a little tolerance tonight. He smirks. "When do you get off?"
For @drarrymicrofic prompt, sunrise/sunset.
It scared Harry how love worked; how Draco could get away with acting like Harry was the crazy one when it was his father who’d exploited Harry for fame.
“I’ll be sure to have words with him,” Harry interrupts, wary eyes on his middle child. “Now, class, as you can see"—he gestures to the enclosure behind him—"we’re studying hippogriffs today.”
Harry shrugs, feigning nonchalance. "Sure."
"I, what?" Realisation dawned over Harry. "No, you can't. Ghosts—"
Morning. A
In truth, all that spacetime local geometry talk just went in one ear and out the other. No matter how many times Draco explained it, the universe refused to hold shape in my mind. I likened his research to taking a drink of sea water and going, yeah, it’s salty, but not like salt on a pretzel; more like salt mixed in a broth. And then someone asks,
A crash in the bush, ten metres away. Two men: swearing, shouting, branches snapping under heavy boots.
"I want to break up."
The blond man sits in a booth until another man hits a gavel on the surface before him. The room empties of sound as a single hooded entity enters the vaguely empty room. Harry watches the hooded entity lift up the chin of the blond man, and all he thinks next is:
"I like stories," Harry said some weeks later, after he'd completed the herculean feat of finishing three novels. "But I wouldn't trade all the love stories in the world for what we have now."
"I'm bi," Harry throws out on the table alongside the plate of chocolate cake and raspberries, the after-dinner apéritifs.
"A pity," Draco said. "What will Hermione do now?"
"What’s wrong?” Draco asked, frowning.
Eltanin winces. "I haven't Vanished the rubbish for the week yet," he explains. He starts the kettle with a wave of his wand and starts rummaging around in the cabinets, moving objects this way and that until he finally brings out a white porcelain vase. He presents it for Harry's approval. "Like it?"
Harry leaned back against the bed pillows and reached for his own book—the fourth volume of
It doesn’t come as a surprise to Draco when he graduates Auror Academy. He scores well enough on the written exams that the practicals can’t flunk him out entirely. Still, he’s left speechless when Potter approaches him after their graduation ceremony and shakes his hand, saying, “Sorry about Officer Boyle; he was mean. See you around.”
They'd buried Draco no more than a week ago, and—Harry steadied his breath. "Draco. You know I can't."
"Uh-huh," the youngest one says, suddenly shy. "Mummy says you're why I can go to Hogwarts and not be scared anymore."
That summer, his cock in our fist, sparks in my heart when we bought him trainers that didn't squeeze his toes. He kept surprising me, little reminders here and there that I existed outside of my own mind. Or his mind. Whatever. It was nothing I wanted, and that was what made it good.
Harry blinks, three dizzying points of light swirling his vision. He shakes his head. Right. There's Parkinson with her hands on her hips, looking like an anaconda escaped from the zoo. Harry hadn't recognised her with her hair dip-dyed pink. And she definitely didn't grow those boobs until after Hogwarts. Except, why does Harry care about
“That’s not a flying broom. I use that to sweep the fireplace, how did you even,”
“Yeah, it’s not bad,” Albus agrees. “But nobody else gets it, you know?”
“And they won’t need dinner or cake, just—you know. Wall space. Which we’ve plenty of.”
"Then what's the problem?"
"Give me some fucking credit. Potter doesn't go handing out forgiveness like some sort of clemency Robin Hood. I bloody
“Just helping him out. I’d do the same for you,” Harry said again and again, and, again and again, I swallowed around a funny feeling of despair.
They move to the living room. The fireplace ignites upon entering—it's charmed to do that—giving the otherwise stark room a strange, warm tint.
"For goodness sake," Hermione huffs. "You're trouble enough for me as is, running up the tabloids with your sleeping around. All I'm asking is for you to lay low for the next year while the election wraps up."
Harry closes his eyes and lets the music overtake his senses.
"Oh, come on," the woman in his lap whines, pulling his beard. "You don't remember
"It'll do," Draco said instead, and, wrapping a hand around Harry's dick, squeezed once before shoving his fingers down between Harry’s thighs, to his arsehole. Harry muttered a spell. Clear liquid pooled in Draco's hand.
"Good," Harry says. Is that what Harry is, too? Another item checked off the list to redemption? I fucked Harry Potter, so I can't be bad? The thought makes him sick.
"I want to help you."
The dressing down comes as soon as they slide into the booth. "Molly's been intolerable," Hermione confesses as she fills up their glasses with an Aguamenti. "She keeps arguing that Muggle divorce wouldn't be so popular if the Statute was still in place. As if I'm the reason why your wartime teenage romance didn't work out! And I can't even tell her off for it because I
In the brave light of after, stories bloom unbidden from his chest, pushing up and out his mouth, each more indulgent than the last. “Draco does this thing where he peels his oranges with his teeth. Narcissa hates it. She…” He gets lost in the retelling; travels down too many arterioles in attempts to explain why it’s entertaining, or funny, or worth sharing (although they get it, they say, smiling). In truth, Draco is never that interesting
"And you simply willed it into being," Eltanin says. He shakes his head. "Voldemort didn't stand a chance. Do you really not know how impossible the feat you performed was? I suppose your friends are accustomed to it, but Draco must've said
Draco darts out a tongue and runs it across his lower lip. "So do you," he counters.
Draco wore a silver barrette. It was one that Harry recognised from Hogwarts. His eyes were kohl-lined and dark while the rest of him stayed pale. He stared past Harry's shades straight into Harry's soul. And then he started drifting forward.
Hermione flips her hair back in a calculated display of indifference. She's getting good at that. "I need you around. People will think that we don't care about this country if you run off while I'm still campaigning."
"I don't know," Harry says, his confusion rising. "I just wanted it. Is that not how Transfiguration—"
"I don't. But that's never been an issue, so—"
"No, um. Well, we don't really talk." It's probably better that they don't, given how weird it got with the confusing conversation over worth and what Harry deserves.
Bloody hell. Couldn't a bloke get some privacy?
"Is that a problem?" Harry leaned in to get a better look at the title. "
Ginny Accios over a pen and writes the address on Harry's arm.
Hermione gasps. “No, you didn’t.”
, the invitation declares in golden, curling script. Beneath it, Draco marked:
Harry considers it. Most of Ginny's secrets tumble out sooner or later. He could handle waiting. But Malfoy…
Draco’s hand is like ice on Harry’s wrist. “You don’t need to explain yourself. I trust you.”
"I didn't know that," Harry says.
"No, he’s not! When do you ever—"
“So what did you do?” Ron asks.
"You've read it?"
"What?" Harry asks. "Is it not what you wanted? I can change the colour—"
Malfoy twists his arm away.
“You’re telling me you didn’t want to empty a round in his chest just to see what would spill out.”
"Peonies," the florist says, pointing to a bucket. "Mums. Begonias. Dahlias. Daffodils—"
It’s obvious, really. The worst part of any story always comes down to love. Love can waste a good man; make him rather drown with want than come up and face the truth.
"She's a BroomBod exec. You know, the one you slammed the door on not an hour ago? How do you do it? Why does everything you do fuck with my life?"
“Then he said that the Humplevorts were down his trousers, so I had him take them off,” Luna says. The fire licks at her smile; ignites it.
"It's fascinating how masterfully the world parallels problems we have with our own systems of power. And the mind-reading was
Draco’s original plan had been simple: reclaim his books, then leave. But now that he was here, he found he wanted to linger, to run a hand over all the wallpaper, looking for both what Harry kept and what he covered up.
When you say my name in my dreams, your voice is as small as the hours dark, and the Rs curl under your tongue, fond. Under the moon, the skin above your wrist is milky white and washed of its usual meaning. You say it still stings, but not in the ways that matter.
Too hot, too damp, too cold, too dry — Harry can’t ever seem to get comfortable at Hogwarts anymore. It becomes especially bad in winter when the air dries out so severely that any time Harry pulls on a jumper, he pops out looking like Bellatrix’s nerdy younger brother. Hermione says it’s because one of the Death Eaters messed up the HVAC when coming through the Vanishing Cabinet the year before, so Harry takes that to mean that it’s Draco Malfoy’s fault, again. He stops Draco in the halls and shoves him up against the wall by the robes, his skin prickling, Draco’s hair standing up like a dandelion poof. “You feel that, Potter?” Draco asks, and Harry shivers. There’s always electricity between them, he doesn’t need static to remind him of that.
. There's something about the privacy of a public street, of being outside. Like no matter how loud you shout, the words won't echo back to haunt you. You can just let it go, and laugh.
Draco stiffens. "No."
“The way it burns you when you get too close.”

,” Draco spits.
They're at Ginny's new flat in Chelsea that's windows, windows, windows. "Like living in a fucking greenhouse," Ginny says, "but I love it. What does that say about me? Is Neville still single these days?" But of course he isn't—Neville married two years out of Hogwarts to someone Granny Longbottom set him up with when he still wore nappies.
Crookshanks springs onto the table in an angry yowl. Hermione meets Ron's eyes over the kneazle's gnarled head and sees Ron's lips thin in fury.
against his chest until the faint scent of lemon lulled him to sleep. If the characters in the story could forgive each other for mistakes made in the past, then maybe Draco—
a drama queen."
"Shut up," Harry laughs and shoves up onto his elbows. He pulls her hand over his heart. "You feel that? Not a fucking pump. You've murdered me with your lies."
Finally.
"Three other bartenders are working right this second, for the record," Ginny whispers in Harry's ear as they take their seats at the bar.
"Is your friend alright?" the server asks with a nervous bite of their lip.
warnings: grief, hints of past major character death
"Why do you think?"
Draco snorted. "You'd think so."
Trash it. Tear it up. Don’t like it? Try again. Two steps forward. Three leaps back. Say the wrong thing? Time: turn it back. The same face, without the scar. The same arm, without the Mark. Draco could live like this forever. Trying, retrying. Never getting it right.
, he composes on the ceiling. No, it was
The moment the Floo wards lock behind Ron, Harry skips the shower and heads straight to his bedroom. He takes the memory of Malfoy at the club into bed with him and savours it, rubbing his hand on the rough denim over his crotch and imagining Malfoy's mouth, hot against it. "Come on," he whispers into his pillows as his jeans constrict until he aches.
Draco growled, trying to sit up and flip them over, get in control again. "Let me fuck you," he said. "Let me fuck you proper. I'll show you, show you what it's like with a Malfoy—"
It's only during a lull between tracks that he hears the incessant ringing of his doorbell. He casts another amplification charm, but it's too late. Whoever's at the door has murdered the vibe.
"Weasley," Parkinson growls. "You're getting a divorce. I fucking hate you."
. The reporters have their cameras out, and you've got all your worst manners on display."
Harry eyes the emerald swirling his glass. “No?”
Muggles paid a thousand pounds for a single, one-ounce Galleon coin. Draco bought a copy of every book at Waterstones and filled up the shelves in the second bedroom. But there was still his bedroom, the third bedroom, the fourth bedroom, not to mention the downstairs—so many shelves and never enough books. "Let's try the second-hand shops," Pansy suggested, so they compiled a list and tore through Muggle London, buying torn paperbacks and coffee-stained anthologies by the bin.
"I see what you meant about the book," Draco told Harry over a low bookshelf at a second-hand shop in Chelsea the following afternoon. Draco had convinced the house to add new storage beneath the kitchen nook, which meant: new books! And Harry had come too. He was always in Diagon Alley for some reason or another. Picking up onions for Hermione was today's errand of choice.
“No, I —,” Draco sighs and stops to rub his eyes. “I didn’t expect you to show up.”
I spotted Draco Malfoy outside St Mungo’s and followed him all the way back to Malfoy Manor, where he was alone. It was easy to tail him. I wore my Invisibility Cloak most hours now. I got comfortable enough to forget I was wearing it. Scared the right shite out of Hermione sometimes.
Draco brought out two plates and two forks. “We came around to Grimmauld plenty of Christmases,” he said once, months ago. Maybe years. It was hard to know how long it’d been when the clock only spoke in hours, minutes, seconds.
"Yes," Draco said. "But as you can see, I can't open a bloody thing with these useless things." He shook a fist.
ask for his name?) slides three plastic cups in front of them. Ron and Ginny, in a rare moment of Weasley-sibling unity, knock the entire contents back before smashing the empty cups down on the bar.
"It's beautiful," Harry says about Draco.
Malfoy's breath is hot over Harry's hand. "Everything. The world," he says.
The woman slides off her stool and starts elbowing her way over. Harry's about to make his usual excuse for the loo when he spots Draco Fucking Malfoy in the crowd.
"Oh, never. Bickering all day and night. Broke up a few times, even. Though we always get back together."
He’s changed, he said. It won’t be like it was. Come over, I’ll show you how. And he’s right. The years passed and we grew out of sync, our skin shed into new people. Things will never be the same. But I can’t help but pretend they are, close my eyes to the gleam of wicked in his eye. Instead, I think, how nice it is, for the devil to spend his afternoon by my side, laughing his borrowed laugh and smiling how Draco used to, when he wasn’t so dead. Trying so hard to be the man I used to love, I nearly love him back.
Same-same-but-different. Almost-but-not-quite.
Dean appraises Harry with narrowed eyes. "Is that true, Harry?"
"I don't think— " Harry starts but shakes his head, changing his mind. "It's great," he says. Watching Eltanin handle Draco's daffodils makes Harry's hands itch, but he can't be choosy. The flowers are in Draco's kitchen, regardless of how they get there.
“I mean.” Harry gnaws at his lip. “I think it’d be nice.”
"Yes, I know," Harry waves off. "Sorry. You look like someone I used to know."
Harry laughs. He has no idea what he wants to say, but Draco doesn't need to know that. "Alright," Harry says. "We have a deal. You first."
"Then what is it?"
In summer, your blood boils under the sun, smothered beneath an invisible beast that only lets up in the dark. The fear simmers out of your bones; the sun so long to sleep that it catches you by surprise when it does, and you find me at the end of your shadow.
Harry blushes. "I don't
"You can say his name, you know."
Pansy pulls out her wand from her Birkin. “So you’re telling me that you went on a date with Potter because you wanted to hold hands with him.”
"He can have them," Ginny yells in the small space of Harry's car. "All they do is nag nag nag. It's all so
“Sure.”
He smirked. "I know better than to run from Death."
. I'm absolutely floored that a Muggle came up with it. You think that's sad?"
"It's only for a few weeks until I get this all catalogued." Draco looked up. "What's up?"
"We know!" the tall one pipes up. "You did it with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood…" the girl rattles off a long list of names from memory so complete that she might as well be reading off Harry's address book.
“Pity.”
The Pensieve waits, though my feet refuse to move. I wallow around the space of my missing memory. I feel around the edges until my hands bleed raw. But the extraction is clean. Complete.
strums through Harry all through dinner. "Everyone deserves to be loved," announces Susan in a champagne-doused toast, so why not Harry? He won't ask for all of this. He doesn't even want a vow. Just something, anything declared out loud.

“You did.”
have been him.
“The way it hides darkness in the depressions of your face,” Draco continues, jaw slack and nearly prophetic. “The way it projects your shadows up walls and looms them large, inescapable.”
Harry gets up after Draco and watches his robes billow around him as he leaves. It reminds Harry of Snape, except it doesn’t, because they’re a deep cerulean, with silver detailing. Ravenclaw colours, on a Slytherin. Except Draco has never looked so good.
think you can do better than having sex with whoever decides to show up at the club that night," Hermione sighs. "Watch out for yourself, okay? Love you."
“But where does it go?”
"No."
"What kinds of questions do you ask?"
"You won’t run?"
Draco dragged a hand through sweaty hair. He’d spent all night searching, and weariness slogged through him. "That book meant something to me."
"You're both bloody lucky I still work here," Dean sighs as he approaches the holding cell. He leers at them between the bars with his arms crossed and his mouth a stern grimace. "Seriously? Again?"
Wax drips down the walls to the dungeon. Inside the mirror, I see what I desire most desperately. But Potter is not as lovely as the mirror claims. Shadows carve across his face as he turns to me, fingers white over the edge of Luna's cot. There is something so lonesome in his eyes that I, well. I start seeing myself.

Mother’s robes were a black that seemed to swallow up all life around her. In them, my vision narrowed.
"That's a superb idea. Thanks very much, don't mind me as I take a peek—" Harry backed up, and there was the sound of hurried steps up the stairs.
“I’m sorry. I know you wanted to try surfing,” Draco says. There’s sand kicked up on the back of his legs, and he’s starting to sweat, the sun beating down heavy with guilt.
"Come on," Harry said. He jerked Draco's arm hard so that Draco fell over him, then twisted to straddle Draco's waist. "Come on," he muttered again, tacky hands holding Draco's cock up as he hovered over Draco, teasing.
It's Malfoy.
"Right, right. Allergic to the word
"Oh, yeah," Ron says. "I thought you might like it. I got it from a Japanese place a few days ago."
"Oh, too hard," Draco said, though he was already smiling from the question. What a joy to reflect through all the brilliance he'd ever read!
A roil of envy lurches in Harry's gut. He slips out his own phone and thumbs through his unread messages: two BroomBod reps and a bloke he doesn't remember fucking. Harry hovers over Malfoy's number, hesitating for only a second. "Come over," he types. "I want to show you something."
Maybe tomorrow, Harry will.
"It's Draco's technically, but I use it a lot more. It's okay. Good in a pinch when I'm too lazy to get dressed for the gym," Eltanin explains as Harry feels across the broom for a spot to sign that minimises the chances of Eltanin rubbing his balls all over Harry's name.
"Fuck. Fuck, fuck," Malfoy whimpers and reaches down to pull at Harry's hair. "Fuck, your mouth, god. Fuck. Harry."
The problem with shots was that two was fun and four was fine, but six and seven and eight turned nine and then you found yourself stumbling in an unlocked stall that was very much occupied by a Harry Potter sitting on the toilet with a box of pizza in his lap.
Draco says I can have it back. He says he’s very sorry. He says he meant it as a gift, so I can see my mother with my own eyes, in a sense.
Why not?
She's not wrong. But it's not something Harry wants to admit, so he tells her to shut up and asks about Neville's book club in the five minutes they have left.
No, it's not, Harry wants to protest. Not without you in it. But there's a stubborn glint in Draco's eyes that tells Harry that no matter what he says, there's no convincing Draco otherwise.
"We can try it," Harry says.
Was he really going to fuck Harry Potter? Maybe he should stop, think it through—
. Harry Potter,
"Nonsense," Draco says. There are still clothes hung up, which Draco unloads onto Harry's bare mattress with a single tug of his wand.
," Draco said. He handed the book to Harry, who stroked the embossed title with gentle fingers before passing it back.
"Merlin's saggy balls, no," Ron chortles. "Yeesh. I hope not. But who even knows with those old Pureblood families."
"Mm," Harry said. "No."
The skin between his eyes. The minutes between his hours. The moments between our meetings. How do I explain that the spaces between his days and the nights he spends alone are, in a way, still mine? That I love him for everything he does as much as for everything he doesn’t? How do I explain that the shape of his being is more than his body; that, to me, he is the universe?
“So why don’t you?”
Inspired by documentary This is a Robbery: The World’s Biggest Art Heist.
I don't know why I tried. Boredom, maybe. The better question is why Potter let me. There he was, every day for hours on end, sitting through trial after bloody trial with his back straight and his eyes as dead as a marionette's. I followed the jagged scar down his brow and wondered, like I'd done for years, what went on in that perfect potty brain of his. Until one day, I simply—slipped in.
“Fine,” Harry surrendered, wondering not for the first time how he ended up as the Minister of Magic. He couldn’t help but think that he wasn’t meant for his life. Sure, people listened to him, but only because he’d killed Voldemort. Even his Quidditch victories never felt like his own. He could fly, but he never would’ve made “youngest Seeker in the century” if he hadn’t been so small—if he’d been fed proper meals and his mum’s treacle tart for dessert.
Stuff starts accumulating in the cabin; things like silver spoons, silk pants, photographs, a crystal peacock. It’s all stuff that he’s pretty sure isn’t his but still feels like his when he sees them. Like how someone seems like yours because you love them (when in reality, nothing owns anything (except maybe time)).
Harry wrapped a hand around the door frame and gripped as though determined to stay. "She only wants to borrow it."
“What —”
The bagger gave me the plastic anyway. His smile said I only got away with it because I was cute. Mother said that, too. That I had a face of an angel and the hair to match. For a while longer, anyway. (I was going bald.) Harry said he didn’t care what I looked like, I was rotten to the core. But in a good way. Everyone rots in the end. It was only trouble if you tried to stop.
A woman dressed in a striped mauve power suit waits at Harry's doorstep when he gets back. "Mr Potter. It's so good to see you. I love what you said at Hermione Granger's rally tonight. It was tremendously moving," she says before he can tell her to fuck off.

Draco laughed. "Who knows? Every book has an answer for someone. Maybe even me, in the future. I’m not taking the risk of letting it go."
chic," one of the Patil twins said with a hand hovering over a claw-foot tub of books. "
"I fucking hate that."
Draco slides a slow hand down my cheek. “Let’s try again tomorrow.”
Harry traces a wrinkle down Draco’s palm. He crosses it with his own, his other hand curling down Draco’s waist. When he closes his eyes, he can see their heartstrings all around him, tangled up together. What he remembers is: now.
“Fuck.”
Harry dropped by in his sweaty Quidditch gear, broom still in hand when he found Draco inking in catalog cards at the kitchen table. "Busy?" he asked
His eyes lift over her shoulder, to Harry.
Harry makes a face. "Am not."
It is a half-tone day; the world washed out and left to dry.
"Cos you're acting like you've never seen a naked man before," Harry said.
There's a pause. Then, Draco whispers, "Oh, Harry," soft as velvet and twice as tender.
"My flat is tiny. And," Draco gasps to a particularly rough jerk of his cock, "and my room's a mess."
Ginny's eyes light up. "You've been?"
Harry's stomach churns. "Why not?"
“He’s got a limp,” Harry says.
Harry’s first case is an armed robbery at Maulfield’s Apothecary that unravels into six months of illegal potions, Muggle gangsters, and goblins. His second case is Draco Malfoy.
I killed Neville in the toilets at Rosamunde's, though of course he didn't see me until I let the Invisibility Cloak slip to my shoulders. Then he started begging for his life. But it was too late; he wrote his fate the moment he took campaign money from Death Eaters. I was just carrying out the ruling.
"Yes, I was just on it," Harry says. "Did something happen?"
. Just whip out the Marauders Map and stalk him how you usually do."
He turned on his heel and walked back to his chambers, to bed.
Thinking about dementor’s kisses thanks to @floydig’s excellent

I have held a hollow man and had his chest fall away until my fingertips are powdered with ash.
"Draco's been doing a lot for Hermione's campaign." Ginny's still chewing on the popsicle stick. It's already starting to annoy the hell out of Harry.
. Potter. Harry. Harry Potter."
Harry jabs Draco with a sharp elbow. He clears his throat, though it does nothing for the grimace carved on his face. “Congratulations, Ian Weasley. You’re a wizard.”
"You can't just insert yourself into my life like this because you want to."
“It’s diner coffee. Sat out warming in a twelve-cup carafe since last night, if I had to guess. I’m not missing out on anything.”
"Sorry," Harry blurts out. "Sorry for being a dick. I was a dick to you for years at Nylon, and you've only been nice."
"Were you burgled?"
Draco asks this question on the first day of winter. The answer comes fluttering from his heart, like a tiny bird warm with hope.
Draco turns to stone, his eyes round and blank, rigour mortis with fear. “Apparate,” he whispers between clenched teeth when Harry does nothing but listen.
My mouth went dry. “Every word,” I said.
Harry watches her spit the rest of her bite out into her hand before vanishing it away. "What are you doing here?"
Potter was Draco’s parole officer, and he didn’t find it funny at all. He harangued Draco to “transform back” for five solid minutes before taking out his wand to cast Finite Incantatem over and over and over, as though it was sheer lack of will and not some bloody blood curse that confined Draco to his hard-bodied shell.
“Who invited you?” Harry demanded.
"I know, I'm disgusting," Harry preempts and rolls his eyes to show how little he cares about her opinion.
Could this broom double as a sex toy? It's not a bad idea. It wouldn’t take much effort, either: a simple adhesive charm would do the trick. Harry just needs a cock. Maybe he could Accio one, or transfigure one out of a kettlebell…though that would be dangerous if the enchantment breaks. Why bother with plastics when Harry had a cock himself?
"They're mad that you disconnected the broom," Malfoy says. "They want you to reconnect it."
Harry's an hour early to Hermione's rally. He's been going through revisions with her speechwriter all week until the parchment practically shone from ink. Hermione's staff stations Harry at the door to wave and shake hands as supporters file into the auditorium. Harry signs a few Snitches (why do people always ask for that? He's not nearly as good as Ginny) and kisses a few babies before he's ushered back again for final makeup.
"Nevermind," Draco said, embarrassed that he recalled their conversation so perfectly when Harry didn’t even remember the title under discussion. "Have you got the onions for Hermione, then?"
For Harry: today, tomorrow, forever.
Underneath, the walls are a stale yellow. Harry drags a finger through the dust over Sirius's mirror, sees a corner of an eye, chapped lips.
"Why not?"
"Magic's not supposed to work with Muggle stuff," Draco said once in a past life. He'd gone out that night and ended up staggering home in Harry Potter's arms when Harry said, "No way we're walking home," and stuck out his thumb. Then the Knight Bus came barreling through.
Harry doesn’t know precisely when others start coming more than he goes, but if he had to guess it’d be around when Teddy brings home Victoire and their firstborn daughter. The babe bursts through the fireplace shrieking, alighting the whole cabin aflame with her wails. Harry takes her from her frazzled parents and rocks her in his arms. He thinks that maybe having the time and space to love and be loved is the best magic of all.
apology fuck. You can have yours tomorrow."
Draco was reading a compendium of fifty-word stories
"Something to do with money. Financial advisor? I'm not sure," Draco says.
Some nights the moon shines brighter than the sun, and Draco lurches up, drenched in it, as though he drowned in his dreams. He can see the moon from the lonely window in his room, the room in Hangzhou that he took up to get as far from his father as he could.
“God no!” Draco squeaks, knocking the entirety of his margarita into his lap. “That’s — no! No!”
No, you can’t. No, you must. No, that’s wrong. No, that’s right. Draco’s favourite word is No, and Harry knows this because they’re Auror partners so they share the same office and the same suspects and sometimes even the same plate of chips, or the same bed. In bed, Draco is even worse, a near litany of Nos. No, we can’t. No, we shouldn’t. No, not like that. No, I’m ready. No, go slower. No, faster. No, don’t leave, please don’t leave.
"Does Draco talk about me still?" Harry asks, straightening up.
"It's a wonder how you don't lose more books, with the way you throw them about like that." Pansy said. She lounged across the drawing-room chaise in a silk bathrobe, a magazine in one hand and the other stroking the silky fur of Petro, their black cat. The cat had turned up during the party and never left. Nobody fed him, and yet he was around all the time. Draco would have suspected that the cat was Harry's animagus, if he didn't know for fact that Harry was a snake animagus. Harry had shown him. His little forked tongue was very, very cute.
puffy along the edges as though, despite all the years, still angry. He soothes a fingertip over the words, sending shivers down Harry's spine. After a long moment, he looks up. "You live in an empty box, and you sleep on a bare mattress on the floor. Your sheets are transfigured from takeaway tissues, and the shower is broken, so you cleanse yourself with barely competent First-Year level Scougifies."
Harry wets his lips. "I don't want your pity," he forces out between gritted teeth, though at this point, he would take anything. He would pay for Draco to hold his hand and tell him what colour to paint his walls.
"You know what I mean."
"I knew I recognised you coming out of this house yesterday." Pansy wedged a foot in and squeezed through the door frame. "How long have you been holed up here? Merlin, you've got a lot of shelves." She found her way to the kitchen and put on the kettle, waving a manicured hand under the floral antique to ignite the flame. "Your mum's old thing?"
"Look at you," Draco sneered. "All dressed up in your Headmaster robes with not a single hair out of place. Did you even grieve at my funeral? Or did you spit in my grave."
"How is it that I'm the only one who doesn't have my shit together?" Harry yells, embarrassingly honest in his anger. "I'm not like you. You were never part of some deranged prophecy. You never had a piece of Voldemort
If Ginny were Hermione, she would have cast a Scourgify on him already. But as she's not, she only sticks out her tongue before snatching the rest of Harry's pizza out of his hand.
Professor Malfoy nodded grimly, his gaze pinned on Harry’s arse—blackboard—mouth—arse—
(See the end of the chapter for
“And the worst part is. You know what the worst part is, Potter?” Draco says. His fingertips press white against the empty glass.
"I meant mine."
The tapestry. The locket. The diary. Burn it. Starched sleeves soaked in bad thoughts from bad blood. Bloodlines spilt over bathroom stones jagged mirrors and fire. Chase the rancour of Black blood! Burn him, chimaeras, choke his breath, devour his soul!

"Hold on?"
“I wish you’d say something,” Potter said an hour later, his throat dry.
I slam the book shut and send it rocking back onto the shelf.
“Look, don’t hold it against me, but but but I may have taken your broom out and crashed it.”
"That's the one."
“I’m not sure I should,” Harry said with some reluctance because the drink was very pink, and decorated with a paper umbrella and a juicy bite of pineapple—his favourite. He wouldn’t admit to that most pub nights, but today was his birthday, and he was very, very wasted. He didn’t remember the last time he’d been this sloshed since, well, nearly two months prior, when he and Ron had shown up two weeks too early to Dean’s birthday. Malfoy had been there instead, celebrating his twenty-sixth wearing jeans so tight that Harry swore there was some sticking charm on them that made them impossible to look away from, because why else would Harry’s eyes be glued to them (Ron assured him there wasn’t). Which reminded him—
