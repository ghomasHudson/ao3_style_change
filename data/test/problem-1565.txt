“Then can I retell my day to you? It might help me write things down a little easier?” Harry gestured towards his journal.
“You mean due to the fact that Sirius and the Weasleys are attending?” Remus frowned. It was hard to vocalise the idea that the Malfoys and the Weasleys were actually related despite the fact that they actually were, especially since the two families had been so aggressive towards each other for a considerable amount of time.
Thus, the two young boyfriends passed the time, lost in the other’s scent, skin and being, until they were called down for breakfast.
Al carefully raised his hands, showing for Harry to calm down. He realised that he had raised his voice slightly, and settled back onto the floor with a little less passion. “While I think that your choice is a far better one than what I chose to make, I have to request that you do not speak to him yet.”
“That’s a weird name on a dog…” Teddy commented after repeating the name to himself. “Do Muggle dogs just… buzz? That can’t be it.”
He was only given enough time to reply to the other man’s first question, before he was quickly surprised by another question. One that prompted direct eye contact with the man as to make sure that he hadn’t misheard him. He was about to object to the proposal, but the continued ramble of the other’s convinced him that he did not like Potter’s assumption that he would do… exactly what he had planned on doing. Failing to take anything else into consideration, Draco decided that he would not give his host the credit of having read his mind, thus opting to surprise himself with the answer.
“It’s like… a death horse…? A starved black reptile corpse horse?” Ron struggled to describe it. “Don’t you remember during your second year when I was scared of the carriages which took us to Hogwarts?”
“Then you do know the man,” Mrs. Malfoy confirmed before turning back to Molly. “My husband was returning from one of the meetings and I was returning from the library as I enjoyed the solitude among books since my young years. We both turned a corner and startled the other, although we did not collide or anything akin to that. Lucius was dressing far more extravagantly back in the day,” she chuckled softly. “He was dressed up from head to toe, and appeared to sparkle like a jewellery piece in the sunlight. I believe he might have been wearing green. He was somewhat less prone to simply black when we were younger. He was pale as a ghost, his skin smooth as marble with hair like silk, and eyes as grey as if he was a host of the moon herself. I recall feeling breathless to be in his presence.”
“You flatter me,” Sarmad smiled at Harry, making no effort to hide his fangs. “Had you been older, I would have eagerly accepted your blood as a donor of mine.”
“But I did do those things too… Except for writing the book. I didn’t do that. I thought of doing it, but I didn’t.” He rubbed the back of his neck, looking somewhat stubbornly to the side.
“The primary reason as to why resurrections rituals are impossible during normal circumstances is that there is no true way to call the person back into a body after they have died, but with a horcrux, that step could be completely logically and magically explainable.” The mind reader continued to speak.
Harry’s attention focused on the bed, not because of the lavish pillows, or the extravagant pattern upon the blanket, but because he could see a pale envelope resting against the pillows. He had seen it as soon as he had entered the room, but now that he was standing in front of it, Harry felt scared to touch it.
However, Harry, Neville, Teddy and Ron had more to study than only the Potions book and wandless magic. Hermione had passed all her OWLs with the highest grades possible, but the four of them had to take the re-sit of the exam in the beginning of their next year. The young woman did her best to help them, but neither Neville nor Teddy could remain at the Burrow for longer stretches of time since the Weasley economy didn’t allow it. Thus, her students primarily consisted of Harry and Ron. One of whom Hermione appeared to be struggling to be around, but not in a wholly negative manner.
The fact that he had been one of the tormentors of the elf was hurting Draco, and he was aware of it to an almost painful degree. In some ways, the situation at hand reminded the former Pureblood fanatic about how completely foolish he had acted around Hermione when he had first met her. The hurt which had been aimed towards Dobby out of ignorance and entitlement might be more painful for Draco, as it had taken him far longer to realise that the elf was a person.
“I cannot say I envy you, living with that.” Narcissa’s tired voice met Remus on the other end of the line. “He is a lot like I remember him, but perhaps even more obnoxious.”
“I think that I would probably be a small dog. I don’t feel very big, especially not around my friends or dad and Professor Snape.” Harry concluded.
Draco reached the wall and led him through it. Looking back, Harry could see that only a small part of the wall was actually an opening, rather than the entire thing. It meant that even if he had touched the wall on his own, he might not have figured that it was the correct, open one, based on being unable to locate the place where the old brickwork actually parted.
With shaking hands and tears forming in his eyes, Albus reached around Harry’s neck and placed the necklace there. “You’re wearing my most prized possession,” he whispered as he slowly separated himself from the chain. “I want you to know that it means more to me than most things in this world.”
“If your body hadn’t been defective, we would have had a child by now!” The response had nothing to do with the current situation at hand, and was hardly a response to what had been stated.
Professor Slughorn nodded, concluding that Pat hadn’t wanted anything either since she didn’t speak up about it. “It is my belief that an outside source may be just as useful as the one who experienced the hurt, as long as the affected does not mind being spoken up for. Seeing as she is currently this shaken, forcing information out of her simply wouldn't be fair.” The man shook his head as he focused on Ngo-Kwang once more. “Go ahead dear, tell me what I may help you with.”
Al, not being particularly fluent in these matters overall, carefully shook his head. The two of them were using the Headmaster’s desk as their breakfast table, seated on opposite sides for convenience. Harry hadn’t touched his food, but Al had finished most of his.
“That trial ended with Greyback being released for the moment, but he would be called back in the near future to be tried as a werewolf. The boy must have been impossibly desperate, as he surely realised that my father would not rest until he was locked away forever. Yet Greyback didn’t try to run, like most people would have done. Perhaps he knew that he could never escape the Ministry of Magic. He didn't have the resources most other people did, after all, and could probably be tracked down fairly easily.”
“If you have time to worry about me, then your brain really has become Bertie Botts Bean-Jam.” George remembered laughing, but he didn’t feel like what he had said had really been funny.
“Pettigrew, I expect my sheets to be changed before I return. When you are done, keep guard from the cottage by the entrance to the estate. I do not want anyone to enter, remain a rat so as to remain inconspicuous.”
“Huh?” George found himself blinking at the question before he shrugged and then licked his lips while avoiding the gaze of his twin. “Nothing, I was just thinking.”
“I loved you!” Pat objected in return, staring down at her former friend as tears threatened to push out of her eyes. “I loved you as my best friend, but that didn’t mean squat to you as you suddenly refused to talk to me. I was left all alone in a new school and nobody wanted to be my friend until Vince picked me up as a charity project. I hadn’t done anything wrong at the time, I simply chose the House which the hat suggested to me, and that somehow sealed my fate as evil? Get over yourself! Why do you have to sort people into being good and bad?”
“I might,” Bill answered after licking his lips. He was silent for a few seconds before he continued to speak, “do the Malfoys have a horse inside the manor?”
Draco stared into his teacup, his crooked reflection looking back out at nothing as the two proceeded to have a silent stare down. Harry was laying on his legs, looking up at his boyfriend as he waited for him to respond, the two of them struggling to be anywhere within the same space and not touching. Yet here, in their own world, that wasn’t a problem.
You dingus!” Teddy laughed as he lightly tapped Ron’s head with his fist before more or less flopping over him in a hug. “You scared us half to death,” the following words were mumbled into his shoulder as Teddy clung to him.
However, not everything was miserable, as Sirius' life improved significantly after he was pseudo adopted by the Potters. It was not hard to understand why Sirius preferred to be called Potter over Black, as everything positive in his life seemed to have come from the Potter family and especially his relationship to James. Not to mention that the name saved him from everything which he had hated about being a Black and a Pureblood. Harry had somehow expected the story to be a lot more complicated than Sirius fighting with his family to a point of leaving once and for all and being welcomed into a new one where he felt at home and safe, but it seemed that really was the extent of it.
Besides, the Ministry of Magic wasn't a dangerous place of its own, neither was it the enemy, it was simply Umbridge who was that unreasonable, making herself one. The possibility that Remus might be dying was far enough. If they chose to not act, and didn't act fast enough, Harry might forever lose his dad.
“There is no need for name calling,” Harry gently scolded her. “And I’m already bringing Colin, so I can’t help you, I’m afraid.”
London hosted the only bookstores which were prepared for the Hogwarts students and therefore had a large enough stock to allow said students to all buy their course literature around the same time. There were other magical book stores closer to Hogwarts, but they couldn’t reasonably be asked to bring in a large collection of specific books without any prior notice. Thus, no new books were allowed the teacher, unless they could provide for that cost themselves.
“That doesn’t make financial sense, Ronald.” Draco calmly addressed the agitated Prefect. “She could possibly get away with such a thing once or maybe even twice, but it is not easy finding unemployed teachers to simply insert into a teaching situation without any form of preparation. The cost of losing up towards three teachers would be highly significant, especially for Hogwarts whose finances are not the most extensive.” Draco likely knew some of the Hogwarts finances based on being the son of a member of the Hogwarts Board of Governors.
“I wouldn’t call that humorous, but I do feel rather satisfied about the result,” Remus grinned as he nuzzled his nose against the other’s hair, breathing in the scent which he loved so utterly yet which was becoming distant alongside his lover’s work.
Harry tried to call out to him, he tried to reach towards his dad yet his body would not move. His mind was reeling from the terrifying realisation that his beloved dad lay before him, bleeding, perhaps even dying, and Harry could not move.
The person practically snorted, “why yes. It is a part of the cruel conditions of being biologically human.” The snort and statement were followed by some deep breaths which were likely taken in an attempt to ease their physical suffering.
“Oh, Ron told me when I expressed trouble with telling you apart. He said that he and Ginny have known it for a long time, and that they learned it from your older brother, Percy.” Teddy blabbered on, unknowing about the fact that he was systematically destroying George’s world with his words.
Sirius chuckled. “Nice to see you, cousin. Never thought I’d say that to my own family. But you seem to be busy, I’ll chat with you later.” He waved as he began making his way up the stairs. “You can go anywhere in the house, but my old room is off limits!” He yelled back down.
He was being unfair again. He knew it, yet he couldn’t stop. It wasn’t Molly, it was him, and still he couldn’t bring himself to change.
Hermione felt her face heat with embarrassment as she lightly gave him a push with her hand, prompting him to laugh again. She gave in and chuckled alongside him, the two of them laughing as they tried not to be loud enough for a scolding. When they thought that they had gathered themselves, they looked at each other’s face and began giggling once more.
“Oh… Narcissa is fine, thank you. She is speaking with her cousin now, and I…” Remus trailed off, avoiding the House Elf’s gaze. He felt his energy leave him, as if it had been blown out like a candle. “I am worried that she will never want to speak to me again.” He finished with a deep sigh. “Would you like a cup of tea too? There is enough in the pot.”
“Sir, might I suggest you refer to Professor Trelawney by the term ‘partner’ rather than ‘mate?’” Draco suggested. “The latter term signifies a relationship with children to a much larger degree than the former. Seeing as Professor Trelawney desires a relationship without that degree of physical intimacy, then I would think that referring to her by a more neutral and less... child making centered term, would be to prefer to her.”
His pale skin appeared as white as marble, with the exception of an almost abnormal redness around his eyes and by the corners of his mouth. Even from afar, Harry could tell that his eyes were watery, as if he hadn’t slept enough for weeks. His hair even appeared slightly dirty, which was the first time that Harry had ever seen it even remotely unclean. Even the scar across his face appeared to be redder than it had been before the winter break, as if even it wanted to announce to the world that Draco was not fine.
“He was my mother’s best friend and I would have wanted to know him, I would have wanted to know more about her, I wish he could have told me-...”
“What would you have done if it hadn’t worked out?” Molly continued to question, carefully moving closer to Andromeda with slight desperation within her big, hazel colored, doe-like eyes.
She jumped as she was addressed and made an attempt to hide her plate of food behind herself, as if she was guilty of something for being the only one to eat. Not that she was really the only one eating, she just was the only one with a plate for the moment.
“I’ve done nothing but talk all day…” Pat groaned and hid her face in her hands, shaking her head. She hated that she was trembling for far more reasons than simply working out too hard. Most of it was emotional. “I’m tired. I’ll just shower and take a nap. That should do it.”
“Hiya, Nessie.” Sirius said, interrupting the woman as he let himself sit back down upon his armchair. “Yes, it is me. What? No, I haven’t taken Remus hostage. Me and what wand?” He laughed. “No, I do have a wand, just not an adult one. Fine, I will prove it, ask me something only I would know.” Sirius clicked his tongue and leaned back in the armchair, signalling to Remus that he was doing fine.
“I’m sorry… I don’t know what happened… We weren’t supposed to kill anyone, I don’t… I don’t understand…” Rabastan continued to mumble as he watched the werewolf and the young man grieve over the loss of their friend.
Yet there was something else which was becoming unmistakably painfully clear to him as he spoke about his dogson.
The British Ministry of Magic has come under criticism for the manner in which it has allowed our children to remain unsafe at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the many years that Mr. Albus Dumbledore reigned as Headmaster. Throughout the past year and since the unfortunate demise of young Cedric Diggory, the attention of the Ministry has primarily been on the school in question. Yet it appears that in its hurry to secure one area, the Ministry of Magic has failed its duty towards the British mage community in other areas.
Ngo-Kwang continued to prod, “are you with him because you’re afraid of what would happen if you separated from him?”
Sirius had never really been told these things, as he had been rather a mess when first coming to the Potter household, and he had never quite asked for these details. Family matters had scared him back then, and he rather hadn't wanted to ask questions. Questions had seemed like they would ruin the good things which he was experiencing. Yet that was the past, right now Sirius wanted nothing more than hearing his dad's experiences.
A memory rather suddenly hit Harry, as he recalled how Albus had told him years ago that his past lover and friend was in prison.
Harry waited in the main room as the other man walked into his bedroom. He would likely normally have taken care to close the door to avoid the sunlight from the window reaching those sensitive jars in his office, but the cold December Sunday evening made such actions superfluous. Thus, Harry could see into the minimalist, sparsely decorated room. Yet he noticed that a shirt was hung from the beams in the ceiling. He would have recognised the craftsmanship anywhere. From a crooked little hanger hung a black knitted shirt, complete with wide sleeves and snatched wrists. Over the left side where the wearer’s heart was located was a small S, decorated into the shirt with silver thread.
Around my neck hangs a piece of El, as well as my childhood. The shrunken bottle is hidden, and I know that I can never let anyone know what is inside it. My heart must be kept away from them.
“Is… everything alright?” Colin’s kind voice spoke up as he lightly pushed a foot against Harry’s leg in an attempt to make him less unfocused. As he had concluded that his friend might have received a sensory overload, Colin was careful to not be too rough or too close as he gave him a gentle nudge.
Neville carefully asked why Harry had begun talking to him back in their first year of Hogwarts in the first place. Harry thought about it before he stated that it had been the right thing to do and that he didn’t regret it, seeing as Neville was a great friend. The answer appeared to be exactly what Neville had hoped to hear, and he smiled happily at the thought.
“While it pains me to say, few things have proven as certain and as recurring as the fact that you have not been as safe as you should be at Hogwarts, Harry.” The old wizard sighed as he spoke, that almost ancient sadness appearing upon his face yet again, causing the lines of wrinkles to appear deeper and less friendlier. “As the situation currently is, you might not be safe in your dormitory. You might not be safe in any dormitory.”
The woman’s eye twitched as Potter mentioned ‘werewolf’ and ‘godfather’ in the same sentence. It twitched once more upon the man continuing to speak, and by the time Harry Potter pulled the letter out of his pocket, much to both Malfoys surprise, her mouth had become a thin, displeased streak. Draco was more than a little scared to have the half-blood had mention the Tonks family, but his mother kept her response back.
The next day, Harry found Sirius in a room where he had not expected to find him. It was one of the rooms which Harry couldn’t quite figure out the function of. The room was sort of a trophy room, displaying items and things which the Black family had gathered over the years. Everything from jewellery to decorated cups lined the glass cabinets along the walls, with the exception of one wall, which was covered in a detailed tapestry depicting the Black family tree. On the other end of the room, but not against the wall, stood two armchairs with a little table between them, both of which faced the tapestry, giving the impression that one was supposed to admire it from the comfort of an armchair.
Maybe one day, Colin would be in a position where he could date Harry, but for now, Malfoy was evidently what the green eyed teenager actually needed. Or at least so the situation appeared from Colin’s perspective.
“Are you sure there was such a ring used in the resurrection ritual?” The mind reader spoke up before Harry had the chance to vocalise his thoughts on his own.
“Nothing brings me more joy!” Worple laughed as he shook Harry’s hand, his cheeks heating slightly with delight even though his layers of white powdered makeup. “Are you interested in vampires, son?”
magazine. Time passed, and it became late enough that they needed to retreat to their common rooms in smaller groups so as to not be noticed by the Disciplinary Committee.
“Then you should go eat, at least in your room. Ask one of your elven friends to bring you something.” Severus continued to speak in a silent, reasonable tone of voice where he stood in the space which had been filled utterly by Crabbe just a few hours ago.
“I’m afraid I don’t understand what you mean by that question.” Harry answered truthfully with a polite smile.
“In the 1920’, a political extremist by the name of Gellert Grindelwald gained support all across America as he began a campaign to unite all mages as the rulers of all Muggles as well as the country itself. During the assimilation period, many embassies decided to produce a record of laws which were supposed to apply to all mages, but of course didn’t quite do that in practice. One of the more discussed laws in this record was the one which stated that mages were not legally allowed to marry Muggles, as that was considered a risk against the community as a whole. Remember, it was already a very weak community, despite what they wanted to think of themselves, and exposure of mages to Muggles was considered to be a highly dangerous venture. Many found themselves enraged by the idea that they were not the elites of society, as they had promised themselves that they would be. Thus when Grindelwald offered them a political movement which would give them the control they desired, and the freedom from the threat of the Muggles, many chose to follow him.” He paused once more, allowing the two teenagers to consider his words and ponder if they had any questions.
“Oh. Yes. Of course.” Ron joined in with the chuckling before he reached out to grab some food for his plate.
“Who the culprits are,” Harry corrected him, hiding his grin behind his hand. This prank seemed beyond harmless, as the wyvern skull was by no means damaged by the decorations.
He trailed off and then continued. “Tom had graduated at that point and was of course not a suspect, but he knew Hogwarts very well. Perhaps better than anyone else. He could have found ways back inside, just like how Mr. Potter did it three years ago. Tom is also an animagus, you see. One with a far more versatile shape for stealth. If nothing else, Tom had followers at that point, and could have asked them for the favor. Nonetheless, his goal was likely to prompt the goblet to be locked up in the Black family vault, where it would be even more secure than here at Hogwarts.”
“So this is where you’ve been…” Draco looked around in the small room, passively interested in what he was seeing. His trembling legs gave him away as tired however, and thus Harry insisted upon him sitting down on the bed, rather than remain standing in an effort to appear dignified. “It’s funny, I can see quite the number of traces of other people here, yet it is recognisably yours.” Draco laughed weakly as he studied the desk in front of him.
For a few moments after Draco begged him for his help, in a state which he could only imagine was what Draco had felt like on the inside for a long time, without showing it to the world, Harry just stared past them, out in the corridor. At last, he glanced at Draco; his eyes were probably reflecting exhaust more than anything, he couldn’t even find the energy to care for the other’s struggles visibly. Instead, there was some sort of gleam in the eyes that was probably very hard to define, one of curiosity and interest.
“I’m skipping it,” Harry explained, “I’m trying to cut down in dairy products, it makes my stomach feel calmer.”
It proved to be very hard for Harry to figure out how to use his internal magic in the way which Sirius asked of him, or rather, which the animagus spell demanded of him. He had to try for days, with rest in between, before he could finally feel that uncomfortable, warm heat all over himself, from the top of his head to the end of his toes. It was terribly uncomfortable, and it took a lot of will to continue once the sensation was that present.
“I was helping mother clean out some of her jewellery, and we found this rather old thing, which made me think of you.” Draco sat back down upon the bed, having collected a small jewellery box from his bag. “ I know you generally do not wear a lot of these, but I thought you might appreciate this one.”
Then there was Blaise, who had long since been a good friend, and then later a nice acquaintance. However he was also somebody who prioritised his own safety above all else, and Harry couldn’t imagine him risking his neck for Draco. It shouldn’t even be asked of him, and Harry wasn’t asking it either. Yet the thoughts led Harry’s mind to be stuck with irrational fears of how bad Crabbe would actually be. He wondered if Blaise could actually handle it if things came to one of those scenarios Harry’s stressed and slightly paranoid mind was painting up.
Colin nodded, utterly dazzled by everything which was Harry. He would rather fight Umbridge in hand to hand combat than reveal anything which Harry had told him not to disclose.
“Hagrid will be here soon.” Harry felt a tingle of worry that the centaur might not wake up again if he allowed him to fall asleep. Thus, he hurried over and grabbed the creature’s hand, trying to not breathe through his nose so as to not be overwhelmed by the unfamiliar scents.
“It’s not about the Chamber,” I lie. I think he can tell. “I’ve been worried about your health recently. You appear to have something on your mind that you haven’t actually spoken to me about.” I tell him in the voice of a parent, rather than a teacher.
Ron snorted before his cheeks turned red, “sorry, sorry. Dirty mind, bad mind. There has to be a better way of saying that.”
Molly recognised her own husband in the description of Lucius Malfoy. Although the two men were nothing alike in terms of their personalities, she could not deny that there were similarities. The two men would likely have found the comparison to be highly offensive and inaccurate, yet within her thoughts, Molly was allowed to draw whatever conclusions she wanted, and nobody would ever know.
Nobody came to save him this time. He was alone with his panic, useless to the cause he had been picked for. He was an adult and he was acting the same as his childhood self. He was an adult and he was endlessly thankful that the Lycan was not tearing into him once more.
“Are you going outside, Hermione?” Harry turned to his fellow book enthusiast, noticing that she was already dressed for the winter when he had already spoken the question.
Harry automatically stretched up as he was addressed, trying to improve his somewhat deficient posture. “If I can help, Professor?” He responded in what he hoped as an attentive and not frightened tone of voice.
“Oh?” He settled on one idea, allowing himself the pleasure of following up on something slightly reckless. He might only have a few days left of freedom; the idea of stopping himself did not occur to the man who was awaiting his own prosecution. “Haven’t had enough yet then? I wonder how much would be enough for you…”
“Aw, oh well, go chat with them, Ted.” She slapped her partner’s butt lightly before she followed Narcissa towards the center of the room.
Harry could not help but look shocked before he quickly shook his head. “By Merlin, of course not! I’m not doing that to any of my scars, but that doesn’t mean that you have to do the same-...”
“Two and a half.” The Headmaster sighed deeply once more. “While I am not directly opposed to their opinions, it is a fact that the Hogwarts budget does not directly allow for the replacement of a collection of teachers over a short period of time. But I won’t bore you with such things. I actually wanted to speak to you, Mr. Lupin, your timing is most excellent.”
Ron and Teddy were equally excited as the rest of them that the first, and previously almost impossible, first step in their plan had been completed. The two best friends were in no way jealous of their membership, seeing as neither of them thought Professor Slughorn's dinner sounded entertaining in the least.
“I already asked her about the tea, but I will tell her about your book.” Remus nodded to himself, making a mental note about it. “Oh, I saw that you cleaned out the servant’s room, is there anything you need for that?”
“Did you have a fight about something?” Harry carefully asked, leaning his head to the side so that his dark locks fell over his face and he had to correct them, leading to Colin seeing some of his right earlobe.
Mrs. Malfoy blinked with surprise as she was assaulted with a rather private question. She thought for a second, then nodded with a small, honest smile. “There are times when I am not comfortable with his decisions, choices or choice of words. There are times when I feel like he has failed me, and equal times when I believe myself to have failed him. Nonetheless, he is mine, as I am his. Despite whatever surface emotions I feel, my love for my Lucius motivates me. If there is a point where my love for him is no longer there, I have yet to reach it.”
“I would like to thank you all,” Dumbledore continued. “I would want to do it personally, and shake all your hands, but time is short, and mine is even shorter. For you see, the date of my death has been set. I am to die on the 5th of June, and so I wanted to thank you all, and welcome you to my funeral.” He finished his lecture with a bow, as if he had not just announced his own funeral.
Pat stopped and knelt down on the path, holding her stomach as she felt like throwing up from the aftereffect of the question. In her head, she felt like she was overreacting, but her body was having a reaction which she couldn’t stop. One which made her unable to walk at that moment.
“I… think that believing your theory would make me too sentimental of the fact that Tom might not have intended on killing anyone…” Albus hugged his phoenix once more, taking a shaking breath. “It is far less painful to believe that it was intended, rather than an accident.”
Around them, the battle continued with renewed power, as the Order of the Phoenix clashed with the Death Eaters with newfound violence which had not been there before they realised that the Death Eaters could and were trying to kill them. The Death Eaters, who had until then not used magic aimed to kill, became desperate in return, fighting no longer for the sake of not being captured, but with the intention to break out of their locked position by any means possible. They were still following Rodolphus’ orders, but the Order did not know that.
“You may explore at your leisure, please do not touch the artworks or objects displayed, most of them are rather fragile. The wyvern head is rather sturdy, but be careful with it still, please.” Draco smiled politely as George, taking care not to express worry or distrust in him.
“He doesn’t have to know, Hermione,” Harry gently informed her. “There is nothing that demands that you have to confess your feelings to Ron simply because he is someone you like.”
In the silence which followed, Peter hesitated to speak up. At long last, he surrendered to his need to talk. “I was in love once. For a very long time. With a rather bad person. He died recently, and I’m feeling rather lost when I think of the fact that we won’t ever talk again. That I can’t ever have his forgiveness for what I’ve done. I really didn’t know what to do, and I was hounded by a Lycan at Malfoy Manor.”
Percy slowly turned back towards the sleeping form of the Death Eater. Nobody had ever bothered to tell him the full story of Bartemius Crouch Senior and Bartemius Crouch Junior. There had not been an official trial, but Albus Dumbledore had left an official statement in regards to what both Crouches had said before they were kissed. Had Percy had the courage to read it, or even skim through it, he would have known about Bartemius Crouch Junior’s past and the ways in which his father had abused him. Yet as it currently was, Percy was sitting facing a sleeping man, wondering how cruel another mage had to be to force another into such a state of living.
Sirius and George were winning, allowing Sirius to slowly advance on the stone stage while George remained somewhat behind him, and the two husbands were forced to retreat backwards. Sirius managed to gain enough ground so as to make it almost across the entire stage. He felt like the most powerful wielder of magic in the world where he stood next to the unknown, mystical vortex, surrounded by the sound and struggle of battle as his blood rushed in his body and his heart pumped in his chest.
Sirius finally had to stop in his tracks as he deflected the magic with somewhat less ease. “That’s more like it! Let’s dance, Raspberry!” Sirius laughed as he advanced once more, deciding to duel Rabastan for real, rather than toy with him.
This chapter contains a panic attack taking the form of hostility and aggression. Nobody will be physically hurt through it however.
“We are not in class, I could be more annoyed with you.” The man nodded to Harry, his expression showing no hints of displeasure, although he appeared slightly unfocused. “You do have an aunt, she is a Muggle. I believe I might still have her address somewhere, if you would ever want to contact her.”
“I do have one, yes,” Tom smiles at me as he sits down upon the sofa and produces a black notebook from within his bag. He always carries that bag with him, even on days when he is not attending school.
The unwilling Death Eater followed Harry’s gaze before he smiled weakly and shrugged. “It wasn’t very comfortable, but at least I got away from Crabbe’s watchful eye.”
“...I will speak to the Headmaster right away,” I breathe deeply once more as I turn towards the door. If Hagrid really is who Tom claims that he is, then he must be stopped without delay. I cannot afford to doubt as I hurry away from the classroom, drawing my wand as I run down the halls of Hogwarts.
Colin’s face lit up with relief and happiness and he nodded quickly. “That would be awesome. Like, all of your friends are kind of hot.” He laughed nervously as his cheeks heated and he looked to the side. “They will all be great models, but not as great as you! I mean, no, I do mean that but it wasn’t what I… Ughn!” Colin gave up and simply groaned before shaking his head at his own words.
Molly handed him a tissue, allowing her husband to feel all the things which he had previously refused himself to feel. It felt oddly good to see the man feel again, rather than be a distant, almost stoic face.
To celebrate Teddy having written five novels in less than a year, I (Nathan) reached out to a silversmith with my design of Severus' necklace, and she has customized one which will arrive soon. She also let the design become a new bracelet in her store, which is available here:
Arthur raised his head from his hands, the shadows which fell upon his face made him appear old. Like a ghost from the past, a boy changed into a man by time and hardship. Molly did not find him unattractive. Arthur was not what she would have imagined herself to want when she was young, but he was not without appeal to the aged witch.
Only, he had lost them. He could hear her voice from somewhere, but he didn’t know what path she was taking to the Headmaster’s office. Everything had gone wrong, and Al didn’t know anything. Seeing as Bellatrix had a hostage, it was not unreasonable to think that she might use him as a shield as she strove to fulfill her Master’s wish. Harry couldn’t save Draco on his own, but with the help of someone more capable, Draco might not be harmed.
“So… You mean to say that you think that magic is in the blood?” Fleur repeated what Draco had told them, frowning slightly as they spoke. “And better blood will give better magic? That is what you are thinking?”
“I’ll stay inside then, it appears rather cold outside.” Harry declined once he had managed to recover from his almost laughing fit.
Luna raised her head as she blinked at Harry, gripping the necklace around her neck tightly. She took a deep breath, then another, followed by one more. “Do you think that… the rest of them will like the me I create?”
They opened their mouth to say something more, yet they were interrupted by the arrival of Sirius, who managed to catch the door before it slammed into the wall.
“Mum was against me going back after that, and even more against Dennis coming here since everything just keeps on happening. For being a school, things sure aren’t actually safe around here a lot, huh?” Colin attempted to make a joke, yet it came off as somewhat more truthful than he had intended for it to.
“I thought… maybe this year wouldn’t be so bad…” Harry slowly mumbled into his hands, keeping his face hidden still while taking care to not accidentally damage his glasses.
“Indeed, sir,” Harry curtsied politely. “I’ve heard plenty about you from the Headmaster and I wanted to be given a chance to meet you for myself. I deeply apologise if my request has inconvenienced you.” Harry mixed his language with what he knew from his many hours of reading classical Muggle Literature, thinking solely about how a Malfoy would engage with a mage such as Slughorn. It truly had been worth getting through
“You’re so sweet but you didn’t have to worry,” Hermione assured him. “I’m never anxious to see you. Are you here as Fleur’s best man?”
Harry slowly nodded as the information settled inside his mind. “So you mean to say she only looks at the information and concludes that Muggle-borns are less capable as mages and doesn’t bring up any other factors?”
Harry could kind of understand it when Sirius put it like that. He nodded once more. “So how do I actually do it?” Harry reached for his wand.
He pulled his sleeve down and walked up to the door. The house itself wasn’t too special, it was an old townhouse. The bricks were old and what color had once been upon the house had long since faded. Bill could count at least three floors, and a ground floor. It probably had a basement too. A short set of stairs lead up to the door, which had been painted red long ago. All in all, it felt very hard to imagine that this house was the Black estate, belonging to the Black family. He was sure it wasn’t a cheap house, but the Malfoys had a giant manor, and the Lestrange mansion, wherever it was in the wilderness of Scotland, could at least somewhat rival it. A three store building in the middle of London wasn’t all that impressive.
“Yep, might take you ten times to just comprehend who and what you are. That’s why one of the most dangerous parts about this spell is that you might just lose yourself to being an animal. However, that is not a problem since I’m here, and I will turn you back again if you get stuck.” Sirius patted his wand, which he had stuck into his back pocket in a way which looked rather ridiculous.
“I’ve been Ron’s friend for years,” Hermione objected. “I’ve lived in his home every summer since I was fourteen, and I’m on very good terms with both his mum and most of his siblings. You aren’t asking me to stay away from a stranger, you’re asking me to stay away from an actual part of my life. I’m not going to move out from the Burrow simply because you are insecure about me being around my friend.”
The Head of the Malfoy House sighed once more, still struggling to gather himself but nonetheless more dignified than he had previously been. “Arthur… I will not be able to return to my family for the foreseeable future.”
“I did not!” Colin objected as he looked down. His shoulders fell. “Oh I did too…” he admitted with a grumpy mutter.
Only then did he notice that he was holding onto Al’s necklace, his knuckles whitening around the small object. Guilt ripped through his being for a moment, until he managed to recall that the necklace had endured a lot of squeezing and panic over the years, and definitely would not break in his grasp. Nonetheless, he finally let go of it, staring down at the evidence of love resting in his palm.
Harry hesitated by the door, but Draco did not. They had permission to enter, and Draco thought himself capable enough of a wizard to be able to handle any magical traps which might have been placed upon the door or in the room. The door swung open without a sound, opening itself up to a dark room. Draco turned on the lights, as however old the house might be, it still had some modern inventions.
The man raised his hand, showing that Harry had no need to apologise any further than he already had. “Professor Umbridge is not a particularly pleasant person to negotiate with. The two of you were faced with an authority figure who would not heed you, even if everything which Draco said is indeed true. That being said, I will answer your earlier question.” He turned towards Draco as he spoke, continuing to speak in a calm but not distant manner.
“Are you sure that Professor Lupin won’t be able to tell that you are there?” Draco tried yet again to reason with Harry, but he was running out of real objections and they were both aware of that fact.
“Far too good,” Arthur nodded as he leaned forward and grabbed her hand, allowing her to move away if she wanted to. “So good that I took you for granted. That I took everything for granted. I told myself that I was working because I wanted to support my family, but… Maybe I was…” Arthur lowered his head, looking to the side with a pained, confused expression.
Harry felt his eyes widen as his mouth dropped open. His mind somehow rejected the name, while also forcing it to bounce around within it. All other thoughts appeared to draw back from the uncomfortable name of the terrorist who started and perpetuated the American Mage War. Harry couldn’t believe that the man who Albus had loved within his memories was an actual terrorist, and enemy of all mage communities. He had read and talked about him in Magic History. He had had quizzes and actual tests mentioning the man. Yet to find that he was somehow far closer to Harry than simply a name in a textbook was beyond baffling.
Al’s brilliantly blue eyes studied Harry with a worried frown. “I fear that you have experienced too much of me, and that you are confused by thoughts and feelings which are not your own. It would not be entirely right for me to put you through even more of that when you are already in an unpleasant state of mind. I worry that my thoughts would be escapism, and I am not certain that I can condone that as of currently.”
“I always found them a little strange and rather clingy, but it could be because they find my pale hair to be irresistible,” Al chuckled softly as he pulled on a strand of long, grey hair.
“You sound clingy when you whine like that.” A voice which was most definitely not Draco’s answered Harry’s whispered, frightened confessions.
“Well…” Teddy dragged the word out as he slowly spoke up after George’s somewhat unprompted rant. “That doesn’t sound very realistic to me. You rather need my help to do the things I do.” He absently wiggled his fingers towards George in an attempt to show that he was better at tinkering, but in George’s mind, Teddy was telling him that George was useless since the incident with his hands.
“Thank you.” Draco called back. “I have someone who wants to meet you, Harry.” He gently moved his boyfriend a step back from himself. “Also, I must remove my suit jacket, it is getting too warm for it.”
Every other empty surface of the room had been plastered with female pin up models and bikini models, as he hadn’t been able to find enough Muggle magazines with men to cover the walls with. He had found some, but not enough. He knew that his mother hated women like the ones in the pictures, and even more so when they didn’t move. Thus, he had worked very hard to make sure that the posters couldn’t be removed by any means. Now, as an adult man who was very honest to himself with the fact that he really wasn’t interested in women, his breast centered collage was more than embarrassing. Especially since he couldn’t get the pictures off the walls either.
“I… Am not sure I…” Remus did not know what he was saying, he was mostly making noises rather than speaking actual words with meaning behind them.
Harry shook his head so that his curls flew around his face, “I think I look good like this, and I like the things I can do with it in terms of different hairstyles.”
“I think Antonin Dolohov was a friend of my old man’s,” Teddy spoke up next. “I can easily imagine him taking Dolohov into protection, but I’m not sure grandma and grandpa would allow that. It still makes me want to report him as a possible hiding place, but the Ministry likely wouldn’t listen to me.”
“Well, you see the thing is t-, wait,” Bill halted himself. “You… agreed with me? I thought that… well…” He stopped again before he smiled once more. “You were supposed to be my test argumentative partner, I won’t get to practice if you simply agree with me.”
“I trust your judgement in that regard, but I must remind you that dormitories aren’t locked. There is nothing stopping anyone within your House from entering it. Further actions taken to protect your dormitory in particular would not be fair to the rest of the students, but more importantly, we do not have the means of producing stronger enchantments for the sake of protecting your room in particular. Thus, any effort we make in terms of magic would likely prompt those who might wish you ill to a challenge.” Albus appeared tired as he spoke, as if he very much wanted the reality of the situation to be different, but could no longer pretend that he wasn’t aware of the actual truth. “In short, no actions I can take might be enough to keep you safe in a dormitory. As you know, one’s House is no measure of loyalty. There is an equal possibility that there will be groups of followers and Dark Lord supporters in any House.”
Harry’s eyes had been filling with tears as he spoke, but it wasn’t until Colin finished speaking that he really began crying. “I’m sorry…” He whimpered again. “I really thought that… I was… I do like you but I c-can’t… I can’t…”
“Although I knew of the mage community of Britain, I was of course never part of or active within it, as I am a… Moogle?”
Thus it was that Colin found Harry on the floor, arms stretched out and legs sprawled behind him, looking terrified and then relieved when he realised just who had knocked on the door.
Which was the reason as to why Ginny had told Ron to leave her be when he did ask about her relationship. In hindsight, she had been far too harsh with her brother, who understandably felt insecure about the fact that a family member was dating a former bully of his. Yet he hadn’t acted very collected in return, and their discussion had resulted in a fight.
Yet to Harry’s great relief, Colin proved himself more than capable once again. He spoke up when Harry couldn’t find the words, and while he was not as good with words as Draco was, the support he was giving Hermione reminded Harry of the way Draco generally acted when somebody needed assistance.
Throughout the journey, Harry struggled to breathe properly as he remained in the corner of the compartment. He couldn’t recall if he had ever ridden the Hogwarts Express without Draco. The memory of his previous partner and best friend was so strong within the familiar place that Harry couldn’t help but imagine him with them, or think that he had simply stepped out to go visit the bathroom. It might be a crude and unfair comparison to contrast himself to Cho Chang, but Harry couldn’t help but think that he understood her struggles better after understanding, or rather, experiencing, the hole a friend left behind upon leaving in a familiar environment. The comparison was unfair seeing as Draco was still alive, while Cedric Diggory hadn’t been so lucky after encountering the Dark Lord.
Draco surrendered as he wrapped an arm around his boyfriend. “You are correct. I shouldn’t have. I just didn’t think as far as that.”
Once he was sure that he could redo it once and then twice, Harry turned to Sirius, who was lazing about in the armchair with a copy of
Sarmad’s expression softened as he reached out and lovingly stroked his partner’s arm. “There is still a place for you among us,” he promised his hamsaram.
“Huh…” Teddy shrugged, “I thought most people would connect a hare to aggression, horniess and being unable to face challenges. Or something like symbolising a will to run away as much as they want to fight.”
“He is the Godfather of my child,” Narcissa spoke back to her sister for the first time since Bella came out of her fireplace and begged for help to hide from the Ministry of Magic. “He was handpicked by my husband, and he has been a good friend to me. I will not bind him by any vow which might place him and my child in equal danger to what they are attempting to accomplish.”
“You really should have known better than to trust Fred,” George giggled into his hand. He had evidently been in on the plan.
“Before I tell you more about the teachers and the changes to Hogwarts this year, allow me to make two quick announcements in regards to school activities. Firstly, I am happy to announce that through a generous donation of Lucius Malfoy of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, Hogwarts will now change from the old Quidditch rules and implement the current form of Quidditch, complete with ten Golden Snitches for the inclusion of the Seeker’s Battle.”
“You are not,” his gentle, warm hands strokes some of my darker blonde locks of hair aside as he looks deep into my eyes, fixating me more thoroughly than I thought possible without magic. “I transferred to Hogwarts because I want an education here with you. I’m starting my fifth year, same as you.”
“Wait, her crazy, jealous Muggle sister who married a five tier pink cake instead of a person?” Sirius reached for another piece of cheese which he ate without looking. This led to him having to spit out some of the cheese, as he had accidentally broken off some wax from the edge.
Augusta Longbottom was an odd presence in Harry's life. She had displayed certain behaviours which made her appear to be prejudiced against werewolves, less talented mages, and various other people. Thus, it was somewhat surprising to watch the woman abandon any such strong opinions against werewolves for the sake of making certain that she and her grandson were safe with good people as the war was becoming a frightening reality. In the end, the woman seemed willing to abandon her ideas and to be proven wrong in terms of werewolves when it really mattered. It was odd, and Harry wasn't exactly comfortable with her presence, yet she never spoke down to him or Remus, so there really wasn't anything to complain about.
Bill’s imagination immediately went to some rather interesting places with that power, and he felt himself turn red. Even if Potter was nothing like the person Bill had a date with that weekend, he was well within Bill’s spectrum of attraction.
Actively choosing to hurt them as a direct response to his own pain. Maybe even to hide it. He was directly trying to hurt and dehumanise her for the crime of existing and wanting to be safe. She had just advised Lavender on what a healthy relationship was. Had this been any other person, she would have advised them to get out of this relationship and stop hurting themselves with lies about ‘things becoming better.’
The man accepted Harry’s words with a nod, as he continued to study his work. Harry found it oddly relaxing to be in the same room as someone who was working despite his presence, and he allowed himself to breathe in the scents of the familiar and unchanged office until the smell of roses had fully left his system.
The two girlfriends’ solution was maddening to the Disciplinary Committee, who was responsible for assuring that people remained eating by their tables. Ginny and Greengrass weren’t breaking any rules, as they were still by their own table, albeit not eating upon them. The solution spread between the Houses, and more and more people began to eat with their friends or partners using the ‘by the table’ method of communication. Of course, it still didn’t solve everyone’s problems, seeing as not all tables were next to one another. The Slytherin students could, for example, speak to the Hufflepuff students, but could not reach the Gryffindor or Ravenclaw tables.
“Not a problem, sir,” Colin grinned at him, finding himself a little too shy to look directly into the older student’s eyes. Colin might have a crush on Harry, but the blonde wizard was highly handsome. Plenty Handsome. Handsome in plural. “How much are you willing to pay me?”
“You’re still a human.” Draco commented, chuckling as Harry’s hair now tickled his sides, through his shirt.
She was upset with him for allowing those feelings for Lucius to turn two entire families against one another, but she blamed Lucius Malfoy equally for perpetuating it. The two men had done something which she couldn’t quite forgive, at least not at this moment.
“Are you sure that those things will suit me? Aren’t they a little too… fancy for me?” Harry could see a lot of expensive looking fabrics, various textures, colors and patterns which appeared more suited to someone like Draco, rather than something Harry would wear on a daily basis.
The group had been lucky in being collected by a servant of the Dark Lord himself who had led them to their Master’s current abode, which was a forgotten mansion out in the countryside, somewhere far from prying eyes. The Aurors had not managed to find it and Rabastan hoped that they never would, as he did not want to lose what had come to feel like his home.
As she busied herself with her future work, the rest of her friends had gathered by the door, waiting for her. Together, they quietly and carefully exited the Room of Requirements and headed downstairs to the Great Hall.
“Oh, that was just my polaroid camera. It was destroyed when I was attacked by Slytherin’s monster, but I really don’t remember much of that.” Colin shrugged. “After I told my mum that my camera saved my life, she allowed me to bring my real camera to Hogwarts.” He laughed and threw the strap of the bag over his shoulder. “So at least that is great.”
Colin and Harry managed to make it outside without anyone’s wrath being turned upon them. Soon afterwards, Hermione and Neville appeared with Teddy, who was wearing Neville’s Gryffindor robe to make him less of a target, the hood pulled down over his ears. Harry thought that he could see traces of tears upon his face, but he wasn’t certain.
Yet the two new teachers could not distract Harry’s mind from his fear of Umbridge and what she might do to him without Albus there to protect his rights as a student and human being. It was not that he was expecting her to curse or hurt him, yet Harry knew through experience that Umbridge was not the type of woman to adhere to someone else’s logic when she could enforce her own.
I ponder the question for almost a minute before I answer. “Yet again an interesting proposal, but I’m not certain that a person could possibly rip their soul apart so many times. Many people become traumatised and triggered without being able to create horcruxes, so to create seven different occasions where that happens would be next to impossible. I am not so sure what would happen if one created seven different horcruxes, but my final conclusion is that it could significantly impact the person’s magical ability if that much of the possible magic essence was divided up in that manner. It could potentially be worth it for someone, but I find it hard to think that it would be ideal. At such a point, we might even be able to discuss if that person is even human anymore, as they have been so separated. However, there is a chance that seven horcruxes could in theory be rather magical indeed. Not a large one, but one nonetheless.”
“Not exactly, you can learn to mimic the abilities which a mind reader naturally possesses. Which most people would consider close enough. Unlike a real mind reader, the effects can be much more easily blocked with magic and wards. Ever since people with the gift were discovered, I assume you could both imagine how other mages would seek to replicate said ability with other magic. However, I should not lead us astray again, let me continue speaking.” The old wizard stopped to think once more, then nodded to himself. “I personally believe that there might be some of the Dark Lord’s magic residing within your wound still, which rather became part of you. The wand you possess, being a Parselmouth, sharing the same House as him… Why, you even remind of him when he was your age.”
Albus gestured towards the chalice. “Lean forward and breathe in deeply. The memories will find your mind and inhabit it temporarily. Simply try to allow yourself to be lost within them. You will not be stuck there, I assure you.”
It would be easy to think that such efforts which the Minister was taking would be effective in causing the Death Eaters to surrender their ideology in the face of fear of punishment, but that was not quite how human beings functioned. In short, the more people were told to not do or be something, the more they would strive for their right to be or do that very thing. What previously caused Muggle-borns and Half-bloods to come together against an oppressive ideological majority currently caused those who believed in that ideology to come together and unite under the claim that they were in the right, because just like before the world wouldn't allow them to exist in the first place. No matter the people, they all considered themselves human and wanted the right to exist.
A voice interrupts my reading. I should normally be somewhat upset to be bothered with a book in my hands, but as I do not like the book in question, I look up with more eagerness than I think I ever had to part from a literary adventure.
The door shut behind Remus as he wandered down the stairs and over to the back door, which in turn led to a rather desolate garden. A few dried leaves crumbled around a set of plastic furniture. Remus received the impression that the faded white fence was the only thing which kept the furniture from leaving alongside stronger wind and becoming one with the woods, free to terrorise the landscape and the local farms.
Sirius bit his lower lip as he understood all too well what had happened in the case of the disappearing mages. He had never known that Benny had been left by Euphemia, yet he knew that both he and James had actively avoided contacting the man motivated by the desire to keep him safe from the Death Eaters who would seek to harm him. Euphemia Potter had evidently assured that everyone around her had forgotten about her, yet she had evidently not been able to erase her beloved husband’s mind. Her kindness might have been far crueler than to simply allow him to forget, as she evidently left nothing, not even a letter, explaining herself. Sirius did understand however, because of the Order of the Phoenix and how close he and James had been with the people who visibly rose up against Lord Voldemort. Benny had been in a lot more danger than other Muggles knowing of magic, as the Death Eaters had actively hunted the people of the Order to quench the flame of rebellion against their ideals.
“He was a blood traitor and deserved to die twice over! I didn’t know what was chasing me, I thought it was an Auror!” The woman yelled back.
“Do you think that I could possibly help? Or rather, Harry Potter?” The name was alien on his tongue. Clumsy, wrong and almost poisonous. It was the name of a stranger, the name of someone who was not him. Harry didn’t like the name being aimed at him, but he liked it even less when spoken by his own mouth. “You said that, paraphrased, he would do anything to help a talented, or at the very least famous, student?”
Dean’s problem was that he expected to be the enemy, and he had therefore been very awkward around Ron, who was his classmate. Ginny was well aware of the fact that Dean had once been Ron’s friend, and a really bad one to that, but one which had stopped with that behavior. She ideally wanted to ask Dean to apologise to Ron, but she was worried that doing that would make it appear as if she had only gotten together with Dean for the sake of lecturing him about his past. Dean had changed, he only needed to gather the courage to show Ron that he had.
After the more important people’ reports, the other members of the Order relayed their information and how their respective tasks had unfolded. Some had good things to report, others bad, but most reports were rather neutral in terms of being good or bad.
So much enjoyment, happiness and joy fitted onto one small face, one small body. From the moment he stepped off the Hogwarts Express to the moment when he looked up at the castle for the first time, Tom beamed. I feel like I made the right choice as I look at him. I know it. Tom needs Hogwarts, perhaps more than he needs me.
The way Tom says ‘my Hogwarts’ makes me slightly alarmed. He truly means it. He does not think that he owns the castle, but he evidently loves it to the point of considering it his own in some manners. I cannot help but worry what his reaction will be after he graduates and can no longer stay with me within the Transfiguration office.
However, Harry was distracted by the photograph which he was holding in his hands. He saw his mum on it, recognisable by the red hair which she had gathered into a high ponytail. She had a pleasant smile and green eyes. Harry could see her wave at him, but he was not immediately drawn to look at the young woman, as he had spotted something far more interesting in the picture.
Pat didn’t like the way Vince grabbed Draco, even at the best of days. Yet she felt almost frightened when he would allow his skin to touch Draco’s. Such as brushing his finger against his neck, or sliding his fingertips under his sleeves, touching Draco’s wrists or even forearm without consent. It was so horrifyingly manipulative in such a harmless manner that it terrified Pat how such an inherently gentle gesture could cause so much distress in Draco’s eyes.
The two of them stared at one another for what felt like a long time to Pat, before they both began to giggle and chuckle respectively. It was as if someone commanded them to, as they both began laughing without really telegraphing that they were about to.
Arthur took a breath before he continued, “I could pretend that I’m doing this for the good of everything, and that might be true, but… I really am doing it for him. I have to, or I will never sleep peacefully ever again. I must save Lucius from Azkaban. The right way. He has committed crimes, and he has to serve, but he can’t be left there forever. He simply can’t. Can you please forgive me, Molly? I have to do this.” Arthur repeated one last time, finally daring to look at her as he awaited an answer.
The two of them were standing in an alley, close to a highly picturesque village which appeared to be located in the countryside. The houses were small and low, with white fences and beautiful, colorful gardens. Ivy grew over the buildings, the streets were mostly clean and whole, and cobblestones lined the walkways. A gentle breeze blew over the mostly empty streets as the clouds above appeared heavy. The rain felt present, even though it was evidently not falling yet. Nonetheless, Harry could imagine the cold of the water upon his skin with ease as he glanced around in the surprisingly cold alley.
This department has been built around the vortex itself, as it's not something which could be moved to begin with.
The white, almost sterile, highly acoustic room with the high ceiling likely appeared somewhat less unsettling during summer and the day, yet when it was lit up by rows upon rows of floating candles, the chapel became creepy, rather than just unsettling.
“If you don’t mind, we will tell you on the way there?” Harry politely asked, looking at him with what Colin identified as hopeful eyes.
“Should I come sit with you?” He was not entirely excited about sitting on the floor since it would be slightly cold, but his comfort wasn’t a priority at that moment.
“That would be your previous student, Professor Severus Snape.” Albus spoke calmly and with a patient smile on his lips.
Teddy and Ron had figured out a sort of distance communication, which mainly consisted of flailing in the other’s direction and hoping that the other got what they meant. It was rather humorous to look at, as the two struggled to communicate by means of mad flailing. Thus far, they had figured out the sign for: ‘hi’ which was simply waving, ‘you look good today’ which was a sort of finger gun gesture, and ‘v’ which maybe stood for welcome and was communicated by shaping one’s arms into a big v. Unlike the two girlfriends, Teddy and Ron’s method of communication remained theirs alone.
“I should have come with you,” I whisper in return, holding him tighter than I’ve ever dared holding my son. “I should have come sooner, I should have burnt with you, my love.”
The conversation was derailed to speak about the Malfoy family and the current various people who were gathering together from all manner of lives and sections in society. That together with uncomfortable facts about his past such as facing the fact that his brother had not been as evil as he had always thought, or having had to come to terms with facing the boy who he had bullied so harshly in their teenage, now that Sirius and Snape were both adults. Sirius concluded to speak about his extended family rather than Harry, as he was far more comfortable speaking about them compared to the somewhat private Harry.
Remus’ hand found the way to Severus’, and he squeezed it tightly, knowing that he would have to let go in a far too short amount of time. He attempted to focus on the black eyes of the man who would be his husband. “I… I am… You are right. You’re always right. I love you so much…” He added in a quiet whimper.
“Thank you very much for your help.” Harry turned towards him after he had finished lifting his bag up on the luggage shelf.
Harry and Draco somewhat fell through the door without actually falling, not having intended to find themselves in the middle of an official meeting. Once they realised that they had very clearly interrupted something, the two teenagers remained by the door, unsure of what to do.
No matter how much Lucius Malfoy had improved over the past two years, no matter his statements and will to prove himself different, all of that had been under the circumstances that the Dark Lord would never return. Now that Lord Voldemort had returned, everything had shifted to a new scenario where it was hard for Draco to be able to tell whether his father had left to protect his family, or if he had embraced the chance to have his ideals and values once again enforced upon the mage community.
“I don’t think that is any of your business, Mrs. Umbridge.” Once again, Harry ended up being somewhat more blunt than he would normally be.
“Unlike Trelawney,” Neville said, “you can kind of feel that he knows things. With her, it was always guesses, or straight up lies, while he has a sort of calm acceptance about him. He’s a little odd, and kind of big, but also kind of easy to like.”
He and Colin sat down while Draco finished snuggling with Fang and stood up to take his jacket off as well. Draco joined them by the table as he corrected both his hair and clothes while smiling happily. Colin appeared a little confused by the fact that Draco Malfoy was cuddling with a monster of drool and wrinkles and appeared happy about it, yet he didn’t comment on it.
“Speak to me!” Lavender Brown pleaded as she held onto Ron’s pale yet still Quidditch equipped hand. “Tell me what you need,” she whispered as her eyes yet again filled with tears.
He stood back up properly and looked at the mother and son for a moment. “Snape was a friend of your family, and all; what was he like-... I mean, I know he didn’t share the views of purebloods, and I-... there’s no real nice way of saying it, sorry. I’m just wondering what he was like, is all. I mean, to people he wasn’t consciously trying to demonize himself in front of.” That hadn’t been his smoothest exchange as of lately, but in between exhausting Court trials and his work, he thought he could cut himself some slack in political correctness, or at least so he hoped. Besides, there wasn’t really anything he could say without bringing attention to the fact that Severus Snape had been faking so very much of who he supposedly was.
Harry felt the words like they were a snake, wrapping around him and squeezing him tightly, hugging him in all the right places before teasing his ears with its tongue. He shuddered before leaning in all the way to nuzzle his nose against his boyfriend’s.
“This means the world to him and you know it,” George scolded his nervous older brother. “It will be fine.”
Bill gave him an excusing smile. “Yeah, that too. I’m actually going on a date with someone this weekend, and I don’t want to engage in anything else before I know where I am with them. I’m not going to claim that the offer isn’t flattering, or tempting, but I’ll have to decline for now.”
The constant which crumbled at those words was so large that George fell physically ill, like something had been taken from him which was the size of his lungs. He struggled to breathe properly as he simply stared at the other teenager, pleading for an explanation with his eyes.
“Professor…” Remus’ voice had turned into a soft growl as he spoke up, reminding the old wizard that he was making some rather outrageous claims about the child whose biological parents had been killed by that very same Dark Lord.
“It’s alright,” I let his face go and slowly signal to him that I want to sit up. He rolls off me with a small, disappointed noise.
“Please, I overcame that when I was twelve,” Draco laughed weakly and shook his head. “You’ve improved my mental health quite some this year through the knowledge that you’ve kept Harry company when he needed it. Not that he is a puppy who demands constant company or anything, but it was very emotionally calming to know that he had someone as reliable as you to keep him company.”
“Oh you can’t be…” The woman who sounded nothing like Draco spoke like him and moved just like Harry’s boyfriend. She touched her forehead and groaned weakly, staring towards the door with disapproval coming off her like a physical radiation of heat.
Harry heard Parkinson grunt next to him and move her chair slightly away from his. Her grunt sounded a lot like ‘are you a werewolf too?’
An annoyed voice huffed from behind them before Harry had the chance to answer. The two of them turned around to find Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil standing there, the former appeared highly displeased and confrontational, but the other young woman simply looked uncomfortable where she hid behind her friend. Harry noticed that Brown had the badge of a Prefect upon her chest, something which he hadn’t noticed she was wearing earlier that year.
Nymphadora Tonks was an impressive woman, the type of person who commanded respect from anyone who understood what was good for them, especially in her role as an Auror. Her hair was short and bright pink, her clothing was generally black, combined with studs, slogans and letters which didn’t mean a lot to Andromeda. She knew her daughter well enough to know that the young woman usually dressed in a far more professional manner around strangers, yet Nyhm was uncomfortable with attending something akin to high society and had therefore dressed like a threat, according to her own words. Through the tight clothes, her muscles were highly visible. From her toned thighs to her protruding biceps and strong neck Nyhm was asserting herself in every way which she could.
“I think it will be.” He happily agreed. He couldn't stop glancing back towards the Hufflepuff table, he clearly wanted to walk over there and join the Herbology club as soon as possible.
“Thank you, I shall.” Albus Dumbledore smiled at them. “Now, may I request that you fulfill my earlier petition to the earliest of your convenience?”
“Ask the man I’ve been tasked to kill if I should kill him or not…?” Draco scoffed and shook his head. “That will never work…”
“Harry?” said the slightly red face in the door opening. His eyes were upon Harry’s forehead, staring without shame or restraint. “Would that be, Harry Potter by any sense?”
Harry found himself equally lost for a second, but his mind surprised him by telling him that he knew exactly what to do. The situation was far too complex, far too large for two barely men to handle, and thus, the answer was as simple as asking for help from someone who could help, who could decide what to do. In their second year, they faced a situation during which they closed themselves away from help, and refused to take the hands which had always been there, waiting for them. Harry had learned that silence was not the answer, that suffering alone was never the answer, and if it was, it wasn’t a good answer. One simply needed to look at Al to know the pain of such suffering.
“Indeed, what was I thinking of?” Draco more or less whispered to himself as he met Harry’s gaze and winked at him.
“I should have listened to you,” El whimpers as his wailing dies into sobs. “I should have listened to you and I didn’t.”
“Yes! Well, not in detail, but somewhat. It states that Malfoy Manor is under the influence of Death Eaters, who she cannot risk knowing about her connections to me, or anyone else of us. Draco is safe for the moment, and they are not in immediate danger of being harmed. However, since her husband’s incarceration, she has not been able to refuse hospice to the Death Eaters, and she fears that if anyone were to learn of her crime of keeping them safe from the law, she would be arrested and taken away from her son.” Hermione looked between the adults, forgetting Harry for the moment. “You cannot interfere with her, you’d risk both hers and Draco’s safety.”
“My rat, who was actually an animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew. Sirius, who is also an animagus, but a dog, has been living with Harry and his dad for a while now.” Ron spoke next, earning him a very skeptical look from his best friend.
Ginny was next, the first girl since her son had realised that he had been misgendered at birth. Of course, Molly did not mind, as her child’s happiness was more important to her than the name of great, great grandmother who Molly had never met. A name change was arranged, and Molly had only had sons until the birth of little Ginny. This time around, it did not hurt as much when Arthur did not appear, as she was expecting it. Another oath was made as Molly promised Ginny not only eternal love but also that she would be the last child of the Weasley family to have been birthed by Molly Weasley.
Draco carefully touched the unicorn, and found that the patronus appeared to be solid. “I do think you can ride it if you want to. Would you like me to lift you up?” The flank of the equine reached Draco’s chin, the unicorn was simply massive.
Well outside, they began to walk towards the entrance hall, led by Vince who was oddly, frighteningly quiet.
At that moment, George felt good. He felt happy. He might be scared of the future but Bill considered him his best friend, he could speak with Fred openly and honestly, and next week, he had a job interview with the Potions department at the Ministry of Magic.
“I am… Quite alright… I am-” whatever the other was about to say next was interrupted by their own whimpering as they appeared to curl together further.
In the furthermost corner from the door was the door to the closet. Harry had found an old coat rack, which he had brought into his room and was using as a hanger for clothes which he could still use one more day. In the middle of the room was a round carpet, also in green, with a silver snake upon it. Harry assumed the carpet to have been commissioned by someone who liked the Slytherin Hogwarts House. He would sometimes lay down upon the carpet and pretend to speak to the snake, imagining that it was real. The walls had an elegant tapestry upon them, which had faded over the years but one could still make out a wavy pattern through general brownness which was left.
Thus it came to be that Colin accidentally learned where Harry was staying, but he promised to not reveal the location. Before he left, Colin placed Harry’s hair items upon the desk and noticed a golden snake ring which rested upon it. He recognised it for what it was and handed it to Harry, who began to cry harder as he accepted it into his hands and pressed it to his chest.
Draco was only on the team because he had always been that good at the game and because Pat liked him as a person. If Draco couldn’t deliver, then he was useless. He already needed a cane to walk, so maybe it was simply foolish sentimentality on her part which kept him on the team. The game of tomorrow would prove if Draco was worthy of staying or not. One loss was fine, they could recover from that and they didn’t need their Seeker to win the Seeker’s Game to win the entire game. Pat knew her team was better than needing to rely on one player to bring home the Quidditch Cup.
Sirius clapped his hands, perhaps making a loud noise for no other reason than to fill what he considered to be an empty or oppressive silence. “Great job everyone. You now both have the key to the house of Black.” He grinned as he looked between them. “You guys want to be bandaged up and have some more coffee? I can tell you about the time in Azkaban when a Boggart somehow found its way into the prison. It was the most fun that that place ever saw.”
“We’ll try and make this easy, do not use the killing curse unless absolutely needed. They are children after all. We don’t need them dead, we need nobody to believe in them.” Rodolphus spoke to the mages who gathered around him.
Harry glanced around for a clock of some kind as he realised that they were likely close to curfew. “I’m sorry to cut this short, but I have to get back to the dungeons before it’s too late.” He got to his feet. “Do you mind if I scurry off?”
A noise came from outside the door, but unlike what either of them expected, a sweaty, panting and crying Harry appeared in the doorway. Albus softly cursed death for letting this young teenager see what was about to commence.
The tea tasted somewhat odd but Harry didn’t mind. He added another piece of sugar in lack of other options and then continued to drink, as well as ate some of the biscuits which she had offered him. Harry was not a person who had grown up with the privilege of being able to refuse food based on not finding it inherently tasty. Anything was better than to remain hungry.
“Oh please,” Fletcher growled back. “You’ve hated them for longer, and far more strongly than I have. Besides, Malfoy was arrested and escaped, so there is a crime for you!” Fletcher sneered, proud to have thought of that little fact.
The Lycan howled excitedly and dashed towards Shacklebolt, whom it singled out as the biggest threat at that moment. The wizard swallowed but defended himself, causing the beast to crash into an invisible wall of force.
“You know I worry when my children drink…” Molly sighed as she rested her head in her hand, glancing out the window. The weather was pleasant and warm, as it had been for almost two weeks after a heavy shower of rain, with not a cloud on the impossibly blue sky. Molly absentmindedly smiled to herself as she glanced up at it.
Further, because Angelina was the Gryffindor Quidditch captain, Fred became more serious about Quidditch, which was supposed to be just a sport which they were playing for fun. That took up even more of his time, time which was not spent on doing what they were supposed to do, namely build their Joke Empire.
The Great Hall slowly fell silent as everyone was more or likely shocked into silence from the sheer audacity of the woman and her absurd pinkness. Even the teachers and Professors looked at her strangely, trying to adjust to the current situation.
“Dad, listen to me,” Harry lowered his voice, making it darker and therefore making his words sound less whiny or insecure overall. It appeared to help Remus actually focus on him. “I cannot run from the fact that I’m the symbol of the end of an era, even if I wanted to. It was possible when there was no war, and I most certainly do not want to be Harry Potter, but I won’t be given that choice. The Death Eaters will want me gone, the Ministry of Magic will want me as their symbol. I’ve already been targeted on multiple occasions when I was doing nothing but trying to attend school. I was targeted a few months ago.”
“I’ve only known him for around two years now, but we’ve lived together for at least some time…” Sirius hesitated to speak up as he considered what he might be able to share about his dogson without being intrusive. He began to speak carefully about the teenager, expressed his confusion about the fact that Harry was a Slytherin rather than a Gryffindor, and then proceeded to speak about the interests he knew Harry to be enjoying. He didn't speak of the famed boy-who-lived so much as acknowledged that James and Lily must have done something extraordinary in vanquishing the Dark Lord. After all, he knew that Harry wasn't any of that anyway.
The guard was crowded in the hallways beneath the attic space, close enough to the hidden opening in the wall to easily be able to enter, but also far away enough that they could hide should the Death Eaters for some reason appear three hours early. They would move up to the attic soon, but they were waiting for Draco Malfoy to join them before they positioned themselves, so as to not hide from the teenager whose life they were attempting to save.
The large snake shook her body before laying herself down upon the ground, slowly beginning to roll herself up in a comfortable pile of venomous basilisk.
“What was that, student?” Umbridge had begun to look through the papers on her desk, her eyes no longer focused on the boy.
Harry simply nodded to show that he had understood and appreciated the information. “What were you and Ginny fighting about?”
If Harry spoke up about his true feelings on the subject of his dad’s predicament, then Professor Slughorn might demote him to the end of the table. Or even worse, kick him out of the Slug Club completely. He logically understood that he couldn’t risk it all for the sake of his dad, who wasn’t even in the room for the moment. He understood and he knew what he should reasonably do. He knew what Harry Potter should do.
Another voice, a terribly familiar voice, added itself to the group right before a Death Eater was hit by a spell which sent her to the floor, crashing into the cold stone as her still body didn’t allow her to move.
Hermione breathed a sigh of relief and hugged the book about snakes closer, “thank Merlin. I do not like the cold out there.”
Time was moving on without James and Lily Potter, and life was moving on for everyone, for Benny, and for himself.
It took Arthur almost ten years to be allowed a position as Head of a department, while Lucius became a member of the Hogwarts Board of Governors two years after graduating. Even then, Lucius was handpicked and Arthur was mostly selected for his position because the other candidates had not wanted the responsibility of the safety of every Muggle in Britain during a brutal Mage War which was heavily based on blood inequality. Arthur strongly came to believe in blood equality for all mages, although he was partly motivated by wanting to be as far from Lucius and his Pureblood ideals as he possibly could. It brought him great joy to know that Lucius was furious with him for squandering his noble blood in the name of equality, rather than support Lucius desired idea of supremacy.
In fact, he appeared to be almost sick. Even if he had done his utmost to cover the traces of tiredness with makeup, he could not quite hide that he was not well. Or perhaps Arthur just knew after having had the displeasure of knowing the man for so long. Lucius’s gait was slow and almost unfocused, with a reliance on the cane to keep him upright. His grey eyes appeared both watery and dry at the same time. His lips were dry and while the hair was almost perfectly styled, it hung lifelessly around his face, rather than shine like pearls as it had done since he was a teenager.
“He’s here to save us from the old bag.” Potter laughed and pointed towards the portrait with his naked foot.
“I was wondering, sir, is there a difference between mage blood and Muggle blood? You have already disclosed that there is a difference between supposedly healthy blood, and the blood of a person infected with a blood condition, but can you tell apart other types of blood?” Harry carefully managed his way through the sentence.
“There is some almost hundred years old wine in the wine cellar. You are a wine guy, aren’t you? You couldn’t possibly pass that up.” Sirius spoke quickly, knowing that he was right in everything he said.
“Yep, we’re going on a date. I can’t wait to have an ice cream by the river or something, it’s too darn hot!” George’s former second half and current brother complained.
“I do not know anymore,” finally, Narcissa confessed. “I thought so… I wanted to believe so… But I… I’m… My circumstances have changed, Andie. Things are different. I… Cannot talk about this. I do not wish to speak of it. I… I need…” She stopped to search for something before she concluded in a somewhat lame matter. “I need more time.”
“Very well, I’ll speak to Madam Pomfrey,” Severus yielded. “Please speak to him. Ease him in any way that you can, help him in any way you can. I’m powerless to do either in the situation I find myself in. I trust that you might be able to at the very least help my Godson.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Al smiled serenely at Harry as he kept his hand on the mirror, leaned his head to the side. He appeared a specter of white and gentle blue as he stood still and calm where he was. Harry noticed that it was Al’s left hand which rested upon the mirror, and that the ringfinger was bare while all other fingers were decorated with rings. “You’ve been a very good friend to me this year. I want you to know that.”
“Good morning, Mr. Lupin,” the Head nurse sighed as she noticed that Harry had returned, as persistent as a headache and maybe equally disturbing in her eyes. “I expect you to be in school today, or here during visiting hours.”
The diversion worked, as Remus greatly enjoyed talking about books, but while he spoke, Harry was formulating his plan. The more the plan took shape, the more reasonable and accomplishable it appeared to be. He only needed to ask Sirius for help, which was the biggest drawback of his plan, but other than that, the plan would definitely work. Probably. Likely. Harry would make it work.
Harry blinked at her. “He was crying? When was this? I mean, when did that happen?” Harry hadn’t intended on asking so many questions, but he asked them nonetheless, unable to cease his mouth’s desire to speak the confusion of his mind.
However, the werewolf’s adjustment to the new home had caused some problems. The various scents in Orion Black’s study made the werewolf agitated, as the unfamiliar environment caused it stress. Not to mention that the door wasn’t very secure, and the beast had even managed to open it. Sirius had found the werewolf slowly exploring the top floor landing, and had thus spent the night as a dog, keeping the larger canine from trying to walk down the stairs. Nothing had really happened, and Harry doubted that anything would have, even if the werewolf had roamed the house and potentially found his room. After all, Harry had met the beast when it hadn’t been soothed by the potion, and it hadn’t hurt him at all.
After a few minutes of simply walking, Pat spoke up again in a very quiet voice. “Say, Goyle… Do you think that Vince has changed?”
The large black snake did indeed realise what was asked of him. Slowly, he made his way off the sofa and slithered over towards the jar. In a frightening display of non-human anatomy, the snake raised up somewhat, unhinged his jaw and struck towards the jar. He missed, sending the jar clattering over the floor.
Ron steeled himself for what he should probably have told everyone else sooner, but hadn’t quite managed to as he was kept away from them by Lavender’s needs and his own perceived blatant cowardice.
As Sirius struggled to his feet after having the air pushed out of his lungs, Lestrange aimed another attack at him as he protected his partner with his own body. He struggled to raise his wand to deflect it, yet to his surprise, someone else appeared next to him on the stage, and deflected the magic for him as he helped pull Sirius to his feet.
George stretched his hands far up over his head, reaching towards the sky above him. Above him, the moon shone like a benevolent eye, hiding among a sea of stars. In his slightly intoxicated state, he found himself reaching for it with his damaged, slightly broken hands as a small grin formed on his face.
“And the air is stale,” Parkinson continued as she crossed her arms and huffed. “Draco stinks too, of disgusting… stuff. I don’t want to get that stuck to my clothes or hair.”
“Alright…?” George left the question hanging open, but when Bill didn’t speak up, he continued in his stead. “Did you and Fleur have a fight?” He suggested the worst thing he could think of, thus making the worst suggestion the first one.
Harry smiled at his friend and nodded, “I’ve never been a model before, but if you want me to be, I don’t mind. Would you like me to ask the others? I’m sure none of them would mind.”
It had been a very surprising, and slightly frightening turn of events to realise that their mum couldn’t tell Fred apart from George, even though they were evidently different. Percy had been too young to understand why it had frightened him, but he knew why by now.
“A somewhat sad existence.” Kreacher agreed as he sipped his own tea, his gaze focused on something beyond space at time which Remus’ couldn’t share.
“Thanks,” Bill appeared to finally relax as he no longer felt alone with his partner being busy with their other friends. He leaned over to hug Sirius, who returned the hug with one arm. “You look like you slept on the floor.”
“I have an aunt?” Harry accidentally interrupted the Professor, then quickly placed his hands over his mouth. “Sorry, I really didn’t mean to interrupt.”
“It’s just what motivates me,” Harry continued, pretending that he wasn’t affected by talking about living for the sake of not causing his dad hardship and pain. “It would be silly to think that you would all be motivated by the same thing, so I don’t know if that will help anyone but, well, there you have it. I feel like I should remind you that Neville only managed to cast a patronus by calming down and not thinking about others and his responsibilities. Meaning that we’re evidently very different in our approach.”
“Yes.” At this point, the word ‘yes’ had started to lose the meaning to him, and he felt redundant having to repeat it so often.
She wasn’t quite sure how she had gotten away but she agonised over the fact that she had somehow lost Harry along the way. It was not until she saw him in the entrance hall that she forgave herself for having abandoned him as she escaped and hid in Arthur Weasley’s office, under his desk. Harry had no qualms to forgive her when she finally dared asking him if he was mad at her, which he assured her that he was not.
Lavender had realised that she was indeed very special, and she had turned it upon all around her, but only when they couldn’t hear it. She even mocked Pat for not being magical, but as Pat proved to be a witch as well, that made them even better friends than before. Two magical, powerful witches in the world of Muggles, clinging to their right of being better than everyone else… rather like blood supremacists, now that Pat thought about it. Not to mention that Pat had not been any better as a child, and only become better because somebody had helped her feel better about herself and taught her differently. Wait no... she was still doing it given the Pureblood mentality. Ugh.
The promise made Harry feel slightly less worried about the detention. Such ventures were seldom pleasant, but Harry had particularly unpleasant memories about venturing into the Forbidden Forest and encountering the Dark Lord during his last detention. Harry had to reach back into his brain to even remember what he had gotten detention for. He believed it had been something to do with Ron and staying out late, but he couldn’t quite recall it clearly.
Harry, Draco and Hermione especially appreciated her active guidance of them, while Ron and Teddy struggled somewhat with the abundance of information which she was giving them in short bursts. Neville announced that he had never found Magic History so engaging before, something which they all could agree with with varying levels of enthusiasm. It was a relief to know that the different Houses were still allowed to sit wherever they wanted in the classroom, which meant that at the very least Umbridge had not stolen that from them yet.
I can feel my face heating as he calls me by the unfamiliar, strange title which is somehow mine. I still struggle to believe it. I was accepted back to Hogwarts as a teacher, as a Professor. I will be teaching Practical Dark Arts, one of my favorite subjects today, but one of my most loathed subjects in school. It is not so much a full time job as it is an additional Transfiguration and Magical History subject which is hosted around the year without a fixed method of teaching. I enjoy the flexibility of the position compared to being a full time Transfiguration Professor, even if that is technically what I am educated for.
Tom nods. He isn’t quite certain of what I’m talking about, but he understands that there was a war and now there is not. At least not in the Muggle world.
“Enough about that!” Umbridge called as she raised her hands. “I won’t have another word of it! You are all expelled and you will be expected to leave Hogwarts tomorrow morning. The Express will take you back to London and t-”
“Quite done there,” Draco let go of his creation which was usually referred to as ‘Hermione’s hair’ and handed her a mirror through which she might admire his work. “What do you think?”
“As many of you know due to your parents speaking with you of it, Albus Dumbledore has failed this school in numerous ways. Because of his failures, I will be implementing a few changes throughout this year and likely the next. Every change and new regulation which I change or add will be hung up outside of the Great Hall for all of you to read. It will also be announced verbally at dinner and breakfast both.” Yet again, the woman paused to allow the students to react to her words.
“He wouldn’t be calling for Draco Malfoy of all people!” Brown objected, loud enough that both Neville and Colin hushed her.
Mrs. Malfoy was technically family, yet Molly struggled to think of her as such. The woman appeared so impossibly far from everything which Molly considered normal. She knew that Mrs. Malfoy was a patron of Hermione Granger, a young woman who had no connections or family within the mage community. Molly struggled to believe that Mrs. Malfoy was the type of person who would do anything for someone she didn’t know, and yet she had heard nothing but positive things about the woman from Hermione. The image of the cruel, cold and selfish woman who had married the awful Lucius Malfoy clashed violently with the elegant lady who was drinking tea and speaking to the two younger lovers, one of which was a werewolf, addressing them as her equals, and as her friends.
Summer eventually passed, like summers tend to do, and it became time to travel to Hogwarts yet again.
“It is a somewhat simplified explanation, but as the general wealth of England grew, more people wished to have a say in politics, which led to the decline of the influence of the crown and the rise of the British parliament. Aristocracy no longer mattered to the same extent, because far more people could reach a financial level where they were respected enough by society for their views and opinions to matter. In a society where Muggle men rose to power as traders, engineers and other professions, the idea of being granted the right to rule above others from birthright alone had little value. Pureblood families have long since clung to the ideals of a ruling aristocracy role in a community where that position no longer exists, or is welcomed in general politics.” Professor Snape paused to make sure that his two students were still following his reasonings.
February came, another week passed and George was still not talking like he had promised himself that he would do. He returned to the lyrics of his comfort song, and was somewhat negatively affected by the feeling of hopelessness as he was still stuck upon
“I did, I leant a lot when I was assisting you with your hair last year.” Draco patted Harry’s head as he spoke to Hermione. “I was hoping that you would allow me to assist you in preparing for the dinner on the 25th, as I’ve encountered a few styles of hair which I think would look very good with your ball gown.”
“Please,” Molly nodded, leaning forward as he grabbed her skirts, unaware of the fact that she was holding her breath.
“I’m afraid I can’t overturn another teacher’s detention, but should it prove to be unreasonable, I will of course discuss the matter with the Headmaster and subsequently assure that it shall not happen again.” The Potions Master promised.
“Then I will speak with Severus and Al,” Harry insisted, “and I will meet you there in that space. We’ll decide our next step based on what they chose, and I will come be with you up there. I really can’t leave you alone when you are practically suicidal from the weight of all this horror.” Harry’s hands closed around Draco’s, holding him far harder than he probably should. “I will save you.”
“Which is which?” Draco turned to Fred, who was just about to point that out for them as the room was cleared of people.
“I can’t break up with him! That… That wouldn’t… I mean, I…” She stumbled through her words before she stopped. Maybe she really was making excuses. Maybe it actually was as naturally simple as Goyle said, but she was the one making it far more complex with her insecurities and doubts. “I couldn’t do that,” Pat whispered. “I’d be all alone.”
Colin then turned to Draco, carefully maneuvering the, to him, rather unknown territory which was Harry’s best friend. “I know we don’t know each other very well, so I won’t assault you by asking how you’ve been or what you’ve been up to. I won’t even ask if you’re alright since you couldn’t possibly be, but I want you to know that it’s really nice to be able to talk to you again. With the whole I’m a Muggle-born and you’re a Pureblood waltz, I mean.”
The Minister of Magic spoke to the press during the evening of the 18th of February, issuing the following statement to the British mage community: While there is cause for alarm, and very wise indeed to ensure the safety of one's family and children, it is of utmost importance to remain calm. The mages in question are all dangerous and most of them are acknowledged supporters of the deceased Dark Lord, yes. But they are also mages who do not possess their own wands. Neither do they have the physical and mental strength of before their imprisonment due to the very important services of the dementors of Azkaban.
“It is not so much that I was selfish as that I have done most, if not all, of those things out of a sense of guilt, rather than anything remotely worth being proud of.” Albus mumbled more than he spoke up.
His small hand squeezes mine as he allows me to lead him out the room and towards the nuns’ office. Children shy away from me and Tom as we walk hand in hand. Tom walks close to me, pretending not to notice or mind their frightened stares as he accompanies a stranger willingly. They must be used to him refusing to walk with anyone from the way that they are staring. I give Tom another small squeeze as I focus on the path before me, recalling bitterly yet sweetly the way I felt when El took my hand and guided me through Hogwarts and onto the dance floor. I see the fear, worry and need to flee in Tom’s eyes, just as El likely saw in mine that night. I do not let Tom run back to his room, as I know that he wants to because he feels the need to hide. I understand now the weight of what El once did for me, things which felt incomprehensible to me in the past.
“I really don’t see what you are trying to tell me…” Lavender crossed her arms over her chest, huffing.
He would probably be a little ashamed to admit that he didn’t care so very much right then, he would even describe himself as very easy, sexually speaking. It wasn’t something he had yet had the chance to act very much on, but he wasn’t currently together with Ginny, even if they hadn’t quite figured out whether they were going; at least they were friends, right then, nothing dramatic was between them, and they could spend time around another. He just… couldn’t care. His mind hurt, memories chased him, he doubted everything and everyone, he felt immense guilt over so many things, and physical pleasure just seemed all the more appealing; the experiences he had been having sexually in the past, alas few, had completely emptied his mind and made him feel good, after all. Anyway, he was getting ahead of himself, when he could just appreciate that Draco dared seeking comfort in him.
Ron twisted them both in the air and clumsily wrapped his arms around Draco, falling before the other as he trusted in the slightly magically enhanced equipment and his helmet to help him land more safely in the snow. Both Ron and Draco landed with a weak thud, and Draco bounced off Ron whereupon his limp body rolled in the snow and came to a halt.
The other woman was close to her face, smiling a little teasingly, “so what do I call you, Captain?” The last word was not so much spoken as purred.
From that point on, it was harder and harder to make sense of Severus’ words until the man was simply crying against Remus’ chest, mourning the loss of the man he had never dared to welcome as a father, but who he had wanted to accept as such.
“Hi, I like your dragon back there. It had a cool hat.” Ted raised his hand in a greeting. He was already nervous, judging by the way he began rambling about things in an attempt to avoid drawing attention to himself.
About miscarriages and loss of children, not actively happening but mentioned in more descriptive manners than previously.
He does not take kindly to my apparent calmness. Before I can speak up, he speaks to me, “are you another priest? Will you throw holy water at me after binding me to the bed? Will you hammer another cross into the wall?” He points behind him at the various religious symbols which have been crudely affixed to the wall. “Or are you here to take me to a madhouse? I have heard that that’s where mad people go. I’m not scared of it!” He adds hastily with the defiance of youth, pouting his childishly red lips at me.
“But do not forget that you have made yourself this way also, a lot of credit lies with you,” Albus reminded him with a gentle smile.
When Molly had been a child, she had dreamt about living in a castle, like many young people did. Being a guest at Malfoy Manor was as close as she had ever been to that imagined dream life of her childhood.
It was not that she was angry at Narcissa specifically. She wasn’t really angry at a specific person any longer, as most of them were dead. Yet Andromeda was not about to simply act as if she hadn’t been thrown out of the family without money or connections for the sake of pleasing her sister. It had hurt to be rejected by everyone she knew, and she would not allow herself to act as if that hurt was not real, even if it had long since dulled within her chest.
Harry took a deep breath and began to roll his sleeve up before he turned the large and crude scar towards the woman, allowing her to see it. Like he had expected, she gasped, unable to remain professional or even calm in the face of the revelation that Harry’s arm was in fact not undamaged. Harry allowed himself to roll his eyes.
He thinks for a moment, and I can tell that he is translating something in his head. “Are you using outer magic, or inner magic?”
“Professor,” Hermione objected, “I think that might be a bad idea. You have more reason than anyone to struggle with that item being destroyed in the first place, and if you would, in the worst case, turn against us, we couldn’t possibly face you in combat.” She nervously fumbled with her skirt as she spoke, unable to quite meet his gaze.
“My son!” The man exclaimed loudly yet again as he captured all of Sirius in a hug, holding him tightly as they both were overwhelmed by their emotions. “It is a Christmas miracle, my son has returned…” The old man, whose name was Benjamin Potter, although Sirius has known him as Benny through most of his life, beamed at him.
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Lucius sit up as if he had been struck by some manner of powerful magic. His gaze was almost wild with desperation and his lower lip quivered with emotion.

His favorite line was to ask people about their supposed ideas for the usage of a rubber duck, mostly so that he could flaunt his own knowledge that rubber ducks existed, while also watching the mages sweat over having no idea what a rubber duck was, even if he knew perfectly well that it didn’t really have a significant function.
They had just reached the door when Harry had glanced back at the room as Luna fumbled with the handle. People were duelling around the room, spells were deflected, blocked, and some hit their mark.

Unlike the other people in the pictures, Greyback’s would shift, yawn and scratch his face or neck, but he never appeared violent or angry.
