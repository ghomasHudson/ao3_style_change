“Are you in love with me?” Harry asked again. This time, Draco didn’t bother to lie.
. He raised up the skirt and spanked it hard, relishing in Draco’s loud whimpers. After a moment, it blossomed into a soft pink color, showing the outline of his hand clearly.
Cormac slipped a sly arm around his waist. Draco blushed, but he didn’t push away. He spent the rest of the evening resting his head on Cormac’s shoulder, enjoying his scent and oblivious to Harry’s predicament.
“I decided that you need to relax today, Draco. So, I’ll be asking you the questions, hm?”
During the car ride, they had mostly talked about the final details of the collab. When they got to Draco’s house, Harry was amazed. It was huge, and it even had a pair of these big-ass iron gates in front.
The thought made a slight shiver run down his body.
“Thank you.” He sighed, a wide smile on his lips. It felt nice to know that people actually cared for his wellbeing.
His strokes gradually became slower as he allowed his mind to wander and trace out each of the constellations in the sky. Libra, Scorpio, Orion, Delphinus, and hundreds more glittered in the inky black sky. They were all beautiful in their own special way.
. He loved wearing them, but they just weren’t
Potter walked up to his counter with a sullen look on his face, although as he approached the main counter (and the abundance of lavender candles) he slowly started to relax.
Harry started thrusting even faster than before, sending Draco into a crazed, overstimulated frenzy. He whined loudly and shoved his arse back as hard as he could onto Harry’s cock, making the resulting friction feel
“And what does it do, my Lord?”
Harry’s grip immediately loosened, and he slid the rest of the way into Draco. “Mm, that’s better.”
Just as he expected, his mother’s eyes lit up. She was crazy about anything that had to do with cereals. He knew it was because of her godly powers, but Draco liked to call it madness.
To his surprise, Harry simply laughed. “It’s alright. I’m sorry for scaring you.” His voice was deep and made Draco want to rub himself all over him. He blushed at the thought.
“Do you guys have classes now? We could all hang out together. We could invite other people too.” Cormac asked, smiling.
"Your feet." Harry looks at him pointedly. Draco sniffs. He usually doesn't have to share the couch with anyone at home, so he just has to compromise.
Harry sat across from him, a warm smile on his face. He was holding an iced caramel macchiato in one hand and a strawberry scone in the other.
“Can I have your number?”
As the judges read out the significant deeds she had performed, Harry found himself closing his eyes and dreaming about something… or
Draco’s in nothing but the same fucking thong he had met Harry in that day. His hair's in a long ponytail (how did Harry not notice that his hair was this long before?) and he has a smug grin on his face. He is perched in front of a mirror on an enormous bed, his head resting on a small pillow but his arse high in the air. And sure enough, Harry can see his faded signature on his left arse cheek.
Cedric lifted his burning torch higher as he led the horde of angry villagers through the dark forest. Their chants carried loudly through the silence, scaring away all the wood creatures and monsters.
“Here are the coins, Draco. I also wanted to ask if you’re free this
going anywhere.”
“Yeah, you’re stuck here," Pansy added.
A butterfly landed his shoulder as he approached the mansion, making him smile. They were always attracted to him for some reason. Probably because he always smelled like flowers.
Draco shrugged. It didn’t really do much to make Harry feel any better.
Draco wrinkled his nose and put down his caviar covered cracker. “Jesus, stop being so sappy.”
With a small burst of green light in the air, the curtains ripped themselves off the wall and fluttered gently to the ground as Draco stormed out of the room, his billowing white robes flying after him.
“Hannah, I’m sorry, but logically you are the most suspicious person.” Hermione said, quietly. She usually didn’t talk much, but she hung around with Ronald Weasley a lot.
Suddenly, a bowl of what seemed like cake batter appeared in front of Mirror-Malfoy, along with a wooden spoon.
Harry cradled Draco closely, inhaling the scent of his soft hair.
“Who’s car?” Harry asks. Draco snaps out of his little world and realizes that they’ve reached the garage.
“Shut up. At least my mother isn’t the village harlot.” He ground out and sped away, not listening to their cries of outrage.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Alright.”
“I- I’m sorry,” Harry muttered, looking away from Draco, who felt his heart break.
They both sat back down at the table. Draco looked at all the delicacies, trying to decide what to eat first. He was
Harry perked up at that. “Yeah. I can.”
!” It roared, lifting its hand as if it was about to strike him.
Kore looked at him menacingly. “
“How?”
Harry grins and picks up the next flash card from the small box in front of him. At first, he was a bit reluctant to join the live show, but Seamus is truly an amazing host. Not to mention that answering his fans' questions is actually quite fun, especially the silly ones.
“Come on, let’s finish out tour, alright?”
Draco ran inside to tell his mother the good news, and together they both hoped for a new beginning.
Draco gets his rubber band and quickly puts his hair in a messy bun. Not
Once the mist settled, he looked at what the mirror showed him.
Harry, after a lot of effort, managed to call a truce with his parents. He didn’t forgive them, but he was willing to hear them out. And honestly, that was enough.
Harry sat in front of the mirror as the glass fell steadily. Draco had been gone for three days now, and there was no sign of him returning.
“Just life in general. Have you ever thought about a different world? Besides this one.”
“I love you too, Harry.” Draco murmured against Harry’s hot mouth.
Kreacher nods as I enter the corridor and head back to my room. Upon entering, I notice that Harry is curled up under the blanket, with his eyes closed, still wearing his glasses which are lopsidedly perched on the end of his nose, seemingly asleep. I suppress a grin and I clear my throat to get his attention, “As per your culinary request, your plebeian breakfast is in fact suitable for consumption”
The slick slide makes obscene squelching noises that only make it harder to concentrate on the task at hand. Although admittedly, I am unable to do much of anything, bound as I am by this horrendous ribbon. I turn my attention instead to my cock sinking repeatedly inside Harry, a sight I never in my wildest fantasies dared to think I’d ever have the privilege to see. I find I need to close my eyes because the onslaught of images is bringing me dangerously close to coming, which of course I’m wont to do.
I’m horrifyingly breathless when I retort, “It’s your birthday, I suppose you’re entitled to make that decision for yourself. Also considering you’ve hindered my movement you’re free to do whatever you please, as you already know, git.” Salazar help me.  How Harry never ended up a bloody Slytherin I’ll never know.
He chuckles again, grabs me by the waist and unceremoniously drags me to sit on his lap, our faces inches apart, “You wish Malfoy.” And after bestowing me with one last radiant smile, he leans in to mouth at my neck yet again.
I roll my eyes at that, “Kreacher, Harry didn’t order me to make him breakfast. I want to do it. It was my idea, I offered.”
He laughs lowly, “I guess you’re right. I hope you didn’t forget the whipped cream!”
Immediately I grab for the SPA-TOOLA and scoop them out of the pan and lay them in a slightly lopsided stack. I am beyond proud of myself for actually doing it correctly that I turn to tell Kreacher he can leave, but instead Kreacher has placed more butter in the pan and is making more pancakes with the leftover batter.
Before I fully realize what is happening, I feel intense pressure around the head of my cock, as he leans in and resumes mouthing at my exposed neck. The resultant whine echoes through the kitchen, and elicits a chuckle from the bloody Gryffindor slowly impaling himself on my cock without warning.
I find myself without argument. I truly cannot argue with his logic at this point, but I still don’t know why he thinks this erases all of the truly horrible things about my past. Those acts are punishable for a lifetime, “I don’t deserve a happily ever after.” I realise belatedly that the last part was actually said aloud.
My lip twitches because okay that
There are no words, none whatsoever. I have literally no response for him.  I simply stare wide eyed, mouth gaping at the fact that he is actually correct. I don’t think I deserve for anyone to claim they love me, let alone the bloody saviour of the wizarding world. Actually it just makes me feel worse because the way he is presenting it, I’m not only being self-deprecating, but also underestimating him which leaves me feeling raw, and like the biggest prick to walk the planet.
“Don't you see? I don’t feel as though I am throwing anything away Draco, I feel as though everything I thought I wanted is trivial compared to how I feel when I’m with you. We can still have a family. To hell with tradition,  I only want a family with you. Nothing would make me happier. I want my kids to grow up in a household where I’m just a boring old dad who snores on the sofa with his glasses lopsided. I don’t want any children of mine being brought up to think that I’m some hero and have them live in my shadow. I want to be with you Draco, because when I’m with you I don’t have to pretend to be something I’m not. If I trip over my open shoe laces, you’re likely to laugh at my expense not rush over to coddle me with, ‘oh no mister Potter’ or ‘are you okay mister Potter?’”
It continues like this until I’ve accumulated all of the necessary ingredients. Kreacher even takes the time to go back to Grimmauld place to retrieve the necessary equipment I’ll require, he mentioned something about a fry pan and some mad thing called a SPA-TOOLA, two terms I have never heard before in my life.
He leans in and places another extremely gently kiss on another one of my scars and then gets to his feet. His cock is rock hard and inches from my face.  At this point I’m hard as fucking granite and having his cock inches from my mouth causes immediate salivation. I’m half convinced that he’s seconds away from sliding it in my mouth over my tongue, therefore I lean forward and attempt to lick the bead of pre-come that’s attempting to dribble down his shaft, but surprisingly, he simply chuckles and moves his hips away.
He seems to relish in making me wait because he doesn’t immediately lean in to lick off the cream, he simply takes his bottom lip between his teeth and
Somehow he manages to get both of his heels on the bed, knees pointing to the ceiling, and begins a punishing rhythm thrusting upwards with his hips. The angle is absolute perfection dragging across my prostate on each pass. The pressure at the base of my cock is building steadily as a direct result of the prostate stimulation. It feels so fucking good but I know it wont be enough. I look down at him and he’s sweating from the exertion of his thrusting but his eyes are heavy lidded and soft, almost fond. I smile down at him, a true genuine smile, and sit upright again to stroke my cock.
He chuckles again, “Not complaining by any stretch, but I am really hungry so if you’re not going to make breakfast I will because I could eat a hippogriff.’
“It’s just, I erm… don’t know if you realize… said it twice… wasn’t sure if you… meant it for me.” I finish lamely.
He takes great personal pleasure in forcing such noises from me, it’s a twisted thrill for him I cannot understand, yet he catches me off guard from time to time. I hate it… I love it. “is that all you got Potter?!” I squeak out
“What if those are infinitesimally small prices to pay for living with the person that makes me the best version of myself, hmm? What if I want to overlook those extremely irrelevant things because I finally found the person that appreciates me for who I actually am. You have no idea how much it means to me that you never saw me as anything other than Harry. To you, I’m just Harry. Not ‘Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World,’ not ‘The Chosen One,’ not ‘The Boy Who Lived.’ You see me for me, and that is by far the absolute best thing anyone has ever given me.  You see the broken boy who grew up without knowing love. You see the reckless behavior for what it truly is, a lack of perspective because I never had anyone to tether me to reality, and make me see the true consequences of my actions. You see me, a mediocre, run of the mill, four-eyed disaster and you still look at me as though… as though you love me back.”
It’s time to put an end to the spiraling thoughts I see flitting across his face. “Harry, please, don’t…”
I climb out of bed, and walk down toward the foot. I lift the blanket, and try to crawl up his right leg instead. Salazar who ever would’ve thought giving someone wake up head would be so bloody difficult?! I slowly crawl, literally with one leg on either side of his outstretched right leg, and after approximately ten minutes of slow shifting so as not to wake him, I reach the apex of his thighs.
Kreacher simply
I look at him with a raised eyebrow as though appraising him, “Scared Potter? I never thought I’d see the day.”
Although, I know why he does it if I’m honest. He drags out the build up because he has yet to master the main event. I smirk to myself at that. Him and his absurd Gryffindor nobility actually gets jealous of the fact that I am more skilled in the blowjob department. It drives him absolutely mad that he still can’t take the full length of me into his throat. You’d think that seeing as how he is the one reaping the benefits of my talents he wouldn’t mind, but OH NO, boy wonder here is downright ticked off that I finally bested him at something.
It’s almost agonizing waiting for the pan to heat, but eventually Kreacher tells me, “Master can scoop a small amount of butter into the pan now.” I do as I am bid, and I realize belatedly that I’m putting a lot of faith into this old, decrepit, creature. He could be steering me in the complete wrong direction without me knowing. This immediately puts me on edge. It’s not in my Slytherin nature to trust anyone, let alone a house elf I have little experience with, although Harry says that Kreacher is always waxing poetic about me and my “proper wizard” ways. Not as if I have another choice really, here’s hoping he is instructing me properly.
I hurriedly use the SPA-TOOLA to flip over the other two blobs and sure enough they look like pancakes too! Grinning, I turn toward Kreacher and say, “They look like pancakes! Are they done? Can I bring them to Harry now?”
I laugh outright at that, “Leave it to you to be turned on by a technical explanation of prostate stimulation…”
The scars. The scars Snape couldn’t heal no matter how much of the horrible smelling dittany he poured over the oozing wounds. The scars that were once bright angry red had faded over the years to palest white only a shade or two lighter than my skin. The scars that I caused when I opened my mouth to cast the cruciatus curse on the one person I was hoping would save me, and yet instead he marked me, permanently, not unlike someone else I know. The scars that caused pain and anguish on the man in front of me the moment he saw what he’d done. The scars he never meant to leave. The scars that held the deepest of my secrets in that I cherished them, as they meant I’d always have a piece of the boy I thought I could never have, not really. The scars that brought said man to his knees in tears the first time he saw them five months ago at Grimmauld Place. The scars that had him sobbing against my chest begging for forgiveness as if he truly didn’t believe I’d already forgiven him. The scars that he insists on atoning for every chance he gets. The scars that he claims are his life’s biggest regret, and yet they’re one of my greatest treasures. The scars that are causing him to fight back tears on his birthday. The scars that remind me on a daily basis that I survived. The scars that give me strength to prevail, and yet the scars only remind him of his ability to fail.
He shakes his head as if willing it to clear, and leans down at the corner of the largest scar and plants the softest kiss imaginable. He does this often, as if every kiss is a silent apology. “You’re beautiful. I don’t hate them, I hate myself for making you imperfect. Yet…you’re imperfections enhance your beauty, because they are visible proof that you’re a survivor. I admire you for them, all of them.”
I look over into his face full of insecurity. It’s clear he is worried that I lied about making breakfast, and he thinks I simply pity him. I can’t bear to see that lost crup expression for another second, so I cut to the chase, “If you must know, I was unaware of the proper pancake prepping procedure, so I called for Kreacher and he instructed me on how to make them, but I did make them myself, I promise. I used the SPA-TOOLA and everything. Kreacher brought over the muggle whipped cream from Grimmauld place.”
He whines at that, “Fuck that’s definitely worse.”
I wrap my lips around the head and slide all the way down again, but before I pull back, I swallow around him which causes him to cry out, “Draco, FUCK!” I glance up at him out of the corner of one eye as I slide back up and do it again. He’s muttering unintelligible praise now, and I can feel him starting to thrust his hips in the smallest involuntary movements, so I return my attention to the sensitive underside. He always loses control when I nibble at the ridge where his shaft needs the head, so I resume my earlier ministrations that were so rudely interrupted. I don’t want to neglect the rest of him, so I use my thumb to stroke the base and my other hand to fondle his balls.
to rid us of the mess on his chest. I chuckle when I realize he hasn’t cleaned the mess he left inside me.
I have half a mind to reiterate this but he stops me, “You don’t get to say that you were forced to go to muggle university due to probation because while you were required to attend for two years you did not have to graduate with honors and go on to use your knowledge to revolutionize modern healing techniques. You didn’t have to find a way to introduce wizarding remedies for cancer into the muggle world without breaking the statute of secrecy, but you did. You may argue that it was just repenting, but you still did it and saved countless lives as a result.”
“Sit the fuck down Potter, I’ll make your damn pancakes.”
“You great sap, you’re making me feel like the worst boyfriend on the planet with all the waterworks you know. What kind of arsehole makes their boyfriend cry multiple times on their birthday, I ask you?”
He reaches for the bow on top of my head and pulls hard on one of the tails to loosen the ribbon, and immediately my hands are released from their bonds. My hands rush to his hips, and I start pulling him down onto my cock in a punishing rhythm. “Touch yourself Harry, I want to see you touch yourself.”
He cracks up at that, and it’s that contagious deep belly laugh of his that lights up his whole face, and I’m elated that I caused it, but slightly put out that he thinks I can’t even cook a simple birthday breakfast.
“And just what do you plan to do about that Potter?” I retort with a challenging look and a raised eyebrow.
He laughs outright at that, “What can I say? I like knowing you can feel me even after we’re done.”
“Don’t worry Harry, I’ll take care of you.” I resume kissing him and thrusting at the same time. The position makes it more difficult for me to maneuver, but my cock is rubbing against his abs and it’s fucking fantastic. I feel him trying to shift his legs below me and I let him because I don’t want to stop the assault on his mouth.
The term of endearment slides out of his mouth so effortlessly as though he’s been saying it his whole life, and yet it throws me completely off kilter. How one simple  utterance can cause a near full blown panic is beyond me, but my heart is pounding and the blood is rushing in my ears because Harry fucking Potter just called me “Love.” I begin to ponder what my 13-year-old self would think if he was told that one day Harry Potter would refer to him as ‘love,’ but before I can delve any further into that train of thought, I’m ripped from my absurd reverie as Harry is again drawing lines with the whipped cream up the inside of my thighs from knee to groin.
He laughs outright again and eyes glittering playfully says, “Well, perhaps a self proclaimed man of particular refinement should be aware that the tool used for flipping pancakes is called a spatula not a SPA-TOOLA.” He cracks up at that, and I’m tempted to push him off my lap but his laughter is a glorious change from the tears of a few moments ago so I join him instead.
I start off with a gentle tease, pressing open mouthed kisses up and down his shaft in an attempt to bring him to full hardness. His body is still extremely relaxed, so I’m guessing he’s still actually asleep. Smirking to myself, I flatten my tongue, and lick a fat stripe up the underside of his cock and feel it twitch in my hand. Preening, I then press little kitten licks to the sensitive spot on the underside just below the ridge that separates the head from the shaft. I continue this for a while, and slowly increase the pressure of my tongue. At this point he’s fully hard, so I continue mouthing at the underside, and stroke my thumb at the base of his cock for a dual sensation that he loves. It’s after I’ve been doing this for a few seconds that I finally hear him moan audibly.
I reply with one of my deliberately false laughs that always manages to incense him, “Oh just the usual. You know, the fact that you’re procrastinating is quite charming really. I never took you as one to back down from a challenge though Potter.” I peer down my nose at him with a smug face and a raised eyebrow.
“Well, you’ve never had someone who appreciates the finer things in life to bestow said luxuries upon you.”
I roll my hips over and over, thrusting his cock as deep as I can, all the while staring him down in challenge. Gauging when he’s going to snap and release the bonds himself. I know he can get out of them, as does he but for whatever reason he’s opting to allow me the control. I groan audibly at the thought and pick up the pace.  He’s breathing heavily now, I see his chest heaving and I can see the beginnings of a flush creeping up his neck.
leans in and takes the head of my cock between his lips.  I let out an audible groan, as he slides lower, and lower getting closer and closer to completely engulfing me in his mouth. I begin to feel the constriction of his throat on the tip of my cock and anticipate the tell tale clench of his gag reflex. It doesn’t come because he quickly pulls back with a hard suck and an audible slurp, “You think you’re so clever don’t you Malfoy. Think you can manipulate me into doing exactly what it is you want. Nice try, but I think you’re forgetting who is in charge here.”
Now it’s my turn to blush and avert my eyes because fuck I hate feeling vulnerable.
“You what Draco? You’re surprised that I can read you? When I’ve been doing just that since we’re about eleven? You can’t believe that something good is happening to you because then you must be dreaming? What is it?”
I can’t even begin to describe how incredible moments like these are for me.  Something as simple as laughing with Harry can lift my mood for the rest of the day. I know deep down that I’ve wanted this for far longer than I’m willing to admit to anyone, and having it is still so surreal.
I turn my attention to the can of cream then, as the anticipation of what Harry is planning finally registers in my lust riddled brain. He seems to understand the direction to which my thoughts have drifted because he says in an embarrassingly accurate drawl not unlike mine, “You see, the benefit of using the whipped cream in the can is the precision of application. I can place it exactly where I want it.” He then tips my head to my left and trails a line of whipped cream from my right shoulder over my collar bone, and up the line of my neck, ending right behind my ear. I shiver with anticipation because
“Young Master is a proper wizard, and proper wizards don’t cook, ‘tis the job of the house elf.” Kreacher grumbled.
By the time I throw on some pants and make my way to the kitchen, I realize that for all of my talk about making pancakes being simple, I have not even an inkling as to where I should start.  I don’t even know what ingredients are involved if I’m honest. The stirrings of panic set in as I realise I promised him breakfast and I outright refuse to be another person who lets him down on his birthday.
,” and then I pull up ever so slowly and begin riding him like my life depends on it.
I’m still a bit breathless when I reply “I meant you to hear you reckless bastard.” Therefore the bite in my words is lost as he simply smiles at me.
He chuckles lowly and scoots closer, “I would love it if you made me pancakes, but you really don’t have to. I don't make a big fuss on my birthday. It's… never really been a cause for celebration.” He trails off with uncertainty at the end.
“Happy Birthday Indeed.”
. It’s almost as if one of his more filthy desires is being played out and he wants to prolong it. He all but growls, “Look at you, utterly delicious.” Without any further warning he leans in and licks over the trail of cream, starting at my shoulder and ending at the base of my neck. “Fuck you taste incredible,” he mutters sotto voce.
My face heats scarlet, so I scoff and add indignantly, “Bloody Gryffindor, the color is way too garish and overstated to complement my aristocratic complexion. You clearly have horrible taste in hues.”
“Don’t forget the whipped cream!” I hear him shout from the bedroom.
“You have no idea, you really have no idea…” he says in a choked up voice. I still have no idea what he’s on about so I simply wait for him to continue, “Draco, have you really convinced yourself that you aren’t worthy of love? Do you truly deep down believe that there’s no possible way someone, could actually love you for the person you’ve become? For the person you are?”
“So you want to be with me because I laugh at you when you do dumb things?” I ask incredulously.
“I didn’t hear you complaining at the time, wanker.”
I scoff audibly and retort, “Of course you do, if anyone deserves their happily ever after it’s you. But, I can’t give you everything you need Potter. I can’t give you a traditional family, I can’t give you a life without constant worry about your significant other. Any potential life we’d have together would be forever tainted by my past mistakes, and that, I am certain, you truly don‘t deserve.” I trail off pathetically at the end because it pains me to verbalize it.  It’s one thing to keep it hidden deep in the recesses of my mind, but vocalizing it makes it more real somehow.
I look at him then, and his expression is so soft and genuine, that I find myself unable to find any more excuses. I find myself inexplicably climbing down off the chair and kneeling in front of him, still holding both of his hands in mine. I take in a shaky breath and look directly at him as I’m about to say the words I’ve been repressing for years if I’m truly honest with myself. The words I fear saying above all others, the words that have never really been spoken aloud to me by anyone, save the man in front of me a few moments ago. The words that want to spring free whenever I’m in his presence. The words I never thought I’d ever have the courage to say, “I Love you too.”
I’m honestly dumbfounded at this point because I have no inclination as to what he’s planning. It makes me feel slightly wrong footed to tell the truth.  I watch him warily, however he simply smiles at me, proceeds to sit in my lap, and presses an unbelievably chaste kiss on my lips.  He pulls back and smiles at me so I return it 10-fold.
“Yes Kreacher, I want to cook him breakfast for his birthday. He didn’t have great birthdays growing up, and I feel quite horrible about it, so I want to make every birthday he celebrates with me the best I possibly can. Harry appreciates gestures more than material gifts so I
“Happy Birthday Harry,” I whisper and the illuminating smile I receive in return leaves me breathless yet again. I can’t help but wonder “How the fuck can someone be this beautiful without knowing?” I’m unsure if it’s the immediate flush, the shocked expression, or the subsequent shy smile that clues me into the fact that I said it out loud.
My plan was to have him wake up to his first birthday surprise. Interestingly enough, the thing people find most irritating about me is my mouth, and yet Harry has learned fairly quickly that my snark is a small price to pay for having me put it to good use. I smirk to myself with smug satisfaction because head Auror or not, I can diminish this man to a whimpering mess in seconds using nothing but my tongue.
I hear my alarm chime softly on the bedside table, and immediately reach over to silence it. I scrunch up my eyes and slowly turn back toward the bed hoping with everything I have that I didn’t wake up Harry.  He’s quite the light sleeper considering everything he’s been through, but it seems as though I’ve managed to wake up without him noticing.
I let out a sigh of relief, because the elf seems to be begrudgingly willing to help me. I move to grab flour from the cupboard when I hear Kreacher continue, “Kreacher also uses salt, baking powder, sugar, milk, eggs and butter for Master Harry’s pancakes.”
Just to be contrary and piss him off a bit because FUCK he’s sexy when he’s angry, “Are you insinuating that you weren’t enjoying your gift?”
I continue swallowing him down repeatedly, fully intending to make him come like this, but in one swift movement, he lifts the blanket, then grabs a fistful of my hair and hauls me up for a filthy open mouthed kiss that tastes of morning breath and pre-come, and yet I’m moaning into his mouth because fuck the neediness does me in every. Fucking. Time. “Good morning to you too he says with a smile.”
“No worries, my stubborn arse of a boyfriend insisted on birthday sex before I could even open my eyes so my appetite is in full gear at the moment.”
Predictably he takes the bait, “Sod off Malfoy, I never back down from a challenge.” And with that he
He beams at me again and says, “Can’t really be considered a sacrifice if the colour actually suits you, git.”
He seems to understand because he stops bobbing up and down, and adjusts his position. He leans back with his left hand on my right knee, his right hand on my left shoulder. He then begins grinding into me again with his head thrown back in ecstasy. He seems to have found the angle that presses my cock against his prostate because he cries out, “What the fuck was that?!”
“Always with the dramatics!” He says on a laugh. “It’ll be quite a challenge to one up yourself every year you know. I’m not sure I can handle being surprised like this every year.”
The tears have returned. I blink to release them from my lashes and they streak silently down my face leaving wet trails behind in their wake. He reaches up and gently wipes them away, and yet I can’t bear to look at him. I can’t bear to hear the things he is saying because they seem to be taken completely out of context. I had to save my mother, I couldn’t let that noseless bastard take away the one person who always found it within themselves to love me for me, even if she never said it outright. I was forced to attend muggle university for two years as a stipulation of my probation. I was hardly going to stop when I was halfway to graduation. The way he paints it, isn’t the full truth.
I reach over behind the chair, and in faux resignation, grab the utterly garish red bow and place it precariously on the top of my head. “Never let it be said that I don’t make sacrifices for those that I love.”
where his mouth has been!” But I can’t be arsed to care. He did cast a cleaning charm after all.
Sometimes I still can’t believe I’m allowed to be here, lying next to him, seeing him like this with no walls, it’s the most intimate corner of our relationship and I cherish the trust he has found for me beyond anything else.  Today, I want to show him how incredibly special he is, not only to me, but to everyone included in his life.  I want to make him feel cherished, loved, and worthy of said love because due to his upbringing he needs constant validation. Validation I am more than willing to provide, mind you.  It’s the least I can do after...yeah, after.
I smile back, relishing in the attention, “Happy Birthday Harry.”
a little funny, completely disgusting, albeit humorous. “Well, perhaps you don’t deserve the spoils from my kitchen if you’re going to mock my culinary skills before even letting me attempt something as simple as pancakes.”
Dimly, I hear Harry chuckling in the background, “Perhaps spending so much time with Kreacher was ill advised. I can hear your mumbled diatribe ya know.”
“Draco,” he pleads, and hearing him say my name like that
Fuck, but Potter’s cock is already partially filled out. The impressive bulge straining obscenely against the fabric of his boxer briefs has me salivating already. Patience wearing thin, I slowly lower the waistband of his pants until his cock is accessible. He’s not yet fully hard, so it’s still resting softly against his bollocks.  I gently use my hand to raise it up just enough so I can slide the head between my lips.
Without warning, he casts a wandless, wordless, cleaning charm and unceremoniously puts his mouth to work on my arsehole. I’m too fucking disoriented to fight with him at the moment, so I surrender to the incredible things he’s doing with his tongue. If I hold the title for giving the best blow jobs, Harry by far wins in the category of rimming.
“Me.” He says simply, the smug wanker as if this is an everyday occurrence. Not even wondering at the fact that I’m freaking the fuck out because I’m balls deep in Harry fucking Potter’s arse right now and it’s taking every ounce of willpower to prevent myself from coming. Fuck this is something I never actually anticipated coming to fruition, but now that it has I never want it to end.
I feel trembling hands gently grip the sides of my face and tilt my head upward to look at him, but I stubbornly keep my eyes closed. I don’t want to see pity there, and I sure as shite don’t want to see any judgement for my ill advised moment of vulnerability. I try to turn my head to the side to escape the scrutiny I know he’s bestowing upon me, but he prevents it. “Draco, it’s okay just please open your eyes hmm?”
He groans again, and I can’t stifle the laughter that continues to emerge. “It’s not the words it’s your fucking posh voice, you wanker.”
’ But before I can utter a syllable he flips the blob over into the pan with the bubble side down. To my utter astonishment the blob now looks like a pancake! It’s golden brown the exact shade a pancake should be.
he adds with that arrogant tilt of his chin making him appear powerful and sexy as fuck.
“I’d move but someone in their absolute brilliance has
I use my elbows to sit up straight at the foot of the bed, and using both, hands pull him up by his hair into a filthy kiss. He moans around my tongue, so I press in deeper. In the back of my mind I’m thinking “what is wrong with you?  You
Once I hear the moan, I pull off, give a kitten lick to his slit now dripping with pre-come, and then drop my jaw and swallow him down to the hilt. It’s taken practice, but I’m proud to say that I can take the whole length of him now. Merlin forbid Potter have an average sized cock, no he’s beyond well endowed. Although now that I’m reaping the benefits, I’m less pissed off by that fact if I’m honest.
I collapse onto him, my entire prone figure pressing him into the mattress.  Somewhere in the background I hear a muttered
Predictably, Harry is incapable of keeping his touching entirely platonic for long. I feel him run his hands down the line of my jaw and onto my neck which causes an involuntary shiver on my part. I can almost feel the smirk on his face as he begins to nuzzle his chin stubble into the crook of my neck to begin mouthing at the sensitive skin there.
He starts to laugh at that, I can feel his arms trembling around my neck. He leans back and scrubs a hand across his face in a poor attempt to dry his tears and says, “I’m not upset, I’m touched beyond belief that you would actually take the time to learn how to make pancakes from Kreacher just to make me breakfast. He doesn’t have the sunniest disposition on a good day.” He leans in and places a soft watery kiss on the right corner of my mouth. “Thank you, this is by far the best birthday I’ve ever had,” he says watching me with watery eyes.
“First of all, that's bollocks. Second of all, what about me Draco, do I deserve a happily ever after? Because you’re it for me.” He looks up at me then, and I want to punch him because that’s so fucking unfair.
“I’m just getting started, Malfoy.” He says in a deadly serious tone, and without another syllable he leans in and drags his tongue up the length of my cock again, only slower, more torturous. He’s such a fucking tease, always prolonging the moment when he finally takes my into his mouth.
Kreacher continues grumbling, however there are no audible words until, “Kreacher usually uses flour to make Master Harry pancakes.”
Kreacher barks utterances at me under his breath until I’ve created a lumpy liquid concoction of sorts. Looks sort of like a pale batch of polyjuice gone wrong if I’m honest. Kreacher instructs me to heat the pan over medium high heat, and then when he realizes I have no idea how to use the stove, he shows me how to adjust it to the correct setting.
“I can’t touch you if you don’t release my hands Harry.”
I take a moment to simply observe him as he sleeps.  It’s unusual that I get to see him in such a vulnerable state, but I relish these rare times.  He looks so damn peaceful like this. No tension in his jaw, eyelids gently closed, hair a mess, eyelashes lying softly on his cheeks. He looks young, and carefree in a way that he hardly ever is when awake. Carries the weight of the world on his shoulders this one.
Potter ruffled his hair, desperately trying to disentangle the imaginary leaf. “Is it gone?” Draco nodded. Oh Merlin, it was happening again. Pansy would have a field day.
It was an erratic rhythm, jumping to stay in time with Harry’s pulse. Draco didn’t care if Potter left and he never saw him again, his hand was entwined with his own and that was all that mattered. This was different to the times they’d apparated, this was different to anything they’d ever done before. This was something unspoken, thumping between them like wings against glass.
Okkkk, cue the beginnings of a good old sexuality crisis. Still, Harry's getting there, slowly. Chapter 8 is giving me a hard time at the moment so it might be a little later than Wednesday but I'll try. Stick with me! The angst isn't too bad, I promise! >:)
“Uh…” the girl looked down at the book and back up at Harry, “book?” She slid it further towards him.
The Burrow was Ginny’s family. If Harry were to leave her, he hoped that he was wrong, but he feared they would abandon him, side with their daughter instead. He couldn’t lose his family. They were too important to him.
Potter’s arms wrapped around his waist, breath against his ear, head on his shoulder. He almost shivered. It was beyond dreaming.
“Thought it was…?” Harry’s eyes widened and he pushed himself up from where he leaned against the pillar. “The one who’s been threatening you?”
“I really am, you know,” Harry whispered, “happy for you.”
Draco placed his hand over Harry’s, his fingers cold.
Ok, I lied. You can say it, I am the worst. Since my posting schedule is effectively dead, this counts as Wednesday right?
“Just not in the way I’m supposed to.” Harry nodded. He thought perhaps he knew exactly what she meant. “I’ve loved you for years, since I was a girl, but I think I was in love with the idea of you.” It shattered him to hear it, but Harry guessed he’d always known, somewhere, deep down. Ginny had always loved his scar, not the mind behind it. She’d gotten to know him past all that, yes, but she’d been swept up in all his stardom, something a little difficult to just forget.
Harry stood to his feet, flashing her an easy smile. “Not at all,” he said, jabbing a thumb over his shoulder in Draco’s direction, “he’s just got a migraine, happens a lot.”
He’d only just found him, for Merlin’s sake. Of course, Malfoy had always been there, since year one, but Harry had found Draco, and had finally been able to call him by his forename. Malfoy didn’t define him, but Draco did, and Harry was starting to realise what that truly meant.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You really are a child.” He shook his head. “So, I’m tired and I want to go to sleep.”
Draco’s hopeful smile fell, replaced by his usual emotionless demeanour. “Very well,” he said tightly.
“You’re threatening me now?” Draco tried not to laugh too much at the sight of Harry’s red cheeks. “I never realised you cared so much about muggle literature.”
He followed Malfoy through the halls, eyes darting around as he tried not to remember how he was jostled down towards the dungeon.
Hope you enjoy! Please drop me a comment if you did (or didn't...constructive criticism is also welcome, within reason of course).
“Alright, alright, yes, fine.” Harry waved a hand, ruffling his hair and preparing to stand. “I guess you’re right. I should be off.”
“You’re welcome.”
“Has he told you about his vinyl collection?” Harry rounded on him, brows quirking upwards. “He’s ever so proud, though he still hasn’t got anything to play them with.”
“If you must know,” Malfoy’s constant undermining was pushing Harry to the edge of his temper, “Keesy stayed because she had nowhere else to go. I’d have thought you of all people would understand that.”
“He…he is?” Harry’d expected Malfoy to be doing, well, something, not just sitting there waiting for him to return.
“Why a library?”
“You want me to do what?”
They didn’t talk as much this time as they walked towards the library, but the silence wasn’t uncomfortable. More than once, Harry found himself staring as light sifted through the trees, mottling Malfoy’s cheeks with an autumnal palette.
“Well yes,” Harry said, “that
He’d been wrong to say those things to Malfoy, but Malfoy had been wrong to say what he’d said to Harry. Harry sighed, beginning his dreary trudge home when the door closed softly behind him. It was always the way with him and Malfoy, insults bouncing off one another’s tongues. Harry guessed he’d probably lose his job over this; his standing with Malfoy had been tentative at best. He’d have to speak to Ginny about it. That was one conversation he was decidedly unwilling to have.
“Didn’t even know how my parents had died until Year one.” He leaned against the counter, staring at the kitchen tiles. “I didn’t know how…” a dark look came across his features and he clicked his tongue, “anyway.” He focused his attention back to the steaming pan on the stove.
Thanks for reading, your comments and kudos have meant so much to me, kept me going!
“Harry, like it or not Malfoy needs a bodyguard. We’ve tried asking everyone else.” Harry raised an eyebrow.
She pulled away after a few minutes, dragging her sleeve across her eyes. “You idiot!” she yelled at him. “You always think you’ll be better off alone, away from us! You had everybody worried sick!”
He blinked up at Draco, suddenly vulnerable.
“My, my,” she said, “if it isn’t the infamous Harry Potter.”
Harry blinked, staring into Mr Weasley’s excited expression. “Do you mean a hairdryer?”
Hermione was a Godsend, really. She'd already known something had been up with their relationship and had listened to Harry as he blurted everything he'd been bottling up for months. Ron had been nothing but supportive, though he'd been a little awkward at first. He'd soon relaxed after George had intervened with a joke, characteristically inappropriate to the situation, and everyone, including both Harry and Ginny, had laughed. Throughout everything, Hermione kept a hand on his shoulder, silently infusing him with her all strength.
“I’d say I have enough of that to last a lifetime.” Kingsley considered this for a while.
He shouldn’t be this nervous. He was a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake. It was just…after his father had been sent to Azkaban, he hadn’t had much in the way of social interaction.
Hermione nodded determinedly. She didn’t say anything more, but Harry knew that she was offering her support.
Harry frowned. Malfoy was an incredibly talented man. Surely he wasn’t struggling to hold down a job?
He had no idea what to say. Thankfully, Harry saved him the trouble.
“I don’t care that much! You just can't keep telling me famous
“I suppose we must’ve been.”
“Oh Arthur, go and take a seat at the table. Honestly, you’re bad enough around Hermione.”
Potter shrugged again. “Not sure,” he admitted, “just never really pegged you for the type to disobey the rules.”
As it happened, Lucius expected a specific kind of magic reveal, one that surpassed expectations, a manifestation that encapsulated the Malfoy name. He had time before people would begin to question the age of his son in relation to his magical ability, so he waited, coaxing the perfect reveal from his only child. Meanwhile, Draco learnt to keep the strange, more mundane magical events to himself, and learned to fear the presence of a walking cane.
Harry frowned, maybe there’d been another threat. “Everything ok?”
She threw herself at Harry, knocking him backwards as she squeezed his neck. “Thank you, Uncle Harry.”
“Oh.” Draco looked at his thumbs. Astoria. “Pureblood tradition requires an heir.” Draco’s shoulders sagged. “My parents had, well, they’d arranged a marriage between Astoria and I. We decided to maintain a…flexible marriage, but I grew too careless for her, too distant. There was no façade worth sustaining, everybody could already see through it. She left me and I ran. Ran by staying where I was, I suppose.” He chuckled, breathy. “Withdrew, is probably a better word. I withdrew.”
“No worries,” she said, and with a wink, “there’s plenty tea there for two.”
Draco loved him. He loved Harry Potter, and the world might never know.
“Harry…” Ginny bit her lip, “Harry, I do love you.”
“Yeah,” Harry swept his heel across the floor with an irritated kick, “well, I didn’t think it’d lead to this.” He shrugged, but his cheeks were stained pink. “Besides,” he said, shuffling in his seat, “I owed his mother a life debt.”
“So, what exactly do you do as a librarian?” Potter sat on the edge of Draco’s desk, idly flicking through the pages of a nearby book.
Harry sniggered, enunciating Draco’s disdain.
He saluted Draco, nodded to Harry, and started to walk down the driveway. His head was held high as it ever was, and it was difficult to imagine Blaise as anything but somebody extremely important.
Draco scowled, cheeks reddening. “That was only once,” he said, “and I wasn’t caught.”
“You…” he seemed almost unable to finish his sentence, “Draco Malfoy, the man I once believed to be the heir of Slytherin,” Draco winced at that, but thankfully Harry didn’t seem to notice, “works in a library. You work in a library? A muggle library?”
Thanks for reading :)
“That’s offensive,” Blaise shot back, and Draco heaved a huge sigh, pinching his nose.
Hopefully, you like where I'm going with this! Let me know what you think. As always, thank you for reading :)
Potter flashed a shy smile. “You know,” he said, “Harry. Just Harry. Without the ‘Potter’, without the scar. Can’t we just pretend that I’m nobody for once?”
Hermione raised her brows in asking.
Draco stared at him, blinked. “They made you cook…?”
“Carbonara,” came the curt reply, “and it isn’t poison, you’ll like it.”
“Hmm.” Draco raised a brow as Harry took his hand. “Hate to tell you, Potter, but that isn’t exactly what a Bodyguard is for.”
“He wrote a novella about an enchanted portrait. How much more obvious could it get?” Ok, admittedly he didn't have any proof to support his thesis, but Harry didn't need to know that. Endless entertainment this way. Besides, he was convincing enough.
So we'll have to wait a bit for Harry and Ginny to actually, you know, talk but they'll get there. They just need time.
Harry blinked, released his group on her hand. Luna. Of course. He remembered how happy Ginny had always sounded, whenever she’d spoken about her. He remembered the way her eyes lit up when Luna spoke, the way she laughed. You could fall in love, just with Ginny’s laugh, and it was never as true as when she laughed for Luna.
“Fine,” he said, “I’ll do it.”
Draco remembered when his magic had first manifested. He’d been younger than most, an early indication of his aptitude for spell work. He’d been out in the gardens, cross-legged beneath the skirts of a rose bush. He wasn’t sure what he’d been thinking, but it was vaguely along the lines of preserving the beauty of his mother’s flowers, this particular plant had been cultivated over years of attentive gardening. There was one wilting flower, flaccid and mottled with dark bruises. Draco had simply wanted to make it better, make it look as dainty as the others. He’d watched as it had somehow perked itself upright, only bowing it’s neck under the weight of its new petals.
Harry nodded, biting his lower lip. Maybe there wasn’t a threat, in the three days he’d been here, Harry hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary, but maybe what Malfoy needed was security, something to make him feel safe. Harry knew what that was like.
Harry nodded, looking up at Draco. He’d already promised he would.
Kingsley frowned with disapproval. “A sense of gratification,” Kingsley said, his voice without emotion.
Please do let me know what you think, I appreciate comments or kudos if you think it's deserving. Hope you're all doing well!
Harry smiled, a little wobbly, but a smile, nonetheless.
Ah, Draco thought, here comes the storm. Draco hadn’t brought it up yet, he remembered his own divorce and understood that Harry would need time, but it had been four days since his drunken incident and evidently, Hermione Granger was beginning to worry.
Draco wasn’t so sure. Still, with Harry’s arms, slipped down to squeeze his middle, he felt ready to believe him, just a little.
It wasn’t too much later that Harry stumbled backwards, barely caught by Draco when the door he was leaning against was pulled inwards.
Harry felt his cheeks burn. He’d been staring for too long. He plopped into the armchair behind him. He stared around the room. He felt exposed.
“How to cook?” Potter called.
“We don’t use stamps Potter,” Draco said, “it’s all electronic.”
Draco scowled. “He was a big dog,” he muttered, “anybody would assume that he’d be useful.”
“Don’t flatter yourself.”
He could feel eyes on him because Harry Potter wouldn’t stop staring. Didn’t he know that was rude?
Harry laughed. “I’m the chosen one, I knew I’d be fine.”
“No,” Draco agreed, “but I am now.”
It was Malfoy’s answering grin that sent Harry’s heart soaring. He felt safe here too, acknowledged for more than just the mantle thrust upon his shoulders.
It’d been nice, having Harry at the mansion. Domestic, even. Harry had cooked one night, the muggle way in fact, and Draco had tried to help, though he was rather, he hated to admit it, hopeless.
“Yes,” he said, his voice harsh.  “Why do you ask, Potter?”
“Auror Potter?”
“Get out.” Malfoy’s eyes were shining. Harry nodded slowly. He’d overstepped. He didn’t say another word, knowing that nothing he could say would help rectify the situation. Keesy was staring at him from down the hall. He forced himself to smile at her, but he supposed it must’ve been more like a grimace.
Harry had to admit, he was rather gorgeous. He felt comfortable with him, excited. They fell into step with each other, quite literally on this occasion, ideas and conversation slotting together like two ripped halves of a commemorative photograph. He wasn’t sure he ever wanted to give up this new position of his.
Despite their protestations, they did eventually decide to leave, and Blaise pulled Draco into a hug. “Take care,” he said, “I’d hate to have to arrange your obituary service.” He gave Draco a meaningful look and looked over his shoulder to throw Harry a two-fingered gesture vaguely resembling ‘I’ve got my eyes on you’.
TW: Mentions of gender dysphoria. I gave a section of this chapter to my friend, who's trans, to proofread, but I know not everybody's experience is the same so I just want to say I'm very sorry if I've misrepresented anybody with this chapter, and if there's an issue, let me know and I'll change it immediately.
A clumpy piece of Carbonara smacked against his nose and Draco yelped. He narrowed his eyes when Harry started laughing, clamping a hand over his mouth.
“I—” he started. Licked his lips. “I can’t say I understand completely, what it is you may be experiencing, but having been through a divorce myself, though this doesn’t require nearly as much paperwork I…you need people around you. You can’t push everybody away because you yourself feel helpless.”
Teddy burst down the stairs, knocking the air out of Harry’s lungs as he smacked into his stomach. Harry had to smile as little arms wrapped around his waist. “Hey Ted,” he said, crouching down to his eye level, “what’s all this then?”
“Just let me finish.” Draco closed his eyes, sucking in a deep breath. “I’ve always been a coward, but never around you. You make me brave Harry. You make me feel...like I deserve to be loved, again.”
Draco felt his lips curl into a triumphant sneer. “Oh, you’d be surprised, Potter,” he said, “unlike you, I just never got caught.”
Potter looked tired, his hair more of a mess than usual. He was dressed in his Auror robes. Draco fought the urge to groan. He knew he should’ve been specific with the dress code. “By five minutes.” Potter said. His face was expressionless. “Would you like me to leave?”
“Ah,” Malfoy said, leaning towards Harry with a predatory growl, “of course.” He grinned.
“You don’t have to be, you know. Relationships fail all the time, it doesn’t make you any less of a person Harry.”
“What can I do for you?”
What Harry felt when he thought about Draco, it was like he’d felt for Ginny, only brighter. All-consuming. It travelled from his legs to his fingers, buckling his knees at any given moment. He’d loved Ginny, and this feeling was exactly the same, if a little stronger.
“Mmm,” Potter said, nodding to where Draco sat hunched over in the desk chair, “I can see that you’re fine.” Draco shot him a glare.
Teddy barely looked at him, “I want to have long hair, I don’t like it when people tell me I have to do boy things.” He struggled with the words, not quite sure how to articulate his feelings.
“My,” his voice came out scratchy and he cleared his throat, “Father thought it best if I learned spells, and magic. He felt this was a job for the house-elves.”
He told himself he’d never felt this way about Draco before, or indeed another man, it was nothing.
“He’s accompanying me to work. He should be here soon.” Keesy smiled.
“Fine.”
“I’d always thought…,” Draco swallowed thickly, “I thought you’d grown up in luxury, with fame. I mean you were famous!”
“Alright,” he said, “alright.” He stroked Teddy’s hair, vowing silently that he’d always be here to protect his Godson. Harry frowned.
“Potter, don’t do that, you’ll—” Malfoy sighed, rubbing his eyes as Harry landed next to him, knocking over a pot of pens in the process.
Malfoy studied her curiously for a while but eventually nodded. “Very well.” Keesy nodded and hurried to the kitchens, sparing a quick glance for Harry.
Potter barked out an incredulous laugh. “’Expressed concern,’” he mimicked, “the only think you were concerned with was making sure I served detention.”
(See the end of the chapter for

All it took was a few drops of a Calming Drought and a Confusing Concoction in Draco’s water, and he was as good as immobile.
Draco heard some muffled voices on the other side of the door. Perhaps they were just some more household objects. Perhaps he was just running mad. Who knew?
Harry’s mother placed a shaky hand over her mouth. “
After letting Harry open and close the doors with the button at least three times, they set out for the cafe. Harry directs Draco to the place. It’s a small building with a few people outside of it. Once they see the car, they start staring and pointing at it. Draco grips the steering wheel tightly as he parks. When the doors open, they start to shout and squeal.
Harry turned around and vanished into thin air. The only thing he left behind was the strong stench of magma and the crumpled petals of a blood-red rose.
“Yes, see you then,” Draco muttered, mostly to himself.
It sat down at the other end of the table, facing him.
“Kouroi!” Before he knew it, a tan arm slipped around his waist and dragged him into an empty space, away from the main room where everybody was dancing and grinding on each other. He was quickly, but gently, backed against a wall.
tell you not to go there.”
“Ok sir-Harry. And you’re right.”
suspecting Harry before he got killed.” Terry commented, eyeing Harry warily.
Instead of being annoyed, it chuckled and leaned back into its chair.
Draco made his way, speechless, over to the closest row. He plucked a tome off of the first shelf and looked at the title.
Now that he was alone, he could
“You’re beautiful.” Draco blushed. Harry moved down to trail kisses down his neck. Draco gasped when Harry sucked hard at a spot, leaving a red mark behind.
Draco gaped for a moment before rushing to apologize. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry-”
Harry’s eager smile was worth it.
Draco finished chewing his salad before he responded. “It was, well…” he trailed off, trying to find an exact word for it. “Strange.”
happening today, no matter how unpleasant it was.
.” Granger looked at Potter in disgust, who was ignoring her pointedly.
To his annoyance, Granger simply laughed. “Anyway, how is your shift schedule? The admin just changed the number of patients I have in a week, and I’m so annoyed! I’ve complained to them and they aren’t even…”
Draco laughed. “I’m not surprised. Anyways, I’ll see both of you in a few hours!”

After Harry had cleared the table (Draco had offered to help but Harry shooed him away) they both lounged on the couch to watch a movie.
Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy :)
The use of the formal title didn’t escape Harry’s notice. He watched closely as she walked out of the throne room with a careful glint in her rusted copper eyes.
“Told you I could,” Draco smirked, inspecting his nails proudly.
Draco was confused and a little scared.

Harry was right. Xenon
Later that evening, Draco got ready for his date with Cormac. He pulled on a simple black button up with jeans and his Chelsea boots. He grabbed his black overcoat from the rack next to the door.
“Father!” He yelled, seeing his father in a tiny cell, separated from him by a grid of iron bars. His father was very disheveled.
He couldn’t look at Potter, he just couldn’t.
he didn’t say.
The topic of conversation was inevitable, but Harry nonetheless found himself unprepared for just how quickly it arose. George brought it up first.
Enjoy.
“I don’t know,” Draco snapped, “I thought it was her.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, shaking his head, but his lips betrayed him, quirking into a small smile.
He pushed past both Pansy and Draco, plonking down on the front steps. “Alright Harry,” he said, as he pulled on his shoes. The three others watched him with a sort of annoyed concentration. “You should really teach her—”
They still had some air to clear, but the tension was gone. Seeing a man utterly pissed on your doorstep seemed to put a few things into perspective, for both parties involved.
“Mary Shelley was a muggle author, Malfoy, not a witch.”
“What’re you doing?” he asked, brow creasing. Draco rolled his eyes. He didn’t answer Harry, holding out his hand.
“I—no,” he managed, “no.”
“I know you’ve been wanting more time to spend with Miss Weasley, especially your Godson.” He held up a hand. “Don’t try to deny it, I know you work too hard to say anything. This will provide an excellent opportunity for you to take some time away, treat yourself.”
Harry gently placed his hand upon Malfoy’s shoulder. “Ok,” he said, “you know I’ll keep you safe.”
care about Malfoy. It was Malfoy. Why should he care? Harry had testified on Malfoy’s behalf sure, but it was just because of Harry’s debt to Narcissa. Was…was Kingsley looking at him funny? Harry had always felt an obligation to help people but, come on. Hadn’t he given enough?  He played with his collar: did someone turn up the temperature? No. Harry didn’t care about Malfoy. He despised the man. Why on Earth did Kingsley think he’d help him?
For a mix of noble and selfish reasons, he would try to make it work with Ginny. Maybe this weekend with her family might just be enough to rekindle their stagnant romance. Harry very much doubted that it would, but he’d always hoped, and he always would.
“I…I suppose I’m sorry. I always thought you liked the attention.” Potter’s head whipped around to look at Draco. He didn’t seem angry, but there was a determination flickering across his expression.
Malfoy raised a brow. He looked like he was about to retort but he instead reached for the teapot in the centre of the table. Removing the cosy, he grabbed Harry’s cup, pouring the contents inside.
“Charmed?” Harry asked, fluttering his eyelashes.
Potter paused for a moment. “You have?” he asked. Draco almost stopped in his tracks. He hadn’t. Not really. He may have had a rather large, abominable crush on Potter, but he didn’t miss his company. They always fought, Draco just felt resentment, fuelled by years of rejection.
That was the last straw.
Hermione was still for a moment, before shaking her head. “I saw the way they treated him, at the manor.” She shivered. Harry didn’t think it had anything to do with the cold. “It doesn’t excuse what he did, but he’s not beyond forgiveness. Especially not if you say he’s changed. Do you think you could become friends?”
“Oh, Alex…” he heard Potter pretend to moan from somewhere nearby, followed by a fit of snickering.
He looked to the ceiling, running his hands over his face.
Draco Malfoy paced the small room of his study, hands flitting about his sides. He’d thought about wearing his best suit today but decided that perhaps it might be a little too flamboyant since Potter was only escorting him to work. He’d settled on one that was dark green, almost black, instead. He hoped Potter looked at least a little presentable. He’d forgotten to mention what exactly he expected him to wear.
She pulled away from him, trying a small smile. “I understand, and I don’t hate you, either,” she said, “though I’m still angry at you, for apparating drunk.”
“I’m flattered,” Draco said, “truly.”
“Without question,” Draco said, “I mean, that is, yes. Yes, you can stay.”
“Stop doing that, you’ll damage the table.”
Harry looked up to find Draco gaping at him like a gasping fish.
“Oh, Harry,” Ginny took his hand with a squeeze, “I should’ve said something sooner, when I first realised, it’s just I—”
Draco was actually quite certain he would, but he didn’t plan on telling Harry that. “I’m sure.” He watched as Harry tossed more ingredients into his pot, still stirring as he did so. Draco wondered aloud, “Where did you learn to cook?”
Harry bristled. “They told me you needed protecting.” He didn’t try to hide his anger. “What could the wonderful Draco Malfoy possibly face that was too much for him to handle?”
“Inhumanly perfect?”
“Here,” Harry said, passing him the spoon, “you stir that around and I’ll just finish with the ham.”
Draco swallowed. “Oh?” he asked. He’d forgotten he’d pinned it up on the board as a kick-starter. He hoped it had made him sound at least slightly intelligent. “Did you understand any of it?”
“That’s not how you use that word.”
“My Father was obsessed with pure-blood lineage,” Draco corrected without emotion, “I was merely an insecure brat and my obsession was with pleasing him.”
“Get out of my house Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was a whisper, and he was staring directly ahead of him at the wall.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Hmm, yes, it’s uh…it’s supposed to calm you down, promotes lethargy.”
Before he had time to respond, Harry was swept into the arms of Molly Weasley who gushed over the arrival of her daughter and her partner. Her cheeks were rosy from the heat of baking, and she squeezed Harry with such ferocity that he was mildly afraid he’d crack.
Potter shrugged, shoving his hand into Draco’s. Potter’s palm was warm, calloused, intertwining snuggly with Draco’s. It felt nice, to have human contact again, even if it were Harry Potter of all people. Without fully comprehending what he was doing, Draco brushed his thumb across Potter’s smooth knuckles. He heard Potter hitch a breath and snapped to his senses, as if struck. He coughed lightly, feeling his own cheeks grow warm.
For all he knew, Malfoy could be trying to poison him.
Harry groaned, pressing his face against his hands. “You are
He had to get a hold of himself. It was bad enough back at the mansion. He had more imminent issues, he refused to say important, to deal with.
Harry shrugged, smiled, nodded. “Though,” he said, “I’m still not sure why you did challenge Buckbeak?”
“You testified on his behalf.”
He remembered the way he’d died in the woods and thought maybe, perhaps a part of him still was.
“Auror Potter,” he sighed, “we wouldn’t ask you if we didn’t have to.” He looked up at the ceiling. “Believe you me.”
“I didn’t find anything.” Harry couldn’t meet Malfoy’s eyes.
“Come on. Aurors will be here soon, and they’ll ask questions.”
He expected the facade to drop, for Malfoy to draw back, stern and cold as Harry had always known him.
“By killing her son?”
Harry wanted to protest, but he knew it was true. If he was lucky, his own body would be left alone and not paraded like a war prize. At least Malfoy’s body would be sheltered here in the hut away from searching eyes and the elements.
Hermione merely pursed her lips, evidently holding back what he wanted to say.
Harry waited, watching carefully as all Malfoy did was breathe and stare, but not beg. He didn’t beg. He didn’t even open his mouth, instead simply staring him down, grey eyes meeting Harry’s and not looking away. He breathed heavily, chest heaving with the desperate grasp for oxygen, but otherwise did not move.
He wished he’d been kinder to Draco in his last moments. None of that crap that happened in the previous years mattered. Harry forgave him.
He didn’t even hear Draco’s body hit the ground.
Harry flinched, but Hermione stepped over Draco’s arm and grabbed Ron by the shirt, yanking him down to face her eye to eye.
It really shouldn’t be a shock to him, but considering how Draco had been raised, he hadn’t realised they were capable of it. Maybe Narcissa was as much as prisoner to the system as Draco had been. Trapped into a marriage for duty, birthing a son for duty.
He leant over Draco and turned off the alarm, tying desperately not to touch his cold skin. His fingers felt fat and useless as he felt around the small buttons on Draco’s frail wrist. He felt only a small second of relief when the beeping cut off. He leant back, and sat in the silence. He swallowed, closing his eyes and allowed himself another moment with Draco. He opened his eyes, wiped the tears from his eyes and moved to stand.
In the back of his head, the constant ringing. He hadn’t realised, so wrapped up in the anger and the fear the last few days. He’d been too busy fighting off Voldemort in his head, worrying about his friends. He hadn’t heard it.
Harry knew how strong a mother’s love was. It was the reason he was still alive.
At least Voldemort wouldn’t realise what he’d done until it was too late. Because by killing Harry, he was also dooming himself.
He sounded mildly hurried, like a frazzled mother trying to get her children to stop pestering her for sweets at the check out at the shops. Annoying and wanting it to be over with.
Something started beeping a moment later, and it stunned Harry into sitting up. He looked around with his wand held tightly, suddenly realising his vulnerable position mourning over a dead body. Only then did he realise it was only Draco’s watch on his limp wrist, beeping with an alarm. It made him feel horrible, because Draco had timed it; kept track of the hour, to make sure Harry killed him in time.
Or at least he tried. Just as the door closed behind him, he cast one long look at Draco’s body.
“I wish I had given him the stone. It might have saved him.”
He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t.
He stood, unsure of what else to do. His legs were flat and his arms where on his stomach, head rested back on the soft soil. Harry’s hands fidgeted for a moment, restless and increasingly anxious. What else could do? Was there something else he should be doing? He didn’t know how to bury someone. The only experience he had was Dobby, and Dobby wasn’t a fully grown wizard.
“Don’t pretend you liked him, Hermione.” Ron snarled, using his other hand to rip down the sleeve over Hermione’s arm, exposing the scar. “You remember what they did to you.”
And now that he could see it, he was astounded that Lucius Malfoy hadn’t seen it himself. That he still threw loyalty at the man that had ruined his family and was complacent in the destruction of his son.
“All the Malfoy’s have ever known was sacrifice.” Malfoy whispered, like he was worried about being overheard. His hands gripped his knees in a white knuckled grip, still trembling. His mark was on show, striking on his white skin.
“I’m sorry, Draco. Thank you for your sacrifice.”
Harry watched her go, swallowing the exhaustion and fear down. She was already using past tense for her son.
But then beautiful red hair caught his attention in the corner of his eyes, and he couldn’t help but stumble to an abrupt stop, legs shaking and head suddenly so very heavy.
Because Harry had lived, and Draco had not.
Harry looked down to where we was staring at Draco, and was glad he couldn’t see Draco’s eyes
Why was Malfoy acting like this? Why was he trying to goad Harry into killing him? Why was he here? And why was he now laying under Harry, compliant, even now that Harry wasn’t putting any effort into holding him down?
He heard Malfoy shift uncomfortably in his chair behind Harry.
It didn’t.
She just just looked at him with dark eyes, heavy shadow under her eyes. Harry abruptly realised that Narcissa had indeed loved Draco. Really loved him, like Harry knew his own mother had loved him.
It’s never been about blood, only power.
And he wanted it. He wanted it so desperately. He breathed, once, twice.
Malfoy could ask probably ask somebody on Harry’s side of the war to kill him, and they would, no questions asked. Quickly, simply. And Malfoy could have achieved his goal.
After they both died, Voldemort would be weak. He hoped Mcgonagall or somebody else would have the strength to finish it. He hoped beyond all hope that this war would end today with them free. It had to.
And he didn’t recognise what he saw there.
And Harry realised how absurd that it was, that Malfoy was here with him and Voldemort didn’t know about it.
He left the tiny hut without looking back.
“We’ll rotate so we can take breaks, Harry. Sit down for a few minutes.”
Nobody would care.
He quickly placed Draco at the bottom of the grave, the soil moist and cold where it brushed his bare skin. It wasn’t nice, but at least it was soft. They had no coffin for Draco, only a lonely hole and a bed of dirt.
They all just stood there for a moment, staring down the body.
“Call me by my name.”
Suddenly Harry understood him more than he ever wanted to. He didn’t want to. He didn’t want to. Because Harry didn’t want to understand him, or think of him as anything other than his school bully. Harry didn’t want to think that Malfoy was just like him.
Colin Creevey.
Because Harry was a Horcrux.
“Thank you.” She said quietly, but it felt as though she’d screamed in his ears with how it felt like a wave hitting him in the side.
“Leaky,” Ginny said, “with friends.”
“Oh Blaise, that would be unfair,” Pansy said, “we all know you’d win as soon as the name ‘Malfoy’ was even mentioned.”
Fuck.
“I have to admit,” a voice drawled from behind, “I never expected to see the chosen one hiding behind a coffee mug.” Harry scowled. Malfoy. What was he doing here?
“Leaving,” Draco interrupted, “they were leaving.”
The first sip tingled on his lips but the moment he swallowed, his whole body was filled by a warmth he’d never felt before. “Woah,” he breathed.
“Hey,” Potter said, crouching down to place his hands on Draco’s knees, “I think maybe we should call in early today.”
Few things to say for this chapter :D
He looked up to meet Potter’s furrowed brow and pursed lips. Draco rolled his eyes, massaging his temples.
“In person.” Harry stared.
“Malfoy…” Harry was propped up on his elbows, staring at Draco, sprawled across from him on the floor. Draco scrambled to his feet turning away from Potter and walking briskly towards the reception desk. He was done for today.
“Me?”
Harry didn’t have to ask what she meant by ‘this.’
Harry was itching to see Draco again, so he was practically buzzing when he knocked on the manor door. It opened abruptly, an impeccably dressed Draco greeting him at the door. Draco’s eyes widened and he smoothed down his hair, as if there was a single strand out of place.
He thought of who he was now, of how he was ashamed to own the Malfoy name, and how he couldn’t face the shame of his friends too.
Harry bit his tongue to stop himself saying. "Finally," he said instead, "something the great Draco Malfoy admits he doesn't know."
Draco felt his own lips quirk into a small smile. “It certainly added character,” he agreed.
Malfoy smirked. “Good?”
“I haven’t pushed you away,” Harry said quietly.
“Just…they didn’t really get the whole magic thing, you know?” Draco nodded, even though he didn’t know.
“Yeah?”
“Malfoy?” Potter ventured, pausing his reading to squint in the opposite direction to where Draco was standing, “you still here?”
Harry missed Malfoy. He told himself that he didn’t, but a part of him knew that he was lying. It was only two days, but Harry found himself wishing he could go back to that library.
“She’s right.” Draco pushed the letter towards Harry. Harry sighed, running one hand through his tousled hair and taking the letter with the other.
Thanks again for reading!
“You’re calling me prejudiced? You’re the one who—”
And that's all, so without further ado, please enjoy the chapter and let me know what you think!
“Oh, stop sulking Potter,” Malfoy chastised, like he was speaking to a petulant child in the middle of a meltdown, “you weren’t my first choice either.”
“Under the stairs.” His voice was quiet now and he looked at the floor. “I didn’t even have a proper Birthday until I was eleven, and that was only thanks to Hagrid. Plus, Dudley ate the cake he’d brought me.”
“I’d always assumed…”
Ok so, the wand throwing deleted scene from the Battle of Hogwarts is not strictly canon but I just kind of really wished it was? Let me know what you thought and stay safe :)
“I was famous,” he said slowly, “because my parents were killed. Despite what everyone seemed to think, it wasn’t exactly my proudest achievement.” He tried a wan smile, but it fell flat, the corners of his lips curving downwards.
The house elf nodded, her forehead creased with worry. “Master Draco is dreadfully shaken,” the elf said, “can Keesy ask, what happened with Mr Potter?”
“Coffee,” Harry said, without really thinking. “Would be lovely, thanks,” he added hastily.
Harry’s heart ached and he bundled the child into his arms, letting him sob against his chest. This was new to Harry, sure, but he would help, and support, in any way he could. Teddy mumbled something Harry couldn’t quite make out.
Draco nodded. “Yes.”
“What is it Potter?” Malfoy’s tone was full of disdain, but it wavered slightly, and his cheeks were dusted pink.
Malfoy glared, hands steepled against his lower lip. “No, I hired you to be an irritating git.”
Draco didn’t allow himself the luxury of imagining that Potter looked disappointed.
“Malfoy—”
Pansy. Blaise. Keesey. His own Mother. Merlin, too many.
“Merlin knows why,” Draco said, “you’re hardly qualified.”
How he’d felt when he was with Malfoy…it was nothing. He was supposed to hate Malfoy for Merlin’s sake! He really had changed, however, Harry had meant that, and Harry had never been a very good liar. He knew he didn’t hate Malfoy, couldn’t. He sighed, leaning back against the couch. He needed to pull himself together. Especially before he saw Malfoy again. He couldn’t be like this in front of him on Wednesday. Especially not after Malfoy’s horrified reaction, the last time they’d met and gotten close.
“She has a name Potter.” Harry was beginning to feel frustrated. Draco knew what he meant, he was just being obnoxiously defensive. So, what if Harry was surprised by Malfoy’s change of heart? Harry narrowed his eyes at Malfoy.
“I was!” His green eyes were imploringly wide. “I’ve just never worked in a library before,” he threw his arms up, “so sue me.”
Harry had expected this really. She always seemed to go out. “Where to?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What about your other house-elves? Why did they leave?”
Sorry for the wait! Please do let me know what you think so far. Stay safe :)
“Yeah,” he said as Hermione sat down beside him, “it’s peaceful.”
“Harry!” Arthur chipped in. “I’ve been meaning to ask, I’ve seen muggles with these nozzle type contraptions, blowing air into their faces. Do you use those for your hair, and if so, might I borrow one?”
“Oscar Wilde was not a bloody wizard!”
Harry shrugged. “Trying to find…a stamp?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know, I will. I just—”
Harry smiled at him, her. His Goddaughter. He ruffled Teddy’s hair. “’Course it’s ok, Ted.” Harry paused, “is, Teddy ok?”
Harry’s own fingers were wrapped around Draco’s wrist. He stared, dazed, lips parted, eyes wide behind his glasses. Slowly, he smoothed his fingers along Draco’s arm, until their fingertips rested palm to palm. Draco could only watch as Harry twisted his hand, fingers curling to slot between Draco’s.
In pureblood households, the manifestation of magic was supposed to be a significant time in a child’s lifetime, something to be celebrated. Lucius had simply dragged Draco back to the house, imploring his son not to speak of what had just happened.
“Of course, he missed you!” she exclaimed, her bushy hair blocking Harry’s view as he squeezed her back. “We all have.”
“No,” Potter said, grinning, “you just snitched.”
Harry shrugged, doing his best to pretend that the prospect didn’t excite him. “I don’t know. Maybe.”
“Blaise, darling,” Pansy called behind her, “come and see who just knocked on the door.” She turned back to Harry, sporting that disarming smile of hers. “Sorry Potter, we were just—”
Harry exploded.
Harry turned to look at her and the surprise must have registered in his expression because Hermione recoiled, her eyes wide.
“Well, it clearly isn’t nothing, you’re laughing, tell me.”
Harry’s fingers tingled but he couldn’t give Malfoy the satisfaction. “It’s alright,” he forced himself to say.
Harry leant back, folding his arms. “So, you weren’t just trying to get Hagrid fired?”
Every nerve was on fire, static ringing in his ears. How was he supposed to cope with this ridiculous man, grinning at him from across the table? He should fire him, that’s what he should do.
Draco was sulking, he’d readily admit that, slouched across the table with his chin on his elbows. “It was pathetic.”
Draco sipped from his mug, resuming his reading at the same time. Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the short interaction he’d just witnessed. There was respect between Malfoy and his house-elf. He remembered the way Draco used to treat people he considered to be beneath him, let alone house-elves.
“I said there’s no one else.” Harry nodded slowly.
“What?”
He wondered how Draco felt inside the manor, alone in its shadowed halls. He wondered if Draco’s thank you had more than one meaning.
“Bloody miracle, that’s what it is,” Ron scoffed, shoving almost an entire bread roll into his mouth.
Draco stared at him. The boy who lived. The boy he loved, always. “Yeah,” he said, cleared his throat, “yes. I’d like that.”
“Keesy thought that Master Draco had work today?”
“I read your review,” Potter said after a while, “the one on Frankenstein.”
“Hnng?”
Malfoy’s knees buckled and he looked ready to collapse. Harry caught him with one hand under his arm when Malfoy could stand no longer.
“Forget it. It’s fine.” Malfoy snatched the papers out of Harry’s hands, a faint blush creeping over his pale cheeks.
Draco’s face fell and he slapped a hand against his forehead. Though, he peeked between his fingers to see Harry’s flushed face and he tried a shy smile instead.
“Oh, shove off Malfoy,” Harry said, standing to his feet and brushing himself off, “nobody’s brilliant at everything.”
“Wizards.” Her lips curled up into a smirk and Draco felt a sudden chill scrape its way down his back. He swallowed.
“And clean.” Potter nodded. “I slept in a cupboard.”
does it still hurt?”
Draco had him.
“You know,” Harry said, pointing to the hallway, “home.”
Potter shrugged. “There were some close calls,” he said.
“What?”
“Harry.” Ginny’s voice startled him. “I didn’t think you’d be back so soon.”
Despite himself, Draco grinned, “is that a compliment I hear?”
going to your office right? You’re not just bringing me out here to quietly kill me?”
He’d told himself he wouldn’t think about it, but then, he couldn’t not think about it. His relationship with Ginny had collapsed, he was risking losing her, and he couldn’t have that happen again. Not with Draco. If he could build a friendship with Malfoy and keep it alive forever, well, he’d choose that over anything more and potentially losing him forever.
To anyone else, their comments would seem cruel, but this is what they’d become: fleeting touches and allusive banter.
He was on his feet in a flash, tendrils of his magic erupting from his rage. “I may have a scar Malfoy, but you’re the one with the dark mark on your wrist!” In his anger, Harry felt triumphant as Draco’s features turned incredibly pale. “Tell me,
Harry was sure that he would die of self-combustion.
Draco flashes Harry a smug grin, and Harry feels his face heat up. Even with his tan skin, he knows it will probably show up on his face. Fuck.
Once he finished, he ran a hand through his messy curls and deemed himself fit for the night.
"That's your favorite?" Harry asks, aghast.
Draco sighed and leaned back into Harry.
“No, you aren’t injured.” The wardrobe huffed. Draco noticed that it had a distinctly feminine voice.
Well, Harry's silent at least. Draco keeps commenting about the characters.
Harry staggered, clutching at the hilt of the sword disbelievingly. With a final burst of anger, he drew back his fist and punched Cedric as hard as he could. He heard his skull crack, but he was too distracted to think about that.
“What are you doing?”
Draco brought out his little notepad again, which made Harry smile.
“Excuse me?” The Prince asked, confused. The lady simply smirked.
Lucius cautiously made his way to the table. The food was still hot, and the smell of it made him moan in delight and anticipation.
“That wasn’t a no?”
“Father’s in trouble. I need to go find him. I’ll ask Mr. Dumbledore to stay with you for the time being.”
BabyBots to WaiterBots to even ErotiBots. Draco
, you mutt!”
under the multicolored lights coming from above. His long hair wasn’t in any braids this time, and his loose blonde locks framed his face like a gold picture frame. His lips were rouged, his skin was smooth and supple, and his lovely, shaped calves were wrapped in his white sandals. He was
out loud. He's too blissed out to care, though. The soup is just rich enough, with the tomatoey goodness and the spices and
Of course, it also helped that he was buck naked.
“Piss off,” Draco muttered, turning away from it and looking at the book in his hands instead.
“Yes?” Draco asked. For some odd reason, he thought he heard a growl come from where Harry was standing.
Draco was led into Mr. Dumbledore’s office. It was rather odd, with sculptures of mythical creatures about and paintings all around. It was just like Mr. Dumbledore himself, Draco mused. Odd, but comforting.
“Do relax. It’s just the food.” The beast said, amused. Draco glared at it.
He would have to deal with
“Anyways, let’s go Harry. I’ve gotten all my books.” Hermione said, adjusting the tower of books in her arms. Harry was seriously questioning how in the world she managed to balance them all.
“Say it back.”
“It’s alright. I’m already used to it, ok? Don’t feel guilty.”
Draco shuddered to himself in disgust.
Like the day after Draco had been healed enough to stand up, it had explained what it had used to restrain Greyback.
of deities who all lived there at least some of the time, if not always. Draco knew of some gods who only came to Olympus to visit others, or to trade goods. He often wished he could be one of them.
Draco looked conflicted for a moment, before shrugging.
“No, I’ll go. I’d like to get to know you, too.” Draco says firmly. Harry looks surprised for a moment, then smiles.
The memory of the incident makes Draco smile a little. Harry isn’t bad. He wonders inwardly how he had even agreed to having a roommate. His mother could be such a pest a times.
“Who knows? But once you try their butter beer, you’ll never criticize them again.”
“Harry. Not Mr. Potter. Harry. And please take a seat.”
His horns were
Harry’s smiling face remained still. Draco let out a large gasp and started to sob.
Avoiding the curved ram horns on his head was hard enough on its own, but the tangled mass that was Harry’s hair was
For once, he understood what his mother was so worried about.
“They’d eat a novice like you for breakfast. Especially
After showing his ID to them and swiping his card into the small device next to the door, Draco found himself sitting across from Potter, who was lying on a velvet chaise lounge (Draco snorted at that. Terribly cliche). His arms and legs were bound by some sort of thick metal restraints that made Draco feel slightly safer.
“No coming yet, love.” Draco groaned, but still pushed his arse into Harry’s face desperately.
Harry growled and lunged at the man, who nimbly dodged him and slashed Harry’s shoulder.
“No worries. I can teach you.”
The sneaky little bugger was starting without him.
“Please don’t kill her,” he muttered into Harry’s collar. “
“Who was that?” Harry asked.
.” Draco gasped, looking up at Harry disbelievingly.
“You have a Ferrari?!”
Draco smiled to himself as he stroked the wings of a butterfly that had landed on his hair. Its wings were black and red, and they looked magnificent. Its antennae bobbed happily as he rubbed its head affectionately. It was very warm, for some reason, but he didn’t mind.
“Draco? Are you listening?” Draco snapped out of his thoughts as he remembered that Granger had asked him a question before. Right.
Draco rolled his eyes from where he was seated on Harry’s lap. “I don’t know how many times I have to tell you idiots, but Harry is
“That’s brilliant!” Harry grinned. The bed jostled when he bounced a bit.
“Harry, what are you doing?” Draco asked slowly, not wanting to provoke Harry. Even though he wasn’t scared for some reason, he still wanted to be careful.
Harry led him up the grand staircase and into their new master bedroom. There was a large bed placed in the middle of the wall, with rose petals placed sporadically on the white sheets and a thin white robe lying in the middle. A sheer white curtain hung from the top of the frame, partially veiling the bed.
“Yeah!” Harry smiled, looking pleased that Draco remembered him.
“Another one?” Draco frowned. Harry nodded.
“Obviously.” Draco looked up and saw that she had eyes and a mouth carved into it on the top of the dresser.
“As long as it’s as good as you say.”
“Don’t come yet, love.” Draco let out an anguished sob that sent sharp prickles of pleasure straight to Harry’s cock.
Hermione paused for a moment, licking her lips. “At first, he was just curious about the whole place, you know. And I don’t blame him–Azkaban Asylum is a very infamous place. I would be interested in it too.”
Harry snorted. “You should be telling that to Dionysus, not me.” He looked pointedly at Dionysus, who was holding at least six glasses of wine in his hands. He already looked drunk, even though it hadn’t even been up to three hours since the party had started.
Draco smiled and handed the bouquet to Harry, their fingers brushing gently.
” his mother sighed. She smiled softly and loosened her grip on his arm.
(he mentally cursed Aphrodite again), but so what? How
Harry sniffed and silently let the tears come out until he was finished. He raised up his head, wincing at the sudden dizziness. His eyes were rimmed red, and there were droplets of water on the day-old stubble on his chin.
Draco scowled when he caught himself standing and made his way back to his office with quite a lot on his mind.
Draco sucked in a gasp. The Potters were more or less the top of the food chain. They owned the
Despite this, people still looked down on him and called him a Death Eater, which was most likely the reason why he was working in such a lowly job.
Harry gulps and instantly saves the picture onto his phone. Thankfully, it doesn’t show up in the chat room and Harry quickly sends out a quick thanks to whatever gods are out there.
“Such a little slut.” Before Draco could react, he landed two more sharp spanks onto the round swell of his arse. Draco whined and gasped as more hand prints formed on his arse.
. The roses were a bright, cheery red and the bego-whatever were pale and delicate and a bright yellow. Each petal had a gold filigree on the edges, and they looked beautiful.
By now, Draco had stopped struggling and had resorted to pleading Harry with his beautiful silver eyes, from which the most innocent tears were spilling out of. The picture the blond created was purely
Also, I know I'm switching tenses between chapters but honestly I'm too lazy to fix them. This story is mainly for experimenting so I'm not really concerned about things like that.
He hoisted his father up and helped him limp over to and climb onto the horse. With a kick to its behind, the horse started to gallop off into the night.
Harry shrugged. “Just wanted to. The people at my school are posh prats, and I want to talk to someone who I didn’t know.”
Twenty minutes later, he arrived there. He sent Dobby away with a wave and an extra tip (Father never paid him much). He took a deep breath and stepped into the Starbucks. It wasn’t that crowded, but he couldn’t spot TheGoldenSnitch (calling him that in real life was weird; his real name was Harry but Draco wasn’t used to saying that) anywhere. He shrugged and went up to the cashier to order his coffee instead. As usual, he got a Mocha Cookie Crumble Frappuchino and two chocolate chip cookies. It was the best kind of coffee in existence; whoever had come up with the idea to mix an Oreo milkshake with chocolate and espresso was a pure genius.
“Draco, no! Please don’t!” He begged.
“Let me go, you
“Why are you so eager to accuse people, Zach? If you ask me,
Once Draco arrived at the village, he got down and started rushing his father to the hospital, ignoring the stares and the whispers from everybody. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t experienced it every day when things were still normal.
“So, you chose to
He looked around at the dark room until his eyes land on an entrance out of the room that certainly hadn’t been there before, covered by several thin, translucent curtains.
“You have to leave again?”
“Really?” Draco asked, excitedly. When his father nodded, Draco went up to him to hug him tightly.
“Fuck, shut up shut up! You’re just making it worse.” He says on a loud moan.
to make him pancakes.” I feel the flush creep up my face as I finish the last bit.
And cue the guilt. Fuck, but I look back at my adolescent self and can’t help but loathe him. So proud, and selfish I was. Harry is constantly reminding me that I couldn’t really help it at the time because I was essentially conditioned to behave that way.  I can’t help but feel that this is a cop out, However, I love him for seeing the good in me, not that I’ve told him as much. Salazar this relationship is still so tentative I’d probably scare him off If I had. I shake my head in an attempt to clear the spiraling thoughts. It wouldn’t do to go fucking up his birthday with my self deprecating nonsense.
Kreacher looks irritated and insists, “Young Master Malfoy must learn patience, pancakes are only cooked on the top side, not the bottom side.”
The sight of Harry Potter on his knees, with his face less than a metre from my cock, might possibly supersede any other vision I’ve encountered in my relatively short life. His beautiful green eyes staring up at me through dark lashes, a coy, playful grin on his face, it nearly suffocates me with desire. But then, the grin fades into a guilt ridden, sullen expression. At first I’m nonplussed as to what’s caused the drastic change in demeanor, however seeing where his gaze has landed answers the question before it leaves my mouth.
All of this, coupled with the stubble leaving the most delicious friction burn, never fails to turn me into a babbling mess. It’s gotten to the point where I’m scrabbling around for purchase attempting to regain control of the situation because fuck him for distracting me from my fucking task!
He rolls his eyes and smirks  at me  before saying quite matter-of-factly, “It’s my birthday, I get to do what I want, and I want to fuck you into the mattress.”
“A gift eh? Pretty sure I was thoroughly enjoying myself until
so rudely interrupted
“I can’t help but feel that I’m going to constantly disappoint you.” I blurt out unexpectedly.
and find myself wrapped in those strong arms I’ve reluctantly come to adore. I use every ounce of energy reserve to lift my head and look him in the eyes yet again.  It’s incredible how every time I’m overwhelmed at the bright green gaze looking back at me with anything other than disdain. It takes my breath away, so I simply offer a sheepish smile, completely out of character I admit, but he seems to eat it up nonetheless.
We eat in companionable silence until Harry starts, “I gotta be honest Draco, those were incredible, but how did you know that I prefer muggle whipped cream? The more I think about it, the odder it seems. I’ve never had whipped cream in your presence before, nor do you shop at muggle food markets.”
Deciding to do just that as an introduction to the birthday celebrations I’ve planned, I try to slowly dip beneath the covers and without waking him, settle myself between his legs.  I’m fortunate that he is sleeping on his back, although getting into position without waking him is proving to be a challenge. I try to climb over his left leg but he shifts and bends his knee toward me basically preventing anything or anyone accessing the desired area. I let out a huff of frustration and consider what else I could do.
Finally, I feel the telltale vice like grip of his orgasm trigger, and watch as streaks of come fly out of his cock and land on my chest.  I try to ride it out, but the rhythmic clenching on my cock tips me over, and I’m spilling inside him mere seconds after the first drop of his come splashes  near my chin.
I let out a huff of exasperation, “Yes you and your bloody inarticulate tendencies are apparently starting to rub off on me.” He simply smirks at that, he knows that I resort to petty insults as a deflection tactic. Snake hiding in a lion’s body I swear to Merlin.
I heave a heavy sigh and try again, “No Kreacher, I wish to make Harry breakfast on his birthday and I don’t know how. I would like for you to instruct me on how to make pancakes, but I wish to make them myself.”
The look he grants me in return is one I won’t soon forget. He looks at me as though I am precious, as though I mean the absolute world to him and it leaves my throat feeling as arid as the Sahara. He moves upward minutely and grasps onto my cock. The sudden shift is so unexpected that it elicits a moan and inadvertently causes me to avert my gaze toward the ceiling.
I roll my eyes at that, “No boyfriend of mine has ever been called mediocre Potter. I get the point you’re trying to make but seriously?! You’re far from mediocre and to say such things implies I have terrible taste, which I clearly do not.” He laughs outright as tears stream down his face again. I strengthen my resolve and ask the question I’m dying to know the answer to,  “How can you be so willing to throw away everything you’ve ever wanted just to be with me?
Kreacher appears in the middle of my kitchen, and I have never in my life been more elated to see the cantankerous creature.
He sits up abruptly and gapes at me incredulously, “You made me pancakes, like...ACTUAL edible pancakes?” I thought you were in the shower all this time?!”
“Young Master Malfoy wants to cook for Master Harry?”
He simply smiles again as he replies, “Don’t you think I worry about the same thing in regards to you?! Have you met you? You are insanely hard to please. I’m constantly afraid that If I wear the wrong pants you’ll be disappointed.” He chuckles,  “You can’t live your life in fear forever Draco, happiness comes with a little bit of risk. You simply have to find the person for whom the risk is worth taking.”
He runs his hands lower over my shoulders, and trails them down my arms. I submit to the sensations completely closing my eyes and tilting my head back to grant him more access to my neck. I feel his hands everywhere, my arms, my chest, my ankles, my thighs and I can’t suppress the breathy moan that escapes my lips.
He starts mouthing at my jaw, which he fucking knows drives me mental. “So fucking gorgeous,” he murmurs into my neck as he not so subtly grinds his hips into mine. I can’t suppress a shiver and a wrecked moan when our cocks come into contact. He smirks and does it again of course, the wanker. Leave it to Harry fucking Potter to circumvent receiving a birthday blowjob. I muster up every ounce of control I have left, and slide down his body underneath him and begin working him over yet again. This time, I grab onto his thighs in an effort to prevent him from moving, and he appears to capitulate because his arms start to tremble from the effort of maintaining the position.
Utterly flabbergasted, I turn my shocked expression back to look at him, “I…”
We’re not at the Manor, so I can’t ask a house elf. My flat isn’t large enough to warrant hiring one myself. Ugh why did I insist we stay at my flat instead of Grimmauld place? At least there we have… “Kreacher!” I whisper a call, hoping beyond all hope that he can hear me due to my Black heritage. With an audible
“Proper or not, this is what I want to do so will you help me?”
I can’t help but grin back, but I reply “it was until you so rudely interrupted me.”
Anger begins to surface now he’s stopped moving, “What they actual fuck Potter? Reckless bloody Gryffindor, did you even prepare yourself?! Merlin and Morgana who decides to impale themselves the first time as a bottom are you fucking mental?!” The last part comes out as a squeak because he deliberately clenches around me in an effort to cut me off.
Another whine, “Draco, I need… My cock…”
“Cheeky, feeling territorial this fine morning?”
“Young Master Malfoy summoned Kreacher, is Master Harry being in trouble?” The elf asked in his croaky bullfrog voice.
“You going to come for me Harry? You going to come on my cock?”
“Oh don’t look like that,” he says between gales of laughter, “I can’t stop picturing you wearing nothing but an apron, flipping pancakes while my come runs down your leg.”
It’s rare that I’m at a loss for words but I truly have no idea what I should say back. I decide to bring him back to the present, both literally and figuratively. “Alright you great sap, perhaps you should continue opening your gift, hmm? No use wasting perfectly healthy elections because of your Gryffindor tendency toward nobility. Suck it up, and suck me off you wanker” I say with a playful smirk.
I begin eating my own stack of pancakes, I notice Kreacher put fresh berries on mine to better suit my tastes. I smile to myself, perhaps I’ll send Kreacher a gift for helping me out today. I wouldn’t have been able to make Harry smile like that on my own.
He hastens to lick up the cream this time, and my thighs tremble as they are bound to the chair and bidden to receive the onslaught.  On the last lick to my left thigh I jerk uncontrollably, causing him to laugh throatily. “Eager are we? Where shall I devote my attention to next hmm?” He asks with a wry grin.
“I, no one has ever called me that before. I never thought…” and fuck my traitorous lacrimal ducts are filling rapidly, and my chest is constricting as I try with all my might to prevent the unbidden tears from giving me away completely. I feel exposed and angry at myself for letting the tears come.
He chuckles again, “No, you’re just too stubborn to admit that Gryffindor colors suit you you wanker. I can even admit to enjoying the sight of you with a bright red ribbon on your head. Although that may be due to the fact that you’re completely at my mercy as opposed to the actual binding material.” He adds in a throaty whisper against my neck.
It takes everything in me not to slap it right off his face. “You better eat every bite Potter, Salazar help you if you don’t.”
Turning my attention back to Harry, I can’t help mirroring his infectious grin as he pours maple syrup and uses the absurd can to twist a huge dollop of cream on top of his stack. I’ve also noticed that Harry insists on adding an abundance of things he really enjoys to his plate. It’s as though he fears he will never have it again so he has to get as much as he possibly can while he’s able. Again, this nauseates me, because it is a clear indication that at some point he was food insecure.
Panting and with blurred vision, I begin mumbling unintelligibly, “Barking. Absolutely mental. No warning. Bloody wanker. He’ll be the death of me.”
Well fuck, cut right to the fucking heart of my insecurity why doesn’t he, wanker. I don’t really have a response to that because he seems to already have figured it out. I simply shrug and lift my chin in a defiant manner, silently daring him to contradict me.
Once the butter is melted, Kreacher demonstrates how to measure out the proper amount of what he termed “batter” into the hot pan. I repeat the procedure twice until there are three circular, bland, blobs in the pan. Kreacher doesn’t give me any further instructions for a while, and I’m starting to get nervous that they’re going to burn, but once I notice the entire surface of each of the blobs covered in small visible bubbles, I hear Kreacher croak, “Kreacher must flip the pancakes now Master Draco,” while he beckons silently for the SPA-TOOLA thing in my hand.
I turn my gaze to the floor because I can’t see the disappointment  there. I've seen it for most of my life and I can’t handle seeing disappointment from him, not anymore. He seems to silently mull it over for a few moments, but I refuse to look him in the eye. Suddenly he’s on his knees on the floor to my left and taking both of my hands in his. I still won’t meet his eyes so he lifts our joined hands and turns my face gently in his direction until grey eyes meet green.
He seems to understand the direction my thoughts are spiraling because rather than continue angrily, he walks forward and kneels in front of me, and takes my hands in his again.  “You’re under the false impression that I don’t know you Draco.  You think that I don’t see you, but I do. I see a man that despite making poor life choices as an adolescent, he learned from his mistakes and is stronger for it.  I see a man that is loyal and will do anything in his power to protect the people he loves. I see a man that found strength enough to take his worst life experiences and turn it so far around that he’s actually attended muggle university for four years in an effort to distance himself from the stigma forced upon him as a child.”
