Remus thought his heart would surely stop if he didn't get some answers soon. Of all the questions, Harry had to go and ask one that denied his own identity at the same time…
As a trio, they made an early start for the wizarding gallery that held a large collection of Dean's work. Arthur stopped by the front and joined a workshop led by Dean - something about sentient subjects - while Alec went with Dad to check out the exhibits. He meant to pay more attention, meant to - what was the word? -
Lenny, the clingy berk, is gone for the foreseeable future and Harry is celebrating with tea and friends. He's a decent host - he pours for Hermione and she doesn't seem to mind that it's just hot water from the sink. Ron seems more interested in the Muggle Pop-Tarts than the tea and Harry tells him all he knows about preservatives and shelf life and -
Harry actually felt faint for a moment, like all his blood was rushing at once to his cheeks and ears, then his chest, then his fingers.
that this James Charming was actually Harry Potter, there was no doubt. But he had a feeling that pushing this on him too firmly would get McGonagall and himself chucked out on their arses.
"Yes, well." Draco sniffed imperiously. "I hate to leave you to all the heroics, is all. Goes straight to your head."
Over the weeks, he'd changed his schedule at St. Mungo's to take Mondays and Tuesdays off instead of the weekend. It lined up better that way so he and James could spend all of Monday together - playing chess, exploring parks, visiting museums, even catching a Quidditch game or two - and he could either have Tuesday to himself or help James with the mail-orders.
"Not just about your life this time, James," Monty argued, still avoiding his eye, still stirring that blasted soup. "Alec an' Arty deserve a chance tae be a part of that world if they want tae, an' they
Harry acts out against Draco and Viktor, which lands him in a spot of trouble with the wrong side of HR. He escapes, only to stumble upon a mystery in the warehouse behind Voldecorp ™ .
"So did it work?" he asked, patting the wrinkled head of the hairless cat that was going to town on the can of food in his wardrobe. Alec didn't look away from the cat and Arthur raised his voice a little. "Al? Did ye get what ye needed earlier? Nearly broke ma leg falling down those stairs..."
Potter opening and closing his mouth, speechless. It only took nineteen years, but Draco had finally done the impossible. He had shut Potter up.
"The final blow?" Arthur asked breathlessly, looking between the photo and his dad with wild eyes. Harry was back to absently tracing patterns on the tabletop, stiff with unease as he listened.
Two young boys stood to the left and slightly behind Potter. Draco didn’t miss how his hand - the one not gripping the cane with white knuckles - came out in front of them protectively as the group was jostled by the crowd. They didn’t look panicked, but rather in awe of what was happening. Draco tried to imagine what it would be like at the epicenter of a Potter-riot. Actually, they looked like they were having fun...
With a long-suffering sigh, Draco walked them through the oscillating process for memory recovery, which was hardly an exact science and left him with a migraine that even St. Mungo's strongest potions hadn't quite shaken. Healer Abbott had already given her statement about her assistance, this was completely unnecessary.
Blaise, rather. It's not about what he does with his bits; that's just the delicious icing on the bedded cake. It's about building the mood. Touching. Once Draco discovered the theory behind erogenous zones, well, the game changed and he found his rhythm.
In total, he wrote three pages detailing his opinion on the taste of each constellation, then tacked on another page waxing philosophic about presentation and shine, and in the name of Circe's left tit how did he manage to ship these in a Muggle box without the ganache freezing through?!
different. Entirely. Potter was a brooding idiot who couldn't dress himself properly outside of the Hogwarts uniform, and Charming - well, Draco couldn't say he was impressed with the Muggle jeans, jumpers, and knit cap, but at least his clothes came close to a proper fit. And the Malfoy family had always appreciated the style potential of a good walking cane.
Blaise's eyes flashed in suspicion and the wand point came back to aim between Draco's perfectly shaped eyebrows.
The inside of the house was...well, dank. Harry supposed that couldn't be helped out here in the barely-tamed wilds of wherever they were, in this drizzly weather. The surrounding trees - tall and spindly - cast much of the shack in shadow and Harry thought the idea of a sunroom would only make things just-this-side-of-bearable for whatever poor soul ended up here.
From upside down, Remus could recognize the Gryffindor Quidditch team. A fifth year Ron Weasley waved eagerly beside Harry who stood at the edge of his team. The Team Captain pin glinted proudly on Harry's uniform as he grinned at the camera. Ron leaned in to say something in Harry's ear and Harry replied out of the corner of his mouth. They both laughed rather stupidly before turning back to smile at the camera.
"I'll thank you not to repeat them at tea," he said with dignity, though he was burning with curiosity. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Mr. James told him those words outside of tea time…
They went to bed early that night, but neither managed to fall asleep for several more hours. Alec tried to convince himself that it was just regular Christmas excitement that kept him awake.
He wrote an entire page on the chocolates that made up the Draco constellation. The sweet Hungarian paprika in the ganache had been a shock to his senses but it paired exceedingly well with the dark chocolate shell. The Scorpius constellation, which he generously allowed Scorpius himself to sample, was strange but fitting. Lemon zest was definitely in the hazelnut ganache, and Draco could have sworn he tasted more than a hint of horseradish too. Another astonishing success.
“Come back here, you old shrew!” Draco screeches. There's no response from the old woman. Potter's breath is coming far too rapidly, like a high-pitched wheeze, and Draco approaches him cautiously.
, desperate to know if he himself was being a clingy nut and what could he do to get Monty off his back.
Hermione doesn’t seem to hear her; she’s whispering urgently with Seamus and taking notes in a huge notebook. Pansy squints in disbelief, turning to Blaise to mouth the words,
"But we cannae play another round wae jus' the two of us!" This wouldn't be an issue if Monty were here, he couldn't help but realize. "We played yer stupid game for two hours!"
James rolled his eyes. He didn’t know this Potter bloke like Monty apparently did, but his Charming boys were a force to be reckoned with. They defied the laws of nature weekly, possibly the laws of magic. All those books on raising independent, well-rounded kids, and not a one warned him about the complete and utter destruction his twins would be capable of when they put their minds together.
he went on, pushing down all the complicated feelings that came along with the years of rejection that James had subjected him to.
(I haven't eaten all day because I told myself I'd just "knock out one scene" before breakfast and now it's 5pm.  I am not responsible enough to write my own fanfiction, someone take this away from me.)
“Lemonhead?” Albus offers a bag of bright yellow sweets. Minerva abstains, but the couple accepts one lemon drop each. “What brings you here today, Mr. and Mrs. Flamel? I understand you are among the first participants in our new estate sale project?”
"Is there anything else you'd like to work on, Mr. Charming?" He waited while the question was considered. There was certainly plenty to unpack in the case of his long lost Gryffindor rival. He hardly knew where to begin.
He hasn't seen the sun since, but it hasn't been very long. He still has hope. He just needs to survive this lunatic long enough to escape.
it reads in purple ink. The calligraphy is well done, but there's no signature. She turns back to the gift, brow furrowed.
When Remus had come by last night, it was long after Rose and Hugo had been put to bed. She and Ron were just about to call it a night when their floo flared. Out stepped Remus Lupin, who dropped the biggest bombshell they had experienced since Voldemort came back to life in the Triwizard Tournament.
He bid goodnight to the boys and turned in early, sloughing off his shoes and throwing himself diagonally across the bed he hadn't been in for weeks. Pressing his face into the pillows, he breathed in the scent of James. His jaybird. He curled up with the pillow, longing for the days before all this magic nonsense, when James could still see the good in him, when -
Harry took the broom up to his porch instead of trudging up the stairs, feeling too full and sated. Christmas Eve dinner was an intimate affair at Blupin Frottage - just Sirius, Remus, Draco, and Scorpius - but his stomach was full and his eyes were itchy with sleep. Tomorrow, they would find out exactly how many Weasleys could fit in his little cabin.
He'd hoped that Alec and Arthur might see Malfoy for the creep he was, might then get their dad to listen to reason, but they were nearly as smitten as James. Malfoy charmed them with tales of the idiot hero Harry Potter, who bumbled his way into random acts of gallantry. James took it all good-naturedly, just as he did when Arthur started up on some of his favorite stories about James, which sent Malfoy into ridiculous, breathless giggles.
gesturing to the flashing cameras around them. The translation spell, even if he wanted to use it in front of Monty and start another row, would only serve to broadcast his words to the press. They could bring this moment up in the privacy of Malfoy's office.
"Welcome to… Malfoy and Parkinson Realty," the wix said, their nose wrinkling in distaste at the mess Harry had tracked in. He figured his Mind Healer wouldn't back him up here, but he decided to ignore the flash of regret anyway.
he asked carefully, dreading the answer. There were so many things, so many issues pulling them apart at the seams, he didn't even know where to start -
"Right," says Arthur, looking rather hot around the collar. "If there's nothing else - this concludes our meeting for Diversity Training Part One. Please listen for Lee..." his voice is drowned out by the din of noise as everyone climbs to their feet, scraping chairs across the floor and rushing for the door.
"Winner..." Alec groaned sleepily into his arms, wiggling his fingers in mock-applause. Arthur extracted a brass button from the box, adding it triumphantly to his other nine pieces.
Retracting his hand, he sets to work again, only looking mildly put out. He speaks in a tone of voice that suggests he's a
owner of his business, James allotted himself a salary and paid monthly on the flat and shop, which was a joint loan from the bank. Monty didn't pay rent, he'd been living in the flat the past year and a half for free and putting his own salary into savings. If he wanted a shop, he could pay for it himself! Like James did!
James ran his hand through his hair again, not knowing how to deny that. He did like to be busy...when it was his business, his recipes, his kids keeping him busy. And now, sure, his old friends and his new politics. And Monty, of course, when he wasn't being difficult.
But this battle, Harry thinks he's won. He won't eat his vegetables - he won't eat anything, in fact, that isn't a room-temperature cup of pudding steeped in preservatives. He will starve unless it's the pudding cup, and he
- " A particularly meaty slug slipped up his throat and out his mouth, the trail of slime clinging to his uvula and making him gag. "Stop!"
Potter's still staring at the ceiling (Draco assumes, as he can only see the back of that bird's nest) when he says, "We're locked in."
James tugged at the warm knit cap, feeling hot and irritated. This stupid bloody magic nonsense had already ruined a perfectly good day out with his family and stolen his favorite hat, and now it was taking his boys away to boarding school until
. He wouldn't bring it up, but even Sirius had to know that if he had been abusing himself in the shower, he probably wouldn't be down here two minutes later. Right?
He's all tucked in now, but not restrained, so Harry untucks himself and gets right back out of bed while Ben is putting the towel away. Harry throws himself down at the little table and snatches up a coloring book, but Ben steals the colored pencils away before he can reach them.
"I should hope not," came a familiar voice that was definitely not his godfather's. A knee-jerk reaction sent Harry barreling under his worktable, climbing onto the low storage shelf and knocking tools and cans of stain aside to make room.
His skull is mushy and he can feel his heartbeat up there. When he pokes a finger to the injury, he nearly passes out again. Ben is on the bed next to him when he comes to, long legs stretched out the length of the mattress with a storybook open on his lap. Harry's eyes go hot and blurry. He whimpers. A few tears leak out. He feels so small under the ache.
"I wasn't!" Harry wheezed. Pickles, it was hard to breathe, like the steam of the shower hadn't quite left his lungs. Remus blinked, then nodded slowly.
Like it was yesterday, and it very well might have been, he remembers darting through the ring of dumbfounded Death Eaters, stumbling down the hill and into a Muggle village. He remembers hiding until dawn, hunched over behind a skip in his blood-soaked tournament uniform, ankle throbbing, drying sweat mixed with the grime on his skin like paste. And just as the sun came up, Danny found him. Offered him help, a clean towel, a phone call. Stole him away.
Arvel Siddall, of Cardiff: "I'll wager ten Galleons that was a Muggle man with him. I can spot [Muggles] a mile away, see. Not that I have anything against [Muggles]! And if I didn't know any better, I'd've wagered his kids were Muggleborn too. But they were definitely his kids, couldn't be anyone else's. Might've been triplets with enough aging potion! Their first trip to Diagon Alley, I'd wager. [Potter] must have kept them far from the wizarding world in order to get that proper Muggleborn look on their faces. Can't say I blame him, that was a bit much back there, that crowd. Maybe the Muggle world is a simpler life for him, you know? Always struck me as the type who'd like a simple life. I can spot a kindred spirit a mile away."
“Oh, I like your definition, Potty,” he sneers, leaning forward to look down the row at him. Ginny touches her hand to her forehead like she has a headache. “Except I would extend it to include intellectual differences as well.”
"He's an old regular of mine, but I haven't seen him in a bit. Was beginning to think he'd found a new purveyor of ice cream!"
“Now’s not the time for your ego,” Draco hisses, still staring at his mangled shins. The threat of the cramp lingers in his thigh, as if biding its time. He’s thoroughly miserable and not in the mood for Potter’s clumsy innuendos.
He was eighteen, crippled, and living in a homeless shelter; he had no family, no job, and a spotty education at best. She was twenty-one, a recent university drop-out, making a miniscule salary that wasn’t even enough to support herself, begging her parents to fill in the gaps. And her family had helped when they could, until she revealed the pregnancy in December.
Last week, before the incident with Helen that landed him in hospital, James visited the London dragon art exhibit alone. It was strange to be out by himself for once, not really on an errand, but certainly a welcome respite from Monty's hovering. James said he was going on a Tesco run, said he forgot to put bananas on the list earlier that week, and that was true. But then he caught the Knight Bus over to London and took in the exhibit. As he rushed home, he picked up a couple of underripe batches to make chocolate-covered bananas, and Monty only seemed slightly suspicious when he said the Muggle bus had stalled six streets over and he'd been forced to walk and that was why he was late.
Draco made a whooping sound and pumped his fist in the air triumphantly before Arthur's lingering smugness registered. He retracted his fist with a squeak just as James peered across the room curiously.
"You bastard!" he hissed, chest heaving as he took in the sight of his murdered tresses. Could a hair growth potion work against that particular curse? There were so many factors to consider when using those potions, and they never managed to regrow anything quite the same as it was. He would be ruined. He would never hear the end of it from the real Blaise!
Arthur sat back in his chair and chewed his lip, sour and suspicious but apparently out of questions.
Potter's oddly calm now that Draco's entertaining his madness. Draco wonders if this is what he was like when he met the Dark Lord in the forest. It's not a good look, but if anyone can pull it off, it'd be Potter. Speaking of pulling off…
She could only guess how badly she had betrayed Harry's trust after his breakup. He didn't take kindly to her talking to Monty privately on the phone, not at all. He'd always been sensitive to people talking about him behind his back, and with Monty's overall manipulation... Well, she was perfectly contrite about it now, but the damage was done. She shouldn't have trusted Monty's feelings over Harry's tendency to brood, not for a second. She should have left well enough alone.
Which left Harry, who had next to no experience in the adult Muggle world, abruptly asking Draco Malfoy out to a London pub.
The moment the heavy iron door closes behind them, the air thins and his head clears. He can breathe again. He vaguely remembers promising the old crone to stay put all night, but now he can’t imagine why they agreed to let her lock the door. She was crowing on about privacy when she prepares their breakfast in the morning… It all made sense at the time, but now—
." The clouds were seemingly eye-level with him up here. His embarrassment would have to catch up to him on the ground, if he ever came down.
“Erm…” Harry dithered for a moment then knelt in the grass. He reached out, his hand hovering in uncertainty above the boy’s shoulder. “What hurts?”
There was an awkward silence again. Funnily enough, he hadn’t gotten used to these, despite all the practice. Maybe he should mention that, it could be funny - actually no, it might make things worse.
He wanted all of the good things for his boys, none of the bad. But that was parenting. He was still learning how to let his children fight their own battles. He nearly got himself nicked (again) after Arthur’s legendary fight last year, when he went to confront the high school boys who thought they could just pick a fight with anyone. He could think of plenty of good uses for those magic prank-products George was talking about, if he could manage to sneak into Alec’s old English teacher’s office, the bastard…
Draco had brushed him off last month, citing Auror threats and confidentiality clauses, when his friend came to him suspecting foul play. Blaise knew he was drugged to sleep on the fateful day when Draco had been robbed of his hair. He knew something had happened to Draco that sent him off to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, leaving behind his hair and a pile of luxury chocolates on the rug. After the Aurors (briefly) arrested him, Blaise knew the two incidents were connected. But as an Unspeakable, Blaise was rather accepting of Draco's excuses.
"My name is Remus Lupin, I work for a school in Northern Scotland," he went on. "I was hoping to sit down with your family to discuss your boys' acceptance into our program." Program. One of the Muggle parents earlier that day had used that word to describe Hogwarts. It seemed fitting.
“Did you need something?” Hermione asks after a long pause. Pansy’s expression twists in frustration before falling back to something more neutral.
"Hmm…?" Draco looked decidedly uninterested, which was a relief and also annoying. "Ah, it was a false alarm, apparently. Aurors said he took the scenic route home, or something."
Remus had managed to "break" the floo, conveniently while his owl was "on holiday," which was "definitely a thing owls do, never you mind where." The post office witch pretended she suddenly didn't understand English, turning him away with a sweet and a wink. Ron and Hermione were talking up his new place as if they'd seen it already, going on about hosting Christmas there. Even Luna and Ginny came over to keep him busy enough that he couldn't
James hardly registered his chair tipping over in his haste to catch up to his other son - the one who was
Wrenching his mind away from that disturbing train of thought, he went on: “Mr. Charming, you’ve experienced some sort of a violent incident which resulted in the traumatic loss of your memories and identity. You’ve recently been reintroduced to a whole new world, and your children are away from home for what I assume is the first time…?”
There he was, looking like a confused pigeon that found itself in the middle of a pack of geese. Except the geese were witches and wizards. And instead of pecking him, they pulled on his rumpled t-shirt and tried to get his attention; they poked his cane curiously, even reverently; they silently shouted a barrage of questions while he stared around with wide, slightly panicked, entirely confused eyes.
"Da' still out there?" he asked. Alec cracked the door open and poked his head out, peering down the hall.
Arthur went on, his voice cracking. He picked up the cat and cradled her to his chest, running his fingers over her back. "She died giving birth! How's that his fault?!"
Harry waited a beat, then gave a firm nod. Malfoy was an odd duck. Then he blanched when it hit him that sarcasm was not something one would say they
"Nothing you should trouble your little Gryffindor heart about," Malfoy answered. James pulled a face.
nice, but doesn't it just seem, well, cold?" for the admittedly attractive cottage built from brightly patterned, locally sourced stones.
"From the story! Hansel and Gretel are lost in the woods and they happen upon a gingerbread house!" He gestures madly around the tiny room and Draco decides not to remind him that this room, at least, is not edible. "There's this old witch—is she a witch? Whatever she is, she feeds Hansel, and keeps feeding him more and more to fatten him up, remember?"
"If there's nothing else…?" It would be their shortest session yet, a mere fifteen minutes, in which Charming had told him all about his Gryffindor piss up and offered pointed comments and vague questions regarding Draco's personal life.
that look and later he saw young Harry wear it in his third year as Remus scolded him for sneaking out -
Al and Ar left the room slowly but silently, staring with wide eyes as Monty and James glared daggers at each other. As soon as the door closed, James threw his cane in the corner of the living room and started signing.
Malfoy was back to his clinical, painfully professional self. No jokes, no smirks, no sneers. For a cold, hard hour. But not even their initial meeting had felt as empty as this. That first meeting, there had at least been
"Well. Maybe it's best. If they'd stuck round to help, maybe Dad would never've met Monty," he said, trying to sound a bit more chipper than he felt at the moment. He wondered if he could find his long lost grandparents online... Minutes ago, he would have wanted a happy family reunion and the promise of more presents on his birthday. Now he just wanted to give them a piece of his mind.
But it doesn't come, of course, because Potter's too good for that. He lingers on the edge of the clearing, peering at Draco in a strange, indecipherable way as the half-giant prattles on about thestral maternity. Draco isn't sure he can stomach a double-period of this—another ninety minutes of Hagrid's rambling and Potter's staring and the truth of the thestrals screaming silently at him—it's all too much, too heavy, too empty and cold and unending—
Each boy, despite dressing like buffoons on opposite ends of the buffoon spectrum, had the same warm brown skin and the trademark mop of black hair that Potter Senior sported. He wondered if their eyes were that same bright green too. It would be fitting, he mused, that Potter managed to come back from the dead (again) three times more powerful and annoying than before.
Monty asked, tapping the top of the box. James waved him off, worried he would ruin the intricate decoration if he tapped too hard.
“I thought we would talk today about your history as a parent,” Malfoy said, clearing his throat. “Would you care to start at the beginning? It’s good to lay it out as a narrative.”
Over the years, the crayons and markers switched to colored pencils and brush-pens. Arthur started offering his own drawings as material. And Alec would inevitably wander away to take apart the back of the telly or tinker with the oven while Arthur had Dad's attention.
Arthur drifted off around the time the Doctor reunited with the TARDIS and took off into another dimension or whatever.
Four hours later, it was past three in the morning and he was beginning to sweat through his t-shirt and joggers. But the shop was completely transformed. He even pulled apart a supply pallet in the alley to make a few signs. Years ago, he had stowed a load of renovating materials in the cupboard under the stairs, including sandpaper and paint, and the signs didn't look half-bad.
Remus helped Sirius to his feet and there they stood together, shoulder to shoulder at the end of the bed, while Harry was alone next to the side-table. The Healer had escaped at some point. Harry chose to take Remus at his word and trust that she wasn’t fetching the authorities to cart Sirius off to Azkaban.
A pounding on the door startled Harry and he slipped, only just managing to regain his footing under the spray of the shower.
Harry shook his head once, meaning it to be an “I’m fine” sort of head-shake, instead of one that said, “I’m an idiot dumb failure who shouldn’t be allowed access to money or big decisions." Sirius didn’t say anything and took him gently by the arm, then corrected his grip to the shoulder after Harry flinched away. They stepped outside into the blustering early-December air. Harry automatically turned to his well-worn path towards the silo, but Sirius guided him the other way.
, Monty pleaded, eyes wide. But James knew he could turn in a second. Malfoy made Monty...not-Monty.
"Did you not mean it…? I suppose I can call you Harry, if you prefer." The way Draco's mouth twisted at his given name made it all too clear his thoughts on
Monty left James alone on their day off. He had a load of Christmas shopping to get done, but more than that, he didn't think he could bear to be around him right now. He wanted to scream more horrible words, to shake some sense into the man, to replay Saturday night and show James what an utter
They closed the shop at nearly nine o'clock that night. Having no kids around to cook for meant that Monty could just get take-out while James minded the shop a little later than usual, then James could use a bit of quick magic to tidy up and shut down.
His knuckles went white and he hefted himself up on the first rung, but couldn't get his legs to keep going. So he rocked back, experimenting with tossing his weight forward and back, letting go and catching himself.
James knocked his cane against the counter next to him to get Monty's attention, but the man didn't turn around. A sure sign of a guilty conscience. James pursed his lips and approached, staring up at his boyfriend with frank curiosity. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the offending table, but Monty wouldn't look up from his frantic whisking. James leaned his cane against the counter and started signing obnoxiously close to Monty's face, leaving the man no choice but to listen.
"I've been doing some research while you were, ah...recovering." Harry flushed hotly. "I've found a suitable location, and what Pansy drew will work perfectly there. Come along - we've got some forms to go through and then you're treating me to lunch."
he finally said. Arthur snorted, muttered something under his breath, and flipped to a new page of his sketchbook. As he was turning the page, James remembered:
"But d'you remember..." Draco paused again to smother a small belch, "...Myrtle's bathroom?" Grey eyes met green like they had years ago...in a grimy mirror.
"Oh, is it?" Draco scoffs. "I missed the part in the text where it says that personality and instincts are based on skin color just the same as actual breeding. It literally comes down to genetics, Potter—"
Harry didn't know how authentic his feelings were for Draco - how much was just novelty and good posture and nice hair - but he knew there was
Draco opens his mouth to protest but Severus is already moving out from behind the counter. Unperturbed, Harry pulls a snack-sized container of Jell-O out of his cart and begins to dig in with a plastic spoon.
A week of escorting Harry to and from impossibly tedious private memory-recovery sessions at Malfoy Manor, hoping against hope that one of these attempts would finally shine a light on the mysterious event that had stolen him away twelve years ago. Between sessions, Ron and Tony pursued countless leads that poured in after any Daily Prophet article featured Harry's name, which reminded the public of the imminent danger their savior still faced. Every time they thought they were on top, they hit a wall. Prime suspects with perfect alibis. An eye witness with a greedy motive and a silver tongue. Even old blood evidence had disappeared from Ministry storage, leading them to one conclusion:
"Don' think a customer'll get ye outta trouble, ye chicken nugget!" Monty looked ready to launch into another tirade and Remus finally broke through his shock.
I didn't know it was a life-long dream of mine to end a 100k fic on "Penis mold" until it happened.  Look at that.  It's simply glorious.
Narcissa Malfoy was sentenced to ten years house arrest for her part in the war. Lucius Malfoy was not so lucky; he served five years in Azkaban and was currently serving an additional ten at Malfoy Manor. His punishment had not left him all...there, in the head. Sometimes Draco caught him arranging the furniture for another dread meeting with the Dark Lord. Sometimes the sight of it sent Draco himself on a spiral, and sometimes his mother had to coax him back out of it with a box of chocolates and a syrupy cup of tea.
"I'm not tired." Ben smiles with such sickening love that Harry springs to his feet and hurls the book at his face. "I SAID NO!"
Denny hauls him up by his arm and drags him over to the sink. Harry kicks up a fight, already gagging, but Denny is easily twice his size. "No, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"
Dad wasn't sedated and as he led the Charmings through to the Blue Parlor for tea, Draco was already calculating how he might slip him something or convince him to leave them be for a few hours. He couldn't risk his father's insane behavior sending Draco himself on a tailspin of war trauma, with his frazzled nerves and stammering speech and his thrice-damned gag reflex. He had to be at his best if he wanted James to...to what? Confess his love? The idea was laughable, that James Charming - Harry Potter - would ever resign himself and his children to a future with the likes of Draco. A Malfoy.
“Is that what this is about, you don’t trust me home alone during the day?” Harry whirled on Remus, who abandoned the paper on the table and put his hands up in a placating way.
"Haz, you're friends with Florean Fortescue?" Scorpius asked awe-struck, tugging on his arm. Harry hesitated just a moment too long and Florean answered.
“Maybe they should give it a go for once,” Blaise said out of the corner of his mouth, perfectly audible to James. “Might spend a bit less time in Azkaban after the next war if they could learn to swallow their pride for - ”
Monty didn't say anything and James wasn't sure what to think about that. He chose to take it as a good sign, or at least not a bad one. He flipped open his astronomy textbook and found Draco, pointing between it and the perfect chocolate replica. Monty didn't say anything and James found more constellations in the book, pointing to their counterparts in the box. It wasn't just a matter of freehanding the decorations; he had to break out the waxed grid paper to properly enlarge the constellations while maintaining the scale. A whole hour of trial and error while keeping a close watch on the temper of the dark chocolate. Malfoy would be happy and Monty would see what a good friend the pointy git could be when he wasn't being difficult -
By dinnertime yesterday, Monty was well and truly worried, flooding James's phone (which was upstairs in their bedroom) with texts and even phone calls. When he finally came home yesterday, Monty was in a state, but James could hardly take in a word. Because by dinnertime, the Wizengamot had officially voted on a new foster system that would protect adoptive werewolf parents while providing them with a voluntary supply of Wolfsbane Potion. It was the first and only positive use of the werewolf registry and James was elated.
James gets an owl and she does her best to keep up.  We're checking in all over the place, folks.  Did you think I forgot about my precious characters?  Stick around because we've got owl post, twin shenanigans, texts (remember flip-phones?), excessive water is featured TWICE in this one, and there are names aplenty for the cat and owl.
This chapter features signing, character flaws, vomiting, swearing, backstories, themed chocolate, Quidditch, and James starting some trouble in a new but also not so new way.
"Scorpius!" Draco called out in reprimand, and Harry blinked up through a fresh haze of floating sawdust. The door swung open and he heard Scorpius stamp inside. Figuring he'd made as big an idiot of himself as he could handle today, he tried to surreptitiously extricate himself from his hiding place, only to succeed in falling rather spectacularly into the counter next to the table.
"You should always say please and thank you," he began. "And right now, your mouth is open, that's gross. No one wants to count your teeth. And you're staring. You're all slouched over too. Sit straight!" He clapped his hands twice like Grandmum did sometimes and was pleased to see Mr. James shoot straight up in his seat.
try wakin' up in agony, no voice, no memories, helluva headache, everyone's either yellin' at ye cos they think yer deaf or they're talkin' about ye like yer thick or like yer not even there… I'd've started throwing things too!" Harry looked slightly embarrassed as the boys were giggling to each other.
"Well, maybe he meant it a diff'rent way," he shrugged again. "So they used to be around and...then they weren't."
“Sorry,” Pansy says, poking lazily through a rack of bras just feet away from Hermione’s precarious situation. “I’ve got some zoning to do. Can’t showcase a sloppy department with the Board puttering about.”
"It's - nevermind that, do you really not remember any of this?" Draco huffed, looking amused and offended all at once.
isn't appropriate over dessert. Potter's avoiding his eyes, but he darts a glance at Draco's pants too. His fitted, plain white pants with Twilfitt & Tattings embroidered on the band. Draco feels his ears turn pink but he bravely buries the urge to cross his legs. He will not let Potter recognize his embarrassment, no matter how much he thinks his own blush might boil him before the oven can.
The deadpan delivery, the hot breath tickling his ear, the outrageousness of finding a candy cottage in the middle of the Forbidden Forest after skiving class with Harry Potter—all of it builds up in Draco's chest and bubbles out of him in a cascading waterfall of snorts and giggles.
For the first time in years, James's fingers were fumbling over the words. He couldn't think of the signs fast enough to reply to Monty's rapid-fire accusations, not when he was quaking from head to toe and barely able to keep from throwing something.
Finally, after reading the report three times over, Charming tucked it back into the folder and nodded, sliding the file back across Draco's desk.
“They don’t fire people anymore,” Dean T. argues. His apron is sky-blue with a cheery yellow ribbon tacked onto the edges. “Too many lawsuits. Easier just to make them miserable enough to quit.”
Draco quirked his head when he spotted the offense. Slowly, his neck seeming to creak as it turned, he peered back over his shoulder at James, who remained frozen on the spot, staring dumbly out into the alley, into the chasm of death itself.
"We couldn't impose - " he started, suddenly feeling mortified at the intrusion into Harry's new life.
"A part of me will always see you as you were in nappies," he said, and Harry fully stopped breathing momentarily at the all-too-recent memories it conjured. "And even if you
Draco read and reread that one, his mouth falling open. It was one thing to suspect, another to see it written out in blue ink. This must have been right after the breakup, sometime after the Polyjuice attack, though there was still no date. He decided to take that line, the one implying James wanted him, with a grain of salt...the man sounded unhinged.
"Yes, and I imagine you read that in the supplies list yesterday, you were quite thorough," McGonagall answered, looking at Harry knowingly. He seemed to force a smile before he continued signing:
A knock at the door and Alec damn near hurled the mobile into the closest desk drawer in a panic while Arthur flew to the wardrobe to stow the cat.
"Does he want your help?" he asked sharply. Harry was nothing if not independent. He'd just escaped Monty's grip and Ron was hard-pressed to release Malfoy on him now that he was finally free!
the overworked batter. His mouth was screeching on autopilot as he laid into him for tracking his every move rather than returning a bit of that blind trust he was demanding.
James blinked, then nodded, not even seeing the Aurors staring back at him. The pain in his hip felt fresh, he felt like he was still broken into pieces. His
"Testy as a pair of quizzicals," Blaise muttered, clearly basking in his not-cleverness. He crossed his arms and leaned against the tall lab counter on which Draco was working. The post would go out in twenty minutes and he wanted to be absolutely sure this lot was safe. He may not have been speaking to the Golden Git of Gryffindor, but he wouldn't see him dead. Again.
Harry shrugged. He was completely out of his element. "I don't know how, but I know I do. My heart misses her even if my brain can't remember." Draco was going to murder him.
"Remus, do control yourself," McGonagall murmured under the din of noise, casting a wary glance over the scene.
But Potter would never think of something as sweet and clever as this. No, this box was entirely Charming.
Hermione Granger-Weasley, ever the insufferable know-it-all, was also an efficient nag and brilliant conversationalist. Years ago, Draco looked in on her parents' long-term case as a side project during his last six months as a Mind Healer trainee. He nearly got himself chucked out of the program for snooping through patient files and butting his nose into the family troubles of an Order of Merlin recipient. But he submitted a viable treatment plan that utilized ancient charmwork and three new potions, one of which was his own creation. The unique combination successfully wore down the skilled Obliviation young Granger had inflicted on her parents during the war. He graduated with honors and became a shoe-in for an open position in the Janus Thickey Ward.
Draco shook his head, working up a scowl to mimic how he'd looked that day in the mirror. He fumbled his wine glass, spilling some of the fine Elvish vintage. Still shaking his head and scowling fiercely, he leaned forward to trap James's hands once more.
"They're the only Muggle shop that does it right," Draco insisted. It was a long-held secret that he preferred Muggle to magical chocolate. Or it had been, until his mother blabbed to Blaise and Blaise blabbed to everyone and their aunt. "Everything else comes through the post dry or melted. Don't know what the secret is, but theirs is never wanting."
It was as he was bending over the oven to retrieve the roast that he heard little old Marge's voice through the window.
he signed down the table to Alec, who ducked his head and shrugged. He grunted. The boy lifted his head but avoided his gaze by resting his elbows on the table and picking at his sleeves. Monty snorted. He wasn't James. The boys couldn't just ignore him by refusing to look in his direction; he had a voice. A bloody loud one. "Alexander!"
“You’re exactly the same,” Sirius blurted in a raspy voice. Harry hummed in answer; he certainly didn’t feel the same but he’d yet to run across a mirror. “Exactly...exactly the same…”
Monty grunted in the affirmative. That was certainly true. James was sleeping at normal hours, eating regularly, and back to his obsessive cleaning. The shop, the kitchen, and the flat upstairs sparkled. More importantly, James was no longer pale and saggy, and they were once more enjoying their nighttime shenanigans. (And sometimes morning and afternoon shenanigans, now that the boys weren't underfoot.)
"So, Mr. Blue, can M & P Realty count on you for a good review?" Draco asked lightly. Harry turned onto his side and rested his chin on Draco's shoulder, inching close. Draco turned his head and met him halfway for a slow, sweet kiss.
, you nutter!" Potter cries, smacking his hand off the lump of peppermint that serves as a doorknob.
"Those two are at each other's throats all hours... I'm surprised there've been no actual punches thrown. When Harry and I were - "
Having the boys home for the summer meant feeling both on top of the world and perpetually exhausted. One year ago today, he'd celebrated his birthday with Alec, Arthur, Monty, and a comically huge box of pizza. He marveled at how much had changed in just twelve months. He was a new man. Literally.
Harry shot a glare at a half-distraught, half-elated Sirius and then continued pacing the length of Ron and Hermione's shared office.
"Because he was an arse," Monty smiled proudly. Harry actually pouted and started signing, but Monty waved his hand dismissively. "Relax, ye lout, a know…" He turned to Remus and went on in a way that made Remus think he was repeating an oft-heard argument. "
"Right, yes, of course," Hermione smacked her forehead lightly. She could swear those boys looked and sounded so different in person, but on the phone, she didn't stand a chance. "Is something wrong?" She dreaded getting calls from the Charming house: the calls ranged from night-terrors to medical emergencies to Monty whispering to her about James when she would much rather be sleeping. She hoped it wasn't anything too serious this time - Ron was making a hearty beef stew she'd been looking forward to all day.
Two hours later, class has long since ended and Draco is losing faith in Potter's sense of direction.
Malfoy's voice was clipped and cold, his hand reaching out in demand. James bit his lip to keep from laughing as he handed over the warm knit cap that Ron had forced on him over a month ago. In the blink of an eye, Malfoy had swapped out the small beret for the plain black cap, but it didn't look much better paired with his own semi-formal Muggle clothes.
Draco smirked deviously and braced his forearms against the table, leaning into Harry's space once more.
"Look, I know it's him," Blaise growled. "It has to be! We found the shop and that Muggle bloke from the Prophet pictures is always minding the front."
"When you disappeared," she sighed, and Harry's stomach didn't do that clenching-flip it usually did when that was mentioned. "You have to understand, there was so much going on, things didn't really settle into a proper, clear-headed search for - for ages, it seemed. Of course, they
"Pureblood propaganda," she said dismissively. Harry - he insisted it was alright to call him Harry again - spared a glare for the newspaper as he worked to calm two-year-old Hugo from his tantrum. "Marietta Edgecomb is taking advantage of your situation to make Muggles look bad and Purebloods superior."
It all went down in such rapid succession that James didn't have time to comprehend the words. His own wand went from translating to zipping into Tony's outstretched hand. He leapt to his feet just as Draco managed to hit his father with a stunning spell, before his wand was taken as well. Narcissa chose to stand and throw her cup of scalding tea over the boys' heads at the intruders, who dodged it and collected her wand in turn. The boys were the last to be disarmed as they jumped up to face the two remaining figures in the doorway.
“Sure am glad Corporate is takin’ away ten percent of me hard-earned paycheck in the form of reduced hours!” he continues, practically shouting. The entire group of suits is clearly listening, but trying to appear as if they aren’t. “Was dangerously close to openin’ up a savings account, I was. Now I won’ have to deal with that
"LOOK AT THESE!" he screamed, spotting a particularly vicious looking dragon on the cover of one of the design catalogues.
“Mr. Malfoy will be overwhelmed with buckets and bins of new inventory this week,” Albus says cheerfully. “I’m confident that young Harry will handle this mission with great aplomb.”
"We need to leave," Potter mutters, bending over Draco's shoulder from behind the chair. His hot breath fills the shell of his ear and Draco has to fight to steady his heart. He focuses his attention on the arm of the chair. It’s quality leather, soft and well tended, but stained. Or was the hide stained before it was tanned? Actually, it looks like a design, worn away by years of wear…
They talk long into the hour. Harry plucks up his Gryffindor courage and tells Draco all about how there's something wrong with him, how he loves Draco with ever fiber of his little lion heart but he just doesn't want...that. Not from him, not from anyone. But what Draco hears is that there's something wrong with
"Don't tell me the Weasel is upset that his best friend isn't his best friend anymore?" He pasted on his best sneer.
Harry dropped into a chair that was cushier than it looked and caught Malfoy's wince as the leather creaked and squeaked with water. He offered a half-smile, half-smirk in answer and Malfoy took his own seat, pulling a notepad and quill close.
Mr. James nodded but didn't say please, which was not polite, but sometimes it was even less polite to tell people they were not polite, so Scorpius let it go.
Paperwork! Riiight! That is...that is definitely, definitely something, yeah. Definitely suspicious. Paperwork in HR. Brilliant work, Draco!" Harry claps Draco on the arm, hard. Draco winces and opens his mouth to say something, but he's interrupted by a buzz of activity in Women's Clothing. Harry and Draco peer around opposite sides of the tall rack to see a small mob of people led by the broad-shouldered man from Sporting Goods.
They ride together to the edge of the forest in quiet reverence…until Potter starts babbling about breadcrumbs, Draco chides him for wanting more food at a time like this, and the kindling catches once more.
. He was meant to trust James, but the sight of his little bird fluttering around in a tizzy all of yesterday and today was driving Monty up the wall. He kept smiling for no reason. Well, obviously for a reason, but no reason he had any business smiling at if Monty was meant to be trusting him.
"Are you…" Draco peers over the top of Potter's head at the witch who is adding something to the cauldron—something that smells like cinnamon. "Are you
The door swings open and the camera backs up rapidly as Cedric steps out. He freezes upon seeing the camera before flashing a dazzling smile. Behind him, Arthur claps a hand on his shoulder.
Charming signed and Gibbs looked surprised, even pleased, before he translated: "I want tae know how tae use a wand again."
Arthur dragged his feet while Alec hurried ahead of him up the stairs, down the hall, and into the largest bedroom. Twin beds, ironically mismatched, were nestled against opposite walls. At the end of Alec's bed was a Franken-desk he had put together from two tables and an old dresser: one surface was horizontal and sat higher than a normal desk - he preferred to sit on a high stool - and the other surface was leaning between the horizontal piece and the wall, rigged to pull out at various angles when needed. Bungee-cords held large drafting papers in place on the angled surface, but he kept it pushed up close to the wall for now. Climbing up onto the tall, padded stool, he began rooting around in the dresser-drawers tucked under the table.
Harry signed and Monty said: "S'not like he thought o' the name himself. They gave 'im a list'a common male names an' he just chose one."
"I can," Draco agreed. "But I won't. I want to help." The word triggered something in Ron's mind. Harry.
fridge. It was hard to hate the little squirt's forgery, but he could at least resent the excessively high quality of the stationary. And while the parchment from Malfoy's St. Mungo's office was much more modest, Monty still wanted to pitch it into the oven and call it a day.
"I've checked." And he had. Twelve years after the war, he was still checking his post for spells. "It's just a decent quality packed in a suitable shipping container. The good shops don't usually bother with mail-order, they've enough customers to do without."
efforts, and Harry's quick to correct. Inevitably, they fight. His words are as sharp as the knife in his gut and Harry shuts down. Goes cold.
James signed in utter disbelief. What, were they first years again? Even Al and Ar weren't this petty.
Draco snorted inadvertently and looked away, firmly clamping down against the smile that tugged at his lips. He would
Unwrapping a large frame, James took one glimpse of the portrait inside and laughed so hard his stomach hurt. It was a painted portrait of Arthur seated in a huge leather wing-back chair, holding Leonard on his lap while he stroked her, reminiscent of an evil supervillain. Portrait-Arthur actually looked quite life-like, and he moved and smirked evilly, but Portrait-Leonard looked even more like a goblin than usual. James pulled Arthur in for a hug and told him they'd hang it up front-and-center in the sitting room. It was perfect and James wanted to look at it every day.
Monty cleared his throat. The situation was far too serious for his jokes and James was never in the smiling mood when he was in hospital. It was time to get him back home.
"I - well, I thought of it as… And you said, then, you wanted to put it all behind us, all that rot in our past, and be - " Draco cleared his throat, cheeks pinking like they had that brilliant, stupid night in October. "I gathered you regretted it, at least in part, since you didn't want to talk about it anymore after the fact. But I thought we'd… I thought we'd at least put the past behind us." It was a statement, but sounded a bit like a question.
which was true, but James thought they should shut up and give them a shot first. He didn't usually go for books, but it was the only magical gift shopping he could do by mail and he didn't fancy causing another riot in Diagon Alley.
he shook his head. He did not want a big fuck off dragon on his chest. He didn't know what he wanted - he didn't want any ink, really - but he wasn't stupid enough to leave it up to his sprog.
James screwed up his face and threw his glasses on the table, his vision blurring with tears. Whatever had broken in him earlier was swimming to the surface now as he squinted to read a four page essay on things he had done
Harry and Hermione share a look and mask their grins. For the moment, a balm soothes the deep ache in his heart. Merlin, he's missed these two.
James closed his mouth - Monty briefly wondered if it had gone that far, if he'd actually sucked the git's cock - and looked away, his face completely devoid of expression. When he finally answered, he said:
“Dean over in Crafts has the makings for something like this,” she murmurs to Irma P., her elderly colleague.
"And one for me too," Nott said, moving toward James and Alec. James brought his hands back down to hold Alec tightly against his side, obstinately ignoring the throbbing pain in his freshly-bashed hip. The pain and the sight of Nott's face - so much like his father's - was sending his head spinning wildly back to that night.
He pulled out of the dive within inches of the ground, his toes skimming the grass as he leveled out the nose of the broom before coasting over to Alec.
James flinched and Draco curled his lip while he made a mental note to look into a new tone-evening cream. His usual lot wasn’t doing him any favors, obviously.
Draco felt his face flush; his cheeks were hot against the frigid air. Harry was grinning again in that stupid smug way he had when he thought he'd bested Draco.
"Is that how all of you see me?" He thought of Remus, pushing him to sign on at Hogwarts to keep him close; he thought of Ginny and Luna, blindly praising his first broom even though he knew now it was little more than polished rubbish; he thought of Ron and Hermione, going on to become aurors without him, with their sleek robes and wand-holsters and frown lines and the odd grey hair.
- and the shirt under his coverall was the brightest shade of yellow that could possibly be captured by any camera, magical or otherwise. Any brighter and it would have eclipsed the entire photo.
"Well, I can't think in soggy trousers," he declares. He throws off his shoes and trousers before he can lose his nerve and climbs to his socked feet. The room tilts and he crashes to the floor again, banging his knees. He swears loudly and Potter crawls over.
He touched a lily that drooped over the edge of the decorate vase in which the flowers were artfully arranged.
"Ye know, a was talkin' tae Remus at the game," he began, hanging the pot on the overhead rack. "He's a werewolf, right? An' he was tellin' me about the laws that lot has."
"Even Mummy doesn't go to buy her own," he said. "They've a mail-order system." Enough said. Or it should have been, but he was in the presence of Blaise -
"Er - I'm alright," Tony answered with a wary eye. James felt lighter with Nott's wand still pointed at Narcissa and Tony's wand now trained on him. He could think again.
Every holiday brought business but Christmas was ridiculous. The customer flow never seemed to stop that Wednesday but James still found time to wriggle and dance behind the counter. The Daily Prophet that morning had detailed the Wizengamot's final ruling on werewolf/non-lycanthrope adoption. Three weeks ago, the Muggle girl had been reunited with her adoptive parents and the family sent home with an apology, seeing as there were no laws currently on the books barring werewolves from adoption. More than that, however, was the decision that took place yesterday. James went with Hermione to the protest, leaving Monty to tend to the mail-orders.
"You're rebuilding boundaries and you've suddenly been thrust into adulthood," she said now as they strolled through the massive, wild field behind Blupin Frottage. "This is going to be a deeply personal process, one that no one else can understand."
"What'd'ye think about expandin' intae baked goods?" he asked lightly as he pulled a pristine carrot cake out of the oven. He preened when he caught James's bright eyes admiring the cake. He loved making candy with James, but baking was his pride and joy.
"I don't actually care, you know," Blaise sighed. Draco swatted him with the newspaper they had been pouring over just minutes ago.
"First things first," Hermione said, straightening in her seat. "You need to hire someone to mind the counter so you can get back to the kitchen."
James nodded weakly. Monty would be annoyed - he preferred James's appointments to stay away from Mondays, their day off from the shop. But James felt he had to be there for Malfoy. He had to find some way to fix this, to show him he cared. Yes, as a friend. They
Harry had gotten wrapped up in this! Prism’s most delicate ingredient - what could be considered the essence of magic itself, an ever-changing force that allowed the volatile potion its unique properties - was acquired by syphoning magical energy from the surrounding environment and instilling it into a crystal. The practice wasn’t illegal per se, but very few potions which required a crystal charged with pure magic. Hogwarts was a perfect source for the energy, though no one was stupid enough to try it under McGonagall’s nose. Diagon Alley was regularly patrolled for unnaturally humid spots, which indicated a recent syphoning. And Ron would wager that Potter Cottage, even in 1998, was still reeling from Voldemort’s initial demise.
"Excuse me for trying to get some sleep!" seethed Weasley. "Without any new leads, there's only so much I can do!"
Dinner was shit. The whole day was shit. The stubborn arse must have slept on the floor because he came out of that bedroom just as tired and cranky in the morning as he had been last night, and it was making everything that much harder on Monty and the boys.
"Are you injured?" Malfoy knelt down, examining the boy's face and limbs, and Harry wondered if he should just...back away, leave, escape before he had to make
"Nobody here is in any position to judge me. I wipe their arses daily," he retorted, reaching for another truffle only to be batted away. "Oi! Those are mine!"
“Right,” Malfoy coughed, looking uncomfortable. “I only meant it as an explanation for - nevermind. You walked and worked and slept on the couch. And Ms. Patel became more and more pregnant…?”
While Ron and Hermione moved ahead to help load the luggage and the cat-carrier onto the train, Monty pulled the boys around for a gruff goodbye.
Dad gave Ginny a strange look that Alec had no hope of interpreting. He nodded stiffly and then held his hand over the broom, like she showed them earlier. Immediately, without even a beckoning gesture, the broom leapt into Dad’s waiting hand with a woosh of air like it was magnetized.
The forest was in the far distance and they were meandering in the general direction of the old silo, though they wouldn't reach it in their time together today. Much like this fantastical concept of recovery, the silo was always waiting for him in the far distance. It might as well not exist, for all Harry had been able to get there without some sort of interruption.
To his credit, Ron did everything he could. He stopped breathing, his face turned tomato-red, and his eyes bugged out like marbles, but the laughter still came wheezing out. Harry strove to be the bigger man.
Alec and Narcissa were attempting to drag Arthur and Draco away from Nott, but Draco wasn't entirely with it. His mind was still blissed out on Veritaserum but his body wasn't lacking in strength, so it was a struggle to get him to relinquish his hold Arthur enough to pull them both to safety. Nott followed his gaze and James saw what would happen a moment before it did.
James's hands blurted out before he could think. Monty blinked dumbly at him and after a moment, James decided to go on. He was in too deep anyway.
James finished counting down the drawer, depositing a bulk of cash into the safe under the counter. He marked down the numbers and notes for the day before shutting down the shop: closing up display cases, turning off accent lights, brushing empty wrappers onto the floor. He wondered where the boys were; it was 7:20 now. He retrieved his mobile from under the antique register and sent a text to both of them.
"Jus' the reruns," Monty answered with a wink. Which meant no, they hadn't. They weren't really into the show, not like Alec was. Surely they wouldn't bother with it while he was gone. So who was sleeping on the sofa? "Yep, we stay up every night watchin' trash telly an' tellin' each other ghost stories, it's been a riot without you two!"
“DON’T!” Harry stood, whirling around and reaching towards the Healer as if he could stop her by simply flapping his hand about. It seemed to work, but maybe she’d just listened to him. He was still getting used to people doing that.
Draco's carefully coiffed locks slipped smoothly from his head to the floor, leaving him bald and looking like the merfolk of Black Lake. And cold. What he wouldn't give for Charming's warm knit cap at that moment.
Then he stalked back into the kitchen and shut the door. Numbly, James reached over and pulled the window shut.
Irma sniffs in frank disapproval and Hermione frowns, biting her lip. Carefully, as if it might bite her, she pulls the bookmark out of the little gift box and tucks it into her large notebook. Pensively, she runs a finger over the edge that sticks out, a frown still pulling on her lips.
. Her silver mane seems to glow brighter than any moon, and her stunning pale-golden hide is a study in radiance. The foal sports a wild tuft of a mane—as wild as Potter's, really—that twinkles like starlight.
“Everything alright?” Remus peered at him over his tea, looking as comfortable as he ever did at the little table in the breakfast nook - which was to say, not at all. Harry was the one who insisted they use it. If he sat with his back to the rest of the house, it was almost like being outside. The alcove was warm with plenty of light and a spectacular view of the mountains. Somewhere between the wild back garden and the distant treeline of the Forbidden Forest sat an old, abandoned silo he had yet to explore. Perhaps he would make another trip across the field today. He could do whatever he liked.
each other. You and I, we don't need each other… We can do just fine on our own, it's just we're better together. Like a team."
their crushing disappointment. It was cruel to push this farce on them! Far kinder to leave Harry Potter among the dead.
desperate and easy. Why else would he be pining after someone who kept pushing him away? And Hermione had already convinced him of his selfishness, though he was working on that. Monty had a knack for reading people and he said James was gullible for trusting Malfoy; he said James was pathetic. He said he was stupid.
"Your…your Muggle family didn't have enough?" Draco should've guessed why all those Weasley jibes were hitting so close to home for Potter: the boy who dressed in rags at Madam Malkin's shop.
Feeling guilty for the many failures of today, Harry was preparing to bid them goodbye once Draco Apparated them back to the office. But, ever full of surprises as this grown up Draco Malfoy was, he didn't seem put out and even extended an invitation to lunch in Diagon Alley. Harry readily agreed - he didn't think he answered too fast, but Terry was smirking like that annoying Muggle couple from the Open House, so maybe he had - and gave Terry a parting wave as Draco dropped the files on their desk and led the way out the front door.
Draco pushed his mother gently away and opened his mouth for Tony to cautiously approach and deposit three drops of Veritaserum. His eyes glazed over and his face went slack. Narcissa eased him back down to the loveseat.
"Having emotions doesn't make you crazy, H-James, it makes you human." He took off his glasses and pressed his hands to his face. "Monty is not happy when he's with you either." She was putting words in Monty's mouth but that was the gist of what he'd said that evening. "He feels useless and in the way. He feels like you don't need him anymore now that you have magic."
The door remains locked. Draco meets Potter’s gaze. The room seems to shimmer with magic, but they can’t grasp it.
starve - for quite some time. He doesn't know how long, of course, just as he doesn't know how long Ben has been Ben instead of Lenny or how long he's been down here or even how old he is except that he is most definitely - probably - stuck at the front-end of puberty.
"If anyone needs a Mind Healer right now, it's you," his boss grunted shortly. Ron snapped his mouth shut. It wouldn't do any good to argue.
the art. Only he kept thinking that human beings were weird for doing this sort of thing. Going to a specific building to look at pretty (or pretty ugly) things. They weren't
He gasped and kicked out again and again, cursing himself for tying his laces so tightly that morning - what was he afraid of, shoe-stealing gremlins?! As the heat burned through his shoe and into his foot, all thoughts of magic and common sense dropped out of his head.
It was true, anyway. His godfather was all devious smirks and sad, fond moments that reminded Harry of Mrs. Weasley bidding her children farewell at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In his darkest thoughts, which sprang up without warning to twist his muscles into knots, Harry wondered if he'd pushed Sirius too far over the months. Maybe he'd overheard his whinging about him to Kim. Maybe he was hurt by Harry's antics after the drinking incident.
This gives Severus pause and Draco looks between them, his anger dwindling to panic as he sees Harry's punishment slip away.
Monty thumped down the stairs and the kitchen door opened just as he put the lid on the box and motioned Anne over. Monty obviously hadn't looked over at the shop on his way downstairs, but that was alright...James wanted to see his face when he saw it for the first time!
“Mm. I’m rather fond of that shade of yellow, actually.” Draco balked. “Oh don’t worry, I won’t be subjecting your poor eyes to my
He would have preferred his beloved kitchen in tact and his special batch of chocolate-coated fudge in Draco's mouth to shut him up, but he thought having those long fingers in his hair was some consolation.
, and Potter scampers off him, managing to crash an elbow into his boys and that is really just the cherry on top of this fried sundae.
"We paid a brief visit to Hogwarts," Pansy piped up, her tone prickly and careful. "For inspiration. Not for thievery. Honestly, is your opinion of Slytherins really so low?"
But it seems like Harry couldn't care less for his efforts. Draco does everything right. The neck is his favorite place to start. No one invites a touch to their neck, not without complete and utter trust.
music an' asked the police tae knock some sense in tae whoever it was. They knock on the front door but Da's in the back, dancing away an' havin' a riot, so he cannae hear 'em. They get in - " Monty was shaking with silent laughter and James's face was burning. " - an' see a smear of raspberry jam on the counter from when he was boxing up donuts earlier. But they dinnae think it was jam, no, they reckon it's
Remus didn't know what was going on, but he knew he needed to recover this moment, and he needed some help.
“Malfoys don’t apologize,” Draco recited almost automatically. He’d repeated this mantra at least a dozen times this afternoon but suddenly, under James’s cool glare, it seemed a frail argument. Which was a pity because until now it had seemed airtight.
"We put your things at the end of the train, second to last compartment. The last compartment has Aurors in it. If you need anything, just knock on the wall."
“It’s temporary but could turn permanent. She’s considering retirement.” Remus kept his voice carefully light as he waved his wand to pour fresh tea for them both. Harry heard a creak from upstairs; Sirius would join them soon. He stood and skirted around the table, fetching a third mug to buy some time.
He used his own shield charms to buffer against the currents in the floor while Rachel defended them from the storm raging overhead. It was only minutes before Ron arrived with a full squadron of Aurors, but it seemed like an eternity. They hadn't even quelled the storm before they tossed an emergency Portkey over to Rachel and whisked James away to the Ministry.
He wished he could go back and tell Draco himself before the choice was taken out of his idiot hands. "I
) before they handed over their own gifts to James and Monty. James opened Alec's gift first and stared in wonder. A stag, about a foot tall, made of sparkling silver wire that was bent delicately into shape. He set it on the side table where it cantered and reared its prongs. It reminded James so starkly of -
And then Potter went and got himself killed. The world mourned ostentatiously while Charming was born. Charming still managed to stumble into trouble, albeit a lot more quietly than Potter ever did. He became a single father, worked for every Knut, centered his whole life around providing for two children. And he gifted the world some damn fine chocolate. It was hard to begrudge someone any of that. Potter was surly, even when he had everything going for him. Charming was - well, certainly not chipper, and thoroughly broody sometimes, but he was not a jabbering idiot that was always itching for a fight. Not like Potter. Not yet, anyway...
"Let me call Monty and see what's going on," she said soothingly, already planning five steps ahead. "I'll send a letter to your Dad right now, see if I can't invite myself over after dinner tonight. Don't worry, Arthur," she added. "We'll get it sorted." Curse James and his temper anyway, the man was a father!
“Auror Weasley,” Tony said in a quiet tone that still carried over to the others. “I don’t know how much of his statement we can take into consideration if - “
It swung open to reveal a kitchen the same size as the rest of the shop. A shiny white tile floor and deep red walls greeted him. To the left, old appliances and a huge oven hood took up two walls with a large rack of pots and pans hanging overhead. A spacious island-counter across the middle of the room was covered in neatly-arranged trays of neatly-arranged chocolate drops. With an odd jolt, Remus recognized these treats from the first Charming Chocolates variety-box he had requested via mail-order three years ago.
“She’s just released a new one, it's called Mouth to Mouth: Straight to Your Heart. We've got an end-cap devoted to it over there, you can’t miss it.” Hermione gestures to the next aisle but Pansy doesn’t move. Hermione pries the notebook out of her reach, using her new bookmark to mark her place before hiding it under the counter. Pansy seems lost. “Is there anything else?”
“Yep.” Did he dare take another bite? He felt the tension linger in the air, telling him that Remus had more to say, so he waited it out, tracing the rim of his Holyhead Harpies mug idly.
"Not him." Arthur thrust a stack of incriminating letters at Alec. "Look at all this! Whatever he's done, he's tryin' tae apologize but Dad's bein' a right cunt!" He was seething. This was Monty all over again. Dad and his blasted pride getting in the way of things,
James's heart turned to stone and dropped into his stomach. Footsteps approached the kitchen. A pack of celebratory Butterbeers was in the fridge, he couldn't stow the crudity there unless he wanted it found within minutes. In the oven! No, the roast was in there. The footsteps danced around the front counter and he did the only thing he could think to do.
"A student died in that Tournament, Mr. Potter," Malfoy snapped. "I hardly think it's something to bring up in a joking manner."
He took them all out for lunch while Monty braved the holiday rush alone. He ignored the odd looks at the cafe, letting Alec translate for him at the register, and then took a detour through the park to stall before they had to return to the shop.
This was so very different from what he had with the stiff and cold Lucius, who still spent his days puttering around the Manor under house arrest, no better or worse after being taken advantage of by Nott. This was even different from what he had with Scorpius, but not for lack of affection. It was just...different.
But Potter's not paying attention, the wanker. He's still standing, still staring with unfocused eyes at the locked door. Still clenching his perfect jaw, the picture of barely-contained panic.
"I don't want to Apparate!" he protested. He didn't know if that was true. He hadn't even considered learning or not learning, but agreeing to lessons now just felt like admitting they were right.
Dad shot him an annoyed look that was softened by the ghost of a smile. Their dad wasn't a foul-tempered man by a long shot. He had a temper sometimes, sure, but Monty was far more likely to go off. And yeah, Dad would get frustrated when Arthur tried sneaking yet another new drawing to the wall downstairs without framing it first, and then rearranging everything to make enough room for it (two inches of space around each frame, that was the key), and then dusting it all again for good measure (apparently for the health inspector's benefit but they would be hard-pressed to find any dust in their living space either). But Dad's slight neuroticism was just a quirk, really. Easily overlooked when you considered the crippled mute amnesiac as a whole.
“Erm…being different?” he suggests, as if he’s speaking to an idiot, albeit a nice one. “Having...differences.” At Arthur’s encouraging nod, Harry grimaces and adds, “Like, skin color. Religion.”
James blinked rapidly, his mouth fell open, but still he made no attempt to defend himself. Monty scoffed. Seven years. Seven years, down the drain, for a posh fuck.
"When is your next appointment with...your charming new patient?" he said, clearly trying to work around the non-existent block.
"Er, shall I fetch him here, or...?" It didn't feel right to leave a child crying in the dirt but he wasn't about to -
, James explained excitedly. Hermione had a lot of brilliant ideas of what they could do next, ideas that could help Remus keep the Ministry off his back when it came to Teddy.
“Enjoy your break, Hermione,” Pansy says kindly, setting the book aside with the utmost care. “Frida and I need some alone time.” Before Hermione can retreat, however, Pansy grasps the mannequin - Frida, apparently - by the groin and hoists it up, leaning its back against her chest. She hooks her chin in the crook of its neck, using the intimate position to fuss with a loose arm connection.
He looked down the hall and saw his Dad standing in the middle of their living room, surrounded by wrapping paper, staring blankly at the smoking telly. The sight left Arthur cold and empty, like he was adrift in the water with nothing to hold on to. It wasn't even lunchtime in the Charming household but it was so...quiet.
Potter’s screaming now, his shoulders are pulled taut and he’s trembling. Draco can’t see his face as he pounds on the door but the sight of a plainly terrified Gryffindor is enough to irk anyone.
Monty was a good man and he deserved the world. James couldn't give him the world, couldn't even give him what he was asking for. But he could do something, dammit.
," Alec snapped at him, regaining a little color in his cheeks now. "I told ye to cause a distraction, not fling yerself to yer death!"
, Draco thought, recalling the Dark Lord's slightly pathetic demise. "You were somewhat known for it, actually. I'm not surprised it's ingrained in your reflexes. I suppose the Aurors still have your wand?" he addressed the question to Charming but directed it to Granger, who nodded. "They've no legal claim to it anymore. Get it back from them and practice a few simple spells. Review your old school books. See what comes back to you."
All the fight is sucked out of him and their fire turns to smoldering embers. No longer blazing but still hot and lethal, full of coy potential.
"You're asking too many questions," Malfoy accused. "All these years investigating and you've never learned how to shut your gob and listen."
"Himself too, obviously," Weasley amended. "I should've given him the duty schedule, he didn't know who to look for when they went running down the street for an Auror. Took him nearly ten minutes to find Tony, and by then, Monty was gone."
"Yeah," Harry said, swallowing with an audible gulp. His scar was firmly covered by his cap, he reminded himself, and Malfoy hadn't seen Harry Potter since fourth year. He'd not been found out yet, surely.
"I think he'd'a still ended up working in the bakery," Alec sighed. "He worked there before we were born."
"Nothing wrong with asking for help, you know," Draco said, bending low to press a quick kiss to his lips. James kept his mouth firmly clamped shut, mindful of his breath and not wanting to spoil the mood. There was something to be said about using sign language, especially in the mornings. "Unless you're still too much of a
"Well you an' a know that," Monty said. "He's takin' all the sensible precautions, he's a good father, but there are still so many who wan' tae take Teddy away from him."
Harry was blind and tramping awkwardly through a snowy, unkempt field. Long blades of grass brushed against his knees, coating his shins in cold wet, and he was well and truly sick of the pageantry.
This had to be one of his stupider ideas. Why did he ever do anything in the name of science? It only led to half-melted robots and suicidal flights of fancy.
"What're you...on?" Draco slurred, dropping into a chair. Seamus snorted and poured him a glass of water, which he sneered at.
While digging out the ladder to hang the new signs, he crashed his hip into the counter and had to sit down for several minutes. The pain nearly made him vomit and he cursed himself for forgoing the pain potion
When the nightmares send him running from his bed, it's fifty-fifty odds that Potter will join him in the common room. There's something surreal about the castle in the dead of night. Years past, he spent countless hours under the glass windows of the Slytherin common room, watching the merfolk and dreaming of a simpler life. This isn’t like that. There's no soothing, fluttering green-blue light of the lake. Sometimes there's a fire, if Draco remembers to bring his wand. Other times, it's just Draco, the cold stone floor, the cold stone walls, and the windows looking out into a black sky. No merfolk passing by to remind him that nothing matters, that life carries on even while the world burns. Just him and an endless void of possibility. Of expectation. Of duty.
, he huffed. James shook his head but the unconscious little shrug he added did nothing for his defense. James was glad that Monty had his back to their lone customer so she couldn't see his sour expression.
"I spoke with Monty today," she confessed. His head jerked up, eyes wide. "Just to get his side of the story. He… Well, I don't think I've ever actually heard him swear before, no matter how worked up he can get when we phone. He sounded - "
But no. James went on to explain every little chore that Monty insisted on doing for him, every little moment Monty thought it was necessary to supervise him, to tell him how he should do it instead. She listened as he told them about waking up at dawn just to have some time to himself. He told them about discovering Harry's invisibility cloak in the trunk and using it just to carve out a modicum privacy. She listened in stunned silence as he told them, in his own way, how Monty made
James released the squirming boys and smacked a hand to his chest, heart hammering. Merlin's toe, that robotic bitch was terrifying up close. With a shaking hand, he pointed under the far bed that held up one side of their blanket fort.
He quilled a note to schedule a new appointment with Charming and explained the new spell. He spent three whole minutes trying to work out a polite way to say, "Leave your Muggle at home," before he finally sent it off unrevised and packed up for the day. He had an afternoon appointment. Six-year-old Scorpius had a new watch and was not the forgiving type if Draco was late to pretend-tea.
Harry lies on his back on the floor, palms down, eyes up. He can't get his stomach muscles to stop shivering, but he won't go back to the same stupid furniture right now. But even the coolness of the smooth concrete beneath him is nothing new, not really. Perhaps new since yesterday, but nothing about his life is ever
Blaise rolled his eyes but stood, snatching up the discarded newspaper. "Look, that was too far, I'll admit." Draco was desperate to try out that new hex, the one that would cause Blaise's teeth to bite himself every time he opened his mouth. But he resisted, as he always did with his chatty scrotum of a friend. "But we're not through talking about this," Blaise went on. "Potter's seeing you professionally? You're seeing Potter
"Really?!" Scorpius danced on his toes, eyes shining, cheeks rosy, looking so much like a happy childhood that Harry couldn't help but marvel. He stood, knees numb, and nearly jumped when Draco took his hand. They laced their fingers together in a perfect fit, snowflakes swirling around them as Scorpius pet 'Hedwig,' and, inexplicably, Harry felt...
and I can take care of myself!" His voice cracked at the end, which was really poor timing. Just one more round of puberty potions, he reminded himself. He wanted to break something, but settled on picking up and throwing down the Daily Prophet again.
“So your Prince Charming has gone away,” Draco says in a sing-song voice. “Whatever will you do with yourself now?”
" - but he decorated all the cakes so they let 'im stay on. This one time," Arty broke off in a giggle and James knew he would hate whatever was coming next. "This one time, he fell asleep in the back durin' his break - "
acting like a petulant child as he folded his arms and crossed his ankles, he just didn't want to get into this right now. "So, you - you became an auror...because of
But James had already lifted his head and was gazing at Draco in delayed wonder. Surely he was imagining things.
Malfoy paused, perhaps waiting to see if Harry was truly done talking, then said rather stiffly, "Certainly. Come on back to my office and we'll get started." He opened his arm in a gesture before retreating back down the hallway, and Harry followed.
"Wha'd'ye reckon they meant about Mum's family?" Arthur asked lightly, scratching the wrinkly, fleshy cat behind her ears. Alec barely spared him a glance before he shrugged. "I thought they were dead?"
to feel angry. He wanted that rage, or even a bit of sympathy for his idiot boyfriend, but...he just felt gutted instead. He felt the way Monty sounded. Scratchy and hollow.
He returned James's smile weakly before his eyes flicked back to the fridge. James caught his gaze and put on his trademark warning glare. With a surge of annoyance, Monty scowled at James instead of the letters and stepped around him to check on the batter swirling away in the stand mixer.
Monty's voice said regretfully. Arthur pressed his mobile a little tighter against his ear, not quite ready to end the conversation.
, James reminded him spitefully as he carried Anne and the box over to the window. The anger in his chest and the pain in his hip was making him nauseous. He hated this, he hated it so much, he was never right even when Monty was wrong and he just wanted this shit to
Potter’s back is burned to hell, large matching rings of angry, peeling, bubbling skin spaced evenly across it. The smell of burning skin and hair hits Draco like a train and he feels woozy again. Vince’s screams are ringing in his ears. The room tilts. Potter grabs his elbow, his hand sliding in the slick of Draco’s sweat in a decidedly less sexy way than just moments before, and drags him close. Potter frantically gathers their cloaks and the single thin sheet from the bed, throwing it into a haphazard pile on the floor. They stumble together onto the pile, huddling close, Potter’s arms holding Draco’s back tight against his chest. It’s a welcome reprieve from the heat of the brick floor, but now Draco’s all too aware of the rising temperature.
Magical security meant invisible wards. The wards on his shop were the opposite of what most of the wizarding world used; they were designed to repel witches and wizards, instead of Muggles. Several people were exceptions to this ward, including himself, his boys, the Weasleys, the Lupins, McGonagall, and a contingent of Aurors. Ron promised to escort the Malfoys through today.
And so he agreed to take the case without knowing anything else. And then her arsing Auror husband delivered a thick case file, marked CLASSIFIED in large official letters, and sent his world spiraling.
Even if Harry was dead, he deserved more than to simply disappear into oblivion. He deserved his last moments to be known. Ron would find those answers, he would find Harry if he was out there, but at the very least he would find what happened to his friend.
James glared at him and the skillet started sizzling in a nasty way. Monty gestured at their burning dinner, not really in the mood to wait for takeaway food to arrive. James turned down the heat and scraped the spoon across the skillet to break up the rapid cooking before setting spoon back down more forcefully than necessary.
"You-Know-Who was a megalomaniac," Hermione said firmly. "No one was safe from him, not even his followers."
. I daresay the lavatory isn't decked out in edibles." He shivers despite the heat, then wonders whether he should pound on the door to request a trip to the loo. Then he could get Potter out of here. He isn't looking so fresh.
James moved to the sofa last night and had no intention of going back to bed with Monty anytime soon, no matter how many times the man apologized. He was apologizing for the wrong things anyway. He was sorry for screaming, for saying certain things, but not for...for whatever it was that happened yesterday. James had never seen Monty like that. It was
True to his word, the man at the counter seemed determined to close up shop despite the potential for business on a mild summer night. He cleared the crowd at top speed and within minutes, Remus found himself the last customer.
James gave himself another sharp shake of the head, focusing on here and now. On their hands. On Draco.
Monty felt properly dazed for the first time since he and his sister had lost their parents, nearly ten years ago. James's words were ringing in his mind. Not once had he accused him of jealousy, like he usually did. Now it was control. James saw him as an evil puppet master, pulling the strings of his life. Driving people away, manipulating how others saw them, deliberately distracting James from - okay, that one was true, but it was in James's best interest! James needed to stay busy, even if he tended to self-destruct under certain types of pressure, and Monty was only trying to help.
"Right. Soggy." Potter firms his jaw again and ducks his gaze to fumble with his fly. The trousers hit the floor and Draco tries, he really does, but he just can't
"Well, that's a first for you!" Malfoy was positively screechy now, though not quite yelling. "We're not
, James explained in that slow and careful way he had when he was trying to avoid an explosion from the boys. Or Monty. Not that Monty exploded, of course. It wasn't that James was delicate...but loud, angry arguments weren't right for him. So Monty tried his damndest to avoid them, even when the stubborn arse was pushing for one.
Arty pursed his lips and James glared at him. It seemed to lose some heat through the traitorous tears.
He should've stayed home that day, but instead he came in and promptly spilled a huge vat of custard on himself. James had cheerily given him a set of his own clothes so they could carry on with Tuesday's work. So there he was, alone in the upstairs flat, freshly showered, wearing a pair of joggers - Blaise could never know - and that hideous mustard-yellow hooded jumper that James was so fond of. But it was soft and the weight of it was oddly comforting and it smelled fresh and clean, like James.
Alec nodded dutifully. Arthur sent him a grateful look before shoving past Dad and heading upstairs to get to work. Dad's standards for chores were ridiculous, especially when he was on a tiff.
“Don’t you work in Technology?” Cedric D., wearing a flashy, multicolored apron, pipes up from the back of the room. Seamus fusses with his own black tunic.
His sarcasm never translated as well as Monty's when he signed so he decided to keep things neutral.
"Hmm, mhmm..." Sirius hummed, sounding far wiser than Harry had ever known him to be. He flicked the letter back at Harry's head, looking pensive and strangely pleased. "He invited you to lunch, you say? How about dinner at ours?"
But cruelly addictive. By its very nature, Prism was an imitation. Like a boggart: powerful and effective, but not quite true. Instead of putting someone to sleep once to set them back on track, it would wreak havoc on their sleep cycle, prompting them to seek the potion over and over again. And while it would regrow a bone, the pain of the regrowth would never fade, not even with a pain reliever like what Draco was testing for Potter now. They would seek out Prism as a pain reliever, again and again and again…
“You want to help, I understand,” he interrupted, barely sparing the man a glance. “You can assist with a direct translation. Mr. Charming, have you ever experienced flashbacks to your lost memories?”
"Why. Am I. Here." He saw Harry's face fall but he couldn't care less. He was near seething at this point. Nine hours of being whisked away all over the world by clumsy riddles and questionably attained Portkeys! He was not in the mood for any more games.
Skull-and-crossbones mug in hand, Harry quietly closed the cupboard and watched the back of Remus’s head. Though the shed wasn’t visible from here, he was looking outside now instead of pretending to read his paper, no doubt thinking of Harry’s workspace. Reluctantly, Harry returned to the table, setting down Sirius’s mug and pouring the tea.
Alec sighed and pulled something out of his pocket. Dad's latest mobile phone. He was supposed to have it with him whenever he left the house - like earlier, when he went out to run an errand and pick up the take-away - but really he just used it to text the others and send dumb pictures to Monty. And of course, the boys had to have their mobiles on them at all times.
Potter rolls his de-spectacled eyes and moves to his feet, heaving Draco up by his armpits. Draco shuffles his feet and they stumble over to the bed, where Potter drops him unceremoniously atop their clothes.
"What on earth do you have to be sorry about, your hair?" Draco's mouth was curled in a teasing smile, but his striking grey eyes were worried. He reached out as if to knock the dust loose from his hair, but Harry flinched back and he retreated. "I have seen a bird's nest before yours, you know, I won't fall to pieces seeing you without your hat..."
It certainly wasn't about Potter's cool rejection at the start of their first year. For Merlin's sake, they were children back then. He shouldn't have gone after the Weasel right off the bat like that, and Lord Potter, Conquering Savior and God of Merciful Wizengamot Testimonies, should have given Draco's shitty eleven-year-old manners a second chance.
"Monty and Da' used tae work at a bakery," Arty was saying now, capturing everyone's attention. "Da' was pants at breads - "
The tree was crammed into the corner of the sitting room between the stuffy old armchair and the boxy old telly. It was a skinny, awkward, artificial thing, but the limbs were so packed full of homemade ornaments and paper tinsel, one could hardly see the fake pine needles anyway. The pine-scented air freshener that Alec stuffed somewhere into the middle helped a lot too.
works especially hard in the Beauty Department, doesn't he?" she retorts. Cedric falls silent and Harry looks at his lap, scratching the back of his head.
"They'll come to ours when they've finished giving their statements at the Ministry," came the eventual reply, though it sounded stilted, awkward. Draco nodded. Staying under the roof of an Auror was the best option, of course. "I should head back, actually. I only wanted you to know everything's - "
Arthur nodded conspiratorially and Dad levitated the pot, picked up his cane, and together they creeped back upstairs.
"Okay!" he readily agreed. And then, before he processed what was happening, Draco tipped over in a deep, mocking bow, righted himself, and Apparated away. Harry blinked at the empty spot where Draco had just stood in the road, then looked both ways down the rural lane.
he asked, dropping the folder on the coffee table. Arthur froze and Alec cringed. Monty's brows shot up toward his hairline and James gestured at the folder.
The door cracked open and James heard Draco whisper his name. He lifted his head, gesturing for him to join him in Ron and Hermione's guest room.
For now, he had nothing to do but light a low fire, climb into his warm nest of blankets, and watch the stars.
The bird looked angry, but unharmed. He got a swift clip from a sharp beak, but he managed to appease the ginger owl by agreeing to finally write a reply. It would be the first time he'd written Charming-Bugger-Potter since he ended their professional arrangement two weeks ago. Her owner would be pleased, no doubt, and the owl seemed chuffed that she had at least earned this much through her suffering.
Monty signed, brows raised, eyes wide, hands already coming out to massage James's not-sore-thank-you-very-much shoulders.
"No, yes, you're right," he sighed. "People are not stupid. They just don't know any better yet." Scorpius nodded in satisfaction and Mr. James expression lifted into the same teasing smile that Mummy used.
"Yeah," he nodded, looking just as incredulous. "When he got the summons, they had some row - she and Lucius Malfoy - about putting the family in danger again. Can't imagine
"I have it!" Potter shouts into his face, resting a steadying hand on his shoulder while brandishing a long thin metal wire. "We need to get to the door!"
He closed the shop an hour early. It would have been two hours early, but he didn't have Monty's booming voice to usher people out so he had to settle for gesturing stupidly at a few customers during a rare lull.
Potter whips around again to look at him, hopping from foot to foot. Draco looks down and nearly throws up. Potter’s bare feet are searing right before their eyes. All at once, Draco can feel the heat through his socks.
But he had promised himself a heaping box of chocolates if he could make three visits today, and by Merlin he would get it.
, he insisted that evening as they washed up after dinner. The boys were bouncing around upstairs, causing the ceiling to shake. James was grateful for that brilliant
“I suffered just the one incident and, before you ask, Blaise has been cleared of all suspicion by your little Auror friends. He was drugged to sleep in his office.”
From the cramped little space between the floor and the oven flap, he twisted his head up to peer cautiously through the little tinted window. The room flashed again, somehow even brighter than before. Rachel swore under the din of thunder and threw up a strong shield charm just as a bolt of lightning shot into the ceiling over their heads, breaking up and forking in every direction. A bolt of white-hot light darted toward the oven over James's head, but it hit the shield and fizzled out.
Today is like any other, or at least it starts this way, or at least Harry thinks it starts. He has no way of knowing what's morning or night. Fin has never maintained a regular schedule. Sometimes the tall, broad-chested ex-Military man is gone for days, sometimes he seems like he never leaves. Today, when Harry wakes, he is alone, as he has been for quite some time. He hoists himself up off the metal bed frame - having long forgiven the bed for his humiliation in the Lenny Days - and helps himself to the supply bin of food.
Harry takes a seat between Ginny and Ron W., who thumps him on the back fondly. Cormac M., on Ron’s other side, is deep in conversation with Cho C. about the various benefits of vitamins on all aspects of the body, from hair and fingernails to muscle mass and bone strength. As the final few employees - all from a wide array of departments - slowly fill in the rest of the seats, Bellatrix shoots a look over to Mr. Percy Weasley - another suit with a gold name-tag.
The room is silent. Draco can hear his own shallow breathing, Potter's raspy huffs. He can hear the crackling of the wall-mounted torches around them. Potter twists his wrist, shifts his arm, angles his shoulders—there's a distinct click. Draco twitches, but the woman doesn't. She hasn't heard the door unlock.
Scorpius clamored up into the office chair and stood on his knees to reach the desk. He pulled a piece of his father's finest stationery close and began to write. He chose to use the special purple ink to make up for the delay. Not because it was pretty.
“ - buying the first round, yeah, yeah,” Harry finished, trying to appear less wrong-footed than he felt. He’d never bought drinks at a bar before. This one had leather padding nailed into the edge and he delighted in leaning his forearms against it like he was a
him. Draco obliges, pressing a lump of creamy fudge onto Potter’s tongue. His fingers wrap around that stubbled chin, easing his mouth closed. His thumb passes lightly over Potter’s bottom lip and his fingertips feel the nearly silent groan in Potter’s throat, and the room is
They circled it, one walking clockwise and the other walking anti-clockwise. He caught his breath and focused on trailing his fingertips over the wall. He loved the feeling of wood, loved how it was rough and rugged at first but could be sanded down to velvet, and eventually - given enough time in the open air, in the elements - it would return to a gnarled, beaten, experienced state of being, like it had been as a tree.
Tony and Nott seemed to understand what had been said. In one motion, Nott threw Arthur at Draco, who grunted in his dazed state on the loveseat but wrapped his arms around him protectively, still as strong as ever. James grabbed Alec in a bruising grip, shoving him past the table and into Narcissa's waiting arms, who caught him around the middle and held tight.
. "I believe you can only improve further if you leave the nest yourself. Learn to fly. Girl Weasley can assist there, but I certainly can't do anything more for you."
He'd been hoping to make it more of a labeled Thing today, with the dessert dick he'd made from Monty's candy mold, but it was too much. Much too much, much too crude for someone as smooth and effortless as Draco.
Narcissa abandoned her struggle to smash the heavy porcelain teapot over Nott's skull. She snatched the wand out of his hands like she was taking a sweet away from a naughty child. But even disoriented by a blow to the head, Nott was fast. Just as Narcissa sent a powerful silent stunning spell his way, he whipped out another wand from his pocket - it was Draco's - and threw one last curse:
"Yer da' an' I've been building forts all year while you've been away," he said loudly. A thumping sound came from the boys' bedroom; did Dad drop a trunk? "Movies and popcorn, Doctor Who every night in our fort," he went on, practically shouting. Alec frowned at him in suspicion.
Malfoy was coming. He was bringing some wizard twit too, hopefully as a date. James had already sent out notes to Ron, Dean, and Seamus to give them a heads up about the incoming Slytherins. Asking them to play nice and not choose this week to cancel. He didn't ask Monty to play nice and not cancel. He
"Your department's just you, isn't it?" Harry calls across the Beauty floor as he pushes his cart of Women's inventory toward the back room.
When he unwrapped his set of microtools, Alec squealed so loudly the cat took off into another room at high speed. James grinned over at Monty, who offered a wink back at him. Arthur scored a new set of brushes from Dean - who he hadn't met yet - and immediately demanded to go to the gallery the next day for the Sunday workshop.
"Haz," Malfoy agreed after a moment of hesitation, then waited. It took a long moment before Harry realized he still needed an answer.
"That doesn't permit you to yap at our heels endlessly with your inane questions! I won't hear another word of this frivolous gossip! Don't you have footage to fire?"
Alec jerked violently and the contraption slipped through his fingers and hit the desk. Static took over and started rising in volume while Arthur leapt to his feet.
Florean Fortescue had always been a kindly man. Harry remembered fondly the days he spent doing homework outside the ice cream parlor, when the man brought him free sundaes every hour and offered bits of knowledge here and there. And today, as Harry went to pay for his order, Florean narrowed his eyes and quirked his head.
Arthur shuffled through the teeming pile of letters on the kitchen table, finally landing on what he thought was the start of it all.
, is what she meant. "When he began courting you, he brought you to a Quidditch match. You will return the favor."
over his head at Draco. The corners of his lips twitched - not quite a smile, not entirely a grimace - and they tucked in as well.
Harry returned to his seat, limping all the way and giving Alec a squeeze on his shoulder as he passed. Arthur sat next to his brother and then Harry started back into his sign language.
He kept his gaze trained on the window as she brought the visitors around the bed. There was a gasp and someone swore.
"But - but..." Draco was far more drunk than James. He was rather handsy, too. Smiling stupidly, James let Draco reach across the table to latch onto both of his wrists. It felt nice. His long pale fingers were strong but soft. He thought those nimble fingers could have the potential to do some brilliant work in the proper setting.
“My relatives never liked me. It’s not surprising...they didn’t like my mum marrying my dad, didn’t approve of that sort of thing. Thought she should
"If the Aurors are through and Mr. Charming is feeling up for it, you may go at any time. We'll get you a fresh supply of your potions from our own stock."
"That would be your old familiar, Hedwig." His heart was hammering in his chest. Complete amnesia, ha! Not bloody likely. Harry was still in there somewhere, he acted too much like himself to be anyone else, whatever name he was going by these days.
But, he did trust the man, so they signed the forms and went to lunch. The energy left fluttering in him from their meditation was dampened only by the knowledge that he couldn't bear to betray Draco's trust in
Charming Chocolates was a tiny establishment squeezed between a loudly colored tea shop and a boutique that seemed to mostly cater to elderly women. Bright red awning, trimmed in gold, covered the front of the chocolate shop, and a matching red door carried a sign:
"I do like him," Harry finally blurted out, ending the silence. "He invited me to lunch today after we looked at some houses..." He flicked his wrist to fling the letter to Sirius, who read it with a furrowed (and then raised) brow.
Ohhh bugger… Harry's cheeks heated enough to fog his glasses and he whipped them off, wiping them on his wool coat.
“Well, yeah,” he admits. “But that don’t mean I don’t have eyes! I gotta walk past Men’s to get to tech in the back, don’t I? An' I should get to see two plastic blokes get it on just the same as the straight couple in Hawaiian shirts by Luggage & Travel!”
Monty stared at him helplessly and James refused to meet his eyes. He perched on the stool behind the register and resigned himself to minding the counter this week. Monty had to create an entire inventory of baked goods, after all, so he had priority access to the kitchen.
“Always happy to help them meet their quarterly targets,” he goes on viciously, stretching his arms overhead as if he doesn’t have an audience scribbling notes. “Don’ wanna be too greedy with ma hours. Just below full-time is perfect, if you ask me - “
Monty reached down and righted James's chair, squinting suspiciously at Alec, who was peaking at Minerva with obvious distrust.
nonsense, we have children too, you know." James glared at the table. "He may have started it, but you finished it. You told him to leave. Do you regret that now?"
He packed up the game dejectedly. It wasn't even eleven, they could stay up until midnight on weekends. What a waste of a Saturday. Dad hobbled away behind him and fiddled with the boombox mounted on the far counter.
His mind's eye found a warm yellow-pine floor with deep brown knots and streaks of grain. A plush rug appeared quite without his invitation, and he even spotted a stone hearth beginning to take shape right ahead of him.
Draco waited and just when he thought his method of extracting more information wouldn't work this time, James went on.
"I'm sorry," Harry tried again. The fine layer of sawdust he'd disturbed was floating in the air between them, coating his throat and making it all that much harder to get the words out. "I'm
He caught the little bugger before he hit the ground - well, before his face hit the ground, at any rate - and set him upright on the ground.
, I'm certain there's a bag of mallowmarshes somewhere. They carried it in the corner shop before Voldecorp came along and shut them down."
Curiously—he’s never done anything like this before—Draco leans in. His Adam's apple meets Potter's growing cock through his pants and he presses down, hard. It's the stiffest thing Draco's ever felt against his throat and he yearns to
. Even Dean and Seamus were catching on to Harry's rising temper, but Malfoy remained blissfully unaware of the danger until Harry snapped. Literally - he snapped a huge bar of chocolate into bits and started hurling the pieces at Malfoy's head from across the kitchen. Ron was starkly reminded of when Harry threw a Potter Stinks badge at his forehead in fourth year, except this showing was much more pathetic. At first Malfoy laughed, but then the bits kept flying and Malfoy resorted to throwing them back just as ferociously. Both of them being drunk off their arses, not a single piece hit the mark, but the message was clear.
James asked sarcastically as he reclosed the box and began to tie it up with twine. Anne ruffled her feathers, eyeing Monty in reproach, but stuck out her leg to carry the box.
He exhaled, breath shuddering, and hobbled off the train. Monty, for once, didn't say anything. They went for ice cream.
"Are you alright, James?" Remus asked quietly. It occurred to him in that moment that Harry had never invited them to call him anything but 'Mr. Charming.' In fact, Harry had yet to say a word.
He considered talking to Malfoy about Monty. The man was suffocating him: going through his post to triple check the apothecary got the prescription right, since James was apparently too scatterbrained to notice; constantly bringing him his cane when he had only walked ten feet away from it; shutting off the stove when he still had one or two more batches to get through, claiming he had done enough for the day.
"Da' wears glasses," Alec muttered. Remus's gaze flicked over to Monty automatically before he remembered there was another father. James.
Harry opened the door of the Leaky and then promptly closed it again, relishing the thrill of casting his own
"You don't recognize us?" Remus breathed. Harry's eyes widened and he turned to Monty, pulling on his arm to get his attention. Harry began waving his hands about, making a series of gestures that were too specific to be meaningless…
, Charming," he continued, unveiling more hostility with each word. James sat back again, his back thumping against the chair and winding him slightly. "I don't just go blabbering about life-changing events to people like you. To
"You used a spell to push the Auror back, do you remember what it was?" Draco asked, struggling to keep the burning curiosity out of his voice.
"Why not?" Barred from the knob, Draco reaches overhead for the sugar crystals on the awning. With his few extra inches, he's safe from Potter's—
"Are ye sure ye want these little hell-spawns fer yer school?" he asked the professors lightly, popping an exquisitely roasted slice of potato into his gob.
The Aurors labeled the case cold after five years. Remus and Hermione tried to talk to him, tried to get him to maybe consider referring to Harry in the past tense... Mum and Dad hosted a private memorial service that summer, which Ron refused to attend because
James stared at him in sheer disbelief and Monty let himself ride that awful wave for a moment, the half-guilty, half-satisfied feeling that came from leaning into his petty thoughts.
"Call me Minerva," she replied, looking from Harry to Monty to Harry again. "I am sorry, I didn't catch your - "
read the plot description not even five minutes ago, after all, before Malfoy Side-Along Apparated him here. Before the puddles distracted him. "I thought you might use these coops to your advantage in your business. Any one of them could easily be refurbished as a crafting shop."
Remus thought he heard the ceiling creak, as if someone were walking around upstairs right above him. He didn't give it much thought - there were at least two Charming children in residence, after all. Then the boy climbed to his feet and lifted his head, looking perfectly contrite, and Remus felt all the air in his lungs whoosh out at once. He had seen that look a thousand times, he himself had helped James Potter
There's no smut here.  Just more pining and blue balls.  See that T-rating up there at the top?  Still relevant.  Calm down and eat some waffles.
And indistinct mumbling came through as static flared. Alec lifted the contraption a few inches off the desk, which seemed to calm it for some reason.
He shivers and makes to cast a warming charm, but Potter grabs his hand to stop him. Right. They've had enough warming charms to last them a lifetime. He eases back against the torn leather of the backseat, willing himself to stop shivering like a berk. He concentrates on all the layers of clothes keeping him warm. A gentle, non-threatening warmth. Potter hasn't let go of his hand.
There was a tunnel they drove through, he could recall that much. Orange lights on the concrete walls slowed until they were at a stand-still, underground. Harry's chest tightened and he couldn't breathe properly. Draco's voice was muffled, as if on the other side of that blasted iron door, and despite a constant stream of
Harry takes him to bed and Draco protests all the way, offers to sleep on the cursed sofa, offers to give him his space. He doesn't want to crowd. He doesn't want to be where he's not wanted, and he's clearly not wanted in bed.
The Days of Lenny are filled with cold skin and aching bones, and the only privacy to be found is when he crams himself under the bed, feigning sleep.
Blaise said nothing. Draco handed him a dropper. Together, they finished testing the rest of the shipment in silence.
James crossed his arms and leaned back against the window-frame, coincidentally blocking the boys from the view of the platform. From the
he asked Monty earlier that Sunday afternoon when the man came to check on him for the umpteenth time.
Four days before Sunday's tentatively-scheduled unveiling, Harry was pacing his workshop and wringing his hands, which had proven to be useless for putting the finishing touches on Luna’s broom, which was meant to be done by now, which made him officially late on his very first commission, which meant his new business was a failure and he shouldn’t be blowing all his money on a stupid house he didn’t need --
"She's stronger than she looks," he whispers, recalling her surprising strength when she hauled them to their feet after dinner.
forgetting his wand. He couldn't even summon the vial. After a long while, when he thought his heart rate had returned to normal, he shakily pulled himself up the ladder and used twine to hang the signs from the ceiling beams. It took a bit of finagling to set them straight - had Alec stolen his level? - but the end result looked professional enough. Quaint and simple, but clean and straight. They could have called it a proper confectionary shop now.
Then Abbott - sweet, beautiful, icky-girl Abbott - had just casually mentioned a handy little translation spell that her own Deaf father used for those outside of the Abbott family. That glorious Abbott family that was the answer to all of Draco's problems (pertaining to the communication hurdles in this particular case, at least). She gave Draco a book, The Magical Guide to Learning BSL, by WhoCares SomeWitch, which included moving illustrations for each letter, word, and phrase, and an incredible index system. If he ever wanted to learn sign language, he would certainly start there.
"Harry - " Hermione stepped closer and the room was too small, five paces across just like the bunker, and he couldn't breathe and everyone was staring at him and Sirius was
Heart light and hip barely thrumming, James turned in the hall as Monty started to pull away to go to the sofa. He touched the man's arm and nodded to the bedroom door. The only way to make things more perfect would be to curl up together tonight and open the shop late tomorrow. He smiled in invitation, but Monty didn't meet his eye.
"You're both rude," he announced. "Daddy, you better not tattle or say bad words no more, or I'll tell Grandmum on you."
"Not on my life," Harry said sincerely. The man was brilliant. Florean awarded him a roaring laugh, and they were free.
Looking back later, Draco could narrow it down to several triggers: Scorpius was with his mother, leaving Draco alone with his parents; Blaise was pining after Greg, who was in hospital, and cursing Nott, whose shop was still under Ministry investigation, leaving Draco alone with his parents; finally, in his infinite Mind Healer wisdom, he was able to acknowledge to himself how much he
But there he was, shivering in a jacket too thin for kneeling in an open field in February, his gloveless hands wrapped around a simple black velvet box.
She did not appreciate the theatrics, but she left without hexing him, so he counted it as a victory.
"You actually did it!" snorted Al, crawling forward to reach Helen. The sparks had died down but James could swear those eyes were glowing. It was a fucking fire hazard, he didn't know why he let Al keep it. "You actually hid her under the bed, how long - I cannae believe - just
He's never been so ill in his life and he can't help but wish the bastard Ben would make an appearance. His whole body tenses up as he expels a weak foamy bile into the toilet. He can't seem to push hard enough, because there's nothing left to give. He hasn't eaten in ages, long before Ben fucked off to who knows where, and hasn't been able to keep down more than a few sips of tap water since he woke.
"I've been in this forest a thousand times," the shivering idiot claims through chattering teeth. "I know how to get out."
He felt James's eyes burning into his back and he slapped the stand mixer back on, setting it on high. The loud whirring sound cut into the radio that was playing another damn car commercial, the loud one with the nasally English voice that reminded Monty of - surprise surprise - that posh Malfoy twat.
letter, pleased as punch that he hadn't fudged up with Scorpius today. On the contrary, he'd done something well. Something helpful. Something
"He wouldn' say what. Just said he an' Monty are goin' through somethin'. Said they're tryin' to work it out but it's just hard cos they're both thick."
“I’m not lonely while you two are at work, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Harry offered, hoping Sirius would come down soon and change the subject. “I’ve already got more comp--”
Barking back and forth, their words teeter just on the edge of cutting. Potter, returning the favor, crams a truffle against Draco’s mouth to break him off mid-rant. His teeth sink into firm dark chocolate, a flood of cherry ganache cutting across the bittersweet shell. The combination sings in his mouth and he hums his pleasure. Potter twitches…and grins like an idiot.
"Yep," was all he could think to say. He was vaguely aware of another snort of laughter at his expense from the Muggle men across the room.
The acrid stench of burning reached his nose and he panicked for a moment, lifting the glass bowl to peer underneath for any signs of damage. None. He had a batch of chestnuts roasting in the oven, but as he poked through them with a spat, he couldn't find any char at all. The fudge was cooling in the fridge. So what was burning?
Draco caught the ghost of a smirk on James’s lips as Blaise sighed and left, taking his tea with him.
The slab of peppermint-pocked chocolate swings open with a whoosh and Draco's nose is assaulted with sugar and spice and everything nice. He claws his way out of Potter's brutish grasp.
"DADDY, I FELL!" Scorpius took off into the house, his trainers slapping on the pristine, shining hardwood floor, and left Harry at the door staring back at the small crowd of roaming couples.
"Please, I am a Mind Healer on the forefront of my profession," he said with his best scoff. "I wouldn't presume to judge someone who is happy."
"Draco, son," Lucius huffed, blowing a loose lock out of his face. "We can use this to our advantage! We can send a Portkey back and - "
he barked, glaring down at the mess in offense. James took advantage of the interruption to clear the lump in his throat. “Would you like something to drink?” Malfoy asked suddenly, loudly, before levitating a hospitality tray over to the desk. He went to pour another glass but James jumped up to do it himself. He needed to do something. “Help yourself…” he muttered, pulling his hands back and holding them in the air, as if unsure what to do with them. James sent a false sneer over the desk before settling back into his chair with his glass. “So. You obviously kept the brats.” James squinted in a mock glare to accompany his false sneer. “How’d you get them home? You must tell me after all this build-up. It’s like a locked-room mystery, I can’t figure it out!”
With the lights off, the shop was shadowed and gloomy, but still warm. A quaint little street lamp just outside threw soft orange through the storefront window and he was just able to distinguish the familiar shapes and pieces that made up his shop. The displays were all recycled furniture he had spent an entire summer transforming into things he could use. A reclaimed manicure station was perhaps the oddest bit, but surprisingly versatile. It displayed their luxury chocolates in a series of little tiers that once held dozens of bottles of varnish, and its long sweeping counter was perfect for larger samples packed into gift boxes.
"So he's all ba himself, thinks everyone else is hours late but cannae call anyone tae ask," Arty carried on delightedly. "He starts on the orders - which're really the next day's orders - an' when he's finished 'em off, he gets
No one else ventures an answer and the seminar continues. Bellatrix reads from a manual for twenty minutes and then a television on a cart is wheeled in. The lights are flicked off as the training video begins:
These days, however, that pale, pointed face was perfectly polite, and even nicer to look at. Sharp grey eyes tuned to James’s face (or the smoke coming out of his possessed wand). Long fingers folded precisely together atop a rich mahogany desk. Back straight as an arrow, making James feel a bit like a slob and a bit like a rebel as he slouched in the blue-upholstered guest chair. James knew without a doubt that if it were fifteen years ago, they wouldn’t sit calmly, albeit awkwardly, on either side of a polished desk. They’d go for each other’s throats.
Only a spectacular idiot would approach centaurs. They're not younglings anymore and Firenze—a traitor to his own kind—isn't likely to come to their rescue if they're caught. Draco follows Potter's lead and they creep away through the undergrowth.
Narrow, waist-high bookshelves were lined up strategically to create aisles that the customers could browse near the front, without overcrowding the already cramped space. Along the walls were a variety of "shelves," which were mostly made of planks of wood rescued from the cupboards that had been falling apart in the kitchen before it was refinished as well.
Mr. James looked a bit stunned. It was a pitiful sight at his tea table and Scorpius decided take the man under his wing, so to speak.
"Got a date?" Sirius swung his weight around the doorframe dramatically and Harry startled, his cheeks flushing. Sirius grinned dopily at him, hanging from the doorframe at a 45-degree angle.
"Where are they staying tonight?" he interrupted, still facing away. There was a long pause. Scorpius was looking between them suspiciously.
"Wants us to come round for dinner," Ron answered, looking as if he'd just come across an acromantula in his teacup. "Well, he was looking for Remus and McGonagall, but once I explained who I was, he invited us along too. Said to bring anything and everything that would get
Ron snorted, and his voice was rough with sleep, while Harry had never felt so awake. "Not luck. Narcissa Malfoy turned her husband in the minute he came home in that mask."
"You'd do well to invest in more headwear," Blaise observed mildly as he folded up the paper. "It will take ages to regrow without hair potions."
He retrieves another pot of Dirty Dirt and Potter passes him the good trowel. They set to work in comfortable silence.
James woke to an owl tapping on their bedroom window. He could hear Monty singing, impossibly loud and off key, in the shower down the hall. He heaved a relieved sigh and the tightness in his chest began to ease. The excitement of the Quidditch game had finally won the old jolly Monty back after almost two weeks of bland conversation, quiet mornings, and no sex. Maybe he could join him in the shower today.
"A bit of furniture from all of us," Hermione said with a nod at the bookcase on the far wall. "Neville did the greenery - " And only now did Harry notice the sheer number of plants around the space, soaking up all the sun coming through the windows overhead and on the walls. " - Ginny and Luna made that desk. " Which was a sweet gesture, if a bit crooked, he noted, gazing at the hand-made and madly painted desk in the corner by the shelves.
Monty hooked a pinky around his finger as they took in the hustle and bustle of Platform 9 & ¾. James took a cleansing breath. Ron and Hermione flanked them, disguised as a nondescript strawberry-blond couple, and a multitude of Aurors were scattered about the platform (or so James was told). Monty's hair was black, which looked strange and wrong against his skin.
He was proud of Monty. Sure, he was a bit stiff tonight, not his usual friendly self, and he had a brief row with Ron's portable Wireless. And yeah, there were a few embarrassing moments - one incident with the chair that left James mortified - but overall, he didn't stick to his side like glue, didn't pick a fight with Malfoy, didn't even sulk upstairs like James suspected he might. He was coming around. The rush of hope he felt at that realization told James that perhaps he had been far more concerned about their relationship than he had even admitted to himself. He was well and truly hopeful that this was the first solid step toward working past Monty's control issues.
With great effort, Potter lowers his voice. He's visibly trembling, and not from the cold. It's been at least a month since Draco has gotten him this worked up. Maybe he should let it go. They were having a perfectly nice midday stroll before the damn centaurs set them off.
half the night, for shit's sake, but James couldn't spare Monty half an hour last week to hash out their own issues? They might as well have fed each other grapes off the stem with the way James was hanging onto every over-pronounced, multi-syllabic, posh cunty word from Malfoy's mouth. It made Monty sick to his stomach.
at least, as much sense as you were capable of making at the time. And I said that calling you by your - by
“So what did you do?” Malfoy asked, sounding as surprised and bewildered as James had felt in that moment all those years ago.
James shook his head sharply to jar his mother's desperate voice from his ears. It seemed to make him look a bit more mad because Nott faltered again, taking a step back. He reached out and snatched Arthur out of Tony's hands, earning an indignant squawk from the boy.
He wasn't even sure Monty was wrong anymore, though he could have done without the mild cardiac episode.
"Hum? So, yours was...Scorpium?" He only just caught himself before he tried to guess Scorpius's mum's name was
"Yer no' afraid?" he continued as he poured more soap across the remaining dishes. "Only, ye said after the train incident..." And after the nightmare in September, and after the Portkey back to their shop following the Quidditch match… James
"Why do you keep harping on about that?" he says shortly. "Because of the man-sized cauldron? I'll admit, it's rather sizeable, but that's no reason—"
More witches and wizards invaded their kitchen that night than even his sneaky bastard of a lover had anticipated. Food was carted in by their guests, plates were conjured from thin air, the table was magically expanded, and chairs were transfigured out of James's favorite wooden spoons.
James moved to protest and Draco nearly wrenched him across the table to crush his lands against his warm chest.
It was a Muggle photo taken outdoors somewhere, perhaps a park. Arthur and Alec posed in front of a relatively young man that had draped himself over their shoulders, grinning broadly at the camera as he curled his arms up and ruffled the hair of each boy. The man wore a beaten up Muggle cap on his head but Remus could see locks of wild black hair poking out from under it. Most damning of all, though mostly obscured by the hat, was a familiar jagged line that cut down from his forehead over his right eye, looking very much like the tail-end of a bolt of lightning. And those green eyes sparkled at him, happily...
Two hours later, he was discharged from St. Mungo's with a nerve tonic and a calming draught, though he wasn't particularly nervous. Jittery, certainly, but that was more from the excess of magical electricity that had his hair standing on end. Draco begged off work early to escort him to the Manor, where he would stay for the next week or so while the crime scene in his kitchen was sorted. The man laughed maniacally as he ran his hands through James's sky-scraping tresses.
That was why Monty pitched a royal fit when James stopped bringing him along to therapy. Merlin. Things were making sense for the first time in
Regarding that last scene between Draco and Astoria - note that this takes place the day after the Daily Prophet article that painted Harry as a damsel in distress, which is a sore spot for James. I didn't feel the need to lay it out word-for-word how Draco managed to hurt James's feelings, but you can safely assume that he used that angle to tease him and it stung a little too much. This should be more clear in the next chapter, but some people seem to think there's a glitch that deleted a scene...nope, it's "missing" because I never wrote it. :)
They all slept on a makeshift pallet on the floor, like a nest of animals. The boys crowded in on Draco's side, keeping Scorpius between them. James was left on the end, twitching and puttering about like an idiot, until Draco grabbed his arm and wrapped it around his own waist decisively.
"No, no, not at all! It was just a convenient base - hormone blockers and accelerators, when they're prepared properly, they're very expensive because they take months to make. But this was more like an instant-recipe, provided you could afford a basic love potion. Apparently it's tricky to add anything else to the potion regimen, even a Pepper-Up, not without severe interactions - so it's not a popular long-term choice for people who actually
catch me, but I was too clever for them, I got away.” Draco sucks in a deep breath to calm himself. He smiles, looking quite giddy, even proud. Harry bites his lip, apparently trying to hold back a laugh.
“Don’t!” Harry pushed Sirius away on instinct, his stomach clenching as if he’d been punched. His godfather shouldn't have been easy to push over but he toppled backwards onto his arse anyway, bewildered and hurt. Harry was sorry for it, but also he wasn’t, so much. “Don’t…”
"I was gone for two days!" They were acting as if he hadn't killed Voldemort, escaped Death Eaters, and then survived
“Bit weird to misspell the name of your own pub,” Harry observed drily at Draco’s guffaw. “Maybe it was a new employee?” Draco glanced at him with wide eyes and tilted his head in a skeptical,
“Oh yes, these earrings are made from a precious rare gemstone known for immortality! It’s priceless!”
the mirror crowed for the umpteenth time, but for once it failed to elicit a smile. His new glasses were wirey, square-ish, and the lenses tinted a cobalt blue in the sun. The Healers were clear that he needed to protect his eyes after so many years in the dark. He picked them out in an optics shop during his first week “home,” on a rare trip to the nearest Muggle town. Now, even when they tinted, his vision was always colored by the sky on his first cloudless day above ground.
And he missed Malfoy's company. He would grudgingly admit that if he was unwilling to share his Monty-troubles with Malfoy, then perhaps he had gotten all he could from therapy. But that didn't mean they couldn't still talk. Or...was he turning into a clingy nightmare patient that demanded his doctor's personal time as well as professional? They had fun at the Quidditch game and half their sessions included nothing at all related to therapy. They often just bantered, laughed, teased, and shared; they talked about Malfoy's family and friends nearly as much as James's. Had James misread that as friendship? But then why had Malfoy been so hurt when James didn't pry into the incident in October? When he didn't treat him as a proper friend?
Blades of grass were still poking up through the layer of snow, but Scorpius had indeed managed a snowbird. Harry blinked and felt an entirely unexpected block of emotion hit him.
He heard Sirius come in this time and rushed to look busy, knocking over the open pot of stain on the bench. He growled. He could do precisely
for once. Some parts he had to take with a grain of salt; they sounded like Malfoy was just showing off how many words he knew and how many flavors he could recognize. But other parts… James had never felt like this before. He was overwhelmed, even more so than earlier, but it was all good things now. He read and re-read certain parts, the parts that called him Clever and Capable, Discerning and Inventive. Proficient.
"They're alive? Shit, turn it down!" Arthur covered his ears with his hands as the static became overwhelmingly loud. Alec hastily picked up the device and spun the volume knob several times, to no effect. He shook the contraption roughly and several pieces rattled about inside before he tried again. This time the volume returned to a reasonable level and the static faded as he lifted it into the air again.
But the sounds were enough. The awful sound of the firepoker shooting through Nott's thigh and skewering Tony's chest, that would haunt him forever. Nott's guttural scream of pain and then the first blasting curse, followed by the thud of Tony's arm hitting the wall of the corridor outside.
"I'm - Well, that's sort of a blessing and a curse, isn't it?" he said gently. "I lost my mum when I was a baby, too. But, I still miss her."
"Short one, for the love of god..." Al muttered, sinking his face into his hands in a way that made him look like his father.
"What year did you graduate?" Terry asked, eyes narrowing. Harry tried to keep his answer light and casual.
Draco stopped breathing for all of ten seconds as he considered how he must have been presenting himself to the world if someone thought he was dying of Muggle diseases. October wasn’t his proudest month, certainly, but had he really look so terrible? Why did Mum even let him out of the house like that?! When he returned to the Manor, he would be having serious words with the mirror in his wardrobe for this betrayal!
“Hey, Harry!” Her voice sounds oddly loud in the women’s clothing section; the ebb and flow of noise is muted by the fabric. Her pink employee tunic sports a sleek silver name-tag that reads
"So, Hermione here was on another case, sorting through the initial reports for that new law - real boring shite, mind you - when she stumbled upon...well, you."
Arthur laughed out loud at that but Draco didn't see what was funny. They went on and on like that, back and forth, until Arthur tripped up and added two things instead of one:
"Ach!" He pulled a hand through the blubbery half-dried paint that was smeared across his trousers now. "Oh well, need to feed the cat anyway..."
"Skin and bones," she crows in her fragile voice, pinching Potter's side and causing him to leap out of her reach with an undignified squawk. Serves him right for pinching Draco earlier. "Let's get you fattened up, yes…"
When I hear that song, I always think of the end of my wedding reception, when my new husband's family encircled (trapped) us and sang (chanted) this song for an eternity with their Minnesota accents while we awkwardly bobbed around in the middle.  When I hear that song, I get really really really uncomfortable.
Draco growled and rolled on top, apparently about to prove something very strange indeed, but miscalculated - the hammock dipped to the side, one or both of them squawked in panic, and they tumbled out onto the pine floor in a heap of blankets and limbs.
Shaking his head and resolutely ignoring the Auror guard that trailed him from room to room, James grabbed his cane and headed into the kitchen to get to work. A shiny black crystal was tied into his shoelaces, pressing against the top of his foot with every step. It was a gentle comfort.
The problem he faced now was getting Monty to come back into the bedroom. It seemed that James couldn't get any space from him except for the one bit of space he wanted to close, especially now that the boys were back.
"Showin' house," he blubbered into the ground, his cheek pressing sharply against an exposed root of the tree. Harry frowned, not understanding, then his head snapped up at the open house across the street.
Malfoy's business card had revealed, after some prodding with his wand, how to access the magical side of the building. He felt a little silly holding the doorknob while muttering the password, but then found himself - shoes dry, clothes dripping - in the clearly magical lobby of a small set of offices. The reception desk was manned - or womanned? - by a handsome - or pretty - person whose gender Harry couldn't quite place. The nameplate read Terry, which wasn't particularly helpful.
"Are you thinking of me as a kid because I act like one, or - or because you're my godfather and you're always kind-of supposed to?" Harry suggested. Ironically, he felt like a fraud to be having this discussion with his godfather, a proper adult (more or less), but the silence was answer enough. He waited him out.
Arthur seemed determined to avoid his brother's accusatory gaze and instead looked anywhere else - eventually noticing Remus.
“It seems like the sort of thing I’d do. Especially to you.” There. That was close enough, he reckoned. James scowled, sighed, set his mug down, and ran his hands through the bird’s nest on his head. Draco couldn’t see his face with his head ducked down like that, but he was willing to bet there was a glare in place for him.
Arthur creeped down the stairs and pushed the kitchen door open, only to find the light on and Dad at the stove, idly stirring something in a tall pot. Part of him knew he was caught, but the other part wondered what the hell he was idly stirring in the stainless steel pot that was reserved only for chocolate because it certainly couldn't be chocolate. Dad never tended his chocolate absentmindedly.
Two pink spots appear on Draco's high cheekbones, but Harry doesn't notice; his attention is firmly fixed on his ham and cheese sandwich as he wolfs it down. When Draco speaks again, his tone has turned stiff and cold.
"Mummy says Daddy was a rude little lout when he was my age," Scorpius informed the table. Daddy made a weird squeaky sound but Mummy was the one who had said the word, after all, so Scorpius couldn't get in trouble for repeating it. "She said he always got what he wanted but he didn't make the friends he needed." Scorpius liked that line. It sounded important and it always made Daddy turn pink.
James asked. It wasn't lost on him that just a couple weeks ago, Monty had been begging the same question of him. He had asked for space.
"Typical Gryffindor behavior," Malfoy scoffed, in one of his more expressive moments. "Do you find you're often driven to such exhibitionism? Merlin forbid the world forget your chivalry."
"Did your Muggles neglect to teach you manners?" he asks out of the corner of his mouth, flashing a dazzling smile at the witch when she peeks up at them. She smiles back, revealing a shelf of rotted teeth. Draco shudders and Potter leans over his shoulder again.
the man echoed incredulously. "'Sorry, Monty,' s'all a ever hear from ya, but never a word'a explanation, no! Up tae no good, a know better!" Monty's back was to Remus and therefore the man missed the moment Remus's brain fizzled to a stop upon hearing those words directed into a young James Potter's face. It was his Hogwarts days - no, it was Harry's third year all over again! "Now tell me," Monty's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Wha's the scam?" The ceiling over Remus's head creaked again - someone was definitely walking around upstairs. Why hadn't they come down to investigate the ruckus? And what was a young Potter lookalike doing in Charming Chocolates?!
The iridescent potion could cure any ailment, its pushers claimed; upon consumption, it would chemically transform into whatever potion one most needed. If someone was dead tired and in need of a good rest, they could drink Prism instead of Dreamless Sleep Potion. If someone suffered a broken bone and couldn't manage the spell to set it, they could just Vanish the bone and take Prism for an instant dose of Skele-Gro. A miracle solution.
James soared into a sitting position, the air feeling impossibly cold and wet compared to the hot dry heat of his dream - nightmare - memory?
Harry jerked a nod, sending Malfoy some sort of significant look which was returned by the ferret in an equally significant way. Ron's addled brain couldn't spare the energy to contemplate these stupid looks because he was too busy taking note of Tony's anxious fidgeting.
. Montgomery Gibbs grew up translating for his Deaf parents and looking after his younger sister, who now lived in Kent with her new wife. James had met him about a year after his elderly parents caught a nasty flu and died within a few weeks of each other. A life like that was a recipe for an affectionate, demonstrative man who sometimes let fear and jealousy get the better of him.
Hours later, or perhaps only seconds, Potter’s voice slurs sleepily: “Mrs. We…Weasley cooks. Magic.”
Ron had explained about the magical energy syphoning that had led to all of this. He felt a flare of anger that a bloody potions ring was holding his and his family's lives in flux. He could hear Snape laughing from the grave.
"You shouldn't be so easily disarmed," Ron shot back. "Bloody pathetic show, that. You're an Auror, act like it!" He sent Teddy, Alec, and Arty back into their compartment, grumbling under his breath.
He knew they would ever since Monty blurted it out on Friday. They used to make blanket forts all the time. It started as necessity - the studio flat was all he could afford when he first started at the bakery. A new blanket fort every night wasn't nearly as pathetic as kipping in the same bed, and they got quite good at making them. But then he started operating the mail-order system out of the studio in addition to his bakery hours, and they were able to move into a two-bedroom flat, and the forts tapered off. Then they got the shop with the flat above, and then Monty eventually moved in, and then James and Monty started having issues, and then finally Monty decided to wage a delicate war over sofa territory.
Harry shoves away from the sink and flies to the door, pounding on it with abandon. A brittle wheezing sound reaches his ears - unmuffled - and dimly he realizes it's coming from himself.
"Fine, then it was too - er, dark," Harry landed on. Scorpius, still spinning, fell down, his head still rolling on his neck as the room no doubt spun around him.
Ron couldn't care less about the people who weren't there that night, Obliviating and torturing his friend. But it was technically the same case, and all that was left to do, next to paperwork, was tackle what remained of this Prism ring.
James formed the letter D again and brought the curved part out, landing a few inches from his left pointer.
Alarm bells were ringing in her mind, but surely this was a misunderstanding, surely James meant that Monty preferred simply to offer his help…?
"It's'n open house," he insisted, and Harry wondered how a seven-year-old was managing to talk over him. "You just, go inside."
“Draco would like to apologize for whatever happened last night,” he said, tending his own tea with no little amount of showmanship. If Draco didn’t know any better, he’d say Blaise was managing to take offense at the fact that James couldn’t possibly know how he took his tea. He was one glib comment away from an official insanity diagnosis.
was, he wasn't there anymore. He was here, stealing wands and hexing people into the wall and leaving it up to Alexander to bring him back. He was here, with Ron and Remus and the Aurors. He was here, with his boys and Teddy staring at him through their compartment window.
Harry Potter's friends spoke to Monty through the phone while James shivered on the sofa in his wet joggers and t-shirt, feeling too much like a little boy who had wet the bed. Within minutes, Hermione was knocking quietly on their front door and Monty was leading her up the stairs. James heard them laughing softly on the stairs. He knew he should feel annoyed. This wasn't funny.
Malfoy stared. “Indeed…” He clearly thought Harry was a nutter. He turned to his son, wiping a smudge of dirt from his cheek. "Another hour I'm afraid, Scorpius."
Draco suddenly appeared, crouching once more, this time on the other side where he was making his escape. Harry froze. Draco hesitated, touching his slender hand to Harry's scruffy jaw. He opened his mouth like he was about to speak but then leaned in close with his pink cheeks, and pinker lips. Draco closed his eyes and Harry did too.
"Thank you, Minerva." He smiled warmly, digging a ginger snap from the proffered tin. "What can I do for you?" he asked as he bit in.
The boys launched themselves at the sweets - James's mouth tugged down at the corner in what was either disapproval or an attempt not to smile, before he nodded his thanks and carefully prepared three cups of tea. Draco and his mother pretended not to notice when James took a hasty sip, burnt his lip, and spilled several drops down his front.
"So 'e does," Monty conceded, relaxing slightly. "Is that your man there?" he asked casually, pointing a thick finger to a small framed photo that hung on the wall next to the stairway. Remus stepped a bit awkwardly through the opening of the counter and peered at the photo curiously, only to feel his stomach drop out of him.
.” She mispronounces it perversely and Hermione seems ready to correct her. “Can’t wait to get inside.”
He turned back to the stove and began to add the finely grated chocolate bits to the glass bowl that sat over a steaming pot. To get the temper just right, he had to heat the chocolate carefully, slowly, evenly. He kept his digital thermometer in the thick of it while stirring methodically. He was working on a special batch of chocolate-coated fudge - a new recipe for Draco to evaluate before Valentine's Day - and he didn't want to waste the imported ingredients.
"Maybe you knew them in school," he interjected. "Two men, a blond and a brunet, and a woman with long, curly, brown hair."
Harry's eyes fluttered open of their own accord to find Draco watching him, mouth parted, eyes bright, brows slightly furrowed.
"Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts," she answered in an accent that was suddenly thicker than anything Remus had ever heard from her.
"If your name's Haz, she's got to have a good name. Haz's Mum..." Scorpius mulled it over in his head. "Hum!"
I dream about the day when this fic is done and I get to click that little box next to "Complete."  Soon, my precious.  Very soon.
. Of course, the dumb bucket had just needed his help in keeping Arty from adopting a feral tomcat while James worked on calming Al after his traumatic experience.
Hermione and Monty chatted happily as they finished their tea. Then Hermione went back home and Monty dragged James back to bed.
Despite his resistance, the Weasleys (and their hyphenated-Granger-affiliates), the Lupins, and the McGonagall were a collective force to be reckoned with. James found himself outright laughing (albeit silently) at Ron's story of his first experience with a telephone, when he had tried to call Harry and ended up screaming pleasantries at his uncle. Mr. Weasley proudly recited to him the many potential uses of a rubber duck, without explanation, which completely endeared him. George was getting along fabulously with his twins, which - while suspicious - couldn't help but bring a smile to his face. Teddy was coaxed into sending his own hair color on a rainbow tour through sheer force of will, which was one of the strangest things James had ever witnessed but gave him a brilliant idea for a new line of truffles.
Harry met Remus's eye for a moment before he frowned and gave Alec a sharp look, which was promptly ignored.
Charming shook his head in the negative and silenced Gibbs with a quelling look when the man opened his mouth.
on occasion, and they grew closer every day, but it seemed a frivolous waste of energy to pursue a relationship at the time. And then it all went to shit and Aarti wasn’t granted a future.
"Stop yer carryin' on like animals, yer da's tryin' tae sleep!" Monty hissed furiously, his voice carrying into the bedroom. James threw himself out of bed and hurried down the hall without his cane, grabbing Monty by the arm and jerking him out of the boys' room mid-rant.
Remus hummed and returned to that morning’s paper, though his eyes didn’t track across the page because he was just using it as a prop. Harry stopped chewing and waited. The toast was turning soggy in his mouth but he couldn’t possibly swallow until Remus said whatever he had to say.
"Prism is a highly addictive illegal potion used as a temporary solution for a multitude of ailments."
This chapter was originally supposed to include Christmas, but it was turning into a monster.  So much introspection.  I threw in a lot of letters and texts to make it a little easier to swallow.  Excessive introspection, character growth, relationship dynamics...it's all part of the recipe!  But it was getting unwieldy so I cut it off before Christmas got involved.  And finally, I added the nightmare scene to help ground myself in this chapter...it might look like James trying to ground himself in his current life, but really it's your humble author, trying to breathe and gather the courage to post this beast of a chapter.
Potter bucks and their cocks touch for a fleeting moment, separated only by a thin layer of rapidly dampening fabric. Heat surges through him, through the room. He works his way down Potter's neck, pushing up the sopping shirt to run his hands over miles of bare skin. He can't taste what's sweat, what's spit. Potter bucks again. Merlin, he hopes it's precome that's soggying his pants.
"Have I made you, ah...uncomfortable?" Harry frowned at the man, confused. "Discussing Rolanda's position, I mean. If it's really something you don't want to do, of course you - I only - I suppose I am pushing you, but I never meant - "
A puddle of maggot-sized slugs bubbled up and cascaded down his smart green robes. It was awful. Really, he almost felt bad for laughing at Weasel in second year after this curse rebounded upon himself. Almost.
, Dad would say. In case of what? In case a kidnapper snatched them up and didn't think to check their pockets? It was 2010. Everyone and their dogs carried mobiles.
," he commands, yanking Potter over by the hem of his shirt. Potter drops down next to him on the odd little mattress.
"I thought I could lend a clear head," she said, shaking her hair out of her face and leveling a steely gaze at Harry that made him feel like a bug under a microscope. It wasn't even eight in the morning yet, had the woman no sense of stay? "And if they didn't listen, I'd at least have Ministry resources at my disposal. Granted, I had my work cut out for me in the Academy - and emergency situations are
Monty's continued affection, I've no doubt. And if he's anything like you, he's probably bonded in all sorts of inappropriate ways with that owl."
He tries screaming into the tiny, solitary vent mounted up on the wall by the ceiling. It just goes into his captor's room, though. And he knows that, but he is still learning what sounds meant the man is "home" and what sounds are typical of the bunker's rudimentary mechanical systems. He's hoping, if he's loud enough, that his voice will carry through the room and up to the surface somehow. It doesn't. Even if it does, no one will be near the little clearing where the trap door is located.
he thought as he raged against the flickering images that threatened to take over. He wrenched his mind away from that dark, musty cottage to focus on the here and now. Draco was down, Narcissa was about to get herself killed over a teacup, and the fucking traitor that was Ron's missing partner was digging his wand into Arthur's throat.
, crashing into him relentlessly. Mum started cursing the family clock, cursing herself for not having added Harry's name. George had to physically restrain Ginny from running off to who knows where, wand drawn. Dad looked...utterly broken, in that moment, in a way Ron hadn't even seen at Fred's funeral.
The box of chocolates hit the rug and upended, sending truffles to a lint-y demise. Draco made a small cry of offense before the severity of the situation caught up to him. (Upon later viewing his recovered memory in the official DMLE pensieve, this was the moment that Robards would look at him with impatient, judgmental eyes, and Draco would raise his chin in defiance. He was entitled to mourn his chocolate, Auror priorities be damned.)
All the easy back-and-forth they had enjoyed the past six weeks seemed to evaporate in a single hour; James wasn't sure how to talk to Malfoy anymore. Not because he was sick, but because he was hurt. James had hurt him.
"You can't be serious..." This wasn't happening. In no conceived universe could she have foreseen Harry Potter confessing so readily to his little crush on Draco Malfoy, even after an actual, literal, overt Valentine's date. Not only that, but wrapping the Slytherin ice prince in chocolate and calling him a truffle!
James pursed his lips and cocked his head, at a complete loss as to how he could get out of this one. Now his gift to Monty - baking supplies - looked like a big
“Bloody stifling in here,” he mumbles. Potter seems to agree because he’s already pulling off his jumper and unbuttoning the rest of his dress shirt, letting it hang open to reveal a plain white undershirt. It’s soaked in sweat and clings to him.
Potter whirls around to watch the witch in alarm. He probably thinks Draco spotted a burly arm or a hairy leg in the concoction, the stupid tit, but it's not quite as dramatic as cannibalism. It's simply…not done, cooking in a cauldron. Cooking
The ward was painfully silent now. All he wanted for his first day of freedom was to watch his window in peace, and now he was in a stand-off. Remus stepped forward, hands clasped in front of him in that naturally professorial way he had.
"HA!" Monty barked, startling everyone but the boys and Harry. "So ye got yerself a stowaway!" Arthur smiled sheepishly and Harry rolled his eyes, looking so much like his old self.
Draco considered him for a long while as he chewed his pasta at an excruciatingly slow pace. Finally, he lay his fork across the nearly-empty plate.
It was nearly dawn by the time he was putting the finishing touches on the large collection of shiny dark chocolates. The Draco constellation in particular, he wanted to be sure it was perfect. Malfoy was difficult to please sometimes, difficult in general, but this would make him smile. It had to. His hands were steady as he poked a series of white chocolate dots along the five truffles that made up that constellation. Those five were nestled close to the four that made up Cepheus and three that made Irsa Minor. Thirty-six chocolates total made up the night sky, Draco in the center. (Draco had to be in the center or else the little shit would probably send it back.)
James gave him a shit-eating grin and Draco wasn’t sure if he wanted to throttle him or - or - or fly. He thought he might be able to manage it without a broom if his heart went any faster. He cursed Blaise for getting in his head. There was nothing
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy murmured. James peeked up and saw a complicated expression on his pale, pointed face. He wondered briefly how strange this was for Malfoy, to have such a conversation with his old school rival that he very much remembered. “I’m sorry,” he said again, giving his head a quick shake as if to dislodge something.
Arthur screamed. Alec clutched his arms from behind to keep him from signing, his fingernails digging into his forearms in a way that only served to remind James how small his boy's hands were. Alec and Arty's nails were so sharp when they were babies and they hadn't dulled all that much over the years. When did fingernails begin to dull? Would they live long enough to find out?
“I’ve wanted to do that since we potted the Dirty Dirt in Herbology,” Potter admits, looking only half as ashamed as he should be. He strips off his own unbuttoned shirt, flinging it onto the bed.
"Alright, promise," he conceded, shoulders slumping as he looked at Alec's side of the room and seemed to fully consider the task ahead of him.
Arthur hadn't said much about it since that day, but Alec had taken right to Draco, and even Scorpius. Arthur hadn't tried to freeze him out, which was James's chief concern at first, but he hadn't really warmed up to him either.
"Thank you for joining us, Mr. Charming," Mum said graciously, holding her teacup with her pinky slightly extended. Draco caught James's eye and nodded subtly to the display. At the same time, hands low and out of sight of the others, they both extended a pinky finger and dipped it sharply in the shape of a small American letter J.
Harry was so relieved, he tuned out the spiel she rattled off. He slumped against the padded edge and tried to give Draco a grateful, lopsided grin, but he was clearly concentrating on the bartender’s words, which were just barely audible over the loud music. Harry watched, fascinated beyond reason, at the way Draco seemed to frown
And that was true. Under all of this tension, all the rows and strained meals lately, James loved Monty so much sometimes it hurt. He loved his warmth, his care, his belief in James when James thought he himself was the malevolent cause of all the fires in the world. James loved Monty's smile, his brown eyes, and his wiry hair. His voice and his clever tricks to swear without swearing. For five years, their easy friendship had grown closer, stronger, until it led to a messy snog in James's cramped little office that was more suited as a cupboard...a snog that of course sent James into a month of full-blown panic before he decided to try it again. And again and again and again.
Footsteps approached tentatively and all too soon, Draco's legs appeared next to him where Harry crouched under the table like an oversized block of wood, which he might as well be with his useless brain. This was no steel bed bolted into the ground; he was still exposed, still within reach, and Draco had all the reason in the world to drag him back out.
"Thank you," Draco says graciously, dropping into the squashy armchair with relish. He sits like a king on a throne while Potter putters around the perimeter of the room, a hand in his pocket, no doubt around the handle of his wand. Paranoid loon. "Sit," he whispers while the crone tends the cauldron.
Harry shoved past him and barreled up the stairs, near bursting with glee. He heard the others thundering up the stairs behind him but they were sturdy steps and didn't vibrate under the small stampede. At the very top was an ornate, gold-laced trapdoor, which lifted automatically as he approached. He climbed the last few steps up into his new home.
Draco recounted the events of the day in a whisper he could barely hear. He laid it all out as a narrative, starting with his answering the front door to find the Charming chaps. He walked him through, step by step, everything that had happened from his perspective. He told him about wanting to sedate his father - oh how James wished he had, but not for the same prideful reason Draco had apparently been using all these months. He told him about the the tea service appearing from nowhere, how it was Grosh's favorite trick. He told him in the faintest whisper how Lucius had left the room, apparently to retrieve the others, and how Draco had fooled himself into thinking he could let his guard down.
The room was quiet for a moment before Nott's pain caught up to him and he let loose a howl of agony.
Draco stared at him. Harry shrugged. Charlie had talked about his community of cave-dwellings in Romania at tea yesterday. It seemed relevant.
the man's voice rang out in horror and Draco shot to his feet, hurrying to the back door to help. James reached out to grab the collar of his sleek blue shirt, but just missed him.
he signed, but his wand was in his pocket so she didn’t understand. He snatched the grater and chocolate out of the air, nearly skinning himself on the sharp teeth of the tool.
He avoided Astoria, who was trying to catch his eye from across the table. Scorpius hummed absentmindedly as he sucked on a sweet mint, having already declared dinner to be finished as soon as his grandmum began raising her voice. Dad was staring unblinkingly at his goblet of cranberry juice, probably just beginning to suspect that it wasn't wine.
"All's well - don't want you dating some pervert before you're done with your puberty potions." Sirius said it lightly, but his eyes didn't match his tone.
And then Harry began to sign. Alec and Arthur watched his hands with baited breath before Alec nodded, quickly moving Harry's cane to lean against the table and dragging the robot away from the table. Huffing and straining, he pulled it into the pantry, its metal feet scraping across the tile floor dreadfully. Arthur cleared the table, gently stacking dishes in the large industrial sink. Monty was back to attempting to glare a hole through Remus's face, and Remus was attempting spontaneous invisibility.
"You’re meant to hang it up when you've finished," she sighed, placing the phone on its wall-mounted cradle. Ron looked up and she caught the unnatural pallor beneath his freckles. "Ron?"
