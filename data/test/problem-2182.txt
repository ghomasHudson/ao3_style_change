“Nothing a little make-up spell can’t hide, mate,” he said with a wink. “Your fella will be swooning, no doubt about that.”
, Harry thought in horror. He watched as the three men hurried up the stairs, wondering if he should follow them. Then he looked back at Draco. He couldn’t leave, not when he had just found him.
, he realized, but it was too late: Draco was already approaching him, a tentative smile on his face.
“I did, young man,” Shaver said, turning back to the front of the classroom. Draco tried to breathe. “I was here when the Dark Lord fell, and I helped hunt down many of his companions.”
Malfoy nodded, his eyes still that soft gray that Harry thought was actually quite beautiful. “Thank you, Potter,” he said sincerely. “I – am very grateful for this.”
“Harry, in the spirit of being completely honest with each other, I have something else I want to tell you,” he said, searching Harry’s face. Harry let his own gaze rove over the other man’s face, taking in his tousled blond hair, the dark circles that made his gray eyes look even more ethereal, his high, sharp cheekbones. His fire. His strength.
“No. No, you don’t talk,” he said firmly, and suddenly his words were not slurred at all. Draco breathed in carefully, his eyes never leaving Weasley’s face.
Malfoy was watching him like a bomb was about to go off. “Really?” he said. “Don’t you have better things to do than—I don’t know, go horseback riding? With me?”
“No,” Malfoy said firmly. “No. You wanted to come here to celebrate, we should celebrate here. I will be fine.” He stepped firmly into the pub. Harry could barely even see his hands shake.
“Shut up!” shouted the second man, and Draco fell silent. “If you’re not going to tell us anything useful, we’ll do the talking and you can just listen. Yes,” he crooned, stepping up to Draco and running a finger down Draco’s pale cheek. “You’ll listen like the obedient little pet you are, or I’ll put something else in your mouth. Something even bigger...”
“I was sorry to hear of her passing, Draco,” Harry said after a moment. The other man nodded quickly. “She was a complicated woman, but I grew to really respect her, after the Battle.” When Draco still said nothing, he pressed on. “I sent flowers for her funeral, but couldn’t come in person. Work trip.” He watched Draco carefully, trying to gauge how much of this was helpful. “I’m sure it was a lovely memorial.”
“Oh, that,” Malfoy said, waving a hand dismissively and leaning back against the wall so that he was no longer looking at Harry. “It turns out my copious charms aren’t quite enough to balance the drawbacks of dating a prisoner and – how did you so eloquently put it earlier, Potter? – a ‘convicted Death Eater.’ Good in kink, dull in practice, I suppose.”
These words seemed to unlock something in Draco. With a small cry, he collapsed against Harry’s body. Harry realized the other man was crying silently, tears running down his cheeks and onto Harry’s shirt. He was shaking his head, clearly unable to speak. Harry ran his hands down Draco’s back over and over again, rocking back and forth. “It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s going to be ok,” he said, again and again, a quiet croon over Draco’s silent sobs. “I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere, I’m here.”
There was a brisk knock at the door and Draco started back violently. “Occupied,” he said automatically, his fists clenching. How long had he been sitting here? Harry was probably looking for him. Trying to breath past the panic building in his chest, Draco stood up quickly and shoved the letter into an inner pocket in his robes. He took one more look at himself in the mirror, smiled (guiltily, his traitorous mind supplied), grimaced, and yanked the door open.
“We’ll do our best,” he said soothingly. “I have a daughter of my own, just turned five. I know what you’re going through.”
Harry flopped down next to him. “Hey, sorry again about all that, and about bringing up your mother, that’s really –”
“I’ve been back in England for months, Potter, and it’s been terrible.” Draco looked up at the stars and smiled suddenly, his eyes crinkling. “But things are looking up.”
The Weasley girl was walking hand in hand with Lovegood and reached Potter first. She immediately launched into a whispered tirade that Draco couldn’t hear over the din of other guests talking and eating. He took a bit of his salad to give himself something to focus on, and looked up a few moments later, bland smile plastered on his face, to find Ginny Weasley glaring at him over his water glass.
Draco’s eyes flicked to Potter’s, wondering if he was being mocked, but he saw only concern. Quickly, he nodded. “Fine.” Desperate to change the subject, he indicated the other man’s meal with his chin. “How is it?”
“El único chico que vive aquí es Draco,” the woman continued. Harry’s eyes flew to her face and he heard Ron gasp.
“Our marriage...” Harry said slowly. “It...it was never meant to bring peace? You arranged the whole thing?”
And to tell Malfoy that Viola was doing well. He had stopped by Ron and Hermione’s last night for dinner, and had made a point to talk to Viola and let her show him her new bed, the books on the shelf by her small table, and Theodore, her stuffed plush dragon. He thought Malfoy would especially enjoy that last part.
Things got better after that. Draco felt himself relaxing a little more each day. He almost always said what he was thinking, now, and enjoyed the warm glow that came when Harry laughed at something he said. He told Harry about how the wand from the Ministry never really worked for him, and Harry started teaching him wandless magic in the evenings, so that he “wouldn’t have to depend on that piece of crap anymore.” Draco was making slow progress, but Harry was a patient teacher.
Harry stepped quickly back. Draco’s expression was unreadable, but he followed Harry into the Three Broomsticks with only a moment’s hesitation. It was, indeed, quite empty. The only other inhabitants were several students studying in a corner, two old witches chatting over mugs, and Clara the barmaid polishing glasses behind the bar.
Harry and Torey/Hermione reached the Manor’s front doors without incident. Harry could see Torey/Hermione trembling. He was sure they would encounter some kind of anti-intrusion spell at any moment, but so far there had been nothing. Under the Invisibility Cloak, he peered into the darkness. The Manor looked deserted, dark and forbidding against the night sky, blotting out the stars.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said bluntly. “Once today, and then there was that time during the war, at Malfoy Manor, when you didn’t identify me even though Voldemort—” Draco flinched, but Harry pressed on. “Even though Voldemort was coming and he probably would have rewarded you with eternal life or something if you had delivered me to him.” He took another drink of water. “I think that counts as saving my life.”
“Thank you,” he said, trying to read her gaze to know if she had left the note, but she moved past him and shut the door firmly with no further comment.
“You’re welcome, Malfoy,” Harry said. He checked his watch and cursed. “I’m late,” he said, standing up quickly and pushing the chair back. Malfoy nodded, his face returning to its impassive mask.
“I answer those letters in my office because I thought you didn’t like thinking about the Ministry,” Harry said with a small laugh. “I was trying to help you feel more comfortable.”
“Um…great,” Draco began uncomfortably. He shot another look at Harry, who crooked an eyebrow but nodded encouragingly. “Yes, I am very grateful that Headmistress McGonagall, and all the Hogwarts professors and students, are giving me a chance to finish my education.” He bobbed his head, a light flush spreading over his cheeks. Harry tore his eyes away from Draco Malfoy’s cheekbones to see Harold Rose affect a rather tragic expression.
The overall effect, of an absurd amount of information expertly organized, was somewhat marred by several huge black scorch marks and dozens of huge, red slashes that cut across the bulk of the map. One began in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and stretched to the eastern edge of Germany. Another cut vertically through the middle of England, but both ends were obscured by holes that cut right through the map’s parchment to the wall beneath. It looked like a large, angry, fire-breathing tiger had ripped claws of red ink across the western world.
. Images rose up in his mind’s eye: Harry’s face, twisted with hatred; wands flung out, spells flying, pain blossoming across his chest; that first evening at the castle, they were both so small, a hand offered in haughty friendship, and denied.
He remembered finally being told that he could see Draco (“He’s on some pain spells, a little woozy, but conscious,” said the Healer with a smile. She looked tired. Harry wanted to hug her). He remembered walking into Draco’s room and seeing him lying there, pale against the white sheets, but smiling. Harry smiled back. They didn’t talk, just smiled, and Harry grasped Draco’s hand and would not let go.
“Just…I was just about to go back in…” he started, but Weasley shook his head sharply. Moving with a catlike quickness that Draco wouldn’t have credited him with, Weasley’s hands shot forward and grabbed the collar of Draco’s dress robes. Draco suddenly found himself pinned against the far wall of the bathroom, the other man’s hands pressing painfully into his neck.
“Um, no, no one expects that. I mean…” This wasn’t going well. “We’ll obviously have to pretend that we’re doing – I mean, that we’re having…” He swallowed. “But we don’t actually have to do it. Ugh.” He suddenly wished desperately that they were having this conversation over a glass of wine, preferably not after the longest day ever. “Can we talk about this later? Maybe?”
Now, Harry laughed and changed the subject. “What was your first use of accidental magic?” he asked, picking up another piece of pizza himself.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “It’s not my fault your cooking skills leave so much to be desired,” he snapped, but Harry noticed his eyes were slightly softer. Wordlessly, he filled a cup with water with a quick
By the time they reached their seats, Draco’s palm was sweaty against Potter’s. When they finally let go to wave one last time and sit down, he tried to wipe his own palm as unobtrusively as possible. The guests took their seats as well, a cacophony of chairs scraping back and murmured comments. Just as Draco was beginning to sweat anew, seated up there next to Potter with a target on his forehead, the plates before them filled with food and Draco forgot everything else.
He remembered sitting in St. Mungo’s with very little memory of how they had all gotten there as Healers bustled in and out. “He’s badly wounded, dehydrated, malnourished, and in shock,” one of the Healers told him when he asked about Draco. “But he’s stable.”
Harry nodded and pulled up the hood of his invisibility cloak as Hermione withdrew a small vial of Polyjuice Potion from her pocket. She downed it in a single gulp and transformed before his eyes into a mousy little man with a huge mustache.
Harry shrugged, feeling defensive. “I dunno,” he said grimly. “Kids should be with their parents. Isn’t a little bit of hope worth something?”
, he thought several times as Potter waxed eloquent about another game. He didn’t even have to feign interest. As breakfast continued, he felt himself relaxing marginally. Eating American pancakes while Potter re-enacted a particular Harpies goal with the salt and pepper shakers felt—not
“She’s not even as bad as my mum,” he said confiding. “Don’t even get near her today unless you’re holding a centerpiece.”
“And you admit that you’ve been keeping her here, without her father’s knowledge or permission?” asked Ron. Malfoy nodded again.
“Please, Harry,” Draco said again. His grey eyes were huge in his face. “Just have your drink. I don’t want anything anyway –”
Hogwarts might accept him for another year, but he could not let himself think of it as the home it had been. Everything had changed.
Draco Malfoy was walking towards him down the aisle. The other man was dressed in dark green robes that made his blond hair gleam like sunlight on dark water. His head was up, gaze fixed on a point just over Harry’s head, and his thin lips were set in a straight, tense line. He was walking slowly, with the easy grace Harry remembered of him from their last few years at Hogwarts, and Harry suddenly caught sight of Ginny Weasley’s face, her eyes fixed on Malfoy in a look of pure hatred. Harry hoped that Luna, sitting beside her, was holding Ginny’s hand. It had taken Luna years to help her beloved overcome the trauma of being possessed by Voldemort at the hand of Lucius Malfoy. He knew this couldn’t be easy for either of them.
She carefully laid a hand on his shoulder. “I can’t believe you had to ask,” she said with a watery smile of her own. “We’ll get him back, Harry.”
But Draco was watching him, his face guarded, clearly waiting for his polite withdrawal to be acknowledged. With a sinking feeling, Harry realized he didn’t even really know how to talk to this man, who had grown up in a manor, had made choices Harry would never understand.
“Consider it a gift,” Hermione said with a soft smile. “To Viola,” she added quickly, and Malfoy nodded, his face again unreadable.
Draco found Harry’s hand and grasped it tightly. He squeezed once and felt Harry squeeze back. He wondered if Harry was thinking of their own wedding – the one they had already had, or perhaps the one they might have someday, if they decided that was something they wanted to do. Who knew what the future would bring?
“She’s got lots to say,” Malfoy said, still a bit wary, but his eyes brightened. “What was she on about last night?”
Harry remembered breathing a sigh of relief and sitting back down. Luna had still been holding his hand. He squeezed it. He remembered that.
He had been so careful all morning: waking early and dressing quickly, waiting until he heard a door open and Potter’s footsteps pass in the hall before opening his own door, doing his best to keep the conversation light and moving in safe directions.
, he chided himself sarcastically, but then he shook his head. He didn’t need to think like that anymore. Harry was on his side.
“You kept this from me? For months?” He only realized he was striding forward when Draco took several steps back. “I mean, I can understand the first little while, you thought I was plotting against you, but now? Still?”
“Todrick Shaver,” the man declared, spreading his arms wide as if he wanted to embrace the entire class. “I am thrilled to be joining you as your new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor this year, and excited to get to know each and every one of you.”
“I’m just saying,” he said, meeting Harry’s eyes again. “We can always give this one to someone else. Just say the word and I’ll back you up.”
Suddenly, angry shouts rose above the jovial chatter. “Kill the Death Eater!” “Dark Lord scum!” “Save Harry Potter!” Harry felt Malfoy tense beside him and was already reaching for his wand as three Aurors he hadn’t even seen beside them strode toward the disturbance. Two other Aurors flanked them and started ushering them toward the carriage that would take them to the reception, but not before Harry saw a spell fly through the air and narrowly miss Malfoy. It hit an unlucky witch instead, who fell to the ground gasping.
“Yes,” Draco replied simply. He looked up at Harry. “He’s been horrible to me my whole life,” he said matter-of-factly. “Even before Voldemort, before the War, he always wanted me to be someone else. He couldn’t let me be myself, he couldn’t let me be free. And then he toyed with us for months and tortured me in a basement for
He did. Draco could see it in Shaver’s eyes: a taunting knowledge that Draco was, again, completely in his power.
“Firewhiskey for me,” Harry said, and Draco nodded quietly. “Two,” he amended, and Clara sauntered back behind the bar. Harry turned to Draco, but stopped short at what he saw in the other man’s face. They sat in silence for long minutes until Clara returned.
“Listen you –” he snarled, or began to snarl. He didn’t get a chance to finish because then Harry was upon him, wand drawn, lasagna in its Tupperware forgotten on the floor.
“Mind the makeup!” she said. Then she kissed him loudly on his cheek. “Oops, I got a little lipstick on you,” she said innocently, then cackled as he ran to the mirror to check his reflection. “Gotcha.”
Bogrod bustled off, his eyebrows nearly disappearing over the round top of his bald head. Harry sat back with a sigh.
It made him feel a little faint. He couldn’t take his eyes off of Harry as the dark-haired man leaned across the fourth desk they found themselves facing, staring calmly but determinedly into the eyes of an increasingly-flustered goblin. Potter’s back was ramrod straight; his mouth quirked into something that was not quite a smile. His eyes, though – his eyes were molten.
He remembered Kingsly coming to visit, several days later, once Draco was off most of the pain spells and could sit up and hold conversations and remember things that happened. Harry was sitting next to his bed, reading Quidditch commentary aloud from the
“Neville,” Harry said, hoping he sounded better than he felt. “I’m – fine, I’m just –” He cast around for an explanation and came up empty. “Resting,” he said finally. He looked back at Neville, suddenly confused. “What are you doing here?”
Harry had not known that, but he vaguely remembered seeing a thin, reedy man hovering at Kingsley’s elbow on a few occasions. He had been at their party, Harry suddenly remembered. He tried to focus on Luna’s voice over the wave of shame that engulfed him whenever he remembered that night.
“That’s not usual,” he said seriously. “I mean, you’re pretty oblivious sometimes,” he amended, as if it were obvious. “But you don’t make a mess of your life.”
Lucius nodded, clearly delighted. “Oh yes, I’ve been planning it for years. At first, I assumed that once I got Draco out of Azkaban, he would work tirelessly for my release and I wouldn’t have to resort to such underhanded measures. That didn’t end up happening, though, did it, Draco?” His face clouded over with anger and he made a sudden motion with his hand toward Draco, who flinched back violently. “So weak. Such a disappointment,” Lucius said sadly. Then he seemed to remember his story. “I still wanted a spy in Potter’s house, though, which is where my letters came in. They were charmed, you see.” He twirled his wand between thumb and forefinger while the Imperiused witches and wizards watched in silence. “Delightful little eavesdropping spells, but not very useful when my son was sleeping alone.” He sighed again and Draco shifted uncomfortably next to Harry.
“How was your day, love?” Harry asked as they pulled apart, very conscious of several people around them who had stopped to take this in.
“What would you say if I told you that I am poised to rule the wizarding world, as Lord Voldemort intended, and that I want you by my side? My son,” he said quietly, and reached out a hand to stroke Draco’s cheek.
After a long moment, Ron sighed and shook his head, but Hermione stood and clasped Harry’s hand. “We know you do, Harry,” she murmured. “And we’ll be right beside you.”
“Yes, we do,” he said firmly, and stepped up to stand beside Draco. “I’ll be careful,” he said with a disarming smile to the older man behind the desk. “Just give me a calm one and I’ll hold on tight. And Malfoy can give me some pointers,” he said with a smile at Draco, who looked away quickly.
Harry pushed his chair back from the table and stood up. “Let’s go,” he said, and grinned at Malfoy’s stunned look. “I’m not kidding—let’s go! What else are you going to do with your first real day of freedom?”
Malfoy scoffed and stepped back from the bars until he was sitting on the narrow cot. “I know, I know, I’m going to Azkaban. Very original, Potter. This must be hugely satisfying for you.” He lay down, facing the wall, and Harry left without another word.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” she whispered savagely, then turned and stalked away without even waiting for Lovegood, who, Draco could now hear, was praising Potter on an especially good display of tiddlywamps. Potter was nodding enthusiastically and smiling, genuine warmth plain his eyes. Draco took a deep breath as Lovegood turned toward him, steeling himself to smile through yet another well-deserved whispered curse or insult.
“Sorry it’s a mess, I can clean up some tomorrow,” he finished, somewhat defensively, then cursed his own inability to stop talking. Malfoy still hadn’t said anything, and Harry found it impossible to tell what he was thinking behind that pale, expressionless face. Judging him, judging his house, probably. At least you could always count on Malfoy for that. Harry was just about to say something else – he had no idea what – when Malfoy finally spoke.
, I know the general idea. I just didn’t think it customary to date someone when all you’re really interested in doing is shagging them.”
“Still third-wheeling, I see,” he said airily. “Tell me, Potter, have you ever thought of getting a family of your own, or do you plan to leech off of Weasley and Granger for the rest of your life?”
They were both leaning against one wall, Draco’s head dropped onto Harry’s shoulder. Harry was holding one of his hands, running his thumb over Draco’s knuckles and marveling at how smooth his skin was.
“It…good…it was good,” Draco replied hastily, looking like a deer in Muggle headlights. He shot a quick glance at the people beside them, who turned away hurriedly and pretended they had never stopped to stare. All except for a rather rotund man of middling height who pushed through the crowd of shoppers toward them.
The Minister stepped back and Draco felt something loosen in the room, balanced by the tightening in his chest. It was so difficult to breath.
The other man’s face was a mask of desperation, dark circles like bruises beneath his eyes. Harry wondered when Draco had started to look like this and hated himself for not knowing. Slowly, he leaned forward so that their foreheads were touching.
it so much?” Ron hissed. His eyes were gleaming, and he didn’t even look up as their waitress approached them again with their appetizer. “His dad tortured my
“And how do we know he’s a former Death Eater, anyway?” Ron cut in. “How do we know he’s not agreeing to marry you so he can escape Azkaban and kill you and bring the Death Eaters back?”
“I think you know I have been recommending that you host a gathering for some time now,” Kingsley began, raising one eyebrow. “This could be a perfect time to invite some of your friends and acquaintances to share in your – how did Mr. Malfoy put it? – ‘mutual happiness.’” He smiled slowly. “Of course, a few members of the press corps would be invited as well, which would provide ample opportunity for them to see how well you’re getting on and put an end to these rumors once and for all.”
“Seize him,” Lucius said calmly, advancing on him. “And take the man in the chair down to our most uncomfortable cell. I’ll be attending to both of them personally, as soon as the dementors return from –”
“Just know that if you ever put on a little display like that again in my class,” Shaver said softly. “I will have no choice but to report you to the Headmistress for contempt of a professor. And if I told her, word would probably spread…”
Then Draco stepped forward and suddenly their lips were against each other and Harry let his hands roam up Malfoy’s back with a joy like a dam bursting, days –
It had been a little more than two weeks since the horseback riding fiasco, and Harry was back at work. Draco still felt a flicker of amusement at himself every time he thought of Potter by his first name, or heard his own given name from Harry’s lips. They seemed to have settled into something resembling civility, at least outwardly: first names, cordial greetings in the mornings and evenings when Harry returned from work, most dinners spent together in usually companionable silence. Every so often, Harry would send an owl that he would be getting dinner with coworkers or, more often, working late, and Draco would make something simple for himself and eat at the table alone. He cherished those solo evenings when he didn’t have to worry about asking questions that Harry seldom seemed to want to answer, or examine Harry’s every movement for signs of annoyance or exhaustion. He actually felt a little guilty at how much he enjoyed evenings alone – further proof, he supposed, of how little he appreciated his new life, and how poorly suited he was to being anyone’s husband.
She didn’t respond, just snuggled closer into his arms. Malfoy rested his chin on top of her head and closed his eyes. Harry nearly looked away at the helpless anger and bitter sadness that descended over Malfoy’s face in that moment. It felt too personal, too raw. But he had made a promise, and so he continued watching as Malfoy gently ran his hands over Viola’s face, shoulders, and legs – checking her for bruises, Harry realized with a sickening lurch – and then led her into the kitchen.
Professor McGonagall suddenly rose from her seat by the four trees. Malfoy’s eyes darted to her for a split second before returning to Harry, and their eyes met briefly before Malfoy dropped his gaze to Harry’s shoulder. Before Harry had time to think very deeply about what had been in that glance, Malfoy and McGonagall were standing before him and everything had gotten very, very quiet.
“Not for that,” Draco interrupted, then looked down. “I mean, yes for that. But also—I think—I might be making things difficult between you and Weasley?” His voice lilted up at the end, making it a question. Although of course it wasn’t.
“…Thank you,” he replied. It was an odd response to an odd statement. Kingsley seemed to agree. He cleared his throat and began again. “You may know, Mr. Malfoy, that the wizarding world is still deeply divided.” Kingsley’s deep voice betrayed no emotion. No sign whatsoever that he was speaking to someone who was responsible for that division. “Four years later, Voldemort’s presence is still felt every time a wizard mistrusts his neighbor, every time a witch feels unsafe venturing out after dark. Rebuilding was difficult—reconciliation is proving nearly impossible.”
Harry cocked his head at that, but Malfoy spoke again. “I am more than happy to sleep on the couch.”
“Not let me say what I want to say,” responded Harry. He was crowding into Malfoy’s space and Malfoy was letting him, just watching him.
Draco nodded. “Yes,” he said carefully, “but not only that. Harry, I love you –” Harry’s heart leapt at the casual way he said those words, but Draco wasn’t finished. “—But you can’t go for my throat every time someone tells you something bad about me, that they say I’ve done, that they say I am.” His tone was mild, but there was a hardness beneath the words. He was watching Harry closely. “I was on the wrong side of the war, Harry, and I’ve done things I’m not proud of, but if you can’t trust me enough to
“No. Neither did I.” He clasped the bars in his hands, wishing he could clasp Malfoy’s hands. “I like you, Malfoy.”
Harry swallowed the words that wanted to come out – wild words like “You are beautiful,” and “Please laugh again,” words that couldn’t be allowed to emerge. “She loves you so much,” he said instead, and Malfoy ducked his head, no longer laughing.
So he and his followers visited Draco every day, sometimes more than once, and tried to get him to tell them anything about Potter. What he did every day, now that he wasn’t working as an Auror anymore. What he feared, what his weaknesses were. Draco didn’t know Lucius’s exact plan. Privately, he doubted Lucius had a plan. The questions always had a slightly random air to them, as if the asker were casting around for something to latch onto.
“I got word on your trial,” he said quickly. “July 13. You’ll be notified of the exact time closer to the date.”
“...said he wanted us to spend a little quality time with his son,” one of them said with a smirk. “I don’t know about you boys, but I feel like blowing off a little steam.”
The wry comment died on his lips as they entered the living room to find Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy sitting on the couch together. Well, “together” was a bit of a misnomer. They were sitting on the same couch, but Malfoy was pressed so tightly against the far armrest he seemed to be trying to become one with the furniture. Ron was staring daggers at the other man and turning his wand over and over in his hands in a distinctly threatening manner. Malfoy’s eyes were fixed on the floor in front of him, his shoulders hunched and tense, and his hands were clenched together so tightly that the knuckles shone white. It was such a far cry from the joyous, relaxed Malfoy of their horseback ride that Harry felt something twist in his gut.
“But,” Harry cut in ruefully. “Our entire marriage was orchestrated by your evil father to sow chaos.”
“She’ll learn,” he said cryptically, dropping his head back to lean against the stone. “Granger and Weasley telling her all the stories of my misspent youth will help cure her of that.”
He left Harry lying on the ground for long moments as he scrambled to grab a handful of the powder from an urn beside the fireplace. “Incendio,” he whispered, and lit a fire in the grate. There was so little time.
Until one day, about a week later, when Draco walked into Defense Against the Dark Arts and Todrick Shaver was gone. In his place, Professor O’Reilly was organizing several large books, and Harry was standing behind her, catching Draco’s eye and looking sheepish.
Riley said nothing in response, but met Draco’s eyes. With a smooth motion that belied his years, he pulled up the left sleeve of his robe.
you, Malfoy. I like who you are now. I like how much you love Viola, and how funny you are, and how much you hate black olives –”
He instantly regretted it. Warden’s hand flew to her wand and before he could react he felt the curse hit him, twisting his muscles into knots of fire. He let out a pained grunt, barely noticing as she walked across the office to him where he still sat bound to the chair. He noticed, however, when she clasped his chin in her hands and yanked his head up, her cold, furious eyes meeting his.
“I know that, you idiot,” Draco bellowed, suddenly seeming to find his voice. “You all think you can break me by reminding me of things I already know. It’s
Harry glanced toward Draco, expecting to see the other man counting out coins, but Draco only looked back at him, shoulders hunched.
“Dear friends,” Mr. Weasley began, stepping up between them and spreading his arms wide as if he wanted to embrace the garden, the crowd, the evening. “It is such a joy to be with you tonight, to join in the eyes of the Old Ones and the Grove’s Kin my daughter, Ginevra Weasley, and her beloved, Luna Lovegood...”
“See that you come back again soon,” Riley said, beaming and squeezing Draco’s hand. “Now, go on – they’ll be waiting for you.” He shooed them out with more smiles. Draco thought he saw the older man’s eyes fix briefly upon Potter’s forehead, then flick away again without a word, and felt a surge of love for the stooped old man. As they stepped back out into the windy afternoon, Potter chuckled under his breath.
Draco shrugged. “I didn’t, really,” he said. “Lucius was playing with it the first night I saw him, sort of stroking it as he told me about his plans. I guessed that all that dementor power couldn’t reside solely in one person, so there had to be an external focus for it. I didn’t know it was the egg, though, until I was holding it and Lucius looked frightened for the first time.” He sobered. Looked down.
“Ah,” Harry said lamely. “I guess there wouldn’t be.” He felt like he was tiptoeing across thinning ice, knowing that the wrong move could be disastrous. They had to live together, after all.
Malfoy nodded and looked down, his face seeming to close again. When he looked back up, it was back to the expressionless mask.
“What are you smiling about?” he asked with a grin, catching Draco’s wrist and pulling him back for another kiss.
“We’ll see if they have any at Madam Malkin’s when we’re next in Diagon Alley,” Potter said solemnly, pulling on his trainers and grabbing a jumper from where it lay over a chair. “All set?”
“Save your breath, you ungrateful little slag,” he growled, looming over him. “When I’m through with you, you’ll never even consider running away again –”
“Well, obviously we’re all in agreement that she can’t go back to Miles,” Hermione began. “Harry told us the situation, and Malfoy...” She trailed off at Malfoy’s curt headshake, then began again. “But the court is unlikely to award you custody, seeing as you’re...”
It felt harder to remember that when he shut the door to Harry’s office behind him and opened the latest letter from his father. That spidery handwriting still set him on edge, made him feel defensive and wary. He scanned the page quickly. All the same sentiments about how his father was happy that his marriage was improving (
“I think these memories will be important in the case against him,” Harry said slowly. “Do you mind if I come back for them tomorrow?”
Slowly, slowly, Draco opened his eyes. Gray eyes met green in a wordless plea. Harry took a deep breath. He had to get this right.
Taking a deep breath, Harry let himself into the phone room – a small glassed corner of one of their office rooms that had an old Muggle phone in it for moments when Aurors had to call Squibs or Muggles on official business – and dialed Miles’s number. The other man picked up on the second ring.
Their customary table was waiting for them at the Muggle bar a few blocks away. Ron and Harry had taken to coming here together when the amount of attention paid to both of them became unbearable at wizard-frequented establishments, or when they needed to discuss private or confidential wizarding matters without fear of being overhead by someone from the Daily Prophet. Harry hadn’t been in a while, though, and said as much as they settled into their corner booth, drinks in hand.
“Congratulations to you as well, Mr. Malfoy-Potter,” he said formally, threading a hand between Draco’s cups. “Nice to see a young man get a second chance. Harry Potter is very generous, is he not?”
Draco took his time selecting hors d’oeuvres, balancing flavors and textures while staying away from foods that would get stuck in his teeth or keep him from being able to make conversation. He was surprised how comfortable he felt at this event. His Malfoy social skills were rusty, but coming back to him. He had gone to so many parties with his parents. Parties just like this. He glanced over and reassured himself that Harry was not missing him, still engrossed in his conversation with Luna.
“You’re such a liar, Potter,” Malfoy said, picking up another piece of pizza. “Umbridge had it right all along.”
“See you later, then,” he said, standing up and clapping Ron on the shoulder. “Rain check on the dinner?”
“I come here to think, sometimes,” Neville said, looking out at the water. “It’s nice to get off Hogwarts grounds every now and then, and Hogsmeade is always rowdy, especially in winter.”
“I’ll talk to Waverly this afternoon,” he said firmly. Ron reached over and clasped his shoulder with a too-knowing look.
“Thanks,” Elias said, then stood and stretched. “And thank you, Mr. Malfoy. I think I have all I need for now, but may I call upon you again tomorrow?” He made a little bow, somehow both self-mocking and endearing, and Malfoy huffed a laugh.
But now Potter was asking about Azkaban and Draco couldn’t just ignore him. They had to live together, after all.
She leaned forward and patted his arm comfortingly. “You can keep getting better,” she said firmly. “And try not to worry too much. I’m sure we’ll get this sorted in no time."
Malfoy smiled, slow and happy and altogether unexpected. “Viola started it. Her first accidental magic,” he answered after taking another bite of pizza. “We were getting in the car to go check on the cows, and she was kind of playing with my hair as I was leaning over her to fasten her seat belt.” He mimed the movement with an exaggerated lean from his cot, and Harry laughed. “Then I felt the most incredible warmth right near my forehead and I looked up to see all these little golden faeries and dragons dancing in the air right in front of us. She had created this amazing illusion, it looked like they were spinning right out of my hair.” He laughed, a warm, bright sound that Harry found himself missing on the days he didn’t visit Malfoy. “It was the first time in a long time that I felt a little bit beautiful.” His face fell and he swallowed hard. “I think my magic reacted without my really intending it. Suddenly we were just surrounded by faeries...”
Harry cursed inwardly. “Yes,” he said viciously. “What, did you think they’d offer parole to a convicted Death Eater?”
“Gryffindor red for you, Potter,” he said boldly. “I just hope he’s not as thick as all the Gryffindors I know.”
“That’s actually also kind of what I wanted to talk about too,” he said, turning and grabbing a handful of banana pieces. “We’re in a strange situation, technically, but it doesn’t have to be hard. For all intents and purposes, we can just be roommates who sometimes go to Ministry functions and pretend to be a happily-married couple.”
The slender wizard, whom Draco had not noticed leaving, returned soon after they sat down with plates of food and a pitcher of wine. Lucius spread the food out on his desk and they ate together, just the two of them. Draco could almost imagine that they were back at the manor, although his mother’s absence was a sharp ache in his chest. He watched his father closely for signs that he was thinking of her, but Lucius took another bite of bread and continued talking about his time in Azkaban.
“You’ll do no such thing,” came Draco’s voice from behind the desk. Harry, struggling against the dozens of hands now pinning him in place, looked up as Lucius turned back around. Draco pulled off the Invisibility Cloak with a flourish. It was very dramatic, but Harry didn’t understand why Lucius gasped in what sounded like genuine shock. Harry also didn’t understand why Draco was grasping a small jeweled egg like his life depended on it.
He still wasn’t sure why he had brought up horses. When Potter had zeroed in on that, Draco had been sure he was in for some merciless teasing. That’s what he would have done, had the positions been reversed. But Potter seemed…
“We’ll take care of her, sir, no worries at all,” one of the Aurors said, pushing Harry and Malfoy along. “Got to get you to safety, now don’t we! All’s well, all’s well.”
“Five galleons,” he said helpfully, thinking perhaps Draco hadn’t heard Madam Malkin’s request. Draco nodded.
Harry held up one hand and Draco fell silent. He breathed in and out. He skimmed the first letter, then the second.
. He would not think about Crabbe’s screams. He would not think about the scorching heat against his skin. He would not think at all.
He looked up wretchedly at Snape, expecting – deserving – more, but the boggart was changing before his eyes. Draco had a moment to wonder at this. He had never seen a boggart change mid-fright. Then he realized who it was changing to and felt his stomach clench again.
“Just about,” Neville said with a grin. “She says by the spring I’ll be ready to start teaching first-years on my own. On my own, Harry! Can you imagine?”
Malfoy was crying, Viola was screaming, and Harry had never felt so utterly, horribly helpless in his entire life, when the scene changed again —
“I know, I know,” Ron said harshly, running a hand through his hair. “I know you have a savior complex, I know you have to be married to him, but do you have to
Harry showed him to Malfoy’s cell a few days later for their first interview. Elias was planning to question Malfoy under Veritaserum because Pensieved memories had been known, in certain court cases, to come under scrutiny as too subjective to be evidence.
In other ways, it seemed to take forever. By the time Harry was once more heading down to the holding cells, he was practically running. He had to see Draco. Had to make sure he was alright.
He sounded different in Spanish and slightly deeper, rougher, but it was unmistakably Malfoy’s voice. And the child – could it be –?
“Hey, Harry,” Ron said awkwardly. His smile looked unsure, as if he wasn’t entirely certain how it would be received. “Have you eaten?”
“I’ve been skimming old legal cases to see what precedents there are for trying repeat offenders,” she said briskly. “It’s iffy, but I think Draco can make a case for familial ties, assuming the letters don’t have any compromising information about you or your movements.” She looked at his shrewdly. “Did the letters have any compromising information about you?”
Harry wondered suddenly. The dementors and their terrible power. How does he keep from going insane himself?
“It’s good to see you, Malfoy” Harry murmured. Startled gray eyes met his, but before the other man could respond, one of the Druids started speaking and their hands dropped.
“She won’t take her anger at you out on your sister, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Harry interjected coldly. “Not everyone’s a monster.”
It took Harry a full minute to realize what he had just said, and to whom. When he looked back at Malfoy, the other man was staring at the floor, his shoulders hunched and his hands shoved into the pockets of his robes.
Ron’s grin widened and he stepped fully into the door, leaning comfortably against the frame. “How about the Cradle? I’m dying for some foul Muggle beer.”
Harry tore his eyes from the page and stared, shocked, at his friends. They stared back, clearly at a loss for words.
“First it was in exchange for my meals,” Malfoy said dully. “Then, once you started bringing me food and I was doing better, he threatened to Crucio me if I didn’t...” He made a sound that was something between a laugh and a sob. “You’d think living with Voldemort would’ve hardened me, but it didn’t. I can’t fucking stand pain.”
“We are so glad you could join us,” Harry replied smoothly. “Always a pleasure to share our own happiness with our friends.”
Harry shot him a questioning look, but Malfoy didn’t look up. “Mm-hmm,” he replied, flipping the first pancake. “Well, great then.”
Malfoy raised his head at that. His eyes were red and his hair was wild, as if he’d been pulling it. He glared at Harry so fiercely Harry almost took a step back.
Draco leaned forward, hating the way his heart began pounding at Potter’s questioning look. “Excuse me,” he murmured to the Druid, summoning all the deference he could. “Would it be possible for me to get a copy of this?” He swallowed as his courage failed him. “If it’s not too much trouble,” he added hastily. The Druid’s eyes held a question but she nodded. Draco put pen to paper and signed his name, then clasped his hands together beneath the table as she walked away amid the delighted babble of the guests. It was done, witnessed and signed in the traditional two forms. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Potter watching him and took a gulp of wine in hopes that the other man wouldn’t demand an explanation for his strange request.
Draco yanked off the cloak and took a deep breath, as if to respond, but Lucius shook his head slightly and Draco coughed, stymied.
Draco stilled his shaking hands and stepped back into the party. His eyes immediately landed on Harry, who was now nodding and smiling along with several Ministry officials, but who met his gaze across the room with a broad smile. Almost as if Harry was glad to see him.
“Please don’t make a scene,” he said quickly, reaching out. “She shouldn’t have to serve me.” He placed his hand on Harry’s arm. Harry glanced at it quickly – he couldn’t help himself – and Draco quickly drew back.
The stench that hit him on the other side was so strong that he had to work not to gag aloud. Unwashed bodies, piss, and vomit lay over another stench: the smell of fear.
“Yeah, of course,” Harry answered, relieved. “He has plenty for his story already. No need to drag you through gratuitous unpleasantness.”
“Riley was a Death Eater and I had no idea,” Malfoy continued miserably. “He…he made that explosion on purpose, to scare your horse and make you fall, and he wasn’t going to call a healer, just let you die, so I stupefied him and brought you back here and I didn’t know who else to call…”
The door farthest from the entrance hall, however, was different. Low voices peaked Harry’s interest, different as they were from the loud, laughing conversations elsewhere in the house. He strained to hear, not wanting to risk an eavesdropping spell.
“Ok,” Harry said, grinning back and feeling for the first time in a long time that everything might turn out alright. “Ok, great. And you know, sometimes friends go on dates. After one of them has maybe gone to a bit of therapy and gotten a little less volatile and prone to jumping to conclusions?”
“Oh,” he said. “Is this – was that your choice?” He flushed and looked down. “Sorry if that’s a personal question, I just –”
“I—I didn’t know that you remembered that,” Draco said quietly. He looked up, searching Harry’s face. “How do you know that I recognized you? I might just have been clueless and thought it wasn’t you at all."
“Nothing,” he said quickly, glaring up at the oaf challengingly. “I’m just here to finish my seventh year.” He swallowed hard, knowing that if Hagrid accused him of anything untoward, his year was over before it began.
Malfoy was curled up on the cot, his face to the wall. Harry hesitated, feeling a strange unwillingness to wake him up, but a moment later Malfoy stirred.
“Of course! Yes, right.” Harry ran a hand through his hair absentmindedly, a bit taken aback to hear a compliment come out of Malfoy’s mouth (of all people). He started toward the bedroom. “Let me give you a quick tour, so you know where everything is, and then we can go to bed.” He heard Malfoy’s footsteps behind him, so he didn’t bother to turn around as he waved a hand to the left (“Kitchen”) and right (“Bathroom”). Halfway down the hall he stopped and turned as he opened a door. “Here’s the bedroom. They sent a lot of your clothes over earlier, they’re all in the wardrobe, and there’s a smaller bathroom through that door there.” He indicated another door on the opposite wall and was about to head the rest of the way down the hall when Malfoy spoke.
He returned to the holding cells with Ron and Hermione the next day. They had left Rose and Viola with Luna, who often babysat for Ron and Hermione and with whom Viola seemed cautiously taken. She had been so tired the night before, Hermione told him, that she had gone to sleep immediately, but had been quiet and wary upon waking and finding Malfoy still gone.
Malfoy had moved to the farthest corner from the cell door. He was curled in on himself, knees drawn up to his chin and face buried in his hands. He didn’t look up when Harry stopped in front of his cell.
And Harry couldn’t. At least, not about his tendency to get pulled into work, not about the nightmares or the stress.
“Ooh, ooh, ooh!” Neville was snapping his fingers, looking alarmed. “I was following him yesterday and heard him talking about a big meeting today around lunchtime. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but if he’s going to some big meeting at a second location –”
It was all coming back to him now: the disbelief that Draco would lie to him like that giving way to anger, betrayal, hurt. His deep fury at Dumbledore that still simmered, even after all these years, alongside and within his admiration for his former mentor – bursting out at Draco, and Draco’s terrified face as he backed away, hands shaking.
The words died on his lips as he got a good look at Malfoy’s face for the first time since the ceremony’s end. The other man was bone white, jaw clenched and eyes wide. He was breathing shallowly, quickly, like a cornered animal. His hands, as he brought them together to clasp them in his lap, were visibly shaking.
, Harry thought with a twist in his gut. He couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sympathy, though, as he watched her hold back tears and saw how gently Malfoy held her.
“I’m going to get fired before I make it through a single day,” he said despairingly a while later, as they lay tangled together on the carpeted floor.
“I mean, we don’t share a bed, of course we don’t, we’re not in love!” Harry hated feeling this defensive. “But I don’t know how they
“Oh,” Harry nodded and kept talking as he walked down the hall. “I don’t know the name, but I’m sure he’s good.” Draco made an affirmative noise from the kitchen. Harry reemerged, his work robes changed for casual Muggle clothes, to find Draco bent over a scroll, his quill scratching across the parchment like he was thinking about stabbing someone with it.
“Class is dismissed,” Shaver said firmly, and the silence was drowned out by the scraping of chairs across the floor as the rest of the class got up and gathered their things. Draco knew he should be standing up, knew deep in his bones that he should not let himself be alone with Shaver, but he couldn’t move. He didn’t look up until he saw Shaver’s boots stop before him, and clenched jaw and fists to keep from shying away.
“We will,” Ron agreed. His mouth quirked up in a crooked grin. “Unless Malfoy’s right beside you. Then, I’ll be standing as far away as I can while still in range to curse him if he tries anything.”
Lady was galloping now, responding to Draco’s cues so smoothly she might as well have been reading his mind. They tore across the field, ocean waves crashing against the cliffs far below, seabirds wheeling in the air above. Draco felt like he was made of light. As he turned Lady to gallop back to Potter, he knew a moment of pure joy.
“You didn’t know about Shaver?” Draco asked next, his hands starting to tremble against Harry’s palms. Something in Draco’s voice made Harry stop laughing.
Harry might have made a noise. He wasn’t sure, after. He saw Malfoy’s eyes fly to his, saw him start violently and pull back. He looked stricken.
Draco took a deep breath. Immediately, images flooded his brain: Harry advancing on him, face twisted with anger and betrayal; his own frantic grasp for something, anything, to protect himself; the surge of magic bursting out of him, so strong –
Harry put up a hand, nodded. “I know. And I promise you this, Malfoy.” He stepped closer. “Miles will
. After all, even an Auror hell-bent on torturing him couldn’t want to set Voldemort loose in a classroom on the first day of school, even if it was just a boggart. Draco made sure to stand at the very end of the line as everyone stood up and shuffled into place. He wished he had thought to drink more water at lunch. Then again, his stomach was already churning enough.
“Grown-ups really suck sometimes, don’t they?” was what he actually said, and Harry found himself laughing so hard that tears leaked from his eyes.
“What else are you hiding?” he snarled. Draco put his hands up in front of him in a placating gesture. They were shaking.
Harry followed Ron’s gaze to where a small girl – she looked to be about five years old – was peeking out of the kitchen, not wearing any shoes. Her eyes – pale gray, just like Malfoy’s – were wide and curious.
It took another several minutes of deep breathing, but Draco finally managed a small spurt of warm air. By then, his hair was mostly dry anyway, which Harry pointed out as they headed to the living room to greet their first guests. “If wizards were a little more patient, we’d need half as many spells.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco slid his finger between the wax and the parchment, taking care not to ruin the seal. Neat, spidery handwriting filled the several pieces of paper tucked within: a list of books, a suggested list of supplies, and instructions for reaching Platform 9¾ on September 1.
Then he saw a ring on Lucius’s right hand that seemed to pulse with an eerie, unnatural glow. When Lucius gestured grandly with that hand, the dementors closest to his seat drew slightly back. It was almost imperceptible in the darkness, but Harry knew what he had seen.
Suddenly wary, Draco leaned forward, but it seemed to be a regular piece of parchment. He touched it lightly with one finger.
The trial dragged on for three days and Malfoy was called to the stand multiple more times. Each time, he looked a little more haggard, a little gaunter. Between his own memories, though, and countless other items of evidence – including a written testimony by Elena describing how beat-up both Malfoy and Viola were when they arrived at her house (provided, she thought, for a Muggle court) – the Wizengamot finally came to a decision. Viola would be formally placed in foster care with Ron and Hermione until she became a legal adult at age 17. Miles was stripped of all parental rights. He wouldn’t be able to get to her ever again. She was safe.
Kingsley Shacklebolt was bent over by the closet. Behind him, Draco could just make out a hole in the floor. The loose floorboard that had hidden his father’s letters was tossed aside by Kingsley’s feet, and the Minister of Magic was holding several pieces of parchment.
“Nev and I have been casing the Ministry, trying to see if anyone is going to a new place for any reason, but we haven’t seen anything yet. It’s early though, Harry,” she added quickly, seeing Harry’s face fall. “Dad’s also agreed to let us know if he sees anyone acting differently. He’s all but retired now, he can be anywhere in that building and just say he’s visiting old friends.”
“I –” Kingsley cleared his throat and tried again. “I need to tell you, Mr. Malfoy, that any kind of apology from me will be insufficient to make up for the horror and pain you have experienced due to my own negligence.” He shook his head. “I blame myself completely for not keeping a closer eye on the dementors, and for not treating your father like the threat he was. Both of those factors contributed to my susceptibility to his Imperius Curse, in which state, of course, I and my administration caused you even greater harm.” He clasped his hands together. “In addition, I have been told by my own Healers that your father was able to keep such a hold on me in part because of my own assumptions that you yourself were still a threat. He played upon my own prejudices.”
Harry was in such high spirits when he arrived at Ron and Hermione’s small flat that he enfolded Hermione in a huge bear hug before registering the seriousness of her face. He pulled back, suddenly on edge.
He walked out from behind his desk, and Draco tried very hard to sit tall and straight and still. “This will be a bit different from my last position –” his glittering eyes flicked to Draco, then away again, “—but I hope that I can share with you a small fraction of the skills I have gained in my many assignments as a Ministry Auror.”
Harry raised a hand and Draco flinched back violently. Harry laid his palm, very gently, against Draco’s cheek.
him that I’ve Imperiused nearly the entire Ministry, but perhaps he wasn’t listening. Were you, Draco?” He inclined his head slightly and peered at the blank patch of wall where Draco was standing. “Such a disappointing child, really. Or perhaps, dear boy, you didn’t tell Potter this on purpose? Have you finally decided to join me?”
be fawned over,” he said musingly, almost to himself. Draco looked at him quickly, but Potter didn’t seem to be upset. On the contrary, he looked—
They used the Cruciatus Curse often. That had been one of Voldemort’s favorites, too, Draco remembered. The dementors who had helped his father escape from Azkaban and rise to power were constantly oozing in and out, and he could feel his own grip on sanity slipping. He often wondered why Lucius didn’t just reach into his head and take the information he needed – he was certainly strong enough, had proven that on the first day – but he guessed his father liked the fight, rejoiced in the struggle. Sometimes, he imagined Harry coming to rescue him, but he tried not to. He knew Harry wasn’t coming, and thinking about him made everything immeasurably worse.
Luna beamed at Draco. “Hello,” she said simply. Draco, remembering her kindness at their wedding feast, smiled back far more genuinely than he had so far that evening.
She registered his presence and stopped quickly, her bright eyes lighting up with a smile. Draco couldn’t remember ever seeing her smile before. He wondered if she had had a few too many glasses of wine.
“We should celebrate!” He wasn’t sure why he said it, beyond liking the idea of Draco looking up at him instead of at the parchment. Draco was certainly looking at him now, a slight frown creasing his face.
Lucius Malfoy was sitting behind a shining wooden desk, watching Draco with a smile. His gray eyes were gleaming. As Draco stared, he rose from his seat and came around the desk, opening his arms.
“It won’t be up to them,” he said savagely. “If I’m exiled again, I won’t be allowed to see any magic-users, including her. Once she goes to Hogwarts and hears who I am, what I’ve done, she’ll be glad of it. That’s why it’s good Granger and Weasley have her.” He clenched his fists. “This way she’ll have somewhere to go during school breaks. She’ll have parents who aren’t dead war criminals and she’ll have a sibling who isn’t — isn’t me.” He was crying now, not even trying to hide it. “She’s so much better off without me, but I still want to be with her more than anything. Selfish.”
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his face absently. He hadn’t been sleeping well. In the brief time he and Draco had been sleeping together, he had become accustomed to having someone else in bed with him. To having his husband in bed with him. His stomach clenched.
Then he blinked. Swallowed hard. Laughed out loud. Draco felt lighter than he had in years. He would burn the others tomorrow, he promised himself. For now, he was going to enjoy his party.
Finally, as they sat together on the floor of the bedroom, Draco told Harry again – in between sips of water – how he had thought that Harry was part of it all, watching him constantly, judging him, finding him wanting, regretting everything. With a guilty rush, Harry remembered his own thoughts from earlier that evening, how he had been regretting marrying Malfoy, but not for the reasons Draco was describing. He also felt a cold rage building in his gut at the idea of Warden, Kingsley, and other Ministry officials talking to Draco without Harry’s knowledge, writing their own stories about his and Draco’s partnership without letting Harry in on it.
If Harry Potter, his lifelong enemy, had any complaints about him, he wouldn’t even be granted the dignity of a trial before heading right back to Azkaban, possibly for the rest of his life.
Harry had sat back down in his chair by the bed. He squeezed Draco’s hand again. “There are no easy answers,” he said. “I’m just glad he won’t be able to hurt you ever again.”
Malfoy ducked his head sheepishly. “My father hated it, but Mum and I would go sometimes, when I was younger. There was this spot in Ireland, on the coast, and this man who would rent us horses for a few hours and we would just ride…” He stopped, and shook his head. “It’s stupid, really, I’m not sure why I’m talking about it so much—”
“It was fine,” Draco said quickly – too quickly? Harry made a mental note to ask him again later, when Harry himself wasn’t in such an odd headspace. “Some new professors. I don’t want to keep you from dinner,” he added. “I can tell you more later, if you’re interested.”
“How are you my love?” He asked quietly. She didn’t reply, just turned her head away from him and closed her eyes.
“Drop your wand, Lucius,” Harry said firmly. “Come with me quietly to the Ministry and we can see about getting you a reduced sentence. Just Azkaban for life, instead of the Kiss.”
“I understand, Mr. Potter,” he said slowly. “However, the only possible solution, at the moment, would be to add Mr. Malfoy to your own account as a joint shareholder, which would —”
“I told you, I was taking a walk and I got lost,” came Torey’s gruff voice. It was trembling slightly. Either Hermione’s acting skills had improved, or she was terrified. “Don’t know why you had your men grab me like that.”
“A pleasure, gentlemen, and a true honor to be in your beautiful home,” Rose was saying. “You do throw a lovely party.”
“I went by Ron and Hermione’s last night,” Harry said casually, and watched as Malfoy froze, the apple halfway back to his mouth. “Viola’s quite the talker, isn’t she?”
This letter hadn’t been passed to him, or left in the bathroom for him to find. It had simply appeared in the pocket of his robes, and he’d had to excuse himself quickly from Luna as Kingsley had been approaching them.
Harry glanced at the pale man beside him, wondering if Draco was remembering the same moment. Something about the set of his shoulders, and the way he avoided Harry’s gaze, suggested that he was.
Harry quickly dropped Malfoy’s hands and stepped back, spreading his arms out wide and giving the other man a self-deprecating half-bow.
Fortunately, Riley began talking again almost immediately. “I’ve got a few lovely ones in the stable today, most are already out and about but there’s a sweet gray that I think you’ll remember, Mr. Malfoy, and a chestnut for your friend.” He was making notes in a ledger, stopping only to smile up at Draco. “Has he ridden before?”
“Look, it says right here that neither of us has confirmed or denied anything.” He thrust it toward Kingsley’s face. “Don’t you think that if they had an ounce of first-hand evidence, Draco’s name would be splashed across every line?”
“I’m in love with you,” Harry said, before he quite knew that he would. As soon as he said it, though, he knew it was true. Bone-deep. Miraculous.
“At talking? Yes, I’ve always thought so,” Draco said. His whole attention was on Harry now. Harry felt a little drunk with it.
“Of course, the castle might hold unpleasant memories for you, given the events of your seventh year there,” he said, each word heavy with meaning. “How do you think you’ll—”
“He’s probably crushed he couldn’t get us to say anything nasty about each other,” Harry muttered as they walked away. “Like fucking piranhas, these reporters are.”
. Draco tested the odd word out on his tongue, the unfamiliar syllables reminding him of Harry’s smile when he had heard what McGonagall’s arrangement was for Draco’s last year of Hogwarts.
Hermione was bent over a huge legal tome in one corner, and Neville and Ginny were talking in low voices on the couch. Ron was rustling around in the kitchen, making them all dinner, which he had made a habit of since Draco’s disappearance. It was early evening – all of them had been at work during the day but had arrived promptly at 6, as had become their routine, to touch base and check in, share any new developments and plan for the next day.
, but when she spoke again, her voice was gentle. “That’s a question for Draco, I think.” She watched him get up with a critical eye. “Is your leg alright?”
Potter was watching him, a broad grin on his face as Lancelot munched happily. Draco whooped again and waved. Potter waved back, his back toward the office and stables were Riley had just appeared. The older man was leaning on his cane, wand held in his other hand as he tottered out into the field. Draco wondered absently what Riley was doing – probably going to saddle up another horse or two for arriving clients. He watched Riley lift his wand, even though there were no horses nearby except for Potter and Lancelot. Riley’s lips moved.
The parchment instantly came unstuck from the door and fell into his hand. Draco took a deep breath and unfolded it.
“No need to apologize,” Malfoy said quickly with a shake of his head. “Really. You, of all people, do not ever need to apologize to me.”
, let alone been allowed to eat, in years – and so much higher quality than the food at Azkaban so as to be nearly unrecognizable as the same substance. His own plate was nearly overflowing with tender salmon, green beans covered in spices, and fluffy mashed potatoes. On the table near him, buttery yellow rolls were piled to the brim of a small basket, and two glasses held water and pale-yellow wine, respectively. Hesitantly, he picked up the wine goblet and raised it for the ceremonial first toast – “
Potter’s genuine smile was like a flash of sunlight peeking out from behind clouds. He chuckled warmly. “She’s really something, isn’t she?”
“That’s right,” he said more loudly. “You’re a lost cause, a hopeless coward, absolutely spineless. Did you really think I cared for you? Respected you? How could I, when you never thought for yourself, when you followed your father into hell with nary a backward glance, when you
When he got home that night, the flat’s living room was dark. He saw, gratefully, that Draco had left some soup on the range. He ladled some into a bowl, trying to move quietly so as not to disturb Draco in the bedroom. The door opened anyway, and Draco stepped out. He was dressed in creamy white flannel pajama pants and a dark blue shirt that hugged his chest. His blond hair was slightly tousled, as if he had been sitting up against the wall behind the bed.
“You’re quite right, Harry. I apologize, I overstepped.” He nodded towards Draco. “Of course, Mr. Malfoy, Harry is correct. But it’s very possible that you spoke with someone unknowingly who would see this as an opportunity for some quick money. Have you spoken with anyone about your relationship with Harry recently?”
“Ah, ah, ah,” Lucius said softly. “I think it’s better if you don’t talk. Harry probably won’t want to hear what you have to say, once he knows you’ve betrayed him.”
Then he glimpsed a broom hovering above the ground a few feet away, and felt cold sweat break out across his face. She couldn’t expect him to fly – could she?
“I – Harry – I mean, Potter – you – I’m—” He twisted his hands together miserably. “Gods above and below, I’m so sorry—”
“Love, I know you’re not with him. I trust you. I promise.” He raised a hand and laid it against Draco’s cheek. “I’m never going to jump to conclusions without talking to you first again.”
Draco felt the last threads of tension drain away as they entered the stall: the squat building next to the office smelled of manure, leather, and horses, and nearly-forgotten sounds of whickering and equine chewing filled the air. Draco went right to a stall holding a sweet-faced gray mare: the name “Lady” was written above the door in cursive script. He wondered if she remembered him; she certainly sidled right up to the stall door and pushed her nose into his hand readily enough.
“Lost cause, a hopeless coward, absolutely spineless,” Snape was saying. He looked up suddenly and caught Draco’s eyes.
“Don’t get angry,” Harry said, correctly interpreting the flush rising on Draco’s cheeks. “Feel your way into it and let it come to you. That’s it,” he said encouragingly as Draco took another deep breath. “Easy does it.”
“...Can take Rose,” Hermione was saying to someone as she rushed past him. “I need to take the cake out of the oven, and
“I have been in Azkaban, yes,” Lucius responded, his voice rumbling in Draco’s chest. “Some friends helped me escape. And they have helped me do other things too...”
“Delicious,” Potter said happily before tucking back in with a will. Draco nearly scoffed at seeing the savior of the Wizarding World eating huge chunks of steak and kidney pie, barely pausing to wash it down with wine. Then he thought of his parents, who would have been scandalized, and quickly lost all desire to laugh.
...AAAAND then I fucked it all up again :-P Hope you enjoyed the taste of domesticity and loveliness. It'll come back soon, I promise!
Before Potter could say anything, however, the second course appeared before them, signaling the beginning of the receiving line. Sure enough, several people were already approaching their table, headed by a small man in brilliant purple robes.
“We’re picking up books and school robes for my husband, here,” he said, resting a hand on Draco’s back in what he hoped looked like a fond and familiar gesture. “He’s starting his final year of Hogwarts in a few weeks.”
This wasn’t something he had anticipated when Kingsley had approached him about the marriage. It was one thing to prepare for sleeping arrangements, but quite another to find something to talk about over breakfast.
“I’m sorry Potter. You were saying that you like me. And I was saying that you’re a twat and I’m a disaster and that you need to stay away from me for your own good, if you’re humanly capable of it.”
They walked side by side into the store, and Harry felt his breath catch in his throat. The store looked exactly the same as it had all those years ago when he had come here with Hagrid. Then, he had been beaten-down eleven-year-old hardly daring to believe that his life had changed forever. He had been overwhelmed at the quality of the robes—fabric finer than anything he had ever touched, let alone been allowed to wear.
“That’s what I’m trying to do,” Harry said, raising his head and turning on the bench so he was facing Neville. “What I wanted to do by marrying him, try to figure out what came next, but it just –” He swallowed hard. “It seems like the past just keeps following us, following him, and I can’t do anything about it, I can’t help him, I can’t –”
The spell was broken. With small comments to each other and a grand shuffling of feet and bags, the students found desks and class began. Draco felt his shoulders loosen and he lost himself gratefully in the lecture on ancient runes and spellcasting.
“Why didn’t you file a missing person’s report at the time?” Ron had asked – reasonably, in Harry’s view, but Miles had looked at him as if he had suggested eating unicorn meat.
“What many do not know,” said Lucius, leaning forward with a conspiratorial gleam in his eye. “What even Lord Voldemort himself – may he rest in glory – did not know...”
then remembered that he was sleeping in his office because Draco Malfoy was sleeping in his bedroom.
Malfoy gave him a look of extreme dislike, but perched back on the edge of the cot and took a hesitant bite. After a moment, when nothing seemed to happen, he took another bite, bigger, then another.
Wow, it's been a minute. A grad school-filled, thesis-writing, MA-getting, COVID-filled minute. But hang onto all your horses and hats because I'm back and I'm finishing this thing. Chapter updates every day for the next seven days. Let's do this.
Malfoy shook his head. “I have to stay here for a while,” he said. “Mr. Potter needs my help on a case.” Harry snorted but Malfoy didn’t look up. “I’ll be thinking of you, though, and loving you. You know.” It wasn’t a question. Viola nodded. Leaned forward and wrapped her arms around him, buried her face in his neck.
Forcing high-ranking magical officials to give you what you wanted could really take it out of a person.
Malfoy looked…perfect. Far more perfect than someone who had just been released from prison, drunk at least five glasses of wine last night, greeted hundreds of people, gone to sleep well after midnight, and hadn’t even had anything to eat yet this morning had any right to look. His hair was combed nearly away from his face, and his cheeks had a healthy glow that Harry didn’t remember from their time together at Hogwarts. He was dressed in light slacks and a long-sleeved button-down shirt in a dark red color that made his long fingers look even paler. The overall effect was someone who was ready for a business meeting, and although he was standing on the other side of the kitchen island, Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the other man had been wearing dress shoes.
Viola looked over her shoulder too, then nodded. Quickly, Malfoy scooped out a piece of pasta and blew on it before handing it to Viola, who munched on it hungrily. Malfoy watched her, his brow creasing with concern. Then the front door swung open and Malfoy jumped guiltily, turning back to the pot on the stove. “I’m home!” came Miles’s voice. Then: “Are you eating my food before I say you can, you greedy little —?” Malfoy acted quickly, scooping Viola up and grabbing the remains of the pasta away from her as he placed her gently in an adjoining room and shut the door neatly on her frightened, pale face. “It’s ok,” Harry heard him whisper. “Put your hands over your ears and sing to yourself like I showed you,” before turning back to the kitchen where Miles was standing, glaring at him. He advanced on Malfoy, his fists clenching, and Malfoy watched him come.
The sun had moved several inches by the time he laid the floorplans carefully on the coffee table, stood up, and stretched his arms over his head. His stomach rumbled and Draco headed to the kitchen, meaning to see if any of last night’s dinner was still in the cupboard. He had only gone a few steps, however, when a small black owl flew in through the open living room window. Draco tensed, but forced himself to accept the scroll calmly. If it was from the Minister, he would put it on Harry’s desk. Simple.
Hermione didn’t seem fazed. “Do you know of anyone else who would be a possibility?” she asked. “Any friends of your family who stayed out of the war...?”
“No,” Harry said, before Draco could pull away farther. “You don’t. Or I don’t,” he amended quickly when Draco glanced at him with something like hurt in his eyes. “I don’t understand, but I need to. Draco. Why do you think you’re not an equal member of our marriage?” He squeezed Draco’s hands. “Why do you think I might send you back to Azkaban?”
They kept him in the basement – not the dungeons, with the more legitimate prisoners, but the basement, with the rats and old cardboard. When he wasn’t being tortured, he was locked into something that resembled a large dog crate, except the bars were spelled to spit electric shocks any time he touched them. He had red welts all over his body, because it was nearly impossible to move without touching the bars.
One of the sheets of paper he had balanced on his lap drifted to the floor, and he bent over to pick it up with an air of bemused exhaustion. When had he become so easily distracted? It seemed to have gotten harder to concentrate on simple tasks since he had left Azkaban. He wondered if it was a sign he was getting older, or perhaps he had always been absent-minded like this, just never noticed it so often until now.
Which was why, the next day, he was unsurprised to find that he was looking forward to seeing Malfoy. So much so, in fact, that he hurried through all of his morning work and was heading down to the cells a full hour earlier than normal. He had more leftover lasagna today, which he knew Malfoy loved. He was excited to see the other man and tell him about Viola and Rose’s latest game, in which one of them pointed at you and said “Stupify” and you had to collapse and make funny noises while the other one tickled you. He was excited to hear Malfoy laugh.
He was getting agitated again. Without thinking, Harry reached out and clasped Draco’s hands in his own. Draco inhaled sharply but did not pull back. His hands were freezing.
One of the men pointed his wand at the crate and lightening crackled blue. Then he leaned down, unlatched the door, and hauled out the pile of blankets.
The next day, Harry found himself heading down to the holding cells at 1 p.m. sharp. He had half an hour before his next meeting, and had packed himself two ham sandwiches by accident, distracted as he was by the intricacies of the potions smuggling case. It made perfect sense to see if Malfoy wanted one, Harry told himself. Sharing food with a prisoner was certainly not usual, but it wasn’t against any explicit regulations. Besides, Harry reasoned, he wouldn’t stay long. Just long enough to see if Malfoy wanted the sandwich, and to assure himself that the other man was being taken care of appropriately.
Some time later, they broke apart. “We’re never going to get this done if we can’t focus,” Draco said in mock disapproval.
“She’s doing fine,” Harry responded. “She’s actually staying with an Auror and his wife while we figure out the details of a custody case. We have reason to believe,” he said carefully. “That she has been abused. By you,” he added, lest there be any confusion.
Kingsley was nodding in a satisfied way. “Well said, Mr. Malfoy,” he remarked. Turning back to Harry, he spread his hands. “I’m sorry to ask this of you, Harry,” he said with a small sigh. “In some ways, fighting Voldemort was far easier than playing these political games. At least then, we knew exactly what we were dealing with.”
“See you later, Malfoy,” he said, letting amusement creep into his voice. Then he remembered something. “Um, do you want me to let Elias know about the court date? Or will you tell him?”
But when they peered through the front windows, all they could see were the dark outlines of furniture, most of it covered with white sheets against the dust of an abandoned house. The entire property seemed deserted, except for themselves and that single white peacock.
They were walking up the sidewalk, and Harry suddenly doubted that this would work at all. Perhaps he had misheard Fairchild, or the portal had closed, or it only worked on one person...
“Hey, love, it’s ok. It’s ok. I’ve got you.” Harry drew back, touched Draco’s cheeks, which were wet with tears.
“Of course,” Kingsley said graciously, moving back towards the door. “Rest well, Mr. Malfoy, and please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.” He paused at the door. Smiled again. “I seem to be in your debt.” Then he was gone.
“You’ll be in good hands, young man,” Riley said, not even looking up. “My horses never throw their riders and I don’t expect they’ll start today.” He made a final mark in the ledger and nodded decisively. “This ride is on me, Mr. Malfoy. In memory of your mother.”
“Fine,” he growled. “I don’t know why you both trust him all of a sudden, but fine.” He shoved his wand into a pocket of his jumper and resolutely turned his back on Draco. The other man didn’t move, but Harry saw his eyes close briefly.
“Oh no, don’t worry about it,” Harry said, relieved. “It’s good to communicate about these things. We’re in kind of a strange place, right? We need to make sure we’re on the same page, even if it’s awkward.”
He sneaked a glance at Potter, careful to keep his head still. The other man was waving casually, smiling broadly with just the right mix of wry and joyful that made it look like he couldn’t believe his luck, walking down this hall between hundreds of strangers, his lifelong enemy’s hand clasped in his. Draco realized he was staring and quickly snapped his eyes forward. He arranged his features into what he hoped looked enough like a smile for the cameras flashing somewhere off to their left, and lifted his own hand in a tentative wave.
Harry felt ice running down his back. His eyes were caught and held by the looping handwriting on the parchment in Kingsley’s hand. Two, three – four? – there were too many, this was impossible, Lucius –
Once they were safely within, he breathed a small sigh of relief before turning to Malfoy. “Are you –”
“It just—feels strange to hear you use my first name,” Draco said, one corner of his mouth curling up. “I mean, it’s always strange when we talk without throwing hexes at each other, but…"
It had begun innocuously enough, with the usual morning meeting running long (they never could seem to get through all of the new Death Eater cells in only an hour) and Ron walking him back to his office as they went over logistics for a raid next week. Ron had made a wry joke about needing more pumpkin juice and Harry had laughed. Then Ron had made a more serious comment about Draco Malfoy’s potential involvement with the latest underground Dark Magic network, and Harry had not laughed.
He was just starting to gather his things when a tentative knock at his door made him look around. Ron Weasley’s unruly mop of bright red hair was peeking around the doorframe – Ron’s eyes tentative beneath it.
It all happened very quickly, in some ways. By three o’clock, the surveillance footage had been pulled (and there were, indeed, gaps between twelve and one o’clock every day, going back to the third night Malfoy had been in the cell. Harry felt bile rise in the back of his throat), Ritchie’s immediate supervisor had been called in, and Ritchie himself was out of a job and under arrest. He had paid the bail money immediately and left the Ministry, leaving a desk full of old crumbs and a last glare for Harry.
“Last night,” Malfoy said. His eyes were fixed on the cutting board, where the second banana was slowly but surely being turned into a series of perfectly-sized coins. “I wanted to be clear about expectations, but I overstepped and created an awkward situation. I apologize.”
