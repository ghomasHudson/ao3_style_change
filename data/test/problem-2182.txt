Harriet fidgeted with her robes and said, "It's nothing important, there's nothing wrong really. I'm just wondering if you might have something I've been searching for."
Harriet sighed, "Yeah, I know."
"Ahem, a few more words now that you have all been victualed. An announcement to first years and reminder to others that the forest is forbidden. Quidditch trials will be held next week and any second years or older should contact Madam Hooch. Also that our caretaker Mr. Filch has a substantial list of rules and regulations posted on his office door that he encourages students to peruse at their leisure. Finally, the third floor corridor on the right side is forbidden this year, and should not be entered unless you wish to die painfully."
Albus cast a quick bubble charm and disillusionment charm on each of their heads before he opened the door. He shot out a quick bit of sparks toward the far corner of the room as they entered and the reason behind all the charms had been made plain.
Harry murmured, directed at the ceiling, near silent but still heard clearly "I'm glad I saved you from the troll."
The two gave a small bow to her, and said goodbye to Harry directly before leaving.
Draco made a pained noise and looked at the ceiling, "Of course, you were just mildly annoyed."
Nicolas hummed a little in his throat. There was quite the thriving magical community situated between the two countries. One of his more recent side projects had been helping the muggleborns that popped up frequently enough in both Koreas. He always loved to be there when their town was revealed. Their reactions never got old.
World building, yay!!
"Hiding at Hogwarts? How could the Dark Lord be here?"
McGonagall hummed, "That set is a product of my own creation. It's good practice if you're more of an experienced player. The black pieces will play a defensive game and the white an offensive game. I originally created it to help teach beginner's chess, but it has learned and improved over time. Now I myself lose to it about half the time."
Lavender nodded enthusiastically, "Yeah. And Malfoy is his goddaughter, so there's that too."
Milly and Hermione both shook their heads, and there was a bit of polite scuffle between them of "you go ahead," "no, no, you seem ready."
Hermione gave Harriet a calculating look, but then directed their attention behind them to the Slytherin table as Peeves had arrived, bucket swinging from his hands, "Peeves is a monkey's paw most likely. You get your wish, but at what cost. Either way, we'll find out, now."
Then the girls heard the shout of an adult outside, sounding most like McGonagall, "It's down this way!"
"We can't exactly get into the Slytherin dorms," Hermione noted.
Peeves was in fact singing as he swayed along the Slytherin table.
The ministry officials both looked awkward and glanced between them.
Harriet raised a sore hand and winced a bit, before Pomfrey scolded, "That's enough of that."
Hermione looked a bit smug.
She gave them a sharp glare and then a curt nod before walking away at a near silent clip. They both sat back down meekly resuming much quieter than before.
Harriet side-eyed a look at her. She got the groundskeeper part right, and the half giant was definitely believable, but raising a monster? Hagrid seemed too gentle and kind for that.
"Four floors?! I only saw two outside over the laundromat!"
Even though she had failed spectacularly in her goal of gaining Harry's trust for her father, she couldn't help but glow a little. One out of two wasn't bad. A smile bloomed unwillingly across her face. It hurt a bit.
"Transgender?"
enjoyable, until Quirrell banged the doors of the entrance open and declared, "Troll in the dungeon! There's a troll in the dungeon!" and then collapsed on the floor.
"Ah. Yes. Hermione Granger, I believe? I had heard of her. Only positive things, which is surprising considering all their different personalities."
Melody continued with a wink in Harriet's direction, "Thanks to you, class sizes will look a little more normal with next year's first years. There was a bit of a baby boom after you took out You-Know-Who."
Harriet snuck a glance up at the table and sure enough there was the dark, broody one glaring openly at her, but sitting next to him in the turban was the teacher eating quietly looking nervous and twitchy. He briefly glanced up from his food and for a split second Harriet could swear his eyes turned red. Her forehead seared with pain and she grasped her forehead tightly.
Draco sighed dramatically, "Of course. Harry, you're extraordinary."
Draco's father sneered, "How industrious working on Easter. I hope they're giving you overtime. Wouldn't want your children to starve would you?"
"Can't say I'm steller, but it doesn't hurt too bad. What happened to me? I don't want to open my eyes."
"Out of seventeen, princess. I'm still beating you in Seeker's games."
"You are a disappointment to the Malfoy name. Association with mudbloods and filth! What have I told you! You are who you associate with! Are you a filthy mudblood?!"
McGonagall nodded sharply, "If you ever wish to hear more about them," she added in a more serious tone, "and you've completed all your work, I'll be here."
Draco rolled her eyes, flipping her hand dismissively, "He's a controlling old bat, of course. Who wouldn't want the famous Harry Potter in the palm of their hand?"
Harriet spent more time staring at the canopy ceiling alone with her, thankfully, more pleasant thoughts. Eventually she drifted off again.
"The stone can only be removed by one that desires the stone, but does not wish to use it. You of course cannot remove it, and neither can I as I wish to use it to bait Tom."
They stumbled into the room and saw the troll looming over a mess of broken stalls, the biggest pile in the corner was shifting and moving, whimpers coming from inside it.
despite that the stories put muggle-kind in a very poor light, now that Draco could see from that sort of view. They took place in a universe where the Statute of Secrecy wasn't in place and muggles often attacked magical kind, but Harry said it had a very compelling storyline and enjoyed the characters. Draco figured that whatever it got for her to read was fine by her, and pulled every book she had in her collection for the girl.
Weasley smiled, comfortable and far more open than previously, chuckling lightly "No offense taken. I didn't particularly enjoy being told off by prefects during my time either." Him and Proudfoot both looked at Draco and Harry, each of them holding hands as had been their habit together for a few months. It had just naturally happened as they had walked between classes and Draco half the time didn't even realize she had tucked their hands together.
Pansy hummed and turned to Draco, "Our snakey friend didn't hint at anything about this? You don't think it's her do you?"
Draco wished she was of age and knew a bit of dark untraceable magic to take care of those horrible muggles. But she wouldn't be able to keep an eye on the beast from Azkaban if she got caught using illegal spells on muggles. Plus it wouldn't put her proudly gained and newly found view on muggleborns in the best of light.
Draco hissed, "Yes! But I can't believe it's
"No, but here's the thing," Lavender leaned closer, "They served their detention last night with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest. Don't tell Milly, but something is killing unicorns."
Harry, for once, didn't pry. They just took a few meandering loops around the grounds. Outside in the fresh air, the further they traveled from the Manor itself, the tightness in her stomach seemed to lessen.
Hermione said, "They're probably in one of the bathrooms, if they didn't head straight to the Slytherin dorms."
Pansy continued to swipe at her nails, "She does look much better doesn't she."
Mrs. Patil put her hands on her shoulders, "I'm so glad it suits you. Parvati was the one to recommend green."
Draco only groaned and covered her blushing face with both hands, "Anyway," she uncovered her hands and glared at Harriet, the blush had spread further, "You're ridiculously powerful with your accidental magic, the other night was proof alone. Who knows what sort of protective enchantments that office contained? Much less such directed and intentional destruction, and I feel quite honored you decided to craft that protective barrier for Hermione and me."
Harriet's brain ground to a halt, trying desperately to come up with a socially acceptable excuse.
Lavender sat down and was practically vibrating with excitement, "So Harry, I have to tell you what happened after you left."
Just as quickly as the pain arrived, it disappeared, leaving Harriet breathless, the turban clad professor was back to his nervous twitchy eating. "Yeah. I'm fine. Just weird head pain. It's gone now."
Hermione frowned, "They don't really...well there are some that do. I think people feel uncomfortable with stuff that changes their worldview. I think if people realized that others just want to live their lives, they wouldn't mind so much."
intuition."
Hermione set her quill down and gave Draco her full attention, "Go ahead. I kind of wanted to pick your brain on Jiaolong as well."
"Yes! We just need a bucket of some sort of dye. Where would we get any dye?" Harriet sat up, her cucumbers falling into her lap as she did so.
Hermione frowned, "We do what we can. We plan. We figure things out. Make decisions off of the information we have. Then act on it. Same as every other part of life."
Lavender fanned herself in mock heat, "Teddy Waltman is so hot. Why do all the hot ones have to be gay?"
Hopefully the next chapter won't come out so painfully.
Weasley and Proudfoot looked awkward and Weasley finally said, "You know, Alex. I think we shouldn't bother them. Obviously that was a false trail. We'll leave you and Harry to your afternoon."
The Patil family lived in a flat in London, over top a laundromat,  and Harriet worried she might inconvenience them by not having enough space, but Padma, Parvati's Ravenclaw twin, just laughed as they opened the door to their home.
Harriet and the others replied with their own goodnight and pulled the velvet curtains on their beds.
Lavender's eyes glittered in excitement, "Ooh! What?"
"Huh…"
Lavender pouted, "Aw, you're no fun."
Harriet tilted her head, "Azkaban?"
Pomfrey shook her head, "At the moment, no. You're fine. But I wish to do a little more research. Would you be willing to come see me next time you are in pain? It will help me greatly get to the source."
"Who's the professor that's been glaring at me?"
Snape moved to pinch the bridge of nose. And yet he didn't do anything to stop them.
"DON'T INTERRUPT ME!"
"Next is Hagrid, he's the groundskeeper. I've heard he's half giant and has been breeding some sort of monster in the Forbidden Forest."
Parvati said something in that rapid Indian tongue and the old woman nodded and then said in English, "Yes, Parvati should show you where you are staying and so you can feel comfortable. Do you have any food you cannot eat?"
An odd question, but considering all the accidental magic she performed last night, it probably made sense, "Huh? Oh. I dunno. One time my cousin put gum in my hair and my aunt had to cut it and it grew back overnight. And then one time my cousin and his lackeys were chasing me at school and I found myself two floors up on the roof. Then there was the godawful jumper my aunt wanted me to wear that shrank so I didn't have to wear it. And at the zoo, there was a Brazilian python that was technically British because he told me he was born here though he really wished to go visit Brazil so I vanished the glass on the exhibit and let Dudley and his friend fall in, and then made the glass reappear so they'd be stuck inside. It was pretty funny actually. I hope the python made it to Brazil…I'm pretty sure the appearing on the school roof was the first I can remember, but that's all of them"
Parvati gave her sister a glare before replying, "Four floors, though only the first two have windows. It's magically enlarged."
Thank you for every single kudos, comment, or bookmark! I deeply appreciate every single one and it makes me feel so very fuzzy and wonderful!
Harry Potter and all that surrounded her was a puzzle, and Draco felt it her duty to figure her out. She'd always had enough to think about before, between Dumbledore's meddling, the dark magic with the broom, and Harry's trauma living with those terrible muggles. Oh, yes. Draco had read up on childhood trauma and abuse and all such things when she first heard about Harry's home life.
Harry glared, "What's wrong with Slytherin? Draco and Milly and Pansy are all wonderful."
"Hey!" Harriet gave a mock glare, but Draco's light barbs set her at ease.
Hermione said with a small smile, "Oh? Oh yes. It means to get someone's opinion on a particular topic."
"Git."
Draco practically pouted, "I wish I could. I know Father doesn't like muggleborns but Hermione is brilliant. Yes, there are things she misses culturally speaking, but she's respectful and talented and has shown a willingness to learn our ways."
Eventually baby Harriet had calmed down in her parents arms. It seems it only took barely a few seconds before she fell asleep, her parents cooing at her affectionately.
Thanks again to my friend Anra7777 who reads all my stuff!
Thanks again to the wonderful Anra7777!
Harriet sighed, "Sort of. As long as he doesn't say anything while he does it. He was teasing as if I actually like her. Peeves thought I actually
Pansy patted her cheek again fondly, "Yes, yes. That you were. You know I'll always support you in whatever endeavor you wish, but you

"Prat."
"There's more than one?"
Which led her to Thought Two, or perhaps One and a half as they were tied together: the no muggleborn rules are obsolete and pureblood supremacy is a lie.
And for all the comments and kudos and bookmarks, yinz are the best!!
Harriet frowned, did the hat have to sound like he was trying to create a megalomaniac?
Hermione shook her head, not that she didn't still have a thing for obeying authority, but it was surprising she didn't join in bashing Dumbledore as they had done previously on occasion. Hermione said instead, "I don't think it's that simple. He is manipulative, yes. He purposefully displayed his abundant power and used words meant to demean and diminish, but I don't think he wished to control Harriet as some sick twist of character. I don't believe he's doing it to be controlling for controlling sake. He doesn't seem to care much for fame. Plus, why target Harriet in the first place? Why her and not any other student?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Peeves grinned nastily, "Why Potty? You want me to prank the Slytherin princess? Don't you think she's already paying enough attention to you?" Peeves floated behind her, "Don't you know, the worst thing in the world is to be ignored."
Albus radiated pride at impressing his teacher, showing he still wasn't all that different from the flamboyant young boy he had been. Nicolas nodded and said, "Very good, Albus. You may continue use of my stone."
"Good. That's very good thinking, Miss Potter. The damage would have been far more extensive otherwise. Good job, Longbottom, to put and keep the cloth over her face."
Or at least it
"No no. It's fine." In comparison to the headaches she got from the garlic smell in DADA, or the beatings she had received from Uncle Vernon or Dudley, it was nothing. Plus the solution she was smearing on her wounds felt lovely.
"But in the pictures, my grandmother never wore the...thing!" Harriet worked her hands over her head in what she hoped described that scarf headdress.
They had talked about it one of the evenings, as Draco applied Harry's grandfather's hair potion to the beastly birdnest while they lounged on Draco's bed.
"I was just thinking, that you're the best thing that has happened to the Desi community of Britain in a long time."
That was until the trio of high pitched screams echoed from the room the troll had just entered.
Harriet growled. Ignore her? Malfoy? That nasty sour faced brat? Like hell. She stated as much, "Like I'm ever going to ignore that bitch."
"Not everyone wears hijab. And I don't think she was particularly strict in her practice, nor your grandfather in his. Probably why they worked to be honest, but who knows." Parvati said.
make it right."
"How easy are they to get off?"
"You can!"
Hermione explained, "It's a forbidden and illegal spell. It essentially puts another person under your will. Supposedly You-Know-Who was quite skilled at it and used it frequently. Like muggle mind control."
Harriet laughed but it seemed she was one of the few. She nervously fell silent.
"In a century," Harriet finished. Parvati was smearing some thick dark looking gunk on Harriet's face. They were having another sleepover party with the expectation to repeat it monthly. Lavender had already smeared the same stuff on Hermione's face and Hermione was returning the favor.
They had small talk for the rest of dinner, Hermione mostly taking the time to explain muggle dentistry to the other two in an attempt to explain her parents’ careers, but Harriet had to interrupt.
Harry frowned, "What about them?"
Milly spoke, switching Harriet's brain back to human speech, which was becoming easier and easier to recognize, "I always wonder what she's thinking. Is there something Matilda wants? What did she say?"
After class they spoke more on the subject in the Gryffindor girl's dorm room, decidedly the best place to find total privacy.
Harry nodded decisively, wary but mollified.
"But, Fathe-"
Draco made out what was really going on. She looked up expectantly to her father. Mother also looked up at him, losing the soft look in her eyes as she did so.
Albus was practically glowing with pride, "Yes."
Bang! A bit of dust fell from the ceiling.
Harry frowned again, getting that defiant defensive look on her face.
Pansy rolled her eyes, obviously not intimidated by Draco's rude behavior and then asked, "I'm bored. Also, can I borrow your notes for Transfiguration? I'm having trouble with making my spectacles into a looking glass."
Malfoy was the first one to start giggling, it started quietly and vaguely manic. Harriet looked at her, hair covered in wooden splinters and body covered in the stone dust that had fallen on all of them, coloring everything in light grey. There was a small trickle of blood from a cut on her cheek, that flowed to the corner of her mouth, and Harriet couldn't keep her eyes off of it. Malfoy's laugh.
Draco's heart could give out at any moment. She would perish at the ripe age of 11. Her irregular heartbeat and pain in her chest could only be symptoms of a dreadful illness. Death by the worst monster she could think of: Harry Potter.
Hermione suddenly looked nervous, "Well, no. I mean. I consider myself to be straight actually. But well. I…"
"Yes, Mother."
Pansy gave a small yawn and then pulled a nail file from her bag.
All the girls shivered and squeaked in response, Parvati exclaiming, "Don't say that name!"
Harry sighed deeply before continuing, "But if your dad wants things perfect like you said, I just can't get behind that."
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione just rolled her eyes, "Just don't push it. Focus on friendship for now," she emphasized by poking a finger to Draco's chest, "and figure yourself out. If you want to be in her life in any meaningful capacity, you're going to face danger. Either get over it, or move on."
Harriet grinned a little wickedly, "Charm? You're telling me I wouldn't be able to charm a few snakes?" She looked over at Matilda snoozing pleasantly on Milly's lap. Now that she knew it was there, she could feel a slight shift in her brain and then turned back to Draco, hissing, "I think I could handle myself with a few snakes."
Draco twirled a lock of hair around her finger. Her mother would scold her for such behavior, as it made her look either unintelligent, or worse, coy. But Mother also blamed herself for such things as "the Blacks were never very good at controlling their emotions."
The rest of the girls all laughed.
Pansy sighed dramatically, "I know. It's the worst," and then sat up attentively, "So? What's the news?"
"What unicorns?"
Once the final student, Zabini had sorted into Slytherin, the old headmaster gave what technically counted as an opening speech, and dinner magically appeared.
"Albus! Lovely to see you in the flesh again!"
After she had explained everything, Hermione bit her thumb in thought. It took her a while before answering, "You know, I was thinking something similar, but I didn't make the Jiaolong connection. I didn't catch that in our conversation. That was a good call."
I get you the first week this summer."
ever again."
Hermione paused mid-step, looking a touch green, "Oh god. The Slytherins. Malfoy and them don't know. They don't know about the troll."
can't seem leave well enough alone for reason I'm pretty sure you yourself haven't comprehended yet."
Albus said with a bit of pride, "We have just entered the two true protections. This room is a collaboration between myself and my potions master."
Draco thought a week with Harry outside of Hogwarts would be much the same as in, some ridiculous event after another equally ludicrous event. However the week had been wonderfully enjoyable. Harry had been properly curious about the ceremonies and festivities of Eostre, and though Father didn't allow Harry to participate in some of the prayers and incantations, she still seemed fascinated.
Seamus replied, "It could be just Peeves, but wouldn't it be great if someone managed to get those smarmy Slytherins? You girls know anything?"
They scrubbed the face masks off groggily in the bathroom and shuffled into bed. It didn't take long for Harriet to drift off, dreaming about a pink haired princess in a puffy purple ballgown riding a broomstick, turning all the peasants into Trevor the frog.
She sputtered and screeched, all wet and dripping, dark red crushed beets soaked into her hair and robes.
"Draco Malfoy is a… person of particular notoriety. She was born from both the Malfoys and the Blacks, two of the richest and most notable magical families in Britain," Parvati said with her usual eloquence.
Harriet grinned brightly and nodded. She didn't truly know if Professor McGonagall might have some or not.
Hermione and Draco both nodded.
Lavender looked at the staff table and started down the line, "So on the far left should be Professor Sprout. She teaches Herbology, and is head of Hufflepuff." She continued conspiratorially in an obvious loud whisper, "I heard she's got an arrest warrant in Nepal for roughing up a Buddhist monk."
As the Halloween feast just started to go underway, Harriet left the Great Hall, picked up the prepared bucket of crushed beets and juice from the dorms, and wandered the very empty castle in search of Peeves. She eventually found him hanging around Filch's office, painting rude words along the hallway leading up to it.
Harriet nodded, not quite knowing what got her concerned so much. She thought headaches were fairly common, even if it was unusual that it resided on her scar.
Then Harry gave a sardonic grin, lifting just one corner of her mouth, and said in her voice that Draco knew she thought she was being clever, "You would have been even more whiny than Myrtle. There should only be one ghost who died in a Hogwarts bathroom."
As Draco started pulling out her own potions work, she thought that she definitely understood Hermione's sentiment. Pansy and Milly could both be serious students, because most Slytherin families demanded it, but neither could really be considered avid scholars precisely. Draco was grateful to have made a friend in the muggleborn, as she seemed to be the only one one in their year to match her own love of learning.
"No! Why would I want to be with her! No! The only person I'd hate to be with more is Zacharias!"
Slytherin was a house for survivors of trauma, but Draco had been taught all her life that no friends worth making were in any house other than Slytherin. They were the elite and the cream of the crop and then there were the idiots of Gryffindor, the swots of Ravenclaw, and the mediocre of Hufflepuff.
Pansy said, "I do wonder though, about us being scared of him. Why are you reacting, Hermione? You didn't lose anyone, and yet Harriet who arguably lost the most is the one who couldn't give a flying bowtruckle."
When she showed the picture to her friends on the Hogwarts Express, who mostly cooed and complimented, Draco alone got a weird face that Harriet couldn't describe.
Draco grinned, forgetting she was in front of her father and it being less than polite behavior. She couldn't help but be pulled into their usual banter. She wasn't going to take this trash talk lying down, "As if. Our races say otherwise. I'm up by three aren't I?"
"Well she's not the only queen in the world, but she's one of them. Jiaolong would like you. There aren't many sssspeakersss and she caresss about the sssstudentssss. Jiaolong is one of the guardianssss of Hogwartssss. I could ssssset up a meeting. Take you to vissssit."
Harriet felt confused, there was obviously a lot she was missing, "Wait. I thought my ancestors were from India? How can they be Muslim?"
"The fourth years, right? Billy in Slytherin and Tommy in Gryffindor. Billy is the one dating that one really fit Hufflepuff."
"You are a disappointment. It was obviously a mistake inviting-" he said with an emphatic sneer,
He's a dick. He makes Draco cry. What else is new?
Harry glared even deeper and crossed her arms, "So he
It seemed Harry wasn't completely unaware of the change in atmosphere. She seemed to stop, and looked at Draco's father warily, then to her mother and Draco herself. Narcissa Malfoy had maintained her neutral expression, but Draco couldn't tell if she had herself as well. Harry took in their expressions, then her father's far more intimidating demeanor. She seemed to come to some mental conclusions and Draco could almost scream, as she saw what she knew was Harry's determined rebellious look.
Draco interrupted, "Ridiculously oblivious."
Her eyes widened in shocked disappointment, until Draco registered that Harry was openly mocking her. Draco pushed Harry down by her shoulder on her bed, the smaller girl going down easily, completely guileless only mocking with laughter. Draco wacked her with her pillow, "Don't you dare not invite me! And that's a horrible impression!"
Sadly, Harry herself wasn't wise enough to keep their muggleborn friend a secret from her father. It hadn't been a problem for most of the week, but Father had been home the Sunday before the end of break, as it was Easter and therefore a Ministry holiday.
Just after the door closed and they heard footsteps crunch on the gravel walk, Mother turned to the two girls with a supremely pleased look on her face, interrupting the scolding Draco was certain she was going to get from her father for her uncouth behavior.
Harriet dug into a dish of scalloped potatoes as the two new first year girls introduced themselves to her and Hermione.
"Do we separate as we get older?" Hermione questioned.
Draco has stuttered and blushed a bit before biting out, "Looks like you managed to fix your hair. Next, you better fix your face, Potter."
"Are you okay?" Neville said next to her, obviously the one holding her arm and guiding her down the corridor.
Hermione hummed, not commenting or teasing in the slightest unlike Pansy who wouldn't have let such a moment go without teasing Draco. She was reminded again that Hermione was a true gem.
Milly smiled gratefully and gave her hand a squeeze back.
Harriet tilted her head, "Why wouldn't they have worked?"
Nicolas hummed, "Are you sure it was her mother's protection of Miss Potter alone? Or just the magical protections of that house and her relatives? I would wager that her relatives might be in more danger, but Miss Potter is in no more treacherous a position than she was previously. She likely had considered them her family and that place her home, however it sounds as if that relationship has been destroyed. I think her mother's protection still remains over Miss Potter, but no longer on her former home and family."
Harriet looked at the smiling girl, and imagined a life with her. She caught herself from tearing up too badly and coughed in her hand nonchalantly. Professor McGonagall politely didn't acknowledge it. Instead turning a few pages, to a picture of her mother only a few years older. Her father was equally aged. "They were both head boy and head girl."
Professor McGonagall politely didn't acknowledge Harriet's distress and only grabbed her wand, waving it a few times over the books. A small stack of photographs appeared on top of them.
"Oh. I guess that would freak her out."
like Malfoy. Ugh. Terrible, right? Well then again no one would suspect that, right? Ugh. Terrible. Liking her? I guess as long as he doesn't name any names."
From the outside, Harriet wouldn't have expected much in terms of size, but the inside had been expanded significantly, most likely thanks to magic. The entrance led to a great room, large and open, with a place to remove your shoes, a sitting area with plush and comfortable couches, a dining area with a long table and chairs, and a large kitchen in the back. Small windows visible from the street were transformed into full ceiling to floor windows, giving the space light and airiness. There were already women waving their wands to send knives to chop tomatoes and onions and wooden spoons to stir pots on the stove. Two small wrinkly creatures with large ears were working with them, peeling and adding potatoes to a large pot. A pressure cooker was whistling in the background, and Harriet was overwhelmed with the smell of spices.
There was a group of about twenty students all late teens. They were grinning and bumping each other's shoulders, and there was one who knocked the tall wizard's hat off another, laughing and smiling.
Harry snorted, thankfully not too seriously, soothing Draco somewhat for being compared to such horrible people, "You so did. You were all-" Harry put her hand to her chest in what was a lowsy facsimile of Draco's aristocratic manner, "oh! You aren't one of those muggles are you? Who is that man?? He's like...hairy or something. I'm worried lower lifeforms might touch me! With his...hair!"
Harriet opened her eyes. Madam Pomfrey was an older witch with hair pulled up into a severe bun. She had kind eyes that didn't quite look as gentle as one would think. Harriet felt this was a woman that was trustworthy but shouldn't be crossed. Similar to Professor McGonagall in a way. Harriet remembered the question and shrugged, "Two, I guess."
Draco fell silent.
Lavender asked, "What about a dye of some sort?"
"Expertly done, girls! I couldn't have been more proud! Draco darling, the physical affection and bickering was a wonderful touch, and Harry dear, you were a true Slytherin just now! I couldn't have handled them better myself."
(See the end of the chapter for

So they kept topics to mostly polite conversations, classes and teachers, their friends and families. Mother seemed receptive to hearing of Hermione, though she did seem a touch surprised when Draco herself had complimentary things to say about the muggleborn. Draco again wished that she could tell her about Jiaolong, and her new viewpoints, but alas, she was going to follow Harry's lead.
Still, this was all fantastic news. Her father couldn't bar their friendship, even if it involved Hermione. The prestige was too great. After getting in a few more wacks, Harry, the beast, only laughing at it all, Draco exclaimed with quite a bit of wonder, "No one in the Malfoys has had an audience with the Flamels for generations. Father will be thrilled!"
Hermione hummed, "Pick as in 'pickaxe' I would think. Dig around in, I supposed."
"Nicolas."
Pansy nodded and crossed her arms with seriousness, "There are already quite a few rumors about that. Some seem more legitimate than others."
Peeves continued, "No really. Peeves and the princess are very much alike. We hate being ignored. Being ignored is the worst feeling in the world. If you really want to make the little snakey princess mad, just ignore her."
Peeves looked delighted, "So you like her too!"
Lavender shivered again, "See? That guy gives me the creeps. And I have an
Harriet grinned a bit nastily, "Yeah! The hair! Maybe slip something in her shampoo."
Lavender raised her hand, "And mine!"
Draco did her typical drawl, and twirled her fork in the air, "Fleemont Potter and the whole line of Potters of course."
There was a moment of silence where all of the girls looked at each other and then took a small breath of relief.
Draco's family might have sided with Voldemort? It didn't sound like it was with much enthusiasm. Though something confused her, as that was the second time she had heard that word 'imperioused', the last being the night before. "What does imperiused mean?"
Mother smiled pleasantly down on her, "Yes, Harry."
"Oh shit! That's the bathroom!" Harriet exclaimed and took off running, the other three at her heels.
Harry looked far too fierce for a tiny girl at whatever early hour it might have been, but she was doing that horrible thing where her green eyes practically skinned you alive. Draco hated that look...mostly.
Draco couldn't remember the taste of her breakfast after that. She could hear her mother distantly telling Harry to go find the broom shed, and that Draco would only be a while, as she walked to her father's study and her doom.
Malfoy nodded tentatively at first, before straightening her posture, attempting some sort of dignity. She replied, "Yes. Thank you, Granger."
Parvati snorted, "That's rich considering drinking was against your father's religion, not that he supposedly didn't indulge in occasion." She looked suddenly far more serious and continued, "So you know nothing about your Indian heritage?"
I love that Jo wrote virtually nothing about these ladies, so I can write ~Whatever I Want~!
Harriet frowned, "I've never met him before. What could I have done? But there's another teacher glaring at me?"
Harriet's breath hitched when she opened the box and discovered beautifully embroidered cloth, gold thread woven into emerald green in swirls and patterns. She lifted it up reverently seeing that it was a few different pieces, a set of matching clothes of some sort, and obviously of the highest quality.
Draco opened her mouth, she didn't particularly have any defense, "He...he just-"
"Any new recruits?"
"Four or five, maybe? Sometimes I get really sharp pain that feels like an eight."
Bang! They saw the door shutter but hold in place, shut tight.
Parvati gave an affectionate, but exasperated sigh.
Draco and her mother both stilled, with their spoons halfway in the air before Mother smoothly said, "Draco told me you have quite the skill on a broom. Youngest seeker since Harold Feverfew?"
They hit a snag again when conversation turned to Draco's chances of making the team next year.
Draco frowned and glared, though with far less venom as it seems she couldn't summon the energy quite so early. "Oh, nice to see the bird's nest is back on your head."
Harry's shoulders dropped in obvious ease, "Really?"
When Lavender yawned mid-sentence to talk about hiking through the southern part of Appalachia, the girls as a whole decided to call it a night.
Harry laughed a bit, in better humor, "Actually the reason I hated you so much was you did your whole," she waved her hand vaguely, "pretentious thing and insulted him at Madam Malkin's. You sounded just like my Aunt Petunia."
Albus said with a twinkle in his eye, "I cannot take credit for this. Each level was designed by a staff member. The more people involved, the less of a secret it is."
"Fresh spring peas and new potatoes in a béchamel sauce?"
After Hermione had herself a coughing spell, she was spurred into action, performing a cleaning spell on herself and the Gryffindor's.
Warnings for Dumbledore being an asshole and low-key abuser, and Harriet losing her shit about it.
disappeared in the light of having her new friend share her house.
Weasley obviously wanting to continue the conversation and properly suck up to Harry said, "Your friends sound absolutely lovely. I've even heard from my boys about some of them."
Draco frowned, "They're from the Ministry. Probably got someone making a false report."
That was a bit of relief for Draco. But still, how utterly stupid. As long as people could sire proper offspring, what would it matter what gender they were. She flipped her hand dismissively and said exactly that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco grinned proudly, "Of course, Mother," and hurried back to her library.
like me?"
"For now, scarhead!"
Dobby helped magic away her splotchy skin and red eyes, and Draco joined Harry at their broom shed. From what she could tell, Harry knew something had happened, but Draco rebuffed all of her questions with a shake of her head, and only just rose into the air on her broom. She didn't trust herself not to shamefully break down again.
She could see it honestly, as kids with trauma just need safety and security to begin to rebuild their lives. Being resourceful and cunning is just a different way of doing what you need to survive. In a time when muggles and muggleborns were truly dangerous, it would make total and complete sense to create such a place for traumatized purebloods.
Stay safe out there everyone!
Draco proceeded to explain the rumors she heard earlier.
"I...I can't accept this. It's too much! It's too beautiful!"
Hermione just looked at the bottom step nervously. After a second she got a determined look on her face and took the step, then another, each bringing a wide, bright smile to her face. She replied back to Harriet, "I'm brilliant. Thank you."
She wasn't wrong.
Ron said, "But Peeves usually works alone. You can suggest things to him, but he's a loose cannon, that one. Never quite know what he's going to do." Ron paused and then added, "Well, unless you're Fred and George, but those two are practically poltergeists themselves."
"She didn't tell you about your father's side?"
Draco sneered playfully, as if knowing full well what her insults did, "We'll try and do this logically. Do try to keep up if you can." Draco gave Harriet an appraising look and asked, "I have a feeling I know the sort of answer you'll give, but what sort of accidental magic did you do before you got your wand?"
Harry nodded, "Then we can tell your mom."
Dadi insisted, in her strong accent and firm grip on her hands, "A beautiful girl should have beautiful clothes. This is right."
Draco's father's eyes narrowed and Draco's breath caught in her throat, he asked, Harry seeming not to realize the danger, "Hermione. Who is this Hermione? Is she a Half-blood?"
Pansy exclaimed, "Seriously! Who would be stupid enough the mess with the Lehnsherrs?!"
Draco sighed reluctantly.
Bang! Beaver dams. Brick walls. Mountains. Whatever it was that would not let Harriet's magic fail!
Harriet nearly jumped in her skin at the surprise of Professor McGonagall's voice, she caught herself holding her heart and said shakily, "No, though I know of the game." Dudley had gotten a chess set for Christmas one year and it had lasted about 10 minutes before he'd grown bored of it and casted it off, thankfully mostly intact. Harriet had memorized the pieces and directions, but never got the chance to actually play the game.
"My mum is muggle, but comes from old money, distantly related to nobility, though it was lost a few centuries ago so I'm not a 'lady' or anything. But it was enough that the Death Eaters didn't bother with our family. They probably figured it would have been easy to blackmail us, and my mum passes well. She is always good at molding her image to what she wants."
Draco crossed her arms, and looked away at one of the corners of the room. The light peeking out from the side of the curtain was starting to grow as the sun was rising, "I'd rather not."
It's a bit late, but Happy Indian Republic Day!
Harry shrugged again, sounding a touch pitiful, "I dunno. Spout's okay too, I guess. I mean, everyone else is theoretically under Dumbledore's control. And as good nature as Hagrid is, he and the whole lot of them would all report to him. I can't really trust anyone in that school."
"I do not!"
"Well… your father was very… charismatic. He naturally was the center of attention wherever he went. If I'm honest, he had a bit of the personality of a spoiled prince. However he was nearly always good natured about it. Him and your mother didn't get along for a very long period of time. Fought like oil and water, if I'm honest. Lily was much more serious and studious and your father's lackadaisical attitude rubbed her the wrong way. He pursued her, and there were some that might think she had just been worn down by him, but I don't buy that myself. Your mother was an extremely capable witch that once determined, was equally extremely stubborn. I think she just realized she had more in common with James than she previously thought."
Still Professor Snape's behavior and motivations and Parvati's hand drawn family tree of the Potters and Rubabs were still etched in her mind. The family tree itself had a special place folded reverently in the bottom of her trunk. Despite the less than pleasant memory, Harriet still wanted to have a go at possibly seeing a picture of some of her family, so one evening after dinner, she waved off from the other girls and headed to McGonagall's office.
Her face mellowed out as she cupped Draco's face gently, directing her gaze at her, "Now we know, there is no use changing the past. All we can do is to do our best to work on our present and fix our mistakes. Right, Draco darling?"
Malfoy looked at Snape, seemingly to see if all this was safe. He nodded just slightly and she took the bottles from her with wary curiosity. "How do you have all this?"
Draco nodded, as if this wasn't new information to her and then redirected the conversation, "We're getting off the main topic here. Harry, it is a travesty that you don't know your own power." The other girls also nodded or gave their agreement in some way. "Even though logic is not your strong suit-"
Harriet crossed her arms defensively, "Like hell I'm ever going to back down from that bitch."
Her minions looked tentatively at their leader, who bit her dust and blood covered lip.
Harry had an expression that was a little gentler, but still had that core of metal, something fierce and almost protective, "Then explain it."
Between reading, teas with Mother, and roaming the Manor and grounds on both foot and on brooms, they kept themselves busy.
Draco humphed, "Still. Harry is going to drive me to tears."
Harriet grinned, "Good. Plus it'll be good for you to get closer to Cedric since you like him so much."
Professor McGonagall's eyes rose a touch in surprise, but settled into something a little more fond with a touch of pity. "Why, yes. I might have a few in my possession. Wait here a moment."
Lavender interjected with her own gossip, "Actually I heard she is due to be sole heir of both, though the Black inheritance is still a little sticky, with the prominent members in Azkaban. But they declared her Malfoy heir despite being a girl. Whoever she marries will have to take the Malfoy name."
Harriet frowned and couldn't think of a good retort in time for Draco to laugh in what seemed the most stereotypical mock.
Whatever. Harriet had more important things to think about. Her mind turned back to the events of the previous evening.
"And she hasn't got an ounce of femininity and there are days she forgets to put in the hair potion I bought for her. You'd think with how much I got for her, she wouldn't need to skimp. You don't think she would, would she? Like she's worried she would run out? I mean the stock from her grandfather's old company should continue to pay dividends. Unless she doesn't know she has money."
Pansy raised her hand, "The Parkinsons are Anglican."
This spurred at least a half hearted defense, she squeezed her coverlet tightly in her hands, blanching at the knuckles, "T-that's not a fair comparison! My family is nothing like those horrible muggles!" She still couldn't quite pull the same sort of venom as earlier.
"My first was when I summoned my favorite stuffed animal from a different room," Pansy offered.
Or at least until Bang! The door to the bathroom was struck.
Harriet felt a cloth placed over her face and a hand tug on her arm, leading her out of the classroom.
"Answer me!!"
"Y-yes, father."
The sound of a painful groan distracted Harriet and turned to the noise. Hermione was slouching in her seat and looking morosely at the ceiling, "Why did I think I might have actually missed you two?"
Despite initially fighting over where Harriet stayed for winter hols, Harriet herself did get to decide. Mostly it was between the two instigators, Parvati and Draco, and they were happy to continue to argue their cases.
And thank you for every single kudos and comment. I know I shouldn't use that as the reason I write, and deep down I don't...but god am I still totally blindsided by the love! Yinz are all awesome! For reals!!
Draco's breath caught in her throat. She turned her head to look at Harry directly. The girl was still staring up at the ceiling, seemingly distant, but then she turned her head toward Draco as well, piercing her with those big green eyes.
Pansy mimicked, "No. Of course not."
Draco squeaked from having her ticklish middle manhandled, "Don't you dare! You know I'm ticklish."
Though now that Draco thought further, it might not be such a bad thing Harry in particular wasn't so academically focused. With how powerful her core was, if she had any sort of scholarly ambition, she'd easily take over the world. Draco decided to say so aloud.
The Pug, the Thug, and the...Harriet still couldn't think up a good something to call Draco Malfoy, either way the three spun on their heels giggling all the way back to the Slytherin table.
She felt she was just
Dumbledore continued brightly, "And now the school song!"
I just want to say it again, but every single comment and kudos and bookmark means so much to me. Thank you so much! It really helped me push through whatever writing funk I've been stewing in. Yinz are absolutely the best!
That gave her pause, and after a second she spoke her thoughts aloud, "I dunno. Maybe? I only just found out I
Harry struck out her hand, for him and the Auror, Alex Proudfoot, who also introduced themselves.
I wish I had a Professor Sprout growing up. One of my goals for this fic is explore characters that don't get a lot of attention. I figured that the head of Hufflepuff and teacher for at least a decade has a great deal of kindness and wisdom to share.
Lavender grinned widely, "Guess that means the whole of Gryffindor girls is brown!"
All of this speculation on Harriet's part had a bit of an odd effect. Next Potions class, Harriet didn't react with the same vehement anger at the bullying, and instead just looked at Professor Snape with confusion when he sneered and criticized her for her poor technique at squeezing helius pods, and not warning Neville that he had added his ingredients in the wrong order. She just looked at him puzzled and a little hurt. If he cared about his mother so much, why was he treating her so poorly. She wished could talk to him about her mother. She wanted all the information she could get!
"You just don't understand,  Harry." Harry needed to understand how important her father was. But she was always so illogical! Couldn't she see? Her father commanded respect wherever he went!
Hermione nodded and then said with some seriousness turning to Harriet, "I didn't tell them what happened. Do you feel comfortable about that, Harriet?"
Harriet shook her head, "They told me my parents were killed drunk driving."
That's a thought. Most of her life felt completely out of her control. Options to shape her own destiny...but she also couldn't stand being so obviously and forcefully manipulated, by an albeit clever and probably extremely worldwise after centuries of sortings hat.
Hermione asked rather expectantly to Lavender, "So you promised we'd hear more about your muggleborn ancestors next sleepover."
They just weren't born in the years around the war.
"Huh?"
This completely threw Draco for a loop, "Why ever not? What is wrong with my father?"
Lots of warnings about rationalizing abuse and racism, and also mentions of miscarriage and imagined infanticide.
As the others all looked a little worried for them, Hermione hit Harriet's shoulder in rebuke, "Harriet is teasing. Quicksand is a very very rare geological phenomenon. It
part of speculohylus."
Madam Pomfrey finished with the pink gel solution and cleaned up the cloth and bottle. She opened up a different potion, this one a bit foul smelling but with a sharp herb scent, as she wiped it along Harriet's skin, the redness slowly faded, as if the skin was growing another layer over the harsh red one. Perhaps that was exactly what it was doing.
Thanks again to Anra7777, who reads all my crap before hand, and isn't even in this fandom much anymore.
The hat laughed at Harriet's stray thought, "Just because evil has come from Slytherin, doesn't mean the other three don't have it in them. There has been plenty of evil done in the name of good. All four houses produce witches and wizards of distinction, and all have done both good and ill in the world. Also, power doesn't always mean evil either. In Slytherin you would have more options to shape your own destiny. I'm sure that would be appealing to you."
They both halted in mid-air and then moved to stand in attention, looking a touch shamed.
"He doesn't like me, Draco. And he doesn't like Hermione."
Bang!
"'Pick your brain?' Is that a mugglism?"
Harriet felt like she could have stared at that photo alone for hours. However McGonagall turned a few pages and Harriet gasped. There was a picture of her mother and father holding a chubby and squirming baby.
Sorry to leave you on that cliff hanger. It might take me a bit to write the next chapter. I'm currently living in the DC area, and a little shaken up by everything going on.
Draco sputtered and frowned, "That's not the point!"
Hey all. It's been a while. I know this is a bit of departure of POV but one of my ultimate goals for this fic is exploring points of view that never got explored in the original text. All that crazy stuff going on behind the scenes. That and trying to show that most people feel they have legitimate reasons for doing the things they do, even if they're detrimental to others. Life is not a dichotomy.
Wait, Hermione was a girl born with a penis? Like Great-great Aunt Octavius? It was rare but not unheard of. "So it doesn't have anything to do with magic?"
Up in the air, looking down on the pond and folly built by Draco's great great great uncle Wilburforth, she felt it a little easier to breathe. To pretend like the last few minutes hadn't happened at all.
"The professor that's glaring at me?"
She forced herself to turn her thoughts back to Jiaolong to Thought number Three, which was the most concerning but also the most tenuous and with the least amount of evidence, and yet Draco couldn't quite get out of her head.
Albus nodded, "It's a multifold protection. Not only does it prune any extraneous people, there is also a mild potion that lowers inhibitions and encourages people to pull from their desires. Anyone who happens to be imperiused would feel it twice fold and strengthening the next room's protection." He waved his wand over both of them, dispelling the previous charms and casting a chilling charm that seemed to have Albus's own personal magical signature. They then stepped through the fire and into the next room.
Albus hummed in mild interest.
After weeks of Malfoy's nasty looks, attempts to trip Harriet both in actuality and metaphorically, and verbal sniping between the two of them, Harriet was more than ready to humble the blonde. Malfoy hadn't tried to pull anything too physical, under Snape's watchful eye, but that didn't stop even a drop of animosity between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remember?"
Defeated yes, but dead no.
Pansy shivered, "There's no way. Who in their right mind would kill a unicorn and drink its blood?!"
Draco snorted again and started taking out her own books and parchments, "Well the path to Hades is built with good intentions."
Draco just hummed.
Draco's stomach dropped out.
"Oh, come on! I think I look nice! You can't actually still be upset about me going to Parvati's rather than your house."
(Can you tell I'm a Ravenclaw?)
Draco's lip quivered. This was the worst. Harry didn't understand. Couldn't understand. She was a failure. Her goal of getting Harry to trust her father had completely failed. Truly and utterly. She wanted to run to Mother and just cry in her lap. Then Draco remembered. Her mother. Maybe all wasn't totally lost.
Hermione hummed, a little worried, but said nothing.
"The fifth year Herbology students were working on it earlier this year, but it disappeared over Christmas, and Sprout's got them on something else."
Well, whatever meddling Dumbledore might have, Harriet had the best friends in the world to fight, and was assured that between them, they'd figure it all out.
Harry tilted her head and then seemed to realize what she said, "Oh. I guess that's an idiom you don't have. Muggle thing, I guess. I mean, er. How to explain? It's like you get something? Like extra? With doing something? Like you hit a bird with a stone, which I guess is hard enough, but you get more because you hit two of them?" She scratched at her hair in frustration, "Hermione always manages to explain Muggle things better than me."
Mother gave Father a complicated look, Draco thought she seemed cross, though her smile never left her face, "Did you know, Lucius? Harry here told us she was nearly sorted into Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally wished to place her there, but Draco had made such a poor first impression, she told the hat to place her elsewhere."
Parvati glared at her sister a little more deeply and said something that sounded a little biting in that rapid fire Indian language, then turned back to Harriet and said sweetly in English, "The first floor is the living area, second floor is rooms for my grandparents and uncle and his wife and our aunt. My parents and us and one of my cousins from the uncle on the second floor are on the third floor, and my second uncle and his wife and kids and another cousin and his wife and daughter live on the fourth. There's also a rooftop garden on top of that."
"Hey!"
Harriet took a breath, trying to take in her own reflection, already having memorized the details of the few pictures of her grandmother. Harriet saw her distinctive hair, now much more manageable and shiny, but still with so much volume. Harriet decided to put Draco's gift to use more often.
"What about my parents?"
McGonagall smiled gently, "I taught both of your parents, Miss Potter."
Lavender nodded seriously, "They had to try and find the poor things so Hagrid could put them out of their misery. They couldn't find what was doing it, but Jimmy said there were signs that whatever it was that was killing them, was drinking their blood. Bite marks and the way the blood was smeared."
Hermione was happy to perform spells for both of them, as they had to follow the decision of their leader. Thankfully it wasn't too awkward as Hermione only took a few seconds for each of them.
POV change! I love Draco to bits.
They made it up to their room, a sign on the front stating 'First Years,' and there were four four-poster beds hung with red velvet drapes inside. It looked just as cozy as the common room did, and Harriet smiled widely. She could already feel that this would make a great home. It was dark, but Harriet could see a wide field with some tall stands out the window and the forest beyond. It was brilliant, all of it, and she couldn't wait to get settled. She discovered her trunk was placed in front one of the beds close to the windows, set between Hermione and Parvati, with Lavender on Parvati's other side.
She continued, Draco now could very much place her eyes, fierce, glaring straight at her father, her mouth still in a pleasant smile, "It seems that Draco said some particularly rude things about Harry's new friends. Now Draco has felt terrible because she has deprived the world of Slytherin Harry Potter."
If you hadn't guessed, Dumbledore was totally using Legilimancy the whole time. Sorry Dumbledore lovers out there. I think he was a great military leader and a genius magician, but a bit of a sociopath. No wonder Tom saw him as an equal.
Whatever level of surprise he might have had, didn't show on his person, outside of a few moments of speechlessness. They probably made quite a picture. The dust was off of them, but there was still wood in most of the girls hair, Harriet noted Malfoy's had a pink hue now that the dust was off it. Not to mention the ruined stalls, and the stench of troll that had definitely not dissipated.
Albus nodded a little regretfully.
Father had been home for the day they celebrated Eostre, which was wonderful. She rarely saw her father, and she hoped that she had made a good impression, showing what a properly good host she was growing into.
Lavender grinned and put her chin in her hand, "You would think, but nope. Not a clue."
person I meet is you, who proceeds to insult and tear down the only person who had ever
There was silence before Hermione murmured, "That could work, actually. Peeves is rather equal opportunity, and would remove suspicion."
"No, but what if we just dumped it on her head? You know, accidentally," Lavender bumped Harriet shoulder to make the finger quotations.
Harriet looked in awe, "Wow." She was beyond impressed by all that fitting in what appeared was such a small space, but there was a part of her that was happy for Parvati, having such a large family readily available. A part of her was worried about keeping track of them in the two weeks she was there.
Though as she got into another argument with her twin, them lobbing back and forth in that foreign tongue, Harriet wasn't sure Parvati truly appreciated all this family. It made her have a small private smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was ashamed that she curled on the floor and cried.
Mother smiled kindly, "Thank you very much. You're very understanding. I am sorry you had to travel all this way. I wish you both a Happy Easter."
A girl with smooth plated hair spoke up first, "I'm Parvati Patil. Nice to meet you."
Hermione just smiled and then pulled back out the potions text, "Now. With that in mind, let's get back to our real jobs, rather than the perpetual side project of saving Harriet Potter from herself."
Harriet lifted the bucket of beets, "I need you to dump this on Draco Malfoy's head for me."
"Is it pick as in 'choose,' or pick as in to 'play' like a harp or lyre?"
When they turned to Milly for her turn, she said with a touch of nervousness, "We were neutral too...sort of. I'm half blood."
Pansy examined her nails, "Not my fault we all agreed I throw the best parties, darling."
Harry threw her hands up in the air in frustration, "Your dad hurt you! I'm not going to respect anyone like that!"
Harry nodded firmly, "Yeah. Your mum is cool. I like her."
A girl with dark skin and lighter wavy hair said, "Lavender Brown."
Nicolas jumped down the pit and heard Albus trill the final twirling notes of "for ye slew me love on Yarrow, and you left me to sing sorrow," above him before he also dropped and landed in what Nicolas guessed correctly to be a bed of of devil's snare.
Draco opened her mouth to say something, but thought otherwise, shut it, and nodded firmly, "Good. Exactly. Glad we're in agreement."
that everyone should go along with her reckless plans. Harry was also obnoxiously oblivious! She had not a shred of situational awareness, and why oh why did she have to be so terribly adorable! Who gave her the right!
"Your father was on the Gryffindor quidditch team and was an excellent chaser. He eventually made team captain and had won me the cup. I remember quite a few points that professionals wouldn't have been able to perform."
Nicolas hummed, patient in expectation.
Harry snorted, "Why can't you just call it a cream sauce or something?"
Harry hummed, half in pleasure as Draco noted proudly that she enjoyed her ministrations, "Kind of?"
"Oh? So that's what you used your money for? To fix yours?" Harriet bit back.
"Not. Slytherin. And definitely not Hufflepuff either!" Harriet thought as loudly as possible.
Harriet smiled, and Hermione did too, before nodding and with a certain amount of seriousness, she magically dismissed the dust off of Malfoy. The other two Slytherins also agreed with the Thug...what was her actual name again? Well at least the bigger mousy haired girl asked, "May I too?"
Hermione said, "Well devil's snare is a N.E.W.T. level subject."
Nicolas sighed, "Ah. Now I've gone and poked at your hornet's nest as well. Give me a good reason why I shouldn't join your chess board then. What machinations do you have around Miss Potter that has you so riled up?"
"I'm ever so glad you managed to make friends with her. I can't even imagine the headaches I'd get if those few weeks before Samhain continued and you kept pretending tormenting her was the best way to get her attention and make an impression. Well...half pretending. You couldn't ever really get your jealousy under control."
Hermione nodded and smiled a little tightly, she seemed to exude focus and intent and Harriet noted her eyes were red rimmed as if she hadn't only had difficulty sleeping, but had been crying also, "I- I am really,
Draco said, "So, Hermione. I want to get your opinion on something not related to school. Stuff related to Jiaolong."
"Just read the damn letter," The horrid beast rolled her eyes and handed the parchment to Draco. She had to fumble with her wand and a weak lumos, and then it took her a few minutes to focus enough to absorb what she was reading, but it would have been worth it to read the letter through multiple times regardless.
Harry looked thoughtful for a bit, Draco waited for her answer. She knew Harry wouldn't sugar coat or pretend something was okay when it wasn't. Maybe Draco wouldn't be a complete failure. Maybe Mother had made enough of a good impression, "Oh...uh...well. I'd be okay with you telling your mum. But would she keep it a secret from your dad?"
Melody cottoned on to what they were actually asking, "No. You'll stay in the same room, but your year and the second and third years are much smaller than normal. During the war there weren't nearly as many births among magical families. Actually, you all will have to share classes with the other houses too. They started having to do that with the third years when they started. It's happened a couple times through Hogwarts history, but I've heard it's not terrible working with the other houses. Hufflepuffs are pretty bril."
I tossed in another Scarlet Witch reference. Harry has been reading a version of X-men.
have been living in a cupboard!"
, by the boys scooting up the table to them. The first year Weasley, Ron was laughing and pounding his knee, "That was wicked! Peeves is annoying most of the time, but I change my mind. He can set off a million dung bombs and I won't care." Ron just laughed, and Dean and Seamus looked just as amused, laughing as well.
Harry sighed and looked away, disappointed, "I don't actually know what your dad did to you yesterday, but I don't like him and I don't trust him. We're not meeting the Flamels if he knows."
Harry won't spend as much time with the Wesleys, not that I don't love them to bits. They're all black holes of friendship. Suck you in and give you love and chunky sweaters. But Harry's relationship with them has been done before and I'd love to explore bonding among the Gryffindor Girls.
The other two Slytherins also bowed to the four of them and repeated their leader's words.
"Now now. Here's at least your chance to show off. Show me what your genius has prepared to protect my stone."
Harry huffed and rolled her eyes, "Draco's my friend. I'm spending the spring hols with her. But you didn't answer my question. Are you related to the Weasleys?"
You all just got hit with a bunch of my deeper head canons.
Nicolas hummed, they had reached the doors of the castle by then, and didn't comment as Albus placed a disillusionment and anti-eavesdropping charm on them both before they entered. Supposedly the children wouldn't be returning until late that afternoon, but it wouldn't do to be overheard by either staff or any remaining students.
Hermione hummed, "I do know some color changing spells."
Lavender put her chin in her hand, "Well he is crazy powerful. He probably doesn't even need to use a wand or incantation at all."
McGonagall smiled gently and waited a bit before she opened the second leather bound book, "I have quite a few more pictures of your parents." She showed a picture of students of varying ages, there was a boy with glasses who looked to be not much older than herself with messy hair and dark twinkling eyes, similar to the mischief he saw in Fleemont's eyes from the last picture. They all were in odd robes with leather padding and each were holding brooms.
The mountain troll followed toward the sparks, swatting them in the air as Albus and Nicolas skirted around him and to the next door. As they entered the next room, flames erupted behind and in front.
Padma grinned a little meanly, "Magical enlargement."
Milly shifted around a little uncomfortably but smiled at Parvati, "I don't really. I mean, we had a telly, but I never really watched it. It was mostly etiquette lessons and posture and dance and things like that. I liked the abraxas riding lessons, though we started with muggle horses first. I mostly just spend time with them and the other creatures that live on the property. I still ride my muggle horse, Sunshine."
She said hesitantly, "I, er, don't know how to put it on. Would someone be able to help?"
"In what way?"
Hermione sighed and reached for her school bag in the rubble, holding out three plastic bottles. Plastic? Harriet hadn't seen a single plastic object since before she boarded the Hogwarts Express.
Lavender nodded, "It's the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. He's more sneaky about it, but if looks could kill..." Lavender shivered.
Hermione rolled her eyes.
"I can see you've failed to steer the Potter child in the right direction. Am I under the assumption that you've been associating with a mudblood for as long as you've been associating with the Potter brat?"
Draco bit her lip and didn't answer. She looked around the study for some sort of savior, but only saw the house elves Pepsy and Dobby cowering in one of the corners. No. She was alone.
Malfoy is turning into the type of tsundere that would berate Harry for not dressing properly for the cold weather, and simultaneously take off her own jacket, hat, scarf, and gloves to give to her.
Lavender nodded, "So far, we know a patch of devil's snare is guarding it."
Before Weasley could backtrack at offending Harry she continued.
Hermione grinned brightly when she spotted Draco, "I couldn't wait to talk to someone sensible. I'm getting rather sick of dealing with the other girls at the moment. With all their whinging, you'd think they didn't realize they're here to attend
This time of year it formed rows and rows of white blossomed trees. She ducked under the canopy and was absorbed into a tunnel of white flowers and fresh green new leaves, rows and rows of them. Draco couldn't help but laugh at the sheer beauty and joy of it.
Hermione waved her own hand around, "Hasn't he already? And of course we will do what we can to protect her."
I essentially had to rewrite it a few times, but I finally feel okay about it.
Harry growled, "Try again. What really happened?"
Draco rolled her eyes and continued curling her hair, "You make it sound so easy. This is the Dark Lord, we're talking about."
"I hope you haven't been the target of Fred and George's trouble?"
"I bet you can't catch me!" Draco shouted before dipping her broom into a dive. The folly was built as a replica of the Parthenon, and Draco ducked and weaved between the columns, with Harry just at her heels.
Parvati looked particularly concerned, though Hermione interrupted, "Would you prefer Harriet over Harry?"
Parvati laughed a bit, shaking off some of the nerves, "Well that seems a perfect place to start actually. Aren't you scared? There are always whispers of You-Know-Who coming back." She frowned and put her chin in her hand, "All of our families had experience with him in one form or another. Lavender's mum lost her first husband and my grandma lost her brother. Not that you haven't obviously lost a great deal to him, but you don't seem scared."
The four girls looked at each other and Parvati asked, "How many girls are there to a room?"
Harriet looked at her curiously, "How am I pagan? And how would you know that?"
"I would have paid good money to see that."
As they continued their walk up the long road to the castle, Albus admitted he'd followed Nicolas's theories on the power of eusocial magic and placed Harry Potter in the care of her less than supportive blood relatives. That had been a good portion of Nicolas's research the previous century, the discovery that ants, and bees, and meerkats, and elephants, and crows, and humans and all manner of creatures will perform extraordinary tasks as individuals for the benefit of others. Altruism in extraordinary fashion was a powerful and necessary magic. It was a glue that held both society and individuals together.
"Obviously. But he is weak enough that he must remain in hiding. He hasn't shown any capabilities for any sort of direct attack."
Harriet was shocked, "W-what? I'm Indian?" Her mind was suddenly reeling. She always looked different from her relatives, and Aunt Marge always had strange rantings about poor breeding, but she never thought she had family from India of all places. It shed new light on some of her relatives' behavior. She wasn't nearly as dark as Parvati, and in fact was the second palest of the four girls, Lavender being just slightly more light, and Hermione being the darkest of the four of them. But she had always been different from the Dursleys, and had found out it wasn't just because of her magic.
"The Mirror of Erised?"
Nicolas hummed, "Since Miss Potter took the initiative to write to me about my stone, I returned the invitation to meet."
Harriet swallowed the bite she was chewing before answering, excited to have the opportunity to introduce someone she knew for the first time in her life, "I'm Harriet Potter. This is Hermione Granger. We met on the train ride over." Hermione gave her own wave and smile.
They usually
The lot of them had agreed that instead of Harriet returning home for the summer, she would spend a little over a week at each of their houses, the summer break time divided six ways. She was extremely excited about the prospect, both for escaping the Dursleys, but also spending time with her friends and experiencing part of their lives.
There were plenty of distractions at school in the time it took for the beets to arrive. Quidditch was ridiculously fun, and Harriet took to it like a house on fire. Classes were fascinating, and Hermione was a god-send with any of the written material Harriet had difficulty absorbing. Harriet was happy, having friends for the first time in her life, and pictures of her family she could gaze at in the evenings. Friends, future, and family in a weird way. Life was really really great.
The hall erupted in laughs and giggles, Malfoy stood up and stomped out of the hall, her two faithful cronies on her heels. They were both hit with the muck, but for the most part spared the worst of it.
shown me kindness up until that point. You're a bully. And arrogant for stupid reasons. And I don't want to spend time with someone who only pushes others down to make themselves higher. I had enough of that with my relatives and I'm not going live like that here!"
As Melody led Parvati and Lavender up the stairs, Hermione stopped dead in front of the first step, Harriet ran into her back from being lost in thought.
"Do you have any particular aptitude in school, Miss Potter?" Father asked conversationally over their breakfast of oeufs cocotte.
Draco was confused, they weren't due for any company. With a quick word between them, Harry and her decided to check out who it could be, and peeked around the corner from the foyer.
Harry shouted louder. Draco was thankful that their rooms were on a completely separate wing than her parents quarters, or someone might hear them. "If anyone hates on my friends, I'm not going to sit still on it! You're too important to me! Hermione is too important to me!"
"Good evening, Miss Potter. What can I do for you?"
The face masks were finished and Hermione handed out sliced cucumbers, chilled by a quick spell. Everyone laid back on their spots on the floors, with numerous pillows and blankets nesting them.
Draco opened her mouth to speak more derision against that old bat, but then closed it. Hermione was right in that it was odd. Even if, for argument sake, he was a little twisted, why did he only target Harry? It did seem a bit much for fame. He was famous all on his own. She felt a bit foolish that she hadn't thought of that herself. She said tentatively, "Well...Harry is obviously special."
Harriet giggled a bit and then opened her mouth to say something more but whatever else she was going to say was interrupted as Matilda. She seemed to have been taking a nap inside Milly's robes, and slithered out, giving a wide yawn, "What a niccccce dream."
Milly said, "Bulstrods too."
But perhaps the boogie man wasn't so fictional after all. Jiaolong and Dumbledore certainly seemed to think so.
They stayed out as long as Draco dared, but after skipping lunch, Draco thought they might escape her father's notice if they took an afternoon tea with Mother. She couldn't remember a time her father actually attended afternoon tea, even on ministry holiday.
Harry snorted, "I can see that."
"Well then, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around, would you?" the Weasley threatened.
"Ugly."
"Tom Riddle is still out there. I fell into the same mistakes and didn't act when I needed to."
Parvati huffed, "There's more to being Indian than religion!"
The old woman looked at her and switched to a strongly accented English, "Harry Potter? We are happy to have you. It is an honor. Please come in and have something to eat."
Draco waved her hand dismissively, "I wouldn't worry too much. Hermione is so dedicated to following authority figures, she probably had a crisis of faith from shattered expectations."
Harriet said with derision, "Money, making sure her cronies are properly laughing at her jokes, her hair."
That and I want to have every single minority Jo has ever hated on...
Hermione only blushed, but looked pleased.
It might have been the arguing or the adrenaline or her temper or just the surreal situation in general, but the things Harriet kept very very well guarded just spilled out, "Well I remember it vividly! After eleven years living in a fucking cupboard under the stairs with barely anything to eat or do or see or anyone to talk to other than my godawful relatives, I get the news of my life from the first person who had ever shown me even an ounce of kindness and introduced me to magical world, and then the
Pansy exclaimed, "The Seeker?"
Speaking of headaches, Harriet figured it was a good time to ask, "Madam Pomfrey? This doesn't really have anything to do with this, but do you have anything for headaches?"
"She's a muggleborn. And one of my very best friends. And she's absolutely brilliant."
Hermione nodded, "I usually would agree with Lavender and think he was just being thoughtless about his magical prowess, but I also read that he was trying to control Harriet, too. Some of the words he used were purposefully demeaning."
Harry pierced her with those basilisk eyes again, "Can you honestly tell me a world without Hermione would be perfect?"
Albus chuckled, "Oh yes. I remember. You said she broke into your library if I recall?"
"What?"
Harriet flushed from the unnecessary attention, but spotted Hermione sitting in Gryffindor and made a beeline for her. The tiny feeling of regret and potential
"Why not? You would be great in Slytherin. You could prove your worth beyond your famous name. Find friends to help you achieve your desires. Power to shape your world as you see fit."
Pansy added in with a sing-songy voice, "
Also the peas and potatoes in béchamel is an Easter tradition in my family. It's super delicious and quite fattening. One of the first ingredients in making a béchamel sauce is a whole stick of butter...
Draco opened her mouth to say something dismissive, and then closed it, finally speaking, "You're talking about the muggleborn issues again, aren't you?"
Weasley raised his hands up, obviously trying not to offend Harry. "I'm glad you've found such good friends! Really!"
"Does it have those sandwiches with the cheese?"
After Pomfrey was done, Harriet was left alone with her thoughts. Most of them were drifting to the question of Professor Snape. He had protected her eyes just now, despite very obviously avoiding her. So does he care? Or does he not? Not that she didn't appreciate it in comparison to his previous behavior, but Harriet was just left further confused. Adults were confusing.
"That is your grandmother Zeba Rubab."
"Do you think it'll go away?"
Hermione hummed in agreement, "He does look very Tolkien-esque."
Draco continued, it was easy to insult Harry, but it felt wrong for anyone else to. That was her job. "And she's oblivious, not only about everything going on around her, but her own power! And she knows next to nothing about the magical community or herself or her heritage and I have to explain the most simplest concepts! She's like a toddler wielding a wand: a danger to herself and everyone around her!"
Warnings for Lucius's verbal abuse.
It felt as if the hat might have sighed in disappointment, "All right, if it won't be Slytherin, you'll be in GRYFFINDOR!"
Harriet had received some fancy Belgium chocolates from Pansy, a hand carved wooden whistle from Hagrid, more sweets and toffee from Lavender, a book on Wizarding families of Britain with muggle post it notes marking what was likely Harriet's relatives from Hermione, a soft and warm blue scarf from Milly, and a large crate that Harriet didn't know whether to be touched or offended that held half a year's supply of her grandfather's hair potion from Draco.
"Answer me!!"
"I don't care if I owe you a life debt! My hair is pink! Pink!" Malfoy screeched.
Despite all this, Harriet had been having an excellent week. Charms and Transfiguration were fascinating and fun, and Harriet had real friends for the first time in her life. Things were brilliant! However the fourth Potions class since the 'Sobbing Snape' incident was particularly eventful.
At least Mother had seemed pleased throughout the week. While Father spent most of his time outside flitting to his important business, Mother was home with her and Harry. They had frequent teas between the times Draco showed Harry various parts of the grounds and manor and introduced Harry to some Wizarding fiction. She needed to get that girl some interest in reading if she was going to make up for the shortfall in those thrice-damned muggles' education and Harry's upbringing.
of Harry's ticklish spots. So she won. She declared it so, in her own mind at least.
Nicolas slowly smiled. It really was impressive. Removing the ability to only have one person in the room would destroy the ability for only Tom or whoever he had imperiused or posessed to enter. From there, desire to use the stone was the ultimate stop gap.
Dammit. "O-of course not."
Harry grabbed Draco's hands again, "Look. Draco. I like your house. And the manor. It's pretty and prissy and a lot like you. I've had a lot of fun here. I like your mum a lot. She's smart, and cool, and a little bit scary but in a good way I think. And she loves you, a lot."
Draco looked away, "Nothing."
Harriet just tilted her head, "Huh? I'm not powerful. Or I don't feel particularly powerful."
Parvati shouted at Hermione, "What was that spell?"
Draco hissed, "Slytherins aren't known for their bravery! Not everyone can just shut off their fear like that!"
Harriet didn't speak as Pomfrey wiped the potion on her face. It tingled a little as it worked.
Harry snorted, "Are you joking? Draco and I have practically been training the whole time." She said with a little pride, "She's going to make Slytherin Seeker next year. It'd be more fun to play with her and have more competition. Besides, Gryffindor can take whatever they have to dish out, right Draco?"
The other three all nodded with determination, and ran off together. They didn't quite know where to go as there were a few likely bathrooms the Slytherins could have gone to, or even they could have gone back to their dorms in the dungeons, making their quest completely for naught. However fortunately or perhaps unfortunately it didn't take them long to find the troll.
Harriet laughed and welcomed the interruption from such pleasant and uncomplicated company. It seemed all Matilda wanted in life was to sleep, cuddle with Milly for warmth, and have a quail egg once in a while. Seemed like a good life. "Hey, Matilda. What did you dream about?"
Also Hermione read in Hogwarts: A History that the stairs to the girls dorms kick out boys. She was just nervous it wouldn't let her in. The castle knows Hermione is real girl, unlike what our dearly departed author might think.
Harry was a touch more agile, but Draco knew the grounds better than her own hand. She dodged topiaries and under arbors. She led Harry on a meandering chase taking her slowly to one of her favorite parts of the grounds: the apple orchards.
Harry nodded again, "I'm sure she'll be okay. The girls in Gryffindor are all really nice."
Hey all! This chapter was my favorite to write so far. I hope you enjoy it.
As Harriet laid down on her pillow, she worried briefly that she was too excited to rest, but it didn't take long before she fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
Harriet felt proud to actually get that reference, but Lavender continued, "Dumbledore's incredibly powerful. Probably got more magic than anyone in this room, possibly everyone combined. He defeated Grindelwald and was the leader of the secret army fighting You-Know-Who."
"Aren't you scared?!"
"But I can't use the excuse it's for her birthday! You're getting her for her birthday."
"Nothing," Hermione said nonchalantly.
Weasley laughed loud and open, and even Proudfoot seemed to crack a smile.
Hermione frowned, "I wish we had more information ourselves. The broom incident still doesn't make sense. And there's still the matter of the third floor corridor."
"I didn't say anything," Harriet grinned widely. Teasing Draco could make any morning brighter.
"It was a beautiful day and the ceremony was lovely. The weather couldn't have been more perfect. I believe this might have been one of the last pictures of your grandparents as all four died not long afterwards of natural causes."
Hermione and Parvati expressed their willingness, though Lavender just grinned a little wickedly, "You're going to make such a scene when it arrives by owl."
"Are you crazy?!" Hermione interrupted, "Toss it outside!"
The following potions lesson he didn't speak nor even acknowledge Harriet's existence at all.
"Slytherin? Wasn't that the house that bitc—I mean, Draco Malfoy just sorted into?" Harriet thought.
"That was the picture they sent as a birth announcement. That is you, Miss Potter."
Hermione laughed, "It is, isn't it."
Some cooling solution was rubbed on her face with a soft cloth. Harriet felt better immediately and sighed in relief.
Pansy grinned, "Thanks. And you really should tell her you know. She's pretty stupid. You won't get through to her otherwise."
Lavender nodded, "Mental, I know. But Jimmy Lewis is reliable. He wouldn't be taking the piss with this."
Albus sighed, but Nicolas knew his student too well. He was definitely one fly too big to be trapped in his web.
"I'm glad you and Hermione were okay. I'm sorry if I scared you."
"Protective barrier? Did I?"
"I don't care if it's family! In fact I particularly care about if it's family! You should know full well how I feel about family that treats their members badly!"
Lavender continued, "Next is the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore."
Harriet hummed in thought. That might be worth it. But no. "No thanks. Maybe I could get it delivered to McGonagall's office or something."
however appear quite frequently in muggle fiction."
Draco asked, "What's quicksand?"
Draco looked up at her again and shouted, "It was nothing!"
Harriet looked a little surprised at how knowledgeable she was, "Uh...yeah. My mother's sister."
"No! The Ravenclaw? I wouldn't think she would have it in her."
Draco tilted her head, "Why ever not? He'd be thrilled! All our problems would be solved."
It seemed to throw the man off because the following class, he only sniped at her once, and didn't even take points off. He just spun away and didn't look at Harriet's bemused and pained face for the rest of the class.
"Piss off, Malfoy."
"You're joking." Draco laughed and then after a beat, groaned painfully, "Oh, Merlin, you're not even joking. You're completely serious," and she dramatically groaned again. Draco had been doing quite a bit of groaning, "And I thought being away from the manor and off to school would be boring. Harry, you can add whatever this ridiculousness is to your magical repertoire. Not powerful, my arse!"
Harry grabbed Draco's hands, holding them firmly, releasing the tight hold on her blankets. It made the heat that was crawling up her neck from anger, move to her cheeks and ears instead, "Draco. The Dursleys beat and starved me and acted the way they did because 'they thought it was best.' Dumbledore is doing 'what he thinks is the right thing to do.' Your dad might think he's doing the right thing, but that doesn't
"This?"
Draco bristled, as she felt quite offended on Harry's behalf, "She's not dumb! When she chooses to be she's quite brilliant! Harry's just singularly focused!"
Parvati was the next one to start laughing, then Lavender. The other two Slytherins joined in and Hermione started laughing too. Harriet couldn't help turning her mouth upward. The relief of not being squished to death by a mountain troll, the wide grin on Malfoy's face and wood chips in her definitely less than perfect hair, the absolute absurdity of practically everything. She laughed loud and hard, her sides hurting from the effort. Everyone was laughing and shaking, pausing only to cough from the dust.
Nicolas stepped forward, and peered. It was much the same as the last he had encountered the mirror. Perenelle was by his side, smiling beautifully, and gave his mirror image a squeeze to his hand. Even he admitted that he was simple man in these regards.
Harriet laughed, putting her arms up to block the pillow in half hearted defense, "I dunno. I think you might embarrass me in front of him."
The whispers of the students dulled as the hat was placed on her head and fell over Harriet's eyes and ears.
Parvati led Harriet up a flight of stairs, and then up a second and third flight, which surprised her as from the outside, their apartment looked like it only had two floors.
Harriet continued, "My dad was also a Quidditch player: a Chaser." Harriet remebered the pictures she had stared at many many times, practically looking at them nightly, and felt a little bit stupid not to have known more about flying. She just never quite made the connection. She had figured the brooms were supposed to hit something, maybe, not fly on. The magical world was odd enough.
Until, she was hit in the back and toppled off her broom. Harry and Draco tumbled and landed more or less intact, laughing,  thankfully from not too high off the ground.
Malfoy spun to look at Harriet, looking shocked, and horrified, and...and with pity.
reliable, and it fits if You-Know-Who is around and weakened. It would also explain the odd round-about attacks Harriet has encountered. You-Know-Who's presence is obviously tied to her scar pain. She said it's never bothered her before coming to Hogwarts, though theoretically it could just be that she is reacting to all the ambient magic. But You-Know-Who is most likely hiding somewhere around Hogwarts."
A series of nods were answer enough, and Harriet grumbled, "Now I'm doubly chuffed I won that game." She turned to Draco and exclaimed, "You have to replace him as seeker next year. You're a good enough flyer. You could do it."
Most of the girls, sans Harriet and Parvati gasped. Draco asked, "Muggles have a form of imperious?! Mind control?!"
"You mean the author of 'Hogwarts: A History' and 'History of Magic?'
"Draco. Draco!"
"But she's not even your religion! She's part pagan too!" Draco retorted. Wait, what?
Draco sneered, "To what end?"
Fuck.
Draco huffed and gave her best dignified look, "Of course not."
Hermione looked momentarily confused until she came to some sort of realization, "Oh, I'm not talking about magic. I suppose I didn't tell you or Pansy or Milly yet. I'm transgender. That means I'm a girl who was born with a penis. This has nothing to do with magic."
Milly then answered, "One of the boys my mother tried to encourage a connection with, I silenced. He only said mean things, so I cursed him so he completely lost his voice." Milly was so shy. Harriet wondered if part of that was just pure personality, and whether part of that was what sounded like being forced to be around shitty people.
"Hey, Peeves. I need your help with a prank."
"How would you know! You don't know me!" Malfoy shouted back.
Parvati pondered calmly, she didn't seem particularly ruffled by any of the proceedings, "Aren't Slytherin dorms in the dungeons?"
Draco's father sneered in disbelief and offense, "What?!"
And so they did after another filling meal that Harriet had to insist again, that it was fine that there was no meat, and no she didn't miss a turkey roast, really, don't go out of your way, you don't need to pick one up for dinner, promise.
Draco, now fully awake, just looked at her funny. Harry just had the strangest set of priorities at all times. She would likely never truly comprehend how her brain worked, even if she spent a thousand years with the girl. She just had the strangest fixations. "Not to say that it isn't significant that Dumbledore is manipulating the Flamels, but really, Harry. You don't know what an honor it is to receive any sort of acknowledgement."
Hermione said, "You may not believe me, but I get it. I wasn't always brave. But there came a point in my life where I had to decide to face my fears and live a genuine life, the life I want and I know is best for me and without regrets, or whether I spend the rest of my life in fear, safer but always desiring a different way.
Lavender added again in her loud whisper, "I heard that they were friends when they were kids. Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Grindelwald was particularly fit and Dumbledore had quite the fancy for him."
Either way, as Draco sat in the Slytherin common room, and gazed at one of the fireplaces, she continued to twirl her hair, lost in thought.
Lavender burst into the room followed by Hermione and much more sedate Parvati.
Thought One: Slytherin was founded on the premise of building a safe place for traumatized children.
Hermione huffed, "I'm still letting it be known that I think the wiser thing to do would be to just ignore her."
"I'm not a bully!"
Bang!
Lavender nodded, "One of those my brother told me about, the dark, broody one, Professor Snape. He teaches potions and is the head of Slytherin and favors them. He couldn't be more obvious. Did you piss in his tea or something?"
The evidence was tenuous, as some of it was based on Harry's translations of Jiaolong, and perhaps it was all just a mistranslation. But Jiaolong referred to her time spent with the Dark Lord as a student in the past tense, but as she described him, it was entirely in the present. She feared him, and still feared him, as if he wasn't gone.
And then he dumped the lot right on Malfoy's head.
Harriet shrugged, "A bully is a bully."
glad you're here, Harriet. And I support you in whatever way you need." Hermione nodded firmly and then turned without giving her the chance to respond.
Pomfrey took another couple swipes around her eyes and face and said, "You can open them, dear. Can you tell me how much pain you are in now, scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain imaginable."
Nicolas hummed vaguely impressed, but if Albus was trying to convince him his stone was safe, he wasn't doing a particularly good job. Still, this room was particularly impressive. He could sense each key individually had been cast with drive and purpose.
Father growled, "I do mind. I was enjoying spending time with my family and would rather not entertain the whims of whatever blood traitor wished to trample over my property and invade my privacy."
Professor Snape's voice rang out, "Miss Granger! Go wash your hair immediately," oh, good. Hermione didn't get much on her, "and Mr. Longbottom. Take Miss Potter to the infirmary immediately. As you certainly know the way by this point. Wear your gloves." Harriet could practically hear the sneer in his voice.
Parvati nodded, satisfied with the job, and handed the jar to Harriet, tilted forward, and closed her eyes in expectation. Harriet started to smear the wet mud-like substance with two fingers along her cheeks. Supposedly it cleared pores, exfoliated dead skin, but also helped balance chakras, and had mild radiance charms that soaked into the skin. Only mild because if one used it too much or too often, they'd glow like a lamppost.
"But Harry-"
Parvati rolled her eyes, "You do realize Draco Malfoy is actually ridiculously wealthy and has quite a bit of sway."
McGonagall pulled out the final album, the cloth one, "The other two are officially property of Gryffindor house, this is one of my personal albums."
"You saw nothing!" Draco's blush couldn't have gotten deeper and more pervasive, and yet it did.
Harriet nodded, a little worried. She didn't expect that sort of reaction, "Is there something wrong?"
Draco shook her head, "No! I mean, I am. Interested. Just a little. Only a little." Draco fought her damnable blush, though at least she got her voice under control, "But I can't imagine that happening! Harry hasn't shown even the slightest interest. She's obviously straight. Otherwise I would be interested. Only a little though."
"I can't!"
"No. I'd rather not. Not Slytherin."
"He's very important! A lot of people listen to him!"
Draco looked hopeful, "Really?" Then she caught herself and put on a more haughty expression, "Well. I am a catch. Who wouldn't want me?"
Snape was purposefully ignoring Harriet's existence and Harriet herself was puttering away at a potion meant to pour on fruit trees to give the fruit healing properties, and also turn it blue for some reason Harriet didn't know, but was sure Hermione did, when it happened. Harriet was busy stirring clockwise 11 times and was on the 8th rotation, when a small something flew in from somewhere and plopped into her cauldron.
I hope Snape didn't feel too OOC. But it wasn't hard for me to imagine that at the first opportunity to get drunk, he'd feel overwhelmed with seeing Harry for the first time. Plus Minerva's scotch is reliably good and strong.
"Uh-huh. Suuure. I believe you." Harriet grinned even wider.
seem to only wish for her friendship and attention after your rejection on the train," and she turned to Harriet, "and
Draco's jaw dropped open, and her face flushed again. That look, making Draco blush. Harriet felt so satisfied getting that look out of her.
"Just shows how utterly brainless you are. You just can't handle my level of wit and charm," Malfoy put her hand under her chin and her nose in the air. Such a pompous princess.
Peeves grabbed the bucket out of Harriet's hands and flew off singing, "Potty and the Princess sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!"
"I think you might be right, Nicolas. Or at the very least I very much hope you are."
Mother spoke up, "I was just about to serve afternoon tea for myself and the girls. Would either of you wish to join us?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The End.
"Well I would have sprung for something to fix your face, but alas, there haven't been any magical products to help your level of ugly permanently."
Hermione looked a touch embarrassed, "Oh, I'm sorry! I obviously read that wrong. I thought you were interested in her romantically."
"Terence Higgs," Milly blushed and smiled shyly, "If it helps, it was such a good curse, he had to be admitted to St. Mungos."
Thanks again to the amazing Anra7777 for reading all my stuff!
After spending a week babysitting Parvati's younger cousins, running around the rooftop garden, and reading through a number of Parvati's book collection, she was sent back to Hogwarts with a picture of the twins and Harriet all smiling and waving in the beautiful saris, all in a lovely frame. Harriet decided to owl order some more picture frames for the photos she had received from McGonagall, so she could display them better along with her new momento.
"N-no!! God no!" Gross! Disgusting! Malfoy?! Who could ever like her, much less
"Oh, I did, didn't I. Hmm…" and Lavender proceeded to launch into a thrilling story about the siblings managing to get passage on a steamboat heading north by Reed glamouring himself as white man passing as Ruth's owner, peddling her fortune telling skills. They laughed at some of the more humorous fortunes Ruth gave to customers and went silent in expectation as they heard about when the two literally had to jump ship as the magical authority got wind of Ruth's accurate predictions.
There was a beat of thought, everyone knowing this was an important moment. Harriet held her breath.
Harriet grinned widely, "If we find them, we'll let them know."
She opened to a picture of a wedding. His mother and father were smiling widely at each other. There were her grandparents on both sides, both magical and muggle. All were smartly dressed, her grandmother was the only one not in English style formal wear. But she couldn't take her eyes off her mother. She was beautiful in a flowy sort of white dress and smiling as bright as the sun. There were a number of other people on both sides smiling and laughing. There was even that boy with facial scars being playfully teased by a man with black hair. Harriet spotted a much younger Professor McGonagall wearing a small smile.
Hermione looked a bit amused, "No, it's entirely fictional...well sort of? There are such practices as indoctrination and brainwashing, but none of them are immediate, taking weeks and months and often years of shaping the environment of a person, then using various psychological tactics to exert pressure," Hermione explained waving a hand almost distractedly. Harriet wondered how she managed to have such a good memory for any of this in the first place. "I promise, the likelihood of any of you encountering such things are extremely unlikely, and to be honest, I'm sure the magical world is just as susceptible to such things as it is more a manifestation of enforcement of power dynamics. It's entirely manipulation and control, which is not exclusive behavior to the muggle world… but we're getting off topic. I really would love to hear your perspectives on the war. What sort of choices your families made."
Just if anything I've learned from covid, fear is a real inspiration suck.
Pansy and Lavender both grinned at each other conspiratorially. Lavender said, "Well if it's information you need."
Albus hummed in thought, and skipped over the disappearing step on the stairs. Nicolas himself also avoided it. He had learned that mistake about three centuries back.
Parvati sent the club out into the hall, and the troll stumbled after it. Hermione rushed forward, closed and locked the door behind it with a loud satisfying click.
"Not shocking."
"Ugh! He was purposefully intimidating!" Draco ranted, arms flailing and then spinning into a high pitched mock voice, "Ohhh! I can do wandless wordless magic! Let me pull up your chairs! Want some unsanitary sweets that might be poisoned with any manner of dangerous potions? Let me just wandlessly shove them in your face!"
"They don't answer to Dumbledore."
"No. I'm good," Harriet shook her head, and figured she should add politely, "Thank you very much for having me."
"She's an exception. You know that," Draco snapped.
Harriet looked up at a friendly faced short woman who seemed a down-to-earth type and Harriet had a hard time imagining her with an arrest warrant.
Pansy rolled her eyes, "I'm not going to ask how you know what sort of things you need to know for N.E.W.T.s as a first year."
"Better than to have the only redeeming feature be an ugly scar."
Well at least she had accomplished her goal of getting Peeves to do her dirty work. Harriet moved quickly back to the Great Hall in hopes of catching the action, purposefully suppressing all thought of the disgusting concept of actually feeling affection for Draco effing Malfoy. Horrible. She swore she would never think of such a thing ever again. Ugh. Her?? Gross. Liking her of all people. No. She would never even imagine it again. Ugh! HER! Terrible.
Draco's father raised an eyebrow, "Two birds, one stone?"
Thanks to my fabulous beta Anra7777! This would be a very different fic without her.
"Harry! Oh, god. I'm glad you're okay! You look okay. You're okay, right?"
"Turmeric is closer and can certainly be used as a dye, but she's platinum blond and that would just give her a deeper gold. Hardly embarrassing." Hermione reached into the trunk herself and pulled out a jar of pickled beets.
Girls talk about their feelings too much and all this abuse had to get sorted out first. Ugh.
Harriet rolled her eyes with a sigh, "Oh, don't be that way. I do want to try Yule, but I know next to nothing about India or its culture. Next year, show me a proper Yule, okay?"
"Yup."
"Nothing that wouldn't be permanent, and as much as this is completely childish and the smart thing to do would be to just ignore her and all this would probably only further deepen animosity, I do understand you wanting to get back at Malfoy. I still refuse to do anything permanent."
Malfoy snapped her head around, "That was
Harriet scoffed.
Draco groaned at the ridiculous savage, "Merlin, get over yourself. You're famous. There's good reason for it. Now, are you going to meet him or not?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harriet was breathing rapidly, in anger and frustration and shouting and everything. It took her half a minute to take in all the occupants expressions of shocked horror. Harriet sucked in a breath, all the rage morphing into fear. Oh god. She shouldn't have said all that.
Harry rolled her eyes, "Yeah. Whatever you say. Off scowling at all his big important mysterious business."
"Ah," was all Snape could let out.
Oh yes, she was supposed to be coming up with negatives. But seriously! Who gave her the right to be adorable! Ugh! With her bright green eyes, that were constantly expressive and gave away every shred of Harry's feelings. Her golden skin and dark freckles and she was witty and sarcastic and funny and...Arg!!
Smooth dark hair done in an elaborate plait, deep emerald cloth that made her eyes seem to shine brighter, and gold everywhere, in the cloth and in her hair and on her wrists.
"Pictures of my parents and grandparents. I heard they were also in Gryffindor."
Parvati held her hand tenderly, "I didn't know you had muggle relatives. You didn't seem to know much muggle culture."
"You knew my father?"
Parvati waved her hand, "Well, if the curse holds, he'll be gone within the year."
I wanted this fic to be funny and light-hearted!! Why can't I write something funny and light-hearted?!
Happy New Year! I hope you all have a much greater 2021 than 2020!
Peeves grinned even wider, leaping at the chance to make yet another person miserable, "You can't ignore her. She's all you think about. You write HP+DM in hearts over your parchment. You brew love potions to slip in her fancy tea. I won't tell."
the Dark Lord! Harry's eleven! She can't face him! We can't face him! We're children!"
Draco snorted, knowing exactly what Hermione meant, but answered her question first, as it would be impolite to not get through pleasantries before tackling her goal for the study session, "Fresh has the natural oils that get removed during the drying process, though dried is more potent in botanicals." Hermione nodded and started scratching at her parchment in earnest.
Harriet thought she imagined it for a second, and stared into the orange tinged potion before Boom! Harriet winced at the noise and closed her eyes and put her hands up which was fortunate as she immediately felt wet and sticky and then half a second later her face and hands burned. The potion must have exploded and caught Harriet all over. She was at least grateful she closed her eyes in time. This stuff didn't feel awesome.
At this Albus did frown, much more visibly.
His student frowned just slightly before beaming once more, but they both knew the damage had been done. "Well I have one that hasn't been breaking into my personal library."
Harry groaned in frustration, eyes fluctuating between looking at the ceiling and glaring at Draco. Her eyes practically peeling away her defenses, "You're so full of shite. How the fuck are you a fucked up heir?"
Nicolas raised an eyebrow, patiently waiting for Albus to brag to him further. He didn't wait long.
Draco groaned. It was too early and she couldn't think what that specky bad haired beast could possibly want. From a quick glance the sun wasn't up yet, but it was still threatening sunrise. Still too early.
Harry took the bait and was happy to turn the conversation to the Gryffindor quidditch team and they continued a back and forth about their chances on taking the cup for that year, much to the great relief of Draco and her mother.
Hermione had started to bite at her thumb again, "I would usually write off such a ridiculous rumor, but Jimmy Lewis
Nicolas laughed good heartedly. She was showing signs that she would likely be in line as a new apprentice of his, if his wife didn't snap her up first. Nicolas sighed internally. He would likely have to concede to Perenelle and let her have the bright and firery Ji-hyun. Happy wife, happy life.
Harriet nodded, "Seriously. I'd rather he not have even more control over my life. None of it can be good."
Harriet sputtered, at a complete loss for what to do. Thankfully Parvati and Lavender seemed up on the correct course of action and bowed to each of the Slytherin girls without a word. Hermione and Harriet followed suit, Harriet a bit awkward and feeling decidedly off kilter about the whole thing.
Albus chuckled, "Again. You know me too well, old friend."
Nevertheless back on topic, Thought Three: the Dark Lord is not dead. There were always rumors that he would return, but Draco thought they were just the bitter musing of people who didn't fare so well after the end of the war and needed to desperately hold on to the hope of their aims coming to fruition. Or else perhaps of exasperated mothers in need of a lie to keep their kids in line. Eat your vegetables or the Dark Lord will get you. Don't fuss in public, or You-Know-Who will take you away. Don't be uncouth, or the Dark Lord will think you're a muggle.
Thank you for the kudos! It makes me feel A. MAZING.
The troll turned at the sound, and Harriet threw her other shoe, which also didn't do much, bouncing off the giant ashy head. The troll just looked at her as if she was a curiosity and then took a step forward, lifting a thick arm to grab her.
Harriet asked, "For Slytherin?"
They were also saved from any more awkward embarrassment, when the door to the bathroom unlocked from the outside and Professor Snape opened the door.
As she left the room from a door on the right side, Harriet looked around, taking in the space. There was McGonagall's desk carved with lion's feet, and a wing back in red velvet. A glass cabinet in the corner had a number of bottles inside with cut crystal glasses. The bookshelves lining the walls were oak with books of varying thickness and age held up by metal bookends decorated with acorn motifs. Movement on the bookshelves caught her eye and she approached what appeared to be a chessboard with pieces in white marble and obsidian. The pieces moved and appeared to be taunting each other, and a white pawn made an obscene gesture to the black pieces on the board, though when the chess set caught Harriet's eye, they straightened up, settling into the stances of perfect tiny soldiers.
Albus smiled a little ruefully, "There is nothing I can do to convince you to keep your distance, can I?"
As her father closed the wooden door to the study with an intimidating click, he spun around, "You, Draco, are a disappointment."
Draco groaned long and painfully, and flung her arms out in exasperation, "Exactly! Hasn't that been Dumbledore's intention the entire time! Why would he send you to those shitty muggles and then keep you there?! Why would he try to intimidate you and control you?! He wants you to feel powerless! Either to keep you down or to control you."
Draco scoffed, "Meddling bastard."
Harry, it seemed, had no sense of shame nor decorum and asked, "Hey. Are you related to the Wesley family?"
Weasley gasped, "Good lord, you're right! It's Harry Potter! What are you doing here?"
Harry growled, "What problems? Your dad is the one with the problem. I don't like him, Draco. I'm not going and you're not going if he knows."
Harriet covered her mouth, "Oh god. It's like a dead whale and a bag of sick had a baby."
Hermione hissed harshly, "Of course I'm scared! But I'm not going to let that stop me from doing what needs to be done!"
"Sorry dear. I should have given you a pain solution first."
The Dark Lord wasn't dead.
Parvati nodded, "Supposedly, he's the only one You-Know-You feared. The only one he couldn't beat. Well, other than…" Parvati looked particularly at Harriet and her fringe covered forehead.
Hermione continued calmly, "And bravery isn't the absence of fear, it's the willingness to do what needs to be done, despite your fear."
The Gryffindors all looked a little shocked at this though it seemed it was already known by the Slytherins. Milly seemed to sense only surprise and no revulsion or disgust, so she continued.
Parvati asked, "I'm sorry, Milly. He must have been pretty awful. May I ask who?"
"Are there
After smacking each other around with pillows and having to call Dobby to repair them, a few of them had split and caused feathers to spill across the room, Harry admitted that there was one adult she trusted a bit: The Patil matriarch. It seemed "Dadi" had made an impression over the visit during Yule, and Draco was determined that the Malfoy family could also during their visit. So she decided to continue encouraging tea times with Mother, and taking Harry's lead on what she wished to share. As much as she wished to bring some adults into all the issues with the Dark Lord, Draco was going to play the long game. It wouldn't do to break Harry's trust in any way.
They continued to talk about various rumors surrounding the third floor corridor, including the validity of there being a dragon, a pool of lava, the troll they encountered at Halloween, and a dementor, which was a creature that had to be explained to Harriet.
"Seriously. I'm brand new to all of this. And I'd really like to learn. You can have me for Yule next year, and teach me all about my grandfather, but I really want to learn about my grandmother, too."
Once they all settled into bed Lavender called out, "Goodnight! See you in the morning!"
like her. She was arrogant and mean and had the most sour expression marring a pretty face. She could go to hell for all she cared.
however I also thought that your and Harriet's escalating animosity is stupid and petty especially since,
"He must have been truly angry to punish a Slytherin, much less her, much less his goddaughter," Parvati explained.
"Maybe I should give her some more hair potion so she wouldn't be worried about going without. She has probably worried about going without for so long. Merlin knows it took forever for the beast to actually gain some weight. Who knew proper nutrition would be good for a person."
Harriet had to ask, "What's devil's snare?"
"Are you going to get a new broom?" Lavender asked, as Hermione precisely placed the mud across the bridge of her freckled nose.
Next up: Fun times at Malfoy Manor!
Odd, but Harriet shrugged mentally. She would ask about it later.
It seemed Harriet was lost pondering the enigma that was Professor Snape long enough that dinner had appeared beside her bedside table. She chewed the turkey sandwich blankly before she heard some familiar voices and Madam Pomfrey saying, "She's in the back, but don't get her over-excited. She is still healing."
"Whatever you say, princess."
She patted Draco's cheek fondly, "Now. Go show me what a lovely host you've grown to be."
Harry snorted, "Well, just a little less recently. Only a little. You still manage to find the most pretentious way of describing pretty much anything."
Draco sniffed with a little pride.
Weasley smiled, "Good, good." He looked at Draco again, curious and mildly concerned.
Harriet looked up as well. Professor Dumbledore seemed to be laughing lightly in some conversation with Professor McGonagall. The Dursleys always had nasty things to say about homosexuals, as they did about a great many things. Harriet was a little pleased to note that his relatives were nearly always wrong.
They laid on her bed panting and staring at the ceiling of elaborately carved crown molding, custom made with curving dragons in each of the corners, trying valiantly to catch their breath.
repeating over and over again in her head.
"Well...he's obviously weakened, but it's the simplest explanation for all of the mysteries currently surrounding everything. He's weak enough he can't attack directly so he curses brooms and sends trolls wandering into the school."
Harriet grinned widely, genuinely happy thinking about a week to explore what Draco's life was like, "Deal."
Eleven may have been young to properly use such derogatory hand gestures, but if she couldn't have parents, why not take advantage of it.
Hermione looked at her quizzically, "Isn't that exactly what we're talking about?"
Harry was back to giving her that piecing green glare, "Cause he obviously pissed you off yesterday. What did your dad do?"
"A simple finite incantatem works."
Lavender looked up discreetly, watching carefully for a minute or two, "Which one?"
Harriet looked pleased, "See? They do worry about it quite a lot."
There was the sound of fighting, and spells being cast. The girls all nervously held the barricade in place, among the noise of the Troll roaring and spells bouncing off the walls. It felt like forever until they heard and felt a massive thud that practically shook the floor and Flitwick's voice squeaked, "Well, that takes care of that." Slowly the girls released the barricade spell, all seven of them breathing hard, either from the effort of holding the spell in place, or just the adrenaline.
Harriet sniggered at Draco's blush that flared across her nose. Draco's embarrassing childhood fixation was still pretty funny, though it definitely answered how she knew so much. Maybe she could learn more about her grandfather's side through her, like she was learning about her grandmother's side through Parvati.
Then, it clicked. Maybe it was her mentioning the trolls that did it and the immediate reaction to the fear it brought, but Draco's finger halted in mid-air, half curled around a lock of hair. It was one thing that Draco had mused that the Dark Lord was still alive in some form or fashion, all pleasantly theoretical, a fascinating puzzle. But the very real threat she encountered with the troll, pulled this all out of the theoretical and into the very real, very present danger. This wasn't a mysterious broom malfunction and some migraines, this was the Dark Lord actually at Hogwarts! With Hermione also stating it as a real possibility and the source of the mysteries surrounding Harry, fear flooded her veins. "Y-you're serious? You think the Dark Lord is the source of everything?"
Harriet rolled her eyes, "Oh, of course, you would. You wouldn't be the one getting penalties awarded against you."
"Next to her is Professor Sinistra. She teaches Astronomy and comes from a family that makes wine in Italy, though just between you and me, I've heard they have ties with the mob.
"B-but!"
Once Harriet had properly cleaned herself up, McGonagall handed her the stack of photos, "These are copies for you to keep."
Hermione noted, "And the song wasn't too damning," she gave Harriet a glance, "well maybe someone could place it was you. I don't know if anyone else who could be accused of being an admirer wishing to 'pull Malfoy's pigtails.'"
Hermione huffed again, but with a bit less bite, almost sympathetic, "First. Harriet was nearly a Slytherin."
Don't you be insulting seers around Lavender.
Draco looked taken aback. Of course Hermione didn't care that she could be tortured and killed by the actual, not fictional boogieman. She paused for a moment and then put her face in her hands and mumbled into them, "Bloody Gryffindors."
Draco scoffed, "That's just standard Malfoy greeting."
"Rainbow scarabs," Hermione interjected.
Draco's eyes got wide. People like Hermione? Witches? She thought muggles weren't violent against magical types as Hermione had been coming to their defense all this time. She hissed in a fierce whisper, "I thought you said they stopped witch hunting?! I thought you said muggles were safe? That Harry's relatives weren't the norm in their prejudice against magic!"
"Hermione? Everything okay?"
Hermione scoffed, "I'm the last to judge someone for being bent."
"Yeah. McGonagall gave me a catalog. Could I get your help choosing one? I can't make heads or tails of them."
"Ah…"
"No joke. Hayworth is such a sleeze. So anyway, somehow Jimmy Lewis got involved in the fight as well cause those three always manage to go together. It's rather cute actually. Monica, Darcy, and Jimmy. Anyway, and all four of them got detention."
They were interrupted by Madam Pierce looming over the two of them and giving a cough with the nastiest look Draco could ever expect someone to give. They both fell silent and then mumbled a quiet, "Sorry, Madam Pierce…"
Not that Harry herself exactly lived up to the hype...well sort of. She was innately ridiculously powerful. It practically oozed out of her tiny frame. People can't help but be drawn to her. She didn't have any real control of her magical core, but if she ever learned, she'd be absolutely fearsome.
Harriet just felt confused, not by Draco Malfoy being the culprit, but why wouldn't she be punished? She swallowed her bite of sandwich and said, "Uh. Okay."
When Pomfrey's voice returned, she set the bottles to the side and said, "You may return to class, Mr. Longbottom. Thank you for your help."
"Draco! Wake up!" said specky bad haired beast hissed in a loud whisper. Though to be fair, Draco felt that any sort of sound was too loud for the moment. She buried her face further into her pillow.
Harriet just grinned and said, "You should probably take care of that," and demonstrated by wiping her own face the line of drool still stuck on Draco's.
Draco frowned and murmured, "I suppose she counts."
Parvati said, "A powerful dark wizard before You-Know-You's time. Kind of took his style from him if I'm honest. He wanted to break the Statute of Secrecy and have wizards rule over the muggles. Magical rule and what not. Really he just wanted power for himself and killed anyone in his way."
Father looked vaguely nauseated, disgusted. But he grumbled, "Yes. I think you might be correct, Narcissa."
Draco sneered, "That's disgusting!"
Muggles. Who knew?
