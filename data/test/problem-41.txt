It was worth a try. That kid didn’t look like it was about to listen to anything. Harry couldn’t help but be bothered by the idea that it was really some version of Lucius walking around in that little body. Instead of inching away, as it had been. It took a step closer.
If blinking could be a form of stuttering, Sirius stood there, mute and afflicted. He wasn’t sure if he’d been insulted or not, and the look on his face leaned towards suspicion.
He took in the slope of the hill. So very steep. Only someone comfortable with living between worlds, could ever make a home here. That’s when he noticed the dragon. It was no longer swollen to epic proportions, but was still a pretty damn good-sized creature. It perched lazily on the slope, wings folded and tail making occasional snake-like twitches on its own. Blue-green scales glistened iridescently, like oil slicks. The memory of looking at it in terror, accelerated his recall. That’s when he noticed the little hut that wasn’t there before. The top of it peaked above the hill line, behind the dragon. He stood. It was definitely a hut. A home. Something told him that was important because it simply appeared. Like an award. Maybe they were doing better than he thought.
When Foster's bones were dry and resembled nothing more than brittle charcoal disintegrating onto the boy's chest, Ash freed himself from his shock enough to rush forward. When he did, calling Foster's name, the wizard looked up at him. Something behind his inscrutable gaze intensified. Ash followed it behind him, expecting his grandfather to have returned. But behind him, lying outstretched on the floor, still on his back from where he fell, wasn't his grandfather. It was his own body lying there, unaffected by the fact that he was looking down at it.
“My assistant… Mr. Strieber, is clairvoyant. There is indeed a child spirit around your son, but he’s the one keeping it there. And not just the child, but an entire committee of judges dictating his every move. Gods, if you will. Guides. Ancestors. His version of the forces that govern his life. All of us have them. They’re just our strongest beliefs, personified. They look like people, but they control his happiness. They control his entire world.”
“But if she has anymore trouble, contact me right away. Her magic seems to be behaving itself for now. It’ll take at least a week of medication before she’s at levels that suppress it effectively enough. If she does well for a month, we’ll pull back gradually. The bracelet’s been scanned for its magical properties, but we’re still analyzing it. I’ve got her prescription worked out for a trial period, and that will keep the severest episodes away, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do about her body at the moment. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. Keep an eye on her, make any notes of interest and report concerns to me, but other than that, she can rest and recover at home as long as her magic is no longer spontaneously active. I’m going to pop in on her and scan her myself over the next few weeks. You guys can schedule that with the nurse.”
With blushing hesitation, she turned her palms up and said agreeably, “An estrogen barrier. Or as they call it, ‘the ring.’ It contains hormones that prevent fertilization. If a woman’s body isn’t able to breakdown the chemicals fast enough, her body tries to expel it through her skin. The bumps are so tiny, they can hardly be seen. Micro bumps. But you can feel them.”
He liked the sound of that. Just then, another picture fell from between the envelopes he held. This one was the oldest version of Eileen than all the others. She’d actually grown up to be a nice looking woman. More handsome than pretty, due to the serious way she stared the camera down. But it looked like she’d mellowed since her early teens. She couldn’t have been more than twenty. The astonishing thing was, she held a baby, looking months old. Old enough to sit up, but definitely not walking. The child’s rounded, drool-wet lips made him smile a little, reminding him of when Iece was that small.  These photos seemed to impart some light magic, making him feel more attached to them than he had a right to feel. This wasn’t his family, after all. That remained to be proven. But he kind of felt proud of her, as if her kid was a big deal. She’d become a mother and done well, as if that path had been in doubt at some point. As if no one expected her to ever want to be that normal. What was making him think this?
“Okay. It’s okay, I won’t. We got through it the best way we could. I’m not blaming you or anything.”
“In spite of your lack of enthusiasm, are you still in favor of matrimony, with all that you’ve heard discussed so far, to my son, Harry James Potter?”
She drove that statement into him. It hit its mark. He got it. He had to see the curse for what it was. A war wound, not being denounced by the human race. Not having made such a terrible move, that life was never going to forgive him, or let up on him for being something so horrible that the average person could not fail to that extent. The average person could not get themselves cursed that badly.
Harry remembered his lessons with Thella. Love first. Use no other vehicle. Focus exclusively on what he wanted for seventeen seconds. Keep it simple, don’t ask for everything all at once. Back to her kitchen safely. Visions of Iece in Draco’s arms gave him the lift he needed. The image made him smile involuntarily, and that’s how he knew it had caused a genuine feeling, and wasn’t forced. When he opened his eyes, he was back in the brightness of Thella’s kitchen.
His eyes popped open. A woman, an animated, full-sized version of Elsa, from Frozen, stood in front of the flat screen. He saw through her, but somehow she was solid enough. Her skin lit with a projection-like quality, and her face appeared more cartoonish than artificial. Her white hair moved like a solid piece of plastic, though it emitted its own light. Her clothing were generic blocks of swirls without all the details from the movie. He really wanted to believe that he was dreaming, but as he watched her spectacle dance and twirl in front of the television, he had to admit that this wasn’t his dream at all. It was Iece’s.
“I’ve never seen love put out a real fire. That’s just something idealist’s harp about. It takes work, a fight and struggle, to get it done. I’ve gotta fight to get my daughter the help she needs.”
“I call this sweet red blend, ‘Troubles Don’t Last.’ Selected just for you. Traditional, with a hint of honey and clove.”
Draco corrected them. "Harry's magic is recovering. Snape said it's learning around the injury. Harry remembers only what Snape left him. He knows how it happened, he just doesn't have to keep having nightmares about it. The worst of it was removed."
"A stroke? That's highly unusual." Her tone said she wasn't buying it. She reached behind her, producing the newspaper photo.
“No. You make costumes for a living. You showed him your silver holographic dresses and Cosplay scrapbook, and he ordered a suit from you and invited you into his bedroom?”
Fine. He couldn’t deal with that just now, but fine. He found the experience draining him and was ready to be done with it. He wasn’t going to be fit for a lecture. “At least tell me this. Did Snape have anything to do with the train explosion?”
Hermione, Ron, and Blaise held back, categorizing the strange man as well as the awkwardness that suddenly chilled everyone. Their eyes were huge, but their lips were silent as they tried to work out the math unfolding before them.
When he got no response, he continued, “We’re family, Harry. Whatever has happened, please trust me like a father and tell me what on earth made you do that to Lucius?”
Harry thought he could’ve relied on the ward that would let a wand be taken from a guest or intruder in the house, but that wasn’t the way to instill trust.
Lucius answered. “It means, Mr. Potter, that you have left the world of man-made laws and a system of magic so bland that everyone is on the same skill level. This is a private world, made of private preferences. We bow to no law, except those we make up ourselves, as we go along. And little girls should not be running around in a place like this, if they value their safety.”
Ranker turned to everyone. “I apologize for this, but I must leave you and help my colleagues regain order. The disruption to power, is a magical one. Iece, is my first stop. I’ll answer your questions as soon as I can. I need someone to keep Harry here, sit with him, don’t leave him. We have a lounge on this floor if you don’t want to go to the lobby. Or better, can someone take him to the canteen? He’s going to need food behind the sedative I’ve given him, or his stomach will trouble him. Who can stay with him?”
The way Draco had taken charge, volunteering his father's business and private information to the Ministry, and turning over the entire Malfoy Collection, a treasury of dark objects the aurors had no knowledge of, he'd won himself consultant status within the Ministry and accepted the offer to intern within the Department of Dangerous Artifacts. Between Snape's and Draco's memories, all the indictments against them both were dropped.
Banks closed the door behind Harry and beckoned to a leather chair. Harry turned it down. “No thanks. I’m headed back out.”
Narcissa leaned forward from her chair. “What my husband means is, he hasn’t quite recovered. He’s still very angry with us. The wizard, Severus, has given him a potion. A sedative. If you do talk to him, choose something that doesn’t upset him. He wasn’t breathing when you two came back.”
"Pardon, Master Potter. I insisted on the amendment. It in no way implies my loyalty will be compromised. It's just that the members of the Potter-Malfoy family, are aligned to a volatile arc of magic. Your lines have joined against tradition, and therefore opens new blood-magic into this world. It may throw Jipsy off. It may throw both masters off. But Jipsy is here to tame it all the same. I outbid all others to serve the Potter-Malfoy House. I have bound myself to no other masters for this reason."
Another flash went off in their faces, along with the Minister's laughing assessment of their domestic dispute. Harry let his silence tell Draco that he was right. He wouldn't argue this time. It was only a matter of time before Iece had her face on the cover of some gossip rag. He couldn't fight it forever, but he could protect her childhood.
In nearly two years since school, Harry had gained ten pounds and Draco had lost exactly that much. The designer robes he wore at the Ministry, with precision cuts and fabrics that flattered him, hid the evidence of his stress. He hid what it took for him to manage the lives of three people, look out for his mother, maintain his family's finances, and make them all think that it came naturally to him. After work and a hot shower, in a T-shirt and jeans just expensive enough to shape his lean thighs, he counted on Harry not to comment on his physique. Just like he didn't complain about taking care of his sister.
Hermione was in her element. She was stirring mashed potatoes with an apron on and exclaiming that Mrs. Weasley would be there early to help with cooking. “If Iece has to grow up in this environment, you’re not helping her by being so uncomfortable around simple family. Show her, by example, that it’s okay to relax around all of us.”
He noticed that the young man refused to acknowledge him, refused to look up, until he spelled it out. Harry leaned forward, elbows on the table, and nodded like he was drowning out the sound of Black’s voice with music. They needed him to sign a consent, or film his decline to sign.
It was only one random weekend, and Harry confessed. But Draco has to keep seeing this Caribbean beauty ask Harry to dance every year, at the International Wizard Coalition. Will he shore up and profess his love, or will he watch this man waltz Harry right out of his life?
No. That wasn’t good enough. He’d have to take her away. Maybe hide her in the United States. That scenario steamed onto the screen of his mind as a myriad of hands jerked him into an upright position.
: Sorry, I said there'd be another chapter today, but that will have to wait. Thank you all for your kudos and positive comments.
“There was no release application approved for you. I checked. You were scheduled to await trial in Azkaban.” His complexion told Harry that he fully anticipated having to endure the other side of that fate.
People in dark suits surrounded him and appeared to wait on his recovery. Someone gave him water and helped him into a chair. By the time his head cleared and his stomach eased up, there were only four people in the room. Himself, the Admiral, and two guards stationed at the door. His wand lay on the table beside him.
Her mother pushed her hand down a little too harshly, and threatened to spank her if she continued. Remus turned his back to keep from distracting her, but his ears pricked up. She had a distinctive voice for a child so young, and he felt something about her. What he’d given up was never far from his mind, and when she’d gotten quiet, he risked another peak over his shoulder. He turned in time to see an outburst cut short by her mother’s slender fingers pinching her arm. Pink nails dug cruelly, just enough not to break the skin, and the lady held on. His wolf senses alarmed, and picked up her words, “Stop showing out! When I get you home, you’ll learn to shut it when I say so.”
“Yes, it’s still spelled to maintain itself and her happiness that day. It’s a work of art, the highest craftsmanship. Mistress cried when she saw it, and said that there was not another masterpiece in all of Europe, including the Louvre.”
But that didn't explain everything going on, if it explained anything. And Ash needed explanations desperately. Especially when he saw Foster use his wand tip to open an incision into the arm he held over the boy. Ash felt pressure build in the room. His ears popped as he steadied himself to his feet, reaching towards the table to stop Foster. They were separated by only a few feet, yet Ash felt he was reaching across an invisible field of air so dense, it was almost impenetrable. Objects could've stayed afloat in it, like fruit suspended in Jell-O. He didn't understand any of it.
Her eyes fell away from him. “Snake? They’re saying Snake, but I don’t think that’s right. People are surrounded by traces of all of their identities in the spirit world. We shed the names and costumes and are known by pure identity that needs no name. If you and I had no names, we would still be who we are. So names don’t translate well, and he’s interfering.”
Remus’ legs wanted to close, to choke off that much heat, that soon, but he can’t keep Sirius’ muzzle out of his crack. It’s a canine’s cold nose and eager chomp that sloshes past the grip of his ass cheeks. They tighten, and still the creature that Sirius has become, charges right through Remus’ defenses. Eager panting interspersed with the slap of wet smacks and loud licking, assault Remus’s ears. He can’t stop his body from rejecting it. And he can’t stop his body from letting it in.  He hated the way this disgusting, filthy, and barbaric act felt. He hated that Sirius’ need for it, shamed them both. It proved that he would never overcome the animal inside himself. It proved that he was an outcast for a reason.  He hated it for many reasons, but most of all, he hated it because he wanted it.
Warner Bros. owns all images from the Harry Potter movies. JK Rowling owns her characters and is a God, and I make no money from this.
I know life sucks with me, and you deserve better. You deserve someone who’s not angry all the time. Who doesn’t want to murder your father, but I’m not him and I still need you to be the bigger person and forgive all this damage inside of me. I don’t know how to be some ideal partner. Some amazing boyfriend, or even an okay flatmate. But I know that you’re important to me. And you’re so good. So good. You’re so much better than everyone gives you credit for. I don’t deserve you, but I can’t do this without you. Don’t let me push you away. Please.
Back out into the night, he tried to see the sky behind all the black cloud cover. No stars. No moon. No matter. Fireworks suddenly illuminated everything in sparks of red, gold, and green. Cheers went up and he saw that the lecture disturbance had not slowed the festival down one bit. Music spilled onto the streets from a distance. Festival goers were still wandering, eating sausages and sloshing beer from paper cups. Groups were thinner, but just as loud and appearing to grow more boisterous as the evening wore on. Obviously, children had been put to bed and grownups had the run of the place. Cannabis filled the air and Harry tried to steadied his nerves to apparate to Draco so soon after the portkey. He didn’t even know where Draco was.
“No. Your genealogy places your son’s magic in the same stock with pagan wizards of old. We require a demonstration of this grade of magic.”
He breathed easier, then launched into an explanation. “The woman in this photo wants me to come inside of it. She communicated to me through her embroidery. She’s deceased. For wizards, it’s nothing to see dead people up and about in pictures. At my old school, they could even talk from really skillful paintings. But she has something to tell me and needs me there. I thought, if you knew how your murals worked, you might be able to get me inside the photo. Actually, the woman in the picture suggested you by name. I think she read my mind.”
Harry glanced at Draco, who looked ill. His glare accused Harry of making things worse. He snatched his wand. “Nicee, it’s wonderful that you can do tricks, but it’s bedtime. I mean it. If you don’t put her away right now, you can never have ice cream ever again.”
I've done it again, only this time with Harry and Draco. The habits of reviewers are illustrated with photos and observational humor. While this version is similar to the Snape version, it has major Drarry differences that are unique to that pairing and an additional category. Definitions are basically the same, but relate to Harry and Draco specifically.
It was good to see that smile. It made Harry realize how rare it had become. He offered, "Since the tour's delayed, how 'bout I come home and spend the weekend with you guys?"
Their conversation meandered into politely catching up with the details of their lives, until she excused herself and let him into the antechamber. She gave him the incantation that would get him passed the wards any time he wanted. They stood a moment, looking up at Snape’s portrait together. It was larger than average and dominated the wall. In the room, amid all the deep greens and patterned burgundies accentuating 18th century parlor furniture, cabinets of undisclosed records and scrolls, as well as a small hearth, this could’ve been exactly the office of choice for the person staring back at them. He had it all to himself. The other paintings were of beloved staff members who had never approached the rank of Headmaster.
“Well, she’s started now, so I guess I can’t make it any worse. Do you want to show Uncle Ron what you can do?”
He snapped at her, “This is not supposed to be my life. I have plans. I’m not a fucking house wife.”
It did occur to Ash that Foster’s refusal to speak of himself, or his world, came from a valid need to protect it. But so what. Other non-magical people knew about it. If Foster didn’t trust him now, when would he? Ash had saved his life. Not that he wanted to hold it over Foster’s head, but dammit, he deserved some slack in their formalities. He deserved to be treated as a friend, not as the fuzz. He should have the right to address Foster as Snape. He couldn’t wait to see the look on his face when Ash used his real name. Why it thrilled him to have this little bit of power, he wasn’t sure. He could’ve respected Foster’s wishes and pretended not to know. But this would make Foster take him seriously. Foster, who’s indifference could be such a stunning blow of rejection, had all the power. It was high time Ash had some.
He thought of him, remembered him, and tried to look for an angle that would give him an advantage. Snape had already blown his cover when the truth came out that he cooperated with Dumbledore. So he did indeed have the liability of feelings. He had a weakness. People with feelings always want to be understood. Let’s see, what did he remember about Snape?
“I can’t be expected to listen to Sir Lilykins Strieber-Snape, without alcohol. The fairy godmother of bullshit.”
They played that way until their arms got tired. By then, Elsa had led Iece all through the apartment, from room to room on a chase. Draco was so tired, he practically hosed her down in the shower, threw pajamas on her, and tossed her into bed. Harry waited on the sofa for him, with a glass of wine. Draco had just taken it from him when Jipsy’s pop startled them.
As beer jostled in his stomach, he regretted not having a bite of food. They’d had to walk the last block and his legs didn’t feel so steady. The rundown neighborhood didn’t boost his lapsing confidence any. It wasn’t like the other parts of town, where the festival thrived amid Edinburgh’s proudest homes and markets. Here in the dark, amid crumbling pavement and a faint hint of sidewalk urine, shadowy houses progressed to decrepit buildings with boarded windows and trash strewn alleys. In his mind, Harry reasoned that a good time didn’t have to be had in such a disgraceful setting. Bureaucrats made it so, not people. Illegalizing one’s right to pleasure forced innocent people to risk dark, desperate places. It didn’t have to be so. Needing an intimate connection didn’t come with automatic disgrace. That was stamped upon it by laws and shame.
Tremors and logic told Draco that he should stop it. He should race to keep Harry from self-destruction, but he had no more belief that he could stop him, than he believed Iece’s problem to be random. She was suffering. And it was his father’s fault. Just not in the way that the doctor knew. And not in the way than anyone would ever know. His father deserved what Harry was going to do.
Now, as she watched Harry race by, she extended her magic to him. She couldn’t act for him, but whatever his intentions were, she could give him aide. She took out one of her hair pins. When James and his entourage ran by, she zapped the lot of them with a disorientation charm. By the time they got to the lawn, they’d be too confused about Harry’s direction. They would have to give up and come back, letting Harry solve this problem on his own.
It sounded too easy to Draco. “Okay, but not here. Let’s step outside. They should know something by the time we return.”
That was their eternal hide and seek. It was a great game, but they had to make it believable in order to stay committed to those lives. In some, they forgot who they were and really suffered. In some, they’d made mistakes and cried so hard that they trapped themselves in sorrow, and spent an eternity finding their way back out again. In some realities, they were still searching for one another. And in this one, Draco had disassociated so much from a happiness that he felt to be unrealistic, that he’d left his most valuable self behind.
He didn’t really expect Draco to come around this easily, but he expected himself to have as much patience as it took to convince him he was a friend, not a foe. His only job at this point, was to try to break the ice.
Ash palmed it and stood up. He knew where to go. He thanked the guy and headed for the stairs. Palms sweating, he decided to take the elevator instead. He felt how strong the drink had been when he had to hold himself up next to three other people who entered behind him. Amid strangers making out and stumbling against him, all the wrong buttons were pressed. It gave him an eyeful of what was going on, on the other levels. One of the floors appeared to be a rented party. Something that looked like a sixty year-old man sporting a coat of grey pubes, while chasing a young woman wearing only her underwear, ran across the open doors. Ash tried to keep his drink down and hurriedly pressed for the doors to close before anyone else could get on.
It wasn’t just that he wasn’t attracted to men. Not to men. Just to Harry. It’s just that he never dreamed this one could want him so much. Harry saved his life. Saved his family. If this was all he wanted, then Draco gripped him harder and willed him to take as much as he could.
“It’s not a mark against you. Just be aware that you cannot store undocumented human remains at Gringotts without alerting some inquiry. And it only confirmed for us that you were determined to hunt down answers, just as much as we were. All we had to do was follow you.”
Snape's patronis had led him to the Sword of Gryffindor, on the bottom of the lake. A patronis represented the very essence of his magic and his consciousness. Quickly, he cast a barrier around the jeep, in a diameter wide enough to give his patronis adequate room. Then he summoned it forth. His magic arched from his wand to just a few meters in front of the vehicle. He was careful not to use its full strength. He wanted to keep the stag barely visible against magical people and non-magic alike. If they saw a light or a flicker in the distance, that they couldn't understand, it would be gone in the next second, moving toward Harry's intention and away from prying eyes.
“Wrapped herself up in them, she did. She used the softest, most beautiful materials to soothe the most broken of hearts.”
There were only a few more hours of useful daylight left and it killed him to let this opportunity slip away. The thought of apparating to Ministry-sponsored lodgings in Edinburgh, then attempting to use the hidden facility for practice, just to brush up before meeting his team members, made him bristle. If he didn't sleep, he could end up behaving like a real tit in front of them. His judgement might suffer. On his broom, snap decisions were based on instinct and strategy, not careful reflection. He would not be forgiven if they found his skill unequal to the stories. He knew it was bullocks to worry about it, that no one could measure up to unrealistic stories. But he was still pretty good and he wanted them to see that he was good enough to fly with them. The famous Harry Potter missing their maiden practice would've been a serious strike against him, and fodder for nasty gossip, had it not been for the tragedy that affected others. Dead passengers were the proof that he hadn't been able to help his tardiness and wasn't behaving like an exceptioned Prima Donna on purpose.
“Um, which brings us to why I’m here. All this stuff is really cool, but I’m looking for something that will tie Snape to me personally. How are we related? Since you can’t talk about that, maybe I’ll find more clues in Ladoria’s trunks. I really don’t want to snoop, but I kind a have to snoop.
He grasped his talisman. He wanted useful information. How to get into Eileen’s photo? How was he and Snape related? How could he find the real Snape? He knew immediately that he was asking too many questions at once. His desire was stronger than his pacing.
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy.” They looked at him like the intruder into their family unit that he was. He didn’t let it stop him.
Harry suppressed his uneasiness and nodded. The door closed. Damn if he knew how to fix any of this. An early bloomer? That sent chills up his spine and he wasn’t a hundred percent sure what it meant. Without giving himself time to think, he scrambled off the bed, relieved his bladder in an adjoining toilet, and went looking for Draco and Iece.
He saw Snape’s expression darken, and quickly corrected the assumption. “No, not what you think. It took a male of her own kind to do it. Backaals don’t have one specific mate for life. Why would they, since they live virtually forever? She was only able to accomplish this because she replicated human DNA and wore a body. She had to mate with her own kind, which are inherently neither gender until they acquire a body. But in the past, the body was just cosmetics, not really needed in order for them to function. Once she got a taste of Harry’s magic, her cosmetic body began to function biologically. It could make and carry a child because that’s what she wanted the magic to do.
She compensated by adding her cast to each direction and felt a bit of hope when even the muggles down the street collapsed, frozen mid-run, as they tried to avoid whatever they had seen taking place on her lawn.
“Maybe you need a husband, or something like a third parent at least. One who’s got your back. Whatever caused you to not stand up for yourself, is exactly what makes it necessary for other people to think and act on your behalf. Then you blame them for making the wrong decision, when you’re the only one qualified to make it. Your parents are just waiting for you to be so sure of what you want, that they need not meddle in your business. They won’t be convinced until you make it clear to them that you won’t tolerate another decision about your life, made by them. That’s where I come in. I’m giving you the space to make your own decisions. But you’ve got to stop blaming other people for things you have perfect control over.”
That put a damper on his intentions, but it gave him time to down three beers faster than he could talk himself out of it. Greg and Jasper apparated in the parking lot where he agreed to meet them. All jeans, sporty nylon and leather jackets, and puffing like smoke stacks on gourmet cigarettes, they looked nothing like the professional quidditch players sponsored by an international agency of peace. They looked like young men on the hunt for trouble, and anyone who looked at them the wrong way was fair game.
“Oops,” James chuckled. “Look how tense they are. Is that fair to them? My son will only do this once, I want it to be a day he enjoys looking back on. If you marry into this family, you marry my sense of humor.”
More than likely, they were staring at the baby’s carrier. He attracted a lot more attention when he carried her. He might as well get used to it.
The linen was much lower than Harry thought he had a right to see, but his eyes kept coming back to it.  That demarcation, from the white shore of Draco’s creamy skin, to the beginnings of glistening private hairs that were as pale as those on his head, made him tighten his grip on maturity and how serious the matter was.
When the Weaseley’s were gone, he let Draco pull him from the stool and walked hypnotically behind him to the canteen. Every time his mind questioned what his daughter must be going through, Draco tugged on his hand and said, “Stop that. She’s fine. We’re going to hear from Rankar any minute now.”
“And I’ve given you mine. Do your parents know that there’s someone else, and you’re still willing to go through with it if you get to keep him?”
Their arms were twisted. But when it was all said and done, the idea of publicly celebrating his marriage, to people who hadn’t been tricked into staying for it, did appeal to Harry. At four months pregnancy, Draco was more self-conscious about his body than ever. They agreed he wouldn’t have to do public functions. One night with Harry’s entire family privileged to their lovemaking, was quite enough. They were both still recovering from that. They were learning to look people in their eyes again and not feel they were being discussed when they entered a room. There could’ve been a dozen reasons why people got silent and went red, then started talking about the weather.
“You see, all marriages into this family, must stand on the decrees within this document. I doubt someone could pass through this family’s door, who wasn’t a candidate to consent to this. Your son is fractured by all of his promises. He’s split himself to give others what they want, so he wasn’t looking when a part of himself accepted Harry’s terms. When he heals and becomes whole again, he will integrate his many broken shards. What we see now, is the beginning of that process, however disturbing it may seem.”
Harry was trying very hard to say the words 'thank you,' the way they were meant to be said. But the more he looked at his new wand and the replacement watch, the more he resented not having adequate answers. The watch called to him. It had been fastened to his wrist and spelled not to come off. The crash had been violent enough to disintegrate his clothes. His watch should've been melted into his skin. In his mind, a wall of flames rushed up to him.
“Oh, please. Don’t play innocent with me. Why would I open up my home to this man, bend over backwards to keep him happy, run his business, run his errands, and run myself into the ground without so much as a fucking thank you? Jealous? That’s not the half of it. I am flat out disgusted. I got arrested tonight because I made out with some man, because I can’t get anywhere near Foster. There. I spelled it out. Are you happy? Are you going to skip on over the ridge for your next date with the guy who won’t give me the time of day, even after I saved his life? ‘Cause if you are, I really hope you put in a good word for me.”
He had already lost himself a number of times and felt a little stunned that his body seemed to have reserves of endurance, when at any other time, he ran on anxiety and reached his physical limits earlier than he wanted. This was also new and he wondered if his and Harry’s magic were somehow evolving to compensate for the curse. To compensate for everything.
She'd told him. "Professor Snape's remaining family do not acknowledge him, so I have no qualms about giving you these." She shook the urn without touching it and used her wand to dump a small portion of its contents into an antique pill tin, which bore the image of a black peacock. Harry had smiled gratefully and thanked her.
It was true. The year after Iece was born, and his body appeared to be his again, he went crazy with it. He had done slutty things and behaved inappropriately. He’d found plenty of people willing to let him. He had stoked the fire of a damaged reputation, but he’d been running from something. He and Draco both had. They’d used pleasure to outrun what had been done to their shot psyches. Something was broken between them and sex with others was the only evidence either of them had that they still passed for human.
“No, sir. Sadly, I could only get a few of Mistress’s favorite rooms inside, but I used her library and bedroom for the colors and decorations. Every item you see, is either real or recalled from my time with her. Gringott’s wards automatically limit the amount of magic that I can use to create space.”
Instead, he backed out quietly and quickly. The after-image of water streaming down Harry’s face, stayed with him.
Once settled on the train, Harry did a quick visual of seeing himself making light-hearted conversation, swapping anecdotes, and generally holding his own against what his fame had done to public perception. That's how he prepared his mind for the public pace of the next two weeks. People seemed to think that just because they knew
He’d hold her and he’d even tell her why he had to do that. He’d point. He’d draw the image of Lucius from his mind and say to her, “That is a very bad wizard. You are never to trust him. You are never to speak to him. And he’s never to speak to you. You let Daddy know if he ever tries to talk to you.”
Collin choked. His eyes bulged as he suffocated. Snape waited for life to dim in his pupils before jerking a plug of blood from his windpipe and restoring the range of vertebrae responsible for his breathing.
Snape sneared. “You’re not that naive. No one trusted you, they acquired you as a bargaining asset, which has now paid off. And if you didn’t know, now you do, that they are not to be trusted. They didn’t fear Voldemort and there’s no reason for them to respect you.”
“You couldn’t give it to me in front of Harry? Sounds pretty sneaky to me. Just come out and ask me what you want to know. Banks and Arthur sent you, didn’t they? Even Harry wouldn’t like all this decoying and pressuring me behind his back. I know there’s going to be a trial and I don’t care. Let us have a few days of peace with him while we can. Go back and tell Banks that you couldn’t find out a damn thing, because you won’t.”
“She said bar, actually, that whole American thing. Well, they are. We made plans, but listen mate, if I can get you drinking in my room, that’s my first choice. Am I right?” His grin told Harry how delightfully funny he sounded to himself.
Harry noticed that Severus had a way of speaking that form fitted every word into place. His voice never wavered. It had a deep resonance that bent words to his meaning, but softly. He did not extend his hand, perhaps because everyone in the room knew that Lucius wouldn’t take it.
Morell looked out the door, wide-eyed. “There’s ten orderlies and three security guards on every floor. I don’t think I trust myself not to get us caught.”
He could see that the news had inspired her worst fears to come forward. Whatever she thought he was going to do, he had to reassure her that he wasn’t.
Harry made it a point to keep his daughter in his arms all morning. After almost two years, he still had a problem believing she was his. Her white hair against his black, never lost its contrasting shock when he looked at the two of them in the bathroom mirror. She slumped, head down on his shoulder, so that their heads touched as she breathed warmly against him in her sleep. Mouth open, her dimpled arms dangled over his in her onesy. She lay as if she trusted him completely, and that was always amazing to him. After all the darkness in his life, that something so bright, happy, and perfect-magic, could need him and automatically accept him without question, without hesitation, was balm to his soul. It was almost as if everything he'd lost, he'd gotten back a hundred times over in her outstretched hands that reached for him every morning. He never got tired of it. It fed him life. If he hadn't carried her in his body, if he hadn't seen her come out of him, he would never have believed she was his. If he'd had to go through hell so that she could be there, then so be it.
Harry waved to silence him. “I won’t play this game. Draco and I have already been on trial. So unless you have questions pertaining to the lecture, I’m done here.”
“Okay,” Draco gave in. “But I’m not ready to dance with every member of your family, so don’t leave my side all night.”
“Well give him our regards,” his neighbors answered collectively and pressed baskets filled with homemade dinners into his arms. “A man that hard at work, ‘ought not be disturbed then.”
She smoothed her hair, not satisfied till she felt the pins in their proper places. Her compressed lips indicated that she was indeed not telling all that she knew.
He ate in record time, just to get back upstairs. Once there, he had to wait outside the door with Narcissa, until the little creature signaled that Draco was decent.
“Severus...” Collin coughed on the clog in his throat. “You are a cruel bastard! That was the most insufferable thing I’ve ever felt. I could’ve died from disgust alone. You goddamn bastard.”
He thought her shoulders relaxed a bit, but he wasn't sure. "You and I both know that disaster follows Harry. It's like he's made for it. If I'm going to continue supporting him, being with him, I've got to make safer arrangements for her. Don't look at me like that. You don't know what it's like to make this decision. It's not like I'm leaving her on somebody's bloody doorstep."
They were off and running. Harry shouted for someone to look after Draco. Lucius pursued, leaving Narcissa to weigh the urge to follow or stay behind. She had to know what was going on, and insisted Draco would be fine in the chair. She went after them. Lily and Sirius looked at one another, at Petunia, then followed.
I personally don't glorify war. I'm using it as a prop, just like I do all drama in my stories. I trust the reader to know that war is bullshit. I do honor soldiers, if for no other reason than they feel they must protect, and they do it, without knowing what else to do. They mean well, and that's who you want on your side if you're so focussed on war that you find "the enemy" at your doorstep. Not that there has to be sides, or that people don't have everything they need to chose peace and prevent war in their personal experience long before it gets to that point. :-)
She snapped her finger and the bottom opened. Stacks of more letters and photos fell out. A somewhat sullen, dark haired girl looked out from them. They were wizard photos, and the girl merely stared intensely, sometimes blinking, sometimes looking off to the side in thought. It took him a minute to realize that he was looking at the same girl in multiple pictures, at various ages. Some of the teenage ones were muggle pictures, but most were magical in nature. There was something piercing about her, like hair and eyes that were unusually black in a world of muted brunettes and dark brown eyes. This must be the daughter, he surmised. He found one of both mother and daughter, and confirmed it. In the muggle world, photography had only been invented for around fifty years when these were taken. But wizarding methods of capturing images were older and more various.
It could’ve been a steep hillside on one of Ireland’s most remote landscapes. There, the sky framed Draco and his dragon, who perched on a distant ledge some feet behind him. The dragon wasn’t nearly as big in this dreamscape, but it was still impressive, and Harry saw that the color shifting in its plated armor, gave it the ability to conceal itself, blend with the background, or become invisible altogether. The dragon was regal and sat surveying the hills below, its silver eyes as sharp as an eagle’s. It watched with mild interest as Harry moved closer the Draco, who smiled.
“Oh my goodness!” Hermione covered her mouth in shock, stifling her laughter. She asked Luna, “Are you okay?”
Lucius looked confused. These were negotiations, not some kind of therapy intervention. The Potter’s dip into kindness, at precisely the moment when they should’ve been tightening restraints on the whole affair, did not make sense to him. While Draco’s outburst was unappealing, he could be forgiven, being the subject upon which so much rode. The Potter’s displayed no discipline at all. He could see that he was going to have to stay very close to this marriage if he wanted that grandchild.
Draco gave her a minute to crawl all over Harry and do her worst before rising and gripping her under her arms. He lifted her back into his lap and folded her outstretched arms against herself. When she started to pout and squeal, he bent to her ear.
There were no tears now. Just stilted silence. Harry’s ear wasn’t pressed quite so hard against the door. He’d heard most of what he needed to. He let the tension out of his neck and shoulders. He’d been waiting for something that would destroy his hope. He’d braced for it. He hadn’t heard it.
As he soared into position, he insisted that his body was ready for this, stroke or no stroke. Wizard doctors didn’t know everything. His training was in sync with his magic. It bothered him that he hadn’t felt sharp enough to apparate, but that was mental focus and he was all about summoning the strength in his body right now. If he felt a little off, he told himself he had every right to, and pushed it out of the way. The newspaper photo still left his stomach sour. He could always rest later. Besides, things he’d discovered in the past two days wouldn’t let him sit still if he wanted to. Since there was nothing he could presently do about any of it, might as well run his energy wide open, no apologies. Quidditch was just the way to do it.
A wall of molten hell descended on him. In that suspended moment, the car went airborne and engulfed. Harry could not know the state of the toxic materials around him, that he was breathing poisons, that he was losing consciousness, or the fact that he had fourth-degree burns before the fire ever reached him. Lack of gravity and balance shredded his body against collapsing walls.
Ash’s mouth hung open. He’d learned so much from the boy at the podium. Correction, Foster’s Harry Potter. And Foster’s true identity. Professor Severus Snape. He’d seen him, a solid apparition cast from the boy’s wand, into a massive, vaulted corridor of stone masonry, so clear and vivid and life-sized, that Ash could’ve stepped into it. Medieval torches cast long shadows, and a flourish of billowing black robes and hair, sent Ash’s imagination reeling.
Even though she was going out of her way to speak gently, her tone was mixed with both warmth and challenge. She hunched with trademark modesty, but looked him in the eye and dared him to argue with her. Tension, tightening her mouth, warned that she was holding back. Accustomed to wielding a lot of authority in her matriarchy, she knew she had the power to sway things. She didn’t want to frighten him away, but if the situation called for a stern word or two, she was ready. If it called for a fight, she’d let Draco know that she was fighting for him too. His coloring hid nothing. He looked grey with fatigue, and thinner than ever. She had only ever seen him groomed to perfection, so disorder in his hair and slept-in clothing, gave him a bone-frail strength about him. Like the most vulnerable person giving it everything he’s got.
He looked at Harry. "When you come back, we'll have a house elf of our own. You'll have to trust me."
“If you don’t shut up about it, you might. Yes, he’s my father and I can’t help but care about him. But he’s had a two-year grace period. You’ve held back as long as you could. You have your daughter to think about. We all knew it was coming.”
Elan put his hand to his chest. “I’m sorry, did I say something a little too forward? I thought we were all magical adults and could handle a little honesty, given that Harry is the guest of honor. As much as you’ve told me about him and Lily, how can I not tune in on all those feelings surrounding him? And how dare you refer to these nice people as business? These are the people you grew up with. They may not be perfect, but their hearts are in the right place.”
Harry allowed himself two seconds to breathe Greg’s woody cologne and to feel his body heat permeating his personal space. Then he said, “I have to check on my --”
“The truth is, there’s no one who could’ve made certain that you were where you wanted to be yesterday, instead of here, than you. But no, you had to listen to mommy and daddy and let yourself be pulled along. You had the power to stop it before it started. You. And you didn’t. I get that you’re so frustrated with your life, that you’re not thinking clearly. That you need a good cry, a good tantrum in a rubber room, maybe. No, sorry, I didn’t quite mean it like that. Just that, maybe you’re here, in my home, because I can actually help you. You’ve been horrible to yourself. You got sidetracked from your work. You’ve let your parents subject you to things you could’ve just said, ‘fuck off’ about. And obviously, you’ve been through something so horrible, you’re willing to tell me all the dark secrets you can think of, to scare me away, rather than tell me about the one that matters the most.”
He had to be careful. Just because they knew Snape was alive, didn’t mean they knew about his involvement in the wreckage. “That’s what I want to find out.”
When the boys were still teenagers, he could put a stop to it. Now, twenty years later, Draco pulled his own weight and proved ingenious enough to expand the family’s holdings and warrant his own say over the home that he acted as though he’d already inherited. That was the deal. He would only come home to help manage things if he could have any lover he wanted over. No questions asked.
Whatever flame came out of those magical lungs, they would be made of Draco’s molten core and Harry steadied himself to face them.
Minutes later, it shook as Harry handed it to him. “None of us can really read it. It signed itself before we were ready. It took over our wishes.”
Far from laughing, Foster grabbed Ash’s collar and they were gone. In that next instance, splashing water slapped Ash’s eardrums and thundered down the walls around him. Tons of rushing water echoed with reverberating, spanking slaps as it landed in gushes into an open pool below. Ash flailed, finding no stability around him as he and Foster balanced on a ledge of exposed rock. Foster was the one who balanced, as Ash’s footing shuffled to find the best purchase on the slippery surface. Foster continued to hold his collar, and this time Ash clung to him, not eager to fall into the pool many levels below.
“I see. I’m searching the global network for a Thella fortune teller. Can you provide any more information about her?”
He stood, his body language ready to make light of James’s dramatic request by disregarding anything Gringott’s manipulators had to say concerning his son’s courtship. He looked at the lines pointed out to him by James’s thick index finger. It took a second to register. In the next second, nostrils flaring with heated disbelief, he snatched the documents from James’s possession altogether.
He remembered what Narcissa had said, and made himself promise not to upset Draco. He stepped towards the bed.
Foster didn’t fool Ash. Yes, Ash dreaded what was coming, but Foster’s body and manner were too sublime to Ash, to pretend the wizard wasn’t sexy as hell. An angry Foster just seemed to make it worse. And Ash’s experience with angry spouses, two wives, had him remembering the best make-up sex he’d ever had. He deliberately made light of Foster’s intimidation by seeing his ex-wives standing with their hands on their hips, berating him for some other failure. It eased the knot in his stomach and gave him familiar ground to stand on. Foster was just a diva of an ex on steroids. Nobody used clothes to advertise capability the way he did. Diva. Ash wasn’t going to be cowed by that.
Sirius tried to reel it in, but he kept erupting. “I’m not going to be able to keep a straight face.”
In an instant, Snape’s wrist bent the other way, sending skin back against skull and staunching the pain instantaneously. Against a blood-soaked pillow, Collin gasped and shuddered. This time, when he looked at Snape through a film of tears, he saw unforgiveness staring back at him and didn’t say another word.
They got to the building, which looked convincingly empty enough. It was a traditional, three-story block tower that had once held offices and commercial services. But now, outdoor night air whistled clear through an array of empty panes from one side of the building to the other. Harry could see the leaning, modular cubicles abandoned inside, and piles of trash and broken furniture scattered along crushed tiles. Neglected landscaping hid the ground-level of black-faced windows and torn canopies. Broken glass littered the walkway bordering the property, giving credence to the caution tape and signs warning trespassers of full prosecution for their illicit squatting activities. So why didn’t the government clean it up?
Foster's eyes were nearly closed by the time Ash got a sedative into him. He opened them just as the needle was going in. The strength he used to clutch the doctor by his throat, startled Ash.
He really had. He knew how to get into the portrait now. He didn’t learn how Snape and he were related, but Eileen said that would come, as if she’d get Snape to talk. He practically had permission to go forward and now that he did, he couldn’t hold his excitement back.
They could only apparate so close to their target building. “Wizards are running this one,” Greg informed Harry. “They’ve got the best wards. The place has been active for over a year, and still no one’s found it.”
That was Harry’s experience inside the flame of Draco’s patronis. What he didn’t see, was how everyone in the room kept their eyes on his stag. As Draco’s dragon shrank, Harry’s stag grew. It didn’t reach mythical proportions like the dragon, but took on solidity. Its antlers branched out into symmetrical spikes that appeared to spray a silvery resin of magic from their tips as they grew. That’s where the dragon’s energy went. The antlers took on unnatural shapes, spiraling like fanciful mandalas as they increased in length to accommodate the magic. This is where Harry stored Draco’s excessive rage and neutralized it into something less volatile.
“However, since the two share a side on the same coin, I do admit you have crossed a line with me. You have wanted to be in my thoughts, well you are in them. I’ve thought extensively of what I would do if I could not convince you to stay in your world, and leave mine and Harry’s alone.”
Collin, who remained alert to the way the goblin put physical effort into things instead of using magic, looked on the offering with anger. “You are holding me prisoner and trying to feed me with this corpse laying right here? I assure you, I’m more civilized than that.”
He made a distasteful face and replied to Hermione, “I can’t even relax around my own family. There’s no way she’s learning that from me.”
But a split-second later, a squeaky elf voice sounded from the back seat. “You summoned Jipsy, Sir?”
There was such an ear-splitting rupture, felt in the soles of their feet, that Petunia shielded her head with her arms and called out for Dudley. She was certain the house had suffered collapsing damage under the impact of that vibration.
“Hi, aunty! Dad said I could come over if I finished my homework. I did it in record time. I made it, right before the rain hit. It’s clouding up out there like you wouldn't believe.” She breathed as if she’d ran the distance and not used magic at all. Lily knew that that was just how excited she was over the news of her cousin’s marriage.
“It’s fine, James.” She turned to Hermione. “Not now, sweetie. He’s scared enough as it is. You two, stand over there. Remus, get close to James. I want a circle.”
Polishing his appearance, was all done with an arsenal of last-minute spells that had him nervous that his reflection now showed a person trying way too hard. He wondered if he looked desperate. But this is how he looked when others, who were not his mother, went on and on about how handsome he was. This was how he looked when women asked him for his phone number in coffee houses, and when guys flailed next to him on the dance floor before making their offer to buy him a drink seem spontaneous and casual, and not hot for him at all. He wasn’t a social animal, but he did seek people and festive company when he could do no more with his work or his athletic prowess.
him, that meant they also knew him. He was used to that, but he wasn't eager to deal with all those conclusions about his character. It was one thing to know he had something worth giving, and another to put up with all the ignorance.
It wasn’t a sexual assault, but it was an equal violation. Yes, people have a right to throw their lives away if they want to, but he’d be damned if he was going to watch it happen. If that made him a controlling husband, then so what.
"I can’t go in with you on this one. One of us has to take care of her. I can’t keep giving you chances to get it together. Yeah, you go find Snape. She and I have a life to get on with. We’d love it if you were there, but you’re making other plans. And the more you talk, the more I’m alone with what I have to do. So no, I don’t want to hear anymore about Hogwarts. Act like her father while you’re still here, because we both know that a trial is coming, not to mention whatever fresh hell you’re about to dig up with that portrait. Just be here for her, and stop talking about anything else. That’s what I need you to do.”
He reached further into the opening, feeling for any bit of surviving evidence. He had to lay flat enough to extend his whole arm, wetting his body up to his chest. His hand felt for anything that could come loose and wasn't either ash or fused into solidity with other objects. Finally, something hard let go of its hold. He pulled his hand out, expecting to have in it, some shrunken hunk of cinder. Under fading daylight, he squinted. The thing was about five inches long. It looked like shriveled, black wood at both ends, but bubbled into hard plastic lumps in the middle. He couldn't tell if stink was coming from it or the bog, or all the wreckage. No telling what was decomposing in the water. As he stared at the object, his fingers tracing its melted surface, it turned on.
Must’ve slacked off his workouts to transform into his latest appalling role. He found Dan’s presence, one floor above him, to be distracting. It was bad enough that he had to come outside in his underwear to smoke, but he did it in the same damn pair for three days in a row.
A/N: In case it isn’t clear, the last chapter went into Draco’s flashback of the night before. This scene picks up at the same breakfast scene in chapter 34.
He had been so focused on catching his mother in a lie, he hadn’t noticed his father’s approach. There was no point in acting surprised. He bit off, “What do you have to add? Not that it’s going to do a damn bit of good.”
“Lucius Malfoy. Only his wand stands any chance of helping Harry and Draco. If there is a cure, he has it. Only Lucius has the means to undo the curse. His is the sixth wand that you need. In effect, it will act as a master wand.”
"One more thing. You stated that you believe you were barely conscious at some point. You landed in water. Can you show us the absolute last impression that you can recall of that moment?"
Just like Draco's change wasn't about Draco, Harry slipping beneath the covers wasn't about himself. His friend, the only one who'd stuck by him, had offered him something. The only proper thing to do was to accept it. That's why he'd placed an extra silencing barrier around the baby's bed and a sleeping charm over her. That night, after wondering if he could do it, he'd crept into the nursery and found Draco sleeping on the floor. That night, he made it about Draco. He made it about saying 'thank you' the best way he knew how.
The officer gave up. He'd seen this too many times before, and the case was too important. This young man was not going to press charges, and he was not going to admit to what had happened to him, though everyone in the precinct knew this distinct kind of shock when they saw it. There was even enough evidence to convict. But the guy stuck to his story, even though the truth spilled from his eyes. They felt sorry for him. Sorry, that he didn't seem to know they were within their rights to go after the proof. To go after a conviction. How to get the information out of him, without having a doctor put on gloves, hold him down, and rape him all over again?
“If he thinks he’s killed his child ruthlessly, the magic will result on that side of the fence. If he can see that it was an unintentional error, his magic cannot fault him. It must release him. In essence, he is the one and only god judging himself. My task is to provide a structure that easily guides him through his own sentencing, to a lesser punishment, or non at all, if he allows it. Until he awards himself that mercy, he will suffer this hell of his own making. He will hear that child’s cry until it drives him mad.”
Todrick continued. "If we were to give you the information you seek, we would in effect, betray the magic and the contract and all the oaths taken. Our magic would pay this wizard recompense and our overall potency would suffer. We never compromise that. We keep our establishment at its highest security and integrity through such magic. Were we to let it slip, our entire trust hierarchy would be compromised. We simply cannot give you the test that you've asked for."
She swallowed. “He’s the only man your body will let inside now. I know you. I know your anger will rise up, but don’t cheat on him. Don’t seek revenge. If you try, your body will not make things easy for you. Forgive him, Draco. He didn’t plan this. We did. This is magic that we must hide from the world. Please, my beautiful son. Forgive us. We need this baby. It’s only nine months out of your life. If you can’t forgive us, you’ll never have to see the child. But it has to live, for the whole family’s sake. Forgive us, Draco.”
Harry decided that he was far too sober for this, and committed to not thinking about anything else but the burn of alcohol he was steadily making his way towards.
That false concern made Harry smile at how transparent it was. It made him realize that even though he knew Greg was a lying sack of shit, those words, their comfort, still felt good to hear. Something in him wanted Greg to mean it. If he really had it in him to mean it, then Draco had something to worry about. But he didn’t. Not even when he stepped so close to Harry that he blocked out the light from the fireworks.
“Harry, this is not a good time.” Draco’s color drained and his eyes took on a round, clinical alarm, like a doctor keeping his cool, but terrified to give the worst diagnosis possible. “Get your clothes.”
“I can’t talk about this right now. I’m done arguing. You’re going to do what you’re going to do. Don’t talk to me anymore about it.”
Narcissa was allowed to calm her son while others held his shoulders and legs to the table. She patted his forehead with a cool cloth of dripping water. Her soothing words triggered even greater panic in Draco, as his body tensed at its entrapment. If his mother was here, if these people were resorting to this, he wasn’t going to be able to stop it from happening. Tears flowed. Someone, strangers, men he didn’t know the identities of, began raising his shirt and unfastening his pants.
He ran maneuvers with the balls until he felt good about his timing. It was 1:30 am when he put the equipment away and drug himself into his shower. As he lay in bed, he could hear Draco chastising him for making such a rash decision. 'Your blood, Harry. You actually paid goblins in blood? Without legal representation of any kind?'
She lowered her eyes as if she’d disappointed him. “I made the paper portkeys because I built a path from Grimauld to the paper. I have not built a path from Madam Eileen to here. She is deceased and I cannot go where she goes. I know of no one who can. Sorry, sir. My magic can do many things, but I don’t know how to get you into her picture, or bring her out.”
Harry sighed again. He wanted to show his gratefulness to Draco, but be fair to the baby. "What about a combination? Not 'Ni-cee', but 'I-eese'. Spelled I-e-c-e. Still has two syllables."
“It wasn’t like that. That thing is an architectural marvel, and appraised at millions. It’s far more complicated than any dollhouse.”
“It’s true that I will never forgive you and your colleagues. Are you going to give me answers, or are you going to rot in this place?”
At what point his free-fall turned into floating, turned into treading water, and riding currents by feel instead of sight, he didn’t know. He kept falling.
True to his word, Ash did not attempt to move the boy. He monitored his vitals and observed progress when he wasn't assisting at the hospital. New skin adapted coloration from the old. Parts of the boy's jaw had been baby smooth after Foster's transplant. Within forty-eight hours, his pours took on the shadow of a youth with the ability to shave.
"He can't make a decision about something that's going to involve you more than it involves anybody. You don't let people make those decisions for you. That's another reason I chose you. You'll never let anyone think for you."
Still, she was worth the sacrifice. Harry's as well as his own. At first he wasn't sure. Her presence was a novelty, unsought and unwanted. Then Narcissa had smiled bravely, her grace unfailing, and said, "I want her. We can't leave her to him. He's been raised by those without magic, he doesn't know any better. He doesn't know how to temper the Malfoy heritage. Her magic knows us and it will expect us to do right by it."
He'd been prepared to hate her, for he knew quite well that she was power having taken the form of a child. But her acceptance told him that she was not his enemy. If anything, she was one of the few who could really see him, and approved of what she saw. She had come to do work, to shift entire concepts among the masses. She was glad to have come through him. Each time he went to her bed, they regarded each other like old friends.
“What, you’re afraid you’ll turn and the wolf will hurt me? I’m padfoot. I can handle you. I’d stun you and apparate us to our safe place. I know the drill. Come on. Please?”
A/N: There will be a total of four updates tonight, or in the AM hours. The next two chapters will center on Draco and Harry. This is number 2 of 4 updates this evening. :-)
He licked his dry lips. “Like everyone getting out of this hallway and letting me see if I can talk to him.”
Perhaps that's why the young man stood out to her. She was the darkest person in her daily environment, and had learned to thrive being different from the norm in a new culture. He looked to be her opposite. Positively one of the whitest people she'd ever seen, and not blending in, even here. Genetics were amazing. And once she'd seen the alarm on his face, when asked to put the child down for his scan, she couldn't stop watching him. He'd survived the five seconds of not holding the little girl, then sweeping her up, only to be told he had to take her through. He recovered his watch and rings, and took a seat on the other side of the barrier. Hattie wanted to tell him that he could rent a stroller around the corner, but the way he pressed the child to his chest, as if shaken, told her that would've been tantamount to another security assault. Royals. She saw them all the time, dressed incognito. Slumming it, getting their kicks under the tabloid radar. She didn't know what blue-blooded tree this young man had fallen from, but he was not used to navigating his way through an airport with common folk. She didn't hold it against him. Poor dear. That's what happened when everything was done for you.
She stepped ahead of him, to the mural behind the table. On it, sat the bayou centerpiece, a house. A rickety, Antebellum period home sitting on marshy wetlands. It was a peeling, decrepit estate with columns and two levels of terraces holding its own after a century of encroaching heat and damp. It stood behind bogs and roots that straddled the water level by two feet. Light’s flickered in moss strewn windows. Shadows moved across them as if there were people inside. Somewhere on the creaky old porch, windchimes made of stretched bottles rattled in isolation. They pierced the room with their clinks. Crickets and cicadas added to the music. She pushed at the door of the house and beckoned him to follow.
Todrick lost his pleasant smile upon hearing the last. "You do not have to pay for the truth, Mr. Potter. We are always honest with you."
Harry searched Draco for approval. Draco lowered his head, scratched his chin and visibly reasserted his immersion into his work. Thrumming fingers betrayed his failed concentration.
In that cleared space, seventeen years caught up with them. She couldn’t help but smile. She’d know that distinct voice anywhere, and the way he used it to speak from the calm center of a storm.
That was all it took. An avalanche of relief rushed between them, and suddenly a sit down chat didn’t seem so far out of reach. Dan offered a drink, but Tom said he was only coming up to check the suitcases. An hour after sunset, both sat stuck to the cheap plastic chairs overlooking the pool below. A few, unsupervised teens swam below, while fireworks thundered in the distance. If they sat quietly, they could make them out across the horizon.
They began a game of coaxing her to hold her breath and dunking her. Harry thought that she would need a magical spray of air blasted at her to trigger the instinct. But when he exaggerated taking a huge gulp of air and sucking it in, she did the same. When he let it out, so did she. They extended the depth of the pool by a few feet to practice. Soon, in stages, he had her looking at him from underwater before quickly dashing back up. Draco was amazed at how fast she learned.
Everyone took to their brooms. They saw him transform. Once in the air, Harry had something to prove and his expression lost the open appeal of someone eager to belong. It grew tight with concentration as he filtered out everything that had nothing to do with mowing down the counter team’s chasers. This was where he knew his midnight workouts, with Draco at the Ministry and Iece in her bed, would pay off. Insomnia was a bitch, and during the months when it had been at its worse, weights and jogging were the only way to leave the worrisome monologue in his head behind.
That’s what he liked about her. To the point. He thought about asking for privacy, but said what the hell and turned up his drink. “I’m having an incredible night. I need an incredible experience.”
She nodded, releasing the confirmation reluctantly. She knew the significance it would have for him. Surely his parents had filled her in on the whole negotiations fiasco yesterday.
Snape swallowed his regrets. This was his fault. His and James’s. He had left this child alone, to fend for itself. How could he think or dare to hope that anything from him, produced of his magic and quality, would have it easy in this world?
She agreed with him, coming closer. “No, you’re right. I don’t know. All I know is what you’ll lose if you go away. And I’ll say anything to get you to understand. You have to keep this child. For almost three years, you’ve been nothing but a light for Harry. You’ve loved the hardest you’ve ever loved for him. This child is all that exists of your purest feelings for him. Iece is perfect, bless her, but you’re cleaning up something your father did. With this one, it’s living proof that Harry inspired you to forsake everything you’ve been taught to hate, and to simply love. That is what’s coming to life inside of you, and I’m begging you not to destroy it.”
He nodded. "That's fine." She could've told him he'd have to play all three positions simultaneously, blindfolded, and he would've agreed. After hospitals and finding pieces of himself, this was an opportunity to dive back into something close to what he knew. His reputation had escorted him past formal tryouts, even though he’d volunteered to do so after the news of making the team bolstered a shit storm of protests from league officials and serious quidditch fans. Sponsorship for the matches argued that the goal was charity, not sportsmanship, and his presence was there to raise money, not win games. Since the team had nothing to do with the professional industry, Harry’s fame and school reputation were ruled as valid criteria for his selection. The argument had made him feel as if he’d bought his way onto the team, and he was eager to put fears of his incompetency to rest.
She pushed the last of her energy into the symbols and there appeared a band of writing that lit up the entire circumference of each wheel. Then she drew back her arms and jumped, little witch that she was, propelling herself onto an invisible current that lifted her closer to the structures. From there, she took off at a run. Harry watched her step on air and use her hands to remotely grab the neon lines she’d just created. With the pull of her hands, the lines tied themselves. She pulled her arm back, and the writing flew to her in strings that kept it attached to the wheels. She turned and bounded back to the ground, ran past Harry and found Lucius’s cowering body on the floor. His was the only one Harry could clearly see, and it only became visible because Eileen parted the darkness. Lucius was shaking, but couldn’t seem to identify the source of his torment. Eileen put her boot on his chest, threw her arms back, and a matrix of spells exploded around them.
He tried to keep silent for the few minutes it should’ve taken her, but her movements were extra fastidious instead of her usual practical speed. She hummed and took time to rearrange the new dark mink falling around her shoulders. At least he thought it was a mink. He honestly couldn’t pin down what creature had given its life for its plush black fur.
“Because I don’t want to let go. I don’t want to go back to all that confusion. My mind is so clear here.”
It looked like a flat, pale brown Cherio to Harry, the size of a quarter. He let her slip it around his neck.
"No, it isn't a fucking glamour. Did it feel like one? I did that for you! I remember the fevers. I remember the swelling and what it put my brain through. All I did was retrace the steps. I made myself feel every second of what it was like and my body changed, okay?"
Scooped into his arms, he crushed her to his chest. Draco was gone, so he indulged in the feel of her smallness, her heart against his, and her thin arms attempting to hug him back just as tightly, for a little longer. He realized he was trying to hug her in such a way that she would never forget his love for her if something were to happen. He willed it into her and to grow with her.
Sirius and Remus were pulled forward by intrigue. James took a step back. Harry’s friends held stock still. Hermione in particular. He was too perfect. Too svelte, too straight, like a Japanese anime character. His hair was positively orange with shining gloss. He looked more like an endangered species than a human being. Exotic, and prettier than anyone in the room.
Avi held up his hands and made a show of backing off. “Take some time, then. I encourage you. Today was too much of a shock.”
She accepted, smiling in the spotlight of his million-dollar grin. To outsiders, her taunts might’ve been misinterpreted. But between them, it was another way to keep him attentive to her and talking. He didn’t back down from friendly sparring, verbal or otherwise. They’d played like this for years and no one was ever really sure how serious they were. Maybe because he was always a perfect friend and gentleman, she felt safe enough with him to test her bravery. She and Ron were already ex’s, but that friendship was sacred. She was too proud to admit anything so flight-headed and stereotypical as being the girl who kept falling in love with her friends. If she didn’t admit it, then it didn’t have to be true.
He’d wanted to say ‘relax’ but decided not to push it. Jipsy left him to his task, taking sideways glances at him. They both knew he was waiting on Harry’s call.
A click on the lock sent everyone scattering. Harry and Draco never heard the commotion their families made to scramble away from the door and act natural. Thanks to last minute muffling charms, that Gamy realized she had to cast because she could not keep her household from squabbling over who got to hear what was being said through the door, the boys were protected from a lapse in grace and decorum. It was her idea to have them looked in on, but she never anticipated having to intervene on the intervention.
“Yeah, mate. Sucks to be you right now.” Ron seemed to have slowed down enough to enjoy the taste of the wine. He swirled it around his mouth and looked impressed at his glass. “Stuff’s not bad. If you drink enough of it.”
He had to be careful. His family was up, and surely lurking with good intentions. But this was still private. When he heard nothing, he said, “If you’re awake, just make a noise. This is a big change for you, it’s okay if you’re not ready to talk.”
Draco tried to go around, tripping over the real issue. “Don’t be ashamed of her hair. No cosmetic spell is permanent.”
“Don’t try to manipulate me like that. I could spill my guts and that won’t guarantee you can help her. Give me time to wrap my head around this.”
As if it were a competition, and Dan didn’t like losing, he went after Tom’s zipper. Tom was tempted to push his hands away, but knew he couldn’t say no when Dan’s hand took him and pulled him out. He was afraid of this, but he couldn’t stop it. Dan pulling on him meant that it was all going to end too soon and he just wanted to keep Dan whimpering and riding his thigh. For some reason, this kind of frustrating friction, was way more satisfying than going for the kill. The pleasure lasted longer and he didn’t want it to end. But Dan’s grip said that he was determined to end it while it was at its peak.
Her eyes had lowered as she admitted. "A lesser person would resent her. But she exists because you were keeping us alive. If Harry Potter's magic, and yours, had to unite to save my family, then so be it. I want her here, so that we can be her primary influences. Make up to your son. Make up to Harry. Those were war crimes, done upon orders to do so. They shall not stop us from living to the fullest extent of our abilities. We've suffered enough. Get your son back, and bring me that baby. Harry can't be happy with her, not under those circumstances. If we make a show of throwing ourselves on his mercy, of expressing true sorrow, we might be able to relieve him of his burden. You know she's only a burden to him."
“Oh my god,” Hermione reacted. “You’re going to use a spirit summons on someone who’s perfectly alive. I’ve never seen that performed. That ring is a conductor?”
“Discussing matters in the loo with the doctor, where they hope it’s more private,” Remus chuckled. He remembered that Harry was practically mourning beside him, and gave his arm a pat. “Ah, sorry.”
“No. I have no need for a traditional studio. My hands are full with the baby, and I like it that way. I don’t need anything competing with my time with her. My computer is fine for now.”
“What you saw earlier, was such a spike in her magic, that her hormones could not regulate her body temperature. We had to get it down, and quickly. I warn you, when you see her, she will have a rather striking pink tint to her skin. That’s the effect of the medication in the ice we used. We had to go with old fashioned techniques, packing her body and bringing her core temperature down until we had a grasp on things. Any attempt to use magic, gave us unpredictable results. She shut our equipment down, but she still responded to synthetic medicines.”
He screamed for Draco. The others outside, heard the breakage, heard something in his voice, and came running.
“Not to worry, sir. She came to teach you.” She pointed at him. “Her magic is more like yours, than the one you fear. Her troubles are because her magic is good, not because it’s bad. It won’t take his pattern.”
He didn’t want to argue with her. He was losing time. “You’re loving. Do it for me. Tell me the answer.” He hit the table with his finger. “Get me into this picture.”
He closed his eyes, squeezing back the instinct to drive his fist into a wall. Harry should’ve discussed that with him. Then he thought, maybe he did, he wasn’t sure. He wanted to punch something so badly, he felt the urge pressurize in his chest. He wished he was as evil as people thought, so that he wouldn’t have any problem hitting this woman. When he spoke, his throat constricted and his emotions betrayed him.
He rubbed his face and drew himself up. There was no dignity in hitting her, he knew, but he wanted to. So he said instead, “When my family lies, we’re corrupt, but when you lie, you’re just doing what’s best for Harry. How come everyone’s okay with exposing my family’s skeletons, but Harry’s image can’t be tarnished?”
To keep from coming too soon, Tom pushed himself up, forcing Dan to stand. Their kissing barely broke, but surged together again when Dan threw himself into Tom’s arms. The other held their pelvises apart by putting a fist length between them that went straight for Dan’s hard-on. Tom bunched it through the fabric and gushed as he felt it roll thickly in the folds. The real reward was Dan’s moan as it burst from him, distracting him from his kisses. His body went slack against Tom under the workings of the other’s hand. Even in the dark, Tom saw spittle bubble at the corner of his lips as his eyes fogged over in abandon of their faculties. He hung on to a fistful of spongy engorgement, kneading it into something harder, rounder, and straining to come out of that fabric.
There were seven formal stages, depending on the structure chosen. Both families had agreed on a foundation of old magic and modern ethics. The parents would define courtship procedures and everyone would agree upon them. Parents would set rules of conduct, which could be strict or very lenient, and write in the official date that marked them as engaged. They would insist that the boys adhere to ritual every step of the way, but let them adjust in phases. Give them a chance to come to agreement on their own terms.
But not Harry. This guy was clingy as fuck, and the way he’d drawn close enough to sniff Draco, left the other wondering how bad the repercussion would be to cross him. Just because Harry had forced him into a courtship, didn’t mean there was going to be any wedding. He had some balls. Draco would just have to be extra vigilant that this guy with the weird birthmark, didn’t back him into that particular corner. Harry was good looking. Even kind, until he started with that possessive shit. But it didn’t matter. Draco couldn’t marry him. He couldn’t risk putting his body through that all over again. Not for anyone. The boyfriend story came in handy. It was so much kinder than the real reason he couldn’t marry Harry.
Harry wrinkled his face and his eyes fluttered open, squinting under the lights. Obscure outlines became faces. Faces became people he recognized, and it took another minute for them to mean anything to him. He heard a slap and his head automatically turned to see Narcissa attempting to wake Draco with the same method used to wake him. People talked in muted voices.
He got two steps away before he heard, “What was I supposed to do? I couldn’t beat you in the air, I can’t compete with that diva you call a boyfriend. You’re the hottest piece of ass on this tour and there I was sitting that close to you. I didn’t stand a chance, so I took what I could get away with in the moment. Haven’t you ever felt your one and only chance to make a move slipping away? So I did something I shouldn’t have. I’m sorry if it pissed you off, but I’m not sorry.”
Harry noticed that Draco was shrewd and didn't lose his poise at the mention of Death Eaters and torture. How eerily 'Malfoy' of him, it was. In telling his own story, which Draco assumed was common knowledge by then, he thought he was keeping Harry from having to tell his. They'd worked out that Harry's fits had something to do with having the choice to be a father completely taken away from him.
Their foreheads touched, appreciating the last intimate moment they would have together for a while. Draco’s grip on him felt harder and more desperate than usual. He wondered why Draco was shaking.
The little person's conviction did not waver. "She makes the proper summons as you make it. Your daughter has learned to imitate you, sir. She may be too young to speak like you, but she plays your voice in her mind. I will not be held accountable for tricks that only she is capable of. But I will correct her. There will be no ice cream."
“If I wanted to kill you, they would’ve discovered your corpse in your holding cell this morning. I brought you here, to show you this. Look around you. You wanted to see magic, Mr. Hastings. You wanted it in your life, up close and personal, as it were. Well here I am. This is my dwelling. This is my magic. Drink your fill. You won’t be seeing much else for quite a while. And even that possibility could die with you.”
The door swung inward and on the other side of the screen, a large man crinkled his face down at Harry. “We’re closed, buddy. Whoever you’re looking for, they can wait till this storm passes.”
All the folklore wasn’t bullshit. All those stories had been based on something. Maybe inaccurate, maybe ridiculous, but still about something someone was trying to explain. It reminded him of the theory that Biblical men and women were trying to explain a future technology they had never seen before. A processing computer, or a space ship. Dimensions crossed for them too. They’d used the translated words, ‘It had three brains...’ or ‘It had five faces...’ It took Ash ages to reason out that ‘brains’ were their only way of saying that the object appeared to think, not some multi-headed monster. And ‘faces’ simply referred to the front-most part of an object, like a house facing West, or a window facing the park. When studied between the distance of hundreds of years, common sense seemed to lose all shape and definition, thrusting even a scientific person back into the world of confusion. Historical people saw things they couldn’t explain, they weren’t stupid. It’s only the translation of modern thinking that introduces that temptation.
“You’d try to live by your word. You’d try to love her. But you can’t speak for everyone in your family. And no, I’m not accusing your relatives of going around taking their anger out on children. It’s just that you can’t watch her every second. Her security will cost a fortune. People would challenge you and threaten your family if she came to live with you. You’ve already lost one son over the hatred that just keeps going. I can’t leave her with you.”
Harry wanted to use insane laughter to protect himself from Mr. Weasley’s fear. To use it as a buffer against any remorse threatening to bubble up from the acid in his stomach. But nothing came. He sat there willing Ron’s father to go away and leave him to his punishment.
is perfectly legal, to protect his life. Those were pretty high stakes in the war and more lives were saved than destroyed by his decisions. Severus Snape deserves his anonymity. His privacy. It’s no different than the muggle version of a witness protection program and assuming a new identity.”
“Yes. I need you to be your annoying, pushy self. I’m too damaged to give you this incredible wedding night. That’s not going to happen for a while. But I honest to god need you inside of me. Push me. Make me forget myself. While I’m ready. Take control. Before the insecurities take over. Please. I need you to. I’ve played it safe for so long. I don’t want to be scared to let myself have this anymore. I’m telling you, I was never a saint in bed. Fuck me out of my mind. I give you permission. If I fight you, it’s just nerves. Don’t give me a chance to, and don’t hold back.”
He brought his hands together, clasping them and unconsciously asking for help in finding the simplest, kindest words.
Suspicions had Harry sniffing the picture of water. “Oh my god.” He turned it up, gulping, and handed it to Emerald. “Drink. It’s their water. Food of the gods. Ambrosia. In Draco’s mind, it sustains their magic. His head is filled with so much mythology, it’s all running together. We’re not talking to anything real. We’re talking to his superstitions. His fears.”
He continued, “Well, I wouldn’t be here if it didn’t concern my daughter’s health. I explained everything I could in the letter, I just don’t have answers to it all. But I’ve been investigating for a while and I’m led to the portrait. With your permission, I’m hoping to engage with it to try to get answers. I’ll consent to any security wards, in order to have the time alone with it. I’ll disturb as little as possible and leave like I wasn’t even here.”
“Harry’s birthmark is significant to his magic. I’ve never seen a lightning shaped birthmark, but it stands to reason that the mark is a reminder to him just as yours is a private reminder to you. Every time he looks in the mirror, there’s something he wants himself to never forget. Your mother uses old magic without all the modern political correctness to filter it. I wouldn’t doubt if she already knows the answer to your question.”
The last thing he remembered, was slicing through the air with his wand and casting a portal charm.  He’d never mastered the spell, and only seen it performed by one other person. He’d read about it, saw the value of it, but knew that learning it required an acceleration of magic that could only be had at the cost of compromising his ethics. The technique was synonymous with criminal activity. It was used in crimes of stealth, especially murder, where one could be there and gone in the next instance without being traced. It also pulled vast magic from the atmosphere, draining the resources of the natural world, and left an electromagnetic anomaly that took time to dissipate. For this, the technique flirted with being considered a dark art. So instead, he cast a basic intent for the spell, knowing it wasn’t potent enough to create a stable portal. He just needed a window. A view onto the object he hated the most at that moment. His magic would find a way to deliver the message. He was absolutely certain. He possessed enough rudiments to see what he wanted through a rough outline that he’d hacked into the space in front of him.
“We’re not your government. We’re not any one government. We’re made up of governing bodies and parliaments all over the world. We represent magical and non-magical beings, who do not necessarily hold allegiance to traditional territories.”
“He’d protect me. He’d protect all of us. You have never understood him. I haven’t spoken to him since Harry was five. How can you stand there and act like you don’t remember how scared we were, when no doctor could help? The Malfoys feel that way right now. Harry feels that way.”
Draco opened his palm and held it over the broom. He had only to think the command, ‘up’, before the thing lifted, vibrating in concert with his magic. He let his long fingers stroke its smooth surface and tested the weight. His center of gravity harmonized with the counterbalance built into the broom.
James was not a religious man, but it was at that moment that he called upon every deity he’d ever heard of. “Let’s just get through the next ten minutes. And I’m not starting till the alcohol arrives.”
“You said you were lovers. You and this teacher. Today, your father said your body was intended to get pregnant with the first man you had sex with, to ensure offspring. So where’s the baby?”
From her blanket, shiny dark eyes squinted up at him. Harry hoped she wouldn't need glasses. He didn't want anything coming between him and those interested irises. White glacier hair, and black ice for eyes. It would be some time before he understood where those eyes came from.
“It’s my only connection to Snape. That portrait is the only lead I have. He can help her. Once I’ve found him, we can leave all of this behind us.”
“I know, I’ve hid it well, I guess. Even from myself. If anything I’ve said makes you uncomfortable, I’ll understand if you choose not to work for me anymore. I’m finding it difficult to pretend I’m okay with myself. I’m not.”
Again, Draco tried to imagine who would be doing this. “Can you break their hold? Shield us? Just for a second. If you can, I can apparate her out of here.”
"Was it raining when you found me, or had it?" The spot didn't look like it could've been even an inch under water within the last few days, but he had to ask. It might've been possible for a downpour to collect in this spot before sinking into the ground. But that meant mud. He should've been able to see a muddy imprint of his body, right?"
"Who cares if you're a hero," the woman heckled him, even as security approached her. "It doesn't bring back my child, who had nothing to do with your crazy war!"
“Yeah, you know him. He has no idea when he’s treating someone like shit. Let’s just hope she’s nothing like him. Mum and Dad will understand.”
There was no doubt that this was the right place, he just needed a second to process it. He was sure this wasn’t what they called the bayou. It was a city street. A town. He saw enclosed terraces and people sitting behind screens. Some saw him through the rain, squinting, uncertain of where he had just come from. He tried not to be any more conspicuous and dashed the rest of the way up Thella’s walk. He took her porch steps two at a time and hovered in the shelter of her large roofed porch. There were lots of plants and lacquer patio furniture. A a woman’s road bike leaned against the inner railing, with tennis shoes left and forgotten to get soggy. The air was muggy, but rising wind chilled him through his clothes. Without a coat or umbrella, he’d been totally unprepared for the environment. He wanted to spell a hooded jacket, but couldn’t be sure who was watching him. He was a little disoriented and not quite sure of what to say, but if she was willing to see him, that was all the space he needed to get on with this.
Amid rolling eyes, and shaking heads, Narcissa’s slender body threatened to come out of its dress coat and leave it behind when people couldn’t get out of her way fast enough. Her tone was viscious.
“Oh my god. I’ve been so scared of telling you. You’ve known all along. You lied to Harry. I thought you did it, because I gave you no choice. I lied to you. But you knew I’d been with a man, and you still told him that I hadn’t. You knew everything all along. No wonder his magic went crazy. I’m lucky he still wants me. I’m lucky he saw through me.”
Narcissa spoke up. “What my husband means is, we require an external representation of your magic. Ideally, your patronis.”
Or, did Harry’s magic simply claim it as an acquisition? Even natural magic expands that way in certain strains. It absorbs the available power around it, not consuming it, but learning from it and replicating in strength.
Draco stirred in his arms, opened his eyes, and twisted out of them. It was as if the mere presence of the child woke him into action. Once he saw it, he paused. Harry knew what he was thinking. If he runs after it, he’s never going to catch him.
Everyone in the wizard community knew this day was coming, before the two boys ever set foot in the school. The village watches its own.
He really wasn’t one hundred percent sure, he simply knew he had to go forward. She was a bit high strung, like she was trying too hard. Like she wasn’t used to making friends, but needed him to trust her quickly. Then, when he least expected it, she could go calculatingly quiet, rerouting her angle. She was a little scattered, but maybe that was because the memory of Eileen wasn’t purely that of a deceased girl, but of a real and current spirit trying to tell him more than they had time for.  He really didn’t know what the hell she was talking about. But this was Snape’s mother, after all. And Snape had done so much for him.
"Here's the thing," Bicksby started, "We've seen your speeches. We know you can show people what's in your mind without a pensieve."
She sat in her high chair while Harry worked his way around the kitchen, wearing an apron over his undershirt and drawstring pajama bottoms. They had music from a muggle radio and animations played in the living room behind them. He wanted to stay home with them, but couldn’t skip this particular meeting. He was going to talk to Banks and try to stall Harry’s trial as long as possible. Guilt nagged at him to go check on his father, but he knew that was just his mother asserting her disappointment in him telepathically. He stayed away from any news of the incident on purpose. He knew what his father was made of, and as long as he was breathing, he’d recover. Draco really couldn’t think about it anymore beyond this, lest he go running to his bedside, only to have Lucius open his eyes and with them, say, “Checkmate. I knew you’d come.”
Though Morell’s globular eyes were swollen open, their light faded to milky infection, something behind them screamed,
It didn’t make up for the ‘thousand other nights’ comment that implied something to be desired in their domestic routine, and there were still layers of blanket and clothing between them, but it made the moment so much more interesting.
“If you’ve ever see a baby use one of those walkers, you’ll know how they get excited when something is placed in front of them and they try to move towards it. They know they want it, they just have to learn to coordinate their foot movement. And often, the easiest steps they can make, are the ones that take them backwards, away from what they want. This practice is really an exercise in dimensions and desire. We can only see and measure the baby’s progress, but we can’t see or measure how its emotional field is dictating how well it leaps from a forward reality and a backwards one.
He ignored Lucius in favor of a sign from Draco. When he looked back to the spot, he froze. A red smear had formed beneath his finger. A syrupy dot of blood. He bent closer, looking for a cut, but realized that the skin was simply tearing at the slightest touch. The slightest pressure released a beaded drop. A new development. Harry tried to control his shaking. He could already see that the problem purpled beneath Draco’s skin. What didn’t flow out, flowed beneath it, into the pockets that it could. That white patch became an amorphously shaped bruise in less than a minute.
There were bags under her eyes, but her smile was gracious.  She aimed a sharp, pointed look at them, with the lines of her mascara. But weariness, conveyed by her dry throat, made her sound sincere. She seemed just as exhausted as her son.
In one hand, she held her wand. With the other, she extended her arm and raised a palm. It came across as a plea to be patient with her rushed explanations.
He had little time to ridicule his inappropriate appreciation for the gift of sight. Severus’s wand poised ten inches over Draco’s skin and sent plasmic shoots the size of thread, into four precise corners. These little tracers hooked onto whatever he intended for them to grab. As he worked, he explained, “Each thread will wrap around the object, cauterizing as it detaches it. The object will loosen and slip free, if it is not attached to deeper constraints. Spells are fading as we speak and his cells are stimulated to immediate healing as the object creates its own point of exit. The threads will close each minute rupture behind it. You won’t notice his scars unless you look for them.”
He grabbed Emerald and tried to push her down next to Draco. But the gate was gone. It sat meters away. Draco sprawled as if it had just gotten away from him. He took off after it. Harry ran too, grabbing Emerald. How was he supposed to keep up with both of them, and what was the point of all this shit?
He thought that finally hearing that scream, that cry, would give him some satisfaction. The sound of Lucius, reduced to grovelling and begging in pain, should’ve produced pure euphoria. It didn’t. It sounded no different than hearing any man humbled by the effects of pain. That strangled sob made him seem more human, not less. Its pitiful inflection robbed Harry of his prize by showing him what he’d done. He’d beaten a man too slow and too old to hurt him without magic. Lucius’s sobs were now open and loud. Is that how he’d sounded the night it happened? He’d wanted to make Lucius cry the way he’d cried for so long, he listened for that same depth of helplessness, that same abyss of shame, and didn’t stop smashing and breaking things until he heard it.
People shifted to let others organize around them. It was such an unusual request, that everyone waited to see who would present themselves. The women who showed up, were young and older. Two of them were pregnant, and Harry thought this was what Severus was implying. But Severus waited, eyeing the row of women, dissatisfied. Some of them twitched uncomfortably under his gaze.
“Severus, God-no! Please, I’m not lying to you. Not on purpose. A master wand would make more sense than a sixth mediocre wand. I really thought the master wand was the key. The sixth wand he’s talking about, isn’t a master wand at all. It’s the weakest wand in terms of the curse. It had nothing to do with creating the spell. It was just there to add a flaw, to keep Draco alive in case it could be undone later. It’s not an actual counter. It’s a piece of tape painted under a masterpiece. Rip it off, and the entire painting is ruined. The entire illusion falls apart. But the curse is meant to take root in the cells of the body, in the DNA. However much the painting is ruined, what’s left on the canvas remains. It may not be a masterpiece any longer, but neither is it anything worth looking upon. The Unbearable is a masterpiece of a curse, but if you ruin it, that doesn’t mean that Harry and Draco will be fully recovered. It could make things worse.”
Avi Rankar shook hands with the muggle doctor. "Pleasure working with you. Now that I've seen Harry, I'm afraid I'll have to head back to London. He's in good shape, mentally and physically. If you'll just look in on him for the remainder of his detainment, he shouldn't need anything else. And of course, your assistance with the other volunteers, is invaluable."
In spite of his better judgment, Harry moved closer. “Draco, I’m not doing this to hurt you. You’re family now. Iece thinks you’re her father. I need you more than ever. Don’t resent what I have to do to get her help.”
Gamy Evans, leaning quietly behind Harry, pushed herself up on her cane and told them, “These two need to work out their own problems. It won’t be a marriage till they can be trusted to do that. You don’t learn that from courtship.”
He’d seen it in Harry’s trauma, from the vials he kept of those damaged emotions. He had studied dark vapor sliding in the tube as he held it up to the light. It mixed with Harry’s blood. It had been drawn directly from the transmitting neurons of his brain, taking cells and tissue with it, to give Harry’s mind a chance to heal. He’d sat for hours staring into those vapors, reading them with occlumency, to search for Harry amid the storm-like chaos he found there. In order to read it, he had to sidestep Harry’s horror-filled night in a way that was impossible for Harry himself.
This was the part she was supposed to say out loud, for clear intent to the Universe. It made all the difference between enjoying memories and contacting the real thing. But when it came time to speak her incantation into the room, she squelched it. That was personal. She was already being judged enough.
He heard laughter in her response to his examination of the mural. “I assure you, my average customer never sees the magic, only the paint.”
She shook her head. “Only that his love goes where you go. They’re all saying that. They want to keep it very general, so as not to distract you from the point of being here.”
When he asked his father about it, Lucius had chuckled, “He’s always been off his game where that boy is concerned. His weak spot. Never fall in love with your victims, I always say.”
He turned to Lily. “Please tell them it’s okay. Let the lad stay in there as long as he wants. They must be just as exhausted as we are. Persuade them to come have drinks. Tell them negotiations are over for today, I don’t care what happens.”
Foster jerked his body away, using his shoulders to twist out of Ash's grip. His right arm made a feeble attempt to hold Ash back. "It will heal," he insisted.
Lucius could not hide the tightness in his mouth now. He stood, leaving the chair swinging behind him. His throat constricted and his words came out hoarse. “Ask yourself if you really want to do this, Harry. Do not let your temperament get the better of you. If you kill me, you will have to tell the world why. You will have to come up with a reason for invading my home and attacking when I have no weapon and have made no threats. We both know that you don’t want to do that.”
Also, I never use lube between my guys. I like the idea of his body being intelligent enough to secrete antibacterial and slippery substances that are considered clean. This is magic and fantasy, after all.
“I also conducted some tests that allowed me to step into Draco’s magic. The dragon is a portal. A patronis that leads to his center. His personal gods live at his center. Everything he loves lives there. And everything he fears, lives there. I incited the dragon’s fire and found myself inside. I saw what was needed. I saw the child he loves so much. That fire spat me back out, not in the entertainment room, but in this room, at the feet of my fiancé.”
Petunia examined the broken door and the mess she’d left spilling out. She could see that a shelf had broken, probably under the girl’s weight, causing an avalanche of boxes. Behind them, a narrow space opened further into the interior of the house. She saw the old corridor between the walls, where she and Lily used to play. Well, where Lily used to try to get her to come, but she’d been terrified of the idea there were spiders in there. It only took one romp into a web bigger than her whole body once, to put her off spidery places for life. She’d been ten and chasing after her carefree sister through the woods. She should’ve known Lily would simply avoid the nest while she ran right into it. She’d screamed and cried the whole time Lily worked to pulled those tiny red spiders out of her hair. They were smaller than the head of a nail, but still creepy.
“Is cweeem!” she shouted, poking him with her pudgey index finger. So much zeal went into pleasing her Daddy, that those closest saw a blue spark leave the place where she’d touched Harry’s arm. All of them heard it. All of them saw Harry retract his arm and rub at the spot.
The stranger was obviously limping, obviously wounded and moving with the drag of someone taking their last steps. Ash remembered that sort of fatigue from his military days and he waited for the man's shock to take its course. When he saw him collapse, only then did he dare approach the stranger and shine a light into his face. He could've restrained him and contacted the authorities. He had no idea what side of the killings the man was on. Not really. But the fact that he'd had to defend himself against numerous unnatural attacks, had Ash driving his Land Rover onto boggy, peat soil, to maneuver the man into his vehicle. His flashlight revealed a mid-sized man swallowed in excessive vestments. His silver-grey hair, tied behind his head, plastered wetly over a harassed expression filled with tension behind closed eyes. By the time he'd secured the man with double sedation, and gotten him back to his house, the hair was jet black and Ash could see that it belonged to a man much younger than he'd thought. The dramatic, impossible change, both frightened and fascinated Ash.
“You don’t let up, do you? You’ve kidnapped me with your magic, and now you’re demanding that I talk about the worst time in my life. You’re proving yourself, all right. I can’t talk about it. Ask me anything but that.”
Harry was sure of those words, but he was still figuring out the next as he spoke them. “I could write a tolerance clause into our contract that would let you take a lover without violating our marriage. I could give you permission.”
Should Harry say something about Snape’s tampering with wreckage evidence? “Am I in trouble for keeping evidence to myself?”
After all, no prison or bank vault could hold up to it. It was the kind of magic outlawed in polite society, but Harry didn’t hesitate to use it in his home.
She closed her eyes and brought forth her last, most vivid memory of her friend. Now was the time to give herself full permission. As soon as she had him in her focus, her heart exploded with information about him. His presence pulled her in. She heard him say her name.
It was just the sort of entanglement of guilt and loathing that had Ash driving the town, going hours out of his way, looking for a soothing substitute. At the time, he’d had no choice but to finish his dinner with Foster, in bland conversation. He took revenge by enjoying the way Foster’s hair fell forward, like a woman’s when he bent over his stew. A very large and prim sort of woman. Of course, the well-formed masculinity peering out from Foster’s face, made him undeniably male, bold and hard where any female would be soft, and straight-edged where most women were rounded.
Draco choked on all the air that couldn’t exit his lungs fast enough. He’d held his breath, not realizing the pain collecting there. When he needed to breathe, he couldn’t. The sounds that came from his throat, terrified Lucius, who jumped up to lift him from the pillow. He pulled him forward and smacked him on his back.
Severus regarded his book. He closed it. “I will have to speak with him. I didn’t want to tell you in front of your parents or his, but your marriage contract itemizes the very ways in which your magic interprets betrayal to you. To it, he’s keeping so many important things from his husband. His dishonesty was first on the list. The contract is still intact because the sanctity of your marriage does not feel threatened. However, these are recorded as warnings, for you to correct. No doubt, the dragon is Draco’s warning against betrayal to his investments, equally.
Those same crazy fears started to jab under his skin. He’d be damned if he was going to lie here stewing in his own hell. If someone didn’t come and tell him what was going on in ten minutes, he’d start yelling.
Harry tuned the rest of it out in favor of going to the bed and pulling the flat object out of Draco’s mouth. He couldn’t tell if the fit was over on its own, or because of the bind. Draco looked tense, as if he were still fighting something, whether his body could express it or not.
“I tried, but I guess I didn’t try hard enough, because I don’t believe that anything can fix those boys. Like I said, it’s not a counter curse. That sixth wand is just something we threw in, to give a desperate man hope.”
“They don’t care. They don’t take anything I want seriously. Go ahead, tell them. I’ll just walk out that much faster.”
If he strained, tilted his head and blinked through the haziness of her logic, it made a little sense.
“Do you understand what I’m telling you? This is hard enough as it is. If you don’t cooperate and sign a sample over, then we have to document your refusal. We have to film everything, which could be played back to a jury in a court of law.”
The more loving her tone became, the more he resisted it. It made him hate himself for all the risks he and Harry had taken when it came to sex. After seeing Iece’s birth, he’d gone out of his way to find a method for keeping himself from ever getting pregnant. Not because he intended to have sex that way, but because he knew he couldn’t say no if Harry wanted it. Holding him was sometimes the only way to get through to him. Sex was too critical a language between them, to ever think he could just resist giving in. He couldn’t rely on muggle technology or wizarding craft to ensure what he needed. So he’d turned to lesser known, experimental means. Hybrid technology. Multiple methods. He took maintenance potions and a “flush” pill every two weeks. It was designed to stop any cell division and cleanse the fertilized object from the body without going noticed.
Harry had already been irreversibly affected by a fourth-year Ravenclaw who confided resenting her mother’s choice to have her ears pierced before she could speak. Now she was a person who didn’t like the weight of jewelry and had to walk around with two extra holes in her head, all because her mother was following a cool trend. If they saw a baby in a stroller with pierced ears, Harry would always remark out of earshot of the parent, “I’d never do that to my daughter.” It was one of Harry’s favorite go-to observations whenever life allowed them to enjoy public errands together. It was a chance to people-watch and forget how they were forever on the stage of someone else’s entertainment.
Narcissa slept with her satin mask on and her earplugs spelled to twice their blocking capability. He had never adapted to sleeping in such uncomfortable headgear, so he glared at her in the dark.
She looked skeptical. She had met Kreacher upon running errands and reported her dislike of the rude bigoted, elf right away. “If Jipsy is to clean properly, she is to be put in charge.”
She hid her hurt feelings and smiled at him bravely. She was used to people underestimating her tastes. Some of those artists had excellent voices and their songs were really beautiful. Give her time. She conquered Harry, she’d conquer him.
“Nothing. They know about Harry the same way everyone else does. Newspapers. Media. Hell, Voldemort used Harry’s name to negotiate resources. You know as well as I do that he dreamt of quantifying Harry’s magic and dangling it in front of his enemies. He started it. He wanted to sell Harry to these people, in exchange for a seat at the table where world economics are played like chess. The only problem was, he wanted Harry for himself. He was the one who first started saying he could give them the boy. You don’t know these creatures. They look like people and we call them people, but they’re not. They took one whiff of Harry’s magic, as it lingered on Voldemort after he’d defended himself, and they decided that he was worth acquiring. They have uses for magic like that.
“We’re awake, outside of time, outside of limitation. That’s everything. I don’t want to go back to sleep, convinced I’m just a kid who can’t make any difference in the world. Convinced I can’t have you. It’s been adventurous, to say the least. But it’s also been painful as hell and we poison our world when we bring it back with us. There’s no reason to put ourselves through that anymore. So what, if the world is asleep and can’t accept a universe of happiness and everything given through magic. I won’t deny us, just because a reality full of people don’t think this is real. I won’t deny myself, just because others haven’t figured it out. Haven’t woken up. If we tried to explain this, they’d call us insane. So screw them. Let’s take our happiness and run. Let’s build a fortress in that world, where we can have a child, and keep everyone out.”
“He’s a free wizard, he got himself out of it. Everyone has a past. Where would any of us be if we can’t be forgiven for mistakes?”
Lucius retaliated. “What female would you trust to be that close to our son and not produce an unwanted heir with her advantage? These are witches, who know their way around the potency of a man’s sperm, not some muggle debutantes waiting for one perfect day of wedding bliss to make them complete. Draco’s essence is not to be taken for granted or allowed to escape him until he’s done his duty to our family. And even then, he’d be wise to use his husband for such relief instead of wasting himself on the risk of illegitimate children. Better he accepts his constraints now than try to outrun them later.”
Greg finally looked as if he’d heard something Harry said. “Holy shit. I get it. You’re stressed out. Look man, I’m not hear to make things worse. You’re right, I have no idea what you’re going through right now. But I do want to be a friend, not a jerk. Not an enemy. I’ve seen what you can do and I want you on my side.”
“Sir, you are asking me to relinquish my firstborn to a wizard who would spoil him for any other, and not ask for recompense against such irreversible damage. All I’m asking for is a grandchild. If one is not presented in a year’s time, we will be equipped with enough information to ask for a Write of Annulment, or proceed to more drastic arrangements. If not, the uncertainty could drag out indefinitely. Do not waste my time with ideologies of privacy. Once business is taken care of, the two shall have all the privacy they require. I’m not signing him over, otherwise.”
“Here we are.” He gestured to storage boxes that they were meant to sit on. Behind him, his workspace consisted of a laptop, an intercom, and files balanced magically on top of steel cabinets. As a wizard, he could’ve created the illusion of more space and appropriate surroundings, but his make-shift space only confirmed that his greatest attention had been reserved for their daughter.
The more Draco tried to hold his patronis together, the more he felt drained. His rage was gone, and the assertion he used to maintain it, exhausted him. He let go, as if having the last of it wrested from his grip. His body actually jerked forward in his chair, as Harry pulled on the link to his patronus until nothing more came from it. Draco leaned forward, clearly nauseated by the effort. They all thought he was going to be sick, and Narcicssa was the first to rush to his side.
He shook Harry’s hand. “Well, Mr. Potter, it is a pleasant surprise to see you, even if it was not by appointment or design.”
It would've been nice if Reuse behaved, even a little, as if Ash were her employer, and not Foster. He thought about being a smartass and throwing the question over his shoulders, "And what are his wages like?" But he knew he was only taking his frustration out on her. Far more pressing matters awaited him in the basement.

But he needed a moment. He had to figure out what all this meant. He had to brace himself. If Draco didn’t wake up and talk to him, how could he know what to do?
The sound of splintering wood and a loud bang, made her scream again. She turned in time to see Emerald’s contorted limbs bursting through the lower panel of a storage closet. The girl rolled, sirt over head onto the carpet, where her body landed a meter from Petunia. Emerald bounced up before she could say a word. Missing one shoe and limping, she tripped over an old fashioned carpet sweeper that had fallen out with her. She offered an apologetic smile, looked longingly at Draco, and said, “He’s pretty!” before taking off after the others.
Downstairs, they all tiptoed past the formal rooms where conversation had died to hushed whispers. People were steadily eating cake and watching the Potters elude conversation. By now, the air bristled with hidden information and Lily could only guess that no one was really complaining because they all wanted to stay and see how it all turned out. Of course, her mother must’ve made announcements, must’ve asked everyone to bear with them. The older generations understood the temperament of adaptive marital magic, than the rest. But children had to be fed and distracted. Emerald and Dudley, along with some of the older cousins, were doing a great job of making a play room. Blankets and sleeping bags were already being amassed for a second sleepover.
Todrick folded his arms. "Your blood would indeed be a valuable acquisition. I cannot make the decision alone. My superiors must vote on this matter. Do you understand what you're offering? You are willing to sign over one blood-pint of your magic? While your blood would be useless to those without knowledge, we goblins have the means to extract your power from it. This is a transference of magical power. It will lie within our assets and be used as we see fit. Is the answer that you seek really worth it?"
By now, her wand looked like twisted plaits of hair hardened into a crooked stick. It splintered where raised, matted fibers clumped and stuck out of it. Otherwise, it looked like she’d dipped it into black lacquer and it gleamed faintly to his investigative eyes. Her magic was definitely unique, taking forms that were more interesting than aesthetically appealing.
“Your daughter deserves your self-preservation. She deserves her father in her life, not in prison. Draco deserves it. Speak up for yourself, Harry. A wizard’s blood drenches the streets. Your attack was witnessed by too many people to obliviate, and that number is still growing as they use their contraptions to replicate and share those images over and over again all over the world. Our muggle contacts say that yours and Lucius’s faces will be on T-shirts and mugs before the week is out. I’m no fan of his, but I don’t want you going to prison over him. You must defend yourself. Give me something I can understand. Did he threaten you? Did he threaten your child? Why would you disregard him for over two years, only to turn your fury on him today? The Smallest whisper from you will carry more weight than any vat of lies he can come up with. You’ll have to receive punishment, but telling me your side of it right now, no matter what the legal repercussions, could be all the difference between probation and years in Azkaban. What did he do?”
He’d only been asleep for two hours, but that was enough to recharge him. He had a problem to lick and he was close. He’d been comparing the Potter child’s blood and magic scans on the hour, watching for fluctuations. He’d missed the shift change, that gave him a new set of staff to work with. He knew all of them, so it shouldn’t have been a problem, to have his instructions followed by a completely different assistant. But one glance at his desk, where the samples should’ve been, told him that his wishes had not translated to the morning staff.
Draco confessed to having already hired bodyguards to keep themselves hidden. Harry forgave his lack of faith. He admitted that he hadn’t given him a whole lot to believe in. His track record was terrible, but he refused to fight about it on the cusp of finding Snape. He gave in. If this is what Draco needed to help him feel better about things, then so be it. He trusted him. “Okay.”
Harry appreciated that. He’d grown up with Ron and Hermione, and met Blaise in grade school. They were the closest friends he had. She’d graduated from a Wizarding education system, but started her teaching intern at the local muggle university. Ron had his own business repairing muggle cars with magic, and Blaise ran his family’s “winery,” which specialized in recreational potions. He had a bottle with him now.
Narcissa slept with her satin mask on and her earplugs spelled to twice their blocking capability. He had never adapted to sleeping in such uncomfortable headgear, so he glared at her in the dark.
When Harry's hands got responses from Draco that shook the bed, he understood that it was real. Draco had somehow willed his body to be what he thought Harry wanted. That sacrifice was meant to get Harry back to a place where it was okay to take that much pleasure in his body. Instead of simply letting his instincts take over, Harry had the lights up, covers thrown back, and held Draco at wand-point, demanding to know what evil trick it was. His grip hurt Draco's pride more than it hurt him physically.
"What if I can pay with magic? What if I can pay twice as much as the loss that you would incur? I don't know how you quantify magic, but if Goblins are keeping score, then that would have to protect you. And you wouldn't even have to tell me if Snape was still alive. Just tell me who's in this box."
If he saw Harry, he made no indication. The view was merely a window, not a real portal. And Harry could not be sure that it was even in real time. For all he knew, a conglomeration of imagination and memories, composed of his desire to do serious harm to Lucius, created what he saw. A real Portal Charm took time and dedication to learn. The one wizard who performed it in front of him, the night the school had been overrun with Death Eaters, had left him aching to have that kind of ability at his disposal. There’d been no time to learn after that, and no one to teach him. His pace of life, with Draco and a growing daughter, kept him moving farther and farther away from such interests. Now, the demand for it, the need for it, had him reckless to use everything he thought he knew about it.
He looked at the door as all of them tripped over a gibberish of excuses. “How long has he been in there?”
“That’s exactly what I’m afraid of. I can’t do that to Harry. How is it supposed to work, anyway? How does it help her?”
Snape saw his memories, distorted as they were. He knew that Harry was deliberately causing himself to focus on the worst of what Lucius had done to him, in order to maintain his fury and energy. He was trying to make himself kill him, because it wasn’t coming naturally or easily.
Draco moved away from the column. He smoothed his robe smartly, ready to take back his authority and his party. Pausing, he turned his gaze down to the terrace below.
“Language, dear. You wouldn’t want to misrepresent your upbringing with poor manners. My point is, we all ask for things in the privacy of our hearts. Call it a different name, it’s still the same thing. You must’ve asked for Harry to figure himself out. To figure his life out and finally be done with all the things haunting him. There must’ve been times when you didn’t know how to get through to him, but you wanted him to be done with his pain so badly. Every cell in your body understands what you want for your little family, and your body let you get pregnant at the worst of times because you were asking so powerfully for help with all of that. I’m a mother, I can see it because I know it. I’ve stood where you are, minus the lack of support and goodness knows what, that you’ve been living all these years.”
“That brings us to the third and most concrete of the problems. I see it but I don’t know what it is.”
Harry continued holding Draco’s hand and ignored anything that wasn’t in his direct line of sight. He knew his parents were arguing, but that wasn’t going to wake Draco up, now was it? Sirius and Remus were trying to comfort him, but the most he could muster for them was polite silence. He kinda wished they’d leave and give him privacy. To hell with Narcissa’s distrust. The only reason he wasn’t holding Draco right now, was because he was afraid of doing more damage to his skin. But the way that skin had torn, he was scared to witness any more atrophy in Draco, alone. His mood both repelled company and sought it at the same time.
It was settled then. The courtship was now active and valid. Normally the meeting would’ve dispersed, and the Malfoys would’ve been treated to a dinner celebration. Letters detailing the first outing between the couple would follow. But Lucius Malfoy did not seem satisfied with Harry’s renegade checkmate. He withheld his signature as everyone waited on him.
