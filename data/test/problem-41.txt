thinking.” Harry replied. “But we can talk about it after coffee.” He kissed Draco again, then reached for his hand. He intertwined their fingers then moved the back of Draco’s hand downwards until it was pressed against Harry’s now aching cock. Draco really was too sexy for his own good. “Maybe after this?” he added with a wink.
“Self depreciation won’t help you here Harry.” she scolded. “Look.” she took his hand in his. “I know it was frustrating there Harry, but things are changing. They are getting better. Kingsley’s doing a good job, if we just keep going then-”
Perhaps he had found something to think about.
“So needy Potter. Look at you, already so hard for me.” Harry whined slightly as Malfoy pulled an earlobe with his teeth. “I’m surprised you didn’t crawl under the table at dinner the way you were undressing me with your eyes.”
“Merlin can you be serious for just one second!”
“On the floor?” Ron asked quizzically, almost like he was intentionally trying to wind him up.
He pictured Malfoy arriving unexpectedly, catching Harry touching himself exactly as he was now. He imagined the wry smile, he imagined the man stalking towards him and straddling him. Fantasy Malfoy was silent, although Harry expected the man himself wouldn’t be able to resist making some sort of barbed comment.
“I thought you were complimenting me for actually taking the time to think about my life, but now I see it was a ruse to grill me about work.” Harry teased.
Draco smiled and kicked off into the air once more.
“Oh it’s Draco now is it?” Andromeda asked, eyebrows raised.
He put his plate of toast on the bench next to him, casting a small statis charm to keep it warm and crunchy, then he reached for the pile of post he’d brought out with him. Artimus must be asleep somewhere.
“Oh you did, did you?” she enquired.
“You fancy him!” Teddy teased. “You
Of course there was no one in sight. He hadn’t really expected Stefano to be waiting outside. He pulled out his coin to ask Stefano where to head to, but there was already a message waiting for him.
He lit the joint, took a long drag, and slowly began touching himself through his jeans. A subtle warmth spread through his body and he sighed at the sensation. It would be better if Malfoy was here.
All in all, he didn’t think he’d be the best dinner party guest. But he’d dragged himself into the shower anyway, determined to put on a brave face. His school friends had been getting together for a Christmas meal every year since the war and he wasn't about to cancel on them now.
It was frightening, when he thought about it. They were still getting to know each other, but Harry saw so much potential. Draco had made time for Harry over the past month and he’d seem to enjoy their time together, but really Harry had no idea how seriously Draco felt about him. In the past, this wouldn’t have normally bothered Harry. If he was enjoying himself then what was the rush, he’d think. But now, reflecting on Hermione’s wise words to stop and take the time to think, he realised that just enjoying himself wasn’t enough for him this time around. He didn’t know where things would go with Draco, but for the first time in a while he found himself wanting to commit, to take control of their fledgling relationship rather than just have it in the back of his mind as an afterthought. And if he wanted to find out whether Draco felt the same, well, he’d just have to ask him.
“What gave it away?” Harry asked wryly.
“Fuck!” Malfoy was pressing a lubed finger into him now and Harry felt sweat dripping down his face as it lay turned to the side against his crossed arms. He had no idea when Malfoy had conjured lube and he didn’t care, the feeling of the man’s tongue and thick fingers had left him incapable of thinking straight.
“It makes sense.” Teddy replied after a moment. “You’re both the same age, you’re both gay.” A sly smile lit up his face. “And he’s
“Yes I was. Only in the morning though. We usually have matches in the evenings on Wednesdays but this week is a slip week.”
Malfoy looked at him, expression piercing. “I’m sure I don’t need to explain to you of all people, that I was a little, how to put this,
"Thanks." Neville was familiar with Harry’s struggles with sleep ever since Harry had approached him a few years back asking about medicinal remedies. It was all above board, but Neville had become his de facto supplier. Harry grinned at the fact that he’d simultaneously been offered a filthy night out, and the wizarding equivalent of herbal soothers.
“Not that I’m complaining, but where did this come from?” Harry asked breathlessly, the twin sensation of Malfoy’s mouth on his neck and his hands on Harry’s arse sending him wild.
“We were-” he started, but then trailed off, he was still strongly tempted just to apparate away. “Why are you wearing a jumper that says ‘Jingle My Bells’? Can’t Rose read pretty well now?” he asked, aiming to distract Ron from the fact that he'd almost witnessed his best friend giving an enthusiastic blowjob.
When Harry awoke the next morning, Draco was still fast asleep. He looked relaxed in a way that Harry had not yet witnessed, and Harry decided that he rather liked it. Draco was always so put together, so striking, so in control, that seeing him like this, hair mussed, breathing deeply, Harry was almost overwhelmed by the feeling of tenderness, of wanting to care for him. Merlin he had it bad.
When he looked back Luna’s expression was sad. She looked hurt. Merlin he was such a dickhead.
There, at the top of the page, was a photo of Malfoy outside of a large residential property. The headline informed him that it was from a charity event that had taken place the night before. That didn’t bother him. What bothered him was who Malfoy was with. On Malfoy’s arm was a tall brunette who Harry vaguely recognised from the Scottish quidditch league, Rory something. The man was leaning into Malfoy slightly, and they were both smiling for the camera. Malfoy turned to say something to Rory who then playfully pushed Malfoy. Harry watched the loop three times before he realised that the corner of the page was smoking.
“Oh baby, look how needy you are already.” Draco breathed. He kissed Harry again, harder this time, running his tongue across the seam of Harry’s lips as he pushed his hips forward, once. The soft slide of his cock against Harry’s felt incredible, but it was over too quickly. “Were you thinking about this before I woke up?” Draco questioned.
Harry reflected momentarily that no, he didn’t, not really. Of course he’d been fourteen once, but he was fairly confident in saying that his experience hadn’t been particularly normal. He knew Teddy though, and he privately agreed with Andromeda. The boy was far more interested in friends and quidditch than baking, but he cared about his Gran, so perhaps he would listen.
dated a handful of quidditch players. They were always so energetic in bed.
They must have had a shield charm woven into their cloak. There was no way anyone could have kept a wandless potego going for that long. It was uncommon but not improbable, his own uniform had the same protections after all. How could he have overlooked it?
Harry didn’t reply. The man had a point he supposed. They hadn’t exactly spoken much.
He was systematically sorting through the kitchen cupboards in an increasingly desperate search for a hangover potion when he was assaulted with a loud 'Uncle Harry!' as tiny arms wrapped themselves around his legs.
Harry arrived outside of the Falcons stadium with ten minutes to spare. It was unassuming from where he stood, but Harry knew from experience that the wizarding space inside seated thousands of fans. It felt a little creepy being here on a Thursday with no one around apart from the occasional grounds staff, but he made his way through the main entrance to the pitch without much bother.
“Well-” Harry started. “We’ve kind of already been out, I mean, yesterday was out. But yes, I wanted to check in with you, whether you thought this might be going somewhere.” He looked up hopefully. “I’ve had a good time over the last few weeks, I think, I think we’re good together.”
“Harry.” she sighed. “Of course I know what the department is like. I’ve heard enough from you over the years, and you know I have similar challenges. It took them nearly eight years to change the racist name of the department for fuck’s sake.”
“I will.” he agreed.
Harry glared at her before remembering that he was, of course, wearing sunglasses.
“Okay, okay, sorry. Just, I don’t understand. Does she want to hire me? Do they even have any positions open at the moment? Why didn’t she mention a subject? Am I not a bit young to be a teacher? Would it be weird if I have to teach Teddy? Is that even allowed?” What if-”
Draco was unpacking what looked like a mountain of brooms onto the frosty grass and Teddy was learning over him, mouth open in stunned silence. Harry smiled. It had been a while since he’d seen Teddy act with such childlike excitement. He was generally a happy teenager, but since they’d arrived at the Falcons stadium that morning he hadn’t stopped grinning. It reminded Harry of Rose when he took the kids to Fortescue’s.
Teddy put the shoes back in their box, looking around to make sure they hadn’t left anything. “Okay let's go and buy these, and then I’d like to get a hot chocolate and you can get a mulled wine or something grown up to take your mind off Draco. I’m sure he’ll reply.”
His house was quiet but warm, the fire still crackling merrily in the harth. He didn’t have a Christmas tree up yet, but something about the fire felt seasonal. He crossed the living room to the small bar he had set up in the corner and poured himself a whisky before setting up some music to play in the background.
So I missed my January, deadline - but we're almost there! Thank you so much to everyone who has followed this story so far. It's my first experience of posting chapters as I write them, and while I completely failed at staying on track with a daily posting schedule (sorry!), I've really enjoyed reading your comments and getting kudos notifications along the way. It's really helped me to stay motivated!
“Hi Rose.” Harry replied, taking in the scene in front of him. “You guys look adorable. Are you wearing matching Christmas socks?”
"Also they definitely did more than just go to that event together. You can just tell." Harry said petulantly.
“Are you asking me out?”
Hours later the party was wrapping up, the last few remaining guests either putting on coats or refreshing warming charms.
“I’ll think about it. I hadn’t really thought of doing something like that before.” He put his hands in the pockets of his coat. “McGonagall wrote to me about teaching, so that’s the only thing I’ve considered so far. But I’m taking my time.”
The sight of the Hogwarts castle towering over the snow-covered grounds never failed to take Harry’s breath away. The sun was low in the sky but Harry’s entire vista was bright, the snow almost sparkling in the fading light. He refreshed his warming charm and marched through the gates, the snow crunching loudly under his feet.
He glanced down at the Thames below him, inky and ominous in the December evening. Even he wasn’t going to attempt an incarcerous on an assailant in the middle of a high-speed chase. His hands were frozen anyway, he’d probably drop his wand.
“Thanks.” Harry replied, genuinely. “Maybe it’s in my future, maybe it’s not. I think perhaps not straight away. Something Malfoy said last night actually got me thinking. He said something about consulting. Wards, security, that kind of thing.”
“Don’t let George hear you say that. He’ll convert your shares into pixie dust or something.”
Harry looked down at the covers as he felt Malfoy’s warm, hard cock press against him, and then he was pushing back against the man as Malfoy held perfectly still.
The made out for a while, the ebb and flow of power translated through strong hands, passionate kisses, breathy moans. Harry was completely captivated, pleasure rushing through his body as they entwined.
“Nope.” Harry replied. “We actually talked, like all evening. He kissed me goodnight outside the restaurant, but no tongues.”
"Not really, I'm more tired than anything. I haven't been sleeping well since-" Harry paused. Thinking about it now he honestly couldn't remember the last time he hadn't got home late and then woken much too soon to the familiar sense of dread at the idea of putting on his uniform. “Not since ages." he concluded.
“We knew each other at school!” Harry protested.
Ron continued to stare at him, eyebrows raised. “Have you replaced your coffee machine yet Harry? “ he asked pointedly.
Harry gritted his teeth. They were getting closer to central London now and he really didn’t want to risk a wand fight over such a populated area. He doubted Magical Accidents and Catastrophes could claim late Diwali celebrations - even Bonfire Night had been weeks ago.
“But I don’t know if I want to teach. I’ve never even thought about it!” Actually that wasn’t completely untrue. He’d considered it for a while after the war, back when Dumbledore’s Army was still fresh in his mind. But then he’d joined the Aurors and well, the rest was history.
"Ron, what the hell is is that?" Harry asked pointing at the mug on the Burrow’s kitchen countertop.
“Yeh that’s it Potter. Make yourself come. I want to feel you come on my cock.”
Draco continued his relentless assault on Harry’s prostate and Harry gave up on even attempting to sound dignified. Then he put his mouth back on Harry’s balls and from then on it was simply a matter of time. Pleasure swirled throughout his body, the duel sensation from his arse and his balls causing his dick to bounce against nothing. Harry didn’t have to be told to keep his hands away, he could tell Draco wouldn’t want him to touch himself.
“What are you doing?” Teddy appeared at his side, his hair a bright cobalt blue today.
Malfoy’s eyes darkened and he crossed the room to where Harry was leaning against the doorframe. He looked intently into Harry’s eyes, as if checking for something, but whatever he was looking for he obviously found as the next minute Harry found himself crowded against the door, Malfoy kissing him slowly.
“Another?” he heard Malfoy ask and he nodded into his arms.
Harry laughed. “I know it’s wonky. Maybe next year it’ll be taller!” He grabbed a handful of floo powder. “Right. I’ll see you soon, and next time we can-”
“That’s it Potter. Fuck yourself on me.”
“Shall we?” Harry asked.
a hooking up, Potter. Forgive me, but you’d just quit your job and you’d been dumped, I didn’t expect that you were looking for much more than a rebound. I saw you scanning the dancefloor that night, don’t pretend you weren’t. I thought that if you weren’t going home alone, then I should at least offer. After all, you were the one that agreed.”
“So I should meet with her?” he asked.
“Hermione tells me that Hogwarts might feature in your future though. Have you owled McGonagall yet?”
“You what?” Ron asked.
Ron looked smug. “Let your new coffee machine be a monument to your stupidity.”
“Ha not quite. I think I’ve spent more time with Teddy and Rose and Hugo than I have in the past year put together. Hermione’s kids.” he added, on seeing Malfoy’s confused expression.
“I’m here for work actually.” he answered, skimming over the question of how he was feeling. “I wondered if you could help?”
They were so close, Malfoy’s other hand now resting on the small of Harry’s back. Then, in lieu of an answer, Malfoy was kissing him. It was a deep, open-mouthed kiss that made Harry’s stomach swoop and his knees feel weak. It was hot and wet and fantastic and overwhelming all at once, and Harry felt himself kissing back before he even had time to consciously process what was happening. Malfoy pressed a leg between Harry’s thighs and Harry groaned. He deepened the kiss, touching Malfoy’s tongue with his own. He heard the other man sigh but then Malfoy was pulling away, biting Harry’s lip gently before placing a kiss on his cheek and standing back.
McGonagall fixed him with a stern expression. “You may have moved on from the Aurors but you have a wealth of experience that the older children could indeed benefit from. I expect you’ll be able to keep their attention too, given that I believe you are now a major focus of the Modern Magical History course.”
Harry laughed. “I could have done with one of those the other night. Kingsley insisted I go to Tuesday’s Ministry Gala.”
“Yeh.” Harry replied. “Just, I think my S-H-I-T-T-Y life is back to normal.” he spelled out.
As always, all mistakes are mine. Thanks for sticking with this story. Hopefully you'll forgive my shameless delays with this chapter!
“Oh no what a shame!”
“Sex really knocks you out doesn’t it?” Malfoy laughed.
“Yes!” Draco cheered. He looked genuinely delighted for someone who surely did this most weeks. Harry couldn’t help but smile too. Teddy was clapping and Harry was momentarily surprised to see him at all. He’d forgotten there were three of them in the game. Draco flew to meet them, the snitch still tightly pressed in his fist. As Draco reached them, Harry grabbed him around the waist, adrenaline and affection rushing through his body.
He felt Malfoy press deep inside him and then the other man was coming too, his cock throbbing.
“At teaching?”
Seven, tomorrow, Harry thought with a grin. He could wait until then.
“I know you wish I could tough it out with you, I just can’t stay Hermione, it’s too much.”
“Uncle Draco, can I try this one?” Teddy interrupted. He was holding a highly polished broom with a slightly longer than average tail.
He led the way, and if he sashayed his hips slightly while climbing the stairs, well, who was to know. He knew his arse looked pretty good in these jeans.
Harry tried and failed to fight his body’s natural response to blush. This was happening way too often.
Harry looked down at the hot chocolate, hot shame sweeping through his body. “I shouldn’t have said what I said, I apologised.” he replied.
"Why is swirly cake Christmassy mummy?" Rose was asking a tired looking Hermione. She hadn’t been drinking the night before, but she did look like she was running on limited sleep.
“Wha-” Harry began to protest, but then Malfoy was swallowing down his cock and all coherent thought left his brain. Malfoy set a punishing pace and Harry groaned shamelessly as Malfoy bobbed his head up and down. “Ngh, fuck! Malfoy!”
It was moments like this Harry was glad he hit the gym most mornings. His own thighs were screaming in protest but evidently the pursuit was taking it out of the figure ahead of him more quickly. Just a bit further, then he could clock off and head home. He carefully uncurled a frozen hand from the handle of his broom and reached for the portkey - standard issue for situations where anti-apparation wards weren’t possible or practical.
“Hi Luna.”
“Not at all. I’d like to. He’s been hassling me for years to have a go on my Auror one and I feel a little guilty that I’ve rather messed up my promise to let him have a go once he turns fifteen.”
He was awoken from his daydreams by the sound of Hermione clearing her throat. “Harry.”
This time they were out for longer. It was funny thinking back to his first go on his own Firebolt. At the time it had seemed unsurpassable in speed and control, but even now, as he tailed Draco, he could feel the difference between this and the Cleansweep he’d just tried. The Firebolt didn’t feel slow, but it was evident that broom design had moved on since his Hogwarts days. Draco was elegant but dangerous, changing direction unpredictably and throwing gleeful glances over his shoulder ever time Harry fell out of sync. While Harry had started out aiming to win, his strategy had soon shifted to one that didn’t end up with him embarrassing himself. Harry was sweating just trying to keep up with Draco despite the fact that he was riding a much better broom.
before dinner. He’d even had to strengthen the wards on his house after he was concerned that the sheer quantity of owls that were arriving would somehow negate his existing protections. It hadn’t been this bad since he’d been papped kissing a distinctly male companion a couple of years out of Hogwarts.
“That will be alright, won’t it Harry?” she asked earnestly.
Malfoy grinned in agreement.
“No I know, I know. He’s just so composed, and I’m-” He let the sentence hang. He knew Ron would understand what he wasn’t saying.
Today, however,
behind him as the wind whipped through his hair.
“Alright there Potter?” he teased, a wry grin on his face as if he knew exactly what Harry had been thinking.
"Thank you Luna, that would be really kind."
He heard the singsong voice of Hermione enter the room. "Sometimes grownups do silly things like wearing sunglasses inside when they're feeling funny, don't they Uncle Harry?"
Harry levitated the tree into position, spinning it mid-air so that the most even branches faced outwards. He would decorate it later, but this way the smell of pine could permeate the room. Now it felt like Christmas, he thought with satisfaction.
“Ah that makes sense. I realise that I didn’t quite get round to asking you about how it was all going the last time we met.”
“Something amusing Mr Potter?” McGonagall’s sharp Scottish accent pulled him back to the present. He hadn’t noticed her arrive.
Harry wiped the water from his eyes and helped pull Draco up into a standing position.
Draco was the one to break the silence. He nodded in Ron’s direction. “Weasley.”
He felt Draco’s body tense. “Oh really?” he drawled, releasing his hand from Harry’s and instead gripping both of their cocks in his fist. He held his hand still, but Harry moaned in anticipation.
As the evening wore on, Harry felt himself falling more and more for the man. Yes they had physical chemistry, and yes there was this playful banter between them, but as they talked more about their life, their careers, their families, Harry found even more he liked about the man.
“I saw a picture in the paper this morning. He was at some fancy event last night with that Scottish quidditch player. Rory something. They were all over each other.”
Harry barely had the energy to agree. All he could think about was sleep, and maybe next time.
“I won’t.” Harry replied.
“Yeh I think so. Hogwarts was a long time ago, but I don’t think it would be healthy to ignore it.” Harry had long since accepted that the impact of the war wasn’t something he could avoid with the people he cared about.
She’d decorated her extensive garden with fairy lights of all different colours. They were strung between trees, they adorned the giant fir tree off to one side, and they clustered together in large spheres hovering just above the grass. Altogether it gave the garden a pleasant glow, even Harry privately thought that from a distance it looked a little bit like the Blackpool Illuminations.
Every year in the run up to Christmas Harry and Teddy spent a day in muggle London together. Harry had initially chosen muggle London to steer clear of Diagon Alley in the years immediately following the war, back when the crowds of people swarming around him made him fear for Teddy’s safety. Today strangers in the wizarding world were more of an annoyance than anything more sinister, but the tradition had stuck. When Teddy was younger they’d visited the museums, spent hours in Hamley’s and visited the different Christmas lights dotted around the capital. Now he was a teenager, their time seemed to mostly be spent in shops selling clothes or trainers.
“Oh swearing! Lucky the kids aren’t around.” He joked.
Harry shivered as the cool air hit his skin, but was immediately distracted by the sight of Malfoy’s cock. His mouth watered.
Both letters were of similar size, with no discernible identifying features. He’d had extensive wards in place since just after the war so he wasn’t concerned that either could be suspicious or dangerous, but he was curious as to who might be writing to him.
“On time. Well colour me impressed Potter.” Malfoy drawled, placing a kiss on Harry’s cheek.
He stood up and was met with a quizzical expression. “You sure you’re alright?” Ron asked. When had he become so intuitive.
“Yes?” He replied cautiously.
"No, but-"
“Good choice on the wine by the way. I like this vintage. Elf made wine is always excellent but some years it is truly magnificent.”
“Good evening.” Malfoy stood on the doorstep, illuminated by a nearby street lamp. He was wearing a long coat and holding what Harry presumed was a very nice bottle of wine.
He couldn’t really picture it yet, but Hogwarts was one of the places he loved most in the world. It was definitely worth considering.
He'd always struggled with taking control. Hermione argued that this was understandable given his childhood experiences, but it didn't stop the tendrils of shame twisting their way through his belly when he thought about the years and years where he'd found himself blindly following a new leader down a career path which didn't make him happy.
“I’m not!” Harry insisted, but he could feel his cheeks colouring.
“Oh right, a way off then.”
He took a deep breath and stepped into the first shop, schooling his features into something that didn’t scream ‘I fucking hate my job’ before announcing himself. “Auror Potter, may I have a moment of your time please?”
Draco smiled. “And thank you to you too. He’s a great kid. Well, young man really. I can see you’ve been a good influence.”
Ron raised his eyebrows.
It seemed that Malfoy had had enough of teasing too and the other man start fucking him properly, hard and fast, just like Harry liked. He was hitting Harry’s prostate on almost every thrust and it felt like every nerve was on fire. Malfoy was breathing hard now, the relentless pace seemingly affecting him as much as it was affecting Harry.
"Ron there are children everywhere!" Harry whispered. Christmas day at the Burrow was always a loud affair, and in recent years the number of children had begun to rival the number of adults.
“Yeh well, sometimes you need a kick up the arse mate.” Ron shot back. “I didn’t realise you and Malfoy were official.”
Hermione looked at her watch. “You better. I did not spend all that time counselling you on your dating prospects only for you to keep him waiting!”
“If that’s okay?” he replied.
“Not yet Potter, I’m not done with you yet.” Then Malfoy was lifting Harry off his cock and pushing him backwards onto the bed.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “I keep forgetting I don’t have a coffee machine anymore.”
He opened his eyes and glanced up briefly. Malfoy had one arm on the back of the sofa, the other moving to push back Harry’s hair. He looked incredible, all toned abs and pale skin.
writes shit about me all the time anyway." Harry took a large sip of the whisky that had finally appeared in front of him.
“So wait, you’re telling me that you
“Good.” Draco replied. “I won’t be long.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but that’s a smart man you’ve got there.” Ron sounded surprised.
“It’s going quite well, thank you for asking.” Malfoy continued. “The training style is a little more intense than I’m used to, and it’s considerably colder than it usually is in Nice at this time of year, but the team is friendly. They’ve been very welcoming really.”
Internally cursing Ron and or Seamus and or Dean for his current predicament, he gingerly got out of bed and unsteadily made his way to his en suite.
His feet were carrying him in the direction of the apparition point even though he knew he’d get a bollocking on Monday if he went home now. Just before he arrived he looked up and realised he was outside Luna’s shop. She’d opened
Malfoy raised his glass in agreement. “I’m not saying that I won’t take you home. But I don’t fuck on the first date.
“You’re on.” Harry replied, already mentally switching into a competitive mindset.
“Not an Auror anymore.” Harry retorted.
“I think you’ll find that I’m worth sticking around for.” Malfoy whispered seductively, before deepening the kiss. Their tongues touched and Harry groaned into the other man’s mouth. He’d been half hard in the shower just thinking about Malfoy’s arrival, but he could feel himself harden fully in his jeans as they continued making out. Kissing Malfoy was so goddamn hot, Harry loved how the other man took control, hands tight on Harry’s hips, positioning him just so, allowing their bodies to press together sensually. Harry groaned again as Malfoy bit down hard on his lip but felt strong hands still his body as he tried to press himself more firmly against the other man.
“I’ll consider it.” He repeated.
Nothing to be ashamed of in the size department, Harry thought as ran his hands up Malfoy’s toned thighs.
Harry chuckled. “Too true.”
“Harry, you literally saved the world when you were seventeen.” Ron deadpanned.
“I’ll let you get to it.” Ron said with a wink.
Most of the people in the cavernous packing room had apparated instantly, but one grabbed a nearby broom and shot through the open door, their hooded robe whipping Harry’s cheek as they jettisoned past. He’d leapt into action, unshrinking his own broom from his auror pack and kicking off. He’d barely had time to activate his personal tracking charm, let alone summon his gloves. Well, he thought bitterly, fingers aching, it’s not like his superiors gave two shits about his frozen hands as they watched a small dot labelled Auror Potter track across the charmed map from the comfort of the briefing room.
"Wow Stefano feels like ages ago." Ron interjected.
When Harry awoke, he could immediately tell that it was late in the morning. He felt well rested for one, and there was a stillness outside that left him with the impression that London’s morning hustle and bustle was over.
Seamus sent about eight beers zooming in his direction. "Drown your sorrows Harry!"
Harry groaned at Draco’s term of endearment and then hot bitter semen was flooding his mouth. He held still, trying to swallow as much as possible. Draco was breathing heavily, and Harry almost missed the sound of the floo in the other room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry loved this kind of hook up. High energy, no teasing, one where he was sober enough to feel everything but drunk enough to dull the awkwardness of sleeping with a stranger - even if in this situation Malfoy wasn’t exactly a stranger.
“Of course!” Harry replied. “It’s a tradition.”
“I’m so glad you remembered darling.” she teased.
Harry felt his pleasure cresting and then he was coming, hard, pure sensation swooping through his body, his toes and fingertips tingling from the force of his orgasm. Malfoy stilled on top of him Harry felt him empty himself into Harry’s arse.
Personally Harry thought that was adorable.
“Last week
“Huh? Oh, no no. Just.. happened to be looking in that direction.” Harry managed to get out. He’d expected Malfoy to be here, that’s all. He’d thought he was being subtle but Andromeda’s raised eyebrows said otherwise. “These mince pies are delicious though.” he added, holding up his half-eaten one, his satisfaction at the topic change disappearing as he watched a large section of the crumbly pastry drop onto the floor.
Picking up his morning coffee, he cast a warming charm around him and went to sit on the bench outside the kitchen doors. The sky was blue but the air was crisp, the kind of December morning that Harry always enjoyed waking up to when he’d been at Hogwarts. He blew gently on the coffee, the steam momentarily fogging up his glasses.
“Harry!” Teddy’s voice echoed through the house. “Harry I’m here!”
He summoned his lube and began working one, then two fingers into himself. He was lucky the light was low because he was surely blushing under Malfoy’s intense gaze. Malfoy kept his eyes on him while he leisurely stroked his own cock.
Perhaps not so oblivious. He sighed again. “Yeh I’m fine. Just tired. Oh and Stefano dumped me last night which has made today just extra special for me.”
As reality returned to him he realised that he’d just wanked over Malfoy in the middle of the day, surrounded by gifts for his friends and family. Perhaps he should stop being such a weirdo and tell the man how he feels.
“Oh Merlin, yes, fuck, I’m going to come baby.” Draco moaned.
“Right.” Ron continued. “So you’re telling me that you pulled a guy on a night out, asked him over a couple of nights later, you barely talked, and now you’re upset because he's been photographed standing next to another man?”
“What kind of question is that Ron? Yes. He was literally round her the other night! Four nights ago in fact! And then he has time to turn around and fuck some other random quidditch player.” How was Ron not more angry? He hated Malfoy even more than he did when they were at school.
“Not at all Harry.” she replied politely. “Thank you for keeping Teddy occupied all day. He’s been talking nonstop about your trip tomorrow, and being completely honest-” she lowered her voice slightly, “-I was grateful for the break.”
Her little voice snapped him out of his malaise. It wouldn’t be fair on her to be moody now. He bent down to her level. “Because Ro Ro, Uncle Harry went for a run outside and he still needs to have a shower.”
Light pressure on his shoulder encouraged Harry to sink to his knees. Harry relished the wave of endorphins he felt at the gesture. How did Draco know exactly what he needed?
"Maybe." Harry relented.
“If Rose gets to fly, does that mean I can finally have a go on your Auror broom?” another voice joined in. Teddy. He must have just arrived.
“Harry! How are you? What brings you here?”
Harry shifted his weight onto his left arm and grabbed his cock, wanking furiously.
“Harry, it seems like you do care.”
Harry swallowed. He hadn’t really expected anything to come of their conversion earlier, but now that Malfoys breath was tickling his ear, his lips almost touching, Harry felt a jolt of desire swoop through his body. Why not? He was single. He didn’t have anything to do tomorrow.
“Harry.” Draco interrupted.
"Yeh sorry to hear that Harry. I liked Stefano. He always had something interesting to say." Neville added. "I’ve got a new crop of gillyweed if you needed it." he added knowingly. Their eyes met and Harry nodded.
“Maybe it’s like he said, he wants to date you. That’s what you want anyway, isn’t it?”
They started slowly, lathering each other in soap, taking the time to explore each other’s bodies. Draco washed Harry’s hair, his erection pressed gently against the small of Harry’s back. Harry’s own cock was untouched, but the mental image of them together, combined with the sensation of Draco gently pulling at his roots had him tingling with pleasure. Harry moaned as Draco moved his hands from his hair, over his shoulders, down his sides and over his lower back. Despite the warmth of the water, he shivered as Draco began to massage his arse and then moaned as he felt Draco’s drop to his knees. Harry pressed a hand against the shower wall and not a moment too soon as he felt Draco’s tongue push into him and very nearly lost the ability to stand up.
“Right this way my friend.”
“Flirting already Potter.” Malfoy teased. “You’re shameless. You haven’t even offered me a drink.”
But now here he was considering a new career path, and, when he lay in bed before going to sleep, his mind wandered to thoughts of what a future with Draco might look like.
“Tea is fine.” Draco said, pressing his body against Harry’s back and kissing him just below the ear. Harry shivered. “I can think of something else that I want though.”
“Busy night tonight?” he said to the tall bearded man behind the bar. He’d been here enough over the last few years to recognise him by sight, although for the life of him Harry couldn’t remember his name. He supposed he’d always been much more drunk than this.
“I don’t anticipate that McGonagall expects you to turn up to a meeting with her with a full year of classes already scheduled, Harry.” she replied dryly. “She’ll want to hear your questions.” She paused to take a sip of her coffee. “When I told you to take time to think about things Harry, I didn’t mean for you to always think about them by yourself. Part of taking time to think is taking time to talk things through.”
Draco chuckled. “No Potter. I didn’t not sponsor this event.” He paused. “Firstly, if I had, the evening wouldn’t be as sterile as this. And secondly, what on earth could I have to gain from sponsoring an event like this? I’m a professional quidditch player. What would I try and lobby for? I thought Aurors were supposed to be smart?”
Malfoy turned to look at him, a confused look on his face. “What?”
“Potter.” Malfoy said, stepping out of the floo. “I was a little surprised to receive your note, you don’t have a reputation for sticking around. Although opening it to read a scrawled
“You sound surprised.”
She’d help him settle on a midnight blue tuxedo, even arriving at his early to help him with the tailoring charms. She’d just raised her eyebrows knowingly when he’d asked her to spell it a bit tighter over his arse.
Malfoy just raised his eyebrows.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Ah err, I did. I maybe err vanished it. This morning.”
“No!” Harry said. “I mean, I err, I do, err, fancy him.” Harry managed to get out. “But you can’t write that!”
“Perhaps a course in the history and theory of security spells might be something you’d consider leading? I expect there’d be cause for a practical component too.”
“An hour!?” Teddy exclaimed. “I’m trying to be nice to you Harry but that’s really pathetic.” He grabbed a blank piece of parchment and Harry’s quill. Harry watched him with faint amusement as Teddy took a moment to think before writing
He took a bite of warm buttery toast, smiling to himself. He remembered their offer and thought back to that weekend. Spending time with Stefano felt like a lifetime ago. He supposed they’d never really been official, not really. Dirty weekends every few weeks did not a boyfriend make. If anything perhaps Harry had rushed into giving him that charmed coin, they’d barely known each other. In comparison, his memories with Draco over this past month were vivid with colour and emotion. The rush of excitement as he waited for Draco to arrive at his house, the flare of jealousy when he’d seen the paper that morning, the burning pleasure when they fucked. It felt more real than anything he’d had with Stefano, more real than anything he’d had in a long time.
“Have you come to help?” Ron shouted across the busy shop. He was carrying a stack of brightly coloured boxes which looked like they’d topple over at any moment. Harry carefully levitated the top few leaving Ron space to see where he was going.
Draco didn’t answer, instead he crooked his finger directly against Harry’s prostate.
“Do you think you’ll see him again?” Ron asked. They’d moved behind the counter and Harry was now less worried about them being overheard by loitering reporters.
Harry felt a smile tugging at his lips as the familiar swoop of adrenaline leveled out into sheer enjoyment. He truly loved flying. It had been a while since he’d flown for fun and he delighted in doing a few loops before catching up with Draco and Teddy. Draco was teaching Teddy how to adjust his grip for maximum speed so Harry took a moment to shamelessly ogle Draco’s arse. The man looked sinfully good in leggings. He looked forward to getting him out of them later.
“Look at you, you’re blushing!” Ron replied in lieu of an answer to his question.
Harry pulled his mind back to the present. Draco was busy Christmas shopping today and there was no use getting carried away.
Harry thought back to the pamphlets they’d received back in fifth year, this seemed a marked improvement and he found himself itching to tell Hermione. He hadn’t expected this.
“Merlin yes.” Harry replied, eyes closing in anticipation.
“Rose Weasley that is not a very nice thing to say. Now go and play with your brother. I’ll be there in a minute.” He looked at her, eyebrows raised until she turned and left the room again.
“Good. I think you should.” She picked up his empty mug and placed them on the side. “Now, tell me what happened with Malfoy?”
McGonagall looked at him appraisingly from across the desk, her face more lined, but her eyes just as sharp. “I had suspected that a full time role may not be suitable.” she replied. “However I have plans to expand the curriculum for our older students, to make it more personalised, if you will. I hope to set up a series of research tracks and project-based work, smaller seminars and the like, something to begin to link the world of academia and the wizarding world of work.”
“Daddy and Uncle Harry are just talking sweetie. Why don’t you go and play with Hugo for a bit. We won’t be long.”
“Mate, I know that you haven’t seen just the two of us in a while, but we also haven’t seen just the two of us without the kids for, I don’t know, about four months, so maybe you need to stop third-wheeling us!” Ron joked.
“Yeh.” Harry replied breathlessly, and pulled Draco into a kiss.
Harry arrived at the castle doors much warmer and slightly out of breath. He really must start exercising properly, he thought. Less than a month out of the Aurors and already his fitness was already shocking. Although, Draco
Ron was laughing, Neville was laughing, Dean was attempting to hover five shot glasses while struggling to pour a bottle of what looked like port, and Harry, in a moment of lucidity, thought about how grateful he was that they were all alive.
Harry sighed. "I suppose I should be glad the
Harry fought his compulsion to argue back. She was right, really. He had been vaguely considering taking someone home when Malfoy had joined him at the bar at the end of the night. They’d clearly both been up for it, so he’d just gone with it. He hadn’t really considered any of their history. Fuck, he hadn’t even noticed if Draco still had a scar from that horrible incident in the bathroom in sixth year. Fuck. Maybe Hermione had a point.
It was as if someone had hit him with a sobering charm. Even though it was Saturday night and he was drunk with his friends, Harry felt that telltale swoop of dread at the idea of going to work on Monday.
Ron led them through a magical barrier not unlike the one at Platform 9 ¾. “Stops anyone except staff.” Ron explained. “You’re an investor.” he added at Harry’s confused expression.
Harry didn’t reply, instead he took what he hoped was a casual sip of wine.
The only downside he could see was that although the air temperature was a comfortable twenty four degrees, they were still standing outside on the grass in December. It didn’t affect him too much but as he watched Hermione try and navigate back to where he was standing, he did feel a little sorry for anyone wearing high shoes. She was levitating their drinks and walking on tiptoes to avoid her heels sinking into the grass.
He smiled slightly, at least he’d left his mark.
He resurfaced from the fantasy to find Malfoy looking at him expectedly.
He downed the whole bottle in one go, removed his sunglasses and then chased after Rose as she ran into the living room. His stomach lurched horribly, the potion not quite having kicked in, but by the time he'd scooped her up and swung her in a big circle around his spacious living room he was feeling marginally better.
Whether it was the stress of the last two days or the lack of sleep, on hearing these words something inside him snapped. “Oh come on Luna, this happened yesterday! Can you give me a few days before you start this shit?” He’d always struggled to keep a hold on his temper and he didn’t think he could be blamed today.
Harry sighed. Ron was probably right. Tomorrow meant publicity, it meant starting to make career decisions, it meant getting his life on track. But today, well today it was Christmas, and the only things that mattered were family, festivities, and definitely Molly’s roast potatoes. He had his friends by his side, an absolutely filthy note from Draco in his pocket detailing all of the things he had planned for when they saw each other tomorrow, and all the time in the world to think about what the following year might bring.
“Oh am I?” Draco drawled. “We can’t have that.” He pulled a snitch out and held it up in front of them. “Seekers game?” he asked. “You, me and Teddy?”
He heard Malfoy chuckle as two fingers breached him. It burned slightly, but then that feeling mellowed into blissful pleasure, especially once Malfoy’s tongue began licking around his rim again. Merlin he might even come.
They were due to see each other on the twenty-third, in two days. That’s when they’d agreed to take Teddy flying. Draco had called in a favour and had managed to book the Falcons pitch for the three of them. Teddy was beside himself with excitement. Harry resolved to talk to Draco afterwards. He’d invite him over afterwards. Hopefully Draco felt that spark of opportunity too.
As always - all mistakes my own! Thanks for making it this far - Harry's getting there!
Teddy beamed up at Draco and Harry felt his heart warm. Draco was so good with him.
He was trying to decide whether to risk throwing the portkey or not when he felt a hot glow against the inside of his trouser pocket. A communication coin. The concept had stuck since DA and he’d got Hermione to make him a few more so that he could keep in touch with his closest friends and family. Ron and Hermione had some, Andromeda, Teddy, and recently, Stefano. He didn’t usually give them to boyfriends, but he’d pressed one into Stefano’s hand before they last said goodbye in Milan.
"Get the shot glasses Hermione!" Ron called.
While Teddy looked through the collection again, Harry felt Draco tug on his arm. He was holding two brooms, a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, and a Firebolt. Harry took a deep breath. “I thought we could make some new memories?” Draco asked gently, a touch of nerves in his voice.
“Harry.” she warned.
Harry shrugged. "After the week I've had, I'm not sure how much I really care. I mean how much worse can it get? The
Harry nodded, allowing himself to be dragged along by Teddy’s enthusiasm. Not for the first time he wondered just when the baby he’d held in his arms had grown up.
Harry was mentally cataloguing the outfits in his wardrobe upstairs when the seal on the second letter caught his eye. It looked like the Hogwarts seal. He put down Malfoy’s reply and opened the second letter. Why was he receiving a letter from Hogwarts? His first thought was to Teddy, but he’d seen his godson yesterday and nothing had been said then. Thoroughly confused, he started reading.
“Look, Hermione.” Harry soothed. “I haven’t written to her back, but I will. I’ve got a few other ideas. I wanted to speak to Bill first about wards later actually.”
“I don’t know if it’s my help you need.” she replied. “You have a lot of questions, and I don’t have many of the answers. I think you know someone who would know the answers though.”
He summoned his trainers and decided to go for a jog. It was frosty outside, the trees sparkling in the soft morning light. He could see his breath in the air as he followed the canal east for a change. The run was a little tougher than he expected and he resolved to create some sort of exercise regime so that he didn’t lose all of this physical fitness.
“Alright alright. I get it. I’ll make myself scarce!”
Harry shrugged. “I saw you arrive. Ron and Hermione needed some
Harry groaned shamelessly. Malfoy was going to be the death of him.
“Does my grandson know?” she asked.
The room was silent apart from the sound of their heavy breathing. Malfoy pulled out and Harry collapsed onto his back, one arm bent across his eyes.
Harry grinned at the memory of a particularly energetic afternoon in the kitchen, but the feeling quickly faded into frustration. It was damn difficult finding a good shag when half the people interested in you had a preconceived idea of what the sex would be like, and the other half were women.
“What are you waiting for, Potter?” Malfoy asked softly.
Harry coughed. Maybe this was his chance? “About that.” It came out much more seriously than he’d been anticipating. Draco’s smile faded slightly.
Harry sighed. He knew that in many ways Hermione was right. But he wasn’t wired like her, he couldn’t play the long game. He’d always been impulsive, quick to action. He didn’t have the kind of patience she had.
“What-”
All mistakes my own - I finished this chapter after work!
“On your knees.” Malfoy instructed. Harry complied, and Malfoy again grabbed his hips to pull him further down the bed. The man was standing now, spreading lube over his cock.
“I’m going! I just came to drop these over anyway.” Ron unshrunk a pile of haphazardly wrapped gifts. “Where should I put them?”
“Will you be staying for dinner Harry?”
Harry was already running late by the time he arrived at the Granger-Weasley household. He didn't even have an excuse. He'd spent all day wandering aimlessly around his house, throwing half hearted cleaning spells at rooms he'd neglected over the past few months. The only productive thing he’d done was write a long apology letter to Luna for his outburst the day before.
She sat down, taking a moment to arrange her dress, before levelling him with a look that confirmed that he was indeed in trouble.
“Next academic year. September.” she clarified.
She looked at him.
“Yes, no. I don’t know. Just anywhere. The table. Leave them on the table.” Harry stuttered. “Then I have to-” he paused again, pointed vaguely at the direction of upstairs.
“Yes.” She replied. “Ron mentioned after we were round with the kids on Sunday. He said to me that he’d told you to spend some time over the Christmas break planning out your options.” She fixed him with an expression that left him very much with the impression that in her opinion, he had not given this matter the appropriate amount of thought.
Harry laughed. “Just having a look to see if there’s a better option than the gillyweed I have at home.”
It was getting late now, so he decided to cut into Soho and get some dinner. He’d brought a book with him, a thin paperback Hermione had leant him, so he ordered a carafe of red wine alongside his food and settled in. A while later he noticed the waitstaff eyeing him nervously. He took the hint and paid his bill, taking a moment to appreciate that on a normal Thursday he’d likely still be at work. It was late enough now that Soho’s bars were beginning to fill up so he spontaneously decided to drop into one of his regular haunts.
“Thank you.” Harry said. He accioed the broom and took a moment to feel its weight in his hand. “Nicely balanced.” he remarked.
Seamus was cheering and chanting. "No more Auror Potter! No more Auror Potter!" banging the cushions in time with his tune.
Harry nodded. “I’m doing a lot of thinking about my life right now. I think perhaps something part-time, or contract-based could be good for me. Malfoy said the same.
“I’m surprised you didn’t notice Potter. I heard quidditch players were rather your type.” He took a sip of his drink. “Breaking hearts all over Europe.”
Harry was trying to focus on Teddy, he really was, but today his stomach was in knots. Had it been too much sending Teddy’s letter? Should he have waited until later in the day? Was Ron wrong and was he going to be let down gently in favour of Scotland’s latest quidditch star?
“Oh sorry, you shagged him a couple of times and you knew him nearly fifteen years ago.” Ron teased.
Draco pushed his body hard against Harry’s, pinning him to the counter, strong hands pressing firmly against Harry's hips. Teeth grazed the back of Harry’s neck and he was glad that Draco was essentially holding him up as Harry didn’t think he trusted his knees right now. Draco dipped his fingers below the waistband of Harry’s joggers to squeeze his arse, all the time kissing, licking, biting at his neck, earlobe, shoulder. Harry felt like his brain was short-circuiting as blood rushed to fill his now rock hard cock. He tried to push forward against the counter, anything to relieve the dull ache between his legs, but he felt Draco’s hands still him.
Every part of Harry’s body was tense as he attempted to hold a perfectly aerodynamic position, legs tucked underneath him, nose almost flat against the handle of his auror issue broom. He kept his eyes trained on the shadowy figure ahead of him, his singular focus to get close enough to stick an instant portkey on them.
“I mean, I don’t usually get seen with people I’m not-” he started.
“Oh Harry, he’ll understand. I expect half the fun was flying with you, I’m sure he’ll be just as happy on a regular broom."
Harry positioned Malfoy’s cock against his hole and slowly pushed down. It was so much bigger than two fingers but fuck if it didn’t feel amazing. Warm, hard flesh slid slowly into his body and Harry breathed through the initial discomfort. Malfoy had his hands flat on the bed but it looked as if it was costing him effort to keep them there.
“Yeh. Do it.” Harry confirmed.
“Huh.” Ron contemplated. “I just kinda assumed he’d be up for it. I mean, you already slept together.”
“The point is-” Hermione continued, “-perhaps if you thought that relationship through, it could be a good chance for you to practice reflecting and planning before you dive straight into something new.”
Harry did not reply.
Harry didn’t reply, instead he pulled Malfoy back in for another kiss and started unfastening the clasp at the top of his robes, revealing a crisp white shirt and surprisingly muscled arms. Harry moved his hands down, past Malfoy’s narrow waist and squeezing his firm arse. Malfoy groaned into his neck and Harry decided that he needed to hear more of that sound.
Harry was about to correct him on his gendered collective noun when he realised Hermione and Hannah weren’t in the room. When had they left?
He glanced at the permanent tempus he'd had installed in the hallway and saw that it was only four minutes past eleven. Today was going to be a long day.
Draco took off his own shoes, but instead of heading upstairs he turned to Harry, pulling him close and biting at his earlobe. “Perhaps you’ll join me?”
“Harry, knowing about wine doesn’t mean that you’re smart.”
“Sit.” Ron said, pointing at the table. There was a cup of tea waiting for him. “I made tea. I could have sworn you had a coffee machine before?”
He stormed into the living room and was met with the sight of Ron carrying Hugo on his hip, Rose holding his free hand.
“Pick me up after training at seven tomorrow.” he said, and with that he was striding back towards the house leaving Harry with a rather noticeable problem to deal with.
Harry read the letter twice more before a small smile pulled at the corners of his lips. Malfoy hadn’t said no! And he was going to see him tomorrow! In fairness, he hadn’t said yes either but Harry expected that he’d be able to persuade him. He smoothed the letter out, following Malfoy’s tight cursive handwriting with his finger. Merlin he hadn’t felt this excited for a date in years. Where were they going to go? What was he going to wear!? He needed help! His friends regularly teased him that he’d somehow missed out on the ‘being able to dress himself’ part of being gay. Harry liked to make them feel bad for stereotyping, but he did agree that he didn’t have the best fashion sense. His general approach to date outfits was to wear the tightest jeans he owned and hope for the best.
His nervousness turned to relief and then excitement as a reply came back almost immediately confirming that Malfoy would be over in thirty minutes.
Draco shouted over to Teddy and then let the snitch go. They gave it twenty seconds. “Ready, go!” Draco shouted.
He cracked the first seal. The letter contained just one line.
He could go flying by himself, he supposed. He was already three days away from the Auror training gym and he could do with some exercise. He wasn’t sure if he fancied flying alone though.
Malfoy nodded and slowly pulled his fingers out. Harry watched him undo the fly of his trousers.
Harry had chosen a small muggle place tucked around the back of the financial district. It wasn’t fine dining per se, but the food was delicious and the restaurant’s focus on lots of small sharing plates made it perfect for a date. They shared a bottle of wine, and Malfoy seemingly took great delight in explaining to Harry the delicate flavour balances in each plate.
The sound of the floo flaring brought his attention back to the present and he shot a quick drying charm at his hair before heading downstairs.
“Okay!” Draco said. “Let’s try them out.” He summoned his own broom before mounting and kicking off. Teddy followed, unable to control a yelp of delight as the broom accelerated upwards. Harry took a deep breath, reminding himself that both he and Draco were on hand if anything should happen, before kicking off himself.
"The thing is-" Harry began. "I'm beginning to think I haven't ever been. Happy with my job, that is. I think I haven't really thought about it much, or allowed myself to think about it maybe. But-" he swallowed, "Now I think about it more, I don't know how much more I can take."
“It looks like you have.” Harry tried, looking Draco up and down.
“Of course!” Harry replied quickly. “That makes sense. Teddy would probably like someone he knew well there too.”
Harry shot a mild stinging charm his way.
“Actually, I think I spot the person I’m here to see. I’m ditching you, wish me luck!”
“Oh Hannah and I decided to leave you to it after Seamus challenged everyone to a centurion of after dinner liqueurs. I think he was trying to cast a gemini on the shot glasses?”
"Quite." Hermione nodded. "Although it doesn't sound like you were avoiding them. Does this mean you're official?"
If you're reading this note, thank you so much for making it to the last chapter! I really hope you enjoyed reading this story as much as I enjoyed writing it. To those of you who started reading on December 1 - I'm so sorry it took so long to finish! I've learned a lot from posting a story chapter by chapter, and one of the best lessons was how amazing it is to receive kudos and comment notifications along the way. I've really enjoyed working on a longer story, and I definitely see myself publishing more in the future!
“Do you like it when I do that darling?” Harry had his eyes screwed shut but he could picture water running down Draco’s body, his sharp features schooled into a questioning expression. He nodded.
He’d evidently made the wrong decision by sending a patronus instead of making an appearance at the office. Although to him that was just about fair enough after he’d experienced the wizarding equivalent of being dumped by text. The Ministry owl that had woken him up incredibly early had instructed him to head straight to visit London’s major potions resellers to check a list of rare ingredients that the cleanup team had collected from the warehouse.
New glass in hand, another tall clear drink, Malfoy scanned the room appraisingly. “Well, it’s been great to catch up Potter. Now if you’ll excuse me now, I must be seen mingling.”
Harry groaned. “Does this count as another pep talk?”
"Of course not. She thinks it's some of the pumpkin juice we had at breakfast.”
was the front page headline, accompanied by a photo of him from Tuesday night’s gala. Thankfully, he recognised the shot as having been taken as he arrived.
“Nngh, fuck yes.” Pleasure was building fast and Malfoy’s encouragement was enough to push him over the edge. He collapsed forward onto the bed, face pressing against covers, hand working himself through his oragasm.
Harry realised he was scratching the back of his neck, a nervous tick he’d picked up somewhere along the way. “I maybe saw him last night.”
Harry looked him up and down, grinning slightly when he noticed a faint blush appear high on Malfoy’s cheeks. Interesting. “You’ll do. Unless you plan on ratting me out to the
Sorry that I missed yesterday - work has been super busy! I'll catch up before the end of the weekend :)
Malfoy pulled away from Harry’s ear and Harry shuddered at the sensation of cool air meeting where Malfoy’s tongue had been moments ago. “Now, be a good boy and apparate us to your bedroom.” Malfoy pulled his hand away and Harry groaned, the loss of sensation highlighting just how good it had felt.
Harry sighed. He’d never hidden his sexuality from Teddy, but so far he’d avoided mixing his godfatherly duties with his love life. He’d always intended to introduce the boy to his partner once he found himself in a stable relationship, but the truth of the matter was, well, he’d simply never got that far. No one had ever been in his life long enough for Harry to even consider it. But this time was going to have to be different. Teddy already knew Malfoy and Harry wasn’t prepared to hide this from him. If it didn’t work out, Harry was just going to have to cross that bridge when he got there.
Tower Bridge was looming ahead of him, its late-Victorian iron suspension cables lit up for the Christmas season. He could see his opponent clearly now, Harry was inching closer as they started to tire.
“Pretty much.” Harry smiled. “How the mighty have fallen.”
Harry remained silent. Draco. He didn’t think he’d thought of the man by that name before. It felt weird reconciling it in his head. He wondered vaguely what it sounded like out loud.
While he’d been using the owl order service for his Christmas gifts for a few years now, it didn’t make the task of wrapping them any easier. He supposed that at least this year he wasn’t leaving it to the last minute. Usually he did his wrapping on Christmas Eve, as December was always a busy month for the Aurors and Harry was often stuck at the office. Being able to take his time was a novel experience and one he wasn’t about to take for granted.
pressed into the coin in his hand. He didn’t remember feeling disappointed then. Frustrated, yes, but disappointed? And here he was a week later feeling disappointed that he couldn’t spend the day with a man he’d spoken to for the sum total of about half an hour in the last five years.
Malfoy was licking him over and over again and Harry was groaning at every breath now. He loved being rimmed. Malfoy seemed encouraged by the noises Harry was making and Harry felt Malfoy’s own groan vibrate through his body. Those strong hands half his cheeks apart as an insistent tongue began to press inside him. Harry was grinding against the covers now, anything to heighten the sensation, but Malfoy’s grip made it difficult to move. It wasn’t impossible for him to come like this but Harry preferred the duel stimulation of a hand on his cock.
The team looked like they were just finishing a cool down, flying broad loops in formation, no doubt to loosen out sore muscles. He saw Malfoy before Malfoy noticed him, so took time to admire his form. He’d always been a good flier at school, but the years spent training and competing had honed his skills and Harry was sure that he’d have no chance against him in a match now.
“You remember how I fly?” Harry asked, surprised. He was pleased to see that Draco blushed.
"Where’s your man anyway Harry? I thought he was coming? I have a bone to pick with him after Italy’s performance last week." Seamus asked.
“Bingo.”
He had spent some time thinking about his past this week though. He’d remembered his rivalry with Malfoy, the animosity, the mixed emotions that came with being the centre of the other man’s attention. He’d also taken the time to remember their low points, the broken nose, and the Sectumsempra. Not having seen Malfoy in years, Harry had never taken the time to apologise, but he resolved to tonight. Well, if he could get the other man naked anyway.
“This is a date, Potter. If not taking this further now. Unless blowing me in the toilets in your idea of a classy evening?”
Draco pulled back slightly. “Don’t hold back. I want to hear you darling.”
Harry nodded, before kissing him once more on the lips then pushing away from the wall. “It’s upstairs.”
“Shh Potter. It’s my turn don’t you think?”
“I’ve got some samples and I wondered if you could help me identify whether they came from any magical beasts you’ve come across?” He emptied his sample box on her counter and took a seat on the stool next to the till while she looked through them. She started picking them up and examining them, and Harry resolutely ignored the voice in his head that he shouldn’t really be letting her touch them. The samples were already protected from new fingerprints or magical signatures anyway, and he didn’t expect anyone at magiforensics was particularly going to care.
He’d known from the handwriting that it was from Hermione, and he’d known from the use of his middle name that he was in trouble.
He thought back to Thursday night, the words
“Yes.” Draco replied. “It’s the balance that helps with those turns.”
“Naughty.” Malfoy reprimanded.
Harry sighed.
He was looking at the remaining faces, illuminated by the snowflakes and the generous supply of Ministry alcohol. He spotted a guy from the Magical Transportation who he’d slept with before and had been half decent.
He kicked a small pebble in frustration as he crossed to the other side of the street to avoid a group of elderly witches. He bet it was Robards who’d decided to send him. He and Harry had clashed over the issue of patronus messages before. Robards was one of the older generation who preferred Aurors to floo in with in-person status updates. Harry argued that finding a floo connection in the field was next to impossible, which meant apparating somewhere then finding a fireplace, or using the Ministry's public entrance - all where a patronus was much faster. Robards had argued that patronuses were an interruption, and Harry had not been particularly diplomatic when he’d suggested that hadn’t recently seen anyone based full time at Headquarters doing anything particularly worthy of remaining uninterrupted. Robarts had not taken kindly to this observation and Harry had found himself on desk duty for a week.
Harry nodded.
Since quitting, his mornings had started later and later as he found himself lying in bed purely because he felt incredibly fortunate that
"Okay. And even if that were the case, had you and Malfoy talked about going exclusive?"
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Umm. Yeah? They’re sort of-” he paused, now he thought about it, he had no idea how to describe it, “-metallic, I guess?”
Harry watched him remove his jacket and hang it over the back of one of the kitchen chairs. Malfoy looked effortlessly cool in a white shirt, crisp navy chinos and loafers. Harry found himself doubting his own emerald button down.
Harry jumped up to head for the shower, taking care to clean inside and out before putting on the same clothes he’d worn that day. He didn’t want it to look too much like he’d planned this, especially considering he hadn’t.
Harry lay still so not to wake him. The outside world seemed quieter than normal, as if somehow it knew not to disturb them. With a lazy wave of his hand he carefully cracked open the curtains and was surprised to see a layer of snow covering his garden. That must be what was deadening the noise then. He felt a smile tug at the corners of his lips. There was something about snow that always made him feel excited. He looked back to Draco. A month ago he wouldn’t have even dreamed of this, lying next to someone he cared for, cocooned together in bed while snowflakes fell outside. It was perfect.
“Fuck.” Harry got out. “
He decided to up the stakes. “You know what I want Malfoy.” He moved his foot to the back of Malfoy’s calf and continued to stroke back and forth. “You said you didn’t fuck on the first date. What about the second?” he asked in a low voice.
It hurt, but it felt incredible. Slow, shallow thrusts gently rocked their bodies together and Harry felt the first tendrils of pleasure twist their way through his body. No doubt conscious of their activities the previous evening Draco kept the place torturously slow, but it felt right. Snow continued to fall outside the window, but in Harry’s bed they were oblivious, rocking against each other, gasps and kisses their only communication.
“Well, you don’t have that excuse anymore.” Malfoy replied, grinning.
“Yeh I’m ready. My rucksack is by the door.” Teddy replied. “But I think you should finish this now. What if
Although the downside of thinking about Malfoy was that he was now more than a little turned on. There was a warmth there that wasn’t entirely to do with the fire cracking merrily in the hearth. He cast a quick tempus to find that it wasn’t anywhere near dinner time.
Ron was still frozen when Harry decided he needed to be the one to say something.
“You have no idea-” Malfoy popped a button, “-just how difficult it is to resist you-” another, “-when you are being so fucking slutty.” He wrestled the shirt off Harry’s shoulder and immediately his mouth was sucking, licking, biting at one of Harry’s nipples. Harry felt his head tip back as the duel sensation hit. Malfoy was mouthing at his chest now, his mouth sending Harry wild. “Those jeans-” he paused to bite Harry’s other nipple and Harry groaned, “-are a disgrace. Don’t think I didn’t know what you were playing at.”
Harry couldn’t keep the grin off his face. “That means a lot Andy.” He took a sip of his tea. “It really does.”
“Very.” Malfoy replied. “I didn’t get time to get lunch between dropping off my brooms for servicing and buying last minute gifts.” Harry placed a plate in front of Malfoy and took the place opposite him. “I guess you did this all weeks ago, now that you’re a man of leisure. What did you get Teddy?” Malfoy asked.
Standing with his forehead against the cool tiles as the uncomfortably hot water did its job did nothing for his mood. There had been no hangover potion in his bathroom and he didn't think he'd be able to navigate the stairs more than once. He didn't even attempt to use any of the magical taps. He was not in the mood for bubbles.
“Now, let’s grab the kids and head out. It’s cold enough outside today that I reckon you can do that thing where you get your patronus to freeze. You know Hugo loves the icy reindeer.”
He wandlessly cut the water and waved his hand again for a drying charm before summoning a child appropriate outfit. He conjured some sunglasses and descended the stairs steadily, bare feet leaving humid footprints on the wooden floors.
Ron froze, looking between Harry and Draco, no doubt taking in Harry’s swollen lips and mussed hair. The silence was excruciating and Harry wanted to melt into the floor.
“Alright then.” Malfoy breathed, but Harry was already asleep.
Teddy sighed dramatically. “Okay then, if you must.” He turned back to the page and finished with
Malfoy smiled at him again.
Decision made, he penned a quick note and sent it with Artimus, his owl of ten years. Then he resumed his place on the sofa once more and tried not to think too much into whether he’d come across desperate.
“Nngh” Harry breathed as he felt Malfoy pop through the first ring of muscle. He held still for a moment, his brain catching up as that familiar burn again subsided to a dull pleasure.
Saturday evening found Harry questioning his culinary ambition as he stared into his oven, trying to work out whether his lemon and sumac roasted chicken and accompanying roasted roots were either caramelised or burnt.
“Yes yes very funny. Are you ready to go? I can finish this later.” Harry vanished the failed attempts.
A thought came to his head. He took a moment to visualise what he was about to do, then he snapped his fingers, conjuring a sprig of mistletoe over his own head. He pushed his chair back, spreading his legs slightly, looked up above him and then looked at Malfoy. He was pleasantly surprised to catch Malfoy averting his gaze from his own crotch and delighted at the subsequent blush appearing across Malfoy’s cheeks. It gave him the confidence to lean back slightly. “Interested?”
“Mmm, perfect Harry. Just perfect.”
He landed on a deserted street in Limehouse and shrunk down his broom before vanishing his Auror robes in a temper. He went to run his fingers through his hair but they got stuck almost instantly. He couldn’t see himself, but he assumed it was a disaster. Stefano really was going to kill him. He was already over an hour late, and he doubted that dragonhide combat boots, Auror issue trousers and a sweaty black t-shirt was going to be the appropriate dress code for wherever Stefano had booked.
. He’d just nodded in a slightly dumbfounded way when she asked him to let her know how well it worked.
He was attempting to signal for a drink when he noticed a flash of blonde to his left, right before an over-enunciated “
Suddenly he was gripped by that feeling of righteous anger from earlier in the day. It swept up around him. "In fact, I don’t want to think about work ever again!" he announced to the room, in his moment of drunken enlightenment. "No more Auror Potter for
“We’ll be seen for sure.” Harry replied.
“It’s casual. Maybe. Maybe not.”
“It’s not like I have many other plans.” Harry replied. “Just let me know, I can always apparate to Teddy’s to pick him up on the way.” He took a sip of his wine. “Do you like the food?”
“Merlin will you leave it alone!” Harry retorted, but there was no heat in his words. He had been fairly confident that Ron wouldn’t react too badly on hearing the news, but the war had left deep scars on all of them, and one could never be sure when its legacy would rear its ugly head. Even so, it was still reassuring that Ron’s first instinct was to trust him.
Harry looked down at the brooms, reaching out to touch the lettering on the Firebolt’s handle. It threw up some complex emotions but when Harry looked back up at Draco and saw his determined expression, he smiled. He understood the gesture for what he hoped it was, a tacit agreement that they couldn’t ignore their past, but that Draco was prepared to acknowledge it carefully and respectively.
Channeling every pickup Quidditch game he’d ever played, Harry took aim and threw. He watched it sail through the air, heading straight for the centre of the figure’s back. He breathed a sigh of relief, before choking in surprise as the portkey bounced off an invisible shield and hurtled down towards the river below. Harry felt his stomach drop as his only hope of safely securing the fugitive sunk into the choppy depths. As if sensing Harry’s failure, the figure turned sharply towards the bank. Harry tried to match the maneuver but he was too slow, not having anticipated the turn. He watched the figure land and immediately disapparate. Well this was just great.
They collapsed onto the bed, sweaty and out of breath.
Finally they made it into his bedroom and he turned to face Malfoy. The other man looked gorgeous. A crisp white shirt stretched slightly across his pecs, and Harry’s mouth watered at the idea of getting his mouth on his body again.
Draco looked curious but said nothing, almost as if he knew the story but was waiting for Harry to share it. Maybe Harry was imagining it, or, his heart dropped, maybe Ron had said something? He was being stupid, it didn’t matter either way, Malf-Draco would find something to tease him about either way. He pulled himself back to reality to find Draco slowly stalking towards him.
soon after she returned from her travels and she housed creatures both visible and, as Harry diplomatically referred to them,
He settled into the sofa and his mind of course went back to Malfoy, how he’d pushed his cock into Harry’s mouth in this very spot only two nights before. He could always invite Malfoy over again. He might be free. The idea was tempting, very tempting.
Harry stood in the doorway to his living room holding a hot cup of tea in both hands. He blew on it gently and took a small sip.
Stefano was still fresh in his mind, the sound of his laugh, the taste of clean skin. He didn't need a good friend trashing that. He was sure the
“So needy.” Draco whispered into his ear. Harry felt himself nodding in agreement, and then Draco was maneuvering them so that Draco had his back against the counter top and Harry was standing facing him. Draco had a wicked glint in his eye, and Harry felt his heart racing. This man was simply too sexy for his own good.
again? I could really do without that.”
Harry was exhausted. He’d spent what felt like almost the entire day outside, him and Teddy helping to prepare Andromeda’s small kitchen garden for the winter as she stayed inside cooking. He’d dug over so much earth that even his arm protested as he gripped his cup of tea. He’d suggested they use a spell, but Andromeda had explained that the magical residue would upset the delicate balance needed to nurture the vegetables she’d be planting in the spring, so they’d stuck with shovels, the hard work more effectively than any warming charm.
Harry groaned, he was close now. He felt that familiar hot pleasure slowly build in groin. His hips shifted automatically and every muscle in his body tensed before the pleasure crested and he came, spunk covering his hand and pubic hair.
“Um.. no it’s okay.”Merlin that was the second time he’d gotten tongue tied around Malfoy in less than a minute. “I’ll see you soon though!” he added hastily. He needed to get out of here before he embarrassed himself any further.
Malfoy looked back to Harry. He kissed him on the cheek and fixed him with an expression that left Harry in complete certainty that Draco expected them to continue what they had started just as soon as Ron left.
Hermione’s advice was still fresh in his mind as he caught sight of the
“Fuck, D-Draco. Draco if you keep doing that I’m gonna come.” Harry shouted. The name felt awkward in his mouth, but he didn’t have much time to consider the moment before the man was bending one of Harry’s legs up over a pale shoulder and pressing back into him. “Oh god, Draco, fuck me!” It felt unbelievable, relentlessly pleasurable as Malfoy fucked him hard and fast. Harry’s cock was bouncing against his stomach and Malfoy reached a hand to support Harry’s hips so that Harry could grab and stroke himself in time.
“I mean-” Harry fumbled. “Would that be okay?”
“I do believe we already have been seen together.” Draco stated. “Or did this morning’s activities affect your memory?” He leaned back against the counter and Harry envied the casualness with which he held himself.
“I’m sorry I’m so late Aunt!” He started. “The game ran over but I came as soon as I could, hence my attire.” he gestured towards himself.
He stood up from the floor and summoned a joint. He was already pretty relaxed, but he liked the mellow feeling that came with gillyweed. Living room or bedroom? Going upstairs seemed like a lot of effort, so he settled into the sofa, positioning himself so he was half propped up against the cushions.
“Christmas parties you know?” the man replied, pouring Harry another large glass of red. “A few free drinks and everyone decides they want to party. Not that it takes much to convince us gays to go dancing.”
Malfoy growled behind him, and Harry suddenly felt those hands on his hips again almost causing him to fall forwards, but the hands held him in place as he felt Malfoy take a playful bite through the denim into the soft part of his arse.
“Spit it out Potter.”
“I already made you a coffee Harry. Less of the compliments and more of you telling me what’s going on in your head. Hugo’s probably only got another thirty minutes left of his nap and I have to collect Rose from Molly’s at three.”
“Got your eye on anyone Potter?”
He hadn’t had much luck so far. None of the apothecaries he’d visited had even stocked the ingredients that had been uncovered, instead referring him to magical wholesalers.
Harry could believe that. The sheer noise surrounding them was almost overwhelming. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever seen so many children in one space.
He pondered this new Malfoy as he made his way down through the stands. Well, he wasn’t necessarily new, just new to Harry. He was examining the Falcons trophy cabinet when Malfoy appeared, hair still slightly damp from the shower.
"I don't know how you do this full time." Harry whispered to Ron while massaging his temples.
“I will consider it.” He replied, slowly. “Let’s say I’m trying to spend more time thinking, less time diving in at the moment.” He leaned back in his chair. “When would you expect these courses to start?”
“Rory Rankin.”
“Gonna let me return the favour?” Harry asked.
“Don’t say that.” she warned. “No I was going to say that I think there’s a bigger picture here. You said it yourself, you act first, think second. I’m your friend, and I care about you, and I can’t help but think that if you thought first every now and again, it might sometimes work out for you.” She finished her coffee. “I know you don’t want to talk about Stefano-”
Harry spotted Luna behind the counter, a small mammalian creature with lime green fur balanced on her shoulder.
“Us going outside?” Draco replied and Harry wondered whether he was being deliberately obtuse.
“‘Fraid not kiddo. I’m just dropping these off-” he held up the presents “-and then I’ve got to get going.”
Harry swallowed, his brain trying to process Draco’s switch from serious to sultry. “I can do that.” he replied.
Harry snorted, steering their conversation from serious to playful. “Perhaps.” He peeled off his jumper. “Merlin I need a shower.” Draco laughed. “Guests first though, use the one in my en suite.”
Malfoy laughed. “Aren’t they married? Don’t they see each other all the time?”
A robin hopped across the frosted grass and Harry watched it, contemplating. This was all happening so quickly. Less than two weeks ago he’d been with Stefano, and while those memories had already started to fade, he couldn’t help but wonder if he was rushing things. Talking with Malfoy, sleeping with Malfoy, he felt a real connection, but was he getting caught up in the excitement? Was a date what he wanted right now? Was a relationship what he wanted right now?
He really should work towards getting them in the same room more often, Harry mused, then he could cut out this ludicrous middle man work and avoid any more evenings like this. While Hermione was moving fast through the ranks at the recently renamed Department for Magical Beings, her job rarely put her in the same room as Kingsley.
As usual, Harry was running out of time. You’d think that with no job and a limited wardrobe that he’d be better prepared. But no, somehow he’d wasted the morning pottering around the kitchen, meaning that he made lunch quite late, which had been fine until he’d decided to spend over an hour in the bath. Now it was almost four in the afternoon and he had less than an hour to drop presents off at Ron and Hermione’s before apparating to the Falcons stadium.
“Do you recognise anything else?”
Draco raised an eyebrow but didn’t push him. “Try the latest Cleansweep. I know they were rubbish at school-” he said, on seeing Harry’s grimace, “-but they’ve come a long way. I think it’ll suit your flying style.”
“You’re right, it’s just wine. I mean-” he didn’t know quite how to phrase it. “Despite his past, he’s actually got his shit together. Like, he’s on top of his game in the league, he knows what he wants with his career, he’s confident.”
“Oh ha ha very funny.”
him.” Ron teased.
“Err, yes, just here please.” he nodded at the table, watching as she placed an absolutely enormous drink in front of him. It was covered in tiny marshmallows and colourful sprinkles.
Malfoy pulled them both down towards the bed, pressing their chests against each other, and cutting off the rest of Harry’s sentence.
"Astute Potter. I'm surprised." Malfoy took a sip of what was either water or straight vodka. "I'm assuming that comment was off the record?" He smirked.
Harry schooled his face into something that he hoped didn’t read ‘you just caught me daydreaming about riding Draco Malfoy’s cock’ and brushed over the question. “Headmistress.” he replied. “Thank you for making the time to see me.”
“Not yet. But I will.” he added on seeing Ron’s expression. “I need to think about it. I don’t know if I’m ready for teaching yet. It seems so-” he searched for the right word “-overwhelming.” He finished. “I can’t imagine standing up in front of a class. I barely know what I’m doing with my own life!”
“What happened?” Ron asked, putting Hugo down who immediately tottered off after his sister.
Hermione smiled. “Well aren’t you lucky that I’m not in the office today.” A final flourish of her wand and the warm frothy milk topped up their mugs. She levitated a cappuccino in front of him and he nodded in thanks as she picked up a box of gingerbread men from the side. “Okay.” She sat down. “We have drinks and snacks. What do you want to cover first, McGonagall’s letter or Malfoy’s?”
“-leave it with you?” Andromeda was saying and Harry realised he must have zoned out.
“Malfoy, I-” he froze as the rest of a luminescent slash appeared. It ran diagonally from just below where Malfoy’s shirt collar had been to slightly below the bottom of his ribs. Harry reached out to touch, but stopped just short. “I’m really sorry-”
“If we go out-” Harry started, then he took a breath. “If we go out, people might see us.” Merlin this was nerve wracking.
Many hours later he found himself crossing Oxford Street by the tube station. After a late lunch he’d decided to leave the house on foot, first taking a meandering route along the canal near his house towards Camden and Regent's Park, then turning south into Fitzrovia once the sun had set. He always enjoyed London at this time of year, the smell of mulled wine in the air and Christmas lights shining in the windows of homes and shops alike.
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed what you’re doing Potter.” He slapped Harry’s bum where he’d just bitten it and Harry shivered. “Hurry along now Potter.”
Harry jolted in surprise as he found himself suddenly with a lapful of child. "Rose joins cuddle too?" She shouted.
“Let me rephrase that.” Ron replied calmly. “Does Malfoy know you quite like him as a person or might he instead think you just quite like his cock every now and again?”
He wasn’t nervous per se, they’d very much broken through the first date awkwardness, but with their shared history Harry wasn’t completely confident. While Harry felt comfortable with their fledgling relationship so far, his own visceral reaction to their conversation about Snape had caught him by surprise. He’d had nearly fifteen years to process the trauma of his childhood, but his teenage years weren’t something he often spent time dwelling on. Of course the
It was amazing how quickly things could change, Harry thought as he blinked his eyes open the following morning. Less than one month ago he would have happily described waking up as one of the worst parts of his day. It had been the moment he was reminded of a job that he hated, or, if he was luckily enough for it to be the weekend, he was reminded of how tired he felt from working the job that he hated.
The pace only increased as each undressed the other, both pressing feverish kisses against newly revealed skin. Fuck this was so hot.
“You’re a heathen.” Malfoy retorted. “A guest shouldn’t have to pour their own wine.”
Hermione’s words flashed into his mind.
He crept out of bed, grabbing a pair of joggers on the way out of the room. He was in the process of making a cup of tea when Draco appeared at the doorway. He was wearing a pair of tight black boxer briefs and nothing else. Harry nearly dropped the milk.
“Sorry, what was that?”
at the bottom. He hadn’t even known they were going away? Did they mention it when he saw them last? His mind cast back to their rowdy Christmas meal and his body shivered involuntarily and the memory of the hangover that had followed. Had it really only been three weeks ago? That felt impossible. So much had changed. He’d still technically had a job back then. He hadn’t even known Draco was in the country.
“Why do you think I suggested it?” she replied, seemingly oblivious to Harry’s internal panic.
Harry sighed dramatically. “Malfoy’s dating someone else.”
“Oh, you’ve just reminded me.” Harry checked around them for the boy in question. “I was thinking of buying Teddy a broom for Christmas this year. What do you think?”
“Hugo is boring!” she replied stubbornly.
Harry just stood there.
“Are you sure?” Harry asked hopefully.
“You’re welcome mate. One day you’ll be ready to leave the nest, though I reckon Rose might get there before you.”
Instead of spiraling into a temper like he might normally have done, he took a deep breath, fixed a casual smile onto his face, and then levitated the paper straight into the already happily burning fire.
“Fuck!” Harry swore out loud as he remembered, his voice vanishing instantly into the icy wind. He was supposed to be meeting Stefano for dinner. Motherfucker. Stefano was not going to be happy. All for a stupid criminal who’d decided on a dramatic escape rather than just apparating like everyone else. If only they’d apparated Harry would have been home and changed an hour ago. Instead he was late, again.
Malfoy groaned. “Merlin Potter you feel incredible.” he thrust upwards, once, twice, knocking Harry off his rhythm but nailing his prostate.
“Fuck, don’t stop! Yes, another. As many as you like!” Harry almost shouted.
Harry continued to want to disappear.
“I’m good.” Harry said.
Andromeda smiled patiently. “I was saying that perhaps you could both take Teddy flying. I’d like for Teddy to get to know his cousin. He was only young when Draco moved to France. But perhaps he’d feel more comfortable if you were there too.”
“I’ve been thinking about it since we kissed goodbye the other night.” Harry admitted.
Malfoy grinned, looking Harry up and down shamelessly. “Quite.” Harry desperately hoped that his lapel was even.
“So what did you talk about?” Ron asked. “He actually seemed pretty decent the other night, like he’s really changed. Did you talk about school?”
“Ah, I guess I didn’t yet.” Harry cleared his throat, his voice sounding too loud in the quiet away from the rest of the guests. “I wondered, umm, I wondered if you were free for me to take you out some time?” he asked. He didn’t expect Malfoy to say no, they’d been flirting all night after all, but even so, it felt like he could hear his own heart beating as Malfoy stared down back at him.
“My hero!” She handed him his mulled wine. “I’m telling you, maintaining a levitation charm when you’re trying not to fall flat on your face is more difficult than it looks!”
A stroke of inspiration had him stepping inside, perhaps Luna would recognise some of the biological samples? It was exactly this kind of idea that he doubted anyone at headquarters would have considered. They tended to follow the numbers. “Almost all potions dens are linked to an apothecary who wanted a bit of extra cash.” Robards had said to him many many times before. Then he’d just laugh when Harry always replied “Almost”. Well, he’d show them, Harry thought.
“Hi Uncle Harry!” she beamed. “I’m helping Daddy which means I’m also helping Santa Clause because Mummy says that Daddy helps Santa Claus! I even wore my special hedgehog mittens in case it was as cold like Santa’s house in the North Pole!” She held up her hands for him to see.
He slowly sorted through the boxes, putting anything that had arrived gift wrapped to one side before meticulously organising the rest. He didn’t want to wrap something only to later forget who it was intended for. Christmas with the Weasleys was chaotic enough.
“Good choice young man.” Draco replied, clapping Teddy on the shoulder. “You managed to pick the only one that isn’t out yet. It’s the new Comet. They’re saying it’s the fastest on the market.”
“Ngh.”
“Well I know we were all completely smashed last night but you seemed fairly committed to the ‘No more Auror Potter’ chant.”
Harry batted the handcuffs out of his face, or tried to at least. For some reason his hand didn’t do exactly what he wanted it to do and he ended up sort of stroking the handcuffs instead. "Ergh no thanks Seamus. I don’t want to think of work on a Saturday."
Mentally congratulating himself for allowing himself time to reflect he turned and headed back inside. Hermione would be so proud.
Ron looked very unimpressed. “What’s going on mate?”
that morning.
Everyone in the department knew how much of a hassle it was to have him in Diagon Alley for work and so Harry suspected the task had been set intentionally.
“This is why I need your help!”
“Yours.” Malfoy confirmed.
Dean pushed at Seamus’s shoulder. "Stop it, love. Give the man a break." He turned towards Harry. "Sorry to hear that. Give me and Seamus a call when you’re ready to hit the town yeh? We’ll all go out."
He vanished the paper in frustration and was left staring at the now empty table. Fucking Malfoy. Once a bastard always a bastard it seemed. Harry was furious. It had only been four days since Malfoy had rimmed him with an inch of his life and now he’s taking some other guy out?
Harry laughed. “I stick around if it’s worth sticking around, Malfoy.”
“Mmm yeh.” Harry replied, kissing down Malfoy’s body until he was straddling him again. He gestured between them. “Can I?” he asked, hoping that Malfoy would understand. Malfoy nodded and Harry took that as tacit approval for him to vanish their clothes.
“I haven’t seen you here in a while. Looking to get back into the game?”
“Okay, I’ll meet with her.”
He picked up the now empty coffee cup and headed back inside. Stefano had been fun, but their time together had been limited to weekends when their schedules matched up. These weekends were few and far between, and had been mostly spent in bed together in hotel rooms in locations near to Stefano’s next match. They’d met in Paris, Rome, Tallinn and Lubliana and Harry had barely been outside, except for one notable weekend in Barcelona where Harry had decided to apparate to the wizarding district briefly to buy some gillyweed for them. Despite their six month romance, he couldn’t describe Stefano as particularly interesting. Neither of them had been particularly bothered by the other's career or social life, instead focusing on each other’s bodies, and occasionally the league. But Malfoy was different. While the conversation they’d had on Tuesday had been brief, Harry had found himself enjoying the playful teasing between them, and mutual displeasure at being forced to attend such a dry event. He knew that he was living up to one stereotype or another by finding one of the few gay men at a predominantly straight event and then proceeding to bitch about everyone else, but it had been fun.
“That does tend to happen when one is outside in central London.” Draco deadpanned.
“Sure. I’m just going to go to sleep now okay. You’ve finished me.”
“Say something?” Harry asked desperately.
“I do believe you.” he replied. “I just-” he paused. “-I guess I can’t work out why you’re interested.” Ordinarily this wouldn’t have mattered to him, the man opposite was hot, he was good in bed, and he had a good sense of humour after all, but for the first time in his life Harry found himself considering their compatibility beyond the physical.
As if sensing his discomfort, McGonagall changed the subject. “The news that you had single-handedly ripped through the Ministry's wards recently made its way up here from London.” Her eyes sparkled and Harry’s stomach dropped in embarrassment.
“Can I borrow your debit card Harry?”
Harry’s smile faded. “We weren’t. I just-” he paused. “I think I quite like him Ron.”
It was late afternoon when he finished with the apothecaries. He was cold, and because it was next to impossible to get even a takeaway coffee without being accosted, he was hungry. On top of that, it wasn’t yet close enough to the end of the working day that he could realistically get away with going straight home.
“Yes, yes! Malfoy, Draco, same same. Just, please?” Harry pleaded. He was fortuitously still hidden behind the counter but if he didn’t touch himself soon he was going to spontaneously combust. He could still taste Draco’s spunk on his tongue.
Harry closed his eyes again and picked up the pace on his own dick, his hand flying over the tip just how he liked. Malfoy groaned above him. “Potter, I’m going to come. You’re going to make me come.” Harry moaned and tried to relax his jaw further, hoping Malfoy would get the hint and finish in his mouth.
“Ngh. Fuck, like that.” Harry breathed.
He learned that Malfoy was determined and committed in a way that Harry genuinely admired, and he had a dry sense of humour which Harry enjoyed immensely. He’d also learned that Malfoy was a surprisingly tactile person. He was constantly touching Harry on the arm to make a point, steering him slightly at the waist as they moved in and of larger conversations, and at one point, there was a reassuring hand on his lower back as someone Harry didn’t know got a little too opinionated on the topic of Harry’s departure from the Aurors.
“Uh huh.” Ron repeated. “And did you have a conversation about it?”
Harry looked to the floo powder in his hand, and then back up at Malfoy. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to get through a dinner without combusting. He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to do about Malfoy yet, and sitting across from the man at what would essentially be a family dinner while he was dressed like one of Harry’s deepest fantasies would not help him decide.
"Oh Auror Potter, I think I’ve been a bad boy." Seamus had grabbed the handcuffs from Harry and was dangling them in front of Harry’s face from his pinky finger.
He hadn’t come untouched with Draco yet, but the man was definitely about to find out that for Harry this was entirely possible.
Malfoy pulled back slightly, looking directly into his eyes before biting Harry’s lip slowly. Harry swallowed. “You seemed like you’d be up for it.” Malfoy replied nonchalantly, kissing him where he’d just bitten Harry’s lip. “I’ve just arrived back in London and I don’t know anyone yet. Don’t tell me I wasn’t the best option in the room?” He smirked against Harry’s lips. “Ministry events aren’t exactly a popular gay hookup location.”
Harry nodded into Draco’s shoulder and he heard Draco whisper “Merlin” as if he too couldn’t quite believe they’d ended up like this.
Harry coughed. “I’m not sure if she was aware of our-” He paused. “-
Hermione narrowed her eyes. "A likely story." She turned to Harry. "While I suspect that my husband is stretching the truth, I did actually want to congratulate you. Luna mentioned that you and Draco were spotted getting coffee yesterday. She also mentioned the likelihood of a rather racy kiss making onto the front page of every news outlet as soon as the holidays are over."
But he never got to finish his sentence because at that moment a crack of apparatation announced the arrival of a very sweaty looking Draco Malfoy.
“I believe you had a question to ask me?” Malfoy said, and Harry felt the whisper of breath on his cheek. The glow from the lights was illuminating Malfoy’s pale face, and his eyes were sparkling.
“Huh?” Harry said. Teddy was looking at him, face a picture of innocence.
“Ron.” Hermione looked visibly put out by the change in tone.
Andromeda’s annual Christmas get together was in full swing when the host herself approached him.
Harry refrained from arguing back. “Dinner’s ready, if you’re hungry?”
Despite having arrived thoroughly planning to turn her down, Harry stopped to consider McGonagall’s suggestion. It wasn’t what he’d been expecting. He thought she’d ask him about the Defence role. It made him think of Draco’s suggestion too. His imagination began to wander, part-time consulting, sporadic lecturing, it could suit him. And being at Hogwarts regularly would give him more time to see Teddy.
Despite the fact that he hadn't seen Malfoy in years, Harry found himself feeling refreshed by his gloves off approach.
“Uh huh.” Ron agreed. “And does Malfoy feel the same?”
left me with no doubt that it was definitely from you, and not some imposter.”
Harry hummed. He hadn’t been, at least he didn’t think he had been, but now with their cocks pressed together he couldn’t be sure of anything.
“Thanks. Sorry. I mean, bye. Have a good day.” Harry rushed out.
“Yes, I mean D-Draco.”
Perhaps if he never entered the room then he wouldn’t have to deal with the scene before him. It looked a little like the backroom at Honeydukes, he thought, remembering the time he’d sneaked to Hogsmeade in third year. Every available surface and most of the floor space was covered in gifts ready to be wrapped. A large pine tree lay on its side, and next to it was a box of assorted decorations. He had his work cut out for him.
“Oh and thank you for the gift Harry.” Andromeda looked over at the little Christmas tree that sat in it’s pot near the door. He’d grown it himself and was very proud of it. Although it really was very small. Harry had attached a red bauble to the top lest it got confused with a regular hedge plant, but the poor tree was nearly bent in half from the weight of it. “It’s very-” she paused. “-cute.”
“Oh I’m still interested in hooking up.” Draco stared intently into Harry’s eyes and Harry felt like he was being undressed then and there. Did they really have to stay for dessert? But then Malfoy was pulling back slightly, taking time to refold his own napkin.
“Yeh yeh Teddy, you’re welcome. But if I receive one letter home about you wearing them to class then I’ll be up to Hogwarts to collect them myself faster than you can say the words Hungarian Horntail.”
