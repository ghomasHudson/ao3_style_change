“Please find it. I will be in my dorm when you find it. Anything necessary to find Harry’s cloak, but try and stay under the radar and not get noticed.”
“Madam Pomfrey, please tell me there may be a chance that this could wear off or you or someone can turn me back.”
“What if I can get pregnant, but I’m not?” Harry questioned.
“We were talking and then all of a sudden he curled into a ball and covered his ears like he was trying to block some voice out, but after that the room went silent, because we were concerned. Then he started screaming, not a simple ah, but a blood curdling scream like someone was killing him slowly and painfully or had just found his parents murdered in front of his eyes.”
“If that happens we’re in trouble,” Draco laughed, and Harry just gave him a look. Draco just went back to what he was doing.
“I wouldn’t want you failing you classes.” Harry whispered with regret in her tone.
“Just breath through it sweetheart. Just breathe.” Narcissa whispered to her soothingly as everyone else just stared uncertainly at the two women. Draco finally snapped out of his reprieve, and he reached out and wrapped his arms around Harkin’s waist, resting one of his hands on her still flat stomach. Harkin released a breath that she was holding in and sighed as she leaned back into Draco’s embrace.
“Dray, do you think I would have allowed you to do that if I wasn’t okay with it.” Draco gave Harry a look of confusion, so Harry elaborated, “Yes, Dray. I’m alright with it.” Harry pulled Draco in and kissed his lips. “Dray, I love you. You don’t have to apologize for this; I wanted you to do this or otherwise this wouldn’t have happened. Its fine, Dray.” Harry pulled Draco back in and started kissing Draco again. The two continued kissing until there was a sudden banging on the bedroom door.
“Nothing, though that doesn’t mean that Ron and I weren’t worried. When am I not worried about you?” Hermione asked the minute the door was completely closed. “Where the hell do you go with Malfoy?”
“Oh, no need to be embarrassed, darling. I know that is true, but I meant for me not knowing you that long, I feel like I know you well enough to be my daughter.”
“I don’t think I gave had the pleasure, sir.”
“Ah, I see that you do not understand my position as High Inquisitor, Headmaster. I am to oversee all event at Hogwarts. I hope to stay informed.” Umbridge stepped closer she caught a glimpse of Harry from behind Draco, and she smiled. “But seeing as the student in question is Harry Potter I understand why you would not inform me of his ‘incident.’ This was probably just him inflicting pain on himself to get attention.” Draco chuckled at that, and stepped closer to Harry. “Is something funny Mr. Malfoy?”
“Ronald, after everything have you not figured it out yet?”
“You were hunting horcruxes?!” Remus shouted. “Dumbledore had a bunch of teenagers hunting horcruxes. But not just anyone’s horcruxes, Voldemort’s.” Remus shouted as he moved towards the door. I need to see him, now.” Remus said as he started walking towards the door.
“Yes, we have company downstairs, and they would like to speak to you and Harry.” She said, but the way she said it, Draco didn’t like what was going to happen.
When Harry finally pulled away, Sirius saw the tears running down her face, and he quickly took his thumb and whipped them away. “Why are you crying, fawn?” Sirius asked.
“Definitely like her father.”
“I will be helping. No matter how much I think he should be there for some of the things he did in school; I understand that 13 years of unnecessary imprisonment should be suitable for his punishment for school. So, I will be helping to make sure he is cleared along with Albus, though I’m not sure how much help he will be.”
Hermione walked over and rested her hand on Harry’s cheek. “Draco, calm down. His temperature is definitely climbing. He’s not that cold anymore. You won’t have to move away; you’ll just have to be extra careful. Harry can take care of himself, he always has. You two will figure this out if it ends up being a long term thing. His breathing is normal, he’s warmer lready than he was when I walked in.”
“You know what I always wanted to do in this room?”
“I miss him too, Harry.” He whispered.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know why that’s so funny.” Harry said throw bouts of laughter, and everyone continued to stare. “I’m okay I swear, just give me a second.” Harry stood up and walked out of the hall and into one of the alcoves outside the Great Hall and continued to laugh, and a few minutes later, Harry felt a pair of arms around her and she spun around with her wand at their throat. She only pulled back slightly when she saw that it was Draco. “Damn it, Draco. I could have hurt you. What were you thinking?” Harry stated as she relaxed into Draco’s arms but kept her wand gripped tightly in her hand.
Another chapter down. Sorry i am awful at updating. real life sadly gets in the way of my writing. too much work taking up my time.
“I asked if they could postpone until after Christmas, but they said they wouldn’t. I will make it up to you, fawn. Your birthday will be the best birthday ever.” Sirius said as he nuzzled his face into her hair, and he just inhaled the smell to try and memorize it just in case. “I love you, fawn.” Sirius muttered as he pulled away and looked up at Remus.
“Well, it could, if Potter wasn’t going to be here all summer, and since he is here because of Draco, I’m pretty sure the two would be pretty inseparable while he is here.”
“She nearly died?” Ron said in disbelief.
“Ron Weasley.” Narcissa looked down at him, and she saw his eyes staring up at her.
“She’s broken the wards.” Draco said, and everyone turned to stare at him.
“The fact that you said that greatly disappoints me, Albus, because it brings to attention that you already know what I am talking about, and the fact that you let it happen is rather disappointing.”
“It’s not that I don’t trust your ability it’s just I need information from the Healer that you can’t give me, Madam Pomfrey.”
“Cissy, you don’t have to apologize. To be honest I probably would have done the same thing if I was the one watching you be thrown out on the streets, Cissy. You, Draco, and Harry are welcome here as long as you want to stay. I will have three rooms accommodated for you and the boys. Make yourselves at home, and I will set the rooms. Sit, Cissy, please.” Narcissa walked over to the couch and sat down on the couch, and Draco and Harry followed her over to the couch and sat down next to her. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder, and Harry rested his hand on Draco’s inner thigh.
“Can’t you finish what you started first?” Harry moaned.
“I have been dreaming about fucking you for years, Potter; I’m going to enjoy this.” Draco said as he twisted his finger just right, and Draco could feel Harry’s cock twitch against his abdomen. Draco’s lips twitched into a smirk as he inserted the second finger inside Harry, and Harry was now panting as the third finger pushed its way in with the other two.
“I agree, and I’m also glad that my father never finished the contract with the Greengrass’ before he went to Azkaban.” Draco stated.
Snape’s chanting stopped, and they all turned as they heard a thump across the room. Snape rushed across the room to find Draco lying on the floor, and he touched his fingers to Draco’s skin and they came back cold. He picked Draco up and carried him over to the settee and laid him next to Harry.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.” Harry whispered before Narcissa pulled her from the room and down the corridor, and Harry felt like she was being pulled into the depths of the Manor.
“No, you are going to talk to me. What was your dream about?” Harkin questioned as she made herself a little more unmovable, but not so much so that Draco couldn’t move her if he actually tried.
“What am I going to do? The Dursley’s. Oh no. No. No. No. I can’t go back there not like this I need to talk to Sirius. I hope he’s alright with this and Remus. Oh, Merlin.” Harry was sitting upright in the bed with her face in her hands, and Draco could hear soft sobs coming from her.
Harry woke from sleep with the dream at the forefront of her mind. The Dark Lord tortured Nott for raping her. How did he even know that he did that? She sat upright at the sound of someone knocking on her door. “Come in.” Harry whispered, and in her doorway stood Voldemort. “How did you find out?” Harry asked and for the first time Harry saw a look of confusion on Voldemort’s face.
“Dobby. Our old house elf. That is who you are trusting your life with?” Draco asked.
“I’m sorry. I forgot to tell you. When I was going through my father’s study, I found a marriage contract that he had been writing up with Marvin Greengrass about me marrying his youngest daughter, Astoria. The contract looked complete except for my father and her father’s signatures. Which I through in the fire.” Draco stated as he pulled Harkin closer to him. “Because I love you, and I am bonded to you, and I don’t want my father to be able to intervene in that anymore. You and the twins are what matter to me now, and my father can rot in Azkaban.” Draco finished as he kissed Harkin’s cheek.
“I always wondered why you kept your hair long. Not that I don’t love the hair.” Draco questioned as his fingers ran through her hair, and Harry leaned into the touch.
“Are you sure?” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear.
“I hope you are right, Severus, because if you aren’t Draco will be pissed.” Narcissa stated.
When Draco pulled away, Harry said, “I just want to make sure that this is what you wanted, because if you didn’t we can stop and never talk about this again. Then we don’t have to worry about what your parents would say or what anyone else would say, we could just be us like we always have been, and no one would know that this happened.” Harry pulled back away, but Draco kept him where he was.
“Alright then. Tally.” Draco called and everyone jumped as they heard the crack of apparation.
“Unfortunately, Miss Granger.” Narcissa said as she looked at the clock on the wall. “Though, that took longer than anticipated. We should go check on Harkin.” She said as she walked out of the room, and Remus and Hermione hurried from the room to follow her to Draco’s room. “How are they, Mel?” Narcissa asked as soon as she entered the room.
“Draco, is that a Gryffindor tie?” Lucius asked, and Draco groaned as Harkin laughed out loud causing everyone’s heads to turn towards her. “What is so funny?” Lucius asked.
“I love you, Draco. And what you just said means more to me than anything in the world. People will judge, but I shouldn’t care what they say as long as the people that matter are with me.” Harkin said as she turned in Draco’s lap to kiss him on the lips. “Though I am somehow still really tired.” Harkin commented as she stood up in the tub and stretched before getting out and grabbing a towel to dry off. She walked out of the bathroom, and she walked over to the door on the opposite side of the room. She opened it to see a decent sized walk in closet, and she closed the door to turn and look around for the door to the nursery, and she found it on the side of the room that lead in from the main lounge area, and she walked over to open the door and find a room with two basinets for the twins and two dressers with changing tables on top and in the two opposite corners of the room were two rocking chairs. The walls were this cerulean colored blue that was just beautiful, and the molding around the room was this whitish-silver color that matched the rocking chairs and the dressers, but the basinets were this lilac shade of purple that somehow worked in the room. The small closet in the room was already stocked with various sizes of baby diapers and supplies.
“Yeah, I’ll be fine in a little bit. Just give me a second.” Harry rested his head in his hands while he tried to steady himself. Draco just watched Harry closely, and waited for Harry to look back up at him. Harry could feel Draco’s eyes burying into him, and he glanced up at him.
Draco pulled Harry from the shower as he still had his arms around Harry to keep him warm. “Why am I so cold?” Harry asked with his teeth chattering making barely audible.
“I forgot it in my excitement.” Draco tried.
“How long have you been standing there?” Harkin asked as she turned in her seat to face him.
Severus and Lucius hurried back to the castle, and they burst into the headmaster’s office, where everyone was still talking. Narcissa was bargaining with Albus about where Harry should be placed, but they all became quiet and turned towards the two men as they burst into the office.
“Raven,” Draco whispered as he pulled her into a tighter hug. “We should get ready for the day.” Draco stated putting off the conversation they should have.
“Mom, Dad. Are you heading back home? All of you should head home. We don’t know what is going to happen and I want you safe. Can you all go to Bill’s at least for a while? Please.” Ron said as he looked over to his family.
“Draco, calm down. What’s wrong?” Severus asked.
“I will take care of her, my Lord.”
“Ask Hermione for the sword of Gryffindor, it’s imbedded with basilisk venom.” Harry muttered before Draco suspected he fell back asleep. Draco gently rested Harry completely against the bed before he walked out of the room, he closed the door and the next moment he was standing in the dining room.
“Where do we find her?” Ron asked.
“I know I just didn’t realize how much like Hermione you actually were. Minus the pureblood status I’m practically dating my best friend.” Harkin stated with a smile, just waiting for Draco’s reaction.
“Please, just make an exception this once please. I need to get something from Harry Potter’s room for her, and she gave me the password. She doesn’t trust her things are safe, please.”
“That’s barbaric!” Hermione exclaimed.
“Yes, you have, love.” Draco stated.
“Where’s Harry, Mum? Is she alright?” Draco asked as he tried to get back up again, but Narcissa placed her hands on his shoulders and pushed him back against the bed.
“But he has known who I was from the beginning, why should that make such a difference now, or last year for that matter. He has known since the first day we met that I was the Harry Potter.” Harkin stated.
“They said that as far as they can tell, it is permanent. There is nothing they can do to reverse it or change you back. The only way that they figured they might be able to do anything is for you to go to their facilities for them to do test and other things.”
“We couldn’t wait. Something is wrong with Harry.” Narcissa said as she tossed the floo powder in, and Draco picked Harry up and walked through the floo. Narcissa, Lucius, and Severus followed right after, and they ended up in the lobby at St. Mungos. Draco was talking to the receptionist with Harry in his arms.
Draco slowly peeled Harry’s fingers off from around his wrist and watched as his fingers tried to grip something in comfort before Draco entwined his fingers with Harry’s and they relaxed. Draco held that hand to his chest as he wrapped his other arm around Harry. He watched Harry sleep until his eyes finally drooped closed.
“What?” Draco asked.
“Yes, but you know my point. I was Harry Potter, the boy who lived, what do you think the rumors would have been if I got sorted into Slytherin. But I’ve lived up to my Gryffindor rep.” Harkin smiled.
“He’s going to be alright?” Hermione asked as she ran up to Draco, and she wrapped her arms around him.
“Yeah, a bit.” Draco stated. “Why didn’t you want to be in Slytherin?”
Draco stared at her, and didn’t know what to say. She was beautiful. “What? Is it bad?” Harry asked as she stepped closer to Draco. “Because I can change into another one if you don’t like it.”
“You two are two separate people and at the same time one person.” Severus responded. “You appear as two separate people, but everything that matters, your magic, your knowledge, your emotions, you share. It explains how you can calm each other down, know things that the other knows, it’s how Draco can know about a place that is under the Fidelius Charm without being told. He knows where it is because you know where it is.” Severus stated with a smile.
The next thing Draco knows is he’s being shaken awake, and he jumps with a start pulling his wand to find him pointing it at his father. “Well, it’s good to know that your reflexes have improved, but I would rather if you would find another place to point your wand.” Lucius drawled, and Draco rolled his eyes before tucking his wand back into his pocket, and he looked down to see Harkin startled awake lying on the bed next to him.
Meanwhile, Harry is trapped in his mind with his worst fears. Some Harry hadn’t realized were still there he just always pushed past them. He was currently stuck back in his cupboard unable to reach the doorknob to get out. He was five years old again, and he was still afraid of the dark. The Dursley’s had started keeping him in the cupboard after he put grew his crib, and he could now get out without of the crib without trouble, which is why a bed was put in the cupboard under the stairs and it was dark under there. No matter where he looked it was darkness and he couldn’t escape it until Aunt Petunia let him out into the morning to cook their breakfast. No matter how hard he tried he couldn’t reach the door knob, not even on his trippy toes, and then Harry realized something. He had a bed in here, and he turned around and climbed onto the bed and reached for the doorknob, just barely reaching it but he could now get out of the darkness.
“They cry.” McGonagall stated.
“McGonagall gave you permission.”
“Now what did I hear about guardianship?” Sirius asked.
“Listen, listen.” He said. “I understand there has been a lot of commotion this meal, but it is time for bed, so pip pip.” Dumbledore stated, and everyone stood to leave and headed to their respective common rooms.
“No, I can’t watch my cousin hiding in the shadows of his life. We’ll do this Sirius. No matter how much we didn’t get along before, we’re going to be closer, since you’re Harry’s technical guardian.” Narcissa said as she walked up to the fireplace. “Lucius, can you go see the minister about Sirius’ release, and about getting his job back, you were always a good Auror. If you want to go back that is, you don’t have to.”
“Alright time to go home with Grandma Annie, my little teddy bear.”
“I understand. Good-bye, Arthur.
“Your bathroom is bigger than my bedroom at Private Drive.” Harry started, and Draco pulled her into the room and over to the bathtub.
“Yes, Master Harry’s cloak Tally can find.”
“Both. So, I have been talking to Fred and George more since the summer, and they have been snooping at Diagon Alley spaces for their new Joke Shop, using the money that you gave them from winning the Triwizard Tournament, and they heard that a new restaurant is going in a few stalls down from where they are looking to put their joke shop. So, Fred asked me to be his date, they want to be friendly neighbors.” Hermione squeed, and Harkin smiled at her.
“Oh, Lucius. He’s a teenage boy, I’m pretty sure we have done the same thing in that very alcove when we were in school. Your parents didn’t care though and we never got caught. He’s in love, Lucius. Let him figure it out on his own.”
“Wait,” Harry said as he pulled back and looked Draco in the eyes as what he said finally sank in. “Your parents already know that your bi, when did you tell them that?” Harry asked as Draco tried to kiss him again, but Harry pushed him away. “Draco, answer me, please. How long have your parents known this?”
“But you called her a mudblood and sent her running to James.” Sirius stated.
“I say we put off the second option for a few days, try and figure out what it can be.” Hermione said. “If only we had a Ravenclaw that could give us a hint as to what of Ravenclaw’s would be of importance that would attract Voldemort.”
“Draco, you just commented on your pregnant girlfriend’s weight. I don’t think so.” Blaise stated from across from them.
“Draco, I know you are a teenage boy, and sex is going to happen and I won’t say anything against that, but I wouldn’t be a mother if I wasn’t worried and concerned. Please tell me you are using protection spells.”
“Yes, he is. Harry, I want you to tell you that if you are pregnant, I don’t care if you keep the baby. I’ve always wanted to be a grandma, but you also have to think about how that baby is going to be taken care of until you and Draco are out of school. By the time you have this baby you’ll have two more complete years of school not to mention your NEWTs. Lucius and I will help as best we can, but I won’t be raising this baby until you both are done with school.” Narcissa stated.
Once out of the Great Hall, he made a beeline for the closest bathroom, and he closed himself in the stall and vomited into the toilet. He felt like he had just emptied his stomach of the food that he had just put in his stomach. After a while he was just reaching for he had long emptied his stomach. He heard someone knock on the stale door, and he turned to open the door and found it open.
“Sev, I don’t care. If Draco isn’t here, I won’t be able to carry them to term, or keep myself alive anyway. Ron will finally understand what happens when you try and tear us apart.” Harkin stated, and she pulled out her wand and stepped around Severus and Draco towards Ron. “You wanted your best friend back, that was the wrong way to do it. Even if you were aiming for me, bad move, Ronald. Now set your sister free because I don’t want to hurt her.” Harkin stated as she lifted her wand.
“Yeah, same here.” Draco said as he stepped out of Blaise’s way and side stepped the boy, and he walked back to his bed and opened his trunk. He started pulling on his school uniform, and when he finished he reached in the trunk and pulled out Harry’s cloak and stuffing it in his pocket, and he did the same with Harry’s trunk. No matter how much warding he placed on his belongings he didn’t trust Harry’s things to be safe here.
“I don’t know, I just dreamed it. Now answer my question.”
“She is the one that caused this. My dad wouldn’t be lying in that bed because of a snake attack if she hadn’t gone to the Ministry that day. If she hadn’t gone with that stupid snake.” Ron said.
“I agree.” Harkin stated as she looked at Draco.
“How is she doing? Mother and I have been meaning to go over and talk to her to reconcile, but just haven’t had the time.”
“I can explain but I need one thing first and that is what you are going to go and get for me. I didn’t get all the information when I went after you, and I want to find out what I missed and there is a way that we can find that out by finding this object.”
“Father is in Azkaban. Why?”
“Well, both of your vitals are better than when you walked in. way better, actually. Most patients wouldn’t be doing this well, but now comes the hard part, I want to separate you for an hour and check your vitals at the end of the hour and see if that effects your recovery. Narcissa,” Healer Johnson said with a nod towards Narcissa, and Narcissa took Draco’s arms and helped him off the table. Draco protested at first, but then Harry pulled him in for a kiss and whispered something in his ear. Draco nodded and allowed his mother to pull him from the room.
“95%?” Draco questioned with a chuckle.
“I love it when you order me around.” Harry started moving again, thrusting himself in and out of Draco. Draco arched his back and his abdomen and erection pushed against Harry’s abdomen. Harry arched his back into Draco’s erection as his slick cock brushed against Harry’s bare skin. “Dray, I-I think I’m almost there. I’m almost going to-to cum. I’m nearly there, Dray.” Harry started thrusting faster as he came closer and closer to cumming. Harry came after Draco’s cum splattered their abdomens; after Harry came inside of Draco he pulled out, and he laid down beside Draco on his bed.
“Anyway. I will be back daily to do a quick check up until you head back to school then it will be weekly. Understood?” Melody said.
“It is alright, dear. I should think you will be fine by this afternoon, and you can leave for afternoon classes if you have any.” Harry flopped back on the bed, and her hair spread out around her head like a flower. Madam Pomfrey pulled out her wand and pointed it at Harry, and started casting some spells. When she was finished, she put it away and said, “You are in perfect health, and after a few more hours of sleep I feel you can head back to class. There seems to be no permanent damage done, but that may have something to do with the fact that this physical form is caused by a potion. Which I have not heard back from my colleagues yet. I’m sorry, dear.”
“Yes, Draco, they can come in. Just no one can see you inside this compartment. There are some massive wards around this compartment.” Narcissa stated, and she left the compartment.
“Why not your father?” Remus asked.
“I’ve got to go, fawn.” Sirius stated, and Harkin’s eyebrows drew together.
“She was going to figure it out eventually. I was just hoping we would be able to revile in the secrecy for a little while longer.” Draco smirked and looked at Pansy. “So, you figured it out. Took you a while longer than usual. Harry’s been out of the hospital wing since this morning, Pans.” Draco stated.
“Yeah.” Draco nodded at Neville, and they started slowly going through the potion step by step, and by the end of class. Neville had made the potion without it blowing up, spilling over or a combination of the two. He hadn’t made a perfect potion but it was definitely an improvement.
“And I think you’re missing mine.” Draco stated after a long moment of panting and silence. Harry pulled back completely, and looked Draco in the eyes.
“Can I bring Hermione?”
“I’m almost there. Promise.” Narcissa said as she turned towards he son. “A few weeks into school I got sick, or I thought I was, so I went to the hospital with to figure out what was wrong. Turns out your father missed one of the protection spells while we were in France, and I ended up pregnant.”
“I’ll talk to her be right back.” Draco unfurled himself from Harry and pulled the blanket up over him, and he was out of the room and standing casually next to the portrait of the Fat Lady as Ginny ran crying up to the portrait. “You know neither of us had any choice in this right. I didn’t want to become a vampire, and accidentally feed on Harry and have him for the rest of my undead life. That wasn’t the plan, but it’s the cards I was dealt, and I can guarantee Harry feels the same way. Both of us though, or at least I am going to embrace the new life that I have. I was going to be content in my feeling, and just watch silently as the person I knew I loved married and had children with his wife. I was going to hope that I could grow out of my silly crush on Harry Potter and live my own life. I knew how I felt, and I could deal with the fact that he loved you, Ginny. But now I have him, and I’m not letting him go. I just hope that you can do what I was going to do for you, and just let him be happy. That’s all I want is for him to be happy.” Draco started walking away, and he turned back towards her with his hands in his pockets. “I just hope that that is what you want as well, because if it’s not, I’m taking him away, and you won’t see him again until your funeral. I don’t want him to be unhappy, and I will do everything in my power to make sure he is, even if that means taking him away from all of the people he knows and cares about. I don’t think he would mind traveling, do you?” at that Draco walked away, and back to the Hospital Wing. He found Harry asleep on the bed that he left him on and he curled up next to him and fell asleep as well.
“Lily’s and my friendship didn’t end well. I had said something that I didn’t meaning the heat of an argument and she never spoke to me again. That was shortly before graduation, and she married your father soon after. I obviously became a death eater, and then there was the prophecy and the dark lord thought it was about you. That was when I switched sides. Lily and I may have split ways not on good terms, but I couldn’t be a part of the reason she was dead. Though she ended up dead anyway. I ask Dumbledore if I could take care of you after Black was arrested, but he said you were safer with Petunia. She never liked me so she wouldn’t let me in to check and make sure you were alright. I had to know, you were a part of Lily.”
“Excuse me.” Harkin said before she ran out of the room covering her mouth, and she hurried to the nearest bathroom. She barely made it inside the room before she threw the toilet seat up before, she threw up the food that she just ate, and when she was done, she felt Draco’s fingers brush her hair back and then his arms wrapped around her waist.
“Alright.” Remus agreed as Sirius pulled him back to the couch and onto his lap.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, and Lucius no doubt had a hand in those rumors along with Abraxas, Lucius’ father. They like people thinking things about them that aren’t true. I just brush all the rumors off like no one said anything. You should too, my dear. Most of the things people tell and say about the Malfoy’s are false. This family has been around since the beginning of Magic. They learned to adapt to the rumors that spread.” Narcissa said as she took Harry’s hand and pulled her farther into the floral.
“How long have you known that you were…” Draco trailed off as Harry smiled at him.
“Okay I was wrong, she’s just fearless.”
“Merlin, yes. Fred and I developed that skill ages ago.”
“I didn’t say you had to attend classes just that you could stay in your normal rooms, Miss Granger. Miss Lovegood, your things are waiting for you in your room. Go now please.” Snape said as he escorted them out of his office and down the staircase. “Miss Granger, the password is Savior. McGonagall is being sentimental.” He then walked to an unoccupied bedroom and laid Harry on the bed. He placed wards around the bed so in case Harry somehow woke up from the stasis he would be alerted, and he walked out of the room and placed heavy wards around the room that would let no one inside or even see the door unless they knew it was there.
“I don’t spend that much, father. I have money saved up over the years. Like I said, I’m not as stupid as you seem to think I am.” Draco stated as he pulled away from the door, and he glanced at his father. “I’m not the little boy you can push around, father.”
“Draco?” Lucius questioned.
Draco was awoken by someone pounding on the door. Draco not giving a shit, lifted his wand canceled the silencing charm, unlocked the door and swung the door open. Someone burst into the room, and all Draco saw was a blur of red hair.
“You? Lily left you as her guardian?” Sirius asked in disbelief.
Remus spun Harkin around the dance floor in a few circles, making Harkin giggle until they were off the dance floor, and Remus took her hand. “Can I talk to you in private, please? Siri wanted you to have something before you got married.”
“For always being there for me. I know it’s your job as my mother, but I’ve never been an easy child. I want to apologize for that.”
“M-move, p-p-please.” Harkin panted as her finger nails dug into Draco’s forearms, and he groaned as her nails scratched down his arms causing small angry red lines in their path. Draco started thrusting into her at a steady pace, and Harkin’s fingers reached Draco’s hands, Draco took her hands and pinned them above her head as he leaned into his thrusts. Harkin’s legs were digging into Draco’s back, arse, and the back of his thighs. Draco moaned as he moved closer to the table, and his angle changed, and Harkin gasped as he moved just right inside her. “R-right t-t-there.” Harkin moaned as her head slammed into the table as her back arched and she came, and she squeezed around Draco causing him to gasp and cum inside her.
Draco watched as his mother walked out of the room, and he turned back towards Harkin. “Did my mother pretty much just give us permission to have sex on the dining room table?” Draco questioned.
“Blaise and Pansy can still join us, right?” Draco asked.
“Why? I was a boy two months ago.” Harry commented.
“I don’t have to go back to the Dursley’s?” Harry asked, not wanting to get her hopes up.
“Draco, it’s not that I’m doubting that you love me, it’s just…” Draco tugged on Harry’s newly forming erection, cutting off his sentence.
“Fine I will talk to my mother about it when she gets home, and I’m Nymphadora Tonks, but you can call me Tonks. Who may you two be?”
“I’m giving you a week before I tell Minerva, that you aren’t going. I don’t care what you do with that week, but I’m giving you a week. Good night, Harry.” Hermione gave Harry a hug and a kiss before she turned and left the room. Harry could hear the fireplace as she walked through the floo. Harry walked down to the living room as there was a knock on his front door.
“Hey, Harry. You gave me quite a scare there, Potter.” Draco said as he leaned forwards and took Harry’s hand in both of his.
“Yes, but now that you are engaged you move to his right. You know that she cannot be sitting on your lap at dinner tomorrow, right?”
“It’s alright, Ron. I don’t blame you; I was just waiting for you to make the first move. I don’t mind. I have gotten a lot of work done on the house over the summer. I have the main floor completely renovated and the fourth floor is completely done as well. The house is more colorful and open. It’s not as gloomy as it was before when it was the Order headquarters. Ask Hermione, she helped me reorganize the library last week.”
“Fine, but I’m reading this letter to make sure there isn’t any funny business.”
“Uncle Sev, what are you on about?” Draco whispered.
“I’m sorry I made it more of a competition for you.” Draco apologized.
“I’m tired, are you?” Harry asked.
Draco smiled back, and entwined their fingers together. “Yes, I did. I didn’t see who did this to you, either, so I’m really hoping that you do.”
“Draco, it’s nothing to be ashamed of it’s a nice sized penis.” Narcissa as Draco buried his face in his hands.
“Miss Harkin Potter. How can Dobby help you?”
“Do you need something, Cissa?” Harkin asked.
“So you’re saying that a woman did this to her.”
“Dray, you’re not leaving me right? Because everyone I cares about ends up leaving me.”
Mipsy helped Harry into a corset and then the dress that she was going to wear for the day. It was a knee length, silver dress, and Harry didn’t know how she was going to last wearing just dresses for the rest of her life, or at least her time in his presence.
“Severus and I will go get her, and bring her home. I promise, Dragon.” Narcissa said as she brushed his hair out of his face to kiss his forehead.
Draco and Harry went back to Draco’s room, and he pulled Harry into his arms. Then Draco remembered something as he stared at his trunk in the corner of the room. “Harry, I feel I should tell you that Arthur’s in the hospital.”
“First, teenage boy. Second, a have a beautiful girl to shag and in my bathtub. Third, I’m a wizard.”
“No, I’m not, but I think you do deserve everyone an explanation.” Draco stated, and Harkin sighed as she sat up a little straighter against Draco as Narcissa stayed crouched in front of her.
In the doorway stood Blaise Zabini. “Draco, Pansy wanted me to get you so we could head down for diner, but I see you are in the middle of something.”
“Where have you two been? Dinner’s over, but luckily you have an awesome best friend, Harry, who brings you food when you don’t show up to dinner after not eating for a few days. And Draco, you are lucky that I am observant to notice that your two best friends didn’t even compile you any plates of food and brought you some, too.” Hermione pulled ten covered plates out of her bag and set them on Harry’s bed. “And I don’t want to know what distracted you two since you both came out of the bathroom, together.” Hermione huffed and stormed out of the room.
“But Christmas is tomorrow.” Harkin said as tears started to slide down her face.
“Not much, Mrs. Malfoy. I’m not very good at Herbology. I’m passing only because of Hermione. Why do you ask?”
Harry woke up the next morning to find Draco wrapped around her and Ron and Hermione standing at the end of the bed. Harry buried her face in Draco’s chest and tried to go back to sleep, but she felt Draco’s finger tips against her cheek, and she turned her face up towards Draco. His eyes were open and on her; he just smirked and she knew what he meant.
“He was wearing the locket? Why would you foolish children wear a Horcrux? They aren’t just simple light magic, they are the darkest dark magic we have in the Wizarding world and you are wearing it like it’s jewelry.”
“What happened to Voldemort and his followers?”
“Well, I’ve heard of it. It is one of Mother’s familial homes as well.” Draco stated.
“Harry, you just stunned my mother!”
“Perfect, just like her mother.” Draco said as he laid back down and pulled Harkin into his arms.
“Ha, because all that has ever given me is pity, and nothing done about it.”
“Draco, what are you do…Merlin, Draco, you could have just told me to leave? Who’s the lucky bloke?” Pansy shouted through the door.
“What do I have the means to destroy?”
“I promise, my dear. I won’t tell anyone.” Narcissa sat in shock at Harry’s outburst but wasn’t surprised. People reacted different to certain things. “Well, the party is about to start so I better finish up.” Narcissa said as she continued with Harry’s hair and make-up. When she was done, they stood up and started for the door when Harry stopped her.
“Well, since I’m awake anyway.” Harry whispered and she bit her lower lip with a small smirk on her lips.
“What if I don’t want to leave this?”
“Draco, I just want to make sure that this is what you want, because if your parents do find out do you think that they will be alright with this. Dray, can you deal with the consequences of us. What will your parents say, Dray? I can’t be the reason that you are disowned, if you are disowned.” Harry rested his hand on Draco’s cheek, and he leaned closer to Draco and rested his forehead back against Draco’s. “Can you deal with that if you stay with me, Dray?”
“So, uh. Is there anything else that I need to know?”
“Did Mr. Malfoy really put Harry in the position to be kidnapped by your insane sister?” Hermione asked.
“Ginny please don’t interfere; I don’t want to hurt you.” Harkin stated, and Ginny actually took a couple steps towards Draco and Severus before running down the stairs completely. “Thank you.” Harkin whispered, and she softened a little. “Ready for a real duel, Ronald. We’ve never dueled before so this will be interesting.” Harkin smirked, and Ron took a shy step in her direction, so they were on level ground. Ron nodded a quick nod before firing off a handful of spells, all of which, Harkin easily deflected and practically absorbed. Ron stared in shock for a moment at the sight, and Harkin smirked, she didn’t know that was a thing. Harkin then did the same, sending of a flourish of non-lethal spells in Ron’s direction; she could send them off just a little quicker than Ron’s skill of being able to deflect, and he fell. Harkin then just turned and started walking back over to Draco, but then felt a small prick in her side. She reached down, and when she pulled her hand back there was a small trail of blood running down her side. “Sev,” she whispered, before she collapsed, and Severus caught her.
“Of course.” Harry smiled as Lucius walked over to the fireplace in his office and disappeared through the flames, and Harry turned towards Sirius and smiled.
“Hai.” Teddy attempted.
“Dray, if you keep doing that there is no way I can ever say no to you. Just keep doing what you are doing, Dray, I can’t stop you, not now not ever.” Harry moaned as Draco sunk his teeth into his collarbone, and Draco pulled out his wand and put a silencing charm on the room. Draco continued on Harry’s collarbone, leaving a nice bruise across Harry’s collarbone. Harry ran his hands down Draco’s back and found the hem of his shirt and pulled it over Draco’s head, and Draco continued kissing Harry’s neck and then started kissing his way up Harry’s neck and back to his lips.
sorry about not updating in so long had writers block some of you probably know how that goes, but got a couple of chapters lined up so hopefully i can get this finished soon.
Draco practically growled.
“You have to ask, Mione?” Harry stated.
“I don’t think so, but wouldn’t he have said something if he did?”
“Where do you think?” Harry said as he smirked at Draco while still pulling Draco with him. Once Draco realized what Harry was saying, he started pulling Harry at a run. It was for the better, because Harry doesn’t exactly remember where the common room was because he was passed out in Draco’s arms the night before. They reached the door and Draco said the password and pulled Harry through the common room luckily everyone was either in class or not there as Draco headed across the room to the doorway on the right. They headed up a spiral staircase and then down the hall at the top of the stairs.
“Exactly. He didn’t kill Dumbledore even with his family’s lives in danger, Snape did…”
“I’ve never kissed anyone before.” Harry shyly whispered as she turned her head sideways to try and hide the blush.
“Now can you leave? I’ve had enough of memory lane tonight.”
“For the ones that I lost and wishing that they were happy where ever they were now, and the hope that in the end I will see them again.” Harry pushed with all his might the memories of Sirius and the few memories he had of his parents towards Voldemort.
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asked.
. I went back to Harry’s childhood, where I found quite a few injuries caused by her relatives and then I found the cause for the current injuries she has, but I’m going to start with the past.
“I wouldn’t have come this far not to go the rest of the way, please, Dray.” Harry moaned as she slowly stroked Draco’s length, and Draco captured her lips and thrusted inside her without warning. She gasped into his lips before moaning, and her legs wrapped around Draco as he trusted inside her. Gasps and moans escaped her lips as Draco continued and his lips moved from her lips and down her neck to her collarbone to finally stop at her breast. Harry dug her nails into Draco’s shoulder and slowly dragged them down his back erecting a small scream from Draco as he quickened his pace.
“Merlin, why is it so hot in here?” Lucius stated, and that answered Draco’s question, but from the look on Severus’ face he knew the answer and he was staring at Draco and Harry.
“Let’s stop talking about the worst possibility. We don’t even know the answer to these questions that you need to ask.”
“I can’t go any farther, Harry.”
“I… um… said that out loud? I’m sorry I didn’t mean to.” Harry whispered, and she turned around.
“I’m fine, I think. Just got a little dizzy.” Harkin whispered, and Hermione was about to say something, when Harkin collapsed, and Draco barely caught her.
“What?” Sirius asked confused.
“Hell, even if I wasn’t I would have let you and enjoyed it. Do you want to fuck me, Draco?” Harry asked as he looked and observed their erections sitting next to each other. Draco responded by shifting so his legs were underneath Harry lifting Harry’s hips onto his lap. Draco took his wand and cast a couple of spells on Harry and then a lubrication charm on his fingers. Draco’s first finger pushed into Harry’s entrance causing Harry to hiss, and Draco pushed the finger in and out. Draco leaned forwards so his lips were next to Harry’s ear.
“What, sir?” Harry and Draco said simultaneously.
“Dray, we have the rest of our lives to play out those fantasies of yours.” Harry whispered as he brought his lips up to right next to Draco’s ear, and he started kissing Draco’s neck, which turned into sucking. Draco pushed Harry back slightly pushing him up against the shower wall, and Harry’s lips detached from Draco’s neck. Draco leaned in and started kissing Harry’s lips. Draco rolled his hips forwards and ground his erection into Harry’s causing a groan to escape Harry’s lips. “You tease!” Harry shouted, and then they heard the door open.
“Yeah, I think we do. Do you want to go look?” Draco asked as he stood up with Harry still wrapped around his waist. Harry giggled as Draco carried her to the door, and she stopped him before he opened the door.
“No it doesn’t, but I digress again.” Narcissa stated.
“But he is right in front of us?” McGonagall pointed out.
“We get rid of the last piece of the Dark Lord and quickly. My guess is this is a result of the Dark Lord still being inside him and torturing him still. Minerva head up to the seventh floor and help with the search and take as many teachers as you can. Potter is still in danger.”
Soon class ended though, and Draco would soon find out. Harkin packed up her bag and saw as Draco did not. “Dray, what’s wrong?” she asked as everyone filed out of the room, but Draco just sat in his seat.
“Because your connection to the Dark Lord is gone, but he still knows your mind Potter. He isn’t gone not until the last Horcrux is gone. You are in terrible danger. The Dark Lord’s body has been destroyed thanks to Narcissa and Draco, but that just means his soul can latch onto something familiar. You, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh, cousin Sirius, how are you?” Narcissa asked as she pulled Draco towards the shouting man, who stopped yelling and turned towards Narcissa.
“Well, I have a theory. Because Draco’s and my cores are intertwined you are feeling the familiarity of Draco’s magic core. Mothers are more intoned to their child’s magical core because they lived with it inside them for nine months or so. It is also why children are closer to their mother’s more often than their fathers.” Harkin stated, and Narcissa just stared at her.
“No, Professor, not at all. I was talking to Harry about the potion that caused his appearance. I just wanted to let her know that I’m on her side if she needs my help. Do you need anything else, Professor?”
“Hadn’t gotten around to telling her yet.” Harkin muttered, and Draco’s attention was back on her.
“Really, that is hard to believe. I kind of feel bad about taking advantage of you. You’ve never experienced anything sex related until today.”
“Sirius left.” Remus stated.
Harry and Draco turned towards each other and looked into each other’s eyes, and they both saw the same thing sitting beyond the irises of the other’s eyes. Want. Draco didn’t know what to do if he should lean in and kiss Harry or if he should just wait and see, but Harry was thinking close to the same thing. Harry just leaned in and kissed Draco. The moment their lips met Draco rolled over so he was on top of Harry, and Harry was trying to pull Draco closer to him.
“Holy shit.” Hermione whispered.
“Are you… are we… dating?” Harry whispered the last word like she was afraid of the answer and couldn’t get herself to say it any louder.
“Tell me if it gets too tight.” Draco stated, and Harkin nodded. Draco started lacing up the back of her dress, and when Harkin sucked in a breath, Draco loosened the laces a little and then finished tying it. When he stepped away, she turned around, and Draco gasped. “You look beautiful.” Draco whispered, and Harkin blushed.
“Yes, now follow it.” Draco heard him say, and he stood up and walked away whispering thank you under his breath as he focused on the magic. He followed it until he was standing in the middle of the Quidditch pitch and he released the magic. Draco turned and looked around, and then up and he found Harry circling above. Draco walked over to the broom shed, and he changed into a practice uniform and grabbed his broom. He walked out of the shed and took flight, and in the process, he almost got clobbered by Harry who was zipping past to catch the snitch.
“Alright, let’s go. We don’t want my mother to blame you for something that is my fault again. Let’s get dressed and maybe we can go out and do something,” Draco stated and then he leaned in and kissed Harry’s lips. Draco pulled Harry out of the shower, and they both started getting dressed. When they stepped out of the bathroom, Narcissa was standing there waiting for them.
“Harry will be more difficult to help, but it’s possible. But if given the extremely wrong answer Harry can slip into a coma and slowly drain of all of his magical essence, slowly dying as everything that makes him who he is drains out of him. After that he will either die a very painful death, or will wake up not having any memory of who he is, what he’s done, and a muggle.”
“I agree, because even if he’s drained and forgets everything and becomes a muggle that might be a fate worse than death. He could still regain his memories, and he could realize what he’s supposed to be and not be able to be that person.”
“Severus?” McGonagall questioned.
“Yes, father. I promise.” Lucius walked out of the room and fixed the door as he did so. Both the boys let out a small sigh as the door fixed and closed behind Lucius. “That was close.” Draco walked over and looked Harry in the eyes. “He didn’t see anything right?”
“Hey, babe,” Draco said as he stroked Harry’s hair out of his face. “Are you afraid of my mother?” Draco teased as he thread his fingers into Harry’s hair, and he pulled Harry’s hair backwards. He sat up and he kissed Harry’s neck, pulling Harry closer to him. Draco rolled slightly so he was half on top of Harry but also half off of him. Draco continued kissing and sucking on Harry’s neck, and Harry moaned as Draco slipped his leg between his and applied a little pressure to his erection. Draco pulled away from Harry and looked him in the eyes as he applied more pressure to Harry’s erection. “Because if you are, you really shouldn’t be. My mother couldn’t hurt a fly, and the only way she could hurt someone is not by having sex with her son. Plus my mother knew that we would do this even if she told us that we should be careful in someone else’s home. She knew, Babe, so don’t worry. Relax.”
“That’s fine, Narcissa. We’ve got it from here, and you and your son are safe, and as soon as Lucius in incarcerated the Malfoy estate and vaults will be transferred to your son.”
Harry ran his hand up to Draco’s cheek and rested his hand there. “Draco, you may want to protect me, try not to. See what happened to all the other people that tried to protect me. My parents are dead; Sirus is pretty much dead; Dumbledore is old and who knows how long he has before he croaks; I don’t want to lose you Draco, so please, for me, stop trying to protect me. I could care less about everyone else, but I want you to stay in my life, Draco; I don’t need anyone else if I have you,” Harry stated as his thumb slowly rubbed back and forth against Draco’s cheek.
“I don’t know. She was fine, and then she just fainted.” Draco stated trying to hold himself together for Harkin's sake.
“I help Professor Snape tutor the younger years. Now if you excuse me I have to go check on someone.”
“Thank you, Dray, for reminding me. Family is sadly something that I don’t know much about, and I forget how it works sometimes. I love you.” She whispered.
“Okay.” Draco said as he scooped Harry up in his arms and she started giggling as he carried her over his shoulder out of the library.
“As many as you want.” Draco stated. “Though we should head to class, we don’t want to be late. Severus can only give us so many passes without becoming suspicious.” Draco finished as he grabbed her hand and pulled her from their rooms. Harkin giggled as they hurried down the staircases to the dungeons, and they made it just in time, for Severus was just closing the door to the classroom as they came up.
“My sanctuary is the Malfoy’s indoor garden. It’s been taken care of by every wife of a Malfoy for as long as the Malfoy’s have lived here. I’m going to show you how to be the wife of a Malfoy, and this garden is where everything starts. Lucius’ mother, rest her soul, had been teaching me to groom the garden since I was eight years old.”
“How the hell do you know it was my elf? All my elves are at the Manor with my parents. I don’t use them here. Why would I?” Draco asked as Pansy walked up behind him to help steady him.
“The day I got back from break, or well the day after I guess. When she woke up, it was a heat of the moment thing. I didn’t plan it. I wanted to court her, like dad did with you.” Draco stated, and Narcissa chuckled.
“Dray, it is for the better.” She whispered to him.
“Wait, doesn’t this spell only take into account half of what this spell here does, so don’t we need another spell that can counter the other half of this spell.” Draco said as he pointed at a couple of the spells on the list. Madam Pomfrey looked it over and then commented.
“Oh, all of your little friends are in tacked, Potter. I didn’t want to hurt any of them; I wanted to hurt you, Potter.”
“We’re good, Professor. I just wish we were actually here for classes. We’re looking for something, and we need to find it before something bad happens. I won’t talk about it here.”
“That works, I guess.” Hermione said as Remus started moving, and she followed him. They walked for a little while until they heard shouting.
“Draco.” She whispered before pulling him into a hug, and he groaned at the sudden jostling.
“Well, there was the first problem with the Unbreakable Vow I had with Narcissa to do so when Draco could not, and that matter that he asked me to kill him. He was going to be gone within a few months of his death anyway. I contained the spell that was killing him, but it wasn’t going to last forever.”
“Where is he? You must know.”
“Hey, where have you been? You’ve been gone a couple of hours, been breaking mommy’s rules have you?” Tonks joked. Draco and Harry glanced around the room and found that Tonks and her father were the only two people in the room.
“It’s good to see you Seamus, and I am. I’ve kind of been on the run for six months. Harry, Ron and I really haven’t had regular meals like those of you here at Hogwarts. The last real meal I had before Harry got captured was in September.”
“Oh, so you have a whole plan thought out, but you won’t go in and do it. You’re going to send in the child that is precious and should be cherished.”
“Dray…” Harkin whimpered.
Harry felt her eyes well up with tears, but she didn’t let them fall, because she wasn’t giving them that satisfaction. But Nott continued, “I have given your wand to Lucius and he will put it somewhere you will never find it, so if you do escape you will not get far on your own. You are going to do something for the Dark Lord, and then you have one of two choices, one join him or die. I just hope you are smart in your decision, because quite frankly, I think you’re too beautiful to waste.” Nott finished and grabbed a hand full of Harry’s hair and yanked her head back to look at him. Nott’s eyes didn’t leave Harry as he said the next thing. “You are dismissed, Lucius; I’m going to have a little fun with
“I don’t. I had placed a personal tracking charm on Miss Potter after the first disappearance. I didn’t want to guess where she was if something happened, and as of ten minutes ago the trace disappeared completely. Which means Bellatrix is using dark wards.”
“My Lord, I can promise you that that is exactly the truth. I did not give them any information about your plans. I just wanted to protect my son, and the best way to do that was to pretend that I was working for Dumbledore, give my son protection no matter who wins this war. It was a lapse of faith, and I deeply apologize for that lapse in my judgment.” Lucius said with a slight bow from his seat next to Narcissa.
“Mum…”
“Have you thought of names yet? I mean, when are you due anyway?” Pansy questioned, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Author's Notes
“Potter, what did you get out of bed for? You need sleep to regain your energy. Now, you’ve just drained all that you had gained.” Malfoy scooped Harry into his arms, and carried him over to his bed. “Do you not remember anything from last night?”
“I thought you were asleep, dragon.” Narcissa said as she moved over to the side of the bed that Draco was on.
“It’s fine, Remi. I understand. Most people still see me as Harry Potter. They don’t see me as the girl who I am now, and I’m kind of scared to go back to Hogwarts, Remi. I don’t know how they are going to react to me being engaged to Draco, and on top of it carrying his baby inside me. Which is why I know why Lucius wants to keep it a secret for now, but I don’t know how I’m going to keep a secret when I start to show.” Harkin stated.
“I understand that, but my dad got hurt because you couldn’t have your boyfriend lose his parents. My dad who has been like a father to you for five years, and he got hurt. How do you expect me to react, Harry?” Ron yelled and Harry flinched. Draco pulled her closer and she buried her face in his chest.
“Alright, when can I get out of here?”
“You are the second person to tell me that today.”
“Harry was your first.” Lupin said causing Granger to spin around and stare at him. The entire Weasley clan did the same.
“Granger, I have invited you into my home, is that anyway to thank me for that. I could have left you outside the wards wondering if my father was torturing Harry in the dungeons or not.” Draco said as he casually looked at his nails.
“You just…” Draco started, but then trailed off.
“We will take this information into account while we investigate this incident, Mr. Malfoy.” At that moment, Professor Umbridge strolled into the hospital wing.
The next chapter is where I'm going to bring Harry's female name into play. i had to rewrite this chapter a little to get the set up for it, but I've figured it out. i hope you enjoyed the chapter. i feel like the next couple of chapters are a little rushed, but i didn't know how else to write it and sound alright, so i hope you enjoyed this chapter, and the next ones will be posted when i get a few more chapters written.
“Ready to go, boys?” Narcissa asked as she took Draco’s hand, and Draco had Harry’s hand.
“Cissy, I would love to but I’m technically not even supposed to be outside right now. Being an escaped criminal and all.” Sirius whispered.
“What if it’s too painful to go back? I lost everything there, Hermione. Ginny won’t speak to me, Ron won’t speak to me, no one who were friends with me before can look at me the same, Hermione. I just want to fix up Grimmauld Place and live my life out quietly, with Andromeda and Teddy here with me.” Harry said as he went through the books on the shelves. Pulling them off the shelves, dusting them off, and setting them in the piles on the floor, while Hermione organized them.
“Mom, we don’t even know if Harry can get pregnant.” Draco said.
“Harry, you have no memory of the past five months.”
“I’m not. I’ve had suspicions for years, but I’ve never been able to prove it, and Harry doesn’t talk about it. You must have done something amazing to get anything out of her.”
“You can walk and talk yes?” Draco asked and Harry nodded with an eye roll. “Then we shall talk as we go.” Draco took her hand and wrapped it into the crook of his elbow and took both of their bags and swung them over his other shoulder. Draco walked her out of the room, and Harry started fidgeting with the seam in Draco’s shirt. “Harry, just ask.”
“Mom, I just I don’t know what to do. When I’m not around her, I feel like I’ve lost part of myself. Like part of me is missing. I feel like I can’t control myself if she isn’t next to me, and when we touch it’s like electricity runs through my entire being.” Draco stated, and Narcissa could see the passion in his eyes again, like she could when he was younger, before her husband corrupted the innocent boy and formed him into a mini version of himself. Draco was her little dragon again, and she wrapped her arms around her confused son.
“Who?” she asked, and then Draco groaned.
“How are you going to get through a school day, love, if you can’t go half an hour without me touching you?”
“So the most important part of his life could be taken away.”
“I only correct the speech that matters, and that’s calling me dad and Andromeda mom. Other than that we can correct his speech when he gets older to understand the difference.”
“Well, him and your aunt.”
“Yes, Master Draco.” The house elf said and the she disappeared with a crack. Draco then shrank Harry’s truck down and slipped it into his pocket, and he looked around the room and saw how bare the room looks now compared to when he walked in. Draco picked up Harry’s shrunken trunk, and he slipped it in his pocket and left the way he came. He headed back down to the Slytherin common, and when he got there, he went straight to his room, and placed the shrunken trunk in his own trunk.
“Do you want to dance with him to cheer him up?” Draco asked.
“Rahr.” Teddy expressed, and Harry laughed.
“Don’t look at me like that. I don’t like hospitals. If you knew somethings about me you would understand.” Harry muttered and curled into a ball, and that’s when the screaming started. Harry clamped his hands over his ears and curled tighter into a ball. He was out of his head, he was safe; why was the screaming back.
“May I ask where Mr. Potter is?”
“I know, love, and the only thing that I can do is make sure that you live the happiest that you can be from here on out. You are my priority, love, and I love you; I will for the rest of my life.”
“What? Not her bloody sister. If you say her sister I’ll hex you.”
“It was mostly Hermione. I just had gather the ingredients. Nothing too exciting or extravagant.” Harry stated as she pulled her arm out of Malfoy’s grasp. “I rather don’t like manhandling if you could refrain from doing that in the future I’d greatly appreciate it.”
“I would love to see my healer, and my healer is Healer Johnson. Now, how would she feel if she found out that the Malfoy’s were left waiting in the lobby in an emergency?”
“Draco, tell me what happened.” Remus insisted.
“We are going ring shopping.”
“What did Granger and Andromeda mean that you would have come to the same conclusion about Ginny eventually?” Harry was taken aback by this question, and he opened his mouth to close it again. “You ended your relationship with her for Teddy’s sake I understand that, but I just want to understand.”
The two boys have been on the team for five years and they are starting their sixth year at Hogwarts and have been inseparable for that entire time even when he was wrongly entered into the Triwizard Tournament in their fourth year, where Draco was upset at first, but eventually became alright with it. In their fifth year, somethings changed, and Harry got very distant for a while. Draco eventually got Harry to open up to him. They slowly got closer and closer to each other, and over the summer after their fifth year, Harry was only at the Dursley’s house for two weeks, before Draco showed up on his front door step with his mother.
“Where’s my mother? I have to talk to her.”
“Well, what?”
“I apologize, Miss Potter. We shouldn’t have pried, but I delivered Draco, and Severus is his godfather. We’ve known Draco since he was a baby, and no one has ever calmed him down like that. It was impressive considering Narcissa was the only one who has ever calmed him, but never as fast as that.”
“You still haven’t told us where he is yet.”
“I had no choice, Ron. I was kidnapped by Voldemort. If I didn’t go he was going to take his anger out on Lucius and Narcissa, and I couldn’t do that. Not to Draco. I couldn’t be the reason he lost his parents. Especially at the hands of Voldemort. Could you do that to Hermione, Ron? Could you do that to anyone be the reason they lost their parents?” Harry asked as she pulled Draco closer to her, and he wrapped his arms around her waist.
“You know what, Malfoy. Where are Harry’s things? I know you have them.”
“What is going on?” Draco asked again.
“What brought this on, dragon?” Narcissa questioned as she pulled Draco back and cradled his face in her hands, and she brushed her thumbs against his cheeks.
“Thanks, mum.” Draco whispered as he pulled Narcissa in for a hug.
Draco watched as his father came back in without his fiancée. “Father, where is she?” Draco asked through clenched teeth.
“Fawn…” Remus tried to fight, but eventually lost the battle and went back to the ball.
Draco started wondering what the hell Severus gave him to give to her, when the magic started to swirl and blow everything that wasn’t the furniture around the room, and Draco pulled Harry closer to him, cradling her in his arms as the magic expanded around them. Draco buried his face in her hair as he held her against his chest. Draco heard the door burst open, and he looked up to see the Dark Lord standing in the door way. The magic swirled around him and pulled him into the room.
Harry struggled out of the dress for the better part of an hour before she walked over to the door to let Narcissa, Lucius, and Snape into the room. “How long did you know we were standing out there?” Snape asked.
“Well, it was, and we didn’t know because you killed Dumbledore before he could give Harry all the facts about them. We didn’t know how to destroy them, what we were up against, nothing but the fact that they were part of his soul and to kill him we had to get rid of them. We figured thigs out along the way do to our stupid actions, but we didn’t know. Even with the books I stole out of Dumbledore’s office because they were the only books in the universe we could find that had information on them because Dumbledore took them out of the library. I’m sorry but when all of our information paths are blocked it’s hard not to make stupid childish mistakes when you are a child.” Hermione said as Ron caught up to them. They had reached the seventh floor and Snape was walking towards his office.
“Not all men are like that, Remi.” Harkin whispered.
“Dray, open your eyes and look at me please.” Harry pleaded. He wanted to see the beautiful eyes that he fell in love with, and made him fall in love with Draco. “Please, Dray.” Harry kissed him again, and then Harry started moving his lips towards Draco’s neck. Harry started sucking on Draco’s neck right above his collarbone. Draco shifted to that motion, and his legs wrapped around Harry’s waist, and his fingers slid up Harry’s sides and into Harry’s hair holding him in place.
Draco didn’t try to get him to repeat it, he just tried to get Harry warm, and eventually, Harry stopped shivering and his legs dropped to the ground. Draco let him go but Harry didn’t. “Love, if you want to stay warm you should probably put on your clothes.”
Okay so i don't know if i'm going to do a sequel to this story yet, because this was a fun story to write. if anything i might do some one-shot sequels here and there when i feel like it. i love Vampire Draco, he's so much fun to write.
“You heard me. Your magic and body didn’t know what to do with the extra DNA, and since your body separated the DNA, one child is your and Draco’s and the other is your and Thaddeus Nott’s.” Melody explained further.
He found Harry lying asleep on the floor next to the bed, and he wondered if he had another nightmare and fell off or if he was trying to get out of bed and fell, hitting his head. Draco was then at his side and he lifted Harry and placed him on the bed. He looked him over for any blood and found none or any scraps of any kind. He sighed of relief and woke Harry up.
“Yeah, you too, Nev. Where’s Seamus?”
Draco waited for Madam Pomfrey to come out with the new list of spells, and when she did she explained what she had figured out. The list looked perfect to Draco, but he could see the hesitation in Madam Pomfrey’s eyes. “Madam Pomfrey, what’s the matter?”
“This is real, Harry. You aren’t in your head anymore. I promise.” Draco whispered as he rested his forehead against Harry’s.
“We aren’t hungry, Mom. We can wait until lunch,” Draco shouted.
“Dray, you have to let me know if this hurts, or otherwise I can’t fix it.” Harry said as he brought his free hand up to Draco’s face making him look at him. “Are you alright?”
“Harry, its September 2nd, 1998. You’re missing five months of your life. That is better than what it could have been, but there’s still a lot of things that you need to catch up on. Luckily, it’s only the second day of the term, and classes really haven’t started yet.”
“Draco, I’m compromised. He will never believe that I am there for him or anything I say for that matter. He will most likely try and break down my walls I’ve successfully built and maintained for 16 years. I have no chance of making it through that. I can’t help her, Draco, but you can. You are a very skilled potions maker. You have the ability to help and save Harry Potter, Draco.” Severus said as he gripped Draco’s shoulders as he stepped away from him, shaking his head.
“Theo, just take me back. Just take me back and I won’t say anything, who was involved nothing. I’ll say I was unconscious the whole time. Please just don’t turn me over to him, please.” Harry begged but that’s when the door opened and another man walked in followed by another. He first man Harry didn’t know, but the second was unmistakable, Lucius Malfoy.
Once the potions were complete he put each into a vile, labeled them, and walked upstairs, and he kept remembering the words Severus said the day before, and he made sure he followed everything Severus wrote down on the parchment he gave him. Draco just hoped that this would work, whatever it was that Severus was planning. Draco was just glad that they had all the ingredients that were needed to brew both potions. Draco stepped into the room that was housing Harry, and he stepped up to the bed for a second time that day, the only difference his mother was by Harry’s side instead of his father.
“I would love to take you up on that offer, but I would have to talk to Remus first.” Sirius said as they all walked out of the room and towards the lobby.
“Har?” Draco whispered as he slipped his shoes off and crouched down next to the tub.
Harkin quietly ate her breakfast, and when she finished the same elf popped in to quickly gather the tray before popping back out. Harkin sighed as the elf left the room again. From that day forwards, Harkin ate alone in her room most days, Draco going through the accounts his father had and sort out the dark accounts from the regular accounts.
“Harry, they might try again, and we aren’t sure what their plans are.”
“She’ll find out eventually, and besides, if either of your parents will be alright with us it would be your mother, right?” Harry whispered back to Draco, and he leaned into Draco’s shoulder and rested his forehead there. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him closer. Narcissa was staring at her son and his friend as they interacted and she just walked over and rested her hand on the back of her son’s head.
They gathered their trunks and owls, and started carrying them out onto the platform. Harry waved to Hagrid as they passed him on the way to the carriages. They climbed into the first carriage as it took off, and the carriage ride was quiet as they drew closer to Hogwarts and stopped at the gate. Harry pulled his things out of the carriage, and up to the castle. He placed his trunk with the rest of the trunks and headed into the Great Hall.
“No, Harry. There was nothing you could have done. Do you want to go see him?”
“Fine with me.” The man walked over and picked up Andromeda, and he marched Harry out of the room. Harry obliged, and then asked, “Can I know your name? I’m curious on which Death Eater I’m going to give credit to for this when they find me dead, because that is what you plan to do, right?”
“You did scream a little bit out, so from that small bit I can take a decent guess as to what the dream was about.” Harkin stated as she just stared him down.
“Yes. Just don’t worry about it too much Harry. Everything will work out somehow, I promise.” Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s. “Are you alright with this, Harry? Because if you aren’t, that’s alright, Harry. Please, just tell me if you aren’t alright with this.”
“You saw my aunt post balloon?” Harry smiled. “Did she shrink any from before she was a balloon, or was she still rather big?” Harry asked.
“May I accompany you to breakfast?” Draco asked as he held out his hand, and Harry was forcing her books and parchment into her bag.
“Dray, why do I pick abusive people to be my friends?” Harkin whispered almost so quiet that Draco couldn’t hear it over the running water. Draco quickly pulled his clothes off so he could pull her into a hug and climbed into the tub with her.
“Severus, maybe this isn’t the best topic to be talking about in front of Draco. I feel it’s not appropriate.” Narcissa struggled for the words as she walked up to her son and wrapped her arms around him.
“Yeah, well, we’re exhausted. Can we head upstairs to get some sleep?”
“I think she is spending too much time with you and your mother. She is getting way to good at hiding her emotions in public.” Severus stated.
“I’m not so certain. Harry’s worst fear as of third year was Dementors. It could go either way. Other than that I’m not sure. Harry doesn’t talk about it often, but once while we were traveling we came across a muggle town that was infested with Dementors, and Harry went in to collect food, but he couldn’t produce a Patronus and when he came back you could physically notice that he was shaken. He was wearing the locket at the time which we found out was why he couldn’t produce a Patronus.”
“No, of course not. I don’t want to ruin your fun, Rodolphus. Hey, do you have like a nickname or something shorter to call you, because I think after you get started it’ll be a little difficult to call you Rodolphus?”
“Told you my penis was smaller than yours. Yes. Why, is that not what you were talking about?”
“Oh, your trousers.” Harry muttered with a smirk. “What would you do if I made you cum in your trousers, Malfoy?” Harry’s fingers circled around the bulge in Malfoy’s trousers, and Malfoy groaned. “Oh, you’re close aren’t you, Malfoy. Getting me off made you so hard, didn’t it?” Harry whispered, and he unbuttoned Malfoy’s trousers, slipping her hand inside and wrapping around Malfoy’s erection. Malfoy moaned as he thrust his hips up into Harry’s hands, and Harry pulled her hand away. Harry tisked at Malfoy as she shook her finger back and forth covered in Malfoy’s precum.
“Well, I’m not sure how I feel about this dinner invitation, if I have to watch my goddaughter make out with her boyfriend.” Sirius joked, and Harkin pulled away from the kiss to smile at the two men as she climbed off Draco’s lap and ran to embrace the two men.
“Oh, nothing. Just the fact that people that I have practically lived with for more than four years don’t believe I’m telling the truth, but Malfoy, who has despised me since first year, comes to tell me that he believes me and wants to help me. I just find it amazing that people that I have called an enemy for four years believes me over people I have called a friend for four years.” Harry practically shouted. Hermione and Ron took a step back, and they gave Harry a worried look. “I’m sorry, it’s just everything that’s going on and to top it off this stupid potion. Can you guys just leave and give me some time alone, please.”
“This is Harry Potter, Draco’s best friend. Can we come in, please? I have nowhere else I trust to go to, not with Draco and Harry. Please, can we come in?” Narcissa begged. The woman opened the door all the way and waved her arm as if to allow them into the house. Narcissa grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled the boys into the house and then their trunks. “Thank you. Thank you so much. Draco this is your aunt, Andromeda. I do really appreciate this.” Narcissa didn’t know what to do, or where to stand in the house of her sister that she let her mother disown for marrying a muggleborn. “I’m sorry, Andy.”
“Are you touching yourself while watching me clean myself?”
“Granger, sit. The short blade is an easy fix, regular healing magic does the trick. The twins are just a little trickier, but our main concern is the sword. We don’t know how long it was left in Potter, and we don’t know what the Healers did about fixing it. That’s why I’ve asked Madam Pomfrey to owl to St. Mungos and ask. I’m to bring Potter up to the hospital wing later.” Granger settled back down in the chair and relaxed a little bit. “I owe him my freedom. He doesn’t remember anything from last night but I do, and I know what he did for me and my mother. He may have even saved my father from a worse sentence in Azkaban. I will help him to the best of my ability.”
“It is fitting I must say. What do you want to do until dinner? Draco and I normally play wizard’s chess to pass the time.” Narcissa said.
“Ha, tell that to Percy. I was kidnapped at least, and I think of everyone who knows about this prophecy I deserve to know most of all. I deserve to know why he went after my parents and try and kill me when I was a baby. Don’t I? I just want answers that no one is giving me. I’m safe right now, and I want answers, Arthur. Don’t make me hurt you. I will deeply regret it, and Ron and Hermione will probably never talk to me again. You getting hurt can’t be my fault. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”
“Okay, and it’s obvious that no one in this room told your husband where you were?”
Suddenly the doors to the hospital wing burst open and Narcissa was strutting down the corridor straight for her son. “What happened? This school is supposed to be one of the safest places in the wizarding world and my son and his fiancé have been attack twice in the same week.” Narcissa insisted.
“Can we not talk about this here in the middle of St. Mungos, please? Come over to the Manor, it’s not that bad.” Harry begged. “Please.”
“Help me out of this dress, Mipsy.” Harry asked, and Mipsy hurried over and started helping Harry out of the dress. She undid Harry’s corset, and she pulled the black corset off the top of the stack and started doing it up for Harry. When she finished, Harry pulled the black shirt off the stack before she unfolded the trousers and found a pair of leather skinny jeans. Harry started pulling them on, and Mipsy started helping. After a little while Harry had the pants on, and she laced up the combat boots that came with the outfit. Mipsy then took her back to the dining room where Lucius was waiting.
“No, and he will hopefully be proud that I finally bucked up to stand up for me, stand up for my family.” Draco said, and Harkin leaned in and kissed him lazily. “You are my life now, my raven. You both are.” Draco whispered as his fingers brushed against her stomach, and Harkin smiled wider.
“All I figured out was that I love you, and I don’t care about the rest.” Harry got up off the floor and pulled Draco’s lips towards his own. Draco was surprised at first and then relaxed into the kiss, kissing Harry back. Draco pushed Harry up against the shower wall and trapped him against the wall. Harry slipped his arms around Draco and pulled him closer, and Harry slipped his hands down and around Draco’s butt, pulling his hips forward, grinding into Harry’s erection. Draco groaned as his erection grinded against Harry’s, and Harry slipped one of his hands up into Draco’s hair and pulled it to the side. Harry latched onto Draco’s neck, and Harry bit down on Draco’s collarbone.
“I did. He was torturing Harry after I told him to leave him alone. He disobeyed.” Draco said as he glanced at the werewolf for the first time.
“Yes, Harry Potter. She is right in here.” Narcissa said as she pushed the door open and escorted Draco inside with Sirius right behind them.
“Thank you, sir.” Draco stated. “Can we head to lunch now, we kind of missed breakfast?”
“He will be alright with it when he realizes that it was the only way to pull them out of the stasis.” Snape said.
“I’m wonderful. I have been getting to know the wonderful person that will soon be my daughter-in-law. She is very fascinating, and reminds me a lot of her mother at that age. I sometimes can’t believe that girl is related to James Potter, and then she proves me wrong. She’s a wonderful balance of the pair, though.” Narcissa stated.
Draco stepped off the bed and strutted over to the bathroom door and started trying to coax Harry out of the bathroom. He didn’t turn around when he heard the door close gently behind Blaise as he left, but he continued to talk to Harry. He was using magic to try and unlock the door as he did it and he finally unlocked the door about a half an hour to an hour later. When he stepped into the bathroom, Harry was lying on the floor curled in the fetal position with his eyes closed. Draco ran to him and pulled him into his arms.
“I don’t know, Harry, but I just want it to last, so I just don’t want to say that it won’t work out, because I really want it to work out. Do you know what I mean, Harry?” Draco explained as he turned towards Harry and entwined his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Harry, I want you and only you. You can give us a chance right?”
“You went to see Remus, who is staying at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, which is Sirius’ family home.” Draco stated, and Harkin stared at him.
“Great, so he won’t even tell us what he did to us, when it’s his fault that this happened, and he knows how to help and explain things.” Draco groaned, and his mother rested her hand on his shoulder.
“What is this stuff?” Ron said as he picked up a piece.
“What for, dragon?” Narcissa whispered back as she raked her fingers through his hair.
“I’m satisfied.”
“Well, that was unexpected.” Severus said, and Draco was standing.
“Uh, Draco, we cannot leave my knickers down here. One of your parents will find them, or even worse, Remus will find them. Merlin that would be awful.” Harkin groaned.
“Draco, I’m alright with this, you and Harry. I won’t tell your father until you want him to know, but I just want you to know that I am alright with this.” Narcissa kissed Draco’s cheek and then Harry’s. “I will leave you two to yourselves, and I will try and convince your father not to let you do this.” Narcissa said and she turned and walked out of the room.
“We aren’t going to be able to get Potter out of there as easily as we were before. The Dark Lord has found something out about Miss Potter that he doesn’t know how it is possible.”
Lucius appeared at the gate and bowed immediately. “My Lord, I was not expecting you.”
“The library here at the Manor. There are a lot of interesting books up there, and not knowing anything about how to be a woman let alone a mother, one tends to want to know more about it.” Harkin stated.
“Okay, what about it?” Harry asked nervously.
Harry walked down the stairs and to the kitchen and dining room to find Andromeda lying on the table. “Annie?” Harry panicked as he felt for a pulse, and found one. He sighed with relief as he looked at Teddy. “Grandma’s going to be alright.”
Fine, but I will find out right?
“But you’re so comfy,” Harry muttered as she pulled herself closer to Draco and wrapped her leg around Draco’s. Draco chuckled as he wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist, and he pulled Harry closer.
“75 Galleons.”
“She insulted Lily!” Sirius said in disbelief. “Apparently, Petunia had never seen Lily’s temper, which you inherited by the way. I wish you luck, Malfoy; James could barely handle her temper and we’ve been dealing with a werewolf almost every month since we were eleven.” Sirius said to Draco, and he was looking up in horror.
Finally, Severus returned, and he handed two vials to Melody. “Why did you bring two?” Melody asked, and Severus just gave her a look. “Never mind, that was a stupid question. Their cores are combined, so whatever is affecting her is also affecting him just deluded. It’s been a long night so far.” Melody stated, and she forced one potion down Harkin's throat and then the other down Draco's throat. “How long does it take to work usually?”
“When did you have time to do that?”
“Severus, what are you looking for?” Draco said as he looked around the room as well.
“Yes. It seems that when we got caught up in sex we were having, I forgot about some protection spells. Spells to prevent pregnancy, and my mother is worried about you being pregnant. So she’s making an appointment to see if you are and to take care of the problem if you are and if you aren’t she wants to see if our doctor can see if you can get pregnant.”
Draco walked into the back room with Healer Johnson behind him, and he walked right up to harry and took her hand. “I’m right here, love.” Draco whispered.
“I’ll be right out, and stay with her, for some reason she trusts you.”
“Sirius!” Harry shouted as she was about to run towards him, but then realized that Sirius hadn’t seen her as a girl yet. She froze as she watched Sirius slowly turn around and take in her appearance. It was only a few moments before Sirius opened his arms to Harry, and she ran into his arms.
“Yeah, mate.” Ron said and Draco rolled his eyes. “What, ferret?”
“Not at the point Lily had Harry. By then I defected. Only a few people knew, Dumbledore and Lily. She knew I would take care of Harry, though I didn’t get the chance. When I found Lily I was too upset to do anything for Harry, even though I didn’t know at the time that she appointed me. I didn’t find out until Dumbledore already hid her away. Then I couldn’t do anything to find her.” Severus stated.
“I know, love; I’m sorry. Just this is getting to me, I guess. Let’s go shower and get ready for the rest of the day. You have an appointment at 1 this afternoon.” Draco said, and he stood up. He scooped Harry into his arms and carried her o the bathroom as her augh rang throughout the house.
“Well, I’m sorry to cut this reunion short, but Miss Lovegood needs to get back to Ravenclaw common room as do you, Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley. Your usual rooms are waiting for you.”
“Does it feel as if its’ warming up in here or is it just me?” Draco asked as he started loosening his tie, and he looked over to Harry to see she looked a little flushed. He then looked up at his mother, and she looked a little flushed as well. Draco was starting to wonder if the heat in the Manor was turned up. Draco was about to ask his mother about it, when Severus and Lucius walked back in the room.
“Yeah, alright. You can come through, and we can talk.” Remus said, and he was gone. Harkin smiled and stepped through the flames, and as the flames engulfed her, she saw Draco standing in the doorway to the drawling room with a look of worry on his face. The next thing she knew she was standing in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place, and Remus was pulling her into his arms.
“Dumbledore told me.”
Draco rode out his orgasm, and then he pulled out of Harry and collapsed on top of him. Harry’s arms automatically wrapped around Draco’s waist and rolled to the side so Draco’s weight wasn’t lying on top of him. They were both trying to catch their breath, when Draco broke the silence. “You’re a phenomenal lay, Potter.” Draco said as his hands were resting on Harry’s sides, his hands moving in an up and down motion.
“Yes, but everyone is always better at controlling their magic when we have a wand. No matter how good I am at wandless magic I would want a wand to be the best, plus we don’t know if he would possess the same skills while in Harry’s body. Since Gryffindor tower is the closest I would suspect that would be his first stop.”
“Well, I was going to throw a party in commemoration of Miss Potter and her successful defeat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, but seeing your attitudes I don’t think I will.”
“Please, enlighten us, Malfoy.”
“Love, I need to give you this potion. It’s going to make you better alright.” Draco whispered into the top of her head, and he uncorked the unknown potion that Severus had him brew. He placed the vile to her lips, and she tilted her head back so she could swallow the potion. Draco wasn’t sure of her blind faith in him, because he wasn’t completely sure about this himself, but at least she drank the potion. He watched as she curled into a ball on his lap, and he heard whimpers coming from Harry. Draco remembered the words Severus told him. ‘You have to be strong for her. Make sure you know it’s going to work, and it will.’ Draco understood then. He then downed the other unknown potion which was similar to the one he just gave Harry. This part of the plan Draco didn’t understand at all, but Severus instructed him that this would work.
“Why do you care? I was kidnapped from school right outside the great hall where everyone was having lunch by Theodore Nott and then taken to his father. You two are Death Eaters, you should have known he was trying something, and could have stopped it. I’m going to go and try and get this stupid corset off.” Harry stormed off and found her room with a little help from Nagini.
Harry has to come to terms with the information she received from Madam Pomfrey.
“In Miss Potter’s absence I would appreciate you guiding Mr. Longbottom through his potions, Mr. Malfoy. You being the top in this class, I feel you’d be best for the job. I think Miss Potter could put up with Mr. Zabini for the rest of the term while you tutor Longbottom.”
“I haven’t changed sides I’ve just been beaten and bullied to get her tonight. I will still end you, Tom.” Harry stated, and he gripped her arm tighter and she cried out in pain. Voldemort looked from her eyes to her arm and dragged her to the room she would be staying in and MIPS was standing there waiting for her. “Mipsy, I want you to mend Miss Potter’s arm and then help her into her gown for this evening.” Voldemort turned towards Harry then as Nagini slithered into the room. “Potter, I am tying you to Nagini. You will not be able to be more than 15 feet from her, do not try and escape.” He turned towards his pet, and said, “
“I remember vomiting.” Harry whispered, which must have given Malfoy some more concern as his eyes danced with it. “You don’t mask your feelings very well anymore, Draco. When did that happen?” Harry asked as he lifted his hand and caressed Malfoy’s jaw, rubbing his thumb against his cheek. Malfoy’s eyes showed surprise, and Harry was wondering why, but he could feel his consciousness slipping from him as his hand slipped down the Malfoy’s shoulder and down his arm, coming to rest on top of his hand as he fell asleep.
“What were you going to do with Harry?”
“Dray…” he heard her mutter into the side of his neck. Draco turned his attention back to Harry, but heard as his mother stood and walked out of the room and shut the door.
“Father just being rude, but he is unfortunately right. We should get ready for the ball.” Draco stated as he pulled her up into a sitting position and then climbed off the bed to the closet.
“Yes. I’m assuming you’ve met that rat. He’s actually quite literally a rat too is the funny part.”
“Nice try, Potter, but do you think I’m that daft? The minute I bring her out of her sleep she is going to send for help.”
“Oh, I guess. Since you’ll be dead anyway. I plan to take everything she loves from her, starting with her husband, and then work my way from the oldest to the youngest child. You would have originally been after Ronald, of course, but you were the easiest target to do first. Lull her into a self-hope that you will be my only victim.”
“The potion was supposed to expel the bit of the Dark Lord’s soul. I pulled it together quickly and needed to tie her to someone else. You. I didn’t know it would expel everything that wasn’t you or her, but a good thing came out of a bad thing.”
“Yes, but apparently Lily forgave me, and she hoped that if anything were to happen to the four of you she would have someone. Someone Lily trusted to take care of her son, and now daughter, even if everyone else was gone.” Severus stated.
“Dray…” Harry moaned, and Draco’s lips found Harry’s. His lips moved from her jaw and neck, and she moaned as Draco nipped at her skin. “Mmm… Dray…. More, Dray…” Harry panted, and Draco’s rhythm sped up and nipped harder at Harry’s skin. “Yes, like that…”
“Yeah, I’ve wanted to be in this situation for way longer than I care to admit. All I want to do is try and replicate all of my fantasies that happen in here or anywhere for that matter.” Harry stepped forwards, and he wrapped his fingers around Draco’s fingers that were wrapped around his own hard on.
“Harry…” Sirius started as he stared blankly at Narcissa and Draco.
“I can try as long as you don’t give me anymore reasons to think you are lying to me. You do that and I’m yours, Malfoy. Just remember I might not stay a woman.” Harry pulled out of Malfoy’s grasp as she walked backwards to the door. “You have a little something to remember me by on your trousers.” Harry smirked as walked out of the door. She caught a glimpse of him looking down at the white stain on his trousers.
“Mr. Malfoy? What does Mr. Malfoy have to do with anything?”
“I know, but I love it so much I couldn’t wait for her to know.”
“Draco, you have been over the itinerary a hundred times.” She scolded.
“Should she not?” Draco asked.
“Thank you.” Harry turned and pulled Draco from the room.
“I’ll take that back now, kiddo.” Harry said as he took his wand back from Teddy. “Thanks for looking after it for me.” Harry hugged the little boy letting him know that he cared.
“I can’t you just came back to me.” Draco whispered.
“Seriously?” she questioned, not sure if she could believe it.
Harry started looking through the books and started with the h’s, and she came across a few she liked. Then she came across one she absolutely loved. “Draco what do you think of Harkin. It means dark red or fiery one. I like it.”
“Yes, Master.” Mipsy bowed and took Harry’s hand, and then they were standing in a bedroom. “Mipsy set up Master Harry’s room, I hope Master Harry likes it. Mipsy put Master Harry’s special gift over here.” Mipsy pulled Harry over to a small dresser, and opened the small drawer on top. There was a small stack of clothes that Harry picked up.
“What happened, Severus?” she questioned.
“Well, they are most likely going to end up sharing a room anyway so you should only make up two rooms. They are old enough to make their own decisions, and it’s not like they can get each other pregnant.” Both Harry and Draco looked up at Narcissa in disbelief. They couldn’t believe that Narcissa had just said that, and actually meant what she said.
“Good, we need to file those as soon as possible. I don’t want her to have to deal with anything she doesn’t have to especially if she is pregnant.”
“That’s good to hear, Mr. Malfoy. May I ask when you would want your mother out of your father’s grasp?”
“But you don’t have a speck of dirt on you.” Sirius stated.
Lucius bowed his head as Draco stormed out of the room, and Narcissa glared at her husband as she followed her son out of the room. “Draco, wait up, dragon.” Narcissa closed the door behind her after Draco slammed it shut behind him. “Draco, please wait. I just want to talk.”
“We will figure this out, Draco. Severus did say that the processes was changed when you and Harry stole the Dark Lords powers, so maybe he isn’t completely sure how this is going to turn out yet. Maybe he is trying to figure it out and tell you everything when he figures it out. You and Harry are now the most powerful beings in the Wizarding world, literally anything can happen.”
“Not until he harnesses Harry’s power. The minute he turns without someone doing it is the minute he is lost. Take him now. I will fetch Professor McGonagall, and Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger. Go now, Draco. Before he wakes. Then you may want to wipe the blood off your face before McGonagall gets to her office. Go.” Draco picked Harry up and was out of the room and standing in front of McGonagall’s office door and it opened to his touch, and he was inside and shutting the door.
“Why with Professor Snape?”
“How do you know that?”
“Well, first of all, I said he might be alright, it depends on the case, and the damage already done. Second, Madam Pomfrey and I had to improvise a majority of the spells because they conflicted with the ones cast at St. Mungos. So I have no idea what is going to happen. After he wakes if he wakes; this is all very temperamental magic, Granger.” Draco explained, and Hermione slouched into the chair that Draco had just vacated.
“Several.”
“Potter, can you walk at all?”
“No, your mother did not, Draco. She did not give us permission to have sex on her dining room table. Do you know how bad that will be? Anyone could walk in at any moment.” Harkin whispered.
Everyone started digging into the food, and Harry slowly started eating as he was starting to feel drained. He was starting to get fed up with this being so drained, and he was starting to feel nauseous, which the healer said would be normal. Harry got through one plate of food, and he felt like he was going to throw up. Harry stood and whispered in Hermione’s ear, “I’m going to the bathroom.” Hermione gave him a concerned look as he walked as slowly across the Great Hall as he could without drawing too much attention to himself.
“Sleep, my love. You’ll feel better when you wake.” Draco whispered, but Harkin didn’t even have to be told because she was already falling asleep, and she felt her eyelids dripped closed and was asleep.
“Yes. Can we?”
“Harry,” Hermione was the first to pull out of her stupor and hurried to his side. Harry stopped laughing and gripped Draco tighter.
“You are my godson, Draco. I’d do anything for you. Let’s find Mr. Potter.” Draco focused on Harry; first he pictured his face, and pieced Harry together with the way he smelled, the way he tasted, and the way his skin felt against his own. Draco pictured all of his memories of Harry and pushed them to the fore front of his mind, and he pushed them out and towards Harry; he focused on finding him.
“Potter! Who is it and why are you leaving my door open for so long? Let them in and get your lousy ads in here so you can make our supper. Dudley is going to be home soon and he’s going to want his supper when he gets home,” Vernon shouted, and Harry’s eyes went to the floor as he flinched because his best friend is watching him be treated like one of his house elves. Harry was ashamed of how Draco was seeing him be treated this way, when he seemed so confident and in power. Harry was ashamed that his best friend had to see him being be little by his uncle.
“Come along, Potter.” Malfoy said as he took her hand and entwined their fingers. It was a weird sensation, but she oddly like it and didn’t pull away. She let Malfoy pull her into a room next to the library that she didn’t even notice before, and once the door was closed the lights automatically turned on. The room had a greenish glow to it and reminded Harry of the Slytherin common room. “You’ve been in the Slytherin common room, Potter?” Malfoy said, and Harry looked up at his voice, she hadn’t realized she said that out loud.
Harry turned to find Malfoy standing there, and she said, “Can I help you, Malfoy?”
“Yeah, and he isn’t wrong, I just didn’t want to admit it to myself.” Draco stated.
“Well, the Dark Lord held a ball this evening in celebration of his new prize, Harry. Granted she looked beautiful in that ball gown like nothing had even happened but we’ll get there. The Dark Lord danced with her all night, and paid all his attention to her. Though some of the Death Eaters didn’t like that. At the end of the night, he tasked Lucius, Narcissa and I to escort her up to her room where we relayed your plan to rescue her. She’s at Riddle Manor, by the way. We fought and she stormed off, well we found her room and she allowed us access, where Narcissa helped her out of her dress and corset in the bathroom. When we heard shouting, Lucius and I rushed in to find very distinct bruises across her legs and abdomen. They were about the size of one’s fingertip. Upon further evaluation, I found scratch marks down her sides and back as well. She wouldn’t tell me anything, so I used
“I don’t care. You are perfect.” Draco whispered, and he pulled her back in for a kiss. Their lips met, and Harkin slowly melted into the kiss. When Draco pulled away, he smiled, and Harkin kissed him again, before pulling away and smiling.
“Draco and I are practically married already, so I mean I kind of am.” Harkin stated as blush rose into her cheeks.
“Yes, now what about Severus?”
“Remi, you and Siri are adorable together, and when he comes back, you guys will be okay. I know you will, and I know that he will be back. Draco keeps telling me that he will back, and I know he will, but it’s you that really needs to know that he’ll be back. Snape is assuming my guardianship, so realistically Siri probably won’t be able to claim guardianship of me after all this is over. I just need him because he’s one of the only people left of my family. I still have you, and you have me, but you’re living in his house and you love him and want to spend the rest of your life with him. I’m just a reminder that he’s gone.” Harkin muttered into her cup of tea.
“You just…uh…you are going to be the end of me, Harkin Potter.” Draco groaned.
“You’ll see as long as you tell no one. I’m not sure how Harry is going to feel about it, but we need to find her.” Ron ran into the room and into Harry’s new room and grabbed the Marauder’s Map, and he ran back out of the room and into the corridor where Draco and Hermione were waiting. “Tell anyone about this and Harry will have words with you. Come on. We better get moving before the rest of Gryffindor comes up.” Ron said as he pulled on Hermione’s arm and the trio started walking away as they heard the prefects escorting the rest of the Gryffindors up to the common room. “Harry’s father and his group of friends created a map of Hogwarts when they were in school. It shows all of the secret passages and corridors, everything from the dungeons to the highest tower, all the secrets in and out of the building, and one other thing.” Ron pulled out his wand and pointed it at the piece of parchment and whispered, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” And the ink spread across the pages and turned into the layout of Hogwarts, then the dots appeared to show where everyone was. Their dots appeared on the seventh floor just around the corner and out of view of the Gryffindor Common room where the other Gryffindor prefects were escorting the Gryffindors into the common room.
“Yes, Mistress. How can Cali help, Mistress?” the house elf asked with a bow.
“Oh, I wasn’t aware. Yes, I can test paternity. Just hold still for a moment.” She said as he lifted her wand and cast a spell at Draco, and then at Harry, and she looked back up at Draco. “You’re the father, Draco.”
“You might as well, they’ll figure it out eventually.” Draco said as he sat up and he reached for Harry and stroked his jaw. “Might as well tell them everything, since all the Weasley’s know as well as Granger. It’s obvious if you watch close enough.” Draco said as he pulled Harry’ subconscious body into his lap. Everyone watched in silence as Draco stroked Harry’s hair.
“No, not at all. I enjoy it actually, because it means you’re thinking long term and not just a one off and done. I love the fact that you see a relationship with me when everyone else will think otherwise.” Draco commented, and Harry propped himself up on his elbow.
“Because I was similar to him, I understand where he is coming from, the only difference is I decided to change; to protect you, and to protect myself and my family, which you became a part of, not that that was in the original plan, but I love you, and I know I would do everything I possible could to make sure you are coveted and protected. Especially now.” Draco stated as his hands rested on her small baby bump, which made Harkin giggle.
