“Yeah. Yeah, I really fucking do,” Harry replied, unable to hold back a light laugh as he admitted something that he was often so ashamed of. “I like to be choked, scratched, bit, pinched, slapped, spanked -”
“Fuck - Draco - it’s perfect -” Harry gasped out, his hips thrusting wildly and only increasing the fiery heat pooling inside Draco’s stomach.
“Exactly. You are not to come until we meet again tomorrow. I expect you to be here at six o’clock sharp. This time you will kneel at the door and wait for permission to enter, do you understand?”
A sharp searing pain hit Harry for a brief moment, though it faded quickly. “And I gather that you quite like it?” Draco inquired with a smirk, his tongue poking out to lick his reddened lips.
I felt a breath on my neck, a warm wash of air before teeth were sinking into skin, lips and tongue soothing over the bite as my back arched, moving closer to his warmth.
name. He had been avoiding using it, or being around others who had used it ever since his mother’s death. Afterall, despite what the Ministry may believe, Draco knew it was one of You-Know-Who’s remaining followers who killed her.
“Right. Okay. Well, I brought food, so you better get your arse over here and eat it. I didn’t go all the way to Pentrenelli’s for nothing.”
Suddenly, Harry’s hand reached down, wrapping around Draco’s ankle in a vice grip. Draco met Harry’s gaze and was pleased to see to the deep flush that had taken over his cheeks. Harry glanced around to ensure no one was within earshot, then he leaned closer to Draco, licking his lips before he whispered, “Because, I could come just from this.”
Draco was blinking up at Harry through strands of stray blond hairs and long, delicate eyelashes, the look in his eyes beautifully demure as his flushed lips sucked and sucked on Harry’s nipple. He pulled back for a moment, the combination of his words and his warm breath rushing over the wet skin making Harry’s cock throb, “Does it feel good?”
Harry took the bottle, but didn’t take a drink right away. “I like long stories,” he said curiously, his breath warm on Draco’s neck.
“Shut it, Malfoy,” Harry growled, and then he was pushing Draco roughly back against the bed, straddling his hips and pressing his thin wrists into the mattress, “I’ll show you stamina.”
Although Harry was the ‘Daddy,’ it was clear that Draco was in charge. And Harry wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
Harry would never forget the mixture of emotions in Draco’s eyes as he stared at Harry, the fear, the pity, the hurt. But maybe, just maybe, there was a twinge of hope.
He couldn’t resist indulging himself, reaching down to rub over the ever-growing outline of his cock and sighing at the tingles of pleasure it sent pulsing throughout his body. Harry hummed, letting his eyes fall lazily shut as he continued to rub himself through his trousers.
Just as Harry was about to apologize, Draco continued, “Lucky for you, I only have one meeting this afternoon and it can be easily rescheduled. So, we can start now.”
He fussed with his hair when he caught his reflection in a mirror hanging on the wall opposite him, trying to tame his perpetually messy black strands.
As a new verse began, Harry suddenly noticed that all eyes in the crowd were on him. And when he looked up, Draco was standing directly above him, a fire in his eyes.
A circular object then flew in the direction of Draco’s head and he screeched, ducking out of the way just as Harry caught the disk gracefully in his hand.
Suddenly Harry felt hands settle on his hips, a line of heat forming along his back as a silky smooth voice whispered in his ear, “Trying to run away from me, Potter?”
He sighed as the sheets shifted down his body, the sensation only registering at the softened edges of his consciousness, his eyes still closed, his mind hovering somewhere between sleep and wake.
Harry was enraptured by the power behind each of Draco’s movements. Even if Draco had been performing in full Wizard robes, Harry would still have been turned on simply by the commanding nature of each move he made.
Draco paused, staring up at the moon and trailing a thumb over the back of Harry’s hand. “I get to plan our next date.”
This was not the first time they had fucked. In fact, this was not even the hundredth time they had fucked. The pair of them had been together for years, had been through the aftermath of the War, the rebuilding of Hogwarts, and the treacherous period of healing for the Wizarding World as a whole.
As if on instinct, I felt a firm hand sliding down until it cradled my cock. Precome on his fingertips, sticky, salty, sweet. The sheer heat of Harry’s palms was enough to send shivers along my spine.
Harry felt his heart skitter to a stop at Draco’s words before beginning to beat at lightning speed. He suddenly regretted asking at all.
Harry worked him over until Draco's thighs were trembling, his fists clenched in Harry's hair, and his come shooting out over Harry's tongue and chin moments later.
When Harry opened his eyes, Draco’s gaze did not meet his own. Instead, Harry watched as Draco’s eyes dragged slowly over his body, pupils dark and eyelids heavy, examining the masterpiece he had created with a quiet hunger. Harry shivered involuntarily, the gaze like a feather being dragged softly across his skin.
Grumbling and barely suppressing a yawn, Harry blinked at the blurry outline of Draco’s pale and naked figure, “Where is what?”
A smirk was evident in Draco’s voice when he replied, “The one you’re currently lying on is covered in dried come.”
Something akin to pride flashed in Draco’s eyes before he leaned down and wrapped his lips around Harry’s left nipple.
He reached down to wrap a hand around the hard outline of Harry’s cock, desire coursing through him at the broken cry it tore from Harry’s lips.
,” he leaned over to pull Harry in for a quick, but no less dizzying kiss, “I’m thinking it will keep on doing
With that one word it felt as though the temperature in the room shifted. He was hot but the air was so cold. His touch was fire but his breath blew across my skin like ice.
Suddenly, they were left lying in the darkness of their bedroom, just a small sliver of moonlight peaking through a crack in the curtains.
“Raw. And hard,” Harry replied without hesitation, his vision blurring as his mind swam with images, snippets of naked bodies moving harshly together, of hands curling around throats and nails scratching down backs. “I want you to pin me down or tie me up if you have to, I want you to pound your cock inside of me until I can’t see straight. I want to be powerless. I want to be nothing more than a hole for you to fuck.”
Harry had just gotten out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair damp and disheveled as he walked into their bedroom to find a fresh pair of briefs.
Even from the back, there was no mistaking that this man was Draco Malfoy. From his slim figure to the mile-long limbs and the sensual curves that his body created as he moved, beginning to sway as music played over the speakers.
As Harry drifted off to sleep, sated and grateful, he couldn’t help but wonder just how often Draco did this, and whether he would be willing to show Harry this soft, vulnerable side of himself when they were both fully awake.
Harry massaged the plump flesh of Draco’s arse for a second, before prying his cheeks apart and looking down at his hole - pink and furled and perfect.
A hand came up to pet soothingly over Harry’s belly, coaxing his body to shift until even more of his arse was exposed to Draco.
Draco threw his hands up with as much sass and exasperation as though Harry had just asked him to recite
want?” Draco drawled, leaning against the doorframe and trying to convey an air of effortless superiority sprinkled with exasperation.
Suddenly I felt the cool flat of the blade on my cheek guiding my head to turn slowly, slowly until Harry's lips connected with my own.
Harry couldn’t stop himself and he leaned over to mouth over Draco’s latex-covered cock, tasting the burn of the alcohol on his tongue and licking his lips as he looked back up once more, his own eyes blown wide with lust.
If it had been anyone else, Draco would have cursed them out, maybe sent a Stinging Hex for good measure. But this was Harry Potter - golden boy and doer of good deeds - and in many ways Draco’s family deserved that comment.
Memories flooded back all in a rush as Draco blearily blinked down at Harry, his face slack with sleep and his scar just peaking through his mess of black hair as he snored softly. It was oddly charming in a way that only Harry could manage.
After the War, Harry and Draco began dating, and two years later they got married - with one ceremony held in Godric’s Hollow and the other held at a garden that Draco used to visit as a child.
Draco hummed inquisitively before reaching out a hand to feel Harry’s cock through his denims, a devious smile stretching across his face, “Might’ve been
When Draco finally got his lips wrapped around Harry, his entire world became focused in on his cock. He wanted to memorize every taste, every smell, every curve, and every throbbing vein.
Then a tongue was licking sweetly, almost tentatively, over his hole, massaging the pucker and sending pleasure shooting throughout his body.
Above him, Draco had Conjured a glass of water, one that he was drinking leisurely as he stared down at Harry, his throat bobbing with each successive swallow, his lips shining as he tipped the cup back. Harry’s heartbeat sped up as he processed what Draco was doing, what he was preparing to do. The thought alone had Harry’s prick pressing insistently against the thin material of his sleep trousers.
Harry nodded, avoiding Draco’s gaze as he ran a hand uselessly through his disastrous hair. “I’m sure of it. I - er - just thought you deserved to know.”
Harry looked - Well, he looked quite gorgeous, actually. Draco had never seen him looking so put together. It was disconcerting (especially because Draco’s heart was suddenly beating unusually fast, and he even found himself feeling self-conscious of
This comment only seemed to delight Harry further, and suddenly Draco felt a strong hand on his lower back, guiding him past a hoard of tiny Muggles until they reached some sort of counter.
It was healing, in a sense. Harry and I had come full circle. We had been through hell and back. But by some miracle, we both made it through and found refuge in one another.
For a moment, he got up, the weight on the bed displacing me until I began to tip forward, bound and unable to stop my descent. But just as quickly as he’d left, his strong arms looped around my waist, catching my fall and pulling me into his embrace, his bare chest at my back.
“Er, not right now, thanks,” Harry replied politely, handing Draco a pair of the shoes and leading him over to a bench.
Harry’s eyelids fluttered when Draco pet gently across the velvety-soft skin of his cock, caressing it with a touch that was feather-light and yet it seared a line of fire that made his cock leak, precome dripping onto his belly.
“What do you want?” Draco asked, speaking the words against Harry’s lips, his hand stroking so perfectly around his cock.
A pleased hum escaped Draco’s lips as he thought of the pain and pleasure he could inflict on Harry with this one simple item. He wondered how delicious Harry would look with harsh red marks streaking across his arse.
As he stepped inside, Harry noticed that the furnishings in this room, while no less high-quality, were much more approachable, more simplistic. Something about the room eased the discomfort building in Harry’s chest.
Draco hummed as though satisfied with Harry's reaction, licking slow and deep as he collected the drop of precome on the tip of his finger and used it to tease under the head of Harry’s cock.
Harry shifted on the loveseat, scratching at the nape of his neck and adjusting his glasses, “Could we - er - How about now?”
“I - you know what I said,” Draco replied with a hint of annoyance, making a show of turning a page in his book, as if to communicate in all his sassy glory,
And while Draco continuously complained about the stupidity of Muggle games and the unnecessarily loud music that they played inside the arcade, he was secretly enjoying himself.
None of these things had anything at all to do with some pathetic little plant - but Draco attempted to convince himself that they were.
It was insane and intriguing all at once. It reminded Draco of the time in fifth year when the Weasel twins had tried to blow up the Great Hall in the middle of exams.
Harry felt it before he saw it, a warm stream of piss hitting his collarbone and rushing down his chest, falling into the grooves of his stomach as it traveled lower, lower,
Draco let his hands trail down Harry’s back, tracing his shoulder blades - which felt like suits of armor to his touch. Dragging down the knots of his spine, past the dip of his waist until they settled on Harry’s sleek black belt.
A pause stretched between them, and Harry finally looked up at Draco, taking in his pristine appearance, the effortless way he seemed to exude sex with each breath he took, his mere presence setting Harry’s body on edge.
Kissing Harry was somewhat of a dichotomy, because while Draco could intimately feel every shock of arousal racing through his veins, he also felt as though he was floating outside of himself.
While Draco fought to keep upright, Harry licked and sucked, running the flat of his tongue over the head and then dipping into the slit, making every kind of beautifully obscene sound as he went.
It was Hermione who had slipped it in oh-so-casually during their weekly tea, “A new gay club opened up in Staffordshire, did you hear?”
Harry took another bite of crumpet and wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist. He hummed for a moment before he spoke, “I’m not mad about it.”
Draco didn’t miss the smirk on Harry’s face. Nor did he miss the way it brought warmth rushing to his own cheeks.
Harry sat up straighter in bed, finally sliding his glasses onto his face and taking in Draco in all his grumpy glory, “Erm, first of all, stop throwing things at me. Second of all, I have no fucking clue what you’re talking about.”
Suddenly, Harry glanced up at him, the look in his eyes torn between horny and pissed. “Draco, stop that right now,” he hissed, though Draco detected a quiver in his voice.
Draco swatted at Harry’s head blindly, not taking his eyes away from the plant. “Oh, shove off. I’m not in the mood for your idiotic comments this evening. This plant was dead this morning, I swear… ”
Harry nearly choked, coughing roughly as he felt his face flush, overwhelmed by the myriad of images his mind suddenly conjured up.
Just when Draco was about to flick open to the buttons of Harry’s trousers, Harry was swatting away Draco’s hand and dropping to his knees.
Draco rolled his eyes but a smile spread across his lips before he could stop it. “I’m not either, Potter. Not mad at all.”
Then, Draco was leaning over to grab his wand, casting a couple of quick charms until the room began to transform around them. The curtains were drawn closed, the candles blown out, the door shut, and the bathroom light turned off.
The finale note hit and the crowd erupted into raucous applause around them, money being thrown onto the stage as people shouted and whistled in support.
what I do, Potter,” he replied, something sensual hovering in the air with his words. “Now, why don’t you take a seat and we can discuss the logistics.”
A devilish smirk pulled at the corner of Draco’s lips and he leaned in to bite gently over Harry’s nipple, the dull sting going straight to Harry’s cock.
Draco was dressed in an outfit that had Harry’s mouth watering. His torso was encased in an a black latex bodysuit, the material clinging to the curve of his arse and leaving little to the imagination as he turned to the side - the shiny fabric showing off every delicious inch of his cock.
to have Harry removing his shoes, to have Harry’s fingers brush against his ankle and stroke along the arch of his foot, to have Harry adjust the lip of his sock where it had slid down his calf. There was something erotic about it that Draco never could have imagined.
When they came to a halt, Draco noticed that they were on some sort of dance floor. Or perhaps it was more of an elaborately decorated hallway? Whatever it was, Draco realized that while it was very dark, everything around him appeared to be glowing.
It took Harry a moment to process, but then he stood up and walked over to Draco on shaky legs, his gait awkward as he attempted to maneuver around his ever-throbbing cock. As Harry stood in the doorway, he paused, looking at Draco and mouthing dumbly, so many words on the tip of his tongue, though none were quite coming out.
Letting his gaze wander to Draco’s cock - now growing soft as it lay against Draco’s thigh, the crown still wet from Harry’s lips - Harry chose his words carefully, “To be honest, Sir… No. I don’t think I have the restraint to wait. If you send me home - well, I - I don’t think I will be able to stop myself. It might happen even if I don’t… you know… touch myself.”
“More or less?” Harry asked, and this time I could feel the heat emanating from him, I could feel the hot press of his cock against the exposed crease of my arse.
Yet, Draco moved so carefully as he lifted Harry’s leg, bending his knee and guiding his legs apart. Harry allowed his to body be moved, surrendered to the curiosity of discovering what Draco did when he thought Harry was sleeping.
Before Harry could process what was happening, Draco had reached for the front of his shirt, fisting the material in his hand and dragging him up onto the stage.
Draco let out a light hum, causing vibration to spread in waves across his arse, and Harry had to clench his jaw to keep from making noise.
As the pair of them got up, there was something quite natural about it all. They showered together as though they had done it a hundred times. They brushed their teeth and then leaned in for a quick brush of lips. Harry cleaned his stubbornly dirty glasses whilst Draco went through his morning skincare routine.
“God, you are such a child,” Draco whined, though the whine quickly morphed into a moan as Harry slipped his hand inside Draco’s trousers and wrapped it around his cock.
Harry scuffed his trainers awkwardly against Draco’s front step, avoiding Draco’s gaze as he spoke under his breath, “Just wanted to come give my respects.”
Draco’s eyes nearly crossed as he looked at Harry's tanned finger, even this one digit making his mouth water. And before he could stop himself, Draco peeked out his tongue and traced it along the seam of Harry’s finger.
Draco’s eyes were heavily lidded, his pupils blown wide, a fire evident in his gaze, his lips were flushed and plump with teeth marks, his alabaster cheeks filled with color, and a cold sweat was breaking out at his temples.
Harry watched as Draco reached down to slide his hands up the side of his body, and it was then that Harry noticed the leather corsets lacing up his slim forearms.
A long fingered hand traced a line from Harry’s navel all the way up to his neck. Draco paused to squeeze his throat before his fingers were tipping Harry’s chin up, their lips connecting and heat quickly spreading throughout his body.
Despite the interest that stirred inside him, Harry resigned to try and ignore this new information - determined not to let his world become overrun by Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t sixteen anymore.
As I sunk further into the safety of Harry's arms, I reshaped the memory in my mind, not altering it entirely, but adding in moments of love and healing in the midst of such chaos.
“Fuck, you’re making a mess,” Draco commented, his tone bitter and exasperated even as his hips twitched up into Harry’s mouth, precome leaking onto Harry’s tongue.
With the same reverent touch, Draco guided Harry’s other leg into the same position, spreading his legs open in a way that had Harry suppressing a shiver, knowing just how exposed he must look.
Harry hummed with pleasure and allowed himself to be pulled back until Draco’s arms encircled his chest. And hands skimmed down until his cock was encircled in warmth.
Listening to the kids banter with one another instantly brought Draco back to their school days. Though thinking back on Hogwarts often stirred up a mixture of emotions, both fond memories as well as nightmares that left him trembling, there was something about listening to those kids squabble that was actually rather sweet.
that you're mouthy, that you're bold, that you are unapologetically Draco. But… I need you to follow my rules to get what you want."
Harry may have survived a War, and more than a few attempts on his life, but he could have died happily right then and there.
After a long day of meetings at the Ministry, Harry stepped through the Floo to find Draco sitting on the couch, clad only in a pair of thin grey briefs.
He pulled open the flaps of Draco’s trousers, revealing his naked cock, almost fully hard - the tip flushed and glowing under the moonlight.
As they kissed, they began to grind together, their cocks sliding through the thin layer of their briefs. Draco’s body drank in the heat from Harry as their movements gained in speed.
Harry looked up dazedly before the words seemed to register. Then his knee stopped moving abruptly and he ran a hand through his hair, as if unsure of what else to do with his extremities. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
Harry opened his mouth as if to say something, but then closed it. He let out a frustrated noise and turned toward Draco, “I just - I wanted to say that I’m sorry. And to share a… a story, if that’s alright?”
Next to them, Harry noticed a pair of women grinding together, their bodies entwined so tightly that Harry could barely tell where one woman began and the other ended. Harry watched, unable to look away as the women began to kiss, open-mouthed and wet, tongues brushing together, lips caressing.
The man laughed and Harry could sense him rolling his eyes without needing to see his face. And with that, a kiss was pressed to his neck and the hands snaked their way tighter around Harry’s body.
Once Harry was inside, his senses quickly became overwhelmed. His nose filled with the sharp sting of alcohol and the unmistakable scent of sex; his eyes were overwhelmed by the flashing lights and bright colors; his body overwhelmed by the steep uptick in temperature - by the sticky, wet heat that coated his skin; his ears were overwhelmed by the persistent thumping of the music as it blasted through the crowd, each beat reverberating in his brain.
When he finished unlacing Draco’s boot on one side, Harry settled the foot in his lap and reached for the other.
Eventually no more than a full minute would pass without another knock on the front door of the Burrow, and Harry was starting to feel a sense of anxiety creeping up his spine, cold sweat spreading across his upper lip and the dip of his back.
Draco reached out to interrupt him, placing a hand on Harry’s chest in a way that seemed to drain the anxiety building inside him. Then Draco slid his hand up until it was curled over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry could only nod dumbly, unsure that he was even capable of coherent speech, his cock already filling out in his trousers and his pulse jumping as he watched Draco’s slim hips sway slowly up the staircase, the threadbare briefs shifting so that the curve of Draco’s arsecheek was exposed, the sight making Harry’s mouth water, his arse looking plump enough to bite.
Harry opened his eyes and attempted to hide his growing erection. And because the universe had a truly fucked up sense of humor, Harry’s gaze was met by the wide-eyed stare of Draco Malfoy, a mixture of confusion, disgust, and something that curiously resembled desire swirling in his grey eyes.
Draco hummed above him and placed both hands on Harry’s cheeks, leaning down and pressing a chaste, almost inexperienced kiss to his lips. Then he pulled back, hands resting on the nape of Harry’s neck, fingers dancing over his skin, “How was that?”
Then the blade was twisting until just the edge was pressed against my skin, the sharp tip teasing me but not yet giving me the pressure I desired.
And that’s when Draco made his way over to the bed, crawling toward Harry in a way that had him shivering with desire.
Harry ran a hand through his mess of black hair, shaking his head and letting out a light chuckle before leaning back on his hands, “I’m so going to regret asking this, but what in Merlin’s name do you mean?”
Weeks ago, Draco would have given anything to chuck the stupid plant into the rubbage bin, but now… Now Draco felt a strange connection to the plant and a desire to keep it alive. It had become symbolic of his mother’s memory, and Draco certainly wasn’t about to let her memories die.
Harry probably should have said something romantic or sweet, should have ran his fingers through Draco’s hair or pulled him up for a kiss, but instead he just couldn’t help but ask, “What is the extra pillow for?”
Harry continued to cough and sputter as he tried to open up his throat around Draco’s length, his eyes watering and spit dripping down his chin as he descended.
But then, Draco was tossing the pillow lightly onto the bed and crawling across the sheets, pressing a hand on Harry’s chest until he leaned back.
There was something inherently sexual about Draco’s every movement, every facial expression, every sound that fell from his lips - and this was no exception. Draco made pissing look like an art form. It was no wonder the Greeks and Romans would immortalize a moment such as this in marble statues, an eternal stream of water falling from a plump prick, a look of pure pleasure on the man’s face.
In spite of all the apparent idiocy and annoyance Draco expressed about the dancing game, he found it nearly impossible not to smile, or at least laugh, while he was trying to keep up with the fast footwork required by a game that Harry affectionately called “DDR.”
After taking in Harry’s broken appearance for a moment, Draco reached down and unbuttoned his trousers, pulling the material back until his prick was revealed, the long, flushed length bouncing as it was released from it’s tight prison. The head was glistening and there was one jagged vein running from base to tip. Harry swore he could see it pulsing.
A pleased smile curled at Draco lips as he mouthed the lyrics to the song, running a hand roughly through Harry’s messy locks, his nails scratching against Harry’s scalp in a way that sent a tingle of pleasure down his spine.
Draco shifted his foot a little further, applying a light pressure with his heel until he saw Harry’s eyelids fluttering.
After what seemed like an eternity, Draco turned around and made his way slowly to Harry. He moved into Harry’s space with a determination in his stride and a fire in his gaze.
He let out a moan, shivering as Draco teased a finger over the trail of dark hair that led beneath the waistband of his trousers. Then Draco was pressing his lips just below Harry’s ear, breathing out a command, his breath nearly as hot as the request itself, “Shirt off. Then get on your knees.”
And then Harry felt himself being pressed back until Draco arms were dragging firmly across his chest, tweaking at his nipples through the thin material of his shirt.
As his tongue caressed the soft shaft, Harry swore that he could taste Draco’s piss, just faintly. And that alone had Harry moaning, suckling on Draco’s cock with desperation.
Harry stopped, pulling Draco back toward him, a glint of mischief in his eyes, “No. I have a better idea.”
All of Harry’s energy was focused in on being good for Draco, on taking his cock no matter how hard Draco fed it to him, on swallowing down every last drop of come that he was sure Draco would release down his throat.
But then Harry’s attention was drawn away as a voice came booming over the loudspeaker, “Happy Friday, boys! It is my pleasure to announce that we are all about to be treated to a deliciously sexy, jaw-dropping performance by a fan favorite.” Cheers broke out among the crowd, as men whooped and hollered, “So, please welcome to the stage… Drake Chambers.”
Harry loved everything about sucking a cock. From the weight of it in his mouth to the way it left him breathless. The entire experience was exhilarating and Harry never tired of it.
Draco’s eyes had darkened at Harry’s words, his body shifting imperceptibly closer to Harry on the couch, muscles in his neck tightening and releasing quickly before he spoke.
Without words, Draco nodded in the direction of their bed and Harry climbed up onto the sheets, settling himself back against the headboard, his legs spread in front of him.
Draco was about to bite out a comment about how he was in no mood for Potter’s dry sarcasm - knowing full well that the plant was nothing to write home about - but when he glanced over at the plant, Draco noticed something remarkable. Not only did it look healthier than he had seen it in weeks, but it had begun sprouting small, red buds. They were actually quite beautiful - mesmerizing almost.
As the song neared its end, Draco leaned back against the wall before making eye contact with Harry and launching himself forward until he was straddling Harry’s lap, a hand coming around to press Harry’s face into his chest.
But apparently Harry wanted to go a step further, as he hooked his thumbs into Draco’s briefs and pulled them down below his arse.
However, after that night, Draco hadn’t brought it back up and Harry had assumed that it was Draco’s way of communicating that he was not into the idea after all.
Draco spent the next few minutes losing himself in the sensation of Harry’s cock. He tried to memorize the taste, the girth, the long vein running up the right side. He wanted to immortalize this moment, because, fuck if he ever finds a cock more beautiful than this one.
“Stop your incessant moving, would you? I swear each bounce of your knee is shaking off dirt and dust from your filthy trainers and soiling my custom-made carpet.”
Draco stiffened, his defenses flaring up - Was Potter lying? Was Potter trying to manipulate him? “So you’re saying she just stopped for a fucking ‘chat’ with you in the middle of a goddamn war?!”
Harry let out a curse as Draco wrapped a firm hand around his bare cock, giving a few long strokes and savoring the slick slide of foreskin with every movement.
For some reason, Draco was not surprised in the least to find Harry standing on his doorstep once again.
Harry shook his head, leaning back so that his head rested on the man’s shoulder, “Just wanted to be closer.”
Harry merely rolled his eyes. But then he began talking a bit more coherently, so Draco would call that a win.
And in that moment, right before he pushed the tip of his finger inside, Harry couldn’t help but think,
The wet, slick sound of Draco laving over his hole filled Harry’s ears and the sound itself was enough to stir Harry’s cock - blood rushing to fill it warmly as Draco continued to lick over the most sensitive places of his body.
Harry’s breathing came out shallow as he considered Draco’s words, his heart beating rapidly in his chest.
Electricity sparked off their bodies as they moved closer and closer together. Draco sucked in a breath when Harry’s nose brushed along his jaw, and trembled when Harry’s lips brushed his own with the gentlest touch.
Harry choked, coughing and gagging as he fought not to bite down on Draco’s prick, the force of Draco’s hips sending his cock plunging impossibly deeper down Harry’s throat.
Hermione scooped a small spoonful of sugar into her tea, stirring it lightly as she continued, her facial expression innocent, “It seems as though their top performer is Draco Malfoy.”
“So, I need to ask you a number of questions before we get started, just to ensure that we are on the same page. I’ve reviewed your basic paperwork, but I want to know some specifics.” Harry nodded, watching as Draco waved his wand lazily, a roll of parchment and a quill soaring into his lap. “First of all, I need to know, is this your first time working with a Dom?”
A noise registered in the back of Draco’s mind and he pulled his mouth off of Harry’s cock, trying to tune back into the world for a moment.
In response, Harry licked a line up Draco’s chest and neck - tasting the mixture of sweat and alcohol that coated his skin.
But Draco did not have time to think about how sexy Harry sounded in the morning, because there was a MOTHERFUCKING
I felt Harry dab gently at the wound before moving onto my next scar. There were four in all. Four wounds that were inflicted on a day of such sorrow. Four wounds now reopened and tended to by the very boy - the very
This time, Draco’s shell really did crack, his expression faltering, something between amused and aroused overtaking his eyes as he looked at Harry. “Now? You know, I don’t just have endless time to spend with you, Potter. I have a rather busy schedule.”
When Draco came, it was akin to a religious experience. A bright light flashed inside of Harry as Draco’s come spilled inside of him, his hips stuttering against Harry’s lips as his cock pulsed from the force of his orgasm. Draco’s fingers tightened on Harry’s head, the pressure painful and perfect.
As Harry shifted to the scar that lay on my lower abdomen, I began to flash back to that fateful moment at Hogwarts, blood pooling around us as I faded out of consciousness, alone and sinking in pain and self-hatred.
“I want you to fuck my mouth until I feel like I can’t breathe. I want you to choke me on your prick, make me gag for it, I want your fingers twisted in my hair, I want your hips slamming up into my mouth. I - I want to be drunk on you.”
He didn’t want his orgasm to come just from touch, he wanted to hear it, to smell it, to taste it, to see it. And he wanted others to share in the experience with him.
Harry shifted his body, grinding back against the heat until he felt it swelling - a perfect crescendo - until it was nestled between his arsecheeks.
“You totally cheated, you wanker! I set it up for you and then you just got lucky,” Zane replied with a harumph, scowling as he crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco didn’t know what made him do it - he had never even given a second thought to feet in the past, but something about having his foot so close to Harry’s cock was turning him on. It was as if his cock was a magnet, drawing Draco’s foot closer and closer until it brushed, just barely, against the bulge in Harry’s denims.
Though Draco and Harry were the same age, Draco’s body was still so lithe and fit, he exuded a youth that drove Harry mad, especially now that Draco was playing it up.
as he got up from the couch, eyes glinting as he spoke once more, “You look like you’ve had a hard day. Maybe I can help you relax?”
As Draco rounded the corner and walked into the kitchen, he stopped dead in his tracks, Harry sleepily bumping into him after the abrupt stop.
As Draco closed the front door behind Harry and led them into the kitchen, something peculiar caught his eye.
Draco turned away from him and began dancing against the wall behind the stage, moving lower and lower until he was down on his own knees, his back to Harry.
There was an unmistakable hitch in Harry’s breathing and Draco couldn’t help but smirk, sparks igniting a fire inside of him.
As Draco tucked himself back into his pants - the dark grey pair that always emphasized the curve of Draco’s arse perfectly - Harry should have walked away, should have pretended that he hadn’t been watching. But there Harry stood, paralyzed with desire.
Hermione at least had the decency to avoid eye contact, but Harry could see a smile forming at the corners of her lips as she sipped her tea.
Draco set his book down on their bedside table along with his glasses, crossing his arms over his chest. “No.”
Draco’s heart was now thundering out of control, his head spinning while he poured two glasses of Mead with a shaking hand.
The pressure was gone for only a second before Harry was pinching and twisting my nipples with a force that drew a strangled curse from deep inside me, shockwaves emanating from my chest. Pain and pleasure surrounded me, whirling and winding like a braid, until both parts formed something new entirely.
Draco simply couldn’t recall a time that he had ever seen Harry so anxious. He almost felt bad for him.
Harry simply sat back on his knees and watched, admiring every inch of Draco’s body unashamedly, letting his gaze pause over the swell of Draco’s cock and the milky white skin of his thighs - which Harry would love nothing more than to mark up.
But there Draco was, reading glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, a book clutched in his hands, staring at Harry with a…. Well, what kind of facial expression was that, really? Distressed? Guilty? Sad? Unsure? It was a multitude of emotions.
Harry’s hand began to tremble as his orgasm built inside of him, tugging low in the pit of his stomach.
And so, Draco made the tea, Harry toasted a few crumpets, and the pair of them leaned against the kitchen island, heads cocked sideways as they watched flowers continue to blossom all over the tree.
Harry straightened up from where he was rummaging in his dresser and turned toward the bed in confusion, sure that he was imagining things.
Barely holding in a snort of laughter, Harry shifted forward until his body was slotted up behind Draco’s, one of his strong arms looping around to settle on Draco’s bare torso, stroking lightly over the warm skin and the ripples of muscle than lay beneath.
Draco turned around in Harry’s arms, eyeing Harry suspiciously, “It’s nearly 4 o’clock in the morning.”
Harry took in a deep breath, allowing the air in the room to fill his lungs fully, before he let it out.
When they arrived at the trees, Draco didn’t waste any time. He leaned back against the nearest tree and pulled Harry in by the fabric of his shirt, kissing him hard as he fumbled with his trousers.
Harry swallowed every last drop that Draco gave him, suckling on the head as he finally pulled off, even though Draco shivered below him, his cock over-sensitive as it pulled out.
He got up as quickly as he could and looked around for Draco, spotting his arse walking through the crowd and away from the stage.
They kissed and kissed until their pace grew languid and relaxed, lips moving in a sensual dance, slow and sweet like honey. They kissed until the kettle went off and pulled them from their reverie.
… you really are going to kill me,” Draco said with a sigh, his heart beating at a thunderous pace as a fire spread through every inch of his body - the intense heat a delicious combination of pain and pleasure.
His hand gave a soft squeeze at the base of my cock before I was left, hips trembling and body starved for his touch. When I groaned, Harry paused. And I felt both of his hands slide up and down my waist for a brief moment before they settled over top of my wrists, bound together at the base of my back.
Harry nodded, and Draco’s grip loosened just slightly, his thumb tracing over the sensitive skin of Harry’s wrist.
Draco pushed himself up off of Harry’s lap and began collecting his earnings, thanking the crowd as he went.
Suddenly the pompous voice registered in Harry’s brain and he whirled around, searching for the man in question.
I held my breath as Harry's blade hovered over my first scar, the one that lay directly over my heart.
Harry glasses fogged up and his cock twitched as Draco slipped his palm lower, lifting up the hem of his shirt so that his abdomen was exposed to the crowd.
Harry nodded, but then paused. “It’s not just rough. I want - it sounds pathetic, maybe insane, but I want someone to destroy me.”
He began to shimmy his way down Potter’s body, pressing a kiss to each of Harry’s thighs before grabbing hold of the base of his cock and wrapping his lips tight around the swollen head.
He imagined what he must look like, flushed cheeks and swollen lips, his head tilting back on a gasp until his long neck was exposed to Harry’s eager mouth. He imagined the hefty red marks Harry was leaving in his wake - bite marks visible in stark contrast with Draco’s own alabaster skin.
Although Draco’s cock was thin, it was long and Harry began to gag a bit around Draco’s length as he pushed down. Draco pressed harder to Harry’s head, forcing him to take in more of his cock, “I don’t give a damn if you’re coughing. I expect you to swallow me all the way.”
For a while, Harry simply watched the crowds of men, letting his gaze wander freely, eyes moving from pert arses to roaming hands, his stomach twisting with pleasure and a bit of jealousy as he watched a wandering hand slip below the waist of another man’s trousers.
“I’m not an imbecile. And I’m not mannerless,” Harry stated in his defense, swallowing audibly as Draco continued to walk toward him, stepping closer and closer until he was close enough to touch. “I came here to find a Dom. If that’s not what you do, then I’ll show myself out.”
Draco’s heart thundered in his chest, though he was not entirely sure if it was from the cacophony surrounding him, or the warmth that rushed through his body each time Harry touched him, each time he shot a cheeky wink in Draco’s direction.
After a long pause, Draco simply gave a curt nod. “Would you like to come in - ” Draco began, but before he could finish his question, Harry was stepping across the threshold and settling himself onto the crushed velvet armchair in Draco’s sitting room.
As the music began to build, Draco turned around fully, facing the crowd as he mouthed the words of the song, a passion in his movements that Harry had never quite seen before.
After pulling on a pair of silk sleep trousers and lending Harry the silk shirt, Draco pressed a chaste kiss to Harry’s forehead. He then let out a wide yawn and began heading downstairs on a mission to start a kettle for morning tea.
After removing their briefs and cleaning up with a quick spell, Draco settled into the comfort of his bed, with Harry Potter nestled in his arms.
The sheer power of Draco’s grip made Harry’s vision blur, his cock throbbing in his trousers, begging for more, “I did
Harry may have beat him at those Muggle games, but Draco wasn’t about to let him win at everything tonight.
Draco glared at him - though the act didn’t last long, and soon Draco was falling onto his back once more, his cock throbbing in Harry’s hand.
As Draco’s prick began to leak against the material of his trousers, Harry parted his lips and moved to mouth wetly over the crown. But as soon as Harry’s lips surrounded the head, Harry felt a sharp sting of pain shooting through his body, a hand now gripping his hair with painful force.
Harry tried to nod but Draco’s strong grip made it nearly impossible, so he choked out a breathless answer instead, “
Harry nearly passed out when he felt Draco’s warm mouth envelop his length. It may have just been a blowjob, but it was already loads better than any sex Harry had had in a very long time. “Fuck, your mouth is perfect,” Harry said on a euphoric exhale.
He changed as best as he could in the tiny stall - before stuffing his robes and the rest of his Auror garb into his wallet.
Draco hummed and drew the nipple back into his mouth, his eyes closing as he focused on suckling the skin.
Harry stopped dead in his tracks as he entered their flat, and Draco glanced up at him, a look in his eyes that had Harry’s heart racing.
Draco’s tongue prodded the inside of his cheek and Harry wondered if he had taken a step too far. But then Draco was reaching for his wand, waving it swiftly, the coffee table sliding out of their way so that Harry’s path to Draco was clear, nothing between them except an ornate rug.
As they continued to kiss, Harry fumbled with the maze of buttons and zippers on Draco’s trousers. When he finally got the damn things opened he let out an “Aha!” that he had most definitely meant to say in his head.
Harry’s mouth was like a heavenly sheath of hot, wet, velvet enveloping his cock. And it was perfect.
As Harry stepped inside, he took a moment to glance around the old room, now empty save for an armchair pulled over near the window and a small stack of books on the window sill.
Harry laughed, sounding delighted as he replied, “It's not magic, it's electricity. It's called a blacklight.”
It wasn’t until Draco began reaching out to gather the tips being waved his way that he finally noticed Harry.
“Up you get,” Draco requested, his cock twitching when Harry gave it one last lick, trailing from base to tip. “God, I forget how much you love this.”
Harry was surprised by the gentle touch of Draco’s fingers against his skin, surprised that Draco was even capable of such softness. Their sex so often mirrored the heady passion and tension of their youth - it was rough, primal, and run entirely on instinct.
The blade which had been teasing my smooth skin as Harry spoke had paused in it's pursuit. "Oh, I think we could have better manners than that," Harry stated.
Something in his gut was pulling him elsewhere, and he found himself walking toward Fred and George’s old room, the door cracked open, a warm stream of light pouring through, as if luring Harry in.
Harry gasped at the suction and graze of teeth as Draco sucked enthusiastically over his left nipple before shifting to the right. “Holy shit, it’s -  Merlin’s
“Mmm, perhaps. But your cock certainly did,” Harry hummed and gave Draco’s cock a particularly long stroke, pausing at the top to run his thumb under the head.
Up on the stage, the bass and guitar had ceased, leaving just the drums echoing throughout the crowd. Harry swore that he felt the drums inside him and the sensation had him shivering, his eyes closing as the crowd began to sing in unison, a choir of voices singing acapella, each note rushing over Harry’s skin and causing him to tremble.
Harry weaved his way through the crowds of men until he arrived at the bar. He ordered himself a shot of Firewhiskey and down it in one gulp - the burning sensation jolting his system as a fiery heat spread to his fingertips.
A flush spread over Harry’s cheeks as he suddenly realized just how intimately Draco was about to get to know him. “Well, it’s my first time with a professional Dom. I’ve done scenes with a few boyfriends, and I tried finding a Dom at a local BDSM club, but I - ” Harry ran a hand through his hair, avoiding Draco’s gaze, “- I just wanted something more. I wasn’t getting what I needed. And I wanted to experiment with someone more neutral, someone I could trust.”
To the surprise of no one - except Harry himself - he decided to hang on to that sliver of hope, as miniscule as it was, and he headed inside the club.
Soon, Draco’s hand was moving down, down, down until his fingertips slipped below the waistband of Harry’s denims, scratching his nails against the sensitive skin.
The crowd roared around them, their shouts and obscenities seeming to shock Draco out of his momentary stupor, and suddenly he was pushing Harry away and standing up - swaying his hips aggressively to the music as he continued the performance.
Harry’s fingers paused for the briefest of moments, before he continued removing Draco’s other boot.
while hopping on one leg. “Everything went so well last night! Weasel and Granger had to leave early, the club played my favorite song - twice!, you just ‘happened’ to buy me my regular drink, we had dinner at a Muggle restaurant that was actually decent, and we got upgraded to this beautiful room! It had to have been Felix Felicis, there’s simply no other explanation.”
Though there was no mirror in sight, Harry could imagine the image that greeted Draco as he looked down at Harry: swollen lips, spit dripping down his chin and neck, eyes watering with fresh tears tracking across his flushed cheeks, glasses knocked askew from the force of Draco’s face-fucking, and drops of sweat coursing down Harry’s hairline and following the jagged line of his scar.
But now that Draco had been housing the plant for a few weeks, he was beginning to regret it. No matter what magic Draco used or how much water he poured on it, the plant never seemed to grow. Yet, it wasn’t dying either. It was remaining annoyingly alive and Draco had half a mind to chuck the damned thing out the window.
But then Draco was leaning forward and grabbing Harry’s wrist with a grip hard enough to bruise. The strength in Draco’s fingers had Harry’s cock twitching feebly in his trousers. “No, Potter. What did I say?”
They had spent the remainder of the evening having a rather professional discussion on the matter, Draco asking Harry question after question, though no judgement seeped into his tone and no malice or mockery shone in his gaze.
Fingers twisted their way into his hair, tensing and releasing as Harry bobbed, sucked, licked, and kissed, getting Draco’s cock nice and wet for his arse.
Harry swallowed, turning his head to the side and wiping a string of drool off on his shoulder, “You said I couldn’t come.”
Draco glared in his direction, “Yes, Potter. We really should get your hearing checked, I think you’ve gone senile.”
It was as if the maze from the Triwizard Tournament had been recreated using brightly-colored and extremely loud flashing statues. They towered over everyone, the adults and the children, and they were rather intimidating despite their ‘family-friendly’ appearance.
At the look of shock and amazement on Draco’s face, Harry flashed him a cheeky smile, the white of his teeth nearly blinding him.
Draco pushed in closer to Harry, his hips pressing against Harry’s own and leaving nothing to the imagination - his cock already half-hard and pressing against the seam of his trousers.
“I only speak the truth, Potter. And the truth is that you simply can’t keep up with me sexually - ” Draco examined his nails nonchalantly as he continued, “I’d be best off if I found someone who could better match my - ”
It didn’t take long before Draco was coming, streaks landing across Draco’s stomach and the back of Harry’s hand.
Harry brought his hand up to his mouth and cleaned off the come, before flicking his wrist and sending a simple Cleaning Charm in Draco’s direction.
Draco cocked his head at him, curling his stocking-clad toes around the hardening length of Harry’s cock. The touch made Harry gasp, his jaw tightening, his eyes pleading - though Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was pleading for less, or for much much
Harry swallowed the saliva that had been collecting in his mouth, his cock twitching beneath Draco’s arse as he took him in. His gaze traveled from the coy expression on Draco’s lips, down his long neck, over the miles of smooth marble-white skin covering Draco’s torso, until it rested on the soft bulge in Draco’s briefs.
Harry walked with Draco on unsteady feet. Draco led them towards a thicket of trees that lay just beyond the stage, a tiny forest in the middle of a London park.
Harry heard Draco shifting and felt the mattress dip near him, “Spoon me,” Draco requested - though with Draco everything was more of a command than a request.
Draco began to squeeze his toes around Harry’s length. Sue him, this was a kink Draco had never explored, never realized he’d even want to explore, and
Draco growled in frustration. “You don’t understand! This plant seems to - it changes around - well, it -” Draco stopped himself after a moment. If he told Potter, he would sound insane. “Nevermind.”
Draco tipped his head back, taking a swig of the alcohol and twisting his fingers tightly in Harry’s hair.
Over the years, Harry had become increasingly self-conscious, worried that each passing hour was aging his body in a way that reflected the thousands of lives he had lived as an adolescent. His stomach was no longer flat or toned, his chest covered in a layer of dark hair, his arms not quite as slim and shapely as he had once become accustomed to, and there were lines forming at the corners of his eyes.
Harry didn’t let Draco say another word, reaching down to steady Draco’s head before beginning to fuck his cock shallowly into his mouth, his prick sliding perfectly back and forth across the warm cocoon of Draco’s tongue. Fucking
Harry licked his lips and glanced around, settling himself down onto a charcoal-grey loveseat, the cushions surprisingly plush.
Harry couldn’t remember the last time he felt so connected, so grounded, so in sync. His heart stuttered as he took in a deep breath.
“Piss off, Draco,” Harry smiled and pulled Draco in for a deep, toe-curling kiss. Draco’s own arms gradually made their way up until they were resting on Harry’s shoulders, his fingers playing with the hair at the base of his neck as they kissed and kissed and
As a single spotlight shone on a head of white blond hair, Harry felt himself walking forward, pushing through the crowd until he made it to the edge of the stage.
Harry quickly ducked into a stall, removing his outer robes and reaching for his wallet from his back pocket. Harry had never been so bloody thankful for Hermione’s expertise at Undetectable Extension Charms, reaching into the largest pocket of his wallet, and pulling out a plain black t-shirt and a pair of denims.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Draco teased before leaning down and capturing Harry’s lips in a heady kiss.
With his hands on Draco’s back for leverage, Harry led the pair of them down slowly until Draco was lying with his back on the floor and Harry lying beside him.
Kisses trailed from the curve of my shoulder to the sharp cut of my jaw. In my heady state, even the gentlest of touches set my body alight with arousal.
Harry pulled Draco’s cock out of his trousers, leaning in for a moment to smell it, inhaling deeply and dragging his nose along the shaft until it was pressed against Draco’s balls. Draco’s scent was warm and musky - and it was intoxicating to Harry.
Harry’s hips bucked into Draco’s touch. But Harry didn't have a chance to speak, because Draco was already pulling Harry’s trousers open and dropping to his knees.
“I can’t quite tell if you’re more excited about the reward or the punishment,” Draco commented, a smirk on his lips.
But just before he made his move, he locked eyes with Harry, his mouth practically watering, “The rumor where you are
Harry had a feeling that he wasn’t going to be getting more than one or two word answers, but he was so curious as to what spurred on this apology, “Are you apologizing for old stuff? New stuff…?”
Lips pressed against the sensitive spot behind his ear and an unusually husky voice spoke, “Why don’t we put on a bit of show?”
As they kissed, it felt as though the equilibrium of Draco’s entire system had been disrupted, the floor shifting beneath his feet, his center of balance becoming inextricably linked to Harry - regardless of where they were in space.
It took Harry a moment to realize just what Draco was asking. But then he was leaning in and running the tip of his nose over the slight bulge in Draco’s trousers, tracing over the length of it and inhaling deeply, letting Draco’s scent fill him up, the sensation intoxicating. Harry breathed deeply, expelling warm breath over Draco’s cock with each exhale, feeling it harden in his trousers, the material pulling taut.
It was an immeasurable contrast to compare that moment to the present, as I lay safely in Harry's arms. The pain was no longer a curse, but a choice.
Draco looked down at Harry with an expression that communicated an endless stream of emotions - though he didn’t say a word - arousal, mischief, apprehension, exasperation, hope, love.
As with all the other Muggle games, Harry proceeded to annihilate Draco - this time, with some truly exceptional dance moves.
After a while, Harry noticed that Draco’s cock was not growing as quickly as it typically would. So, Harry paused, let Draco’s cock fall from his lips with a wet
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. “Y-You went all the way there, just for me?” Pentrenelli’s was his favorite restaurant. It was something he had mentioned to Harry weeks ago.
A moment later, one of the women glanced over, locking eyes with Harry, a mischievous glint in her eye as she leaned up to whisper something in the ear of her partner.
When Harry looked up at Draco from the floor, a soft smile crossed his lips. The approval in his eyes said everything that Harry needed to hear. In that moment, he felt accepted, loved, and
“What in the - ?” Draco began, but before he could finish, Harry was gone, the door shut behind him.
He bobbed and sucked and kissed, exploring every inch of Harry’s cock until he was writhing, his fingers cupping the line of Draco’s jaw, his hips canting up into Draco’s mouth.
Grabbing drinks seemed to be a good way to distract himself as Draco processed Harry’s words, and he realized that this - this thing that they were doing? It was basically dating.
Harry leaned down, catching the shell of Draco’s ear between his teeth and letting out a smile when Draco whined, straining against the weight of Harry’s body as he held him down.
But then Draco was slamming the door shut and striding across the room toward Harry, a look of determination etched into his statuesque features.
Draco’s professional shell appeared to crack, just for brief second, but then a neutral expression returned. “Very well then, Potter. I require all of my subs to engage in a test scene before we sign the contracts. Would you like to schedule an appointment for the scene?”
“Well you won’t,” Draco snapped back with a devilish smirk on his lips, finally releasing his grip on Harry’s hair and watching as Harry collapsed in a pathetic heap in front of him, a blotchy flush covering his skin and a thin sheen of sweat shining on his forehead.
Their mouths fit together like puzzle pieces and their tongues were evenly matched in a duel. With every kiss and every touch, it built a crescendo louder and louder, their releases imminent.
He grinned up at Draco, “Considering how much you seemed to enjoy yourself, I would guess that you could die happily right now.”
“Are you saying that you don’t like my shoes, Potter? Because I don’t appreciate that. These are Goblin-made!”
The next several minutes were a blur as Draco turned on the shower, steam filling the room as he maneuvered Harry under the stream. Draco lathered Harry’s chest and abdomen, massaging his muscles as he helped to wash Harry clean.
After a while, Draco shifted, pressing soft kisses to Harry’s cheekbones, the shell of his ear, and the curve of his jawline. Then he licked a wet trail down Harry’s neck, pausing when he reached his collarbone.
Even as Harry’s body trembled through the aftershocks of his orgasm, he reached for Draco, guiding him up until they could kiss, his tongue tracing the inside of Draco’s mouth - tasting himself.
Harry actually had the gall to laugh, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise, wondering if this was some sort of joke,  “Excuse me?”
A beat passed where Harry thought that Draco was going to continue to ignore him, was going to pretend that he had never said anything at all.
Each time Harry came to, he could feel himself getting closer, his cock now fully hard, pressed hot and leaking against his belly, although Draco had long abandoned it, instead focusing all of his toe-curling talents on Harry’s arse.
Before Draco could even make a move, Harry was backing him up, plastering Draco against a wall of brick and kissing him senseless, grabbing at every bit of skin he could reach.
Whines and curses were building up below the surface as Harry focused in on the sensations around him.
And as Draco moaned around him, that was all it took. Harry trembled through his orgasm, cock pulsing out come across Draco’s tongue and down his throat.
“Do you think you are capable of waiting until tomorrow? Do you have the restraint?” Draco inquired, tilting his head to the side, his gaze dropping to the unmistakable hardness in Harry’s denims.
Draco was perplexed. He began to pay closer attention to Harry whenever he came for a visit. He found himself paying attention to the little details he wouldn’t have otherwise noticed. He began to notice Harry’s smell - a mixture of pine trees, coffee beans, and some sort of cologne. He would pay attention to the colors and fabrics that Harry wore. He even found himself noticing that Harry never wore a wedding ring of any variety.
Draco sat up on his knees and swung a leg gracefully over Harry’s hips, settling his arse down into Harry’s lap and cocking his head at Harry, “See something you like, Daddy?”
Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, unable to help himself, unable to contain the fire that was building inside of him.
Harry reveled in Draco’s gasp, in the uninhibited way with which Draco’s head tipped back onto his shoulder, lips parting in a moan, as though he momentarily forgot where he was.
Draco leaned in close, making sure he was out of earshot of the counter-worker, “Is he a Wizard? Why was he asking you about Goblins and Dragons, I thought this was a Muggle club.”
When they entered the bedroom, Draco reached out for Harry’s hand, pulling Harry into the center of the room, his expression soft. Slowly, Draco shifted onto his knees, but instead of reaching for Harry’s trousers, his hands moved down to Harry’s feet, removing his dress shoes and socks with a reverence that had Harry trembling.
Harry nodded in understanding and fumbled with his trousers as he rushed to show Draco the strength of his desire. As Harry finally pulled the trousers down, his cock swung free, the head flushed and pulsing, his balls hanging heavily.
As he looked down at Draco, Harry’s breath caught in his throat, in awe of the heavenly man spread out in his lap.
Harry considered the question, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth before he shrugged, a nervous laugh spilling out of him, “Don’t kill me? That’s probably about it.”
Harry let out a sound that was somehow a chuckle, a moan, and a curse all wrapped into one beautiful symphony that was truly music to Draco’s ears.
As Harry continued to prattle on about his cousin and the massive number of presents that he demanded to have each year, Draco looked down at Harry and had to swallow around a lump in his throat.
Harry let out a sigh and rounded the bed, plopping down beside Draco, “Ok. Well, what exactly are you sorry for?”
Just then, the man from the counter returned carrying two pairs of truly hideous shoes that appeared to have wheels strapped to the bottom of them.
There was something blissful about it all. Something inside of Harry seemed to click into place, something that made him feel safe, allowed him to relax fully into himself and his desires. It was freeing. And though Harry wouldn’t realize it until later, tears began to roll slowly down his cheeks until they fell into the tracks of Draco’s piss, the two becoming intermixed and intertwined as they painted their way across Harry’s body.
When they were toe to toe, Harry let out a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding. “I - I don’t know why - I’ve never before and -” A jumble of words fell from Harry’s mouth, and he could feel a flush rising on his cheeks and burning on the tips of his ears.
Draco cocked his head to the side, considering Harry, his lips twitching so slightly that Harry wouldn’t have noticed if he wasn’t so drawn to the delicate curve of Draco’s mouth.
“Two 45’s, please,” Harry called out to the man behind the counter - a bored-looking fellow with long black hair that fell in front of his face and a sharp nose that reminded Draco oddly of Severus Snape.
So, before Draco could make any attempt at getting up, Harry fell to his own knees. He shuffled forward until he could circle his arms around Draco, one hand resting on his waist while the other settled on his lower back.
It was not enough and yet it was too much. Draco’s body felt just as spent as though they had been fucking for hours.
When Draco turned to join Harry in the sitting room, he was struck by the anxiety that was emanating from Harry in waves. Draco could see the panic in the tense set of his shoulders, the flitting gaze of his eyes, and the rhythmic bouncing of his knee.
Draco sighed, placing the parchment and quill on the sleek black coffee table that lay between them. He then leaned forward in his chair, his gaze pouring into Harry’s as he spoke, “To make this work, it is of
Harry felt a hand stroke over his stomach, fingers trailing down until they skimmed along the strip of exposed skin just above the line of his denims.
He picked up and inspected the potted plant with immense confusion, his brain whirring as it attempted to explain the sudden and exuberant rebirth. Typically Potter’s presence seemed to bring more life to the plant, but this was far more ‘alive’ than Draco had ever seen it.
Draco blinked a few times in confusion before settling down on the floor beside Harry and stealing the coconut curry out of his hands.
Finally, Harry swallowed Draco all the way down, his nose pressed to Draco’s lower abdomen, his lips wrapped firmly around the base.
“Yeah... I like it all,” Harry said on a exhale, letting out a small laugh and wondering how the bloody hell he ever got so lucky.
Typically, Harry liked to spend his time in Ginny’s old room, as it had the best view of the garden and the evening sunset, but tonight, Harry felt oddly drawn in a different direction.
The grip around Harry’s wrist tightened painfully for moment as Draco’s eyes went dark, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. “Very well, then. I appreciate your honesty, Potter.” He let go of Harry’s hand, adjusting Harry’s glasses in a moment of uncharacteristic warmth, “I will send you home as you are. If you come, then tomorrow you will be punished. And if you manage not to come, then tomorrow you will be
The more that they fed into their desires, the faster things escalated, and soon Draco was practically ripping off Harry’s jumper before leaning down to get his mouth around Harry’s nipple.
And with that, Draco stood up from his chair, tucking his softened cock back into his trousers and righting his dress shirt. Then he walked swiftly to the door and held it open, gesturing for Harry to make his exit.
Draco fell silent, his heart skipping a beat in his chest. And as much as Draco’s cynical side wanted to think that Potter was full of bollocks and that his mother had done no such thing, there was a stronger part of Draco that was desperate for anything positive to grasp onto.
Harry focused in on the warm press of Draco’s lips against the sensitive skin around his nipple, the way that his tongue laved over the hardened nub as he pulled back, the sensation making Harry’s toes curl, his fingers spasming at his sides.
Harry swallowed and pushed himself up off the green velvet couch he had been sitting on, walking past the woman and toward a set of double doors situated at the end of a long hallway.
Harry felt as though the world was turning upside-down and he reached out for purchase, threading his fingers through Draco’s long blond locks and eventually beginning to guide Draco’s mouth on and off of his cock.
“Beautiful,” Harry whispered, his voice still rough from my cock. I recalled the feeling of bucking into his hotly pliant mouth, my cock sliding between swollen lips and reaching toward the back of Harry’s throat. I recalled the clink of metal as I knocked his glasses askew.
But more recently, Harry had come to discover that maybe he didn’t mind the extra weight around his midsection or the lines that streaked like battle scars across his skin.
As the bloke handed Harry the absurd contraptions, he spoke, “Did you one of you mention Goblins? I have a
And unfortunately, as much as he loved the Weasley’s, their annual Christmas celebration was no exception. But unlike the Ministry events that he could find ways to shrug off, and dinner invitations that he could politely decline, the Weasley’s knew his own schedule better than he did, and there was no getting out of this gathering.
“You want it in your mouth, don’t you?” Draco asked, though Harry knew the question was rhetorical. They both knew what he wanted. “Well, go on, then...
“You requested my presence,” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow at the deliciously disheveled man laid out below him.
The scratch of quill on parchment ceased. A beat passed where Harry wondered if he had said too much, if Draco was about to send him off to St Mungo’s for psychological testing.
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly as he caught a truly delicious glimpse of Potter’s arse in those trousers, before reaching to grab the bag of food that Harry had brought with him. “Of course I am, Potter. Why the bloody hell wouldn’t I be?”
Then Draco was shifting, lying on his back across Harry’s thighs and leaning up to capture Harry’s other nipple in his mouth, enveloping it in the same delicious heat. But this time Harry could see
Letting his eyes trail over Draco’s slim body, Harry noticed a matching leather harness sitting low on his waist and leather garters wrapped around his thighs.
In the back of Harry’s consciousness, he registered wet kisses cleaning up the come from his belly - leaving no evidence of the early-morning activities in his wake.
“Do you like pain, Potter?” Draco’s voice was deeper now, his tone rougher than it had been minutes before.
It only took a few more thrusts before Harry was coming - ribbons of milky-white come lining Draco’s tongue and the inside of his cheeks.
But standing there in his kitchen with Harry in his arms, Draco surrendered to it all. He stopped questioning it and just let himself
And with that, I dozed off in Harry's warm embrace. My last memory before I succumbed to sleep was Harry beginning to heal my wounds.
A smirk pulled at Draco’s lips as he settled back into his armchair, uncrossing his his legs and spreading them apart in a way that had Harry’s mouth going dry. “Having second thoughts?”
Harry looked down at his outfit, suddenly wishing that he had worn something more impressive. He didn’t think that the man he was meeting would much appreciate his scuffed trainers or his ratty denims. At least his jumper was somewhat presentable.
Letting out a sigh, Harry stepped out of the loo and attempted to fix his hair in the mirror. When it seemed as though his mop of black hair simple wasn’t going to cooperate, he headed back out into the club.
Draco bit his lip to hide a smile before leaning back in for another kiss. This time it was more open-mouthed, a bit deeper, but it still had a hint of that sloppy incoordination, and it made Harry’s heart stutter.
Draco swatted at Harry with a rolled up newspaper and then chucked a pillow-mint in Harry’s direction, as if the newspaper swatting hadn’t had enough emphasis, “Oh, shove off. Don’t play naive; I know what you did.”
The thought alone had Draco’s knees weakening, his body threatening to collapse beneath the sheer weight of
Harry let out a pained noise above him, but from the trickle of precome now running across his tongue, Draco knew that the only pain Harry was experiencing was from pleasure.
“I feel like I need a drink,” Draco said after a while, his fingers now tracing patterns on the back of Harry’s hand.
The words broke Harry out of his momentary stupor, and Harry suddenly found that he didn’t know the answer.
“Alright there, Malfoy?” Harry inquired, an amused look on his face as he unwrapped his scarf, folding it neatly and placing it with his shoes as he toed them off.
Harry stopped when he reached the opening of Draco’s legs, settling back on his heels and looking up at Draco for his next instruction.
important is that your mother was tasked with checking to ensure that I had died. But when she walked over to my body, she paused and… she asked if you were still alive.”
Harry should have noticed that Draco was no longer writing anything down, the parchment long forgotten, but he was far too lost in the moment.
Nodding and smiling politely to anyone who glanced in his direction, Harry slowly walked backwards until his heel made contact with the base of the staircase. Then, without a look back, Harry bolted up the stairs and looked for an empty room to hide out in.
“Yessss,” Harry hissed out, his glasses fogging up as he stroked a hand over Draco’s head, moving the stray hairs out of his eyes and trying to convey the immense love and gratitude that was overflowing in his chest. “Yes, baby. It feels… shit, it feels wonderful.”
With each touch, his pleasure increased, the warmth spreading from his core until it was sparking magic on the tips of his fingers.
Draco nodded without a second thought, and then Harry was taking his hand and leading him swiftly across a black carpet striped with neon brights, while colors and shapes were flashing by him in a whirlwind as they moved.
As they kissed, it was as though Harry was hearing the music in slow motion. Everything became a bit softer, slower, though it was no less intense. It allowed Harry to focus in on the pleasure that was thrumming inside of him. He was being pleasured by Draco as much as he was by the music. Waves of ecstasy rolled through his body and he felt his cock hardening in his denims.
Harry rolled his eyes and stepped into his briefs, tossing his wet towel into the hamper and turning back toward Draco, “Piss off. What did you say, though? Just now.”
Draco tilted his head to the side and considered the plant in front of him. And then he considered the boy behind him. The boy who was no longer a boy, but in fact, a man. A very handsome man.
He shouldn’t have been surprised when Draco Malfoy emerged from the shadows, a smirk gracing his lips as he stepped forward, but seeing Draco still made his heart jump and his body tense.
Draco ignored Harry’s question for a moment, far too fixated on what it would feel like to have Harry in his mouth.
Draco felt, more than heard, when Harry first saw it because suddenly Harry’s body was shaking with laughter behind him.
Harry nodded, though he wasn’t sure if Draco noticed. He certainly wasn’t about to push Draco for more information. This was enough of a revelation as it was.
If this was Potter’s taste in fashion, then Draco seriously needed to reconsider why he agreed to go on this date.
Harry pressed a kiss to the back of Draco’s neck, and before he could stop himself, he whispered, “I forgive you.”
Harry felt his eyes flutter shut as Draco suckled on his nipple, pulling the little nub of flesh taut, his cheeks hollowing. Draco had played with his nipples before, but this... this was so much more than that.
Draco’s hand stroked over Harry’s throbbing cock while Harry kissed him helplessly, his body grinding and moving of its own accord, the sexual energy taking over.
Draco could feel Harry’s cock growing hard against his thigh, Harry’s hips beginning to tilt just slightly, seeking friction, seeking
“Oi! That’s why it felt so stiff,” and then Harry was shoving Draco off of him and throwing the come-covered pillow onto the floor. “Why did you let me sleep with it in the first place?!”
“Look, I think it’s something you need to hear. Shit - will you just sit down for two seconds and listen to me?”
Harry didn’t even hesitate, throwing off his shirt and turning to face Draco before getting down onto his knees.
“Welcome to the arcade, Malfoy,” he said with a smirk, grabbing Draco’s hand and beginning to lead him further into the chaotic battlefield of music, shrieks, blaring alarms, and cheers from groups of Muggles huddled around flashing machines.
Draco gave him one last kiss before he nodded, taking Harry’s hand and leading them away from the stage.
Draco hooked his thumbs into his pants, pulling them down and letting them drop at his feet, leaving his cock exposed and perfectly at Harry’s eye level.
“Don’t stop,” Harry whined, his hands fisted in the sheets beside his head, his lips a deep red from where he had bitten them. “Please, don’t stop. I - I want you. Just like this. Just -
In that moment, Harry wanted nothing more than for Draco to pull down his denims and fuck Harry up on that stage. He wanted to feel the pounding of Draco’s cock against his prostate as music blasted throughout the crowd, lights flashing, all eyes on them.
Suddenly he kneeled down in front of Draco and began unlacing the ankle-length black boots that Draco had chosen for the evening, “Firstly, this is an arcade, not a club. Big difference, believe me. Secondly, no. That kid’s a Muggle. He’s just talking about a game - my cousin Dudley got it for one of his birthdays when we were young.”
Draco spoke as though Harry wasn’t in the room, making comments for his own benefit rather than Harry’s. And something about it had Harry’s cock growing harder, a flush spreading across his skin.
A grin spread uninhibited across Draco’s face as he stood, his back toward Harry. He quickly schooled it into a smirk as he whirled around, “The Weaselette didn’t say a word. I guessed and, lucky for me,
Harry needed no further instruction. He moved back onto his knees and finally wrapped his lips around the head of Draco’s cock. It was even warmer than he expected, the flesh hot beneath his tongue.
“Surprised you kept something alive?” Harry asked, coming to lean back against the kitchen sink beside Draco, his tone bemused.
He could still hear the music as it echoed throughout the park, he was overwhelmed by the smells of the forest, sweat, and sex, he could still taste Draco on his lips, as the sun began to set, he could see the golden pink glow on everything around him, and he could feel Draco’s cock, hard and throbbing as it fucked inside of him.
“I’m close,” Harry moaned after few minutes, loosening his hold on Draco’s hair. But Draco simply ignored him. In fact, if anything, Draco seemed to increase his efforts. “Shit. Draco, seriously. I’m really fucking close,” Harry repeated with increasing desperation, the tight coil that had been building in the pit of his stomach now threatening to burst.
set in the back if you wanna play?,” and Merlin, the kid looked hopeful all of the sudden and Draco was so very confused.
Normally, Harry would have opened his eyes, would have carded his hands through Draco’s silky blond hair, would have pulled him up for a languid kiss. Yet, something was stirring inside Harry this morning, a heat growing and swirling as he allowed Draco to explore his sleep-pliant body.
A rush of heat stirred inside Harry as he obeyed the instruction, the smooth velvet of Draco’s words running over his skin in a way that left him warm and shivering.
Harry ran his sweaty palms over his denims, taking a deep breath before he answered, “I want you to ruin me. I want you to use me without a care for my feelings or comfort. I want you to - to do whatever you want to me.”
A soft kiss and a pleased hum were all I got from Harry before the blade returned to the wide expanse of skin on my abdomen.
Draco let his eyes drag from Harry’s feet - where his usually scuffed-up trainers were now shining - up his legs to where Harry’s white t-shirt now glowed brilliantly.
Harry then leaned forward bed, beginning to list items off on his fingers as he spoke, “First off, Hermione is about twelve weeks pregnant and they left because she wasn’t feeling well. Second, your favorite song also happens to be in the top 100 list at the moment, so it wasn’t so much luck as it was inevitable that it would play more than once over the course of several hours. Third, I’d seen you at the club before and you always had the same damn drink in your hand, so I figured it’s what you would want. As for the Muggle restaurant and the room - I got recommendations from Luna on the best food in Muggle London, and the hotel thing wasn’t by chance… I - uh - I paid for an upgrade,” Harry finished, avoiding Draco’s gaze as he felt his cheeks beginning to heat.
Just when Draco was about to break the silence, Harry was grabbing his hand and leading him off into a sea of machines.
“You’re quite beautiful down there, aren’t you?” Draco murmured, reaching out and dragging the tip of his finger along Harry’s jawline, gripping his chin gently and tilting Harry’s head to the side, “Bit of a mess, though. Could do with a proper grooming.”
,” Draco sighed on a breathless exhale, pressing a brief kiss to Harry’s inner thigh before moving back in for more.
Draco gasped as the sensitive head of his cock peeked out from under the band of his briefs, his length straining for
It took only a few more insistent strokes of Draco’s tongue before Harry was coming - his cock spurting untouched, ribbons of come landing across the warm skin of his lower belly.
For a moment, all was still and silent, Draco standing over Harry with his soft cock poised and at the ready. Harry’s heart was thundering in his chest, his muscles tightened in anticipation of what was to come.
It was a Sunday evening and the pair of them had spent the day running errands, trying out a new recipe for Shepherd's pie that Neville had shared with them, and catching up on work before a new week began.
Harry chuckled lightly and he leaned down to bite my earlobe, sucking the sensitive flesh into his mouth. “Well, of course I do. But it’s far more fun to hear you say it.”
Behind him, Harry could feel a growing heat pressing against his arse. The pressure alone had his toes curling in his shoes.
They ended up talking for nearly two hours. Topics jumping all over, from an argument about the best Thai restaurant in London, to the weirdest thing they ever saw at Hogwarts, to the candidates running for Minister of Magic.
No more than a minute later, Harry found his skin growing warm, and pleasurably so. His cock began to fill slowly in his trousers, a familiar heat pooling in the pit of his stomach.
Harry let out a shuddering sigh, tilting his head to the side in a silent invitation - one that Draco accepted without a moment's pause, directing the stream until it hit the edge of Harry’s jaw. Harry allowed his eyes to fall shut, focusing in on the sensation of warmth spreading down his neck.
“Good.” Draco looked down at Harry with pride and lust. “You can stop now. I’m ready… if you want this.”
Harry nuzzled against Draco’s cock, feeling oddly animalistic and moving with his instincts as he rubbed over the hardening length with increasing pressure.
Draco shrugged his shoulders and rotated his foot slightly, dragging the arch of his foot along the length of it and feeling for the head of Harry’s cock with his toes.
Soon Harry was leaning up against the tree, with Draco’s tongue and fingers working their way inside of him.
“You cheeky motherfucker!” Harry let out with a growl as he reached out to grab Draco’s waistband, pulling him in for a rough and passionate kiss.
As Draco walked toward their bedroom, he stole glances at Harry from over his shoulder, something innocent and boyish to his posture despite the mischief in his gaze.
A moan fell from Harry’s lips before he could stop it, but he played it off as a sleep-induced noise, smacking his lips and shifting on the bed, letting his knees fall open and inviting Draco in even further.
Harry shrugged, “Well, you did eat my chocolate croissant the other day, the one Hermione bought specifically for
Then Harry began whispering in Draco’s ear, “I’m going to rim you until your hole is quivering against my tongue, until your thighs are shaking and you can’t help but beg for my cock. Then I’m gonna finger you, deep and slow, twisting them inside you until I’m rubbing against your prostate.” Harry could feel Draco’s cock growing against his thigh as he spoke, “Then when you’re trembling, about to come just from my tongue and fingers… I’m going to tie you up and fuck you.”
Harry clutched for purchase on Draco shoulders, hissing out a breath as Draco ran his teeth over the sensitive flesh of his neck. "
Draco shook himself out of his stupor and looked up - watching as a new flower bud grew slowly beside the first, the petals trembling much like Draco’s fingers.
“So, tell me, Draco - do you want more or less?” Harry asked, and though I could not see him, I could hear the smirk in Harry’s voice.
He called out Draco’s name, but he appeared not to hear Harry, so he did the only logical thing he could think of: he grabbed hold of the harness around Draco’s waist, pulling him back and catching Draco as he unbalanced, his back falling against Harry’s bare chest.
As Draco bobbed enthusiastically on Harry’s cock, Harry couldn’t help but wonder how a night of anxiously hiding from a Christmas party had turned into
Someone threw a can of beer in their direction, and with the speed and agility of a former Seeker, Draco caught it with ease.
