The two that had been sneaking up behind him made their attack, jumping at him with terrifying grunts. The little child tumbled from the swing in his haste to try and get away, crying out as he landed. The two children ran off, but the frail looking blonde didn't seem to be moving. Harry focused on him, taking the last few yards and sitting beside him. "Hey," he said quietly, gently lifting the boy into his lap. He weighed almost nothing and Harry felt a pang of sympathy, another one stabbing at him when he saw that the fall had left his nose bleeding. "Hey, there," Harry whispered. "You're alright. Here we are." He lifted his wand and the boy gazed at him with wide, silver eyes that were eerily familiar. "Episkey," he cast and the boy winced as his nose was fixed.
Draco called over from the kitchen, a small smile on his lips. "Snitches, Scorpius!" He always tried to get his son to try and speak full sentences, but at that age he didn't seem to mind. Draco shut one of the cabinets, grabbing the small cup of pills and a bottle of warm milk and walked his way down the hallway to Scorpius's room, his heart warming at the sight.
The little blonde boy stood innocently at the entrance to the kitchen, silvery eyes wide with wonderment and confusion as he took in his daddy's current state. "Or should I call him papa?" Draco wanted to smack himself in the forehead.
"Yeah, every one of them. Didn't you, Scorpius?"
"HARRY! HARRY!" A voice screamed loudly, feet pounding in to the living room. Scorpius slipped on the carpet, his hands catching him before his was up and running towards the brunette screaming bloody murder in the form of the Boy-Who-Lived's name. "Daddy is b-b-bleeding!"
Hermione looked between the two men, nodding carefully. "I see." And she'd have to talk to Harry later. For now, she caught his eye and lifted a brow and his answering smile had her nodding. For now, she was satisfied. "Well, I read through his files and I'm more than willing to help. What I said yesterday, though... I've just about confirmed it."
He'd been terrified of hearing those words. "Do you think you can help, though?"
He glared up from his seat, hand clasped firmly together on top of his desk. "Was that a threat, Potter?"
Scorpius nodded quickly, practically devouring his pancakes with pleasure, only stopping to take a sip of the glass of water placed in front of him by the elder wizard or to "feed" Perry small pieces of the delicious pancakes. "All done!" He giggled, clapping his hands after a few minutes.
"Two sugars, one creme."
He swallowed audibly and groaned, craning his neck back as his lips parted to let out shaky breaths of air. "While you're down there, Potter," he chuckled lowly, moaning enthusiastically. "Mind giving me a hand?" He ground his hips back against Harry's, shuddering at the contact.
"I'll bring you what you need tomorrow afternoon. I'm being sent on maternity leave soon, so I'll be able to focus on him more." She ruffled the boy's hair, smiling. "Draco... You really have done an amazing job with him."
"I think I can manage, yeah." Harry smiled slightly.
He gave a small nod, standing up and resting his chin a top Harry's head, a small chuckle escaping his lips at the awkward height difference. "Okay, okay." Sucking in a shaky breath, he exhaled, his shoulders relaxing slowly. "You really need to stop being my knight in shining armour."
"Draco," Harry murmured. "Should we talk about it with him right here?"
Chapter 12
"Be careful!" Harry called automatically, glancing at Malfoy as they'd spoken simultaneously. The brunette shrugged at the questioning look he received in return. "I spend a lot of time with my godson, Teddy. He's always running after something."
Scorpius popped his head out from between the elder wizards' arms, smiling widely and giggling, snuggling up in their arms. Draco smiled at Harry, glancing back down at his son and kissing his head. Draco had never really been optimistic, but maybe now it was the time to turn that around and come out of the metaphorical dungeon that he shoved himself in when he found out his son was sick.
Draco shook his head, leaning back against the plain piece of linoleum and gazing at his son, arms coming to cross over his chest. He wouldn't bother telling Potter that he was awoken by a pesky owl with an "urgent" message telling him that Scorpius' Healers appointment for tomorrow had been cancelled as something "urgent" had come up- Which just, in fact, meant that the Healer that would be overseeing Scorpius that day didn't want to deal with the Malfoy name. He gave a small sigh.
Chapter 2
Chapter 3
Draco gave a small shudder, his breathing short and shallow. He tried opening his mouth, tried speaking some form of any word but only small whimpers came past his lips as he cried his heart out on Harry's shoulder. For the first time in a long time, Draco Malfoy cried. Not when his wife divorced him to go off with some wizard man across the world, not when his father was found dead in his cell in Azkaban, and not when his mother disappeared off the face of the earth. But, now that his son had a death day already marked on his too-short life, Draco Malfoy let the sobs wrack his chest, clutching to Harry bloody Potter as if he were the last thing he had left in this pathetic little world.
"How do you not know?"
"I..." Harry swallowed thickly, heart thudding almost painfully against his ribs. "I don't want you to want me out of gratitude. I want you to just... want me," he whispered.
Scorpius hiccuped, his eyes watering as he clung to his father. "I still love you daddy! W-Wif or wif out magic! Don't hate me because I'm sick, please! I-I didn't mean to make you los-lose your magic!" The little blonde was stuttering, his words jumbled and lisped as he sobbed quietly against his fathers chest.
"I'm not taking your bedroom. The couch is fine." He could just transfigure it into a bed if he wanted.
Draco smirked, leaning back against the counter and running a hand through his tousled hair. "And what do I get out of that? You seem to forget, dear Harry, that I'm a sneaky little Slytherin, and we don't do anything without getting something in return."
Harry looked down at the boy, unable to help the smile. "Do you really?"
He gave a quick roll of warm silver eyes before standing, pulling himself completely away from the brunette and walking the few feet across the kitchen to grab his wand and re-conjure his shirt, readjusting himself and zipping his trousers back up before sending a small smirk Harry's way. "You might want to dress again before you traumatize my poor innocent five year old."
Only a year. An unseen hand reached into Harry's chest and tightly squeezed his heart. That child only being around another year, getting worse as he went, was painful to think about. "Hermione..."
"B-B-Bathroom." His eyes were wide and watering, tears dripping down against his cheeks as his little bottom lip quivered. Perry was nowhere in sight.
"Hermione," he returned. And ignored her sigh, plowing on. "He's five, almost six," he began, knowing that would get her. He was the same age as Hugo.
He ruffled the boy's hair before going to the fridge to locate milk. "You're welcome. Did Perry enjoy the ride?"
"Her-my-ninny!" Scorpius screamed, wiggling violently to get out of Draco and Harry's grasps before taking off down the hallway, almost running face first in to the wall outside of his bedroom, his socked feet almost not able to turn fast enough.
Draco pulled Harry's bottom lip between his teeth, hands wandering and caressing the supple skin beneath his shirt. His heart thundered in his chest, his thoughts running rampant in his brain. After all the years of wondering, the passing thoughts and the long glances, this is what it was finally like to kiss Harry bloody Potter. A soft moan escaped his lips. Merlin he could get used to it.
Draco swallowed, sitting up and turning his body around, ignoring their nakedness he reached out and caressed Harry's face softly. His eyes were warm yet guarded, as if the walls of Azkaban had been knocked down just to be rebuilt as if made from owl feathers. "Y-You love me?" Right now, at this moment, he didn't care if his voice shook. If he finally had a chance, no matter how marginally small, to finally find a love that he just knew would work, he would take it. Pride be damned. It's not like he had much left as a vault-empty, property-stolen, wifeless Malfoy with a sick child. Scorpius was enough for him. But this..
Hermione, rather stunned by this, was about to ask, but Harry beat her to it. "Why in the world don't you have your wand? Did someone take it?" His auror instincts kicked in, his hold on Scorpius becoming a bit more protective.
"Godric, Draco." Harry's shoulders sagged in relief, heart still racing from the momentary panic. "There, Scorpius, see? He's just fine."
Draco felt Harry's orgasm, his lip and hand covered in warm liquid as he panted harshly against Harry's chest, forehead resting on a sweat-slicked shoulder. "M-Merlin..." he panted quietly.
Draco smiled sadly, shaking his head. "Sorry little man, no more. You can't handle the sugar."
He tilted his head, a small meek smile pushing at his lips. "If I'm lucky?" He pulled the Gryffindor flush against him. "I think I'm lucky enough, thank you."
Harry gazed at him beneath half-lowered lids, eyes dark and amused. "You sure about that, Malfoy?"
Soon, Draco calmed, slowly but surely. He wiped at his eyes, rubbing his already red nose with the back of his hand. "Y-You can l-let go now, Potter..." He kept his head low, embarrassment flooding his cheeks at the current predicament of being practically cuddled like a two-year in Harry Potter's lap. He tried, and failed, to tell himself that he didn't like the feeling of the younger man's arms wrapped securely around his shoulders.
"Yay!" The little boy wiggled happily, thoughts swarming with little fantasy of all the bright colours that sparked from Mrs. Weasley's wand. "Does that mean daddy is sleeping over again?" The child blushed after a second, silver eyes wide with realization. "I-I mean Mr. Harry."
The little boy gave a small whine, crawling over the few inches to plop himself unceremoniously in Harry's lap with a small, tired cry of "apple pancakes!"
Chapter 17
Draco leaned his head in to the touch before he blinked, his eyes meeting those of shocking emerald green. He gasped after a moment, his hand shaking lightly against Harry's hip. "M-My wand?"
With a small smile, Harry rubbed his back. "Then let's just take it a day a time."
"Bye-bye, Harry!"
Dropping his mouth to Draco's shoulder, Harry bit in. A wandless spell slicked his hand, so he was able to grip a little firmer and move a little faster.
Seamus smiled abashedly, waving a wand-clasped hand from behind his now frozen boss. "H-Hiya Harry! Sorry about him..." He rushed forward, reaching around Hopkins and tugging open a desk drawer with a muttered spell. "Extendable Extension Charm!" he exclaimed, "Hermione's a genius, she is! Here ya go!" A wand was tossed Harry's way. "That's Malfoy's, innit?"
Before pouring the batter onto the griddle he found stowed away in one of the lower cabinets, Harry made his way down the hall and into the child's room. He was still asleep, curled up around his little stuffed unicorn, the covers only half covering him.
Draco sighed softly, caressing Harry's cheek with a warm palm. "I wish we could, but that amount of magic working on him only makes him get violently nauseated and his skin will break out in a small rash in the most atrocious places for a five year old to have to bare." He pressed his lips to a sweat-soaked forehead. "I'll have to give him a bath; sorry, love." The name slipped out before a conscious thought followed, freezing Draco in his spot.
Draco shook his head and laughed warmly as he dropped Harry's hand and rushed in to the room, picking Scorpius up from behind and spinning him around. "And what is the heir of the Malfoy name doing playing with a unicorn?" Draco dropped the expression, adopting one of cool indifference.
Draco gasped, a soft string of moans leaving his lips as he ground his hips against the others, hands and lips greedily tracing every inch of skin he could reach as Harry did whatever the fuck it was he was doing, but Merlin it felt wonderful.
"Good job," Harry praised, setting a small plate of pancakes before him and whisking the two cups away. He bent over to place a kiss on the top of his head, unable to resist.
"All done and sticky." Harry laughed, setting aside his cuppa to clean the boy again. He couldn't resist pressing a light kiss to his cheek. "Go and wake him up, alright? I'll start cleaning up."
Draco took in a shuddering breath, swallowing audibly as he flicked his wand just marginally and the cuppa on the coffee table not even a meter away burst into shards, sending pieces of green glass across the room. Draco gave a small smile.
Harry hooked his leg around Draco's and curled his fingers into his shirt, pinning him on his back on the bed in one quick flip. He pressed their hips together, his own grinding down, and his teeth went at Draco's neck in quick little nips. "I think I just might be able to."
Hermione took in the sight of the bandages, murmured a spell that healed the little scrapes that covered him. "Thank you." With a satisfied nod, she carefully laid her wand against the center of the child's palm and watched as a new blue light shimmied erratically. There was nothing normal about any of these readings; these were patterns and colors she'd never seen nor heard of before. Hermione gazed at the child, searching for any ill-effects from the use of her magic near him. There didn't seem to be any sort of issue.
Draco gave a small start at the offer, looking down at Scorpius who gazed back up at his father with wide, pleading eyes, his lower lip quivering. "Please daddy? The nice auro-ro-" Scorpius stuttered over the word, catching his tongue as he tried to pronounce it. "Wizard-man saved me!"
"You aren't pregnant this time," the wizard argued and the look Hermione sent him had him sighing. "Not as pregnant."
Harry gave a small start before smiling widely and trailing behind the blonde. Bath time. Let the fun ensue.
The blonde's lips parted eagerly, one hand coming up to push through Harry's hair, tangling his fingers in unkempt brown locks.
Harry was irritated. Absolutely and completely irritated. After dropping the papers off at Hermione's place, transferring all control of Scorpius's medical well-being to her more than capable hands, he'd come to the Ministry... and had gotten the run-around. Getting Draco Malfoy's wand back was taking hours that Harry didn't want to spend at the bloody Ministry. He was sent from the First Level to the Tenth and back again and now, in the Wizengamot Administration Services on the Second Level, he was resisting the urge to gnash his teeth together.
"At least..." Harry moaned, hips bucking up into Draco's. "At least we can certainly handle each other."
Coughing to clear his throat, Draco nodded. "Yes Scorpius, H-Harry's right." He reached over, rubbing a hand over his son's back soothingly. "But you are right, Harry does make me happy. So maybe he'll be your papa soon." The blush that was evident on Draco's cheeks told that he wouldn't mind the fact of Harry being a father to Scorpius.
"Thanks, Hermione. You're the best."
"Go on," she murmured, finally stopping fully to pay attention to him.
"O-Oh Scorpius..."
"Just making sure," Harry replied, a hand lifting and pressing against the small of Draco's back, nudging him the slightest inch closer.
Harry reached out, touching the scars before he realized he'd lifted his hand. But he didn't drop it when he noticed, only lifting his gaze to meet the blonde's, a mute apology in his eyes.
"Mm," was all she said, leaning back and picking up quill and parchment to jot down several notes.
That had been one week before he'd found Scorpius coughing up blood all over his bed. That was a day Draco would never forget...
A blush found it's way to Draco's cheeks, the blonde ducking down to bury his nose in equally blonde hair with a small mumbled 'We'll see about that, P-Potter.' Scorpius looked on in confusion before jerking his head up, almost clonking Draco in the nose.
Harry leaned forward, straightening to his full height and glaring daggers at the Hufflepuff he hardly even recognized. "That wand is just as much mine as it is his." His chin angled dangerously. "Unless you've completely forgotten, I killed Voldemort with that wand. And I'm also legal guardian of his cousin, making me family." And even he knew that was stretching it a little, but Hopkins didn't need to know that.
His father couldn't help but laugh at that, giving a quick nod of his head. "Okay, Potter. Since Scorpius agrees, why not?" What more dignity do I have to lose? "Lead the way." He hoped the cheers of happiness from Scorpius made this worth it. Why did Harry bloody Potter have to appear at the worst of times? Or... was it the best? He shook his head.
Harry shuddered, his own hand jerking away from the hawthorn as if burned.
He moaned as his tongue met Harry's, his thoughts racing with the knowledge that he was finally kissing the man that saved his son- saved him. His hands drifted down, his fingers dancing beneath the hem of Harry's shirt to run across the warm skin beneath.
"He seems to be a very lovely unicorn," Harry praised, laughing softly. "Come on, kiddo. Let's go meet Hermione. I'm sure she'd like to meet Perry there, too."
"N-No he's not! L-Look!" Scorpius pointed a shaky finger at Draco's face, his father looking down at him with a raised eyebrow. "B-B-Blood!" The little child squeaked as if he were about to kneel over.
Harry's head fell back after a moment, breaking the kiss. "Tonight," he said, voice low and husky, "after Scorpius goes to sleep, we're going to find out just how much we can handle."
Draco gave a small hiss, a small cringe as he gently touched his lip. "T-Thanks, Po- Harry." He grabbed a towel, dabbing away the blood before smiling in to the mirror. No blood? He turned his head side to side and grinned again, checking his teeth for any signs of the red liquid as well. No.
Hermione set aside the parchment, vanishing the colors with another flick of her wand. She reached out, offered a smile. "May I see your hand, Scorpius?"
Harry took a hold of Draco's hand, tugging him close. "What happened?"
Considering which side of the war the Malfoy family had been on, Harry rather doubted that they'd been to too many healers. "If they don't know what it is, do they at least know a little of what's going on? He's... He looks way too small."
"Let go," Harry breathed, nibbling his earlobe. "Let me hear the sound you make when you let go."
And Draco hadn't even had his wand. It could've been so much worse. Harry wrapped his arms carefully around the other man. "And you told me to be careful?"
"My pretty little head?" he repeated, smile wry.
Draco gave a small nod, picking Scorpius up and gently helping him climb over a log that rested against the curb of the sidewalk. The little boy gave a small smile and a 'thank you!' But, it came out more like 'fank yew!' as Scorpius was still missing one of his front teeth. The elder blonde smiled and pecked the boys rosy red nose before setting him on the ground. "Me and daddy live in a place wif Muggles!" Scorpius giggled, clapping his hands, his gaze bright and full of wonderment.
Walking past the slides, teeter-totter, and even the sand pit (his little five year old hated the damn thing), Draco still had not found his own little shock of blonde hair. His heart was quickly exploding in his chest, his grip tightening against the weathered brown strap of his messenger bag. A bright flash of blonde had Draco jerking his head around, a small hiss escaping his lips at the flash of pain.
A few seconds later, Scorpius came running in to the living room, his towel clutched to the front of his body, his naked bum in the air as he ran around giggling. "But daddy! I don' wanna bath!" The little blonde boy raced around the couch, giggling and hiding before giving a shrill cry of "Harry!" and running up to him, clinging to his leg and hiding behind him, giggling quietly as his dad came rushing in to the living room.
Harry slipped a leg between Draco's, thigh pressing into his groin, hands dropping to his waist to somehow try and get him closer.
Harry looked down at his hands a moment before hesitantly wrapping an arm around the blonde and giving him a gentle squeeze. "I'll, ah, be back. I just need to go and get a few things from my flat."
Draco tilted his head to the side, showing an expanse of silky white skin. "Oh really? And what did you think of the so-called 'previous' Draco?" He purred, pushing his hips back against Harry's with a small roll.
"Nothing," he murmured reassuringly.
Chapter 7
The fingers tracing random patterns over the arm that was locked securely around his waist froze. "L-Love?" His whisper was low, almost a simple breath from between his lips. He truly hoped to Salazar that Harry couldn't feel his heart pounding against his chest.
A blush slowly spread its way across the elder Malfoy's cheeks as he pushed away from the brunette and stood, albeit on wobbly legs. "Y-Yes well, what my child does and what I do are very different."
"But I'm clearly excellent at it." He tilted his head back, smiling.
The little boy nodded with a wide smile, oblivious to the tense atmosphere of discussing his own death date. "Okay, daddy!" He meandered away after picking Perry up and zooming out of the room.
Chapter 13
"Sweet Merlin, you're gorgeous," Harry managed, closing both hands over Draco's shaft to double his efforts.
Draco let out a breath, nodding his head. "Okay... okay. Fine Potter, you can stay the night." He reached over, grabbing the semi-large stack of papers before realizing that he didn't have a quill. He didn't even make a move to conjure one, standing up and marching over to the small bookshelf in the corner of the room. He grabbed a quill and a well of ink and walked back to the couch, plopping down unceremoniously with his feet tucked under him. "Blankets are in the cupboard at the end of the hallway and you can use my bedroom if you so wish." The 'it's not like I'm going to be getting much sleep anyway' went unsaid.
There was a dull thud from within the apartment and a squeal of laughter as a dorm slammed open and there was a padding of feed against the wooden floor.
"Is Mrs. Her-my-ninny coming ober again?"
The bathroom door was swung open, Draco leaning a hip against the counter as he poked and prodded at his own lip that was split open, blood dripping down his chin and into the sink. "Scorpius doesn't do well with blood when it's coming from other people. His own blood seems to fascinate him." The blonde rose an eyebrow, looking at his face from side to side in the mirror as he wiped away some of the blood with a hiss and a small grimace of pain.
Scorpius grumbled, copying his father's expression and crossing his arms over his little chest as he was held up in the air. "It was being mean to Mrs. Her-my-ninny. And you always told me to be nice to lady-people so I was teaching him to be nice to Mrs. Her-my-ninny."
The question was nearly lost on Harry, who was busily drinking in the sight of shirtless Draco Malfoy. He cleared his throat, a hint of pink touching his cheeks when he realized it and he grinned down at Scorpius. "Of course you can help."
Draco got Scorpius settled with a small glass of apple juice at a little table in the corner of the bustling cafe before he glanced up at Harry from under the fringe of his bangs, setting his messenger bag down beside him. "We... we don't know."
"Hermione wants to see him again, later tonight after she's had time to review his files. Is that alright?"
Having been gone the better half of an hour, Harry came back to the sight of Draco curled up at the edge of the couch, his arms cushioning his head as he slept deeply. His hair fell in to his eyes, his lips slightly parted as his chest rose and fell with gently breaths. The parchments and quill lay forgotten on the coffee table.
"I know; I'm still sorry. He's a great kid, y'know. You've managed to do one hell of a job raising him."
Harry's eyes narrowed a fraction as he wondered just what was going on in the blonde's mind. "Right," he said quietly and then flicked his attention back to the boy. "Ready to get out of here?"
The little boy nodded after an encouraging smile from both Harry and Draco, holding out a little, pale hand. He liked Harry... he thought as Hermione grasped his hand gently. Harry protected him just like Daddy. Maybe Harry would figure out what was wrong with him so he could get all better and so his daddy would be happier. His daddy has been very sad since Scorpius got sick, he just wanted it all to go away. His arm tightened around the unicorn. He wanted to get better, to make his daddy happy.
The child nodded happily as he was placed on Draco's hip, the elder Malfoy walking into the kitchen and looking around with a small smirk. "Well, Potter, it looks like you've managed to not destroy my kitchen."
Harry smiled. "How about later tonight? We'll come to you."
"I will," Harry assured her and tucked Draco closer as she floo'd home. "We're not just going to let him die," he murmured, lips brushing the blonde's ear as he spoke.
Said auror had watched the exchange with interest. He was clearly missing something here. A brow arching, he gave a meaningful look at Scorpius and back up to Draco, quietly asking just what was happening. He'd pegged the child at no more than four, yet he didn't seem quite that young when he spoke. So why was he so small?
"And modest," Draco smiled warmly, rolling his eyes. "As well as a little sneak!" He reached over, tickling Scorpius wildly.
With a laugh, Harry gave a nod and swept out. He headed down the hall to his own office, where he could leave by floo. Hopefully, Draco had kept his open. He took a pinch of powder from the little canister on his mantle and tossed it in. "Malfoy Flat," he said clearly and stepped through, coming out with a small stumble into Draco's living room. One of these days, he'd be able to floo perfectly.
"You can't go if you're not dressed," Harry pointed out. "Why don't you and Perry go pick something out while your daddy and I talk about really boring adult stuff?"
Draco nodded, going back to the parchments with a renewed vigour. If there was anyone that could help Scorpius, it was Hermione Weasley. He didn't even look up as Harry floo'd away, the scratching of his quill sounding loud and almost relaxing in the dark flat.
Scorpius was trying to climb into the bathtub when Harry walked in, his rubber ducky already floating about, charmed with magic to squeak every once in a while and squirt water.
Chapter 20
Draco paused for a moment before he broke out in warm laughter, pulling Scorpius in to his chest and nuzzling his hair. "Haha, oh really?" Scorpius proceeded to regale Draco with tales of how Perry didn't offer Mrs. Her-my-ninny a chair when she floo'd over and how Scorpius was reprimanding him about how she was having a magical baby and her feets would be hurting if she didn't sit. Draco accepted this story with a small smile and fond eyes for his one and only child.
She sighed. "Harry, you say no other healers will see them and I haven't heard of this phenomena when I do my necessary rounds at St. Mungo's. This sort of thing is medical gold. You're either being lied to or they were on the wrong side of the war."
Draco tugged at Harry's hair, titling his head at an awkward angle and smashing their lips together, devouring Harry in a kiss as he rutted against the brunette's hand, moaning at the heat of his calloused fist against his cock.
The blonde let out a small gasp, pressing firmly back against the Gryffindor and lifting his arms to lock around Harry's neck, heart pounding almost violently in his chest as he kissed back, moving their lips together.
Harry tried not to stare at the newly bared back, removing his robes and laying them on the back of the chair before following the excitable child, but it was a losing battle.
That arm tightened its grip ever-so-slightly. Had he said the wrong thing? He hadn't quite figured out the labels for them himself yet, so what they did together felt like it mattered. Harry had long ago given up questioning every single emotion he felt, had learned to trust himself. "Yeah," he murmured.
Scorpius nodded enthusiastically. "Yep! We live wif lots of Muggles and witches and stuff! In a big building near the park!" His eyes lit up as he begin chatting about everything in his 'a-part-e-ment'. Everything from the red couch that he liked to jump on, to the cat named Severus (which Draco found Harry's reaction to humorous), and his snitch pajamas with his unicorn plush known as Perry. Draco cut him off there with a warm smile and a little tickle session. "Daaaaddy!" the little blonde cackled with delight.
"Draco," Harry whispered, smiling, "take your magic back."
"No."
Draco rolled his eyes, leaning over and pressing his lips to Harry's softly, shuddering at the tingling that found its way up his fingers and down to his toes. "I wouldn't have it any other way." Scorpius's loud cheers rang through the house.
Scorpius stuck his little pink tongue out in obvious disgust before grabbing Perry with a hurried whisper of "Run Perry, run!" and he zoomed out of the kitchen with sound effects pouring from his lips as he hefted Perry high into the air.
Draco let out a strangled moan, rutting up against Harry's hips and pulling him down to devour his lips in a kiss. "I take back - what I said." He nipped harshly at the others lips, hands tugging through straggled strands of brown hair. "You're going to be the death of me, Potter."
"Godric," Harry muttered, getting to his feet and smiling at Draco. "The timing around here's horrid."
A blush spread its way across the Irish-man's cheeks, ducking his head as if to hide the tell-tale signs of the redness blooming its way across his cheeks. "I-I will."
Chapter 4
Astoria had spoken nine words to the room, not addressing her husband, nor her violently sick son. "I will not have a defect as a child." She turned, storming out and back to the bedroom. That night she packed her bags and left, papers filing for divorce appearing on the kitchen table the next morning. Scorpius had only just fallen asleep after the coughing fit had stopped and a Healer helped pour a calming draught as well as a dreamless sleep down the child's throat.
Draco took a few moments to catch his breath before he pressed an open-mouthed kiss to Harry's shoulder and gently pushed the other off him. "Scorpius-"
Harry smiled, looking from son to father. "Am I?"
"Hm?" Distracted from his own thoughts, the hand that had been stroking Draco's back paused. "Almost-lovers, I reckon. Hopefully the 'almost' can get dropped tonight because I would very much like to make love to you, Draco."
Draco jerked his head up from coming his fingers through Scorpius' hair, nodding his head. "Okay... Come on, Scorp." He glanced in to the cup that sat on the dark wood dresser. "All taken?" He muttered as he glanced back at Scorpius, standing up and stretching with a yawn.
The little boy buried his face against his fathers shoulder, Draco nodding his head politely. "Granger. You look well." He took notice of the hand resting against her stomach and offered her a place to sit. "Scorpius, say hi," he chided lightly, a small sense of laughter in his tone.
Draco chuckled breathlessly, trying to get some semblance of order over his clothes and hair. "Y-Yes, that's what happens when you have a rampant five year old. Be glad he sleeps like a log."
"Why not?" Scorpius questioned, arms wrapping almost near-perfect around Harry's neck. "You love daddy, and my daddy loves you-" He looked to Draco for any disagreement. To say Draco was shocked at his own son's words would of been an understatement.
Chapter 19
"Of course!" Scorpius smiled, playing on the plush white rug of his floor, moving Perry around animatedly to defend the Hogwarts castle look-alike that Scorpius loved since it was made out of charms that allowed the Whomping Willow and the windows inside to reflect moving people. It was Astoria's final gift to her child.
Draco thrusted his hips against Harry's hand, breaths coming in short gasps as moans slipped from between kiss swollen lips. "O-Oh gods... Merlin..."
The little boy giggled, clapping his hands and nodding before resting his head against his dad's shoulder. "Yeah..." Draco mumbled, carting his fingers through his son's hair softly.
Grinning, Harry swept Scorpius up into his arms. "I think we've kept Hermione waiting long enough, haven't we?" He lifted his wand, casting a drying spell on them both and then a warming charm on the boy. "Now let's get you into your pajamas."
"Harry, the last time you said that I went into early labor."
The two Gryffindors exchanged looks, communicating in a way that betrayed just how close they were. Hermione nodded. "I'll have Ron mention something to Percy tomorrow. We'll try and get that reversed. It's possible that being so close to bound magic is negatively affecting Scorpius's condition." Whatever that may be. She looked at her notes, frowning. The only thing she could see for absolute certainty at this moment was that his body seemed to be collapsing in on himself. At the current rate, she estimated a year, but less time wasn't impossible.
"Amazingly enough, I have figured out how to pick up after myself," he replied, lips curving.
The elder Malfoy smirked as he walked around the bed, pants slung low against his hips. He picked Scorpius up, pecking his forehead. "Let's go make me some pancakes, okay, Scorpius?" The little child cheered, clapping his hands animatedly.
"Does that make him my daddy now?" ...Draco froze.
"Let's get you some food, okay, Scorp?"
The elder blonde blushed, ducking his head as he pulled Scorpius against his leg, gently running his fingers through soft locks that only a child could have. "T-Thank you, Gran... Hermione. I tried." Scorpius smiled, tilting his head up to gaze at his daddy far up above him.
The boy giggled, the sound muffled by his Slytherin green shirt that was covered in little, baby-like silver coloured snakes. "Daddy-"
Harry nodded, gestured with one hand and wondered what he was doing. He bit back the sigh because, well, he did know what he was doing. He'd seen a too-small, too-fragile little boy that looked underfed and unloved and... What Ron labeled as his "saving people thing" had kicked in. And now it was just plain curiosity because he'd taken one look at his former rival and hadn't seen anything to rage against or suspect. He looked a little tired, really, and that alone would've knocked away any urge to fight. "Do you live around here?" he asked, tone casual.
Draco laughed warmly, the sound carrying across the room as he flicked his wand. Books flew from the bookshelves that lined the wall, stacking themselves on the table that had cleaned itself with another flick. A cup of steaming out tea flew out of the kitchen next as well as Scorpius' toys organizing themselves in front of the fireplace. Another laugh had Draco collapsing against the couch, a few stray tears pouring down his cheeks as he gripped his wand tightly.
Smiling, Harry tucked the wand back up his sleeve. "Let Dean know I said hi, then."
His hand closed around the base of the hawthorn wand, a gasp forcibly leaving his chest as the flat practically swooned. It bent under his magic, the wood of his apartment croaking nosily as Draco's hand closed around his wand for the first time in a very long time.
"Daddy! Juice please!" Scorpius smiled, holding out the cup.
He gave a quick nod, running his hands through his hair to push it back with a huff. A gasp quickly left his lips, his little body wiggling viciously. "Perry! Perry! I forgot Perry!"
"Oh Scorp..." Draco chuckled softly, a hint of underline sadness evident in his tone to anyone that would listen. Which, at this point in the elder Malfoy's life, was as many people that he could count on one hand.
The blonde just shook his head, waving a hand with a muttered, "Whatever you wish, Potter." He went back to staring at the parchment in his lap, fingers creasing the tips of the paper in a nervous habit.
The blonde nodded, walking over to the small brown coffee table and sitting down on the couch a few feet away, the red upholstery a bright contrast to his black pajama bottoms. "Okay... Okay." He took a deep breath, eyes slipping closed as he ran a hand through his disheveled locks.
With a laugh, Harry pulled on his shirt. His name still carried a lot of weight when he needed it to, particularly since he so rarely used it. He grinned at Draco. "I know how things work there. I work there," he reminded him. "I'll be back as soon as I can."
Harry laughed, wrapping his arms around Draco, trapping Scorpius between them. They were a beautiful pair that just couldn't be separated. He wouldn't let it happen.
Scorpius turned around, burrowing in to Harry's arms. "Anything?" he hiccuped.
"They've been to a few healers, but none of them have been helpful in the slightest. They say he's a squib with magic, but the magic isn't taking. It's turned on him, it's wearing him down. And no one can say why or how. The father's been to libraries all over the world trying to find something. There's nothing, no explanation."
Scorpius nodded, reaching a small hand into the plain red cup and pulling out a small chewy vitamin, placing it in his mouth. He chewed thoughtfully before reaching for another, then another, then another. He chewed the last one before reaching for the glass of milk and downing the small amount in a few gulps. "Harry! Done!" He did a little wiggle in his seat, placing Perry on the table and clapping his hands for his pancakes.
A blush spread slowly across Draco's cheeks. He coughed awkwardly into his palm as he stood, grabbing Harry's shirt off the counter and flinging it to him, avoiding his gaze and keeping his hands at his side. "W-Well... yes. Okay. Very good, Potter. I-" His shoulders slumped, his heart hammering wildly in his chest as he drop the facade and marched up to Potter- to Harry and kissed him firmly on the lips. "Just hurry back and be careful, you stupid Gryffindor. You have a little boy who would be crushed to see his new hopeful candidate for the position of 'daddy' not come back in one piece."
"He will," Harry promised. "He'll be fantastic. The professors are bound to adore him - who wouldn't? And everything'll be just fine. He will go to Hogwarts. He has a future."
"W-What will I do, Potter? What will I do once Scorpius is gone?" His arms slowly wound around his stomach, hunching over as if to be sick, tears dripping down his neck. "What will I tell him? C-Can I even tell him? Oh not my baby boy... H-he's the only thing I have left..."
"Disgusting," he teased before licking the blonde's lips.
"You're welcome," Harry murmured, getting the blonde under the covers with as little disturbance as possible before striding out.
Scorpius peaked in behind Harry's leg, clutching the fabric of his pants between his fingers. "Daddy sleeping?" he stage whispered, the noise loud enough for Harry to hear.
Draco rolled his eyes, nipping at Harry's bottom lip lightly, cautiously. "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Potter. You and I are on completely difference levels of 'needing to be careful.'"
"I like that you felt the need to check the time." Harry followed, wrapping his arms around Draco from behind. "Going to use your wand like a giddy seventeen year old that just got the Trace taken off?"
He gave a haughty smirk, leaning in to Harry's touch just slightly as he removed his head from the others chest. He paused, trying to form a sentence that was just on the tip of his tongue. "I..." A deep breath later, and Draco mumbled quietly, "Thanks again, Potter."
The little blonde boy nodded and giggled. "Yes! Harry made me and Perry pancakes!" At the word pancakes Scorpius picked Perry up and flew him around, giggling as he himself landed on his father's back, Perry clutched tightly in his arms.
Draco sat back with a long exhale, hands clasping in his lap as one leg crossed over the other. "Now, do you have any guesses as to what might be wrong with him?"
"Harry!" A voice called from the living room, jerking Draco violently back to reality and jerking out from below the brunette.
Draco gave a small sigh from across the room, approaching the youngster slowly and kneeling down. "Scor, you have to. I made the water slightly colder this time, so no dizziness okay?" Draco look at the child with a small, patient smile, but anyone could see there was almost a pleading gesture in his eyes. Draco had gotten no sleep for the past few days, it seemed.
"Okay, daddy!" Scorpius's grin was wide on his face, his pale complexion warm with a small flush of exertion. "Apples?" the little blonde smiled up at him as if the world didn't cast him away, as if he had no worries.
Lips to Draco's ear, Harry lowered his voice so Scorpius couldn't hear. "In your bed?"
"Yes, daddy!"
Draco accepted the mug with a small thanks, both hands coming to clasp at the warmth as he took a small sip, humming in acceptable pleasure. "Look Harry..." he spoke quietly after a few tense moments, Scorpius' chatter echoing from his bedroom. "I can't thank you enough, I really can't. What you're doing for Scorpius..." His voice dropped to a mere whisper, his heart thundering in his chest. "What you're doing for me." He swallowed past the lump in his throat, taking another small sip of tea. "I can never repay you for this."
"Scorpius, you see-"
Harry did as well, but couldn't stop the hot pants against Draco's shoulder. "Shite," he whispered.
"Don't do too much at once," Harry murmured, reaching out and touching the man's cheek. "You might scare Scorpius."
"Harry..." The blonde groaned, arching his back and not caring about anything but the feeling of that glorious hand on his cock as he watched Harry's fist move up and down along his length, stroking faster and faster.
"Thought he was a rather irritating prat, all pale and pointy and bossy." Harry bit into his neck, sucking at the raised skin. "And bloody snarky. I used to want to bite his mouth to shut him up."
"M-My s-son has o-one year left?" Draco stood at the entrance to the hallway, his expression one of the utmost heartbreak, his arms around his stomach as if he were going to be sick. His grey eyes were swimming with tears. His face already looking hagged and exhausted but now coupled with the tears, Draco Malfoy looked as if his world was ending, falling down around him.
The little boy shook his head. "N-No! I-I need to see if d-daddy is alright!"
Scorpius pouted, crossing his arms over his little chest. "Because baths make me dizzy."
from the Malfoy cat reminded him though, that he was on a magically altered couch. He'd lengthened and cushioned the thing to accommodate his frame during the night and, awake now and depositing the annoyed cat on the floor, quickly set about returning it to its original state, the blankets he'd used folding themselves and the pillows popping back into the books they'd been transfigured from. He set those back on the shelves manually before padding into the kitchen, idly scratching his bare chest.
He looked up and his eyes darkened further. He dislodged my member from his mouth and kissed his way up to my mouth and then nudged my legs apart. He took his hard member in his hand and pressed inside me slowly. I winced in pain at first. "Breath and push against me." He soothed and rubbed my thigh. I did as he asked.
At the first Wizengamot session after taking his titles is when he came out.
Draco seemed in awe of him. "He's more beautiful in person. May I hold him?"
I am happy for my adopted father. Truly I am. I am glad that he finally married the man he has loved and pined after for so long. I know what it's like to pine for someone. I just wasn't exactly happy to whom he had married. He married the father of my former rival and current crush. And now I had to live with them!
"Make sure they are the best!" Petunia yelled.
He looked up at me confused. "What?"
I have been healing mentally and physically for the past few months. Severus provided me with potions and a mind healer. He told me the reason he looked for me was his own concern coupled with Luna, Neville and even Draco's (which I was surprised but pleased at, silly crush I know) pleas for someone to go looking for me. Severus told him how it had taken him a bit to track him down. Dumbledore wasn't completely honest about what was going on. I shared my own opinions on the matter and told him what had happened at the end of last year. How after defeating Voldy, they abandoned me and made it quite clear that they had also betrayed me. Severus was surprised at that. Severus continued with his story of how he tracked me down when he confronted my muggle relatives. He eventually got out of them what they did to me. Severus was beyond livid at them. He cursed them and sent Amelia Bones after them. They would not be getting away with what they did to me. Severus caused the commotion at the hospital, where he found them to be confounded against helping me.
"Of course I do silly."
"What a laugh!"
I was getting fed up with him not trying to come after me. I had one more trick up my sleeve. I had set it up so that Draco would "accidentally" interrupt Blaise and I almost going all the way. To see if that would do anything.
Interviewer: "Are you dating anyone or looking to date someone?"
Harry nodded. "Yes. I am a guardian angel, thanks to Lady Magic."
Once upon a time in a far away kingdom, there lived a young small boy with black hair and green eyes, whose name was Harry. Unfortunately this young boy learned early on that dreams weren't reality. Harry's parents died when he was one, and with no other living relatives to speak of he was sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle, who had a young boy the same age as him. They did not treat him fairly. He was brought up to do all the chores of the house. He lived in the cupboard under the stairs and had dress in his cousins too big cast-offs. He was made to believe that he was a freak and unworthy of love. This is how he lived his life day after day. Cleaning, cooking, doing the laundry, weeding the garden, and anything else the Dursley's deemed 'unworthy of getting their hands dirty for'. His wicked cousin would always try to make things worse by blaming him for things that Dudley did or beat him up when he was bored.
"What other aspects are you going to change about the Wizarding World?"
Draco finds out.
ALL WAS WELL.
Once we were safe home, I put Ren in his new bassinet and watched over him while he slept. This little boy was my world now, and I finally realized what my parents had must of felt when they had me. I understand now why my mother protected me, because in that moment I would do anything to keep him happy and well. I smiled and told Ren, "You are so loved Ren, I love you so much, Ren, remember that always."
"Because I cannot be gay and an auror. That is what the Ministry told me. Why do you think Seamus and Dean left the country? Why do you think Charlie went to Romania to work with Dragons?  Why do you think George and Lee are just 'Roommates'? They aren't here or out because England discriminates against gays, while not illegal, homosexuals can be and will be fired from their jobs, and refused service. I would have to leave England and would never be able to come back. If you wanted to see me, you would have to come to me."
"Of course Harry, Come in." He said motioning me inside and to have a seat.
He would first make sure that no one could discriminate against gays. Then he would move on to other things, like making sure all children were protected, open wizard orphanages, bring back Wizarding customs and religions, get rid of classification on magic (all magic was based on how you use it), bring back classes cut by Dumbledore, make sure Muggleborns and Half-bloods take remedial courses in Wizarding culture and law, and Purebloods took muggle studies, and help get creatures their rights back.
Severus raised an eyebrow at him and sneared. "Foolish boy."
Hermione and Ron supported me the whole way. They helped me when I was feeling emotional and needy. They helped me through strange food cravings. They even threw a baby shower for me where all our friends showed up and I got so many gifts, it was great! I felt so loved. The only thing I missed was Draco by my side, but he was married now, and I couldn't face him.
He pulled back and pushed back in. He was making love to me. He rocked back and forth slowly and lovingly. It was perfect. It was bliss, but while it was nice I wanted more. I wrapped my legs around him and said, "Fuck me like you mean it Draco."
So, Harry did. He told them everything about Lady Magic and her deal. He even told them about his upbringing. He didn't want to hide anything from them.
Down with the bloody greatest wizard of all time! It would me turn to shine. My turn for revenge.
I smirked at him. "So does that mean you approve?"
When he finally found Harry's home, he was grateful to Hermione and Ron. He knocked on the door, his heart beating rapidly in his chest.
A few weeks later I was walking through Cannes, when I thought I saw Draco inside a Potions shoppe. I did a double take and indeed it was Draco. I was confused. Why was he here in France? I went inside the shop to find out.
"Oh I came to complete my apprenticeship and education." Draco replied.
My eyes softened. He's so sweet and perfect. "Yes."
Then it was Draco's turn. "Harry, when I saw that article about you coming out, I was so elated and relieved. I didn't really want to marry Astoria because we don't love each other and we are both gay. I love you. Harry, will you marry me?"
He nodded and bit his lip.
Harry thought about what she said. "How do I smite him?"
Harry just kept his head down. Harry knew it was a matter of time before Draco married Astoria, and he would just have to get over him. He just went back to work and at the next dinner night with Hermione and Ron, he ignored her knowing looks and her trying to get him to confess to Draco. It was just easier this way.
"I'll be okay Professor. I have my armor and sword." Harry replied.
"All those apposed?" A few wands went up. Sticklers for the old ways.
"My Dudley is better than that freak." Vernon agreed.
“Dong!” went the clock.
Severus smirked. That was when I knew I wouldn't like it, but maybe it would work, as long as I got Draco in the end, I would try almost anything, because it obviously wasn't going away and I couldn't avoid it forever.
"I don't know Astoria. Honest. I can see that that child is mine. I love him Astoria, but we're married. I made a promise to you." He looked at guiltily. He tried to show her that he meant it.
So, Ginny married Astoria and Harry married Draco. Neither really expecting that result when they woke up this morning. They used vows that came from the heart and conjured rings to suit their needs. Harry conjured a black snake biting it's tail with emeralds as eyes, and Draco conjured a ring that looked like a black and silver dragon with emeralds as eyes. Harry couldn't believe Draco had hidden this from him the whole time they were planning the wedding. Everyone was happy with how it worked out even Draco's parents, and the Weasleys. They just wanted to see them happy.
“I thought you said there were no other young men here,” said the Prince.
Severus nodded. "Come with me. Both of you." Harry gathered his armor and made sure Draco was okay to travel by himself. Snape led them to his private rooms, Harry and Draco both quietly followed him willingly, and gestured for them to have a seat once they were inside.
"Mr. Potter? Mr. Potter?"
I nodded. "Thanks Ron." He nodded and closed the floo connection. Well, at least I knew he was on his way to talk to me. I was curious to see what he wanted. I was glad that after Ren was born and Ron realized who had fathered my child still supported me. Hermione was supportive too, although, I think she already knew who the other father was.
I was fed up and didn't know what to do. It seemed Mr. Malfoy didn't even care Draco was bringing over so many dates. I thought he might say something, but he hasn't said a word. I wonder what he is thinking just letting all these strangers traipse through his manor. I thought he would care more about that. I guess not. I finally made a decision to approach dad for some advice because this isn't working.
"Oh no." He muttered under his breath and winced. He looked at Draco across from him and gave him a 'I'm sorry' look. Draco just nodded and went to get coffee.
I shook my head. "No boyfriend. It was a one night stand. Maybe my friends might be able to help me. I am not sure."
Severus and Lucius were very supportive of our relationship. They both were actually really happy that we had finally gotten together. I was glad that they approved.
As the details finalized and the day of the wedding grew closer, Harry grew more and more anxious. Finally, it was the big day, and Harry would be standing next to Draco as he wed his fiancée. Draco had asked him to be his best man, because he was closer to him than Blaise and Theo lately, they would still be his groomsmen. Astoria had Ginny as her maid of honor and Daphne and Pansy as her bridesmaids. Harry teared up as Astoria walked down the aisle. She truly was magnificent. Breathtakingly beautiful. Harry could help as his heart contracted as she ended up next to Draco. But before things could start, the couple smiled at each other and nodded and turned to their perspective best man and maid of honor.
When I reached France the next day I took a breath of relief. I was away from Draco and could finally look forward to moving on. France was beautiful. The DADA professor I was working with was great. They gave me an in-depth tour of Beauxbatons and the nearest Wizarding town. It reminded me of Hogsmeade. It was great. We also went over rules, the point system, house system and lesson planning.
"Maybe there is one more." Harry said stepping out.
She looked at him confused. "What are you talking about? Harry you are gay. I understand. I won't say anything if you don't want me to, but I thought we were friends. Why would you lose your job?"
The more I think about my crush, which hasn't gone away at all! Trust me I tried, the more I feel like it is more than that. I am starting to feel to feel things for him that I have never felt for anyone before and I have this sinking feeling that it is not going away any time soon. I don't know what to do. I am kind of freaking out about it.
Draco stripped off his water soaked pants as he shut his bedroom door at the end of the hallway, dropping them on the floor and flopping on his bed with a small, blissful sigh. He was out in minutes.
"Can't you stop it?" Harry whispered.
"Oh, Draco. Once a prat, always a prat." He grinned, fingers curling into the blonde's shirt. "Maybe some of my own sparkling personality will rub off on you. If you're lucky, of course."
"Stupefy!"
"O-Oh Scorpius... I-I'm so... so sorry..."
"Perry!" Scorpius waved the animal at Harry. "'Arry! 'Arry! T'is is Perry!" He giggled, cuddling the white unicorn to his chest, it's bright blue horn poking himself gently in the shoulder.
Harry's eyes narrowed a fraction. "Bad man?" he repeated.
For most members of the Death Eater crowd the Mark burned itself away, leaving nothing but a horrified scar. But for Draco, for some strange reason, only the bottom portion of the snake's tail had burned off, everything else still remained as vile and as... there as they were the day he received the damn thing.
After hearing back from Beauxbatons, I packed and let dad know that I was leaving. He asked for me to stay one last night to celebrate. I conceded that it would be a nice idea. I knew he would have the elves go all out, but I didn't mind. I wanted to celebrate also. I wanted a nice send off for my next adventure.
"Really."
"My friends know and they support me. France isn't too far where we can't still see each other if we want."
"Excellent. All you need to do to get rid of the mark on their arms is to call upon your inner guardian to set them free. This might be a tad painful. Good luck Harry." She said upon leaving.
I didn't know what to do. After I thought about it a while, I wanted to keep my child. I knew I would not be able to give them up when they were born. So I went to see Hermione and Ron. I floo'd over to their house.
Harry and Snape slowly crept towards the throne room where Voldemort was holding court with his inner circle. Severus looked at Harry and mouthed 'Follow my lead.' Harry nodded in agreement.
I laughed. "I have no clue. I still have a hard time with my feelings. You know this Severus." We had talked about this before. How the Dursley's didn't do much good for me. By the time Severus got to me, it was already ingrained in me that I was unloved and never would be. That I was a freak. I had a hard time believing anything else.
And now I look to my future and breath with a freeness I have not felt before. I step into my future not looking back, but looking toward what I can only hope is better and more beautiful than I could have thought before it was open to me. I step with a lightness and relaxation I was able to before. I fly, uncaged for the first time. I look forward to what greets me there.
"I'm sorry mate."
"Let's go grab some lunch."
It took a couple months of dating and getting used to being parents, but we eventually married in a small ceremony with our friends and family. I was finally happy with how things worked out. I had Ren and Draco. My life was complete.
I blinked a few times. "Can you get rid of it?"
Harry did his best and created the masterpieces with dignity.
“I must go!” said Harry.
“I am pleased to meet you now,” said Harry with a bow.
"Hi Harry, may I come in?"
Harry told his friends what had transpired. They were shocked, angry, happy, and confused. They were overjoyed that Voldemort was gone, but wanted to be there to help Harry in his quest. Harry tried to be as honest as he could. He told them he just wanted it over and done with. He even told them about his mate, whom they weren't happy about, but would try for Harry, to be nice to.
Later, I heard a quiet knock on my door, thinking it was my dad, I just said "Enter." To my surprise it was Draco.
He nodded again. "Alright, do you want to try to win him or not?"
She smiled. "Good question Harry. As a guardian angel, you will inherit certain powers that will allow you to transport to him, shield with your wings, and smite him for harming those you guard."
I feel lost. Floating adrift. You might be wondering why I am here strapped to a hospital bed, well it all started a few months ago after I defeated Voldy in the final battle. We had gathered the intel to finally defeat him. It was a long and drawn out battle. Both sides lost several people by the end. I was able to defeat him with Severus at my side. He had been training me for months to go up against the worst villain there ever was. We did it! We finally won. I took him down and then I was in for the shock of my life. My two best friends abandoned me. They told me that they had only been my friends for the fame and glory. They were also getting money to be my friends and keep me secluded. That was when I realized that Dumbledore was in on it the whole time. He manipulated me and used me. I had no proof though. What could I say against the "Greatest Wizard of all time"? He sent me back to my "loving relatives" care. I had no choice. I was basically forced to. I was going to try to sneak away, but I had someone following me all the time. I had no where to run. So, I was stuck being sent back to the Dursley's. Then it went from bad to worse. My uncle abused me in all senses of the word. He gave me a birthday present I will never be able to forget. He Had beat me and whipped me. I was badly bruised and bleeding from whip marks. Then he shoved his cock in me and raped me. Laughing saying that I will never be loved. He thought it would break me. I wouldn't let it. He carved the word Freak into my chest, cut my genitals, burnt all my stuff including my wand and broom, and then had me locked in a mental facility saying that I was mentally deranged. They believed him. So, that is how I ended up here. That was a month ago.
I sat there shocked. I didn't know what to say. That was a lot to take in. "I don't know what to say. Draco I thought you hated me. I tried to make you jealous by dating Blaise, but it didn't seem to be working. When you called me a slut, I was heartbroken."
Kingsley called for order of the court. "Any introductions?"
"Morning Draco, what's wrong?" Astoria asked.
It also didn't help that he had fallen for his Auror Partner, Draco Malfoy, who was supposed to marry Astoria Greengrass later this year. Harry knew that Draco was in an arranged marriage. That he had to provide an heir. He was also pretty sure Draco was straight. He couldn't help who he fell for though.
"What do you want?" I asked hotly. I really didn't want to deal with him. I just wanted to leave in peace.
"Why I am Sirius you fairy godparent, of course! I know your wish. I come to grant it."
I slumped in relief after the sentence was read out. Next they brought in Granger, the three Weasley's. They were charged with theft, line theft, creating an illegal marriage contract, lying and cheating on tests, and manipulation (using potions) against an Ancient and Noble Heir. They all got 60 years in Azkaban, their magic bound and would have to live in the Muggle world after their sentence. They had tried to use Dumbledore as an excuse, but Veritaserum showed they were in it for the money, fame, and power. I was saddened by how much they had manipulated me, but glad it was all finally over. I could finally be myself now. I could do whatever I wanted now.
"Who are you?" He asked.
Interviewer: "What other aspects are you going to change about the Wizarding World?"
"Hmmm?"
I am glad they never asked who it was that knocked me up. I didn't think that would go over to well. I was just glad for their support.
"Draco." Lucius hissed.
“Please, stop for a moment!” asked the Prince.
"Why here?"
He looked up again.  “Oh, my!” he cried out.  “It is almost midnight!”
I couldn't decide between Neville and Blaise... Or do you have a better choice?
"Hey guys."
"Not him!" Dudley cried.
"Well, with your armor of course. Every guardian gets special armor and a sword granted to you by the gods." She said producing said items for Harry to take.
"Harry James Potter!" She screeched.
"You're pregnant Mr. Potter. Congratulations," he repeated.
The Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Harry danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other bachelors at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is he dancing all the time with him?” they said. “How rude!”
"Are you dating anyone or looking to date someone?"
I wanted to, but I was still hurt. "Draco, I want to, but I don't know if I can trust you won't hurt me again."
"140 ayes, and 39 nays. Bill is approved." Harry smiled. The rest of the Wizengamot session went on without notice. He didn't want to put all his cards on the table at once. The most important one was done.
Dad tried to figure out what was really going on but I kept my mouth shut. He didn't need to know about my stupid little crush.
They nodded. "We'll try," Ron muttered.
He nodded his head. "I figured you had a crush on him. I thought you were a Gryffindor, what happened to that courage of yours? Where is the Harry I know who stands up for himself?"
I looked at him with interest, suspicion, and confusion. I was so out of it. And my throat was sore from not being used for the past month. So, I just nodded in agreement, not really sure what I was agreeing to.
"It's a long story, Sir." Harry said. Harry looked down to see Draco opening his eyes. "First, I am sorry Draco. I apologize for using that spell on you and causing you harm. I failed my duty. I am deeply ashamed for using a spell that I did not know the affects of. I hope to prove to you that I am worthy of acceptance of my apology."
Harry shrugged. "I am just not interested in dating. I don't mind being alone." He didn't add that it also helps that he is gay and in love with Draco.
He beamed at me and then kissed me softly while protecting Ren from being crushed between us. It was just as sweet as I remembered. "I love you," I whispered when we parted.
I think dad has figured something is rather amiss. He keeps giving me these looks. Knowing looks. Raising his eyebrow whenever Draco brings someone home like I should do something about it. Ha! As if. I don't know what he expects me to do.
"Oh is that what you were doing? I thought you just had your friend over for dinner." He jokingly teased her.
He silently handed her the Prophet. He was still processing it. She looked at the photo and then back at Draco. She read the article.
They made such a big deal that Harry was unable to attend the ball as he wished. He bid them farewell as the left the manor. He walked to the courtyard and sighed. "I wish I could go to the ball."
“Many things are possible,” said Harry, “if you wish them to be true.”
He just shook his head at her.
Draco was right once the lawyer completed the divorce proceedings, their parents were angry, but Draco calmed his parents with the prospect of an heir and told Astoria's parents that she could have back her dowry and would help Astoria find her love and help them produce an heir somehow.
Dumbledore stood up. "I believe I have held those seats, and that Mr. Potter is too young to hold them. And they should be assigned the the light faction."
"That is not funny Harry. I just don't understand why you don't date. Like at all."
When it came down to it, Harry did finally decide to come out to Wizarding World. First he had a chat with Kingsley, who not so slyly mentioned that Harry had titles he could take up and then bring forth change within the Wizengamot. Harry had no idea he had any titles. He was shocked that no one had told him before. Everyone just assumed he didn't care about them or had taken them and not gone public about it because he didn't care for politics or didn't know about their customs. Harry just shook his head and headed towards Gringotts.
Harry looked at the gilded sword, and a suit of armor that allowed for wings to spring out the back. "I agree."
"And I have found you!" Harry murmured smiling.
"I don't. I was just curious. What about your friends?"
So you see we might see more from this new Lord, and he will certainly shake things up in the Wizengamot and the Wizarding World itself. I for one am looking forward to see what other changes this new Lord will bring. I of course will bring it to you.
Sitting in St. Mungo's staring into space. Trying to figure out what had just happened. I was in shock and had no idea how to respond.
"Harry!" I heard Ron's voice hiss out.
"No it's alright." I said. "I am not just leaving. I am heading to my apprenticeship. I didn't think you would care."
"Me too, Harry. We'll help you in any way we can." Hermione vowed.
"I know that, but there isn't much we can do. The Ministry is corrupt and the Wizengamot is filled with purebloods who won't lift a finger to help the cause."
“Dong!” said the clock.
"What is that?" Harry asked.
I finally found out the reason he wanted me dead. With me gone, he had no one to rival his power within the Wizengamot. He could put forth his own ideals and no one would be able to challenge him because he controlled the most seats, which he had because he illegally used mine. Now that I was better mentally and physically, that would change.
Now all he to do was find Harry and convince him he was serious, because after reading the article he knew Harry was in love with him but didn't think Draco loved him back. That Harry didn't want anything from the father and was fine being a single dad. Draco didn't want that. He wanted Harry and their child. He just hoped Harry would listen and give him a chance.
Harry quickly looked at her. His face drained of color recognizing Hermione's knowing look. He quickly put up a silencing bubble around them.
"None."
"I was finally ready to be out. At first I was scared, not sure I would be able to do this. Then I got some information about the political aspects of the Wizarding World which didn't help me one bit. I was told to keep it quiet. But my nosy friend pushed me to be brave and I am really glad I did. I am proud to say I am gay. I am no longer afraid."
"This you can pay back in all the ways you want," Harry assured him, undoing the button and dragging down the zip. He palmed Draco's stiffened cock through the boxers he wore beneath - of course they'd be silk - and lifted his head to bite into the blonde's neck.
A few more tense moments passed as Draco contemplated a few things in his head, sipping his tea periodically. After a moment of consideration he set his cup down on the counter behind him before closing the space between him and Harry, placing a hand gently on the others waist, fingering the fabric that rested against skin below that he had no doubt was taut with muscles and was tan as if kissed by the sun. "No really, Harry," he whispered quietly, throat running dry as his heart clamored in his chest. "Thank you."
Harry's head tilted automatically, providing Draco with better access. His own orgasm was coming in leaps and bounds. His glasses were slipping, but he ignored them, rocking his hips forward into Draco's long-fingered hand.
The blonde placed the plate on the counter. "Hey, Scorpius," the little boy looked up from playing with Perry on the floor. "Go play in your room, will you please?"
"M-My wand?" Draco swallowed, hands suddenly clammy. He could handle Potter falling in to his life, dragging Gran-Weasley (that would take some getting used to, he told himself) in as well but asking about his wand was something personal. "I don't have it." His voice was calm, clipped, his expression instantly falling back into the Malfoy sneer he harboured years ago.
"I know, 'addy!" The little boy giggled, small fingers already reaching for an apple slice, taking it and biting in to it with an excited crunch.
He turned giving a small smile to Scorpius and holding his arms open, the child instantly running in to them with a small, gratified squeak, his little feet carrying him into his daddy's open arms. "D-Daddy! Are you okay? Did the bad man hurt you?"
There was nothing in this boy to suggest any sort of abuse, Harry decided. Absolutely nothing. He was happy, excitable, and clearly doted on. Harry's next smile was for Draco. "I never expected you to live in a mixed complex," he commented.
The blonde nodded, standing and quickly shuffling Scorpius off his leg who ran towards the bathroom with renewed abandon. "Thanks... Harry." Draco smiled slightly, patting him on the shoulder before walking down the hallway, stripping his shirt of in the process. Inwardly though, Draco gave a small start, a slight tingle working its way up his fingers and through his arm. What the...?
He tilted his head slightly, trailed the tip of his tongue teasingly over Draco's lips and shivered. "I did tell you to call me Harry, didn't I?"
"You know I get the distinct impression that Scorpius is a rather big fan of apples." Harry smiled at the boy, reaching over to ruffle his hair.
Draco thought it over for a moment before nodding his head, sipping at the water the waitress brought and continuing to gaze at his son fondly. "Sounds good, Potter. I'll leave my floo open." He snatched an apple slice off Scorpius' plate and took a bite, laughing warmly and reaching over to tickle his son as Scorpius shrieked with laughter. "D-D-Dadddy!"
Draco laughed warmly, shaking his head as Scorpius ran off, Draco keeping a warm, silver-hued eye on him. "At this point, I think you're going to break me, Potter."
Harry opened his mouth and closed it a few times before he shrugged. "I'm not being lied to."
Harry clasped the blonde's hand, rising. "I'll be glad to see him, too."
"A five year old boy who loves apples and has a stuffed unicorn named Perry."
"Draco..." Harry sighed, tucking his hands in his pockets. "I know this is probably a ridiculous question, so don't take it the wrong way. But do you want me to stay here tonight? I can take care of Scorpius in the morning for you. You can't tell me you're not exhausted."
"Bye, dadd- I mean Harry! Bye-bye!" Scorpius called from the entrance to his bedroom, waving Perry around frantically.
"Good morning, Po- Harry." He nodded once more before looking down at Scorpius and smiling, the little boy breathing heavier than he was when he walked in, his cheeks red with laughter.
Harry watched him go. "What about removing his magic?" he whispered. "Or repressing it like they did with Draco?"
Harry took a hold of Draco's hand, leading him out and down the hall. He couldn't imagine what it must be like, having magic only to have it yanked away and suppressed. He sank down onto the couch and retrieved the wand from his sleeve before cautiously offering it.
Sighing, Harry stepped forward and gathered him up. He couldn't very well leave him on the couch all night and have to tiptoe around him when morning came. He carefully lifted Draco, pausing when the man murmured something unintelligible and turned his face into Harry's shirt. The brunette smiled slightly, starting down the hall.
"Faster!" Vernon cried.
Kingsley looked at him strangely. "Mr. Dumbledore, Mr. Potter is of age, the magic accepted his claim and you do not have control as to where he assigns them."
That night at dinner we toasted to my apprenticeship and to my future. It looked like Draco was sour the whole time. I wasn't sure what that was about, but I didn't let it bother me. I just ignored him. I concentrated on celebrating. Lucius congratulated me as well, which pleasantly surprised me. Dad gave me a set of new robes to start out in my apprenticeship right. He also gave me his DADA book with all his notes in it. I thanked him profusely.
He was surprised. It took us directly to the master bedroom that I had decorated with rose petals, and fairy lights. I told him to get comfortable and changed into my "outfit" that I had picked out. I put on a green silk negligee tank top and lace panties to match. I also put on a snake garder on my right thigh.
All heads turned.  Who was that lovely bachelor stepping down the stairs?  He held his head tall and looked as if he belonged. But no one knew him.
Harry stared at her increduously. He couldn't believe his ears. "How will this help me defeat oldy voldy?"
"Yeah I can contact Headmistress Maxine and see if that is possible, I am sure it won't be a problem." Draco didn't know I wasn't going to be at Hogwarts. I would just quietly leave and never look back.
Harry thrashed in Snape's hold. Voldemort laughed. "Excellent. Now I can finish what I started all those years ago."
Harry looked sheepish.
"That is fair Harry. All I am asking is that you try. We can take it as slow as you want." He promised.
I scoffed and rolled my eyes. "Whatever." I muttered.
He nodded. "Yes, please."
I knew I would be hearing from Draco eventually. Since I released a statement with the photo of me and Ren, I had been anxiously awaiting to hear from him. I had been staying home with Ren until I could bare to leave him with Molly for the day, while I attended my shop. I had not heard from him yet and I was nervous. I knew he would see the picture and realize that we had a son together, would he care? Would he be mad? Would he want to be in his life? So many questions. I stayed away from the paper because I didn't want to read any articles attacking me.
I had a plan now. I received some good advice from my dad. I just had had to enact it.
"What's up Ron?" I asked kneeling down in front of the fireplace.
Draco smiled. "How do you feel about a double wedding right now?"
"Then, how about do something Slytherin-ish?" He suggested.
Lady Magic smiled at him. "I am glad you agree. My offer is for you to become a creature, one that is in your family bloodline that hasn't shown in sometime, and this creature inheritance will help you to do all of those things. This would change your nature. You would want to heal more than harm. You also would be able to bear children for your mate. I will also help you liberate Draco and Severus' arms of that awful tattoo."
Harry smirked. "You shall see. That is all for today." He then turned and left for home feeling ten times lighter.
I wonder why Dumbledore insisted I go back. I wonder why my friends abandoned me. What they meant about being paid to be my friends. I wonder if anyone will miss me when school starts back up. I wonder if I will ever be saved. I wonder what I did to piss fate off so much. I wonder if I really am crazy. I wonder if I can figure out a way out of here. I wonder how to fix the mess I am in. Right now I can't do anything. I just lay here and think. That's all I do now. I let my thoughts wander and I sleep.
