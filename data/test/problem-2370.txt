"You stupid boy, do you really think I'm going to sit idley by and watch my son be forced to marry the likes of you? No see now the law is binding but now if you were to die, my son would then be free to marry another match. My son will never produce children with the filthy mudblood lover that killed my master." Lucius growled.
Draco thought about it and says "I'll be Feathers."
Albus hands Harry his certification scroll taps a wand on both shoulders.
Inquire within if interested
Slowy Harry hatched a plan.
"Yeah..Your Aunt and I..we've been dating for about six months and I want to ask her to take the next final step with me..I'm wanting to propose to her tonight, I've already talked to your cousin..now i feel it's only right to talk to her nephew to." Severus admits.
"No strings attached Sex Buddies I can handle." He agreed.
Narcissa
“Draco what are you doing?”
Their relationship wasn't at the friends level after everything they'd done to each other over the years, but it was definitely on its way towards slowly getting to that direction.
"I'm game to try it." Neville responds quietly.
Lucius started to get the upper hand so we tried to help Draco by disarming his father, but the man managed to get his wand back and knock the 4 of us unconscious.
Harry steps forward.
The two of them continued to throw names around, agreeing to some and vetoing others until finally Harry had a list of four for both genders.
Harry and Draco decided to grant their wished and let them stay at school this year, and celebrated Christmas by having sex in front of the fire, and as they lay in bed Harry says
Draco stalks back inside a thought crossing his mind.
Everyone was asked to report sightings immediately.
Harry gapped at the letter before showing Draco.
"Kane, my name is Kane Evans."
Harry sits back down. He was so tempted to admit he had a crush on Draco but instead Harry hears a question falling from his mouth before he could stop them.
Draco then backs up leaving Harry to grab a flogger from the wall.
Draco looked at Snape gratefully but continued to worry, hating that the man he loved was in so much pain.
"Harry you have no family here that care much, mine are dicks...but we love each other. Run away with me. Lets leave England behind. I heard of a place where you who know who has no reach..and where together we can make a life for our child. Theres a wizarding school that we can transfer to in America." Draco tells Harry.
Hermione starts riding his cock hard the moment he's fully buried in her.
"Tell me Now!" Draco bellowed.
"Uncle?"
The two of them went out to a nice restaurant to celebrate the news, and told all their friends.
"Fuck Harry. Fuck that mouth of yours is talented. I want to kill every other boy you might have done this with." Draco growled possessively as Harry continued.
Harry’s kids all ended up being blondes accept Lily. Lily was the only one that ended up with brilliant red hair, and looked a lot like the photos he’d seen of his mom, while Narcy looked like Draco’s mom Narcissa, the two boys were spitting images of Draco.
He pay close attention as together all three try to follow the instructions.
“I bet Nathan will the smartiest wizard at school, just like you were the smartest witch.” Neville would beam.
Draco mulled them over “I like Natalia best.” he agreed
"Sit."
Draco found himself questioning their relationship as things continued on. Was Harry losing interest in him? Was Harry seeing another guy while he was at work? Was Harry cheating on him? Was Harry wanting out of the marriage?
Over the next few months Draco settled into a role of taking care of Harry, and the more he grew bigger, Draco started making sure Harry didn’t carry anything heavy, and took over putting together the  nursery room. Harry had picked out the cribs, but Draco was the one the painted the walls after having Harry choose from a set of swatches, and put the crib together.
Harry's face split into a look of pure joy, as he nods.
Draco sighed "how ever this occured i think its awesome, it's a product of our love for each other. I will be here for you both every step of the way. I will do my best to be a father to our child. And good boyfriend to you."
Harry winced a bit before kissing Draco deeply. Going still, taking the time to kiss and touch the rest of Draco's body.
Malfoy rolled his eyes but smirked. “So greedy. I give and I give and you keep wanting more.”
Gulping any trace of hesitation down, Harry started up the stairs to a black painted metal door. To its side was a camera and buzzer.
He didn't feel the weight of the world on his shoulders, just the gentle ache of his stiff muscles finally moving from being tied up.
“Malfoy?!”
He wasn’t sure how long passed, but his breathing was starting to regulate when Malfoy leaned down and kissed him tenderly.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, Harry just knew it even though he couldn’t see it happening. “I did, Potter. Don’t really think we can continue being enemies after I spent a part of the night with your cock in my arse, now can we?”
fucking?”
Malfoy fully sat down and placed his hands on Harry's chest, fingers splayed for balance. He was breathing heavy through his nose and Harry felt the desperate coil in his stomach to cum and the tingling need in his lips to kiss the man above him. He wasn't sure which feeling was more intense. He really wanted to do both right then.
“I have an appointment,” he replied, voice shaky.
How long had Draco actively and vocally hated Potter and then to suddenly say that he fancied him? It would have surprised him too if that tables had been turned. Should he really say he didn’t expect rejection? Still, it hurt.
“So enthusiastic,” Malfoy laughed again, setting the flogger down on the floor. “But I said maybe. Your mouth better be bloody fantastic if you want to even think about touching my arse, Harry.”
Harry didn’t respond, too busy panting and trying not to hump against the padded bench top.
Harry shuffled on his feet and blushed before repeating the password
“Thanks, Potter. Please don’t leave that in the
Harry nodded as best he could. “Yes. Yes, sir. I want to be a good boy for sir. Please.” He really didn’t know where any of these words were coming from, but it felt so perfect on his tongue. He never did this before, but it felt so natural with Malfoy.
“I’m sorry, sir.”
_____________________________________
“Keep your eyes on me, pet,” Malfoy hissed. “Look straight at me while you finish sucking me off.”
But he thinks the reason it felt so amazing was because he felt so damn safe.
“I’m uh….” Harry started but Hermione cut him off with a wave of her hand.
Suddenly, the string vanished right before Draco's eyes.
Harry yelped in surprise when a lubed finger circled his pucker then pushed in slow and steady. Malfoy made a noise of approval that shot straight to Harry’s cock. “So tight,” the blond muttered. The single finger slid in maddeningly slow. It drove Harry crazy, drawing whines and making his back arch. His russet brown skin prickled with goose flesh, the way Draco felt was easily leading Harry into a place he hadn’t ever felt.
He felt empty.
As he waited for an explanation he was sure he didn’t actually want to hear, Harry stood, keeping an eye on the other man.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to relax even though he knew their time in the room was almost up. “I’m tired of when people take from me without my consent- pictures, my personal life, my childhood. I want to be able to give myself willingly. Because giving myself willingly has been the only power I’ve possessed, whether in death or in life. It makes me feel powerful being able to dictate who has a say in my actions, as opposed to just going along with the plan.”
. He looked up to see Veronica behind the desk again. “How is it out there tonight? Still raining cats and dogs?”
“Potter,” Malfoy said as Harry reached the door. “Come see me again. I had fun.”
“Everything has been cleaned and sanitized, but there are cleaning supplies in the armoire if you want to make sure for yourself. We request that you wait for your Dominant by kneeling with your back to the door. It adds to the vibe, I think,” she chuckled. “You can stay clothed or get naked, whichever. The scene starts when he comes in and ends when he says so. He’ll be in shortly, love. Enjoy yourself.”
The bottom of the checklist’s second page had a privacy warning, a nondisclosure agreement, a safety for the workers clause, and a spot for Harry to sign and date, as well as the escort.
The string was gone and it was because Voldemort killed Potter.
“Confirmation password?”
He was spiraling, really.
“Circe, is that what love making is?” Draco asked through ragged breaths and Harry laughed, burying his head against Draco’s neck, kissing softly. “It felt amazing. Give me a few minutes and then do that again,” Draco demanded.
Body sluggish and mind blank, Harry dressed as Draco took the things they used and put it into a bucket and dropped them off in the on suite bathroom. When he was done, Draco was wiping down anything they had touched. It looked domestic in the most fucked up way.
Malfoy hummed in appreciation.
Malfoy was off of him before he could react to the kiss, leaving him with his faculties slowly coming back and the reminder that there was a world outside those 4 walls.
“Yeah,” he breathed.
The leather started again, easy against his bottom. The flogs started coming faster, giving it more intensity, which resulted in Harry making sounds he couldn’t even describe. Malfoy would alternate between soft brushes and snappier hits, all while the toy in Harry vibrated and brought the sub back to hard and leaking.
He felt so vulnerable, restrained and spread apart, a man’s finger in him, and a blindfold making his other senses heighten. All the same, though, Harry felt like he was the one in charge. He couldn’t freely move, but Malfoy was doing things to him- for him. This was all for Harry’s pleasure. For his release. For his much needed release.
But his heart skipped a beat when Harry chuckled and gave a big bright smile. The flame in Draco's chest warmed and washed over his entire body, pleasantly.
But the next morning they did have sex, very vanilla but very passionate sex. Draco held on to Harry, nails digging into his shoulders as he came, mouth open but not breathing until he slumped back against the bed.
Harry continued to buck up his hips, lost to his own movements, until, like it was barrelling out of him, he came so hard into the hole that clenched and pulsed around him.
Malfoy laughed. It was sharp like Harry remembered it, but it didn’t have the same mocking feel as it did when they were younger. He wasn’t laughing at Harry. He was just laughing.
"Are you in any pain?" Malfoy asked.
Malfoy gave him a funny look, a cross between amused and bemused. “Are you asking me out on a date, Potter?”
So loving.
"I don't know. I think you think you deserve it. But I don't think you deserve my cum yet," Malfoy said, panting and gripping Harry's hair harder. "Fucking beg me for it."
“The plug, sir?”
This was everything he had hoped for when he emailed Miss D’s a few days ago. This was all he had hoped for when he first knelt in the middle of the room. And it was Malfoy who was doing it for him. Bloody Draco Malfoy, the former Death Eater wearing heels and fucking himself on Harry’s hard cock.
“I could ask you the same thing!” Harry said, voice raising as he took his hands away from his still red face. “What the fuck are you doing working in a fucking muggle escort service?!”
The decor was not what he had expected. He thought it would be all red and black walls and curtains. Velvet and leather chairs and lace hanging from the ceilings or something. Merlin, he also thought there would be floggers on the walls like how hunters hung their guns up like prized possessions. Instead, the interior was far more simplistic and modern. Eggshell colored walls and polished wood floors.  The chairs were still leather, but beige with teal decorative pillows lining an equally beige leather couch. A coffee table with magazines sat in the center with the chairs. There was a reception desk in the center of the room, it was cluttered and busy looking but still had a clean look to his white surface.
“Oh you’re one to talk. You have a pretty big ego yourself, Potter. It’s probably why you came tonight. To get put in place and stop being so high up on yourself.”
Malfoy laced his fingers with the backs of Harry’s hands, leading them up his body. Harry palmed at the leather shirt, silently begging Malfoy to take it off. And as if Malfoy had read his mind, he placed Harry’s hands back on his thighs and slowed his bouncing to faint grinding as he reached behind him to pull down the zipper at the center of his back.
“Harry.”
Fuck. Hearing those words and his name come out of Malfoy’s mouth was making him rock hard.
He moaned again as Malfoy went back up to his shoulders. The swishing sound in the air mixing with Harry’s moaning and panting was so alien to Harry, but he felt at home. Safe and secure. He was willingly being used as target practice.
It wouldn’t be taken from him.
Harry's brows furrowed low and his lips tugged into a frown, but he looked down at Draco's hand and sighed. "Yeah. Well, it was payback for not outing me back at your house. Did you get your wand back by the way? I gave it over to-"
Harry moaned at the idea of one more wonderful round and bit Draco’s shoulder lightly. “You’ll be the death of me.”
He was desperate to touch Draco. He wanted so bad to feel the soft pale white skin and silky blond hair and bite reddened lips and -Merlin’s tits, he really really wanted to kiss Draco Malfoy.
“So good,” Harry groaned. “I feel so good.”
“Go ahead,” Malfoy said, pressing Harry face against his crotch. Harry immediately nuzzled the hard cock under the leather with his cheek. Malfoy hummed in pleasure, hands holding Harry’s head close. Then Malfoy stepped back saying, “That’s enough of that. Be a good boy and I’ll let you touch me again later.”
All of his tastes.
Harry stretched his fingers out of his right hand and summoned his wand with a wordless accio. It flew out of his pants pocket and zipped right into Harry's waiting hand.
Harry smiled and felt his body relax again. He didn’t understand it, really, but what he said was true. Malfoy’s demeanor had changed. He was still a git with a pointy face and a questionable past, but Harry felt like since they had last seen each other, that Draco had grown. That he had figured out how to be his own man, not his father’s pet or the Dark Lord’s puppet. He was the real Draco Malfoy, a man who had learned the hard way that his actions had consequences.
Malfoy started to rock his hips in small circles, mouth open to let out these deep groans that only made Harry respond with his own. Then the blond lifted himself up before sitting back down, repeating the move over and over again, bouncing on Harry’s lap. His own cock bobbed with the movements, hitting against Harry’s flat belly in the process.
Harry had to swallow back a groan before answering. “Green, sir. It felt good.”
“My, my, Harry. You’re leaving me a nice puddle of pre-cum on my floor. I should make you clean it up when I’m done with you. What a mess.”
Harry did as told, feeling the world melt away from his shoulders. It felt good to be ordered around when he wanted to.
Harry scrubbed his face up with his hands a few times, trying to digest this information. He felt almost bad for Malfoy. Harry felt like Malfoy might not have deserved the shit he got after the war, but then again he was a complete arsehole growing up.
The thought made him bite his lip. He could still feel the heat from Malfoy’s crotch when he had been allowed to press against those stupid, ridiculous, lovely, sexy leather shorts. Merlin, those shorts. He wanted to touch Malfoy so much.
“Oh.”
“What are you feeling, Harry?” Malfoy asked as he worked Harry over.
"So greedy," Malfoy whispered right back. "Well, I did make a promise earlier and I am in a giving mood. So I guess I could go out of my way and use the Boy Who Lived's cock."
Harry let himself relax and chuckle. “Sorry, I guess I was trying to compliment your morality because complimenting your good looks just didn’t fit the mood at the moment.”
“How was your first experience in a bdsm club?” Malfoy asked softly. “Any complaints?”
It had not been about evading faith back then, but that was exactly what they had attempted to do.
Draco would have liked more than anything to have rushed to Potter and hugged the life out of him like any other emotional Hufflepuff, but he was in no position to move. Voldemort had managed to find Draco first before Potter, and had been more than intent at keeping his promise of torture so great Draco would beg for mercy.
0~0~0~0~0
His humiliation seemed complete.
What would had been different?
Hogwarts had taken one year to become reopened to the public. New and present students had been fully encouraged to continue where they had left off, with the seventh year students who had been present and not present even given a chance to re-do the year.
Draco had watched all of this with flat eyes. Some part of himself had been fascinated as Potter expressions morphed along with his rant. He had only paid half an ear to what Potter had actually been saying, wondering when he would snap awake from such a strange dream.
It hadn’t been a dream.
0~0~0~0~0
Draco wondered why that had been the case.
“You.” Potter took in a deep breath, and huffed it out the next moment. His hands were surprisingly square in their shape as they clenched at his trousers before running through thick unruly hair.
Had he managed to grow up from that near death experience, even a little bit?
Draco had opened his mouth to demand to know what had happened, when Granger had honed in on Potter’s lack of progress and started berating him.
Draco knew the exact moment in time when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, became the object of his curiosity. His mother had been the one to bring up the topic of Potter when he was young. He had known nothing of the existence of the boy until that moment. Unlike other people’s common opinion (that his mother and father where abusive or that they neglected him) he was raised with very observant parents. Everything he did as a child was under their strict supervision, and they were always within shouting distance.
Draco had never been more grateful to his parents for burning the Malfoy mask into his very being. Otherwise, Draco would had not even been given the opportunity to fix his father mistakes, at the expense of his own mother. Instead he would have been killed off then and there, his terror and desire to be anywhere else but there, would have been written on his face as clear as day.
Draco had still been aware that he was far from home. That his mother's safety rested in the hands of a man whose alliance was entirely questionable. The fact that Severus had seen him grow up, taught him lessons before and during Hogwarts, mattered little.
The picture his father had painted of the dark side was so far from the actual reality it might as well have been in another galaxy. While Draco had very little choice in the matter to begin with, he had still been mostly agreeable to signing up for the pureblood cause. It was something that was expected of him. However, Draco had begun to feel doubtful during his years at Hogwarts. Things his father would have sworn by the book were fact had been torn apart right before his eyes.
"I don't want another mate, I want My Harry! He means everything to me father, and I will take him back even if that means I have to kill my own father." Draco responds.
"What kinda game?" A Hufflepuff pipped in?
Ron tries to think of some excuse to make her stay home, he was afraid of her getting hurt.
She was so fucking hot.
"First sustenance and then we can have fun."
Draco thinks about it.
Harry swallowed as best he could.
Harry then grinned.
"Fine, If you want it that way then I have no problem killing you both." Lucius responds.
"Try me." He pushed out still staring.
"So you did it didn't you? You jumped his bones back there huh?" Ron teased.
The two fall asleep spooning with Draco as the big spoon and Harry as the little spoon. Draco's arm laying over Harry holding him close.
"Not yet, do not come until I say you can." Hermione reminds him as they continue to thrust against each other.
"I wish to buy these puppies please." Harry tells the store owner.
"I know the way i treat you it probably seems like it don't it..but the truth...I'm just frustrated cause I can't tell you what I really wish I could."
After making them, and being bored having to stay in bed all the time he took to order magazines by owl post from the wizarding world’s baby store. From there he ordered four quidditch themed bedding sets for the cribs.  Ordered several cute newborn onesies and even cute little girlie outfits just in case.
"Yes Draco yours.." Harry pures.
Hermione felt a small smile as she continued to drink the juice. Neville was a lot smarter than most people gave him credit for, he knew so much about plants.
Harry and Draco go to Wizarding Hospital.
"On the contrary I think it'll be hot." He grinned.
He heard someone trying to respond, couldn't make out the voice to know who they were.
"Let's go, let's go find our Harry." Hermione grinned.
Draco watched the blurred figures exchange spells, still unable to give his body permission to pass out, every fiber in his being still set on protecting what was his.
"Where Is He!" Draco demanded.
Neville barks in response.
Harry hears a soft cry of pleasure escape his lips as sparks ignite inside him.
Ron cursed softly, as she moved her hips up to meet him. The two move in union fucking each other into oblivion. Their movements growing more frantic and faster as they get deep into the pleasures of sex.
“Yup, passed clean out.”
Harry nods "these smells are making me sick, so I'll go see if I can find him."
Harry had long since lost count of time, and had lost Count of how many times the whip had struck him.
Draco wrapped arms around him pulling him close.
The flask traveled fast around the corner, Harry never one to wanna be seen a coward quickly takes a swallow then passed it to the girl beside him.
Harry nods "it was magical, this is the best Christmas i ever had, between you and our soon to be baby, i dont see how we could top this."
For this he would need to aquire the hrlp of two people that hated him. But maybe if he was honest with them they'd agree to help him.
Draco nods “Anything you want, Harry.”
"Slow? Ok drama I'm willing to try to put in the effort to try and become comfortable with you." Harry agreed.
Draco looks into Harry's eyes.
Harry Curled up as the unshed tears unleashed and he cries into his pillow.he had loved Hogwarts, had loved his friends loved Albus but it had been an act. He was just a pawn playing a game  that was unaware the game was being played.
Hermione delivered a beautiful baby girl at 28 weeks pregnant. The baby was whisked away to an incubator and Hermione and Neville were both unable to hold her.
Curious he wanders over.
Harry enjoyed the sights but ihis heart was heavy, his heart weighed down but what he'd just given up.
Harry barely saw what was happening as he passed out.
'Great'
"If a Malfoy knows anything it's about alcohol and money."
Harry tears up and hugs them back.
The room was soon filled with cries and moans and screams again.
Tonight though Draco leaned over and gently captured Harry's lips with his own. Harry leaned into it kissing back.
The sounds Harry made telling Draco it wasn't yet to much.
"With all the powers vested in me I Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Declare Harry James Potter, A Graduate of The Hogwarts Castle."
"I went to see Promphey recently cause i thought i had a stomach bug..and well..
Draco was careful as he continues to hit Harry with the whip that it only grazed his butt, to make sure he didn't accidentally hurt the child Harry carried inside him. Their child.
He'd never try broken, never before had he been hit by such utter betrayal as he felt now.
Hermione read the document twice to be sure she understood it.
“Hi Harry!” Hermione squealed tackling him in a hug.
About fifteen minutes later Hermione comes out to the waiting area smiling and hugs Neville.
"I'm happy we're talking again..but im exhausted..i think we should talk more about this stuff in the morning."
Ron looked from Harry's exhausted stupid grin to Draco's smile then gives Harry a knowing look.
Harry felt his heart start pounding in his chest. Where was he? Where was Draco? Harry instantly starts to suspect Draco.
Draco pulled away from the sobbing man "fine, you're telling the truth."
He then uses his broom to fly away.
"I did i finally got it. Now im pretty sure you can do it too. Its not that hard. You have to focus you can't let anything distract you."
Harry wrote it down.
And made a perfect Thanksgiving spread for 2 on a near by table. Complete with butter beer and candlelight.
The Christmas holiday came, sadly all four of the kids had written to say that the four of them wanted to spend their Holidays with their new friends at school and didn’t wanna come home.
Draco pours some over Harry's nipples and licks over the nipples, biting at the clamps to tug on them. Listening to the muffled moans coming from Harry's throat.
"Draco,
The boy nods "sure."
Draco hated his father for it, and had made sure he went to azkaban. But Lucius had somehow managed to escape and disappear.
Checking out he heads back up to the castle, to start preparing Harry's Christmas present.
Going home he lays down and tries to sleep needing to rest his sore muscles, but the cold empty space beside him keeps him wide awake, missing the feel of having Harry there.
The minister turns and walks out leaving them there alone.
Hermione left to go cook dinner for Neville and now only Ron was left.
On the first night at Hogwarts, Draco had declared himself Potter’s enemy. The thought of making another attempt at gaining Potter’s friendship never once crossed his mind.
When Draco had caught Potter’s reflection in the corner of his eye in Myrtle's bathroom, the dried tears scrunching up the pallid skin on his shallow cheeks had burnt and tingled. Draco recalled that brief second of eye contact with grey eyes utterly wide and wild in their desperation before he rounded on Potter in absolute rage.
Draco had refocused his attention on Potter then.
While Potter had managed to capture his full attention for some hours that day, it would be five years before he actually got to meet the boy, and a little less than that before his father encouraged him to befriend him. Until that time, Potter was all but forgotten.
Release from this world where he had to be in charge and in control.
When the war was over finally, he found himself back at the manor with nothing to do. Draco decided he couldn't ignore the string any longer. He went searching in the massive library at the manor and even sent owls to book collectors his father knew. He searched and looked for any story about invisible red string.
“Fine, okay. Yeah,” Malfoy said nodding. “Tomorrow at noon?”
With a nod Malfoy slipped out of bed and went to the hook near the door for his silky robe. He looked back at Harry expectantly. “Well, get dressed then. You have to go.”
Malfoy covered their laying bodies with the fur lined blanket and wrapped himself around Harry’s back, spooning him close.
, a job he really liked and Harry thought he’d feel jealous but he never did, because Draco loved him and no one else. Work scenes were planned and discussed, they weren’t spontaneous fucks on Harry’s kitchen table before dinner or filled with passion and love like when they had a scene together in Draco’s personal playroom. What Harry and Draco had was different.
Malfoy must have planned it out that way because he stopped flogging him and ran the leather across his body again. The hand not holding the flogger petted the warm flesh of Harry’s arse cheeks. It was almost lovingly. Then the hand nudged at the plug still keeping Harry stretched open. That’s when the plug started to vibrate and Harry’s knees buckled slightly. He had forgotten that it was a vibrating plug through everything else with the flogger. His heart rate had already been fast but with the plug vibrating in him perfectly, Harry was sure the pounding in his chest was loud enough to be heard in other rooms. He might have been concerned over how fast his heart was going if he wasn’t feeling so euphoric.
Malfoy walked around and took Harry’s head in his hands, tilting it so Harry was looking up at Malfoy. What a perfect position, his face waist level to Malfoy, looking up in a way that made his shoulder ache as they stretched more.  Draco looked so beautiful from that angle. Eyes narrowed looking down his pointy nose at Harry, hair a white halo around his face.
“You’re a fucking arse, Harry Potter,” Malfoy said. “Who asks someone out
“And what color are you feeling right now?”
"I'm going to cum all over that stupid perfect face of yours. Do you think you deserve that, Harry? Do you think you've done a good job?"
He panicked and started to look at the floor around him wondering if it had fallen off somehow, but he didn't see it. His finger felt bare and cold. Draco felt his heart break for the little bit of mystical magic he knew nothing of.
“Saint Potter is judging me on my holiness?” Malfoy sneered but there was something light in his voice. Maybe it was the post-orgasm bliss or the hand still running up and down Harry’s side, but he was sure that Malfoy was being playful with their banter. “The saints would be so lucky. I am a bloody fantastic person.”
He stood behind Harry, where the brunet couldn’t see him and crouched down, bottle of lube on the floor next to him. He covered his fingers with the clear thick liquid first. “You know, Harry,” Malfoy spoke so low and deep it felt like his voice was rubbing across Harry’s entire body. “I absolutely love opening up a guy with my fingers. I like watching them squirm and beg. That’s the worst part about fucking a wizard. They never take the time. It’s always the stretching spell and then the lube spell and then he’s pushing it in. I like working them up until they can’t take it any more. It’s the sexiest thing I can imagine.”
Harry could only try and try he would. That was his purpose, please the man above him.
“No, sir.”
On his first day at Hogwarts, he looked down to notice he had a thin string looped and tied around his right hand pinky. It was bright red against his pale skin. Leftover thread that wasn’t looped around his finger dangled off to the side.
Harry ran a hand through his wet hair, his glasses rain splattered. “It lightened up a bit.”
“You should have known that before you stopped me from walking away.”
, Potter."
He loved Harry Potter.
Harry groaned. He started to squirm, needing to be touched again. “Green. Please, sir. Green.”
“No,” Draco said, voice low, heart racing. “I wish, but no.”
“Wizard.”
Harry shook his head against the overstuffed pillow. “None. You were perfect. I didn’t think…” but he trailed off unsure of how to word it.
Harry craned his neck and took all of Malfoy in his mouth slowly, swallowing around him and pressing his tongue up as he sucked with as much force as he could manage.
No more being the savior of the Wizarding World. No more worrying about living up to expectations. No more hiding from paparazzi. No more concerned looks from Hermione during dinner with her and Ron every Saturday. No more coworkers looking at him for advice. No more talk of promotions and becoming the head of the DMLE. No more holiday balls and Ministry parties. No more memories of the past, of the war, to haunt him. No more reminders that he’s hiding who he is to the rest of the world, because he can’t stop seeing the look of hurt in Ginny’s eyes when he came out to her. No more awkward hellos with Ginny since they’d broken up. No more worries about the
Malfoy arched a blond brow at him. “Oh? Naughty boy,” He said with a bold smirk. “What kind of toys?”
Draco quickly turned and walked away again, his face warm.
He sat down and skimmed through a pamphlet on consent that he’s read about a million times in the last year.
Draco took the cuffs on a strong chain from the side of the bench Harry stood and pulled it across the underside to cuff the black haired man tautly across the width of the leather bench. He felt exposed like this, back open for anything, face hanging over the side, legs spread apart for balance, and arse in the air.
Of course, Potter didn’t say anything.
“I kind of want to see you outside of this room,” Harry explained, voice quiet.
Malfoy's hold on Harry's head tightened, making him focus on the man in front of him. "But let's get one thing straight, Harry. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me. Because I want to fuck myself on that big cock of yours. It's not for your pleasure. It's for mine."
“Maybe.”
Harry wanted to reach out and touch Malfoy but he couldn't. Instead, he just bit his lip as Malfoy climbed up on the bench and straddled Harry's legs. Malfoy's skin was so soft and smooth on his. His lean thighs framed Harry's hips and his half-hard cock leaned into Harry's fully hard and straining purple erection. Seeing the size difference like that made both men moan. Malfoy wasn't small by any means, it was average and beautiful, but Harry was longer and thicker. He'd never had complaints about his size. But until tonight he'd never heard someone compliment it so much either.
Malfoy had watched him intently the entire time, eyes raking over his body. It made Harry’s breath come out faster. Just knowing that the man staring at him was going to do whatever he wanted (within limits) with Harry was making his balls ache to cum.
“Use my safeword,” Harry swallowed thickly. He had never used any sort of weapon before. He always wanted to try, but knowing it was actually happening made him nervous. He voiced his concerns to Malfoy. “Sir, will it hurt?”
Some time later, when he sat in the castle awaiting news of Potter's death, sure that Potter would walk to the forbidden forest ready to die to save those fighting for him, Draco stared at the string. Red and bright tied around his finger in several loops, leaving the rest to hang limp. It was comforting to have now, especially with how bloody scared he was, feeling dreaded anticipation gnaw at his stomach. His whole body ached. His lungs burned from the smoke he inhaled from the Fiendfyre Potter had saved him from. His eyes hurt from crying over his fallen friend. But mostly it was his stomach tied in big heavy knots.
and their long winded and annoying articles of Harry being
Draco had always been able to see it.
He had been taken advantage of so often.
Malfoy sat up and stretched his lean and long body. “Are you okay to leave? I want to make sure you’re not extremely emotional before I let you go.”
“But first…” Malfoy was smirking, Harry could hear it in his voice. It made Harry’s cock twitch. He wanted to be touched. He wanted to be taken advantage of in all the right ways. Harry got his wish as Malfoy’s hands grabbed hold of his bottom and massaged the firm muscle. “I think I want to play with this sexy ass of yours. Maybe open you up and tease you with a small little plug. Or maybe I’ll immediately make you take a thick toy. I did alway like seeing you whine.”
“Don’t explain anything. I really don't want to hear about your sex life. As long as it’s consensual and safe then it’s none of my business.”
Harry wanted to cry. "Thank you, sir. Thank you. Please use my cock."
“Didn’t think what?” Gently, Malfoy petted Harry’s side as they talked. “That I could be professional and not bring up our school boy drama against you?”
An older woman with dark skin and long braided hair sat behind the desk, her pointed painted nails clicked on the keys of her computer. He approached the desk cautiously, but was met with a bright, kind smile that eased his nerves a bit.
“Yes, sir,” Harry croaked out.
Harry was going to walk into a bdsm escort lounge in Muggle London.
And despite being the one who had no control over the process of the night, Harry felt like he was the most powerful person in the world. Because he made his sir feel good.
“D-dildo”
“Harry,” Malfoy called, jerking himself off at the same time. “You’re such a good boy. You did everything I asked of you so well. But I need you to do one more thing for me.”
Harry needed a release. For so long now he had felt like the world was on his shoulders. And he wanted to let it go. He wanted to be able to put all of his worries to the side. At least for one night. To have one night where he could think no more.
Harry moaned feeling the hard cock under those tight little shorts that would haunt Harry’s dreams for weeks to come. He nuzzled his face for a second, but Malfoy patted his face with a bit of bite, stinging Harry’s cheek and sending sparks down his spine. “Ah ah ah, Harry. Who said you could do that?”
"How about a game of Spin The Wand?" The Slytherin responded.
He prayed to Merlin, that someone would somehow find and rescue him.
Kingsley hurries to push the wizarding world into a full search party, he asks every witch or wizard available to help search everywhere for their missing Boy Savior.
The two of them were led outside just like the others before them.
Draco fixed tuna sandwiches, took showers and headed to bed. Normally the two of them would have ended the night with a tussle, but Draco was worried he’d stress the babies, since there was more then one.
The room filled with sighs, moams and then Harry was screaming Draco's name as they both come hard.
After days of attempting the spell Hermione succeeded in doing it first. Draco had to struggle not to laugh. But standing where Hermione had just been standing was now a fluffy brown Squirrel.
Hermione showed surprise. That actually didn't sound bad at all. A herbalist sounded like it would be up his alley, and would pay decently.
He heard her gasp in pain as he broke through her hymn. He stills, to let her adjust to his girth. kissing her gently.
Neville felt himself start to fall more in love with her with each item she bought for him to make him into her pet.
Ron starts laughing at that.
"Harry, Minister Shacklebolt only said we had to marry and produce children, he never said We had to pop a child out tonight. I want to take our time getting to know each other, as a  married couple before I get into bed with you.
Harry felt horror fill him as his eyes slides over to look over at the only boy left in the graduating table. The boy that had been his enemy for the past six years.
Hermione fell upon Harry, hugging him tight. Harry gave a cry as she put pressure on his aching body.
Hermione leads Harry and Draco to the kitchen.
To get away from Albus reach he'd need to leave The Country go as far as he could go outside the wizards reach.
"It's been a long emotional, unexpected night,how about we retire for the night? I'll be in the room across the hall if you need anything." Draco tells him.
Draco shakes his head
"It is,  i think to find out where Harry went we need to find out why he left in the first place. Granger i want you to help me learn to become an Animingus." Draco tells her.
"What is it Harry?"
As they lay Harry felt Draco watching him as he runs hands through Harry's hair.
Hermione felt the shock fade away after she finished the juice. It wouldn't hurt to give Neville a chance. Not that she had much of a choice anyway.
"Well after Draco noticed you were missing, he came and got us asking us for our help. And we searched for you for days, Draco interrogated every death eater he knew looking for you. When he found out his father had you. He turned a shade of white that I've never seen any person wear before.
He wanders into the nursery, and feeds, burps, and changes each of them before putting them back down to sleep.
The moment Draco would come home at night he would sit down for dinner, grab a fire whiskey and go right to bed, without even so much as lifting a hand to help Harry with the babies.
Finally one night when Draco comes home and finished dinner.
Dudley smiles “Well after I married Stella, it turns out she was what y'all call a squib, and our boys here, apparently inherited her parents ability for magic.”
Harry wakes up and finds himself back in his old room at Pivate drive, his uncle was in his room leering at him.
"fine ten seconds and that's all you get."
Harry stammered..
Pointing to the blanket Draco demands
"Harry, i need relationship advice, there's this girl i have a crush on, and tonight at midnight i plan to ask her out. But well I'm not sure how."
Although it felt real, Harry quite belive what he heart as his heart broke within hus chest.
He heard Draco hiss above him.
Harry throws on invisibility cloak.
Draco glanced towards the badly bleeding Harry, scared he might already be too late. Worried the boy he loved might already be dead.
The happiness they had now would never have happened. Draco shivered and held his husband close to him, content to have this wonderful wizard go from being the young boy he was trained to hate, to being the man he would love and protect with his last breath.
The nurse soon ushers Draco and the others back out of the room so Harry could rest and the babies could be taken to their nurseries for further observations, the nurse told Draco that he could take the five of them home in a couple of days. Five meaning both babies and Harry.
Harry felt nerves build up in his chest as each person took their turn, and went to the closet. A lot of people giggled as sounds came from behind the door indicating the couples were actually doing it.
"Why? Because magic is traceable, Potter, it can be traced back to the original caster..I'm too smart to get sent back to Azkaban for you." He responded with a smirk.
"So fucking Hot Potter." Draco purred.
Draco looks into his daughter's eyes, and could clearly see why Harry chose Narcissa for this one. She had his mother’s eyes.
Draco stared at them in surprise that they would try to help him. But the look he exchanged with Harry's friends was short lived, as Lucius managed to grab his wand back, and used it to send all four flying backwards into a wall, knocking them unconscious.
"The reason Neville I've been nervous to try anything with you is I am into some kinky stuff that you might not be able to handle." Hermione explains.
It was to hot to sit outside, the common rooms to boring..so several students from.different houses hung out in a never used classroom board games out to play together, each house in its own clique.
“lets go to bed Harry.”
Harry glanced over at Snape, question on his face. Severus glanced his way and, Snape picked up a potion book then held up fingers to signal a page number.
The duo nods "and even if you decide to marry him..we will support you every step of the way. And if he hurts you we'll both kick his ass."
“Well, seems we have the house to ourselves again, until they come home for the holidays.”
Harry paused trying to decide if he should quietly go back the other way or hide.
Draco falls to the ground withering in pain, his eyes go back to Harry, and he manages to find the strength to fight the curse, to point his at his father.
Harry climbed into Draco's bed snuggling up to him.
In another section was Christmas clothes.
“Good, cause I couldn’t handle it if you know..” Draco trailed off unable to even put words to such a thought.
"Then what are you waiting for? Why haven't you killed me yet?" Harry demands to know.
Harry says softly.
Harry smirked.
Draco had to agree though, he was a chubby little boy with plump cheeks and little tufts of that Weasley red hair.
Afterwards she tells him.
He hears a slight muffled sound coming from the gag. Draco watches Harry for signs it might be to much for him.
He knew Ron had caught on but didn't want to be obvious around everyone else.
All to soon though it was Harry's turn.
Hermione disappeared into the girl's dorm. And Ron and Harry retire to their own beds.
Draco stops laughing instantly..
“Draco he’s tough, he’s going to be just fine, if he can survive your father he can get through this.” Severus tries to reassure him.
Harry was almost screaming into Draco's shoulder as they continued to move until they both stiffen up.
“I sure do, I’m what they call a domma. Also known as a female Dom.” Hermione blushed.
She sits on the couch to read, and Neville curls up at her feet in the dog bed and falls into a nap.
"Now Draco is this anyway to talk to father? when I've got your best interest at heart. When I'm done here, you can get a new mate to marry."
Signed
He returned outside where the others were searching the grounds.
Draco shivered at the reminder.
Draco pounds Harry..stroking Harrys cock.
He hugs Harry and hurries through the portrait to go find Pansy.
But instead they wander over to Harry and throw arms around him crying.
"That's funny cause to be honest with you, I've a crush on you as well..in fact sometimes..I've had uh..dreams about us.."
“Hey Hermione, how are you two getting on?” Harry asked.
Inside there was enough room for 2000 passengers, each room was build with huge Master bedrooms with hot tubs in every room.
Both of them were giddy with excitement as they shed their clothes.
Draco starts laughing.
He was still in shock that Draco had chosen him over his father. Had risked death to protect him.
Neville noticed her presence and looked up from the gillyweed he was feeding, and his eyes nearly popped out of his head.
"Wait..Potter..what are you doing up here?"
He couldn't believe Draco had created such an elaborate scheme just to bed him..
"I better go or Luna might make me sleep on the couch." Ron jokes as he disappears.
Draco growls with a deep throated sound.
Draco puts Sirius down and takes Narssy into his arms to feed her. Working together they had them fed, burped, changed and put to bed in no time.
“You took that very well.” Malfoy continued the pace of stronger hits for another minute before saying, “You were made to be my sweet enthusiastic sub, weren’t you?”
“Wait. Who said you were my
reviews, if you’re so kind.” Draco Malfoy sighed and raked a hand through his shoulder length white blond hair and looked up the whitewash ceiling as if asking the heavens for something, anything, that could save them from this very weird situation. “I would ask if you were stalking me again, but by the surprise all over your face, I assume this was quite possibly the worst coincidence to ever come your way. What are you doing here, Potter?”
But until then -Gods save his soul- Harry belonged to his Sir.
At least for tonight.
"I did get my wand. Yes," Draco smiled and pulled their hands apart to show the wand in his pocket. "Thank you for that as well. It's a bit weird but exciting to think my wand is the one to kill him. Makes me a little proud even though I didn't do anything helpful," he rambled. He was so nervous it must have been obvious to anyone watching.
“Sir,” Harry called, voice broken from how much he’d been moaning and groaning during the scene. “Sir, please.”
The blond returned a damp cloth and a bottle of water.
A mistake.
It made him nervous in the best ways.
Harry eyed the green leather falls of the flogger and then looked back up at Malfoy’s calm face. “Okay.”
“That you were,” Draco assured. The hand around the base of his cock went to Harry’s face and caressed it almost lovingly. Harry couldn’t help leaning into it. Malfoy’s thumb slipped into the brunet’s mouth and the restrained man immediately sucked on it. “Harry Potter, my pretty little sub. My dirty boy. Only I’ve seen you like this. All mine.”
Harry swallowed, trying to wet his throat a little. “Green means go. Yellow means slow down or this is okay, but no more. Red means stop.”
But this time, he would only be used of his own accord.
He took a deep breath and walked in.
“That took a lot of strength, you know,” Harry said. Merlin, why was he even saying this? He was paying for the 2 hours and so far he was spending it having this awkward and sexually charged conversation with Draco Malfoy wearing a silk robe covering up his pert arse in high cut leather hotpants. “You’re still a piece of shit, bit I give you credit for not doing something that would destroy you.”
“Harry,” Malfoy said, low. It made Harry shiver. He had never heard Malfoy call him just his first name, especially not like this. “What is your safe word?”
“Not yet, Harry. I think I should get something out of your reward, shouldn’t I? And you cumming won’t do anything for me.”
“Sounds perfect,” he beamed.
There was a minute of silence where all they could hear were muggle cars outside and a client somewhere in the building begging his mistress for more. It was oddly calming.
Reading the passages didn't calm the fire in his chest, but it stiffly punched Draco with reality.
“Cum, Harry.”
“But you’ll tell me, right?” Ron asked him in a mock whisper, earning himself an eye roll from his wife.
He was gonna finally do it.
Draco’s smile softened but remained while he looked at the string that continued to connect both men. It was longer allowing them to move around and it only seemed to grow longer and longer the farther apart they were. But it was shorter the closer they got. It followed them around and Draco assumed it would continue to do so the rest of their lives if the legends rang true.
“Good boys aren’t so sarcastic and snarky,” Malfoy scoffed, but his mouth was playful again. He cleared his throat after a second, though, and shook his head. “Look, this is my job now and you paid for a session so I can find you another dominant to give you the full 2 hours’ worth. It doesn’t have to be me.”
“No one, that’s the beauty of it. No one would ever believe that you went to a kink club to get ordered around by your former enemy.”
Malfoy grabbed a few things and brought them back with him.
With that she closed the door behind her and Harry was left alone with his anticipation.
Harry was making his sir feel good.
Then when Potter was close enough, he turned the corner quickly and practically slammed into his (former?) rival.
“Yes, sir.”
Harry suddenly felt hot looking back at Draco. How had he never realized how long the blond’s legs were until seeing them in those black pumps.
“Y-yes, sir,” Harry said, shaky and weak. “I promise I won’t sir.”
Malfoy tsked at him. “Patience. Good boy’s are patient.” He put the things down on the bench beside Harry’s prone body before tying the blindfold securely around Potter’s head. Then walked back to the armoire for a bottle of lube. “I’m going to open you up first.”
Just a man willingly giving a part of his control to another man who had once lost all of his.
Harry laughed.
“What would you like me to do to you tonight, Harry?”
The dark skinned woman behind the desk sighed miserably. She always complained about rain. She handed him a tissue to clean his glasses then pointed him to sit down. “Draco’s last client just left. He’s probably just cleaning up and taking his ridiculously long shower. You know how meticulous he is.”
Hermione just studied him for a few moments then said “Not a boyfriend. But Harry is having sex. ...Among other things.”
“Fuck,” Malfoy groaned, his free hand moving from Harry’s jaw up into Harry’s wild black hair, gripping tightly. As a result, Harry moaned around the cock in his mouth only to make Malfoy hum deep in his chest.
He was Sir.
“I need you to use your words. I need verbal consent at all times,” the man said, the posh voice taking on a stern edge. Harry liked it so much it made him dizzy. There was something familiar itching at the back of his mind, though. He wanted to turn around and look at the other man. But he had a feeling he should wait for further instructions.
The playful smirk faltered and the grey smoke colored eyes glanced away. “You’re right.”
“We could try.”
Despite the floaty feeling zinging in his blood stream like powerful magic, Harry chuckled. But the chuckled died into a choked moan when Malfoy ground his hips forward into Harry's hips. "W-what do you need me to do, sir?" he asked, fixing his grip on his wand at his side.
“Yeah,” Harry smiled. “Okay.”
“Lift up your legs, Potter,” he ordered.
An escort service.
“I have a nice vibrating plug, a blindfold, and a flogger. Color?”
“Will I be able to touch you, Sir?”
A laugh behind sounded a bit mocking and that was a much more familiar sound to Harry. It made his skin bristle and the fight trait in his DNA come up from behind the submission. He really hated feeling embarrassed when doing anything sexual. He hated feeling shame. And the way Draco laughed reminded him so much of all the times when Malfoy would try to embarrass him or his friends back at Hogwarts. But at the same time, something relaxed in Harry told him to listen.  A voice in his head told him that it wasn’t the same kind of laugh. That all night Malfoy had been complimenting him, not insulting him. His body tensed either way.
He nodded again and took the result summary from the back pocket of his worn out jeans, still a bit loose on him even though he’d bulked up a bit since he was a teenager.
“Now, now, Harry. Don’t worry. I would never pop your anal cherry unless you want me too. I think I’m going to play with your hole, though. I just can’t decide between a dildo or a vibrating plug. What do you think, Harry? What should I be so kind as to shove up your hungry little hole? What should I pick?”
He thought for a moment. Much of what he knew about BDSM was from forums and books he had found online after he and Ginny broke up last year. He had never done this before, despite the fact that he craved it so much. What even constituted a safeword? He didn’t want to sound like an idiot. He also didn’t want to ask the receptionist. He was willing to suffer some shot to his pride while in the room with the escort, but not a shot to his pride while in the waiting room.
Turning around in Malfoy’s arms, Harry came face to face with the blond. They were very close. Close enough to feel Malfoy’s breath on his cheek. They looked at each other for a moment, silent besides the whitenoise around them. Harry hadn’t been this comfortable in someone’s arms since he, Hermione, and Ron slept huddled together in a pile on his bed in the Gryffindor rooms, still dirty and drained from the war. It was the safety. Draco Malfoy was a brilliant dominant to be able to make Harry Potter feel safe when all Harry ever felt was on edge.
From the corner of his eyes he saw Malfoy move around and turned his head to watch. Those tight leather shorts were stripped off, making Malfoy shimmy his thin hips. He bent down to remove the article of clothing from around his ankles. Malfoy was starting to get hard again, just a part of the way, recovering after his earlier orgasm. (Hard again for Harry. Harry made him hard again. Merlin.) The high heels stayed on though, to Harry's delight, as did the long sleeved leather shirt, to Harry's dismay. He wanted to see all of Malfoy. Maybe if he begged enough.
That night they didn’t have sex, they just held each other as they slept in Harry’s bed.
“Wizard.”
Because he needed release. He needed to be used.
“I’m being serious. I’m okay with this being you,” Harry replied. He chewed on his bottom lip, his eyes lowering to the floor. “I don’t know why, but I trust you. You don’t feel like the same Malfoy from when we were kids. And like you said. This is your job. That’s all this is. I’m paying you for a service.”
Harry watched as Malfoy’s nimble fingers pulled the short zipper of his shorts down and shifted the leather lower. A pale hard cock with a pink tip popped out and if Harry hadn’t been tied up still he would have had his lips all over it already.
His heart broke more when Draco realized it had to be about Potter. It had to mean he was gone.
“So handsome,” Malfoy mused, aloud. “I wanted to mark you all up.”
The possessiveness in those words made Harry dizzy and he started to close his eyes.
Fuck. Never in his life had he expected to find Malfoy of all people to be so beautiful.
That’s probably why he called that number he found online. Muggle internet really was helpful when one wanted to find something away from the prying eyes of wizards and witches.
Malfoy’s face colored, bringing life to the pale white skin. “Circe’s sake, Potter, I thought you came here to give up control and fuck, not compliment my morality and descion making skills from over ten years ago.”
“First time in this sort of place?” She asked.
Harry was honestly surprised he was there looking at the door on the side of the sex shop building. A sign said “Miss D’s” with an arrow pointing to a staircase that went up to the second and third floors of the college town brick building.
admit to himself what it all meant. He read the book. He found more books about it and read those too. But he couldn't let himself feel what he had blocked off for years.
“Yes, well,” the blond sighed. There was a second where Harry thought Malfoy wasn’t going to finish the sentence. “I’m not into humiliation these days. I think getting insulted and harassed after the war changed my stance on things. At least during sex.”
Harry rolled his eyes, finally letting go of Draco’s hand. Draco pretended not to feel sad at the loss of contact just like how he pretended not to notice Weasley still confused and shocked as Granger patted his shoulder in amused pity.
Malfoy gave a faux pitying noise. “That’s okay. You’re doing so well, I think I’ll let you do it again. But make sure you ask before touching me like that. I’m not here to please you Harry, quite the opposite. You’re here to please me, isn’t that right?”
Harry sat done reading the traffic light consent system as the receptionist walked down the corridor behind her. When she came back she waved at him to follow.
The door to the shop was inviting and maybe if Harry had the time he’d take a look inside some other day.
His mother even went out of her way to find an old Daily Prophet that was dated the next day after the event had happened to prove that the story was in fact, true.
His parents had wanted the best for him, and gave it to him in the only way they knew how. As a toddler, and eventually a child, Draco was given toys most children could only dream about. Along with those toys came lessons with the best tutors money could buy. He had the basic lessons that all magically gifted children under the age of eleven had, along with many other advanced lessons that most children his age did not get. While other children were outside playing, doing chores, or socializing with other children, Draco was getting stuffed with lesson after lesson.
By the end of 5th year, Draco had been struggling with keeping ahold of his father views entirely. When his father fell out of favour with the Dark Lord during his 5th year summer, Draco’s world had shattered around him. His father, the backbone of their family, was ripped away from him and his mother. Now Draco suddenly found himself pushed into a spotlight he had been very much unprepared for. His heir status was removed in favour of him becoming the family head in his father’s absence. Before he had what felt like a second to get used to the heavy burden on his shoulders, he was suddenly summoned by the Dark Lord through his mother.
Draco managed to fix the cabinet.
He had thought everything would somehow work itself out in the end, and had even been determined to prove himself to Potter, to convince the both of them that Potter had made the right decision.
The very next morning, plans began to form inside his head, and operation ‘humiliate Potter at every turn’ was put into motion.
“Do you regret it?”
Draco turns away first, but a smile pulls at the corner of his lips. "I do not see why not.”
However, raised to be polite to those who were willing to be nice enough back, Draco thanked them. He kept his thoughts on their house, inside and out, to himself. With Weasel and Weaselette just waiting for an opportunity to hex him, he decided not to give them a reason to. Not to mention it was somewhat amusing to see their reaction to him complimenting their home, thanking Mrs. Weasley for her delicious home cooked meals, and even offering to help clean up afterwards.
But Potter had not been crying, and his eyes locked onto Draco with such complete and utter determination Draco had instinctively taken a step back.
"Potter and Boot are getting married in two months." Draco watches as Boot and Potter beam at each other on the front cover of the Daily Prophet. The couple have been Veela and mate for five years now, but have not officially tied the knot until now.
With his arms full of books, Draco had shoved out of his seat, completely prepared to walk away from Potter and his annoying friends for good this time. He had helped them out with the war cause as much as he was able, and he had every intention of continuing to do so, but he felt little need to be in close proximity with them any longer. He turned away from Potter, shoving the chair in with his hip, wincing when it screeched back into its place.
0~0~0~0~0
Draco would not fail the mission. He had every intention of fixing the vanishing cabinet to the best of his abilities, and somehow, some way, defeat his powerful headmaster.
Regardless, very few things changed.
Draco had to wonder why he had bothered to hear Potter out. If only he had kept walking away in that moment.
Draco had never before been under such pressure in his life. His mother's and father's lives depended on him, and he wanted so badly to succeed it almost hurt.
It had been just the two of them, the first to arrive back at their own dorm after spending most of the winter break together. They had just finished unpacking their things, and settling themselves in when Potter had blurted out the words.
What would had changed?
Had the idiot not realised how out of character it had been for him to make himself that vulnerable to someone!?
It seemed better and easier (safer), to just keep things as they were. Even if it meant being reduced to a seahorse, being moved where the ocean saw fit to place him.
He had known he would be the one to come out hurt, but hope had risen and swept him away for the ride. Draco had truly thought they would somehow pull through in the end.
And Draco Malfoy was not it.
Still, even to this moment, Draco couldn’t say that he regretted insulting Weasley. It did not take a genius to realise his family had been thrown shade, and he had retaliated accordingly.
When the story came to its climax and finally ended, Draco had known the most comical expression was on his face. With his mouth wide open, eyes near ready to pop right out of his skull, and nostrils flaring.
Gaining Potter’s attention had meant that much to Draco. The fact that he was the only one who could rile the boy up almost on command was enough for him. He did his best not to think how that blazing emerald gaze always, without fail, set a fire under his heart, making it come alive like no one else had before. Draco did not think about how his first wet dream had been one of their typical fights turning warm and soft.
Granger, along with Potter and Weasley (after some insistent prodding from her) had all decided to attend and be a part of the special 8th year class.
Potter had even brought up the subject when it had been just the two of them. Draco had not minded talking about it, but looking back on things now, the subject of returning to Hogwarts had appeared more often than he had realized.
It mattered little that he was not all for the Dark cause. That the thought of Muggle, Muggleborn, or Half-bloods being below him in any way shape or form had not formed sincerely since 4th year. His world had narrowed down infinitely to his parents and himself. Nothing else mattered to him.
Potter soon began to stir in his cramped position in the hospital seat, and Draco had wondered why he was even waiting patiently for Potter to wake up.
He had turned his attention back to the old books spread out in front of him, and it had took merely minutes for him to get completely lost in their concepts. While the current book had managed to hold his interest, it had seemed to be yet another book that had been essentially useless when it came to destroying Horcruxes. Draco made sure to write down the name to study it more deeply at a much later time. He grabbed another hopeful book, and began skimming the pages, easily taking in the dry language.
The same day, Draco had come to a decision. He had left Hogwarts, and eventually Britain all together. Some part of him had sunk to the very depths of his soul, curled up, and died that day. Another part had been born from its ashes, and soared in its place.
Draco could admit, at least on the inside, that he had been very touched by Potter’s speech. He didn’t think it had even been possible for his heart to beat so hard in his rib cage. For a moment, he thought he was having a heart attack. But no. Potter had just been throwing another chain across his heart, this time much thicker than the rest, binding Draco even tighter to him.
Draco regretted his decision as much as he did not.
Potter had been staring at him again, with his thoughts clearly flashing in his green eyes, but words refused to leave his full pink mouth. Draco had been determined to be the one who wouldn’t crack first, not when he had all but ripped his own heart out and given it to Potter like an offering last time. No. Draco could not afford to make himself that vulnerable again.
“I am sorry.”
Draco had simply put his wand away and returned his attention to the book in front of him. Potter, the stupid boy, had actually
The silence hadn’t been strained, but it hadn't been a content one either.
0~0~0~0~0
Draco turned.
It had taken Draco only a second to realise that he had messed things up between Potter and himself with his first impression, and that he was the same boy who Draco had dismissed earlier as a boy who his mother and father would not approve of. His mind had realised that he had come off as over confident (arrogant), and that maybe bringing Vincent and Greg along was not the brightest idea.
Question after question was asked, with no definite answer.
Along with sharing a dorm, Potter and he had quite a few of their classes together, and often had studied together with Granger, Weasley, and Pansy (who seemed keen on sticking to his side, or more likely keeping herself under the golden trio’s view). They also had taken it upon themselves to ditch their friends when able so it could just be the two of them.
The crunch of Potter’s nose beneath the heel of his foot gave Draco too much satisfaction. Some part of him had wondered if simply being in Voldemort’s presence once was enough to completely corrupt him. All the same, it was another moment in time that Draco could not bring himself to regret. For once, he had felt determination like any other coursing through his veins, nearly making him heady with the high of it.
Draco had hoped so.
he suddenly found himself under.
“I know your situation isn’t the best right now, and you mi-might have some regrets for choosing to help us out in the end. I know Hermione and Ron aren’t really helping matters, but that is to be expected when you keep insulting them and stuff, but at least they are still trying! I mean, bloody hell, what am I trying to say!?” Potter had moved around the table and took a few tentative steps closer to Draco.
The Dark Lord had wasted little time in scavenging his mind when he wasn’t given the answers he had all but demanded to hear from him. Draco managed to show Katie bell being jinxed and sent to Saint Mungo’s in his attempt to kill off Dumbledore. While it seemed to gain some thin bemusement from the snakelike man, it did nothing to defend him from the
In the room of hidden things, it had been easy to creep away before he was completely noticed and brace himself against a wall behind one of the many towers of who knew what.
His feet managed to move a few more feet before they each met the ground and refused to budge. He had waited too long to make his decision, and even as he stood there the seconds ticked by.
Draco had closed his eyes and turned his back on the question when Potter had first asked it. He had no response that Potter had wanted to hear, and he had been in no mood to humour him. He had been completely out of his comfort zone.
A routine had been established.
“Hey, Draco,” Potter's voice had come out strange.
Draco's eyes had looked to the closed curtain of the room, to the floor, to his bed, and back to Potter.
He had brought up the subject much later on that same day, with Potter resting in between his legs, recovering from his orgasm, but Potter had easily diverted his attention by taking Draco’s still swollen cock into his mouth and shoving three of his rectangle-like finger up Draco’s still loose arse.
0~0~0~0~0
At least, he had thought so.
A moment later, regret like nothing he had ever experienced before slammed into him. His emotions took their cue, and piled on top of him one at a time. Draco could only stumble out of the way of the invading Death Eaters, with Bellatrix and Greyback in the lead.
“Terry Boot is my mate.” Potter had quickly continued on, as if he was attempting to erase those words with the ones he had said next. As if he had any real say in the matter.
They had often used 12 Grimmauld Place as barrier between them in the world. Draco had all but moved in with Potter by then. He had been surprised his parents had not even gotten a whiff of suspicion from the large amount of time he had spent in Potter’s company.
Just as Draco was about to call out to the lone figure, Potter turned to him with an absolutely heart-stopping smile on his face.
“Draco.”
“What is wrong with you?” Potter had wondered aloud.
Though his determination had been wavering in favour of lashing out in pure irritation, Draco had been sure he would have outlasted Potter, who seemed to have begun to become annoyed himself. It had been almost an hour and a half since Draco had threatened him, and he had said nothing since.
Draco remained silent as he watched what seemed like a never-ending stream of Death Eaters invading Hogwarts. He knew it wouldn’t be all that long before the Dark Lord would join his followers.
His mother’s friends were more intent on looking at her strangely. They looked at her, he looked at them, while his mother stared at him with expressionless eyes. A whole minute passed without a spoken word.
“No, no, uh, I-I mean, uh.” Draco had little trouble in picturing Potter in that moment. One of his square hands would be shoved in his hair, pulling at it in slight frustration at not being able to come up with the right words. His chin would be turned down, his green eyes staring at the floor. His cheeks would be flushed with colour as he nibbled on his lower lip in the hopes of bringing words forth.
Draco could hardly believe his eyes. Potter was the only one standing in the clearing, staring blankly at the spot ahead of him. Both he and Draco were covered in sweat, dirt, and blood (from their own bodies and others).
Draco simply wondered when he would be able to leave.
Even more curious now, Draco decided to push aside his pain in favour of feeding his prickling need to know things that seemed important. He had walked out from behind the sculpted bush as casually as possible and asked, once all the adults’ attention had been on him, who Harry Potter was.
Draco had just been taking his first steps away when…
“I know I can come to love you, Draco. I mean, ugh, um. Ah, why is this so difficult?” Potter had shuffled around and kicked at the floor, his clothes rustling as he made the movements.
For the first time, Draco had thought that maybe he shouldn’t have refused Professor Snape's help. Especially as how if it hadn’t been for the broody man, Draco was sure he would have once again been at death’s door. Occlumency had been taught to him by that very man what seemed like many summers ago. He had had plenty of time over the years to sharpen his skill to the point he would say he wasn’t too far behind Professor Snape when it came to it.
Determination would not be the right word for what pushed him at his next attempt to fix the cabinet while also figuring out a way to murder the old headmaster.
Even when he knew there was more to him, beneath the Malfoy heir, the bully, the boy who looked for approval, and his own insecurities. Draco knew he could be more, do more, and want more. But how could he possibly even begin to find the shovel to start digging when he had little motivation. Would it be worth it in the end?
It had seemed like something right out of a fairy tale book.
But Draco had managed to survive one more day.
Potter had the oddest expression on his face. His face had been drained of most of its colour, with his wide green eyes standing out in contrast to his pale face. His chest heaved as if he had been running a marathon, while his face said he was a moment away from fainting.
0~0~0~0~0
He had not been enough for Potter, but he will be enough for himself.
Draco had been pleasantly surprised when he realized his old crew consisting of Vincent, Gregory, Blaise and Theo had showed up for their 8th at Hogwarts. He had managed to acknowledge their presence on the train before being shuffled along by the golden trio into another compartment.
0~0~0~0~0
Potter had then made a frustrated noise in his corner of the room, before he went on a fully fledged rant about Draco. His voice had gone through different octave ranges as he ran out of breath, only to start anew on another topic somehow related to Draco.
Draco's hands had been pretty interesting to look at then, as Potter seemed to be at a loss between gaping at him and strangling him.
With a moan and a twitch of the ignored erection between his legs, Harry opened his eyes.
Would it confirm that they were destined to
“Do you need a break, Harry?”
"I'm going to strap you down Harry because I don't trust you'll be a good boy and keep your hands to yourself.” He gave Harry a quick smirk. “Color?"
“Thank you, love,” the woman behind the desk said.
To be able to see what would happen when the strings connected, some time was taken to plan a nicely timed accidental run-in with Potter at the Ministry. It had to be inconspicuous, so Draco made sure he had a reason to be at the Ministry. So he chose one of the days he had to appear before the auror watching his family for their monthly meeting (
Safe with Malfoy’s breath ghosting his bits. Ha! Never did he think a day like this would ever happen. If anyone who knew them saw this scene before them would they believe that Harry was 100% willing and consenting to it? Or would they have thought foul play? It was Malfoy, wasn’t it? The whole of wizarding London thought him to be the exact same man as his father. And yet, feeling his warm pale hands slide up and down Harry’s legs, Harry felt in his core that the Draco Malfoy he knew as a child was not at all the man crouched behind him now. This man, Draco Malfoy, the dominant escort at Miss D’s, was a gift to Harry’s perverse wants and needs.
Finally, Malfoy sighed. “After my trial I was on house arrest. Then when I was free I tried to find a job, but no one would hire a former child Death Eater, so I lived off my family’s wealth until I couldn’t take the boredom anymore.”
The man smirked. Harry could practically feel it against his ear. “Good. If you need to stop because you are uncomfortable, in pain, or unsure of what is going on, please use your safeword. I will also be checking in periodically with the traffic lights, which you should also use when you need to. Please tell me what each means.”
Just above the signature lines was a simple question, “
“That’s it.”
Since that morning, Harry and Draco dated officially, telling close friends, but they rarely ventured into wizarding London together, not wanting to dodge
"Should I stop here with you and let you go home to suffer with that painfully hard cock? Your mouth was fantastic, I will admit. But I'm done. I already came. Why should I keep going and make you cum?"
Malfoy was hot on his tongue. Heavy and hot. He tasted clean, like soap, but he also tasted like sweat and leather. The taste made Harry groan.
The world came back into view when Harry opened his eyes and front in center in his sight was Draco Malfoy looking back at him. “I know,” he whispered.
Grey eyes narrowed as if suspicious. “Don’t flatter me, Potter. It won’t get you anywhere.”
She chuckled and looked away from him back to the screen. “Well, don’t be nervous. Our escorts are great with new clientele. They also love when clients come on time, so that’s a very good start. I assume you have the STD check we require?”
“You know,” Harry started. Malfoy hummed for Harry to continue when it looked like he wouldn’t. “I didn’t lie when I said you felt safe, but I have to admit that when I saw you I automatically thought you’d be a meaner dom.”
"Sorry-!" Potter started, then when he realized it was Malfoy he gave him a wary stare. "Malfoy?"
“Care to explain what the Boy Who Lived is doing at a BDSM escort service in muggle London looking for a male dominant?”
“Yes, sir.”
He knew Potter was alive when the Dark Lord presented him to the castle as dead. Potter looked dead, but Draco knew. The little string reached and Draco's heart pounded away nervously, but the little flame in his heart kept burning. That's how Draco knew Potter lived.
It was as if it was a stuffy pureblood wizard tradition that they weren’t vocal and loud during sex. Harry was going to make him moan. Harry was going to make Malfoy’s calm demeanor crack just enough to hear him moan and whimper.
“What a pretty hole,” Malfoy complimented. He circled the slick rim with his thumb, over and over again, admiring his work. Occasionally, the thumb would slip in, then back out. “It’s greedy. Keeps sucking my fingers in with so much force. Greedy and pretty. That’s exactly how I like them, Harry. I should thank you for letting me touch it, but I think I’m the one who should be thanked since I took my time with it. It’s so tight. Even my smallest plug will feel like too much.”
Harry watched through his eyelashes as Draco disrobed and walked back over to him, heels clicking on the floor like a slow heartbeat, like seconds counting down before Harry could feel good.
Malfoy studied him for a second, grey eyes moving across Harry’s body as if wanting to take it all in. There was that odd emotion in those grey eyes, again, the one that Harry couldn’t identify.
He shook his head. “No. I’m good. Thank you, sir.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he responded out loud or not, but he was thankful for the easy aftercare.
“Who would ever believe me if I told them?” Harry scoffed.
“Me, obviously.”
The Boy Who Lived.
“Our time is up,” Malfoy said once Harry had calmed his laughter.
But he couldn't stop thinking about it until he felt obsessed. There was only one thing he could do. He had to let his string connect to Potter's. He had to give in. Because Draco had to admit to himself, the string only symbolized his feelings for Harry bloody Potter.
Malfoy hummed.
“Good. I think we’re going to have a good time, don’t you think?” the man said, standing back up and away from Harry, leaving him feeling cold. “What should I call you? Do you have a specific name you want me to use or would you like me to use your real name?”
It was
Draco saw it, though. That’s what mattered.
The few yes’s though, made his stomach flip and his pants tighten.
The pace got faster and faster, Malfoy using Harry like a real life toy, fucking himself on his girth. His hands never stopped sliding up and down Harry’s body, feeling him as if he would never get the chance again. And maybe he wouldn’t. That’s why the air felt a bit desperate on Harry’s tongue. Or was that just him?
“Really?” Draco asked, face serious despite the slur to his words. “It’s what I imagined at 18. Well, the fucking anyway, not the tying you to a wall. Though that would have also been tempting to 18 year old me as well.”
Beyond a doubt, green.
“Don’t let me down, Harry. I’m going to mark you up and make your skin all pretty. I’ll decide when I’ve had enough, but if it becomes too much what should you do?”
He wasn’t in control.
And just like it did when Draco was a child, the damn string and it's connection to Potter drove him crazy. He didn't- no, he
Stupid string.
He didn’t want people to think he was out of his mind. Even if that’s how he felt sometimes.
"Fuck," Malfoy moaned. His head tipped back and his eyes closed. One of his hands left Harry's chest to jerk his still hardening cock a few times. "Holy Shit, Potter. How are you so fucking perfect?"
The sound was sloppy and wet. Malfoy stood holding his cock up into Harry’s mouth while Harry sucked and licked and kissed as best as he could. Harry moved his tongue and his lips around Malfoy's thick head, playing with the foreskin, smoothing it down, and kissing the cleft on the underside.  The beads of pre-cum on the pink flushed head of Malfoy’s cock never stayed there long before Harry’s tongue would swoop them up and tease the slit a bit, making Malfoy grunt. He liked hearing Malfoy grunt.
Draco walked around him, leaning close to his ear and whispered, “Good boy, Harry. Such a good boy for your sir. I think after I mark up your body I’ll reward you for your job well done so far. Does that sound like something you want Harry? Do you want me to reward you?”
. The hand that had once glimmered in the sun because the red string was so bright, now paled and looked so plain to him. He held it up in front of his face, just staring at it as he continued to blame himself for everything.
Malfoy had looked away, his cheeks red, and his lips forming a soft shy smile. It was cute. Harry liked it. He hoped to see it alot. He liked it perhaps as much, if not more than he liked the smirk.
“Green,” he moaned out in reply.
Malfoy snorted. “I can if you had wanted me to be. But it didn’t feel like that’s what you needed tonight. And if you did, you would have told me one way or another.”
, he would think before drifting into restless sleep.
Harry’s legs felt like jelly but he did it after some seconds of struggle. Malfoy took his time removing the plug- when had it turned off? Harry wasn’t sure. The empty and wet feeling it left behind made Harry squirm.
Malfoy rubbed the last drops along Harry's jawline, body shaking with orgasm, little moans gasping out with every shock through his tall pale body. "Fuck," he whispered. "Fuck. Good boy, Harry. You made me feel so good."
Instead of starting a fight though, Malfoy snorted then smirked. He looked over at Potter, something glittering in his grey eyes. Amusement and some other emotion Harry couldn’t place his finger on. It felt intense, though, like the smouldering grey ashes of a fire. It brought Harry back to the whole reason he was there and to what he was feeling before turning around and seeing his former school yard rival.
When the first hit landed on his arse, Harry moaned loudly. It was still a soft hit, but the change in target was a pleasant surprise.
“Good boy, Harry,” Malfoy sighed. He opened his eyes and studied Harry’s upper body, hands feeling every dip, bump, and scar- from the locket scar on his chest to scar on his hand that read “I shall not tell lies” and the small smattering of scars across his body from the many auror cases he had been on.
Malfoy huffed. His jaw ticked as he clenched it tight. “So, I decided to find a job that gave me back a modicum of control. And fucking happens to be something I enjoy, Potter. It’s a win/win situation for me. Well, until I saw your sorry mug.”
The man chuckled and the hand on Harry’s shoulder dropped to touch the center of his back, as if cradling him up with just that one soft hand.
Draco hummed and smiled. “Maybe I was always meant to bring you to your death Potter. We just didn’t know it would be death by fucking.”
The building was discreet. There was a storefront sex shop on the first floor, dildos and lube lining the shelves. Lingerie on mannequins stood in the windows. Harry couldn’t help but smirking at the thong with rhinestone studded letters spelling out Daddy’s girl.
