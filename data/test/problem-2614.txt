At the head of the table, looking young and refreshed but confused, was Sirius Black.
“You mean you didn’t just want to hear me call you old and Albus barmy for the hell of it?”
“Uh, yeah, I do need to finish up my Charms essay. Maybe I’ll go find Hermione and see if she’s done hers yet; we can do it together.” Harry stood up and grabbed his bag before turning back to Draco, who was pouting slightly at being left in the infirmary while Harry got to go off and do his homework in the library. Not that writing an essay about counter-charms and jinxes was that entertaining.
Draco gripped both of Harry’s hands in his own as he reached the last button, looking into his eyes, which seemed much too sad given their current positions. “Are you ok, Harry? You seem a little…off, lately.”
Of course she wanted to help find a cure for Severus, but she couldn’t help but think of the volumes upon volumes of information and knowledge locked away in the Potions Master’s personal notes and journals. The man was a genius with potions, and he was a fairly powerful wizard in his own right. Hermione had always admired him, even when he was acting like an evil git.
“It’s Harry...He’s d-dead,” he gasped, feeling his throat close up as the grief and realness of it all came tumbling down on him like a ton of bricks. He heard the collective gasp, the insistence that that couldn’t be true, and the choking sobs that started to take hold of Hermione, who was still kneeling before him.
“But what kind of task was it? Why haven’t we been told about this task?” Moody asked, his magical eye spinning around and around, making Harry feel vaguely ill. How the man wasn’t constantly dizzy, Harry would never know.
“Ah yes, that reminds me. Draco was having quite the laugh this morning after you left. He seemed to think I was completely unawares as to what he found so amusing, but I was quite in tuned to his muttering. You might want to remind him that I have heightened senses, especially the day after the full moon,” Remus said with a smirk. He felt his stomach flip as he saw the blush stain the Potion Master’s cheeks.
“If I searched your person and belongings, I would not find Mr. Potter’s wand? Do you know where it is or who did take it? If you do and you lie to me, you’ll take most of the heat for it,” Severus warned, crossing his own arms over his chest, looking much more intimidating than Ron did.
“If that is, in fact, what you want, Harry,” Severus responded.
There were too many of them. Even with close to seventy-five Order members present, there were at least a hundred Death Eaters, and they were intent on the most destruction possible. Severus had assigned Hermione, Ron and Draco to go about and try to stop the fires that had started to consume some of the buildings. This way they helped cap the damage and stayed out of the main fight. Severus had no idea if Harry had been successful in finding the Horcrux yet, and he and Lucius were making it a point to block the entrance of Knockturn Alley to give him more time.
“I’ll just use Glisseo charms on all of the staircases. Instant wheelchair ramps! I swear that you forget magic exists sometimes.”
“Thanks, Dad.”
“I love you so much,” Harry whispered, running his fingers through Draco’s icy locks, kissing his cheeks and forehead.
Harry realized he was trembling as he took it all in. His mother’s sacrifice was nothing now? There was no where safe for him, now. Though he hadn’t got on with the Dursleys or been happy with his having to be there, he had always believe that he would be safe there with them, but that comfort was now gone. “What…what about the Dursleys?” Harry asked timidly, already fearing the answer as Snape’s expression softened very slightly.
The weather was appropriately drab as Remus, Harry, and Hermione arrived with their portkey in hand. The Burrow looked strangely empty and sad, almost as if the house was mourning like a part of the family that lived within. A few other people had already arrived, trekking across the long field and making their way through the back gate of the Burrow’s garden.
to do it every two years, not that he actually
“Forgive us if we don’t take your words at face value, Peter. We’ll be calling in the Life Debt as well as using Veritaserum,” Remus explained as he conjured a chair to chain Peter to. They were taking no chances this time; Peter would not escape again.
“Harry! The ruby, it has to be at Borgin and Burkes! Dumbledore said that Voldemort went to work there after asking for the Defence position, and shortly after that, he disappeared for years, right? Why would he disappear like that? He had to have been using that time to make his other Horcruxes!”
Constantly monitor his body temperature and administer cooling and heating charms as needed. If he should respond abnormally, have a bad diagnostic check, or wake up, contact myself or Healer Jacobs if I am not on duty, but I would like to be notified either way. I can be contacted at the hospital or at home at any time, so don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. Are there any questions at present moment?” Abby asked with a bright smile, knowing full well that the poor Hogwarts Matron was going to be extremely overwhelmed with Draco’s care and her own Mediwitch duties for the rest of the Wizarding school. She’d have to make it a point to check up on the patient and Mediwitch often.
Severus hadn’t kissed anyone in nearly twenty years; he wasn’t quite sure what he was doing. The feeling of Remus’ soft, wet lips against his made his heart race and the beginnings of arousal started in the pit of his stomach like a hot pool of molten lava. His thumb gently caressed the werewolf’s cheek as the kiss became more passionate.
There was the sound of many footsteps thundering up the stairs. The screams were sure to have alerted the rest of the house that something was wrong. Remus had enough sense to grab his wand and close the bathroom door, locking it and warding it. He ignored the knocks and worried questions coming from the other side as he watched the Potions Master stand, holding Harry’s lifeless body in his arms still.
“Well, I’d like to understand you better, but I don’t think anyone in the world is capable of that, Hermione. You’re like an Arithmancy problem, and Merlin knows I can’t understand a word of that stuff.”
done. Look, you heard what they said. They can’t stop us; only encourage us to think carefully. So, technically, they kind of gave us permission.”
“I want to see the cottage.”
“Thank you, Severus. Harry would most likely be dead if you hadn’t gone to him.”
that someone who has witnessed a delicate memory in a person’s mind may be able to gain access to said person’s mind, even in the case of unconsciousness or unresponsiveness. It’s actually one of the techniques used by Healer’s to treat victims of Waking Dreams; it allows them to see what the victim see’s in their dream, even as they’re acting it out. It’s a coping mechanism, to help them understand their own dreams and recover from the psychological distress of the Draught. You’ve no doubt used Legilimency on Draco before, right?” Hermione asked, her eyes wide and slightly crazed as she peered at the Potions Professor determinedly.
No one else seemed to be willing to put an idea forth. The question on everyone’s mind was spoken aloud by Remus, who was fairly certain he already knew the answer. “Who would we bring back, Severus?”
Harry nodded slowly, knowing what Snape was saying was true, but not feeling any better about it. Maybe he was being melodramatic, but he’d never really had anyone to talk to about these things before; even Sirius hadn’t been the most ideal person to have a heart-to-heart with. “Like you said, what’s done is done and we can’t change the past, so why dwell on it, eh?” Harry said with a seemingly disinterested shrug. “Are you sure you don’t need anything, sir?”
“Yes, of course there is, but Hermione is utterly terrified and won’t perform the spell, and I’m too bloody thick to figure out how to do it myself. I’ve ruined
She hefted another, smaller stack of parchment and passed it out amongst the students. “These are the lists of tent partners. Please post them in the common rooms, Great Hall, and any other corridor you see fit. The Headmaster will be making an announcement tonight at supper to the rest of the school, and give instructions to have everything packed by Sunday evening. Are there any questions?”
“You cannot leave, Lucius. That was a condition of your release,” Severus reminded the elder Malfoy, who inclined his head in understanding.
...” Severus cried, holding Remus so close to him he was sure he was leaving bruises, but he didn’t care.
Remus blinked a few times in shock before smiling lightly at the Potions Master. It was strange, but good to hear his name roll off Severus’ tongue. He felt a twinge of guilt as he tried to squash down those erratic feelings, knowing Sirius was probably rolling in his proverbial grave. “Hopefully I will never need to redeem that Life Debt, eh? I’ve been too close to death too many times already; I’d prefer it if the score was left uneven.”
Severus blushed even more as Remus chuckled at him. “Merlin’s balls; that kid is
“You’re so tall now,” Lucius whispered, being only a few inches taller than his young son.
“You see, Tom, that has always been your biggest flaw. You could never do the thing you just told me to do – die like a man. You feared death so much that you turned yourself into this warped, horrible creature to avoid it. You’ve mistaken immortality for power, Tom. You cannot live forever, because you have never truly lived. You have never loved; you have never cared for anyone. You’ve never known friendship or compassion, and I feel sorry for you. This, this shield around me,
Severus nodded, sharing Harry’s feelings almost exactly. It was extremely odd, and yet strangely satisfying, wanting all of this to work out so badly. For even though he had hated James Potter, he had loved Lily Evans, and if truth be told, he had longed to be Harry’s father. Now it was time for him to truly honour his promise to Lily, and protect her son – and his – any way that he possibly could. Sometimes devotion knew no depths or boundaries.
“We’re not children, and we prefer not to make noise if it’s going to set Severus off, no offence,” Draco said, glancing over at his godfather, who was sitting in his favourite armchair across from the other three, who took up the couch.
“Wait a minute. The Order doesn’t know about the Horcruxes. Hell, most of the Weasleys don’t know about them. What are we supposed to tell the Order?” Remus asked, giving Harry a little bit of pause. The teen hadn’t really thought about that. He was so used to everyone around him knowing about the Horcruxes that he almost forgot it was supposed to be a secret.
“Thank you, Dad,” Harry whispered into the thick wool of Severus’ robes, hoping it would mask the fresh tears that had started to fall. By Merlin, he felt like such a cry baby. He’d never cried so much in his entire life before that summer.
Hermione sighed as she passed the study schedule to Draco. “Don’t
“Er, Hermione – how is Harry supposed to disarm Voldemort with his wand if the two can’t be used against one another?” Ron asked his girlfriend, the look of confusion on his face mirrored by a few others at the table.
Harry groaned as they entered their dungeon quarters, smiling at Remus as the werewolf looked up from grading midterm essays. “I thought we weren’t going to have rehearsed answers for anything, and besides, we don’t know what we’ll be asked.”
Draco winced and looked up, a pained expression on his face. “I’m sorry, Harry...I found out about it in third year, or at least I suspected. I was talking to Crabbe and Goyle about it, but Zabini was there. I forgot that he knew as well. I have no idea how he could have known it was in your bag during class today, though. I swear I didn’t say anything.”
“Hey, mate. This is finally it. After tonight, you won’t have to worry about old Snake Face ever again,” said Ron with an encouraging grin, causing Harry’s mouth to twitch into small grin as he accepted a hug from Hermione and a pat on the back from Ron.
“Yeah, trust me, I know. I happened to look down while hanging on by one hand. I’m bloody glad I’m so scrawny and could pull myself up. Why do you think it happened?” Harry asked, flexing his newly healed fingers as his father stowed his wand away.
and not
“Harry, is everything ok?” Remus asked immediately upon seeing his son.
“You’re welcome, Harry. Now prepare to be put to shame,” Severus said with a devilish smirk.
“I’ve asked Professor Snape to adopt me, and he’s agreed to do it,” said Harry without further ado. He felt a sudden weight lift from his shoulders and the knots in his stomach loosen considerably. He blinked owlishly, however, when all he received from Dumbledore was a knowing smile and a few words of congratulations.
“What does he say every time, Harry? Just so we know what’s different,” Severus asked, his wand still trained on the orb as he gazed at his son with a calculating look.
After making sure Severus was comfortable in bed, Remus lay down next to his husband, the book the Healers had returned to him upon their retreat from the hospital clutched in his hands. It was both sickening and a Godsend.
“I still want to see it. I was born here; this is where I spent my only time with my birth parents. I need to see where they were killed. If I see the destruction, maybe it will help me not to feel so numb. I’m losing steam, Dad. I don’t know how much longer I can handle searching for these Horcruxes, fighting just to stay alive. I’m so tired of it all; I just want to go to sleep and not wake up again.”
Harry stared dumbly at Snape for nearly a full minute, not quite sure he had heard correctly. When Snape cocked an eyebrow impatiently he realized he was actually supposed to answer that. “Er...Yeah, goodnight, then,” Harry said, feeling extremely awkward indeed. He’d never seen the snarky Potions Professor so defeated before.
Remus laughed openly, his amber eyes sparkling in amusement. Even after the laughter had died out of his voice, he and Severus just stared at each other. Remus tried to push away to feeling that he was betraying Sirius. He had loved Sirius very much, yes, but Sirius was gone and he couldn’t grieve over his lost lover forever, else he end up in an early grave himself. He knew if the opportunity presented itself, he would take it almost immediately. Something occurred to him just then. “What if I moved in here to help you and Harry out, Severus? I could help Harry by assisting you myself, and help you by taking care of Harry while you’re still ill. It would only be for the remainder of the summer, or until you got better.”
“Please have a seat wherever you’d like. Would you like a cup of tea?” Severus asked as he waited for the woman to decide where to sit before seating himself. He felt slightly annoyed when the woman chose his armchair to sit in, but brushed it off as he sat down beside Harry on the sofa. Maybe it would be better to be closer to Harry just then.
Remus had already pulled out quill, ink and parchment, placing it all on the desk in the corner and directing Draco to sit down. The other three all hovered around him, and he shifted uncomfortably under their scrutiny.
“Are you ok, Harry? You’re dreadfully pale.”
“When I was younger, about the same age you and Draco are now, the Dark Lord was just beginning to gain popularity. He was rumoured to be powerful and charismatic, and was bound to do great things. He stood for all of the things I had grown up believing, and flocking to a figurehead who might be able to change things seemed like the thing to do. My parents were so proud when I joined the Death Eaters, bringing with me many friends, and leaving a trail of whispers to the younger generations still in school, like your father.
Harry’s eyes sprang open and he sat up, jostling Hermione, who had fallen asleep with her head on his still embarrassingly bare chest. She sat up stretched, stopping mid-yawn when she saw a group of three fourth year girls and two fifth year boys staring and pointing. Harry gave her a pained look, already imagining the wild rumours that were going to spread now.
“We need everything you know, Wormtail. I don’t believe the Dark Lord would confide in you necessarily, but as his personal servant, you spend quite a lot of time around him. Surely you’ve overheard something of importance. The problem is determining if anything you heard was in fact of any importance at all. If there is anything you
Harry and Draco paused in their bickering as Ron stumbled into their tent, looking around with his mouth agape at their spell-work. Hermione joined a moment after Ron, giving the extended tent an appreciative nod, and glaring when Pansy pranced in behind her, looking like she owned the place.
Harry sighed as he pulled Draco down for another kiss, wrapping his arms around the blonde protectively. “Hopefully ‘eventually’ comes sometime before Christmas,” he chuckled, content to just lay there with the Slytherin for the rest of the night. He knew, however, that Severus would soon be in to separate the two.
Remus pulled out his wand and conjured a bowl of warm water and a wash cloth. He began to sponge away the dried blood and muck around a few open wounds that he could see on Snape’s abdomen and chest. “He’s alive, but only just. He’s covered in flesh wounds; looks like he was hit with a Cutting hex over and over. I’m sure he has quite a few broken bones as well. Here, take this cloth and very carefully clean around the wounds so that I can start healing them,” Remus said as he conjured another cloth and handed it to Harry. He turned to look at Charlie, who was standing back with his wand still raised.
“Harry, you really should be eating more. You’re still far too thin, and you’ll undoubtedly start Defence training this summer. You need to keep your strength up,” Hermione admonished as she watched her friend push his nearly full plate of food away.
“I’ll do it. I’ll tell you everything,” Lucius said quickly, his eyes wide. His hands shook as his son moved back towards him, placing a hand firmly on his shoulder. The elder Malfoy looked down at his son, excitement and fear in his expression. “Do you trust Potter?”
“Harry, stop it! That is not true. You can’t keep blaming yourself for these things, son. I told you that I would die for you, and I meant it. If it was my time to go, then it was my time. You do not have control over fate.”
me, Draco. Yes, I didn’t go back to my room, I went to talk to Hermione because I was upset and you and Dad wouldn’t give me a chance to explain anything! I had to talk to someone, and she’s my best friend. I was wearing sleep pants and my dressing gown because that’s what I had been wearing when I tried to talk to you. We were both exhausted after talking for hours, and we both fell asleep. It was purely innocent, I promise you. Why can’t you just trust me?”
Everyone whipped around in their seats as the smooth voice spoke from the doorway of the drawing room. Lucius was standing there, leaning against the doorframe drinking from a tumbler which appeared to be half-full of firewhiskey. His absurd snake-headed cane was held loosely in his grasp as he twirled it in lazy circles.
“Now the only thing left is to decide how to split the Order up. What do we need, exactly?” Remus said, looking up from the parchment he had been taking notes on. He smiled over at Hermione, who was doing the same thing.
“Um, Wednesday?” Harry answered, completely thrown by Remus’ question. He couldn't remember what was significant about the next day.
Lucius nodded slowly in acceptance, knowing his son was right in the end. “Well since I cannot dissuade you from putting yourself out there into the thick of things, I will allow you to join the Order, but only once you’re of age.”
“Did it work; is Draco still in a coma?” He asked quickly even as he clutched at his spinning head.
Harry ran out of Snape’s bedroom, where he had been playing wizard’s chess with Charlie. He felt his heart jump into his throat as he saw Remus carry a half naked but covered Snape over to the Transfigured bed in the living room. He was covered in dirt and blood, his hair tangled and matted. “Oh God, is he alive?” Harry asked as he hovered close to the bed, trying to resist going to Snape and checking him over.
Harry and Severus both shared a look as they thought about the Healer’s question.
Severus snorted as he shook his head slowly. “What is it with you Gryffindors and your melodrama? Why can’t you just be straightforward without all the bells and whistles for once?”
“I think that was a wise decision indeed, Harry. He’s been informed of all the requirements, yes? I should like to start teaching yourself and Professor Snape the spell that will need to be done in order to activate the ward as soon as possible. Has the application been filed yet?”
“It’s ok; I deserved it.”
Remus glanced quickly over at Snape, his eyes flashing with gratitude. “
“Dad,
“You remember who I am though, Draco?” Severus asked, catching on to the boy using his name when nobody else seemed to have noticed.
Harry removed the last of the candles and started to cut the cake, frowning over at his father. “Well why not? Come on, even if it seems ridiculous, you should make one anyways. It’s like a birthday rule or something.”
It was as though there was a line as Lucius was next to approach Harry. The Gryffindor was momentarily worried he was about to receive a hug from the Malfoy, but the man simply held out his hand, which Harry took instinctively into his own. “I wish you good luck, Mr. Potter. It is high time the Dark Lord’s reign of terror has been put to an end. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of it.”
Ginny was definitely angry now as her face turned red, much like her brother’s often did when upset. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at Harry. “
“As I’ve told you before, having a Dementor boggart is pretty unique. It suggests that what you fear most is fear itself,” explained Remus in a careful tone, almost as if he knew Harry was not fond of that fact.
“Now the problem is figuring out where in the room it’s in. We can hardly tear up the entire room,” Severus said with a scowl. He had already plucked at least three splinters from his fingers already, and he was sure there was more to come as he glanced at the moulding and decrepit wood. If he and Remus had really been from the London Metropolitan Board of Works, this building would have failed utterly.
Severus felt like he was a hundred years old as he sat back in his cushy armchair, a cup of tea steaming on the table beside him. It had been half an hour since he’d sent his son to bed, and he was finally able to relax. He felt drained after the confrontation with Harry, and all he wanted to do was finish the most up-to-date Potions Compendium from Germany before heading to bed himself, where he would sleep alone again. His irritation and worry for Remus surged as he tried not to think about where his lover was, or what he was doing. He wanted him home, and waiting for his return without any word of his whereabouts was practically torture.
While he had been blocking another cutting hex, Lucius lost sight of Avery for a second too long, and suddenly he was behind Draco. Without even thinking, Lucius grabbed Draco by the collar, pulled him tight to his chest, and spun around. He took a cutting curse full strength in the back, and for a moment, he couldn’t breathe. White hot fire consumed his entire being as he felt the warm moisture of his own blood soak through his robes quickly.
After washing his hands and trying unsuccessfully to smooth his fly away hair down, Harry made for the exit to the boy’s loo. He stumbled as somebody walked right into him, causing his glasses to fall off. As he bent down to pick them up, he saw the person who had bumped into him already holding his glasses out to him. He slipped them on and frowned as he looked up at Blaise Zabini.
Harry frowned and blushed slightly as he moved his noodles around his plate disinterestedly. “I only got an Exceeds Expectations in Potions.”
A shocked silence greeted Professor McGonagall’s words as all the Prefects gaped at each other. Evacuation? It was only just March; were they being sent home early?
Draco beamed at his father, wrapping him a quick hug before pulling away once more. “You know I turn seventeen in just a few months, right?”
Draco smiled sadly at Harry, leaning forward so that their lips nearly touched. “I’m not angry, just a little confused, but I trust you.” He leaned forward the remaining distance and pressed his lips gently to Harry’s.
“That means the memory is slightly warped, or wrong. I think taking the credit for my Quidditch position might have done that,” Harry chuckled, watching as the mist turned red once more.
yourself, Harry? You talk to
S~S~S~S
Where Number Four Privet Drive used to be, there stood the smoldering wreckage of some sort of explosion, far beyond being recognizable as a house. Smoke was rising from many small fires littered in the debris, but all else was still. The neighboring houses had not been affected in the slightest bit, nor did their in habitants seem to be aware that Number Four had been blown to bits.
There was a soft hissing sound, and the gigantic snake sleeping by the fire rose from its slumber, sending back an answering hiss before moving towards the armchair. She slithered up the side and wrapped her body around the back of the chair, her neck as thick as a strong man’s thigh. Her head came to rest on her master’s shoulder, and she hissed contently as a pale, long fingered hand stroked her snout lovingly.
However, Draco turned and smirked haughtily at Snape, walking backwards in a show of overconfidence. “You’re right, Severus; I was coddled enough by
“We’ll let him sleep a little longer to get used to the counter-curse and treat him with some more healing potions to get rid of any lingering infection, then we’ll wake him. I’m confident that he’ll be alright now, however. You did well, Mr. Lupin-Snape.”

,” Harry snapped, sneering at the Potions Professor just as fiercely as Remus had been before. He knew it probably wasn’t the best time to piss Snape off again, but he needed to get that off of his chest while the anger was still fresh.
The castle was in disarray after the notices went up and the announcements were made for the move out onto the grounds. Students were complaining about their tent mates, having to camp outside like animals – that one had been Pansy Parkinson – and even some celebrating about the hiatus on classes. Professors were scrambling to get their projects finalized for their students to complete during the hiatus, and house elves were working overtime, helping to set up the make-shift camp ground on the Quidditch pitch with Professors Flitwick and McGonagall.
“Please, Draco – ”
Charlie noticed that Harry seemed relieved after Tonks had left through the floo and chuckled to himself. “She’s a lot to handle, Tonks, but she means it all in good spirit. Kind of grows on you after a while, really. How’ve you been holding up, Harry? I know it can’t be easy being holed up here with Snape all summer.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, but preceded Lucius out of the room, sending Harry one last worried glance before both Ron and Lucius followed her out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
I have a proposition for all my readers, however; I intend to have Harry go on through his seventh year as well, what I want to know from all of you is if you’d prefer it to stay all together in one story, or if I should make his seventh year a sequel to Never Alone? Please review and let me know what you all think! This will be a very big and important decision for me, as I’m still working on the plot line quite a bit, and knowing where to end Never Alone is obviously very important. Thanks again to all my readers; I wouldn’t be able to write as I do without you! Hope you enjoy this extra long chapter!
Molly could not help but feel relieved at her daughter’s words and her son’s nods of agreement. She would never have gone against any of her children’s wishes, but she just couldn’t stand the thought of seeing Arthur so helpless for the rest of his life. He deserved much better than a half-life. She turned her attention then to Harry and Hermione, who were still clutching onto each other and trying to stem their tears.
Harry was completely shocked. That year, Draco had gone around the school spouting off about Mudbloods and was such an evil shite, he, Ron and Hermione had been convinced he was the one behind the attacks. The Draco he knew now he could see apologizing to Ginny, but the Draco of the past?
Draco rolled his eyes as he charmed both his and Harry’s trunks to follow them out of the oak doors leading to the grounds. All living beings had to be evacuated from the school by noon in order to start the stripping of the wards, which in itself would take two full weeks.
Death Eater’s son, eh? You are learning Occlumency for a reason, you idiot child, and that’s to keep things like the Prophecy safe from prying eyes! You do realize that you just told
Harry snapped out of it as he realized the voice wasn’t in his head, but coming from the man himself, who was standing in front of the sofa carrying a battered cloak and trunk.
Harry only had time to shake his head before he doubled over, sending Fawkes flying off to his perch beside the Headmaster’s desk. Snape quickly conjured a bucket and pushed it forward to catch Harry’s case of weak stomach, while Remus rubbed circles on his back comfortingly.
“Let’s get this over with, love.”
“A bit, but not much,” Harry said quietly, not sure why he was talking about it with Tonks of all people. As down to earth as she was, Harry had become increasingly annoyed with her while she had been guarding him at the cottage. Maybe it had been a combination of feeling the prisoner and being baby sat that made him irritable in the first place, not Tonks herself.
“Thanks, Abigail,” Severus said, pretending to read the forms as he waited for the Healer’s reaction to his remembering her. He looked up after quickly signing both sheets and found the Healer smirking at him, her eyes sparkling even in the dim light of the ward.
Remus leaned forward once more and dug around under the tree. He made a noise of discovery as he pulled out a particular package and handed it to Harry, smiling warmly at him. “It’s not much, but I saw it and it reminded me of you.”
Severus felt his stomach do a flip at the sound of Harry referring to him so comfortably as his father, but he didn’t let it affect him so much that he lost his sense. “It isn’t your fault at all, Harry. Do not blame yourself for something you had absolutely no control over. You don’t know where she is, or who may have taken her or why. I’m sorry, Harry, but it won’t be possible for you to help with the search. There are others out looking for her; you need to stay safe here at the castle.”
“Harry...Dad’s in St. Mungo’s. He’s dying,” Ron croaked, his face screwed up in misery as Hermione wrapped her arms around him and pulled him into a hug, Ginny joining in from the side and creating a tearful group hug.
“A lot has happened. I don’t even know if I can fully explain it all, really,” Harry said before launching into a very long, very confusing story, forcing Remus to wait until he was done to ask any questions. The man was terribly confused.
“Is everything ok, Dad?” Harry asked tentatively as he took in the worried expressions on his parents’ face. Aurora looked more exasperated than worried, which helped curb Harry’s own sudden flare of panic, but not by much.
“Lies! Tell me, or I’ll decorate this alley with your innards!”
. “Translate it yourself. It’ll help pass the time.”
Lucius nodded slowly and wrapped an arm around his son’s shoulders, pulling the young Slytherin closer to him. “Then I am happy for you, Dragon. That’s all I want for you, to be happy.”
“I know you are. I’m sorry for yelling at you, but that does not mean I’m still not very angry with you. I think we still need to talk about this, but later. I’m just glad you are here – that you’re safe. I’ve never been so devastated in my life, Harry.” Severus’ voice began to tremble, and he stopped before he completely lost it again. He didn’t think it would be physically possible to cry any more than he already had, but he could feel his eyes burning.
Draco gave him a smug, self-satisfied smile as he added the next ingredient, rose water, and nudged Harry’s shoulder playfully. “You really are part Slytherin.”
Draco nodded, finding himself impressed with Harry’s obvious knowledge. “The first sign, as you listed them in correct order, is an interruption in your concentration. There is a sense, something that cannot be adequately explained, that magical beings possess, telling them that there is something lurking in their mind that should not be there. That feeling, often described as a break in privacy, is what sets off the alarm bells that something isn’t right. The second sign, reliving memories and/or thoughts without recalling them yourself, is the obvious sign that you’re being Legilimized.” Draco stood up and began pacing, his wand held loosely at his side. He’d done this before, teaching a few fellow house mates the skill while at Hogwarts.
“Harry had a nightmare. I went to go check on him.”
Remus thought about that for a while, getting lost in his own thoughts. He was pulled out of his reverie by noticing how Severus winced when he shifted. “Harry isn’t giving you a hard time about having to assist you, is he? He’s never been a selfish child, but with the history between you two…”
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say to the man, so he simply shook his hand and smiled, giving a firm nod of acknowledgement. The blonde smiled back at him, and a sense of understanding seemed to pass silently between them. The two sides of the war had come together to put it to an end, and Harry’s sense of everything coming full circle heightened.
“He does not deserve to know the details if the fool is going to let his mind be read like a children’s book! If he cannot keep the information safe in his head, then I will keep it safe in a bottle,” Severus snarled, taking a step closer to the werewolf as well, standing his ground without an ounce of fear.
stupid, Harry, but I don’t think you’re fully to blame. Don’t let the guilt take you over, yeah? I’m sure they’ll find a way to wake young Malfoy up; it’ll just take time. Try not to let Severus get to you so much, either. It’s quite unnerving to see you so frightened of him.”
“Hermione was wondering if Draco and I could go with her to Hogsmeade. She still needs to get her parents something for Christmas, and I told her I would help her pick something out. We’ll ask Hagrid to escort us again,” Harry said, his expression betraying nothing as he smiled at Severus. Oh, he was getting good at Occlumency, and it was all thanks to the Potions Master.
,” Draco sobbed as he gave up casting spells and just held his father to his chest instead. He knew he could not stay where he was long, as a Death Eater was bound to see him and take advantage of his vulnerable position. He realized he could no longer hear or feel his father’s rattling breaths, and with a streak of fear and panic, he cast a spell to detect the elder Malfoy’s pulse. There was none. Draco felt all of the air leave his lungs as he clutched desperately to his father’s lifeless body and sobbed violently against the hair that had now faded back to platinum blond.
“You guys seem to be mistaken into thinking I
“You do have a point, after all…Well, I suppose we can have an Inter-Ministry workings group. After all, there are quite a few of you who work for the Ministry, and we can use that leverage, should we ever need it. Percy, it’s all yours.” Minerva tried very hard not to laugh at the look of self-importance on her former-student’s face.
“There’s been a mass break-out from Azkaban, Draco.”
The Potions Master looked lost in thought as he leaned against the headboard, stroking his chin as he stared at something off in the distance. “The Headmaster is busy, I’m sure. The last time Harry was having these issues, Dumbledore didn’t do anything about it.”
Harry had to blink a few times before all the information that had just been dumped on him would filter past the sleep still fogging his mind. He had slept in,
“Mum’s going to freak. I’ll head off the entourage waiting for Harry to awake.”
Harry smirked as goose pimples broke out across his arms. He pulled away from Draco before they attracted too much attention in the still crowded basement kitchen. “Yeah, I want you to.”
Harry sat up and scooted closer to his father, taking his wrist in hand to study the bracelet for himself. Moisture started to collect in his eyes once again as he read the initials over and over again, as if repeating the letters in his head would somehow bring his mother back. “I want to go there.”
Peter’s head dropped in shame and remorse as he gave a pitiful sob. The noise was at once heart wrenching and music to their ears; Pettigrew deserved whatever pain he was currently feeling. Watery eyes looked up and made contact first with Remus’, then with Harry’s.
“Goodnight, Harry.” Severus didn’t wait long for a response, as he knew he wouldn’t be getting one. He closed the door carefully behind him and returned to the sitting room to finish marking papers before he turned in for the night.
WARNING: Thoughts of self-harm. From this point on, there may be some VERY triggering things to some readers. I apologize for that, but this is the way the story was heading since I started it. Some of this chapter and almost all of the next two were written a really long time ago, and I can’t really change the plot this far in. Please try to bear with me and don’t abandon this story!
“Where’s my dad, where’s Moony?” Harry asked Professor McGonagall as she assisted Professor Sinistra in making sure Draco and Harry were not harmed.
“It’s incredibly hard to find, as people were so prejudiced against vampires when it was first published, it was banned by almost every wizarding bookstore. Why do you ask, Hermione?”
They both laughed as the portrait of Albus Dumbledore gave a soft chuckle in his sleep. Severus knew all of the past Headmasters and –mistresses only pretended to sleep, while really listening to every word they said. This was his way of giving Albus a hard time, even after the man had left the realm of the living. He missed the old man dearly.
A soft knock on the door made Harry look up from his essay; the one he hadn’t even started on yet. He smiled as Remus peeked his head in and gestured for the man to come in. “Hey Remus.”
Remus snorted, but quickly tried to turn it into a cough. He wasn’t fooling Severus. His husband sent him a weak glare and huffed indignantly. “You are such a child sometimes.”
“Not necessarily. The year he opened the Chamber, many students were petrified by the Basilisk’s gaze, much like our second year. A death could have been passed off as another victim of the monster. Besides, only one student died...” Hermione stopped as she seemed to realize what she was saying, and shared a look with Ron and Harry.
, Harry Potter.
“I know it’s my Coming of Age, but I can’t afford to get pissed and risk the chance of being too smashed to move. What if something happens, an attack, and we’re all too drunk to help? No, we can’t.”
beyond achieving his goals, beyond the ‘Greater Good.’”
Something seemed to click in Remus’ mind, and with sudden clarity, he knew that’s exactly what it was going to take to find this Horcrux. Without stopping to consider his actions, Remus knelt down and placed his wand before him on the floor, rolling it a bit away from himself. The reaction was immediate as the floorboards about a foot away from Severus began to pulse with a red glow.
Severus pulled away just enough to meet Remus’ eyes and felt his stomach flip. This might be the very last time he ever embraced the love of his life. “I love you, Remus. Please,
“You’re both stupid, and when Harry ends up hurt over this, I’ll be sure to tell you that I told you so. Coming, Draco? There are a few things in your essay I’d like to discuss with you, if you’re willing,” Hermione said, holding Draco’s essay hostage as she began to turn away.
The infirmary was oddly quiet as Severus walked in. He almost considered the possibility of a quick escape by the boys, but a shuffling sound from behind the curtain currently blocking his view of Draco’s bed told him otherwise. He was almost afraid to walk around the curtain, not sure if he wanted to see what the boys were up to.
“I told you so,” Hermione said smugly as she plucked up an apple and bit into it. Harry scowled and shoved the scroll into his pocket, bumping his arm into Draco as he did so and making the blonde spill his pumpkin juice on his white shirt.
His Will had already been written, sitting off to the side in an envelope, ready to be sent off to Gringott’s once Harry included the letters he had attached to his bequests. The last thing to do was write these letters. Harry had thought long and hard about what he was going to say, but as Harry untwisted the cap on the ink well and dipped the sharp nib in, all the planned words seemed to fade away. He stared at the blank parchment, lost.
Harry felt completely thrown. He’d never imagined he’d be having this conversation with Ron about Hermione, but it was real and it seemed Ron was heavily guilt ridden. “Hey, mate, like Hermione said; you didn’t do it alone. It was a mistake on both your parts, but I think you’ll both be able to handle the consequences. Hermione’s a genius and you’re stronger than you give yourself credit for. I know you’re both scared, but I think telling someone older, someone who would know what to do is what’s going to help get you through this. You know I’m always here for you too. And yeah, Mum might kill you, but then she’ll hug you for giving her her first grandbaby,” Harry said with a cheeky grin as he threw an arm around his best mate and pulled him into a brief side hug.
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose in a pray for patience as he tried to reel in his already simmering temper. “Draco, as much as we still need to discuss your whereabouts over the last month, that is not what I brought you in here to talk about. Make no mistake, however; we
“Come, we’ve got research to do,” said Severus as he led the way out of the Headmaster’s office. He looked back at Remus, who was frowning deeply. Severus knew if he walked away from the conversation he’d been having with Remus before this latest drama developed, he might never be able to salvage the relationship. But when he looked at Harry, and thought about his pale, unconscious godson, his mind set them as priorities above all others. He turned back and walked on, feeling the bridge burn as he did so.
“What time is it?” Severus asked in a quiet, raspy voice. He rubbed a hand over his tired eyes as he sat up, feeling his back protest after being curled in a strange position for so long.
Tonks’ smile turned to a curious frown as she cocked her head to the side and studied Harry like he was an interesting piece of art on display. “Who would have thought, eh? The way Severus was being so...well, gentle isn’t exactly the right word, but even though he was right livid with you, he was still so...
Draco sat up, realizing that Harry was much more stressed out than he anticipated. He moved over to sit beside the Gryffindor, pulling one of his hands into his lap to lace their fingers together. “Listen to me Harry, and listen good! You are
“Please...I beg you! I tried, we tried! I was not the only one to fail, my Lord. Please!” The figure begged in a rasping, deep male voice. He shuffled closer to Harry on his knees, his head still bent down to avoid meeting Harry’s eyes.
Severus shared a look with Remus and a silent conversation seemed to take place with just their eyes and expressions. They knew each other so well, inside and out. “As soon as possible. I say we take a break, get something to eat and time to settle our thoughts first, but I think tonight.”
Remus gulped visibly and shared a look with Draco before answering Snape. “Draco said he recognized one of the men who just walked by and are now standing very close to Ron and Hermione from one of his father’s Death Eater dinner parties.”
Harry was stunned in place, unable to think or move or speak. He just stared at the blonde man before him, tears gathering in his eyes. The pain of losing Sirius shot up through him as though it was fresh, and hearing someone finally take responsibility for the man’s death instead of blaming it on himself was threatening to undo him. Before he could speak a single word, a strangled sounding voice startled both himself and Lucius.
Harry stood up and covered his left eye, taking a step back as Snape motioned for him to stand a bit further away. He squinted his right eye, trying to focus on the extremely blurry shape. It wasn’t too difficult to make out that it was an ‘E’, but it amazed him just how blurry that ‘E’ was. “It’s an ‘E’.”
Harry felt slightly uncomfortable with the idea of staying alone with Snape in his current condition. What if something went wrong and he needed some sort of quick healing? Harry only knew one healing spell, and it was the simplest one. He sighed and nodded his agreement to Remus. “Ok…Just…Come back in one piece, yeah?”
“Because in a way, you’re all my children too. Severus is too upset to really think about anyone else, but I hardly blame him. It’s just…such a shock. I had no idea Harry had even thought about doing such a thing.”
“Can we please go back to the library? I want to learn this, I need to learn this...” he asked quietly, still not looking up at either Professor.
Remus’ angry expression smoothed out into one of faint curiosity and worry. If this was worse even than the Horcruxes, he couldn’t even begin to imagine what his husband had been researching. “What do you know, Severus?”
“Why are you being so nice? You’re supposed to hate me, whether or not you’re an Order member and Hogwarts Professor. Why the hell do you care about ‘protecting and keeping me safe’? If it wasn’t your
“What?”
“I’m sorry, Draco. I’m sure Professor Dumbledore didn’t mean to hurt you. Don’t worry, I won’t let him anywhere near your memories again, I promise. Now why don’t you get back in bed and take these potions for me, alright? They’ll make you feel better,” said Severus, trying to be as calm and soothing as possible.
?” Harry asked, horrified by the very thought. He got his answer by Draco’s quiet whimper and subtle shudder.
Ron pulled away from Hermione and, before Harry knew what was happening, he threw himself into Harry’s arms, crying on the shorter teen’s shoulder. His lanky frame shook as he cried, holding tightly to his best mate. “I’m sorry too, Harry. I’m sorry...”
“Much happened over the course of the school year; Harry became estranged from Ron and Ginny Weasley, he was guilt ridden over Draco’s condition and spent nearly every free moment at his bedside while Hermione, Remus and myself searched for a way to awaken him. Dumbledore was fatally cursed by a ring and had only a year left to live. After Draco woke up, he had amnesia and Harry struggled to help him get his memories back. During all this time, Dumbledore had been searching for a more secure form of warding to protect Harry since the blood warding on the Dursleys’ had been broken. He found a Gaelic warding spell, but in order for it to work, Harry would need to be bonded to a guardian. The Weasleys offered to become Harry’s guardians, but he decided to ask me in the end. I adopted Harry at the end of the year, quite readily, and the wards were put in place.” Severus knew Sirius had many questions from the range of emotions flying across his face, but the man smartly held them in for the time being.
Harry’s lip trembled as he nodded jerkily. He felt helpless, wanting to run to Draco’s side and make sure he was ok, even if the Slytherin had no idea who he was. “Ok, go make sure he’s alright.” A hand descended on his shoulder, and he instinctively reached up and grasped it.
Draco half-glared half-smiled at Harry’s antics, pulling the Gryffindor so that he fell into his lap. He brushed the unruly locks away from Harry’s eyes as he kissed him gently on the lips. “I’m sorry, love. I’m just...worried, scared, confused. You name it.”
Well, that was actually a pretty hard question to answer, Draco mused. He seemed to have lots of conflicting memories floating about in his head, and some that seemed pretty ludicrous. Since when did his mind supply memories of him
And two, I’m in love with Harry, and nothing is going to change that.”
The door creaked softly as Severus pushed it closed behind him, walking as quietly and soft-footed as he could into the room and craning his neck to see over the blankets blocking Remus’ face from view. He took another step and spotted Remus’ extremely pale cheek, the long red scar running from the corner of his mouth up his cheek making a stark contrast with the skin there. The slow rise and fall of the man’s chest showed that he was asleep, and he seemed to be alright, but Severus wasn’t quite satisfied with that. He took another tentative step and peered down at the sleeping werewolf. He impulsively reached out a hand and swept away the gold locks from Remus’ forehead, making it much easier to see Remus’ still-closed eyes.
Draco cocked an eyebrow as he stared at Harry, sure that he was going to say he was only joking. It never came. “So you’re saying that this ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’...is love?” he asked incredulously, feeling slightly disappointed. He had hoped that Potter possessed some sort of extraordinary magical powers that would rival any of the Dark Lord’s extensive powers, but love? He certainly hadn’t expected that curve ball.
Severus took the potion and drained it, pushing the vial back into Harry’s hand. He shook his head slowly as he propped himself up on the pillows behind him. His head started to clear as the potion took effect, making it much easier to think. “A glass of water would be nice, thank you.”
Draco shrugged at his boyfriend, who was glaring at the Gryffindor witch as she walked away, the blonde traipsing along beside her to discuss the finer intricacies of Arithmatic theory.
“You mean possession?” Harry asked, feeling slightly sick just at the idea. The one time Voldemort had tried to possess him at the Ministry was the single most painful moment of his entire life, and he had absolutely no desire to go through such a thing again.
Draco remembered then that they had each been given portkeys back to Headquarters in case of medical emergency. He rummaged in Lucius’ robes, hiccupping sobs wracking his body as his hands shook uncontrollably. He found the small coin in a side pocket and pressed it to his father’s chest.
“Who’s that from, Harry?” Hermione asked as she slipped into the seat beside Harry and tried to read his evening post over his shoulder.
Harry’s brow furrowed, not quite sure why Neville would need to stay the night, but glad to see his friend anyways. “Well, happy belated birthday. How was your coming of age?” Harry asked as everyone moved from the entrance hall down into the basement kitchen, where there was every kind of food you could think of lining the table, and a gigantic cake in the middle covered in chocolate icing.
“Not all yours? Blood, you mean? Ok, but I still think it would be safest to send you for medical attention, ok? If I see your father, I’ll let him know.”
Herbology- Acceptable
“If there were some way, Remus, would you truly want another child?” Severus asked quietly, ignoring the way Harry gasped. Clearly, the boy had no idea the can of flobberworms he was opening with his question.
The dungeon door closing with a sharp snap brought Harry’s attention up from his Transfiguration essay. He immediately looked back down when he noticed Snape’s expression, however. He already felt bad enough as it was, but he was sure he was about to get an earful anyways. Setting his quill and parchment aside, he waited for the shouting to begin. It never came.
Back in his study, he pulled out a clean sheet of parchment from the drawer dedicated to his personal stationary and dipped a quill into the pot of ink at the head of the desk. It was short, concise, and to the point. He couldn’t let Draco see his fear or sorrow; he had to maintain the mask he’d always worn. It wouldn’t do to let his son see him so weak.
Harry practically dove for his Hogwarts trunk, which was lying at the foot of his bed. He wrenched it open and began digging through the messy contents, looking for the small, velvet bag Remus’ communication device had been in.
“Remus, you gave us a start,” Severus said on an exhale as he lowered his wand and slipped it back into his pocket, noticing that Harry did the same only after Severus did; strange, that.
Harry thanked Molly for the tea and the pep talk, feeling a little bit better about his plans now. He informed her that he needed some time alone, so he would come down to dinner when he felt ready. She understood his unspoken request not to bother him, and assured him she would keep the others from bothering him until he was ready for company once more.
“Fourth floor, Spell Damage,” an eerie voice informed them as they stepped out of a lift and into a busy corridor. Remus was about to ask one of the Healers which ward Draco was in when he spotted Snape pacing back and forth in front of a door with the sign MAGICAL EMERGENCIES: SPELL DAMAGE SECTOR.
Dumbledore ice blue eyes had that familiar twinkle once more, which set Harry even more at ease as he sat back to listen to this good news.
A true smile finally played on Remus’ lips as he brought his knees up to his chest and hugged them, leaning his chin on his knee. “There’s not much to be done for it. You’ve done basically all that can be done by providing me with Wolfsbane. I just have to grin and bear the rest, unfortunately.” Remus stared at Severus for a few seconds before continuing in a much softer voice. “I really am grateful for the potion, Severus...You don’t know how wonderful it is to be able to keep my mind during the full moon.”
“Listen, Dad! It really has absolutely nothing to do with sex!” At his father’s disbelieving glare, Harry growled in frustration and banged his fist on the arm of the sofa. “I’m
“We take an Oath of Silence regarding the information you’re about to tell us, and the information about the Headmaster’s health,” Hermione recited. Ron nodded his agreement, and both of their wands glowed a soft blue before fading away.
Remus stopped and crouched in front of Harry, placing a hand gently on the back of his head. “Harry, why don’t you go sit over there in a chair, not on the ground? I’ll bring you some tea back as well, alright? Severus isn’t going to do anything to you; he’s not stupid enough to try it.” Remus assured the distraught teen, who still seemed to be crying.
“But I don’t really wear that style. They’re too…Nerdy.”
The Order, well…they were getting about as much done as a cure was being found for Draco. Without their spy, crucial information on the Dark Lord was greatly lacking, and many attacks occurred before they could stop them. The death toll was rising steadily, and the Wizarding World had started to panic. The Muggles had even caught wind of the attacks by loss of their own ranks in mysterious murders and things the Prime Minister deemed as ‘natural, freak disasters’, simply because he had no idea what they really were, and he needed to tell his public
A week’s worth of Occlumency lessons and studying later, Harry was mastering being able to cook, carry on a conversation, and Occlude all at the same time. He lost concentration a few times and stopped Occluding for a couple of minutes at first, but eventually he was able to successfully cook a meal and finish his conversation with Severus all the while blocking his mind from Severus’ outside penetration.
S~S~S~S
Both Harry and Draco were rolling around on the bed, collapsed in a fit of giggles at the look on Snape’s face. They laughed even harder as the Potions Professor rolled his eyes and shoved them both playfully, a mock glare on his face.
“But whose death – ?” Ron began to ask, but Hermione cut him off, that same excited gleam in her eyes when she was on a roll taking over once more.
Severus glared at the Gryffindor as he snatched his hand away from the drawer, pointing towards Harry’s bed with a sharp jab.
“Shall I continue then, Headmaster?” Lucius asked, pretending to be unaffected by the blazing death glare he was receiving from his fellow former Death Eater. Despite the man having a few good points in his argument, Lucius
“The Headmaster is, occasionally, correct when he speaks of such things. Speaking of which, what did he want to discuss with you?” Severus asked, setting his cup of tea aside as he focused his full attention on his son, who looked suddenly very uncomfortable.
Harry frowned as he rubbed the scar a bit harder, wishing his could rub the cursed thing away for good. Hermione’s theory made entirely too much sense, and it actually explained why his and Voldemort’s mind shared such a strong connection. “Well, I guess we’ll figure that out later. Let’s go find Moony and my Dad so you can tell them what you found.”
However, once he had entered the common room, he remembered it was the middle of the night, and Hermione was bound to be asleep. He sighed in relief as he spotted a fourth year girl sitting by the fire, scribbling away in the faint light.
Harry gulped as he tried to shrug Snape’s hand of his shoulder. This was exactly what he
“I thought you quit smoking years ago,” Severus asked quietly as he sat down carefully on the old bench beside the werewolf. There was a long silence as the last of the cigarette burned into ash, the acrid smell of the smoke making Severus’ eyes water as he tried not the breathe the smoke in.
be concerned with being disrespectful when addressing
Harry shook his head to clear it as he tried to understand all of Hermione’s jumbled questions as he was hugged excruciatingly tight by his best friend.
“Such diligent students, and even during summer holidays,” the voice drawled, though it sounded weaker and more teasing than Harry had ever heard it before. He whipped around in his chair and then nearly toppled over in his haste to rush to his father’s arms.
"Not really, sir, but I do kind of understand where you're coming from. It's my fault as well; I should never have exposed myself like that. It's just, sometimes when I see people I care about in danger, I don't think about the repercussions of my actions; I just act. It's definitely a character flaw, I'll admit that. I am truly sorry, Professor; I never meant for Draco to get hurt, and I'll do everything I can to try and fix it," Harry said in earnest. He couldn't stand to feel Snape's disappointment in him for much longer, as strange as that notion was.
“He can stay
“Though I am working on a potion to make the child both biologically mine and Remus’, you would still be considered the child’s mother, and have full rights to see him or her and be a part of their life. We would not ask you to do this, and then simply shut you out of the child’s life. We thought for a long time about our choices, and thought you were the best,” the Potions Professor explained from his seat across from the witch.
Lucius’ steps paused as he turned back to look at Harry. “I know that, Potter. I said I wanted to see my son, not gain clemency.”
“Not very long, maybe an hour or so. Are you feeling ill? You look a bit pale,” Severus said as he walked closer to the bed to get a better look at Harry. The boy looked peaky and exhausted, but Severus couldn’t blame him.
Hermione was twirling her wand around, trying to focus on patrolling the corridors for errant students, but there was much too much going on in her mind. This year was proving to be the worst one she’d had at Hogwarts to date. From her first year on, she’d always been happily content being the best friend of two very different, yet very similar boys. At first she had nursed quite the soft spot for Harry, born of pity and sympathy for his situation, and infatuation with his famous status. But despite all the constant bickering with Ron, the illusion that it was a miracle they were even friends, it had always been the erratic redhead who held her delicate, yet strong heart.
Draco sighed heavily, wanting to give in to his lover’s wishes, but also feeling guilty. He would have an advantage the other members of the Order didn’t and he felt like it wasn’t fair to everyone else. However, if Harry was asking him, there was no way he could tell the Gryffindor no, knowing it would increase his anxiety if he refused.
“Whatever you want,” Severus said in a dull voice as he carried Harry over to the long counter between the two sinks that flanked the bathroom. He laid down the boy’s body, and leaned over, his body wracked with sobs once more.
“Speculations are better than no clue, I guess,” Harry said with a humourless laugh, feeling the weight of finding and destroying these Horcruxes grow heavier and heavier.
Severus nearly toppled over as the voice sounded from the shadow of a large tree just to the left of him. He stood up quickly, his wand drawn as he pointed it towards the source of the voice. Only when he saw the form of Albus Dumbledore appearing from the shadows did he lower his wand.
Severus spun around and dropped down to lift Draco up in his arms. Without a moment’s hesitation, he spun and Apparated them both straight into St. Mungo’s emergency room. “I need a Healer!” Severus shouted to no one in particular.
“You know, I think Sev would kill me if I so much as touched that watch. Maybe...maybe I could just get him a new one. I could have it engraved or something. I dunno; guess I’ll figure it out eventually.”
“Are you alright? I thought I heard shouting,” Remus said, his expression extremely concerned as he moved into the room and sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed. Upon closer inspection, the teen looked wretched, his eyes bloodshot and wide with fear, and his breath still much too quick for someone who had just been asleep.
. He trailed after Severus into the man’s room, Harry following close behind him. He tried his hardest not to flinch away, but Harry noticed his discomfort and thankfully gave him more space.
“I honestly think Professor Snape may be more in-tuned to the Headmaster’s manipulations than all the rest of us. Maybe Professor Dumbledore isn’t cut out to be our leader anymore,” Hermione suggested, looking to her two friends as if she was asking for them to agree with her, just so she didn’t stand alone in her thoughts.
Clutching his bruised and possibly broken jaw, Harry grabbed up his bag and made his way quickly out of the library, ignoring Madam Pince’s angry ranting about her precious library. Taking the steps nearly two at a time the whole way down, Harry eventually made it to the entrance to the dungeon quarters he shared with Snape. Using a non-verbal spell to enter, Harry threw his bag angrily onto the couch, gaining a classic death glare from Snape, who was reading a book beside the hearth.
. After losing his spy status, he felt he could no longer help protect you, but he was wrong; he’s been protecting you just by allowing you to stay here all summer. As little as he may show it, and he’ll probably never admit it, you gave him hope, Harry.”
“He won’t even talk to Ron and me like that anymore, not since Sirius Black died. Harry
Molly pulled her wand and cleaned all of the dried blood from Harry’s shirt and face. She didn’t even need to tell Harry she was going to heal his nose; Harry was already preparing himself for it. The small ‘crack’ of the bones going back together made Molly feel a bit woozy and Harry let out a small whimper of pain.
The lank black hair cascading over the impersonal white of the infirmary pillow billowed gently in the small breeze that was the Potions Professor’s breath. Harry continued to stare at the blank expression of unconsciousness on his father’s face, contemplating all the rollercoaster of emotions that had ripped through him in the last twelve hours.
Harry gave Ron a reproving look, but sighed in resignation. He hadn’t expected things to be perfect from the go; he’d just hoped Ron would have been a little more tactful.
“We won’t. There’s only one more, and I know exactly where it is. Dumbledore told me the best way to destroy them all at once, but if we do that, Voldemort will know. Once his last Horcrux is destroyed, he’ll finally feel it, and he’ll be mortal once more.”
S~S~S~S
Hermione simply loved essays. Especially if the essay was on something that she, Merlin forbid, didn’t already know everything about. Flipping through the pages of old and care-worn books in the Hogwarts library never ceased to amaze her. Sometimes she still feared that she would wake up and find that this was all a dream, even if it had been six years already. She had always been a very ambitious student, and that didn’t change when she received her Hogwarts letter and came to the magical school. She had researched everything she possibly could after she got all of her books for school, and her trusty copy of
.” Severus took up the two lenses that now lay on the table and sat them on top of each other. He had just gotten an idea that would greatly help the boy in the future. “
“I was just curious, really. I...I want you both to stay together, because I need you both, and I couldn’t possibly choose if the situation ever warranted it,” Harry admitted, shrugging as if it was of no great importance.
Severus watched the exchange with something akin to wonder before snapping back to reality. “Dobby, I would like you to make Harry and I a meal. Something simple, onion soup and some bread, perhaps. I’m afraid Mr. Potter’s stomach cannot handle anything more than that.”
“I feel like I was almost crushed by a giant falling stone. Oh – wait.”
Hermione frowned at his abandoned essay before pulling it towards herself and making marks and corrections on the little portion that he had managed to scribble out. “Besides, you know Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would still adopt you, even if Ron and Ginny need an attitude adjustment. Remember the owl Mrs. Weasley sent you after Ron broke your jaw?”
“In the memory Dumbledore showed Harry about Voldemort collecting mementos, Harry offhandedly mentioned something about a baby blanket that Tom was extremely protective of.”
Ron made a disgusted noise from behind Harry, his face scrunched up unpleasantly. “Do you even
Severus gave his son a wary look before meeting Remus’ eyes, silently communicating with his husband. He did not think it would be safe to take Harry to Godric’s Hollow, but how could he deny his son such a thing? “I don’t think it is safe, Harry.”
Harry finished off his breakfast and pushed his plate away as he drank down his juice. “So what’s his solution, then?”
It had originally been Ron’s idea, the tribute. Every member of the DA had been contacted and instructed to prepare for a possible attack at the Headmaster’s funeral. There would be plenty of Ministry appointed security, not to mention the entire Order, but Harry had no doubt that some brave Death Eater would try to take advantage of the huge gathering of those from the Light.
“There you are, sir. I was just about to go looking for you – ”
Harry blushed as he physically squirmed in his seat. “Yes...My super, extraordinary, fantastical power is the ability to love. Very anticlimactic, eh?” Harry said with a wry grin.
“You said you wanted me to be here for you, so damn it, I’m going to
Draco closed the door behind him, but remained standing just in front of it with his arms crossed over his chest, not returning his father’s arrogant smile. “I’ve got some news for you too. Just what the
“Then it is time. I shall call your brethren tonight. Let the Order think they’ve finally outwitted Lord Voldemort, and let them die when we prove them wrong once more.”
The Headmaster’s smile widened and the twinkle in his eyes became so bright, Harry was sure it would have lit up the entire office if they’d been sitting in the dark. “I forgive you, Harry, as some of the things you said I actually deserved. As you know, a wise old man’s mistakes are generally much larger than those of others.”
Harry sighed heavily and scrubbed at his face. He knew this was going to happen, and he still didn’t have any idea of how to appease everyone and still keep the secrets Dumbledore made him keep. “Look, Dumbledore knows that Ron and Hermione have been there to help me in the past, and he knew I would need their support to get through this. The nature of this information is the reason I can’t tell you three specifically. It’s just too dangerous for that many people to know.”
“The birth of my new reign, the place where I received my second chance...What brings you here, Dumbledore? A sacrifice for Potter?” Voldemort was circling the Headmaster slowly now, his dark robes trailing behind him, sweeping across the dead grass and dirt that made up the dilapidated graveyard.
Severus pointed his wand at the pathetic man prostrated on the floor, and with one last sneer, said, “
Severus’ eyebrows shot straight up as he looked at the boy. It was much worse than he had expected. “The End of Term feast? Harry, it’s nearly the end of July. Term ended almost two months ago. How on earth have you managed to survive without food for so long?” he asked worriedly. That was much too long to go without food, that he was absolutely sure of.
Ten minutes passed before the door to Snape’s office opened once more, though to Harry it felt like hours. He stopped in his pacing and turned towards Snape, who looked almost faintly exhausted now. Harry was almost tempted to help the man to his chair, but figured that Snape’s pride would not appreciate that. However, when Snape stepped into the candle light, Harry saw that the man was dramatically more pale than usual, and that was saying something.
Harry smiled as he tried to blink back the tears in his eyes. The soft velvet felt like a comforting weight, almost as if Sirius was there, hugging him and telling him that things would work out just fine. “Thanks, Sev. I should get dressed now...”
Harry stood up and nodded quickly, trying not to run from the office like he wanted to. “Of course, sir, I’ll tell him. See you, then.” Harry began to back up, keeping his eyes trained on Dumbledore in case a wand was pulled.
“Perhaps we should discuss Horcruxes and come back to this topic later after we’ve all had some more time to think. There’s got to be a solution,” said Remus, feeling a sense of dread grip his heart. If Harry
“I’m not; I’m just making sure I explore all my options before I make up my mind. This is a really important decision; I don’t want to mess things up,” said Harry, feeling irritated by Hermione’s accusation and the corrections to his Charms essay. “I did say that jinxes and counter-curses are two separate things!”
“This is all my fault. They would still be alive if I hadn’t have gone,” Harry choked out, threading his fingers through his hair and shaking his head in disbelief. Two Hogwarts students were dead, all because of him. He was like the plague; death seemed to follow in his wake.
came to be in power is beyond me,” Hermione huffed as she refolded the
“Thank you, Harry, for what you did for Draco. Without you he’d still be comatose, amnesia or not. I’m sure in time he’ll come to appreciate your help just as much as I do.”
Molly sniffled as she pulled Harry into a tight, tearful hug, mumbling her thanks and love all the while. She was obviously overwhelmed, so Harry moved on to the Weasley siblings, first hugging Ginny, then pausing as he and Ron made eye contact for the first time since Harry had first been informed of Arthur’s illness.
“Don’t!
“Just lay back and relax, Harry. We’ll do the rest, alright? You’re safe,” Remus said quietly as he gently placed the teen onto the sofa. Draco was instantly at his side, kneeling beside the sofa as he took Harry’s hand into his own.
Harry walked over to a secluded corner of the common room, avoiding the whispering and pointing that broke out upon his entrance to the common room he hadn’t been in since school had started. He settled himself into in armchair, waiting for Hermione to do the same. “Well, I’m not sure if we’re technically dating, because neither one of us asked the other out. It feels like dating, and we’ve actually kissed and stuff. In fact our first kiss was today...” Harry rambled, heightening Hermione’s curiosity to the point of her pulling her wand and aiming it square in his face.
Remus swallowed past the lump forming in his throat and leaned down, pressing his lips firmly to Severus’, wrapping an arm around the man as he deepened the kiss. “I love you too, Severus. Please don’t ever leave me like that again.”
“So you can’t tell me or Sev and Remus because you think we’re going to use this information to what, become the next Dark Lord?” Draco asked in a scathing tone, his arms crossed tightly over his chest.
“Well, there’s been very little research done on Dementors because of the affect they have on people. The only thorough research I’ve seen was done by a vampire by the name of Claudius Bofinkle. A vampire’s soul can only be captured by its reflection in a mirror, essentially trapping it. Dementors do not affect vampires.  There are very few non-humans that cannot feel the despair caused by Dementors. Lethifolds are another example, but their lack of ability to communicate renders them unable to do something like research,” Remus answered, not sure if Hermione had intended to ask him or Severus, as they were both ‘Professor’.
“Lead the way; I’ll be there with you,” Severus said firmly, completely filled with rage. How could Lucius do something like this to his own son, to Severus’ son? He was sick to death of blood superiority and all of the nonsense that came with.
“But Voldemort killed Dumbledore. Wouldn’t that make him…Oh,
working! What are we missing here?” Remus asked, clenching his wand in his fist as he the urge to punch the wall grew stronger and stronger. Now tearing the room to pieces seemed like a fantastic idea after all.
forgive him.
Dumbledore knew this was his last chance to lead the creature down the wrong path, to secure Harry’s chance of finding and destroying all of the Horcruxes. Quickly searching his weakening and pain-filled mind, the Headmaster found the answer at last.
“I’m not avoiding anything, Hermione. I just wanted to make sure we didn’t get banned from the library in case your reaction wasn’t a good one,” Harry explained as they approached the portrait hole. “I don’t know the password anymore.”
Harry took a deep breath, preparing to launch into the story so he wouldn’t have to keep repeating himself. “From what I understand, this started out as a mission from Voldemort for Blaise Zabini, Greyback, and Bellatrix. Blaise turned my glasses into a portkey that would take me to the forest, but he messed the charm up, causing me to dream about the details of the mission. Lucius heard about this mission, and knowing that I was close to Draco and might be able to get him in to talk to him, he confunded Greyback and Bellatrix and modified their memories.
while my legs remember how to be legs again, but I
“So Voldemort still isn’t aware that we know about his Horcruxes? That’s got to be an advantage,” Ron pointed out.
Severus felt distinctly wrong-footed as he watched Harry walk quickly down the corridor, then disappear around the corner. He turned to ask Draco what exactly had happened, but the words were stuck in his throat as he saw the Slytherin’s head bowed, tears sliding down his pale cheeks.
“You cannot lie under Veritaserum, but you can certainly evade the truth. My dad’s a Slytherin; he’s very good at doing just that. If you ask the right questions in the right way, however, it will be nearly impossible not to give a completely honest and open answer. They’re only suggestions; who knows if they’ll actually be used,” Draco said with a shrug, dipping his eagle feather quill into his ink pot as he started in on the next question.
The wall shook with what appeared to be laughter, refusing to expose the entrance to the Slytherin common room. Pansy Parkinson growled under her breath and kicked at the wall, immediately grabbing her toe as a sharp pain shot through it. She was cursing a blue streak when the Slytherin Head of House came down the corridor.
“Now, Severus, you’re being unreasonable.”
feelings towards Black, it’s about yours. As much as I didn’t like the man, I can understand that you loved him, and losing him hurt more than you could ever explain. I would never begrudge you your grief, Remus, no matter my feelings towards the person you are grieving for.
S~S~S~S
“I’m sure the Headmaster has just been busy, Harry. All of the Professors have been. He’ll probably want to speak to you as soon as we’re all safely in the castle once more,” Hermione tried to reassure her best friend as she, Ron, Harry and Draco sat around a table in the makeshift study hall to finish up the last of their projects before time was up. Hermione of course already had hers finished a week ago, but she was assisting the boys as best she could.
Harry shook himself out of his reverie, not wanting to ruin Draco’s excitement about finally leaving the wretched hospital wing. “What? Oh, nothing. Sorry, I got a little lost in my head there.”
Severus sent an apologetic looks towards his husband before he spoke up. It was obvious they had spoken about all of this before, and if Severus was slightly disapproving, Remus was even more so. “There is one such Death Eater who only stays by the Dark Lord’s side out of fear. He’s not strictly Inner-Circle, but he’s often close to the Dark Lord. We also have an advantage over him; a Life Debt.”
Severus smiled lightly through his tears as he rubbed small circles on Harry’s back.
Ron was pale and seemed to be a bit shaken as he pat Harry nervously on the arm. “That was pretty stupid, mate. I can’t believe Malfoy took all those spells for you...”
“Yeah, friends. We’ve known each other since before we could even walk or talk. How could we not be friends?” Draco said incredulously, ignoring the way Harry glared at him, then Pansy, then back at him again.
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling his skin crawl at Harry’s tone. It reminded him
“You must be exhausted, Severus. Come on, you need your bed. Harry’s fine here; quite dead asleep, actually.”
“Trust me, I don’t,” Severus said with a slight smirk as he nodded his head towards Harry to encourage Draco.
Harry frowned, pulling Draco off to the side so as not to be overheard by anyone. “Honestly, Draco, she was just saying bye. She didn’t mean anything by the kiss on the cheek. She’s my friend, and much older than us, I should like to point out.”
The dizzying trip up the ever-turning staircase was worth it as they stepped out onto the ramparts of the castle, a cool breeze blowing their hair around as they looked out over the expansive grounds. Out in the distance, gray storm clouds were rolling steadily in, promising a large thunder storm when they reached the castle. Harry had eyes only for Draco, however, who had released his hand and walked over to the ledge, leaning over it slightly as he took a deep breath of the cool air. When he turned back around to face Harry he wasn’t smiling, but he looked more at peace than Harry had seen him in months.
creature...I promise you, Draco, I will never return to Him again,” Lucius said in a harsh whisper.
“I never said you did not. I merely said that such emotional baggage could prove detrimental to our efforts of getting the information that we need from Lucius. Do you disagree?” the Headmaster asked, sounding genuinely curious.
Harry sighed but stood up and followed Snape into the living room. After being handed a large black tome and practically forced to sit down, Harry cracked open the book and started to read. Legilimency was interesting, but it seemed even more complicated than Occlumency. The theory alone made Harry’s head spin, and he had to stop reading before his headache became worse. He rubbed at his temples, squeezing his eyes shut to ward off the migraine that was coming. He nearly jumped out of his seat when he opened his eyes and saw a potion vile being held out to him by Snape.
“I’m sorry I punched you.”
“The Sword of Gryffindor, for one thing. Quite a few books and trunks full of various things. Albus’ box of memories was written in as well. The pensieve was left to you, however,” the Headmistress said, looking pointedly at the Potions Master.
Severus turned to go back to the living room, but saw that the sound of the floo had awoken Harry. “Lupin just left. He said he’s sorry he left without saying goodbye,” Severus said, delivering the message as Remus had asked him to.
“From what I’ve read, the stone must be held in the palm of your hand and turned over three times while you concentrate as hard as you can on the person you wish to call forward. Be careful; if you concentrate on more than one person, you run the risk of bringing forth multiple echoes, and I don’t believe that would be wise. Are you ready, Remus, Harry?” Severus asked as he carefully unfolded the handkerchief and pushed it closer to Remus. He took special care not to touch the stone with his bare skin, as there was a strong belief that merely touching the stone could call upon echoes.
“There isn’t anything wrong with that, I agree, Harry. I just think you should both be careful. He may seem perfectly normal now, but he’s still healing, he’s still slowly getting his memories back. I’d say not to devote yourself to him because things could change really fast, but I fear it’s much too late for that. The only thing you can do now is just be there for him, even if it starts to get a bit rough as his memory comes back,” said Hermione, offering Harry a warm smile.
Harry looked over to Severus, who caught his eye and nodded, Remus shrugging from beside his lover. If it was ok with the two Professors, it was fine with Harry. He smiled at his parents and turned back to Dumbledore. “That sounds fine to us, Professor.”
“Please, don’t stop studying on our account. In fact, I do believe you have some exams to study for before the week is out? One more week, that is all, Harry. Christmas break will be here soon,” Severus said with a soft smile as Harry blushed and cracked open his book again. A deep frown traced the teen’s lips as he looked back up at the Potions Professor.
Remus bit his lip in thought as he tried to cast his mind that far back into his past. It only took a moment for realization to hit. “Abby Smithson? The one who people always thought was Lily’s evil twin? I didn’t realize you’d been friends with her back then,” Remus reminisced with a small chuckle. Abby had actually been a very kind girl, but being a Slytherin and looking strikingly similar to Lily, she was always dubbed ‘the evil twin’.
“Look, I think Remus is right. I’m sure Dumbledore asked Lucius everything even you could think of, and he had Draco’s huge list of suggested questions as well. Maybe if you just go look in the Pensieve, you’ll find that all your questions have already been answered.”
The pain slowly began to ebb away, and then Harry heard it – the cacophonous sound of dozens, maybe even hundreds, of Death Eaters apparating into the Little Hangleton graveyard. He felt his heart begin to race and his hands were shaking. He wasn’t ready for this, what had he been thinking?
Harry had only made it halfway into the Entrance Hall when he felt a hand grasp his shoulder. He expected it to be his father or Remus, and so was pleasantly surprised to see Draco peering at him over his shoulder.
“I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to cry all over you. It’s just...I can’t believe it’s finally real. I have a father now...I have a
Molly was sharing stories about her own pregnancies, much to all of her children’s chagrin, and Tonks’ amusement as Molly told the story of how she had wished Charlie was a girl so much, she used to dress him in dresses as a little boy.
The blonde gathered Harry close, leaving a gentle kiss behind Harry’s ear. It was so soft and caring, so much emotion in one little innocent kiss. “I love you too, Harry. More than anything.”
“But that’s impossible! It says in
Draco’s slight smile split into a smirk as he pulled the Slytherin girl into a tight hug. They didn’t separate until a very loud and obviously annoyed clearing of a throat interrupted their tender moment. Draco blushed apologetically as he pulled away from Pansy and saw Harry with his arms crossed over his chest, glaring at the two Slytherins with fire in his eyes.
Severus smiled at his son in adoration. It was cute, seeing the boy so embarrassed over talking about such things as sex. His amusement was short-lived as he realised that talk he and Remus had been discussing would need to happen very soon indeed, especially now that the boys were sharing a room. And since Severus now knew they hadn’t yet crossed that line, it was the perfect time to warn them about the consequences and try to convince them to wait.
“My birthday is on January ninth. Yours is July thirty-first, of course. I had no idea you were fond of the colour green, or that you knew I liked blue. I won’t even ask how you knew my favourite food, as I’m sure it was either by observation, or Remus or Molly informed you. I think your assumption is indeed safe when it comes to my favourite hobby, and I did figure as much about yours. I think, perhaps that that is all the information we need for now. Whatever is asked of us, we will simply have to answer on the fly. Are you quite ready? The Casewitch will be here in another quarter hour.”
Molly and her six children stood by the back door of the Burrow, waiting for the mourners to arrive and greeting them solemnly as the group grew larger. It was a private funeral, by invitation only – hence the special portkeys. What with Arthur’s recent promotion, many people had contacted the Weasleys about funeral arrangements, but only those closest to the family and the entire Department of Magical Law Enforcement were allowed.
Harry’s non sequitur was met with a slightly wary silence as Severus stood and offered his son a hand up. He wasn’t sure taking Harry to see the crumbled remains of the cottage was such a good idea if seeing the graves of his parents had upset him so greatly.
Harry sighed as he took the desk chair, deciding that he shouldn’t be too close to either of the two teens at the moment. This wasn’t how he imagined Ron would find out, but there was no way around it now.
Harry cocked an eyebrow at the Slytherin, finding it hard to believe that Draco had agreed to this without knowing why he needed Occlumency. “Snape didn’t tell you?”
Remus calmed down as he frowned at the brooding man across from him. Remus reached across the table and grasped one of Severus’ still crossed arms gently. “That’s not what I meant at all, Severus. It was not your fault either; you had no way of knowing. Like I told Harry last night – no one person is really at fault for any of it, but the person who should hold the blame is Peter Pettigrew; not you, not Harry, not anyone else.”
That was the crack that shattered Harry’s fragile control. “Oh, of course it’s for my protection! You couldn’t possibly risk the chance of your weapon being taken out of the battle before it’s time to finally face the bastard for the last time!”
After nearly a minute with no response, Severus figured that Harry had fallen asleep with a candle still lit. Not wanting to wake up to a burnt down castle, he opened the door to snuff out the candle as quickly and quietly as he could.
was supporting the order to remove Fudge from his post, which was shocking to anyone who had read the paper in the last three years; everyone knew the Editor-In-Chief of the
Harry kissed Draco on the cheek once more, looking up as Dobby carried in a tray of food and sat it down on the bedside table for Harry. “I think it’s a wonderful idea, Draco. But I also think you should come eat with me.”
“I just thought that he wouldn’t have left such an important detail out. He gave me so much information about possible Horcruxes and Tom Riddle’s life, but he didn’t tell me what the hell to do with these things. It just doesn’t make sense to me. If the greatest Wizard of his age couldn’t even figure it out, how am I supposed to? I can’t do this…”
As the green and red spell light hit in midair, Voldemort suddenly clutched at his neck, gasping as he fell to his knees. Sirius was standing there, glowing against the dark backdrop of the graveyard with the empty syringe clutched in his hand.
in the castle, which irked him even more, if he was quite honest. He didn’t trust the man as far as he could throw him, and he was frankly bewildered as to why Dumbledore and Kingsley would agree to such a heinous plan. Perhaps it was because he had known the elder Malfoy for so much longer, but Severus doubted the Headmaster and Minister knew exactly what they were getting themselves into, good opportunity for information or not. Severus sighed heavily as he realized that, if it weren’t for his blown cover as a spy, the Order wouldn’t be quite so desperate for information. It was with a heavy hand that he knocked on the Headmaster’s door.
That night, Harry took a dose of Dreamless Sleep before bed like instructed. The potion was not tampered with, and it could be trusted one hundred percent, as Severus had made it with his own two hands. That night, Harry had the dream
“Maybe for just a minute or two?” Harry asked as he followed his father through the winding headstones and statues that marked the places where generations of the town’s people slept forevermore.
With a loud pop, the ragged little house elf with huge ears and great tennis-ball eyes appeared in the dungeon sitting room, beaming as he caught sight of Harry.
“Yes you can. There is no choice. Be brave, my son. I am right here with you,” Severus said in a harsh whisper. With great reluctance, he released his hold on Harry’s arm and scanned around the chaos that was beginning to ensue. It was dark, and the only thing that could really be seen were spells reflecting off of Death Eater masks, including his own that he had worn as a diversion tactic.
“You look very nice, Harry. We’ll eat breakfast down here this morning so we can discuss a few things that might come up in the interview.” Severus turned back to Remus, who was smiling proudly at Harry, his eyes bright. “I’ll see you later tonight, I’m sure.”
human, Harry, I do make mistakes. As for not being used to having somebody care...Well, plenty of people care for you, so that’s not true. I think what you mean to say is that you’re not used to having a parental figure in your life. I understand, Harry, I do. I’ll try to ease up a bit on you.”
“I saw it during an Occlumency lesson, but he made me promise –
Severus nodded slowly, knowing exactly how hard it was to trust adults as an abused child. “I do understand. So, what exactly does this promise include?” Severus asked, caving already to the idea.
Remus walked around the side of the Transfigured bed and gently shook Severus’ shoulder. “Severus…Severus, wake up!”
“I’m not sure if the orphanage is there anymore or not, but it’s worth some investigation, isn’t it? We’ve got no other leads, and this has a death associated with it that would be perfect for a Horcrux. Think about it; Tom Riddle despised his Muggle heritage, and the orphanage would only stand as a reminder to him. He’d want some sort of revenge, and I’m sure he was not fond of the Headmistress, as she was most likely not fond of him either,” said Hermione with a shrug.
“No, actually, you won’t. I…I’m not staying in Gryffindor Tower this year,” Harry said reluctantly, having successfully avoided the topic all night until then.
“The clothes it is, then!” Harry chuckled. He whirled around as the floo roared into life, the emerald green flames admitting first Arthur Weasley, and then his wife Molly, who he caught from tripping over the edge of the hearth in a graceful and quick move.
S~S~S~S
After everything was hashed out and discussed, the Prefects took their large piles of parchment and filed out of the staff room. The only two people left were Professor McGonagall and Draco, who waved his wand to make sure the door was properly closed behind the last Prefect.
“What would I do without you, Harry?” Severus sighed as he pulled his son close and wrapped him in a tight embrace. He knew he’d be nothing and nowhere without the teen who clung tightly to him, soaking up the comfort from the hug like an extremely dry sponge.
P.S. Remus’ French phrase: “I love you my son. I am so proud of you.”
The guests for Harry’s party started to arrive at noon, though there weren’t very many, which Harry was glad for. Charlie and Tonks arrived together, looking quite comfortable together, while Bill and Fleur took a little bit of the focus off of Harry himself and onto them as Fleur flashed around her gorgeous new engagement ring. Molly had burst into tears of happiness.
S~S~S~S
“I really didn’t pay enough attention in Divination,” Harry said with a frown, accepting the sphere back from Draco and placing it carefully on the stand.
Severus, on the other hand, found it a bit harder to get to sleep. He was exhausted, but there was so much swimming around in his mind that he had a hard time putting his thoughts to rest long enough to fall asleep.
“Research. We need to make sure we always stay one step ahead of You-Know-Who, and that means making sure we know our stuff better than he does,” Tonks suggested from her seat beside Charlie.
“I learned to be an Animagus to accompany Remus in his werewolf form during the full moon when we attended Hogwarts. Mostly my form was useful because I was small enough to dodge the branches of the Whomping Willow and press the knot in the centre to allow James and Sirius into the tunnel that led to the Shrieking Shack where Remus would transform.”
“Come in.”
Severus put on his best annoyed scowl and sniffed distastefully. “I suppose if it is that urgent, Ms. Granger. What is it you would like to discuss? No matter how many times you look at me with those sad little eyes, I will not change your essay grade from an A to an E; it just wasn’t good enough.”
“You were upset, love. I’m sure Harry will understand that we’re all upset right now, but you also need to try to understand the pressure he was under. The situation felt hopeless even to me; imagine how Harry felt. I’m upset too, but we mustn’t take out our emotions on each other. I think you need time to cool off. I sent Hermione and Ron to check on Harry, but I should go check on him myself.”
They both gasped in surprise as a loud explosion rent the air above them. Harry was glad for the vaulted ceilings as he watched Fred and George’s wet-start fireworks light up the room and reflect colourful patterns on Draco’s alabaster skin.
“With a Basilisk fang. I stabbed it…
Ron and Hermione ran over to where Harry stood, still leaning heavily against Remus, tears still streaming down his cheeks.
Harry nodded slowly, feeling relieved that Severus’ anger seemed to dim after he found out what had happened. “Yes sir, I understand. Can I – ”
, do you understand me?” Severus asked again, this time emphasizing the words heavily as he stared straight into Harry’s worried emerald eyes.
“Sure, that’d be nice,” Harry said with a sad smile, feeling his heart ache as he saw the black, decaying hand struggle to grip the cup properly.
Harry blinked rapidly and looked up the concerned look on Draco’s face and promptly broke down in tears. “I’m so sorry, Draco. I’ve been so horrible to you. I’m sorry!”
“No, thank you, Harry,” Severus said, his face still turned away. He waited until Harry had disappeared into the kitchen before looking back at Remus, who was frowning sympathetically at him. “I have always considered Draco to be like a son to me. His father is a vile piece of work, and Draco has always come to me when seeking help or just an escape from Lucius and Narcissa,” Severus stopped to clear his throat, averting his gaze down to his lap before speaking again. “I had almost accepted the fact that I would never see my godson again, so you will forgive me if I’m just a little bit over-dramatic right now. I want my son back,” Severus whispered, glancing back up at Remus, who had begun to comfortingly rub his leg.
“I...Draco, I’m not supposed to talk about your parents; I’ve told you that before. I think maybe you should ask Severus about that dream,” Harry said, feeling extremely guilty as Draco frowned at him, a mixed look of anger and suspicion on the blonde’s face.
“You and Bill definitely have the upper-hand there, so you can both head that group. Any other suggestions?” the Headmistress asked, looking around the table. She wasn’t exactly surprised when Percy, one of their new members, raised his hand with his chin raised.
” Draco moved his wand in a complicated arch and slashing movement that Harry had sworn he’d seen before, but couldn’t remember what it did. He figured it out when his tidal wave of water turned into a massive wall of boiling water, and came flying back at him.
“Where the
Hermione moved away from the door, feeling a heavy sinking in her stomach. She slipped her wand back into her robes as she leaned against the wall beside the doors to the infirmary. So that’s why Harry was always so tired these days; he spent his nights in the hospital wing talking to Draco. It was really very obvious; she should have realized it sooner. But hearing Harry talk like that, like Draco could hear him, like he was awake and there with him...it grabbed at Hermione’s heart and squeezed ruthlessly as she felt even more torn between her best friends. Should she try more to help Harry with waking Draco up, or should she support her boyfriend’s stubbornness and write Harry off as well? The right choice was obvious, but that didn’t make it any easier to decide.
was not told, nor summoned to any meetings recently by the Dark Lord. Some speculation as to my spy disguise becoming evident to the Dark Lord has been brought up,” Severus answered stiffly, dreading what he knew he’d have to tell Harry eventually, soon.
Remus smiled faintly as he reached out and took the bottle Severus was holding out to him. He looked down at the precious potion that would surely save him from a most horrible transformation in two days. “Thank you, Severus. You’re right; I couldn’t find it anywhere else. I feared this transformation might have been my last. I’m too old and fragile for full transformations after growing dependant on Wolfsbane, especially after what I’ve been through this past week,” Remus said softly as he slipped the potion into his inside coat pocket.
Harry glared at the Potions Master slightly, but followed that man into the Great Hall anyways. When he sat down at the Gryffindor table and retold his story to Ron and Hermione, they both looked properly horrified, Ron’s mouthful of food on full display as he gaped, and Hermione’s hand firmly over her mouth.
“He has, and he’s pretty serious about it. It gives me warm and fuzzy feelings to know that people are still looking out for me in the Auror department. See you guys later.” With that, Tonks flooed back to the Ministry, leaving behind a slightly confused, but all together relieved group.
“I’m not so sure myself...” Harry muttered as he continued to read through Hermione’s extremely detailed and complicated notes. He was starting to get really frustrated, not understanding in the least what any of this meant. Just as he was about to blow up and start ranting about his failings in magical theory, Remus walked up to their table. Snape’s quill paused abruptly in its scribbling.
Hermione had been wiping at her tearing eyes all day, and Ron was using the opportunity to comfort her as much as he could. It seemed their feud had finally ended, and the relationship was back on. Harry was happy for them, despite his lingering sense of betrayal due to Ron’s abandonment. It would take much longer than a few months for him to forgive the redhead completely.
“Oh, ew! I’ve been snogging my brother!” Harry exclaimed exasperatedly as Draco chuckled.
Lucius stood, shocked that his son was indeed completely serious about his relationship with The-Boy-Who-Lived. If it was so important that his son would give up literally
Draco shook his head and led Harry over to the sofa, pulling him down to sit beside him. “I went to the hospital wing the day after it happened. I had heard the rumours but I didn’t really believe them…not until I saw her. She was asleep, but I sat there with her for something like half an hour and apologized.”
Severus’ eyes slammed shut as he pinched the bridge of his nose, praying for patience from someone –
“No, Remus, I mean I’m sorry for being such an idiot. I should never have tried to hide our relationship from the Ministry. It’s not fair to you at all, and Harry was completely right to be upset with me about it. Regardless if you understood why I thought I needed to do it, it wasn’t right. You shouldn’t have to be my dirty little secret. I love you, and I want the world to know it.”
The dungeon quarters were strangely quiet for the number of people who were there. Harry sat down his bags of shopping as he realized Hermione had been crying, her face buried in Remus’ shoulder, Severus sitting on the other side of the werewolf, rubbing his back slowly. He felt his heart sink as he figured it all out on his own.
“No idea, Poppy. Can you please firecall Healer Smithson and tell her this is an emergency?”
“I don’t want to interrupt this,” Severus whispered to his husband as they watched the young couple chuckling on the sofa, wrapped firmly around each other. “I don’t want to take those smiles away.”
“Bet you for it?” Emmeline asked, a twinkle in her eyes that caused Dedalus to laugh.
S~S~S~S
“What is it with you and impatient owls, eh? They just can’t wait until morning,” Remus said with a chuckle, brushing his hand across Severus’ cheek.
“Healer Smithson says giving you too much information at once would be much too overwhelming for you. You will find out eventually, but we can’t flood you with too much right now. Trust me, Draco,” Severus said quietly, clutching Draco’s shoulder.
Harry gave the password to the portrait protecting Draco’s room and slipped inside. He moved over to the bed, smiling at the form of his sleeping boyfriend, even through his worry about what the letter contained. He looked so calm and peaceful; he hated to have to wake him up. He reached out and gently shook the blonde’s shoulder.
news, Harry,” Hermione said, her expression quite frightened, which only served to scare Harry even more, and Ron gape so much that partially chewed food started to fall
It was another ten minutes before Harry came back into the dungeon quarters, his hair a bit more messy than it was when he left. His blush and small smile were enough to make Hermione giggle until her eyes watered. He flopped down on the sofa beside Hermione, laughing when she rolled her eyes at him.
The immense relief that Harry felt was almost palpable, and before Harry could respond in kind, Hermione had launched herself at Ron, hugging him so tight he could hardly breathe. After she released him, he didn’t have much time to catch his breath before she was kissing him heartily on the lips, making most of the witnesses blush even deeper than Ron was himself. Once they separated, Harry had already said goodbye to the remaining Weasleys and was waiting with Remus by the floo.
As they set up their cauldrons and set out their ingredients, Draco leaned over to whisper to Harry.
“Your guess is as good mine, Severus. Perhaps with his passing, Harry will be more willing to share?” The Headmistress stood from her seat, setting her empty glass aside and nodding her thanks to the Potions Professor.
Before Harry could protest her apology, Snape stepped forward and pulled a potion out of his pocket, handing it to Hermione. “You are not the one who should be apologizing for that foolish boy’s actions, Ms. Granger. The minute you disassociated yourself from the imbecile, you stopped being responsible for his reprehensible actions. Take this, it will help you sleep,” Severus paused as the girl meant to protest, but he held up a hand to cut her off. “No – no more research until you’ve gotten some rest. Harry and I will look at this book while you’re resting. We won’t act on anything without you, however, so rest assured.”
Just as they were lifting Hermione to take her into the house, Remus apparated just in front of them, holding a body so covered in blood, they had no idea who it even was, but they had an idea.
“No, not selfish, Severus; just protective, and perhaps a tad bit possessive. I understand, I do, but I am also glad that I’ve finally been included,” Remus admitted, his smile widening as Severus leaned over and kissed him gently on the lips.
Harry moved all the way into the room, closing the door carefully behind him. “Draco’s talking and moaning in his sleep. It sounds like he’s having a nightmare, but he took Dreamless Sleep before he went to bed. I don’t get how that’s possible,” Harry explained in a rough whisper.
“Harry, why don’t we just try to summon it?” Hermione asked after checking everywhere twice, and even a third time.
The Room of Requirement looked much more like the Gryffindor common room this time, and Harry knew it was because Draco would be there. He was still a little embarrassed that the place he seemed to find the most comfort in was an almost exact replica of the Slytherin’s personal quarters.
“Headmaster Dumbledore has arranged a plan to evacuate everyone from the castle by Monday morning. However, no one is being sent home early. Your classes will be on a hiatus for a month, the time in which this process will take, but each teacher will assign a special project for you to work on during that time. As for living space...”
Lucius sat beside his son, wrapping an arm around the boy’s shoulder and pulling him closer. “I did not believe that you were mature enough to make such a decision, or to have such deep feelings for someone else, especially another young man. I thought that perhaps the threat of losing your wealth and name would make you realize that your feelings were just youthful lust, but I have been proven wrong. I know you well enough to know that if you’re willing to give everything up, then you must love Potter more than I could ever have imagined.”
. Now remove yourselves from my sight before I change my mind about expelling all three of you!” Severus snapped, pointing his students towards the exit with a glare to melt metal.
Draco let out a half sigh, half sob as Harry pulled him close and planted warm, wet kisses all over his face, finally ending with a rather forceful, passionate kiss to his trembling lips. His bones all seemed to turn to jelly and he slumped against Harry’s wonderfully solid chest, happier than ever to have the Gryffindor holding him up, being his anchor and his rock.
“That is
Severus nodded once in acceptance before conjuring two cups of tea and some biscuits. “I have a favour to ask you. Before I tell you what it is I require of you, let me remind you of a few very important things. I have not been loyal to the Dark Lord for many long years now, nor will I ever be again. I no longer support his ideas, and I have learned from my mistakes. Your father has been in Azkaban now for nearly three months, and the Dark Lord has no intentions for releasing him. He is being punished for his failure at the Ministry. You mother was murdered under the Dark Lord’s command by your Aunt while he watched. You were meant to be killed as well, but the Dark Lord made the lucky mistake of letting Bellatrix have you as a pet. In the Dark Lord’s eyes, even Purebloods are expendable, as long as it helps him succeed. You are essentially an orphan now, under my care as my legal charge. For all intents and purposes, you are my son now, and I have legal rights over you. I care about you and will do everything in my power to keep you safe in this war.” Severus paused to take a long drink of his tea, fully aware of the emotions flickering across Draco’s pale face.
That same look of disdain crossed Draco’s face as he angrily ate his breakfast. “I said he’s
“Were you planning on ever telling me, or did you just decide you had no other choice because you’re dying?” Harry asked, knowing that he was being perhaps a little crass, but not really caring anymore. He’d had enough of being kept in the dark already.
“Prat.”
History of Magic- Dreadful
Draco was clinging to his robes, crying into the soft fabric as his entire body trembled. Not knowing what to do, Severus allowed his arms to wrap around the Slytherin, rubbing small circles on his pyjama clad back.
“I’m really sorry about your dad, Ron,” Harry said quietly, knowing the rest of the group was listening and waiting to see what would happen.
“That being said, I have done enough research on my own, and forgive me for saying so, but I am quite clever enough, and yet I have not found a solution to this problem. Together, you and I make a very formidable compendium of information on the Dark Arts and Defence of, and yet nothing readily comes to mind. I apologize, Severus, but I must ask that you not go in search of the solution on your own, only to get sucked into it, and forget the rest of your duties. This is not your burden to bear,” said Albus, his blue gaze intense, and yet free of that maddening twinkle that Severus so liked to pretend that he despised.
“Wotcher, Harry. You gave us a bit of a fright,” said Tonks from the foot of Harry’s bed. She winked at him as he sent her a tired smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Maybe so, but shouldn’t he have been here helping? What if something really bad had happened; what if Dad had died?” Harry asked in a harsh voice, forgetting his essay for a second to give in to his anger at the Headmaster.
Mad-Eye Moody showed up two days later to check in with the Order and agreed to Harry’s request to try to locate a boggart within Grimmauld Place. Surprisingly enough, he didn’t ask too many questions, which Harry was glad for since he couldn’t answer them even if he had asked them.
Harry enjoyed seeing the stricken looks on Zabini’s and Nott’s faces as he waved to his step-father and left the classroom, meeting up with Draco, Ron and Hermione in the hallway.
I know what hopelessness feels like; I know how bleak things can seem when you’re going through a rough time. But Harry, how many times have we told you that we’re here for you, that you’re not alone? Despite your doubts about finding a way to remove the Horcrux, you didn’t give it much of a chance. If you were feeling down, you should have come to one of us to at least talk to us. What do we need to do to prove that you can trust is infallibly?”
“I have to go, Dad. I can’t...” Harry wasn’t sure what he couldn’t do, and he didn’t want to hurt Draco by saying he couldn’t stand to be near the blonde for another second, so he just left it hanging there. He was beyond relieved when his father gave him a knowing look and nodded, giving him permission to flee.
There was one gift left, and that was the one from his parents. He unwrapped the slightly heavy box and opened the lid, surprised to see that he did not receive the traditional and expected wrist watch, but a beautiful silver pocket watch inlaid with emeralds and his initials carved into the inside of the door;
Harry grinned at his father and leaned his head on the older man’s shoulder. “You keep telling yourself that,” he teased, glad to hear the Potions Master chuckle beside him.
Myrtle looked up at Draco and sighed dramatically, her pout taking over once more. “I think Tom was the last person I saw before I died. I always wondered why he never tried to save me...then again; I wasn’t really worth saving after all.”
Severus fingered the small charm dangling off a usually hidden silver bracelet. He always wore it, yes, but he never let anyone else see it. It was old and dented, the fake silver chipped and worn in many placed around the links and on the round charm. The letters ‘L.E.’ were engraved on the small charm in elaborate script and were faded into the dull metal. Nearly seventeen years, that was how long ago this bracelet was given to him. Ten years, that’s how long ago he had retrieved the matching bracelet with the letters ‘S.S.’ engraved on the charm from the smoldering wreckage of what was once a cozy little cottage in the quiet wizarding village of Godric’s Hallow. He’d risked great punishment by entering the house after the deaths of James and Lily Potter, but he couldn’t just leave the bracelet there. It should be with Lily, but alas, she was long gone now…
Severus released the Gryffindor’s shoulder and was about to follow him in when Harry stopped him this time.
A low growl emitted from Severus as he glared a hole through Tonks. “That ‘wretch’ is my godson,
“Good, because I’ll never stop kissing you,” replied Harry, feeling Draco’s chest rumble in a laugh even as he cut the sound off using his mouth once more.
it? Every time we tried to get him to research a way, he’d lead us back into looking up a way to destroy the Horcruxes. He’d had it all planned!” Hermione wailed, her panic rising once more. Ron hugged her tighter and felt the Defence Professor’s other arm wrap around them both.
“Professor Lupin? What in Merlin’s name is going on? Severus woke me up half an hour ago and asked me if I’d seen Harry. It’s past three in the morning, why would I have seen anyone, let alone Harry?” Draco asked with an incredulous expression as Remus led him into the Potions Master’s main quarters.
“Oh, and what did Mr. Weasley say about Professor Lupin that you would deem so Slytherin?” Severus asked, not really caring, but needing the excuse for the points he was about to take.
“Sorry to barge in. I guess I should have knocked...” Draco said uncertainly as he stood there behind Harry instead of taking the empty seat beside him.
“I’ll talk to him, but I still dunno if it’s a good idea. You know he never really approved of it before,” Harry said with a sceptical look on his face. He watched as his father swept into the Great Hall, Remus just behind him. The whispering and quiet talking ceased almost immediately. He grinned; his dad sure did have quite the presence about him.
“Draco, calm down or I’ll be forced to stun you. Look, we’re all upset and obviously need to work things out with Harry, but you need to relax before you give yourself a coronary,” Severus insisted, surprised by how strong his godson was as he held him back from doing Harry anymore damage.
WARNING: Graphic violence, character death.
Dumbledore smiled as he stood up and clapped Harry gently on the shoulder. “Of course, Harry, my boy. I will see to that as soon as possible. Ah, one more thing; almost all of your belongings were destroyed in the blast. I believe Professor Snape has been making his clothes smaller for you to wear?”
Severus stood with the scroll clutched in his hand, having already gotten dressed when he awoke nearly an hour previous. He felt a squirming feeling in his stomach as the werewolf stripped off his night clothes right in front of him and pulled on a dressing gown before entering the bathroom for a shower. Blinking away that scene, Severus entered the sitting room to find both teens still sleeping soundly.
Severus checked for curses and any kind of tampering of the wand anyways, not trusting even his own student, and even less just for that reason. When it all came back negative for tampering, Severus handed the wand over to Harry, who sighed in relief.
“I wouldn’t have told a soul aMbout it if it were Remus, to be quite honest. I love him too much to betray him that way. I’m sorry, Harry, I’ve been so unfair to you,” Severus said as he pulled the boy into another hug, wishing he had stopped long enough before to think about what Harry was feeling. He had chosen sides too soon, blinded by the pain that Draco was feeling over the discovery of the abuse. He had abandoned his son so easily, and he felt terrible.
“He’s in his office. Fawkes showed up in the library, crying and flying around hysterically. When I went to comfort him, he somehow Apparated me to Dumbledore’s office, I dunno how. I found him slumped over in his chair, and he kept asking for you, Severus. He seemed confused and really weak. I ran as fast as I could; I don’t know what happened,” Harry explained as they finally stepped off the dizzying spiral staircase leading to the Astronomy Tower.
Hermione’s eyes were impossibly wide and Ron’s mouth was gaping open stupidly. They stared in utter silence for what seemed like hours until Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and turned around to see Snape behind him.
“Hermione,
“Merry Christmas, Dad.”
“Albus said that there was a chance, but I wasn’t sure if you’d be ready for something like that. Thank you; if it can’t be me, I’m glad it’s you,” said Remus, holding the Potions Master close as he felt a heavy weight lifted off his shoulders. He had been devastated to hear that Harry was in need and, because of what he was, he couldn’t help.
“We’ll need to try to get our hands on one of those. We’ll want one of the larger ones so it can hold as much of the dissolving solution as possible. I think I should ask Madam Pomfrey if she has any. They’re rarely used with healing, but there’s always a possibility. I’ll go floo call her from the drawing room,” said Remus as he stood and smiled gently at Sirius before turning and leaving the basement kitchen.
Remus turned to look at Severus, a hard gleam in his usually warm amber eyes. “You want straightforward, Severus? Fine, I can be
After the smaller items were placed in the cauldron, Lucius used a spell – a fairly dark one – that turned the marble scythe into dust, which floated to the bottom of the cauldron. He felt the hair on the back of his next stand up as all of the sound in the graveyard seemed to cease all at once.
Harry grinned and pulled Ron into a quick hug, giving him an extra squeeze to show his appreciation. He knew Ron was trying to make up for all of the things he had put Harry through in the past year, and he was glad to have his best mate back at last. After accepting a hug and a long kiss from Draco and reassuring his boyfriend that he would be careful, Harry and Severus headed out the front door of Grimmauld Place and walked around to the alley. Harry donned his cloak and stepped into the circle of his father’s arms so that the man could apparate them both to the gates of Godric’s Hollow Cemetery.
Hermione took the little vile of purple potion and slipped it into her pocket with a sheepish look on her face. She seemed to be in shock due to Snape’s actions and words. “Thank you, Professor. I hope this is it...”
Draco nodded, again impressed that Harry even knew that much. “That’s part of it, though blocking certain emotion from breaking through is far more advanced than constant blockage. You’ll get there eventually I’m sure, but one thing at a time.”
“I know, Harry. I’m sorry,” Severus whispered, smoothing down the Gryffindor’s unruly hair as he tried to offer whatever comfort he could. That Harry would immediately blame himself for the Auror’s disappearance saddened Severus greatly, making him wish he could take such a heavy burden off his son’s shoulders. He still wasn’t used to the fact that his
Charlie chuckled as he put his own wand away and clapped Harry firmly on the shoulder. “It’s quite alright, Harry. That was very smart of you, actually. Tonks would do well to remember her training, eh?” he said as he grinned at the now purple-haired woman. “Anyways, urgent business, I’m afraid. Dung has got himself arrested again and as Kingsley is still out looking for Snape, Dumbledore needs you to clean up this mess for him. I’ll stay with Harry until you get back.”
Severus gave up his annoyed mood and grasped his son’s hand in his own. The genuine look of fear and exhaustion on the boy’s face tore at Severus, and he vowed to never put that look on his child’s face again. “I apologize, Harry. It is not every day you are assaulted by your place of employment.”
“I’m going to talk to my father about this tonight, I promise,” Harry whispered to the blonde as they sat down at a table in the back together.
“Master of the Elder wand? Yes. However, I don’t think he knows that Dumbledore had the wand for so long, or that he is now its master. We need to protect that knowledge at all costs,” Severus said, feeling a small ball of fear roil in his stomach. Voldemort could not get his hands on that wand, lest the apocalypse Dumbledore had prevented with his defeat of Grindelwald be completed by Voldemort.
Severus rolled his eyes affectionately as he pulled his mother’s wand out of his pocket and held it out to Draco. “You’re very welcome. Now, wands are quite expensive these days, Dragon. That is why I have been using my mother’s old wand since my own was taken from me. However, it just wasn’t working well for me, so I had to buy myself a new one. I think, though, that Eileen’s wand will work wonderfully for you. Give it a try,” Severus insisted with an encouraging smile.
Harry looked around and realized that Tonks was right; he was the last of his friends, besides Ginny, to come of age, and none of the rest of them had done anything special for their birthdays. They’d all been under too much stress to bother and that was why Harry had been so reluctant to make a big deal about his own birthday. But Tonks was also right that they all deserved a chance to relax and feel like normal teens for just one night. They had the Sobering potion and permission; what was there to stop them?
Remus’ expression steadily took on a more worried form. He took a second to think before grasping Severus’ hand in his own. “I think we need to inform the Headmaster that he’s missing.”
“He’s going to be ok, Harry, there’s no need to panic,” said Remus, looking up at Snape as if asking for help.
“We’d like to thank everyone for their quick response, and apologize for the suddenness of this meeting, but there is little time to waste, and much to be done. Harry,” Draco said, nodding for Harry to take the reins of the meeting now.
“Ronald, how
“We’ve asked to be able to check on the both of you every once in a while, and you’ll have full access to our tent, should you ever need us,” Severus explained, rolling his eyes at the word ‘tent’. Really, their tent was more like a portable hotel suite.
WARNING: Character deaths that may make you feel guilty for being extremely pleased!
Harry smiled and nodded bemusedly, wondering what the Herbology Professor had to do with anything. He pulled away and headed towards the door of Scrivenshaft’s. “Come on; let’s see if we can find anything in here for Remus.”
The atmosphere didn’t feel appropriate when Harry and Severus walked through the rickety old gate to the quaint cemetery behind the church in Godric’s Hollow. It should have been pouring rain, or a heavy flow of snow falling thickly to the ground so that it obscured everything around; something besides this seemingly cheerful sunshine and happily twittering birds. Though summer was in full swing, there was a cool breeze that blew Harry’s wayward hair about and brought the scent of honeysuckle and pine to their noses.
Draco nodded as he leaned heavily against his Head of House, his head starting to pound again as whatever Dumbledore had given him began to wear off. “Can you give me Dreamless Sleep, Severus? I won’t be able to sleep on my own...”
Harry didn’t have the heart to wake Hermione up and send her to her dorm, so he pulled out an extra blanket and carefully laid it over her. He was just about to turn away to tell Draco goodnight when Hermione woke up, blinking tiredly through her messy curls.
” Harry snapped again, stomping over to his bed and flopping onto it, curling himself up in his blankets and ignoring his father as he snuffed out his candle with a heavy sigh.
“It’s in my room, but I still haven’t really figured out how to use it quite yet.” Draco yawned and sat up, stretching high over his head as he realized just how tired he was. He’d done entirely too much studying that day. “I’m exhausted; I think I’m going to head to bed.”
Headmaster Dippet’s smile fell a little, but he mostly just looked confused at the barely of-age boy before him. “Tom, you’ve only graduated a day ago, and you’ve been of age for just a few short months! I require my Professors to have a little more life experience before taking on such a stressful job as a Hogwarts Professor. What subject would you even teach?”
