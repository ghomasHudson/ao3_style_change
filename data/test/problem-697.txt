It was the best sex of Harry’s life, and it took him several minutes to come back to earth, listening to Draco’s breathing slow as aftershocks racked his body. The faint sounds of the orchestra could be heard from below, reminding Harry of where they were, how easily someone could discover them in such a compromising position. He didn’t want to move, reluctant to move away from Draco, not wanting to stop touching him, but Draco was shifting underneath him now, so Harry sighed and stood up, spelling them both clean and praying that his robes weren’t ruined beyond repair. Once they were both less dishevelled, Harry turned to Draco, wanting to know where they stood now but worried about what Draco might say. Luckily for Harry, Draco broke the silence first.
His hand was cold against Harry’s hot skin, the temperature combining with the heady sensation of Malfoy’s touch on his skin after so long to leave Harry shivering, and all thoughts of taking things slowly vanished as desperate need overtook Harry. He pulled back for just long enough to pull his t-shirt off, Malfoy quickly following suit and removing his own shirt, before grabbing Malfoy’s hand and practically dragging him up the stairs to his bedroom.
by Potter when they were at school, something compelling him to try and get Potter’s attention by any means necessary. As the years passed and Draco escaped from under his father’s thumb, he’d become more comfortable with his sexuality and realised what his adolescent obsession had really been about. It didn’t help that Potter kept appearing in magazines in gym wear that did nothing to hide his Quidditch-honed muscles. He’d featured in more than one of Draco’s dirty dreams in the past few years, thanks to those photos.
‘You didn’t need to pay to see me,’ Draco replies, heart thumping in his chest as he skirts dangerously close to a confession. He’s not the type to take a risk, to put his heart in danger, but the thought of missing this chance with Potter—with Harry—is too much.
They walked in silence for a few minutes, Harry watching the patients and Healers go by, marvelling once again at all the weird and unexpected maladies the patients suffered from. Over the years he’d grown used to the wizarding world, and generally nothing shocked him anymore, but there were still occasions where he was struck by just how different it was to the Muggle world he’d grown up in.
Draco made his way back over to Harry in time for the speeches to start, and as the presenter introduced Draco’s ex with a long list of all his accomplishments, Harry reached down and took Draco’s hand once again, his heart beating out of his chest as he did so, terrified that Draco would reject it. But Draco didn’t, the frown that had appeared on his face when his ex took to the stage being replaced by a small, private smile that made Harry’s heart leap with joy. Harry didn’t even listen to Baptiste’s speech, too focused on the warmth of Draco’s palm against his to care what he was saying. Harry was taken by surprise when suddenly Draco started tugging on his hand, dragging Harry onto the dancefloor.
After they’d all taken their turn holding the trophy, and shared one more group hug, the team retreated to the locker room, excitedly talking about how they were going to celebrate, sweeping Harry along with them. The locker room was like an oasis of calm when they barged in, the door closing on the noise of the crowd outside, and they all stopped for a moment, looking around at each other, before Oliver whooped and the spell was broken. The Beaters, Adams and Robson, started talking loudly about the party they were throwing that night, extracting promises to show up from each member of the team. Oliver collapsed onto a bench in tears, the trophy hugged tightly to his chest. Harry thought it might be a few days, if not longer, before anyone managed to prise it away from him. He couldn’t begrudge him that though—Oliver had dedicated more hours and energy to the team than anyone else, and he deserved to savour every second of their victory.
By the end of the week Harry was exhausted. He was spending several hours a day watching training sessions and the rest of the day was taken up by exercises and sessions with the team physio. He barely had time to himself during the day to think about anything but training, let alone spend hours missing Malfoy, and yet he couldn’t stop the thoughts that popped into his head every so often when he thought of something that he wanted to tell Malfoy, or when he successfully did a new exercise and wanted to show Malfoy how much he was progressing.
‘I can’t wait,’ Harry said, walking Draco to the door, where he proceeded to push Draco up against the wall and thoroughly scramble his brains with a breathtaking kiss. When Draco finally left Harry’s house, he Apparated home with a huge grin on his face that remained firmly in place until he finally drifted off to sleep to thoughts of Harry.
‘Yeah, ok, right.’ Harry had never seen Malfoy so off his game before. Malfoy was usually so in control, cool and collected, but now he seemed flustered, lost for words. ‘All right, how do you want to do this?’
looked through Harry’s eyes, what Harry was thinking after so many years without seeing each other. He was sure it was nothing like what Draco was thinking.
‘Foul!’ the commentator called, her voice ringing out across the stadium. ‘Penalty to Puddlemere United for cobbing against Turner.’
‘Just like you are,’ Harry replies, settling himself between Draco’s open thighs and wandlessly casting the spell to slick his cock. ‘I want to see you, kiss you, while I fuck you.’
Ron and Hermione had been incredibly supportive since Harry had left the hospital. They’d popped over several times, laden with casseroles and lasagnas that Molly had made for him. Harry hadn’t told them what had happened with Malfoy, but they’d clearly picked up on his mood, and although they didn’t pry beyond asking if he was okay, Harry knew his mood was partly responsible for them deciding to stay for dinner each time they came over. Ron was perhaps even more excited than Harry was about Harry nearly being ready to start training again. Right from the start of Harry’s career he’d been his number one supporter, and it warmed Harry’s heart to know that after so many years that was still the case, even if Ron’s various bets did play a part in his keenness.
‘Just—’ Andromeda added as she reached the doorway on her way to collect Teddy. ‘Just remember he’s young, and the world is different now.’
‘That’s part of why I came here,’ Malfoy said. ‘I needed to explain—Astoria and I, we have an agreement, I suppose you could call it.’
‘Alright, Evangeline?’ Harry said, glancing quickly at his watch and realising with shock that he’d been completely zoned out for well over an hour.
‘My mum was a Hufflepuff. I hope I’m one,’ Teddy replied, the reference to his mother slipping out without any hesitation. Draco had noticed that there were plenty of photos of Tonks and the odd one of Professor Lupin scattered around the house, and he wondered what exactly Teddy knew about the circumstances of his parents death. He hoped he didn’t know how much of a part Draco had played—although Draco knew he would deserve it, he didn’t want Teddy to hate him.
‘Me too, it’s always felt a bit boring.’ Harry chuckled, gently turning Draco around where they stood so that he faced Harry once again. Nerves fluttering, Draco leant down and kissed Harry again, relieved when Harry readily kissed him back. As the kiss began to turn heated though, Harry pulled back, one hand on Draco’s chest, moving up and down with his fast breathing.
‘You just want Harry to play because you’ve bet on Puddlemere,’ Hermione said without looking up from the chart.
His mind is racing at a million miles an hour as he tries to process the fact that Potter booked an appointment with a whore. He had no inkling of Potter’s preference for men—he’s apparently done a very good job of keeping that out of the press. But however confused and taken aback Draco might be by Potter’s sudden appearance, he can’t deny the small, flickering flame of interest that’s springing to life.
Harry’s so close now, and Draco wants him so badly, all the feelings that he’s tried to push away rushing back. His fingers itch to touch Harry, to feel his skin after weeks of missing it.
‘Well you’d rather read that than the books Hermione suggested,’ Ron interjected. ‘She wanted to bring you a biography of Uric the Oddball, but I told her you wouldn’t want to read about some boring old wizard.’ Harry shot Ron a grateful smile as Hermione continued unpacking the bag.
‘And, ah.’ Malfoy hesitated. ‘Well, I had been wondering about Healing since sixth year, really. Since Severus healed me after—’ Malfoy broke off, his eyes wide and shining in the dim light as he looked at Harry. He looked almost surprised, like he hadn’t expected to say that much.
‘Right, yes, we should,’ Harry says, waiting for the let down, for Draco to say that this was a mistake and that they shouldn’t do it again.
, that they needed to stop this, before it went any further and consumed Harry even more completely than it already had.
If such a thing was even possible, Malfoy’s expression had grown even grimmer as he looked down at Harry.
‘Did you do your training here?’ Harry asked tentatively. There was so much he didn’t know about Malfoy, so much he
‘You wouldn’t have known, watching you fly,’ Draco said as he came to a stop in front of Harry. His gaze was admiring, and Harry was reminded of one of their dates, a month or two into their relationship, when they’d finally been able to fly together. It had been one of the best dates of his life, and as they’d laid in bed afterwards, sweaty and sated, Draco had confessed that he’d always been turned on by watching Harry fly.
‘And yet you’re here,’ Draco’s mere feet away from Potter now. He can smell mint in the air, and the very ends of Potter’s curly hair are damp—he’s clearly showered recently. It’s a deliciously tempting image, and Draco’s desire deepens further.
He’s furious, and he needs to do something. He briefly considers going to find Potter so that he can shout at him, but then remembers he has no idea where Potter lives. Just another reminder that this was all business for Potter, that none of it had been real.
Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough for Draco, too impatient to see Teddy again. Now that he had the idea for the trips, Draco suddenly felt energised and excited about the lessons, and he was looking forward to actually doing something fun with Teddy. Work had been fairly quiet for once, and he’d actually managed to leave at a reasonable hour most days, something he didn’t usually manage. He spent every evening poring over the books he’d borrowed from the Manor, searching for details of historically important magical locations, excitement building in his stomach with each location he added to the list. He loved the idea of taking Teddy back to where it all began, before it got twisted and warped and became about being superior to everyone else. He just wanted to show Teddy why everyone loved magic so much, why it deserved protecting. He hoped that by combining it with trips into the Muggle world, Teddy would see the best of both worlds, and understand how both traditional wizarding culture and Muggle culture had something to offer. Teddy was a Half-blood, after all, and should know about both sides of his heritage.
‘Right,’ Malfoy said eventually, lowering his wand hand and turning to face Harry, all the while maintaining their contact. The look on his face made Harry’s stomach constrict with nerves. That expression could only mean bad news.
The next day, the idea was still in the back of Harry’s mind, but the light of day had him questioning whether it was really such a good idea. He debated it with himself all morning, alternating between thinking that he should just go ahead and suggest it to Draco and thinking that it was perhaps the stupidest idea he’d ever had, which was really saying something - he had once stolen a dragon after all. His decision was made for him, however, when he overheard Cyrus and Esther talking about the ball as he and Draco made their way back to their office from the kitchen, steaming mugs of tea clutched tightly in their hands. The others weren’t even saying anything about Draco or Baptiste, wondering idly instead about what theme would be chosen for the decorations this year, but Harry noticed the way Draco’s lips pinched into a thin line, his eyebrows pulling together as they passed the chatting pair.
‘I need to get flying again,’ Harry said finally, skirting around Malfoy’s last point. ‘I can’t miss the whole season, so whatever it takes, I’m up for it. When can we get started?’
‘You call yourself an Auror, I’ve been standing here for at least two minutes,’ Draco says, the left-hand corner of his mouth twitching up into the smirk that Harry loves so much.
‘Are you really not going to expand on that? Or are you trying to cultivate an air of mystery with your refusal to answer basic questions? Because if you are, it’s really not working.’ It absolutely was working. Draco was desperately curious to know more, needing to know why the topic had made Harry clam up so tightly.
‘What did you have in mind?’ Harry asked, one hand absentmindedly pressing down on his aching cock through his Quidditch trousers.
Harry’s last few days in St Mungo’s flew past in a blur of exercises, gentle walks around the hospital, and final doses of Skele-Gro. His healed bones were growing stronger and stronger, the exercises hurting less each time he did them, and the anticipation of flying again was bubbling in his veins. He knew he still had a lot of rehab to do before he would be match fit, but soon he would be able to at least try getting on a broom again.
‘Would be nice to give everyone something else to gossip about besides poor Harry Potter, dateless at a ball again too,’ Harry added, eyebrows furrowing as he remembered the endless headlines that had been splashed all over the front page of the
They ended up in the middle of the dancefloor, surrounded on all sides by couples dancing to the music. Harry’s heart went into overdrive as he realised that he would have to hold Draco and dance close together like them. Draco took the lead, placing a hand on Harry’s waist and moving them into a dancing hold, the spots where they were in contact with each other burning with awareness. Harry let Draco guide them, trying to keep up with the steps even while his brain was completely distracted by their proximity. He was just about surviving, and had only stood on Draco’s feet two or three times, but then the music changed, slowing down. In turn, their movements slowed, Draco pulling Harry closer seemingly on a reflex, until their chests were nearly touching. Harry had never been so aware of such a small amount of space.
Draco had been waiting for a client. It was a Wednesday evening, 9pm, which always meant Jean-Luc. Draco has no idea how Potter persuaded Jean-Luc to give up his spot, but he only spares a moment to wonder about it. He’s far more intrigued by why Potter is here at all.
They’d rolled over to face each other now, bodies curling in to each other, but there was still a gap between them. It felt wrong to touch Malfoy as he talked about his wife, even though they’d already done so much worse.
‘Well, far be it for me to stop the Chosen One drinking his coffee where he chooses,’ Draco said, giving a mock bow.
The suspect is tiring, his curses less powerful, his arm shaking as he points his wand in their direction, and Harry chances a glance over at Draco. Draco looks back, his face pink, his hair plastered to his face with sweat, and nods, ever so slightly. They’ve got him. Swiftly, with years of practice behind them, they advance, Harry sending a barrage of minor hexes towards the cowering suspect in an attempt to distract him as Draco, always more skilled at precision work, waits for the perfect moment before casting the final spells to disarm, silence, and handcuff the suspect. Before Harry has even had time to wipe the sweat off his forehead, their back-up team is running down the alley, throwing a cursory ‘good work’ in Harry and Draco’s direction before disapparating with the suspect in tow, bound for the Ministry’s holding cells.
‘Now, surely you of all people know him well enough to know he wouldn’t do that. And besides,’ Esther continued, looking intently at Harry, a twinkle in her eye, ‘he might be tired, but he’s happier than I’ve ever seen him.’
Twenty minutes later, they were settled at a small table in one corner of the tearoom. It had taken Harry quite a while to navigate the stairs, his hip protesting at the unusual movement, and he gratefully accepted the cup of tea and slice of cake that Malfoy handed to him, in desperate need of nourishment after the effort. Nearly all the tables in the tearoom were unoccupied due to the late hour. Their only company was an older couple talking softly near the door, their hands joined over the table, and a young man sitting alone, an uneaten sandwich sat on a plate in front of him. He was facing them, and he looked exhausted, on the verge of falling asleep where he sat.
Harry picks up speed, his hips moving faster and harder, and soon they’re fucking properly. It’s nothing they haven’t done before, but it’s somehow different this time. Draco can’t look away from Harry’s face, and Harry doesn’t turn away either. Draco doesn’t know what his face is giving away, but Harry’s expression is tender, his eyes full of something that Draco hopes might be love. Draco’s never had sex with someone he loves before, and if this is what it’s like, he doesn’t think he can ever go back. It’s like magic, sparking around them and drawing them closer together, making every sensation
, or anything Father would have approved of the Malfoy heir doing. I wanted something different, something that was mine.’’
‘Yep,’ Harry said through gritted teeth, although the pain was already receding as the initial shock faded.
‘Well,’ Potter says, one hand on the door knob, his clothes neater but his hair still a rumpled mess that immediately gives away what they’ve been doing. ‘Thank you, I suppose.’
Harry could only smile back at him in response, his thumb stroking the soft skin of Malfoy’s hand, unable to find the words to convey the mix of feelings running through him. There was excitement, to see where things with Malfoy could go, a slow simmering desire that their early coupling hadn’t fully sated, but there was guilt too, and sadness, tempering the happiness that he felt at the sight of Malfoy’s smile. He wanted this, wanted to try with Malfoy, but even though he had caused it, he was still grieving the end of his marriage, and the life he’d thought he was going to have.
Hands snuck under t-shirts, and soon Draco was stripping Harry of his clothes, revealing a toned chest and the most gorgeous prick Draco had ever seen, hard and heavy with desire. He couldn’t stop himself moving down to lick the head, teasing it with just his tongue, the noises Harry was making sending a thrill through Draco. It was only when Harry began to whisper
‘If you’d like,’ Draco says, sounding far calmer than he feels. ‘You know how to make an appointment.’
‘I was explaining to Trainee Healer Barnett that you turned down Dreamless Sleep last night,’ Malfoy said, his brow furrowing as he looked down at Harry intently. Harry was certain the pain really
The movement of Malfoy’s hands as they pushed Harry’s t-shirt up his chest pulled Harry’s thoughts away from the temporary nature of their entanglement, and Harry let Malfoy pull his t-shirt off, groaning loudly when Malfoy’s hands moved to his waistband.
Fury was radiating off her in waves, and Harry took an automatic step back as she continued to shout. He’d known he was wrapped up in Malfoy, that Malfoy could hold his attention like no one else, but he couldn’t believe he’d been so distracted that he hadn’t noticed his own wife in the alley with them.
Harry had been here before with Healers and was used to them trying to avoid putting a timeline on his recovery for fear of disappointing him, on the off chance he didn’t recover as quickly as expected. But this was Malfoy, so Harry couldn’t resist pushing.
Draco expects Potter to give up after the fourth appointment he refuses to take. There’s plenty of people out there that he can pay for sex, after all. No need to keep coming to Draco when a warm body is all he wants.
The sound of Millie shuffling in place brought them back to earth, Harry suddenly remembering where he was. His face flushing, he hurriedly pulled on his clothes, adjusting himself to hide the effect Draco had had on him, before turning to face Millie. He thanked her profusely for her help, and confirmed when he would come for his next fitting. He didn’t say anything to Draco. It was cowardly, and he knew it, but he felt raw, exposed, and like he might break if they had to acknowledge what had passed between them. Instead, he muttered some vague excuse about being late for dinner, and quickly left the shop, Apparating home as soon as he could.
The grin that Harry shot his way made up for any embarrassment Draco felt at his hasty acceptance however, as did the way Harry once again linked their fingers so they could Apparate to his house from the alley behind the cinema.
‘They always have the same look; complete and total exhaustion, but not sadness,’ Malfoy said, and Harry looked closer. He was right—the man was clearly shattered, but he didn’t look hollow with grief, unlike the older couple.
‘Merlin you don’t give up do you? No wonder you managed to defeat Voldemort with persistence like that.’ Draco laughed, before his tone turned serious once again. ‘It’s not that it’s a bit run down, that could be fixed, although I do think you’re seriously overestimating the power the Malfoy name has now. It’s that I wouldn’t be allowed to have the wedding I want here, to the person I want.’
Normally when Harry woke up in the middle of the night he paced, wearing tracks into the carpets on Grimmauld Place’s stairs, walking off the lingering traces of nightmares or panic until he was exhausted enough to fall asleep again. He itched with the urge to get up and move but his injuries kept him confined to his bed. He picked up one of the books Hermione had left on his bedside table in an attempt to distract himself from the sensation of his bones slowly, agonisingly stitching back together, but he couldn’t focus, and tossed it aside in frustration after only a few minutes. The silence of his hospital room was too loud, too reminiscent of the first years after the war, when he’d been all alone in Grimmauld Place, struggling to adjust to sleepless nights without the noises of the boys' dorm or the Burrow. His heart started to race as a panic he hadn’t felt in a long time began to creep through his veins.
‘Hurts a bit, but my wrist feels better,’ Harry said, flexing his wrist slightly as he spoke, reassuring himself that it did indeed feel better.
‘Agnes was talking about her son at bridge this week, and he’s hired a tutor to teach his son, as his career doesn’t allow him time—he spends so much time abroad, you know, in his diplomatic role.’
‘You’ll need an intensive course of Skele-Gro. According to your notes you’ve taken it before?’ Malfoy was talking like there was no history between them, his tone polite and professional, even slightly disinterested.
Draco nearly came at just those words, the thought of Harry inside him too incredible to bear. He managed to hold himself back though, and instead hurried to remove his own trousers, resettling himself back on Harry’s thighs. He conjured a palmful of lube and spread some of it on Harry’s dick, before reaching back and quickly preparing himself, too desperate to feel Harry inside him to wait long. The feeling that rushed through him as he slowly sank onto Harry’s prick was indescribable, the stretch perfect and the look on Harry’s face making Draco’s heart pound. They began to move together, slowly at first and then quicker, Harry’s hips snapping up to meet Draco’s every movement. Draco couldn’t believe how good this was, how they seemed to instinctively know what the other wanted, how Harry knew that he liked a tight grip on his hips and a fast pace.
‘Yes—fuck—yes,’ Harry said, hurriedly conjuring more lube and slicking up his cock before bracing one hand against the wall, his body bracketing Malfoy’s.
‘You like it here, then?’ Potter’s voice is tentative, as though he too is trying to restore the peace.
‘Merlin, yes,’ Malfoy said, his voice ragged. ‘You have no idea, Potter, no idea how—’ Malfoy cut himself off abruptly, hauling Harry back into a devastating kiss.
to worry about a failed Death Eater getting a few death threats, I suppose.’ The instinct to pick at Potter, to press his buttons, is too strong to resist, years of habit not yet broken.
‘Well, yeah, basically,’ Harry laughed. ‘Although I wouldn’t say you were my school enemy - I think Voldemort still gets that honour. School pain in the arse maybe.’
As Harry read, comprehension dawned, and he understood why Draco had reacted so strongly to the invitation, when normally he loved the Yule Ball. Monsieur Baptiste Dubois was Draco’s ex. They’d met when he first came to the UK to work with the Ministry, and Draco had seemed happy for a while - so happy that Harry had found himself jealously wishing he could find the same contentment in a relationship. But then something had happened, Harry didn’t know what, and suddenly they were broken up, and Draco was giving death stares to anyone who so much as mentioned the name Baptiste.
the idea of having sex with Malfoy—it was certainly better than dying, and if he was honest, there’d been one or two dreams over the years that had featured blond hair that couldn’t have belonged to anyone else—but like this? When Ginny would be waiting at home for him to get in? When Malfoy was due to meet his wife any minute?
‘Are you particularly keen to go back downstairs for more awkward small talk or would you rather go?’
‘It is a lot,’ Harry said slowly, thinking through what he wanted to say, trying to find the words to express the mix of emotions running through him. ‘Everything with Ginny is so new, and figuring out what my life looks like without her is a lot to process, and it’s only going to get worse now that the whole world knows, but—but if you can wait, if you can cope with all the attention and the shitshow that the
Esther didn’t get a chance to do anything more than smile back at Harry as at that moment the door swung open again, Malfoy striding through it. Now that they’d been pointed out, the dark circles under his eyes stood out dramatically to Harry, although his attention was almost immediately drawn away to the frown that Malfoy was sporting.
Over the next several hours, they worked through the kitchen, the dining room, and the back room, which Malfoy had been correct in saying contained the most dark magic. It was hard work, and Harry’s wand arm was shaking from the intensity of the magic he had continuously been channelling through it for hours, but it was also immensely satisfying to see the coloured threads of the detection charms gradually shift as they removed piece after piece of dark magic from the house.
‘Yes, I’d noticed he’s getting a bit bored, it’s just a bit hard to make inheritance rituals interesting to a ten year old. And I suppose I’m trying to teach him not to blindly believe things he’s told, teach him that Muggles aren’t dirt and that they do have value. Really I just want to make sure he doesn’t get sucked into the pure-blood superiority crap like I did.’ Draco found himself slightly out of breath at the end of his explanation, the words pouring out of, leaving him shocked that he’d just told Harry of all people so much.
Malfoy’s face had grown even paler than normal, his face twisting at whatever he was thinking about.
Some of their trips into Muggle London were distinctly less successful however, especially when Harry decided to sit back and let Draco take the reins in an attempt to prove that he was perfectly able to deal with Muggles, thank you very much. It turned out that Draco was in need of more help than he would let on, as he discovered when he tried to use the self-checkout in Tesco, the robotic voice screeching at him to put his items in the bagging area, and when a Muggle asked him for directions to Trafalgar Square. Each time he nearly died of embarrassment, hating that he had shown himself up in front of Harry. But Harry was always gracious, waving away questions from concerned onlookers and slowly explaining how to actually use the till, or jumping in to direct the stranger himself. It hadn’t been the point of the lessons, but Draco found himself learning more and more about the Muggle world with each trip they took, he and Teddy both eagerly soaking up the knowledge that Harry so freely shared with them.
‘Potter.’ At Malfoy’s quiet word, Harry looked away from his hand to see that Malfoy had opened his eyes and was watching Harry, his eyebrows furrowed in concern.
‘Sleep well, Potter,’ Malfoy replied quietly, a look in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite decipher.
But he didn’t get up immediately, even as his fingers curled around the edges of the armchair in preparation for pushing himself up. Harry was strangely unhappy at the thought of Malfoy leaving, but then a huge yawn escaped from him, pain lancing through his ribs at the force of it, and he knew that he probably should sleep.
Hours after he first got into bed, Draco finally began to drift off to sleep, his mind finally exhausted after an evening spent wrestling over the dilemma, struggling with the pain of remembering his own past behaviour. He knew he could never forget what he had done, that it was something he would always have to carry with him, but normally he used that as a motivation to be good, be
‘Stand up.’ Potter’s voice is harsh, his tone commanding, and Merlin if that doesn’t make Draco’s cock leak. He’s always had a weakness for being told what to do, and when it’s someone like Potter, who radiates power and control? It’s intoxicating.
‘How should I know? Do I look like I know a lot about sex curses?’ Malfoy said in a much more familiar sarcastic tone, one eyebrow raised.
‘I don’t want to come yet,’ Draco said, his tone stern but the effect ruined by his glassy eyes and pink cheeks. ‘And besides, it’s you we should be treating today, not me.’
‘It’s all right,’ Harry said, feeling a strange need to defend Hermione’s choice of book. ‘Bit academic, maybe.’
‘And you’re okay with that?’ When Harry didn’t immediately respond, Ron turned to Hermione. ‘Hermione, can you believe they’re letting Malfoy look after Harry?’
Malfoy was hot and tight around Harry’s finger as Harry slowly opened him up, letting Malfoy’s moans guide him as he figured out how to touch him. Before long Malfoy was pushing back to meet every movement of Harry’s fingers. Harry’s cock was achingly hard, and he was sorely tempted to reach down, just like Malfoy had that day in the cottage, and bring himself off as he drove Malfoy wild with just his fingers. One day he would do that, he caught himself thinking, before he reminded himself that there shouldn’t be a
‘Uh- I’ll have a latte I guess,’ Harry said finally, after looking back up at the menus several more times.
An awkward silence fell then, as they looked at each other. The danger had passed, Harry would survive, what they’d done had worked. Harry supposed he should probably say thank you, but he couldn’t seem to speak. Malfoy came to his rescue yet again.
‘I can’t do it, I don’t have the time. Work is too busy,’ Draco lied. Work wasn’t that busy, but invoking his career as an Unspeakable was always a good tactic to get his mother to back off. He could tell by her expression that Narcissa didn’t entirely believe him, but since his job was sustaining both of them and helping to slowly restore their standing in the magical community, he knew she wouldn’t push any further. As expected, but still to Draco’s great relief, the subject was dropped for the rest of their dinner, conversation returning to safer territories as Narcissa started telling Draco about the plans she had for the Manor’s gardens during the spring.
Things between Harry and Draco lightened after that conversation, as though sharing something personal about themselves that they happened to have in common had finally thawed the little ice that had remained between them. Harry continued to accompany Draco and Teddy on their trips, and soon it was just assumed that the three of them would of course be going together. Draco began to bear Harry in mind when planning the next outing, trying to think of things Harry would enjoy or aspects of pure-blood culture he might be interested in learning about—it was partly his history too, after all.
Draco thought that would be it for another ten years. But, as happened far too often for his liking, Harry proved him wrong.
Malfoy was watching Harry closely, nodding and making quiet noises to show he was still listening. It was the most Harry had talked, or even really thought, about the period immediately after the war in a long time. He preferred to leave those memories locked away, buried deep away from view. But there was something about Malfoy, maybe his own openness when talking about his decision to become a Healer, that made Harry feel like he could talk about it.
‘Not much.’ Malfoy pulled a notebook out of the pocket of his robes. ‘She died a few weeks ago, of old age as far as the Healers can tell. Only family is a daughter, who inherited this house and burned her hand trying to tidy away some ornaments. St Mungo’s alerted us, once they confirmed it was curse damage, though thankfully minor.’
He can tell Potter’s getting close—his thighs are shaking, the room is filled with Potter’s moans, and the hand pulling on Draco’s hair is just tight enough to be painful in the way that he loves. Part of Draco wants nothing more than for Potter to shoot down his throat, but he’s not ready for this to be over yet.
Harry briefly considered refusing, or at least asking for another Healer to check what Malfoy was giving him, but then Malfoy sighed.
‘Sure, Harry, you keep telling yourself that while you fuck him more intimately than you’ve touched me in months. I saw you, holding hands, and your mind’s been elsewhere for months, thinking about him, right?’
Draco’s head is spinning from the rapid change of position and Potter’s words—he can’t even begin to process them properly, not while Potter is fucking him like this, bringing him closer and closer to his orgasm. It’s almost too much, being able to see Potter’s face. It makes everything so much more intimate, and Merlin, Potter looks good like this. His hair is falling into his eyes, curling even more as it dampens with sweat, and his eyes are bright as they look right back at Draco. Draco has a sudden urge to kiss Potter, but that’s not something he does with clients. It’s not something he should do with Potter.
‘It may surprise you to hear, but some of us have more important things to think about than the results of your Quidditch matches, Potter,’ Malfoy said, the switch from consummate professional to sarcasm so quick as to be jarring. But then Malfoy sighed and added, ‘I heard some of the mediwizards talking about it just after you were admitted. Apparently the wizarding world has been on tenterhooks waiting to hear if you’re all right,’ Malfoy said, and Harry didn’t miss the way he rolled his eyes as he spoke. ‘They said that Thorebourne caught the Snitch while you were falling.’
He was half-hard in his trousers by the time Malfoy joined them at the table, his movements graceful and his legs distractingly long as he weaved between the tables, never spilling a drop of his drink. Condensation was dripping off the glass and over Malfoy’s fingers, and Harry was seized by a sudden urge to lick them, to taste the cool water mixed with the taste of Malfoy’s skin. For a moment he wondered whether the curse was still active, still causing him to want Malfoy. He hadn’t felt desire like this in so long—it was like being a teenager again, reminiscent of those weeks at Hogwarts in his sixth year when he and Ginny had first got together, his mind occupied at every moment with thoughts of her. But this time, it was Malfoy he couldn’t get out of his head. He dropped his head into his hands in despair, as he willed his prick to go down and thoughts of Malfoy to go away.
‘Good,’ Malfoy said, Vanishing the beaker with a wave of his wand. ‘Your next dose will be tomorrow.’ And with that, he turned on his heel and left, closing the door to Harry’s room behind him.
‘A bit. More than anything else, at least. We’d talk until the nightmare faded, and I felt like I could go to sleep again. She’s got the patience of a saint, that woman, not that she lets anyone else know that.’
When the Bludger first made impact, he didn’t understand what had happened. One moment he was stretching out a hand to reach for the Snitch, and the next minute he was gasping for breath, pain blooming in his side where the Bludger had connected with its target. With one hand off his broom and no time to prepare, he couldn’t brace against the impact, and for a moment time slowed as he wobbled on his broom, clenching his thighs as he tried desperately to maintain his balance. But the neverending chase for the Snitch had sapped his strength, and his muscles were no match for gravity. For one sickening moment, Harry was aware that he was falling, his stomach turning over from the sudden change in direction, and then everything went black.
‘Oh I do apologise, Potter, I should have been on the lookout for rampaging Gryffindors,’ Malfoy said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
‘It was her daughter,’ Malfoy said when it became clear that Harry wasn’t going to add anything. ‘The one who referred the cottage to us in the first place. After—’ Malfoy paused for a second, as he seemed to search for the words that would let them dance around the reality of what had happened in the cottage, ‘when we went back, finished the investigation, we realised that a lot of the objects had been purchased at the same shop, and recently too.’
Harry felt it first, and Draco caught the moment where his eyes widened in shock and his mouth fell open, Harry coming to a sudden halt before tripping forwards as he chased the feeling further into the valley.
‘Was everything okay with that patient you had to go and help?’ Harry said, adjusting himself so that he was facing Malfoy. He looked tired, Harry thought, drained.
him. And on top of that, Potter had kept coming back, had told Draco things he hadn’t told anyone else, had made Draco think he could be something more than just his whore. How dare he? Why did Potter have to come and ruin Draco’s life just as he was finally happy?
‘What about your friends? Wouldn’t they play Quidditch with you?’ Harry asked. Malfoy hadn’t talked much about his friends, or specific boyfriends, and Harry was desperately curious. There hadn’t been much in the papers about Malfoy for the first few years after the war, which Harry now knew was due to him being in France, but not long after Malfoy had got the job at St Mungo’s there had been a year or so where public interest in him had been high, and photos of him had regularly appeared in the papers. Some of them had just been Malfoy leaving St Mungo’s, but others had featured Parkinson and Zabini too, or occasionally unidentified men who were clearly on intimate terms with Malfoy judging by the way they touched each other. But as Malfoy slowly proved himself to be capable at his job and not secretly plotting anything, public interest waned, and the photos stopped. Harry had no idea who he spent time with anymore, but he wanted to know. He wanted to know everything about Malfoy, and that scared him more than a little.
‘All you have to do is ask.’ Draco shifts so that he can open his legs, gratified by the way Potter’s eyes darken. He still has his trousers on, but the bulge of his cock is obvious, and he can only imagine what he must look like to Potter.
‘Big plans?’ Harry asked, deciding that if they were finally going to have to work together, he might as well be friendly, act as if this was any other job.
‘Uh, it’s fine,’ Harry said, confused. He had no idea what he’d done to make Malfoy go so suddenly cold, after everything that had happened between them in recent days.
Harry rubbed a hand over his face, his stubble rough against his palm. He did usually go to end of the week drinks, and usually had a great time, but Malfoy would be there. Harry had managed to mostly avoid Malfoy since the
with the jewellery box, only catching a few glimpses of him in the corridor, and they’d yet to have a conversation. Harry hadn’t felt ready to actually speak to Malfoy yet, his emotions still raw and confused, the memory of the cottage too fresh in his mind. So far no one seemed to have noticed that Harry was spending more time than usual in his office, avoiding the kitchen and the communal areas, but if he started skipping Friday drinks too often, questions might start to be asked, and Harry really didn’t want to have to explain his behaviour to anyone. With a sigh, Harry waved a hand, all the papers on his desk flying into neat piles ready for him to get back to work on Monday morning, and then he stood, pulling on his coat and heading out to the pub.
‘God, play-fighting with him was fine when he was small, he’s really way too big now,’ Harry chuckled, rubbing his ribs and wincing.
‘Um, sorry, what did you say?’ Harry asked, praying they hadn’t noticed him cataloguing Malfoy’s face.
‘We can’t do this, Harry,’ he said breathlessly, and it tore at Harry’s heart to hear his name used for the first time as Malfoy rejected him.
Harry’s question hung in the air as Draco looked around the grounds, searching for time as he debated how to answer, unsure of how much to reveal. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him, that intense gaze that he’d felt trained in his direction more and more frequently over the past few weeks setting off a flurry of jitters in his stomach.Teddy had run off soon after they had started chatting, his eyes lighting up as he spotted the tree that a younger Draco used to sneak off and climb during boring ceremonies. Draco watched as he swung wildly from one of the branches, a tiny tug of jealousy pulling at his heart. He wished he could have been that free as a child.
Harry didn’t think about the ball for the rest of the day, too caught up in the excitement of finally having a potential lead for his case and then distracted by the busyness of dinner and trying to get three far too awake children into bed. But then, once the children had all finally gone to their rooms and the house fell silent, thoughts of his and Draco’s conversation came rushing back.
‘I didn’t mind France—life was easier there in a lot of ways—but Mother needed me, so I came home. It was a bit of a battle convincing St Mungo’s to take me, but I’m glad they did.’
When Teddy’s attention started to wander, Draco decided it was time they moved on, and they walked slowly across Westminster Bridge, pausing to look over the side at the water below and the boats passing underneath them. Draco had been planning to get Teddy an ice cream and then start the journey home, but as they passed the aquarium Teddy turned to Draco and begged to go in, puppy dog eyes in full effect. Surprisingly unable to say no, unwilling to deny Teddy anything that would mean he enjoyed their time together, Draco led Teddy into the aquarium, once again fumbling slightly with the money—he’d forgotten everything he’d memorised about Muggle currency that morning—and staring blankly when the cashier asked if he wanted to use contactless. Thankfully the cashier was clearly used to tourists who didn’t quite know how many pennies went into a pound, so she kindly helped him, her friendliness sparing more of Draco’s blushes. It was all worth it though, to see the wonder on Teddy’s face as they walked through the aquarium, pausing in front of each tank to look at the huge sharks and colourful fish. Even Draco’s mishap with the lift—he just couldn’t get the door to stop closing and then immediately opening again—couldn’t put a damper on the day.
‘Dreamless Sleep?’ Grace answered, glancing up at Malfoy to check his response, her cheeks pinking as Malfoy smiled at her.
‘Then one night Ron dragged me out to the pub to have a drink with some people from school, and Oliver was there. He’d already been with Puddlemere for a while by then, although he wasn’t Captain yet. He told me that their Seeker was planning on retiring—it wasn’t common knowledge at that point—and said that if I fancied it, he’d put a word in with the team and get me a tryout.’
‘Got a secret stash of firewhiskey around here anywhere?’ Harry asked, breaking one of their long silences. Harry’s hot chocolate mug sat empty on the coffee table, and Draco realised he must have finished it while Draco was staring into the fire, dreaming about being able to touch Harry.
’ he shouted, slapping his hands down on the counter. It was the alcohol, he decided. He’d had too much to drink, and he and Ginny hadn’t had sex in a while (since well before the incident, a quiet voice in his mind whispered, but he ignored it), and that was it. It had nothing to do with Malfoy at all. He would go home and sleep it off, and then he could go back to trying to ignore Malfoy in peace, and continue to pretend that absolutely nothing had ever happened between them.
When Harry’s hands curl into Draco’s hair, what started out soft turns more heated, Draco pressing his body closer and wrapping his arms around Harry, wanting him as close as possible. They kiss until Draco is panting, aching with need but also content to do nothing but enjoy being close like this. He’s so used to rushing to the main event that it’s a treat to enjoy the journey.
By the time Saturday afternoon rolled around, Draco felt sort of prepared. He had a stack of books from the Manor library tucked under one arm, and a letter from Narcissa clenched in his other hand, detailing a list of topics to discuss ranging from the appropriate robes to wear to a formal dinner to the necessity of betrothal and marriage contracts. He also had a separate piece of parchment, on which he’d written out what he wanted to say, the complete opposite to the contents of his mother’s letter. He knocked on the door of the stone cottage Andromeda had lived in ever since she got married, and waited, nerves building in his stomach with every second that passed. Eventually Andromeda opened the door to him, ushering him inside the cosy cottage, the noise of Teddy playing already audible in the background.
The room was dark, Harry’s rapid breathing loud in the silence of the night. He could only have been asleep for a few hours, but he felt like he’d spent an eternity lost in his dreams of Malfoy’s hands. Arousal prickled under his skin, and even the pain in his hip from where he must have shifted while asleep faded to something more manageable thanks to the altogether more pleasant sensation running through him. It was a totally unexpected feeling to have in relation to Draco Malfoy and yet, in his half-asleep state, Harry couldn’t bring himself to be angry about it. Maybe a few days ago he would have had more of a problem with it, but after several days of talking to Malfoy, of seeing how carefully he took care of his patients, this latest development left Harry more intrigued than horrified.
Then it’s Draco’s turn, and it’s as though Potter’s confessions have unlocked his own. He’s never really talked to anyone about what it was like that year that the Dark Lord occupied the Manor, but he finds himself telling Potter about the fear that never left him during that time, about the spells he would cast on his bedroom door at night, about the way he struggled to sleep anyway, well aware that his attempts to protect himself wouldn’t help at all. He describes that terrible day when the Dark Lord had found him hiding in the library and told him exactly what he had to do if he wanted to ensure he and his parents survived the war. Potter doesn’t say much as Draco talks, just listens, occasionally nodding or making little noises of encouragement. It’s the most Draco’s ever talked about the war.
It got to the point where Harry was so invested in the trips that he began to send Draco owls with suggestions of places to go. The first time Draco received one he nearly fainted in shock when he unravelled the parchment to find a short note in Harry’s messy handwriting that simply read:
. Without breaking their kiss, Harry walks them over to Draco’s bed, pushing Draco down onto the soft covers and covering Draco’s body with his own. Harry’s hot and heavy on top of him, their pricks rubbing together as Harry begins to move his hips. Draco’s been so turned on for so long that the friction is enough to make him moan, and his volume only increases when Harry moves to finger him open.
Harry didn’t respond for a moment and turned back to his packing to hide from the shrewd glance Esther shot his way. He hadn’t thought much before now about what it meant for Malfoy’s job that he was spending so much time with Harry. He’d been too wrapped up in enjoying the building friendship between them that he hadn’t considered what it was costing Malfoy. But of course Malfoy had other patients whom he needed to spend time treating. And yet, that hadn’t stopped him spending hours with Harry, and that thought set hope blooming in his chest. Maybe Malfoy would be as sad about Harry leaving as he was.
‘What?’ Harry hadn’t expected that. He’d thought that maybe Malfoy would suggest Dreamless Sleep again, or worse, try and talk to him about his nightmare.
Afterwards, they lay there for endless minutes, their breathing gradually slowing, Draco coming back into his body bit by bit, becoming aware of where they were and the chill that was spreading over his bare skin. His head was tucked into Harry’s neck, and he was reluctant to look up, worried about what he might see. He didn’t want to find out that Harry regretted this.
Thorebourne had noticed Harry’s acceleration and was quickly gaining on Harry, the nose of her broom inching into Harry’s peripheral vision. Harry was pushing his broom, and his body, as far as they could go, but he was slowly losing the advantage of his headstart. Thorebourne was a relative unknown, having only joined the Bats the previous season, but she was fast and agile, and Harry was beginning to realise that he’d underestimated her. He dragged his focus back to the Snitch, trying to ignore Thorebourne’s broom as it got ever closer. Losing the Snitch now, when the score was so close and the outcome of the game rested on his shoulders, would be agonising. He was determined he wouldn’t be responsible for Puddlemere losing the opening game of the season.
Despite all the things they did together, all the touching, the kissing, the agonisingly perfect grinding against each other, one thing they never did was talk. They weren’t silent, of course, the night air filling with their breathy moans, their exhortations for
They were silent for a moment, the only noise in the room the faint sounds of the bustling hospital beyond the door. Harry waited for Malfoy to say he had to go—he was on his way home after all, after what was surely a long and busy day—but Malfoy didn’t move. His gaze darted around the room, returning back to Harry’s face again and again, before settling on the book Harry had put aside when Malfoy came in.
‘I know,’ Malfoy said quietly, and Harry knew he did. Their history might make everything between them complicated, and talking about the war was walking across a minefield, but it did mean they shared an understanding that Harry had with very few others.
It’s enjoyable, for a minute or two at least, to see Potter on the back foot. But Draco has in fact grown up over recent years and no longer takes pleasure in tormenting people—at least not unless they ask—so he takes pity on Potter.
In the silence that follows the crack of disapparation, Harry flops back against the brick wall of the alley. He’s soaked through with sweat, his muscles aching and his breathing still rapid as he comes down from the adrenaline of the fight. Normally he’d crash at this point, relying on a strong coffee once back at the office to get through the rest of the day before heading home and falling into a deep and dreamless sleep. The magic takes it out of him, more than others according to Hermione. Something about the strength of his casting. He didn’t really pay attention - if it can’t be changed, he’s not going to worry about it, especially when it’s so helpful in his line of work. He can take a bit of exhaustion in return for more captured criminals.
‘You’ve already paid, Potter,’ Draco says, closing the gap between them fully. Potter’s eyes are shockingly green up close.
‘Oh, well that makes it all better then. What did you do, cheeky handjob? Quick blowjob and figured the wives couldn’t get too mad because no cocks went in an arse?’
Harry sinks back into the water, letting his eyes close again. It’s blissful, floating in the warm water, and it only gets better when Draco starts to run his fingers through Harry’s hair.
Harry’s blood is pumping, his adrenaline spiking and his focus sharpening as he ducks curses and flings hexes back at the suspect. He lives for moments like these, when his world narrows to nothing but the chase and the thrill of bringing in someone he’s been hunting for months. He’s come close on occasions, but he’s never managed to quite replicate the feeling any other way.
‘Did I ever tell you the result of the investigation into that cottage?’ Malfoy said, his tone studiously casual.
Draco didn’t dare look around as he made Harry’s drink, topping the hot chocolate off with a swirl of whipped cream and sprinkles. He was immensely relieved to see that another customer was waiting in line when he turned back around, meaning he only had time to quickly pass Harry his drink, all opportunities for conversation and further embarrassment cut off, at least for the time being.
‘What’s going on?’ she asks, hands on hips in a way that is so Pansy that it makes Draco ache with missing having her around all the time.
Malfoy broke the silence first, to Harry’s surprise. ‘How’s your leg feeling?’ he asked, as they passed a patient barking like a dog every time she opened her mouth.
‘I wasn’t asking you to do it, Draco,’ Narcissa said serenely. ‘I’ll simply find someone else who will.’
Harry was proved right when Malfoy took a step forward, and then another, slowly closing the distance between them. He stopped just in front of Harry, so close that if Harry twitched his fingers they would brush against the fabric of Malfoy’s trousers, and stilled, looking at Harry for a long moment. Deciding that it was now or never, Harry dropped all the barriers that he usually kept wrapped around his heart and didn’t try and keep his feelings from appearing on his face. He let Malfoy look, let Malfoy see all the want and desire that Harry felt for him, let Malfoy see how much Harry had missed him while they had been apart.
‘That one of the Founders put a big snake in the castle because he didn’t like people with Muggle families and then sometimes the snake attacked people, like Hermione,’ Teddy said matter-of-factly.
‘It will be for a few days, but the exercises should help. If you keep doing them for the next few days you should start to feel an improvement.’
‘It’s one of the few places left in the country where you can feel true magic. There used to be hundreds, all over the place, but as wizards were forced into hiding and Muggles began to build their cities, the magic retreated back to the safety of the ground. It still seeps out in some places, and even the Muggles can feel it sometimes, a vague feeling of ‘something is different here’ but this is one of the only places you can go and really
‘But first…’ Harry rolls over until his body is on top of Draco’s once again, leaning down to capture his mouth in a blistering kiss. Draco doesn’t hesitate to pull Harry even closer, his body already responding to Harry’s proximity. Dinner will have to wait.
The moment finally came when Harry noticed that Teddy had fallen asleep right where he was sat, his empty plate still on his knee even as his head began to tilt forward. Quietly, Harry motioned to Draco to move, and they both got up, doing their best not to wake Teddy. Harry picked up Teddy’s plate before gesturing for Draco to follow him out of the living room. Excitement building in his stomach, Draco followed Harry into the kitchen, the only light the streetlight next to the window. Harry put down Teddy’s plate, the sound resonating in the otherwise silent room, and then turned to Draco. Draco’s heart was pounding in his chest as Harry moved closer, his intentions clear on his face. Harry came to a stop just in front of Draco, only centimetres separating them, so close that Draco could see every detail of Harry’s face in the glow of the streetlight. They stood like that, not yet touching, for a long moment. Draco soaked in every single detail, from the coolness of the tiles on his socked feet to the exact way that Harry’s hair was sticking up in the back, not wanting to forget a second of this. Just when Draco thought he couldn’t take it any longer, Harry reached out, gently cupping his face.
They hesitated at the front door, looking at each other, Harry unsure what they were supposed to do now. He wanted to kiss Malfoy goodbye, wanted to ask him to stay, wanted to take him back upstairs, but he was frozen, lost as to what was appropriate for them now. To Harry’s relief, Malfoy took charge, stepping closer and kissing him lightly on the lips, before opening the door.
‘Shit,’ Harry swore, closing his eyes again. The longer he was awake the more intense the pain was becoming. It was as though he’d been numb, and now his nerves were slowly coming back to life.
‘You’ve got to get better quick, mate, the match against the Harpies is coming up soon and I can’t wait to see you and Ginny thrash each other.’ Ron had been talking non-stop about the Puddlemere vs Harpies match ever since the schedule had been released. He’d even roped the whole Weasley family into betting on whether Harry or Ginny’s team would win—apart from Molly, that was, who was refusing on principle, saying she couldn’t bear to pick between them. Harry had no idea who would win—Ginny was a phenomenal player, and her team was brilliant. He was mostly just dreading the headlines that would accompany the match. Despite the many years that had passed since they’d amicably broken up after a brief attempt at dating again after the war, the press didn’t seem to have got the message. He could already predict the headlines and comments during the match about their relationship, none of which would be favourable to Ginny, despite her having done nothing wrong.
Malfoy shot Harry a look at that, one so familiar and yet brand new in this context, and Harry felt his cock twitch. Despite his fervent hopes, the small smile on Malfoy’s face suggested he hadn’t missed Harry’s reaction.
Before he can stop and think it through, Harry moves, turning so that he faces Draco, bringing a hand up to cup his face as he leans in and kisses him.
Draco’s anger is coiled in his stomach, ready to explode, and he hates that once again Potter has got a reaction out of him. Whether they’re fucking or fighting Potter always gets the better of him, and he can’t bear that. He wants to win, just once. And if winning means he never sees Potter again, that he loses the one man he’s truly wanted, well. So be it.
Harry has never hated their robes more than he does right now, as he tries desperately to reach skin, needing to discover if Draco’s skin is as soft as he’s always imagined. Draco tries to help, their fingers tangling together as they both battle with the laces of his trousers, the feel of Draco’s cock underneath Harry’s fingers making him even more uncoordinated than normal. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Draco frees himself, and Harry wastes no time in wrapping his fingers round Draco’s cock, the skin hot and soft under his fingers. Draco moans, his cock twitching in Harry’s hand, and without even thinking Harry drops to his knees, wanting to hear that noise again.
Potter just laughs, his eyes crinkling and a dimple appearing on his left cheek. And Draco absolutely refuses to examine the way his stomach lurches at the sight.
And that was all Harry thought it was, a good friendship and work partnership, solidified through years of shared history. Harry saw no reason why agreeing to be Draco’s date to the ball should change any of that - he was just helping a friend out, nothing more. But then, with just two weeks to go until the ball, Harry had a dream that changed everything.
Potter stills, hips twitching as he spills inside Draco, his long low groan rumbling through Draco’s chest. He stays there for a moment, his arms trembling as he holds himself up, and then he flops onto the bed next to Draco, close enough that their arms touch.
‘Surely that’s incredibly risky, bringing highly dangerous objects into the house of someone who might accidentally set them off? Who would put their mother’s life in danger like that?’
‘Yes,’ Draco says simply. He knows what people think about his job, but he’s not about to be shamed for it, especially by someone who seems to have no issue paying for his services. ‘It pays the bills, gives me freedom, and I’m good at it. Plus, I like sex. This way I get to have as much as I want.’
‘It does look a little dry,’ he said wryly. ‘I think I’ve had my fill of serious academic books, between my training and the courses I still have to take every so often.’
They appeared in the grounds of an old country house, far older than the Manor, its exterior now starting to show signs of age and neglect, the grass growing up over the soles of Draco’s shoes.
They waited quietly for a moment, Teddy with his eyes still tightly shut, Draco watching, waiting, the magic thrumming through his veins as he waited for Teddy to feel it too. And then Teddy gasped, his eyes flying open.
—Malfoy once again demonstrated his oral skills, leaving Harry’s hands scratched from scrabbling against the brick wall as his legs trembled under the onslaught of Malfoy’s mouth, and Harry had never felt so powerful as he did when he returned the favour, overcome by the heady rush of knowing that he was the reason Malfoy was falling apart, his hands tight in Harry’s hair as he spilled down Harry’s throat. When Malfoy spun Harry around one week, the mouth on Harry’s cock being replaced by Malfoy’s hand and a tongue licking up his crease, Harry came almost immediately, the novelty of the act and the feeling of someone touching him in a place he’d only tentatively explored on his own more than he could bear. The week following that was one of the hardest Harry had experienced, his thoughts constantly returning to the alleyway, his cock constantly half-hard. When Friday finally came and Malfoy did it again, Harry nearly wept with relief.
Hands still interlinked, Draco began to walk down the hill, heading towards the valley, Teddy skipping along beside them, his eyes wide as he tried to look at everything at once. Draco hadn’t told Harry or Teddy why they were here, or what they would find, and as they walked, he kept looking over to them, waiting for the moment when they would feel it for the first time.
‘And you didn’t even have to pay for it,’ Draco teases, too full of happiness to find referencing their past upsetting.
Harry’s hand trembled as he opened the door, and a heady rush of relief and anticipation flooded his body when he took in Malfoy stood on the doorstep, the light spilling from the streetlamp above making his hair glow in the early evening twilight.
After presenting their invitations at the door, Harry and Draco walked into a large entrance hall. It was grand, with an intricately painted ceiling and gold accents everywhere, waiters standing ready to offer glasses of champagne as soon as they were past the front door, which Harry gratefully took, ignoring Draco’s look of disapproval at the speed he drank it. The hall led into a large ballroom, an orchestra already playing, the music soaring over the conversations of the guests mingling on the dancefloor. A few people were dancing already, dresses sweeping the floor as they twirled. The room had been decorated for Christmas, and flakes of enchanted snow, charmed to never melt and not be cold, drifted down from the ceiling, settling on the shoulders of Harry’s robes, lingering for several seconds before disappearing without a trace. It was beautiful, and almost unbearably romantic.
Suddenly, the Snitch changed course, shooting back down towards the ground. It took Harry a second too long to process the change of direction, and he swore loudly when he realised that Thorebourne had managed to change direction faster than he had, and was now in front of him. Still cursing his slow reactions, Harry ducked low and charged, the wind whipping at his cheeks making the exposed skin burn as he quickly picked up speed. Despite the heights they’d reached, the ground was rapidly getting closer, the fans transforming from an indistinguishable blur of colour into individual people. This was a risky tactic. If Harry left it one second too late, he’d hit the ground at breakneck speed, and if the Snitch changed direction yet again, the risk would be for nothing anyway, as he would be too slow turning around.
‘You don’t get to just decide to send it back! I don’t need it, don’t want it.’ Potter is pacing around Draco’s living room, his voice echoing loudly.
‘I’m ready, Potter, get on with it.’ Malfoy’s impatient voice broke Harry’s train of thought and brought him back to the present with a rush of lust as he looked away from Malfoy’s arse to meet his heated gaze.
‘Impressive,’ Harry murmured, smiling at Malfoy, whose mouth twitched up at the corners in response.
‘You tell me, you’re the one holding it,’ Draco says snarkily, his old defences snapping back into place in the face of Potter’s anger.
‘Poor Andromeda is starting to struggle with Edward,’ Narcissa began, Draco groaning internally as he braced himself for the guilt trip that was surely coming. ‘He somehow stuck himself to his bed on Tuesday morning because he didn’t want to wake up and go to school. Andromeda couldn’t get him out for several hours; she was beside herself with worry.’
Potter’s standing over him, fully dressed again, hair still a disaster but cheeks back to their normal colour, all other signs of their time together vanished. It makes Draco inexplicably sad.
Draco felt a burst of hope shooting through his veins. Maybe this hadn’t ruined anything, maybe it would turn out to be the best thing they’d ever done.
Harry nodded, folding a tiny patch of his bedding in on itself, over and over again, as he listened to Malfoy.
And then Draco’s stroking Harry hard and fast, in the way that never fails to make Harry come, and Harry’s powerless to do anything but watch Draco’s hand as it coaxes a breathtaking orgasm out of him. He spills over Draco’s fingers and into the water, his moans echoing around the bathroom as he shudders with pleasure.
The wave of guilt that always accompanied Harry when he returned home from his Friday nights with Draco rolled through him as usual when he appeared in his front garden. Conscious that he was even later getting home than normal, he cringed at the loud gravel under his feet as he walked up the path, and tried his best to open the door silently. Waking Ginny up as he snuck into bed, the fingerprints of another man still lingering on his skin, would only make him feel like even more of a dick.
Malfoy hurriedly unzipped Harry’s flies, shoving his jeans and boxers down in one fluid motion, his cock springing free, the cool air a balm against Harry’s hot skin. So quickly that Harry could barely process what was happening, Malfoy dropped to his knees, wrapping one long-fingered hand around Harry’s cock as he did so. Harry couldn’t hold back a moan when Malfoy leaned in and licked a slow stripe up the underside of his cock, and he slid a hand into Malfoy’s hair, holding on tightly as the world spun around him, his eyes sliding shut.
Malfoy held out a hand, hauling Harry up to standing, but then to Harry’s great relief, he didn’t let go, instead shifting so that they were holding hands. It should have felt strange—Harry hadn’t held hands with anyone but Ginny in over a decade—but it didn’t. He told himself it was just because the pain, and the relief of it fading slightly, was distorting his brain.
‘How come you decided to become a Healer?’ Harry asked. It was the question that had kept returning to him again and again ever since he got to the hospital. Harry would never have guessed that the boy he’d known at school would grow up to be a Healer, and his curiosity was piqued.
‘To Muggle London. I rented a tiny flat—we didn’t have much left after the reparations, and I couldn’t leave Mother with nothing—and lived there for a year, after I finished studying for my N.E.W.T.s.’
‘Oh, Merlin, don’t tease me,’ he moans as Potter’s fingers swipe perilously close to his cock, near enough to be agonising without giving him the relief he’s craving.
Harry tailed off, not knowing how to find the words to explain what he was feeling. How to explain the swirling guilt that still lingered, despite knowing that he was free to sleep with whoever he wanted now? And yet, he knew he wanted Malfoy, knew he wanted to keep doing this. Being back with Malfoy, after what had felt like a neverending time apart, had felt like suddenly being able to breathe again. But then Malfoy shifted position, and the light caught on the ring on his left hand, and Harry remembered that he might be single now, but Malfoy wasn’t.
‘I—’ Malfoy started, then paused. ‘Tonight was good, Potter,’ he said eventually, to Harry’s great surprise. They never talked like this.
Harry finally stopped looking around, and Draco hoped the inspection of his inner workings was over, but then Harry started asking questions. He wanted to know what Draco did and why, how he had ended up here, what he did most days. It was almost as though Harry had been missing Ministry life—he had quit the Aurors less than a year after starting and never returned to the Ministry—and was soaking up details of it through Draco. He wanted to know if the fish pie served in the canteen was still just as horrible as it had been all those years ago, whether Albert, a notoriously grumpy magical maintenance worker, was still terrorising the corridors. They ended up talking for far longer than Draco had expected, Harry asking just the right questions to get him to open up about his job, the stories flowing out of him as best as they could considering the Non-Disclosure Charm he was under. They talked for so long that Teddy started complaining, fiddling with anything he could find as he waited for them to leave. When they finally gave in to Teddy’s demands to get on, Draco was in a daze. He couldn’t believe he’d just spent so long talking to Harry, sharing details of his life and work, and enjoying every minute of it.
Millie snapped them both out of their thoughts by handing Harry a new outfit to try on, and the whole process repeated again, Harry keenly aware of Draco’s eyes on him as he modelled each outfit for Millie. It was getting increasingly harder to keep himself under control, to focus on the clothes and the questions Millie was asking him about fit and comfort, when all he could think about was the way Draco had been looking at him.
Malfoy froze, and for a second Harry thought he’d made a terrible mistake. But then Malfoy gasped, his mouth opening under Harry’s, and all at once they were kissing properly. Malfoy’s lips were hot and soft, and the way they moved against Harry’s was sinfully good. All of Harry’s earlier desire came rushing back, and he pressed himself up against the hard planes of Malfoy’s body, never pausing in the kiss as he reached up and tangled his hand in Malfoy’s hair. A bolt of lust shot through him as Malfoy wrapped an arm around Harry, his palm coming to rest just above the curve of Harry’s arse. He ached with how badly he wanted Malfoy, and yet at the same time he thought he could kiss like this for hours, learning the shape of Malfoy’s mouth and the way he responded to Harry’s movements.
. At times, it almost seemed like Malfoy felt the same. Harry was past the point of needing someone to hold onto when he walked, and yet neither of them moved apart. Malfoy was a constant presence at Harry’s side, the smell of his cologne surrounding them, his arm warm against Harry’s as they walked laps around the hospital, their fingers brushing from time to time and sending sparks of pleasure up Harry’s arm. Harry’s nerves were on edge constantly, bombarded continually with awareness of Malfoy. Each night when he collapsed into bed, Harry was exhausted from the ever present anticipation and excitement that churned in his gut, yet at the same time, he couldn’t wait for the morning when he’d get to see Malfoy again.
‘I can’t wait to find out which house I’m in,’ Teddy said, before listing off on his fingers which house each of his extended family had been in, including every single Weasley.
‘I hope you don’t mind that we let ourselves into Grimmauld Place, Harry,’ Hermione said as she set a tin of biscuits on the side. ‘From Molly,’ she added at Harry’s confused look.
Draco’s cock is aching, precome dripping onto the cover below him, and he thinks he could come from just this, from the feeling of Potter’s hands tight on his hips, so tight he’ll have marks there tomorrow, and the onslaught of Potter’s mouth. He’s inching ever closer to his peak—if Potter even just slightly grazed Draco’s cock he thinks it would be all over—but then Potter stops.
him. It was just sex, he told himself resolutely, even as a quiet voice in his head immediately disputed that.
‘Right, come on then,’ Draco said when Teddy’s return broke the slightly awkward silence that had fallen over the living room. ‘We’ve got a lot to do today.’
Potter’s fingers clench tighter in Draco’s hair as he starts to suck Potter’s cock in earnest, letting Potter’s moans and body language guide him to a pace that is just this side of not enough, teasing Potter with swipes of his tongue. Draco has years of practice doing this, but he’s never cared quite so much about making it good for someone.
However hard he tried to tell himself that, Harry knew he was lying to himself. He knew it with every strained conversation he had with Ginny, every kiss he shrugged off, every daydream about Malfoy that he revelled in, but it wasn’t enough to break his infatuation.
Draco’s gaze moves up to Potter’s face and catalogues every mark and freckle, every line of the scar that descends across the right side of his forehead and cuts through his eyebrow. It’s beyond strange, to see Potter like this, so relaxed and at ease. He never looks like this in the photos in the paper.
‘Pansy would never be caught dead on a broom, and Blaise isn’t a big fan either,’ Malfoy laughed, his eyes crinkling with mirth, making Harry’s stomach flip over. ‘I remember trying to teach them to fly one summer during the holidays, and Merlin they were awful. Blaise is terrified of heights, not that he’ll ever admit that to anyone.’
Ron and Hermione visited several times, on one occasion accompanied by Molly and Arthur. Molly brought a quite frankly excessive amount of food with her, but after so long eating hospital meals, Harry could barely restrain himself from devouring it all at once. At first, Molly fussed, plumping his pillows and fretting over his injuries, but thankfully Harry soon managed to convince her that he really was fine. After that they fell into easy conversation, time flying as Harry was filled in on all the latest stories from the extended Weasley family. The team had been training so intensely in the lead up to the first match that it had been several weeks since Harry had managed to make it to Sunday lunch at the Burrow, and it was only now, as Molly talked excitedly about all her grandchildren that he realised quite how much he missed them all.
For a moment, Harry was completely bewildered, without a clue what she meant. Then he saw the trunk next to the table, and with sickening certainty he knew that he was found out.
‘We were sent on a job together,’ Harry continued, ignoring Ginny’s interruption. ‘This old cottage, full of dark artifacts. Long story short, I got hit by a curse, and, well. We had to, you know, or I would have died.’
, and then he picked up his kit bag, slinging it over one shoulder. He looked around the locker room, already looking forward to being back in a few weeks when they would start training for the new season. With a smile, Harry took the hand Draco held out to him, picking up the Snitch that had brought him victory with his other. Together, they walked out of the locker room, Draco’s hand tight in Harry’s, the wings of the Snitch in his other hand fluttering softly against his skin.
‘Ok…’ Harry replied, struggling to think as Malfoy wrapped a hand back around the base of his cock. ‘So I just...come? And if it doesn’t work?’
‘Oh, I—uh—’ Harry hesitated, not wanting to admit to Malfoy that he’d been panicking. ‘Just hurts, I guess,’ he said finally, which was at least true.
‘Nothing revolutionary, believe me,’ Malfoy said. ‘Any of my colleagues could have done the same, but I had one advantage that they didn’t. Due to my, ah, lowly status within the hospital at the time, I had a significantly smaller caseload, and so was able to dedicate far more of my time to my patient. He followed the same course of Skele-Gro that you’re taking now, although he required several more days than you will, due to the quantity of bones to be repaired. Any Healer would have followed that regimen of potions.’
The rest of the evening passed in a blur. Harry wandered aimlessly around the house that he and Ginny had made their home, the place where they had laughed and made love and built a life together, turning from scared, war-scarred kids into just about functional adults. The thought of giving all that up, all the plans they had for their life together, throwing it away because of an infatuation, seemed crazy, and Harry’s heart ached at the thought of everything he could lose as a result of it. But then he thought about never seeing Malfoy again—because he’d have to stop seeing him completely, in any context, if he was to resist touching him, kissing him—and pain rushed through him at the very thought of it, and Harry knew Ginny was right.
‘Probably should go to St Mungo’s,’ Harry sighed. He hated going to the hospital. Hated being fussed over by an endless parade of Healers and mediwitches who all wanted to be able to say they’d helped save Harry Potter’s life. And he really didn’t fancy word getting out that he and Malfoy had ended up injured on their first case together. No one would believe that they’d been working well together when they found that out; his boss would definitely go back to not letting them work together, and Harry had actually quite enjoyed his day working with Malfoy. It was still weird, no denying that, but Malfoy was undeniably good at his job, and Harry appreciated working with someone as efficient and effective as him.
‘How long will it take you for you to recover?’ Hermione asked, going to pick up the chart that Malfoy had left at the end of his bed, her lips pursing as she read it.
‘It was part of it, although I would never claim full credit,’ Malfoy said. ‘But I have certainly encouraged my colleagues to include some form of physical therapy with their patients, when suitable. They haven’t been very keen to act on my suggestion, however,’ Malfoy added with a wry smile.
‘It might be alright, anyway,’ Harry said, clutching at straws as he desperately tried to think of what to say. Talking to people in distress had never been one of his strong suits, and he had been extremely relieved when he realised Draco was far better at it and could therefore take on that role in their work. ‘I suppose he’ll be so busy being the guest of honour and everything that you won’t have to talk to him.’
And then, someone was stroking his hair, brushing the wild curls back from his forehead, their long fingers soft and warm on his skin. Harry could feel their body stretched out next to his, Harry’s face pressed into a toned chest as he dozed. He sighed contentedly, nuzzling his face into the soft skin, smiling as he felt a gentle kiss on his forehead. Eyes still closed against the brightness of the early morning sun, he pulled the other person towards him, tilting his head up for a scorching kiss that quickly turned into something more. The details began to get fuzzy, sensation and feeling overtaking details, but there was no mistaking the blond hair that he was running his fingers through.
‘I am,’ Harry said reflexively, before pausing. ‘Well, I’m not, but I want to be.’ He waved his hands in a vague gesture. ‘I will be, one day. Can we just—I don’t know. Can we just take it slow? Like, maybe we could have dinner?’
‘I think that’ll do for today,’ Malfoy said. ‘You did well though—keep it up and you’ll be fighting fit in no time.’ The smile he shot at Harry was so open and joyful that it made Harry’s heart clench.
‘Well, since you asked so nicely,’ Potter chuckles, and then he’s pressing in, his prick opening Draco up, and
And then Draco is taking off his clothes and slotting himself into the space between Harry’s legs, his back settling against Harry’s chest. The perfect position for him to show Draco just how well he can use his hands too.
. Tonight it had only made him ache with regret and guilt, and he found himself wishing, not for the first time, that he could go back in time and change it all.
‘Shit!’ Draco hissed suddenly, his hand coming to grip the base of his cock tightly, forcing Harry off him. ‘Was going to come,’ he explained at Harry’s curious look.
‘Everyone was fighting around me, but this time—this time the Death Eaters were winning,’ Harry said hesitantly. ‘I was trying to help, but I couldn’t. I was injured—my hip and my ribs, and I had a broken arm. I couldn’t run, couldn’t properly cast spells, couldn’t stop people getting hurt.’ Harry couldn’t prevent the way his voice cracked on the final words. The dream had been horrible, and all the pain he felt at not being able to save his loved ones during the war had come roaring back.
‘Uh, yeah, I’m fine,’ Harry said, shaking his head in an attempt to dispel his, quite frankly, disturbing thoughts about Malfoy, regretting it immediately as his head began to ache.
With the downstairs clear of curses, they moved upstairs, where thankfully there was a lot less work to do. The sky outside was beginning to darken, the early winter night starting to set in, the chilly winter air seeping in through the single-glazed windows enough to make Malfoy put his robes back on, to Harry’s slight dismay. Malfoy was clearly keen to get things finished off as soon as possible as he was working significantly faster than he had been earlier in the day. They’d worked through lunch, and Harry’s rumbling stomach pushed him to work quickly too, looking forward to getting home for dinner.
‘Yes, Slytherin thought that only pure-blood witches and wizards should be allowed to go to Hogwarts, but the other founders disagreed, so Muggle-borns and Half-bloods were allowed to come too. Lots of pure-bloods don’t like that, but they’re wrong,’ Draco looked intently at Teddy as he said this, wanting to make sure Teddy understood. ‘Everyone has a right to be at Hogwarts and learn how to use magic. I didn’t understand that when I was there, but when you go, make sure you welcome everyone and treat them the same.’
Harry thought he probably should try on his own—he couldn’t rely on having someone to help him once he got home—but he couldn’t resist having Malfoy’s arm wrapped around him once again. ‘I’m not sure,’ he said as he shakily pushed himself to his feet, and he thrilled as Malfoy immediately steadied him with a sure hand on his arm.
‘Of course. My mother’s parents insisted. There haven’t been many weddings here in recent years though, they were the last Blacks to marry here. I did attend a few weddings here as a child, but I can’t believe how dilapidated it’s got.’
After that, it became impossible for Harry to avoid thinking about Malfoy, and impossible for him to pretend that this was nothing more than just a quick blowjob to save his life. Thoughts of Malfoy plagued him from the moment he woke up, hard and aching from dreams filled with pale hair and long limbs, to the moment he drifted off at night. He tried to hide it, to keep his inner turmoil from Ginny, but Harry had a feeling he wasn’t hiding it very well. He found himself working late, his stomach curdling when the clock ticked towards five o’clock, automatically reaching for another report when he should have been packing up and heading home. It was safer to stay hidden away in his office, where he could let his thoughts wander as much as he wanted without worrying that Ginny would sense what he was thinking about.
And yet each week when Friday came, Harry headed to the pub, aware that he stood no chance of resisting Malfoy, and not caring anyway. Malfoy might not give any indication of his interest in Harry during the week, their interactions at work strictly professional, but once they were at the pub everything changed. Harry would make a point to sit far away from Malfoy and try and make conversation with the rest of his colleagues, pretending to be interested in the latest office gossip and Quidditch matches, all the while covertly glancing over at Malfoy, need growing with each look, each flash of lust in Malfoy’s eyes as their gaze met across the table.
This was tricky ground for them, and Harry took a moment to choose his words, not wanting to say anything that would cause Malfoy to clam up just when he was opening up to Harry.
‘Like this?’ Draco smirks, thrilling at the way Potter is looking at him. The bulge forming in Potter’s trousers hasn’t escaped Draco’s notice either, and his mouth waters as he pictures what’s hiding underneath the fabric.
Harry had suggested a trip to London Zoo, for reasons that he refused to share until he forced them all to stop in front of one specific tank in the Reptile House. There, in a quiet voice, he explained to both of them that this was one of the places it had all started for him, making Teddy burst out laughing as he described the snake incident. They’d had to leave the Reptile House in a hurry, both stifling laughter, as Teddy kept trying to speak Parseltongue to all the snakes in an attempt to replicate what Harry had done, and Draco and Harry were both afraid that either he would succeed, and a snake would indeed escape, or that one of them would inadvertently talk too loudly about magic and break the International Statute of Secrecy.
His second week at home, Harry attended his first training session, although only as a spectator. Oliver wanted him to start feeling like part of the team again, and watching the others train, seeing what plays they were practicing and where they were having issues, was part of that. Harry’s appearance at the grounds had been greeted by a huge cheer and plenty of hugs from his teammates, and that combined with watching them fly had excitement building inside him at the thought of being up there with them again soon.
What Draco does is get absolutely plastered. After insisting that he doesn’t want to talk about it anymore, he and Pansy begin to steadily make their way through several bottles of wine. Draco listens as Pansy regales him with scandalous stories of her life in Monaco, distracted for the first time from the undercurrent of sadness that has been present these last weeks. It’s good to have her here, and he makes a silent promise to not leave it so long between visits. Whatever he might like to think about his ability to look after himself, he needs his friends.
‘About your nightmare.’ When Harry didn’t immediately say anything, Malfoy continued, ‘I always found it helped, to talk about them. Made them feel less real, somehow.’
. And then he pushes his boxers down too, and he’s completely bare, with nothing to hide him from Potter’s hungry eyes.
‘Talk about what?’ Harry had no idea what Malfoy was talking about. Tiredness was beginning to creep over him again as the adrenaline from earlier faded.
That first year after the war, Harry had been almost paralysed with grief and a deep weariness, and only external pressures and the ever-present support of Ron, Hermione, and the Weasleys had kept him going through funerals and award presentations and countless other events he was roped into as the
Harry nodded, but as soon as Malfoy removed his hand, the pain crested again, and with a garbled yell, Harry lunged, grabbing on to the first part of Malfoy he could reach. Once again, as his hands gripped the fabric of Malfoy’s trousers, the pain became manageable, still present but not unbearable like it had been when Malfoy had let go of him.
‘Anyway,’ Malfoy continued, tone businesslike, ‘as I was saying, I’ve had an initial look around, and there’s more to do than I anticipated, so we need to hurry up. I can’t be late getting home tonight.’
‘Any hints that she was involved in—’ Harry broke off, suddenly unsure. This was shaky ground for them.
‘I put some owl treats out for Aurora, but can pop back ‘round in a few days if you’re still here,’ Hermione said, and Harry felt a surge of love for her and Ron for taking such good care of him even after all these years. He didn’t know where he’d be without them.
Draco didn’t know what to do, didn’t know how to get out of this without admitting that he wasn’t good enough to cast a Patronus, so he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and raised his wand, praying to any god he could think of that this time it would work.
‘Yes, well, the less said about him the better,’ Millie said, her nose screwed up in apparent distaste. ‘I imagine Draco’s been nagging you about your robes? I know what he’s like, and he’s going to want this to be perfect after waiting such a-’
Doing everything he can to hide the slight tremble in his hands, Draco begins to slowly undo the buttons of his shirt, watching the way that Potter’s intent gaze follows his fingers’ progress down his chest. When the final button is undone, Draco pauses for a moment, waiting until Potter’s eyes flick back up to his face, and then he shrugs the shirt off, revealing the pale expanse of his chest and stomach.
He knows Potter’s still in Paris. When he does venture out into the world, he can’t escape Potter’s face on the magazines and newspapers for sale in the kiosks that line the streets. Paris is apparently abuzz with excitement that Harry Potter has signed a deal with Les Pumas de Paris for an undisclosed sum.
‘I missed you, too,’ Malfoy said finally.  Those simple words were enough to make Harry’s heart soar, and then Malfoy leaned in, and Harry couldn’t hold back any longer.
‘I bet you are,’ Potter says after a beat, and his finger slides down to Draco’s arsehole again before pressing in slightly.
The robes Millie had made for him had been hanging in his wardrobe for several days, layers of protective spells surrounding them to ensure that they were still in pristine condition for the ball. With shaking hands he took them out and slowly put them on, marvelling at the wonder that Millie had created. He’d never had such well fitting robes - they clung to his frame without being indecent or overly showy, and still allowed him to move freely, not too baggy or constricting like some of his old robes. The material was soft and silky, and he let it run through his fingers, enjoying the way it felt. After much debate, they’d decided on a deep navy blue, with intricate silver stitching and small silver buttons down the front, and despite his initial misgivings about wearing something so fancy, Harry had never felt more himself. After desperately trying, and failing, to control his hair, Harry was ready. He had one last look in the mirror, trying to imagine how he would look through Draco’s eyes, and then took a deep breath, steeling himself, before leaving his house and apparating to the manor.
Draco didn’t see Narcissa again until their next weekly Sunday dinner—work really had become busy, the Aurors requiring a consult on a case that had seen him working more overtime than he had in years. He loved his job, had found meaning there that he had never expected to find in his life, but sometimes becoming an expert in a niche topic seemed to have been a terrible decision. He adored researching potions, discovering how to refine previously clunky recipes and eliminate side-effects, and found a particular pleasure in identifying ways to improve detection of unusual potions and even specific ingredients. Sometimes though, he wished he was slightly less devoted to his job—particularly on weeks where the Aurors decided he was absolutely the
‘No, Potter, it doesn’t look like she was involved with the Death Eaters.’ And then he added, with a sharp look over at Harry, ‘You can say it, you know. I’m aware of my own history, and the damage it caused.’
‘I thought I’d come and check up on you before I left for the night,’ Malfoy said when Harry didn’t speak, answering Harry’s unspoken question about his change of attire. ‘How are you feeling?’
Brief respite came in the form of dinner being delivered. Harry set to eating his fish pie with gusto, so grateful for something to break up the monotony of staring at the plain walls that he didn’t even care that the sauce was so thin it was essentially water and that the fish was chewy enough to make his jaw ache. As soon as the food was gone though, the boredom came roaring back with a vengeance, a pit of dread forming in Harry’s stomach at the prospect of the long, silent night that stretched ahead of him.
‘I suppose he has been looking more tired recently,’ Harry said slowly, as he realised that Esther was still looking at him. ‘He should have said something,’ he added, as he felt a sudden pang of guilt that his late night chats had led to Malfoy exhausting himself.
that Draco took him in fully, pulling out all his best moves in an attempt to drive Harry mad. Soon Harry was moaning loudly, his hand tight in Draco’s hair as he moved up and down. It was the best feeling Draco had ever experienced.
From that day on, they began to talk as Draco made Harry’s coffee, and Harry started occasionally sitting near the counter rather than over by the fireplace. It wasn’t always easy - sometimes their conversations were stilted, hesitant, their shared history still making itself known whenever conversation drifted towards their school days or the war. But they were getting on far better than Draco could have ever dreamed, and before long they were talking the whole time Harry was in the cafe, their conversations veering wildly from the book Harry was reading, to the latest Quidditch match, to what Harry might do now that he was no longer an Auror. Draco found himself making mental notes of things he saw during the day, at the cafe or out in the world, that he wanted to tell Harry, every situation or joke he heard making him wonder what Harry would think of it. Harry had taken up every inch of available space in Draco’s mind, becoming the first thing he thought of in the morning and the last thing on his mind as he fell asleep. It was driving Draco mad. He wanted nothing more than to reach across the counter and take Harry’s hand, but the new peace and tentative friendship was so fragile that he didn’t want to do anything to risk it. Having Harry go back to his armchair, or worse, never back into the cafe at all, made Draco ache just thinking about it.
‘So why did you decide to become a Quidditch player?’ Malfoy asked. ‘Despite the accusations I used to throw your way I’d have thought you’d have had more than enough of fame?’
‘It must be difficult, your job,’ Harry ventured. Malfoy clearly worked hard, and from everything Harry had seen over the past few days, he gave a lot of himself to the job. Perhaps to his own disadvantage, to judge by how tired he sometimes looked.
Her words had barely sunk in before she was gone, the front door slamming behind her, the echo painfully loud in the quiet kitchen. Harry dropped his head into his hands, grinding the heels of his palms into his eyes in an attempt to stem the tears that were threatening to fall. He’d known deep down that he wouldn’t get away with it for long, that he couldn’t go on seeing Malfoy and coming home to Ginny, but he hadn’t been prepared for how much it hurt to see Ginny that angry. He’d never set out to betray her, to make her feel a fool, but he’d been blinded by lust—and maybe more—and hadn’t been strong enough to make the right choice and stay away from Malfoy.
and immediately ended up with pages and pages of Google results. He scrolled through them all, making a note of places that seemed interesting enough to capture Teddy’s imagination. He’d soon filled a page of his notebook with ideas, and resolved to take Teddy to one of them the following weekend.
In Draco’s fantasies, Potter had always been good at this—who would fantasise about bad sex, after all?—but this is different, better, more intense. Every nerve is aflame as Potter bottoms out, deep inside Draco. Potter’s still got his trousers on, and the denim rubs against Draco’s arse, sparking sensations that contrast with the gentle way Potter’s thumb is stroking Draco’s hip. Draco’s shaking already, and they haven’t even really started.
Draco and Andromeda watched Harry and Teddy wrestle for ten minutes or so, Draco drinking his tea and chatting with Andromeda as they waited for the fight to come to a conclusion. It gave Draco a good opportunity to properly look at Harry while his attention was otherwise occupied. Draco had seen Harry a few times over the past few years, passing each other in the halls of the Ministry and at several painful services to commemorate the end of the war. Draco hadn’t had a chance to look at him this closely though since Harry had provided testimony to support Draco at his trial. Harry had been a shell of a man then, drained and nearly dead on his feet; the large dark bags under his eyes and the way his clothes hung off his too skinny frame spoke eloquently of too many funerals, too much attention, too much grief.
‘It’s amazing,’ Harry said, making Draco jump. Harry had slipped to the back of his mind as he helped Teddy find the magic, and his reappearance at Draco’s side came as a surprise. ‘What is this place?’ Harry added.
‘Eloquent as ever, Potter,’ Malfoy said with a low laugh, that, combined with the use of his surname, made something hot coil in Harry’s stomach. ‘But yes, it was shit. I don’t know what I would have done without Pansy when they were at their worst.’
making him loopy when he suddenly thought how pretty Malfoy’s eyes were. ‘Are you sure you still don’t want any?’
Harry chuckled weakly, and told Ron to thank Arthur for him. He loved Molly, but he didn’t think he was up to her level of well-meaning attention and care right now.
‘Ok,’ Ginny said, but she didn’t look convinced. ‘I’m going to bed, don’t stay up too late—you need to sleep when you’ve used that much magic.’ At Ginny’s concern, a lump formed in Harry’s throat, and he could only nod to her in response, too afraid that if he opened his mouth to speak he’d cry, or worse, confess everything.
‘Nah, it’ll still go down in history as one of the best chases,’ Ron reassured him. ‘The commentators were going crazy, couldn’t stop talking about you, even after Thorebourne actually caught the Snitch.’
‘Save it, Harry,’ Ginny interrupted his apologies. ‘The curse I can get, just, although you should have told me. But you didn’t, and you kept going. You kept seeing him, fucking him, falling for him, and said nothing to me, expecting me to not notice anything, like I wouldn’t notice my husband avoiding me.’ Ginny’s voice got louder as she spoke until she was shouting again.
‘But—but—’ Harry was struggling to think over the throbbing pain in his hip. ‘You hate me. We hate each other. Why should I trust you to treat me?’
The world narrows to the sensation of his cock sinking into Draco again and again, the drag perfect and intoxicating and almost too much, but definitely the best thing Harry has ever felt. He’s sweating again, hot in his robes but unwilling to pause long enough to take them off, his hand snaking up under Draco’s shirt as he searches for skin. The roughness of the wall underneath his fingers and the weight of his robes on his back make the whole thing feel somehow even more illicit, which only serves to make Harry move faster, his thrusts spurred on by the string of swear words escaping Draco.
‘I suppose you’re used to training all the time?’ Malfoy said, glancing over at Harry with a glimmer of curiosity in his eyes.
Ginny came into the kitchen as Harry was forcing down the last few bites of his dinner. She was in her pyjamas, her long hair plaited ready for bed as it was every night, and the sight made his heart hurt. This was all he’d wanted for so long, a happy home with the woman he loved, and this should have made him smile, should have made him want to follow Ginny upstairs to the bed they shared, but now all he could think of was how he’d put it all at risk.
At Malfoy’s nod he undid the button, fingers fumbling slightly as he made his way down the shirt, revealing skin and taut muscles. Harry’s hands lingered briefly over the thin white lines that criss-crossed Malfoy’s chest, and he opened his mouth to say something, but Malfoy captured his mouth in a kiss before he could.
Draco could only nod as he took a small step forward, closing the remaining space between them, reaching out a trembling hand to rest on Harry’s hip. Their first kiss was gentle, soft, and even better than Draco could have dreamed. They exchanged small, tentative kisses for a moment, and then Harry’s tongue swept across Draco’s lip, and Draco sighed into the touch, his hand automatically gripping Harry’s hip tighter. That drew a moan from Harry, and then suddenly they were kissing properly, deeply, passionately. Draco slid his other arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him in, a rush of pleasure shooting through Draco at the feel of Harry’s broad chest against his. Harry’s hand slid up to tangle in Draco’s hair, and he slowly walked Draco backwards, pressing him against the counter, Harry’s hips coming into contact with Draco’s for the first time. Draco couldn’t help but press up into Harry, his hips bucking automatically at the delicious pressure, his blood on fire as they continued to kiss. Things would have progressed much further, as Draco desperately wanted, if it weren’t for the sound of footsteps coming down the hallway.
