Let me know if that works.
Dada Harry
"Don't," Harry growls in Draco's ear.
Draco finally takes the initiative to say goodbye.
?” Harry adds a little eyebrow flick to emphasize the true meaning of his question.
“Can I learn too?”
We miss you and we love you.
Draco seems surprised by the invite, then pleased.
“Right.” Harry schools his features, determined not to make even more of a fool of himself.
They make out some more, slowly getting back to the silly happiness of before the predictions. When Draco starts to flail a bit, Harry instantly insists they stop for lunch. Draco first pretends to be appalled at the idea of eating greasy fish and chips on a wooden table. Soon, though, he’s devouring his meal with gusto, grease smearing his cheek in the most adorable way. Love bursts in Harry’s chest, it happens a lot these days.
“Well, does that mean I can call you Draco?”
Draco nods. There’s nothing much to say to that anyway. Teddy’s turning ten this year, but the hole in Harry’s heart where Remus used to be, is still gaping wide open.
Yours,
Draco starts fucking Harry in earnest, they’re both flushed and sweaty, moaning continously. When Draco goes to touch Harry’s cock, Harry slaps his hand away.
Malfoy succeeds in rolling his eyes, sighing and shaking his head, all at the same time.
Gone is the sadness, anger now burns under Harry’s skin.
The ring sounds exquisite, I’m quite certain Draco will love it. Please let me know how the proposal goes. I’m not sure you’ll be able to finish asking the question before he says ‘yes’.
Dear Harry,
“I’m not little, Uncle Draco, I’m five.” He says sullenly.
"I think I'd like it."
“You stay there, and stop repeating that!”
“Yes, thank you, that would be nice. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen little Edward.”
Best,
"Ow! Fuck, Harry."
“My Dad! We have to go back!”
"Okay?"
Harry's blush is all the answer Draco needs.
Fire lights up Draco’s eyes, and Harry’s mad at himself for the relief he feels at the sight.
Without waiting any longer, he takes Draco’s cock in his mouth, suckling on the head for a minute before relaxing his jaw and throat and letting it slide further in his mouth. Draco’s hand flies to Harry’s hair and grasps it tight. Harry moans around Draco’s prick. He loves to be manhandled a little, and of course Draco would be the one to figure it out without being told. Draco reacts with a moan of his own, the sound directly going to Harry’s painful erection.
I enjoyed meeting Little James. He was very well behaved, unlike his father (it is a joke - yes I can make them too). I have put the picture on my fridge as Muggles do, so Edward now has company.
and I have my friends. It is enough for now.
“Yes, I can see how that’s messed up.” He admits.
Prompt "Hope is a heartache"
They have managed to avoid each other so far. Draco took his wine to the kitchen and spent a suspiciously long time with Blaise. Harry’s not jealous, it’s just bad etiquette to spend so much time cooped up away from your host. During the meal, Hermione and Neville tried to force them to sit next to each other, but two Gryffindors are no match for a Slytherin and a half. Draco managed to sit at one end of the table next to Luna and Ginny. Harry is next to Blaise, and he’s not throwing daggers his way, not at all.
Draco
"Anything love, anything you want."
Potter,
Prompt "First time"
Might be considered rated M (only implied)
“What was I saying then?”
What's going on? I'm getting worried. Jamie
Jamie just woke up from his nap, duty calls.
A litany of “Harry, Harry, Harry” coming from Draco’s mouth alerts Harry of the blond’s impending climax.
“Harry, I’m not sure I can handle it.”
my reputation, but I have had a solid clientele for a few years now. I converted one of our drawing rooms into a classroom.
is the French for ‘Slytherin’.”
“Yes, come.” Mind still in the gutter, Harry chokes on his own saliva. “Err, what?”
"Are you going to ask again?"
“Right. It’s just I don’t usually fuck my friends, so…”
“Oh right. So, no. Hermione wants us to wait until she’s born. Apparently it’s bad luck to buy anything before then.”
“What? Is everything alright?”
"During our last cooking session."
Harry places a hand on Draco’s hip and pulls. Draco’s body crashes into Harry.
“Auror Marcus! Another remark and you’re out. Understood?”
“He’s coming with us.”
A loud crack later and they're standing in the bedroom. Draco raises an eyebrow at Harry, who has the decency to blush.
“Yes!
“Give this message to Draco : you were right, we found them. I’ll bring Scorpius back soon, hang in there.”
I want you to be happy Draco, that's all I want.
“Oh.”
today, whatever that is - and answers with a frown on his face.
D. L. Malfoy
Sincerely,
"More than okay, love. Anything you want."
"Fuck," Draco says again, well aware that he fucked it all up.
Harry considers getting up, he can probably find a better use of his time than tossing and turning. Or he could try taking Dreamless Sleep, again.
“Yes Conley?”
Malfoy,
Do you ever think about having one of your own? Sorry, that’s probably way too personal, you don’t have to answer.
"Sorry sorry," Harry mumbles, still kissing Draco's neck. The snogging continues for a bit and Draco gets back into it. But suddenly, Harry is violently pulling on his clothes - like he can't wait another minute before touching skin - and Draco hears the painful noise of expensive fabric tearing.
I’m not the one who - you know what? Never mind. I’m sorry he’s unhappy but it doesn’t change anything. He broke my heart Nev.”
"Doesn't mean you should have to."
Draco
“Really? Is that a Muggle thing?” Draco asks, an excited glint in his eyes. He's learnt a lot about Muggles these last few years, but he's insatiable.
Potter,
“Well mostly I’ll talk and you’ll repeat. As our first topic, I chose the world of magic.” Malfoy seems to be waiting for something then. “Well, is that okay for you?”
“Okay, everybody’s clear? Let’s go.”
He bobs his head up and down Draco’s cock a few times before he hears Draco call his name.
When Draco's trousers are opened, Harry hooks his thumbs in the waistband of Draco's pants and pulls. In mere seconds, Draco's naked from the waist down and Harry's face is right into his groin.
Draco’s face seems to reflect Harry’s disappointment for a minute.
The DMLE is separated into two groups. The one that believes this case should not be prioritized because the Malfoys got what they deserved; the other one, more important thankfully, advocates that the war is long past and an innocent kid's life is at stake. Sam, of course, belongs to the second group. Both his parents fought in the war and died - probably another reason why he's so drawn to Potter - still, justice has been done already, reparations paid, sentences served. The country has moved on, as it should have.
Anyway, sorry to be that kind of father but I’ve attached a picture of James, in case you wanted to see him. This was his first smile. People say he looks like me
You'll find attached all relevant information as well as a RSVP slip.
I keep thinking that you must know how I feel, how could you not? So, tell me what to do?
In any case, please find attached instructions given by my house-elf Mifty to remove body fluids from your clothes.
Prompt "First time"
That night, the bedroom is filled with laughter, the bed is warm and smells of Draco and sex.
I have an emergency with Alex. He got into a fight at school and knocked someone out. He’s really upset, he says he never wants to go to Hogwarts and wants his magic taken away.
For all that you do.
I don't need to remind you that this day is for Muggle parents who need to be reassured that their children will be in good hands. I will then ask you to refrain from causing any troubles like the ones you got into during your time with us.
My warmest regards,
“Err, yes
I reckon you should be really happy your child is finally sleeping, no? Congratulations to you both on this achievement (and no I’m not being sarcastic, I’ve come to understand that this is an important step).
Not that you're not allowed to, of course! Do I know him?
Harry nods, still relishing the thought that Draco might also be attracted to him.
When it’s time for dessert, all their strategies tank. Luna fakes an issue with the cake that only Draco can fix, while Hermione uses her ‘I’m ready to burst’ card for a glass of something that apparently can’t be conjured. Long story short, Luna disappears somewhere and Draco and Harry end up alone in the kitchen. They haven’t been alone in the same room since the day Draco came to their flat to grab a few things. They had not shared a word that day, barely a look.
"They were Sirius's from back at Hogwarts. Remus figured out how to get a CD player to work and my mum bought him some each year for his birthday."
Hermione had given him a book a few years ago that was supposed to help him achieve maximum happiness. The book basically said that as long as you keep living, you'll have spikes of happiness after achieving goals and there are ways to be happier for a bit, but your general level of happiness will always remain consistent. Harry thought it was bullshit and Ron had helped him use the copy to make paper aeroplanes, much to Hermione's chagrin.
"Would you stop staring at me?"
"You think he should know?"
Malfoy stiffened. "Not... officially. The year I graduated Hogwarts was rather busy and I was predisposed during the next year."
"Whatever. If you see him again-"
Harry took it all back. Zabini wasn't that attractive, even if when he turned around to open the chamber door, Harry could admit to taking a peek at his arse.
"I will never feel safe. Not in my own home, not anywhere. I'm afraid that learning who killed Draco's father would only bring him more pain."
He was five minutes late when he arrived but the woman who greeted him, Lorelai, told him he shouldn't worry as they wouldn't be starting for another ten.
They talked for a while longer and Harry could see Malfoy wanting to be excited about it all. He went to bed that night wondering how Malfoy could be so good at understanding Potions and so bad at understanding himself.
Ron and Ginny took up residence at Grimmauld Place, huddling together when it all got to be too much. The burrow was a mess, they'd said, and Harry hadn't thought twice about offering. With both twins gone, Mrs Weasley was torn to shreds, barely holding it together. As much as Ron and Ginny needed to be away from that, though, he knew they were really there because they worried about him too.
Harry got to the shop the next morning at 8:50, carrying three piping-hot takeaway cups with him.
"Look I'm really sorry, I just-"
Harry raised his eyebrows in question.
"Did you not go to Hogwarts?"
The ball was in the Ministry's biggest room. The music playing wasn't the typical ballroom music, and he remembered that the current organizer was trying to combine muggle and wizarding culture. The band switched from something muggle he didn't recognise to A Cauldron Full Of Hot, Strong Love. There were tables along every wall, decked out with the finest foods and alcohol, and practically everyone Harry had ever met was there. The crowd turned to look at them and Harry thought at first they were admiring his date before realising they were just shocked to see him at a public function so close to his last one. Alicia didn't seem to mind the attention, but she let him drag her over to a table with people he knew wouldn't spend the evening fawning over him.
"I know. That's what started the fight."
Ginny groaned. "Why do you hate us? We have never been anything but kind to you. Took you in for the Holidays, let you eat mum's cooking, I even sucked you off once."
"Salazar, you're such a Gryffindor. Okay, yes, please. Anything."
Oh, Merlin, Draco Malfoy was in his house.
The kettle began to whistle and he hurried through the process of making tea, feeling very watched as he did so.
"Yes."
"Oh there's no need, boy, I can do that."
Malfoy snorted and walked to his room. Harry went inside his and immediately owled Hermione. It would be a while till she responded.
Harry pulled the tissue he'd grabbed off the bathroom floor out of his pocket and grinned.
"He's—" Harry realised that he probably scared her. When he'd called to tell her the news about George, because no one else had the strength to do it, it'd been a bit like this too. "He's fine, Mione. I'm sorry, I know I usually call later, but I was too keyed up.
"Don't you look cheery this morning!"
"And then what? We'd dance together like fourth years at the Yule Ball? If it makes any difference, we already discussed the possibility of one of us being romantically interested in the other and neither one of us is. It's simple."
He laughed, taking a long sip and clearing his throat. "What gives you the idea that Goyle's a great conversationalist?"
He tested Patricia Gibson's tissue next. It came back negative. So that was it then, wasn't it? He'd already decided that it was wrong to test the candy wrapper and yet...
"She's my mum," he said, and that was enough. He collapsed into her arms.
The inside of the courtroom was mostly empty, but it looked only moderately less intimidating than the one he'd been in before fifth year. It had the same low benches and black stone as that one, with identical torches lighting the faces of the witches and wizards who were present.
"When you see him again, try not to be all obsessive about it. So, he isn't your soulmate, that's no surprise. You two being mates though isn't impossible to imagine."
"Okay," Ron said, "but you have to go out with the ones I send to you. Without looking at their profiles first."
A second later, Ron's freckled face popped out from the doorway.
"Bollocks. That's exactly what he told me." Malfoy stubbed out his cigarette and lit another one. Hermione would kill him if he came over with the smell still on him. Harry didn't mind much, though. It reminded him of Sirius.
Draco wants nothing more than to go back in time to the moment before he decided to have this conversation. The frown on Harry's face is killing him. He knew it would be hard for Harry to understand this, what with the way he was raised, without love or tenderness. The thing is Draco relishes a loving touch, a soft smile, a string of hair put back behind his ear. It's only sometimes that he wished Harry would just take him, push him against a wall and ravish him. No "is that alright?", no "can I?". Just pure, rough sexual need, harsh hands and biting teeth.
D. L. Malfoy
I wish you the best of birthdays! I’m so honoured to have blown that first candle with you this morning.
“Well, like I said, snobs.”
“Err,
happy. So I left. It broke
"Yeah, yes I believe you."
Draco takes one nipple in his mouth and bites a little.
", Draco orders, pointing at his trousers with his chin. Harry can't get them open fast enough. His hands are trembling slightly from anticipation.
They finally reach their destination and Harry throws caution to the wind. He leans in toward Draco and takes hold of his bicep. Very briefly, their lips meet and Draco gasps his surprise at Harry’s boldness.
As for my tutoring business, I’ll have you know that it’s nothing like what I had growing up. My students are mostly Muggle-born.
“I was angry and devastated. You shutting me out, it just fed into whatever story I had told myself. You didn’t really want me. You wanted the idea of someone, of a family.”
, Draco thinks. Harry pushes a hand in his hair and tugs sharply. Draco cries out from the pain of it, tears springing to his eyes.
Thank you for the picture, he is indeed quite lovely. Honestly, I don’t really get how people can tell who an infant looks like. His hair seems definitely wild enough to be yours.
Harry’s confused now. “Wait, but they don’t have Hogwarts in France do they?”
I hope all is well with you,
"Well, who am I to deny you?", he pauses, then in a commanding tone.
"Fuck me then. Just take me, I'm yours."
Headmistress McGonagall
“Yes, thank you, I’ll look at them later.”
” Harry groans. If he thought Draco speaking French was hot, Draco talking dirty to him in French is almost enough to make him come in his pants like a fucking virgin.
“Fuck.”
Harry.”
It was such a surprise to run into you in Diagon Alley yesterday! Jamie and I just started going out together. The press is still a little bit crazy over the whole thing and Jamie isn’t too keen on being crowded by photographers.
“Well, I’m trying to Teddy, Uncle Draco is teaching me.”
cashmere!"
“Hermione and Ron! For the baby.”
Jamie’s photo album.
It is, for me. When we started exchanging - sometimes heated - letters, I thought I had everything I would ever have. My family, my job, a few acquaintances. Then, you and James barrelled into my life and it was as if I never had anything to begin with.
Draco flushes adorably under the dim lights of the restaurant.
“We have a lead! A group of vigilantes tried to abduct Pansy Parkinson’s daughter. We found Scorpius’s wand in their hidden base. Conley,” he says addressing Sam “you’re with Weasley, you’re interrogating the three suspects we caught. Marcus, you’re with me, we’re going back to the lair to look for clues as to where they’re keeping Scorpius.”
James Arthur Potter
“You ask for the
.” Harry answers shyly. He’s not too sure about what to do with his limbs. Should he sit? Should he greet Draco with another kiss on his cheek? He hasn’t mustered the courage to do so since the first time he did, and he’s been dying from the desire to feel Draco’s skin under his lips once more.
is the bread!”
Can we meet tomorrow? I’ll leave Jamie with Molly for the day.
Malfoy leaves with a muttered “Goodbye” and Harry’s place suddenly feels way too empty. To distract himself, he floo’s over to Ron and Hermione.
Harry Potter
“I’m … sorry, too.”
I'll wait for you
He’s four month old today. It’s crazy how fast it all goes. I look at him and he’s so big already. He looks at me, he smiles, he’s grabbing stuff. Soon he’ll roll over and start to crawl.
“We have them in our sight. Scorpius is fine. We are attacking now, join us fast!”
Harry grabs Draco’s hand and leads them towards the little booth. There’s a line, so they wait, sometimes laughing, but mostly kissing. The psychic has to clear her throat for the two men to realize it’s their turn. They enter the booth and take a seat at the ridiculously little table, their knees pressed tightly together. The lady looks about ninety-years old. She’s wearing a flower dress underneath at least five silk scarves that are draped around her. Her hair is tied into a tight bun at the back of her head, accentuating her severe appearance. When she draws the first card, Harry notices the tattoo on her forearm. A bouquet of lilies. He smiles. Maybe he’ll learn a thing or two after all.
He can tell Harry's close with the way his knuckles whiten and his breath quickens. Just when Draco feels Harry's ball tighten, orgasm impeding, Harry pulls out and strokes himself in fast tugs. Draco mimics his movement on his own prick and soon enough Harry's coming on Draco's pale skin, his mouth, his chest. A second later, Draco's cock erupts in a second powerful orgasm. Draco falls forward with the force of it and blacks out for a minute.
As always when either he or Draco talk to him in French, Teddy smiles his biggest smile - the one that both warms Harry's heart and breaks it for how much he wishes his godson's parents were around to witness it.
? What is there to explain?!
“Oh save me the sap story about how you were so famous that no one cared if you actually learnt anything. Malfoys don’t give up. We’ll just try something different. Let’s meet again tomorrow, my place.”
my heart though.
Prompt : Wolf
Sam knows of Malfoy and Potter's past, of course. At least, he thinks he does. The tension between the two feels bigger than old school rivalry and generic war grudges. It feels very personal.
“Poultry?” Harry stutters. “Okay, what are you talking about?”
Harry scoffs, “That sounds filthy.”
Fondly,
about how he spent his first three years in Hogwarts freezing to death because of the harsh Scottish weather. Harry has half a mind to apparate them there right this instant.
, what kind of mess is he in?
Dear Potter,
!” Harry’s eyes pop out of their sockets. “What?!”
“Draco?”
"Wait until your cock is in my arse, I'll be screaming then."
“Yes, like Trelawney. Wasn’t she the one to give that Prophecy about you?”
, that
Draco says laughing,
The day he decides they really need to talk is the day Harry tries again.
Perhaps you could come by the house some day? I could show you my father’s cloak like we discussed.
Harry takes a moment before answering. Draco and he have agreed to keep the past in the past, but they’re treading dangerous territory there. The Prophecy, fifth year, Sirius death, Lucius going to Azkaban… Harry really doesn’t want to get into this right now.
delicious.
“The spirits can’t say. It’s dangerous to mess with the future.” She’s looking straight at Harry when she says that, it makes him really uncomfortable, like maybe she knows how he sometimes bent the rules of time in the past. She can’t though, can she? She’s a fake, just spouting platitudes to gullible tourists.
When Harry starts to feel like his head is full of
Draco grabs the cookbook and searches for something. He finds it quickly and pushes the book at Harry’s face.
Harry definitely hears reluctance in his voice, so without really thinking about it, he offers: “Or, maybe you could just join us?”
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you or Little James.
Yours,
"For you to, you know, do the same thing. To me."
Harry's heart misses a beat at hearing Draco so casually mention taking his name.
Thank you though.
"What do you imagine when you're thinking about this? Because you do, right? Think about doing this."
off of his spoon, ignoring - or pretending to ignore - Harry’s reaction to the gesture. Harry’s not sure how, but somehow they manage to brush their hands together several times, each time with more intent than the previous one. Harry’s whole body is electrified, butterflies roaming free in his belly. He’s never felt like this, he's sure.
You’re working with Muggles and Muggleborns, trying to make their lives better, shaping young minds into amazing wizards and witches. You seem happy with your life.
Harry thinks about this for a minute and the Gryffindor inside him decides to just go for it.
Harry risks a glance in Draco’s direction, he’s looking for a reaction on the blond’s face. Does the thought of having a family with Harry scare him? Excite him? Harry’s equally afraid and impatient to find out.
“What’s that?” Harry asks. He’s usually not a picky eater but the thought of snails or frogs sort of grosses him out. He says so to Draco who laughs,
Dear Harry,
Warm regards,
"Sit up."
He grabs his son and holds him tight. His face doesn’t reflect any of the contempt or boredom that Sam has always witnessed until now. Relief, concern and love are etched all over his features instead.
“Correct, so?”
“The psychic - “
My initial plan was to stop the ceremony, convince you to go away with me. I know
The timing was never right and well, there’s also the fact that I like blokes
“Malfoy’s coming, either you get on board or you can go back to the office. What will it be?”
Do you think other kids will make fun of me for having two dads? I know Dad said that because of my name, everybody will want to be my friend but…
I saw you today. I saw you holding her hands and accept the bound.
If you wake up one day and your heart and body are calling for mine, you come find me.
Harry is so hard already he can feel the dampness in his own pants. The combination of Draco's dominant posture and the way he sounds in French is making Harry lose all his self control. He obeys quickly though, reaching out a tentative hand and wrapping it around Draco's length.
Do you remember how it was for you? I did have a little experience with Teddy but that was different with his lycanthropy and metamorphmagus abilities. I wasn't there a lot for him at that time though.
Malfoy seems to think about it for a minute then nods solemnly. The interview starts again with a list of known enemies, of friends of Scorpius and a review of the timeline. In the absence of ransom or signature, they rule out a willing disappearance. Malfoy assures them that Scorpius and he are really close and that he wouldn’t leave like this. The mess they found in the house corroborating his testimony.
Jamie crawled today. I thought you'd want to know.
Prompt : Pretend
Mention of previous bad bottoming experience, dirty talk.
“Nothing,” Harry stammers, “just a little nervous, I guess.”
Harry uses his other hand to slap Draco's right cheek.
) and a salad. It all looks delicious and Harry’s salivating.
“Not okay. Not even close.”
“Okay.” He smiles.
He comes to to the sensation of Harry's tongue lapping at the come all over his body. When he's all cleaned, Harry gathers him in his arms and holds him for a very long time.
"Oh I am?" Draco smirks, pleased. Gone is the hesitant man that offered to leave not fifteen minutes ago.
“Between the two of us, we’ve surely accumulated lots of crappy years.” He stage-whispers to Draco, who rolls his eyes at Harry's antics.
Weasley and Potter share an intense look that drags on for long seconds. Sam is just waiting on the sidelines, eager to see how this is going to play out.
“I love you”, he whispers against Draco’s lips.
“The polite answer, Potter, would be ….?”
“You’re joking, right? You want to go see that crook?”
Prompt "Flood"
“Uncle Harry said a bad word!”
"No, it's not like that! I just don't want you to doubt me or my motivations. If you want forever without a ring, then that's what you'll get."
You don't have to come, I'll keep you updated.
(Purebloods). This last one mentioned a bit shyly by Malfoy. They end up listing charms and spells that have different names in French.
, Harry thinks.
“Oh okay. So, should we reschedule?”
Mr Malfoy has asked me to extend an invitation to Hogwarts's Open Day on the 24th to you and young James Arthur Potter.
” Draco’s face alights when Harry’s switches to French without being prompted and Harry revels in the warmth spreading in his body knowing he’s pleased Draco.
“Auror Conley, we have Mr. Malfoy in interrogation room 2, we need you to sit in on the interview and take notes. We start in ten minutes.”
Prompt "Laugh"
"Scarhead."
They start cutting (
You bring me so much joy, the both of you. I know he’s not mine in the way of science and law, but in all the other ways … Ginny is his mother of course but I like to think that I’m a third parent to him? Whether that’s true or not, in my heart he’s mine Harry, and ours. I hope it’s okay.
"Yeah, is that okay?"
After that, the lesson flows easily. Harry learns about
Papa,
Please.
“Edward says he’s hungry. Perhaps this would be the right occasion for that
He goes up Harry’s chest and mouths along his collarbone. When he reaches Harry’s neck, Draco bites hard.
"Remove your shirt."
"But I want it. The ring I mean, the wedding, being Draco Malfoy-Potter."
What about you? Do you plan on returning to the Ministry soon?
“Most of the people I ever loved and that loved me only live in my head. I have so many ghosts, Draco, and for so long I thought that’s all I would have. But then you, you barrelled into my life with your witty repartee, your devilish smile, your amazing generosity and you showered me with love and care.”
“Err, where exactly?”
Sorry about that. Turns out Jamie slept through the night for the first time. I did take him to St Mungos, I believe they’re still laughing about it. Anyway, sorry to have bothered you
Draco, having finally caught his breath, grabs Harry's hands and pulls him on the couch beside him. Seeing that Harry's still muttering and not totally there with him, Draco puts both his hands on Harry's face and forces the brunet to look at him.
All is well.
"Would you - I mean - do you think, err."
Malfoy crosses his arms on his chest and raises an eyebrow expectantly.
“Oh come on Malfoy, we’re not at Hogwarts anymore.”
“No, they don’t, they have Beauxbatons. Surely you remember them from fourth year. And didn’t one of the Weasleys land himself a Beauxbatons girl?”
“He’s my son, Harry. I’m not waiting on the sidelines while you do the heavy lifting. Not this time.”
. The thing is, Malfoy’s fit, sure, but what really makes Harry stare when he’s in a room is the way he carries himself. One would think that after the War, Malfoy would have been trying to make himself scarce. Well, not at all. When Malfoy enters a room, it’s with head held high, shoulders rolled back and a charming smirk on his face. He’s also as snarky as ever, although in a funny way, less mean than before. And now, Malfoy is helping him when clearly he has no obligations to. This is all very confusing to Harry.
Potter,
Harry wants to roll his eyes again but refrains. “Yes, like Trelawney?”
Their conversation is strained, like they’re both equally nervous. After twenty minutes of what can only be called awkward small talk, Harry decides to just suck it up and ask.
Dear Little James,
And then your letter came.
“Merlin, my ears are bleeding! Malfoy just lift the damn bar, okay? And stop talking like you’re fucking, it makes me want to puke!”
Despite Harry’s insistence, Draco adds another finger and keeps stretching Harry. It’s only when Harry whines “now, now Draco!” that he relents and prepares himself.
He gets there shamefully early and paces in the nearby alley before the time comes. Draco is already here, which is a relief.
It’s crazy. Only a few months ago, he had everything, he was happy like he’d never been before. Now, he’s just going through the motions. Getting up, going to work, visiting Ron and Hermione so that they know he’s still alive, staying awake all night. Rinse and repeat. He can see the dark shadows under his eyes in the mirror, the way he looks washed out. Some say he should just stop wallowing, just get out of this funk he’s in and move on. These people don’t know what it’s like to be in love with Draco Malfoy.
Draco inhales sharply, like he’s been punched in the gut.
why you were asking? I thought it was about cooking. The
“Err, what?”
"Oh sorry. Head Auror Scarhead."
As for what I am doing with my life, as you so eloquently put it, I am tutoring young children before they start their education at Hogwarts. It was difficult at first given
"Harry, let's forget about this. We don't have to, it's perfectly fine," Draco says, ignoring Harry's last question completely.
“Okay, yeah.” Harry’s not sure if he’s relieved or even more anxious.
Harry scoffs,
Anyway, things got heated after that. When I thought the worst had passed, my father told me he had finalized a deal with the Greengrasses. You remember Daphne, right? They want me to marry her younger sister Astoria. Apparently, it's time I act like the proper Malfoy heir, and not some rebellious ungrateful son (sic Lucius).
Astoria, I want you to be happy.
Harry, defeated, whispers again, "I'm sorry."
“Seers are real, you know.”
Hugo said you weren’t even my father. I know you’re not really but I would like you to be. I like Ginny but you’re the one tucking me in at night, and teaching me how to brew and speak French. Would it be okay if I asked to be your son? Legally I mean? Dad says if you agree we could work something out.
. Then two calloused fingers probe at Draco's hole and enter him swiftly. It burns a little but it doesn't register with Draco, all he can feel is Harry's strong body pining him down and the way he uses all his body's strength to fuck into him with his fingers. Each of Draco's exhales ends with a cry. The fact that Harry's still completely dressed behind him only heightening his arousal. It's barely a minute before Draco hears the tell tale sound of a fly opening. Harry's not even going to undress is he? Sure enough, Draco feels the blunt head of Harry's large cock catching his rim and the scratchy fabric of Harry's trousers on his arse.
Warmly,
In hindsight, Draco probably shouldn't have yelled like that for some damn clothes, but the day had caught up with him and he had snapped. He can see the moment Harry deflates and shuts himself off.
Draco seems unsettled for a second, and then answers surprisingly warmly.
“What’s going to happen?”, he asks.
Draco
Harry leans in and kisses Draco sweetly.
He fights Harry's grip on his head and once free, falls forward elbows on his knees and head in his hands. His breathing is frantic, throat sore already.
“Okay. I’m sorry I didn’t listen to what you had to say before today. I’m sorry you thought I didn’t love you.”
“Well, you asked, didn’t you?”
After about ten minutes of intense snogging, Draco leans back and looks Harry straight in the eyes. His hair is completely disheveled, his lips puffy and red from the kissing.
I'm sorry I must be boring you with my tedious new father's tales. You don't have to write back.
? Cabbage, why?"
Draco looks shocked for a second and recovers quickly.
“So, hum, how are you?”
Two hours have gone by and Harry has never felt more enthralled by a lesson before - with the exception of Third Year DADA with Remus. It turns out, Malfoy is nothing like the pretentious git Harry always thought he was. Sure, he’s very knowledgeable and isn’t afraid to show it, but he’s also very funny and, judging by his commitment to getting Harry to speak French, very generous. On top of that, well, he’s gorgeous. Harry knew he was fit, but now that he’s seen Malfoy joke and laugh and blush -
"Extra small, sir."
Submissives are more caring, they have sharper senses, and they are known to be quick to protect their mate(s) or (deemed worthy) family. They adore being praised by their mate in anyway, as well as affection. They are usually shorter, but not always. They usually have brighter eyes and a natural elegant-yet-loving aura about them.
The sleepy boy quietly grabbed a soft, silver blanket before he shuffled to the emerald colored chaise closest to the fireplace. The soft crackling noise comforted the boy as he curled up. His mind briefly wondered how the Slytherins would react to the "golden boy" sleeping in their common room. He decided he would simply wake up early, leave a small thank you note, and clean up before leaving. If Professor Snape still wanted to punish him, he would understand, but for now he just wanted rest. The small boy drifted into sleep, this time having a pleasant dream about snakes.
This has nothing to do with s3x in this story ! Only about the role in the relationship they take.
"W-Well I get to hang out with you guys of course. Y-You all seem really nice."
"I think sso! I hope he'ss doing alright."
Snape said, emphasizing the word brat.  He saw as a few students finally snapped out of their trance and started whispering amongst each other.
Harry said softly, he didn't notice the hall move on and begin talking amongst themselves. He also didn't hear some of his new house coo at his smile.
He hissed back, lowering his eyes, flustered by the others concern and all the eyes on him.
"Yeah, yeah. I'll finish up here soon enough."
Fuck him. Fuck him and his stupid hair and his stupid flat and everything about his stupid life.
Harry's cheeks flamed and Malfoy snickered.
"Well, I'm Harry. I like Quidditch and hanging out with my friends. I was a Gryffindor at school and I've always loved Defensive magic. I have a crup named Barkley."
"Just listen. It's a great way to gauge consumer interest, it gives you a solid deadline, you can introduce new products easily, and plenty of people will be interested in seeing what all the fuss is about."
"Can't you just owl Skeeter and ask for a press release? I'm sure it'd be packed in days."
"Yes, Potter, obviously I will be there too." His scowl softened ever so slightly, and Harry couldn't stop staring at it.
Most sincerely,
"So not my boyfriend."
Third came the makeover. Not of himself, thankfully (though Hermione had been hinting at her desire to captain that ship for a while now), but for the shop. Vanishing old and expired products, fixing up the broken ones, talking to Dean about some new advertisement posters for the windows, and getting Luna in to give some tips on interior decorating.
He should have left Ginny years ago. Before, when he read in the Prophet Malfoy was getting married. He should have left Ginny and gone to him - stopped that bloody charade from happening and just admit he’d been an idiot and that … That… He what?
Draco gave him a glass of wine and Harry tasted it. It was dry but still sweet, and as expected, it tickled a little.
Something inside Draco clenched with pleasure at the thought as he brought the cup of tea to his lips, keeping his eyes on his assistant all the while as she stood waiting for him to excuse her. He didn’t.
Whatever it was she believed she knew; Harry had no idea. He didn’t ask and didn’t exactly care about it. He was still trying to come to terms with the fact that his marriage since ten years was over - and he hadn’t been prepared for how awful it made him feel. Awful, and at the same time… Free.
Potter closed the door behind him and Draco tried to wipe the glare from his eyes but didn’t even bother with trying to smile falsely. Instead, he sat back down behind his desk, gesturing for Potter to sit down in one of the leather-bound chairs in front of his desk, whilst he took out his pocket watch, just to seem a little nonchalant. Perhaps it would tick off Potter and if so,
This world isn’t made for people like him.
“Barbarian?” Potter laughed, “Never been called that before.” He shrugged. “I suppose the barbarians did do quite a bit of party crashing, so… Yeah, I see your point.”
Jim Morrison’s voice was gritty and penetrating as he sang of changing and loving and needing badly, and Draco sank down in his armchair, pulling his legs up. With a flick of his wand, a couple of lights went on, as well as a couple of candles. The wine tasted sweet and light on his tongue as he thumbed the book, and all felt well, for once.
Harry walked up to his small home office and sat down by the desk that had once belonged to Sirius’ father, Orion. It used to be a dark room with heavy dark green curtains in crushed velvet and brown wallpaper. Now it was bright, but still cosy with dark types of wood and filled bookshelves.
“Certainly, master Draco!” Liffy sounded relieved and was gone in a pop. It took less than a minute, then she was back and handed over the small bottle filled with purple liquid.
“You can’t be sure he’d be bullied because of that.” Harry said, a stinging sensation going through his stomach at the thought his own kids might have to put up with harassment due to his and Ginny’s divorce.
Second, what were the reasons for their divorce? What could possibly have happened for Potter to be worried about the finances? Normally, in the few cases of divorce that’s heard of every year, the finances were the least of the issues in the settlements.
“Yeah, of course.” Harry nodded. “Will, uh... Can I see you soon? In private I mean.”
And so it began. The first of several tiering hearings, as it quickly became clear that this would indeed be a very drawn-out process and Potter’s mindless statements about what Ginny would and wouldn’t do had been almost comically wrong.
Instead, he plastered an obviously false smile on his face as he put his headphones and muggle iPod away, telling his assistant to bring Potter in in two minutes. She nodded and left, and Draco took the two minutes to make sure his suit and robes were as immaculate as his hair and face.
He fucking failed.
It was a good, fresh Pecorino and Harry took a long sip after having handed Draco a glass. Harry gestured for them to sit down in the sofas as they waited. Draco did, sitting leaned against the arm with his leg crossed over his knee. He looked ever so like the aristocrat he was and it pained Harry to admit he actually resembled his father quite a bit when he sat just so, a glass of wine in his hand and that damned snotty expression on his face, as if he’d just smelled something awful. Harry felt like an idiot for finding it charming.
Potter looked at him for another silent moment, his eyes glimmering as he seemed to savour his wine. “I’m fine with whatever, Malfoy. Do you want to bugger me instead? Is that it?”
It wouldn’t look very good, no. It wasn’t public yet, but it was only a matter of time.
The Malfoys have been high on the ladder of status for generations. The Ministry’s attempts to seize their assets to repay wizard society after the war hardly even made a dent in their finances. Much of the assets were tied up in muggle investments and accounts abroad and the Ministry’s little inquisition to have the Malfoy’s make a free-fall from grace, did little to nothing. They might not be as influential as they once were - and for that Draco mainly blames his father - but the Ministry cannot and have not, managed to erase the Malfoys from society. It’s all just a game, of course, but a game to be played nonetheless.
Draco’s face falls. What the bloody hell would Potter want with him? Some advice on how to handle the combined Potter- and Black inheritance? Half of which should rightfully belong to Draco’s mother and aunt, not the self-centred arsehole boy wonder Saint Potter.
“So,” Draco took a drink from his glass, savouring the taste for a moment. “You’re going to be a part-time dad now, then? Every other week and all that?”
“I’ll take your silence as your understanding how paramount it is for you to
“Don’t speak with your mouth full, you barbarian.” Draco sneered, daintily bringing the fork to his mouth and meticulously chewing his pasta with a closed mouth.
Potter. He needed him like he’d never needed anyone before - and in the ten years since he’d felt his skin - his warm, silken skin and the heft of his hard prick in his hands and full, wet lips at the nape of his neck, Draco had lived a shadowed existence.
Draco sat to the left of his father and to the left of Draco sat his wife. His son has been taken to bed earlier, having thrown a fit which his mother claimed gave her a headache, so Astoria took him away. Draco wished Scorpius could be away at all times. He didn’t want children. Didn’t want a wife, actually. And still, there she sat to his left, trying to imitate his mother’s posture but still failing. Her cheekbones were cuttingly sharp and objectively, she was gorgeous, but she did nothing to stir Draco’s affections, sexual or emotional. He wished he could put his headphones on and disappear to ‘Hotel California’ with a firewhisky in his hand instead of sitting here in the silence pretending.
He’d stopped obsessing over Potter ten years ago when he let go of his miserable teenage years and became a miserable adult instead. He’d promised himself he wouldn’t think of him again, wouldn’t allow himself to look for him. Potter was ‘straight’, and now married, with three bloody kids hanging from his soon to be ex-wife’s tits. Draco didn’t need even more misery in his life and it was of that he reminded himself as he silently watched Potter sitting on the other side of his desk, his green eyes empty and far away. Whatever had happened to make his marriage fall apart, it wasn’t anything Draco wanted to even care about. He’d do his job, quickly and efficiently, so that he could once again go back to doing nothing more than he had to.
Draco had always been a little too pretty, too elegant for the other rough boys at school. Even though he was an athlete and a seeker just as Harry, Malfoy had retained the litheness of youth and instead only grown more into his pointed and sharp features. If Harry was completely honest, Draco - because he wasn’t Malfoy to Harry anymore and hadn’t been for years - was drop dead bloody gorgeous.
Draco’s closest friends know about his relationship with Potter - and Potter’s friends know as well. The reactions have been mixed, but overwhelmingly positive - or at least neutral. No one has refused to stay in contact with him, which surprises Draco. He doesn’t know what to make of it, if he’s being honest. Harry says to let it be, to not think too hard about it. Problem is, Draco enjoys thinking too hard about most things. It’s one of life’s simple joys.
Potter noticed Draco watching his wrist and with a slanting of his lips, he said, “It was Fabian Prewett’s.”
“What time?” Potter asked and Draco could
“Listen,” Gemma said, looking at Potter, “It’s important you don’t give your assets away. I understand this is difficult, but these are
“Stop that.” Draco said, putting his fork and spoon down, glaring at Potter. “I haven’t agreed to
The Doors - Riders on the Storm
Tosser.
His father drew a deep breath, his eyes boring into Draco’s. “Rumours have reached me through an acquaintance, Draco.”
Alas, him and Harry, they’re not in any way open about their relationship to the general public. Draco is still married to Astoria and he’s not planning on divorcing her. She can spend her time as she pleases - just as he can. But they still have Scorpius. They’re what people call ‘estranged’. Which isn’t very different from how it’s always been between them. Draco’s just stopped trying to get her pregnant again. It’s something neither of them miss.
Astoria who was supposed to love him, pretends and takes his money just like the whore, and still she had the audacity to fault him for fucking them. Did she not realise she wasn't all that different from the prostitute in the alleyway - aside from the fact that Draco had bought her a ring and said some meaningless words during a ridiculous ceremony orchestrated by his mother?
And he hated himself when he woke up. Fucking hell, he hated himself. Even more so when he looked into the mirror and saw the massive cock up that was his sodding hair - blond whisps standing on end, crinkled and curled, the back of his head completely flat against his scalp whilst the other stood out in all directions.
Looking down at his pale, spindly fingers resting on the arms of his Jetson, contrasting the furniture’s dark leather with its unhealthy hue, Draco thought about how his life could have been great. He was born into a wealthy family, grew up on a large estate with enough friends and he was, at one point in his youth, close to his parents. But then everything went so wrong.
“Bloody arse,” Harry huffed, giving Draco a wry smile.
“Did she?” Draco pulled away from her touch, narrowing his eyes. “Well, yet another failure for father to blame me for then, it seems.”
“Have you eaten?” Draco asked as he poured a glass for Potter, deciding he might as well bring the bottle with him into the living room.
“You won’t believe this,” Gemma said, her voice low and almost a whisper as she leaned forward. “It’s absolutely mental, but… Ginny’s left him. For Kingsley Shacklebolt.”
“Right,” Potter nodded.
The pain from that Friday evening was still present. It didn’t disappear, no matter what Harry did, but he learned to live with it, strangely enough. He had before, after all. But then, he’d been able to focus on Ginny instead and transfer all those confusing emotions on her and the normal relationship he had with her.
“Right.” Draco feels sick thinking of Astoria as Potter speaks. His striking wife, bound to him - feathered to the manor with a lover or two every now and then. Was it fair?
“For the love of-“ Gemma was interrupted by Potter who zoned in on Draco.
married with a child? Be grateful that I still have contacts with enough sway to stop the Prophet from spreading disgusting rumours about you.”
He’d had two fucking miserable weeks after Potter had left. Pandora’s box was now fully opened and Draco found himself at the point of no return.
Draco sneered as he took the shot of vodka the cheeky dyke had put before him.
Opening the medicine cabinet, Draco removed a small bottle half filled with a softly pink potion. He shivered as he turned the bottle around in his hand, watching the liquid slosh around like a false promise.
In comparison, Ginny was safe. He’d known Ginny since they were kids, she was Ron’s little sister, for Christ’s sake! And Harry loved Ginny. She didn’t make him shiver like Draco had done and her kisses didn’t burn through him with an intensity so hot he didn’t know what to do with himself, but he’d thought she’d be enough. Thought they could make it work.
“Oh, fuck off, Gem.” Draco snorted, putting his cup of tea down, “That’s bollocks.”
He had allowed himself to spiral out of control, because he’d boxed himself into the misery of his own making, never allowing himself to confront the literal shockwave of feelings he’d pushed aside since Harry had pushed him aside.
The healer arrived half an hour after the tea and told him he was fine to go home, but he should take a few days off of work and not be alone for the time being, as he’d hit his head hard, indeed. Draco wanted to bemoan having to return home to the manor, but he was put in his old room as Astoria was still upset about him not wanting her to be at the hospital, as well as his
“Where’s the dining room, then?” Draco asked, turning around with his eyebrows lifted. “Seeing as it’s been turned into a sitting room.”
Harry needn’t have worried. As he was let inside Gemma’s office by her secretary, she was smiling at him as she’d done all other times that they’d had a meeting.
Draco looked away, focusing his eyes on Gemma again.
He didn’t, as he wasn't an idiot.
“East.” Potter shrugged, sipping his pint.
Pansy smirked as she shook her head. “Be glad I like you, Draco dear.”
“In an hour, ta.” Draco walked through his white kitchen, trying to locate the bottle opener somewhere amongst the unnecessarily many drawers and white marble counters.
Harry straightened his shirt cuffs and made sure is tie hadn’t slipped to the side as he came closer and closer to Gemma’s little office. His hair probably looked like shit as it always did and Harry had long since given up honestly caring. The only thing he cared about right then and there, was that Gemma wouldn’t have a go at him. That Draco hadn’t fucking dropped him and told the entire world about them.
As Ian Brown sings,
Well, it didn’t matter, did it? It wasn’t as if the book was going to disappear.
He hated how it felt as if his insides somersaulted and his chest swelled when he saw Potter. He didn’t like it one bit and wished desperately for Potter to just go back to his ugly clothes, without a sharp jawline and that bloody hipster beard that it seemed he’d gone all in for as he’d merged into adulthood. He also, pettily, wished he could break his nose again - or maybe just his glasses.
Draco had sat in his dark office for hours, staring at the piece of parchment - the words almost indecipherable from Potter’s atrocious handwriting alone - but Draco could read it. Could understand the words. And he hated them. Hated Potter for being the bigger man. Hated him for having the gall.
He’d meet with Gemma Zabini today, discussing the divorce proceedings and how Potter’s assets were to be divided.
He did what he could to occupy himself. He went to work, dealt with documents he’d pushed back for ages because they were boring and he just didn’t want to. He joined a few of his co-workers on the field, even though his post these days where more administrative than anything. He’d missed being on the field. Ginny had been scared it was too dangerous and begged him, for their kid’s sake, to take on more office work. Harry considered asking to be put back in the field.
As he'd sat in Gemma’s office yesterday, sober and clear-headed, and Potter walked in, looking hesitant and tense, all Draco could see was the misery in his eyes and he recognised it too well. He felt
No, he feels at peace because finally, he doesn’t have to hide himself.
“You’re having a party?” Potter asked with a grin as he leaned back in the sofa, balancing his glass of wine on his thigh.
Why would he, anyway? They weren’t eighteen anymore and Draco had about as much to lose - if not more - if it came out what they’d done.
As the man looked as if he was about to move closer to Draco, an arm was drawn over his shoulders and Draco almost jumped out of his chair - but a familiar voice spoke silently in his ear. “Don’t, Draco. Just go along, will you?”
Potter looked uncomfortable with Draco’s silence and Draco cleared his throat, trying to remain professional as he took out a parchment and dipped his quill in ink.
Potter shrugged, standing in the doorway between the kitchen and living room. “Sure.”
Draco frowned as he straightened up, clearing his throat. “I wouldn’t worry to much about it. And, if she tries to snub you of this place, I suppose I can always challenge her claim, and you can buy it from me.”
Potter chuckled and got back to his food, and Draco was broken out of his fantasy.
Ginny looked at him then, her fingers slipping in between his. “We’ll still be great parents to our kids. They’ll always be ours. We’ve made them, you and me. You’ll always be their dad. But I can’t live like this anymore Harry, and neither can you. We’re slowly smothering each other.”
A game that consists of fitting in.
He called it working, but in reality, he did little work. He learns, still, how to fit in. It was a entire science in itself, knowing what to wear, what to say, how to react and act depending on the company you kept. It’s all very shallow. Tailored suits and robes of the finest fabric, handmade inherited watches, ticking as time passes, and of course, routines for skincare to keep you looking young and healthy for as long as possible; all done to make it look as if not a hair is out of place. Everything to show your wealth, healthy living and first and foremost:
“Well?” His father glanced at the two chairs in front of Draco’s desk. “Do sit, son.”
“Harry,” Draco said, his voice hoarse, frail - and Draco had to clear his throat, still hiding himself against Potter’s neck as he spoke, holding on to his robes as Potter’s fingers wound themselves in Draco’s hair.
“Excellent choice, Potter. Surrounding yourself with former Slytherins. I wouldn’t say I’d do it any differently.” Draco gave a somewhat sly smile as he wrote down several more details. He didn’t look up to see Potter’s reaction, but he remained silent, as if completely unprovoked by Draco’s jab. It’s a bit disappointing, but Draco ignored it. “I’ll contact Mrs. Zabini and set up a time for a meeting. She’ll also be able to send me the documents I’ll need to sort through your finances before I’ll be able to set up your funds and accounts according to the outcome of the divorce settlements.”
Because, how could he not?
Gemma was filled with glee while gossiping as if their meeting were Afternoon Tea at the Nott’s.
Draco looked at Potter, his mouth going dry. Bastard children. Surely not?
“I know,” Potter said, staring into his pint. “It’s not what I’m doing.”
“Seems like it, yeah.” Potter shrugged and Draco had to remember to shut his mouth. Fuck this prick.
“And you’re married,” Potter said and now Draco truly feels ill. “…Does she know?”
“Master sent for Liffy,” she said, anxious, “Tell Liffy what to do for master. Liffy will help, yes she will.”
Lou Reed - Perfect day
Hellacopters - Hopeless Case of a Kid in Denial
Draco had never been warm, exactly. He’d been vicious in school and he could still be. Vicious to the point of sadistic. It was only one of his many faults and even though Harry knew he himself had a way of just shrugging Draco’s less savoury parts off like they didn’t mean as much, he was well aware of them. Well aware of the consequences of those vicious traits. His feelings for Draco didn’t change because of them, however, and maybe Harry was sick in his own way because of not finding Draco as a person despicable. But he simply couldn’t, because he also knew about the other sides of him. The vulnerability, the well-hidden softness and the dry spots of humour that Draco accidentally allowed him to see.
The trio stilled and Professor stilled. Even when they were rivals, they knew how important Hedwig was to Harry. The two had shown a clear familiar bond. Harry must have been devastated.
Mating
"Are you sure they'll have them here, Professor?"
"Alright then, who is it you wish to be re-sorted, Salazar?"
He said, amused. He watched as the rest of Slytherin nodded before picking up their treat and heading to breakfast. Blaise, Draco, and Pansy stayed behind to talk to him.
Harry said breathily, catching the attention of his companions. They came over and admired the serpents, happiness swelling inside them for Harry. Sure, Harry had real friends now, and a father figure of sorts, but familiars were special to wizards. They all understood of course, something that made Harry love them more.
Dumbledore said, annoyance seeping into his tone, causing Harry to flinch. A fact all of the Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws noticed.
Dumbledore's voice rang out clearly. The small, quivering boy couldn't hear anymore. He turned on his heel, stumbling slightly as he ran from the scene. The tears blurring his vision led him to the dungeons instead of his original goal of getting back in bed. He stopped before the painting of Salazar Slytherin, backing up slightly when he realized there was no way anyone would let him in.
Severus said, making sure to keep his voice even. He could see the sadness and loss in his eyes when the small boy mentioned his beloved owl. He would make sure to ask later when he and the trio had free time, but for now he would wait.
Harry said excitedly, giggling at Snape's exasperated expression. Snape just huffed as they entered a pet store. Magical and non-magical creatures alike the trio looked around in wonder, the Professor a bit more reserved about his fascination.
"Sir, Potter left a note on the table, none of us have read it yet. We just saw him clean up before leaving. He even left us one of our favorite sweet on the table."
"Why is it a win-win, Harry?"
The boy's face flushed brightly at the praise before he recovered. He explained what he witnessed, surprised by how much it angered the founder. The founder looked deep in thought for a long moment before he spoke up.
"Ah, Salazar. What are you doing here? And why would any student need to be resorted? I'm sure every student is very happy where they are."
"Let us get this re-sorting over with, so we can fix that arm, shall we?"
Dumbledore said, the boy hadn't told him this.
"Come on pup, let's get you some food and our little bat here some blood."
"You don't pay us enough to be friends with that idiot, Headmaster! Harry is a bloody idiot and I'm tired of dealing with him."
Blaise said, chuckling as Pansy huffed. Harry was like a cute, little sibling or platonic partner in a way. The trio had quickly realized he gave the best affection, so they all became very close. Draco snickered before walking out, Severus and the others following. This was definitely interesting.
Bonding
Pansy said brightly, her friends chuckling at her.
"I'm glad to have you Potter, thank you for the gifts by the way."
The five entered the great hall, immediately met with glares from the lions den, but also with nods off acceptance from the badgers and birds. Harry seemed to fold in on himself at the lions glares, causing Blaise to put himself in between his line of sight.
"It's okay Dray, thank you and your Veela side for protecting me and Harry. And thank you for getting help, you overgrown puppy."
Mates
Snape said, knowing full well where Harry was about to be placed. Harry was lightly pushed before Dumbledore's podium while the older wizard summoned the hat.
They said in sync, before they burst out in a laughing fit, Harry joining in with little giggles quickly. That quickly changed when he accidentally looked up though. Seeing his mentor, Dumbledore, glare at him so intensely made him retract quickly. The trio stared at him confused for a few moments before Draco saw how the headmaster was looking at the kind boy next to him.
Pansy said as she reached out to pet her friend, who had opted to just shift and relax on the floor. He huffed at her and snapped playfully. She scooted up on the edge of the couch so Snape could wrap up the scraps she had gotten from falling. She hissed slightly at the antiseptic, causing Blaise to snap in warning at Snape. The older male raised an eyebrow in amusement.
Dominant/Submissive Role(s)
The younger speaker nodded and smiled brightly at the man, warming the older man's heart. The founder opened so the boy could go inside the dark room. Whispering a small goodnight.
Dumbledore gave his small rant, before making the food appear. Before Harry could protest, Draco had mashed potatoes on his plate, Blaise adding a small-well-done steak, and Pansy added a handful of grapes. Harry grumbled something about mother hens before he started eating slowly.
After he finished, he excused himself, causing all the straggling Slytherins at the table to leave with him. Snakes don't leave other snakes behind, especially when the Gryffindors are always out for blood. Severus went through a mental checklist of the bone mending potion he needed while he walked through the hallways. He would need to fix Harry's robes to the right colors while he had time.
Blaise Zabini spoke up, a clear look of wonder on his face. Snape raised an eyebrow before snatching up the note and reading it. His eyes widened when he saw that he boy had permission from Salazar, perhaps there was more to this boy than a simple brat.
The black serpent said softly, seemingly relishing in the others touch. Harry smiled at the two softly. He gently placed his arms down in the tank, allowing the two beauties to slither up to rest around his neck.
"Does anyone want to explain to me why I just saw the Potter brat leaving here?"
"He iss indeed, love. We are alsso hiss familiarss."
The black serpent said, giving off a heavy "I'll hurt you if you hurt my precious people" vibe. Harry smiled at that, they were a cute couple.
"Let's go home guys."
"Hush, children. I will consider upping your allowance from the boy's money. Just keep the act up for a bit longer."
"Professor, Blaise, Pansy and I will take Harry to your office so you can heal him after breakfast. Someone was making him uncomfortable."
"Hello you two, what are your names? You're both so beautiful."
Most creatures, if rejected, will d1e
Snape said, a smirk flashing on his face before he strutted out. The trio snickered when they heard him yelling. Eventually the lesson began, Draco kept a close eye on the sleeping boy as he took notes. As he glanced over at the boy's peaceful face, he realized he had never seen the boy so relaxed. His shoulders were always tense, and his face had permanently been a frown before he had been resorted. He took a mental note to explain to Salazar what happened, knowing the founder had a soft spot for the speaker.  He hummed before turning back to his notes.
☽☾ Point Of View - Third Person
This caught the trios attention, looking up with concerned eyes for their new friend. Harry shifted nervously, he knew he couldn't get anything past the professor in front of him, so he only sighed and looked up at him.
He knew he’d fucked things up beyond repair, but he just couldn’t help himself, could he?
Kreacher had prepared cod with butter and parsley sauce, served with baby potatoes with a side of peas. Harry was silently impressed and thanked the elf before he disappeared and left Harry and Draco alone again.
Pansy said in a more stable tone, reassuring the worried Veela and Werewolf. Snape let the potion rest under Blaise's nose for a moment, before the Werewolf nodded at Draco that it was safe. Draco let the older man hand him the potion, which he bottle fed Harry, who calmed down a bit seeing it was Draco. Only when the smaller was asleep did Draco let Pansy out of his wings and come to his senses.
"T-They didn't have any my size, Professor."
Blaise said, effectively calming the boy. He almost laughed when the boy raced off to their seats, excited for a treat. Draco, with his obvious protectiveness the others noticed, sat close to the boy. They internally wondered if they were mates, but dismissed the thought for later.
"Alright children, I have some a student to punish so I'll be back in a moment."
"What is it you want, Granger?"
"Let's get him out of here and two Professor Snape's office, can you tell him where we're going Draco?"
"Severus, please take a look at the boy's arm."
Dominates are more protective, territorial, and love being praised for providing for their mate(s) or doing a good job by said mates. They, as said before, adore praise and affection. They are usually taller but not always. They have more muscle mass naturally.
"They're my familiars."
Draco spat, giving the smaller boy a reassuring look before turning back to his now angry friends.
"Well well well, have you finally realized I was right to try and put you in Slytherin the first time around, Potter?"
"Professor Snape, what do you think made Potter so upset that he ended up here?"
"It seems Mr. Potter was having a rough night and was let in by Salazar himself, so no one was in danger. Perhaps there is more to this boy than we thought hm?"
Draco said softly, watching as the boy just looked down and nodded. His Veela side did not like this. He had only reached his inheritance in June, so his instincts were new to him, but he had quickly found out Veela's are extremely protective of friends and family. He walked up to the boy quickly, lightly grabbing his chin and making the smaller boy look up at him.
A deep voice said in a calming tone. The voice spoke parseltongue, his eyes widened slightly as he realized it was a founder speaking to him. He bowed his head politely, wanting to be respectful.
"Headmaster, that freak is too bloody annoying! He really thinks anyone would want to be friends with him?"
Dumbledore strained to keep his voice even. He knew multiple students resented their houses. He knew Gryffindors liked to bully each other and other houses but he didn't care. None of these students really mattered to him anyway.
Draco said softly, he expected Harry would be skittish around him, but he was surprised when the boy smiled brightly and relaxed more next to him.
Mates are determined at birth. They bring out the best in each other. It's common for mates to be a bit stereotypical with the 'enemies to lovers' or 'rivals to lovers' troupe.
"You can sleep on one of the chaises in the common room, they're very soft, little speaker. If you get cold there are some throw blankets in the chest by the fireplace. Let's get you inside little one, I'll talk to you again soon, little speaker."
"Both lovely names. It's a pleasure to meet you both."
"It's okay pup, if you try and eat you can have one of those treacle tarts you adore as a reward."
"You have gone to far this time, Granger. Do not ever speak of my parents that way again. Or else."

☽☾ Warnings - Mentions of d3ath, manipulation, Dumbledore bashing, Weasley bashing, Granger bashing
The white serpent said, her tone soft and loving. She bumped her head against the boys jaw affectionally.
He said worriedly, not caring to notice the hall staring at the two speakers intensely.
The sniffling boy shuffled towards the kitchens, debating on asking Dobby for a glass of warm milk, when he heard familiar voices.
Harry's eyes lit up. He saw the two most beautiful snakes he had ever laid eyes upon. One was pure white, while the other was pure black. The serpents stilled when they looked up at him, which made the small boy still as well.
Snape said, the entire hall went silent before Salazar started angrily ranting in Parseltongue. Harry gave him a soft 'yes sir', holding his head down as if he were expecting to be hurt or thought he was in trouble. Just what was going on with this alleged brat?
"Draco, I need to give Harry a potion and bandage Pansy's legs. Is that alright?"
Severus drawled, hiding his concern at how casual the boy was being about this. Perhaps it was because he had broken his arm during quidditch during second year? The boy only nodded before walking up to his desk. The trio had opted to study while they waited for him to be healed.
Pansy said happily, the blood in her goblet making her feel refreshed. Blaise hummed in agreement before putting two on the blushing boy's plate. He smiled when the boy squeaked and happily ate them. Draco had a look that screamed 'how is someone so cute' which was, unsurprisingly, shared by 3/4 houses. The trio sighed contently, before finishing their breakfast. Their mornings at little brighter now that Harry had ate.
"Sir, I think Harry is having a episode of some kind. Draco is doing the best he can but he hasn't stopped repeating yet."
"Unhand the boy now, Weasley."
He said, before giggling lightly. Blaise and Pansy let out involuntary coos at the boys cuteness before attempting to cover it up with a cough.
"Are you alright, little speaker?"
Dumbledore could only hope it wasn't his weapon. He could not refuse a founder, especially one with so much leverage over him.
Harry spit out. His voice sounded so icy, for a moment everyone thought someone else had said it. He was trembling with pure rage, it seemed. Hermione whimpered and pulled Ron down with her, as she quickly sat. Nodding harshly. The whole school was fascinated. The boy who was always letting his friends push him around, the boy who's voice was always warm towards her had suddenly frozen over. Salazar quickly snapped out of his haze before hissing to Harry.
"I am Lux, I am a female. Thank you hatchling."
Snape said, a most curious look on his face. The three students could tell that Potter's act of kindness had stumped even their teacher. It was nice to know that the Potter wasn't like his rumors though. Perhaps he wasn't the nasty git they had heard so much about.
Pansy said, her voice shaky and concerned. His eyes widened before he slowly approached, not to set off the two protective creatures before him.
The nickname slipped out before he could stop it, causing both him and the Veela to flush red. They tried to ignore their housemates grins and coos.

"Harry I thought you were a better person! Your parents would be rolling on their graves if they knew this! Think of them Harry."
They cooed at the small boy, before digging in. The rest of Slytherin hardly held back their laughs at the silver trios attachment before they ate as well.
"You have nothing to be embarrassed about, Harry. It's not your fault, and we'll get you back in health in no time."
"It's seems there is a hairline fracture, stay off your arm. Do you understand me?"
When there was about two hours before breakfast, his wand set off a quiet alarm to wake him. He quietly got up and re-lit the fire, which must have burned out while he was asleep. He cast a quick cleaning charm, he had picked up in a old book in the library, on the soft blanket he had used the night before. He folded it up carefully, still unaware of the curious eyes of the Slytherins who were peaking from being their dorm entrances. Normally they would have made a scene, but the soft smile on Potter's face made them choose to wait and watch, curious about his actions. He placed the blanket in the chest, and summoned parchment and a quill. He quickly wrote a short note.

Harry started bouncing, forcing Pansy to stifle her laugh. The purebloods pride was still very strong. Draco snickered under his breath.
Veela are beautiful creatures. They are naturally more attractive and their skin has a natural glow. They have wings (and claws if they're angry) which are very powerful. They are extremely protective and by Veela Law, have the right to protect their mate even if it ends up killing someone else. Veela are extremely protective during the bonding phase, and don't feel comfortable with their mate around people they don't trust. It's common to go on a break from school until the bond is secure enough to be around others.
☽☾ Pictures don’t work on here I see
The white serpent said, cuddling up against the black one.
"I-I can't eat anymore, I-I'm sorry."
Creature Inheritance
Blaise said, slipping his robe on. He must of had it next to it because Harry hadn't seen it before. Draco nodded and got up, confidently walking towards the staff table before looking at his friends and Harry.  They were walking out now, finally out of the headmasters cold glare.
☽☾ Point Of View - Third Person
"I would die for you."
"I thought you just preferred baggy clothes, Harry. You know that isn't healthy right?"
The hall was completely silent, yet again. So Harry Potter was a true Slytherin, who had been gaslighted to hate the house he belonged in? That definitely shed some light on a few things. Then, it was no longer quite as Ronald and Hermione began to scream in outrage.
Hermione screamed, not caring who was looking at her. Snape's eyes widened, Minerva gasped and covered her mouth, Salazar stoped his rant and hissed softly at the now shaking boy. Shaking with what no one could tell, yet. The Slytherins all tensed. Family was very important to them.
"You can rise, little speaker. Thank you for your respect. Can you explain what happened to you, little speaker?"
His friends snickered at Draco's intense blush, causing him to mutter swears at them and pout. Very Malfoy like indeed. The serpents hissed out small laughs before returning their gazes to their speaker.
He almost let out a sob. They meant ... him? What was he doing wrong? Why were his best friends talking about him with so much hate. His eyes  filled with tears, and he covered his mouth with one of his slender hands, to prevent any breathing sounds.
