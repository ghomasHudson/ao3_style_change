"Can I ask you a question, Harry?" her whimsical voice cut through his thoughts and he turned back to face her, nodding. "This person you're talking about…you're not talking about a girl, are you? This person is a boy, isn't he?"
The unexpected words left Draco surprised. Did Weasley—despite the near implication of an insult—just offer him gratitude? "Of course," he said automatically. "Feel free to make yourselves at home, to an extent," he added. "Pibby will have breakfast prepared in the morning." And with that farewell, he whirled around and strolled slowly down the hallway, dragging his feet and pausing before his door to glance back, noting that the hall was once again empty and neither Weasley nor Daphne had lingered outside their rooms.
She nodded sympathetically, saying "I'm sorry," to Malfoy before casting some sort of paralysis spell over him and opening his mouth, pouring in both vials on the bedside table one at a time and using another spell to help him swallow without choking.
"Malfoy," he croaked, clearing his throat with a blush. Oh Merlin, why was Malfoy turning him into such a horrible awkward weirdo? Harry missed the days when he could just tell Malfoy to shut up and sod off without feeling any sort of discomfort. "What do you want?"
"'Bout fucking time we can go," Goyle muttered, swinging his arms. "Feels like we've been trapped here for a bloody year. I'll go pack my shite then." Turning, he strode away, his large bulk vanishing as his footsteps faded.
Heart racing, Harry took a deep breath, reminding himself that Moony had trained him to avoid knife attacks. He would be fine. If he could avoid attacks from Remus, then he sure as hell could dodge Wolf, who was a much clumsier and more grandiose fighter. He would go for the big, flashy moves, not the sharp, subtle flicks that Harry himself tended to favor due to Remus's training. All in all, Harry estimated it would take less than seven moves to successfully disarm the man.
, he decided as he stood and headed for the bathroom. First, he would shower. Then, he would get dressed. Then, he and Ron would go down to the Great Hall for breakfast and hopefully find Draco there and hopefully, he would be willing to listen to Harry. Then hopefully, they would go down to the pitch together and watch the game and hopefully, Harry would still be able to hold Malfoy's hand in the back row of the stands.
Fenrir snorted derisively. "
"I'm sorry, Pansy, that was mean," Draco apologized, feeling guilt swirl through him.
Faint scuffles echo back to me as my footsteps drag heavy and slow along the corridor. The lift took far too short a time arriving at Level 3 Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.
"Are you seriously saying there's no reason to suspect the Slytherins?" Smith stared at him with incredulous eyes.
The pretty eyes narrowed into a glare as the man raised the gun and took a step closer. "Who are you?" he asked again, voice low.
Nodding, Hermione canceled the spell around them, allowing the noise of the room to rush back in once more. "Is everyone okay then with the current arrangements?" she asked, receiving nods in return as everyone exchanged glances with one another. "Good. Then I suppose everybody is decided. We should go up to bed then, it's been an exhausting day. Everyone is now responsible for the other members of whatever group you've placed yourselves in. Nobody goes anywhere alone. Everyone washes up as a group, am I understood?" Everyone nodded in response. "Good."
"Whatever," Draco muttered, every inch of his skin itching as he felt suddenly desperate to get out of that damned bathroom and away from stupid—but still less stupid than Draco—Harry Potter. "Well, I just wanted to say thank you and now I have. I hope my stupid gratitude didn't shock you too badly, Potter. I'll see you around, and I suppose in the meantime, I'll try to be less of an idiot about everything."
"Harry," Malfoy whispered, grey eyes shining with tears, and Harry felt his hand shake even harder, holding his wand in a grip tight enough to hurt as it hung trembling in the air between them.
"All right then," Hermione said, and every gaze snapped back to her. "I thought we could split into two groups and each take one side of the same wing and work our way through the house that way. I want us all to stick together, but if he is the guilty one, I don't want to afford him the opportunity of changing rooms or slipping past us. We check everything. We move slowly. We cover every exit and check every corner. I want a thorough sweep. Ron," she turned to the redhead, "you and Neville go with this group," she gestured to the Ravenclaws and Gryffindors huddled together, "and Harry and I will go with the Slytherins. All right?"
"Both," she said simply. "Harry, you're welcome to head back upstairs to check on the Slytherins if you would like."
Watching him cautiously, Draco walked forward as well and, still eyeing Harry as though fearful the brunet would either sprint from the room or punch him in the face, he perched on the table next to Harry warily, staring at his hands in silence for entire minutes.
He longed to kiss the other boy hello but wasn't quite sure if they were at that stage yet.
"So, you came prepared." The four words were spoken in a slightly awed voice. Harry had prepared for this, this was a premeditated act. He had prepared and thought ahead to be with Draco
He unfroze at the familiar voice, sighing in relief as Tracey approached him, staring at him in confusion.
"Just go to bed, you tosser," Draco shook his head, fighting another smile. God, he hated Blaise sometimes.
"Oh, right," Ron's expression fell. "Well, guess you're just stuck dealing with the lunatics, then."
Zacharias stared at him, breathing heavily. His eyes were large and round and his mouth gaped open. "But it wasn't me," he whispered, lips barely moving. "It wasn't me."
Before Draco had entered Harry's life, Harry had been slowly folding in on himself, collapsing into himself and becoming more and more isolated and alone. The more time stretched the more content he had been to simply vanish and disappear, dissolve into an indifferent puff of smoke without a single word, content to allow himself to fade away without a fight.
"Don't worry, Granger," Pansy soothed, "I've watered all the shots down so nobody gets pissed too quickly and we can play as long as we like without getting alcohol poisoning. And I have pumpkin juice here as a chaser if anybody needs it. And this is a bonding game; it's one of the fastest ways to get to really know a person. We're about to learn everybody's secrets," she grinned, and Granger and Weasley traded uneasy looks.
Harry just grinned. "Not as selfless as you might think, considering the fact that I've never been able to make myself care what the public says about me. I never would have guessed before this year that we could all be friends. But you three are good people. And I get the feeling that none of you really ever get told that." The three Slytherins exchanged a look of agreement. "But you
He pulled back to stare down at Draco, tracing his pale features in the soft starlight above them. The moon was a tiny sliver in the sky, offering just enough light to make Draco's eyes glow. The feeling Harry had had before, when they had first begun to explore their feelings for one another, that mixture of tenderness and desire and affection that he had been so certain meant he was falling in love with Draco, reared within him once more, only now, it was so much stronger. It felt so much more solid. And judging by the look of fondness in Draco's eyes as he gazed at Harry, Harry knew he wasn't the only one feeling it.
, and yet it had felt like an entire century to Harry. What the hell had just happened? What was going on?
Goyle shot him a smug look. "Because I haven't told him to yet."
But before he could reach her, Draco was standing between them, face red with fury. How fucking
Harry stared at him, unsure of how to answer. "Well, I dunno," he finally said, struggling to find words. "It's never really come up. And when I was younger…" he paused before saying, "I guess I really was ashamed to have almost been sorted Slytherin."
Zabini raised one eyebrow at the blond. "Are you forgetting whose fucking house you're standing in, Smith?"
"Yes, you did," Draco agreed softly, staring down at his knees. "But I would hardly have blamed you for leaving me there."
"Well, h-he kept trying to drag me to the toilets," Harry stammered, wincing at the words.
"Draco," Harry moaned, "if you don't want to go any further, we should really stop right now, because I am about two seconds away from ripping these fucking jeans off you."
"Hedgehog slag," Pansy smirked, and Draco flicked her sharply on the shoulder just as they entered the common room, heading to a table in the corner to work on homework.
"So," the mouth said, sounding breathless, "if I were to kiss you again, would it make you back away?"
Once they were finally both full and the table had disappeared with another deafening crack, they snuggled back under Draco's blankets and slept for several hours in each other's arms, both smiling and content after the recent weeks of fury and anguish.
But Draco was speechless. Harry's little rant had rendered Draco utterly incapable of even attempting to speak; the only thing he felt able to do was nod as he pulled the brunet in for a kiss, pouring every inch of his feelings into it.
"Didn't take the news well?" asked Ron, twirling a quill between his fingers as he continued scanning the olive folder.
With a rueful grin, Harry shook his head. "You have no idea how angry I sometimes was as a child, Draco, and it only got worse as a teenager. I spent so much of my younger years feeling suffocated by my own loneliness and anger and the sense of unfairness in the world. And I know that my upbringing was no fun, but it certainly wasn't as extreme as someone like Crabbe's. I just…I don't want you to blame yourself or take this as a sign that all Slytherins and purebloods are corrupt. The world isn't black and white, not a single thing in this world is all or nothing. Life is complicated, Draco, people are complicated."
As Malfoy's panting grew louder, Harry finally took pity on him, deciding the teasing had gone on long enough and Harry's fun would have to come to an end. Shifting lower, he raised his head to stare down for a moment at a completely undone Malfoy, eyes clenched shut as he dragged in heavy breaths. God, Draco was
"Do you know how to get in contact with Goyle or Zabini?" the Auror asked, leaning forward to rest his forearms on his knees. It was a casual enough move, but one that automatically drew Draco's attention to the other man's firm biceps, flexing appealingly beneath his sleeves. If Pansy had been there, she would most likely have had something crass and obscene to say about the man.
Harry pushed the bike harder, driving faster, taking turns more sharply than he should, and not caring about a thing. God, he felt as though he were flying. It didn't even feel like he was touching the ground any longer—he was flying over the earth, too quickly for even gravity to have a hold on him. Harry was speed; he was wind; he was nothing but the breath in his lungs and the air rushing past. He was danger and exhilaration rolled into one.
Luna Lovegood was standing outside his gate.
"Draco," a deep voice rasped, and he glanced up to see Fenrir standing in the doorway of the bathroom, staring at him with an intense look on his face. "Why're you gone so long?"
"Harry," he repeated, mumbling the word against Harry's lips, and Harry knew—nothing in his life had ever been more perfect.
"Bollocks again!" Blaise glared. "I implied bags on it way before you did, you lying wench!"
"What if what?" the brunet prodded, stepping close enough to settle his hands on Draco's waist. "If you don't want this right now, Draco, that's fine, we can go do something else."
"Yeah, are you sure it was a Slytherin?" Blaise demanded, slipping his shoes on. "And not someone from a stupider house, like a Hufflepuff?"
"Seek," Draco whined, tugging at his hair, and Harry's grin widened.
"Who said I was joking?" Ron muttered, cracking his neck.
Pansy smiled widely. "Then I have no choice but to continue taking your gold from you, you sad hapless fool."
"Very well then," Draco sighed. "How do you want me?"
"Oh, don't play dumb, Harry, it doesn't suit you," Hermione said impatiently. "You
myself belong to him!" Draco snapped. "He decided he wanted me and now he owns me! Wolf owns me, congratulations, you're fucking right! Are you happy? And things were so different in the beginning, but if you think for one second that I actually
Ron nodded slowly, but he looked less convinced now. "What sort of comments?" he wondered, and Harry ducked his head, face positively on fire.
"Get him out of here, Draco!" Lucius ordered, face twisted in rage. "If you cannot control this disgraced orphaned half-blood…
"Yes, I heard." Draco glanced at the brunet, noting that, for once, Potter was not glaring at him. His expression was calm, thoughtful almost, as he studied Draco from only inches away.
Draco stared up at him with round eyes, feeling somewhat lost. "You do?"
At his words, Draco fell silent, simply staring at his friend. The only friend he now had, after Vincent's death and Gregory's self-destructive grief. Even Pansy—stable, reliable Pansy—was gone, now residing in Italy with her parents. Draco missed her terribly. No one was as catty or as prone to gossip as Pansy, and Draco missed her vicious sense of humor and cackling laugh. She was the only one who was even bitchier than he was and he
"And?" Fenrir swayed dangerously, staring at Draco with blood-red eyes. "Didja get any've that bastard's money then?"
Feeling uncertain, Harry nodded.
Harry's fingers itched and he had to fight the urge to brush the blond fringe out of the unconscious boy's eyes. With his eyes closed like that, he looked so peaceful, so beautiful.
The girl looked even more confused. "Seamus is bent?"
Zabini helped Harry clear up and was just asking him a question about the Defense homework when Hermione and Ron sidled up to them. The dark-skinned Slytherin looked momentarily alarmed at finding himself suddenly surrounded by three Gryffindors,
"Yeah, we had to save him," Harry shot him a pointed look, "since he never actually deserved to die in the first place."
Most of Harry's day was spent trying to catch Malfoy's eye: during class, during break, all throughout lunch, but all to no avail. The blond rarely looked up anymore in class. In fact, none of them did. The three Slytherins tended to focus only on each other, as if making a conscious effort to shut out the rest of the world, speaking only when asked a direct question and always sitting together at the back of every class.
Malfoy's cheeks colored slightly, but his voice was steady when he answered. "I am quite well, thank you. Other than a growing hunger at being denied breakfast." The words were accompanied by a pointed stare.
"Well," Ron shrugged, "you sort of seem upset enough for all of us, to be honest, so I really don't see the point in adding to it. And I know he's always been a stupid fucking arrogant tosser knobhead wank-stained vicious twat, probably the twattiest twat in the entire bloody book of twats, if I'm honest, but that was back before the war really started, you know? He can't get away with being who he was before, just some loud outspoken supremacist constantly going on and on about how superior purebloods are—he'd get torn apart for it in a second if he tried any of that shit now. And he really has nothing to feel superior about anymore, since all his pride was wrapped up in his blood status and his wanker dad and his wanker dad's gold, but he doesn't really have any of that anymore, does he? His dad's serving a life sentence in Azkaban, and I heard from
"Well," the blond sounded unexpectedly nervous, "I've already told you that I've had feelings for you since I was eleven. I've known for years how I feel about you." He ducked his head and refused to raise his eyes. "But, I have no idea how you feel in regards to myself. For me, though, Harry," and he raised his head to stare Harry in the eye with a challenging glint, "this is real."
Malfoy's smile widened as he nodded. "See that it doesn't, Potter."
"Whoa," the man said, raising both hands to show he meant no harm. "It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise."
Grinning, Harry allowed himself to be tugged forward.
"Bring it on, Malfoy," Harry challenged, tightening his hold on Draco.
"Celebrating?" Draco wondered, clutching the whisky bottle tightly between two hands to avoid having to accept the straw.
He missed the glares and the suspicion and the mistrust. At least those responses had been guilt-free.
"What?" Harry asked, blinking in confusion.
But Draco didn't want to see the sadness in his eyes—he wasn't ready to face either the sight or the knowledge that it was him who was putting that sorrow there, nor was he ready to face the heavy slew of emotions it triggered within him.
Except for Potter.
He heard another sob not his own a moment before Pansy wrapped herself around him, holding him tightly, crying with him and letting him cry. He felt Blaise settle himself on top of them both, their weight grounding Draco and making him feel more solid, less adrift; making him feel safe and cared for. Making him cry even harder for what he had lost.
"I know," he smiled, resting his cheek on her hair. "You'll always be my best friend too, Gin. Even if you do end up dating some ball-handling bloke with awful hair."
"No," Harry agreed in a quiet voice, "Maybe we aren't. But we're
"Oh my god, Harry," he wheezed, face turning redder than his hair as he guffawed. "I knew that's where you were last night!"
Gritting his teeth, Draco began pacing the room. Every written word had been read to him in his mind in Blaise's enunciated drawl, dripping with his usual level of arrogance. It had been the exact reason Draco had been so loath to attempt to contact the smug bastard. Of course he would take any attempt Draco made to contact him as an apology toward desired reconciliation. Draco couldn't even try to save the fucker's life without him misunderstanding the intentions behind it.
him! I let him violate
"Yes, I know that," Malfoy sighed. "That's not the girlfriend I meant."
Ignoring the man for the moment, he addressed his words to Daphne. "How are you feeling, Daphne?" he asked politely.
"You're drunk too!" Weasley argued, collapsing onto his back on the floor. "And I'm a bit legless at the moment, if you hadn't noticed. These funny prats tricked me into getting too bloody pissed."
He wondered if Seek was asleep. Had he gone back to sleep after their phone call, or had he been just as unable to close his eyes as Draco?
Dreams of blond hair and pale skin tumbled pleasantly through Harry's subconscious and he woke up very late and extremely hard, and was made even more late taking care of how hard he was in the shower. By the time he stumbled, yawning, into the Great Hall, it was mostly empty.
Sighing, Harry tossed another rock into the lake, watching the water ripple in ever-expanding circles, wondering how so tiny a thing as a pebble could cause such widespread disruption across the still surface of the lake. Was that really all it took to cause such chaos? Just one tiny thing to start it all, one tiny spark to ignite flames large enough to engulf the entire earth?
of all times, to discuss Cae's past. But how much did Harry really know about him? How well did he
"Did you wait 'til Saturday to come up here just so you could drag me to the village to get pissed?" Harry asked in a curious voice as they set off toward the Entrance Hall.
"No!" Draco grit out, sitting up and looking for his jeans, finally spying them on the floor near the end of the bed. He snatched them up and jammed them on, suddenly desperate to get out of that room. He couldn't be there, he couldn't be around Harry, he couldn't even look at Harry. Oh god, what had Draco done? Why was he the world's most horrible person?
"What if I like my men ticklish?" Draco said, a teasing edge to his words that Harry couldn't help but be captivated by. He certainly didn't mind being teased by Draco.
Draco smiled at him with a shake of his head. "Starting with the sweet talk already, I see."
"Yeah," Seamus grumbled, gesturing for one of the prospects to bring him another drink. The prospect nearly tripped over his own feet rushing to get it, and all three men watching laughed. "Cheers," he grinned, accepting the stout from the man. Dennis nodded respectfully, and Harry chuckled again. Lord, he remembered being a prospect.
And Harry felt his heart stop dead.
"All right," Harry nodded. "And the both of you have been together the entire time?" They both nodded. Nodding back, Harry did a quick sweep of their surroundings before leading the others from the room. "Let's go then." As he exited, Malfoy stepped toward him, taking the place by his side that Parvati had been occupying, and Harry saw her scowl as she fell back to walk beside her sister instead.
fuck,
Hermione's eyes suddenly widened before narrowing dangerously. "What the hell is the matter with him?" she gritted out, crossing her arms and dropping down onto Ron's bed with an angry huff.
"I don't know where they are," Draco repeated truthfully, voice taking on a desperate edge. "I swear to god, I have no idea where they went!"
of whatever it was that they had had between them stir weakly inside him. It had been there, on Blaise's lips, hidden in his touch, buried in his words. Was he really in love with Draco? How could Draco ever be sure? How could he ever trust him again?
"See you tomorrow, Ollie, yeah?" Finlay asked cheerfully. Harry had found that he liked the younger boy once he actually began speaking to Harry instead of only staring at him in nervous silence.
"We're getting sidetracked," Draco interrupted.
"Got it," Ron nodded, leading the way from the room. Harry and Malfoy brought up the rear, exchanging a glance before exiting.
"Fuck the ancestral home, Malfoy," Harry frowned. Was that really the reason the man stayed in such a miserable place? "We're talking about your comfort here! You should live somewhere you're comfortable actually residing in!"
His last thought as he spun away was that Draco really had looked beautiful that morning.
Harry knew with absolute certainty what color Malfoy's eyes were, when his birthday was, who his favorite Quidditch team was, what his favorite and least favored classes were—he had had Malfoy's school schedule memorized since fourth year, for Merlin's sake. He knew which hand Malfoy wrote with and could picture the neat, slanted writing perfectly. He knew which shops Malfoy frequented in Hogsmeade—Honeydukes being his favorite, of course; Harry was well familiar with the teen's sweet tooth. He even knew which sweets were his favorite—chocolate, of course, and even which chocolate specifically—expensive dark chocolates filled with a thick pink cream that Harry was pretty sure was strawberry.
"You are just too precious, Potter," Blaise said, offering him a wide smile. "Quite the humble gentleman you seem to have landed yourself, eh, Draco?"
from. He had been walking down a corridor toward the Gryffindor Tower when suddenly, he was surrounded on all sides by dozens of students from various Houses, all swarming close with grabby hands and effectively trapping him in the middle of the large group as they screamed their gratitude and begged him to recount the night of the Final Battle, attempting to force him
"Towards me, yes," Rhys said, leaning forward in his seat. "But…once, not too long before things ended, we were out for drinks together and some man near us made a loud comment to his friends about the dirty shirt-lifters sitting too close, and Blaise walked right up to them and said something, and I still have no idea what he did, but after that the bloke just…didn't look right. He looked…I dunno, just
"We already told you, Pansy," Draco sighed pityingly, "you don't have good enough tits to brag about, and definitely not good enough to define yourself by."
"Snooker…?" Anthony repeated, gazing into the distance as he thought back. "Is there a snooker table in this house?"
"You two are certainly sly little undercover lambs when you want to be," Blaise trilled, ignoring all danger from Madam Pince and her freakish bat ears as he dropped into the seat next to Pansy.
Pansy smirked as well. "Well, Granger," she began, earning a look from Granger that clearly said she had not been expecting Pansy to speak to her, "let's just say that there's a reason we're all stood so close to a broom cupboard right now, if you understand what I'm saying."
"Of course," he grunted, sounding insulted. "Those Ministry fucks wouldn't know how to find their own arses if the clues spelled out where to look." Pausing, he fixed Draco with a serious stare. "I expect the second payment before any information is given, as well as a hefty bonus if I am the one apprehending those found guilty, and an even larger bonus if you wish them delivered to you alive."
"I feel better already," Fenrir said with a lazy grin. "Told you, Draco, your mouth is all the medicine I ever need. I might even get the doctor to write me an official prescription for you. Three blowjobs daily, doctor's orders."
"So," he began. "What do you boys have so far? Any suspects? Arrests? Mysterious folders and ambushing schematics?"
say is that you've been spending almost every night we've been trapped here in a bed with two bent blokes."
"I still think my favorite was that Hufflepuff fifth, remember? The bloke who followed you around for two months before trying to give you the potion in a butterbeer he spiked during a Hogsmeade weekend?" Ron laughed and Harry glared even harder; he had been actively trying his hardest to repress that particular memory. Why would Ron force him to remember such a traumatizing event?
He gazes at me in what honestly looks like adoration before inching back up and kissing me gently. I grunt in frustration for a second until he abruptly grabs my leg, hiking it over his shoulder, and pressing his slicked cock to my rim. His dark eyes burn into mine as he pushes past the muscle, sliding inside, way made easier by the slick. It’s still so tight, and it burns, but I love it. I know I’ll feel this for
from my mouth. Good thing for that Silencing Charm. He picks up a brutal rhythm, pounding into me relentlessly. “God, Malfoy, I’ve wanted you for so long,” he grunts out, pausing his speech to moan. “You’re so perfect. Look at you, taking it so beautifully, so well,” he purrs, and my chest fills with warmth at his words. “I think I’ve always wanted you,” he continues, somehow able to still put together sentences while I lie down here with my entire world pounding apart, one thrust at a time. “It’s only ever been
snuggled up against me, adoring me, praising me.
“Funny way of showing it,” I say. He’s still standing resolutely in front of the Floo. I cross my arms, irritably breaking eye contact to stare at the floor. “Draco…” I sigh wearily. “Look... I’ll just come by tomorrow.” I try to reach past him for some powder.
"I don't know what the hell it is!" Harry sighed explosively, running a hand through his hair in agitation. "I don't know what the hell you're doing or what it is that you want from me! I don't understand what's happening, Malfoy! I don't understand any of it, so please just explain it to me already, because none of it makes any sense!"
him! Malfoy hadn't really been willing at all, and Harry had been too stupid to see the signs. Harry had raped the boy that he had been falling so hard for, he had assaulted the person that Harry cared about more than he had even been comfortable admitting to himself! "Oh my god." Harry jumped to his feet and stumbled away from the two of them, feeling nausea churning his stomach. "Oh my god." His breaths started to come faster and faster, until he was gasping and dizzy and his entire field of vision was covered in dancing black spots. "Oh my god, oh god," he choked, feeling as though he was a second away from passing out, from sicking up, from breaking down completely. What had he done? What had he allowed himself to do to Draco? And how much would Draco hate him for it when he was himself again?
"I dunno, Draco," Harry said cheerfully, "I think I like hearing people fight over my friendship like this. Makes me feel all important and loved."
"She'll be far too smitten with me to ever allow such a thing to happen," Blaise said with a careless wave of his hand.
"Besides, I want our first time to be…special, you know?" Harry confessed, staring determinedly at Malfoy's hair and not meeting his eye. "I want it to be somewhere that we don't have to rush or leave to separate dorms afterward. I want us to be able to spend the entire night together."
"We should probably go join the others," Harry said, feeling uncomfortable at the sudden intensity of the moment. "I can practically feel Parkinson burning a hole in the back of my head with her gaze."
A defiant stare met his own for several moments before the gaze was dropped and Harry was shrugging uneasily. "I wanted to talk to you," he admitted in a soft voice.
for the answer to that question to be no. When he starts behaving like this, though, it becomes easier to pretend that the answer really could be no. It's times like this that I remember how much I truly hate him.
Glancing up, Harry startled and flushed at finding Malfoy
Wandering over to Hermione, he followed her to the far wall to speak to her in a quiet voice. "What did you find, Hermione?" he asked, glancing back at the room Ron had just gone into.
"I just—need to think," Draco muttered, hurrying toward the door. "Fuck, Potter, I can't—I-I just need to think!"
"Unless that expression means it was both at the same time, the dirty slag," Blaise mused. "All right, let's get back to the dorm right now. There are things I need to know."
"What wasn't, Zabini?" Harry said, words sparking with fury. "What wasn't his idea?"
Harry thought the glass might shatter from how hard Malfoy was clenching it. "Shame that my drinking habits are no longer anything you're allowed to comment on, isn't it?" he spoke in a tight, angry voice.
"Yeah, otherwise it'd just be us and Smith's stupidity," Nott added.
Just as difficult to banish was the hot churn of guilt that curled through his stomach at the memory of Harry's expression when Draco had yelled those things…those horrible things that weren't even
"What do you think?" Potter asked, sounding worried. "I know it's a bit…the fire-in-a-jar thing might be a bit weird, but Hermione taught me the spell a few years ago, and it was either that or candlelight, and I figured that candlelight would've made it look a bit too much like a cheesy 80's movie or something, so I decided the fire would be better, 'cos we have to be able to see, right?" He laughed nervously.
"You can't wander around on your own," Malfoy reminded him, stepping closer with narrowed eyes. "You're the one who keeps bloody saying that, Potter."
Turning to the door, he had his hand on the knob before a voice stopped him.
Sprinting down the hallway, Harry headed immediately for the open door at the very end, the one that led to the safe room. He had closed it when he had gone upstairs, he was absolutely certain. Yet now it stood wide open. Creeping forward, Harry clicked the safety off on his gun, placing his feet carefully and tightening his hold on the weapon. One step forward, then another…
"Extremely," Blaise responded, giving the two Gryffindors a challenging look. "Why? Is this your way of bowing out already? I must say, Weasley, I had expected more fortitude from you."
"No, Draco, of course not!" Harry answered immediately, turning Draco by the shoulders to pull him into a fierce hug. "You can't hold an entire group responsible for the actions of a few!"
Malfoy glanced up at him again, staring at Harry in silence before erupting into laugher once more, clutching at Harry's shirt with both hands to keep himself from dropping to his knees in mirth. Harry thought about stepping away and letting Malfoy fall to the hard ground, but the man was holding his shirt too damn tightly.
"Yes, let's do," Blaise agreed. "I have many secrets to pry from you tonight, my darling minge munching flamingo."
Draco stared at him. How could Potter not—what was he saying? "So…" he began hoarsely, struggling to understand, "so you're saying…what are you saying?"
"We're not in public," Potter pointed out, and Draco felt his head begin to ache from how hard he was glaring at the stupid idiot. "Okay, fine," Potter relented, holding both hands up palm out. "No public wanking, got it."
"Did you find anything new?" asked Harry, rolling his eyes.
"Sure, he says that now," Pansy cackled, "and next thing you know, you're pregnant. Right, Draco?"
Sighing heavily, Draco attempted a smile. "If you were anyone else, I would believe the slight to be intentional. But you're Harry bloody Potter, defender of injustices and the like. You may be a tactless sod, but you're hardly what I would call cruel."
"And you would have deserved it for saying something so foolish," Draco agreed.
"Just stop talking already," Draco demanded, feeling frustrated at both his own confusion and the serious and extreme lack of kissing that has currently happening. Why was there so little kissing in his life at that moment?
The question instantly made Harry regret voicing his discomfort. "Nothing like that," he said hastily, wanting to comfort the man rather than frighten him unnecessarily. "It's just—I don't know, there's something about this storm that's making me uneasy."
"And not just me either," Potter continued, a small grin lifting the corner of his mouth, "he showed Ron where it was too. He let the two of us right into the Slytherin common room without a second thought."
Shrugging off his jacket, Draco crossed the room and dropped it on top of his trunk, nudging Pansy with a sigh to get her to make room for him on
Malfoy was silent and Harry finally peeked up to find him breathing heavily, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose and eyes closed, attempting to regain control over whatever emotion had him in its grip.
A thick silence fell between them. With every passing second, Harry could feel himself growing more uncomfortable as the air around them grew more and more strained. Should he break it first? What should he say? What was the right thing to add? How else could he explain himself? Was there any way to make anything better? Would it be better for Caelix if Harry was to leave?
Before he could argue, however, Malfoy was speaking. "For years," he said quietly, eyes searching Harry's face in a way that made the brunet shiver, "I had thought you were simply putting on an act for your peers and devoted fans, certain that you were only playing up your gallantry as you thought they wanted you to act. But you're not, are you?" Malfoy asked quietly, reaching out one hand to grasp at Harry's shirt collar, "This really is who you are, isn't it? You really are just as kind as your blindly devoted followers proclaim you to be, aren't you?"
"I should have known right then," Harry shook his head sadly. "I should have known that something was wrong. I could see that something wasn't right with you, but I just…I dunno, it never even crossed my mind to think it could ever have been something like
"That should definitely be entertaining," Blaise nodded, "at least for a few minutes. It'll be a nice break from studying."
Do that again, Draco, hard like that."
For a moment, just the briefest second, Harry was tempted to confess everything to the man—maybe to get it off his chest, maybe to ensure himself removed from the case, maybe to prove Wescott a tiny bit wrong about his involvement with Draco, or maybe just in attempts to shock the other man, Harry didn't know. Wisely, however, he decided to keep it all to himself. With a shake of his head, his shoulders slumped in defeat.
Harry huffed a laugh. "Fucking weird."
"I still can't believe you showed him where it is," Pansy shook her head. "He didn't even have to suck you off or anything to find out, you just
Smith glared down at the floor. "Yes," he said tightly, "I understand."
Zabini's eyes flashed and Harry smirked. The grip the other man had on his wand tightened visibly and Harry cocked the same eyebrow as before, not bothering to raise his own wand. If the man wanted a fight, there was only going to be one outcome, of that Harry was certain. And it did not include anything ending well for Zabini. Harry's palms itched and he hoped the other man really would try something.
Draco grinned and shook his head. "That wasn't a Christmas present, silly, that was just on account of it being a Wednesday."
There was only one thing he could think to help him sort everything out. But first, he needed Pibby.
"Ooh, 'empathize', Potter, another good word for you!" Blaise smirked. "Your vocabulary really has improved ever since you started spending so much regular time around the three of us."
Once on the other side of the door, Hermione warded it tightly shut before stepping back with a nod. Squaring her shoulders, she led the way to the room Justin was being held in, murmuring a series of spells and nodding to herself as the door swung open. He was standing before them in a flash, wringing his hands and shooting hopeful glances over their shoulders into the hallway.
"Draco…" Harry trailed off, uncertain how to answer. Of course Harry didn't want this to be some sort of casual, temporary thing. Harry didn't do flings.
"I'm not sure," Justin admitted. "I think it took all of us a few hours to actually fall asleep. But Zacharias was definitely still awake when I fell asleep," he added defensively. "I know that I fell asleep before him."
"What did you do to me?" he wondered, twisting his upper body around as best he could.
"Just Blaise," Draco admitted. "But that was really more for practice than anything."
The three Slytherins made their way to the Great Hall in an unusual silence; for once, Draco had nothing to say and it seemed as though the other two were unsure what to say to him. They entered the Hall and made their way to their usual spots at the very end of the table, silently serving themselves breakfast. Draco stared down at his tea, stirring it around and around and listening to the clink of the metal spoon hitting the glass of the cup, refusing to look up. Who knew tea could be so fascinating? It might possibly be the most fascinating cup of tea in the entire world. Maybe Draco wouldn't ever look up again—maybe watching tea spiral would be more than enough to entertain him for the rest of eternity and he could live out his life in that very spot, not looking up and not speaking to anyone.
"All right then!" Kings shouted, swinging one long leg over his bike and revving it loudly. The rest of the men turned their ignitions as one, splitting the air with the fierce growls of the engines. "Let's go!"
"But," Pansy continued, ignoring Blaise's outrage, "if he wants to befriend your…" she slanted Potter a sly glance, "
Draco raised one eyebrow, glancing pointedly at the nightstand, where a half-empty bottle of lube and several condoms lay.
"Fuck," Blaise muttered. "I don't have any more gold on me, you cheating bint."
"How freaked I seemed," Draco murmured, rubbing both temples. "An understatement. At least I didn't attempt to
. Oh, god. Was he crying now? At that very moment, perhaps? Knowing Draco, he was most likely hidden away somewhere, unwilling to show any sort of vulnerability to anybody.
was there? There was no possible way that Draco could have known who was responsible. Right?
"Where are you, Draco?" Wolf repeated, a hard edge of anger running through his every word. "Tell me. Now."
"The two potions together would have been fine," Draco said angrily, rubbing his temples as he waited for the pain in his throat to also disappear, "if somebody had made sure I drank some water along with them."
"Let's go then," Harry said before Smith had a chance to respond. Stepping forward, he began to shuffle the Slytherins from the room before a loud voice stopped him.
"For the last time, Zabini,
Potter shrugged with obvious discomfort. "Zabini asked me to look for you. He was really worried when you took off like that and never came back, said something about you making stupid decisions and never listening to him and he didn't want you to get into trouble, so…" His voice trailed off in embarrassment.
Malfoy's eyes widened in surprise as the jet of light hit him squarely in the chest, the shock never leaving his face as he fell. Blinking rapidly for several moments, Harry took a second to collect himself before walking quietly to Malfoy's side and dropping to his knees. He reached out one shaking hand to stroke the hair from Draco's forehead, studying his unconscious porcelain features in the dim light of the moon.
Stepping closer, Draco watched in fascination at the way Potter's eyes widened and breath hitched. "It's fine, Potter," he murmured, standing only inches away and staring into Potter's eyes in a way that he hoped was seductive. God, Draco had no idea what he was doing!
It was
"No, I think it's time I finally faced down a broomstick. I mean, if I'm able to face
he's kissed you! And sleeps like ten centimeters away from you every night!"
Draco considered setting it on fire.
Smiling, Potter leaned forward to help him, explaining what the different papers all meant.
The thought of Wolf touching Draco made Harry's stomach turn, and he had to fight off the bile rising in his throat. No wonder Draco had been so reluctant to admit who he belonged to. Wolf was ugly, violent, and crass—he did not deserve someone so sweet and beautiful. He did not deserve Draco, and the idea that
Draco asked in disbelief. "When? Was this when that moronic Slytherin led you here in second year? I thought they just showed you where it was! Who the hell was this idiot and why the fuck were they stupid enough to actually let you in?!"
"I could be talented enough to do both at the same time, you don't know," Potter said softly, leaning in even closer, and Draco felt himself sway closer in response.
"No," he said hollowly, staring away from Draco. "I don't suppose you can."
"Well, I haven't really had time to look," Potter replied with another easy grin, one that made Draco's breath catch. "Work keeps me pretty busy."
"Let's go then." But despite Harry's words, he was not able to tear his eyes from Lisa's face or lift his feet from the floor, almost as though it was not water coating the tile but glue, sticking his shoes to the floor and holding him trapped. Lisa's mouth was slightly open, but not a single bubble or hint of air escaped through it. Harry wondered if she had been drowned in the tub or killed beforehand, in the same way as Susan. Had she been forced into the tub before dying or had she fallen in afterward? Had her corpse been pushed in by whoever had done this? And had they filled the tub with the purpose of killing her in it, or had she filled it with the intention to bathe?
. Fuck, you feel incredible. Are you okay?"
Pansy's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Granger,
"Guess," Ron growled, leveling the Hufflepuff with a glare of his own.
"Well, what about you, Draco?" Potter turned to him, the concern on his face now nearly overwhelming. "How often do you get hate mail?"
He had never imagined that he would ever be able to
House points for that?" Blaise sounded outraged. "Not many fully-grown wizards are able to take on a fucking mountain troll and live! And you were probably the scrawniest thing in the whole school in first year! How the hell did the three of you survive?"
"And not Draco," Blaise shot back. "He preferred to save that sort of thing for the Quidditch changing rooms." Draco flushed as the other three laughed.
"Are you cold?" Potter asked in concern, appearing as though he was half a second away from taking off his own jacket to offer to Draco, who shook his head profusely. No number of jackets would be able to stop the shudders that seemed to run through him every time Potter's green eyes looked at him in such a way, as if Draco was the only thing in the entire world worth looking at.
The word made Pansy clench her fists. "You want to try
"What are you doing with that one?" Harry asked, nodding down to Pansy.
"Don't even listen to him," Draco said, mentally attempting to come up with the best revenge plan for Blaise the moment he fell asleep.
At his words, Malfoy's gaze shot up to fix him with the same steely glare he had been burning a hole in the ground with. "Do you have any fucking idea how mortified I was the morning after?" he demanded hotly. "I had practically
Instantly, Potter flushed a deep crimson and shuffled his feet nervously, shooting his own stinging glare at his friend. "Shut up, Ron," he mumbled in mortification.
"He's the one you should be sorry for," he whispered, "not me. He's the one who—who—"
Draco Malfoy. And maybe they wouldn't like each other at first and maybe Ron especially might have trouble accepting it, but Harry knew with absolute certainty that his friends would forgive him of anything and that Ron was long past his days of storming from tents and leaving Harry behind—the redhead had emerged from the war with a new level of calm and maturity that Harry had never thought possible in him.
"The room's sealed," Harry explained, glancing back to check on her progress. The door was still closed. "Draco said it shouldn't be locked, and it sure as hell wasn't the last time we checked this floor."
Finally, he managed to force the door open enough to slip inside, and the first thing he noticed was that he was in a small loo, the cramped room much darker than the rest of the house. There was a tiny window above the toilet, offering a small amount of storm-grey light to seep into the room.
At the words, Harry's stomach dropped. "Don't be ridiculous, Ron," he said harshly, startling himself at the vehemence in his words "Malfoy does
"Oh, sure," Harry said sarcastically, but his grin was still in place.
to torment.
At the sight of their exchange, Draco felt his stomach tighten but forced his words to remain courteous. "I'm glad. If you need anything at all, just let me know." His mother would be proud of his ability to hold an even tone.
"Fuck," Draco swore. "He could be there for fucking hours. We're pretty much doomed to miss breakfast if he's found a mirror. I thought I had hidden all the mirrors from him. I have never met a person able to stare at themselves for as long as Blaise does. I swear that more than half his life has been spent sitting before mirrors or staring into anything even slightly reflective."
"No," Weasley said, rolling his eyes even harder. "It's not my fault if you hear the word 'penis' in every single sentence that comes out of a person's mouth. Just stop thinking about them so much and you won't have that problem."
The words instantly made Draco freeze in place, feeling as though a bucket of ice water had been thrown over him as reality came rushing back in.
Harry should have known the year was going to be shit the day after classes began and McGonagall announced to the consternation of his classmates that eighth-years would not be allowed to join House Quidditch teams. Ron had sat next to him in utter silence, gaping at her in horror for several minutes before he turned and mouthed wordlessly at Harry. "Ha…but…H-Har…" he stammered, seeming unable to get his friend's full name out.
"Are you planning on casting a cleaning charm soon?" Draco wondered haughtily, trying to ignore the flutter in his stomach from Harry's words and his soft kisses and his warm eyes. God, Potter had turned him into a right sodding girl, for fuck's sake.
"Wow," Malfoy drawled, eyes twinkling, "and after such flattering compliments."
Were Harry
Weasley rolled his eyes but added his shot to the group cheers, the six glasses clinking sharply together before the shots were swallowed.
"That ring," Wolf growled, "stays on, Draco. It never comes off. You are
"Then…someone was there." She took a deep breath and placed one elbow on the table, resting her forehead against the palm of her hand. "I didn't even see him," she admitted, eyes closed as she spoke to the surface of the table below her. "But I
"What the fuck happened?" Goyle asked gruffly, stowing his wand away and shuffling from the bedroom.
All Harry could do was shrug helplessly. "How did the two of you get out of your rooms?"
"Please don't force me to prove you wrong by having to be sick all over you if you even try to attempt it," Draco drawled, shuddering at the traumatizing image of Blaise making any sort of move on him.
"I came to speak to you," Malfoy said quietly, shuffling forward into the dim light of the window-shaped night sky flooding the Tower in a large, neat square.
"Actually," Harry laughed again, holding his sides as though in pain, "that record was shattered years ago, I'm sorry to have to tell you. I've already seen your common room."
Lemme know your thoughts, opinions, suspicions, all of that :) I'm so curious!
"Thank you," Draco cried gratefully, wondering how he had ever reached a point in his life when he was thanking his own boyfriend for not forcing himself on Draco. It was not a point he had ever thought he would get to, and that realization made him want to cry even harder.
Giving in to the smile attempting to stretch his face, Potter shook his head again. "Oh, sod off," he said good-naturedly. "I don't plan on being followed around forever by your dead transparent arse, so do me a favor, yeah, and maybe try to
"Disconcerting?"
"—play Quidditch! You must know the most brilliant tricks!"
"What are you apologizing for?" he wondered.
"Er, Oliver offered to give it to me," Harry started uneasily, fidgeting under Malfoy's gaze. "It was a present to him and he never flies it, so he thought I might want it since I don't have my Firebolt anymore, but I told him I couldn't possibly accept it, so he'll be the one keeping it, really."
Hermione hummed uncommittedly, but Harry nodded. He knew exactly what Ron meant.
"So?" Harry demanded, refusing to believe her at the same time he was unable to deny any of what Hermione had said so far. "Isn't that what everyone who fancies someone is like at first? All any of that means is that I want to be with him, there's nothing wrong with that and there's definitely nothing suspicious about that! If it was some stranger whom I'd never met before and who was five years younger than me that you were talking about, then I would see your point. But
Malfoy pulled back to glare at him. "
Draco stared at the ring for several moments, and with every passing second, Harry's insides twisted tighter and tighter, but after what felt like an eternity, Draco finally nodded and slipped the ring from his finger, stepping away to tuck it into a pocket of his rucksack.
Grinning around several large gulps of his drink, Wisp shook his head. "Gone," he replied simply.
Harry corrected himself in a sudden panic.
"What if they won't cooperate?" Draco whispered. "What if they won't tell us how to get out of here?"
"Ron," Harry interrupted in a tired voice. "Please. This will only take a minute, and then he'll go away."
"Must you agree with his lies, Potter?" Draco sighed in exasperation, shaking his head in embarrassed amusement.
The words made Draco's stomach clench. That could so easily have been Seek.
Hopefully, Caelix would be there. And hopefully, Caelix would have answers.
"It wasn't us!" Parkinson snapped. "We've all been together the entire time!"

I look up to the window, but it is not Sela who flies there: Harry Potter, on his fucking Firebolt, hovers outside my window. I fly up and cross the room hurriedly to open the window before berating him.
We stand there for another moment or two, just holding each other and smiling stupidly, until Draco finally pulls away. “You’ve still got to feed me. And for fuck’s sake, do please at some point learn the proper use of a
And riled, he is. “You know, as I’ve been sitting here just waiting around, I’ve been thinking.” Here comes the drama.
I roll my eyes as I wiggle out of the crimson Auror robes. I drape them over the sofa. Draco eyes the move with judgmental eyes but chooses not to comment. “Can we just get going, please?” I plead.
He kisses me, but this time it’s different. This is not gentle, timid... no, this is

He continues his wickedly slow, sure thrusts and leans down to press his face into my neck. “I’ve been meaning to ask you to dinner for a while,” he says, as calmly as if we were sitting at a table in the Great Hall.
His eyes slip closed, fatigue setting over him. I feel the physical exertion start to pull at me as well and snuggle closer to him.

, the ache from Potter’s massive cock in my arse, and my prick twitches hard at the thought. I wrap my other leg around his waist and urge him on. The burn continues on impossibly long until his length finally bottoms out, his balls pressed against my skin. I hug him closer with my legs. A few seconds pass until I nearly cry out, “Harry,
“I s’pose we’ve kind of arsed up the order, yeah?” He chuckles, actually chuckles, while his continued patient strokes further take me apart. “But… y’know… would you? Like, at a Hogsmeade weekend? We could get a pint, or if you wanted somewhere else-” I cut him off easily by pressing my lips to his, moaning loudly into his mouth before pulling away.

The last thing I see is his stupid happy grin before he continues his vicious pounding rhythm and my vision whites out, and it only takes another few strokes before I’m coming, completely untouched (which has

Our foreheads rest against one another while we catch our breaths and come down from the high. Harry gains the ability to remember to pull out of me and, while I’m whimpering at the loss of that wonderfully full feeling, rolls over me onto his side, facing me, eyeing me with a look so sappy I blush and have to look away. I tangle my legs into his.

I sat at my desk, and wrote a letter to Potter, who I’d noticed left the party shortly before me. With a grand swig of that dastardly lovely Ogden’s, I took my favourite Eagle Owl quill and began:
“Draco…” he tries again, but it breaks off into a groan as I roll my hips more insistently up into his. “What… what do you want to do?” he asks again. Really sticks with the point, this one.
He kneels up and I cringe again at the whimper I make at the loss of his weight, but then watch in wonder as he inches down my body, settling between my legs with a wicked grin on his face.
What, you’re too advanced now for a regular door-”
Something in me snaps. Whether it was the long, exhausting day or Draco’s temper tantrum or some combination thereof, I’ve finally cracked under the strain of it. I feel my blood boil and I expect I’ll shout back at him, but instead I snatch my robes back up from the sofa and turn towards the Floo, spitting out a terse “Fine, then don’t,” through gritted teeth.
“Anything, just,
tells me they landed in their destination: the hamper. Private quarters for the Eighth-year students was definitely an appreciated privilege. My mind swims through the day, maybe in an attempt to discover how I could’ve possibly gotten myself into my current situation.
A slow burn slithers down my throat and settles, deep and warm in my chest. Theo was the one who was slick enough to get the bottles of Firewhiskey, but I was the one who was slick enough to have nicked one for myself. My head and mind whirl rapidly and I lay back on my bed. I strip down to my pants, floating the discarded clothes away with a lazy wave of my hand. My eyes are closed, but a small

), he comes back with two.
I quickly cross the Atrium to the Floos, quietly murmuring Draco’s address before walking into the emerald flames. Existence shifts, and I stagger out into Draco’s living room, where he sits waiting for me in truly impeccably tailored dressy Muggle clothes--even exhausted as I am, I can’t help my eyes trailing over his slender, fit form--and an impressive pout.

“Draco,” I say. My voice comes out low and warning, something that typically intimidates others but somehow never fails to rile Draco Malfoy right up.
I knew everyone was watching me before I looked. The bottle was pointing towards me. I hadn’t even paid attention to who had spun it. I looked around in alarm, trying to deduce who it was, when Potter crept towards the center of the circle, those jungle-green eyes blazing intensely into mine. I recall a sudden feeling of immense heat building in my chest and settling in my groin as I instinctually mirrored his actions, even though my mind was in a blank panic.

He lowers his eyes from mine to eye my cock, hard as stone resting on my stomach. He grabs it simply around the base before taking the head in his mouth and starting to suck lightly, drawing a

Then, he turns his eyes to me and I gasp as I feel the sudden cold air on my bits, indicating he’s Vanished my pants. I might be upset about it, but Potter’s weight on top of me is like some kind of mind-altering experience and I can’t think of anything but doing whatever I can to please him. He Vanishes his own clothes and gloves as well before tossing his wand away and lunging at me again.
Of course, it all began with Granger and Pansy (who, by some terrible strike of doom, have become near-inseparable partners in crime) who organized a party for the Eights, as they call us, in the Room of Requirement. After watching the Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff match (Hufflepuff blasted Ravenclaw to next week, impressively), we all headed to dinner, stirred up and antsy for the night yet to begin.
All too soon, a gentle push on my chest broke me from the fantasy and I opened my eyes to see his mischievous darkened ones gazing into mine. Whooping sounds could be heard around us but it seemed I was stuck in a bubble, a perfect bubble of time with Harry James Potter, the most gorgeous, perfect creature to ever fucking grace the planet. Who was staring at me like I was something he wanted to

“God, please, Harry,
“No!” His hand darts out, long fingers wrapping tightly around my wrist before it can reach the bowl on the mantle of the fireplace. “Stay! Please.” I stare at him, taken aback by the full-on panic corrupting his handsome features. “I’m sorry. Please stay. I love you, Harry,” he blurts out, eyes widening seemingly in surprise at his own words, and I can’t fight the smile that breaks across my face. My reaction seems to soothe some of his anxiety and he loosens his grip on my wrist to entangle his fingers in mine. His eyes still betray the worry he must be feeling, however. “Stay,” he repeats again.
Soon he begins to snore quietly and I settle into a comfortable position in his arms. “It’s only ever been you, too, you know,” I whisper.
. It feels like he’s bloody claiming
Don’t get me wrong. I love Draco. And I know he loves me, even if he hasn’t said so yet. That’s why he relentlessly nags me about overworking (though he’d staunchly deny it and claim selfish reasons, of course). But I’ve had a long day, and I’ve heard enough complaining for the rest of my life today. All department heads were required at a Ministry of Magic meeting about fundamental improvements needed any and everywhere. Long, boring, petty, and about two hours too long.
He smiles. I watch him, still amazed at this turn of events. I mean, for
“Harry. Please, I… I’m-” he begins, his worried silver eyes burning into me, and swallows hard before continuing: “sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it, you know I didn’t.”
“Will you go to dinner with me?” he asks.

He crosses back to me and holds out his hand before meeting my gaze with expectant eyes. “Well?” I take his hand and we Apparate into an alley outside the Muggle restaurant we’d chosen for our date night.

He relaxes his throat immediately and pulls off to look up at me, grinning stupidly. “You’re so pretty when you beg, Draco,” he says, before pressing the tip of his finger inside the ring of muscle. I gasp. It’s been a few weeks since I’d used anything more than fingers inside or a hand on my cock for a wank; toys take time, and I
I stand silently, observing him. His hands are shaking and his gaze darts nervously about the room.
Again, the moment ended too fast and we were guided back to our seats in the circle. The rest of the party passed in a complete flurry as nothing I thought of could even attempt to keep me from focusing on that divine kiss with Potter. Eventually I teetered out of the room, back to my quarters, where I should have just drank a sobriety potion and gone to sleep. Unfortunately, I didn’t.
“Of bloody course, you bloody berk, just for the love of
Part of me, shocked to hear such a tone come from him, wants to pull him close, but the rest of me is seething. Tough luck. “Get out of the way.”
” He’s standing now, properly furious.
Thankfully, every other sane person in the Ministry has also fled. Smart of them, seeing as it’s a Friday night and long past daytime business hours. I hear myself groaning, thinking again of dealing with Draco.
I stand from my desk with a heavy sigh. Stretching my stiff limbs, I wince when I see the time: I’m already an hour late for meeting Draco at his flat. I can already hear him complaining. Loudly and dramatically. My head pounds in response and I wince again.
. Potter was bloody incredible, both in body
. I moan into his mouth and eventually he lets up for air. “Want you so bad,” he says, his voice strained. He rolls his hips against mine in a slow, punishing rhythm.
"I really don't think—" Hermione started, but was once again interrupted, this time by Anthony.
A low, ugly laugh escaped Goyle as he stepped even closer. "Christ, Draco, you don't ever change, do you? You just don't know when to let things go. You don't know how to back down even for your own fucking good, do you?"
And as a result, I am the one who places absolutely no faith in you. I don't trust you, Blaise," he continued in a hard voice, "and I can't be with someone that I don't trust."
This time it was Blaise who winced and reached down to rub at his bruising shin.
"That wasn't so fun now, was it?" Daphne asked sweetly as she lifted the curse. "I would not suggest saying such a horrid thing again."
"Fuck, Draco," Harry murmured in a low voice, "I could come just from hearing you say that."
"What do you mean?" Harry asked in surprise, wondering when the hell Malfoy had become nice or when the hell Luna had discovered this. It certainly couldn't have been when she was being held at the Manor.
The silence stretched as he continued to stare at Harry, and Harry could not remove his gaze if he tried. There was an entire hurricanic sea of emotions storming in the depths of Malfoy's grey eyes, and Harry could not turn from the sight. He wanted so badly to understand the man, to know what he was thinking and how he was feeling. How could he learn more about him?
The Patronus dissolved and Harry smiled at how he had been thinking the exact same thing only seconds earlier. He immediately sent back a Patronus of his own with his location before deciding to wait for Ron in the sitting room.
"All right then, Harry," Finlay sounded slightly disappointed. "See you guys," he waved and went back inside, leaving Harry and Oliver alone in the torchlight.
Draco's expression softened as he pressed a kiss to Harry's mouth. "I'll go get changed."
Blaise shook his head. "This isn't even about the picture, Draco. We know what this is really about."
"But I really want you to actually touch me," Harry laughed breathlessly, running his hands through Draco's hair and making Draco want to nearly purr, for some strange reason, which was perhaps the oddest reaction he had ever had to a physical touch in his entire life.
"No, Harry," Draco shook his head, pressing a kiss to Harry's collarbone. "No, I don't feel the need to be alone, I don't want to be alone. I want to spend the night in your arms, like always. I'm not quite sure how to describe it, but I feel…I don't know if free is the right word but, unburdened, maybe? The grief is still there and I'm not sure it's planning on going anywhere for quite a while, but…I feel lighter, in a way, if that makes sense. Less weighed down and more hopeful, I suppose."
Draco tensed, freezing in place for several seconds before sighing loudly and scrubbing his face with both hands. "Fuck. Shit. You're right, Seek, I'm sorry," he muttered. "I just…I'm a bit on edge at the moment. I didn't mean what I said. You wouldn't be the first one to tell me what an ungrateful brat I am, so sorry."
"I don't know," she said quietly, looking back at the room they had just exited. "But I think we should speak to Zacharias before coming to any conclusions."
"Hermione?" Weasley climbed unsteadily to his feet and looked down at her, holding out one hand to help her up. She stood with only a slight sway, leaning heavily into Weasley's side.
"No," Malfoy agreed, "but it's a place to start, at least. We're not expecting this evening to completely reverse the way people see us, all we're wanting to achieve is a step in the right direction; the beginnings of change. Is that really such a bad thing, Potter? You offered the Dark Lord the opportunity for remorse, but not us?"
"We learned it from telly, I suppose," Harry replied lightly, shrugging. "There are only about a million and one Muggle crime shows always on television."
"It's a wonderful morning, isn't it?" Harry grinned, pouring himself a cup of coffee. Normally he drank tea with his breakfast, but after the previous night and how late he had ended up getting back to the dorm, Harry felt as though he could use the extra caffeine.
If Harry was able to establish some sort of motive, it would give him a focal point, something to go off of, instead of stumbling blindly around the evidence. The violence of the crimes suggested it was personal—that the killer had been intimately acquainted with the victims. But given the history and reputation of those particular Slytherins, as well as the nation's distrust and oftentimes outright hatred of the House, they couldn't count on the killer having some sort of established relationship with the deceased, and there were too many people connecting all of the victims to even attempt to pin it down. Most of the Slytherins involved were from old families and had been acquainted since birth.
Harry remained silent, poking at his eggs in quiet indifference. Truthfully, he sided with Hermione. Quidditch
"I left," Draco whispered, exhaling at the realization that he really had left. "I left, Trace. I'm in Hallows territory right now. I really did it. I really left him." He sagged back, leaning against the bed and laying his head back against the mattress. Fuck. He really had left Fenrir—Draco had
Eight pairs of eyes snapped onto Harry, who took a deep breath and shook his head to clear the haunted cobwebs from his mind. "It was Terry Boot," he said in a heavy voice. The Slytherins said nothing, their faces hardly betraying any sort of reaction at all, but Harry noticed the way they had grown still, none of them even appearing to be drawing breath. "He went missing after lunch, so we split into two groups to search for him, and…"
Harry rolled his eyes as he played with the nearly silvery strands of hair at Draco's nape. "Hermione's right, Ron," he said, "don't be so dramatic."
"Is everyone okay?" he shouted, heart pounding furiously and body still shielding Draco's own. What the hell had just happened? Was the attacker still in the house, or had the spell been triggered by something? Glancing around the room, the first thing he noticed was a large gaping slash in the wall, offering a splintered view of the bright sky above them.
"Honestly, Cae, at this point I'll take anything," Harry assured.
"Oh, you'll shoot, will you?" Crabbe sneered, clenching his hand tight around the handle of the weapon in his grasp. "Harry Potter's going to shoot? What exactly do Gryffindors shoot at people, hmm? Optimism? Naivety? One of those heroic speeches you keep tucked in your back pocket for all the naughty ones like me?"
But as the word
him?" Blaise continued, in a voice as hard as his cold granite eyes, "You know how the world sees you, Draco. You're not naïve, you do know what everybody still thinks of you. Don't you? Do you really think Harry Potter looks at you any differently? He's only human, after all," Blaise said softly, tone now sympathetic, "One who's always hated you, Draco, always looked down on you. He's never kept his despise for you a secret. Do you really think he could ever love you?" He paused as he looked Draco over from head to toe. "Do you really think you could ever deserve him?"
I want to groan. Am I really jealous of Chang? As Potter's grip around her waist tightens and he leans in to whisper something in her ear, the burning in my gut informs me quite strongly that yes, yes I am.
of this broom," he moaned. "I didn't even think it was in shops yet! It's fucking
"How long do you think it will take the Ministry to realize where we are?"
"It's only frightened of you, darling," Draco returned, deciding he really liked the feel of lying half-sprawled over Harry's lap while Harry stroked his hair.
"He's not going to kill you, Draco," Pansy drawled, sounding far too indifferent to Draco's impending doom. "It's Potter, he's far too boring and noble to ever be interesting enough to be actively planning another student's death. If any deaths ever result at his hands, it'll be from sheer clumsy stupidity, not premeditation."
"Sweet and adorable?" he scoffed. "Hardly. As if I am capable of being either sweet or adorable. More like inebriated and idiotic."
Ron opened his mouth excitedly, but Seaver cut him off. "They completely destroyed the fireplace, we can't tell where they went."
Sighing, he pulled out his phone, wondering if he should call Fenrir first, or take the chance that either Pansy or Tracey was still in the clubhouse.
"What about Morgue's car?" Draco wondered. "They know you have it, and that'll be the first way they'll try to track you down."
His breathing finally began to slow as he forced himself to ponder what he
It feels like seconds but I know could very well be hours later that I pull back. His lips are pink and slightly swollen, his hair is mussed from my fingers, and his eyes are bright and dazed.
"Just thinking," Draco shrugged, knowing his movements were far too stiff to be believable. "I'm tired."
"Why the hell are we even sat here?" Weasley grumbled, crossing his arms.
Aaand that is the first of the Gryffindor/Slytherin bestest friend bonding experiences! Nothing brings people together as quickly (or tears them apart just as easily) like alcohol! To all of my non-drinking friends out there, I really do promise that you can go from hating a person's guts and wishing death on them to pledging your eternal friendship and undying love all in the span of a single shared bottle of liquor. And I also promise that drinking through a hangover really is the best—and pretty much only real—way to cure a hangover. Haha, a couple shots, some cheap fries/chips, and a cigarette is my best advice for a hangover. Lol, I live in a party house of drinkers. This really is pretty much every weekend for us, minus the drinking games, because we already all know waaay too much about each other, haha.
"Er…" Harry trailed off as he pondered the questions. He knew exactly what his ideal outcome would be—one in which nobody was hurt. Not Draco, not Caelix, not Harry, and not even Zabini (although Harry was least concerned about him). But he also knew how impossible that outcome was.
"And now it's over," Malfoy murmured.
, Harry thought quietly to himself, smiling internally at the thought. He wasn't sure that he would ever again be able to hear or see rain without thinking of the blond and the kiss they had shared by an open window of an abandoned corridor, set to the sounds of rumbling thunder and the soft muted
"We found Triggs," Seaver answered in a quiet voice, placing one hand on Wescott's shoulder in comfort. "That was right around the time that last spell went off. We followed the sound and had just enough time to see a figure Floo away."
Above him, Harry panted wildly, one hand twisted so tightly in Draco's hair that he feared magic might be the only thing able to untangle the strands from the other boy's fingers. Smirking to himself at the reaction he was getting, Draco pushed the foreskin further back and placed just the head of Harry's cock on his tongue, licking and sucking as he stroked the shaft, speeding his movements up as Harry's breath came faster and faster.
Not that Draco could ever picture Harry laughing cruelly at anyone, especially right in the face of someone as pathetic as Draco was in that moment, but in his panic, his mind had somehow convinced him that it was a very real possibility. His hands sat in his lap, twisting and rolling the blanket between his nervous fingers.
"Don't you dare say something like that in front of him, Blaise Zabini," Draco warned. "You weren't even invited to see him!"
"I'm not that person anymore." Malfoy shifted closer as well, until Harry could feel the heat of his body against his entire right side. "I'm not the person I was under the potion's influence either."
"Right," she rolled her eyes.
"Good," Draco growled, raising himself up enough to seal his mouth over Harry's and kiss him as best he could whilst Potter was still thrusting wildly against him. A moment later and Harry's entire body stiffened, his movements becoming small and jerky as he clutched tightly at Draco, and Draco felt a splash of warmth spreading between them. Without breaking the kiss, he reached out to pry one of Potter's grasping hands off his waist, tugging it down between his legs and encouraging him to wrap his fingers around Draco's stiff cock.
The sound of stomping and slamming doors jolted Draco awake and he blinked in the grey light filtering through the grimy shutters. Tiny specks of dust floated through the air, drifting through the dim slices of light peeking in through the dirty window. Was it morning? Squinting, he looked around, noting that the bedroom was empty. Where was Fen?
Trying his hardest to keep his mind from focusing on what Harry had been about to say, Draco began taking notes, attempting to ignore everything that was not the sound of Slughorn's voice.
"That's not what I'm ashamed of," Draco said coldly, looking the man in the eye for the very first time since he entered the room, shocked at how similar and yet so different his father now looked. Lucius was thin and gaunt, skin even paler than normal. Grey had begun to seep through the wispy strands of his platinum hair, making the man appear as though he had somehow aged ten years since the last Draco had seen him as opposed to the four years it had actually been since his sentencing.
"Hello, Potter," he returned just as softly. The panic in his bloodstream began to spread outwards, slithering through his entire body until it was not blood being pumped from his heart but pure panic. What would happen now? What would Potter say? How should Draco respond? What was Potter expecting of him? What was Draco expecting of himself? The howling questions swirling through his mind refused to be silenced, making Draco feel dizzy and sick.
Somehow, the room now seemed even quieter than before.
"And Pansy wanted to compare you to a bat," Draco added, deepening the disgruntled look on Harry's face.
"What do you mean 'not really'?" Hermione prodded, interrupting his thoughts and drawing his attention back to the present.
"Are you all right?" Harry demanded, peering closely at the blond. "Fuck, I knew I shouldn't have let you go off by yourself like that! I swear to god, I don't care how many business deals I lose you, you are
, for Merlin's fucking sake."
"Yes, we will take
"First of all," Harry said, holding one finger up in emphasis, "there are other things on telly besides violence and zombies. Second, I don't even watch those sorts of shows."
"I thought that about the Manor, too," Harry said in a faraway voice, wondering what the best course of action to take would be.
"It's the last time he'll ever touch you," Harry promised quietly.
Parkinson reached out to him in comfort, squeezing his arm once.
"Well," Harry lowered his voice and leaned in closer, "he and Draco had this huge falling out a few months back, and that's when Zabini vanished. What if that fight was what pushed him over the edge, so to speak, and he decided that all of Slytherin had to pay?"
With a drawn-out sigh, Harry left the bright warmth of the balcony to once again enter the manor and the endless mysteries contained within.
But if not Ginevra Weasley, then someone new, perhaps? More importantly, though, why should Draco
Harry saw shadows in Malfoy's eyes and wondered if he was thinking about the same moment. "Er, you go ahead, Ron. We'll be there in a bit," he said.
Despite himself, Draco had frozen as he listened to the words and, without making a conscious decision to speak, he heard himself asking the question, "Realized what?"
Except that he did want to complain. Loudly. As Draco's friend, he did not want the blond to be hurt again, and he had clearly been hurt by Zabini.
Blaise glared. "This is why neither of us wants to be with you, you realize."
the whole mess with the Vanishing Cabinet and letting Greyback in the castle and indirectly getting the older Weasley mauled by him. And that whole business of Potter being dragged to your house during the war by a bunch of Snatchers and nearly being killed there…
The line went silent.
"Course you will, Harry," Ron smirked. "The 'progress', right."
"Why don't you want me to have any fun?" Blaise pouted. "This was
Glaring at Ron's obvious amusement over Harry's humiliating existence, he handed the box to Hermione without a word, who tugged it open and began casting spells over the cookies. Harry wasn't exactly sure what spells it was that she cast over his presents, but he trusted her to know the most in-depth ones for detecting any sort of potions or magic within food and drink. The spells she cast seemed to take forever, but finally, she straightened and shook her head at Harry.
And now he had been used without even realizing it. He had been used by Draco, the one he had just confessed to being in love with.
All thoughts of stupid internal organs were forgotten, however, at the sound of the mattress creaking a moment before Harry leant forward and pressed his lips to Draco's in an unexpected kiss. The kiss was so unexpected, in fact, that it surprised Draco into forgetting how to actually kiss. He simply sat there, frozen in shock, doing nothing with his mouth like an utterly inexperienced moron, until Harry finally pulled away. He stared at Draco with a questioning look in his eyes.
"Do you remember when I told you about those Muggle weapons we have in the house?"
"I just…" Harry shrugged. "I just…needed a break." The sentence hung awkwardly in the air between them. Would he tell them about what happened? How could he, after everything he had said to Ron just the previous night? But maybe he
Draco snorted. "I will give you five Galleons right now if you go over there and tell her that you've missed her dolphin bosom."
Words were mumbled under Malfoy's breath that Harry barely caught, what sounded like "typical Gryffindor", and Harry smiled.
is how you say goodbye," he said in a soft voice.
Seek pulled back, slipping his hands from Draco's. With quick, nimble movements, he undid the fastenings to both their trousers, helping Draco wriggle free from the clothing before yanking his own off and tossing it to the floor.
"Malfoy?" Harry called quietly, glancing around himself.
"With what?" Potter chuckled. "They don't take Galleons here, you know."
"Harry," he corrected softly, no longer liking the sound of his surname on the man's lips. "We're not in school anymore, Draco. And you wanted fresh starts, so…let's start fresh."
Fingers trembling, Harry slid the hand in Draco's hair back down the trail it had taken, sliding it down his throat, chest, and stomach, until it was hovering just above the waistband to Draco's trousers. Harry slipped his fingers beneath the hem of Draco's shirt and brushed them lightly over the soft skin, smiling into the kiss when Draco whined impatiently. Harry wasn't normally a tease, but he felt as though he could tease Draco all day. There was something so deliciously sinful about the way the blond writhed against him as he tried to get Harry's hand to slide lower.
the little monster," Draco laughed, a fond glint in his eye. "But I could never have Harry and it infuriated me to no end. Oooh, I drove my father absolutely
The twigs were a deep onyx and each one clipped to perfection. He reached out a slightly trembling hand and ran it over the air inches from the wood. "Oliver, what is this?" he asked in an awed voice. His Firebolt had been beautiful, but
"What did she do?" Malfoy's voice was calm but Harry could see lightning in his grey eyes, making them seem like two angry storm clouds embedded in a pretty, porcelain face.
But he trusted Harry.
"It makes me feel like I can't breathe," Harry mumbled, deciding they could never solve anything without honesty and stupid necessary disclosure. God, Harry hated disclosure. "It makes me feel trapped and like I'm suffocating. You remember how I mentioned earlier about living with people who spoke about me like a thing? And about being treated like an object and a servant?"
"You're both, congratulations," Draco told her with an eye roll. "I hope it makes you feel special."
"Seek," Draco whispered, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth, and the sight of Draco sitting atop him, writhing and riding him desperately, pushed Harry over the edge and he came with a deep liquid sound spilling from his throat as he buried himself in Draco's body.
"You were never given any clothing of your own?" Draco asked incredulously, unable to even imagine such a thing. He had heard other students talk about hand-me-downs, of course, but it was a concept he had never truly been able to understand. All of Draco's possessions had always been just his, had only ever belonged to just him, and he just couldn't seem to wrap his head around the concept of sharing clothing with others.
of that?"
"And what's that?" Draco asked curiously, unsure if Harry was still attempting to seduce him or if he really did have a task planned for the two of them.
And now Draco knew—it would never have been enough. Nothing he could do would ever have been enough for his father. Lucius Malfoy was simply not a person who could ever be pleased with anything, and Draco was years past trying to earn the respect of a man who had none to give. His father was as empty of love and regard as the winter's air was empty of warmth; there was simply nothing there to grab, nothing to hold onto. Draco refused to allow himself to continue feeling shame for his father's shortcomings, for not meeting the impossible standards set in place by a man who simply could not see anything past his own stubborn, over-inflated ego.
"I do," Harry nodded, appearing much more confident than he really felt. Ron was right—he had no idea what he was doing. But it didn't matter. It didn't matter because Harry absolutely refused to turn from Draco just because Draco came with baggage, even if that baggage happened to be a bit more dangerous than usual.
And even more than it made Draco ache, it made his veins sear with a burning need for the other man. He wrapped both arms around Harry and began tugging lightly, until he was lying flat on his back on the couch and Potter was stretched atop him, one thigh tucked snugly between Draco's own.
"Fine by me," Hermione allowed. "Although that will put you on clean-up duty after dinner."
Malfoy blushed even as he fought an embarrassed smile. "I never said
"Do you think I'd still be lying here next to you if that's what it was about? Or that I would have returned the favor?" Harry asked calmly, reaching down to thread his fingers through Malfoy's, the same as Malfoy had done when leading Harry over to the very boat they now lay in.
"Hello, Ginny," she greeted, returning the hug with a pleased expression. "It was very kind of you to call me over. I wanted to come say hi earlier, but I wasn't sure if I would be intruding. I've missed you, you know. I was telling Harry how much I missed you not too long ago. It's good to see the two of you together again."
"And what about you then?" Potter asked, a small grin lifting one corner of his mouth. "If he's the straightest thing in the world?
"Oh come on," Seek chuckled. "This is strictly business, nothing more. You're the one who came to me with a message. I'm just trying to make the passing of the messages a bit easier for us both."
"Good," Goyle grunted. "I just want to get the fuck back to Germany, where shite like this doesn't happen to me."
"Well don't be so easy to sneak up on, then, C," Harry suggested mockingly.
"Do we have to eat with them?" Parkinson wondered, wrinkling her nose at the thought. "I don't really fancy being on the receiving end of death threats over dinner, Potter."
"So then," Pansy said, the two words interrupting Blaise's confusing internal crisis. She sounded far too cheerful for the situation, considering the fact that he had just discovered he had a terminal fucking disease eating away at him from the inside. "Let's see the rest of the letters then! God, I hope they're just as good as this one."
But even as he firmly agreed with himself, he could feel a tiny seed of doubt bury itself somewhere deep in his mind, somewhere deep and dark and unreachable, and Harry knew that if it was allowed to germinate, it would only fester as it grew, rotting his happiness away as it spread its tendrils through his entire mind, and it would not stop until it had consumed every ounce of joy he had once felt at the thought of Draco. How could Hermione, his very own best friend, be the one to shove that seed into Harry's mind and convince it to take root?
a Malfoy. And I'm not sure if you've noticed, but people nowadays don't really react too kindly to the name
Harry wanted nothing more than to pick back up where they had left off before all the interruptions and painful discussions. But the past hour had been too tumultuous; there had been too many serious words exchanged to recapture the relaxed excitement of earlier.
It was a good thing looking good was not a challenge for him.
"Yeah, all right," Draco sighed. "I suppose this really isn't the place, is it?" He slid off Harry and both boys sat up. Harry swung one leg up to lay it on the desk before pulling the blond into the v of his body, tucking one pale shoulder against his chest and resting his chin on it.
"Yes and no," Draco sighed. Finally, he understood how keeping things hidden could come back to bite him on the arse. Was this not a sign that he should start being more honest in his relationships? Did he not owe Gregory the truth, as both his only living friend and someone who had been directly involved in everything?
"We need a better place to meet," Potter mused, still pressing kisses to Draco's throat.
Harry stroked Malfoy's sharp cheekbones lightly with his fingertips, marveling at the beauty he had never fully appreciated before. "Malf—Draco," he whispered, and the kisses turned more insistent.
"You're here," he said in a shy, wondrous tone that broke Harry's heart.
perfected it or if she was simply saying that to convince them to buy it, but they said that they had thought the same thing and had also demanded proof because of how expensive it was to purchase, so she told them that she had already tested it on another student. A male student."
God, Draco wanted him so much, more than he could ever remember wanting anybody else before. Potter's body was still gripping him with the most delicious nerve-melting feeling, all tight heat and trembling muscles, and Draco wanted nothing more than to rock his hips forward and bury himself fully in the snug warmth. Summoning every ounce of self-control he possessed, he held his limbs perfectly still, distracting himself by focusing on Harry's inhalations and trying to synchronize their breathing. Beneath him, he could feel Harry's body gradually relaxing as he lifted his fingers to Draco's cheek, tracing patterns over the skin. Still, neither of them said anything as they stared into each other's eyes.
Inhaling, Draco's eyes slid shut, a tortured look crossing his face. "Nothing," he murmured, shaking his head in tiny movements as though attempting to shake unwanted memories loose. "Please, Seek. I don't want to talk about him right now."
But the tension was quickly becoming far too much; the stillness felt so heavy, so sticky, almost as if Harry would have to scrape it from his skin with a wire brush just to rid himself of its clinging fingers.
"Simple, Draco," Goyle grinned, "I wanted you to watch him die. And I needed a bit of help with some of it, which is where my puppet comes in. He distracted the Aurors at the safe house, like a good puppet."
"And Pansy will give you a blowjob."
But changing the subject away from angry love, what does everyone think of Wisp's news? How many of you out there have been missing Crabbe? How many of you out there suspected Crabbe? And how many of you out there suspect and miss him even more now? Will Wisp's answers ever actually seem to answer anything, or will they only lead to more questions? Just some things to think about before the next update...
Harry hesitated. Did he still trust Draco's word? Yesterday, the answer would have been an automatic yes. But now…
whisky. The bottle had smashed against the wall right next to Draco, just barely missing him but sending broken glass and amber liquid splashing across his skin. He could still feel the sharp sting from the tiny shards of glass slicing across his bare bicep, burrowing into his flesh, accompanied by the burn of the whisky searing into the cuts. Pansy had been the one to pick the glass from his arm using a pair of tweezers and a sewing needle. Fenrir had not said a word about it but had apologized in his own way by buying Draco an expensive bottle of wine they had shared together that night at Fen's house. Draco had been too scared not to drink it.
up to something. As Harry spied it, he grinned smugly. Malfoy was alone and, according to the map, had broken into Snape's old office.
At the acquiescence, Zacharias visibly sagged with relief, and Harry felt a twinge of pity for the man at the obvious gratitude he was doing his best to hide.
"You're all right, Daphne," Potter murmured, reaching out one hand to place lightly on her shoulder. As his palm came into contact with her violet robes, she shuddered and suddenly moved, somehow winding up in Potter's lap, clutching at the front of his t-shirt and sobbing into his neck. Draco frowned. She was clearly upset, but he did not like her being comforted by Potter like that, who had moved one hand to stroke the long blond hair along her spine and placed the other against the back of her head, whispering to her that it would be all right, she was safe now, she was alive, but she sobbed even harder and shook her head.
"Um," a voice began, "you can open your eyes."
"About all of it!" Harry sighed explosively, sitting up without warning and swinging his legs over the mattress to sit perched on the edge, meeting Ron's gaze with a serious expression. "You know that Zacharias Smith was expelled a few days ago."
"I've been waiting for that day for nearly a decade now."
Without warning, the lamps were suddenly doused as a dozen lit candles flickered into view, startling everyone in the room. Hermione rose from her seat and gazed around at everyone in quiet speculation. "Some of you suggested we hold a memorial service," she began softly, gaze flicking around the room, "for the three we've lost so far—Hannah, Mandy, and Terry." Heads bowed at her words, a sad, somber air settling over everything. "I think we should start with a moment of silence, and then open the floor for anyone who would like to say something. However," her eyes narrowed as she stared at everyone in turn, "this is a memorial service, so I would ask that everything said here remain respectful and free from accusation. This is not a time for confrontation. Am I understood?" Heads dipped in acknowledgment, and Hermione relaxed. "All right then. A moment's silence, and then whoever would like to start can do so."
The three Slytherins all stared at him before laughing. "You assume yours are even worth mentioning," Pansy chuckled. "Or thinking about. Or in any way acknowledging."
Draco said nothing, wishing Potter would just get it over with already. He took a deep breath to steel himself, determined not to cry in front of Harry when the brunet finally got around to ripping Draco's heart straight from his chest. At least he had been given the gift of the last few weeks, even if it did not extend past that cold deserted classroom. Draco had always known it would end eventually; he had just hoped it would not be so soon.
But Draco said nothing, only continued to make Harry feel more incredible than he could remember feeling in a very long time.
The sight that greeted Harry on the other side nearly made him stumble in dread.
"Come here," he said thickly, gesturing to Draco, who climbed up onto the bed and lay down beside Harry, one eyebrow slightly raised. Pulling him closer, Harry didn't hesitate to press their mouths together, understanding Draco's earlier frustration with the robes as he placed one hand on Draco's chest and encountered fabric.
"Your hair is different," he blurted suddenly, instantly flushing pink at his own words.
Although, Harry was no longer sure if he knew the Malfoy sitting before him—the one who liked to read Muggle poetry and was now capable of holding a civil conversation, even joking with Harry. Had Harry ever heard him tell a joke before that day?
"Can I ask you lot a question?" Harry wondered, his words colored with hesitation. He wasn't sure if his question would be a difficult or painful one to answer, but there was still so much that he did not know about them.
"All right," the blond agreed instantly. "Let's go back to my dorm." His hand drifted lower along Harry's abdomen as he spoke and Harry quickly grabbed it before it could continue its downward path.
"Of course I do," Malfoy panted, writhing as Harry reached what he suspected was a ticklish spot. "Why wouldn't I? Are you saying you were assuming I
"When you and Potter were fighting," the other man explained.
to eat dinner."
That's what he stormed in seventeen minutes ago to discuss? Some goddamn fucking tie that he wants back so he can look nice for his
"Trust me, Draco, I wanted to know," Potter said in a low voice, continuing to spread kisses over every inch of Draco's bare flesh, some gentle and some biting, and Draco felt himself growing even harder at the anticipation of trying to predict which one the next kiss would be.
At the name, Draco's insides squirmed; he had nearly forgotten about that blasted Hippogriff. "So that's what happened to it," he said under his breath. He had heard from his father that the creature had somehow vanished without a trace.
But he needed
A sudden fusillade of bright sparks shot up overhead as Hermione cast a spell to call for attention, the sight of the sparks succeeding in quieting everyone as they once again turned to face her.
to fuck you."
He still could not believe what had happened last night.
"And you let him in so the two of you could talk?" Harry said in a nudging tone when Draco fell silent.
The redhead flushed nearly the color of his hair, mumbling something beneath his breath.
Draco's lips twitched. "No, I imagine her feelings towards me at the time were quite different."
Ron frowned. "But we have no idea where they are."
Draco woke to sunlight stabbing him in the eyes. "Blaise, you fucker, shut the fucking curtains!" he groaned, burying his face in his pillow as he tugged the blankets up more securely around Harry and himself.
"Christ, I can't believe he convinced you to set up there," Caelix shook his head and smirked. "Is this bloke incredibly fit or something?"
"I suppose it would have to be, wouldn't it?" he said lightly, combing gentle fingers through the black strands. "My imagination would certainly never be twisted enough to dream up anything with hair as unmanageable as yours."
"Yes, I know," she sighed. "We found Michael and Anthony in the library, and both of them said they had been there since lunch, but again, no one else can confirm it."
Draco had no fucking idea.
Seek laughed. "It'd be a much better answer than simply just telling you 'yes', wouldn't it?"
Caelix was definitely attractive, Harry decided. He was funny and had a nice smile and a charming laugh, as well as a pleasant personality and deep turquoise eyes. But Harry just wasn't
"Sure, Malfoy," Weasley agreed, leaning back in his chair. "Same toward you, as far as Zabini goes."
"But it's freezing out there," Weasley said, blinking stupidly.
After all, Harry had time. Finally, for what felt like the first time in his life, he had time to just breathe. He had time to just relax and enjoy the fact that he had
As though her final words had been a stamp of dismissal, everybody rose to their feet and began to make their way from the room, Michael and Anthony in the front. "We know where it is so we can show you lot," Harry heard Michael say, and Hermione and Ron followed behind to oversee everything.
he thought savagely.
"Do the two of you Floo each other every day when you're apart?" Draco asked incredulously, earning another chuckle from Weasley.
"How are you feeling though, Draco?" Harry asked softly, swaying them slowly in place. "I know today was a lot, so we can just go to bed if you'd prefer. But if you'd rather be by yourself, I completely understand."
Decision made and determination mounting, Harry quickened his stride, heart pounding faster as he approached the room. Unlike the previous time when they had been left open, the library doors were now shut, but Harry did not allow that to discourage him. He wanted to see Draco and he wanted to resolve whatever had gone wrong between them. He did not want Malfoy to remain upset, and he especially did not want the blond to be upset with him specifically.
feel the wind rush through his hair and ruffle his clothes; feel the tingle in his gut and swoop in his stomach every time he dropped into a steep dive; feel the competitive edge that accompanied scanning for the Snitch, the yearning to catch it first, be the best, trumping every other sensation. Harry trusted his instincts and relied on himself and his teammates—it was a feeling he could not compare to any other.
He shot her a disgusted look. "How the hell should I know?"
"It means that Draco's planning on wanking over himself later," Blaise told her with a grin, and Draco glared. "Just make sure you take the jacket off before you wank about it, yeah? If you return my clothing with any spunk on them, I shall be very upset with you."
He began to kiss Harry more urgently, pressing open-mouthed kisses along the man's chin and down his throat, hands still exploring the bare skin beneath Potter's t-shirt.
, Ron. Why don't
"He is not plotting your death, Pansy, he's plotting mine!" Draco ground out, not sure why they were arguing over such a strange thing as which of them got to be murdered by Harry Potter. "He's already tried to kill me once in that bathroom and he's now plotting a way to finish the job!"
"God, Harry, you weren't kidding when you said they mostly talk about fannies and knobs," Weasley said in disbelief. "You lot do realize that there's more in this world to discuss other than people's bits, don't you?"
Drawing in a deep breath to tell Harry just that, Draco paused and tilted his head in confusion. Now that the two were no longer touching and his focus wasn't elsewhere, he was beginning to feel strange. Was there something wrong with the room? "Harry…"
Chuckling, Malfoy eyed Harry strangely. "No offense, Potter," he said in amusement, "but you're, maybe not the
"Fuck, Potter, association with you really can change anyone's mind about anything, can't it?" Pansy said in an impressed voice, peering at the picture as well. "Draco, this might actually make all the cursed hate mail you get stop completely."
As if lifting the thoughts straight from Harry's brain, Malfoy's eyes slid down to lock on the wide expanse of visible skin, appearing tanner in the weak moonlight than usual.
, he thought dizzily as he pulled back to gulp in large lungfuls of air. Malfoy's lips did not stop their assault, moving down Harry's chin to the skin of his throat, sucking on both collarbones and the hollow between them before moving back up to the skin below his ear. Harry tilted his head and groaned.
"I think that will become clear upon accepting the job," Draco said dryly. Even though he felt certain that the man would accept, there was always the possibility of being turned down. But those fears turned out to be unnecessary.
She said nothing, flushing darker in response.
That was the point at which Draco knew he had to leave, before he decided to show them a few of the nastier spells his deranged aunt had taught him. Hexing a group of fourteen-year-old girls would most definitely not be looked kindly upon, by either McGonagall or the Wizengamot. Unfortunately for Draco, he would not be able to curse the wretched brats to within an inch of their pathetic existences.
, Harry thought, narrowing his eyes at Ron, who grinned back as though he knew exactly what Harry was thinking.
Malfoy clutched at Harry's shoulder and straightened himself somewhat, looking the brunet directly in the eye from only centimeters away, and Harry felt light-headed at both the contact and the closeness. "I am, though," he said softly, grey eyes searching Harry's face with an intensity that made the brunet shiver. "And you understand that, don't you? I know you do, Potter. You understand exactly what I mean by that. Neither of us was really meant to live through it, were we? We aren't meant to be alive. And yet here we are."
"I knew you returned the attraction," the blond answered simply. "I knew that you at least felt
Potter raised one eyebrow. "Are you telling me your hair isn't soft, then?"
"You finally grew tits?" Draco asked in astonishment, peering down at her chest and pretending to search. "Where? Show me."
"And this last one hasn't been opened, correct?" the fake platinum hair nodded toward the other velvet box, slightly smaller and more rounded than the first one had been.
"You really want to be locked down in that cellar, don't you, Smith?" he drawled, slanting the Hufflepuff a disgusted look. "Trust me when I tell you, you won't like what you find down there. I'd be careful when speaking if I were you, unless you really do want to find out what's waiting for you down there in the dark. Because I, personally, would have no problem throwing you down those stairs without a wand and leaving you to stumble blindly around in growing fear and growing hunger until you finally find what's in the wine room. We may even happen to just forget you're down there once we find a way out of here. Wouldn't that be fun for you, to be left behind in the dark like that, with no food, no water, no wand, and no way out?" His quiet words succeeded in capturing the attention of everybody in the room. Smith's eyes grew wider and wider with every smooth word that fell from Nott's lips.
"Well, don't be," he snapped. "I'm
Half the Slytherins snickered but Nott merely shrugged, making no visible reaction to the comment. "Don't ever trust a person who smiles for no reason, Potter. You, as an Auror, should know that by now."
"You don't get it, Harry!" Malfoy wept, turning away to hide his face. "If I can't be with you, then I'd rather be dead!"
"No!" he shouted, jumping to his feet. The armchair behind him made a loud scraping sound as it was shoved back from his sudden movement. "I didn't! It wasn't me! I didn't do anything wrong! The only mistake I made was ever feeling sorry for Zacharias fucking Smith! I should have just let that pathetic git spend the night alone!"
Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry felt himself growing frustrated that he was refusing to even entertain the thought that it might be true, even though Harry had known how Draco would react. "Even if that was somehow true, she would have had to keep dosing me for it to work, Harry."
The Slytherins seemed to relax slightly at his words, falling quiet as they all settled into bed. Parkinson and Zabini were sharing a mattress, and Harry felt that familiar twinge of loneliness at the way she curled into him and the sight of him wrapping his arm around her in response.
"He's just scared," Harry said in a quiet voice. The five Slytherins turned to him as one to give him matching looks of incredulity.
"I have to give him ten points, Potter," Pansy grinned. "For sheer cheek, if nothing else."
"I know," Harry smiled, "it's a Potter family trait, like black hair and near-sightedness. We can only be as incredible as we look, you know."
Stepping forward carefully, Harry entered the room with wary steps, head swiveling in all directions as gas lamps flared softly to life, casting a yellow glow over the gloomy room he stood in. It appeared to be an unused bedroom, one that looked to have not been touched in years. There was a thick layer of dust over the furnishings, as well as a sort of staleness in the air that seemed to have a taste and texture to it, coating Harry's tongue and feeling heavy in his lungs.
"Get off
Ron was silent for a full twenty-seven seconds before turning back to Hermione and beginning to lecture her on the multitudes of all the numerous mental and physical benefits of playing Quidditch—all of which she responded to by huffing and disappearing once more behind her thick leather textbook.
"Where did Draco disappear to?" Harry wondered, squinting up into the bright sky and hoping that the subject change would be enough of a distraction for Zabini.
about him. And yet he had no response.
"Weren't you sent a brand-new set of personalized Quidditch gear by someone through the post?" Harry raised one eyebrow. "And wasn't there one week where you got sent three marriage proposals from three different women? And remember that time you were asked out by that Hufflepuff sixth who had been stalking you for a month? And wasn't Hermione gifted that insanely expensive dress and pair of shoes from some wealthy bloke and asked to wear it on a date with him? And sent a stack of personalized parchment and that outrageously expensive quill and ink set from someone?
"Do you really think I would be foolish enough to commit murder in my own home?" he asked in a low voice, glaring at Anthony Goldstein. "Especially with three fucking Aurors and whatever the hell Granger does in the DMLE present?"
A sudden noise had Harry whirling around, a soft whisper like rustling fabric that Harry wasn't sure if he had imagined or not. Heart thumping wildly, he crept back into the kitchen and glanced around but did not see a single thing out of place, no haunted eyes staring back at him and nothing lurking in the shadows. Taking a deep breath, Harry made a quick, thorough route of both the kitchen and the sitting room before concluding that he must have imagined the sound.
"Oh, were you wanting to beg?" Blaise said in feigned surprise. "By all means, Weasley, feel free to do so. We won't stop you."
"You're all he's talked about, you know," Blaise told him, hearing Potter's neck crack as his head whipped around to gaze at the Slytherin. "For the whole of term. Ever since the very start of the school year, you are all he's talked about. Drove me and Pansy a bit spare, to be honest."
"No Time to Hate"—Emily Dickinson
"I wouldn't bet on it, no," Pansy said calmly, plucking another chocolate out of the large heart-shaped box they had chosen from the enormous pile of presents Potter had already received so far.
"Sod off," Blaise retorted with a light flush. "You're just jealous because those birds have better tits than you."
The statement made Harry flush even darker, feeling embarrassment spread through him from head-to-toe. God, was Ron saying that he had heard the two of them? Fucking hell, did that mean that everybody had heard them? Glancing at Draco, he found the man red-faced but smirking down at his tea.
"Only the ones lucky enough to see," Draco smirked, raking a hand through Harry's hair.
"No use fighting your fate, darling," she said sweetly, opening her eyes to give him a saccharine smile. "Just give in to it."
Finally, after long minutes, Draco broke the kiss, pulling away from Harry and sitting up in order to uncap the silver bottle lying several inches away on the bed. Squeezing a generous amount of the viscous, gel-like liquid into his hand, he coated his fingers liberally before reaching out to wrap a slick palm around Potter's hard cock, stroking from base to tip so slowly his hand did not even appear to be moving. Loud, harsh breaths sounded in the room as Potter writhed and squirmed beneath the blond, silently pleading with him to move faster.
. Draco had written him the previous night, just one word,
"How long ago was this?" Harry's mind was whirling. He wasn't sure what time it was but knew he hadn't been gone very long.
Seek's smirk widened. "It's a surprise."
Harry raised one eyebrow in amusement. "You want me to improve my vocabulary to use in classes based solely around how to suck a man's dick just to make me seem more professional by using big words?"
As he exited the Hall, he could feel, just as certainly as if he'd been looking into them, two familiar green eyes burning a hole in the back of his head. The desire to turn around in order to check to see if Potter really was staring at him was strong enough to nearly freeze Draco in place, but he somehow managed to continue dragging his feet forward.
Drawing a deep breath, Harry finally gathered the nerve to look over at the blond next to him, to find Draco glaring viciously down at the table, all embarrassed amusement from earlier gone.
"That's just his panda bear instincts," Blaise snickered. "He has no choice but to be cuddly and forgiving."
With a start, his earlier words came back to Draco, punching a hole through the thick barrier of grief surrounding him and causing his eyelids to slide shut.
Maybe that was the real evil plot Malfoy had been working toward. It certainly sounded evil enough. And slightly intriguing, if Harry was being honest with himself, but mostly evil.
"Good," Harry said stiffly, but there was something much softer in his posture as he turned back in Draco's direction.
Maybe the connection really was as personal as Harry had suspected.
Third of all, he has a sodding girlfriend! And fourth of all,
"You have nothing to worry about," the brunet murmured, resting one hand on Draco's thigh. "Absolutely nothing is going to happen between me and Caelix, I promise. He doesn't compare to you, Draco, he never did. He never could."
She nodded. "This house is even darker than I remember it being." Another shiver raked through her, and Harry put a hand on her shoulder in comfort.
"Potter," Malfoy choked, then straightened and attempted to adopt his usual cool demeanor. "What are you doing here?"
"Right," Ginny agreed, laughing as it was now Harry's turn to appear outraged.
Nodding in resignation, Harry finally looked over to Draco, only to find the blond silent and half-hidden behind his hair, curled in on himself as he glared down at his lap. Hoping that Malfoy would be willing to accept his comfort in public, Harry reached out to twine their hands together, fingers interwoven and resting on Draco's thigh.
Yet despite his temporary panic over the idea of never again seeing his childhood nemesis, the blond was more or less put from his mind. Until the first of September, that was.
Pansy laughed. "I can tell you for a fact, Blaise, that I have appreciated my own naked female form many times."
"I just told you what it's about," Draco huffed, crossing his arms across his chest defensively. Why the hell were Blaise and Pansy always thinking they were anywhere near intelligent enough to psychoanalyze a person? He did not want to be psychoanalyzed! They were not Mind Healers and he was not in St. Mungo's, for fuck's sake.
The statement visibly startled Malfoy, who dropped his defensive stance in surprise as he eyed Harry as though attempting to pierce his skin with a stare intense enough to peel back his flesh and uncover the truth hidden beneath. "You were?" He sounded bewildered, almost as though he had never had another person express concern for his well-being.
"We haven't been since the end of sixth year. We had always meant to get back together once Voldemort was gone, but…" He shrugged again.
"What did he say?" Harry interrupted excitedly.
Draco focused on his inhalations, breaths shaky as he buried his face in Seek's chest.
Draco cleared his throat. "Shall we get going then? I'll admit that I'm curious as to where we're headed."
"Well," she blushed slightly, "don't you remember the Yule Ball?"
"We've all been looking for you for hours," Harry said quietly. "You and Stephen disappeared ages ago."
And never before had Harry been more grateful that they had—if not, he would never have found himself lying in a bed next to Draco. And nobody had ever made him feel the way he did when he was with Draco.
And he fully intended to keep his word.
"What happened with Malfoy?" Dean asked. "And where did Caelix go?" He began craning his neck and peering around, as though expecting to spot the man hidden behind something.
"I know." He ran a hand through his black hair and sighed heavily. "I know, Ron."
A small stream cut a trickling path through the grass and flowers near the table, winding itself past a large willow tree that hung drooping and sad over the water. Would the tree appear that way if magic wasn't holding everything in place, freezing time and forever halting life in an unnatural state of existence? Could anything even be considered alive if it could no longer grow and die as its time came?
And the next second, he was right. He was sat directly on Seek's lap, his hands pressed to Seek's chest. He glanced up, somehow surprised to find Seek's face only centimeters away. His arms were wrapped around Draco's waist, holding him close, his legs drawn up and knees pressing into Draco's back. It was the most intimate position Draco had ever been in. There was absolutely no way to hide or escape Seek's heated gaze, and the closeness of the moment sent a whisper of insecurity zipping down Draco's spine.
"No," he said honestly. He hadn't even ever considered bringing any of the men he dated up there. It was a special spot, and Harry had never so much as entertained the idea of showing someone else such a place. But with Draco, it just felt right.
"You're the only disgusting one here, not him," Harry snarled in response, ignoring the question as he allowed his drawn-back arm to snap forward once more, feeling his knuckles bruise as they smashed across the bridge of Smith's nose, right between his wide watery eyes.
"The potion itself is legal, Harry," Malfoy argued. "The only thing that was illegal was my, you know, intentions for it," he finished sheepishly before straightening and shrugging defiantly at the three Gryffindors. "Evil Dot, remember?" he said, pointing to himself. "I can hardly be blamed for following my nature."
," he sneered the name, "doesn't compare to what
Only a few more hours until Draco was safe.
"We don't know yet," Hermione answered, rubbing his arm. "McGonagall and Gladstone were still speaking to her when I left; I wanted to find you right away. I seriously doubt, however, that she is going to be getting off as lightly as all the others have, especially in the new face of the most recent events."
"Is this your first time doing this, Harry?" Malfoy asked quietly, and Harry glanced up to see the blond staring at him oddly, in a way that Harry was almost tempted to label as
"Okay," Harry nodded, offering him a smile. He rubbed his upper arms for several moments before releasing him and walking back to his bike for his tools. He wondered if it would be too much to ask Draco about his living situation at the clubhouse. Why the hell was he living there? God, there was still everything in the world that Harry did not know about the man. All he knew was his first name.
Draco thought that he did have a very good idea, actually, but Harry was once more covering his mouth with his own and Draco decided that arguing semantics with the man was not nearly as important as returning the bone-melting kisses being shared between them.
"Hello, Granger," he replied cautiously.
"Er, yeah," Potter flushed. "I mean, only if you want to. Would you want to?" He looked so ridiculously flustered and so endearingly hopeful that Draco could feel the normally thick and impenetrable walls he had constructed around himself and his own emotions crumble just a tiny bit in response.
"Fen…"
"Is everything okay, Harry?"
A sad sigh reached his ears. "Very well then, Harry," she conceded, handing over a vial of liquid. "This is the antidote; he must take the entire vial. Understand, however, that it is very, very difficult to convince a person under the effects of a love potion to actually take the antidote of their own free will. It is nearly always impossible to convince a person under this sort of magical influence that what they are feeling is not real—he will fight you on this, he will argue and defend his feelings, and he will most likely attempt to seduce you out of questioning both him and his attraction for you, do you understand?"
Half the table roared with laughter as the other half nodded.
Glancing up, he noticed Seek watching him silently.
In fact, Harry thought, listening to the house groan and creak around them, it felt as though the entire house had swallowed everything inside it and tore it away from the rest of the world—at that moment, nothing felt real to Harry. The outside world did not exist. None of them still existed. The manor they were trapped in had become a world of its own, a dangerous world, one that so many had already not survived. The soft gas lamps cast tiny pools of light on their surroundings, trying desperately to pierce the ever-encroaching darkness that seemed to be shifting closer and closer towards them. It seemed that every time Harry took his eyes off one of the many long-fingered shadows stretching from the walls, it appeared to have moved closer the next time he looked in that direction. Was it all in his head? Was he simply imagining it? Had the old house and the threatening atmosphere gotten to him?
Shaking his head slowly, Harry could only manage a bemused grin. "How much extra time do you have to plan into your daily schedule just to get between rooms in your own fucking home?" It seemed almost ridiculous to Harry. Anybody living in a house that size had better make sure to have everything they needed with them when they left their rooms, because having to trek constantly around the Manor sounded very unappealing to him.
The way he said the final word, in a strange combination of fear and reluctance, automatically made Harry's blood boil. Had that bastard, whoever the hell he was, done something to hurt Draco?
"Good man!" Blaise clapped him on the back. "There's that Gryffindor bravery I've been waiting for over the past fortnight! You've finally found yourself again, Potter, congratulations and welcome back."
Draco shuddered again. "You don't even want to know, Potter, trust me."
Standing slowly, he winced at the throb in his knees, joints creaking as he straightened up to kiss the other boy gently before resting his forehead against Malfoy's.
Fenrir sat up slowly, eyeing Draco like a hungry snake about to strike. "It's not a bother, Draco. If your car needs fixing, I'll fix it."
Pulling back enough to breathe, Draco flattened his hands and slid them up Potter's back, tugging at him and moving them around until they were both sitting up, with Draco balanced on his knees and Potter straddling his thighs, the Auror sat snugly in his lap. Harry straightened more fully, smiling in approval of the new position as he once again wrapped both arms around Draco's neck, pressing his weight down just as Draco thrust up.
"No," Draco drawled, and Harry could practically hear the man rolling his eyes. "I meant, you know…I'm not going to do anything. I know what Theo was saying, but I promise that I'm not going to molest you in your sleep or jump you the second you close your eyes or anything."
about helping you gain entrance. And for—" His words were cut off as Harry interrupted with a kiss. Hearing the blond apologize was just too strange, even if he had only actually used the word
Everyone was getting wasted tonight, Draco knew that for certain.
The pace continued as Draco groaned and thrashed, panting wildly as he stared down the length of his body at the incredibly arousing sight of Harry's dark head bobbing up and down, at the sight of his own prick disappearing over and over into Harry's wet mouth.
Clearly, his life had begun its decline.
an albino,
be all right."
"I'll be fine," she disagreed, a determined expression on her face, but Draco shook his head harder, feeling his long hair whip through the air.
"I thought you hated me," Harry turned away, unable to look at the raw emotion shaping Draco's face. "After the morning of the Hospital Wing. I was so sure you went right back to hating me. But…I never stopped missing you, Draco."
And without waiting for a response, he turned and ran.
. I can't just…I…you're not in my charge of me in
"Sod off, you prat," Draco hissed. "Stop acting like I was some innocent untouched flower! Harry was not the first person to suck me off! Pansy, tell Blaise what an amazing experience it was for you! Tell him how much it changed your life! Tell him what an honor it was to be the very first person to be allowed such a privilege!"
He could just as easily be plotting
"I know," she agreed. "I trust you two. But…but I…" She glanced between her sister and the two Gryffindors, and Harry could see the indecision within her warring on her face. "I—I need to go with Padma," she said in a rush.
the one who needs to pay up!"
"Hey, I didn't say you would do it on purpose," Blaise said with a shrug. "But just make sure that you don't spend the entire date comparing the Muggle world to the Magical one and telling Potter how inferior the Muggle world really is. If you can convince him that you've changed and show him that you've become a person now capable of being around Muggles and moving on from childhood prejudices that were instilled in you since birth, Potter will fall in love with you so hard that even Pansy and I will feel it all the way back here at the castle."
And suddenly, Draco could not stay there any longer. He had to get out, even if it was only for a couple of hours. Checking his pockets for his phone, he grabbed his keys and hurried outside, thanking the God he did not believe in that nobody noticed him leave. He threw himself into his car without hesitation and left, driving in the opposite direction as Fenrir. He wanted nothing more than to drive forever, end up an entire world away from the Death Eaters' clubhouse.
Harry stared at her in both shock and admiration. "You're being serious. You really want to accept his invitation."
"Well, what do you
To his embarrassment, he felt a lump beginning to form in his throat. How was it that a virtual stranger with an extremely unpleasant past in relation to his home and family was standing there asking about his wellbeing whilst radiating such genuine concern and offering her heartfelt condolences for his loss?
"Dismissed, Auror," Wescott sighed. With a respectful nod, Gibson vanished from the room. Turning back to Harry and Ron, Wescott addressed them wearily. "Take Malfoy and Goyle to the safe house and don't let them out of your sight. Take Longbottom with you. We'll have a rotating guard stationed around the perimeter of the building at all times. If we can get a hold of Caelix, I'll send him along to see what he can do about strengthening the wards on the house. I've also alerted the other Aurors to be on the lookout for Zabini. Right now, he's the only lead we have."
"—be perfect together, the two of us—"
"I've still been with more people than you have, Draco," Blaise grumbled. "You're just a sad virginal hedgehog."
"And who says there's a difference?" Draco could feel his heart racing in his chest, thrumming against the inside of his ribs.
"You don't fucking know anything about what I'm going to say," Draco spat. "Or about me. If you did, then you would have realized that when I ask for fidelity, I fucking well mean it!"
Stepping toward the round table nearby and pushing all thoughts of Zabini from his mind, Harry immediately spotted the rectangular box that Ron had spoken of, the soft velvet covering it a deep emerald, nearly black. A thick silver ribbon was wrapped around the lid in a large bow.
, he thought fondly, as he reached out to stroke one golden petal. Would all those flowers be dead at that moment if the earth had been allowed to lead its natural course on the garden?
Harry stared at him. "I don't care what the rules are, I'm taking fifty points away from you."
"He's staring at me again!" Draco hissed, resisting the urge to slam his fist down on the table they were sat at. Madam Pince would most likely gut him if he dared injure her precious books, and Draco could think of much better things he would prefer to be doing rather than dripping entrails all over the floor of the library; he preferred his entrails where they were, thank you very much. His guts were far too good for the library floor.
"I came to find you," Harry said in a similar tone, sounding lost and confused. "I know you have a free period, so I was coming to find you. I heard you lot talking…" He paused, staring at Draco with a look that seemed to pierce right through the blond. "What were you talking about?"
He drew a cauldron bubbling and overflowing, tapping the parchment with his wand and performing a tricky spell to make the ink move, charming the cauldron to explode in stages before replaying itself—first it was calm, then the bubbles appeared, then it began overflowing furiously, then there was a massive explosion.
"Hmm," Hermione hummed, looking down at her notepad as she scribbled into it. "Interesting."
The clubhouse was silent. Everything was dark; the room was as black as tar, the darkness making everything somehow seem quieter. Beside him, Fenrir was snoring gently, his breath warm on the back of Draco's neck. He had been lying in bed for hours, refusing to allow himself to fall asleep.
"So where will we be spending the night, then?" Zabini spoke up, wrapping one arm protectively around Parkinson's shoulders.
"Sorry?" he said playfully, knowing Draco knew he wasn't sorry at all. "Does this mean you'll finally tell me who he is?"
that voice. He had known it nearly his entire life, recognized it since childhood, sat next to it in classes. It was a voice that he had never expected to hear ever again, because the owner of that voice was
"For speaking up for me back there. For defending me from Smith."
As he rested his head back against the chair, waiting for the allotted hour to arrive, Draco could not help but think of Vince and his father. Against his will, another unpleasant memory of Cyril Crabbe forced itself into his mind, making his stomach churn. The three younger Slytherins had once again been over at Vincent's, sometime during the summer between their third and fourth years at Hogwarts. They had been playing and messing around, laughing and running through the hall between Vince's bedroom and the second-level sitting room, when Cyril stormed upstairs out of nowhere, screaming at Vincent for making too much goddamn noise. He grabbed Vince by the front of his robes and hauled him nearly off his feet as he shouted in his face, yelling about the ungrateful annoyance that was Vincent and how Cyril could not fucking wait until Hogwarts started once again so the boy would no longer be underfoot.
Padma nodded jerkily, still refusing to let go of Anthony, who held her even tighter.
Fuck. Draco didn't know what to do, he didn't know what he wanted. He wasn't sure if he had ever really understood himself.
"Mate," Ron began, sounding amused. "I'm not giving you shit for it, honest. I'm just surprised, is all."
"I think he really is trying to change," she said softly, turning back to face Harry, "even if he hasn't fully gotten there yet. But maybe all he needs is a chance to learn from his mistakes. Maybe he's already learned from what he did today, Harry."
. After all, there was evil, and then there was just plain weird, and Harry would prefer to deal with the evil rather than the weird.
had really been a
?" he asked slowly, the three words falling from his mouth in a cascade of combined confusion and curiosity, sounding as though he was attempting to speak in a language he was not yet familiar with.
"Fuck, I'm sorry," he apologized, releasing his grip on Harry's arm to rub his back soothingly. His voice was weighted with a sincerity Harry would never have expected from the man. "I should have realized where the Floo would take you, I didn't think, Harry, I'm sorry." The feel of Malfoy's hand smoothing calming circles into his back began to help; Harry could feel the heavy knot blocking his windpipe, thick and chalky where it sat, finally start to loosen and crumble, finally allowing air into his lungs. "Just breathe, Harry," Malfoy murmured. "It's okay, you're fine, just breathe."
Potter watched them for several moments in bemusement before turning back to Draco and smiling nervously. "Can we talk down here, maybe?" He indicated a smaller corridor branching off from the main hallway and Draco nodded stiffly, gesturing for Potter to lead the way. He could feel his heart racing in his chest as they walked side-by-side in utter silence.
"That's not true! You know that's not true!"
Harry shook his head in reluctant amusement. "Tell me more about your life, Gin," he said, wanting desperately to get the subject away from himself. "Tell me more about your team, tell me about the people you've met. Are you dating anyone new?"
The grin on Seek's face widened as he hummed. "And yet, you don't mind this fool touching you, do you?"
At that moment, Draco felt more at ease than he could remember feeling in the longest time, more than he thought should even be possible, considering the horrifying reality still awaiting him on the other side of the bedroom door. And even though he knew he should be terrified, knew that death was still coming for him, ready to violently spring out and snatch him away at any moment, as he lay in silent darkness wrapped securely in Harry's arms, Draco felt nothing but content—happy, even. And even if horror and death found him in the morning, for that one night, he felt
here."
Their potion that day was brewed in absolute silence.
"I think so," Ron answered with another shrug. "I thought I heard someone up here earlier but I haven't actually seen him either yet this morning."
"No, not really," Harry sighed, picking up his fork once more and scraping it against his plate just to have something to do with his fingers, all the while wishing desperately that Hermione did not have to speak so quietly when speaking about Draco and him in public. The frustration that had been welling up inside him over the past few days was beginning to rear its ugly head once more.
"Yes, but arrogance is not," Draco retorted. "It's not as attractive a trait as you seem to think."
Even watching the man read was intriguing.
"I thought he was
"I do care about you," Harry said miserably, knowing he would forever be haunted by the memory of this moment. "I care about you so much, Draco, you have no idea. The time we spent together…the way you made me feel…but—" he took a deep breath, bracing himself, "but it ends now. Madam Pomfrey is right, this antidote is not optional. If I have to force your mouth open and pour it straight down your throat, I will."
"Yeah," Parkinson agreed. "We're all fine, you didn't need to scare us half to death with that sodding pounding. Next time, Potter, knock like a normal person."
Harry stared at him in bewilderment. "Of course. What are you expecting, them to ambush you and string you up as an example to all other Slytherins?" The words had been joking, but Draco visibly shuddered and looked away. Harry gaped at him in shock. "Draco! You cannot honestly be thinking that my friends would do something like that!" The blond squirmed in his seat but remained silent. "They don't see you as a Death Eater. That's not how people see you." Harry had been intending to comfort his boyfriend, but when Malfoy spoke, his voice whipped out low and harsh.
"How old are the two of you again?" Pansy drawled, shaking her head at both boys.
you've ever wanted, Draco Malfoy?" Hermione's tone turned teasing. "I seem to remember you getting everything you ever wanted. In fact, you were quite the spoiled brat."
"Let's go then, Nev," Harry said, feeling a nearly frantic need to get to the Slytherins to check that everything was all right. The two men strode from the room and paused, glancing around themselves. "Um, you don't happen to know where Malfoy's bedroom is, do you?"
"Are you going to say please?" the other man asked cheekily, hastening to continue at the look Harry gave him. "All right, all right, don't go all Chosen One on me, I'm only fucking teasing, I'm not Voldemort."
"A mole?" Harry said in indignation. "Why a bloody mole?"
"Hey, Trace," Pansy smiled, leaning over to hug her tightly, and Draco felt his lips twitch. Despite both of them already belonging to members of the club, he had always suspected that Pansy had a thing for Tracey. And with the way that Tracey smiled and returned the embrace, he wasn't certain her attraction was at all misplaced.
"Yes," he answered, but then hesitated. "He did not, however, tell me about
"It's true, she did say that she missed you," Harry nodded. "Apparently Luna thinks you're nice for some reason. Prob'ly 'cos she doesn't actually know how violent and evil you really are."
"I know," he said in a voice that rasped. "I love the both of you too."
"No," Blaise answered, "it's a leather jacket. It's their version of dragonhide, I suppose, but made from a different animal. Apparently, Muggle girls can't resist a bloke in a leather jacket, and I'm assuming that it's the same for bent Muggle blokes as well. Try it on, let's see how it looks."
At that, Gregory waved a careless hand, in a gesture reflective of the amount of fear he had for Blaise, which was clearly none. "Hey, Draco?" he asked hesitantly, sounding serious and startling Draco somewhat with the sudden mood shift. "Why didn't you ever tell me that the two of you were together?"
, Harry decided, feeling the searing blush from earlier return with a vengeance. "It's not for anything like that," he said stiffly.
"They're filthy-minded people, Potter, ones who should not be encouraged," Draco told him.
"I'm not really sure what any of you lot are talking about," Potter said, sidling up to Draco and twining their hands together, "but I'm going to just be stealing this one now if you don't mind. I, er, promise not to bring him back too late?"
