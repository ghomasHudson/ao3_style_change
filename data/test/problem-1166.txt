” She explained, “You look handsome, especially now that you wear Draco’s ring. What I mean is your inside. You look
His emotions were spilling out of him, not being able to catch them, to open them, to comprehend them.
Draco’s body stiffened around him. Then, with a whispered, he added, “You are planning to go back to Turner.”
Harry had considered disappearing. Telling them he was sick, that he had flown to Africa, that he had left the Wizarding World forever and was no longer a Wizard. But he
“You’re mad at me,” Harry whispered, his voice husky and low. He thrust deeper, and Draco whimpered.
But Harry’s impulses were too present, and he couldn’t stop touching the mark softly. Draco breathed out, “It’s nothing.”
Leaving aside his brief and almost non-existent relationship with Parkinson, he had always been alone. Single, is the word, but for him, it was
words his mother had told Harry minutes ago. Draco looked cold, distant and tired. Not open to any kind of conversation, any discussion, anything that had to do with opening his heart and talking to Draco.
, he wanted to run away right that second. “But, I thought it was better if you knew he blushed the entire week at work.”
And Draco’s smirk was back on his face, and Harry took the moment of silence to really check on Draco. To notice the dark under-eye circles, the tired and sleepy gaze he held. To observe the way his hair was brushed tightly to contrast the rest of his outfit…
“Hi,” He greeted her, letting her kiss him gently on the cheek. He joined her inside the empty office. “Ron is doing extra hours today. He says he’s definitely going to be late and then die of boredom.”
” Harry softened his voice as much as he could, allowing himself to get closer to him, close enough to smell that incense his body impregnated. “Come
“Potter,” And then he sighed, “I like whatever we’ve been doing for the past few months. I like that you share things with me, and I like that you listen to my night rambles. I enjoy this, but….”
, as they had called it. It was just better to flow with it, laugh with them, and answer their questions.
“I can tell.” Malfoy shook his head, “Honestly, Potter. Why couldn’t you just ask a professional to help you with this?”
A sharp feeling of hatred crawled through Harry. It was stupid, he knew. But he didn’t want him to be happy. He didn’t deserve it. Bad people didn’t deserve it.
It was something thoroughly sporadic, filled with rushed emotions and impulsive decisions. And with the shame of it filling the walls each morning at Grimmauld, making them silent as they clothed themselves slowly.
A surprised look formed over Malfoy’s expression when he met Harry’s glance. At this close distance, Harry was able to notice the rosy cheeks strong in his pale complexion. “Hello, Potter,” he said.
“I was being childish and annoying and—, and then he said something.” Draco swallowed, “Said that with an attitude like mine no one will ever love me, that I needed to change.”
“Potter, Weasley… please leave the papers in my office.” Camil announced to them, stepping out of the lift, “Then, you would be ready to leave for today.”
Harry was careful with his drink. Malfoy was too. The mocking became something else, and Harry wanted so bad to prove that he was better than
“So…” Harry started mid breakfast when he finally felt awake enough to speak. “Was it all okay? Your party, I mean….”
And he left. Leaving Malfoy behind before he could even think of starting any type of conversation. No. Harry didn’t want to have
Draco laughed, the sound of it filling the quiet Level, making some faces turn around. “Okay, but don’t stay
It was a product of having slipped a confession to Neville and Luna, a declaration he had kept lock for so long that the timeline felt foggy. Making him bewildered, off-balance.
Harry noticed Ginny and Blaise looking at them from somewhere in the party, a big grin on their faces. And through the dizziness, he remembered Ginny months ago telling him that Malfoy fancied blokes, and he was drunk, and he didn’t give a shit anymore, so he just asked;
But Draco wasn’t talking nor nodding, not even paying attention to their conversation because his eyes were entirely over Harry’s. To Harry on the bar, next to Marcus, with two almost empty Midnight Flowers between them.
“Harry!” Neville said, coming close to him, the smell of Firewhisky clearly impregnated on him. “I have someone! I bloke for you to date!”
“Hi, Rosie. Err…I don’t.” Harry said politely. Lately, he had grown used to strangers trying to make conversation with him. However, it still made him uncomfortable, no matter what. “He’s single if you were wondering.”
He used to ignore Harry. Not because he wasn’t interested in him, but because Harry resembled his worst fear; he was the living picture (according to the
Hermione was giving Blaise a look, something Harry couldn’t really decipher. He was too busy to think about it when a small memory on his mind was making an effort to reappear, to play like a movie. A months younger Harry, asking Draco out, and then being delicately rejected.
him. He needed to touch him, to hug him. But Draco felt cold and distant, and Harry needed to melt it all down first. “I didn’t know your mother knew about us.”
So, certainly, his quest could end in shitty dates and making other people feel bad; but the reality was that it wasn’t his intention. It never was. Harry
“Mione told me some things,” Ron continued, ignoring the peevishness building on Harry’s. “She said he’s a mess. Not…
“You are so lovely,” Harry whispered. He wrapped one hand over Draco’s cock, stroking it with the right pace. “So, so
Harry looked at her bemused; she was nibbling her lower lip, waiting. And Harry laughed. He laughed because everything seemed like a joke. Once again, the universe was joking with him.
Once he was fully inside Draco, with a hard moan, Harry tried to make himself comfortable to properly fuck him. It wasn’t the most comfortable position, but it wasn’t the first time they fucked against a wall.
“Tomorrow, I’m doing a list for you.” Harry tried lightening the mood and dropped a gentle kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Those who I reject can work for you.”
He wasn’t sure how many minutes passed when he felt hands pushing him up and leaving the cold tides from the kitchen floor. His knees were sore.
A part of him wanted to keep fighting with Draco because if they did it, if they continued, it would mean that at some point, they dropped it and go back to normal. Right?
Harry’s hands were firm on Draco’s shoulders as he pressed their bodies closer, looking at his lips, wanting Draco to give him the right sign for him to close the distance.
Hermione smiled, “Okay, of course, I did! But that was the thing…in the list, there was no logical way of seeing our relationship working. We are like opposites.”
“Nah, you were the Chosen One at the age of ten. You made better life choices when you were a kid than most of my ancestors. And you were only thirteen, fourteen or fifteen. This is not about age; this is about the way I saw things back then and my whole bloodline being rotten.”
Harry wasn’t really surprised when he awoke in the middle of the night from his nightmare. From revisiting, once again, the Astronomy Tower and the calming voice of Dumbledore saying,
Harry stood still; it was no time to process all of this. Maybe tomorrow morning, after drinking litres and litres of Hangover Potion.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged, one of his fingers rolled around the top of the empty glass. He needed more alcohol, or maybe water, or perhaps to Disapparate.
Draco was the polar opposite. His mind would ponder in between millions of options. He would overthink it so much it wouldn’t even make sense in the end. It was
He left a quick kiss on Draco’s lips and then took a step back to let him get down the counter kitchen. Harry bent to his knees and allowed Draco’s fingers to guide him. Draco touched his lips roughly, pushing his thumb into the inside of his mouth, making him
Harry gazed at their entangled hands, the way his palm covered Draco’s slender fingers, the softness his hands always held, feeling like they could break under Harry’s firm grip.
In the end, she made Harry and Ron decorate the garden with a carefully thought step by step guide so they couldn’t make any mistakes. On the other side of the garden, she and Draco worked with the food planning. They ended up calling for Ginny and Blaise because Hermione kept insisting that they would never make it on time, even though they still had three hours till the guest started to arrive.
“He is not my--not yet, anyway,” She blushed. Then took a breath in and then out. Attempting (and failing) to control herself. “I need this to be perfect,
“Yeah,” Harry tried a smile. He could do this. Of course he could do this. Just a drink to help him overcame the awkwardness on his body. “Neville Longbottom,”

shattered on him. It made him revisit the entirety of their relationship; how wonderful it had been when he was sixteen, how sorrowful it turned at seventeen and how empty it felt at eighteen. She was the one that kissed, the one that touched, the one that talked…he just moved along.
“What are you all talking about--?” Hermione started, but Harry glanced at Ron, placing his hand on her thigh, and she stopped mid-sentence.
to meet up with them, because everyone already knew and they were going to talk about it, him being there or not.
“Would you just drop it?” Harry said, but his voice wasn’t loud as it was before. And how on earth Draco knew Marcus last name?
“What?” Malfoy’s face changed, his smile fainted, and his posture stiffened. Harry didn’t like this Malfoy; he liked the quiet one who laughed at his jokes.
“Happy birthday, Zabini.” Harry smiled. As he got close to hug Blaise, he noticed a new pair of eyes looking at him. Draco was closing the door behind them with another cardboard box in his hands.
“…And you’re here, asking yourself if you’re good or bad. But I had never seen bad people ask themselves that. You are a good person, Draco.”
In the weeks that followed, Harry couldn’t keep himself far from Draco. He had asked him to stay at Grimmauld with him.
Harry began, “Draco. You can still be a good person and make mistakes. You can still be a good person and get in a fight with your loved ones; you can be good and still let some people down by a mistake. Being good is not about making everything right. It’s not about nodding and agreeing and never letting someone dislike you because you don’t give them a reason to.”
Hermione announced that she had received a letter from Narcissa Malfoy on Monday. “It’s like we called them!” Ron was saying at their side. “We literally invocated the fucking Malfoys!”
And there he was, greeted by Narcissa Malfoy on a bright Sunday afternoon to the Manor. She was waiting for Harry in a flourishing garden; tinted with magical plants in every corner, shining with the calming weather. It was too beautiful, and it seemed that Mrs Malfoy knew the charming effect it had on people because she carried a soft proud look in her eyes.
But behind Hermione’s concerned looks and worried lip, there was a non-spoken conversation that Harry knew too well by now. She was right. Of course, she was;
And then…Draco’s face when Harry touched him, kissed him, thrust him slowly. The way he surrendered to love, only during his arousal, because after that,
As expected, he pushed his feelings away instead of confronting them. He told himself it was because he never dated someone before.
“He wasn’t that bad,” Luna said as she entered the living room and joined them. She would always hang alone in Harry’s cold garden for a while, sometimes minutes, other times hours.
. The capital of Argentina.” Draco smirked mischievously as if he knew precisely the effect the words had on Harry milliseconds ago. “The city has one of the best Potion Research teams in the world. I thought about running away there plenty of times.”
Ginny and Blaise broke off; rosy cheeks, clothes shaggy, showing more skin than Harry would have wanted. If it wouldn’t be for his angriness, he might have even found it hot. Ginny was beautiful, and he couldn’t lie, and Blaise…well, Blaise was something else. The air truly smelled like sex.
Ron would usually say that every single day at Aurors Training, but Harry knew there wasn’t a tint of truth on those words. Ron was never tired enough to not enjoy it, he usually left the weekends hoping to return. And it was definitely the opposite for Harry, who long dreamt of being in this position, but now it felt like a nightmare suffocating him...
Harry glanced back, trying to catch Draco again. But he found instead only Hermione talking in the circle. Harry tried looking around for him. Was he mad at him? Was it not okay for him to flirt (if you could call that flirting) with someone?
Today Draco was definitely sensitive (and maybe irritated) because the immediate image of Harry inside the unknown
He had still time to tell them he had a plane to Nigeria in an hour. That Voldemort had returned, and he needed to save the world for a second time.
Draco only nodded and hid his face under the tea mug. It was a bit too early to have that conversation, and Draco didn’t seem willing to continue it. Maybe Harry needed to bring it back on a night where their minds were lighter, and the air between them was tranquil.
Hermione’s words were rushing desperately. Harry felt ashamed; they were supposed to help her. Draco was also blushing, trying to mumble an explanation out.
“I get that you think the whole wizarding world hates you and all that rubbish.” Harry started; his palm was steady over Draco’s heart. He tried to keep his mocking tone on his voice so Draco wouldn’t feel like Harry was pushing too much.
Draco laughed low onto Harry’s hair. And Harry could felt himself losing it. He wanted to rut harder, to roll his body toughly to the counter, to make Draco moan the way he usually did. But, no. He needed to slow down. He needed to follow the pace Draco usually put. Slowly at first, and then all a sudden harder.
was a priority, not the person itself.” Draco said, “Remember Josie? You pushed your date with her to fuck me.”
“Don’t feel pity for me. I survived worse.” Draco threatened before she could continue. He didn’t feel like having a speech about
And both of them did. Both fell asleep on the couch, almost fully clothed, and Harry’s glasses and Draco’s wand lost in between.
wants to be for too long. And as he reached the lifts, Harry noticed an old man with a heavy gaze on him, eyes looking at him cautiously.
He and Draco were complete opposites. Two completely different individuals with different stories and different backgrounds. Wasn’t it always that? The good and the bad, the hero and the rival. Light and darkness. Warm and cold, courage and fear. Every single detail about them was a pole of opposites, one standing in the other end.
But right there, while surrounded by couples (okay, maybe only one and a half) and after his last night realizations, it felt like the most brilliant idea to announce.
“I forgot you had no taste.” Draco scoffed but still shared him a sleepy smile. “Anyway, I’ll only move out from The Manor if it’s to a house in
“Look,” Draco started, “You can do whatever you want with your cock. You could blow a guy in front of me and I wouldn’t
Harry’s hands felt sweaty, uncomfortably moving on each side of his body. He definitely needed a drink. Harry gazed at…was his name Marcus?
Except that he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He couldn’t stop thinking about what would have happened if Draco decided to stay and Harry got close to him and begged for something. Because, of course, Harry would have asked for something; for a better conversation, for a simple touch of hands while sleeping, for a quick shag somewhere, or for something
“Pardon me?” Draco wasn’t meeting his eyes; he kept his gaze at the wind brushing the flowers in front of them.
He was always caught by life, by other people. Always suffering the consequences of other people’s actions. And he just…moved along.
Harry was standing in his kitchen, listening to his friend's banter as he managed to mix the brew of alcohol on the kitchen counter. Luna brewed it this time; she was probably the best at making it, even though it took everyone a while to trust her with the task. Harry stirred it gently, letting the strong scent of the Hibiscus Flower cover him.
They could use a spell for this. There were at least dozens of incantations related to hair fixing and styling.
It wasn’t like it had been at Hermione’s birthday, in which he had stood alone till he joined a conversation with people from the Ministry. This time, it was Ron’s house, filled with Ron’s life. Which also meant it was also Harry’s; same friends, same childhood, same family. Even the place was fucking decorated by the both of them.
With just the thin fabric of their pants in between, Harry didn’t waste more time and pinned Draco over the mattress. He captured his mouth and began kissing him deeply. It made Draco dizzy. The way Harry kissed was all-consuming; he kissed like it was all he needed to do and the rest of the world didn’t matter enough. He deposited all his energy there; the energy of the day, of the week, of the
Draco didn’t hold the moan that came out of his lips. He got up on his elbows and watched. He watched the silver ring, moving in and out, wet with sticky lube dripping over it. He pleaded Harry for another one.
Harry felt his body twitched as his arousal grew bigger, making him leave small and low moans over Draco’s ear. He dropped both of his hands over Draco’s hips, pressing and squeezing his fingers over the fabric of the button-down shirt. He then attempted to lift him up, just a little for Draco to understand what he wanted.
Harry pulled the damp locks of his fringe away (Draco could easily spot his lighting scar) and then moved one palm to stroke Draco’s prick. He couldn’t help himself from bucking his hips up in response.
Harry laughed drowsily. It was the first time, without alcohol inside his system, he did it in front of him. He immediately noticed the evident surprise on Draco’s face in response.
And he knew the man that was standing next to him hadn’t learned that lesson yet. And Harry was more than willing to show it to him.
was only needed because Mr Borgin didn’t trust Malfoy enough. Of course. Mrs Malfoy probably thought it was a perfect idea for his son to be associated with someone who had been undeniably on the good side of the war.
Harry was definitely sulky. He hated being possessive of his friends, but he couldn’t stop himself. He couldn’t help but gaze at Malfoy constantly; what he was doing, where he was standing, who he was talking to, or what he looked like when he spoke…
But then, something shifted. After one morning, when Draco dryly asked him, “Do you like this? What we do, I mean.”
Harry thought of Hogwarts; he wanted to translate that feeling to the new house. He thought of the Burrow. He even thought of his room at the Dursley’s (not the whole house, just his room), which for him felt like the only safe thing during his childhood and teenage years.
“You’re taking the piss!” Ron howled while the tipsy round of clapping began. “Please tell me you are joking!”
than seeing Draco after he came, naked and vulnerable, red face and those eyes…those eyes shining from the glow post his orgasm. Harry wondered if Draco saw the same on him.
“You don’t have to play if it’s going to make you all jealous,” Ginny teased him, “But let me tell you, Hermione played it last time…”
Harry had tried to flirt or something. And did Marcus too. But the conversation would shift once again to something too serious and boring for a Friday night.
As simple as that. With a game on a drunken night, a letter received on a Monday, a best friend working with everyone’s arch-enemy from childhood, and a new friendship built. A strange and out of nowhere friendship between Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy.
“-I’d take care of their planets. And see if their Venus is not in a bad aspect with yours, Harry.” Luna had said. Harry did not want to know
“That’s so pretty,” Marcus said softly, enchanted by the magic working in front of them. “Hermione is such an amazing witch.”
“Warm and safe,” He concluded days later, in bed, next to Draco, who frowned in response, trying to understand where those last words came from. “The house.” Harry explained, “It needs to be warm and safe. Okay? My only request.”
“That was it!” Ron shouted in realization from behind, “Mate, I was eating my brains trying to think what was different in you.”
Harry realised he had no idea what he was drinking; the liquid was a rich dark purple with something in it that made it shimmer. Was he really that drunk that he had accepted a drink from Malfoy without checking the ingredients first?
“Buenos Aires, I know.” His attempt with the Spanish accent was the least arousing thing in the world, not at all as Draco’s had been.
There was something in Malfoy’s words that immediately hit Harry. Something familiar, something that knocked him way too hard in his core. It was the memory of Ginny wanting him to give more than what he could. The memory of Hermione telling him he needed to be a better boyfriend. The memory of his dreadful dates with strangers. The memory of his short and brief story with Cho Chang when he was a teenager.
Harry didn’t want to know why he thought people wouldn’t choose him. No, he wanted to know why Draco hadn’t tried it.
” Draco said wryly. “If you actually liked her, you’d have gotten a haircut. Honestly, Harry, it’s getting out of hand.”
He had cut the food into small pieces, trying to trick his brain into taking the small bits. But ever since he got out of the Ministry and floo to Grimmauld, he had felt full. He knew full wasn’t the right word, but it was the easiest way to put it.
before pushing Harry back into a kiss. And decided to never bring it up to him again. He had mentioned it to Hermione and Ron once or twice but left the topic to disappear from his brief interactions with Malfoy.
Draco opened his mouth to talk, but Harry felt as he couldn’t resist any more. As if the confessions were desperately trying to come out of him. “I’m not meant for dating either.”
There was something in the words of Luna that remind Harry of Dumbledore, of the way the old man talk about love. Wasn’t love what had made Harry survive anyway? So, why did he knew so little about it?
Mrs Malfoy poured tea onto both of their empty teacups and closed her eyes at the first sip. Harry imitated her, trying to be careful with the china, as he pressed his lips for the first taste of it, scenting the perfume of the flower tea. The Neroli burned his tongue. It tasted…
Draco was so mesmerized by the vision of Harry’s hands that he missed when he pulled his wand out and tapped the ring twice.
Harry had come at some point in the middle of the night, after his late date, he had whispered to Draco’s ear “
Can’t believe we are reaching the end of this story! I hope you enjoy the last chapter before the Epilogue (which will be pretty short; less than 1k words)! See you there for more of a sloppy goodbye to the readers.
Harry opened his mouth to talk but then close it. Draco was blushing slightly, looking down at his fingers.
Harry opened his mouth. He wanted to keep the conversation, the inevitable shouting. But, yeah, he was tired too—body sore, muscles weary for the uncomfortable position.
Opposites, but at the end of the day, just the same. Complementing each other so perfectly from the tip of their fingers to their core.
He wanted to shut it as much as possible, especially when Draco was close to him and he was suddenly
And Harry didn’t know what to say. His plan was to show Malfoy that he was looking at him. That he was paying attention, judging him, and that he should stop laughing because he didn’t deserve it.
Another nightmare, he was used to that, but it had been years since he last got one in which Malfoy was in it.
“Really, Ron?” Harry turned around, grinning, “Three months without a haircut, and you couldn’t guess
“I remembered. I mean you probably never really noticed me, but…well, everyone knew who you were and…yeah,”
Harry didn’t want to go back to the party either, and he could only think about his soft mattress waiting for him at Grimmauld Place.
Harry decided it was better if he let her speak without any interruption. So, he relaxed his muscles, tried to sit better on his chair. He sipped the tea, trying to pause the unease the situation gave him.
Harry could still feel the heavy twinge down his stomach. A small part of him kept murmuring that the only way to make it disappear was to make sure Draco was okay.  It was part of their relatively new dynamic. Lately, their snogging had become more
it made Draco shiver at the touch. He worked his hands dry against Harry’s erection, feeling his hardness grow big under his palm.
And Harry did. He kissed him slowly. Placing both of his hands around Draco’s cold cheeks, holding him close, trying to make sure Draco stood there for him and melted to Harry’s embrace.
oblivious. Luna had told him plenty of times that she sees Draco as his boyfriend. He avoided giving it much thought. Why torture himself like that? Longing for someone who he couldn’t have, at least not in the way he truly wanted. Hasn’t Draco been telling his stupid quest was pointless just this morning? Hasn’t he joked about how hopeless Harry was about his love life?
And now that neither Harry nor Draco were mesmerized by the sight, Draco let himself rest his neck onto the pillow. Closing his eyes, he felt the burning sensation of being slowly filled by Harry. The warm temperature of his cock
Harry owled Marcus Turner. They had dinner at The Sunlit on Hogsmeade, a lovely and romantic place quite the opposite from how their actual date ended up being. Harry and Marcus both had excellent discussions about the Educational Department and the magical educational system in general. It was a nice chat to have, but if anyone from outside would have seen their dates, they would probably think that Harry and Marcus were simply two co-workers that still didn’t care about each other enough.
. That Draco wasn’t doing him any favour with it. That they were good together, and it didn’t matter if they both suck at being intimate, because when it was just the two of them, things simply
. Is this your way of trying to make them think you are actually good? You know, by agreeing to everything people say.”
“The usual.” Luna’s soft voice moved closer to Harry’s side. “But Harry always gets like this. I like this Harry.”
move quickly enough. He ordered a drink, and instead of leaving, he stayed. He didn’t open his mouth neither showed signs of wanting to start a conversation. Just stayed there, at his side, as Harry sipped his new drink.
It was hands leading him around places; the voices of those who survived indicating him what to do next. It was healing sessions he was bound to take for wounds the war left and will never be healed. It was potions and remedies offered so he would finally
Harry had always been known, since the beginning of his childhood, as a temperamental kid. As someone who always had a hard time controlling his emotions. Someone who did the first thing that crossed his mind because he felt in his guts.
Neville’s words weren’t harsh. On the contrary, his voice was low, comforting. Yet, they still created uneasiness on his inside.
It could have been that, or maybe the endless nights in which they had told each other secrets because they were too vulnerable and they didn’t feel like lying.
“Mate, it was completely unnecessary to tell me about the bathroom shag!” Ron continued, face covered in red. “I go there every single day!”
“The night the news came, after the war, that you helped Draco to be free of charges…I well remember he didn’t eat his dinner that night. He sat at the dinner table looking down at his plate with a frown on his face that didn’t fade till he was asleep.”
But the reality was that they both needed that time. They both needed to learn about their relationship, about love, about vulnerability, about good and bad. All in order to live like this,
Like the time he let Hermione pick his outfit for that Daily Prophet interview when he was twenty-one. Or maybe the time he had decided to leave Cho Chang alone at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. Or perhaps every decision he made at fifteen when he was overflowed by anger and felt misunderstood.
Harry wanted to move, to touch him, to hold him close, to kiss his tears and to kiss each and every one of his words. But right now, he needed to listen.
He threw up that night. By the aching feeling of falling in love, and by the pain of having to clench his feelings away for his own sake.
Everyone in the room began supporting Luna, telling her that she should definitely dye her hair. Harry couldn’t agree more. But for some stupid reason, he couldn’t stop ignoring Draco’s presence next to him. It hadn’t been too long since Hermione’s birthday, but it felt like the time passed slowly. He had gotten so used to Draco’s company that every week that passed had meant something.
Both of their moans mixed together perfectly, one finishing and a new one following, and Harry was grateful that Grimmauld was a spacious and
“You are being a prick.” Harry crossed his arms. His voice was rising, “What do you want? For me to get
“I thought the same, the first time I tried it.” She said; a fond smile formed in her delicate appearance. “I get my tea from a very famous witch from China. But the thing is…there’s no magic in it. Just
to the floating candles around them. “I’m sure all of that will happen. Draco Malfoy is waiting excitedly to be my best mate.”
This time he had a year with Draco onto his back, and he had learnt to give without being completely lost.
He had meant to give it back to him after his first date with Josie, but he had found a guilty pleasure in the way he looked wearing jewellery. He never had in the past, not a single necklace. He was expecting Draco to nag him to give it back as soon as that first date ended, but he hadn’t brought it up. So, in the meantime, he allowed himself to enjoy the feeling of keeping a ring on his index.
Harry was too used to this type of morning conversations. Draco liked to wake up early. Harry hated it. But somehow, little by little, morning by morning, he had learnt to like it.
And Draco felt his body clenching as the orgasm grew inside his body. As the shivers and the burning sensation covered him all over.
With his free hand, Harry cupped Draco’s arse harshly. Lifting it and letting the tip of a wet finger brushed his entrance, sending him shivers through his entire body, from his head to the fingernails of his toes. It was too much whenever Harry did that. Whenever he stroked his cock hastily with one hand and with the other caressed his buttocks.
“He told me,” Harry confessed, feeling the heat of his cheeks slowly arising. “Plenty of times. I asked him out. He doesn’t do dating.”
“Exactly this, actually.” He said. Perhaps he judged Hermione too much because, at the end of the day, she hadn’t said anything to him all night. “Thank you for not laughing that much.”
Flowers were floating, mixing themselves with an alcohol bottle Harry never saw before. Lime and sugar hybridising with different flowers. A shimmer of glitter running to get into the glass. Harry tried to catch up with the steps, the ingredients. He thought about Draco. Perhaps he could try preparing it at Grimmauld for him or
“I shall confess you something.” She lowered the teacup to its plate, gazing not at Harry but the garden in front of them, “I knew this was going to happen. Soon. I always knew it was going to be
“Oh, Mr Potter.” She said, finally lifting her head from the desk for the first time since Harry came out of the lift. “She is in Mr Borgin’s office, right…
Malfoy gave him a funny look, and before Harry thought too much about it, he asked the bartender for another Midnight Flowers for Malfoy.
“Fuck,” Draco whimpered, and Harry continued in a faster rhythm, pressing his lips hard as he sucked in and out, making everything messier and wetter.
. Yes, life will forever be something that happened around him, but he was trying to catch up on it.
It wasn’t as if he never had other crushes. He remembered some guys from Slytherin who flirted with him during Hogwarts, or perhaps the sons of his mother’s friends during tea parties at The Manor. He occasionally had sex with other blokes just because it made him feel wanted, liked and whatever. So he didn’t really
“I told you I knew that.” But Malfoy’s posture became less stiffened than before, and with a whispered voice, added, “I shouldn’t keep drinking.”
“What a prick,” Harry muttered. He shifted his body to his side to meet Draco, whose back rested against the bed headboard. “Yea, well…I’m making lists.”
And Draco was tired of their fucking miscommunication, so he pushed himself forward, grabbed Harry’s shoulders and tried to shove him down to change their position. Harry allowed himself to be pressed onto his back.
“Saw you talking to Mr Malfoy.” The man lowered his voice, getting close to him. Harry stiffened. “If he ever bothers you, don’t doubt telling us. It wouldn’t be an issue.”
Therefore, he ordered three Midnight Flowers instead of one. It was the only drink that could get him drunk fast enough, and he was sure Luna and Neville would appreciate it.
“It’s really nice to meet you,” Marcus headed one hand to him politely. Harry shook it, telling himself that he needed to learn a wandless spell next time to get rid of moisty with sweat hands.
“Well, because I changed everything,” Harry shrugged, shifting uncomfortably over his feet. “On my first year. It was too cold, too wicked–-Ginny helped me.”
“I love you, Harry.” Draco busted out, shutting every single thought that rushed through Harry. Making him feel a pleasant warm flowing inside him, feeling his own magic beat energetically. “I love you so much, Harry.”
the story has a word count of +40k! it is already finished and I'm planning to post everything this week! :)
“I want to blow you.” A voice that didn’t seem Harry’s came out of his mouth; desperate to break or to finish the strange sensations that were running inside his body.
to see him doing that. He was looking so beautiful under him, naked on his back, all flushed, with his curls brushing the pillow and the sweat making them stick to his forehead.
“You have finally lost it,” Draco said in disbelief, meeting Harry’s eyes for any sign of mockery. There wasn’t any. “Harry James Potter finally
Harry felt a rush of cold going through him. He and Blaise kept a pretty basic relationship; he had learned to like him because Blaise was kind and absolutely perfect for Ginny. But their conversations always consisted of Quidditch matches and sometimes the weather. They rarely mention Draco; he was positive he had covered the details of their relationship with Blaise
Hope life finds you well!! ♥ Thank you for reaching the end. You have no idea how much it means for me that you did.♥
He began by carding his fingers through it slowly. Everyone who looked at Harry might think that the nest he had in his hair was impossible to detangle. But for some strange reason, it never did around Draco’s fingers. The first night he got to touch it, he could it believe it, how those chaotic curls could be so
It hit him how during his years at Hogwarts, he mainly felt angry at everyone who didn’t understand him because, in reality, he couldn’t deal with feeling
So Harry talked, and Malfoy was laughing the way Harry never in his life had seen him laugh. “Did you know Luna brews the best alcohol on the entire planet?” He said, and Malfoy was just…
That last bit was the messiest, but somehow the one that he managed the most. The only part he knew how to work, and if he didn’t, it was still okay because Draco didn’t care about him that much anyway.
“I don’t want to be bad, Harry.” Draco let Harry hugged him, he surrendered to him, allowing vulnerability to come his way, “I don’t want to be bad, I don’t want to—”
It had rained a bit while they were at the restaurant. Harry wished the rain would start pouring again. He could picture himself sleeping with the sound of the water dripping over his window.
He left one of the hands that grabbed Draco’s hip and hold his own cock. Letting the tip lingered around his hole, ready to push it all the way in…waiting only for--
It wasn’t the first time they held this conversation. Harry remembered the night in his kitchen, Draco’s reaction to everything that Harry said. Not believing, both of them letting the conversation die with sex because they couldn’t get to that vulnerable place yet. But right now,
“Can I ask you something?” Harry sputtered, putting the fork down with a cliquing noise of metal against the plate.
Draco never made their breakfast. It was usually Harry who always groaned in the mornings, who yelled at him for waking up early, yet stopped Draco from getting out of bed. He always repeated:
. Oh, it had destroyed everything in me to see him suffering the consequences of his family decisions.”
“If you could only allow me….” Harry held his breath, “If you allowed me to love you, I think we can make things work.”
“I’ve seen this before,” Hermione let out, lower lip caught in between his teeth. “I’ve seen this ridiculous quest before, and Harry…you’re a complete mess at it.”
“He was there; he just had to go earlier--That’s not the point! I don’t want to shag someone new. I want to
“I always enjoyed calling Hermione by her last name,” Draco answered dryly, “And she doesn’t seem hurt.”
not saying a word. Just nodding, laughing and asking short questions to keep the conversation going.
“Stop,” Harry looked around, making sure neither Hermione nor Ron were listening. “I am okay like this, for your information.”
“Yes!” She said, answering his unspoken question that undoubtedly showed on his face. “Goodness, it was like he had a new skin tone and it was just pink!”
Harry rushed into their first sip. And in his defence, he tried with Marcus. He tried to listen to his words, tried to keep a conversation. But his mind was all over Draco, annoyed and irritated. And when he found Draco again, Harry looked back at Marcus. He didn’t deserve this mess, not right now. He seemed kind and nice, and maybe Harry could actually like him, so he said;
Malfoy fell silent. There wasn’t an evident shift in his posture or a notorious change of expression. He just stood still, reconsidering Harry’s words without showing any sign of emotion.
“Good, he’s suffering,” Harry said, the first real smile of the night formed on his lips. “Good, good, excellent.”
“You are, love.” She affirmed with a wide grin on her face. “She plays Quidditch, by the way. So you already have a topic for your date!”
Harry kissed him clumsily, hands sinking down to their junction, touching the outline of Draco’s hardness through his trousers. Draco answered, bucking his hips up, seeking for the touch.
Seeking for small relief, Harry rolled his hips against Draco, allowing their crotches to touch, to feel each other through the fabric of their trousers. Harry repeated his movement, rolling and pressing and receiving the reward of Draco’s gasps onto his mouth. It was a heady sensation. He repeated, and repeated, and--
And after a year of sharing his nights with Draco, Harry was surprised to find out how love and vulnerability changed everything for them. How their morning’s conversations were technically the same, but there was a new atmosphere surrendering them.
Harry lowered his voice and said, “I wouldn’t be able to work with all these people being so unfairly evil for no reason.”
“The two other options were Snape and Flinch, by the way,” Harry clarified to Ron, who had a raised eyebrow while everyone busted laughing around him.
And Harry thought the teasing was definitely worth every second of it because there was nothing more attractive than Draco’s gasps on his ears.
“Piss off, Ron! He’s doing it! He did step one, now he’s going to move into a friendship with you and–-”
Harry shrugged. He had no clue why he was pushing Draco to talk about this again. “Just tell me again.”
“Don’t remind me,” Draco said in response, lightening with his wand the laps floating around the flowers. “Mr Borgin told Hermione he needs to keep testing it. Which, of course, is a waste of time.”
His silver and black ring with the letter ‘M’ engraved in the middle. The one he wore on his index ever since he turned seventeen, as a gift from his father. It was a tradition for Malfoys to start wearing the family rings when they came of age. It was a tradition from hundreds and hundreds of years for each and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight Pureblood families to keep and follow.
What was he supposed to do with all the feelings that rumble across his body? Was he supposed to stay there, longing for something he couldn’t get? Feeling like he couldn’t function the nights he thought about Draco too much?
“Plenty of time.” He told Draco as the letter flew from Grimmauld Place. “Shall we take the ‘just fine’ clothes now?”
The following day, both Ron and Hermione woke him up with breakfast. Harry’s stomach was shut from the hangover, but he spotted the glorious Hangover Potion he was very familiar with and fond of at the table.
He didn’t touch his coffee. With a Galleon over the wooden table, he left the place before getting sicker in front of the few early risers at the café.
“Thank Merlin, you’re here!” A new voice joined the conversation, the old Mrs Fawcett. “I need one of you to stay till late today; I’ll go mad if I have to do all this by myself!”
He had only taken it off once. After the war was over when there was nothing but hate towards his past and his ancestry. When he had wished on his bed to be a completely different person, from a completely different family.
he could be more present, that he could ask deep questions and listen carefully to the answers, that he could give closeness to someone and that he could definitely give love and maybe received it. But, when it came to his dating record…it was like he
But Harry accepted his hand anyway, “Breneon Abbort,” The man introduced himself, “I work here in the Department next to Mr Borgin.”
Some deep part of Harry wanted her to finish. Something inside him yearned for her to tell him this was all nonsense and that he needed to drop it immediately. He pushed it away;
“All of you are here!” Ginny snorted, a pink blush spreading on her cheeks. “But okay…I would fuck Harry –As I’m already familiar with that, you see…”
Malfoy blushed rapidly, and after a pause said; “I think this is a bad idea. I don’t know what I’m doing here.”
But the most important thing, the one that Harry cared for the most; she told him that Blaise was a good person. He had his flaws, still meeting ghosts of his past like all of them had, but nonetheless a good person. Harry felt his muscles relaxed.
. And I know you don’t love this quest. And I know you love what you have with Draco. And it’s okay if love is terrifying, sometimes it is like that. It doesn’t mean that’s wrong, it’s just a feeling humans fall into because it’s hard to allow vulnerability. But it’ll be fine.”
Moving in was nothing compared to the quest of finding the place; Draco was highly picky, wavering pros and cons, looking at all the details, trying to not miss on anything.
His statement gave place for everyone to start discussing the differences (if they were any) between Crabbe and Goyle. And then, after some minutes passed, Neville asked what everyone wanted to ask in the first place;
laugh. Ron was the absolutely perfect match for Hermione, yet, they had always been opposites since their childhood, and Harry had been present during the entire journey.
“Apologising,” Malfoy said and locked his eyes with Harry’s. Grey eyes, almost too dark. A steady look, without hesitation in it. “I’m just doing that.”
“No,” Harry continued, “I don’t know if I actually like her or not. But Hermione keeps telling me I need to give it more time and I-–”
There was a poem hanging in the wooden garden gate. Harry spotted one of its quotes, remembering the familiarity of it.
The irritation and anger he felt were gone. As if he hadn’t spent the past couple of weeks yelling internally and complaining at Draco’s letter.
When he opened the door to return to the garden, he saw Malfoy resting on the wall in front of him, coat on his hands, ready to leave as he was supposed to. Their eyes met for the first time in a distance that wasn’t too far.
“Potter,” Draco smirked in response. And the fucker was looking absolutely handsome; a white shirt rolled up to his elbows, grey trousers fucking
He only did it because he wanted to hear Draco talk; he wanted Draco to tell him again and again how much he wanted him and how terrified he was to admit it.
“What time is it?” Harry felt the low sound of a sleepy voice close to his ears. “I think I need to go.”
“Can we play?” Hermione interrupted and placed a hand over Ron’s. “Ron should start because he didn’t come last Saturday.”
…At least Harry didn’t cancel his date. Instead, he wrote to Josie that a minor ‘inconvenience’ came up and that he will show up an hour late.
Blaise had joined them at some point; he had come through floo powder as soon as Ginny asked for reinforces when they all started to run out of names and people,
Every single one of those emotions Harry shoved onto their kiss. Draco’s lips were cold but quickly heating up under his. The pace was frantic, possessive and perhaps too hard. Malfoy didn’t seem to care; he was trying to follow Harry’s moves, trying to sync with him.
However, Harry had always been an expert at observing Malfoy since he was eleven. It came easy to him to notice that there was something different in his appearance.
to celebrate his twenty-five birthday as a proper festivity; with co-workers from the Ministry invited, casual friends from Auror Training, friends from friends, and some strangers somewhere in the middle.
And when he did, when he finally opened his mouth to suck him properly, he was rewarded with Draco’s fingers sinking hurriedly into Harry’s hair; tugging his curls hard. Helpless, he let out a
But then again, it was a vague teenage memory. He just turned twenty-four, and all his dating experience was…well, there wasn’t much.
Later that week, he had stupidly felt better on Harry’s bed. After having begged Harry to touch him everywhere because he needed his skin to be impregnated on him and take away any old memory of his body.
So he allowed himself to open (only for some time) a place to think about his relationship with Draco. It wasn’t the first time, neither would be his last. But somehow, this time, it was
sure about that. It had been a year since the both of them had fallen into a strange dynamic. How did it all happen? What was it that leaded Draco to be in his kitchen counting the food for Harry’s birthday after shagging him senseless on the couch?
Tonight it was Grimmauld Place. Every Saturday, because no one had work to do the next day, they picked a place to crash on. Grimmauld Place some nights, The Leaky Cauldron others, and maybe (if Hermione was persuaded) Ron and Hermione’s cottage.
idiot at the end, and he was starting to gain a bad mood. “And it gets you pretty drunk pretty fast.”
Ron flinched at his words. “He’s paying for every single one of his actions, you know that, right?” His voice had shifted. It was almost a whisper, although the garden was completely empty.
not so loud Neville!” Harry laughed, trying to cover Neville’s mouth with his palm. “I don’t want to look like a complete loser.”
He blushed with embarrassment harshly. What would be Malfoy’s reaction be if they said these things to him instead of Harry? Would he hex them right away without making a threat first? Should Harry do that instead?
“Mr Boris felt sick, so Draco and I’ve been freaking all day in his office doing absolutely everything.” Hermione began. Harry was glad that no matter how cold and distant the floor was, Hermione was still Hermione, unaffected by her two years working in it. “Honestly, I didn’t even know that old man did that much!”
“Antonniette said hi,” Harry answered, still looking at his friends talking in front of them, not turning his body to meet Draco’s.
“In all honesty!” Ginny started. Raising her drink, calling everyone’s attention, even those from strangers at the bar. “Tell us, please…was it good?”
And Draco tears began to fall. He shut his eyes, failing to stop them. Making his face red and puffy, tears dropping slowly one behind the other.
Harry kissed him like that, without doing anything else, for long minutes. Keeping both of their bodies press together but not letting his hands move further. Draco knew he kept it for longer than needed because it was Draco’s favourite part, and he loved to please.
It was small compared to Grimmauld, and of course, miniature compared to the Malfoy Manor. But it spacious enough for two people.
With a whimper, Harry slowly removed his fingers. And with the same hand, gave himself a couple stokes before lining up to Draco’s arsehole.
. He left, leaving Harry and Malfoy alone, with empty drinks and a slow-building tension between them.
“As if I’m eager to go home.” Draco huffed. “I just finished with the labelling of the Fire Protection Potion for Level 4. What should I do now?”
He had been so concentrated in the trusts on his mouth, in the taste of Draco’s prick filled with precome, in the heavy and hot feeling of having his mouth full with him. So concentrated in all that, that he almost forgot the painful erection on his pants, unattended,
They talked. Talk about school differences, magical education, the Ministry… It was very nice, nothing remotely sexy or flirty about it. He wasn’t even sure if Neville lied about Marcus being gay because they were
Rosie Warrington happened to fit Harry suspiciously perfect. From Ginny's point of view: she was pretty, not intimidating at all, she enjoyed talking a lot (which was good for whenever Harry got nervous), and they shared a similar taste. Also, as Luna pointed out, their natal charts match nicely.
Draco’s hands tighten into Harry’s lower back, making their bodies press harder. Giving him the right sign for him to
“I will let you two alone to talk.” She said gently as she moved gracefully over the door, kissing Draco’s cheek softly.
And his wishing and craving for dating, that had come when Ginny and Blaise started to date, slowly vanished from Harry’s desire. He had tried at first. Went to a couple of dates that failed miserably, and then he was back to
It took him days, weeks, months, and years. It was slow, really slow, but then...he was a better friend, a better neighbour, a better lover, and a better person in general.
It was so intoxicating that Draco felt hopeless, not being able to do more than tangling his fingers into Harry’s hair and tried to follow his pace.
“It is fantastic. Here, let me,” Harry tapped the wood bar with his wand, thinking about his request. Seconds later, the glasses were floating, enchanting the ingredients Hermione previously bought and store in the bar.
They unpacked in silence, both of them enjoying the soft noises from each item getting out of their boxes. Draco worked on their kitchen, Harry with the living room. An opening on the wall connected both rooms. It allowed Harry to look up and still spot the pale blond hair moving around, hands opening and closing cupboards.
. But fucking Zabini was serving him drink after drink, and his body began to relax as warmness floated through him.
There were degrees of emotions inside people; primary and secondary emotions. The primary emotions were the ones that we genuinely feel, that we sense in our core. And once we exteriorise them, we feel calmer. As if we are free of them. Then, we have the secondaries. The emotions that we
Harry wasn’t going to lie to himself. No, because it was too obvious for him to do so. He got the haircut because he was in desperate need to get Draco’s attention. To see his startled eyes all over him when he walked into Ginny’s place with his new non-messy haircut.
Harry tried to bit down his laugh. If someone ever told him at the age of fifteen that one day he would sit next to Narcissa Malfoy talking about something as mundane as tea, he would have lost it.
“I don’t know.” He shrugged, looking down at his own empty glass. “A way of showing you that I don’t despise you?”
Their kisses floated and danced from one place to the other. In their lips, their necks, their collarbone. Navel, then thighs. It was hot everywhere, and the slow of their movements help them through their arousal, stopping as soon as they felt too desperate because they didn’t want it to end just yet.
Before Harry found a way to formulate his feelings, Blaise was around him, with a hold over his shoulders; “Harry! We were talking about Quidditch! You used to be really good at that. What happened?”
“It was a game in which the other two other options were Crabbe and Goyle.” He repeated almost every evening.
So he was destined to like Granger since the moment they held a conversation. She would express her opinion without sugar-coating it, without stopping herself. She wasn’t mean about it. She wasn’t saying it to hurt you or to make you look stupid; she would simply say it because she wanted what was better for his friends. And Draco, somehow, had fallen into that category the past few years.
Harry looked down at Marcus’s hands, pale hands, not thin as Draco’s, not as beautiful. A silver ring, more delicate than his, with a gentle T engraved in it.
In her mischievous plan, she was going to invite her co-workers, make them invite other people from The Ministry, get them drunk and find a new job offer somewhere in the middle. She was ready to reposition to a new Department and leave old Brutus Borgin behind.
“Oh, no, no--” Harry answered with a grin, “I think she tried. If I think about it. But, you’re forgetting how oblivious I can be, you know.”
Harry was standing barefoot over the living sofa. A big grin on his face as he held on his right hand his usual plastic tumbler filled with Witches Brew. He didn’t need a mirror to know his face was a bit sweaty, with his curls sticking in his forehead and a red flush all over from the earlier karaoke.
Harry really wanted those fingers everywhere around him. The metal of his rings over his skin, the icy feeling of the first touch.
After that, it only took them a shot of firewhisky on their system and the summoning of a white chart (which Harry had
Draco was worrying his lips, uncharacteristically. Harry wondered if he realized he was doing it. “But I also understand that part of growing up is realizing I could have handled better, I could’ve changed things, I could’ve lived differently. I’m okay with that.”
“Which one has the food poisoning for Mr Abbort?” Harry whispered to Draco’s ear when they both stood close, drinks on their hands, guests starting to arrive.
Draco touched Harry’s ring, rolled it slowly. Kissing it as if that ring had always been there, on Harry’s hand since the beginning. Harry pushed his index into Draco’s mouth, making him suck it. Licking it, making movements with his tongue around his skin and the silver.
But everything felt like a blur on his mind. The sequences flowed as pictures; getting on his knee, not even talking Malfoy’s pants all the way down (just enough for him to suck him properly), taking him onto his mouth, feeling the hotness flood him, feeling the weight and hardness of it around his tongue, his lips. Hearing Malfoy’s heavy and hitch breath, and noticing both of his hands clenched around the edges of the couch, his knuckles turning white, holding back. Harry wished he didn’t. He craved that instead of grabbing the edges like that, he gripped his hair. Hoped that instead of trying hard to not buck his hips up Harry’s mouth, he allowed himself to do so. To make Harry’s hair hurt slightly, to make him gag just a little. He wanted Malfoy to
Harry thrust harder, further, fastening his moves (or as much as he could in that position), but Draco was still biting his lips, trying to push aside any sudden gasp.
“I want you like this. Always.” Harry whispered to his ear sometime during it. Both completely naked, not only by clothes but by feelings.
In the dream, they were back in Sixth Year, Dumbledore alive in the Astronomy Tower repeating the words that somehow Harry never forgot:
Hermione told Harry that neither of them was at Level Six because Mr Borgin needed her and Draco to work outside the office on a potion lab to set and label some new remedies.
“I’m the Chosen One, you know,” Harry lowered his voice, smirking. “People would die to give me things like this.”
Draco licked his lips. And Harry lost it. Their lips answered almost immediately, moving with the same pace and hardness. Draco’s hand moved to the end of Harry’s shirt, tugging it into his fists, pushing him closer and closer. Harry knew Draco could probably taste the Midnight Flowers on his mouth because his tongue was working tough against his, barely letting him
Harry pulled back and took Draco’s dark purple pants out of their way. Those were his most comfortable and nice-looking pair.
After a hard month of effort, Hermione had charmed the wooden bar so drinks would float and create themselves with the perfect amount of ingredients.
Harry wasn’t too fond of having a bunch of Ministry employees in the party. Still, he was having a nice time chatting with his friends and laughing at the sight of Draco, completely changing his attitude whenever he was involved in a conversation with co-workers. Stiffened, elegant and with the stupid non-stop nodding without opening his mouth.
Harry felt a tug down his stomach when Draco said goodbye to him. He stayed longer than what he intended, Harry knew, but he still felt somehow disappointed. And it didn’t matter if they didn’t really talk that evening; it was still nice to know that somewhere in the house, Draco was still there, moving around the living room, helping him host his pathetic birthday party.
Harry looked up and locked their eyes. He wanted to keep his eyes open to see every single bit of desire on Draco’s gaze and posture. He rather died than close his eyes and missed the way Draco pushed his wet thumb away and gave his own prick a few strokes in front of Harry.
. Talk about what he needed to get done that day, making a list with the first thing he found in Harry’s kitchen. He would ask questions and also obligate Harry to answer.
It was a gift from Narcissa Malfoy. She had taken hers to give it to his son; “For you to have a piece of my garden in yours,” She finished while Harry drank his Neroli tea on his side.
Was Harry so drunk that he invited Malfoy to his house? And to do what? To have a quick shag with the enemy?
“...You know why I sent Miss Granger the letter that day?” She asked him, and Harry just shook his head in response. “Not because of the obvious reason, but because I wanted Draco to be with people her kind.”
“This tea is absolutely disgusting, Harry,” Draco told him one morning when their breakfast became routinely and not a once in a while thing.
Harry Potter made Draco feel. The way he looks at him during it, as if he was the most beautiful thing in the world. The way he touches, kisses, bites, licks.
Especially when the pleasant spring breeze brushed him like that. It was spring in Buenos Aires. Not only he hadn’t thought twice before taking the International Portkey to Argentina, but also he hadn’t considered the climate difference. What an idiot. Since when Draco didn’t contemplate things like that? Of course, it was spring in the southern hemisphere.
“And then…because I was already bad, it was okay if I made bad choices. It was justified. It made sense.”
Harry huffed, taking the clothes Hermione made him buy. Clothes that not only look and felt expensive but that, of course,
And closing the door, she left Harry and Draco alone in the warm garden. It would have been a dreamy experience if Harry wasn’t urgently trying to know how Draco was dealing with everything at the moment.
“Don’t.” Draco shook his head, “Look, you don’t do that to your friends. With them you’re truly attentive; you care as if you need it to breathe. We all know that. Everyone in this room knows you’d probably die to meet someone wish and that’s not even metaphorically-”
It wasn’t a Slytherin thing, Draco wanted to think. It was probably a product of his entire friend group being involved in the war; on the wrong side of it. Everyone was too stiffened, too quiet, and they all made bad choices and never got a question about it.
Harry didn’t want to talk about that. At all. He drank the rest of his Midnight flower. Of the stupid drink that tasted exactly like the taste of Draco’s mouth had the night they went home together for the first time. The ache at his stomach widened, burned.
With a heavy groan, he got out of bed and opened the window to let Hermione and Ron’s owl fly in the room. Harry took the small letter from the white owl, put his glasses on and read;
. He was tired of being in it for the stupidest little things, so he promised himself to never get the newspaper if he could avoid it. But right now, he needed it. He ran out of the door to a local Witch Café close to Grimmauld. It was hidden for muggles, and it was hard to find. Harry used to like it there. He liked the smell of morning coffee mixed weirdly with myrrh, an odd combination but definitely
“Why’d I sleep when the moon looks this beautiful?” And then she turned around to meet his eyes. With a soft hand, she patted the grass next to her, an invitation to sit.
The fifth of them were watching a movie at Ginny’s place. It was Ron, Neville and Ginny’s favourite activity; they were obsessed with muggle TV and could watch the most tedious and overused clichés on loop and still enjoy them.
Draco opened his legs further, letting Harry lift his left and locking it around his hips. Draco’s calf and ankle over his ass, his cold hands falling onto his shoulders to steady himself and not fall.
Harry closed his eyes and let the words flow around him. Tasting them. Letting them feed him like magic to his core. Savouring them the way he savoured the delicious Neroli tea he started to have with Mrs Malfoy weekly.
“Of course not.” Ron’s eyes didn’t meet Harry’s as he said it. “Look, I don’t bloody care about Malfoy. But he’s Mione’s friend, and she wanted to invite him.”
“Maybe we could make lists,” Seamus offered, and with a swing of his wand, he poured more witches brew on everyone’s tumbler. “A pros and cons list for The Chosen One’s possible partner.”
Hermione smiled sleepily. She was probably exhausting from the long month of planning. “Exceed my expectations, definitely. And I think I’m definitely heading for a new department. Mrs Lovellette was drunk on Orange Whisky all night and I
he usually told himself, having to talk to people he had no idea about or why they spoke to him in the first place.
ourselves to feel. The ones we permit. Maybe because of society, our environment, people at school or work. Commonly, people choose to deal with secondary emotions instead of primaries because we can’t tolerate feeling the real ones.
They didn’t run away to Buenos Aires at the end of the day. They stick to the old London instead. It was almost as good. Maybe one day they will visit Argentina after all.
i'm dedicating this chapter to @Rey_isdone, who has been commenting my work every chapter ♥︎  (ty ty ty)
like all the famous Quidditch players were getting now. But Harry laughed and, as usual, put his wand on the counter to jokily (or not so much) threaten her with using it if she grabbed the trimmer.
It was interesting to know how different they were, how Harry lived that past year hiding in obliviousness because he didn’t want to permit feeling love for Draco. And then, there was Draco, who hid in his own pain and self-hatred not to let Harry love him.
“Please, I don’t care.” Draco interrupted, looking away. His pale face was covered in red patches. Harry knew if he touched them, they would probably burn.
But he did. And they drank their Midnight Flowers in silence. Not meeting their eyes but fully noticing the closeness of their bodies. The alcohol acted fast on Harry. The flower essences making him dizzy. He felt his body loosened, the resentment he held inside fading.
“The war?” Harry challenged, with roughness on his tone of voice growing. “Your problem with him is what happened during the war?”
Harry was gulping the last bit of his second drink when he met Draco’s gaze. He was surrounded by some people, probably co-workers because Hermione was eagerly chatting next to him.
Harry kept quiet. He allowed Draco to run his fingers delicately while he looked down, at his tanned hands, at the Malfoy family ring around his finger.
Harry had decided to owl Mrs Malfoy the night before. When the options were short, and realized there was no other way of reaching Draco. He avoided at first because he didn’t know how much she knew about Harry and Draco’s relationship; how unexpected it might have been if he desperately wrote her.
The same speech that came from Draco’s mouth constantly. The speech that Harry had learned over the past year to listen. Knowing exactly how it started, how it developed and how it ended. He knew all the vowels to it, all its words.
“I can hear your thoughts all the way from here, by the way,” Draco said. He wasn’t eager to have a Hermione Granger thinking too loud on a Thursday morning. “Spill it out.”
Harry mimicked him. Oh well...they have almost finished anyway. The colours Red, White and Gold covered the entire garden. It was looking lovely, Harry had to admit it.
The same conversation repeated itself over and over for the rest of the month. No one truly expected it to be easy.
There was a big chance that his voice sounded bitter, annoyed. But he couldn’t really help himself. And Harry was probably too oblivious to realize, anyway.
And Harry smiled him back, feeling the pit of his stomach burn heavily, his heart twitching strangely and then…
Draco shook his head and emptied his cup of tea on the sink. Harry yelled at him, and they fought for a solid minute about it.
From an outsider perspective, it was as if they were playing some type of new game. It was names being said loudly, followed by a full analysis on why it would work or why it wouldn’t. It was magic floating in between them as the floating marker wrote each one of the names down. Drinks being served every time anyone named someone ridiculous.
And Harry was already drowning in emotions, so what was another crisis in the middle? He knew adding more problems to his actual ones was a way for him to not deal with his main issue; Draco Malfoy not talking to him anymore.
Neville was observing her with fondness as if her words were poems, and Harry couldn’t agree more. She continued, “Don’t reserve love for your dates only, give it away and then I’m sure it will come your way. If it hadn’t come already.”
is supposed to know. Intimate things; things about his vulnerability, things that he only learned at two in the morning when they were both naked under bedsheets.
“I want to do this, Hermione.” He whispered to her. He tried his voice to sound as steady as he could. “Just…let me try. And fail, probably. But
“What?” Hermione said incredulously. “Why would you leave my birthday party? You want to make me have a full
And it felt like the Universe seemed to know exactly what it was doing because, for a whole week, the storms in London were uncontrollable. The weather tuning in with Harry’s emotions, the heavy rain impeccably matching his irritability.
. The idea of someone finding out his soft spots, finding out the way Draco liked to be kissed. The way his gasps felt onto his mouth. The image of Draco moaning someone else’s name didn’t make sense to Harry. It just didn’t. It was pure hypocrisy. Harry of course knew that. But...
“Ugh, don’t mention it,” Draco said, without moving his hand away from Harry’s touch. “Mr Borgin keeps telling me to add Magical Hibiscus to the potion we’re working on, which is so stupid because it literally makes the whole potion burn in your hands, and he should know better, he’s in the Ministry-–”
And just then, when Harry opened his mouth to make his thoughts real words, the conversation was interrupted by no other than Draco standing in front of the wooden garden door.
Draco took his forearm out of his face and locked eyes with Harry. His face was all flushed in red. “It was the right place to do it. To prove that I wasn’t bad after all. If they accepted me, if they finally saw through me, maybe it’d mean that I’m not bad after all.”
Harry’s chest grew big, he suddenly felt suffocated. He grabbed the first thing he found on a chair of old clothes and dressed quickly.
“It’s not a-–” But Harry let the sentence trailed off. He was already blushing, and it was better not to repeat the word break-up in front of Draco.
he will never get used to the sight of Draco fully naked in front of him. Harry moaned. He was still wearing all his clothes.
The year after the war ended, when he was sent to a mind healer, he learned something. It was small. But it stood with him ever since he heard it.
“Supposed”, He shrugged, his fingers brushing his pale blonde hair, tugging it behind his ears, “I’m not going back to the party.”
And…I was--I couldn’t handle it. My entire life I felt like I was a bad person and this man who I had to kill was the first one to tell me the opposite.”
Harry then notice a strong burgundy coloured mark on the back of his hands. It looked like a bad burn. “What’s that?” He said as he brushed the pad of a finger lightly over it.
“Bless the person who is brave enough to date a Malfoy!” Ron said, pulling his drink up as to make a toast for it.
Ginny insisted everyone stayed the night. And with a couple swinging of wands, the living room was filled with soft, colourful pillows and blankets all around. It looked so peaceful that by just looking at it, Harry could easily fall fast asleep.
“Thank you very much. That makes me feel better.” Malfoy huffed, grabbing his drink way too hard with his hands.
. In contrast, Harry’s were a polar opposite. They were bigger in size, rough-looking, nothing elegant in them, with a few black hairs where the ring should fit.
Marcus was doing the job. Lovely. Amazing. Fantastic. But the twinge on his stomach was still there, present,
When Draco finished, he put the comb down somewhere in the bed, and kissed Harry’s cheek from behind. The air felt strange. They really flipped from yelling to grooming in a matter of minutes. “Done, love.”
“Think about Rosie!” Ginny interrupted him. “She’s nice. And you don’t know her, and if it goes completely wrong, you never have to see her again. And the Cup is almost over, so
That was the night Harry dropped his pointless dating. When he decided he didn’t want to be a boyfriend, a partner, not yet. That he was okay with this weird relationship he built now that he and Draco talked during his nights together.
A year ago, Harry would never in his right mind think that he was going to spent his birthday like that; on his couch naked after Draco had fucked him, laughing at the exaggerated face he pulled when looking at the food served on the kitchen counter.
“Leave us,” Blaise said them, and Ginny busted out a laugh. “Use another room if you two want to fuck.”
with contempt. That same man was now breathing heavy, eyes close and body fully delivered. He pushed another finger further into Draco’s arsehole.
“It’s weird,” Ron continued. “She says he’s nice, polite and all that shit. He even has a sense of humour, surprisingly.”
Hermione left them, and with a heavy breath, Harry looked at his feet. He felt exhausted. Without meeting Draco’s eyes, he turned around, heading his steps to the inside of the house, where the music wasn’t loud, and his mind could find rest.
It was a true journey for me to write and post this story. The last time I post a fanfiction I was eleven (now I’m twenty-two!!). Before this, I used to write drabbles that never passed the first draft. So…finishing this is genuinely terrifying for me. That’s why feedback is appreciated!
“Look who is there!” Seamus shouted when Harry entered The Leaky Cauldron and spotted them at their usual table. He was late, as usual.
Draco tasted like red wine. His lips were tinted in a burgundy colour, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from biting them, licking and catching his lower lip in between his teeth.
And as if Luna had heard his thoughts (sometimes Harry thought she really could) she said, “Love is not reserve for relationships only.”
After Ginny, he dated others. Humdrum dates with people from Auror’s Training, friends from Neville or friends from Seamus. He dated pretty girls that he liked but never enough, and occasionally boys that intimidate him to consider liking.
He was glad Harry kept his eyes closed. He couldn’t bear it whenever Harry opened them and looked at him directly with those wide green eyes. With that gaze of lust and hunger and--
for touch. But Harry was too slow; because he was already coming, completely untouched, with an orgasm that cut him so fast that he could only muffle a hard moan into Draco’s cock.
It was Ginny and Blaise, and also Ron and Hermione, and everyone knew Seamus and Dean had a thing for each other even though they acted like they didn’t.
“How is dating Turner?” Draco interrupted before Harry could continue. There was a slight tint of fear in his voice.
“I hate this office,” Harry said, observing everything. Clean, empty, cold, packed by paperwork and shelves filled with labelled potions.
him. Not only fogging his mind but also his body. Making him have stomach aches during midday and not wanting to have dinner the nights he thought about it too much.
They woke up in the early morning, and with an awkward and meaningless exchange of words, Malfoy was gone from Grimmauld Place. Leaving with the definite idea of ignoring each other for the rest of their existence.
So he worked on his own clothes, pulling them aside, stroking himself with the sticky lube warm from being inside Draco. He didn’t want to look up. He didn’t want to meet Draco’s stern gaze on him. He couldn’t deal with that right now.
Harry understood the whole Malfoy thing worked solely because it gave him consistency. Then, with their small morning conversations, Harry allowed himself to notice things about him. Like the way he liked to be touch, or the way he liked to be kissed. He noticed Draco craved for slow unhurried kisses instead of the hard ones Harry usually gave. It was during nights in which Draco fell on his back, fingers tangled in Harry’s hair, when he noticed Draco’s tongue on him trying to slow the pace, his mouth making an effort to change Harry’s rhythm. And Harry simply followed.
Harry would never admit it to Draco, but he thought if it had something to do with Grimmauld Place. It was not the first time both of them had a similar conversation. Harry would repeat that he didn’t hate his place; Draco insisted that The Manor was completely normal; they would give each other knowing looks and then leave it at that.
Well, that, and a nice garden. But that was Draco’s request too, so it didn’t really need clarification.
So Harry pulled off slowly. Getting himself out of Draco, with the head of his cock outside the hole,
Draco shrugged. He got up from his chair and took Harry’s plate to the kitchen. Harry didn’t want to push too much when Draco got like that, so he waited silently.
“Jesus, no.” Harry interrupted.  “But now that you bring that up, it feels like you are still guilty about it….”
But before Harry really could think about it, he was being dragged by Draco to a small hall. He opened a new door and then pushed him inside the bathroom.
“Come on!” Harry exclaimed as he slipped onto his trousers, keeping the mocking tone in his voice. “It was really lovely; you were so
But it wasn’t only his obliviousness. They both knew that. Harry simply couldn’t allow himself to think about them.
Draco’s gaze didn’t say that much, but Harry knew him too well. He was very still, his eyes determined and dim over Harry. His hands were wrapped around his glass a bit too tight. Harry shuddered.
“You never do,” Harry said, echoing his voice tone. And then said the only thing he knew how to handle with Draco, “But okay, want to kiss me?”
“Granger told you that?” Draco interrupted. He was frowning. The words came in a strange tone that meant
. However, he had decided to walk from Fika’s Kitchen all the way to Diagonal Alley. His date had been a debacle, and he thought the best option was to just
And then, Harry thought about Luna. Their night conversation, the way she told Harry that love was about being vulnerable. That was terrifying but also
So Harry stayed. Too sore, too tired and too confused. He wasn’t looking for any new conversation, so he remained in the back, cleaning the empty glasses, the plates, the kitchen.
Harry gazed down at his outfit. He never gave much attention to his appearance. Months would go by without a proper haircut; he wouldn’t bother with taking care of it, always using the cheapest all-in-one shampoo and conditioner on the market. His outfit choices surrounded a simple concept; being comfortable. So it was during times like this, after a date, that he looked
“It’s beautiful there,” Draco smiled, “And the Quidditch players are phenomenal…maybe you should drop Auror Training and play Quidditch there.”
“I don’t even know her!” Harry frowned; it had been a long time since his friends interfered with his non-existent love life. “And she was suddenly telling me I was
Because that was precisely what he needed. As he tapped the wood again, and the flowers started to dance once again in front of them, he felt
“I don’t know,” He repeated. “Honestly? Nothing. I don’t want to do anything about it. It’s terrifying. I can’t believe how frightening it is.”
Harry felt a small ache under his navel, a burning sensation. A knot present on his throat. The image of Draco Malfoy doing anything with someone other than him
A couple of hours later, when everyone was strolling around the room, talking loudly and sharing drinks, Harry allowed himself to get close to Draco. He had tried hard to stay present, to not drag himself to him, to give him the space he
However, he wasn’t able to hide his smile, and when he looked up from his teacup to meet Mrs Malfoy, he noticed a caring gaze looking at him. A fond smile that Harry knew too well from seeing it in his son’s expression. He could catch the sadness that swung in it.
“Apparently I was flirting with the son of one of his enemies at the Ministry, or some shit like that.”
Heat suddenly invaded Harry's face. He was burning and blushing, and he wanted to hex Malfoy. “I’m drunk, whatever.”
The minute Harry finished dressing up, he saw himself in the mirror, and he felt like an idiot. He had the hasty impulse of getting a haircut when he woke that morning. It had been three months since he last got a pair of scissors close to his hair, and he decided that
Harry lifted one hand and started to gently touch Draco’s naked chest. Creating small circles, the way he knew Draco liked. It was lovely to see his face whenever he did that; with eyes closed, feeling each soft press of his fingertips.
They stood silent, looking at the full blue moon in front of them as if it was intoxicating, and Harry was probably about to sleep in any minute if it wasn’t for wise Luna who said softly;
Harry at first making a slow rhythm that then felt unbearable. Making both of them needing more, wanting more of each other. To sink further.
Everything had gone wrong. He had talked to The Enemy in the first place, he had gotten completely wasted, got horny because The Enemy wasn’t bad looking, had asked him if he liked blokes even though he already
The pleading voice of Draco made him dizzy. Harry’s eyes fluttered close as the shivering sensation flooded him. Then moved quickly to work on Draco’s trousers; taking the belt away, unbuttoning his fly, unzipping and pushing them down all the way down to the floor. Allowing Harry to properly settle himself in between Draco’s naked legs. He widened the gap, pressing his knees further from each side.
. It was incantations coming out of his wand without being cast, spells chaotically enchanted, reminding Harry of his first days at Hogwarts, when he was still trying to get used to a wand, to
“Mione, I need your yelling.” Harry had asked Hermione one night at The Leaky when the rest were too caught up in a new round of
“Fuck off.” Harry scoffed and left the mirror to sit next to Draco. “Let’s swapped clothes right now, give me your shirt.”
“Did you hex him mid-sex?” Ron asked him cheekily. He and Hermione were calmer than the rest about the situation. They weren’t mocking him as much as the rest. Well…Ron was laughing uncontrollably, but at least he was not saying much. Even Luna and Neville were making fun of him, asking him embarrassing questions.
The room was silent, only the noises of heavy breathing, almost hearing the way their hearts were pounding hard in between them.
When Harry pulled away, his thumb brushed Draco’s swollen lips. “Lovely,” He muttered. And hid his face onto Draco’s neck, nibbling and kissing franticly. Draco arched in response and let a small whimper out of his mouth.
“Please don’t!” Ron chuckled at his side, spilling his drink everywhere. “Luna, you should stop adding whatever you are putting to the brew,”
“Lovely,” Harry snorted. “Oh yes, lovely! Let’s all be friends with former Death Eaters. Shall I call Goyle for a date next or?”
Harry remembered a younger Hermione, entering for the first time The Ministry, helped by McGonagall, into the Department of Magical Education. Harry loved to visit her there. It was probably one of the only departments that Harry didn’t loathe. It reminded Harry of Hogwarts, of McGonagall, of his old home and old professors. It felt…
It was easy to deal with emotions like that. It was easier than putting them away, analysing them, and then dealing with their results.
“Harry,” He interrupted. It was the first time Malfoy called him by his first name outside sex, outside the usual moan that accompanied it. “You—I’m not meant for dating. It’s just…too much for me. So, if this is fine for you, well…I like it. I’d like to keep doing it.”
“Gladly…” Draco started, a lovely smirk formed on his face. He was looking really handsome tonight. “He’s not coming so there was no need.”
He knew it was the panic taking over him and that Ginny was probably trying to make him a favour. But why would he go back to that? He remembered exactly how it started; everyone around him dating, feeling overwhelmed, trying to date, forgetting about his dates, never owling or calling back, and then falling into his bed with Draco.
, you definitely hate it.” Draco assured him, “And it doesn’t make any sense you still live in it. You’re a single gay man in an old wizarding house.”
Then he felt a soft kiss on his cheek, the strong scent of incense, and the noise of sheets moving around him.
“Yea, I think I’m going to do that.” Harry started nodding, trying to hide his inside throbbing. “Yea, yea- And if it doesn’t work out then I’ll completely drop this quest.”
“Not exactly,” Harry knitted his eyebrows. He eyed Draco carefully, trying to decode him. “It’s not a big deal, doesn’t matter.”
They fell asleep again after their second orgasm, overcome and overflow by the sensation of affection. Of required and reciprocate love.
Harry’s mind fogged, memories flying as he shut his eyes, remembering Draco. Draco, during those first birthday parties, nodding at conversation, wanting to help, only agreeing to everyone’s point of view because he wanted to be good in other people eyes.
So it wasn't the same, but Harry still had colourful flowers blooming around his feet, the way he always liked.
ring?!” Draco said horrify, trying to take his hand away from Harry’s firm grip. “I’m scared because you’re not joking.”
But Hermione and everyone’s effort really did something, because, by the end of it, the garden was looking absolutely lovely. A mix of green shades next to off whites all around, with magical lights shimmering around everyone. The food was floating with magic around the corners.
“Well, I don’t,” Ron muttered. “Okay? Err…If I was an animal…I guess I would marry Crookshanks. I mean, I already live with him. And no, I’m not going to say fuck because that bloody disturbing…I will softly kiss in the cheek Buckbeak.”
The three Midnight Flowers were poured in front of them, the shimmery rich purple swimming on the glass. Harry took a big slurp and then said trustfully, “I’m sorry.”
But Harry never listened, and he was too busy examining Draco’s outfit anyway, “Your rings! That’s it. Give me one.”
To Harry’s surprise, when he reached the bar, he sighted Neville and Luna getting up and walking closer to his side. He decided their company couldn’t do any harm, and it was better than the rest of the options, anyway.
“What does that supposed to mean?” Draco frowned, but Harry could tell he was trying to cover a smile slowly building on his lips. A part of Harry wished that it meant he was happy to see him. “It’s better than the chaos of Level Two.”
Was this what he happened to become? A bloke longing for a relationship but never finding The One? His friends not being surprised that he couldn’t keep a girl for longer than three dates?
“How long could Draco Malfoy stay in a place he didn’t plan beforehand?” Harry smirked. “I grew up with Hermione. I know how your minds work, believe me.”
“I can’t believe it,” Harry growled. They were lazily fixing the garden decorations for Ron’s twenty-four year’s old party. “You invite him here, next you’re gonna talk to him,
He pressed Draco’s body to the nearest wall. Draco wasn’t surprised, still holding his peeved expression. It made Harry craved him even more, needing to see him softening under his palms, breathing heavily against his neck…
The way the Spanish pronunciation came from Draco’s lip made Harry shiver. He had never heard him speaking any language other than a few words in French.
“Oh, sod off.” Harry rolled his eyes; maybe if he wasn’t that drunk, he could start another fight...or perhaps hexed Malfoy out of his house. “What happened to the Malfoy that nodded to everything I said?”
, like if he would ever in his right mind say something like that. And after all, they fell asleep minutes or seconds after it began. They didn’t even get to fuck.
(the quotes you saw throughout the fic are from hermetic teachings!) in my opinion, it fitted perfectly with harry and draco’s relationship. ♥
Harry couldn’t pay too much attention to everyone’s drunken laughs because he was too busy trying to make the blush on his face disappeared. “Oh, piss off! You could at least bring better Slytherins to the equation…Like Zabini or Parkinson,”
In the letter Hermione received from Narcissa Malfoy, there was a preposition. An offer to work next to Malfoy side. He had been assisting an old man whose name was Brutus R. Borgin, and they needed more “help”. Hermione was sure that
“Harry,” Neville started, a soft gesture formed on his face. A concerned look. “I-I’m really sorry this isn’t working out for you.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry added quickly, “The point is that he’s mad at me, we’d sex in your ugly bathroom and then he left without saying goodbye.”
“I’d love to do that,” Harry smirked, getting closer and trying to not think about evident looks around them. “It’s fine. I’d worse.”
And then there was Draco Malfoy. Reputation ruined (that was for sure), but nonetheless a Malfoy, and still got a place inside the Ministry of Magic. Like his father, and the father of his father, and so on. During his years after Hogwarts, he specialized in Potion Brewing, which led him to work in the
“That’s what I was saying!” Hermione pointed out. “Anyway, we have a lot to do. Draco, you can’t go home yet. I know it’s getting late, but….”
“I want to have kids one day,” Harry huffed and took another bite of his blueberry muffin. The morning was surprisingly warm, and they were enjoying their breakfast in the garden.
He would never admit it or say it with actual words; he pretended to be cold or distant about the things that hurt him. But at intimate things like kissing or having sex, it was impossible to keep acting. It was impossible to hide vulnerability. Harry couldn’t complain, not even a little.
It led to Harry’s explanation of how he had always been (accompanied or not) temperamental in the mornings. And after that small and meaningless conversation, Draco began accepting tea before leaving.
Draco was relatively silent. He was only leaving heavy breaths on his ear. Not moaning or panting as he usually did.
Narcissa let another laughed, and Draco looked at her, astonished. Maybe it wasn’t only Harry that was surprised to hear the sound of her laugh.
This time it was just Harry and Draco at it. Neville had given them recommendations for certain plants according to the location they were dealing with; the way the sun hit the ground, the way the place was distributed, and the trees that were already there stood against it.
Antonietta was surprised to see him alone, without Draco dragging him through the door of the salon. “And your
“Yes, finally.” Draco sighed, looking up to meet his eyes. “It’s like you been trying to tell me something for an hour now.”
It was pure annoyance and angriness that Harry didn’t seem to be able to put away just by mumbling insults or heavy complaints. And everyone around him was pretty much tired of it.
So he moved towards him. His steps not gracefully slow, the way Malfoy usually walked. Chaotic pace, with his glass of Firewhisky, trembling and spilling alcohol as he walked to him.
Draco looked at his watch. 18:25. Less than an hour before the Portkey to London closed for the day. He breathed in…then out.
“Nice to meet you,” Harry said, thinking about how rude it would be to press the lift buttons right that second.
It was as fast as Draco had begged him; more consistent shoves, harder onto Draco’s body. And it felt incredible and good, but Harry wasn’t looking at him. He was gazing down at where their bodies met, and it wouldn’t really have mattered if it wasn’t because of his strange expression seconds ago.
Because never in his short adult life he had thought he would be ever doing this. On his bed, with Malfoy panting softly with each thrust, taking Harry through his orgasm with no sign of effort.
Harry,” Draco muttered. Harry noticed exasperation in his voice, “We knew this was going to be over. Your little quest, my inability to date. Come on, it was written in the stars.”
, Harry.” Ron threatened, without a hint of humour in his voice. “You just can’t. You did once, remember Cho? And that turned out horrific!”
He wasn’t lying. Draco didn’t think he could live if he ever saw Harry wearing his clothes. The thought of Harry well fitted, on a button-up shirt, good fabric embracing his muscles, trousers instead of jeans… Draco felt himself shudder.
It didn’t take more than a couple of seconds for Draco to feel familiar with the sensation. He squeezed Harry’s arm, letting him know wordlessly he could continue.
When Harry arrived, before crossing the main door of the bar, he breathed in and then out. He certainly didn’t want to do this today, but he hated to cancel on his friends.
It was always around him; movements, choices, and decisions being made long before he was born. It was life plans prepared for him before he knew magic was held within his core. It was fucking prophecies all around.
“I’m starting to wonder why I’m having sex with someone that seems to despise me,” Draco slapped his hand, and with a smirk added, “You’re not even that good at it.”
He opened his eyes and met Harry’s holding a playful expression; “I don’t feel like rushing, you know.” And stopped his movements, staying still, deep inside of Draco.
“Yes, I understood the question.” Malfoy’s words were coming out politely, but Harry felt the coldness in them. “Why are you asking?”
“And this stupid quest was hard and complicated, but at least it wasn’t terrifying. At least I felt like I could control it, that I could control whatever was happening about it. And if it felt anything remotely like this then I’d quit and move to the next date. But right now…It’s like I can’t escape this feeling.”
Harry didn’t mind. He’ll still affirm he wasn’t a morning person, however, he had to acknowledge that there was nothing more pleasant than an early morning with Draco.
obsessing with the idea of knowing what he was up to every second. Being right at the end and also being wrong in so many other ways.
. Harry did. Rolled his hips with a hesitant press at first, and then tighter when a soft pant came out of Draco’s lovely
The news of Ginny dating did something to Harry. It was hard for him to put it in words; maybe it was jealousy, or perhaps he was envious. Not because he wanted her, but because he realised he wanted
After Ron’s birthday, it was Neville who brought him into conversations. On a Saturday night at The Leaky, he told them that Malfoy was owling him lately. He had written him about the specialization he took on
Harry would talk, and Draco would mostly nod, sipping the hot black tea, only responding in the necessary bits, as if he didn’t want to make Harry mad. But Harry was mad anyway just because he agreed with him for nothing.
“What now, Hermione?” He grunted. Harry knew she was holding her words back. It was worse to have her like that, not talking but
“Don’t worry, I don’t hold a grudge anymore. But if you think you did so much better than Mr Malfoy, then I think you should revisit your past actions. Because from what I recall, most of the people here pretended the Second War never happened till it was already over.”
Maybe he tried. Harry couldn’t be sure because he was trying his hardest to avoid him. Each time their eyes met for a second -because, well, Harry was all the time looking– he would quickly brush it off changing his sight to somewhere else. And by the time Malfoy made a move to leave the party, Harry ran to the loo the minute he saw him giving the first goodbye.
Draco did. It wasn’t because of his father threat, but because his mother had begged him that night that he shouldn’t forget, never in his life, where his life began.
Harry had done it a million times already over the past few months. He knew how to handle a casual shag with a stranger. But this time, it was different. Malfoy was not a stranger, they didn’t even flirt with each other (not consciously at least), and he was overcome by million sensations.
He wasn’t as careful with Draco’s clothes. He never was; no matter how many times Draco insisted that his were pristine and should be treated with care.
But Luna didn’t talk, didn’t intervene. Instead, she stood silent, waiting for Harry’s following words.
So he did. The waiting for the flowers to bloom, for the herbs to rise, and the trees to root, gave Harry
they might be, they all have the same words on repeat on themselves, written down on paper. Probably for generations to come, and for them to read and consumed the way
course he couldn’t. Because Harry was hypnotized looking at his own hand, looking at his fingers coming in and out of Draco’s.
“And it was also headquarters of the Order,” Harry quirked his mouth, “Look it needs to be fixed but--”
his family ring?” Marcus said in surprise, almost choking on his drink. “My mother will definitely kill me if I gave someone mine.”
with it. After a year of doing whatever the hell they had been doing, they both compromised on that word.
. Draco wanted to relax his neck into the pillow, to look at the ceiling as he enjoyed the sensation of Harry warm fingers inside him.
“Careful with your words, Potter.” Blaise pointed with a smirk. “What I meant is that he never really dated, and you know, I wished he had someone.”
While the laughing, mocking, and commentary continued, Harry decided it was time to use the loo. He hadn’t really drunk that much, and he was growing into a bad mood. And it definitely didn’t help that Hermione waited for him outside the loo. “Hey,” She spoke gently, “You ok?”
. Once he opened the big wooden doors and ordered a plain black coffee, he asked the waitress for today’s copy of The Daily.
“No, I didn’t hex him because we didn’t really have time for much.” He admitted. It was better if he told them the truth. It was much better than letting them imagine that he and Malfoy had the best sex of their lives.
It was cheesy, and it made Harry felt stupid, but there was something in knowing precisely what the other person needed at that time.
Without being able to think it -to fully process it, he was involved in their conversation. With a quiet Malfoy next to him and a loud Blaise trying to keep the conversation from ending. At first, Harry tried to act cold,
“Oh, definitely.” She moved around the office, papers flying all around her, “Thank you, love. Are you going home already?”
They fell asleep. Or perhaps they didn’t. But they both closed their eyes for the rest of the night. Until dawn, when a soft voice from Draco’s lips came. Weak and low, and Harry only wanted to kiss it,
“I’m not dating anyone either.” Neville pointed out. “Luna isn’t dating, Sean and Dean are in love, yet they aren’t dating. Draco isn’t either, and from what Blaise said, he never in his twenty-five years had. You sound as if you’re the only one who’s struggling with dates.”
. He didn’t want the blank and hollow space on his heart now that the adrenaline of his previous years disappeared.
For a while, the game kept like that, with funny and witty combinations that made everyone laugh till crying. Then, as it also did last time, it shifted into a more personal and more realistic type of game. It was better to do it like this, when everyone felt relax and with more drinks on their system. “Ginny, your turn!” Dean started, “
The fast rhythm of the thrusts against his mouth made Harry’s eyes maintain close. Letting be filled only by sensations; the harsh grip of Draco’s hand over his head, the heat and weight of each shove against his tongue, the hitched breath, and the smell of Draco’s sex impregnated all over. Harry could hear his heartbeat throbbing feverishly.
Harry’s mood rapidly changed whenever someone mentioned his name. One thing was Hermione; another was everyone in his friend group losing their minds.
And he couldn’t finish his sentence because he allowed himself to break off. To cry the way he had wanted to the minute they both entered his room. And
“Yes, terrifying. I know.” Harry said as both of them stood in the hallway. “After Sirius died, he left it for me.”
“Oh, this is lovely.” Malfoy stepped in; his voice was low and soft, unrecognizable for Harry. “This part of the house is nice.”
” Malfoy said with a smile, as if he had been waiting for Harry to finally ask. “It’s just a mix of flower essences with alcohol.”
Harry wondered if Malfoy had finally realised that he just enjoyed fighting, especially when he was drunk and next to an old archenemy. “Let me prove you that,”
Even now, that Neville skipped game night because he felt sick, he had thought about flooing to his house before Apparating to Grimmauld to check on him, to tell him he was
“Hermione,” He breathed out, “I like him. He doesn’t want me back. I’ve tried telling him; I gave him the whole speech on how messy and desperate I’m for love and that no one seems to fit me. He
Not only he was doomed to like Hermione since the moment they met, but of course, he was also doomed to fall in love with Harry Potter.
Was this always going to happen? The memories of him asking Draco out for dinner for the first time started to torment him. Remembering the stillness on Draco’s body, the steadiness of his voice. Draco had always been sure of what he wanted, want he wanted
, probably trying to clean the errors of their past actions. He talked with Malfoy once or twice in the halls of the Ministry, when it was all paperwork, trials, and the Ministry trying to fix the fiasco they made in the past. They had exchanged some cold hello’s, avoiding at all cost eye contact. It happened while Harry was living his worse, and by the look of Malfoy’s expressions (Harry dared to look at him when he knew he wasn’t going to get caught), he was not in a much better place than him.
“I don’t want to get too comfortable here,” Harry said bitterly. He knew he was childish. He didn’t care. Whenever Harry got angered, he just pushed too hard.
Hermione was a terrible liar; did Draco really think he could leave the fucking country without Harry knowing? The sleepless nights at least gave him something.
“It has a P,” And Draco finally met Harry’s eyes, a deep grey, “Harry, this is a Potter family ring.”
Ginny broke up with him a year after the war ended. He couldn’t say he was surprised; nothing really surprised him those days. He felt sorry for her, knowing that she had to deal with the mess that Harry was during those times.
“What are you laughing about now?” Draco said, rejoining the room with Harry’s clothes in his hands. “Here, I lied. I do care about you being naked at your birthday party. Please, change immediately.”
“I don’t beg forgiveness, Potter.” Malfoy continued. “But I don’t want to fight, and neither do I want to bother you. So I’m leaving.”
He was irritated, annoyed, and fucking angry at Malfoy for serving him two Whatever Flowers. And somehow horny, because Malfoy was not bad looking after all. The idea of touching him, of breaking his elegant posture, making his rigid aspect a mess, and to untie his clothes, was just…
“I don’t know, Potter, just–-” And he pressed Harry back to him, entangling his fingers in Harry’s hair, reaching for his lips once again.
“I like him.” He spilt out. He wasn’t surprised about his confession; his body felt warm after the tea, and his only desire was for Mrs Malfoy to truly understand him.
“It looks amazing, by the way,” Draco finally said. “Not surprised by Antoniette skills, of course, but I think this time she did absolutely fantastic--”
He had said. But, in reality, they both knew that they simply needed each other like that, in proximity.
wasn’t listening to him. He called the lift and, with a sigh, continued, “It’s a shame he is good at this. But I guess it’s genetics; the Malfoys had always been really good when it comes to Potions. A shame.”
It was a silence that was clearly flooded by memories. The memories each one of them had concerning any of the Malfoys. Some stronger than others, but still present.
Like the way his hair was the same as his father’s, same height, same facial features. Wasn’t it also possible to acquire and develop the same attitude towards life? The constant thinking and thinking and thinking. Draco didn’t want to think about Lucius, no. Not now, not ever. They didn’t talk anymore, so was any good to think about him?
A month after that, she was working next to Malfoy. Assisting old Brutus Borgin into a Potion Regulation project in which Harry didn’t pay much attention, neither was interested in knowing.
Harry dragged his mouth out of Draco’s neck, lifting his head to meet his grey eyes. His lips were swollen, and his hair rumpled by Harry’s previous hands. The sight made Harry’s heart throbbed hard. “You are so beautiful.”
He tried to keep his eyes open as he rode Harry. Feeling the pleasure waved him over. The pleasure of the sex, the pleasure of seeing Harry beautiful and careless like that, of hearing his own moans mixed with Harry’s hard pants.
When both of their pants were out of their way, Harry muttered a spell with his wand, and a shiny and sticky texture dripped into his fingers. They were covered in lube from his fingertips to where the ring met his palm—the
But the next week, when Draco was back, a new teabag was on his cup. Green leaf tea mixed with Orange slices and Lavender flowers. Exactly the one that Draco, during that last fight, yelled at him that would be
“Exactly.” Draco huffed but kept his body still so Harry could continue with the soothing pattern over his chest. “And I’d immediately hex the guy that did that to me.”
Mrs Malfoy’s letter arrived no more than a couple of hours later, with a time and place to meet, including a dress code (for some strange reason). He was glad he had cut his hair that past week, that he looked tidier than other times, more presentable. Before Apparating in a station close to The Manor, he took the Malfoy ring out of his finger; he wasn’t
So in order for him to properly flirt with a man, he needed to be plastered on alcohol, or perhaps like it had been with Draco, overcome by one particular emotion, making it for him too blurry to separate. His first months hanging out with Draco were a combination of both; drunkenness of birthday parties and hating him for being so damn attractive.
He started to look at Hermione and Ron’s relationship, how happy they moved at talk. How soft they acted around each other when no one was looking. How they tangled their hands together...They didn’t show their relationship to the outside much; they were both shy about it. It was during movies when Harry noticed them softly touching each other’s hair. Or maybe on Saturday nights, the echo of loving voices coming from his kitchen.
“My father,” Draco’s grip on Harry’s shoulders tightened, “When I—” He breathed in, then out. “I got into a fight with my father at fourteen. It was…bad. I said things because I wanted to hurt him somehow. I think-I think I was angry at something, maybe at you and all the attention you were getting for the tournament,” Draco snorted,
“You can’t judge someone by just one date,” Hermione said, but in her voice, there was neither judgment nor recrimination. She held soft eyes for him.
Harry muttered a cleaning spell when they began dressing. After they both came, a new tension formed in the air, thick in between them. They both stood silent, without meeting each other’s gaze.
Harry didn’t want to wait any longer; it truly felt stupid and unnecessary, so without a second thought, he added, “I thought you liked it. What we do −what we used to do.”
So he gave him a nod, and Harry moved to sit on the edge of the bed. Draco sat behind him, legs on each side of his thighs, and grabbed the plastic comb out of Harry’s hand.
“Like you?” Ginny winked at him. She had an arm around Blaise, giving it gentle caresses to his side.
Because Sirius had given the place to him, and it felt like one of those gifts you hate, but because someone you love gave them to you, you still used them. Like the gifts Arthur gives you at Christmas, horrific and somehow terrifying, but you still used them because you love him.
Draco obeyed and, with a swift move, sat over the kitchen counter, spreading his knees open to each side, to let Harry glided his body in between. As Harry kissed Draco’s neck roughly, he dropped his hands over Draco’s thighs, caressing and stroking them from the knees to the upper part of it, and then again down and up.
Hermione followed. Harry knew it was thanks to Ron, who was tinting her life little by little. She started reading the way she used to read, and began working towards her goals once again…
Harry knew it wasn’t going to be easy even before he started. So why was he so disappointed? Why did he felt the ache on his stomach crawling him every night after coming back from another plain and boring date?
He was concentrating on funding his body to his somehow; he was trying to find thoughts –thoughts that were foggy and fuzzy on his mind. Separating his lips to kiss Malfoy’s cheek, chin, neck. Trying to do everything he had thought about seconds ago, eager to mess with his stiffness, to make it as messy as Harry’s appearance.
And it was even better when he did, because Malfoy, without saying hello first, blurted out immediately, “What do you want, Potter? To mock me? To make fun of me for the rest of my miserable existence?”
Harry thought. After a month of saving Draco’s gift, Harry felt the knot on his stomach untie. Having that wooden box hidden inside his closet made him anxious and uneasy since he got it for him.
And while Draco thought of what to say next, Harry took the opportunity and brutally stole one of the rings.
he had had some type of relationship with Pansy Parkinson during his Sixth Year at Hogwarts. But he was pretty busy back then with Voldemort breathing down his neck.
“I’m going to get a drink,” He announced, getting on his feet. “So you can whisper about the pandemonium that is my life while I’m gone.”
Draco’s cheeks started to feel warm under his touch, all flushed. Harry moved his hands to his hair, carding his fingers through it and then tugging it. Draco responded with a wheeze onto his mouth and skimmed his hands down Harry’s body. Untucking his shirt out of his jeans, gliding his hands into his lower back. The coolness made Harry jumped a little, leaving a smile on their kiss. He was now used to it, to Draco’s constantly freezing fingers and the touch of the silver rings over Harry’s skin. It would only take seconds to mimic Harry’s temperature.
Pansy had said to him after he put an end to it. After apologizing and feeling like a horrible person for dating her in the first place.
Luna quirked her mouth, “That sad, you two work nicely together.” And Harry felt something sinking on his inside.
The garden was the last bit of their moving. They left it for a day in which everything felt somehow organized and could concentrate on the task.
Draco was the only one who decided it was better if he left. Harry had the suspicion that left because he could trust himself with spending the night somewhere near him. Or maybe that’s what Harry wanted to think; that Draco was incapable of saying no if he crawled close to him sleepily in the middle of the night.
He held a casual look, but of course, there was nothing casual in the way Draco dressed. Harry had since him a million times; he had seen him neatly rolling his sleeves, perfectly tucking his shirt under his trousers, not a slight bit of
Maybe he shouldn’t approach things like that. Perhaps he should keep quiet, allowing Draco to talk all he wanted without him Harry saying a word, “No. Sorry, you don’t have to explain it to me. It’s fine, I’m just–-I want to see you okay, Draco.”
“Harry,” Luna said, shifting her body to finally meet Harry, to lock her gaze with his. “I may not fully comprehend romantic love, but I know full well what love is…And
His hands gripping hard on Draco’s soft hips, controlling his movements, pushing in and then out. Finding a delighting rhythm.
As Harry promised, it was different. Less chaotic, but with that same frantic pace. And when Harry finally thrust into Draco’s body, letting the shiver and the pleasure of it flowed through him, he realized he had probably lost his mind.
“My Draco will be okay, I know that.” Narcissa continued. “I made a lot of mistakes when raising him, but I know that ever since he was little I taught him to be persistent, to try and try. So I know he’ll be okay.”
She told him how they met, how they started to talk, and how they ended up on a first date. She told him he was nice and funny, and that he paid attention to her needs (unlike him). She asked him if it made him jealous, and Harry could only be honest;
Did she know his son spend at least one night of the week at his house? Did she know Harry makes Draco’s breakfast and that he liked buying him tea because he hated the one Harry used to have? Did she know that Harry, over the past year, had learned little things about Draco? Things that not every
“Please not this game again,” Harry sighed but still showed his grin, feeling the heat of his cheek grow as a result of Luna’s brew.
He opened one of the cabinets where he knew Harry kept their tea. It was empty except for one bright orange cardboard box that read;
“Also, Harry…” He said, coming to his side, touching his shoulders softly. “I’m not going to stay for too long if that’s okay for you.”
personally know about alcoholic drinks. You could get them any drink, so why pissing me off like that?”
“Don’t fall asleep.” Draco nagged him as if he had read Harry’s mind. “And please, can you put your clothes on? I don’t want your friends to find you naked the day of your birthday.”
But that was just one day of the week. And for the rest of it, he would still snarl at his alarm, still, find it insufferable to wake up and floo to training. He hated having to make himself breakfast, having to clean the coffee pot, having to make himself presentable for the world.
If that first time had been better, Harry told himself, he would have never asked Malfoy for a second time.
“Bugger off!” Ginny was laughing terribly next to him, having trouble forming her next sentence. “So…your other two options to
“We’re here to help, Mione.” Harry softened. He would never understand the way Hermione panicked over little details, but the least he could do was help her load the weight on her shoulders. “What should we do?”
“I can tell.” Draco raised an eyebrow, “You didn’t even spend an hour at my birthday party last month.”
Both Harry and Hermione shifted their eyes to glaze over Ron, whose face was tinted in red from the alcohol and euphoria of the game, who was laughing in his characteristically
Draco continued his nagging, but Harry wasn’t really listening. He headed to his bathroom, through Draco's yelling, only to come out with a cheap-looking hair comb on his hand.
It was childish and absurd, and maybe even laughable, Harry knew. But there was something in it, something he liked about the whole situation. He was acting the way he always did during his Hogwarts days, and the memory brushed all over him, intoxicating.
ugly, you know I do. But love is not about that, I would like to think. I don’t think I would be dating Ron if I had made a list.”
Harry’s name on Mrs Malfoy sounded exactly like his name always sounded in Molly’s voice. Impregnated by motherhood and kindness. Harry let himself revelled in it.
“Wait,” Malfoy stopped him. Perhaps he was too drunk, but he sensed a tint of anxiousness in Malfoy’s voice. “Let me buy you a drink, please.”
“I do.” Draco groaned and placed both of his hands on Harry’s arse in an attempt to make him move further. “
As expected, Harry was the last one to arrive. But everyone in the room knew him too well to expect otherwise. Hermione and Ron were unpacking
“Don’t be sorry for honesty, Harry.” Narcissa soothed, “It’s an interesting confession. Especially because my Draco told me a different story in the past. That it was rather the
He was immediately interrupted by everyone in the room yelling, words interposing one on top of the other;
“Harry.” He corrected. He was tempted to stay there. To remain still till Draco finally called him by his name. But he was also torturing himself, and he was almost losing it, aching at the need.
Malfoy quoted quietly, still looking down, gazing at every corner. “That’s something my mother says.”
Draco let out a genuine laugh. Hermione could be too obtrusive, she could be a pain in the ass, constantly giving unsolicited advice…but
As it was pretty much expected since she was a teenager, Hermione was currently working to find herself a place at the Ministry of Magic. And she was doing a splendid job at it. After the war ended, Hermione got in contact with important figures from the inside. Everyone knew her. That she had always been at Harry’s side, just like Ron. She began working as an assistant with the hope of slowly making her way up the career ladder.
“You are a nightmare,” Draco repeated, voice hitched. But this time, as Harry began thrusting again, pushing in and out, he moaned louder. Allowing him to received his beautiful chanting,
This chapter is narrated from Draco’s POV! I thought it was nice to switch some things up and get a different perspective.
And then it was Malfoy’s birthday, and Hermione was invited, and Ron was invited, and Neville was also invited.
“You should,” Draco smiled him softly, and with his thumb, caressed the silver M on Harry’s. “But it’s fine. Looks nice on you.”
He felt dazed. Hypnotized to properly understand how everything moved. Somehow they managed to drag each other to the living room, Harry pushing Malfoy to the couch, stranding his body and pressing down.
“Harry, you arrived!” Blaise exclaimed, entering the room. He was holding a cardboard box with presumably a birthday cake on it. Then, with his signature grin said, “We didn’t want to start drinking without you!”
His heart felt heavy on his chest. His throat was building a lump that he couldn’t get rid of. Anguish flooding through his body. To have all this love to give, have this craving and need, and desire to give to someone and feel like it slipped through his fingers.
him. He could picture Draco surprised smile before quickly hiding it to make fun of him. The twinge down his stomach deepened.
Harry chuckled but complied, settling his hand on Draco’s inner thigh while the other still worked on his rim. The amount of lube on his arse was disgusting, but he couldn’t help moaned when Harry teased his index over his hole, pressing just a bit to make Draco ache with need.
It wasn’t that bad. It made him feel vulnerable, leaving the sessions with the sensation of exposure, but he hadn’t learned how to truly deal with his emotions yet, and Harry felt like he could.
“Did Rosie finally ask you out?” Ginny turned around, impregnating her flowery scent around Harry. “She has been staring at you all day!”
He wasn’t wrong. Three dates in a row with someone was an improvement. It had also been a surprise that Josie liked Harry. Especially after the fiasco of their first date, when Harry arrived late for tempting himself with Draco. She didn’t seem to mind that Harry wasn’t entirely there that night and had accepted a proper dinner the following week. And then the following. But still…
“You got a haircut.” He then said, with the same gaze Harry expected. Draco’s evident amazement showed in his grey eyes, looking at Harry’s hair intensely as if he was trying hard not to card his fingers through it. Harry felt a sudden burn in the back of his neck.
in India and how he was recently learning a lot about Herbology. Neville, big-hearted, recommended him books and shared his notes. And just like that, they began owling each other with book recommendations and who knew what else.
Rosie Warrington suited all those odd standards: a well-aspected Venus in her natal chart, always bought Acid Pops at Honeyduke’s, and she did not support the Tornados at all.
He dropped one of his hands down to jerk Harry’s right hand out of the way. He hated finishing too soon.
have gotten a fade. That would definitely make him have a long conversation with Draco and also astonishment in everyone’s gaze. But his hair, not fade needed, was still different. Curls falling neatly over his face, his green eyes not entirely covered by three months growth of hair. He looked…clean, tidy.
Harry was undoubtedly fit. He knew that. Auror Training had made one thing right of him; making his body built muscle the way he didn’t think he could. It wasn’t a drastic change, but a change nonetheless. His shirts started to grow tight, his appetite shifted, and…well, he looked
” Harry huffed, “I’m not going to yell at you because it’s your boyfriend’s birthday. You don’t deserve it
And then…the consequences. It was interesting, to be brutally honest. To say the first thing that comes to mind, feeling right for a split second, and then the next, you realized you might have crossed a line.
Harry and Ron both looked at each other instantly, trying to keep an unspoken conversation within them.
“So…let’s say Ginny suggests Justin Flint Fletcher. We make a list of what is okay about him and what things aren’t. Easy.”
says more about them than their career choices.” Dean tried one night. “So maybe if we find out their candy of choice, we could see if it works!”
If the situation had been different, he would have pay better attention to the surroundings; Draco’s room, Draco’s scent impregnated in every corner.
Harry looked around the room; even Luna was giggling from the corner. Neville was the only one that at least tried to hide his smile under his drink.
the rush thought came to Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to care because as soon as he began to recover from his orgasm, his body was pushing him down into sleep.
Maybe in between his begging, he understood Harry’s meaning behind it. Maybe he sensed his need, his desperation, his necessity of confessing love. Maybe it was all that or just the mere fact that Harry intruded in his house to have tea with his mother. The reason didn’t matter because, in the end, he nodded at Harry’s words and, grabbing his hands, took him to his bedroom.
“We’ll be fine,” Harry said from his couch, his naked back touching the leather, making him feel so warm that maybe if he closed his eyes just for a minute--
“Why, why, why?” Harry began muttering, feeling the embarrassment rushing through him, burning. “It is one of these things we pretend never happened!”
They took the floo and left Ginny and Harry alone. Ginny’s place was lovely, far away from the mess of the city, soothing noises filling the space around them. There was something charming about it, but Harry couldn’t deny his love for the city; he cherished the noise of busy streets, of people moving around him at all times. Here, everything felt extremely relaxing and
“Well, now that you mention the whole pros and cons list, I guess it’s because of that…I have too many cons.”
It was filled with boxes everywhere; Harry’s side of the job was out of order, while Draco’s was perfectly organized, making the cardboard boxes almost look like furniture.
