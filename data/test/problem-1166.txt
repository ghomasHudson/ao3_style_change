Harry swallowed hard. He’d spent too long himself trying to crack the secret to no avail. The only thing more hidden than Mysteries itself was the mysteries it kept from itself.
(A continuation of my Feb. 19th microfic, "empathy, unbidden")
“King Theodore Nasturtium,” said Harry.  "A fitting title."
Morning dawned across the surface of the tent and Draco blinked at the blinding brightness.  Outside, birds sang noisily, flitting across branches. The air was cool but not cold, like taking a minty breath, verdant and fresh.  Draco stretched, turning over on the small wooden bunk.  Harry was nowhere to be seen, but that wasn’t a surprise.
Harry had been wandering through the exhibit for most of an hour, and surely that was enough. He could remember the amulets and the sword, and something else, but he’d be able to tell Hermione about what else was on view.
Harry’s shadow danced in front of him, reaching for the doorknob.
“Forget about the work,” Draco murmured against Harry’s lips. “You want me.”
“I’m a good Auror, mate,” Weasley’s voice was getting louder and Draco could picture the red flush that would start right at Harry’s collar.
"Well," Draco started, feeling all together awkward. "It's not much, to be honest, the course is quite small. But, yes, I suppose, if Professor Potter might be willing to help organize transportation."
around them, though he could tell that they were chattering back and forth angrily. The taller of the two waved a hand at the Minister in anger.
Was the Mirror calling to him, or was it merely natural curiousity? The first time Harry visited the Tate Magique after the
“We’ve got all the time in the world,” Harry said, when he realized it, fingertip on Draco’s pinky toe. “I thought—” he started, and hesitated. He reached for the blunt and took a long drag, blowing the smoke out in a huff. “I thought I had to savour it.”
“I love you,” Draco shouts, speed and sun loosening his tongue.
“Good morning,” he said, when Harry opened his eyes to glower in his direction.
It was in the corner of Flourish and Blotts that he nearly walked straight into Harry Potter for the first time in nearly three years. Harry had nearly caught him shrinking down the compendium of socialist wizarding theory. If he had been a second slower, Harry might have noticed the twitch of his hand as he slid it carefully into his robes’ inner pocket. Maybe Harry
“In my fourteen years in a department I am not allowed to name, I have studied three emotions. I need not discuss fear today, nor guilt. Indeed, I have discovered far more about the sense of ‘joy’ in this man’s arms than anywhere else. May we keep discovering it together.”
They were near Calais, the sound of water rushing over the beach and the smell of bitter saltwater stinging his nose. Then Amsterdam, the noise of the city not unlike that rolling whiteness of the waves. A person with long brown hair looked them over, eyeing the way that Draco clung to Harry’s arms, unsure that he could hold himself up.
The bartender was quick, or maybe time wasn’t moving right.  Draco’s breath was on his throat, and he was talking about the music, but Harry wanted to kiss him so badly it hurt. If Draco didn’t take him home, Harry thought he might just lay on the floor of the club under the dancers’ feet for the rest of the night.
“Wait,” Harry said, sudden and desperate, voice wet with want. “Wait.”
Such blatant rudeness would not be tolerated for anyone but Potter. The one furthest to the left, who Draco had thought might be Weasley, broke from their formation, turning to Potter.
They didn’t stumble on their way back inside, falling into the old routine.
“The ocean,” Draco clarified. “Dive in and swim until there’s no boat or land in sight. Can you imagine how freeing that would feel?”
“We can dry these once they’re off.” There was the sound of wet fabric hitting the floor. Harry didn’t turn around, although the compulsion to do so gnawed at his neck.
noticed, but he never said. Draco passed him, nodding at the shopkeep and slipping out the door. He didn’t look back, and he never went back to the little shop on Diagon Alley.
that gave Draco pause. “You quit the Aurors.”
He’ll unspool the memory at wand-tip, letting it sink into the vial, viscous and bittersweet. He’ll press the cork in and that’ll be that. It won’t get rid of the memory, but it’ll feel a little lighter, like unpicking a knit blanket one stitch at a time.
, but all he could think of was the way Draco’s body rolled with the deck of the ship, fluid and easy.
Each year after, Draco repeated the question, ready for a ‘no’:
“You left me behind,” Harry said, finally, when the flowers stopped moving and the meander stopped twisting, and Draco sipped at his tea and watched him with cautious eyes. “I needed you, and you left me.”
The blinding sunlight streamed through the hatch behind the real Draco, tall and imposing, rough edges and as handsome as ever.
“July seventh,” he’ll say, “2007.”
"Fucking bond," Malfoy mutters under his breath, turning somehow even pinker.
Behind Harry, the triad of students seemed to swoon with glee.  Elena was sitting on top of the row of washing machines, one of which was overflowing dangerously with bright white suds. In the back corner, a pair of students still had not yet sorted out their coins, and a third was frantically hitting buttons.
“I get it. Separation. There’s work-Malfoy. And then there’s Draco when you’re in my bed.” Harry looked at him intently, even though Draco wouldn’t meet his gaze. “I’m okay with that separation if it means I still get some of you some of the time.”
Over the lid of the glass jar, eyes cast in inhuman orange, Draco was finally satisfied. The alchemical container was perfectly calibrated to hold fiendfyre. It would sit on their parlor shelf: a reminder and a threat. The unhappy fyre sparked dangerously, prodding at the lid, searching for a weakness.
She also tended to accidentally go off on tangents about something completely unrelated to the lesson plan. It was obvious that she adored Defence and even more obvious that she adored it in a practical and theoretical sense and academically. Tonks wanted to talk about the far-reaching implications of one tiny piece of defensive magical theory and then spend the lesson experimenting. She did not seem as happy to spend the lesson teaching them basics that she already knew back to front, even if they didn’t.
The tunnel twisted often, like a drainpipe, and felt rough against his skin. He kept his hands in the air as if he were on a muggle-rollercoaster. Remus had taken them all to a muggle theme park in the summer. Sirius had loved every minute. Neville had very much not.
It was an idyllic week, even if Neville spent half of it accidentally feeling like a burden. There was only so many times he could walk into a room containing Hermione, Ron and Harry and have them jump feet apart from each other without feeling like the cause.
Harry paused again. “It isn’t anything personal.”
Joni Mitchell sings from the record and in her minds eye Pandora Lovegood is singing it too.
Hermione had thought it was pretty weird that Harry had followed her into the second-floor girls’ bathroom after potions that day, but she’d just chalked it up to general Harry weirdness. He probably just wanted to catch up on all the school gossip with Myrtle.
could you have predicted that.”
Harry seemed equally happy to sit with her and talk about anything and everything, however. Instead of intensifying her crush, however, it cooled it slightly. Not because Harry had done anything wrong, but because it reminded her that Harry was still just a twelve-year-old boy, like her brother, even if he did seem older than that sometimes. He joked and talked and could get huffy sometimes, just like she could. And he loved quidditch almost as much as she did. It was hard to idolise someone when you’d spent three hours dissecting a Magpies v. Harpy game down to tiny details such as what socks Gwenogs was wearing and whether they were aero-dynamic. She started to think of him as just Harry, not Harry Potter-The-Saviour-of-The-Wizarding-World and her future husband.
Ron thought he heard Seamus mutter something along the lines of, “She’s not the only one too far gone—” But he was abruptly cut off by Dean’s elbow to his stomach, and Draco and Harry didn’t seem to hear anyway. Ron snorted, rolling his eyes.
Harry was going to apparate them.
Harry snorted from where he was camped in the chair by Draco’s bed, not looking up from a miscellaneous copy of Witch Weekly that he’d scrounged to read. “She’s got a point, Malfoy. I can’t believe you did it,
“Just casting some charms so no one sees us. Notice-me-not, muffliato, concealment charm…” Harry listed off distractedly, focused on his spell work.
I want to cry for this universe. I want to shed hot tears onto the scribbled tale of this life and watch the paper warp itself into waves. I want to watch them crash against their bindings and break free.
She’d caught a few mutterings here and there. Mostly they were curses that would make even her Cousin Monty, who’d worked on the oil rigs since age 18, blush. Then there were the odd phrases like ‘
Which Ron thought, on the whole was a pretty hypocritical thing to say to one’s best friend when ones best friend had seen the way one acted around certain snarky blondes.
“Don’t jinx yourself” Harry said mildly, as always unaffected by the sibling’s banter.
Harry shrugged “I heard she got a job at some prestigious university” A murmur of disgruntlement went through the crowd “Anyway with this group we’ll hopefully be able to pool our knowledge and resources and keep on track. Older students can help the younger students, classmates that understand the material can help those who don’t”
So, she began to notice a pattern in her own thoughts. Whenever Harry would do something odd or unexplainable (this occurred at least a dozen times before breakfast was even finished) she found her self thinking things like
But Luna kept her eye on Harry. She was certain she was the only one who saw him tug nervously on a thick golden chain around his neck.
“That’s okay” Ronald says weakly after no one else responds “Will you take him to Azkaban?”
“The shack?” Ron asked, standing up too and looking worried “The Shrieking shack?”
He wondered desperately, as he had before, why the fourth member of the odd quartet had not been allowed into the inner circle.
They both pushed the round stone door, but the fire pushed back. Neville could feel the heat of it on his palms, warming the stone rapidly. There was an inch of open space still unclosed. Tendrils of flame reached desperately through. Harry was chanting under his breathe.
who’s befriended him first. But Draco brought his own perspective on the wizarding world, and his own form of sarcastic humour as well. Draco didn’t complete them because they were already complete. He
Luna loses things often- her shoes, her belongings. Her herbology homework (especially when she doesn’t want to do it). She lost her mother.
“And get scared of pain we don’t.” Neville said softly.
“It’s your lucky day” Harry teased, letting Hermione gain back her balance by leaning on his shoulder “Little Hangleton it is. Come on”
“Anyway” Harry said pointedly, trying to get the conversation back on track “Will you do it?”
“We’re the perfect people for it.” Remus said, “Our kid’s at school, we don’t have full time jobs and we can live off of Sirius’ fortune for the next three lifetimes.”
Then Ron had a horrid thought about Harry and Hermione’s Looks that he’d never had before. Previously, when allowing himself a brief glimpse at his feelings, he'd chalked it up to secret plots and schemes he wasn’t privy too. At most, a super-secret nerdy book society. That seemed right up Harry and Hermione’s street.
Neville heard the footsteps too late. By the time he heard the turn of the doorknob and the muttered voice he had only managed to pick up his neat pile and stuff it back into the blueprint. When he turned around, he was still holding them.
“Why do you need to go there now?” Neville said, sharp. He thought that there were probably more pressing matters at hand than a thousand-year-old chamber.
His eyes glazed over. Like he was staring at something Hermione couldn’t see. Suddenly, he turned to her, a full-body grin overcoming him.
She couldn’t prove it, but she would stake a rather large bet on Harry’s involvement with the strange happenings that surrounded the professor’s lessons. Like the multiple times Quirrell had simply tripped over thin air, or the strange sudden gale-force wind that had flown through the classroom on their third lesson. It had sent the pages of everyone’s textbooks rifling, and many disgruntled classmates’ hats had been sent high into the air. Quirrell himself had had to clutch tightly to his turban to keep it in place. Harry acted disgruntled for a while after each of these incidents, before cheering up and moving on to what Hermione was sure was his next devilish scheme to destroy magical pedagogy as a whole.
“You think we should start a school newspaper?” Luna said.
When Harry joined him, his mood had only diminished somewhat.
Neville had never been quite sure how he became involved in their tightknit group of seven. He wasn’t really sure how Draco had ended up there, either. Death eaters’ kid as he was. Or strange Luna Lovegood. In fact, the only person who made any sense was Ginny, dragged along by her older brother.
“But she’s dead. The Lestrange family line is extinct,” Neville pointed out.
After they’d all hurriedly abandoned the burning tent it had been chaos. Spells were flying, and there were people flying too. Masked wizards on brooms were attacking form the sky, raining destructive curses down on the camp. Harry had taken one gaping look at the riot and let out a devastated
"Hey" Neville said suddenly into the deathly silence that surrounded them as they walked up to their floors as a group "Whatever happened with Buckbeak's trial?"
Harry grinned, moving forward and pushing down the handle on the door. They followed behind, Hermione still not entirely sure she believed Harry.
“Yeah. Poor Draco” Ron said, sighing. Arthur gave him a calculating look.
” Luna admitted.
Ginny blushed a little “Well, no I probably shouldn’t. Honestly, I wouldn’t go through with it” she squinted “Probably” Hermione snorted “But she have to let me come. Please”
“Yeah. But Defence isn’t exactly,” Ron frowned, as if searching for the right word. Lamely he finished. “Att
“What’s your ethical conundrum?” Luna said, wiping crumbs from her chin and licking her lips. Merlin she loved pumpkin pasties.
“Where are you getting this stuff from?” Dean said, chuckling, as he sketched Barry Blotter (who had curly black hair and glasses but definitely wasn’t Harry in anyway at all) hiding a baby dragon under his robes in a grand plot to sneak it to Romania. Puffs of smoke were trailing out of the collar and sleeves and singed holes appeared across the shirt. Barry’s loyal sidekicks Ermintrude and Rick were peeping out from around a corner, looking comically wide eyes with their own singe marks. It was an excellent drawing.
“God, you’re so insufferable. Merlin knows why I love you so much” Sirius said, scrubbing a hand over his wet eyes and took a fortifying breath “Do you remember after James and Lily got married? We were in our shitty Mile’s End flat, god it didn’t even have running water-”
Harry sighed deeply again, “I just love my life,” he said sarcastically.
“Now there better be no funny business between you and my sister.” Ron said, knocking Draco’s shoulder with his own and lazily trying to sound stern.
Harry was quiet for a long moment, before reaching over and taking Luna’s hand in his own.
Harry took his hand, pulling him along somewhere. Neville was suddenly aware that although he trusted Harry deeply, he didn’t fully trust Harry to be sane and make good choices.
“Come forward for a picture, my boy” Lockhart said jovially, undaunted by Harry’s reluctance.
Ron snorted out pumpkin juice, “You were meant to go to Durmstrang? Seriously?”
“Shut up will you, you great mutt.” There was a jostle in the flames, as if Remus had shouldered Sirius, who broke into laughter and stopped singing T-Rex.
“Where would you be without Hermione?” Neville asked, opening the bag with curiosity.
He had found a plant called Dolus Seed which had been known to withstand a version of a fool’s downfall (a common safety measure across the wizarding world) in Germany. Dolus seed tricked other’s into seeing you when you weren’t there and could be powdered and thrown into the eyes of security guards so that they saw you in front of them even when you weren’t there.
He watched the altar. He noticed, with an alarming jolt, that Harry looked rather dashing where he stood. Neville bemoaned what good presentation could do to otherwise unknown quantities.
“Oh, merlin.” Ron said, staring down at the corpse on front of them.
Luna nodded, and Ginny unrolled the parchment. She must have only read the first few words when her face softened into a gentle smile “Oh, listen to this, guys,
They both seemed to remember the Headmaster at the same time and turned back to look at him. The old man was staring off into the distance looking baffled. For the first time since Hermione had met the ineffable magician, he actually seemed to appear fallible. As if something he believed in as strongly as gravity had been disproven.
Ron huffed one final time to emphasise that he had not entirely stopped having a paddy-fit. Draco rolled his eyes.
He seemed pretty nervous about admitting this, as if he had broken some intense code of Herbology ethics. This was probably a reasonable reaction as Ron immediately whooped and declared they were going to the greenhouses.
Harry shot another blasting charm at the tree. It came away only lightly scorched. Either Harry wasn’t putting his full power behind the curse, which in his rage didn’t seem likely, or Dumbledore had had the foresight to charm all the trees for this very reason. Teenage angst could be environmentally damaging.
Draco looked uneasy. He was British and exceedingly posh and also an only child and that was a combination that led to an iron inclination to never acknowledge difficult situations ever,
exaggerated.
“Are you going to rough me up for information, Hermione Granger?” Harry said, Joking nervously. He pushed his hair back from his forehead, but it just flopped back down into his eyes anyway.
Ron and Harry both groaned, but Draco and Ginny made affirmative noises.
“Why does everyone care so much?” Ginny huffed, plopping herself down in between the roots of a gnarled tree.
Ron grinned, gripping Hermione’s hand out of excitement. Hermione knew that Harry had told Ron some about his fraught home life.
She had a few favourites already. First had been the dog-eared copy paperback of
“What did you use it for?” Hermione asked, looking impressed.
Now Luna, the only one still sitting down apart from Neville, was interested. She walked over and picked up the map from the floor. It was a detailed map of Hogwarts and its grounds with labelled footsteps trailing all across it. The grounds were sparse with names, so she quickly spotted the name that had made Harry react like this.
Neville Happily worked with Professor Sprout to create a “Fun Herbology Facts!” two-page spread which proved surprisingly popular.
Three days before Christmas break (wherein Harry and Ron would be staying at her house due to Harry’s suggestion. Draco had been invited but had been forced to decline for obvious reasons) her DADA teacher was proven to be a death eater.
She loved finding these mementos of lives she hadn’t lived, feelings she could never fully understand. Luna sometimes began to think that she was the only real person in the world. She was afraid that every time she blinked her eyes everyone else stopped existing. That every time she left a room it became empty.
Hermione had only seen that movie once, but she nodded anyway for him to go in.
He wasn’t like she’d imagined. His skin was a dark tan, and his hair was black and unkempt, waves and curls and straight pieces of hair sticking up in every direction. In the photo he kept flinging an arm around Ron and then shoving a hand back through his hair to keep it from being blown about by the wind. When he did that you could see his scar, golden-red against his forehead. His glasses were round and crooked and unflattering. He was the shortest person in the photograph. He was grinning blindly, and near the end of the captured loop he would laugh at something the pointy blonde boy at the end of the row said and throw his head back. She watched the picture over and over when she did the washing up and had it almost memorised. Arm flung around Ron, hair pushed back, raucous laugh. Then again and again on repeat.
“I don’t lie” Harry spat.
He laughed suddenly, “It’s worked! It didn’t hurt her. Here, look.” Before Neville could do a thing Harry had ripped Neville’s blindfold down under his nose.
and had had to make a mad dash for the train lavatories.
“But you’d be the youngest professor in a hundred and fifty years.” Hermione said, voice impressed.
She took great joy in clapping for all her new friends. Draco, who went slightly pink faced, slightly prideful, to Ravenclaw. He gave her an embarrassed nod in acknowledgement of her spirited clapping. She was one of the only ones from her table clapping. A red head with Ron’s forehead and chin looked at her in confusion and said, “You do know that’s a Malfoy, Right?”
“Who taught you? Dumbledore?”
Luna watched Hermione and Harry exchange one of their patented Shared Looks and she laughed to herself, prepared for whatever crazy answer they were going to give.
with 12 exclamation points afterwards. Suffice to say Ginny’s crush on Harry was definitely on the decline.
“I have no idea why they keep those severed heads up on the wall, though” Draco said, cutting through the tender moment.
“Is this really necessary?” He said, defeated.
He did. He took one finally awed look at the roiling menagerie of flames and then he turned on his heels and ran, puling a distraught Harry along.
Harry laughed, shrugging, “I was terrible at it. Never tried. But when I woke up here, I put a lot of effort into actually practising what I was taught. I don’t need anyone seeing inside my head.”
The dragon kisses Harry Potter under the stars his family stole. The dog star, the heart of the lion. You can see every awful blazing sun from Scotland. He knocks the boys glasses off for better access and the boy does not demand back his vision of the stars. The dragon is all he needs. The only thing he wants. Harry Potter will love Draco Malfoy with his dying breathe.
Hermione, dentist’s daughter as she was, had failed at hiding her disapproval of the avalanche of food Harry bought from the Trolley. She warmed to the occasion, however, when Harry implored her to treat it as if it were a scientific investigation. Ron seemed happy to answer her endless questions about wizarding confectionary, cooking, and, because she was Hermione, dentistry. That was until he had the misfortune to chew a vomit Every-flavour-jellybean (“Every flavour? Surely it can’t mean every flavour
Harry snorted, knocking his shoulder into Ron’s jovially “You’re the best, mate.”
So no one could blame her for eavesdropping. After all it was her mum who kept insisting that Ginny’s self-consciousness was a natural part of puberty. She also kept insisting that Ginny’s penchant for mid-morning, mid-afternoon and late evening snacks was due to her being a ‘growing girl’ but Ginny was pretty sure it was just because she really liked food.
“Harry,” Neville said, but his voice was a croak. His throat was all taken up by his heart—no room to scream for Harry to run, to stop it, to get away you beautiful fucking idiot.
“She’s only been in office a few months” Ron said. Luna wondered if Ron had just never developed a sense of self preservation, or if he really just enjoyed riling Hermione up at 8 AM when she was her most volatile. And over politics of all things.
The plan came together in increments. With Hermione practically abusing Kreacher with the amount of times she asked him politely to discreetly bring her more tea.
Harry shook his head. “
Harry grinned in victory, pulling out a slim and plain muggle notebook. He plopped it onto his earlier abandoned tome, sending a mushroom cloud of decades old dust into the air once again.
“Peter Pettigrew.” Harry said calmly. Dumbledore’s eyebrows shot up so high she was sure for a moment they would merge with his hairline. He clearly recognised the name.
“Oh, shush.” Sirius laughed “Well we went back to yours after the wedding and we were both a bit drunk and then you got down on one knee-“
thanks if you still continue this!
Luna enjoyed the banal routines that took place in Grimmauld; Sitting at the kitchen table while Remus made hot chocolate on the stove; Playing card games in the dining room in the evening; Getting ready for bed beside Hermione; The chaotic rush of meal prep.
. What if she eats people?”
Correction; Ron Weasley didn’t seem to have ever laid eyes on the boy in his life. Harry on the other hand looked and acted as if he had known the boy forever but kept up a flimsy persona of a cheery stranger excited to make new friends.
A moment later a clear voice rang out in a screech, “Fred Gideon Weasley what are you doing?”
The newspaper met them sombrely on Tuesday morning, the first day of class after Christmas break. It did not at all seem an appropriate end to their rather lovely yule tide and near year celebrations.
“Never said you couldn’t” Remus said with an imperious smirk.
“Draco,” Harry said, voice heavy with something like honey, and Draco met his gaze, Draco’s eyes wide. “I mean that. I’d find you anywhere. The way I know you,” he bit his lower lip and Draco’s eyes dropped to it, then back to his eyes. “I know you deeply.”
Draco forgot how to breathe. He stared at the curve of Harry’s ear and thought about how
Draco wrote a note in the margin, circling a line of text Harry couldn’t read. Harry leaned across the table, straining his eyes, but the words didn’t seem like real words. This close, he could smell Draco’s tea, rich and black, the same scent that always lingered in Draco’s flat.
"Oh, fuck.” Draco rolled off Harry, landing spread-eagle on the bed, sweat pooling at his sternum.
There was a noise behind his left shoulder. Harry did not flinch; Aurors were meant to be unwavering. He turned his head slowly. His shadow was behind him now, though the lights didn’t change.
“You saw me too.”
“—you’re a good Chaser, alright? You were right,” Draco gasped, “I shouldn’t have —
Harry blinked. He was alone again. Or had he ever stopped?
“Right,” Draco breathed, imagining the front page of the
“Wait,” she said, as he turned to Disapparate. Something in her voice, something desperate compelled him to pause, but only to pause. “Please,” she said, voice pitchy and oddly American in accent. Draco stared at her hand until she lifted it from his arm in a gesture of peace. He could go now, pop into another country without her following. He
“I have,” Harry grinned, and kissed the breath out of him. “I played very well, didn’t I?” he mused, as he kissed Draco’s collarbone, scraping teeth and raising gooseflesh. “Got in past Wood
He could do that.
Three days later, Draco’s face was plastered on every corner, bitter and angry, with the label of “Anarchist - Violent Threat” beneath. There was a reward for him, apparently. Draco started sleeping on various couches, carrying a mobile brewer with him so he could keep the first batch of Polyjuice going.
“We are here to protect you,” the Minister went on, and again, the Auror forces seemed to glimmer with something more divine than human, some cruel extra magic about them. Draco looked back at the pair of women, but they had disappeared into the crowd, any sign of their flashing little pens lost amid the cheering crowd.
It stepped towards him, palms open.
“You need to go get checked out,” Draco says, nodding towards the nurse’s station behind the door, which is bustling with mediwix and potions carts and noise. “Let me take care of him.”
Was it his imagination running wild? Was the unreality of the Mirror becoming stronger? He moved with Malfoy just as Mirror-Harry moved, unable to stop flipping between the Draco in the Mirror and the Malfoy in his arms — or were they the same man? Was the touch under his fingertips, warm and firm and confident, all in his head, all in his sight?
So Harry said, “I’m here,” like a promise, like everything they weren’t saying.  “Show me.”
“Marries a Death Eater,” Draco added, with an aggressive rub to Harry’s heel.
“I’m not bloody well going to forget that,” Weasley spat, too angry, his hand twitching towards his wand. Harry’s eyes slid from Weasley’s face to Draco’s, resolved. Draco reached for him, and Harry stepped towards Weasley, hesitating as he waited for the anger to fade just enough.
The fourth time, Harry really did see Draco. There was a little coffee shop off the beaten path, tucked far in the corner of Horizont Alley and only discoverable if you knew the right sorts of people.
tucked up under his arm.
Harry reeled backward, breathing too fast. Was there enough air in here? The room tasted stale, like all the books were breathing too and there wasn’t enough left for him.
“I won’t,” he’ll say again. “I gave him every trace of love I had. I don’t have any left without him.”
Though he was most certainly not supposed to be listening, Draco was pressed nearly flush up against the wooden door, anxiety thrilling through him. They were in the small flat in Camden, a share that Ron Weasley kept with Hermione Granger. Draco and Harry were only meant to be in the city for a night, but Harry had insisted on one more chance. The work would continue there, even louder than they could manage on the surface, but the Ministry was cracking down.
“—everything,” Draco shouted. The rain was so thick between them, Harry could hardly see Draco through it. “We have everything,” Draco said again, and grabbed Harry’s sleeve. He dragged Harry down the hatch, stumbling into each other as they slipped down the small steps.
“I think I could find you in whatever body,” Harry said quietly. “I’d know you with any face.”
and knew their borrowed time had run out. “We’ll do a chain of them,” he said quickly, “hold onto me. I’ll go, then you, and back. At least—” another
“Good,” Draco purred in his ear. They were in it together. “You’re doing so good. Cast for me, Harry.”
This time, he noticed the little label propped up beside it, black text on bright white. The words swam before his eyes and he ignored it. Harry knew the Mirror far better than any curator spouting history to the waiting masses.
, didn’t I?”
“Must we go back?” he asked, hoping the quiet noise of the ocean would drown it out.
“I’m going in the water,” Harry snapped. He was angry for no good reason, that same bite of over-emotion that reminded him too palpably of Riddle in his head. “You can join me, but if you don’t want to see me naked, you should find somewhere else to sit.”
Harry sat up.
And so here they were: Draco pressed against the wood, listening to Weasley and Harry fighting with an awful bitterness. He couldn’t see inside the bedroom that Weasley had dragged Harry to when he saw that Draco was his company. Weasley had cast
“Do you think we’ll see the ghost tonight?” Harry asked.
The words came too fast. “Like you.”
against skin. Not to mention the very fact of his being Harry Potter. “You don’t need luck,” Draco said, the last breath of smoke drifting from his mouth as he spoke.
, that was this feeling. “Do we have a new supplier, then?” Draco tried to infuse his voice with some energy, though there was little to be found to spare.
op ed—”
“I can feel everything,” Harry said of the empathy hex. He lay on his back in the isolation cell.
“Everything?”
Were I the woman I used to be, I might have barged in and sent my tongue flying with words sharper than curses.  I was not her anymore.
“What would
Luna smiled brightly “Ginny does.” and Ginny blushed profusely.
The creature preened slightly. It was a very strange thing to witness.
And it was a corpse. Decayed. But unmistakable.
“Oh, shut up” Hermione hissed, scowling.
And if they hadn’t been so caught up in blushing at each other they may have noticed that none of their friends whooped or giggled at them, but instead shared happy smiles, even of those smiles were tinged with the faintest amount of exasperation.
They were at breakfast when Neville got the news. He felt his heart stop in his chest, felt it beat violently against his ribs the moment after. His throat felt suddenly too prevalent in his body, shrivelling up and expanding at the same time.
“I’ll go first” Luna said, crossing her ankles and sitting up straight “Hm. Neville? Truth or dare?”
“Uh huh,” Hermione said with a high pitch, nodding frantically, the they all sped past Neville, as if he were an errant rock diverting their stream in two.
“Editor in Chief” Luna corrected despite herself “Why can’t you do it? You’re more well known than me anyway. Everyone thinks I’m loony”
“You have to tell me what we’re getting. And where from,” Neville said firmly.
eavesdropping on her mum’s conversation. This is not a regular occurrence, she promises.
in question had called the other man ‘Si’ and so that was what Ginny was calling them in her head.
Draco sat down in the other chair and stared in trepidation at the turntable. “How do you get it to play music?”
“Here” Hermione said, passing the iron tongs to Harry and opening the latch of the box “Be careful”
Ginny Weasley had decided she was in love with Harry Potter the first time she’d heard the Story. Harry Potter had saved the wizarding world at only 18 months. Harry had defeated you-know-who and had been given a lightning scar for his troubles. Ginny had asked her mother what Harry Potter looked like she had been told that no one knew because he wasn’t ever in the public eye, but she had told Ginny what his parents looked like, who Molly had met at a myriad of wizarding social events when she had been a young woman with only a few children, instead of a quidditch team of them. When Ginny thought of Harry potter she had thought of a boy with caramel-brown skin and red hair just like hers.
“He said it should have a middle-aged name because only middle-aged people should be driving it” Professor Lupin had said with a voice full of equal parts exasperation and humour.
“Malfoy!” He said, surprise evident in his face. Then it seemed to drain suddenly of all colour. “Er…nice to see you… since we last saw each other… at …. Madam Malkin’s?”
“How is that, anyway?” Ginny wondered aloud, sending Harry a pointed look.
They were outside by the lake, tightly wrapped in scarves and hats due to the icy weather- because Ginny had insisted that she had a surprise for them all. But she’d led Luna down a whole half-an-hour earler than she’d told the others to gather.
From where?
“I’m channelling Marc Bolan.” Sirius said, grinning
Ginny huffed “Whatever” She turned around and went back to stare at the notice bored.
“This is one of
Harry was silent, too. Over the silenced was superimposed the crunch of chicken bones. “I don’t know” Harry said softly, sounding sad “I wish I could set her free, but…”
“Why are we sneaking about again?” Ron muttered, following harry down the stairs. Ron noticed that his pyjamas were several inches too short, ankles on full display.
“How did you stop it?” Ron asked, gesturing lightly at his own forehead. "The sharing heads thing."
“How long's left?” Harry asked, crowding unnecessarily, Ron thought, into Draco’s space to see his watch.
. We need to be prepared. The younger students especially.” He looked at Harry, “It will come for them too. It’s horrible, but we can’t pretend we’re all normal students anymore.”
“It’s okay” Luna said simply “I don’t need anyone else”
“Of course.” Ron repeated pompously.
spell. The first spell her mother ever got patented. Luna had been pleased to notice that no one had ever stuck anything else over it.
Ron glanced at Harry with worry. Dad sighed and shook his head, “You’re right of course but—”
would be a nightmare.”
“Er,” Ron took the bundled scarf. It unravelled to be about two feet long, “Thank you.”
“Harry” Ginny said, something occurring to her “How on earth to we get back up that tunnel”
Everyone snorted at the question and Neville blushed. “Merlin, Luna. Hm…” He paused. “There….
“Oh, mon deus, you must owl me to Hermione.” Her voice lilted when she said Hermione’s voice, as if she was purposefully trying to pronounce it the English way. It was a terribly thoughtful thing for her to do. “All you marvellous women. I will be here next year, if Dumbledore agrees.”
“I don’t see why we can’t just tell Draco.” Ron muttered, stuffing a pillow harshly into the floor. He was in a foul mood because he’d spent that morning getting successive questions wrong on Hermione’s transfiguration flash cards.
Tonks’ ability to completely throw the lesson plan and syllabus out of the window on a whim was perfectly represented in what happened when Fleur Delacour knocked on the door a few minutes into their lesson one day in November.
“So, what? Harry’s just going to teach us all defence? He’s only a second year” Ginny pointed out.
They watched something called Star Wars, and then laughed as Fred and George re-enacted all of their favourite scenes.
Ron had scribbled a short cartoon entitled, 'The adventures of Padfoot and Professor Puppy' featuring a puppy sized werewolf Remus to send Sirius for his birthday.
Ron didn’t have any words for his best friend. He couldn’t imagine the pain he was feeling, and he couldn’t make the boy share the burden with him. That wasn’t Harry’s way. Harry carried burdens until the weight of it killed him. Then he only asked for more. More weight, like that guy in the Salem Witch trials. More weight.
“Alright,” Neville said, when they said nothing else, “See you later?”
“It could have” She said, top live quivering in a way that made her hate herself just a little bit.
_______________________
Finally, it was just Hermione they were waiting for. Ron frowned with worry “Is she alright?” He asked, directing his question at Lavender.
Hermione bit her lip, “Who’s Sirius Black? What do people think he did?”
“She will not accept another random adventure under ‘no explanation’,” Harry said, face in hands.
Neville nodded, touched by the thought and as always deeply uncomfortable at the idea of anyone going out of their way for him. He didn’t comment, though, not wanting to open up the opportunity for Ginny to ask how he was.
“You’re my godfathers” Harry said, a note of stubbornness in his voice.
So easily everything could have been different. She could have been all alone- Loony Lovegood and her no-friends. Now she was Loony Lovegood and her no-good friends. A rat-pack always in trouble, always together.
The twins were the ones who made the greatest impression. Fred and George were constantly roping Neville into their experiments.
“They don’t charm it. They use technology” Luna said, plopping down on the right-hand chair and leaning forward to flick through the records. All the ones she remembered her mother having. Luna felt comfort swell in her chest like a balloon, pushing out everything else.
“Isn’t that your friend?”
“Where’s mum?” Fred or George said, frowning.
“Yeah there’s a tunnel from the shack to the Whomping Willow” Hermione said hurriedly as if this was common knowledge.
“Oh, come on!” Ginny cried, smiling incredulously.
The snake and Harry hissed at each other for a bit more. Neville noticed that the snakes hissing was getting louder.
Ginny wrote down what she had heard, then drew lines coming off things and added her thoughts. By the end of this she had a web of confusion and suspicion. She frowned down at the messy page, then put it with her other pieces of evidence.
Harry had started the DA again in September, but with a difference. The whole school had witnessed a miracle; for the first time in recent memory Hogwarts had a competent Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Professor Lupin was entertaining, clever and kind. He seemed unequally qualified for teaching. Plus, to the third years delight he enjoyed to jovially tease Harry. To which Harry responded with embarrassing stories about Professor Lupin and Sirius Black.
When he was out of sight Luna swung her legs back around and lay back down. But she didn’t go back to napping. She just stared at the sky and thought.
The fourth year DADA class had seen Tonks accidentally start and hastily put out four fires. It was only the first week of November.
Finding out what in Morgana’s name was going on.
“We didn’t tell him,” Sirius said, looking like he enjoyed this a bit too much.
A week after Halloween is when the crystallised sugar castle of friendships and joy melts around Luna’s feet dismally. Peter Pettigrew breaks into Hogwarts.
She’d honestly thought that things had gotten better after she was at Hogwarts too. Maybe they had finally opened their eyes and seen her for who she was not who they had decided she was. Fred and George trusted her by letting her sit in on their planning; Ron would talk to her about his actually problems; Percy had stopped talking to her like she was still two years old. But of course, they would still just see her as a little girl. Useless Ginny. Just go back into the kitchen and help mum out, why don’t you?
When she finally reached the bottom, she fell to the floor with an unpleasant crunch. She had landed on bones. Hundreds and hundreds of animal bones- small like rats or mice. She winced and scrambled her way up and off them.
The second time he had brought Hermione with him, and the time spent in the actual vault had been much shorter. He’d simply replaced what he’d taken out the first time (an ugly ring) and waltzed back out. It wasn’t about the lower falls anymore. No, this time they had been staking out the walls.
Hermione hissed something back at Harry, but she couldn’t catch it. They continued their whispered conversation for a while, only stopping when a house elf came over to give them some biscuits. Hermione thanked him profusely and then turned back to Harry frowning.
“I’m sorry.” Harry said, looking tortured.
Though he wouldn’t hedge his bets completely.
At Harry’s tortured expression, Rn had been forced into another round of wracking hoots.
But how had he made it back to the Gryffindors? Hermione’s kindness? Harry’s oddity?
“Why the hell did you do that for?” Harry cried, now starting to look unhinged in frustration.
“Yes, I could!” Harry yelled, eyes wild and wide, “That’s the whole point. I know. I know what’s trying to happen here, every day. And every day I’m trying to push it down. Stop Voldemort coming back. Keep everyone alive.” His voice croaked n that last word. “And what for? I keep one person safe and another one dies. It’s cosmic fucking whack-a-mole, Ron. How do I do this? How the hell do I keep doing this?”
Draco looked pleased “Well, yes. It was good. Harry’s godfathers are absolutely insane, of course”
“You haven’t gotten to it yet” Lupin said ruefully.
“I get it,” Ginny said, nodding in thought.
“No one ever treats me normal. They act like at any moment I’m liable to break something, or explode, or say something dumb,” Neville shrugged, “You don’t.”
die.”
“You never know.” Tonks said with a grin, “I’ve heard rumours.”
Harry gaped and Hermione threw her hands up into the air “You are the worst secret keeper Harry Potter. How on earth does she know about that stupid chamber?”
On the day that Harry Potter finally arrived at the Burrow- on the 23
He still had pretty eyes, though.
Now, Ginny was not one to police other peoples gender expression, but she could smell ‘suspicious behaviour’ a mile off. Harry Potter was being Suspicious. Ginny speed walked her way after him.
“Did Sirius teach you occlumency?” The headmaster asked. Neville frowned at the odd subject change.
“All in favour?” A sixth year Ravenclaw muggleborn named Amanda asked the room.
“I know,” Harry said coldly, “The prophecy. It’s useless.”
“I’m leaning towards yes,” Harry said, with the same academic voice, “But one must exhaust all possibilities.”
For the first time since hearing Harry’s tales, Ron felt a genuine fear crackle down his spine.
“If you need help shouldn’t we wait for Draco to be here too?” Ron said in confusion.
“We did take something” Harry said slowly, and Ginny’s stomach flipped with vindication “But it wasn’t yours” She frowned, and Harry hurried on “Lucius Malfoy slipped a book into your cauldron that day in the bookshop. Hermione noticed, and then we took it and had Dumbledore check it out. It was cursed”
“I can do anything I want” She says “Plus if you don’t let me come, I’ll tell everyone about that chamber and the snake”
“Our teacher?” Ron exclaimed. She sent her grin his way, now. He felt his knees wobble.
“You would think that would make her hate muggles more.” Neville said, who had been frankly baffled by that movie.
Fleur Delacour became the Triwizard champion, beating Diggory even though Diggory had reached the cup moments before her. Her joint points and spellmanship won her it in the end.
“Thank you for getting him” Auror Tonks says to their group, smiling awkwardly despite the tension.
Sometimes it was the right thing to do. And good and right, bad and wrong weren't two sides of a dividing line. They were jumbled. The unquantifiable fading moment between dark and dawn. Odd socks mixed up in a washing basket, never to match correctly again because one of the pair was inevitably lost down the back of something.
Neville shrugged, frowning lightly, “Isn’t that just something that people know?”
They both watched for a long moment, though they couldn’t hear anything. Then Tonks shifted ever so lightly to the left. And there on the ground in front of the gates-
“Well,” Harry wheedled, “There’s Ginny.”
“Who is this guy?”
“All hail the almighty Defence curse” Fred said.
“Something imbued with Basilisk venom,” Harry sighed, looking shifty, “And. And Fiendfyre.”
“We can’t tell you in front of
secret passage way. She couldn’t see where it came out, and that gave her pause. But she also couldn’t see Harry Potter and that meant that Harry Potter was down that secret passageway.
Harry and Hermione both burst in to giggles, while Ron made a face. Ginny couldn’t help smiling a little too.
Another romance. The same boy, but this time sporting blue. He likes to tell Harry Potter he is stupid before kissing him. Harry Potter makes the first move. All that bravery boiling over and pushing him forward. Bravery gets him killed.
“She did.” Harry shrugged. “But I have a plan.”
“You know me in the future?” Hermione exclaimed, thoughts scattered in a thousand directions.
Ron rolled his eyes, getting to his feet. “Never mind. You’re clueless.”
“No,” Harrys aid fiercely, “She won’t die. She—” He stopped himself. “No one will die.”
“I can’t believe how calm this whole thing has been.” Harry said with disbelief as the sat in the stands surrounding he maze.
“It’s okay,” Ron said. “We have a plan for that, remember?”
______________________
“What does it--?”
“Blindfolds,” Harry said, reaching in to take a pink strip of cloth. “I used to use muggle eye-masks, but Ginny brought me a load of these that she got off her mum. Scarp fabric, I’m guessing,”
Fleur did this with the slow swing of the classroom door inwards and a lyrical trill of, “Come in!”
“Yep.” Ron said with a sigh. “That’ll be Harry.”
They’d given her thick soled shoes and padded her hips and (Neville blushed at the thought) breasts. She was wearing clothes Hermione wouldn’t be caught dead in.
That was the first time anyone ever referred at Hermione Granger as someone who might be good at having friends. She wasn’t a seer herself, but she had a hopeful feeling that it wouldn’t be the last.
“All I remember about my parents is a green light” Harry said quietly “There are lost of things I know, but that’s the only thing I actually remember”
Ginny was forced to peer out of the window, and she could hear Colin craning his neck and jumping behind her, trying to see too. The second-floor window faced the east side of the lake where the shore was rocky and dotted about with bigger stones and spindly trees. Ginny’s eyes skimmed the scene, frustrated.
Two adults appeared then, having walked towards them at a far more sedate pace. The woman had her hair in multiple small delicate braids, which she in turn had tied neatly behind her head. The man was tall and balding. They both wore spectacles and had a kind, though slightly baffled, expression.
She would need to do further intensive investigation.
“Neither of them.” Harry said with a shudder. “Hermione is like a sister to me. That’s like you saying you were dating Ginny.”
“I’ll take that as a compliment.” Hermione said with a sniff.
“That’s- Well that’s actually brilliant, Sirius. Thank you” Hermione said, voice slightly choked.
They stayed silent for a while after that, two boys whose families had been torn apart by a war they were too young to remember. Harry thinking of green eyes and a kind man casting lights into the air to make a baby laugh. Neville thinking of sweet wrappers and stories of intense bravery and competence he could never hop to replicate.
Harry started towards one of the sinks and began to hiss under his breathe. Neville reflected that living boys could be pretty damn weird too.
She hated him. She did. But also, there was a very large part of her that didn’t. And a not-small-enough part of her that was rather enjoying the thrilling butterflies she was getting already. She couldn’t shake the possibility that they might actually find a lost magical artefact. After all, unexplainable things happened around Harry Potter all the time.
“Only to go down there,” Myrtle pouted, looking at the sinks jealously.
Had they been in there before they left for the ‘kitchens’, if that’s where they truly went?
“I say I have a special connection with you-know-who because of this.” Harry said softly, tapping his scar.
“Luna could come too” Ginny said, blushing slightly still because Harry had been nice to her.
Harry had continued his crusade against Quirrell and his odd behaviour around Snape. So far he had missed approx. 20% of their potions lessons. Plus, Quirrell’s turban always ended their lessons slightly worse for wear after Harry’s escapades. She was seriously going to have to have a conversation with him about sensitivity training.
“You think you’ll tell them about, you know, the other place?” Ron said softly, as he sat in a stuffed armchair and harry began to stoke the dying fire.
That had to mean something right?
Behind her mother in the hallway were two men, obviously wizards even in their muggle dress. One was tall, sandy haired and worn looking. He smiled kindly up at the three of him. The man in front of him was thin, with chopped black scraggly hair to his chin and an attire consisting of all black. He was looking at Harry like he was the son.
“My godfather.” Harry said distractedly, and before either of them could parse this he was striding towards the door. “Come on.”
“Well,” Harry’s voice was a bark, “Not this time.” Neville heard footsteps and started to back away. “I have to go. Nice talk, Professor.”
Neville had been placed on disguise duty, while Harry focused on protective charms, Ron on strategy and Hermione fluttered madly between them all with biting critique and organisation.
“I only meant to ask, you see, in Beuaxbatons we do not do this spell? Er, I think it is the Surgito spell?”
He tore his gaze away from the carpet and looked at her, puzzled. Then he shrugged “What did you have in mind?”
The doorknob wouldn’t budge. He frowned at it. Then, he pulled his wand out. In for a sickle, in for a galleon. He was a Gryffindor after all. Son of two war heroes.
“Oh, my Merin, I’d forgotten. You know we spent our first four Christmases at Hogwarts the last time round?” He said, tugging Ron’s sleeve excitedly.
“Here,” Neville said, looking in despair at the dusty knees of Ron’s robes, “My Gran had me pack two pairs.”
“Of course.” Ron said in commiseration.
“Pansy’s being pretty neutral in the paper.” Hermione pointed out.
The two began to cast charms, Hermione out loud and Harry silently. She raised her eyebrows at that, not only could Harry successfully apparate but he could apparently cast non-verbally too.
Colin rushed forward and clicked rapidly. Luna giggled next to Ginny, who was bouncing on her toes with excitement.
Below it was a sign-up sheet sprawled with names. She could see all of her brothers had signed up, as well as a good quantity of the upper years.
fucking magic.”
The evening of her birthday was celebrated quietly. The Weasley’s always celebrated birthday’s in the same way; mismatched tables lined up in the yard, a magically extended gingham table cloth, mountains of food and a cake- specialised to each child. Never two the same, as if Molly had made herself a promise. All of the Weasley children had birthdays that fell in warmer months, apart from the two eldest who’s birthdays where only two weeks apart in the last two months of the year. On Bill and Charlie’s birthdays the whole family would eat outside, equipped with Molly-made hats and scarves, sheltered under a canopy of warming spells.
When she came out of the bathroom in fresh pyjamas and a towel-turban, she headed one floor up to her room. She and Percy had rooms next to each other on this floor, with Charlie’s old room opposite them. Her mother still kept Charlie’s room set up for the irregular times he would come back from Romania to stay for a few days at a time. Ginny sometimes sat in her brothers’ room when she missed him or when she wanted to be alone. It was covered in pictures of dragons, and of snapshots of Charlie and his best friend Tonks with her ever changing hair. It constantly smelled slightly of smoke and the smell always had the instant effect of calming her down.
“The one with all the weird lists, you know” Ginny said, losing steam slightly “
ior.”
Lockhart looked a little caught off-guard, as if he couldn’t imagine anyone not wanting to be front page news. Then his blinding smile was back “Shy, isn’t he?” He said, addressing the crowd as if he was in a play “When young, shy, Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts—”
The name
“It’s just normal stuff,” Neville said, frowning. Harry shook his head.
The opened door revealed a long, dusty corridor. The décor seemed to have been chosen to specifically scream
The Professor himself seemed to take account of this odd situation “Not in the running away mood today, Potter? You know It doesn’t count as catching up on your missed time if you dawdle about.” he sneered.
Ron rolled his eyes, “How certain can you be of that?”
Ron suppressed his natural wince at the name, instead shaking his head thoughtfully “Maybe you’re right. We can look into dark rituals and see what fits the pattern. But, Harry,” He came to stand in front of his best friend, placing his hands-on Harry’s shoulders and staring the shorter boy in his eyes, “You cannot blame yourself. You don’t know everything. You
Then he’d turned on his feet and with ungodly speed made his way into the dusky forest. So of course, as loyal sidekicks, they had followed.
Neville had been impressed, and he and Ron had tried to ask Hermione to explain how it all worked but gave up soon on understanding. Neville wished Creevey was here with his camera.
Harry glanced up, catching the blonde boys’ eyes, who smirked at him. Harry chuckled “Yeah, weirdly, it is”
But this was another thing that she learned under her thoughts, knowing without knowing that she knew. What she did know was that when she woke up the next morning, her world was brighter and clearer than it had ever been before. As if something that had been possessing her had finally let her go.
“N-no. Thank Merlin” He said weakly, grinning at Harry who beamed back.
“Well we didn’t want to—” Ginny said, looking awkward, “Harry thought it would be better if you could, you know, grieve quietly.”
Ginny had been in this bathroom a few times, mainly when she had charms and desperately needed the bathroom, so she knew that the sink didn’t usually have a hole in it like that. She rushed forward, and peered down into—
Luna thought the whole organisation was brilliant, far more brilliant than she could have ever hoped. New ideas found their way into the suggestion box outside the office almost daily- some of them were quite brilliant. Someone had suggested they include a list of funniest point-loss reasons from the month which had promptly found its way into the next edition.
Ron frowned in thought, “So Voldemort cane back for you?”
“Ah” Harry said, amusement in his voice “This is the part where I tell you why I always where trainers to do this”
Alas, Ron’s rat didn’t show up. Ron seemed rather more bothered about his older brother Percy’s reaction to the missing pet, however, than its actual wellbeing. Hermione, a consummate only child, was not one to judge. Siblings could be very stressful as her mother told her every time her dad came home from Aunty Helen’s in a huff.
Ginny understood that. It was a common Wizarding practice to have empty graves, or coffins filled with mementos of the person instead of bodies. Human remains could be a powerful tool in many dark rituals.
Harry shrugged uncomfortably “That’s exactly why I need you to do this. If I start it, or if I’m too heavily connected then the whole thing is forever tainted by the fact that Harry Potter created it. It can never be unbiased. Therefore, it can never be fully trusted” Harry gestured emphatically “That’s why it can’t be me who has the idea to start a newspaper”
And then he slid down the creepy tunnel in the floor of the creepy girl’s bathroom. Because, Neville presumed, he was Harry Potter and Harry Potter’s movements were unplottable.
“Yes” She says, idly turning the page of her own tome ‘
She grinned ruefully at the group. “You look like an alright bunch- oh, Harry.” She cut herself off and smiled at the gaping boy. The class was used to most new teachers treating Harry a little differently, but Ron knew that for Tonks it wasn’t due to his fame, but because of their friendship. Harry had been owling Tonks since second year though Ron couldn’t for the life of him remember how they knew each other.
Draco went back to aggressive pouting while Luna found herself enchanted by the bright orange leaves falling from an oak tree beside the Hospital wing windows. She wondered if you could somehow preserve freshly fallen leaves and make jewellery and clothes out of them. Muggles probably had a way. She’d figured out that muggles usually had solutions to things that wizards simply ignored, or only theorised about in a magical sense instead of doing anything practical.
There was a general buzz of energy going around the room. The new DADA professor had not been at the welcome feast last night. Plus, the whole class timetable had apparently had to be hastily rearranged.
“But it’s a lot.” Hermione, who hated to admit defeat in the face of anything at all, said with exhaustion.
But Ginny and Percy shared the birthday month of August. This meant that their birthdays were usually accompanied by water fights and bare chests. Ginny loved this. Percy would sit in front of his cake, usually in the shape of something academically related, and pout before he reluctantly joined in. On his birthday, the twins always seemed to sign an unspoken truce, and the three would gang up as one team and bombard the others with water balloons. It was the only time during the year that Ginny saw Percy smile freely, without any of his usual reserve.
Their group had therefore taken it upon themselves to spend breaks and frees in a dusty back corner of the library. This was opposed to huddling around Hermione’s charmed jam jar of blue flames outside. It had only taken a few weeks for their group to coalesce into its now constant state. At first, Neville and Parvati, as well as some of Draco’s childhood Slytherin friends, had dipped in and out before finding their places with others. In Neville’s case, Harry had introduced him to some Hufflepuffs- Ernie, Justin and Hannah- and by the weeks end they hardly saw him apart from the trio. Harry still made it a habit to seek him out at least once a week and Hermione would partner with the round-faced boy in lessons they shared with the Slytherins, where neither Draco nor Neville’s friends were present.
Ron made an angry noise. He hadn’t been happy to learn his eleven-year-old sister had been taken on a dangerous adventure. Then again, he knew it had probably somehow been her fault. Ginny’s ability to blackmail her way into situations was positively diabolical.
“Don’t worry” Harry said comfortingly “She’s actually quite nice. I don’t think she wants to hurt anyone. She’s just been alone for so long”
When Hermione looked back, there was suddenly a whole new townhouse squeezing itself between numbers 11 and 13. It had a shade darker bricks then the rest of the row and when the door appeared it was a deep black compared to the other houses London-red front doors. The windows were obviously grimy even from here.
Ginny blinked owlishly “Draco’s dad tried to curse me?”
“Hufflepuffs cup is in Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault.” Harry said grimly. “We just need the cup.”
favourite.” Ron said in an RP accent.
Neville, who was closest reached over to her and gently took the parchment.
Kreacher let out a second of what was sure to have been an almighty screech, before slamming his hands over his mouth. The whole room waited in silence for a few seconds. Harry and Kreacher were listening out for something and when it didn’t come, they both relaxed.
“You’re an idiot.” Ron told his best friend with a laugh. “Double or nothing.” He shook Harry’s hand and pushed down the sentimental joy in his chest with a quip about Harry’s stupid face.
Their group shouldn’t work, and it definitely shouldn’t work as well as it does, but everyday she’s amazed. By the joy, the laughter, the ease. She sits at the breakfast table surrounded by unexpected friends and sometimes the luck of it all is too much. Contentedness threatens to burst its way from the confines of her skin, overflow into the world. There is too much love.
She looked at him, trying to put on an air of confusion even through her revealing blush. Neville spotted Luna over her shoulder, dressed in yellow and dancing with her father and Harry in odd patterns.
Harry laughed good naturedly “Sirius is
“Luna, I need your help” A disembodied voice declared, and Luna was forced to come out of her present position; upside down lying on the ground, legs thrown over a fallen log.
She still thought often about Hermione and Harry’s odd behaviour. In fact, a few more occasions had fanned the flames of her curiosity.
“You’re
“Yeah, well. Draco’s right. I wish they’d stop being
“Well you have only been at Hogwarts for two years. It’s not too surprising” Ginny said.
“I’ll be going, then.” Draco said, getting up and pouting.
“Well, I don’t like it.” Harry huffed.
“Just don’t do anything.” Remus said finally, patting them both on the cheek.
And then the world had gone up in purple smoke.
On the way back from digging up and reburying the coffin of Thomas Riddle Sr (and in between that, looking away while Harry vanished the bones so as not to have nightmares for years) Ginny finally asked Harry and Hermione a question.
her brothers. But still. She hardly gets a moments peace anymore.
What if--?
Ravenclaw tower wasn’t a place that ever stood still. That was why Luna loved it.
The group exchanged intrigued glances, before filling out of Hermione’s bedroom door and onto the landing. Harry, who’d left first, froze stock still at the top of the stairs causing Ron to slam into his back. Hermione peered over his shoulder
“Anything?” Hermione said dubiously.
But they weren’t Gryffindors. And there was a little- and not really that little at all when you got right to it- part of Neville that missed it, when he wasn’t surrounded by that burning fiery singlemindedness. There was a little part of Neville that couldn’t help finding the Hufflepuffs, well, dull. Not unfriendly, not uninteresting, desperately kind, but no spark. No sharpness.
“One will miss these jaunts,” Draco joined in, “But one really must be going.”
“Bullshit.” Ron grumbled.
“Hey! That’s my term of endearment for you” Sirius joked, looking over his shoulder at the Professor who rolled his eyes while Hermione and Luna laughed.
“Harry” The man said, his voice hoarse as if from disuse “I’m—”
Hermione had absolutely no clue what she was looking at. But Harry’s reaction was enough for her to know that it was another of his clearly dastardly schemes.
“Terrible.” Remus sighed at the same time Sirius exclaimed, “Excellent!”
Hermione winced slightly, “Well it would be really helpful if you did.”
“Me too” Harry gushed, practically jumping out of his chair “That’s why I think you should start one”
relative, mate”
“Exploding snap?” Neville asked, pulling a set out from his pocket.
And now his breakfast has become one angry run-on sentence.
On his forehead someone had carved a jagged ‘V’.
“You first it seems, Hermione” Harry said picking a present of the pile at random.
then later in a different colour of ink a note had been added, ‘
“Yes. He is here rather a lot. I’m not sure what he’s doing, though.”
Hermione looks like maybe she does though, and gives Ginny a half smile “Did you never just think of locking him in a room and interrogating him till he told you?”
Without the usual excitement of the beginning of the Quidditch season, November was set to be a relaxed month. By the third day of the month, however, this changed. Drastically.
“That’s why I needed you two." Harry said, embarrassed. “We’re going to have to split up. Here.” He pulled out two pieces of torn-out notebook paper from his pocket and held them out. Hermione took one and unfolded it. It was an average-talent sketch of a pretty tiara. “That’s what we’re looking for.” He said, now looking nervous as if they might suddenly decide that being friends with him was obviously too much hassle and give up and leave. “This is really important. I—I just really need your help.”
“Because you’re my friend” Harry said, face heated.
“What on earth are Busybody Bats?” Percy said, looking choked.
Neville nodded jerkily and followed Harry into their usually crowded compartment.
The first piece of evidence that she gathered was a muggle notebook. It had obviously fallen down the back of the sofa and Ginny found it when she couldn’t find her favourite quill and pulled the sofa cushions out to find it. She’d spared a moment to wonder how well the house elves were actually cleaning the tower, before flipping it open to read. It was full of odd lists such as
It was, quiet clearly, a blueprint. Of Gringotts Bank.
She was pretty relieved that he wasn’t an eldritch demon.
At first he couldn’t see anything, except for dust-motes and old chalk. Then he noticed that the dust had been cleared in some places on the floor and desks. As if they had been touched or sat upon recently.
“He seems to be doing well.” Ron noted, passing the parchment back to Harry who glanced at it again with a smile.
An odd change came over Dumbledore after they came back for the next term. Or at least, Neville noticed him far more.
Harry just snorted. “Sorry, Hermione. But we need to give your parents the slip.” She let out a garbled noise and he hurried on. “They’ve been taking as long as you at every display, so I’d say we’ve got a good hour and a half before they notice we’ve actually gone. Even then they’ll probably just think you’ve gotten stuck reading about palaeontology somewhere.”
“And Ronniekins says you’re excellent.” Fred said, grinning and passing Neville a pair of goggles too. Neville saw far too many explosions in that short week, but he did leave with a list of tasks and the inklings of experiments he had been ordered to explore and report back to them. Neville wondered ominously if he had accidentally signed his soul to the devil without knowing.
It was after exams that everything began to go wrong all at once.
There is nothing more for me. Just concrete and leather and pages and pages of loss.
Ginny clapped happily. She walked towards the window and looked out. It was true that Hermione and Harry were gone, but she could still see tendrils of smoke rising from the copse of trees.
“It’s a record player. It’s muggle” She said “It plays music”
“And your still okay with Harry staying here for a week in August? I know he’s excited”
Quirrell wasn’t the only teacher that Harry acted strangely towards. Harry seemed to hold a strange irreverence for Professor McGonagall. Honestly Hermione couldn’t find anything too nefarious in this though. McGonagall was very quickly working her way on to Hermione’s personal hero’s list. She was just so
“And the gaunt house.” Harry winced, as if he couldn’t help himself.
“Remus will convince him to,” Harry sighed, “he still feels he has a debt to Dumbles.”
“Why did he just run off?” Ron huffed, wiping his hand across his face and seeing in a flash of purple light that it had come away covered in soot. Ron wondered how much of the tent was left smouldering behind them.
Harry looked alarmed, “I’m not suicidal.”
“No. Had to save the world. Keep everyone safe. People are dying, Nev. People are dying and I could stop them.”
“Why are you so bothered by what I do, anyway, Gin?” Harry said, genuinely baffled.
Neville had just been pushed into the hallway when Sirius spoke. “Harry’s right, Albus,” His voice was chilly, “And I can’t believe this whole endeavour was over a prophecy saying my godson has to die.”
He smiled ruefully at her “I knew you hadn’t let it go”
“Excusez-moi? Professeur Tonks?” Fleur inquired politely, flicking her sheet of perfect silver hair over her shoulder, “Are you free?”
“Well, well, well- Arthur Weasley” A cool voice interrupted. Ginny watched all the blood drain from Draco’s face.
She didn’t say this with arrogance, but with a small, sure smile. “This year I hope to follow on from the excellent example of your last two Professor’s, who I have been in contact with to assure your education follows an upward trajectory. We have a saying in France ‘Qui n’avance pas, recule’. Who does not move forward, recedes. And in these times, we cannot go backward.” Her face was stoic now “We must all be ready for what may come, whatever that is. No recession.”
Harry did so, tongue caught between his teeth in concentration. He carefully moved the innocuous ring box from it’s hiding place into the box Hermione was holding. Then Hermione latched the box quickly, as if she thought the ring might somehow try and escape and cast a colloportus spell on it.
“Nothing! Like Ron said, we’re just book-worms” Harry insisted.
He grinned at her “That mean you’re going to help me out this time too Granger?”
“Passageway?” Neville yelled frantically. Harry’s head whipped around the corridor.
But Hermione cut him off, “We’re getting a cup. It’s a Hufflepuff artefact,” She looked at Neville steadily, “And we’re stealing it from the Lestrange vault.”
“And they taught you it?” Harry said, surprised.
They had wasted no time in telling their friends. All seven of them, their group of mismatched miscreants, were crowded stiffly into a single compartment. All conversations eventually petering out, candles blown out by the heavy grief and worry in the air.
, as Jean Granger was sure to espouse any time Hermione even looked as if she might consider the possibility of not finishing her bowl of muesli.
“But does it work on goblins?” Hermione fretted, and Neville hadn’t had an answer.
“Why do you have to meet here?” Harry asked sharply, in a loud enough voice that he couldn’t be mistaken for only talking to their small group. Everybody looked at him, then. Though many of them had already been staring at him beforehand.
Dumbeldore was silent a long while after that, simply staring at Harry. Then he turned away, as if to talk to Professor McGonagall next to him. She was staring between the student and headmaster in astonishment. “Sirius, Remus. Please take the children upstairs and come back so we can continue the meeting.”
“It is,” Harry shrugged, “There are informants and members all over the wizarding world. This is just Dumbledore’s inner circle.”
“Nymphadora.” Fleur trilled, the name sing song in her accent. They all exchanged looks as Tonks gave no protest. “I must thank you, merci beaucoup. Mille merci á vous. You helped me win.”
“We could have died!” Neville yelled, unforgiving.
“Yeah” Harry said, finally looking up and shooting the blonde boy a look of complete exasperation “
“You couldn’t have known.” Ron said weakly.
It was Ginny and Ron he spent the most time with, of course. And they were rounded out by Harry and Hermione, who had come to stay after the wedding as well, and Luna whenever she wandered down from her house or they wandered up to hers.
“You’ll have to apologise to Hagrid. And Buckbeak” Harry said sternly, but his mouth was twitching up at the sides “And don’t go about making a drama about this”
On the train ride back to Hogwarts, Luna and Ginny sat with Ron and his friends. Colin had stayed at Hogwarts over the holidays because he said he wanted to get photos of everything while there wasn’t anyone ruining his ‘shots’.
Maybe she had just wanted something to do. Something that Bill or Charlie, or all her other brothers, had not done first. And she’d wanted to subvert herself. Wanted to prove that she wasn’t just a stupid girl with a crush on Harry Potter. If she uncovered some plot, or even if she just found out a mundane truth for herself, then it felt a little bit like she wasn’t wasting her existence. Or like she was finally living up to her family.
“ “Hope” is the thing with feathers -
“Okay?” Ron asked pointedly, giving him a very light shake.
Since mid-February Neville had learned far too much about muggle disguise and make-up FX. Neville had a frankly terrible prosthetic nose and thick, bush eyebrows. He was wearing his own green contacts.
something from her. Pumpkin pasties was bribery food.
i'm so excited to write the next few chapters (this was defs going to be the hardest one for me) and i have a pretty free january so here's hoping i get more out.
“What house do you think you’ll be in?” Luna asked suddenly, after a slight lull in the conversation. Ginny looked at her in surprise. Luna didn’t tend to follow normal small talk patterns, or any pattern of conversation at all, and would instead drift around topics and bounce from thought to thought. If Ginny wanted to glean any pertinent information, she was forced to decipher it like a riddle.
When Ginny looked at the blonde girl sitting next to her, she could see the genuine apprehension in Luna’s face. “Gryffindor” Ginny said, with absolute certainty. “Why? What’s wrong?”
What,
“It’s nice for people to take an interest in the world” Luna said dreamily, half in and half out of the world as she so often was.
“They wouldn’t mind” Harry soothed “They love having a full house. I’ll bet we’ll go home, and they’ll have accidentally adopted two more stray cats”
Then he was off, walking away from her towards the castle. Luna watched him go.
“He didn’t vanish” Harry hissed scornfully “He just turned into a bloody rat again. What’s the point of trying to keep everyone safe if I—” Harry cut himself off, looking disproportionately frustrated. Luna exchanged a glance with Ginny who was next to her. Hermione lay a comforting hand on Harry’s knee.
“Shh” Sirius said, smiling nervously “Let me- Let me do this properly, yeah?” His eyes began to fill with tears “God. God it really hasn’t been very easy for us has it, Moons?”
Harry did his hissing thing again, then there was the sound of stone scraping against stone. Harry grabbed her hand to guide her “Come on” He said, helping her step through the circular door way.
He could die, too. Any day.
“Actually,” Hermione said, looking at Ron with imploring doe-eyes, “We’ve been meaning to talk to you for while.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh please. She’s too far gone on Lovegood for it to matter.”
“Harry?” Remus’ voice called out, “You there?”
Harry looked inclined to disagree, but Hermione agreed fiercely with Draco “You can’t know everything Harry” Harry looked at her searchingly, something deeper travelling unsaid between them “You
It was raining cats and dogs on the day that Remus Lupin married Sirius Black, but it didn’t matter to them.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up “Hermione made a list abut me being an eldritch being” He laughed “Well. I can’t say I’m entirely surprised”
“Whatever” Ron said, burying his face in clotted cream.
Ginny zoned out, shifting her head to look around the shop. There was a second landing where she knew they kept all the fiction books and even some muggle books too. Leaning over the gallery balcony was a boy with white blonde hair, smiling down at Harry with amused and exasperated softness. It took a moment for Ginny to place him before it finally came to her- The fourth person in Ron’s photograph. The boy who made Harry laugh. What had Ron said his other friend was called? Drake?
But his words were cut off by the cheer that went up in the crowd as Cedric stepped out. Ron would have believed Harry hadn’t heard him if it weren’t from the slight blush high on his cheeks.
“Where should we start?”
Maybe it was okay that she was a girl. Maybe she could let everything go. Be herself.
She grinned, and splashed Ron in the face.
It was funny to watch the champions dance awkwardly together, Victor Krum leading Katie Bell in an awkward waltz. “Bet you’re glad that isn’t you, eh mate?” Ron muttered to a slightly green looking Harry.
Harry bit his lip. “Okay. This explanation is going to have to be quick.” He ran his hand through his hair roughly, leaving it looking a little bit like he’d been electrocuted. “There are objects of importance. Six of them. And I
Ginny knows that this isn’t what her brothers wanted to teach her. Charlie and Bill had good friends, like Tonks, who taught them all about girls and equality. Fred and George wouldn’t be caught dead saying a serious bad word about the chasers on the Gryffindor team. Even Ron wrote her all his first year about his new best friend Hermione, who he called ‘brilliant’ every two sentences.
“No,” Harry said, whirling on him as if Neville had said anything other than his name, “It was supposed to be better with her! She was a better minister. And now she’s
Tonks was such a mess it was almost reassuring. She knocked over books, scattered parchment, spilt ink. Neville wondered how you could be an Auror when you couldn’t traverse a classroom without tripping at least three times. But he had seen her brutal efficiency, the strength in her casting.
Hermione gave Harry a dark look. Ron guessed they’d had this talk before. “Yeah, Harry.”
“Kissy?” Ginny shrieked mockingly “Are you seven?”
Draco arrived late to the party, flustered. Many cheers went up from their group at his fearless escape.
She rubbed her face in annoyance, still half asleep. The fire finally died down fully and she was just about to get up and head to her actual bed when the portrait hole began to creak open. Ginny peered over the high back of the sofa.
are absolutely terrible at this- a fire had just been lit inside Ginny Weasley. A fire that couldn’t be doused unless with one thing;
“Merlin,” Ron whimpered, “Now
Hermione nodded and cut in “Yes. We’ve structured it as half a study group, half a lesson. We have a few people who’ve volunteered to do demonstrations for the first half hour, then for the hour after that it can be practice and study groups”
“What’s going to happen in two days?” Ron snorted “’sides, I’d just go with you and ‘Mione if I couldn’t go home”
And also just a little part of her didn’t believe him.
It was an odd Christmas, but the best he could remember. On Christmas day Remus and Sirius took him to Mungo's, Harry politely standing beside him without speaking much except to say a polite hello to Neville’s parents.
Draco was still as ashen as he’d been when Flitwick had held court in the common room. He tentatively placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder and whispered “It isn’t your fault”
Harry gave him an appreciative look, a small glow of joy in his eyes, “All in, eh?”
“I guess someone cursed the paper. I’m sure it will wear off eventually,” Harry pulled out a scrap of folded parchment from his pocket, dumping his school bag on the floor. Neville had abandoned his in the great hall in the hectic effort of getting Iphigenia, a seventh year, off of Harry’s head.
Harry almost threw his scone down in passion, before going excitedly into a rant about how Plumpton was the greatest seeker of all time (“three and a half seconds, Gin! He caught the snitch in three and a half seconds”) and how even Griffiths couldn’t hold a candle to him.
At the start of the year shop all of the boys had bought dress robes, unbeknownst to why, and Harry had convinced Ron to put some of his World Cup winnings towards some handsome navy-blue robes. Ron had been happy to do so when a hysterically laughing Ginny had described the dress robes Molly had intended for him, later backed up by an equally diabolically laughing Harry.
Ginny laughed loudly and Luna winked at her. Everyone else stared at the blonde girl with bewildered amusement. All except Harry, who was also grinning and looking at Luna fondly like he was used to all the weird thing she said. It made Ginny’s stomach squirm slightly. She pushed it away as probably her just being jealous that Harry was looking at Luna instead of her.
Something flashed in Harry’s eyes and he smiled sadly. “You know I had a friend who told me something very similar” He looked back out at the grounds, as if looking back through years “Long time ago” He looked back at her, smiling “But you never forget a friend”
The first lick of flame crested over the edge of the cauldron. Neville could swear that dancing eyes watched him for within the flame. It was almost anticlimactic- that sweet orange dance of fire.
That was the first time Hermione ever saw Harry cry. She hoped that every time afterwards would be for equally happy occasions.
“Will you try out for the team, this year?” She asked him over a morning cup of tea. Both Harry and she were early risers, whereas Ron could sleep a whole day away if no one woke him up. In the morning over a pot of tea and some of her mums’ scones was when they usually had their quidditch talks.
Harry Potter knew her name!
“You couldn’t have saved them. You didn’t know.” Ron insisted.
“Oh! Yes, that makes sense.” Tonks beckoned Fleur forward into the room. “Is this for your exploratory essay?”
“Sorry, Ronnie.” Ginny said cruelly. “Don’t know if you’re allowed to know.”
Luna rolled her eyes. “That’s years away”
“It isn’t that I don’t trust him.” Harry said unconvincingly, “It’s just…. You can’t understand. We were enemies for seven years. You hated him too. He was a brat.”
“Why aren’t Ron and Draco involved in any of this?”
There is a life I find tucked next to a bookend. It is nothing special in its size, perhaps a meagre fifty years. It is unbound.
Swearing is a new thing for Ron. He’d decided that he couldn’t let Harry go about being the only sailor-mouthed lunatic in their friendship group. They’re practically adults now. Ron can graduate from the school of blasphemous
Ron made a face at the thought. Inside his chest was filled with airy light.
They both stopped. “You go first.” Harry said, rubbing his forehead tiredly.
a Basilisks eyes.
They left the shop with a bag groaning under the weight of The Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Joni Mitchell. A Nina Simone just for Remus to salivate over. Harry made Neville buy a record too, for himself.
going to try and curse him, even if she didn’t know any really good curses yet.
For all the Goblin, whose name was Wendhorn according to his nametag, knew they had been led down to the vaults because Hermione was a distant Shafiq relation wishing to access her vault (they’d used a confundus charm for this part), retrieved some money, and were now making their way back up.
But the dragon doesn't know what I do. I have never found a world where Draco Malfoy doesn't fall in love with Harry Potter.
It wasn’t the record Neville had expected. But from the first note of Suzanne he was fixed, lying on the shag-pile next to Remus’ ancient record player.
“I won’t tell Ginny! I won’t tell Ginny, Merlin,” The three of them all relaxed as one. Neville frowned, “Under one condition.”
They watched as a brown haired boy named Neville saves the world, and they cheer for him and turn back to their living.
and a repeated refrain of
“I think maybe your life is just extra ridiculous. Like everyone else in the world gets to have mundane lives because you took all the strange happenings with you at birth.” Hermione whispered, still in slight shock.
Sir Terry Pratchett, Witches Abroad.
Harry rolled his eyes but smiled ever so lightly. Then it was replaced by a frown. “You aren’t gong to like what I want to do.”
What they had discovered was that many necromantic rituals required an exchange. Life for life, blood for blood. The more complex the ritual, the more death you needed. Necromancy was an even sum game. You couldn’t take anything out which you hadn’t already given tenfold. Hermione referred to it as the mark of cane for subsections of magic.
Draco gasped in delight. Hermione smiled smugly at Ron.
“You are so goddamn strange” She told him. They stared at each other, expressionless, for a few moments. The corners of Harry’s mouth twitched up. She let out a snort which she tried uselessly to hide behind her hand. Then they were both laughing loudly, heads buried in there hands.
“A normal twelve-year-old? Not much. But you?”
A jack rabbit Patronus appears next to Dumbledore before they even make it to the first step. Every one of them stops dead in their tracks.
Harry tapped the parchment with his wand, muttering something. Then he unfolded the parchment- it seemed larger and Luna could see that ink was scrolling itself across the yellow page.
Scrooge was moaning as Harry began to pout. Hermione sighed. She was honestly far too much of a pushover.
“But you two are—you know.”
Harry visibly gulped “Actually,” He said, voice choked before he cleared it and went to go on. Hermione and Ron exchanged bewildered looks. “I wondered if I could ask you a question.”
“Harry, no offence. I robbed a bank for you no questions asked. I think we can assume at this point that I’m all in.”
Hermione and Ron looked at each other in surprise, assessing. It had been only a few months and yet Neville couldn’t imagine them not together.
Ron winced, watching Harry pace violently, muttering to himself and scowling.
“I can do it,” Harry insisted, Neville could see he was fingering his wand.
The day Ginny achieved what she’d been working for since that day in her bedroom last summer was an ordinary Friday. Until, quite abruptly, it wasn’t.
“We need to find Neville.” Was all Ron said, passing the letter to the Slytherin girl and bolting from the room, Ginny and Luna hot on his heels.
Tonks scrunched her nose at him, her hair darkening a shade or two to indigo. “Yeah that was the plan.” She sighed. “Unfortunately mad-eye decided he isn’t going to retire this year, actually, which is all well and good except he decided this, like, two days ago and so the compromise for Dumbles- I mean Professor Dumbledore,” Tonks’ cheeks went as bubble gum pink as her hair, “Well, I got sent.”
“—telling you, Ron knows—”
Harry informed them all that the Minister was paying a lot closer attention to the school’s actions this year, that they’d almost had Fleur kicked out in favour of a ministry puppet.
“We’re staying here,” Fred or George frowned, “What’s wrong with home?”
“But we like Fleur.” Hermione said, frowning in confusion.
fourth year, I suppose.” Tonks said absently, gesturing to them. Then she picked a paper from Fleur's stack and began to scan it.
“What the hell did you do?” Neville yelled, rounding on a soot covered harry. Neville’s voice was cracked from the smoke. His throat and eyes ached. “You’re absolutely fucking crazy, you know that?”
With a last sorrowful look around the hallway and up the stairs, Harry turned on his heels and walked through Hermione and Ron and back out the door.
accidentally took someone’s eyes out.
“Colin!” Ginny hissed. Backing out of the way quickly and patting him excitedly on the shoulder “Get a picture! Quick”
“Harry!” She cried, stumbling slightly over her untied shoe laces and simultaneously attempting to re-tie her mane of hair into its ponytail. “Wait!”
Neville began to chant along to, hoping he was saying it right. They heaved on the door, pushing the flame back.
Ginny leaned down. Her and Luna were sat on the bench above them, with Dean and Seamus rounding out their little group. Fred, George and Lee were at the front of the stands waving about percussion rattles and riling up bets off students and teachers alike.
“She’s nice, don’t worry,” Harry said, as if Neville was being unreasonable.
” Ron said in a terribly exaggerated accent.
The cat lets out a possibly unrelated exhale and takes no notice.
“Fine, m
The goblin had glared at them, judgement written plain across his face, but he had moved his hand to a different lever anyway and the cart had flown off at a slightly slower pace then usual.
Surprisingly Vance just laughed “She was a few years younger than me, actually. I tutored her in Defence. She claimed it was her weakest class, but she still got easy E’s so I’m not so sure.” Vance gave Harry a kind look “She was a brilliant witch. You must have gotten that from her. Your dad was brilliant too, I’m sure, but he was no Lily Evans. Her death was a loss to the whole world, but most especially to you, kid”
“Not that long, quite.” A voice said from the doorway. Remus stood leaning inside the door frame, smiling mildly.
Then had been his stored-away wand, summer of first year. Hole in the kitchen wall and his grandma torn between furiousness and pride.
Draco gave him a rueful smile, “Well, it is if we pretend it is.”
It was a to-do list. She caught the phrase
“Yes. However mental it makes me,” Neville shrugged.
On May 3
“This says…” Neville flipped the page, “Ah. Ten years of intense study, at least.”
“You look nice.” Harry said, sitting up and smiling at his quasi-dad.
“Merlin” Lupin sighed, grabbing one of their bags “Don’t scare them away when they’re barely over the threshold, Pads”
Snape frowned at him, “Proof?”
“It’s so weird being in the stands.” Harry muttered on the day of the first task, so only Ron and Hermione could here. Hermione smirked at him and Ron rolled his eyes.
“Oh, shove it.” Ron said, going the same colour as his hair. Hermione giggled again, embarrassed.
We allot each customer a thirty-minute period before we allow another cart to come down here. We know how you value your privacy, sir.”
The English countryside.
The regular residents of the townhouse, which included said grooms and their adopted ward Harry Potter, all commented on the oddness of having strangers around the place. It had been mere months since Sirius Black had had all charges against him legally dropped. Finally acquitted in the eyes of the law after a gruelling four years.
“See.” Harry said grinning. “It doesn’t work for you because that is literally just how you always sound.”
Harry and Hermione shared a look. Ron felt his blood begin to simmer. “It’s Nothing.” Harry dismissed, glancing down at his potions essay shiftily.
“You don’t have to punish yourself Kreacher.” Harry muttered, rubbing his hand over his brow and looking far older than his eleven years. “But I do need the locket.”
Harry could be so strange.
didn’t seem to cover it. Could Harry be contained by explanation?
It was the second day of classes, but due to having arrived on a Friday they’d been settled days ago. They’d had only a handful of classes on Monday.
Harry shook his head, but he didn’t look certain, “I’m not sure. Would Bones do that? She’s accepted that he’s back, told everyone to prepare.”
Harry had the look on his face of a man who desperately wanted to dispute something he knew was true.
“But it’s a Sunday.” Mum said, now turning her full focus on her husband.
When Ron came back, it turned out he’d misplaced his rat. (Hermione considered Scabbers a very odd name for a supposedly loved pet). Harry threw himself into looking high and low for him, and they were joined soon by a round faced boy called Neville who had coincidentally misplaced his toad too.
She blinked at him, no expression on her face. Then her cheeks started to go pink.
said “Molly, we know this has all been a massive shock-“
“She’s from Beauxbatons.” Ginny scowled.
“And no attacks. Yet.” Harry said darkly. Hermione gave him a worried look.
Despite himself Ron turned on automatic to share a grin with Harry. This was going to be a fun year.
“The prophecy’s pointless. Blah blah blah, I have to defeat Voldemort, blah blah blah.”
“Come on” Arthur said “Let’s go find your mother”
next up; the lovely Luna, suffering through having to be Harry's confidante
“One finds one is
“Right,” Ron nodded, “And when a bloodline is apparently dead it takes the ministry about six months to assess closest blood relations, to wait for an unexpected claim to appear—and then it all becomes Ministry property.”
“Here” Ginny said, ducking her head and blushing.
She couldn’t say the same about the rest of Harry’s secrets.
“We must talk—”
Harry paused on only the second step up and said “Well if they ignore me, they ignore me. But if they don’t? Hermione I might make things so much better”
“How has your dad not noticed you’ve disappeared yet?” Hermione asked incredulously, flopping exasperatedly down on Draco’s bed and making the blonde let out an ‘oof’ at the sudden jolt. Ron couldn’t help noticing the way Hermione looked in the warm lamp light. Brown skin and hair dancing golden.
“Of course.” Harry said drily, as the flames grew stronger.
“I take it back. You’re mental.” Neville said drily, eyeing Moaning Myrtle with trepidation.
“Hermione Granger! There is someone we both have to meet."
“Cutting it close,” Neville said, frowning.
Harry was still all nerves, however. He was convinced that at any moment something would go wrong. Ron couldn’t blame him. The last time Harry had seen this maze, he’d been dragging Diggory’s lifeless body from it.
“Fae” Hermione corrected petulantly.
“Twenty-five minutes.” Draco sniffed, but made no attempt to push Harry away. Ron rolled his eyes at the pair, sharing an exasperated look with Hermione on his left.
“Wait. Is Remus younger than Sirius?” Ron asked, looking up with a grin.
What the hell was Harry? The encompassing
Small, recorded secrets like these calmed her. It reassured her that the world kept going even when she turned her back. That she didn’t have to keep watch constantly to keep it alive.
“We’ve been trying to make things better.” Hermione said softly.
“A spell Fred and George invented” she shrugged “It’s like a muggle repellent charm but instead it makes people suddenly stop being curious when they come to investigate what you’re doing. It makes mum leave Fred and George alone when they’re inventing”
Ginny had run off crying. That’s what she hates the most. It makes her feel weak when they can get to her so easily. When the people you’ve looked up to your whole life treat you like your less than you are, it hurts. She’d eventually wandered, between bouts of tears which she had furiously rubbed away, down to the edge of the lake. She’d been skimming stones and brooding for at least half an hour at this point.
"You should come by my tutorial sometime," he said, finally. "We always could always use some new ideas."
The first
They landed somewhere near Stuttgart, in the spare room of an old pub that Draco had read about, only read about, they had quickly run out of safe places they knew about before they started running. Those in the life shared information as they could, but you could never know if these were perfectly safe, or some sort of set up.
“In London.”
“Do you reckon it’s a false lead?”
"Right," Harry nodded, as if that was entirely reasonable.
“Harry—”
over the hull.”
“I know you,” Harry said. “You let me take the lucky cigarette.”
.” There were only two of them. “
“Harry,” Draco called.
with something like ‘Deputy Head Auror Speaks Out: Ministry Corruption’ and felt, for the first time in months, the tremor of hope like a budding spark in his chest, relit and excited. “We could coordinate something, set up a series of pamphlet drops, maybe even something organized—” He cut himself off, looking up at Charlie with a smile that hit down to his toes. He couldn’t wait to talk it all through with Harry.
"We were discussing your choice to assign my article on day one of your class," Draco said, inclining his head towards Harry with a challenge. "Four months ago," he added, but didn't say:
Draco put one chilly hand over Harry’s. Kept him there. Harry’s hand was an inch from Draco’s chin, a breath away from a caress. His skin was so pale in the moonlight, so cold. What would Harry give to get to warm him up?
“I know,” Draco said. He pressed his shoulder into Harry’s and Harry softened even further, giving him that gentle little smile that he saved only for Draco. There was something dark in Harry’s eyes too, right at the corners, a little too mischievous.
Harry pointed his wand at his son.
“Better have cleaned it properly,” Draco grumbled.  The last time Harry had stolen one of his good weapons, he had flipped it closed with a vamp’s drying venom, leaving a nasty surprise when Draco did the next weapons check.
He hadn't known Harry was doing Muggle Studies too, though he supposed there was still a great deal yet to learn about Harry.
“Gone,” Harry echoed, like a tolling watch bell warning call.
“We got another pair this weekend,” Harry said under his breath as Draco stood back up.  “You should have seen Draco.  You'd be proud of him, he was brutal.  Well, they were brutal first,”  Harry nudged him and Draco leaned into the touch.
The room could have fit another small handful of tourists, but no one was beside him. The noise of the crowd in the main gallery felt deadened, even though there was no door to this alcove. Perhaps it was the weight of the Mirror soaking up the hubbub of the world outside.
thanks again for reading.
“Not with words,” he says, and swallows again.
and even one or two reporters from the Continent, Quick Quotes quills scribbling furiously. And there, amid the ranks of the rookie Aurors, Harry Potter stood shoulder to shoulder with Ron Weasley and another pair of burly Auror-types.
“No,” she agreed carefully, forming the word as though it felt foreign in her mouth. Draco looked down at her shoes, a little too small for her, a little too masculine for someone with such lanky limbs and a delicate dress.
Instead of meeting Hermione for drinks as he’d promised, he fell asleep and dreamed of flying astride a thestral with Draco at his back, fingers at his hips. He didn’t mind that Draco wore short-sleeved shirts and laughed with his mouth too open, or that Draco was quick-witted and smarter than Harry. They drifted through the air together, body against body, warm against warm and Harry could swear it was real.
There were moments when he wondered if it would be wiser to carry his wand anyway and just never use it. The unknown risk might be safer than the danger of not carrying it at all. But he had grown used to it, in the many months since he had held it holstered regularly. He did things as Muggles did, made his coffee, took the tube. He was more patient now, he thought. Things took more time without magic, but maybe that was alright.
He went back the next day, certain that there was some charm on the Mirror. He had to break whatever curse it was or someone could get hurt.
It’s obvious from the start that the second shift didn’t tell them the bond was broken. If it weren’t half three in the morning, and if you weren’t dead bored with the rest of the caseload, you probably would have gone in and done your Healerly duty.
But Harry smiled, wide and indulgent, with those bright eyes that seemed to look straight into him. Draco strengthened his Occlumency just a touch, watching Harry, wondering if he would try to read Draco’s mind. “Maybe I’ll be lucky, then,” Harry grinned, “Merlin knows I need it.”

“I asked you a question.”
“If the coffee still looks like coffee, there’s not enough cream." The cup in question is sitting on Potter’s side table, horribly pale and still steaming away under a warming charm.
’s shoulders filled his mind. He could see the way that Harry would kiss, with that rough desperation he saved for Draco, the way his hands would move over his new partner’s face as if he were putting it all to memory. Jealousy panged louder in his chest like a heartbeat, aching, twisting. Perhaps Harry would be better off with anyone anyhow. Perhaps he would be safer, happier. He was so far from his friends, so far from anywhere Harry had called home. Perhaps—
Harry didn’t stay.
,” Draco said beside him. “It’s another illusion. I’m right here.” He put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, steadying, comforting.
“Excuse me,” Malfoy complains loudly. “I think I’m going to be sick.”
“You’re not going to find anything,” Harry snapped.
“Yes,” Harry groaned, and bit his lip. He couldn’t open his eyes to see how angry Draco was.
Draco was at the bow of the boat, sandy-haired and shining in the yellow sun as he swept the deck. The days outdoors had left a scatter of pale freckles on his forehead and cheeks and a rosy glow to his skin he swore wasn’t sunburn.
“You’re hurt.” Draco crossed the room in a flash, so quickly Harry couldn’t track his motion. He brushed a hand against Harry’s jaw, gentle enough to hurt. He was cool against Harry’s skin, like he’d been standing in the wind, but his cheeks were pink and sunkissed, as handsome as he’d ever been.
“I know you have your reasons, and they’re good ones,” Charlie said quietly, running a hand over his mouth in a move that was somehow both attractive and embarrassed. “But Ron— he’s turned. He’s— He reached out to Harry, I don’t even know how he got through.”
On the morning of the fourth day, Harry’s scarf went missing. Or rather, he realised it had been missing. Digging through his bag, through the tangled sheets, the patterned fabric was nowhere to be seen.
“Research?” Harry pushed his chin up on one hand.
Draco’s hands stilled somewhere between a cleaning spell and a layer of protection, sparks fading at the tip. He swallowed hard. “That was not mine,” he whispered, the realization of exactly how lost they were settling heavily on his mind. There was something horribly invasive about a false Legilimency link and the idea of someone sliming into his mind to plant a trap.
“But you do.”He’s already got the Time-Turner out and slung around both their necks, muttering about a seventeenth-century shipwreck —
In return, Harry offered only a single memory. He let it sink into the Legilimency link between them, like words whispered on a pillow late at night or early in the morning.
Draco saw Harry by accident half a dozen times after the war had ended. Those after that were usually on purpose, but the first six were unplanned.
“You’ve improved,” Harry murmured, admiring the details on the hawk’s feathers each slightly different from each other, exquisitely designed. And Draco had cast it into life in a matter of seconds. His skill was unmatched.
James’ face was fading, turning pale. His hair grew. It was all wrong. Why didn’t Harry’s spell work?
In a pique of irritation, Harry bent over the washbasin in the corner of the cabin. He sluiced cool water, fresh from his wand, over his hands. There was a mirror fragment hung on the ship’s wall above the washbasin, a sharp, odd shape that cut across his chin and forehead awkwardly.
“I could be here just to catch up.” Draco picked at the tea bag tag, flicking at it with a petulant snick of his fingers. “I could just want a chat with someone in the know.”
There, in pride of place across from the entrance, was Harry’s portrait. Commissioned just after the end of the war, the painting showed Harry among great velvety curtains, posed in his in Auror regalia, even though he would have only been a trainee.
Draco pointed. Harry followed the long pale line of his hand down past the bow.
Draco paused as they came to the end of the cemetery, to the short marble wall and the most recent grave.  Narcissa Malfoy’s headstone was simple, more so than almost any other in the cemetery, cut in a gray stone with the symbols of the Black family and the Malfoy family carved in a neat hand.
“Yeah,” Harry hummed, brushing a hand over the hair at the back of Draco’s neck.  “Always your saviour.”
There was no hot water left in the kettle on the hob, and the washbasin in the corner had little appeal. His skin crawled in a way that
“I’m, er, not completely certain you do,” Harry continued, glasses on but completely blind.
you.”
“Well, that answers my first question.” Malfoy scribbled on his clipboard with a long hawk-feather quill.

They finished rinsing, Draco’s gentle touch on every inch of Harry’s skin. They could leave the boat and the Siren behind them, curl up in the big bed upstairs and stay until morning.
The last step was getting rid of this ghost, but they could do that.
“Late.”
He felt it, the same too-saturated press in his mind. She was a skilled Legilimens, that much was clear, but he was effective to begin with, and even stronger after nearly a year of constant practice. Draco allowed her into his mind, carefully shaping the tiny corridor she could travel through, locking her in so that she could not press any further into his mind. There was the tell-tale stab of pain as she struck out, pushing deeper, shooting into his mind. Draco did not waver, keeping his eyes fiercely at her chin.
The water spray intensified, blue-green and wrong coming from the showerhead. Harry reached for the door behind them but found it locked. Draco took his hand; they were one, unbreakable.
He said that it was about Jill, that Hermione had gotten her released without severe sentencing after a protest had gone spectacularly badly. But Jill was safe. And Hermione was powerful. And they were safe too, tucked away until they could come back louder than ever before.
We’ve done it a thousand times; his wandless
Without his permission, the idea of Harry’s rough hands twined around someone
“There’s got to be a way to Apparate without our wands,” Harry murmured, reaching for Draco. “They’ll just keep following us if we can’t.”
Draco slid till his back hit the bar, knees falling open.  Harry leaned over him, waving to the bartender.  He slipped between Draco’s legs, and he fit right there, his thighs against Draco’s, his hips too close.
Draco was close enough to touch, close enough to share air. Was Draco going to kiss him? Harry was going to burn up from all this wanting if he didn’t.
They kissed and it was like breathing again, like if Harry ever stopped kissing Draco, he’d combust right then and there for lack of air. There was much to talk about, but they would not need the Mirror for that. After all, it was better to live than to dwell in dreams; it was better to kiss him in reality than let hope remain reflected.
There was a noise at the hatch. Was Draco coming?
"Maybe you should." The dryer made an odd noise and Draco broke his intense eye contact to glare at it. Cock-blocking thing.
He decided to trust Ron, and Charlie, and Harry, and let his little circle grow just one ring larger. It was terrifying, every new person that he decided to trust. It was one more person that could turn against him, that could know his heart and twist it cruelly if they so wished. Draco let his fingers drift over the closure to the magical bag.
“You torture me,” murmured Harry, sipping at his wine and pretending to behave.
An hour passed undisturbed. No ghost.
“Research.”
” but found it strangely wet. When he pulled his hand away — “
“Our new Wand Registry plan is the next phase of restoring order,” he boomed, too gleeful. “And,” he added as if he were offering all watching a gift, “you won’t even have to do a thing. We have your wands on record already, and will commence tracking all spells. This will keep us all safer.” A sick feeling filled Draco’s chest.
Draco, as Draco always did, chose the former. He looked up and caught her eye.
The cold shock of water rolled over his skin and pulled at his clothes, dragging him in all directions. He surfaced a few feet from Draco, who reached for him, spitting water.
At that, Draco finally met his eye. Harry gripped the mug of tea for balance. It was like old times, those eyes, like too many memories.  Draco was across the worktable deep in the Department of Mysteries, eyes bright as he regaled Harry with his latest Phantasmic research.
“Suppose they could,” said Harry, too quietly, as he made the little iris beneath Draco’s feet bloom. It was blue and yellow and grew up with shoots of green. “Do you think I could do it?”
Malfoy mutters, “I hated that.”
). I pour fresh water from my wand, fragrant with the soap, clear and bloodless. “You’re a good man. You can rest now. You can rest.”
Draco was out of the blankets and standing clear of the bunk before Harry could take it back.
“This feels right,” Harry muttered, rolling his hips against Draco’s as they cut through the air. Draco’s hands were tight, body molded to Harry’s back. The thick leather saddle beneath their legs warmed under the friction of flying.
Though it was true that Hermione’s latest bill had done some good, it was a drop of water in the sea of Ministry power, swept under and ignored. There was little that a single lawyer could do without the strength of precedent under her feet.
I have to lean forward and kiss him against his throat so I can feel his heartbeat under my lips. He’s alive, he’s alive. Let him rest.
“It’s a smart cover story, certainly,” Draco nodded, wondering if he could get Harry out and warn the others before Harry Apparated back to Auror headquarters and sent a team their way. Perhaps there was already a team on their way.
“There is no right way,” Draco agreed quietly. “There’s only caring about what’s right.”
“Must be.” But Harry wasn’t convinced.
and Draco could not forget that.
and a repellent charm around them, glancing at his watch to judge the frugal seconds ticking by when he felt so exposed already. He still refused to meet his companion’s eye, sending a wandless
“I didn’t know if you’d know it,” he said, whispering a wandless healing charm. It wasn’t strong enough to do much good, but it was enough to staunch the bleeding.
“Some folks say we should be celebrating it,” said Harry. His eyes flicked from the painting to Draco, and back when he realized that Draco was looking at him, unabashedly.
