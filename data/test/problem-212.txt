Harry buries a hand in Scorpius’ silver locks and runs his fingers through the strands. “Shh, shh, it’s okay, kiddo. I’m
Harry just rolls his eyes and takes a bite out of his donut, following Blaise into his office. “Exactly,” He starts with his mouthful. “Which means I should know what I’m talking about when I say Ireland is a better team.”
Harry lets out a small chuckle.
Narcissa floats elegantly in the room and takes a seat beside Lucius. “I think it’s good for his education to learn about muggles before he heads off to Hogwarts. He loves that school anyway.”
Hell would freeze over before that happened.
“-or maybe take a-,”
Draco throws his head back. “Honestly, father. I can’t believe you convinced him to call me that.” Draco opens his arms. “Come here, Scorp.” Lucius lifts the five year old and places him carefully in Draco’s lap. He grunts as his son throws his arms around his neck.
“I should go.” He turns and Blaise wraps a hand around his wrist.
He washes his hands at the sink. “Alright, put me to work.”
Right. Time to get this over with.
He chokes back a sob and receives a kick to the stomach. “Shut the fuck up, Death Eater Scum!”
Even after the war, he hasn’t had a whole lot of success. His sentence is reduced to five years in Azkazban thanks to the testimony of one Harry Potter – of
“Um…” She looks down at her parchment. “It looks like you’ll be seeing Mr. Roger Griffin.”
– you look nice.” He glances at Draco before flicking his eyes back to the screen. “How was your date?”
He runs a hand through his hair as he reads over the rest of Zabini’s report and sighs. There’s only one minor problem and that’s Zabini himself. Harry’s going to have to go to Blaise’s office with his side of the report and after learning of his… proclivities towards Malfoy…
There’s a beat of silence before Harry speaks up again. “
Several things
Draco tosses back his hair and spins around patting Harry on the cheek a few times. “Yes, he quite is, isn’t he?”
“Can I go get something?”
“Because my mom was a bad kid, right?”
“Ah Cormac!” He reaches out and shakes his hand. “It’s good to see you again.”
Harry’s heart is beating in his throat and hugs Scorpius close to his chest. “I believe you, Scorp.” He plants a soft reassuring kiss to his head. “I’m going to find your mom. I promise.”
Mr. Griffin furrows his eyebrows. “I guess if you’d like to look at it that way.”
, I am Scorpius. Why would you have to ask?”
Draco looks away. “Don’t worry about it, Blaise.”
Sunday afternoon, Harry’s dusting himself off outside of Andromeda’s fireplace. “Andy!” He calls. “Andy! I’m here!”
“Yes.” He clears his throat to hide the fact that he agreed a little too quickly. “Er – um – I’d like that.”
.” He says the last word breathlessly and it has Draco’s heart thudding against his chest. “He’s so ruddy brilliant it’s unfair, he’s so kind and gentle, but he’s strong too.”
Hermione squeals and he freezes. “That’s what you’re upset about!” She screeches. “You’re seeing Draco Malfoy and I have to find out from Ron! Harry!” She freezes, eyes wide and watery. “I thought we were best friends.” She quivers.
“Andromeda.” Her mouth snaps shut. “I think it’s a great idea.” He can’t help the smile on his face.
“Oi!” Teddy and Scorpius slide to halt beside them. “Are you guys alright?”
“Mr. Malfoy. I’d like to be blunt with you.” Draco nods. “You’ve been cursed.”
“I-,” He looks at Hermione. “I don’t know how I feel about him now.” A smile tugs at his lips. “I definitely don’t hate him…”
“Yes I did mama! We talked about how pretty you are.”
“I don’t have wine, unfortunately it makes me sick, but I do have beer?”
It’s probably time to check on Scorp.
. Are you talking about that intern from America? He left a couple weeks ago…”
“Yup.” He winks. “To win Draco, I’m gonna win over Scorpius. I want to make sure Draco knows that I want both Malfoy boys – I’m not just in it for now, I’m ready to be in it for the long run.” He clears his throat. “So, I’m gonna need to talk to Andromeda, Narcissa and even fucking Lucius.”
Harry cocks an eyebrow back.
Harry ruffles his hair. “Of course I did. I told you I would, didn’t I?”
“Mr. Malfoy, did you drink a potion to freeze your heart?” His face is blank as he asks and Draco flushes, turning away.
Potter takes a sip of his water. “You mean the manor?”
Or that they’ve been –
“It’s complicated.” Harry rises to his feet. “Thank you for your help, mate. Lucius,” the blonde stand as well. “Are you guys finished here? Would you fancy grabbing lunch?”
Could it be a curse that’s frozen his heart? He grips his hair frustration. Merlin, who could help him? Fuck he really wished literally any adult in his life was still around. Fuck what he would give for fuckin’ Snape at this point. A curse like this could be a spell but there’s almost always a counter curse – a potion would be more difficult to crack. It’s probably a potion. He needs a fucking potion master like Draco or –
He looks down at his tiny chubby hands squeezing Harry’s index fingers. “My mom says you’re a hero… that you’re a really good person. He says you were a good person when he was – he was a bad one.” He looks up at Harry again. “People hurt my mom some times.” He scowls – a look that is so Malfoy. “They even pretend to like him before they hurt him…” His eyes water and he buries his face in Harry’s arm. “Please don’t do that to my mom.” His voice breaks and he squeezes onto Harry tighter.
Oh shit did he say that out loud. “Um-,”
He ends up in St. Mungo’s. He spends a week there. It’s a long enough time for Blaise to think about the encounter and decide to break up with him.
“How about just me and you then?”
“Surprised they allowed filth like you into the Ministry.” He sees Blaise bristle and his hand move slowly to his wand.
Potter gives Scorpius a bright smile. “Well, hello Scorpius. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Harry.” He looks around before leaning forward. “I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Scorpius leans forward slightly to hear him. “I’m a little shy too.”
Potter lets out a nervous laugh. “This is weird. It’s been so long. You look-,” Draco sees a thousand small flickers of emotion dance across Potter’s eyes. “-you look good. I can’t believe we haven’t seen each other in ten years.”
There’s a light tapping at the icy window pain above his work table and he furrows his eyebrows, surprised at the Horned ministry owl tapping at the glass. “Shit.” He swears. What could the ministry possibly want? He opens the window and the large owl drops an envelope on the table in front of him. He mutters a thank you and shuts the window behind the large bird.
He waits for a response, long enough to begin setting his phone down before it vibrates again.
The door swings open and a plump nurse, vaguely reminding him of Mrs. Weasley, enters the room. “Oh hello dear! You’re awake. Let me grab the doctor.” As she leaves, Scorpius ducks from around the nurse, Lucius trailing behind him.
“Yes. Perfect.”
During the month of December, the ministry workers get half days and at the end of the year, Harry is so grateful for the extra time. Harry’s sitting at the coffee shop in the large atrium flipping through a prophet while he waits for Ron and Hermione to finish up. He’s halfway through an article on new uses for dragon blood when a pair of familiar voices hits his ears and he’s suddenly much more interested in what they’re saying.
“Well,” She turns her focus to Potter and grabs one of his hands in both of hers. “It seems like I’m in you debt again. Thank you for bringing Draco home safe. Sit and have some tea, Mr. Potter.”
Potter grabs a small tea sandwich and gives Draco a thoughtful look. “You send Scorpius to a muggle school?”
She plays with a loose thread on his blanket. “He wrote a letter a few years ago, a long and detailed letter about how sorry he was for everything and he didn’t expect my forgiveness. He didn’t make excuses, or try to explain himself, he just – apologized.”
Her eyes widen slightly, recognition dawning her features when she catches his eye. “I have not. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter.” She shakes his hand and gives him a kind smile. “Draco, run along and have lunch now, dear. I’ve got it from here.” She winks at the blonde. “Looks to me like you’ve got a snack to get to.”
Harry swallows thickly. “Right. I’m – uh, I’m sorry, that sucks.” He readjusts the items in his hand and tucks them to his side. “About what happened earlier in Diagon…?”
Scorpius drops from view and Draco falters. “Hang on a sec.” They floo home and Scorpius flies upstairs. “Wash your hands!” Draco calls after him. He looks back and sees Harry studying him, a small smile on his face. “Thank you, for earlier, Harry.”
” He shrugs and sits up straight opening his eyes and letting his chair drop. “I just feel like with Teddy starting at Hogwarts next year, and me being so slammed at work that maybe… maybe I just need to step back a bit.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Fine, but you have to put on one of my aprons.” He gestures to the aprons hanging on the hook and Harry puts on an emerald green apron splattered with golden snitches.
Scorpius lights up and squeezes Harry’s cheeks, squealing excitedly. Teddy snorts beside him. “
Harry looks back at Hermione’s worried expression before looking back at Scorpius. “Listen, kiddo. I gotta go find your mom and I need you stay with my best friend Hermione.” Scorpius peaks out from Harry, frowning. “She’s like my sister, Scorpius. I promise she’s really nice and she’ll take good care of you.”
“Yes. I think it’s important to bury the hatchet, so to speak, with the Malfoys. In fact I-,” He hesitates slightly. “I had tea wit the Malfoys the other day.”
“You’ll be monitored in the forest by members of the faculty. We may be hidden in plain sight or perhaps not there at all, but we are watching. Your successes at survival and magic will be counted and your failures will be measured. Grades will go as followed: Outstanding being the highest possible, Acceptable being average, or Troll, which is the lowest and failing grade. More information will be available at the beginning of the testing on the 1st of April. All 8th year students will meet at the edge of the forest in order to cheer on your classmates. Anyone caught interrupting or interfering with the test will receive an immediate Troll with no chance for re-testing.”
Draco stares at the paper for longer than necessary, trying to make sense of the words. Since the war ended, he’s had trouble reading. He’s not quite sure why, but perhaps it’s his anxiety or maybe he’s going fucking insane, but he has to scan through it for quite some time before the meaning takes hold.
The song pervades his nightmares as the memories flash up, back from the place he’d locked them away. He sees Voldemort’s hand wrapped tight around the hilt of Lucius’ wand as it pressed Dark Magic into the skin of Draco’s forearm, dark-marking him as tainted forever more. The moment he was Marked will haunt him like nothing else. The pain, the disconnect, the smell, all trivial in comparison to the real truth. The knowledge and implications of what it meant to wear this tattoo burned him as much as the
“Do you think it’ll calm down? All the...hullabaloo.”
“The tree has empathy? It grieves?”
“Will we be permitted to retest if we’re removed?” Hermione asks and McGonagall raises her eyebrows.
Everyone he loves that is dead died because of him. Remus and Sirius and Tonks and Fred and Colin and Harry’s mum and dad. They all died because of him, because he was the saviour of the wizarding world.
Once he’s good again, he kisses Harry so passionately he inadvertently moans against Draco's mouth. He’s going to come so fast. Hopefully, Draco won’t take the piss out of him for it later.
Only when he’s standing on the precipice does he remember McGonagall’s words from the night prior. Forbidden from leaving the castle.
“I only care about you being alright,” he says softly. “That you’re safe. That no one’s hurting you.”
The dragon from the
“Because McGonagall asked you to,” Hermione says gently, “and because you didn’t want You-Know-Who to ruin one more thing in your life.”
Draco’s face is shocked and strangely worried. Like he’s afraid Harry’s going to go back to them or something, but he would never do that. He’d rather sleep in a gutter than go back to that tiny box of a room, to the hours spent cleaning, to never being good enough.
“You don’t know it?” Draco’s looking up at him. “Muggles don’t have this one?”
“Lovely,” Draco says pleasantly, opening the window to let in the cool, September breeze.
“But what would they say?”
Draco nods and Harry manages to drink the rest of his hot coffee in one sip before he stands up and leads Draco down the halls and up the stairs to the old Astronomy Tower. The damage is severe and it shifts wildly in the wind, but Harry and Draco move without fear.
Then Pigwidgeon is flying in at full speed, a letter clutched in his tiny feet. He pirouettes and lands elegantly on Hermione’s wrist, dropping the letter in her lap.
That night when Harry’s pressed up against Draco’s side in his bed, he turns to look at him. His eyes are open and he’s staring up at the stars on the ceiling, tears trailing down the sides of his cheeks silently. His chest is rising and falling rapidly, but he makes no sound, gives no sign of his distress.
Somehow, Ron lets him go. He gives him a hug, tries to tease him about the slight beard he’s got going on from not shaving, and says he’ll send the gifts over to Malfoy’s this time. Says he loves him and then sends him on his way.
Whose voice is that? Whose arms are around him?
“I’m gonna...Harry, I’m going to…” He says breathlessly, but Harry doesn’t stop.
“It’s good to see you, Harry,” she says, looking like she really means it. “Have you and Draco been on the same diet? You’re both scarily thin.”
Draco’s never done this before.
Harry’s been so busy, so anxious, so worried, that he hadn’t thought about food. That happens to him a lot now, being too sick with life to eat, but today his stomach is cramping in hunger, so he knows something has changed.
“Yes, that arsehole.”
Harry wakes up screaming.
keeps their body heat in, but Harry’s still anxiety-sweating. He really needs a fucking drink or something. God.
“I will be around to assist you, as will the other professors, in preparing you for your weekend, but your Head of House, so to speak, will be Professor Trelawney. More rules will be published as the ministry decides on them, so please await further instructions. Now, as for your partners, the list goes as follows…”
It’s a slight sound, a waver in his facade, and Harry grabs onto it like a lifeline. Draco is not as untouchable as he seems, not as inhuman as his face may seem. Harry can do this.
He gets up and digs through his trunk, looking for something he hasn’t touched all year, out of sheer desperation. Something he’d avoided looking at or thinking about, because it reminds him so deeply of tragedy. Even the texture of it makes his skin crawl and bile rise in the back of his throat. His head feels light, dizzy, strange when he unfolds the paper and he pauses so he doesn’t faint.
And finally, nothing at all.
“Bloody hell,” Ron curses. “Why is it
Ron’s sort of bobbing to the beat in place of dancing, so Harry tries to engage him. Notices the glint of the silver band on Hermione’s finger from across the way and physically can't stop himself. Is just drunk enough to have no control over his mouth, no filter.
From that height, it might kill him. Or he might break a couple bones.
would burn Crabbe alive two years later.
Draco’s as quiet as a church mouse most of the time now, so Harry doesn’t have to worry about fights or angry words or his stupid entitlement. He doesn’t really talk to anyone besides Pansy and he, too, is looking worse for wear.
“Harry,” Luna says softly, “are you okay?”
She washes her hands at the sink, smiling down at the drain, and then she walks out into the next room. Harry’s still pressing out little men in gingerbread and piling them messily on metal sheets, but he’s curious. And then the music starts.
in his stomach, he’d vomit it up.
He places his lips on Harry’s nipple, enveloping it in the heat of his mouth, which causes him to moan again. Draco grins and circles his tongue as he strokes Harry, which is too much and not enough at the same time.
on him when he wants to feel nothing but the bite of cold, winter wind.
“Christ.”
“I don’t think so, no. Professor Sprout said it’s just a reaction.”
“What if we get into trouble?” Hermione asks. “Or something hurts us?”
But he can’t avoid it now, can he? Draco will just traipse after him out into the forest, putting the both of them in even more danger than they already are.
“Draco, go back to sleep.”
that?
“Where do you usually spend Christmas, Harry?” Narcissa asks as she pours sugar into a bowl.
for that!”
Draco doesn’t move an inch. Doesn’t even blink.
“Who else would it be?”
Hermione begins to share his worry as they read about lethifolds that hunt you in your sleep and runespoors with venomous fangs and incredible intelligence. They look for ways to fight off these creatures and come up almost completely empty handed.
“Can I show you something?” Draco asks softly, looking angelic in the refrigerator light.
He hasn’t really laughed in such a long time that he never wants to stop. Draco’s giving him this look like he’s half cracked, and maybe he is. Maybe he has been for a long time and no one around him has had the heart to tell him.
“Wanted one last look of the pitch. It’s one of the few places not tainted with bad shit.”
Harry springs into action; He has to find Draco!
Draco takes a moment to recover, breathing so heavily Harry’s momentarily afraid he’s had a heart attack. Merlin, would that be a story. Rita Skeeter would have fun with that one:
The song is about someone lurking in the window, watching through the glass. It’s about slaughtering animals to feast upon, about the perils of surviving a lonely and frozen Icelandic winter.
He’s winded almost immediately, gasping as he tries to stay upright, but he laughs despite himself. Free. He feels fucking free.
“What do they do?” Harry’s not sure if it’s the drama of the whole thing, but his stomach begins to turn.
He thinks of a small apartment in a city far from here, Quebec maybe, or maybe somewhere warm like Barcelona. He thinks of the small, one-bedroom flat he’d share with his boyfriend. Of the odd jobs he’d do to supplement his income, magical and muggle alike. Maybe he’d come back here in a couple decades when he can bear the memories of the place and teach. Maybe he’ll get married. He’ll wear a dark coloured suit, fitted to his body, and Draco will wear emerald green. When they kiss, Harry will say something snarky like “Can’t call me Potter now, can you?” or vise-versa. They’ll both get the help they need. Everything will turn out alright.
“I see. And you didn’t disobey my orders?”
“What do the Muggles call it again? Mari-Mari…?”
He sees Hermione and Ron on the map before he sees them in person, sitting on the chairs in the 8th year common room, and sighs. As he passes them, he listens to what they’re saying, because, why not? They haven’t spoken to him since before Christmas anyway.
He cries out at the sight of a black silhouette standing over Harry, skeleton hands outstretched towards him, as Harry screams for Draco to run with his final breath of air. The fire burns out and Draco thinks of Crabbe who perished in the
“Thanks.”
“Fuck I can’t remember the exact details, but they’re poison!” Draco rummages through the backpack frantically as Harry’s head starts to spin.
A Patronus may work against the lethifold, but it hunts while its prey is sleeping, so it’s pretty impossible to use. A runespoor? Who fucking knows.
Do normal people leave children in the care of abusive guardians? Set them up the die alone?
“She Floo-d in when McGonagall said you’d gone missing. Special permissions.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wakey wakey,” says Ron, a shadow against the bright light. “Time to go hunt down Malfoy.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron says as they approach the door. “Could they try any harder to be so freaky?”
“It’s okay. Harry, I’ve got you.”
Draco sits upright, gripping his sleeping bag to his chest like a damsel in distress. “Absolutely not!”
Harry narrows his eyes and presses his lips together firmly. Arsehole.
She promptly exits, along with the other professors, leaving the 8th years to follow them out.
Falling is easier and faster than waiting for death itself, but getting some cigarettes will feel better and quell the shaking of his hands and the cramping of his stomach. Oh, the choices!
“It doesn’t matter. None of this matters. I have to go,
“Then come here.”
“I am glad you are okay, Mr. Potter,” she says softly, like she’s speaking to a friend she hasn’t seen in quite some time. Like Harry was her friend a long time ago and she’s forgotten how to talk with him. “But you are forbidden from leaving the castle until further notice.”
At least Draco’s in the same boat.
“I need to trim it, that’s for sure.”
Hermione apologizes again, pleading her case, but Harry’s already forgiven her. He played as much a part in this as she did, plus she didn’t do the asking anyway. She embraces him and, this time, he has the energy to hug her back. It feels like coming home after a long, difficult day.
He says forcefully.
Studying. Harry pauses for only a second more to stare at the thin, silver band on Hermione’s ring finger before he books it out the door and into the hallway. The door, no longer the portrait of the fat lady in the pink dress, opens quietly and shuts soundlessly. The new portrait, a woman with eyes like a lion and a dress made from striped animal fur, looks around after the door shuts and scowls. Says something in a language Harry doesn’t speak that is probably an insult.
Draco is at Harry’s side, also staring at Susan Bones’ dumb newspaper with a look of resigned horror on his face. Harry wants to say something, wants to make Rita Skeeter shut the fuck up about stuff she doesn’t know about, but what could he really do? Try and lock her in a jar like Hermione had? Tell Draco it’s all a lie?
"It has been a tumultuous journey, full of tragedy and war and difficult choices, but you have come out of it as grown men. I hope you take the momentum from your incredible and successful journey through the Forbidden Forest and put it to good use. Your success, as well as the success of your fellow 8th years, is also a memorium. It is in memory of those who fought for you to have the chance to take your final exams, to live your lives. It’s in memory of all of those who died during the war and the final battle here on the Hogwarts grounds. Your fellow 8th years, who gave their lives protecting this place, will be memorialized forever in your success, so do something worthy of their sacrifices with the opportunity.
The song, a lullaby, fills his ears and chokes him like two tight hands around his throat, like a constrictor boa wrapped around his esophagus, popping blood vessels and arteries until he’s just a suffocated carcass, a body on the ground. He can remember the sound of Voldemort singing the song to Nagini, the snake who he trusted enough to be his Horcrux, as her body constricted around Draco’s mother’s body, enough to easily kill her.
Narcissa sighs a little dramatically and pats him on the hand, smudging him with flour.
After all, he can’t run from his past anymore than he could run from his future.
“Let’s find a safe place.”
After the war, they both received a stipend from the Department of Magic, as did Harry and every other child who played a part in the final War. It’s enough money to build a life on and it seems Hermione and Ron are doing just that.
The map comes to life under his wand and the breath catches in his chest as the nicknames rise to the surface.
Harry feels his fear like a bezoar at the back of his throat, gagging him, suffocating him, killing him.  “Of course.”
“What’s the worst that happens?”
alone. Sometimes...Sometimes it’s easier to leave than to
“God damn it!” He cries out.
He brushes the jinx off easily and then casts,
“I deserved that. It was just the first time anyone ever really said no to me, you know? Of course, after that, I wasn’t babied as much by my parents. They, or, well, my father, I mean...He really started to lay into me when I started Hogwarts. Wanted me to be perfect. Act perfect.
she truly enjoyed. The house had been dead inside, much like Draco himself, because no one dared oppose Voldemort, their dark Lord.

Harry rolls his shoulder a little and puts on his brave face as Draco stares at him, a strange contemplative look on his face.
Avada Kedavra. If it would even work.
Malfoy pushes open the door and inside is simple and efficient. Their trunks are already placed at the ends of two new beds with knitted blankets on top, woven with all the house colours, and there are windows at the head of each bed. There’s a carpet in the center of the room, embroidered with a new motto: on est tous unis sous Hogwarts .
He starts to rock back on his heels, trying anything to push down the noise, but he can’t.
“I can’t do this.” Harry can’t.
Breakfast is a loud and cheerful affair. Sterling says everyone is talking about how well they did and how they should be so proud, like their worst fears weren’t shown on what was essentially live Hogwarts TV. But Harry isn’t concerned with that when Draco takes his hand and doesn’t seem to want to let go.
Luna just wants to show Harry photographs of her Narkskulls or whatever and Pansy wants to master making antidotes from scratch for the venomous beings out in the Forbidden Forest. That’s all Harry has to do and be when he’s around them and he can do that most days.
“Bloody starved,” Ron says dramatically, reaching out to shake Narcissa’s outstretched hand. “Thanks for the invitation.”
“Looking for actually edible food,” he says haughtily, rolling his eyes. “Not that you’d know what that looks like.”
“What are you
He slowly slips off Draco’s pajamas, leaving him in just his dark blue underpants. He presses his lips against the outline, hard already, and mouths him through the fabric. Draco moans at once, hands squeezing the duvet, and Harry continues, licking his dick until Draco’s pleading for more.
“Yeah, yeah.”
“‘Course. You do the same.”
“Are you alright? You look…”
So he goes about the motions of this new existence he calls his. Thankfully, his mother is more understanding than ever and allows him to grieve his loss from the darkness of his bedroom. He doesn’t leave except to use the bathroom and to sneak out into the halls to listen to his mother and Patches play eerie songs on the piano that echo throughout the manor like an elegy for Draco’s broken heart.
He raises his wand, breath shaking, heart hammering, and says, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
Either way, he has to do something about it, because it’s getting out of hand.
“I want everyone to know that I’m not a girl!” She cheers, looking perhaps a bit nervous. “Or, well, I guess I never was one. Call me Sterling, alright? My entire family already does!”
He shakes his head and then jumps into the deeper end of the bath to wash his hair. It’s so long now he feels he should find a tie to put it up. But then everyone would see the lightning bolt scarred into his forehead, something he’s worked very hard to keep covered, and it would defeat the purpose.
They give one another hugs again and then the Weasleys are off, too, leaving just the original trio behind.
He curls around himself, arms to his chest, and he shakes with waves of tears like a tsunami destroying anything in its path. Like a hurricane bashing a coast to pieces. A tornado tearing shit up and dropping it thousands of kilometres away.
“What?” He scowls.
When Draco manages to open his eyes to see the source of the song and of his paralyzing fear, the fire’s almost gone out. Burnt down to smoulders and ash in the presence of the dark creature. A dementor.

It's adorable.
“You have a lovely home,” Hermione says, even though she’s been here before. “Was that

full of songs that inspired this fic, in case you were curious. I'll link the songs in the fic, too, in case you don't use Spotify!
It’s done so quickly that Draco doesn’t even have time to react, no time to evade. He freezes up, frozen totally, and all the fruits fall from his arms.
a time-telling spell with a clockwise circular motion like a clock arm ticking, when he begins to feel like the night will never end, and realizes it’s almost 3. The witching hour, as the stories go. He imagines it will be the worst time in the forest. The most brutal. The darkest.
Harry’s just vomited into the toilet when she’s rapping her knuckles on the door to call him and Draco down. He’s had a particularly volatile nightmare about a juvenile nundu who stalked him through the night, silent as a cat, until he was too weak to go on. Just as the creature stepped over his exhausted body, it breathed toxic cat breath into his face. The smell combined with the knowledge that his death was imminent—whether from the infectious disease in the air or the
They’ve spent many wordless nights up here, sitting on the rickety edge, wondering what bad thing would happen to them next. Wondering if the building would finally crumble and bring their sufferings to an end.
“Good thing I do a sick
“What?” Harry asks, sounding annoyed and curt.
Harry this.
It’s only when he settles down beside Harry that Harry realizes how exhausted he is. His eyelids droop helplessly as Malfoy turns to him, holds one thin brittle hand in his.
The lullaby continues, eerie and nauseating, until Draco is incomprehensibly lost. He shakes and rocks himself on the forest floor, whimpering in instinctual fear.
Harry presses his cheek into the pillow, hand still clutched in Draco’s, and shuts his eyes. The relief of the action is immeasurable. A few moments later, when he’s almost asleep, he feels Draco’s lips on his forehead.
Then Hermione shows up, looking so full of life that it actually hurts to look at her. Like the sun, she burns too bright, is too full of life for someone as dead as Harry.
stands not 10 yards from Harry and Draco, sucking all the life out of them with just its presence.
Harry folds it into a square and slips it into the owl’s foot. The owl shoots off, fast as lightning, and is gone in seconds.
“Yeah.”
Eventually, Harry is too tired to go on. His stomach, which is usually easily ignored, grumbles ferociously and he needs to rest.
Something really bad could happen to Draco.
Harry’s never heard such an entrancing sound. Beautiful. He kisses this once more, before lowering himself back down to take Draco into his mouth.
Patches answers to Harry’s reluctant knock. He grins up at him, all blue eyed and crooked teeth, and hugs his legs tight.
Harry’s so anxious his heart pounds in his ears. His lungs are on fire.
Harry rather enjoys the lighter course load, if he’s being honest. He has so much free time now to not sleep and to wake up screaming from nightmares when he does and to go days without dinner because he’s repulsed by the thought of eating when so many people are dead and their bodies were laid upon the stone in the Great Hall where he sits. He has so many hours to fill with empty stares and meaningless words and the feeling that nothing really matters anyway, so why keep trying? He loves enjoying time by himself and time spent silently tiptoeing around Malfoy because they’re both apparently so fucked up that they scream bloody murder in the middle of the night.
“Wizards are weird, too.”
The motion he’s almost sure is an x where the bottom meets and crosses over. ૪ He practices it with his wand, hoping it will give him an idea and then it does! It comes from a Swahili word!
“Can’t you cast it from here?”
Draco says nothing, just blinks and blinks and blinks until Harry realizes he’s crying. Harry automatically touches his own face, feeling cold despite the
“Harry,” he’s so caught off guard that he doesn’t even know what to say, “I just asked her—”
He hadn’t realized it in the moment, but the argument took a lot out of him. Poor Draco had been dealing with this for months, all alone as he was abused every single day, because Harry rarely went to class or meals with him. That ends now.
“That’s crazy. It’s just a tree, Potter!”
in happiness. In pure, unadulterated joy.
Then, a whisper so soft it makes almost no noise at all.
“Harry!” He says happily. “You have returned!”
“Harry,” Narcissa says warmly, standing from the piano bench mid-song, dressed in an elegant gown made of delicately spun gold silk. “I’m so happy you’ve returned.”
Harry is shaking now, just a little. Maybe it’s from the weed or the panic or the anxiety, but he can’t stop the trembling in his hands. Ron's cheeks are red with impatience and fury.
Harry’s heart is pounding loud in his tired ears as he sees all of the Weasleys gathered in the corridor, looking around worriedly and talking rapidly as they search hiding holes and empty classrooms.
Harry brushes it off as nonsense, isn’t worried about it at all, because he’s just spent two bloody weeks at new Malfoy Manor and seen nothing worrying at all. He outwardly expresses this to anyone who will listen, because the Malfoys are changing, becoming better, and he doesn't like that their progress is being disregarded entirely based on tactless articles and nonsense writings.
The thought of signing his name for fame, of posing for photographs, after all those people fucking died makes him literally, physically ill, so he just pretends he can’t hear them as they shout after him and beg for his attention. Feels faint as he pushes past the disposable Muggle cameras and the quills in his face to find Hermione in her own car with Neville and Luna.
“I can’t sleep,” he pronounces as he falls into a chair near the bed, basically saying he missed Harry's presence. “I’ve spent three months listening to someone else breathe and talk and stuff and the silence is deafening.”
Draco’s screaming. He’s screaming and thrashing and Harry’s awake, staring up at the ceiling, because he can’t bring himself to get up. He can’t see anything in the darkness but the glint of his glasses on his bedside table, so he reaches for them, puts them on. Stands up.
“Sure.”
He just hopes maggots don’t come out of the end of his wand to devour him like they did to Raczidian.
He thought he’d be a nervous wreck the morning of his exam, shaking and sweating and vomiting, but he’s calm. Irreverent, even, to the importance of this day.
Draco looks so beautiful that Harry leans in just enough to show that if he’s okay with it, so is Harry. Harry’s the one who has been drinking, albeit not much, but the choice is up to Draco. He’s the one most affected by the stigma, the rumours of treachery and backstabbing.
Harry nods, though he’s not sure he quite believes him.
but he leans against Draco’s arm anyway. Snow starts to fall gently from the sky and Draco wraps an arm around Harry to draw him closer to him.
He can’t do this alone. He can’t keep going like this, knowing he’s alone in the world, waking himself up from nightmares with blood in his mouth, on his hands, cold and shaking and alone. Can’t handle smoking off the tower with no one to cast a
“Harry,” he says firmly, “let’s go.”
“I know.”
“Draco,” Harry touches his arm gently, “it’s okay. It’s just a dream.”
“He’s not our enemy anymore; he’s one of us, not a Death Eater at all.”
“You look rough, mate.”
a lot, the both of us, together, so don’t get any ideas, alright? We’re sticking this out together.”
“The tree…” He grows quiet, solemn. “It weeps when you take its fruit.”
It’s the first moment that Harry realizes he cares deeply about Draco’s well-being. The realization was inevitable, of course, but still hard to swallow. Another person in Harry’s life that he’s destined to fail at protecting. The thought makes him shake with anxiety.
A sixth year boy is sneering down at him, dressed in Gryffindor red and gold, saying, “Traitorous scum. Should’ve died in the war like all your Death Eater friends.”
“Harry,” he says, looking frazzled and surprisingly good.
When the sun rises, Draco’s eyes always water and there’s nothing he can do to stop it, so he just. Cries. As sunlight warms his numb and lonely body, frozen by the still icy winds, feeling nothing and everything all at once. Like a fleck of sand on a beach, alone in his differences, tormented eternally by destructive waves, forever lost among other things.
The trees weeping has diminished somewhat, enough that Harry can think again, but grief fills them both. At another loss, with more blood on Harry’s already blood soaked hands.
“Follow me.”
Surprisingly, Harry’s relieved. Ron is growing up, changing, evolving right in front of everyone’s eyes. The changes look good on him, like he’s recovering in all the ways Harry isn’t.
The day Draco sees a small, feathery owl fly into the manor, he slips off of the roof and almost drops his Walkman to its death. He hangs onto the edge and contemplates if it really matters if he falls or not. Perhaps to his mother it would, but she would recover. She’d get over the betrayal of his suicide or accident or whatever it would be labelled as as she has the betrayal from her husband.
But because he’s a Malfoy and he has too much pride to die falling off an icy roof like Father Christmas after one too many glasses of spiked milk, he summons his broom and saves his own arse. When he manages to return to his room, he’s in a proper state and frenzied.
“Mother, do you remember that Muggle song you used to sing to me? For Christmas?” Draco has this look in his eyes that makes Harry want to want to smile.
razor sharp teeth and claws—woke him up violently, scrambling up from the bed, and immediately forced bile into his throat.
“Oh, we’ll be down soon, yeah. Thanks, Ron.”
“I don’t want to be the talk of the town. I just want a quiet life. A simple existence.”
“You’re an idiot, Potter,” is all Draco says, looking up at Harry, who is half on top of him in concern, and blinks. Then he surges up, wraps one hand around Harry’s neck, and pulls him down into a hot kiss.
“Hi,” he whispers and his entire face is lit perfectly by the moonlight creeping in from the window beside their bed.
“Lovely night,” is all Draco says, smelling of weed and fresh flowers and cold air.
“Harry, we need to talk.”
He’s witness to it firsthand two days after another article is released. He’s walking with Draco, standing close enough that their arms touch as they move, not saying a word. They do this a lot now, this quiet company-thing, so no one looks surprised, but it still feels new. Maybe the newness comes from the new, light feeling in Harry’s chest as he bumps against Malfoy’s shoulder or the way his breath catches at every soft smile Draco’s willing to give him.
So Harry shrugs his shoulders, heaves out a heavy breath, and casts the circular spell.
of marijuana, Harry!”
the voice sings.
Draco gasps, shooting backwards across the ground in shock, and stares wide-eyed at a creature made of white rippling light like the flames in a fire.
Harry notices that Draco doesn’t agree or disagree, just stays silent and leans into Harry’s side, but it’s good enough, for now. Harry wraps him up in his arms as the sun shines warm against their backs. The day is so young, but Harry feels incredibly old, like an elderly man aged by time and by pain, closer to his death than his birth.
“Spears. You’ll love her.” Harry’s smile is real now, because he’s laughing.
“Okay, okay. Maybe we’re all weird.”
“Any luck-enhancing potions are not allowed and are considered illicit for these—and most other—intents and purposes. That is why you don’t have access to all of the ingredients, Mr. Corner. For any potion deemed necessary by the Ministry, you’ve had the supplies and recipe necessary to brew it in the potions classroom.”
Harry grins back, laughing harshly into Draco’s ear.
“What were you doing?”
There’re stars up on the ceiling, real constellations like the ones in the skies, that McGonagall must have charmed up there. He thinks of Sirius and how his namesake came from the stars and how he’s gone like the star is, too. How everything has an end, even things that may be otherwise thought of as infinite. Eternal. Immortal.
McGonagall sighs a little, deflates. Loses a bit of the pride that was shown so plainly on her face.
I keep extending the book, because my life is chaos and I can't stop writing lmao. Here's this, the second to last chapter, I promise!
Harry leans up to give Draco another kiss, unable to resist, and strokes him while their mouths clash together. Draco can barely kiss he’s such a wreck, but Harry persists. He twists his wrist a little, getting a slightly better angle for the both of them, and then Draco moans fully. Loudly.
“I love you, you know that?” Draco says softly. “Even if you’re an arsehole who keeps almost dying.”
“What?” He’s too high for this.
“Draco,” he whispers and his voice, like his heart, is weak and distraught. “Come here.”
“It’s illegal to play Knock Out Ginger. Do you have that game?”
He misses everyone so wholly that he has to stop for a second to recover. He wants to see Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, wants to go back to the Burrow and fit back in like a missing piece into a puzzle, but knows he can’t burden them with whatever is fucking wrong with him. He won’t do that to them after what they’ve gone through. After losing Fred, after George's wounds that won’t even really heal, after all that pain Harry himself has caused them.
Time begins to fly by. Now that Harry has made a point out of showing how forgiven Draco truly is, no one bothers him. No one even looks at him anymore, which relieves Harry to no end.
“Don't you know I’m fearless? I think I can handle it.”
He doesn’t even have the energy to be upset about it today. McGonagall clears her throat and draws Harry back in.
Harry embraces Draco, laughing and smiling, because he fucking did it. He succeeded! Draco hugs him back, tears in his eyes, and says how he can’t believe it. It was well-deserved. He did save Harry’s life multiple times. The students cheer for him, so loud is deafening.
“Then I like it short, too. Reminds me of that boy I used to know.”
“Congratulations!” Says the headmistress, smiling resolutely at the two of them.
Harry had been similarly consumed, but only really dreamt of Malfoy during sixth year when he watched him on the map religiously. He knew Draco had been watching him, but not to the same extent Harry had been watching him. Both had been trying to foil the other’s plans, had been wondering what the other was doing, were obsessed with getting to know exactly what the other was planning.
A huge, looming figure that crushes the ground beneath its hooves. Like a moose, but with antlers as gnarled and crisscrossed as tree branches.
Draco sits up, disoriented but so fucking relieved. He throws his arms around Potter recklessly, toppling them both over, and squeezes him as tightly as he can. He's out of breath immediately, but can't be concerned with that.
“I wish I’d just died in that fucking forest and saved the both of us a lot of pain.”
He gets lost in the words for a moment, spinning in one spot to try and regain his footing, but he can’t. Not with those awful words being said around him at an impossible volume. Louder and louder and louder until he can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t do anything but fall to his knees and clap his hands over his ears to try and block out the sounds as the children surround him. He wants to scream to drown out the noise of hateful words, but how could any sound he makes be as loud as these? As the accusations?
“What?” He turns in the rubble. “No, no. It’s not about that. It’s got to be that leucrotta that finally hunted us down, looking for scraps and whatnot.”
Draco lights the fuck up at the song choice and Harry drags him up towards the center of the room when people start to dance. The lights are dimmed and someone must cast a
The puff solidifies into a creature, which is something he hadn’t expected, and the animal rears back with pointed wings, charging head on into the darkness. As it nears Harry and the dementor, its light brightens the scene. Skeleton fingers press in Harry’s gaunt cheeks as the dark creature sucks the life out of the boy Draco so desperately loves and he cries out as his brave little Patronus, a sparrow of all things, flies straight into the heart of the dementor. The goodness and purity of the tiny little bird burns bright inside the dementor’s chest, blinding Draco as Harry drops to the ground, and the soul-sucking being and the patronus burst into a blinding flash of light and disappear. Evaporate.
Harry looks up at her with wide, panicked eyes. Trapped inside these aching halls, being crushed by all the deaths. No escape. No escape. No escape.
He gives his head a strong shake and casts the quieting charm,
Perhaps they’ve given him the O simply on principal. After all, he did eat poisonous apples and was completely unaware of the effects. Then again, he did use multiple spells, so perhaps that made up for it.
to die. He just wants the pain, the memories, the ache of his losses, to stop. He doesn’t want it to hurt anymore.
Draco’s an expert with the bathtub, so Harry lets him pick the settings. Something smelling sharp and woodsy that bubbles softly and turns the water a soft blue. Awesome.
He’s alone in his bed, fingers clutching the sheets in panic, body covered in sweat, throat raw from shouting.
to see the damage, to see if his boyfriend is still alive.
“Weasley and Granger, I presume.” Her calm is unsettling.
Harry is so sad at the thought that they both had to suffer so terribly to get here. So sad and so relieved that they're both still here.
“I don’t know why you came here,” Draco says softly, like he’s in pain. “I told you not to come for me.”
“And he just couldn’t do it anymore.”
The map is inaccurate now, what with the new additions to Hogwarts during its reconstruction. Someone will have to fix the map to honour the memory of those who put in so much work to create it. Maybe one day he will. Maybe his children will. Maybe it will rot into nothingness in a trunk like Harry had planned for it to.
Harry turns towards Draco to ask and is shocked to see him rocking back and forth with his hands covering his ears. He’s mumbling to himself, eyes slammed shut, as he rocks almost in tune with the words of the song, tears streaming down his face.
Thanks for reading and all that. Epilogue is being edited as we speak, so expect it within 24-48 hours!
No answer. He sits up, feeling fine despite poisoning himself, and casts a
“Hermione?” He whispers and she squeezes him tighter at how weak he probably sounds.
Draco leads Harry through the corridors of new Malfoy Manor as Narcissa talks with Hermione and Ron. Draco doesn’t pause to make sure he’s following or to see if he’s wandered off, because he knows Harry knows this place. He spent two weeks here with them and knows a lot more about them than they do about Harry.
Then Harry’s name appears in the same brilliant light.
Let me know what you think??? Sometimes it feels a bit like I'm writing to myself lmfaoo
Harry’s already got another mouthful of apple, but he swallows it anyway. It’s
He has to! He didn’t come this far to die on the verge of graduating, on moving on with his wretchedly tortured existence, and Draco will be damned if he plays another part in the death of Harry Potter.
A day back from the Winter holiday and The Prophet publishes an article about the supposed reemergence of the death eaters and cites the new Malfoy mansion as their newest local hangout. Ridiculous.
like a petulant child, but he can never return, never do that much damage to an already damaged boy who obviously deserves much better.
“You were awake?” Draco’s mouth is tense.
Malfoy lifts an elegant eyebrow and moves forward, up the brand new stairs and down a long corridor. Harry sees doors, but none say their names until the last one on the right.
When Harry and his friends show up to the Malfoys, it’s quiet. The house flickers with candlelight and soft, delicate
Perhaps it is the influence of the tree keeping watch over them or another of the forest’s malevolent creatures, but the song still fills the entire woods. It’s all around Harry, filling in empty spaces of white noise with its destitute words.
“Do you remember…?”
No one interferes with either of their downward spirals. No one asks, no one tells. Harry and Draco are just two more casualties in the war that, apparently, will never end. Not for them.
“Me murder you?” Draco scoffs, practically balking. “Please. I’m
He takes another drink of water from his thermos and prepares himself. Readies his wand as the forest comes alive. He hears the thump of paws and hooves in the distance like he had before, but he’s more aware now. Exhausted, but awake.
Light white smoke pours from his wand like a cotton ball or candy floss. He’s never felt so brave, thinking of Harry’s face and of all their friends’ cheers when they survive this hell, and it shows when he manages to successfully cast a patronus for the first time ever.
She has a lovely singing voice.
“This year,” the Headmistress starts to say, “will be a little bit different. I was...The rules were predetermined by some of the specialists at the Ministry of Magic. I had some input, but they considered all the facts and made their own conclusions on what might be best for you as a whole.”
Harry’s name whispers around him through the crowd. Then he hears Malfoy’s. Hears
“Patches, dear, would you tell Draco his guests have arrived?”
The spell points them through a thicket of what seems to be raspberry bushes, except the raspberries are baby pink and hum when Harry brushes a hand over the branches. Spooky. He’s tired and exhausted, but he fills with adrenaline when he sees the unicorn statue. Brilliant!
Hermione’s in a similar state to Draco, bent over a book the size of an encyclopaedia and somehow simultaneously trying to get Harry’s attention with apologies and pleading words. It won’t work. Harry may be off his rocker, but he can still certainly still hold a grudge.
And so they start their hike. Hand in hand, guiding each other into the webbed darkness, they begin their ascent.
Harry removes his wand from his pocket and casts
He has to come up with a lie. A lie. He can do that.
Harry smiles, looks down at Draco’s bare chest, at the deep scars from the spell that he cast. If only he’d known what that spell did before he’d used it. If only Snape hadn’t put it in that damned book to begin with. Harry presses his hands against Draco’s shoulders, laying him down, and leans in to kiss Draco’s chest, kiss the raised scars that his anger had so rashly caused. He kisses them like it can undo all the harm, all the pain, all the scarring. Like he can erase the bad parts and keep the good.
Harry stumbles to his feet, bumping hard into Draco and falling to his arse. From there, he scuttles back on hand and knee, terrified at what he knows is coming.
Harry takes a step back from him, back from this coward who used to be his best friend.
Harry James Potter: Outstanding
Bastard.
with a harsh downward flick of his wand. The forest sounds continue, but the singing dulls enough so Harry can think again. The song continues on, though it’s much quieter, it is equally as eerie as before.
was that?” Is all Draco can manage. “You can cast a fucking
The new Common Room is sort of plain, Harry thinks, in comparison to the Gryffindor one. It doesn’t have the history of books on tables and feet on couches and bright gold paint cracked in corners with age. It is brand new, never used, and embellished with a rainbow of House colours.
He lets her hug him, but doesn’t hold her back. Can’t really feel his arms to do so even if he wanted to.
Harry nods, continues following Draco through a door and out onto a patio. There are rows and rows of magical plants out here, growing despite the cold because of charms placed on them, glowing under the brilliant winter moon.
“It is. But in the winter, mother grows poinsettias, which are almost as nice.”
He packs a bowl at the top of the Old Astronomy Tower and then promptly smokes the entire thing, feeling like he weighs a tonne and nothing at the same time. Then he stands on the edge of the crumbling building and kicks some rocks down. Contemplates what would happen to him if he fell that far.
“In some ways, you’ve paid too much,” Draco admits softly, “and in others, you haven’t even started. So pay up, Potter.”
There’s a new sound in the distance. It’s almost like a weeping woman, shrieking in loss or grief or pain. Obviously not Draco, but still, who or what could it be? It sounds so haunting it chills him to his bones.
Harry and Draco. Outstanding, together. As it should be.
It feels so good just to laugh! He can’t imagine why people don’t laugh all the time. Hermione would say it releases endorphins or dopamine or something scientific like that if she were here and still speaking to Harry.
“All kinds of stuff. The Weird Sisters, Britney Spears, Smashmouth. Good shit, you know?”
He thinks he’s doing Harry a favour, but he’s actually committing a crime worse than the treason he’d committed during the war. He’s leaving a friend when they’re most in need.
“Yes. With Fang and Hagrid and the centaur, yeah. I remember.” Draco’s voice is tight.
“Good lad,” Harry says lightly.
So he just kisses him with all the feelings he doesn’t have words for. Kisses him and holds his hips with his hands, fingers just sort of lingering underneath his shirt. Draco’s mouth is unrelenting and hot and Harry’s just so in love with him that it physically hurts.
“Attention students,” McGonagall announces, “all 8th year students must proceed out to the forest’s edge at this time. All other students are to head to their next class as scheduled.”
He desperately wants a coffee with some cream. The luxuries of his existence, he supposes.
Harry looks down to try and understand that. These plangentine trees cry for their young when they’re taken, weep in grief, are capable of understanding the implications of the fruit’s disappearance. Harry immediately knows he can’t eat those. He won’t.
The students clap loudly for them and the other 8th years cheer, because, despite the odds being against it, they actually survived in there.
He watches the sun rise. He watches the sun set. He gets chilled to the bone every night with no one to cast a
He swallows hard and opens it, biting so hard on his cheek that he actually does taste blood.
“Absolutely.”
“You've heard me?”
Christmases were days Harry spent locked up in the closet until he was brought out to cook dinner. Afterwards, he’d be forced to return to his room as the Dursleys ate their dinner, left only with the smell of the Christmas ham to eat that night.
“You cast a patronus,” Harry says softly. “What were you thinking of?”
Harry turns to his friends who are looking around the room in various emotional states. No one looks quite as upset, though, as Malfoy, whose skin is pinched in between his eyebrows and around his mouth.
“Who’s left to call other than you guys?” He laughs, miserable, thinking of his dead family and of Draco. “Everyone else is dead or gone.”
“No! I’m fine, Ron, alright?”
Draco summons all the courage he can find in his weak body and then shakily rises to his feet in the pitch darkness. He removes his wand from his pocket and tries to think of something. Something that makes him happy. Makes him whole. Makes the world keep on going.
Draco’s eyes dart to Harry’s as if making sure he’s sincere. Harry’s never met anyone as cautious, as hesitant, as he is. It’s sort of refreshing, in a way, to meet someone who doesn’t trust anyone like Harry no longer trusts anyone.
Harry looks out over the Scottish countryside and sighs gently, not noticing the emptiness in his chest for the first time in a long, long time. Maybe it has something to do with the place or the weed or the boy sitting right beside him, but either way, he feels content. Less like he's still at war.
Draco eats a plangentine in the quiet of the forest as they trek their way back to their camp. Harry has nothing to say that Draco will be willing to hear, so it’s better he keeps quiet. Perhaps they’ll stumble back upon the weeping branches of the plangentine tree and Harry can return at least one of the tree's fruits. Maybe then his stomach will relent its tumultuous tumbles.
“Then think about that.”
“Oh, my God.”
“Let’s go to bed,” Ron says and yawns in the middle of his sentence. “I’m knackered.”
After doing all he can, he turns from the tree and uses
Harry’s relieved that he’s not the only one with pieces of the war trapped in his chest like shards of glass. His friends all seem okay for the most part, grieving yes, but not stuck in the loop of war like Harry is. Losing Fred was awful and terrible and so tragic, but Ron is outwardly okay. He doesn’t have dark circles under his eyes or hollows in his cheeks or shake in fear. The only one who’s not okay on the outside is George, but that’s to be expected.
The wind blows harshly, but Harry doesn’t care. Just leans in a little further to Draco’s side to huddle for warmth. He wishes for a blanket, but doesn’t mind not having one.
It helps calm the fire raging in Harry’s chest and brings his body temp down to normal, at least. He feels better, for the most part, and is a little embarrassed about his behaviour.
“As long as I don’t really die, I’m fine with that.” And that’s it, isn’t it?
Harry’s not even sure if he can
true. You’re the only one who really understands me right now.”
“There will be magical healers in the vicinity at all times. If you are seriously injured or in need of help, shoot red sparks into the sky. We are watching, though, so if you somehow are unable to do so, know we’re on our way. Anything that you are unable to heal yourselves will be healed by one of the healers and, for anything that possibly can’t be immediately remedied, you will be removed from the test.”
Tall and skeletal, draped in a ragged black cloak, a
“About what? Being nervous?”
Finally, this is the (almost) end. I split this because there was so much in this last chapter that it was too much. So here's the final chapter and the next one is the epilogue!
“Let’s get baking, then,” Draco says suddenly. “Mother’ll have a fit if we don’t get these done before bedtime.”
to free Draco from his prison. The look on his face says it all and Harry cannot possibly bear this conversation, so he turns and uses his wand to find the correct direction before heading off. Draco follows behind him, as quiet as a church mouse, as the plangentine tree weeps over the senseless murder of her child, over the kidnapping of her children.
Draco grins up at him, cheekbones sharp and angled in the dim light, and leans down to kiss him hard enough that Harry gasps, grasping onto his robes to maintain closeness.
“After you kissed me on the forehead and said that you loved me?!” Harry remembers.
Harry lets him, but only because he has to see his face.
“The headmistress was here?”
In the shadowy light from the moon, Harry watches him. Watches his translucent eyelashes and the shine of his grey eyes. Notices the soft smile on his lips. And can’t help himself, not when Draco’s looking at him like that and there’s nothing and no one to interrupt them.
When he surfaces, he finds Draco’s clean and grinning face just inches from his own. He doesn’t startle, but instead leans in to kiss him very gently on his mouth. Just because he can.
He puts on his shoes, throws on his invisibility cloak over his pajamas, and heads out, creeping quietly through the corridors with the map in his hands like he's in sixth year all over.
Harry has to laugh at the appalled look on Draco’s face. As if he’s ever minded what was illegal before! As if Harry has!
He starts to shriek as the being draws nearer and voices fill his ears as the lullaby swells. Voices of the dead and the dying and the suffering scream and beg and plead.
He sits up, shocked by how real his nightmares still are. It’s been almost a year since the war and he’s still fucking haunted. Still stuck on deaths he’ll never get over. Still trapped in that fucking train station with Dumbledore and no chance of escape.
Then he sees a silver band on Hermione’s finger and knows Ron must have asked her to marry her in his post-war, Voldemort-is-dead bliss without even telling Harry about it.
He presses the fruit, neon orange and slightly oval in shape, against the branch and thinks about something Professor Sprout said once. He remembers nothing about the tree itself, but of another where she cut off one branch and attached it magically back to a different one. As the days went by, the new tree grew two different types of fruit on its branches. But what was the spell she used?
Harry has no idea what Draco could be doing at half 3 in the morning on a cold January night if he’s supposed to have left.
“I brought you something. Maybe it’ll help?” Draco reaches into the bag and pulls out a small glass jar.
Harry’s looking right at Draco when the voice calls out again, from somewhere behind Harry. Singing softly, delicately, Draco says, “Harry, wake up. It’s time to wake up,” without moving his mouth at all.
Draco sighs, furrows his brow, and then returns the arrogant, snarky look as he walks towards Harry. His gate is impeccable, but Harry can see anxiety in his shoulders, in the way he swings his arms. He’s come to know this boy so well that he does it without thinking.
Sterling takes another shot of firewhiskey and
“Attention, students. The scores from yesterday’s test have been decided and will be announced shortly. Before that, I’d like to congratulate Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy on completing their education here at Hogwarts.
Harry lobs a firm, green apple towards Draco and takes a seat beside the fire. His
Harry kisses him again, but Draco pushes him backwards onto the pillows so he can lean up and over him. He looks so beautiful from below.
He sobs and screams and writhes in the agony as the creature stands above him almost, within a metre, and its face is shadowed in darkness. Its nearness to the fire puts it out, blinding Harry to the creature’s true terrifying mask.
And so Harry does. Or he tries, at least.
“We best get dressed, if we want to be on time,” Hermione says succinctly. “Come along.”
“What was that noise? The crying?”
“I trust you.” Terse and unforgiving. Relentless.
Draco sits back against the tent, eyes wide, mouth squeezed shut. He looks terrified and confused.
approval – you know what. He’s just gonna keep that to himself.
Potter will never fall for Draco
Harry laughs and ruffles his hair. “I know just where I’m gonna put it.” He lifts it up. “On my desk at work so I can see it every day.”
He scowls down at his phone. What the fuck is a tax accountant? He shrugs to himself and shoves it back in his pocket.
When they arrive home, they have a few hours to kill, in which Draco cleans up the small flat and makes Scorpius a small snack.
Draco snorts. “Nope. I will take one of your beers though.” He throws himself into the couch sighing heavily. Harry hands him one and they sit in amicable silence while a slightly creepy Claymation movie takes place. He takes a swig and feels his stress melt and a warmth settling in his gut. “How was Scorpius tonight?” He smiles into his lap. “I bet he was absolutely thrilled to see you.”
Harry lets out a small growl before pressing against Draco, hands flying off the counter and clutching the hem of his shirt at his back. Their noses brush and Draco holds his breath. “I can fix it.”
When he clicks on it, it downloads immediately and lights up his screen. It’s a selfie of a scowling Draco Malfoy, with his hair tied back in a knot, a deep blue jumper with a hood and strings, and a pair of casual light jeans ending in a pair of deep brown Merino wool trainers. “Jesus Christ…” He breathes.
When he arrives, Draco is waiting for him in a maroon arm chair reading a book with his legs crossed. He looks better, has more colour to his face. This is what a happy home can do for some people— it can bring them back to life.
Harry can’t wait to sit in a hot bath and then lay in his bed with Draco’s body pressed up against his own. He can’t wait for something to drink that isn’t water, for something to smoke that isn’t hotsy.
“I’m causing too much trouble for you, Potter,” he says, the old nickname sounding fond and sad. So sad. “But unlike before, I know...I know it has to st-op this time.”
“I can’t do it.”
The day after that, McGonagall gathers all the remaining eighth years for a meeting in the common room. She specifically hunts Harry down to make sure he attends, leading him from his now single and half empty bedroom down the stairs to join the others. Harry sits on the stairs as far from everyone else as he can and listens, cloak still clutched in his hands, only vaguely paying attention. His thoughts are on the look on Draco’s face, the shape of his mouth, the emptiness in his eyes. His first thought in a day is more painful than any thought he’s ever had before.
His voice, hollow and fragile, cracks.
He lets the map lead him through the corridors to a secret passageway that he knows leads right out to the pitch. Still, the password rises to the surface as he says it.
The first day will be the hardest, right?
Draco has a harder time with it than Harry thought he would. Mostly because he had assumed incorrectly that Hogwarts was a safe space now when it so obviously isn't.
He searches the old parchment for names, seeing many of his younger classmates in their respective beds, and then spots Draco’s footprints floating around the Quidditch Pitch.
“I know someone who can help you. Wanting to die like that...it’s not normal. Feeling so sick with guilt for simply living is not healthy. You have to work to fix your brain, Harry, just like you would a collapsed lung or a ruptured appendix.”
Harry slips the cloak back over his shoulders as the tears start to fall. He turns and he walks away, waiting until he’s in the safety of the passageway to sob. He cries for so long that he falls to his knees in exhaustion and weeps so hard he loses his breath.
“I love you, Harry.”
Oh for fuck’s sake.
to cover it up.
Thinks that if cursed objects exist, Harry’s sure as hell holding one in his hands.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, almost asking him.
“And now...for the grades.”
“You don’t trust me?” Harry levels his eyes with Draco’s, half smirking in a way he hasn’t done for a long time. “After all the nights we spent in bed with each other?”
While he is angry, his voice is delicate. Fragile. Hard to bear and hard to hear.
Either way, Draco grasps him and kisses him without fear of judgment and it’s the best one they’ve ever shared. Hermione pats him on the back and Ron is saying congratulations and the room is in an uproar for the both of them. Together. Two being bound for the future by three days spent in a terrible, godless place and tragedy.
“I’m going to Draco’s. It’s okay, okay? I just. I needed some time to myself. I’m taking Apparating in the morning.”
Draco settles down a little, but his eyebrows are still furrowed and his hands still clutch at his sheets with white knuckles. He’s panting and sweating and confused and afraid.
Harry thinks about nothing and falls asleep.
The branches dangle a foot or so overhead and it’s easy to see where Draco made haste picking off the fruit, so Harry holds up one and places it back against the branch. With his other hand, he casts
Draco slips into the water slowly with his back turned, so Harry feels comfortable enough to take off his jacket and filthy clothes and slip under the water on his opposite side. The water is smooth and heavenly after almost 3 days of running, crying, dirt, rain, strange fruit, and sweat. Warm and smelling like Draco.
The Weasleys’ burrow? For the few sweet months he spent with his parents in Godric’s Hollow as a newborn? God forbid it, but is he
“Your family didn’t play Christmas music?”
“Apples?” Draco sounds confused. “In April?”
The taste is delicious. Sharp and fragrant, almost like a Granny Smith, but bright yellow in colour. He takes another bite.
“You should sleep now,” Draco says. “Long day tomorrow.”
“What?” Harry’s head whips around to look at him.
“Found some apples.”
Harry slips off his cloak so Draco can see him.
Plus, the nightmares haven’t stopped for either of them. If anything, the threat of the danger of the forest brings them on stronger, more often, more vehemently. Some days, the smell of food makes Harry gag from the potent nightmares and the sleepless nights. Sometimes Draco vomits in the wee hours of the morning from dreams about lessons with his father and a song Voldemort once tortured his mother to. Sometimes they clutch each other because the other option is knees on the tiles and mouth filled with bile, of screams into the dark, suffocating silence of their bedroom.
“I’m sorry.”
“You’re trying to dig up my complicated backstory, but it won’t work. Not right now anyway.”
“Hello, students,” McGonagall says, looking regal and perhaps a bit proud. “I’m glad you’ve all stuck it out and made it this far. Tomorrow begins the first weekend of testing. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, I assume you’re both fully prepared.”
Harry feels the parchment, hears it crinkle as he unfolds it. The Marauder’s Map in all its glory.
“Me, too.”
which is tricky to use on people when sober, let alone when drunk, but it works for her. Fortunately, too, because it can backfire and cause the entire room to scream SILENCE! all at once.
He shuts his eyes slowly, sniffles. Draws a pillow close to him in his arms like he’s in pain, like he’s waiting for it to stop but it won’t.
“Can I take off yours, too?” He asks and the innocence and the mischief in his eyes shouldn’t be so fucking hot, but it is.
Harry sighs, but he can’t agree.
“Draco,” he whispers, “are you up?”
“I did actually die,” Harry says in response, dead-pan. “I was dead.”
convince him to return.
“A mind healer?” He says, almost repugnantly.
He can't, of course, but his intention is clear.
He can’t bear it. He sucks his dick into his mouth and bobs his head, lips tight, until Draco comes.
“Oh, dear,” Narcissa says softly, thoughtfully, like the earth isn't crumbling to pieces beneath Draco’s feet. “Who else?”
hurting me,” Draco whispers . “The way you look at me...the way I feel around you...people are noticing, Harry. They’re going to figure it out.”
“It’s different, for Draco,” Hermione interprets, sort of stroking his hair in a way no one has ever done before. “He was raised to believe in having a good reputation. Most pureblood kids were, because it's a trueblood value, something they passed down to every generation.”
This is the same Ministry that considers werewolves half-breeds, that forced muggleborns to sign a registry, that fostered the elitism that killed 15% of the wizarding world and housed corrupt leaders for generations and then allowed them to get away with it. Then Hermione shrugs, giving in because what can it hurt?, and they open the book to XXXX and XXXXX.
and finds he’s crying, too.
the icebreaker you’re gonna go with?” Harry’s half-smiling, but the action exhausts him, so it slips from his face as Draco shrugs. “Wanna go see our room?”
“Beautiful,” he says and Draco takes one of his hands, like he does when they’re both awake from nightmares.
leave me your thoughts please! :) it'd be really awesome to see some feedback!
by Yamazaki you were playing?”
“Potter,” he says and then immediately corrects himself, “Harry, I mean, I can’t just come back.”
He can’t go back to the Burrow! Not yet. Not yet! He’s not ready.
He’s never been this terrified before either, which he supposes really says something about his state of mind in here. This forest has a way of warping reality when there aren’t extra magical creatures hunting you down to slaughter and eat you, so it’s especially malevolent now. Especially with that goddamn music playing.
Afterward, the air is lighter. The mail arrives and, with it, comes a small envelope held in the foot of a spotted black owl. It lands in front of him, sealed with purple wax and a stamp of a book. When he opens it, the letter is written in neat, concentric handwriting.
“Fine.”
Apparently, though, he isn’t too tired to get hard, which is weird after so long. He’d begun to think his dick would never work, so to feel it like that again is bizarre to say the least.
Harry and Draco climb back into bed after their bath and letter sending, feeling warm and clean for the first time in days. Harry climbs into his side of their tiny shared twin bed and Draco crawls into the opposite side. The sheets are cool against Harry's skin.
Harry nods his head once and Draco does the same, sharing a look that communicates how unready they truly are.
Come back so we can do this together.”
“As far as the Ministry are concerned, you should have had all the knowledge to brew your necessary potions by yourself. If, say, time was an issue, potions can be brought in or purchased. What potion would you be unable to brew?”
He’s right, of course, but the principle is still there. He didn’t tell Harry. His best friend.
He decides then that maybe a friendship works both ways.
Harry’s determined to do so.
leaving them be.
Harry sits back up, willing to give it one more chance, and focuses with all his energy on what his life will be like after he graduates.
Harry can’t believe this. The tree is still crying off in the distance, still in pain while Draco eats her children right in front of Harry. Harry gags and wretches, bringing up only bile. The bezoar must have digested already and with it, the poison apples, so this is all he has in his stomach. He feels like weeping for the tree, for its loss, but does something else. He stands on shaky feet and casts
Anyway, Harry and Draco are headed to their Unusual Potions class when someone, apparently not seeing Harry at all, shoves Draco hard enough that his momentum causes them both to skitter into the wall. Pain blooms bright on Harry’s shoulder as he slams it into the concrete and he groans. Looks down to see Draco on the floor with blood on his face and tears in his beautiful grey eyes.
Draco doesn’t pause his walking, but his shoulders tense up. He turns another corner and Harry begins to realize where they’re going.
Inside are some spotted pinkish-green leaves that Harry recognizes from that night all that time ago on the Malfoys’ balcony. Alihotsy
Harry’s head feels as light as air and his tongue is a cement paperweight. When he slips from the log he’s been sitting on and crashes to the ground, he finds he can’t pick himself back up. His eyes are open and he stares up at the relentless sun through a gap in the trees. It’s beautiful like this, even when it’s burning holes in his corneas, but the moment is ruined by Draco’s shadow. He blinks once, amazed at the amount of effort the usually effortless motion takes, and Draco pries open his mouth. His cement tongue is heavy and useless as he shoves something small and tasteless into his mouth and slams it shut. The rock-like object tumbles down his throat and he, with all the strength he has left, swallows it.
“Good job, Pig,” Hermione says affectionately, reaching out to stroke his feathers. “Now go before Crookshanks comes looking.”
“What’s wrong? Everyone’s been going crazy looking for you! You’ve been gone for days and Draco’s gone, too!”
“At the Weasley’s.”
Harry turns back to his plate and smiles a little, just for himself and for Draco. Maybe even a little bit for Ron, too.
With the new unity wards, Harry was under the impression that no bullying could occur between students, but apparently that isn’t true, or it doesn’t apply to former Death Eaters. Harry’s been so out of it he hadn’t noticed the way Draco waited until class had started to walk the halls, left extra late for meals. He was avoiding the crowds and their taunting.
He says his name like a whip, aching and hard and painful. Like a gift he’s thrust back in Harry’s face, like saliva he’d spit onto Harry’s skin.
His cheeks flare up and – okay he’s definitely tipsier than he thought. Chugging two beers quickly to forget his horrible date was probably in itself, a horrible idea… But there’s no way that Harry would – or Harry thinks –
“Err – it’s recent.”
His eyes widen and he frowns. “Mr. Malfoy, I’ll need more information.” He waves his wand and conjures a new form on his clipboard. “Was this curse self-inflicted?”
to try and explain. He pulls out his small journal – one that a mind healer had recommended to him after the war to jot down his thoughts when they become overwhelming.
Jesus Christ.
He shakes his head a bit. “Hey I’m not a posh arse I-,” He feels another sharp pain in his chest and he clutches at his V neck sweater, hunching over.
“Scorpius!” And Draco nearly jumps to hear the admonishing tone in Harry’s voice. “Absolutely not. Who told you that?”
Harry struggles slightly.
“Draco, wait I – are you okay? What’s going on?”
Harry clasps Teddy’s shoulders. “Excellent. Grab your coats. We’ll be walking.”
Malfoy looks at him through a curtain of lashes. “Hey.” He murmurs.
“Aye, Blaise.” A stocky tanned wizard leans against the doorframe, his arms bursting against his suitcoat. “I got that report you were looking for.” He waves it in the air and nods at Harry before placing it on the desk.
Which led him to this moment. Here. Right now.
Harry salutes. “Aye, aye, Captain Mom.”
plant I’ve ever seen.”
“If we’re going to start apologizing, we’d honestly never stop.” Draco’s voice is still tense as he pulls back.
“I think so, too.” Draco’s voice is small. Unsure. “Perhaps I’ll write one later.”
Harry lays down in his bed a changed man as Draco runs to brush his teeth. This night has invigorated him and reminded him of why he liked Hogwarts to begin with. It’s an escape from all the shit and the pain and the malignancy of the real world. It was until Voldemort ruined it with his pointless war, that is, but it's with this precise thought that he makes a rash decision.
Leave it to Draco to find an apt comparison that shocks Harry enough to force him to laugh.
Listening to the music Potter gave him for Christmas does not help. It’s upbeat, but the sound is so deeply tied to Draco’s sorrow that he sobs when he hears it. Begs his mother not to play it on the piano, despite
“Yes.”
are you doing?” Harry asks pointedly, hand already reaching for his wand to defend Draco at any cost. “Bullying isn't allowed here. Violence has no place in Hogwarts anymore.”
him there. And Harry reckons he deserves his chance at being selfish for once.
“Not poinsettia weird, though.”
“Mr. Potter,” she starts and she’s calm, “Mr. Malfoy seems to have made a reappearance.”
“Harry, then.” He sounds uncomfortable.
When he arrives at his room, he finds Ron sitting on the foot of his bed, empty pack of cigarettes clutched in one fist.
“He left because of me. ”
His eyes start to shut as tears slip down his dampened cheeks. He feels so cold, so empty. So lonely. As his eyes slide shut, he can see the bright light of death and can feel the warm light of the afterlife on his cheek.
He knows it is, because it has been since the start of term.
“They have potions like that?” Harry’s so afraid to hope that he doesn’t, can’t because hope takes too much energy and he has none left.
He leans back against the counter and holds his hands, clasped together, to his chest as he feels nothing and everything all at once.
Harry stops fiddling with the dough to just listen to her. Listen to the building of the song, of the piano, of her voice. It’s so beautiful and peaceful.
“Me neither,” George says softly, at his mum’s side, hand on Harry's shoulder. “I’m not sure anyone is.”
It sort of becomes a thing.
She holds him closely in her arms and weeps over him like he’s dead already. Like he died up on the tower and she only has his lifeless body to grasp at. He has tears in his eyes, too, and is so overcome with emotion that he clings back to her, full on sobbing with madness and anxiety.
Then he Owls Malfoy by sending the fastest Owl in the owlery and waits impatiently and anxiously for his reply while he thinks about Hedwig’s wide white wings.
Harry agrees with that. Dumbledore may have done some good things for the Wizarding World, but Harry wishes he hadn’t ignored the separation Houses sometimes lead to. The divide of competition sometimes goes too far.
I mean?” Harry’s afraid to even ask.
His back is as straight and stiff as his words; he pulls open his bedroom door.
The small sparrow that makes up his patronus is something he’ll have to think about in private. Why such a small, defenseless little bird? Such a delicate being that relies on wings to move?
Tomorrow, they’ll start their hike. Well, in a couple hours at the break of dawn, at least. Harry removes his potion from the sack, taking a deep breath.
Draco blacks out. He comes to with a wand poking his cheek and a calming hand on his arm. When he opens his eyes, he can see the dark, thin fingers are familiar. In fact, he’s held that hand more times than he could count.
Hogwarts used to be a home for the lost, a place of magic and wonder. For Draco and for Harry, it used to mean a family with no repercussions. No payments to be made at their expense. But after the war, it, like the two boys, is not the same.
Draco moans softly under his lips, hands brushing over Harry’s skin, and just enjoys it.
They haven’t eaten since lunch yesterday and neither of them were in good shape to begin with. They have some emergency supplies, but they both agree they should save those in case of emergency. So they start their exhausted walk.
“I’m sorry for these,” Harry says, “but I’m glad we’re together now.”
And so Draco does. The leaves begin to change colour, drying up slightly until their colours are muted. Then he pulls out pieces of old parchment that he also casts a few spells on until its consistency changes, too.
Over his ribs, across every scar, down the soft blond hair on his stomach, and to the waistband of his pajamas. He kisses across there, feeling only momentarily unsure of where to go from here, but he finds his way.
“Draco!” He says once more. “Run!”
Harry looks around at the other eighth years and swallows hard. Who will he be stuck with? Who will have to pick up the pieces when he inevitably falls apart just through the tree line?
you’re getting married without mentioning it at all to me either? Are we even friends at all, Ron? And if we aren't, what was that? All those years? A joke?
“Please,” Draco says, looking at him with pleading eyes. “Do it.”
Harry wakes up in the tent, throat dry, mouth drier, with his eyes blinking to rid himself of the sparks in his vision. Whatever those apples were, they were fucking bad. Obviously.
“Well, you’re just in time—”
Alright is a funny word to use for what Harry is and looks like. Anxiety flares up in his chest, but he’s not sure why. He doesn’t not want to see Mrs. Weasley, but he’s hesitant. Doesn’t want her to see him, more like.
Harry’s jaw drops, his tongue goes numb, his palms start to sweat, he shivers. Back to the forest. Back to green light and Avada Kedavra and Hagrid’s hard sobs. Back to Malfoy’s mother’s blessed lie and Harry's paralyzed back on the cold, wet ground.
Draco kisses his nipple and relents, drawing down the bed to suck the head of Harry’s cock into his mouth. The pleasure is immediate and all encompassing. Harry’s so in love that he can feel the beat of his heart and the beat of Draco’s—in sync. Draco hollows his cheeks, looking elegant and regal even with a dick in his mouth, and Harry gasps.
Harry’s voice is nothing, not even a whisper. He is just so tired. He can’t do it anymore, can’t pretend to hold his shit together for one second longer. He turns his head away from Draco’s gentle, quiet eyes and he sobs.
The kid’s face pales. Harry notices they’ve gathered quite the crowd, but he’s glad for it today. At least the news will get out that Draco’s off limits. That he’s finally chosen correctly.
“There you are,” she says, relieved, and she reaches for him.
that my mother grows.”
Harry thinks about it for only a second before he lifts his knee to settle down beside Draco, too exhausted to consider the implications. He draws the blanket up to his chin and looks up at the ceiling, feeling relief and pain like two crossed waves crashing up against one another.
They hike until the sun starts to slip from the sky and the cold really starts to set in. Luckily, the
McGonagall practically grabs him by his shirt collar to stop his escape. Perhaps she even uses magic, because Harry’s dragged back a bit. Turns to look at her, wondering if she’ll be mad and what punishments she’ll assign him.
Harry has a knapsack thrown over his left shoulder full of their allowed supplies from McGonagall. Their potions, some ingredients and herbs, food, two bezoars, spare clothes, and a tent. Measly items for such a long and exhausting weekend.
He commanded the snake to tighten and tighten until the vessels beneath Narcissa’s skin bulged and popped, until bruises formed on her arms and abdomen and chest, until her screams shook the manor walls with agony. And then Draco relented, because what else could he do?  How could he, a fearful and petulant child, ever evade the Dark Lord?
He can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t he can’t
Someone turns on the music just then and it’s somehow
After the ceremony, she sends the first through seventh years away so she can speak privately with the few eighth years who have actually returned. There’s not many of them— besides Harry and his friends, only five or so more show up— but it’s enough to elicit new rules and curriculum apparently.
Draco gives him an appraising look, one filled with admiration and endearment and relief, and then says:
Draco’s mouth is warm and soft, nothing like it had been before, but it’s new and fantastic and inviting. Draco tugs at the hair on Harry’s neck, uncut and unusually long from neglect, and it feels so impossibly good that Harry can’t help himself.
Draco kisses him for a long time, until Harry’s wishing he wasn’t so exhausted so they could keep going, but he physically can’t.
He’s gasping so hard he’s wondering how Draco hasn’t turned up to press a hand calmly against his back. Wondering where he’s disappeared to in the middle of the night, since Harry’s bed is empty and Draco’s is still made. When he gets up and puts on his glasses, he notices a note on the foot of his bed. Stuck there with magic so it wouldn’t get kicked off from Harry’s thrashing.
It’s a smile for only Harry. The kind only he should ever get. Something open and delicate and entirely too intimate for just friends.
Harry has nothing else to say, so they keep going. They spot magical plants, too, including the so elusive Alihotsy, but they’re less exciting than the magical wildlife. Harry can’t help but stop to collect some Alihotsy for later, though, because it usually is so rare. Just in case.
His brain is overloaded and he’s crumbling under the pressure to make it function again. His voice is loud, though. A little angry, mostly upset.
“Yeah, I guess. I was freaking out.”
Harry nods, flashing a fake smile, and remembers the bravery in her voice when she lied to the face of the world's biggest threat. When she helped him take down Voldemort with a couple of words. And then he goes back to cutting shapes out of his gingerbread dough.
“Yes, but the stakes are higher if you do so. The only two grades available to retest for are Acceptable and Troll. No Outstandings will be granted due to medical emergencies.
“And yet
He also wonders if normal wizards have the capability of producing magical patronuses. Are there wizards out there who can make nundos and griffins? Dumbledore could produce a phoenix, but could he be considered normal?
“Awesome,” Harry says, suddenly realizing he’s standing in the middle of a flower bed at 3 am, stoned out of his mind. “Do wizards have the poinsettia song?”
“Prefect bath. Frightened a third year into giving me the password. It’s
“I'm fine.” Harry can survive this pain, because physical pain is the easiest to bear, but the other? He’s not sure that won’t be the death of him yet.
He thinks and he thinks and he thinks.
“Sorry, but you were being a twat.” And with that, he starts his hike towards the crying tree, towing Draco’s stunned body in the air behind him.
Draco’s return to the 8th year common room is one of relief. Pansy pretends she hadn’t missed him and refuses to meet his eyes at first. Ignores him almost completely until Draco calls her name once. Then she cracks and says, “Well, it’s about damn time.”
Harry nods, confused, wondering where he’s going with this.
Harry has no plans on doing that, on letting Poppy see how far he’s slipped, but he nods anyway.
And what, go back home to your mummy and your expensive food and safe life?”
“Potter?”
He’s a little pissed off at Ron still for not even having a viable excuse. Not even thinking of how Harry might have seen a proposal he hadn’t even known about. Ron and Hermione had so easily forgotten he was their friend that it burns.
Draco smacks the apples from Harry’s arms. “I read about them in one of my father’s books!”
, hoping against all hope that it will work. It doesn’t, though, so he has to think up another strategy and quickly. He doesn’t know how long Draco will be down for or if the weeping will bring on predators.
“Did she really help?”
He just wishes there was a way to make sure Draco didn’t suffer for his greediness.
Patches nods enthusiastically and Disapparates on the spot, even though Draco’s room is not that far. Harry smiles despite himself.
should’ve told me.”
Harry eats a piece of toast with an egg in the center and has a whole delicious cup of coffee with a splash of milk. He revels in it, in the warmth and the taste and the satisfaction. He only needs a cigarette now to feel entirely himself once more.
“And then we’ll eat,” Narcissa adds. “Let me tell you two about what Patches and I have come up for dinner tonight…”
Ron and Hermione somehow get along with Draco and Narcissa perfectly. They discuss music and S.P.E.W (Patches is himself a free elf, apparently, that Narcissa hired from his newspaper ad and earns money for his time and effort, like Dobby used to) and the possibilities in this new Dark Lord Free World.
Harry just looks up at her, all the emotion in his eyes, as he realizes he should’ve just died in that goddamn forest. Would’ve been easier. He wouldn’t feel like this anymore at least. He’d be at peace. Heaven or hell or neither at all, at least it couldn’t get any worse than this.
“Good night then.” And she goes, graceful as ever, into the darkness of the hallway.
“I have to go,” is all Draco has to say, flatly, somberly.
“Your hair’s getting long,” Draco says with soft eyes. “It’s never been this long before. You look like a brunette Kurt Cobain.”
“I—” Panic, as clear as day.
“Grieving sounds. But they’re just magic in the tree itself, Harry. It’s not actually missing its fruit.”
“Perhaps we should have a dinner party, then? Draft an invitation and send it back with an owl. Say 7?”
“I get kicked out of school and sent to Azkaban for attacking the twat who saved my life, that’s what.”
“I don’t believe in
And then he wretches, coating his shoes in sticky gold vomit. The dead leaves on the ground start to smoke, catch flame, and then burn.
He doesn’t even have anything left to hope that he ends up in heaven and not hell, like he knows he truly deserves.
Harry sighs, exhausted, as Ron and Ginny push their way into the car, trunks in tow.
Harry stops to look at Ron for a second, look at the man he’s grown into, and he laughs a little. Light. How could Harry hold that against them when he's done worse and been forgiven? When Ron can still look at him despite being the cause of Fred’s death, the loss of George’s ear?
Harry gives him a hug that he returns, his hands pressing tightly into the small of Harry’s thin back. He can feel the pressure of Draco’s grasp like pain and worries there’ll be a bruise over the bones in his spine.
Draco lowers his eyes and stares at his plate for the rest of the meal, not even looking up when Harry places a hand on his knee. It’s then that Harry starts to worry.
“I thought...I thought you’d changed, but I guess I was wrong. You’re just as selfish now as you were then. Have a good life,
“And I love you, too.”
Harry hadn’t planned on returning to repeat his seventh year at Hogwarts, on coming back to those hallways of horror, reliving the moments of his friends’ deaths, feeling the ache of fear, the bite of panic.
Harry looks down at it, at the surprisingly gentle hold he has on it, and shrugs. Couldn’t give less of a shit about having Draco’s wand, about winning it, about keeping it.
Before the war, she’d stopped playing altogether and their house had been silent and dangerous, save for the agonized screams of the innocent begging for mercy Voldemort didn’t have to give. The Dark Lord had forbidden the piano as the sound bothered the ears of his snake, Nagini, and made her irate as there was only
Lucius swoops him up and puts him on his hip. “Good boy, Scorp. Let’s let mom talk to the doctor. How about we get some coffee for him, hm?”
Harry laughs lightly. “Of course, if you think hugs will save his life.”
“In the kitchen, Harry!”
Harry sighs. “Scorpius,” And fuck, he hates to admit this. “He might just be having a good time, kiddo.”
He pulls away from Draco placing his tiny palms on his father’s cheeks. “Very much so.” He squints. “Are you okay?” He asks very seriously.
He bites his lip and pulls out his phone again. He’s been feeling antsy today…
“Honestly Harry, you’re ridiculous.” Teddy chuckles.
“Malfoy!” He looks up, his eyes burning and bloodshot. Harry is kneeling down taking his hand in his. “What happened?”
She rolls her eyes. “Well, you’re just lucky Draco finds it attractive.”
“Come on now, Scorpius. Not everything is going to be a win.” He places the small boy down.
“Draco,” Blaise grasps his hands from across the table. “Please – let me help you. I can be there for you, I can – I can-,” He tears his hand away.
Draco looks over and cocks an eyebrow at him. “Cooking is like potions and I’ve seen your mediocre potion performance.”
Draco huffs and sinks into the couch. “Just get me whatever you’re having and fill me in on what’s going on in this plotless, mildly horrifying cartoon Christmas movie.”
He blushes furiously, but before he can even respond another text chimes in.
Draco turns to Harry. “Ice skating?”
And his father is… well… trying.
Harry kneels, eye level with Scorpius and pulls him into his chest, running a hand over his hair. “Shh, shhh, Scorp, calm down, darling.” He coos. “Take a deep breath for me.” He feels the small child’s shuddering breath and he rubs his back soothingly before pulling away and looking Scorpius in the eye. “Tell me what’s going on.”
Harry’s eyes glance down. “Explain this
“Mom!” Scorpius tugs on his jumper and he welcomes the distraction.
As they eat, they engage in light small talk –
He freezes. “He did?”
He fiddles with his pink finger nervously. “Is it Teddy?”
Harry sighs heavily as he slumps in the chair across from Hermione’s desk. He tilts his head back and his eyes flutter closed. “Merlin, do I love half day at the Ministry.”
“Dray.” His voice is low. “Why were you in the curse breaker’s office?”
“It’s – It’s complicated-,”
Draco shifts uncomfortably. “Yes, well the first five years were a little…” He clears his throat. “Anyway, I work primarily from home and in a private…
“No!” His eyes look wide and he looks at Draco skeptically. “Is it scary?”
Lucius’ voice calls out as he returns from the kitchen, a tray of sandwiches in hand. “That would be my doing.” He sets the tray down and sits down gracefully in a black leather chair. “Scorp was getting bullied at that muggle Kindergarten for not having a mom, so I simply provided him a solution.”
He turns to Hermione and opens his mouth before she cuts him off. “I’ve got it. I’ll owl Ron and Pansy.”
Harry gets close and gazes down at him. “Hey.”
Blaise gives him a disgusted look. “Honestly Potter, you have no fucking manners.”
“Okay, mom!” He calls back.
Potter rises with him and shoots him a small smile. “I never thought I’d say this, but,” He gives Draco an indecipherable look. “I had fun today, Malfoy. Can we – can we maybe do this again?”
Lucius sits in the empty seat beside Narcissa. “Well Draco…” He trails. “After those rude muggle children at his school bullied him for not having a mother, I offered a solution.” He smirks teasingly and Draco rolls his eyes giving Scorpius a squeeze.
He doesn’t get a text back right away and he fidgets uncomfortably before flagging down the bartender for another beer.
He stands up and pulls on his coat. “Be good for your grandmother, Ted. I’ll see you Thursday.”
Potter smiles fondly at Scorpius and it makes something flip in the pit of Draco’s stomach. “He’s an amazing kid, Malfoy.”
“Ah yes… Scorpius… my
“Ah, we should be going.” He holds out his free hand. “It was nice seeing you, Cormac.” He puts a hand on Scorp’s shoulder. “Come along now, Darling. Let’s not keep Harry waiting.”
The blonde clears his throat. “Yes, well. Sometime soon then?” He takes the call of speaker phone and holds it to his ear. “So, can I ask why you called?”
She shakes her head. “No, no, it’s nothing like that. It’s… my sister, Narcissa.” She looks at him nervously. “We’ve been… corresponding for awhile and…” She looks at him pleadingly. “I know what they’ve done to you and I know you dislike the Malfoys but-,” She bites her lip and looks away. “Cissy called with the floo and Teddy came in and had some questions and I filled him in as…
It’s good that he’s alone. It’s good that he keeps to himself. A sharp pain in his chest has him doubling over, hand clenching the table.
The floo flares to life causing both to jump. It’s a little past eleven, there’s no reason anyone should be coming through this late at night unless they’re a threat or it’s an emergency. He draws his wand and puts himself between the fireplace and Hermione.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shit. Malfoy. What’s going on?”
“Mom!” Scorpius climbs off his chair and throws his body at Draco’s legs.
Harry has probably literally never cared about his appearance so much in his life then he has over the past two weeks. He’s not entirely sure what constitutes as proper brunch wear, but he finds himself video calling the last person he ever thought he would on a Sunday morning at 8AM.
– maybe we could grab dinner. Just the two of us?”
“Earth to Harry?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes fondly. “Alright, stay out of trouble you two. And Scorpius behave.”
This fic lives. Welcome to the revival.
Dean lets out a huff of laughter and runs a reassuring hand down Seamus’ back. “I think they got it, Shae.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake!”
Potter’s right. Draco presses his hands harder into his eyes. No. He’ll beat this. He’ll figure this out. He
cold. His floo chimes and he staggers forward, dropping to his hands and knees and crawling to the fireplace. He warms himself by the flames and waves his hand allowing the fire to come to life. Pansy’s face appears in the flames. “Draco, there you are!” He lets out a long sigh, the warm flames appeasing the cold in his bones for a few moments. “I’ve been worried sick about you! I had lunch with Blaise yesterday, and he said to check in with you.”
In the haste of trying to get Scorpius ready and bundled up, he briefly forgets about the picture he so boldly sent Potter. It’s not until he’s walking to the park with one hand around Scorp’s that his phone chimes and he remembers. He slides it open and sees a text from Potter.
“It’s proper first date etiquette to order something cheap if your date insists on paying. A salad is modest, it’s proper, it’s -,”
Malfoy crosses his arms and looks away. “His mother is out of the picture.” He locks eyes with him.
To be a dad… his thoughts drift to Astoria … and a mom.
Teddy looks thoughtful for a moment as he winces taking a bite of burnt bacon. “Do you know if Draco enjoys cooking?”
His eyes widen and he bolts back to the alleyway, retching beside the dumpster. He’s got a palm against the brick wall to brace himself, his hair falling forward. Mid-retching he feels a calloused hand gather the bottom of his strands pulling them away from his face. When he’s finished he winces and wipes his mouth on his sleeve backing away from the wall. He turns his gaze to Potter who’s sheepishly holding out a disposable water bottle. Draco winces. “Thank you. I’m sorry.” He takes a generous gulp. He eyes the water bottle. “This is terrible for the environment, Potter. You really should consider reusable water bottles.”
The brunette rises to his feet, wand clutched in his hand. His dad’s fists are clenched at his sides and he gives Scorpius a squeeze because… this could end extremely bad. “Hey Scorpius, why don’t you go wash up for tea, okay?”
The blonde looks slightly in shock but he nods his head. “I - yes of course.”
There’s a deep, rough sleep-worn laugh. “Because your mom likes them in his waffles.” There’s some movement. “Can you hold my wand, and move it in a circle to stir the batter, Scorp?”
He shakes his head. They’re burdened enough as it is.
Potter swallows a bite of his sandwich. “No, no. I’m not trying to insult you, I’m just shocked is all.”
“Poison?” He asks faintly.
“He must’ve seen what happened in the hallway,” Harry whispers, the wind burning his cheeks, drying his lips to pain.
“Alright,” Draco says lightly. “Eat this. It’s a plangentine. Like a clementine, sort of, but they’re sharper and can cause uncontrollable levitation if not eaten correctly.”
Skinny as hell, shadowed in exhaustion. As frail as the skeletons of all their dead classmates buried 10 feet underground.
Harry tries not to think about it, but he can’t help but wonder if Malfoy’s upset to share a common room with dirty blood. Upset at having to settle for a space that is less than pure.
“Then, fine. I’m in love with you.”
He doesn’t remove his hands from his ears, but he tries to focus on something to calm down. He has to focus on anything except the life he’s been given.
Harry could literally throw up. Like projectile vomit all over The stupid Prophet.
Finally, they reach a clearing. Mostly, the spot is free of toppled over trees and the magical grass Harry’s sure produces poison pollen or something equally as malevolent, so they decided to settle down there. Draco pitches the tent with a spell—
“Hello,” Harry says calmly, “my name’s Harry. My friend, he, well, he took something that belongs to you and we’re here to make it right, okay? Or try to, at least.”
anymore? Because I...I won’t get better. I think this is it for me, this is my cross to bear, my hill to die on, so when you are better, I’ll be alone. You’ll leave
Draco bobs his head, still stroking the base of Harry’s dick, tongue running circles on the head, and Harry warns him. He’s so so so so so so close.
Ron and Hermione are sitting across from him in the library, arguing about the ability of the Ministry to include XXXXX rated creatures into the forests. Ron thinks it’d be “sick” to see a wampus cat or a manticore and Hermione thinks that they would never put anything more dangerous than an XXXX in the forest. Harry is, at the moment, inclined to agree with Hermione on this, but it
He casts in a moment of blind fucking panic, because Harry has to be alright.
White smoke pours out from the tip of his wand like fog. It’s so bright it burns his eyes and he winces. Maybe his patronus is noncorporeal now, because it seems to fill the tent with light and smoke for a moment, so bright it’s impossible to see any darkness whatsoever.
“Oh, my god,” Harry says softly. “This is beautiful.”
“Bloody hell,” Draco says dramatically, still out of breath.
Besides the Gryffindors, there’s Luna, Hannah Abbot, Michael Corner, Pansy Parkinson, Susan Bones, and Draco Malfoy.
I killed Voldemort. I
“Good. Now once you're finished here, go see Poppy in the infirmary. Let her give you a onceover.”
Draco sobs as Harry’s limp body slinks down on the cold ground and he sends up red signal sparks into the sky. Why haven’t any fucking professors come to their aid? What the fuck is going through their minds? Do they seriously think this situation is under fucking control?
Technically, he isn’t leaving, though, right? He isn’t Disapparating or using an exit to make an escape or taking a car. He’s just going down a corridor that leads somewhere else magically. Hopefully, the technicality is enough to keep him out of detention and off of McGonagall's bad side.
Harry turns quickly to look at Malfoy from across the room. Whatever fight they’d had before the war had been squashed when he testified on his behalf during the Malfoy trials and managed to get him and his mother out of Azkaban. His father, who maintained his loyalty to Voldemort up until his cowardly last minutes, was sentenced to a quick and efficient Kiss to end his life.
“No?”
“And then never brought it up to the one person who has always been your best friend and hers? Neither of you?” Harry shakes his head, night ruined, disgust colouring his voice. “Whatever. I’m going to bed.”
“Well, it’s about damn time.”
“So, you will be assigned your own special eighth year dormitory that will be mixed-House. Hate speech and bullying will not be tolerated and any evidence of bullying will lead to immediate suspension. There are wardings in place to inhibit violence against one another. I will not have a divided student body again.”
will really work as he picks through the plants that encover the forest floor.
“Voldemort?” Harry asks, because he hates it when people don’t say it.
“Decided to Apparate. Hope you don’t mind.”
He doesn’t know what to say to Ron and Hermione anymore and, apparently, they don’t know what to say to him either. It’s not even their fault, not completely, but he’s just not okay as a person right now and he can’t be around people that are. And they are, at least outwardly.
Harry sits beside Hermione, who he refuses to even look at, and Draco, who he can’t stop looking at, and sips on a cup of hot chocolate. He hasn’t had any in such a long time that it fills his chest and his stomach with warmth and memory and alleviates the slight headache he’s got. He sighs, feeling content and upset, as Neville massages his forehead across from him.
Harry and Draco don’t talk about it, don’t even mention it when they wake in the mornings, just go to their Potions class and sit solemnly next to each other. It’s good. It keeps Harry sane, at least, considering Draco seems to be the only person interested in being around him.
Harry looks up at him, then, wondering if he knows how much he truly means to Harry. Wonders if he gets how his presence is the only thing that’s kept him going for months. Wonders if he even has to say it, then decides he does, because obviously Draco’s become rather thick-headed since the war.
“These are
to see the time. Only an hour has gone by, so what could Draco be doing?
“It’s a leucrotta! Hurry, Draco!”
“Popular isn’t the word I’d use, no. It’s actually illegal.”
He hasn’t been doing so well mentally, has truly been falling apart, and he can’t even imagine Hogwarts of all places will make him feel better, so he doesn’t even respond to the Letter in the mail. Leaves it sitting on the counter of the muggle hotel room he’s been renting, opened and only half read.
“You were gonna leave me here? Leave me to go into that forest alone while you sleep in a warm bed at home with your mum?”
“Who else might I be?”
“You get them, too?”
But her face is neutral, not restrained. Suspicious, but not decided.
Finally, Draco pulls the bag shut and they run in the opposite direction of the leucrotta, stumbling into the darkness regardless of any other dangers that are surely lurking behind the trees. They send birds scattering, scare weird salamander/snake hybrids up trees, cut off packs of small, golden yellow squirrels with five eyes on each side of their faces, but they don’t stop to look or admire or anything.
Then he bobs his head and Harry dies. He comes in Draco’s mouth, with a handful of Draco’s silver white hair, his mouth open and legs shaking.
Neither Harry nor Draco seem to bear it well where others are thriving. Perhaps it’s because of their close ties to the evil itself, due to Harry’s scar and Draco’s Dark Mark. Or perhaps they’re both so close to falling off the deep end that they’ve picked up an untreatable illness of the mind.
Somehow, though, he ends up there anyway, pulling his trunk through Platform 9¾, with Ron at his side. He’s not sure how it’s going to affect either of them, seeing spots where their friends and family died, but he’s going to try and deal with it.
He feels better today. Not perfect by any means, still haunted by death and the past, but okay for the moment.
Harry has avoided looking at him since returning to meals two days ago, but he does now. Ron’s grown up a lot over the past few months, looks tougher and older, scarred by time and history. He doesn’t look like the boy Harry once knew at all.
“Muggles break their laws?!”
“Dumbeldore’s was a phoenix.”
Draco is unresponsive and absolutely shaking like a leaf. Whatever this song is, it’s scaring him nearly to death.
“I haven’t tried, but I figured this might be as good a time as any.”
Harry’s warm despite the bitter cold thanks to the
Harry’s friends don’t really know what to do with him, so instead of talking about his dark circles or the way his shirts, which had once fit, now hang off his shoulders, or the gauntness of his cheeks, they ignore it. Talk about the new Weird Sisters album or that Muggle football player who is getting international recognition or whatever.
So he takes a deep breath and climbs through.
“How will we be graded?”
Draco is going to see Potter again. Potter is friends with his old friends again. A red-headed Weasel is going to kick his arse.
“Can I see that when you’re done, Susan?” Asks Ron with patience, who sits two seats up with Hermione at his side.
Draco’s hand is just sitting on the table beside Harry’s, empty and alone, and frankly it’s a little offensive. So Harry does what any logical person would do and reaches out his to thread his fingers with Draco’s.
It seems like Rita’s really pushing the new sequential articles for the first time since the war. For a while, she wrote about the trials and then about Harry and his supposed hoard of fans. Then about Harry’s search for a “wife” after they heard of his breakup with Ginny. Then more death eater stuff. The return of Voldemort and supposed sightings. Then Harry stopped reading, because he skipped so many meals. Now that he’s returned, he can see that he and Draco must be the muses for her next series.
“No, no. It’s okay.” Harry’s breath starts to pick up.
on his wand tip. Draco says nothing, almost like Harry has stuck his tongue to the roof of his mouth with a
“Do you remember that day I asked to be your friend?” Draco says, in the meantime. “When you said no?”
“Let’s stop. Look for some lunch.”
“You know what?” She smiles. “I’ll handle it. You go get dressed, okay, love? Let Patches know we’ll be having guests so he can prepare himself. You know how bad his anxiety can get.”
me?” Harry narrows his eyes, suddenly remembering he has a reason to be mad. “You stopped hanging out with me, the both of you, and then you go to
But maybe Harry’s been dead all along and no one has had the heart to tell him that he’s a ghost now, wandering Hogwarts as his final resting place for eternity. Maybe he is the new Nearly-Headless Nick, cursed to roam the lands forever, not quite entirely dead at all. How does he ask the people around him if it's true? Would they lie to protect him?
That’s all he has to say before the flaming dragon flies its small, lithe body out of the cramped space of the tent and disappears. Its bright glow fades slowly and then all at once as it roams the woods.
being her favourite song “ever” apparently.
book.”
Harry doesn’t know where the music is coming from or who is picking the songs, but the next one that plays is a Weird Sisters song. One he’s particularly fond of that starts off slow and a little eerie and picks up the pace just enough for it to be almost entrancing.
Maybe it’s selfish of him, but he wants Draco at his side. He
Harry grins up at him and bites his lip. He wants Draco in any way he’ll have him. Wants him for decades and days and forever. Wants his bitchy replies and somehow perfectly messy bedhead. Wants to be his mother’s favourite son and Patches’ favourite brother. Wants Pansy to like him, just so Draco knows how deeply he feels. He wants it all and more and has no possible rational way to say it.
“So much studying.” Ron sounds exhausted, in a healthy way. “We study all day and all night. Ugh. Can’t wait to get this shit over with. Anyways, come on.”
By the time Pigwidgeon returns, Harry’s gotten tired of sitting around doing nothing. He’s anxious and nervous and his heart is in his fucking throat.
So, no, Harry supposes normal people don’t have magical creatures as patronuses. This is just another thing to further separate him from the rest of the world.
“A healer?” Asks Draco.
Draco drops to his knees in front of Harry and casts a
There are tears in his eyes as he reaches for him, squeezing his shoulders so tightly it should hurt him enough to squeal, but he doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t move in any way.
“Yes, he
Together, they climb down the rickety steps of the decrepit Astronomy tower and back into the castle.
to lower Draco to the ground so he can focus in totality on the tree in front of him.
Draco looks back, just for a second, and Harry raises his eyebrows once. Draco tilts the corner of his mouth and returns his gaze to Headmistress McGonagall. It feels like acceptance, like Draco’s not going to be an arse about being partnered up, and Harry’s grateful.
“I don’t know what to do without him here. I feel like...like I’m suffering through life for no good reason and he was one of the few things that helped lessen the pain...and now he’s gone and I’m still here and he doesn’t want to be friends anymore and I’m falling apart.”
“Very well, then. Good night, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy.” And then she turns and walks away.
Harry bolts upright, tossing all of their shit into the bottomless knapsack as Draco does the same, and decides he can wait to brush his teeth. Whatever creature that has the ability to so successfully mimic Draco’s voice is obviously a hunter and
“Oh, Harry,” she whispers, squeezing him tighter. For once, Hermione has no words.
McGonagall calls out for everyone’s attention, looking as regal as ever at the teacher’s table in her winter robes and a dark blue wide brimmed hat.
Draco’s been home for a week and still wakes up searching his bed for Potter with his fingertips in pure desperation for his company. It’s the first thing he does when the snake nightmares of lullabies and death tear through his chest and leave him gasping and choking on the memory of the taste of his own blood. The second thing he does is shut his eyes as hard as he can and ball his hands into fists, knowing there’s nothing to be done. That no matter how he feels he cannot ever be selfish enough to return to Potter’s side.
Maybe they both need help.
“And Malfoy?
Harry slips his hands under the elastic Draco’s pants and slips them down his legs, too. Harry can’t believe the privilege he’s been given. He reaches for Draco’s dick and holds it firmly in his hand, giving him a few slow, practiced strokes. Draco moans softly, mutters Harry’s name a few times.
He’s so high. He doesn’t even know what he’s saying and he doesn’t care. It’s so nice to be free of his thoughts for once. A wonderful break.
Harry pretends to play along like a good boy, because Narcissa is being a great host, but he’s just not there. He can’t be. Not when McGonagall could notice he’s missing at any moment and Draco’s still worried he’ll ruin Harry’s reputation and he’s due to return to the Forbidden Forest where he almost died and he’s freaking the fuck out because his best friends are getting married and neither of them have mentioned it to him in the slightest.
“According to Draco, we didn’t have much choice.” She laughs and it’s the perfect kind of laugh to go with the joke.
and I should’ve stayed
“There’s something nearby. I’m gonna try and scare it away.”
We are all united under Hogwarts.
Harry digs in the bag and removes the half dozen fruits. At the sight or perhaps the sense, the tree’s wailing increases tenfold. Harry has to remind himself why he’s there because the cry is so all consuming he can’t think.
After a while, Harry’s patronus returns. Its fiery white glow is easily spotted as it soars through the forest, even through the thick canvas of their tent. If it is returning, that means it didn’t find anything too dangerous.
He can see the sparks from Draco’s spells through the exterior of the tent and he watches, silent and afraid, until Draco rejoins him inside the tent.
“Let’s go. You’re coming home with me.”
He can feel the magic responding to him again, can feel that it remembers him, as he casts
If you listen to one song, please listen to the one in the forest that the creature sings towards the end! It's haunting and fits the mood and will help you better understand what's going through their heads!
He ate too much at Narcissa’s and it’s made him sleepy. That plus all the stress and anxiety and worry and sleepless nights adds up to a mess of exhaustion. He’s practically dozing off whilst a cute boy is trying to make out with him on his bed and it’s so embarrassing. Well, it would be if he wasn’t too tired to feel embarrassed.
“Agreed. Shall we share the bath?” His eyes glitter.
She pulls back to look at him, a strange emotion in her eyes, before she nods like she gets it.
“He’s dead, 'Mione. You can say his name.”
“What?” The boy scowls back, confused. “You should be thanking me! I took down a Death Eater—the enemy!”
“Draco. He left for me.”
Draco must have tucked him away while he went off to look for something...or maybe he was attacked while Harry was out and had to be magically evacuated! Or maybe he’s injured and lying in a ditch while the leucrotta circles him and waits to end his life.
“Good luck,” says the headmistress, “and please remember that we are all watching in case you need help. Red sparks for emergencies.”
“They didn’t like how messy my hair was, so they shaved it off in patches. Thankfully, magic grew it back overnight, but that only pissed them off more. Locked me up for days for that one.”
Well, he supposes, friend is not the word he would use to describe him. His cousin, Dudley, knows this guy who sells alright weed for a good price, so he buys some and Disapparates as soon as the kid’s back is turned. Dudley watches him with wide, fearful eyes as he disappears and the sight brings some satisfaction to Harry’s life, if only for a second.
“That is all I have, love. I’m so sorry for your loss. I hope...I hope you can forgive us this mistake, but I know how a guilt like that can eat you up inside. I know because I feel it, too. I have done my best to return your children to their homes and I...I…” He fails to find the words. “I’m so terribly sorry.”
“Why?”
“Almost a week, mate. McGonagall called everyone.”
She makes a hasty exit, probably tired and trying to prepare for the stresses the weekend is bound to bring, and everyone pauses for a moment until the portrait seals up behind her. When she’s for sure gone, Seamus Finnigan, who has grown surprisingly introverted after the war, lifts 2 full bottles of firewhiskey and shouts, “Let’s fucking drink!”
“And with that,” the headmistress says, “let’s begin.”
Harry agrees wholeheartedly, squeezing Draco's fingers. She finishes singing and playing, but starts up another song. Something Harry doesn’t recognize.
Draco’s father’s books were probably all Dark, so whatever the apples do, it cannot possibly be good.
“Thanks, Potter.”
“Isn’t that against the rules?” Harry asks.
Harry does know, has seen it firsthand, but he doesn’t care. Draco is still just a boy, just barely 19. He had been even younger when he was forced to make a decision that would impact his life forever, so in Harry’s opinion, he's not at fault for making an impossible choice. How could he ever pick running away over his parents, over the only life he ever knew?
He meets the Headmistress’ forlorn eyes and knows she fought to avoid this, fought to have them take their NEWTS like they were supposed to. Fought to keep Harry’s body off the hard, damp ground.
black tie?!”
Harry winds his hands in Draco’s soft hair and kisses him back.
Draco is incredibly beautiful, of course, but he’s so thin. So frail. If Harry’s that bad (or, most likely, he's worse) it’s no small wonder they didn’t die out there. If they don't get Os for surviving alone, Harry's going to throw a fucking fit.
“Stress, probably,” responds Hannah Abott, who sits beside him in an equally dehydrated state.
Draco laughs, but draws back a little, “Good night, Harry,” and kisses him once more on the forehead.
He and Draco share a look before they run for it, hands just brushing the horse’s front leg when they’re finally removed from the forest.
“Could you?”
before Draco can do anything about it at all.
His own back is probably worse, but still.
“Potter,” Draco says, stepping into his line of sight, hands full of something, “why in God’s name are you shouting?”
Either way, being back at Hogwarts after two weeks in the sweet refuge of New Malfoy Manor is torture. It’s hell on earth, but Harry’s sticking it out and so should Draco.
I'm trying to be integrative with the fact this happened in the late 90s, but I was born in '98, so my approximations are all I have! Don't mind anything too much. Also I'm not British, so I have no idea what weed sells for over there or the names you guys had for it in the late 90s, so I'm using equivalencies and best guesses. Enjoy!
Harry clutches her arms and shakes like a leaf. He feels raw, like the crowd tore off his skin and stripped him bare for all to see. Saw all the bad things he did to make it this far, all the people he hurt, all the people he killed. Left him bleeding and aching like an open wound.
“Yeah. Voldemort.” Draco sounds like he gets what Harry wants without him having to say it. “I think...I think I’m gonna leave.”
shopping.” He stands regardless and rolls his eyes, linking his hand with Hermione’s. “Leave it to Malfoy to make us all miserable as we attempt to make his life better.”
Draco laughs a little, chuffed, and continues to read the book in front of him. It’s a book on useful muggle plants that might come in handy in the forest. Good thing one of them gives a fuck, because Harry seemingly physically can’t care.
“Can you even do that?” Draco looks skeptical. “After the war and everything?”
I came back and everything was different and so was I, you know? So I shut down because I didn’t know how to even begin to deal with the implications of that. I still don’t. But you
Draco grins and pulls out his wand, casting
The fruit hangs back where it belongs. Harry’s so relieved he could cry. He quickly does the rest of the fruit that he has left and looks forlornly at the open space next to the trunk. The final fruit, the last to stop the wails, is in Draco’s stomach. Unretreivable.
“I’m completely fucking your life up,” is what he says, breath shaking so badly that Harry can barely understand him. “They’re right. I’m shit. I’m destroying your reputation and...and you keep putting your bloody neck out for me when all it’ll get you is grief!”
“Narcissa is just inside! Please, let me take you to her.”
By the time dinner rolls around, Harry’s had enough of people jeering at him. It starts out quietly, has probably been brewing since the onslaught of the articles, and comes to head, so to speak. He notices it first when he returns to the halls after leaving Draco. The stares are more intense than usual, more focused. There’s mistrust in their eyes, hate and fear. It’s so out of place that, as the looks grow more intense throughout the day, he gets more and more uncomfortable. More uneasy on his feet.
By Rita Skeeter
He hasn’t been keeping up his Quidditch figure since McGonagall announced 8th years weren’t allowed to participate, hadn’t felt the need to.
“What a sad lot we are,” Harry says, sighing, wiping at his face. “But we
He takes his time washing his boney body, noticing almost for the first time that he can pretty much wrap his hand around his bicep and touch his fingers together. Oh, God, that can’t possibly be good.
“Malfoy?”
“Not at all.” Sorta. Kinda. Somewhat. Not really. Maybe.
“I have to go,
“Harry,” Hermione says softly, “she called on all the old Gryffindors. Everyone from last year who she could get a hold of. Andromeda and Teddy. The Dursleys, even. Narcissa Malfoy offered to help conduct a formal search.”
“Let me show you how much you mean to me,” Harry says softly and, at Draco’s nod, he slips back up the bed to kiss down Draco’s chest.
Harry flinches, thinking of the Floo in Umbridge’s old office, of Aberdeen in the glass mirror, of Sirius.
Malfoy looks like he’s going to say something mean, but his face changes at the last second.
At around 2, Malfoy comes sneaking into Harry’s room with an odd look on his face.
Draco, no matter his fear and pain, has to do the same. The Golden Boy deserves better than dying in the Forbidden Forest after escaping its clutches so many times before.
He overhears Hermione telling Luna about how she and Ron flew all the way to Australia to remind her parents of who she is and he wonders when she did this. Why hadn’t she told Harry?
