Even in his most errant of thoughts, the rules and regulations that guided an acting figurehead had never been top priority. Be that as it may, Harry's current lack of knowledge in that particular venue certainly wasn't making life at Jade Manor any easier. Harry found no enjoyment in being the center of attention, which, he supposed, completely dovetailed his new determination to prove himself. This wasn't simply about keeping Lothair quiet, but it rather concerned his understanding of his own self-worth. For Harry, his entire world prior to his seventeenth birthday was based loosely on obscure definitions of
"It transported him from the Manor, despite the wards against it. The potion did not, however, send him to the appropriate location. I've checked several possible destinations but I can't find a trace of the boy anywhere. Even scans on his magic aren't bringing anything up. He's simply vanished." Snape responded, feeling the tension in his body threatening to overcome him. The fact that he couldn't track down his charge was something Severus felt to his very core.
Draco finally looks up, to faces of shock. He tries not to make eye contact with Potter but he can’t help himself. Potter’s eyes are filled with pity. Draco can’t stand it.
Because he wanted to know more about Potter. Because he wanted to understand what made him who he was. Because studying Potter was all he’d done since he was a child. “I don’t know,” Draco replied. “I just do.”
But maybe he’s just doing this for attention. Maybe it’s not real at all, and he’s just a man, and he’s overthinking things because Padma seems so happy, and he wants to be too. Harry wonders if he’d be thinking all this if he were even a little bit able to let things go.
Draco sees the moment Potter realizes what he’s saying, and the blank expression immediately turns to laughter. Soon Potter’s doubled over, head against his knees, and Draco can’t help but join in. The sun is glinting against the water and Potter’s laughter is loud and bright and Draco thinks he might be the happiest he’s ever been.
“She won’t… move,” Malfoy says desperately, waving his arms at Gertrude on the table. “She molted a few weeks ago so I know it’s not that. I don’t…. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.”
Speakers of the event welcome the guests, thank everyone for coming, and make speeches that drag on for some time before the food is served. Draco, Ron, and Hermione continue their light bickering. Harry can’t stop noticing how
“Yes, of course,” Draco replied smoothly. “Well, as you may know, I spent the last year awaiting my trial on house arrest. P- Harry went to check up on me as part of his Auror training, and we hit it off right away. He kept coming back, bringing food, or coffee, and we eventually fell in love.”
The Chief Warlock didn’t seem to notice the unspoken conversation between them. “Mr Potter? Can you confirm that you won’t willingly take Veritaserum to verify your relationship with Mr Malfoy?”
Harry just nods, holding in a comment about the trashy romance novel and heading downstairs to the bar. Evenings are supposed to be free for the teachers, as long as they’re all in their rooms before ten.
“Are you guys enjoying yourselves?” Granger slurs with a smile. Did someone spike the pumpkin juice? Granger’s cheeks are flushed and she looks decidedly drunk. She doesn’t wait for an answer before continuing. “Ron and I just met
“No problem,” Potter replied, smirking at Draco. Draco sighed in resignation, then turned to give Molly another forced smile.
They talk about everything and nothing. Malfoy talks about growing up in the Manor. Harry talks about growing up with the Dursleys. When Harry tells him about living in the cupboard, Draco threatens to track down and kill Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. His face is all scrunched up and snooty and his cheeks are flushed and Harry wants to kiss him again.
, and then he’s biting Harry’s lip, and the kiss turns hot and frantic, and Harry backs Draco up against the wall, not able to get enough. Something crashes to the ground, and Harry can’t even be bothered to see what it was.
Malfoy takes a moment before replying. “I just finished up my Potions mastery last month. Didn’t know what to do with it. McGonagall gave me an option, and I took it.”
“He’s right, you know,” Draco said softly. “You really could get sent to Azkaban. It’s not worth it. You’re not getting anything out of this.”
Harry clears his throat. “You’re right, though. This is absolutely inappropriate. And in front of Gertrude, too.”
Draco cracks a laugh when Harry mentions the Noods. The waitress brings over their lunch, and they chat about the snakes, and what Harry’s going to name his new practice, and Harry tries to ignore how his heart feels in his chest every time Draco smiles at him.
“Hm? Oh- they’re uh, nice,” Harry replies, feeling the blood rush to his face. “You’re wearing the clothes.”
“Yeah. I was going to say something, actually, we should really work on keeping our stories consistent for when we get interrogated.”
When the tables were cleared, the guests went right back to their shouting and mingling and boisterousness around the house. Draco found himself caught in a conversation with some Weasley great-aunt, who was assaulting him with a long tale about a rabbit she found in her garden.
Harry tries to reel in his laughter. It takes a moment. “Okay, first off, Malfoy, you did great, wearing the Muggle clothes, really, that’s great. Uh, fun fact about Muggles is that they have pretty high expectations, so wearing normal clothes is, er, baseline. Not apparating, that’d be good too, although you’ve been kind enough to walk in the front door so that’s much appreciated. Um, also of note, especially in the veterinary community, we tend to make appointments with clients so that no one has to wait too long.”
That Monday, Harry’s in with a patient, finishing up an annual exam. The ball python looks in perfect health, and he writes just that in his notes. He places the python in her carrier and brings her back to her owner who’s waiting in the lobby, and that’s when he sees, well. He sees Malfoy, wearing Muggle clothes again and holding a small snake in his lap. This time he’s in light blue pyjama pants with clouds on them, and a white button-down dress shirt. Harry holds in a snort and keeps his professional facade, handing the ball python back to Mrs. Harris.
Harry grabbed his arms and gently urged him away from the rail. “Aren’t you afraid of boats? And water? Come on.”
It’s a charity event, though Harry can’t remember what charity it’s for until they make it to the banquet hall and see the signs. It’s called
“Sorry – it’s not obvious, I guess. Just a weirdly deep topic for the two of us to get into, isn’t it?”
“I don’t have them every night anymore,” Harry tells him. “I do still get them. But not as often. I’m in the common room every night because I want to spend time with you.”
“You’re alive now,” Draco says, feeling like he needs to remind him of this fact. “The people you love are, too.”
Arthur had helped with the gnomes, but he’d been acting distant, and Harry decided he’d be more productive at work.
“Malfoy, he’s not discriminating against you,” Harry sighs. “And wasn’t the entire Wizarding veterinary community discriminating against you? You weren’t mad about that.”
Harry finally moved away from Draco and sat down in an empty chair, gesturing for him to do the same. “What do you want?”
Draco narrows his eyes. Was Potter giving up already? He stands up, taking Potter’s question as an invitation to leave.
“Glad we’re on the same page,” Harry replies, then goes back to reviewing his speech. Malfoy snatches the parchment away from him and begins to read.
“And that’s okay. We learn new things about ourselves all the time. Sometimes, those things are bigger than others. Sometimes, they change everything. But that’s not terrible. You’re learning about yourself, Harry. That can only be a good thing.”
does not. I mean, what did I do to offend him? Is it the tattoos? Am I matching too well? On that note, I must add, the fact that I was able to match even these dreadful Muggle clothes only goes to show my incredible taste. Is that it, Potter? Is my taste too good? Has my taste offended him?”
“Sorry, Malfoy, not the best table for someone afraid of the water.” Harry kept his tone light, but he was starting to get a little concerned. Malfoy was leaning as far away from the rail as possible, staring at the menu on their table.
Draco is edging into dangerous territory. He and Potter sit on the common room floor chatting nearly every night. And instead of snapping insults at each other, they’re snapping… well, they’re still snapping insults, really. But it’s lighthearted, and it makes Draco feel warm inside every time Potter calls him a tosser.
And the game continues. They go back and forth, laughing at each other, but Draco can’t seem to focus anymore. Until Potter’s name is called.
Draco wiggles around, moving into the sheets. His leg brushes up against Harry’s. “Do you… do you want to room with them? Since you’re… since you’re potentially… that is to say, if you think you aren’t a man, would you rather room with – not me?”
“I know,” Potter says, almost kindly. “And I should apologize too… I was a dick to you as well. And I’ll never forgive myself for almost killing you.”
“Of course I’ll help,” Harry replies. He chose this career so he could help. “No one’s in right now, come, follow me.”
“I was miserable at the ball because I thought you were leading up to some cruel prank. I would have deserved it. I’ve done awful things. Things so awful I never could have imagined that you’d like me back. Until you kissed me. But for the record, I’ve liked you since… first year, probably.”
“You haven’t been to class in three days, mate,” Ron tells him. Harry’s quite aware, and wants to tell Ron so, but he’s been trying to work on the sarcasm lately.
Malfoy leaned forward in his chair, pushing up his sleeves and resting his thin forearms against the table. “Okay. Well, we have how we got together, and how you proposed. What else will he ask us?”
Officially, Harry was in training for six more months. Unofficially, he’d already gone along on missions to take down Death Eaters in hiding.
“Er. For example. Harry went to the lobby to get his room key. Harry went to the lobby to get their room key.”
Ron raised an eyebrow. “I got here ten minutes ago to help Mum with something, and I haven’t seen him. Haven’t seen Mum either, actually, do you know where she’s gone off to?”
The inside of the house was filled with magical items bobbing about, but Draco barely had a chance to look around before the guests started arriving. There were a few people he recognized, but most of the people were redheaded and entirely unfamiliar. In the crowd, Draco was able to spot Ronald and Ginevra Weasley, and Granger as well. He thought he got a glimpse of Luna, too.
, but didn’t you say I hadn’t seen all your snakes? I don’t remember meeting any new ones after that.”
Their first activity is to form some sort of human rope, where they have to tangle themselves up and then untangle without releasing each other's hands. Nearly everyone in the eighth year group rolls their eyes, but not even the Slytherins complain out loud. Of course Harry ends up with Malfoy’s bony wrist tangled under his arm. Harry deliberately avoids eye contact, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to react anyways.
Neville, the truest Gryffindor of all of them, is the first to guess. "The lie is that two were atrocious," he offers haphazardly.
Rather than the typical tinge of pink, Malfoy’s cheeks turn a burning, bright red. “Well, I- How dare you accuse me of- As if I wasn’t-” Malfoy splutters some more and Harry realizes: Malfoy’s self-conscious.
During the trial, Malfoy had confessed to everything he had done, had turned Lucius in, had spoken with a strength of emotion that nearly had Harry moved to tears. Harry knows Malfoy regrets his role in the war. After seeing his left arm covered in ugly scars, there’s no doubt about that. But he’s still Malfoy, he’s still an asshole, and he won’t stop harassing Harry. And with the eighth years all living together, eating together, and taking all the same classes, Harry can’t escape from him.
“You know I’m dating Luna, yes?” Ginevra’s laughter finally began to subside. “Harry and I are good friends, we’re definitely not compatible romantically. And let’s be honest, you ending up with Harry is not much of a surprise.”
“It’s a sex pun! Sex puns are for upstairs!” Harry’s trying to sound exasperated, but really he’s holding back a laugh.
“It just seems like…” Harry bites his lip. “Do you have a problem with me? I can leave. I don’t mean to bother you, I just thought we got along fine in school, you know?”
“You must be Harry and Draco! Mr Potter, I’d recognize you anywhere, I would have gladly given you and your fiancé a free dinner cruise around the channel, but then with you being Molly’s boy too! Well, it’s just a pleasure to meet you.”
Aunt Betta was happy to move on to her next victim, and Draco was whisked away by Granger and Weasley — Ronald Weasley — into an empty room.
Harry starts going to class again. He tries to pretend everything’s the same. He goes to the library with Ron and Hermione. He does the bare minimum on his homework. He eats his meals in the Great Hall.
“Malfoy, you know it’s a good thing to get the snakes looked at regularly, right? They should definitely have at least annual appointments to evaluate their health. You don’t need to pretend something’s wrong just to have me do an exam.”
“Oh, just call me Peter. And Mr Malfoy, wonderful to see you too, Molly’s told me great things! Now, follow me, everyone else has already boarded.”
Malfoy’s face turns a violent shade of red. “Sorry, just- Pansy- Pansy calls them the Noods. The Noodles. Because they’re, you know…” he trails off.
Harry’s just Transfigured the bed into two for the first time in over a week when Draco walks in and slams the door.
When they pull away, Harry is mesmerized by Draco’s beaming smile. He’s never seen anything so beautiful in his entire life.
Betsy steps up to the microphone again. “Alright folks, last question. You’re allowed to give a bit longer of an answer. How did your parents contribute to your education?”
Healer Vincent approved their petition, and after a long speech to the eighth years about how he expects them all to do the activities, he says he trusts them and will allow the socials to occur, as scheduled, in the eighth year common room. Draco is on his way to their second social, rounding the last corner before the common room when Potter bumps into him, spilling his entire bag and knocking Draco over.
him, and with good reason, but it took over a year for them to go back to their regular correspondence and monthly teas), Harry decided to go with, arguably, the strangest talent on his list. Snakes.
Mrs Weasley had barely paused as she spoke, but now she looked at them both expectantly. “Well? Is that all right?”
“My mother is sick, Potter.” Draco pushed away from Potter, who barely budged. “The trials took too much out of her. The war took too much out of her. She’s on probation for three more years. She wouldn’t be able to visit me if I’m outside the country, and I need to be there for her.”
Harry’s stopped responding to the comments. He can’t anymore. He looks up at Malfoy’s face and instead of a retort rising in him, he sees those high cheekbones, that flawless porcelain skin, those piercing gray eyes, and the words refuse to form.
Hermione helped a lot; they made a list of all the things Harry was good at. After a short-lived position at Hogwarts as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor (McGonagall had
“Never have I ever had sex with a man,” Goyle says with a grin. These past few weeks, he’s started talking more, and Harry’s growing to like him. He glances around the group as a few put fingers down. Hermione, Dean, Seamus, Susan, and... Harry gulps as Malfoy looks him in the eye while putting a finger down. Harry tries to read his expression, but it’s as blank as ever.
“Oh, I can do kinky.” Harry hears what he’s said and immediately blushes, but is rewarded by Draco’s beautiful laugh.
Malfoy turned and smiled at him, and Harry’s heart squeezed. They stood there watching the sunset in silence for several minutes, until the boat started jerking in the water, turning upwards and shifting down aggressively.
“Yeah, mate, we know.” Ron comes across and sits on Harry’s other side. His two friends wrap their arms around him.
Blood rushes to Harry’s cheeks. And to other places. “Ah,” he says, leaning in across the table. “That sounds vaguely familiar. I believe a reintroduction may be in order, though.”
Harry nods, looking back to the front. He’s got no problem sitting next to Malfoy if Malfoy has no problem sitting next to him. A woman with purple hair walks up in front of the screen, turns on a slide presentation, and introduces the teacher training retreat programme.
“Well, I try to ask them about their condition, but usually snakes are big liars,” Harry explains. “Even if they feel like shit, they’ll tell me they feel excellent. So either way, I do an exam, but it helps if I talk them through it. Mostly, we gossip.”
Harry turns his head to find Malfoy laying on his side, looking at Harry. It’s too dark to read his expression, but he seems relaxed. Comfortable.
Harry sighs. “I thought I made myself clear. But yes. I like you. I’ve liked you for a long time, turns out.”
She handed them the tray, and Harry scooped a forkful of eggs into his mouth instead of answering. Malfoy took his arm from behind Harry and moved it so he could grab his own plate. “Er, we’re very excited,” Malfoy said. “Can’t wait.” Malfoy’s voice was still gravelly from waking up, and had it been any other man, Harry would have been in trouble.
Malfoy’s got an odd expression on his face. “Do you speak Parseltongue to the nonmagical snakes, too?”
“When Charlie came home for the summer, you would not stop checking him out. Isn’t that why you and Ginny broke up?” he continues.
Draco thought of Potter’s earnest testimony in his favor. He thought of obscure old laws from the books he’d been studying during his probation. And then, a plan started to form in his head.
He’s holding out hope that maybe… maybe Pansy and Greg didn’t know about it. Maybe they really are still his friends.
The first bite was delicious, and it only got better from there. Malfoy appeared to be enjoying the meal just as much as Harry, groaning and humming to himself as he chewed and only looking warily at the water every few minutes.
“Why do you keep coming here?” Harry asks one day, unable to hold it in any longer. He’s seen nearly ten of Malfoy’s snakes, and it doesn’t seem like there’s an end. “Nothing’s wrong with the snakes. I think you know that.”
Draco’s mouth twitches. “How disappointing,” he says. “You certainly aren’t implying that sex is for upstairs only?”
Draco gives his answer by leaning in. And if Harry had thought his lips were soft before, this time, they’re heaven, moving against their own. Harry grabs Draco’s hips and pulls him in, needing the warmth of his body.
Draco’s standing there, his bright hair mussed for once and his pale skin stark against his black pyjamas. His grey eyes are storming.
Another crewmate set them up in the captain’s quarters with blankets and cocoa to dry off and warm up. Draco refused to let go of Harry, but Harry was too cold himself to want him to let go. And a softer part of Harry needed to feel Draco’s arms around him, as proof that Draco was here, and safe, and next to him.
to have sex with a man,” he says with a smirk. And there’s Harry’s chance. He looks back up at Malfoy, trying to keep his expression just as blank, and puts down a finger. Malfoy blinks, but otherwise doesn’t react. Of course he doesn’t. Why would he care? He’s hated Harry for eight years. He’s not going to like him like that, not after only a few weeks of friendship. Harry’s not sure why he thought coming out would mean anything would change between them.
Harry cuts him off again with another kiss, slow but fierce. When they pull apart, Draco’s giving him a soft look.
“Well, you were in the room, I’m not about to gossip in front of your face, even if you can’t understand it.” Malfoy scoffs at that. “Plus, the snakes usually start it. Your snakes haven’t done any ranting about you, to me at least. But it seems as if you’ve got plenty living together, I’m sure they do their fair share of gossip at home.” Malfoy looks vaguely offended.
Molly’s smile seemed relieved. “I’m glad to hear it. I just worry about our Harry… Sometimes, I’m afraid he doesn’t feel like part of the family.”
Draco groans as he takes a sip, and the sound goes right down Harry’s spine. “Thanks, you’re a lifesaver.”
Dave looks like he’s going to argue about the money some more, but Harry just waves him off and walks to the back. Dave did have a good point though, Harry thinks. About the trousers.
“You’re welcome to do whatever you wish,” Malfoy replies, flipping the book open. Harry can’t read the cover, but there’s a half-naked bloke on the front with a scantily clad woman wrapped around him. “We’re roommates; we’re not married.”
“Thank you, dear.” Molly sighed. “I hope you're right. I’m sure he’s told you all about the horrible Muggles who raised him. It sometimes seems like they left a lasting impression on him. I’m glad that he has you to show him how much love he deserves.”
Malfoy frowns, but it seems like he’s calmed down at least a little bit. “But you haven’t made me wait.”
Harry goes into Hermione’s room that night. Pansy’s gone and Ron is there, which is just what he’s hoping.
“And my dad was a wizard, and Indian. They hated him, and they hated my mum for marrying him. So they hated me. I didn’t belong in their perfect, white, suburban home.” He scoffed.
Harry takes in a quick breath. “You… I’ve liked you since sixth year at least, but probably earlier. Draco, you don’t deserve cruelty. You did terrible things. And you’ve apologised. And you’re making up for them every day. Don’t you think I see how you go out of your way to help others? Hermione would be the only person in our year passing potions besides you if you weren’t helping us all with our NEWTS. You’ve stayed awake, comforting me when I have nightmares and talking with me all night when I don’t. How am I supposed to not fall in love with you?”
“Er, it’s fine,” Harry replies, biting his lip. His discomfort from Hermione’s initial use of the wrong pronoun deepens. “No worries. I imagine they wouldn’t want you to make a big deal of it.”
“And you’re aware that lying about Wilkie’s Law could result in a six month stint in Azkaban?” Gilbertson looked smug.
One of the nights, Harry can’t help but grab Malfoy’s arm, where he knows the scars are. They don’t say anything. Harry just holds his forearm, gently, like it’s going to break. And when he lets go, Malfoy makes a stupid joke about three wizards and a pub and it’s like it never happened.
“Obviously not, I just - sorry, nevermind.” Harry’s face is warm. Padma looks at him strangely, but doesn’t follow up, instead getting the group activity started.
After wandering through the Muggle mall a while, he decides upon a framed wall hanging. It’s got a picture of a snake, curled up on a pile of books. The snake has on a collar, a small mustache, and gray hair. It says ‘William Snakespeare.’ Harry’s not sure if Draco will get the reference, but he’s hopeful.
Draco pays for lunch- again- and when they make it to the apparition point, Harry wants so badly to kiss him that he has to look at his shoes when he says goodbye.
“Oh, so Hermione has to answer your invasive questions but Malfoy can’t do his dare?” Thomas challenges. Pansy looks to Draco, who sighs.
Betsy starts the teachers off Monday morning with their first activity. Harry’s relieved he doesn’t have to listen to another lecture, but also, that means… Malfoy.
Draco crinkles his eyes in amusement, then looks at Harry seriously. “Did it make you feel uncomfortable? Hearing ‘he’ pronouns used for you?”
“These ones?” Malfoy asks him. Dave counts the money, and though baffled, helps Malfoy count out the proper bills.
Harry peeks in the pouch and sees it’s filled with Galleons- Harry has no idea how many, but it’s certainly more than he charges his clients. Although, to be honest, he totally forgot to ask Malfoy for payment in the first place. He moves to unwrap the other item, and finds a throw pillow inside.
Harry finishes typing up his report. His last patient was Roger, a particularly grumpy Mexican Black Kingsnake just in for a regular checkup. He’s submitting the report when he hears the bell ring in the front lobby.
“As you’ve probably guessed,” Betsy’s voice calls through the speakers, “you’ll be completing an obstacle course with your partner. The fastest two pairs will be competing in the final! Good luck, everyone.”
Harry likes everything about Draco. His laugh, his sarcasm, that glint in his eye when he’s making fun of Harry. He listens to Harry, and cares about his snakes, and he’s probably the most beautiful man Harry’s ever seen.
means, but then Ron’s yelling at everyone to shut up about Harry’s sexuality, and the game continues.
“Wait, I wanted to ask about that too. Why’d you leave Hogwarts? The Prophet said you were fired.” He snorts. Harry does not.
There’s a big screen at one end of the ballroom and a good setup of chairs, and Harry heads to the front. There’s a marker and a blank name tag on the seat, and he fills it out.
And again, what is Draco supposed to say? To Potter? His celebrity crush turned nemesis turned enemy turned spiteful classmate turned- what is this now? Confidant?
“It’s nothing against you personally. It’s just, I went to school with you, yeah? And every year, there was a crisis, and I know they weren’t
Potter’s emerald eyes are stark against his brown skin and he looks as breathless as Draco feels, until something shuts in his face and he stands up. “Dare completed,” Potter snaps. “Hope you all enjoyed the show.” And he stomps away to the dormitories. A door slams shut.
, right? I know all about you, Malfoy. Donating just enough money to make people think you’re a changed person, even living in Muggle London, paying your elves. And you know what’s worse? I believed it all, at first. I thought you were a better person, going to become someone with honour. I even…” Potter used his thumb and forefinger to rub at his eyes, not quite chuckling, “I even fancied you at one point.”
Hermione and Ron tagged along with him on the next trip to the manor. It was a dreary day, the sky full of dark clouds.  Hermione had made a small loaf cake for them to snack on with tea. They sat under umbrellas on the sidewalk outside the gate like it was perfectly normal for three adults to do so while having tea and cake, catching up on the latest news from the Ministry.
It was Ron’s first full year of being an Auror. For a couple of years after they’d finished Hogwarts, Harry had helped Ron train for the exam. Ron had been disappointed to learn that being an Auror-in-training was dramatically different than being a full Auror. He was only allowed to observe cases most of the time, which seemed to frustrate him more than anything. Now he can actually lead a case, investigate, and even weigh in on other people’s cases. Harry noticed he’s definitely a lot happier now.
Harry apparated home and the worry immediately set in. What if the house was in such disrepair that his presence wouldn’t be enough to fix it? Obviously he’s handy and he can renovate it without an issue, but the memories of what the property used to be would be tarnished. Just look at what he did to Grimmauld Place. He completely changed it, barely keeping anything that reminded him of what the house used to look like, aside from his memories of course. Most of it was either locked away at Gringott’s or destroyed. Harry briefly wondered if he had desecrated the House of Black by changing everything, and then reminded himself that most of that family had been awful to him, with the exception of Andromeda, Draco, and Sirius. He wanted to keep as much of the memory of the manor as possible, but doubt was starting to kick in.
Neville clapped him on the back, while Luna pressed a kiss to his cheek and hugged him. Dean and Seamus both hoisted him into the air in celebration, even though Harry insisted they put him down and that there wasn’t a reason to celebrate because his team had lost.
Hermione flooed in hours later while Harry was being a self-proclaimed lazy slob. All he wore were joggers and an oversized t-shirt that was either one of Dudley’s hand-me-downs or one he’d stretched out so much it could now fit two of him. He was lounging on the couch, one leg swung over the back and the other foot firmly on the floor. A bag of crisps sat on the floor next to his hanging arm, nearly empty.
Malfoy’s smile faded and he eyed Harry for a few moments, a thoughtful expression on his face. Suddenly he was up out of his chair and pulling a couple books off the shelf, flipping through them quickly. Harry briefly admired the plains of Malfoy’s back. The wide set shoulders cascading down into his small waist where it curved out slightly. Malfoy began mumbling to himself, which knocked some sense into Harry, but all he could decipher was the word “abandonment”.
Draco stopped in his tracks and turned towards the shorter man, an eyebrow raised in skepticism. “Were we on the same date? Everything went wrong, you know. The wine, the food, that waitress that was flirting with you the entire time? And having to wait for a table like that?” Draco exclaimed, “That was the worst part! Having to watch other people enjoy their meals while we were packed in like sardines, honestly!”
Harry dug the scroll out of his bag and held it out. “I found this in my vault last week, and was wondering how it had come to be there.” He stood up straight as the goblin’s long, spiky fingers reached out for the parchment. His black eyes scanned it, before handing it back with a pointed look at Harry’s forehead.
“Fuck,” someone groaned, stirring Draco from his half-sleep. “Fuck, is that Malfoy? Bugger…” they said and Draco felt movement on the other side of his bed. He pulled the covers down to reveal his face, hoping he didn’t look as unattractive as he felt in his current state.
He’d successfully avoided the Weasleys for the past few years, and frankly he intended to keep it that way.
“Malfoy!” Thomas laugh-shouted, his chair scooting back several inches as he stood up and thumped Draco on the back, forcing him to stumble forward. Draco, shocked and just a little bit suspicious, nodded as if Thomas had asked him a question. Thomas wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him up against his side and giving Draco a strong whiff of his cologne, mixed with the scent of alcohol and sweat lingering in the bar. “Mayfoy. Shit—,” Thomas laughed, “
If this had happened several years ago, Harry would be too weirded out to stick around in the dark room. He would have stoked the fire, illuminated every candle, just to feel some semblance of life in the house. Now he could honestly say he felt comfortable in every room. He wasn’t being stared at by the heads of Black family house elves or creepy portraits of distant relatives, and Kreacher didn’t roam the halls as much, scaring Harry when he appeared in a room with a loud Crack! It was better now.
Draco hailed the bartender and sent a drink Potter’s way, just for the hell of it. That’s what he was here for anyway, he may as well just start the process. Draco almost laughed when the drink was set in front of Potter and Potter, always the Gryffindor, explained he hadn’t ordered the drink. A few quick words were exchanged before the bartender backed away to help others. Potter looked around, and that was Draco’s chance. He raised his glass to Potter, making heavy eye contact, then took a long pull from it. Potter, clearly confused, nodded to Draco and took a hesitant sip.
Draco leaned over the table, keeping his hips far away so he didn’t accidentally bump against it, and settled his focus on the tower. He concentrated on figuring out the weight distribution, where he could put his glass and not have it fall or knock the whole thing down.
Normally when discussions over his “boy wonder” life happened, he got angry, but there was a little glint in Neville’s eye, a tiny little smile at the corner of his mouth, that told Harry that he was joking. Truly, Harry thanked his friends constantly for not trapping him on that pedestal that the rest of the public wanted him on.
Rosita’s was a crowded restaurant, yet the noise level was so low Draco surmised that nearly every table was under a

The meeting went smoothly after that. Harry made minor adjustments to his sketches while Neville made a pot of tea and helped his worker in the store. Together, the two former Gryffindors laid out a doable plan for the new shop, somewhat similar to the one they were currently standing in. At last, Harry excused himself, rolling the prints up and bidding Neville adieu.
“Fine,” Draco agreed, pulling Harry in for one last peck before pushing him out the door. Harry nodded politely to Draco’s client as they passed each other, and then waited until the door was closed again to grin like a maniac.
She yanked the blanket more on her side and sighed. “Malfoy.” But Harry barely heard her, eyes falling shut. She kicked him swiftly in the shin and he yelped.
Draco leaned in for a proper kiss despite both of their lack of brushed teeth, hands splayed on Harry’s waist. When they pulled apart, Draco’s eyes glanced past Harry’s head before returning. “You know your elf has been watching us this whole time,” he informed, a lazy smirk appearing and making Harry weak in the knees.
He and Draco stared at each other for a moment, not sure what was passing between them, but before he knew what he was doing, Harry rushed back down the hall, pushed at Draco’s chest, and slammed the office door shut. Draco let out a short, excited laugh that made Harry grin so wide he could feel his cheeks stretching and his eyes crinkling. He pulled Draco in, their smiles fading as they leaned closer and closer. His arms wrapped around Draco’s waist as they kissed, their lips slotting together just right and Draco letting out the most deliciously surprised noise.
Draco’s legs were crossed as he sat, but as Harry nudged the topmost knee, he let his crossed leg fall back to flat. Harry seated himself in his lap, one hand sliding up Draco’s neck to cup his jaw while the other rested lightly on Draco’s ribs, careful not to wrinkle his work shirt. For a few moments, they just rested their foreheads together, breathing quietly, staring into each other’s eyes. Harry finally leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s, tilting his head ever so that their lips slotted together nicely. Draco sighed into the kiss, his tense shoulders falling into a relaxed position as Harry parted his lips.
Harry heaved a gigantic sigh and threw the covers off himself, taking a moment to sit on the edge of his bed before he committed to touching his feet to the cold floor. He pushed himself up and pulled on the pair of pants he’d worn last night, shuffling out into the hallway and down the stairs. Draco had a scarf wrapped around his neck, despite it still being mid-summer outside, and Harry found a small, sheepish smile for him.
Harry shook his head, watching a cloud that faintly reminded him of the Hufflepuff mascot, the badger, roll across the sky. It’s head was slowly morphing into something different, and after a moment it had taken on a completely different shape.
A pleasant, deep, woodsy scent clung to Harry’s senses, pulling him in further until he realized just how close he had leaned. His arse was barely on the chair anymore, and if he moved any further forward he would surely end up on the polished floor. He forced himself to move back, just to avoid that situation, despite something inside him telling him to move closer.
Potter’s shirt came off next, getting caught on his glasses and sending them clattering to the floor. They stumbled their way to Draco’s bedroom, taking turns pressing each other against walls and furniture. Draco was thankful his precious vase collection was housed at the Manor, because Potter was not being gentle in the least. He pushed Potter down on the bed, grabbing a hold of the hems of Potter’s trousers and yanking them down his legs sharply.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Well you two weren’t exactly discreet. I’m surprised the Prophet hasn’t gotten wind of it, considering several people saw you and Malfoy holding hands in Diagon Alley.”
Having visited his vault what seemed like a million times, Harry began shoveling coins into his small, drawstring bag without even a second look. It was only when a large pyramid of coins toppled over that he spotted it among the glittering gold. A piece of parchment was coiled up among the pieces, a slight blue glow surrounding it. Harry reached for it and the parchment emitted an orange spark once his fingers connected. He slowly unraveled the scroll, eyes flitting across the page as the words registered in his brain.
The war had changed things. Many house-elves were freed in the aftermath, but most still preferred to be employed. The Malfoy elves were offered freedom when Draco became the head of the Malfoy estate. He’d stood in the kitchen of the Manor, the lot of them staring at him with wide, bulging eyes as he’d begun speaking, but in an act of disloyalty — or perhaps an overabundance of loyalty — they had merely turned back to their work and ignored the rest of his speech. Draco had resigned to giving them each one day off per week and a small salary. Most of the elves kept their money in sacks under their thin pillows, without the thought of ever using it, but Draco had given it to them and that was all that mattered.
“I don’t really think about you, Malfoy. Ever. We’re not friends, we don’t have anything in common, and we’ve not spoken to each other since your trial and that was years ago.”
That caught his attention right away. “Really? I’m surprised it’d be that close to…” he trailed off, looking off to the side. A silence grew between them as memories seemed to float through Harry’s head. After a few moments, he snapped out of it.
“You haven’t. You’re still the same blood purist, attention-hogging little brat you were at Hogwarts.”
This certainly must have looked odd to passersby, but the nearest neighbor seemed to be more than a mile away from where Harry sat. He attempted to clear his mind, pointedly trying to erase thoughts of how stupid having tea outside the locked iron gate of your abandoned mansion would look to someone strolling by. He drank slowly, methodically, and took a bite of biscuit precisely after every third sip of tea. He needed to be present for this.
Monday morning left Harry stirring in bed, throwing the blanket over his head to block out the bright sun shining straight through the window. Somehow the square of light hit his face perfectly every single morning.
be his family. But he ached for his parents to be sitting across from him at this table. He wanted to see his father’s unkempt hair, possibly greying by now were he alive, and his mother’s easy grin, smile lines creasing her cheeks. He wanted to talk to them, be comforted by them, hear all the family gossip and stories of the past. He wanted to know his family.
“One moment please!” Draco called, eyes a bit panicked. He immediately stepped back from Harry and tried to smooth out his shirt, conjuring up a mirror to fix his disheveled hair. When he looked like he hadn’t just been making out with Harry Potter for several minutes, he turned back to him and woefully said, “I’ve another client.”
Draco scoffed, pressing a light kiss to Harry’s forehead and backing away. “Don’t lose your position on my behalf,” he teased.
A house elf appeared in front of them with a loud crack, and then squealed at the sight of him. “Master Harry Potter, sir!” She curtsied low, her floral printed tea cloth dragging across the floor. “I is Bippy, Master’s elf! I is yours to command!”
She nodded and took a sip of her wine. Harry leant over the cake that was situated on the counter nearby and licked his lips. Andromeda shot him a look of warning, and Harry regrettably backed off. He rounded the island and pressed a polite kiss to her cheek. “Ron and Hermione should be arriving soon. Where’s the birthday boy?”
“Well that was the worst date in history,” Draco said casually, grinning down at Harry despite his proclamation. Their hands swung between them as they walked, no destination in mind.
They both leaned in, eyes closing, but before they could press their lips together, Harry heard someone say, “Harry, dear! There you are!” They both pulled back quickly and Harry reluctantly let go of Malfoy’s arm. Draco’s fingers lingered on Harry’s elbow, but retreated as well when the source of the voice arrived.
“Here,” Malfoy flicked his wand and copied a few pages of the text, handing them to Harry. He glanced at them before doing a double-take.
Harry sighed as he touched his wand to the cool metal of his vault, his breath slipping through his lips in wispy puffs that curled upward before disappearing. The heavy door lurched to the side, allowing him entrance. He took a moment just to stare at his fortune, which was beginning to look depleted and significantly different from the mountain of gold he remembered from when he was eleven. It used to be taller than him, but now only came up just above his knee. He was in no means struggling for money, and he really didn’t have to change anything about his spending habits at all, but if he wished to save money for the future he’d need to get a job. The only issue was that he quite enjoyed the time he was spending focusing on his hobbies.
He could already smell the fresh baked bread before he even opened the door. The bell rang as Draco slipped inside and he took a long look at the cakes in the display case, trying to decide what would be best for the party.
Potter merely raised an eyebrow. “What do you want from me, Malfoy? I can’t forgive you. I can’t understand. Your entire life, you chose the wrong side. Snape,” Draco flinched at that, “the executioner in third year.
It was at this point Draco realised they still hadn’t spoken, so he set his hands on the table in a businesslike manner and cleared his throat. Potter’s eyes flicked up to meet his own and he slowly set down the menu.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he watched Draco’s retreating silhouette, but summoned a pair of joggers and a loose t-shirt from his wardrobe.
Smiling, Potter reached for an order form. Gods, he was beautiful when he smiled. “Hmm. A cake for that many people would probably take too long. I think we would be able to make some assorted cookies if you think that would work for the party. All Valentine’s themed, of course.” He began filling out the form while Draco just nodded along and took in the rest of the store. A few sets of tables and chairs were cleaned and empty and there was a small stage set up in the corner which looked like it was only big enough for one person.
“I can’t have you two sacrificing your jobs for me.” He shrugged, pulling at a loose thread at the bottom of his jeans. “Besides,” he started, jokingly, “who else will take care of me when I’m old and crusty?”
Potter seemed to weigh his options for a few seconds before declaring, “Fine. Meet me at Rosita’s, by the owl emporium. Seven o’clock.”
Draco just stared at him for a moment before scoffing and continuing their walk. “I didn’t realize how sappy you are when you’ve had wine.”
An elbow to the ribs ripped him out of his thoughts and he looked to Ginny who sat next to him. She just stared back. His gaze moved around the table, noticing everyone watching him in anticipation. The sudden focus of attention on him made his palms sweat and he smiled nervously. “What’s happening?” he dared to ask, trying to nonchalantly wipe the sweat that had gathered at his brow.
Thomas… Draco set his drink down behind him and reached into his breast pocket, finding his little blue book where it often was. He flipped to the back, eyes scanning the list of names. Thomas wasn’t on it, but Draco had heard rumours at Hogwarts of Thomas hooking up with girls and boys alike. Most famously with the youngest Weasley before Potter supposedly stole her away. Draco wasn’t opposed to trying; Thomas was mildly attractive. Not what Draco would typically choose for himself, but, hell, he’d try anything for one night. Thomas had grown at least another few inches since the war, making him loom over a majority of his friends, only rivalling perhaps Potter’s Weasley, who’d long surpassed his peers in height.
“Mm,” was Draco’s only answer. His eyes shut again, covers pulled up, drifting in and out to the sounds of Thomas gathering his clothes.
Settling down in a chair at his dining table, an egg toastie and cup of tea set to his left, Draco reminisced on the past twenty-four hours. Longbottom had left in an embarrassed rush at around three in the morning, barely muttering a goodbye before the door clicked shut behind him. He remembered Longbottom absolutely sloshed at the pub the night before, dancing with anyone and everyone he could get his hands on. He was a terrible dancer but somehow Draco hadn’t minded while several glasses of Ogden’s finest in. After downing the last of his current glass, Draco had sidled up to the Gryffindor on the dance floor and snaked his hands around the front of Longbottom’s waist, grabbing hold of his hips as he ground back against Draco to the beat of the music. Draco hadn’t been expecting anything to happen with the man. Figured once Longbottom turned around and realised who was touching him, feeling him, he’d break off and run straight out the door.
Their conversation drifted to the plans for the new shop, construction and whatnot, which certainly got Harry’s attention. A piece of parchment spread out between them, sketching and erasing and redrawing the layout. This was what Harry liked. Being able to see all the steps in a plan and then executing them to perfection. Creating new layouts for specific instances, like a plant shop. Soon enough, Harry was offering to help Neville with the construction, with the latter wizard urgently accepting.
He gave his best friends a quick hug and insisted that he was going home to clean up and then he’d join them. Once they were all headed for the apparition point, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm. “Thanks for staying. And coming in general,” he quickly added, looking nervously up at the blonde. They began walking to the apparition point together, in silence at first.
“Hi,” he finally croaked out, alarmed by the amount of sleep in his voice. His feet slid across the hardwood floor, a profound lazy feeling preventing him from picking them up properly. When he reached Draco, he threw his arms around the taller man’s neck and planted a sweet kiss on the corner of his mouth. “Won’t you stay for breakfast?”
“Because I’ve kept tabs on you, Malfoy!” Potter nearly exploded. “You really believed I haven’t thought about you? You think I don’t know your little ploy to get all the Gryffindors in bed? You
“If you want,” Neville replied. “Take some time to think it over if you’re unsure. Come by the shop on Friday so we can put those blueprints together like you mentioned, alright? I’ll see you then, mate. Draco.” Neville stood up and patted Harry on the shoulder, nodding towards Draco, and then retreating back to his previous seat across the bar.
“We launched the newest salve today,” Neville started, flipping over a few pieces of parchment while he read them, “bubotuber pus and shrivelfig leaves. Mostly for beauty purposes, but helps with healing as well.”
Harry apparated directly into Ron and Hermione’s living room, startling the pair, whose bodies were slightly more visible than Harry was comfortable with.
“And for Merlin’s sake wear some quieter shoes next time.” Malfoy’s tone was almost… teasing. Harry’s smile grew as he walked down the corridor.
Draco flushed. "I didn't bounce," he snapped. Now that Lothair had drawn attention to it, Draco realized that his entire body ached. He was sure that if he even tried to pick up his sword, he'd fall over. He felt like he had run full tilt into a brick wall. Which, he supposed, wasn't all that far from the truth. His eyes shifted back to Potter as Ilaria leaned over him.
Harry's voice seemed to cut across his thoughts with ease, drawing him back to the conversation. Somewhat stiffly, he turned his head to take in the other two. Harry had switched from his blinding bright smile to something a little more exasperated and was holding out a large forkful of eggs to Gwen, who was looking at it like she might very well lean over and eat them right off Harry's fork. Noticing the brief second where hunger won out over her sense, he stood, the sudden movement startling some of the nearby occupants and jerked Harry up from the table by the back of his shirt, ignoring the startled yelp that escaped the shorter man.
Located on the eastern side of the Manor, the training grounds were made up of a series of interconnecting courtyards. Ilaria had explained that they had once been located out near the stables, but the growth of the stables and the equestrian training grounds had moved them inside to these unused courtyards, which connected to one of the few public entrances into the Manor. Guards were stationed at the gate to regulate the traffic coming through and there were strong wards to prevent anyone from passing into the main portion of the Manor but – unless closed for military use - any citizen could request entrance to use the space. It was how many of the students entered the grounds.
A frustrated and somewhat amused sigh slipped through Hermione's lips as she closed her book. It was clear that she wasn't going to get any reading done while Ron was worked up. "Ron, we've been through this a thousand times. If the Wizarding and Elven bloodlines are combined there is a fifty-fifty chance that the individual in question will inherit the Elven traits. If they do inherit them, the traits do not manifest until the individuals becomes of age and his magic levels become stable enough to support the change. We wouldn't have been able to tell whether or not Harry carried the Elven blood in his family. Harry, himself, wouldn't have known," she explained, hoping that this would be the last time she would have to go over it for the redhead. "Besides, if Voldemort truly had Harry the entire Wizarding world would know. They believe Harry to have beaten him before and Voldemort will not be robbed of the chance to prove his worth."
Lucius' words were starting to blend together, his vision going in and out. Draco hoped desperately that he'd be allowed to fall into unconsciousness, but he's seen his father torture an individual before. There was absolutely no chance he was going to allow it and a broken jaw was going to be the least of Draco's worries. When he didn't respond, Lucius reached forward and firmly gripped his son's jaw and abruptly turned Draco's head to face him. The pain caused by the pressure was excruciating, tearing from him an agonized cry that only seemed to please Lucius all the more.
He and Gwynn had been following the river for quite sometime, having slipped through an opening in the trees seven or eight miles back. Harry hadn't known what he was racing toward, but the same instant that had told him to leave the Manor had urged him to head for the river. With his hearing, he'd been able to hear the commotion long before he'd seen it. When he'd arrived it hadn't been the werewolves that had shocked him. It had been the fact that an individual had slipped past the wards of the kingdom. He may have been new to the realm, but even he was aware that it should not have been possible. Of course, at the time, he hadn't known said individual was Draco Malfoy, a bitter school rival and someone Harry was know racing to save.
Draco just blinked at him like he'd lost his mind. Lothair, however, had a thoughtful look on his face.
"What of Voldemort?" he asked, the quiet question interrupting the brewing argument. He watched as Dumbledore's eyes slid from Lothair to him, that sparkle returning and Harry had a feeling he used that as a means to hide whatever really lied behind them.
"You don't know anything." Harry muttered, moving to brush past him. On his way by, Draco's hand shot out and gripped his arm to keep him from passing. The touch was electric, pulsing through him in an instant. The bond reacted instantly, unlocking the energy and allowing it to flow out through him. Harry felt himself slam into Draco's mind, images flooding into him until he couldn't tell which were his own thoughts and which were Draco's. There was blood, pain, anger, happiness, fear, loneliness. There were so many emotions it was overwhelming. He barely felt it when Draco's fingers unwrapped themselves around his arm and he was thrown back into his own body, an iron wall slammed down on Draco's thoughts.
"Scared, Potter?" the blond asked, the smug look on his face drawing out that all too familiar irritation Harry usually held toward him. The fact that he could so easily get a rise out of Harry should have really been considered a talent. He was just so down right smug some times that Harry wanted to reach out and smack that stupid look right off his face.
"So," Gwynn started, accepting the fact that Harry was set on doing what he had to. She didn't really know a thing about the relationship between the two boys, but it seemed that Harry cared a lot about him. After all, who would risk something like this in order to save another. There was a time for everything to die and he was fighting very hard to make sure this wasn't the time for Draco. "Tell me about him?"
Harry didn't want to think about his coronation. They'd said he'd be crowned by the end of the summer, but Harry didn't feel any closer to being ready for it. In fact, he didn't think he was ready at all and he had to wonder whether or not it was the wisest of decisions. Still, he murmured a thanks you to Ilaria, who nodded her acknowledgement.
"He knows that you're alive and that you've returned to Hogwarts," Snape responded, "Dumbledore made it quite clear that the information was to reach them.
"The kitchen would be a good start." Frankly, Draco could do with a cup of coffee. Despite having been in the Manor for several days now and the influence of his now Elven heritage, he still hadn't quite adjusted to the schedules. His body wanted to be sleeping and it wasn't exactly enthusiastic about being up and about at this time. Coffee would be a good start to staying on his feet.
"I'm sure he's going to lord it over me, though," he muttered, an obvious pout lingering on his lips.
It was not just the wolves, of course, that benefited from the alliance. The wolves acted as an outer defense when it came to unwanted visitors pressing in on the realm. It was a defense that had proven extremely useful in past times and Soren, personally, would be very disappointed to see that go. On top of that, there were many potions of great use that required ingredients taken directly from the race; hair, blood, etc. Freely given items were the only ones used in the creation of these potions and if no alliance existed, access to such items would be impossible.
"Oh, that's beautiful," Ilaria breathed peering around him at the sword in the box. "Long sword. 50 inches. Steel alloy with a magical core and sharpened to perfection. Meant for someone with a long reach, not to mention the physical strength and stamina to swing it. Pick it up!"
"I've tried everything that I know, but nothing is working," she admitted, her regret evident in her voice and Harry knew instantly that she was telling the truth. This woman wouldn't allow anything to stop her, not if she had the choice and strangely enough that made him feel a little better. "His body's not responding to my magic and it's not strong enough to heal on it's own." It was strange, definitely. She'd never had a patient who failed to respond to her magic. Of course, she'd never really worked on a Wizard before, nor anyone with this particular degree of wounds. Normally she didn't contend with both Wizarding magic and creature influence.
"We'll wait for you to leave then, Princess," Harry shot back, his eyes turning from the wolf across from him to pin Lothair with a feigned look of innocence, which left Draco struggling to keep a smirk from tugging at the corner of his lips. "Please don't let the door hit you in the arse on the way out."
Draco blinked through the haze of irritation that he'd allowed to settle over him and glanced toward the wolf now currently walking through the halls of the Manor with him, a bright spot next to Draco's storm of irritation. Right. He was supposed to be showing their newest resident around, which was comical since he'd been having Potter do the same for him no less than an hour before. "I beat the bloody hell out of Potter the other day, though I can't tell if that's something new or something I just finally allowed myself to do," he commented dryly, which earned a laugh from the man beside him.
Feeling Soren's gaze, Lothair returned to his attention in order to offer his own suggestion. "At the current moment, they're not moving inward, merely testing the borders. If we alert the outposts as Ilaria stated, we can keep a closer eye on them. From that vantage point it would be easier to gauge their actions and determine when he appropriate time would be to initiate any protective measures needed."
Draco didn't comment but surged forward, taking the opportunity to go on the offensive as Harry scrambled to gather his wits and his footing. Darting back and out of his reach, Draco grinned at the fury that flashed in the green depths of Potter's eyes. Unable to resist the taunt, Draco lifted his hand and beckoned Harry forward with a smirk.
"That's not-" He made a very loud irritated noise that sounded like a borderline growl. "Why are you still on the Quidditch team?"
he defended, feeling strangely insecure in the face of Draco's anger. He'd never had a problem facing Malfoy down before, and the fact that he now had the distinct urge to retreat irritated Harry. "You're welcome, by the way." he snapped, focusing on that anger in the hopes of forcing away his more passive urges.
Draco glared a moment longer. Free energy was one way of putting it. Idiocy was another. "If you say so," was the only comment he made. Taking a moment, he studied the man beside him. He didn't feel any sort of strength coming from him. In fact, he felt almost ordinary. "You're an omega, aren't you?" he asked, suspiciously. He supposed it made sense. It wasn't like they were on friendly terms with the wolves, so why would they send anyone else.
When she leaned into him further, Harry couldn't quite control his body and he moved forward so quickly it looked to the others like he'd suddenly just appeared in front of Pansy, a dark look on his face as they stood nose to nose. The sudden movement and the threatening aura pouring off of him was enough to startle her back a couple of steps, removing her from Draco's side.
Finally reaching the stables, the group dismounted with only the rustle of cloth and the shuffling steps of the stable hands as they hurried to take the horses from the riders they were assigned to. The guard, having fulfilled their duty, spoke briefly to Ilaria before leaving the rest of them to make their way back into the Manor.
The statement caused a bit of commotion as said High Lords had not been told any of this previously. Ilaria and Lothair looked ready to voice their displeasure. Soren took the opportunity to cut them both off before they could. "And who, exactly, are you planning to take from the realm?"
This time, it was Ilaria who spoke up, a small frown on her face. "If there was a bond between the two, it would have stemmed from Harry's time within the human world. Prior to his inheritance. A mortal bond would not have survived once Harry accepted his Elven heritage. It would have been eradicated with his Wizarding blood and he hasn't been in contact with the mortal world since his transformation."
"It has been said by some that only living creatures, wildlife and humans in particular, have a life force, but that statement couldn't be further from the truth. The world around us is Mother Nature, herself, which means that the very earth is alive beneath us. If only creatures have a life force than how could Mother Nature be full of life, for she is made up of nothing but elements? Every rock, drop of water, and mound of dirt has a life force and, therefore, should be given the proper respect," Soren explained, leading the Harry and Lothair further into the Manor. "This very Manor is made from elements of nature, from the stones used to build the walls to the wood used in the chairs. All of it belongs to her and it carried her spirit within it. Even in the Wizarding world this is so. Did you not notice how Hogwarts seemed to be alive?"
Behind him, Soren heard the distinct sound of someone clearing their throat. Refraining from immediately responding to his mate, he turned to glance back, finding Lothair and Ilaria watching them with interest. It was proof enough of his distraction that he had not heard them enter. Ilaria had the presence of mind to hold a stoic expression, even if her eyes flashed briefly with her amusement. Lothair, unsurprisingly, did nothing to hide the amused smirk that lingered on his pale features. He was, quite clearly, finding the situation particularly amusing, much to Soren's growing irritation.
All eyes turned to Harry at the question. He'd moved to sit on the edge of the wall, his shorter legs missing the ground by half an inch and Draco had a hard time ignoring the flash of a much younger Harry, sitting alone on a swing with a sad smile.
Filling the sink with water, he splashed the cool liquid over his face. It was barely above freezing and offered a sharp burst of awareness. It wasn't a complete solution but it would do temporarily. Drying off, he moved back to the bedroom and tugged a shirt on. There was no point in trying to go back to bed. He knew he wouldn't find sleep again. Glancing to the window, he guessed he had about three hours before the sun fully set, which gave him plenty of time before the Manor began to stir.
"He comes with us," Harry ordered, his eyes narrowing in on the cowering wolf. "Until punishment is decided upon."
Looking into his Father's eyes as the older man smirked, raising the silver dagger now firmly in his grip, Draco fully realized how foolish he had been to believe in what the man had preached. There was no honour in being a Malfoy. The name no longer carried with it any respect, Lucius had seen to that. Narcissa was no longer there to save him and the Malfoy line would end as it currently stood: bloodied and broken. When the dagger met his shoulder, Draco vaguely heard himself scream as the sharpened blade separated skin and muscle with precision and ease. He could feel himself slipping beneath the onslaught of physical and emotional pain, leaving him to do the only thing left available to him: silently plead for the reprieve he wasn't going to get.
Harry just stared at her. She'd finally lost it. Snapped. Crazy. He and Draco? Mates? No. Absolutely not. The would be bonded, not mates. It was, by far, the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard. Just because you share a little blood doesn't mean you're connected in that capacity. Sure, it's intimate, he guessed, but that was it. He stomach turned at the thought of Draco becoming submissive to anyone. He'd absolutely loath the idea. In fact, Harry didn't even know how Draco would react to it and that thought scared him the most. "You're wrong. You have to be."
Standing, Harry shook his head. He couldn't tell Draco about any of it. The bond screamed at him to confide in him, but Harry held back. Whatever Draco was planning to do in the Wizarding world was outside of anything that took place here. No one could know. Not if they wanted to cross the realms border. "I didn't do anything."
"This portkey will take you London," she instructed, placing a silver locket in the palm of his hand and closing his fingers around it securely. "You must find Severus. Tell him I sent you. He'll be expecting it."
She still didn't look all that convinced, but she didn't press further. "Have you spoken to McGonagall yet about Quidditch?" she asked, her eyes studying Harry closely.
Roland's eyes stayed on the creature in front of him, watching for any signs of deceit. When he was satisfied with what he found he straightened and easily slid the dagger, blood and all, into the sheath on his hip. "You're dismissed," he growled, turning his back on his audience before continuing, "And take that trash with you. It's starting to smell." As the wolf behind him scrambled to pull his fallen comrade from the tent, Roland's thoughts drifted. A mortal. He thought, a slow twisted smile stretching across his face as the plan easily unraveled before him. One Potter would risk himself for. Now that sounds like a weakness to me. "It's about time we have a man in the thick of things," he chuckled, taking a seat. His eyes focused on the maps laid out on the table in front of him, but he was seeing something much different. "Bring me the spy. It's about time he does something useful."
Pulling his surprise back under his control, Draco's eyes scanned the room. It was all unfamiliar. He didn't recognize anything and that only sparked a million other questions. What had happened to him? Why was he with Potter? Was this part of Severus' plan? Why had he sent him to Potter of all people? Where Potter went, Dumbledore went. That realization brought a flash of fear to stab through his chest. He was a Death Eater. The Order would not help him.
"But wouldn't we have known if he was some sort of magical creature? What if Voldemort is trying to make it seem like Harry's okay so no one will go looking for him? That bloody Lestrange woman could be torturing him as we speak!"
I do NOT own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. The creation of this story was simply for my own amusement. Everything belonging to the Harry Potter reverse belongs to J.K Rowling. No monetary gain was made from the creation of this story.
"Second, you continue acting as an outer defense for the realm. I've been told that you are an intricate part of our defensive system and I'd like to maintain that," Harry continued, leaning back in his chair with a sigh. He felt like most of his energy had been drained from him and, if he was honest with himself, he just wanted this all to be over with. "And finally," his eyes flickered to Draco briefly before returning to the Alpha, "Draco has to agree with the conditions as well."
Caught not once but twice, Harry flushed slightly. With no other option, he urged Erebus forward. He supposed he might as well speak to her after having been caught staring. The last thing he needed was to offend her. Regardless of whatever else was going on, he needed her skills. That much, he knew, she had. Only a day after he had spoken with Lothair about inquiring about the Potter properties, the older elf had returned with an envelope containing a list of all the Potter's properties and the contents of their vaults. He'd been assured that they were copies of the original documents in order to avoid anyone discovering that they were digging around. He'd been floored but what the contents of that folder had contained. Among the list of properties, there were documents on who had been responsible for the holdings until Harry had come of age. Sirius had originally been charged with the responsibility, but since he'd been arrested shortly after his parent's deaths, it had shifted to Harry's closest living relative: Petunia Dursley. It hadn't made sense. Vernon had always gone on and on about not having had any compensation for taking Harry in. If they'd been in control of the Potter's wealth there should have been large amounts missing. Hell, he'd have been surprised to find anything left at all.
Draco raised an eyebrow at that. Was he going on the defensive immediately or was it a ploy to draw him in. If he let Harry get inside his reach, he knew it was over. Draco's sword was heavier than Potter's slim gladius. Even without being told, Draco knew Harry would be able to maneuver it faster than he was able to move his own. Shifting his left foot back, he dropped the tip of his sword into a fool guard and waited. Let Potter make the first move.
"Because your Father didn't claim his Elven heritage does not mean he isn't entitled to a spot among his for bearers, however, both James and Lily are only minimally documented in our archives. This is so that the bloodline can be traced. They, like you, are a stone in the path that your family has and will continue to walk for generations."
"Creatures of the Earth, made from the very elements of Mother Nature," Soren continued, glad that Harry seemed to be piecing together what he was saying. If he could understand the nature of the world around him than everything else would come easily. "We, to an extent, represent Her. We have our own souls and our own will, but we are her children and everything that is created from her carries with it a sense of her. A signature, if you will. Magic is that signature."
Draco jolted awake with a gasp, wide eyes staring through the darkness to the pale ceiling above him. His heart hammered against his ribs as he pushed himself up. "Shit," he groaned, lifting a hand to brush his hair back, registering the way his hand shook as he lifted it. He'd been having nightmares every night since he'd arrived in this place. Every night he'd seen his Mother and what might be currently happening to her. Every night he'd wake up just like this.
Everyone had been suggesting that a bond between the two of them might have already existed, but Harry was not so sure. There was no explanation as to why said bond would form. He and Draco were worlds apart. He was the son of a Death Eater, Harry was suppose to spend his life fighting Voldemort. One was light and the other dark. The only thing they had ever shared was an intense dislike for each other.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" Harry grunted, trying to maneuver himself into a position to effectively unhook Draco's fingers from his shirt.
The silence in the room spoke volumes as Harry tore his eyes away from Draco and moved to take the only available seat. He sat rigidly, very aware of Draco's presence and the stares he was receiving thanks to his injuries. He wished he'd listened to Soren and had Rosalind heal him.
He'd been impressed by Hogwarts. Who hadn't? The sheer level of magic intertwined to create such a place was an awe inspiring feat of magic. The sheer levels of magic overlapping each other was dizzying to even consider ... but this ... this was beyond Hogwarts.
Potter. Wasn't that they way it was suppose to work. The disappointing son of a Death Eater had bloodied up their Chosen One. He should have already been strung up for it and yet, here he was sitting in on the most absurd meeting he'd ever heard of. Three wolves sat across the table from him, two elves to the right of him, and a chair clearly meant for Potter on his other side. And what were they there for? So Potter could deal out a suitable punishment to the wolf responsible for attacking him.
Lothair nodded, signalling that he'd heard him. "The wards seem entirely secure in this place," he commented, arms crossed, "but that is not to be said about the rest of this castle. Gwynn, you will accompany Harry everywhere. Akkar, you're with Draco. I want eyes on them at all times. The rest of you will control the wider perimeter. Neutralize anything in the castle or on the grounds that might pose a threat to any of us. We'll run the guard in shifts, as per usual. Understood?"
I'm back! I know, I know. It's been a long time since I've updated this story ... or at least that's what it's telling me. I didn't think that I had left it for that long, but who am I to argue? Fact of the matter is that I've been seriously neglectful of it and I apologize to those of you who have read and were hoping for an update. I've reread the story and (for me) it's well written. I honestly don't understand why I stopped writing so I'm going to try and pick it back up. I have a fresh idea as to how the plot lines are going to connect and where I want the story to go so ... here's to hoping I can stick with it. *fingers crossed* I'm sure this update isn't as long as the last one, but I'm just getting back into it.
With barely a glance, Harry had immediately started in on one of the practice dummies. As she watched, her eyebrows rose higher and higher as the minutes rolled by. Piece by piece the dummy fell away as Harry went through each offensive move he'd learned since arriving, continuing until there was nothing but the support pole left to hack away at.
The look on her face said he was clearly missing something. "You should probably go and talk to McGonagall."
Glowering at her lack of answer, he snapped. "Why do we need a sword? Isn't there a million of them in the armory?"
Harry's eyes shot to the side to narrow on Soren. He might have been willing to listen to Soren's earlier advice but he wouldn't go so far as to say that the whole thing was a misunderstanding. "I'm sure there is no misunderstanding as to what happened," he responded, his tone holding a cold, steely undercurrent.
"It's not impossible," he argued, even though he wasn't entirely sure if he could actually dampen them completely.
"Prince, huh?" the man asked, eyeing Harry as though sizing him up. His eyes didn't give anything away, so if he found himself disappointed, Harry couldn't tell. Instead, the man moved to him and offered a his hand. "I'm Daemeon. Well met."
Travelling through the Manor certainly wasn't as easy as one would have thought. Not even Hogwarts contained so many twisting corridors. It didn't help that the landscape of one corridor very rarely changed as he moved to another. After only fifteen minutes he had completely lost all of his bearings and now had no hope of finding his way back to he entrance hall. Soren had said that one of the High Lords would find him when their meeting had been complete and Harry just hoped they could keep their word. If not it was going to be a long time before he saw any one familiar.
Finally, Harry managed to get them both out of the main current where the pull was the strongest. Once he was able to keep his feet locked on the bottom of the riverbed, Harry released the tree branch and returned his free hand to Draco, dragging him out of the water and up onto the grass. Even with his soaking hair hanging in his face, Harry knew that Draco looked bad. There was blood still leaking from several of his wounds, his clothing was torn, and his skin was a deathly blue colour. Most significantly, Harry couldn't deny the sinking realization that Draco wasn't breathing.
Once Harry had started screaming, chaos erupted in the hall. The Slytherins had their wands out, circling around them. Ron had started shooting off hexes in an attempt to get to Harry, leaving Blaize to fend them off before they could hit anyone. Draco had moved to Harry, cursing him for being such a martyr. Gwynn suddenly appeared beside him, Akkar appeared further down the hallway throwing up protective wards to keep out any further spells.
It could not be said that Harry no longer feared what the future had in store for him. Too many varying obstacles still lay in his path for that to be true. The terrifying presence of Roland and the continued pressures from Voldemort were enough to have him worried. He couldn't escape the fear of what the unforeseen future held for him, however, the future wasn't what he feared the most. What he feared was the lurking possibility of failure. He didn't want to remain forever trapped within the confines of
Soren felt a sense of pride swell in his chest. He barely knew the boy in front of him, but he was quite impressed with the sense of curiosity and determination that seemed to swell within the new Prince. "In a sense, the Wizarding worlds irrevocable desire to categorize every thing and everyone has led them to overlook important aspects of the world around them. Muggles are not devoid of magic. The difference between them and their Wizarding counterparts is the level of inherent magic in the blood. To an extent, the Pureblood circles of your previous world have been following through on a logical thought process," at this point, Soren could read the disagreement that had immediately sprung up in Harry's eyes. Silencing him with a small motion of his hand, the older Elf continued his explanation. "Like many other talents, the levels of inherent magic are dispersed through the population. For some, like those who are classified as Muggles, the levels are too low to be able to accomplish any spell casting, but that does not mean that magic does not manifest itself within them. It simply does so on a much smaller scale. For instance, premonitions are caused not by a supernatural force, but rather by the latent magic levels within that particular individual. Pureblood families turn to others of the same magical levels in order to persevere themselves. However, this is not the only way to preserve magic. The levels within us are not something we have a strong sense of control over. There are many individuals who possess a large magical centre, despite the fact that they are the descendants of Muggles."
It was another four days before Hendrik and his second returned to the castle. A visit that had not been expected, least of all by Harry. The last time they had spoken, the Alpha had made it quite clear that he had little to no intention of ever returning, which had suited Harry just fine. He should have known things weren't going to go so smoothly.
"There's absolutely no need for an apology," Dumbledore chuckled, his voice jubilant and friendly despite the chill Harry was getting. Finally, after what felt like hours, those blue eyes shifted from Harry to Lothair, as Dumbledore stood. "We're simply glad that you've arrived. Come, come, you must be hungry."
"Unfortunately," Lucius started again, completely unconcerned with the way his son's jaw was hanging loosely. "I've not been given the order to kill you. The Dark Lord would like to claim that honour for himself and I cannot begrudge him that. He was rather looking forward to having you serve him and is quite displeased with your attitude. You will be made an example of, Draco. No one refuses the Dark Lord."
Grumbling as he stepped out into the lit corridor, Harry shot Draco a dirty look before he stalked off down the hallway, not bothering to wait and make sure the blond was following him. He hated being up early, especially when it involved an irritable blond snarking at him about wanting to be led about the place. Couldn't Soren given him a map or something?
A darker sense of loneliness settled over him, his thoughts shifting to the blond he'd left unconscious in the medical wing. Draco had somehow managed to get through the wards when no one else had been able to. He'd been injured and weak and yet, somehow, he'd gotten through. Harry had known the moment the wards had been breached. He'd instinctively known that the Slytherin had been hurt; that he'd
Harry stiffened at the familiar voice. Spinning around, his eyes scanned the shadows, catching a brief flash of silver hair as Draco shifted. He had to fight the urge to shift nervously as he met Draco's angry stare and it was then that Harry realized that Draco knew. He knew about the bond.
Lothair had been standing at the window, watching the departing form of the Alpha with a displeased look on his face. He was not a fan of the wolves, but he tended not to be a fan of most things these days. He could not be certain that they could be trusted or relied on to keep the safety of the realm. Soren was quick to put his trust in them, but the older elf had been wrong in the past. A mistake, at this point, could cost them everything. Pushing away from the window, he turned to find bright green eyes staring at him. Had it not been for quick reflexes he might have been startled into movement. Instead, a simple eyebrow rose as he watched some of the sleep clear from those eyes. "Sleeping Beauty awakes," he scoffed, moving to the end of Harry's bed, his arms crossed over his chest as he waited for the youth to speak.
"It has nothing to do with poor behaviour. You're an elf," McGonagall said plainly. "Your increased senses and speed give you an unfair advantage over the other students."
More than once did Ilaria have to snap at him, once they had entered the city. He hadn't yet left the castle and the sights that greeted him on the bustling streets were something he'd never have imagined. It reminded him vaguely of the first time he'd been to Diagon Alley. Back then, he'd been amazed by the magic. Signs of it had been everywhere from floating packages to moving bricks. This, however, was something else entirely. Everything was so open and lively that Harry was constantly stopping to stare. There were houses that seemed to have sprung up from the Earth itself, shops of all sorts, scents wafting from windows that he'd never smelled before, and no one seemed to be in a hurry. Everywhere they went, elves were going about their business, chatting with each other, nodding in respect to Ilaria as she passed, and even a few sent him a wave as he trailed after her. They likely thought he was another would be warrior under her care, but Harry couldn't be bothered to correct them. He'd be whatever they thought he was. He was too busy taking in everything around him to care much about titles.
"I want you to think your decision through carefully before you announce it and weigh the consequences," was all that Soren responded with as they reached a heavy set of French doors. Not giving Harry much time by way of a retort, he pulled open the doors and stepped through, allowing the younger man to follow in his wake.
Harry had been stunned by the sheer size of the room when he'd first seen it. He'd wondered why any one person would need so much room, but the answer had hit him not long after. It was not meant for one person. It was meant for a family. The thought had hit him hard. He didn't have a family to share this with. Sure, there was the Weasleys. They were the closest thing to a family Harry had ever known...but he wouldn't be able to share this with them. He'd done enough reading on his own to know that Humans were not permitted to enter the realm under any circumstances. Unless they were all changed, Harry would not be permitted to share his new home with them.
Harry felt, despite the very clear dismissal, that he should apologize again. His mouth opened in an attempt but Soren had already turned from him in order to return the Royal History to its rightful place. It was clear by the rigid posture of the Elf that an apology would fall on deaf ears. Keeping his mouth firmly shut, Harry stood and made a beeline for the door. The last thing he wanted was to upset the High Lord more than he already had.
Draco didn't need to look up to know that Potter was glaring at him. It pleased him. Potter deserved to be irritated. Merlin knew the git irritated the rest of the world on a regular basis. If there had ever been a bigger thorn in his side, Draco had yet to find it and prayed that he never would. Ignoring the idiot, he focused his attention on the woman in front of him, keeping silent for a moment as the energy around him charged as she had warned. When it seemed to calm again, he spoke, "I was under the impression that the Elves did not interfere with our world?"
With a resigned air, Soren turned and followed the other two High Lords from the room. He had not meant to allow it, but a seed of doubt had been embedded in his heart. Control and understanding was quickly slipping through his fingers as, metaphorically, the wolves howled at the gates.
Potter and that left Draco with nothing else to do but gape at him. When had Potter grown up? When had he decided to grow his hair out? More importantly, what the bloody hell was Potter doing with a body like that?
The first thing Harry noticed when he entered the room was the smell. He'd been in St. Mungo's and even a few of the Muggle hospitals in London but had never really noticed the scent. Of course, he'd never been in those places with the increased senses he now possessed and he found himself very glad for that. They would have smelled a lot worse. The door he'd entered had clearly been an entrance into the Manor's hospital wing, something he hadn't even realized they had. The room itself looked like the physical manifestation of sterile. Everything seemed to be a shinning white with flashes of stainless steel intermixed. The smell, however, wasn't as pleasing to the senses as the sight. He could smell the sterile cleaner and varying antiseptics. He honestly didn't know how Rosalind handled it on such a continued basis. Perhaps after years of smelling it, he too wouldn't notice. If past experience was anything to go by, he was sure to be spending a lot of time in this room.
Tearing his eyes away from he now empty hallway, he glanced back to Gwynn. It took him a moment to realize that she was staring down. Then he felt it, the small throbbing pain coming from his palms. Glancing down, he lifted his hands to find his nails embedded into the palms of his hands. Unfurling his tightly clenched hands, his nails slid free to leave four crescent shaped cuts that immediately pooled blood.
Gwynn shot him another look when he didn't explain further, studying him for a moment. She wasn't entirely sure what had shifted in him, but she couldn't say that it was a change for the better. He had been thinking on a more clear level these past few days, but it was frightening. There were times when she glanced away she thought she saw dark tendrils of shadow curling around him from her peripheral only to be gone when she glanced back.
Pushing those thoughts aside, he motioned for Harry to follow him. Heading further into the library, Soren followed a bath through the selves and tables. Normally such discussions would be held in the council hall. It was where war councils and defensive measures were sought to, but with the tension already high he wanted to avoid anything that might spark a flame.
"I don't remember extending you an invitation to my bedroom, Potter," he drawled from the spot on the bed where he had stretched out.
There. That was his opportunity. Before Harry had a chance to responded, Draco took the opportunity. "I do," he confirmed, causing more than a few sets of eyes to snap to him.
He'd just opened his mouth, a scathing comment on the tip of his tongue, when an outstretched hand drew his attention. Glancing up, Harry found Gwynn standing over him, an open and friendly smile on her face as her hand remained there in a helpful offering. Harry was a bit surprised, if he was going to be honest. Gone was the fierce and focused warrior he'd just been facing. In her place stood a girl who looked just like any of his other Hogwarts friends: open, friendly, and just a bit mischievous.
He could hear them in the kitchen and he made a beeline for them, throwing the door open and glancing around until his eyes fell on the culprit. "You!"
"Well that was...interesting?" she hedged, unsure of what to say. The last thing she wanted to do was direct his anger to herself. She had no idea what had caused the outburst, but she was partially glad to have not been a part of it. "I'm going to go out on a ledge here and say something's got your braid in a knot."
Harry frowned for a moment; working through the information that Soren had presented him with. He truly wanted to accept what Soren was saying and he felt himself leaning in that direction, but there was still questions popping into his mind and blocking his acceptance. "But if we all carry the same connection than why are there Muggles?"
Further down the table, Draco was finding himself watching the exchange intently. He was feeling it again; that pressure he'd felt in the courtyard. It had started out subtle but it was rapidly growing. It hung in the air around them. Glancing around, no one else seemed to have felt it. How that was possible, he didn't know. It was stifling.
After several excruciating moments, Harry spotted his hand breaking the surface of the water. Using a bit of the strength he'd tapped into previously, Harry put on a burst of speed to reach a large overhanging branch a few meters or so in front of Draco. Reaching the branch just as Draco passed under it, Harry dove into the water after him, completely disregarding the fast current. For whatever reason, he couldn't let Malfoy die. It was imperative that the blond remained alive and Harry was doing his damned best to ensure that happened. He'd never been much of a swimmer prior to his time in the Elven realm, but Harry found himself moving through the water easily. It barely took any time for him to reach Draco's limp form, an arm wrapping around the other boy's waist as he did his best to keep them both afloat. Even with his new strength and skills, Harry could barely keep Draco's head above the water as he attempted to fight the current and get them to shore.
"Unlike your wizarding magic, you're not drawing the magic from within you. You, yourselves, will be the conduit. You draw the magic from the world around you and bring it into yourself. Once it has become a part of you, you let it flood into the magical core of your weapon."
Gwynn nodded and Lothair turned and headed back into the kitchen. They watched him go before Draco and Gwynn glanced back to the group of students.
Before he could look again, his attention was instantly diverted back to the blond when Draco's back arched as though an invisible force was pulling him upward. The movement forced Draco's head back, allowing the water to spill from his lips. It seemed like an eternity before the water had drained from Draco's lungs; an eternity that had Harry's chest constricting painfully. The moment the water had stopped flowing from Draco's mouth, the force pulling at his chest dissipated, allowing his back to return to the forest floor. The force seeming to kick-start Draco's heart and lungs, his body shaking as it attempted to gasp in some much needed oxygen.
As can be expected, growing up in Malfoy Manor had been everything an individual would have imagined it to be, considering their wealth. Draco had been privileged to large comfortable beds, new broomsticks when he deemed them necessary, tailored clothes, and a million and one places for a child to explore to their hearts content. Unfortunately, Draco was no longer a child and the foundation on which he had built his life was starting to crumble beneath him, leaving the support beams he'd enforced wavering dangerously over his head. His seventeenth birthday had come signalling the end of his childhood. It had come with but one gift attached: a promised initiation into the folds of the Death Eater's circle, complete with a large and painful brand that spoke of nothing but servitude.
There were certain things about being in the Elven realm that Harry particularly loved. The hot springs, for instance, were something Harry was immensely fond of. The water stemmed from deep below the manor, reaching up to break the rock at several points. There were three separate spots in the city where bathing houses had been established to take advantage of the naturally heated water. The last vein ran directly into the manor where it was split off into two separate locations. The first was designated for those who lived and remained in the Manor. The second was, to Harry's surprise and delight, specifically for his use. When Gwynn had mentioned taking some time to relax and prepare himself for the ritual taking place that evening, Harry had instantly thought of the hot spring.
Embarrassment might have been the next step in his thought process, but the sight of the braid indicated that responsibility had not lain with the Elf standing at the end of the bed. Rosalind had taken care of his appearance and he found it hard to find embarrassment in her motherly actions. She had helped Draco and Harry both and, for that, he was beyond grateful.
"Alright, Harry," Rosalind started, drawing the young man's attention back to her. It was crucial that Harry stay focused and determined throughout the process, otherwise the magic involved would taint their intent and the bond would not be formed as it should be, "your part in all of this is pretty simple. Normally, in this sort of bonding, the blood would be ingested orally. Given the state of the young man-"
"What the hell is going on with you?" Draco demanded, his eyes watching Harry intently as though waiting for a confirmation for whatever it was he'd been thinking. "I know that energy was coming from you."
Harry frowned. Soren was normally not so formal with him, even after Harry had offended him, Soren had remained mostly casual with him. This sudden switch did not help to alleviate Harry's unease, rather it intensified the feeling. "Yeah," he nodded, eyeing the other elf suspiciously. "Sure."
The hint of fear in her normally collected voice was more then enough to snap him out of his frozen state. "What's going on? What are you doing?" Draco asked, pushing himself out of the bed. He had a sinking feeling that he already knew, but he needed to hear it from her. He didn't understand. This wasn't the role she was supposed to play.
There was only one bed being occupied in the room and the splash of blond against the white pillow told him exactly who it was. Draco was laying on his stomach, the wounds on his back covered with bandages. Harry released a breath when he spotted the movement of the Draco's back, corresponding with each breath he took. His relief wasn't what he had hoped it would be. Some of the bandages had tinges of red colouring where the blood had seeped through. Draco wasn't out of the woods just yet and he didn't need Rosalind to tell him as much. His wounds had been pretty bad and it wasn't at all surprising that he was still unconscious. A part of him had hoped otherwise, but that had clearly just been wishful thinking. If Draco woke any time soon, it would be a bloody miracle.
"Harry, you just can't-" Harry barely spared Gwynn a glance once she'd caught up, her breathing slightly erratic and her hair slipping from where she'd tied it back that morning. He had far more important things to worry about and he was sure her reprimands would be repeated later. Several different individuals would probably be repeating them, in fact.
After a moment of silence, Draco glanced at Harry. "What about that room you idiots used for your army?"
Dumbledore, it seemed, could also appreciate the importance of Soren's words as that unshakable persona he'd built up around himself cracked just a little as the twinkling in his eyes briefly flashed something much more sinister.
After spending hours locked up within the confines of the Malfoy dungeons, the fresh air washed over him with an almost cleansing sensation. After nothing but unyielding concrete and biting metal, the cool grass beneath his skin felt just like the soft silk his mother had always preferred.
"Bloody hell," Harry coughed, spitting water to clear his throat. The body in his arms was still and the longer it remained so the less of a chance Harry had of keeping Draco alive. Glancing around desperately, Harry spotted several overhanging branches above the surface of the river. Angling himself in the right direction, Harry shot a hand out towards them. Several slapped against him before his fingers final scrambled against a large branch, allowing him to grab a hold. With one arm still wrapped firmly around Draco's waist. Harry struggled to use his free arm to pull the two of the closer to the shore, moving them inch by agonizing inch.
"I'm thinking something light and fast," he commented, shooting Harry a wink before releasing his arm and moving back to his earlier casual position against the counter. He's small, but he's got a firm grip. "Maybe a Kodachi or Gladius type form. Easy to swing."
The group continued to move forward, silence stretching out to embrace them all. No one, not even Harry, was inclined to break it. It had been a long time since a meeting of this making had been arranged. The elves had taken the initiative to pull back from the human world and all those in the group understood the significance of making contact with them now. Had it not been for Harry's connection to them, this meeting wouldn't have taken place.
Harry didn't recall setting an alarm the night before. Despite that, it still went off bright and early at an obnoxiously loud decibel. Sitting up groggily, he reached for his wand to cancel the alarm. It felt weird having his wand in hand again. He hadn't touched it in weeks. His magic had changed and he no longer needed it, but if they were to keep a low profile then he was going to need it in order to maintain the image.
Ilaria nodded, the conversation continuing around him with an easy flow. "You'd see me more often if you'd just pack up and move to the south with me."
Despite the fact that his plate was full of food that he'd placed there himself, he had barely touched it. Instead, Hermione kept shooting him sympathetic looks every time he viciously stabbed a piece of food. Of course, he couldn't exactly tell them that the giant ice ferret was going to still play Quidditch despite the advantage while he, himself, had to suffer in the stands. They simply thought his discontent was due to not being allowed to play.
"All the pretty words in the world don't add up to much unless you live up to them," was Hendrik's response, earning a low hiss from further down the table. Lothair, Harry guessed. He didn't dare take his eyes off the Wolf across from him. The stare was as much of a challenge as the words were.
"Are you a virgin? "he asked again, his eyes lighting up with curiosity. "Maybe it's just a whole lot of sexual frustration building up."
Arriving at the Gryffindor table, Harry plopped down beside Hermione with a groan, leaning forward and letting his head fall to the table with a loud thud, causing Hermione to reach out and steady her glance of pumpkin juice.
"You can continue on to wherever the hell you like," Harry growled, his eyes moving from Pansy to Draco, "You and I are going to talk."
"Prettier than you," his voice was rough. Rougher than he expected it to be, which sparked some surprise as he pushed himself up onto his elbows.
Whatever Draco was going to say was interrupted by Lothair calling everyone back. He waited for Draco to haul himself off the bed before heading out and back down the hallway. "There are enough bedrooms for everyone down there," he commented, jerking his thumb toward the hallway where Draco was just emerging from. "Furniture included."
The moment he was free of Roland's grip the Scout's body slid to the floor, followed shortly by the torn vocal cords as Roland calmly deposited them. A dangerous clam had fallen over him as the blood from the recent killing dripped down his fingers. It had always been difficult to stop once he'd started. The clam was something he craved and, at the same time, something he loathed. He needed it to keep him sane, but he hated the dependency.
"Gladius. 30 inches. Steel alloy with obsidian influence. Not meant for brute strength, instead meant for those who are agile and quick. It also has a magical core." Again the excitement spilled out of Ilaria for all to see. The pointed look of expectation she shot Harry told him to pick up the sword. Like Draco, the moment he held the sword in his hand, everything else disappeared. The energy that flowed into him was warm and welcoming. He could smell the wind, fresh and crisp, the cool air wrapping around him. It was like being welcomed home and then it was gone, leaving Harry back in the training room, three pairs of eyes on him as he tried to regain his senses.
"It was calculated." Harry added, glancing down at his sword, "With Ilaria's element it would have been easy to let the magic linger over a long period of time, letting the fire slowly burn as it wanted to. You can't do that. Lightening is a sudden release of energy. The only way you could use it to your advantage was to release a large amount of power all at once and overpower the diluted stream of magic."
Immediately Soren's attention returned from his internal musings to focus once more on Harry. "It records the complete history of the royal family: your family. Now that you have been returned to your rightful place, the book will record your accomplishments."
"Tell me about him," she pushed, returning his stunned look with an amused chuckle. "After all, I get the feeling he's going to be around a while. Might be a good idea to know something about him." She was a little curious, she had to admit. Outside of Harry, himself, she'd never really known anyone from outside the realm. Most Elves didn't leave the boundaries. Those who did were members of the military or political figures such as the High Lords. Neither group included her.
"Don't be concerned about Voldemort," he responded, "Just enjoy being back." Seeing the look on Harry's face that stated he was about to protest, he continued. "There's been no new information since you left. He's had his own internal problems."
