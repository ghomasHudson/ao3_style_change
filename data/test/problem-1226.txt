“I love you,” Harry said quietly. “You’re lovely to be around, you’re funny and sharp, and brilliant in ways that make me wish we could have been friends from the beginning. I’m so lucky you’re here with me now.”
“Is he-?”
The hospital wing seemed immediately colder in the absence of Harry’s magic.
“Draco is Tethering him.” Hermione interrupted, moving to where Draco was sitting, staring transfixed at the streak of Harry’s magic within his own. “See? Pansy, you were right, can I see the memory? You said it called Harry-“
, as boorish as it is.”
Once he was level with Harry, Draco realized two things. The first was that he was not much of the big spoon sort. The second was that trying to move an unconscious person's arms around you was both extremely difficult and extremely unbecoming. He persevered despite his misgivings and ended up with his forehead pressed to Harry’s collarbone as a limp arm was slung across his back.
“Of course, Headmistress. Thank you.”
While defense still came most naturally to him, certain charm and transfiguration work seemed to flow more easily than they ever had before. Runes, potions, and herbology seemed to flourish under his hands. Hermione said it had to do with the practical application he had done during their year on the run, but Ron believed defeating Voldemort had “done him a bit of good” in terms of letting him focus. Harry privately thought they were both correct, however whenever the subject came up he just shrugged and said it was probably all the fruit McGonnall plied him with.
They stayed like that for several long moments, silently soaking up each other’s warmth. Harry sighed before speaking again.
Nothing.
Draco later thought he could be forgiven for his surprise when Harry mumbled, “wha’d’ya mean?” His heart froze, stomach churning painfully as Harry cracked open an eye- too shocked to remove his hand from its place in his hair.
As the feeling faded, Draco’s panic set in in its place.
He groaned and fought his way out of the circle of Harry’s arms. Sure enough there was a tray of food next to him, though the darkness of the room suggested it was well after dinner time. He took a few bites before turning to the silent, slightly smirking couple next to him.
Draco nodded at once. He would agree to anything so long as someone would tell him
Hermione let out a wet laugh as Draco gaped at Harry.
Hauling Draco onto his lap, Harry wrapped himself around the trembling boy. Draco was considerably taller than himself, but he seemed so small as little noises of distress escaped his tightly clamped lips. It was easy to hold him, to tuck Draco’s head under his chin, to fold his arms around all of Draco’s sharp edges.
Pansy rolled her eyes.
“He got his glasses fixed today. Did you know he couldn’t read the board? No wonder he’s looked so lost in potions, Severus never read instructions aloud.” Draco said, flushing again at the memory of Potter’s evaluative gaze.
The recount of his misdeeds ended with an “I imagine your right hook is probably even stronger now, but if you want a second shot at it…” He held his arms out in a vaguely open gesture and braced himself.
Weasley and Granger seemed to be having a silent conversation, raising their eyebrows and flickering glances between Harry and the door Pomfrey had just left from. Granger appeared to win whatever it was, and turned resolutely to maintain vigil over Harry.
“He can know,” Harry said quickly, watching as Draco tensed. Hermione nodded.
“Harry, mate, wanna come join us for a four on four?” His tone was casual but the way he studiously avoided looking at either Pansy or Draco immediately had the blond on edge.
He was also shifting uncomfortably at the silence his comment had been met with.
Draco thought.
“You know I do, you twat.” Draco muttered, feeling his ears burn at Harry’s delighted laugh.
The moment they had risen Draco seemed more himself. Within minutes he was calling taunts, demanding Harry show him how to do tricks, and generally being more alive than Harry had seen him in what felt like ages.
Draco closed his eyes as the door shut behind them. Madam Pomfrey, who had been more or less silent in observing the group of them, sighed.
“Potter, you don’t actually have to tell me-“ Draco stopped short as he realized that Harry seemed to
He was somewhat surprised that the door was not only unlocked, but unguarded. With the fervor that some of the younger students followed Potter, he had assumed that there would be some sort of barrier preventing anyone from getting too close. However he hit no such disruption in his approach to the curtain that hid Potter from view.
It didn’t really, but Draco could tell the more he learned, the more he felt he couldn’t breathe, so he nodded.
“Fuck.” He whispered. “Merlins sodding pants.”
In his panic, Harry didn’t realize that he had begun to call his magic to the surface. If Draco had been in any position to notice, he might’ve commented on how Harry’s skin seemed to glow, or how his eyes began to darken, bypassing gold and going straight to black.
Weasley also seemed to understand what the spell meant, and was looking down at Harry with unabashed wonder.
The sound was clear and bright, and Harry abruptly realized that if this was as close as he could ever be to Draco, it would be enough. It would be enough to see him laugh, carefree and exuberant. The knowledge filled his chest, and despite already being in the air, Harry felt he truly understood what it meant to be flying.
He couldn’t help but wonder.
All at once the tugging stopped. The golden thread flared bright, turning into an elegant chain that wrapped around Draco’s hands and ended at Harry’s heart. The light was warm, chasing away any lingering sense of cold that had crept into Draco’s skin.
“Are you going to tell me what happened in potions?” Was what came out of Draco’s mouth. He knew immediately that Harry saw the deflection for what it was and looked away, pulling his hand back.
Draco didn’t know what to do with the missive. It sounded nothing like Potter, but at the same time it was exactly like him. It made Draco’s stomach squirm in ways he didn’t understand. He had ultimately decided it was a need to respond, and thus began the confusing but delightful exchange they had kept.
Draco blinked at him. “Started with what? Isn’t it night?”
“And it was a visible field, correct? Can you give me an estimate of the size?”
With that in mind, she made her decision.
Draco pulling away when they had discussed it was one thing, but the two-dimensional shadow that had come back into the common room that day was another. More than once Pansy had tried to interrogate him, demanding answers, assuming he had done something to cause it, but Harry didn’t know what it could be.
Draco could tell when the memory got to the point when Harry’s spell had given out by the way Madam Pomfrey flinched. It was only seconds later that the pair of them pulled out, looking at each other and then at Draco with eyes unbearably soft.
“He’s stable, Mister Weasley. Mister Malfoy is still unable to be much separated from him, and it appears-“
He nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
his eyes didn’t get the gilt edge they did in potions, they were dark- black, honestly- and he started welling up. I thought it might’ve been blood, but it was all wrong- thick and…” he trailed off.
However, when the third class in a row had Draco needing to be nudged when called on, Harry decided it was worth the risk.
“I thought maybe my magic needed to settle back after I had died, or maybe the curse scar had something to do with it. I’ve always had a hard time controlling my magic when emotions are high: I once accidentally aparated to the top of a building as a kid, and I just kinda thought it was more of that? But, turns out, I have way more power than I should, my magical core is kinda hemorrhaging, and my body isn’t strong enough to handle it all. Probably because the Durs- my relatives didn’t feed me enough.”
, how could-?”
“I love him,” he said, voice muffled by Pansy’s arm.
“There’s no need,” came a terse reply. The four students jumped.
That was the thought that kept him going, lowering the net closer and closer to the ground as slow as he dared. His vision began growing black at the edges, and each breath felt harder than the last, but he would make this work.
“Your mom knows some of it, actually. So it can stay between her too. If you… if you need someone to talk to about it. Ron and Hermione have each other, but it’s still quite a lot.”
“Well, I can’t speak for Blaise, but I know Ron and Hermione are fine with it. Obviously, otherwise they would’ve never let you in the hospital wing. As for papers, you know I’ve never taken much stock in anything they print, plus if you don’t want them to know, we can hide.” Draco shook his head in the circle of Harry’s arms. “What, you think I can’t hide things from the prophet? Kingsley has been keeping them on a short leash for months-“
“I’m led to believe in muggle weddings that’s part of their vows, we went over it in muggle studies not too long ago,” was Pansy’s confused reply.
“Well, you know what Xenophilius said, about greeting as old friends? Well, that was when you were supposed to. And because you didn’t, Death was trying to get you back.”
“So pretty!”
“What do you mean Weasley and Granger wouldn’t have let me into the hospital wing? I saw them before I came here, dead asleep on the floor of the common room.”
“In the morning they’ll probably try to pull your memory for the pensive, they already did for Weas- Ron, and Hermione. It… no one blames you, darling. It wasn’t your fault that Potter couldn’t-“
Ron pipped up first. “Harry woke up!”
This was not that.
Harry smiled as he looked out the window, and Madam Pomfrey was hit with a sharp ache that often afflicted her as of late.
As like the previous times, this seemed to take the last bit of wind from Draco’s sails, and he slumped to the side, neatly tucking his head into the crook of Harry’s shoulder. They stood quiet for a moment, watching as the giant squid created lazy ripples across the surface of the great lake.
Her shoulders sagged and she shook her head once, sharply.
“Yes, Weasley?”
That was how Professor McGonagall found them- Harry grinning like a loon, Draco flushed a bright red, with an entirely too smug Hermione and Ron across from them.
“If I tell you, will you tell me what you meant by,” he gestured vaguely, “that?”
was the last thought Harry had before his heart gave out.
met with no reaction. No indication Harry could hear it at all.
“So you’re telling me the Chosen One didn’t know simple vision charms? So much for all our bets that Granger all but wipes his ass, she’d never let him forget-“
“What was that?” He asked, stupid Cheshire grin stretched across his face.
“What are you two doing here,” he muttered, trying not to sound like he wished to disappear.
“Harry Potter you are, without a doubt, the thickest, most obtuse hero on this planet. I’m in love with you, you absolute tosser!”
A trade. Turning this into a transaction appealed to Draco, however he couldn’t be sure that Harry’s secret was as revealing as his own. It was enough to get him to turn and meet grey eyes to green, however.
“Hermione has been researching what’s been up with him since summer,” Weasley said, as if completely oblivious to Draco’s embarrassment. “Harry didn’t want to talk about it, so it’s not been going well, what with not enough information n’stuff, but something about the proximity factor made her remember reading something a while back. She thought it was in one of the books at Grimmauld, so it wasn’t super helpful, but enough to get her into research mode ‘nstead of panic.”
Hermione stopped short on seeing the display, eyes narrowed in on where the two tones met. Pansy and Ron seemed more distracted by their respective best friends.
Pansy tried to hide a laugh behind a cough while Weasley rolled his eyes.
would rip him away again.
It was warm. It felt like laughter, and heartbeats, and the fluttering of a snitch. It felt like life.
They continued in silence once again, reaching the dungeons before Weasley put out a hand and clapped Malfoy on the shoulder.
“We shall not part until we have both experienced life, he will join me on this side of the tie, he will
She nodded sharply and rose. “I expect you to have finished that by the time I get back,” was all she said before leaving as quickly as she had arrived.
“Miss Granger hasn’t come in, no,” Pomfrey answered, looking puzzled.
It had been
Minerva shook her head.
Draco did as he was told, and held still while Madam Pomfrey extracted the memory from the previous day. Draco made sure the scene started from when he had seen the snitch and not a minute earlier, lest they notice the way his eyes continued to stray from Harry’s face to his other assets.
“That’s why you were blushing? A sweet nothing from the Boy Who Lived! Oh this is fabulous, please tell me you happened to be the first thing he saw once he could see,” her gleeful crow was drawing the attention of nearby students, and Draco wanted nothing more than to glare at them.
“Who do you take me for, Weasel? No one would listen to a damn thing I have to say about Potter, anyway.”
Draco started in Pansy’s grasp, worming his way out so he could look at Granger.
Weasley seemed pleased to leave it at that, and rose from the table.
If Draco was being honest, he hadn’t expected a reply. He had been ungracious in the immediate aftermath of the battle when Potter returned his wand to him. Tension was high, and it had only taken “I guess I don’t need this anymore,” to fall from Potter’s lips before Draco swung at him. The Wizengamont calling his name as someone testifying on his behalf was already too much, a reply to an obviously coerced olive branch was unthinkable.
that happened while the rest of us were attending school like normal kids.” Pansy’s voice sounded far away, as if she too had just realized how often the trio had found their lives recklessly endangered.
“Alright, mate?” Ron asked, delight etched into every bit of his face.
“Oi, I wrote that one!” Said Ron, puffing his chest out. “See look, even Draco thinks I know what romance is.”
Pansy tugged his hand into hers, breaking all facade of calm as she whispered “Oh don’t you understand? I thought maybe, earlier, when you said what he... when he could
“I remembered that as Harry was, as we were- “ Draco shook his head, “during
As they made their way down the corridor, Draco realized what a sight their ensemble made. The matron’s brisk walk made her robes flutter around her in a manner that was painfully reminiscent of Severus. Granger was keeping stride, her voice low but intent as she relayed what Pansy had told her, as well as her own observations. Keeping up the rear was Draco, cradling a magically-lightened Harry to his chest, pretending that Weasley’s glances down at the two of them were just concern for the black haired boy.
“And that’s what the rope thing was?”
“I’ll do it.” Draco needed to say it before McGonagall’s rant could scare him out of it. He hadn’t lied when he had told Harry he was a coward- he’d do anything to avoid pain. Including going into something unaware of what it might entail.
“No- it turns out that Draco is your Tether to life. He was, is, your connection to this side of the veil, and basically pulled you across. Any time you got slightly separated the connection would fade and your heart would- well. It’s been the two of you here since you collapsed on the quidditch pitch.”
He slowly sat up, careful to not prop himself up on any part of the boy next to him. Harry’s color had somewhat returned, and Draco could see small movement to indicate he was breathing. It felt like all of the fuzz that had been keeping his brain quiet dissolved at the sight, and Draco was helpless against the rush of emotion that filled in its place.
Harry’s arms around him were starting to loosen their hold, and Draco didn’t know how to explain that that made everything so much worse. He gripped onto Harry’s elbow, stopping the movement. In some wonderful, terrible, display of how much Harry understood him, he pulled Draco closer again.
They sat, Draco looking away and Harry looking at him, for a solid minute. Harry counted every second.
Pansy immediately picked her story up again, and neither of them gave Finnegan a cursory glance as he walked away.
“And when you become an auror? How will you deal with all your co-workers thinking your boyfriend is a death eater who got off with too light a sentence?”
“Can we be friends? If I agree, can you promise not to do something stupid and Gryffindor to change my mind?”
“Really?” He asked. “What time is it anyway?”
“I don’t know, one moment I was in a free fall and the next… it was like the air itself became thick. He… he was crying, but…” Draco shook his head, trying to clear the fog. “Something was happening, I.. can’t remember…”
The thread was glowing brighter, thicker somehow. It was stretching towards Harry, making his skin appear to take a gold cast.
“That’s a no,” said Pansy with a sigh. “Darling, what's the last thing you do remember?”
“Oh don’t pretend you don’t care about him too!” Draco cried, frustration bubbling out of him. “You two have become such good friends that I’ve had to ask
, come on, look at me, can you hear me? Please, please look at me,” Draco begged, reaching out to grab his hand. It was colder than he expected it to be, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from recoiling.
He hadn’t really been expecting her to take a swing, but when the silence had stretched on well past what he could deem appropriate he cracked an eye open and was shocked to see Granger with tears streaming down her face.
With a deep breath he began.
Harry rubbed circles on Draco’s back as he continued to shake. He wasn’t sure where to begin when this fear ran so deep. Draco said every word as if it were fact: if the idea of the sky being blue could be so upsetting, Harry was sure it would feel like the exact same discussion.
Pansy and Draco gaped at the ginger. He looked between them, confused, before slow understanding spread across his face.
Pansy and Draco stared at each other, equally bewildered.
“If anything you could say you won it after embarrassingly confessing your feelings, which I graciously and calmly turned down,” Draco sniffed, not bothering to hide the smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
Harry’s upticked eyebrow was the only indication Draco might need to rethink his question. The rising embarrassment as he realized what assumption he had just made wasn’t enough to get him to break eye contact with Harry’s gaze, but it was a close thing.
There wasn’t anything Draco could say to that. If it had come from someone else, he would’ve felt it as a bid at manipulation, but from Harry it just sounded honest. Painfully, heart-wrenchingly honest.
He wouldn’t let go so easily, though.
“Astute observation, Ronald. I’ll be sure to tell Death that it’s not as scary as a bigoted madman holding my mother hostage.” Draco’s voice was like ice.
Harry laughed and lightly butted his head against Draco’s shoulder. The comment niggled something in his memory.
exactly the two women seemed to understand about the light when Pansy whipped her head out of the pensive, face ashen.
, ferret,” Harry continued, ignoring Draco’s scoff, “you’re the best part of this school year. Thank you for being here.”
“Erm, well, I think I said it,” he said, laughing. “Just that, well cause I didn’t know before then, I couldn’t see super great, everything was blurry and, you’re so…” he coughed, “last time I remember seeing what you looked like clearly was a while ago. You don’t. Look like that. Anymore.”
Pomfrey and McGonagall both looked as if they wanted to press, but before they could, Pansy stepped forward.
So, as their sides were pressed together in the astronomy tower, Draco's mind was spinning. It did not matter that they were going back to Hogwarts. Potter was trouble, would only endanger everyone Draco cared about as well as Draco himself, and Draco's sirenhood would put an even larger target on both of their heads. There was also the hiccup of Draco being technically dead to the wizarding world, including Potter, and that the golden boy would never consider stooping so low as to think a siren anything other than a monster. A threat.
The harsh sound forced Harry to turn back to him, not expecting the bared fangs and coal-black eyes mere inches from his face. All the knowledge he knew about Nightingale sirens suddenly evaporated from his memory. Draco's hand was still tangled in his hair, the grip tightening as he sized up Harry's friends.
"C'mon, we'll be late to class if we don't leave now." Hermione's voice broke him from his stupor.
Wake up. Eat. School. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.
"What you're asking of us is suicide! Endanger my life, certainly, but you cannot ask me to endanger anyone else!"
Severus sighed, turning to gaze out the windows of his office. Things could never be so easy. "And Dumbledore wants to take a passive approach? You're certain?"
Snape and Andrew seemed to be having a whisper-argument, but without much heat behind it. Harry approached Draco's head, brushing some stray blond hairs away from his face. The remaining tension seeped from Draco, eyes finally falling shut and staying that way. Harry sat down on the bed, continuing to run his fingers through the soft locks.
Cassie had stayed with him throughout the night, being utterly useless as she did. Well, that wasn't entirely true. Every so often she'd take a cup of water to pour over the gills, washing away the blood before it could dry and keeping the gills generally wet.
The balance was to be disrupted. Something dark--pure in its evil--would arrive in devastation upon them all. But, as nature does, the scale would find a way to right itself once more.
Umbridge was filled with unsolicited opinions, it seemed. It'd make an interesting year, that's for certain.
A growl rose from deep in his chest as primal anger consumed him. They can try to starve and weaken him all they like, he'd die kicking and screaming before they'd control him.
Draco's next words left Harry reeling. "I'm going."
This information was only relevant, however, because Draco had snuck Potter into the sirens' common room and had led him to the spiral staircase that went up to the dorms. They would have gone perfectly unseen, if not for Cassie pinning Andrew to the wall and blocking the way up.
"Potter, pay attention!" The Potions professor slammed a book down onto his desk, forcing him to startle from where he had begun to doze off.
Harry Potter.
Snape's face looked pinched, likely hoping Draco wouldn't be so perceptive immediately after getting mated to avoid going completely feral.
"Draco, hi!" Potter sounded breathless. He likely sprinted his way over here.
While Draco recalled his vision of Cassie and his father, said Head of House calmly crossed the room to hook his arm in her elbow. As Draco got towards the end of it, he was forcibly escorted into the stairwell.
Dumbledore leaned forward in his seat, directing his words to Snape. "You should have involved me in these conversations earlier, before they progressed to this point."
Draco finished the sentence for her. "And not find myself in any precarious danger. Mother, Cassie is more than capable of keeping me safe, there is no reason to fret. I promise, I'll be safe."
He opted to slide in versus diving straight in, still not 100% comfortable in the water. As he got in, he let his glamours drop, letting the cool water rush through his gills as his dorsal fin flexed, having been a few days since he last stretched them out. Compared to Cassiopeia, he felt like a baby bird, awkward and ugly-looking as its feathers grew in.
"You saved me," Harry word-vomited.
about it."
Cassie turned in her chin up with indifference. "We have to think of the survival of our kind. We have a greater responsibility than ourselves."
He nodded. "Right. Harry. This went over more smoothly in my head..."
had stopped pure-bloods in the past, either.
"But Zabini's a bloke."
"She wanted you to stay behind for a reason," Snape stated, and Andrew spun on his heel.
Draco was now slightly more awake. Key word being: slightly. He blinked a few times to clear the fogginess from his vision, unveiling the sight of two stunned Triwizard judges.
For her sake, he wished he could take her there once the war was over with. The cold would weaken him, could even kill him, and she'd never entertain the idea no matter the circumstances.
"A vitality potion?" His own voice sounded small. Weak.
Draco blinked. "Uh, thank you, Corey."
switching up the timeline just a bit, but Harry's still as clueless as ever, so what's really changed?
He sat up. Draco tried to turn and run, but Andrew grabbed the hood of his robes and yanked him back. Flinging an arm around Draco's shoulders, he practically dragged the Slytherin over to Harry. They both stopped at his feet.
Cassie shifted in her sleep, and he turned in his seat as she huffed and flexed her shoulders before returning to her state of rest. She had decided to 'lay down for a bit' a little past noon, and had been asleep for five hours since. If there was one thing he did not envy of Nightingales, it was the battle they faced against their nocturnal sleeping habits. Every week he was forced to watch her struggle to get through the day, before eventually getting so exhausted her body would shut itself down under the guise of a 'quick nap.'
Andrew, face dripping with blood from deep scratches on his forehead, flashed a grateful smile at Harry. Draco let a out a noise not dissimilar to a roar, fangs snapping mere inches from Harry's face.
He got up as Corey handed off the crate and turned to leave, putting himself in his path. Corey tilted his head with a smirk, the question in his eyes.
have a choice. And, you're not a beast, or a monster. You won't hurt me."
They hadn't had a reason to fear them. Should they?
And, ugh, what a stupid question.
It was all rather boring, to be honest, in comparison to the First Task. At least then there was guaranteed action, not just some teenagers swimming around a lake going after Merlin-knows-what. It might have been explained above-water by the judges, mind you, but Draco had not been one to pay attention.
The far wall had an entrance to a spiral staircase. Corey was standing next to it and looking at Draco in a way that made him suspect he had been waiting for him to catch his eye. He strolled over, letting Corey hook an arm in his before ascending.
Cass raised her chin even higher. "I'm not 'your dear' anything. Nothing will ever change that. Is this all you wished to share with us?"
Too bad you can't Imperio a siren.
Draco stepped over her body with a huff, ready to regroup and move on. Where the hell were the others? Cassie was just ahead of him, using her Song to force information out of a Snatcher, had been doing so for the last three and a half minutes. The others should have been here a minute and forty seconds ago.
He'd felt this way since his mating ceremony to Harry. He'd reassured the dim Gryffindor repeatedly that this wasn't his fault, but Harry was stubborn as a mule when it came to convincing him otherwise. It likely didn't help that Severus hadn't refuted the idea when Harry had proposed it to him.
"Hermione," he began to ask, his tongue moving before his brain could think, "did you know?"
Cass was humming, stopping Krum from advancing forward, but failing to release him from the curse's hold. Still lost in thought, Draco began to hum with her, matching her tone to strengthen the Song enough to snap Krum out of it.
Lupin figured it explained a lot about Snape's change in loyalties during the first war.
"That wasn't the point of this conversation," he said rather harshly, "I don't want to talk about that."
As the familiar squeeze of traveling by portkey surrounded him, as Cassie threw herself at Draco, all he could think was that they were too late.
"I'll kill him," Narcissa muttered to herself as she plotted how to kill the elder in the most achingly slow, excruciatingly painful way possible.
While nudity wasn't anything to be ashamed of--he'd learned as much over the summer--he felt self-conscious. About both his human body and his siren one. What if he was... disappointing? What if he didn't look right? Was there a right way to look?
"I would love to."
He should have anticipated getting tackled onto his back, his whole body submerging in the shallow water for a moment before his head was yanked back out of the water and an acute sting was administered to his own shoulder. The water accelerated the stitching of their skin as he both felt and watched the wounds heal themselves, and the second it had healed he felt their bond snap into place.
They came to a small pond. There was no hesitation, he threw himself at the water, Potter getting caught in the momentum right behind him. He let the water embrace him, letting the pain and blood wash away with the day's troubles. The cloaking spell wore off as pure exhaustion took over.
"I was doing just fine," she replied, "until you pulled at my magic again. I blame you for this mess."
He hated that she knew exactly who he was talking about with very few hints. "He did not drool!" Draco protested.
"Draco?" Potter's voice trembled, like a tree creaking under the weight of a gale wind. Draco's mind was unfocused, where they back in the labyrinth? They were both bone dry and standing on solid ground. Where had the water gone? How did She do that?
McGonagall hummed wearily. "Yes, well... Goodnight, Mr. Potter."
"No. No." Was his face getting even redder? He might have to give the tomatoes a run for their money. "Him and Cassie..."
Cassie nudged him with her shoulder. "You really think they're going to risk upsetting the prophesied saviors? Do you actually believe any of them are suicidal enough to risk crossing me?"
"Cass!" he cried, bringing a hand to his forehead and finding something wet. Pulling his hand back--despite the doubled vision--the blood it was now soaked in was unmistakable.
"Potter, this obsession you have with me is quite unhealthy. Have you considered going to a Mind Healer and getting your head checked?"
Good riddance.
Draco didn't fare much better in that aspect. It was a wonder to him that they could sleep like rocks when the sun was up, but burst to the brim with energy once the sky was black.
He reached out to support her hand holding the vial with one of his, using the other to uncork it. He pressed it towards her, silently pleading with her to get it over with. This was not a battle they could win. No one would believe them. Not an accusation like this, not against the most respected Oracle of the Islands. Perhaps the old kook was right in a sense. Maybe She wouldn't let this harm them more than She had to.
"Yes, mate, it's okay." Ron resumed scanning, but once he found what he was looking for, he grabbed at the front of Harry's robes so tightly that he barely saved himself from toppling out of his chair.
It was his turn to raise his hand, but he didn't exactly have a question, just general confusion.
The Headmaster seemed... shocked? Sad?
and then imma sprinkle in a bit of angst, you know, for some *backstory*
As Cassie walked with him to DADA, Draco tugged at the shoulder of his robes, irritated at the fabric brushing against his sore skin. The spines of his dorsal fin had finished establishing themselves and breached his skin, but as they grew... It was itchy and tender and the fabric brushing against them with even the slightest of movements was driving him insane. He wouldn't be surprised if he suddenly began hexing students left and right for simply glancing in his direction.
She looked to Severus, some unreadable expression on her face that only the professor understood. "Will the Ministry be aware of our involvement in the Task? The champions? Does Dumbledore expect him to stick his neck out for an IOU?"
"Now, now." Ludo rushed to make reparations. "Let's not blow this out of proportion, no one is being forced to participate in anything. Mr. Malfoy's health is of the upmost priorities here, but I must add that I do not believe he will be in any immediate danger-"
In a move that not even Draco could predict, McGonagall's wand sliced through the air, the point of it stopping mere centimetres from Moody's good eye. Draco felt a shiver run through him at the sight, and even Cassie had tensed a bit beside him at the sudden movement.
The Snatcher's death was much quieter and took less than a second. It would have been silent if his hearing hadn't tuned in to the soft allure of Cassie's Song, followed by the thud of rumpled clothes hitting the ground as their owner folded in on himself.
Steady arms embraced his trembling form. He felt like he wasn't the one in this room who deserved it most, but without it he'd surely collapse to his knees.
Ron's eyes grew as his ears turned tomato red. "Hey, some of them chose to be called magical
them. Draco reminded himself of this fact as the ugly toad berated him for getting up to use the loo without asking her for permission first.
Ron threw his head back in defeat. Hermione laughed at his expense.
"So, not that much different, if you
Did no one else find that strange?
Ron groaned. "Am I going to have to suffer and watch these two smile at each other like idiots, now?"
The arm around him squeezed before he was released entirely from its hold. "Alright, then. Let's go for a stroll, shall we?"
Cassie must've moved him. The cold pool of water lifted some of the fog, the searing pain dulled down to a strong ache. He feel into a fitful sleep, but it was hard for him to tell whether he was sporadically waking up or simply having fever dreams. He could've sworn he could hear Severus talking at one point. He also heard his mother's, too, which convinced him it was a dream. Someone kept screaming. They must be drowning, for the noise was mixed in with harsh gurgles of water. He wished to help them.
Severus seemed equally displeased. "He said that, should this be a regular excuse from class, that he wishes to have a meeting with us and Professor Dumbledore."
Harry really wished he was better at following these types of conversations. He wished Hermione were here to connect the dots for him.
"Because," Snape was quick to answer, "if aggrieved followers of the Dark Lord were to discover I had a daughter..."
"The Black line doesn't have a history of siren blood, from my recollection," Tonks added. Both her and Sirius looked pointedly at Snape to provide answers.
It still wasn't that late, and Peeves did not appear to stall them as they made their way back. However, a much unlikelier foe decided to make an appearance.
His friend's face was beginning to turn the color of his hair. "No, lately both you and Hermione have been ditching me to hang out with the sirens, and that's fine. But I'm your friend, too, and you can't just keep putting me on the backburner! Up until last year, you and Draco hated each other. For all we know, he could ditch you for You-Know-Who and go back to being your mortal enemy! Now, you promised me you'd do this for me, so you have to choose. Me or him."
"How does this relate to your moping, exactly? Did he hurt your feelings? Oh, Draco, please tell me you didn't ask him to the Ball-"
Draco had rolled to face away from Cassie, so he was notified of someone entering the room via the creak of an oak door from behind him. The strides were purposeful, heavier than Corey's, which narrowed it down to Sev.
It was too late for him to stop falling for Harry Potter. All he could do was stay afloat.
One of the young men pushed off the wall he was leaning on, sauntering up to the trio. Andrew had straightened his posture, and Cassie had shoved her way in front of Draco, her height obscuring the men from his view.
As they entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, Draco could feel the effects of the rumors amongst his own house. Pitying glances across the board, although quickly masked. It said enough that they let him read their expressions even for the briefest of seconds. Bloody hell, they probably thought he was terminally ill.
"Care to leave?" he asked, not caring for any of this any longer. It likely would be more exciting without the deathly fear of fire he'd inherited recently. He could really go for a dip in the private pool in his quarters. Surely Cass had a similar idea in mind.
Andrew was gone before Draco could even process the words that left his mouth.
He smiled at the sight of them. Not fazed in the slightest, to Harry's utter confusion. He wasn't sure he would ever truly understand that man.
Draco would like it there. Of that he was certain. He didn't do well in settings like Hogwarts, at least not since Andrew had come and observed him in this environment. The boy didn't have a confrontational bone in his body, not in the sense that Cassie did. He thrived behind the scenes, using his words to tilt the scales in his favor, using his alliances to his benefit. Andrew found a kindred spirit in him in that sense.
"Professor, I can explain-" He started, but McGonagall simply shook her head.
The first words he spoke were the furthest thing from what Harry had anticipated. "Where are Andrew and Corey?"
"I'm assuming then that in siren-siren pairs they create their bond marks simultaneously?"
The three sirens kept low, swimming a few feet above the sandy lake bottom. Draco was already feeling like he had a handle on swimming with a tail, like it was something he'd known how to do even before he could walk.
"Louisi-? You know what, later. You're both crowding me."
"Maybe don't think about it then, wouldn't want you over-exerting yourself."
, Cassie would never forgive him.
"Should we tell Severus? Do you think Dumbledore knows? Do you think Mad-Eye talked to him? Do you think Dumbledore told Mad-Eye to look into us?"
If Severus hadn't helped charm his robes, he'd be paranoid of the blood completely seeping through to the outer layer for everyone to see. Then he really would have the unbearable curiosity of all four houses breathing down his neck, if not that of the two visiting schools, AND Madam Pomfrey. It was all a bloody mess.
He crossed the small space to kneel down next to her, sitting on his heels as he brushed stray hairs from her face. He breathed out a laugh at the physical proof she was here.
Footsteps stomped around the corner. Draco didn't pull away, simply turned to rest his head on Harry's shoulder to see who it was.
Lunch was a much desired break. Draco didn't even care at the fuss he was sure to cause. He was desperate to stretch out his legs--as he hadn't yet a chance to stretch out his tail--and felt a newfound confidence at the attention he would bring. This year he didn't have to hide what he was. It didn't matter what the others thought or said about him, because this time Draco was different.
He shook those thoughts from his head. They were a waste of space. He couldn't be hung up on someone who was not a viable option. He needed a distraction, to move on to someone else. A siren, someone he didn't have to hide from, someone whose scales one day he'd carry on his shoulder.
He was scanning over said review guides when the door swung open, Cassie waltzing in.
He should have known better.
Andrew was not as passive an observer as many believed him to be. Underestimating him was their first mistake, of course. The rest was all dominoes.
It was all incredible, really, even if Draco had already learned everything about the theories behind the magic and their properties. Any normal Wizard would be out of their element in open water already, but Sirens had multiple advantages. There was no possible way for them to be his equal here. And, that did not even begin to cover what would happen if She came in to intervene.
Pansy's eyes widened a tad at the informal introduction, a clear indicator that Cass was not of a Noble and Most Ancient House. If only she knew the full story.
Well, it was now or never. "Are you going with anyone to the Yule Ball?"
Their daughter had been born in Sirenum scopuli for her own safety. Cassandra had refused to name her without Severus present, and had come alone to Spinner's End with plans to take him to a safehouse in the States where the three of them would be safe. They were supposed to meet in an alley a few blocks down at sunrise.
He watched them in the Great Hall, how Slytherins of all years would walk up to talk to him, giving him books and sweets and whatnot. If he wasn't there, then Cassie was, and he didn't like her very much either.
. "Draco, care to explain the torn up grindylow we found and then proceeded to bury? If you were hungry, at least clean up after yourself."
Cassie took a seat next to him towards the back of the room. He didn't even question why she was here, he had looked at her timetable the other day and it was complete nonsense. He was fairly confident that she was far too advanced for any of the typical fifth-year courses, and the fact she shared a fair number of his classes made it quite obvious Severus had fabricated her academic record.
He felt Draco's eyelashes flutter as they opened after a period of being closed. It tickled even more than the tiny exhales that sent the hairs on the back of his neck straight up.
"I can think of a few reasons why Ilvermorny refuses to participate in this hodpodge. Are there no statutes in place to prioritize students' safety? A challenge like this would be much better for students that have already graduated, or at least have made it close enough to graduating. Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea? Wouldn't it be more constructive to have, like, a big Quidditch tournament?"
Cassie grinned, tapping his shin with her foot. "Yeah, and don't you forget it."
The older siren shrugged, going back to his notes. If he had a galleon for every time he fully understood what Cassie was up to, he'd have a negative number.
Someone from a middle table cleared their throat. It was Eliot, a Sounding Tomb around Andrew's age, a siren that had been Head Boy at St. Achelous'. If they were sorted, he'd be a Gryffindor, no doubt.
The room fell silent as Dumbledore entered, walking with purpose to the front of the Hall. The look on his face was eerie, one Harry had rarely seen present on the Headmaster. As the man took to the podium, everyone was on the edge of their seats to hear what had to be said.
Draco was blown away at the transformation the field had undergone. The hedge walls of the labyrinth towered over him, the air sparking with capricious magic. Severus and Dumbledore were already there, and walked in their direction from where they had been having a huddled conversation.
Now Ron looked concerned. "Mate, that's not what Snape said. He just said that there's more than one way to die, and that lots of sirens are in hiding right now. Including his daughter, I'm sure he could care less about your weird obsession with his dead godson."
Cassie smashed a vial into the back of his head. The dizzying twists and turns of the portkey amplified as he was struck, turning to her with a dazed look. He could feel shards embedded in the back of his skull--when had his hood fallen down?--and the warm trickle of blood mixing with another, cooler liquid.
finish that sentence. Severus turned to the side of the Light, and his daughter is one of the most brilliant witches I have ever come to teach. Clearly, you have not paid enough attention to her in your lectures, or you would know her magic is as pure as it can be. There is
Cassie rolled her eyes like this was old news. "Again, not that impressive, any siren could've done it. Dumbledore now thinks of me as an exchange student that he does not care about what I get up to, and Moody believes I'm much too advanced for anything his class has to offer, and understands how important it is for me to support my cousin this year. Piece. Of. Cake."
"Snape, please," he whined, pressing his hands over his ears and clenching his eyes shut as the room came to be too much.
"Oh, goody. The solution to the big Bad Problem is to just kill them! How convenient!"
She asked no questions. The answers must have been clear as day in his eyes. By the time she was through analyzing him, Draco was trembling like a leaf.
"Oh, fuck off," Cass and Draco said in unison.
Draco blinked, piercing gray eyes staring straight into his soul. The bond thrummed with a warm energy--content, safe--as his boyfriend regained his sense of composure to take in his surroundings.
Leaving the bathroom, Draco did a double take. There were two beds.
"Do you want us to cover our eyes?" Cass suggested, and he groaned.
Right. Well.
How did Draco know this? His stupid bond was doing things it shouldn't be able to, like giving him a front row seat to Harry's surroundings at random moments of the day. It wasn't something he could trigger or turn off or control in any manner, and it was driving him insane. Plunging into his mate's brain randomly throughout the day was nonsensical, and Harry couldn't even perceive it was happening. The thick Gryffindor was only aware because Draco had informed him, which was as helpful as teaching a Grindylow to crochet.
Everything was going to plan. He'd prevented Cassie and Draco from drinking the reflecting pool water, tricked Achelous into thinking they had, and everyone was now in the same place for the rest of it to come together. Severus had even been helping him with his potions, and they were on the brink of a monumental discovery. If they could make a potion that made its drinker invulnerable to a Siren Song, it'd be a game changer.
class. Like he wasn't already the gossip of his house enough.
"This is one of the worst ideas that has ever been concocted in all of history, magical or not," Draco said. None of the Oracles or Elder Nightingales present replied to the statement, but Draco knew he was right. He was rarely wrong when it came to matters like this.
She was trying to be supportive, though. That was what truly mattered. He wished greatly that things could've been different for her, that she could've had the sense of love and community that came with being who she was, unashamed.
"C'm'here." Corey unzipped his sleeping bag, holding it open.
Umbridge's mouth opened and closed a few times in a very fish-like choreography. She lowered her wand a few inches, before raising it with renewed vigor. No one had time to react before she struck.
Draco pulled his knees even tighter against his chest. He shouldn't have asked, even though it would've all come out eventually.
A younger Oracle that glanced nervously around the circle raised a hand before interjecting, "Actually, we are positively certain this time. Cassiopeia's natural talent for Divination and Draco's aptitude with aquatic alchemy signifies how each are blessed by Her. They've been given the two most powerful tools a siren can possess, and they were born exactly twelve moons apart. We overlooked them the first time around because we were unaware that Narcissa Black was a siren, we had no way of knowing her son was also a siren by relation. They're the only two that are twelve moons apart in the timeline of the prophecy, and both are children of a pair of fraternal twins!"
Andrew entered his blurred field of vision, hands up in surrender as he inched closer to Draco. "Dray, you need to breathe. Breathe for me, come back to me. You're safe. Take your time, just breathe nice and slow for me."
Instead, there was just a collective fear of the older siren. Wordlessly shared between students. And how boring was that?
"Potter, do I make myself clear? If Malfoy tries to rope you into some scheme, I trust you to convince him that the adults are handling the situation. As children, I do not want to hear anything of you running headfirst into this war. I'll hex you myself if you dare set foot outside of schoolgrounds. Do you understand?"
Snape cut in, enunciating each word with care. "And, why, pray tell, was he trying to hex her in the first place?"
"He's immune to our Song now, how will that ensure our survival!? We now have NOTHING to fight against him! You said we shouldn't join his side! WHAT WAS THE POINT IF THIS WAS YOUR PLAN ALL ALONG? WHY PUT US THROUGH ALL OF THAT JUST TO THROW IT ALL AWAY?"
"He died weeks before we knew that Voldemort was back," Hermione clarified for him, like he wasn't already considering that tidbit of information.
He reached the door. It was a solid oak reinforced with strong barrier spells that he didn't have the energy to waste breaking them down. That's why he was so hungry. They couldn't contain him otherwise.
"She grew up in America, and attended Ilvermorny as a result. Although, last year she decided to transfer here, and you will quickly realize she's the most headstrong Slytherin in the house's history. Merlin knows I hold little authority over her."
Each crashing wave sent a cooling spray of ocean mist onto them. The sun was obscured by overcast clouds yet the temperature was pleasant, a mild warmth that made the mist neutralize the setting into a temperate calm.
would love to hear about how despite your claims of attempting to avoid deaths you're fine with risking the lives of non-Champions! This is clear disregard for students who are not able-bodied, at Ilvermorny this would be
He ate the oatmeal mechanically, getting it over with so he could take the Draught and go back to sleep. Maybe Severus would take pity on him and let him sleep through the rest of the school year. It wasn't like it mattered, with the way things were going. His mother would be shipping him off to the islands at the earliest possible convenience, at this rate.
Draco's unconscious supplied him. He had no recollection of how he had gotten here.
that is.
Snape ducked his head as Dumbledore spoke, the poor bastard likely blaming himself for revealing that tidbit of information. Potter, on the other hand, stared at Snape as though he was discovering one of the secrets of life.
"Do you think Harry is good for me?"
His cousin barked out a laugh that left his heart aching. They shouldn't be here. They couldn't be here. He hadn't told Harry yet.
"Yeah, and it sounds like the merpeople are
The best part was the sea. They all spent a good amount of time down on the beach behind the cabin, the waves crashing against rock lulling them into a peaceful state. It was there that Draco began to learn more about his ancestors’ culture.
This wasn't happening, he was hallucinating, this couldn't be happening. This was probably the delusions from drinking the reflecting pool water or whatever, because this had to be some gnarly side-effect. It couldn't be true.
Cassie was glancing between the two like they were both pieces of kelp that had decided to become sentient enough to put on a musical number. Perhaps a musical number put on by some kelp would be easier to understand fundamentally.
Dumbledore had that twinkle in his eye again. Was this situation
Madam Pince announced the library was closing, and everyone began to pack their bags and return to the dormitories. As they all grew closer to the Slytherin dormitory entrance, Draco lightly grabbed at Blaise's wrist.
"You were in bed and not out in the corridors, and that's frankly all I care about at the moment. What I want is for you to promise me to let Severus and the Order handle this, and for you to not go rushing unprepared into certain death."
“You owe me ten galleons,” Hermione said, and Harry turned his shining expression to her.
, not even that long ago!  Harry I can’t lose you, not like that, not when I’ve just found you, especially not if-” a sob escaped, but Harry heard loud and clear what the end of the thought was.
“Harry Potter you wake up this instant!” He heard her yell, unable to make sense of the way she leaned a hand to Harry’s throat. “You do not get to die on us now, oh Merlin what have you done,” she continued frantically.
“He was crying!” He yelled, pointing at her hand. “It was dark, not like blood, but metallic instead- look at your fingers.”
“Well… this is where it’s a little fuzzy, in the historical record.” Hermione began, opening another tome. “See, the story of the other Tether became something of a legend, and there’s reference to how they brought their nearly-departed back from the clutches of death. It’s a ritual, and I believe I’ve managed to narrow down the consistencies into something close to what might’ve actually happened across a few different retellings, but without a proper account-“
“But Pomfrey? And McGonagall, they’re supposed to be here?” If Draco hadn’t just woken up, he might’ve remembered to put more incredulousness behind the questions, but at the moment he was bleary, embarrassed, and confused.
Draco whipped his head up in indignation.
Poppy shook her head and drew herself up with a breath.
He couldn’t imagine that Pomfrey would have let him crawl into bed with Harry.
“So long as you’re prepared for a dreadful display,” he whispered to her, attempting levity. Her quicksilver smile was all the acknowledgment he got before she too emerged herself into the pensive.
Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected when he agreed to come back for this year at Hogwarts, but the small hope at being “Just Harry” had evaporated immediately upon arrival. First and second years flung themselves out of his way when he walked the corridor, pressing tight to the walls as if he needed eight feet on either side of him to make it comfortably through. A group of fourth years followed him everywhere, never put off by the fifth and sixth years who tried to act as his personal body guards by shadowing his every move. They never seemed to realize the irony.
Draco nodded, miserably aware that his going forward with this meant he too was part of the problem.
goddamnit!”
“Now, I suggest that those who can leave the hospital wing do so. I believe we’ve all spent enough time here lately. Goodnight.” McGonagall turned, patting Harry’s hand once before leaving.
“Darling, do you mind if I look?” Pansy asked, touching the back of his hand to steady the shaking he didn’t realize he had started.
Harry looked at him, and then to Hermione, somehow expressing both deep exasperation and genuine consideration.
“Ah, well.” Harry’s amusement slid off his face. Draco realized the light of laughter in his eyes had hidden how exhausted the boy looked. Harry tilted his head back, taking a deep breath before closing his eyes. “You have to promise that this stays between us. Alright?”
She switched tracks when she realized he truly had no clue, instead roping him in to brainstorm ways to snap Draco out of it.
Draco deeply, whole-heartedly, wished she was. It was relatively simple when laid out like this- he could see how the year would go. He would continue his friendship with Potter, and this sodding golden boy with his golden fucking heart would worm his way deeper and deeper into Draco, smoothing all his sharp edges with disgusting things like hope. And then, at the end, when Draco had let himself believe that things might be good, the world outside of Hogwarts would tear them apart. Potter would probably try for it not to, of course. He was good like that. He would send owls and have tea with Narcissa, but every day he went into Auror training he would be asked, nagged, and battered about his connection to Draco.
The thought struck him like lightning. He could do it now, while Potter was still asleep, get it out of his system and then begin to extricate himself. It would be a goodbye.
third years decided to come in and try to talk to me, but they startled me and I ended up… well…”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked when he had recovered, hoping the strain in his voice sounded as if it came from choking and nothing else.
“I love you,” Harry replied.
Harry was outside the infirmary.
They walked in silence, though Draco could feel Weasley’s occasional glances. After the fifth time, Draco stopped short.
She flashed a cold smile.
“Right, I shall be back in the morning to check in- please for the love of Merlin, don't try
“Died. Yeah, I remember.” Harry’s tone was dry, but Draco could feel how he had stiffened.
When they finally released the snitch, it was like none of the events since their last match against each other had occurred. The two of them were neck and neck. Every time one of them caught a glimpse of gold they shot off, only seconds ahead of the other.
It made Draco ache. He recalled the weight of Potter in his arms, of his breath fanning across his neck. He had watched Granger run her hands through his hair, and wished he had done the same before leaving him in the hospital wing.
“We were coming out to join when we saw you start to fall, Hermione kept trying to cast a cushioning charm but something kept stopping the spell from reaching you. What happened?”
“What I think is that Harry became the Master of Death through his ownership of the wand and some other factors, and that gave him quite a bit of extra power. However, because he had then gone and died, Death was ready to claim him. And then when Harry was able to come back- well. Death is trying to collect on what it believes it rightfully owns.”
The golden trio lost it, all laughing into their plates, completely unaware of how a pair of grey eyes across the room softened at the sight.
The other eighth years, however…
“Pomfrey was casting spell after spell trying to figure out what happened. McGonagall came in and got Hermione and I to put our memories of it into a pensive, but any time we tried to ask you for one there was, well…”
“No, please, listen to me, I refuse to let myself go through this- I.. I need, to not-”
It had taken him a few seconds after his descent slowed to think to look at Harry. He had to work hard at twisting enough to catch sight of him, but he remembered clearly the initial feeling of
“About…?”
“I promise, Draco.”
Malfoy was
They grinned at each other. It felt like so long ago that they had been fourth years, anxious after hearing the rumors of Potter being able to throw off the Unforgivable. Wanting to try it themselves, Draco more than anyone.  He turned to look down at the boy next to him.
Pansy and Weasley shared a glance, and Draco had the distinct feeling of being in the wrong universe. Since when did Pansy share looks with
He reached out and smoothed some of the hair off of Harry’s forehead. When the boy didn’t react, he let out a sigh.
“Erm, so, the first time I had to stay overnight here a few
“Him agreeing when we wanted to see how the Imperius felt? I can’t believe-“
, well. The description might have made more sense now.
Harry must’ve woken at some point in the day, as there was a tray of nibbled on food next to him with a half drunk glass of water. He currently seemed dead to the world, just as unconscious as he had been when Draco had brought him in. Draco stilled, all at once unsure of his plan.
“I know darling, it’s horrific that people know you’re in love, but that’s the price of you refusing to be separated from him. What’s that thing muggles say? Till death do us part?”
If Draco had not just caught a fainting savior he might’ve had the wherewithal to decipher this expression as a cross between resigned acceptance and worry, but as it happened he had just caught the chosen one after an incredible display of…
“Your turn!” Chirped Harry, forcing a smile. It didn’t comfort either of them.
“I’m… sorry?” He tried. She snorted and brushed some of the tears away.
“What?” Came the elegant reply.
“Ah. Well. Long story short- when you fled from that thing in the forest, that was Quirrel who had Voldemort stuck on the back of his head. He was the one killing the unicorns, trying to keep ‘im alive an all.” There was a beat of silence where Weasley squirmed in his seat. “I forgot not everyone knows.”
The only time Andrew even spoke seemed to be when he was barking orders at Draco.
Andrew beat her to the punchline. "I've been courting Cassiopeia since Samhain."
"Have you tried talking to her about it?" Hermione asked.
Harry wanted to die of embarrassment. He'd had to go and make a fool of himself in front of the whole group of sirens in the Great Hall, had been dumb enough to assume that Draco had... What? Waited for him? They weren't even friends!
"Thank you, Cassie, for such valuable insight," he spat, fixing the mistake. The second he did, he could feel the air around him shift, as if the wind were telling him a secret in passing.
All of Hogwarts had been summoned to the Great Hall for breakfast, the Prefects ushering them quickly out of bed to get dressed and head down. Harry sent Ron a look of confusion, but his friend merely shrugged in response.
That... was a fair point. If only Harry was a more thoughts-before-action type of bloke.
But, if she lived in chilled waters, she wouldn't have to adapt between temperatures, she'd magically adjust and that'd be that. He wondered if she missed the arctic--even though she reassured him she didn't that much--if she missed being surrounded by others like her.
He just hoped that he wouldn't let Draco down. That he wouldn't fail to protect him from the war looming over them. He knew objectively they would both walk away with scars both physical and mental, but he simply didn't want Draco to feel like he had to suffer alone. His mate was much more powerful than him, but that didn't mean he wasn't allowed to be vulnerable at the same time.
He gripped Cassie's hand even tighter, tight enough that maybe he could get some of her strength from the contact. As shouting voices of concern mounted in volume, McGonagall and Dumbledore and Snape rushing to the trembling boy with Aurors not far behind, his grip tightened to the point that he was certain he had just broken two of his fingers.
It was an easy decision to let the sirens raise Cassiopeia. He visited a few times a year, and as the aftermath of the war died down and Death Eaters were imprisoned, he was able to visit every few weeks. As she grew she somehow managed to look more and more like her mother with each passing day. It was both a blessing and a curse that she took after Cassandra.
Their trek to the castle was just as quiet. McGonagall and Dumbledore were waiting for them all at the entrance, ushering them in. They followed the Headmaster up a multitude of staircases heading towards the west side of the fortress. Draco realized that they must be heading towards a lower part of Ravenclaw tower. Sure enough, they came to a corridor that was mostly a large expanse of brick wall. Pulling out his wand, Severus tapped five times on a brick as though he were tapping on the points of a star.
"Is he alright?"
Cassie sucked on her teeth. "Don't confuse love with ignorance, Draco. Sirens may only love once, but that doesn't mean that the object of our affection is good for us. Look how it turned out for my mother. I don't blame my father, I really don't, but I promised myself that I wouldn't make the same mistake she did. Yes, I loved him long before his offering. But I had to know he was in it for the right reasons and that he wasn't blind to the face of reality."
"I'm a monster! You knew that! You can't get mad at a
Yet, Cassie had a point. Even Severus radiated a friendlier energy. Underneath the hard exterior, Draco could feel the pain held close to his godfather's heart. It tainted his whole aura with a bitter tang while also carrying a warmth of childlike curiosity and affection. Other than his mother's aura, Severus' was ranked up there on Draco's favorites of those he'd ever encountered among magic folk. It seemed to be one of the few that was genuinely honest, an accurate reflection of the person portrayed outward. Honest on the inside, and out.
He should have been felt more anxious, more afraid for what was ahead. But things were different now, and so was he. Let the universe throw whatever it wanted his way.
As he started looking for it, Draco realized how blind he truly was. The soft touches, the staring when the other wasn't looking, the bright smiles when caught in the act of said staring...
"Harry, this is the fourth time you've read that book cover-to-cover. It's not going to change, so you may as well just say what's on your mind."
Umbridge could have had steam coming out of her ears with a look like that on her face.
"Yep."
He ended up tripped up on his own feet, tumbling to the floor in a flurry of black robes. His ears burned red and not even Draco could tell you which of the two things he was more embarrassed about.
Loss. Someone died. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. It was someone Cassie knew. Please not be someone that Draco knew as well.
Draco had felt so real that Harry questioned if the event had actually occurred. Because, as he opened his eyes once more, Draco was gone without a trace. Vanished into thin air without even the slightest of sounds. Because he was still dead. Like his parents, he'd been there to save him, even if it didn't add up.
"While this has been enlightening," Snape grumbled, "I have seen and heard enough to last a lifetime."
He held a vial of polyjuice potion out to Draco who could only stare in response. Panic filled his brain with loud static, a lump growing in his throat as his chest tightened. Everything was red.
"I am not giving you advice, children." Aegeus stared firmly at Cassie's still-corked vial. "My words are guidance, and they hold worlds of weight compared to yours."
Draco shoved the damned thing into Cassie's hands. She was meticulous in opening the envelope, sliding out its contents like they could rip with the tiniest of efforts. Draco didn't dare read over her shoulder, instead choosing to watch her eyes as they scanned over the words. She read them over once. Twice. Three times. Dark eyes that grew darker and heavier each read-through, before meeting Draco's. He wasn't sure if he wanted them to unload some of their burden onto him, if he would be strong enough to carry it.
Great, so
They made it back just after sundown, and Draco pondered the likelihood of Peeves coming after them to stir up a cauldron of trouble. Filch wouldn't be able to do much to them if they were caught outside of their dormitories, other than perhaps demand that Severus serve them detention.
"Mister Potter," he addressed, "you have become aware of information that has not been publicly disclosed. Miss Prince's identity as Severus' daughter must be kept confidential, and it is of the highest importance that you understand that."
Draco was not having any of this. "Potter, did someone slip something into your pumpkin juice? Have you finally gone mad?"
Remus felt the need to add, "You act like you won't be visiting every weekend."
Harry turned to look at the professor in confusion. "Them?"
His godfather still had the common courtesy to announce himself. "I'm right here, Draco."
"Does he know?" Draco hissed at Cassie, who turned her head so he could watch her roll her eyes.
"Before we go anywhere, my father would
Umbridge was not finished. "Is something the matter?" she inquired.
Cassie tapped his shoulder. Right, the cloaking.
Was he hallucinating? "They're both blokes."
"Dray, you can talk to me, you know? I don't know if your mother has
While he could see the resemblance, her appearance was highly suspicious. Hogwarts hadn't ever had exchange students in the past--he'd checked--especially not ones from Ilvermorny. He hadn't even heard of the school (granted, he wasn't very familiar with any magical schools other than Hogwarts before this year), and for them to send an exchange student but not participate in the Triwizard Tournament? Or even send more than just the one student?
Cassie tucked her face into the crook of his neck. "Dad, you know as good as anyone that I need to do this. For both of us."
Draco immediately thought of his father. He certainly disliked the Boy Who Lived, but was it enough to support a ploy to bring about his death? Was Moody the only one involved? And wasn't he an Auror? Certainly not a follower of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Cassie wrapped up her last sentence, and then leveled with him. "Draco. I love you dearly, but sometimes I really do question whether there is anything occupying that thick skull of yours. Now, please shut up, or I might just bash your head in to prove my point."
In some twisted way, Draco could see how his grandmother's actions could be seen as protection. Sirens have always been prosecuted and brutally killed by the Ministry, and if her secret got out, keeping her safe would've turned impossible. Fueled by fear of not understanding her siren daughter and the need to protect her from the world turned it all into a distorted goal of snuffing out the thing that caused both. Two birds with one stone, and all that.
There was a certain lilt to her words, like she was trying to convince herself at the same time. So, she hadn't known that Dumbledore knew. She was just prepared to blindly defend her father's honor.
Watching through the magic window in the hedge wall he was cursed with witnessing the moment Harry reopened his eyes. The utter devastation tore the air from his lungs. Eyes that looked around with desperate hope, then overflowed with tears when they could not find what they were looking for. Eyes that longed for Draco. His heart would have been better off being ripped from his chest than having to live through this moment. He wanted to push through the walls, throw himself at the other boy, assure him that everything would be alright, that both of them were alright.
He was leveled with a glare that rivaled his mother's. "What we do know is that it keeps him out of your head, thereby keeping you safe from his influence. You can counter the drowsiness from a Pepper-Up while I work on reducing the side-effects, okay?"
. People were talking, their raised voices pounding nails into his skull, and shrinking away from them was fruitless. Hands grabbed his shoulders and he wanted to thrash away--he might've, as he registered his body slamming onto a hard surface--and he was a turtle wrapped in a ghost net. He was dying.
"You and me both, Severus. You and me both..."
Never one for public displays of affection, Cassiopeia became an octopus that clung to Andrew around the clock. The behavior was unsettling for Draco. She was still acting as though she'd never see him again despite a whole week of breathing and walking proof that Andy was more than fine.
Thankfully for him, Snape continued. "She may already know this, but when she introduced me to him for the first time, I was the most terrified I had ever been in my entire life. I saw the way she looked at him, and that was all it took. I had lost her."
"Hey, are you alright?" Corey questioned, blinking wearily as he sat up in his sleeping bag. They were in a tent.
"Did the Ministry... Do they suspect who did it?" she asked, and still Draco didn't look away from her. She was being strong enough for the two of them, he could feel it.
Ezio was not fond of the young Oracle's words. "You are asking to put my only two descendants in the line of fire. The last of my blood, served up on a platter to the very monster that ripped my children's lives from me. Their parents. Justify this to me; do their lives truly mean more than others' if they must risk a premature death? These are children. Not soldiers for some goddamn war."
“Right, out with it then. I have become recently aware that I have certain
“Right. You said when you went into the forest, that day, that you had the cloak and the stone with you, and you used them. Well, because you had mastery of the elder wand, you became the Master of Death. But then you…”
Draco vaguely recognized the warmth of soft lips on his forehead before he drifted to sleep.
“I was so close to figuring it out, you
In the days immediately after his apology to Granger there were some small hiccups. Moments when Harry’s face would shine with adoration, and Draco would have to force down the swell of delight that crept up his spine. Similarly he caught himself gazing at Harry’s profile in classes, or letting his eyes linger too long on his figure as they walked down the corridor.
Harry could hear Draco now, trying to talk to him. They were only a meter or so apart, but the sound was muffled. Harry distantly realized that that might not be a good sign: he could feel his heart beating too fast, trying to keep up with the strain of creating and maintaining the net. He heard the voice remind him he would do
Draco peeked from between his fingers, taking in the breathless hope in Harry’s eyes. He nodded. Harry let out a laugh. It was bright and filled with exuberance. Draco simultaneously wished he could bottle the sound, and wished he had never heard it for the sap it made of him.
“Well it doesn’t really matter, I know McGonagal wants to wait but we don’t know how long your tie to him is going to last, plus if this round doesn’t work we need to know sooner so we can find some other avenue,” Hermione said, as if it were entirely reasonable to perform a potentially dangerous ritual without the extra support of other very accomplished wix. “And really, we would’ve tried it earlier if she hadn’t been so worried, so it’s not like we weren’t patient.”
burned through them, stretching into the minutes after they separated.
And Potter is certainly a sight.
What was he thinking? There was no point in trying to become someone Harry deserved, not when he knew that he couldn’t let it go anywhere. He wouldn’t.
“Who said anything about love?” He squeaked, ignoring the way Pansy rolled her eyes.
“Fair ‘nough. So something about that detention?” Weasley prompted again.
_____
Hermione cleared her throat, and Draco did his best not to roll his eyes at the way hers and Ron’s eyes shone suspiciously. He redirected the impulse by looking at Pansy instead.
Could he make Potter understand without bearing too much of himself? He knew if he pulled away with no explanation that it would result in a confrontation- he’d seen enough of them from the Gryffindors over the years. If he had this secret goodbye, followed by some excuse to Potter later, would it be enough?
“So much for greeting as old friends,” Ron scoffed, to which Hermione nodded. Draco hoped it made as little sense to everyone else in the room as it did to him.
Hermione hesitated. “There’s only further descriptions of what the wix was dying of, really. It sounds like what we could call magical core degeneration, which is essentially the opposite of what’s happening to Harry. There might be other books…”
, and instead of feeling his walls fill in their Potter shaped holes, he thought their contours were getting more defined. It didn’t help that Draco had been wrong in assuming that the night in the hospital wing would have been the last time Potter would touch him. Oh no. Potter’s easy affection with his friends extended to him too.
“You being a git isn’t enough to scare me off, Ferret,” Weasley said breezily. “Now, I know something is going on. I don’t really know what and when I tried to ask Mione also told me to leave off, but I’m tired of this. Whatever shit you need to work through- do it faster.”
Before he could react, Draco lunged forward. His fingertips just brushed the wings of the snitch before it took a sharp left, leaving Draco to topple over, and off, his broom.
Preoccupied as he was, it escaped Harry’s notice that Hermione was watching him watch Malfoy. A small smile broke over her face. When Harry had insisted on speaking at Draco’s trial, she was worried that he would regret it. After all, it had only taken a few moments for their conversation to come to blows when Harry had tried to return Malfoy’s wand after fixing his own. But from that initial attempt at communication, the boys had reached a tentative and, frankly, very sweet truce. She would be even inclined to call it a friendship if she hadn’t noticed how often Harry dithered while responding to Draco’s owls since the trial.
old hat at this whole dying at school business, but if you ever come close again, leave me out of it. I haven’t spent so much time in the infirmary since you put me there, and even then it was only overnight. One night, mind you! One, singular, medicated sleep.”
Draco closed his eyes. Her tone of voice was bland, but gave no room for argument.
She turned away and swept out of the classroom, fixing him with one last look that clearly said and
The cold sensation was easing, though the tugging on his hands seemed to be getting stronger. Draco put a hand to Harry’s chest, where the glowing was the brightest.
“Can’t be worse than getting the dark mark, mate!” Ron chirped, before Hermione smacked his arm.
“You’re the only one he trusts.” He blurted out. She looked at him incredulously. “Adult, or faculty- I mean. You. You mean as much to him as he does, to you.”
“I mean,” Draco continued,”I’m starting to get the picture with the muggle situation, which, sorry again, for being a prick about it, but you can’t honestly tell me that coming to school after nearly dying
“So you think death is trying to claim Harry? How can- I mean becoming the Master of Death is a
“Anyway, I know
Granger, for her part, exuded extreme anxiety and deep calm in equal measures. She was directing Slughorn to summon Madame Pomfrey, while gathering Pansy’s account of what happened.
. Especially if that something would help Harry.
“Thank you, Mister Malfoy. I feel very lucky to have known Harry, and I am equally grateful that you have gotten the chance to become close with him as well. Please, think about what I’ve said. I will certainly be thinking about your words.”
“I believe you just saw that it was myself,” he said, tone icy. “I understand it might be difficult to imagine I care about anything, but to question if I was worried about my-“
And then, as if sensing the conviction setting in, Potter would do something ridiculous like whisper a joke about their homework, or proudly hold up a paper crane that Draco was unaware he had even been practicing.
go with you. Entity Death I am the Tether to your Master and I need him to
The liquid was an instant balm to his frayed nerves. Its biting chill took the edge off his feverish alarm, allowing him to feel as oxygen returned to his extremities. Each breath made the calm spread until finally his mind was blissfully quiet.
It hurt more than he was expecting it to. One summer and a handful of weeks was all it had taken for it to get this far. For his eyes to burn at the thought of Potter pulling away from him, for him to lose composure in relative public just at the notion that they couldn’t stay connected in the future. It was embarrassing, the hold Potter had over him.
“What if… can we still be friends?” Harry’s voice was just above a whisper, much calmer than the frantic pleading of Draco’s.
For Harry’s part, he decided that the damage had already been done and if this resulted in him being decked that Madam Pomfrey would at least be pleased to know it wasn’t a professor who sent him to the hospital wing this time. Draco, on the other hand, froze as a fierce blush took over his face.
“That’s what it seems like,” Harry sighed. “If it wasn’t bad enough, it comes at a pretty high cost too. That’s why I’m still here, Madam Pomfrey said the strain on my heart from potions today could’ve put me into cardiac arrest. She’s seen me almost every day since we got back to school, and Molly made me go to St. Mungo’s almost every week over the summer. I- ah, this doesn’t paint me in the best light, but I’ve been kind of ignoring it.”
bad?” Draco exclaimed, waving his hands in the general direction of the quidditch pitch. “Potter you’re mental, I can’t believe you ever came back to school.”
“Fishing for compliments, Malfoy?” Harry threw back, elbowing the blond lightly as soft heat fell over them both. “Am I not telling you enough?”
“She needs to see this, I think it means she’s on the right track. Though…” Pansy chewed her lip, something Draco hadn’t seen her do since she was fourteen and decided it was inelegant. He was struck once again with the shock of how close she and Harry had gotten, for her to be worried about him like this.
Draco was struck with the sudden desire to tell her that Harry sometimes referred to her as Minnie, that it was okay for her to care so much about the boy laying next to him because some adult had to, that he didn’t buy her attempt at professional distance for a second because he had already tried being distant from Harry and it was futile.
“No, of course he’s not done something- why do you keep thinking he’s done something?” Harry snapped, leaving Ron to hold his hands up in defense.
Draco wasn’t sure what to think. On one hand, the ginger had gotten it wrong. Draco wasn’t trying to protect Harry, he was trying to protect
Neither of them believed it, and Pansy momentarily wondered how they managed to become entangled in something so
Draco stared at her for a long moment before turning back to the tray of food before him. It had to have been at least eighteen hours since he had last eaten, but suddenly the idea of food had little appeal.
didn’t start to become tiring.”
Each affirmation felt like a spell, slowly dripping into Draco’s veins until he was weightless. He wanted to hate how gone on Harry he was, how simple words could make him float, but Harry saw him as
“Impossible?” Harry’s smile didn’t meet his eyes, and it made Draco wish he could tug the boy into his lap. Or perhaps vice versa, if his arms looked as comforting as he imagined they would be.
“Well… Professor McGonagall was right that ritual chants and old magic can be unpredictable, but this scenario most of the… potential for danger, I suppose, is from the fact that we believe Death itself is who is trying to keep Harry. You’re not pulling him away from something that’s bringing him to death, if that makes sense.”
“I think we’re going to be just fine. With an endorsement like that, we can take on anything.”
“To make fun of me? Or of him, I can’t quite tell, I’m sure he told you of his recent little revelation and I cannot believe that you would use it to- I don't know! I don’t understand what’s happening.” The admission seemed to be physically painful to Malfoy, his grimace and faint flush making him look even more ferret-y than usual.
“Ronald can you please focus? Tease Harry all you like once he’s safe,” came a reproachful tone.
“Yes,” Draco said haltingly, “yes, what I thought might’ve been his blood looked like the consistency of unicorn blood, but was dark and gold, rather than silver. I should probably tell Granger.” Draco moved to get off of the bed and was shocked when Pansy and Weasley both lunged forward, stopping him.
was a solid mass in Draco’s throat. He opened his mouth but no sound came out. A shaky breath escaped, followed by another. Before he could make sense of the movement, Harry tugged him down, tucking his head under his chin.
for your whereabouts on more than one occasion! You know just as well as I do that I tried to pull away, but he- every time, he- Pansy he…” Draco deflated, mortified at the tears that sprang to his eyes.
“So the chant?” He said, straightening his back as much as possible.
“So, I think something from that should be your missing piece. I don’t believe that was the actual chant, but it’s more than we had before. You should just have to say it a few times, if possible we should have that spell up so you can focus on the bit of Harry’s magic that’s tied to you. Straightforward, really.”
Draco glanced around the library, content that no one was nearby to see him rest his head on the table and let out a small groan.
Harry ducked his head and laughed, oblivious to the wave of adrenaline coursing through the blond boy.
Harry spent the next day alternating between contemplative silences and staring at Draco.
was clear.
Draco huffed out a small laugh and settled back down in the bed. He watched through increasingly bleary eyes as Pansy pushed together the recently vacated chairs and transfigured them into an elegant fainting couch.
Draco turned sharply towards her, eyes narrowed.
All the little things he had tried not to notice, tried not to be in love with, jumped out at him. Harry’s hands, peppered with calluses from his wand and broom, seemed so strong. They were the hands of someone who clearly didn’t understand the importance of moisturizer, someone who might’ve had more important things to do. His eyelashes were long and dark, and Draco ached at the memory of how they made his green irises seem brighter by contrast.
“Oh, they had to come by before dinner, after a year on the run Pomfrey thought we could use some nutrient potions and stuff, so when they came for their dose was when they put it up today.”
“Er, so. That’s kinda what happened in potions. I saw you were about to get hurt, and I just… lost it?”
The field is gone, but when Draco approaches he realized the potion had also been corrected, any trace of it’s volatile reaction was erased.
Two weeks into their eighth year and Harry had spent most of it in and out of the infirmary, getting tests and checkups and hiding from other students. Madam Pomfrey had been a source of constant support for Harry in his tenure at Hogwarts, and this year was proving to be no exception.
Madam Pomfrey seemed to know what he was asking, and shook her head solemnly, her lips pursed into a tight frown.
“Shit, Draco, you need to sleep! We’ve got Herbology at the crack of dawn, go back to the dorm!”
Days flew by in a blur, convictions and contradictions chasing out all other thoughts until Draco felt he could see the mental rut they had caused. He tried to continue on as usual, but it was clear to anyone who looked that he was slipping.
There’s a containment bubble around their cauldron: strong enough to be visible to the naked eye, and yet a quick survey of the class shows no one has their wand out. In fact, aside from Slughorn and Potter, hardly anyone is looking at their cauldron, too busy tending to their own even as they titter about.
“Darling, has Hermione come in to see this yet?”
“Alright, as most of you are not in fact tied to Mister Potter, I believe you all have classes to be attending instead. If you feel ready, we will reconvene tomorrow to conduct this ritual with both myself and Poppy here to supervise. Miss Granger, you and Mister Weasley can inform me of what you’ve learned from your excursion after dinner.”
Harry’s mouth was slack, but Draco could easily see how his lips would quirk to the side, or set in determination. He had thought of how soft they were against his; despite Harry’s atrocious lack of grooming skills, they hadn’t been chapped. It made Draco mad knowing how it felt to be kissed by Harry, while also knowing it wouldn’t happen again. Never mind that it was a self imposed limitation.
She stood and waited for everyone except Draco to leave the infirmary. Hermione left her books on the table next to the bed, and gave him an awkward hug before leaving. Ron shrugged as Draco stared wide-eyed at her retreating figure, and followed her out. Pansy pressed a quick kiss to the side of his head and murmured “don’t die,” before leaving as well.
Draco wished he had some control over the hope that was sweeping through him like daybreak. It was clear that, at present, Harry had no reservations on Draco remaining close to him- in more ways than one. He knew that Pansy wouldn’t be so easily swayed. It was her voice that warned him that this might not be permanent, that this could backfire so deeply that he might not recover.
He was so busy convincing himself it wouldn’t bother him for Potter to leave with Finnegan, he almost missed the way Harry’s expression flattened.
There were the books Hermione had left on one side of him, and still unconscious Harry on his other. With a quick glance around, Draco decided it would be alright for him to lay down for a little. Might as well, really. He slipped down in the bed, burrowing under the mussed sheets as much as he could.
Draco decided the best way to stop the glares was to pull her to the side one day after transfiguration, where McGonagall had paired them together. One meaningful glance from Weasley was all it took for the redhead to tug Potter out of the room, leaving Granger and himself to stand ten paces from each other. It was easier than he thought it would be- apologizing for his behavior.
Both boys seemed surprised at the admission.
This was of course to avoid talking about the rising suspicion they all had that Harry’s brief foray into the afterlife had given him something of a competitive edge. An understatement if the summer was any indication. More than once Ron and Hermione had woken up to all of the furniture in Grimmauld Place levitating, or dancing, or rapidly changing appearance.
Except, he didn’t look like the Draco Malfoy that Harry knew.
“How is he?” Ron asked quietly.
He knew if Harry made it through this that he wouldn’t be able to go back to last names and stilted friendship.
This train of thought prevented the professor from realizing how the Malfoy boy stiffened in his seat upon hearing exactly
But aside from those minuscule incidents, pulling away from Harry was going well.
“Yeah, she did. I think she also has a lead,” Pansy said mildly.
Hermione nodded, looking as if she wanted to share more. Draco was just about to ask her to continue when Madam Pomfrey spoke up.
At that moment, Granger's hand shot out in front of him. He blinked at the sight, startling backwards.
“The two of you may floo from my office.” She said, inclining her head towards the couple. She turned to face Pansy. “Miss Parkinson, can I trust you will stay here until they return?”
“Well let’s see if it’s worked.”
It was night, he realized. Hours must have passed, but he had no recollection of what happened during them.
“Everyone. The papers, your bosses, your friends- fuck probably my friends, if they’re that upset with me. Blaise might even be first in line, and I can’t even blame him.” Draco’s defeated tone claws at Harry’s heart.
Draco drew it back silently, not willing to risk alerting Madam Pomfrey.
If she hadn’t, she might’ve been inclined to say the spell had gone wrong.
“Right, so we found you two on the ground after watching Harry do,” he waved his hand, “what he does, and ah… Hermione was kind of losing it. I called for Pomfrey, obviously she knows that stuff’s been up with him, and she came down just as you stopped Hermione from trying to lift him. You said something about not moving people with possible head injuries- sounded right out of a textbook, mate- and then Pomfrey did some scan on him to see if he could be moved safely, she had you carry him cause… well, I had my hands full with Mione.” He took a breath, casting a heavy look towards the doors the aforementioned girl had disappeared behind.
She held her hand out towards him, pinky outstretched, and he mimicked her. Then she wrapped her pinky around his, and he bent his to mirror hers.
on a silver platter.
"Two Nightingales are directly involved in Voldemort's downfall," Aegeus reminded them for the millionth time, "it's imperative they be accessible to those seeking to defeat him."
"What in the bloody hell?" Ron asked, directing the question more at Hermione than anyone else.
--a child's game consisting of trying to shove each other into a sea urchin while trying not to get splayed by their spikes--until they were overcome with laughter that blinded them in their efforts; The urchins surely were not pleased at being disturbed so late in the evening by siren's tails crashing into them full-force.
His chest kept growing tighter and tighter. He couldn't take any more. There better not be anything more.
Draco nodded his head in thanks, and got nothing else in reply. Getting the memo, he made his way back towards the castle and tried to explain for himself his actions from today. Taking action not once, but twice, in front of Potter? He must be going mad. Even worse, he hadn't even thought before acting, had been going on pure instinct and only realizing the potential consequences after the fact.
"Severus, thank you for coming." Lucius Malfoy looked gaunt. It did nothing to ease the terror swirling in Snape's gut, but it also didn't make it any worse.
He nodded an affirmation, and he watched Andrew cloak himself before the two swam off. It had been his idea to split up, as he knew he needed to get comfortable being by himself in the water. If absolutely necessary, he could easily locate the other two of his pod through echolocation.
"You called her feral, but that term isn't in any of the books on sirens. At least, not the ones that I've read."
would be filled with tonight's events, but he'd rather not have to be dragged into another unseemly interview.
It must have been... Violating. He couldn't imagine how painful it would've been, both physically and emotionally. To have that part of her identity stripped from her so cruelly.
But, now... He was 'terminally ill,' and therefore incapable of disgracing a bloodline people already figured would end with him, as grim as it sounded. He could go with a bloke, and it would be an accepted fact.
"Harry, you can't be serious!" Hermione looked ready to wack him upside the head with the book she was holding.
Lucius swallowed audibly. "I haven't been in contact with him for some time now, my Lord. At his age it is not uncommon for sirens to already be mated."
He was ready to turn the damn twigs into firewood. "That's the third time I've laid it! You can't be serious!"
Snape looked down at his desk. Silent. It gave Andrew ample opportunity to redirect his rage.
Although, the marriage would only be on paper, and not considered legitimate on the Islands. Mating bonds were tried and true, here, and not even death could sever them. He was reminded of this as he looked over to Cassie, the loose sweater she was wearing revealing the thin scar on her shoulder where one of Andrew's scales lied inside. The scar would soon fade even more, and in her siren form her left shoulder would hold a patch of vibrant red scales.
Draco rolled his eyes. She had the vocabulary of a well-educated sailor, it was too crude for
He shook his head, hating himself for dragging her away from the dance.
The shower spray was turned on, lukewarm water soaking him in a feeble attempt to calm his trembling nerves. He kept gagging, despite there being nothing left to purge from his system, the water dripping down his face and into his mouth and turning his coughs to pathetic gurgles. He wished for it to drown him. He wished he was capable of drowning.
"And, you know what the best part is? It's not even because she's a beast. You've done it to everyone! Severus, Cassie, Harry! We mean nothing to you unless we serve a purpose, our lives are only worth saving until that purpose runs up! What do you have to say for yourself, you fucking monster?!"
Her prejudice for werewolves? Sure, whatever, he could look past that. Her prejudice for who he had chosen as his husband?
The inflection he used on the word reminded Draco of how strong Andrew's American accent could be.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at him like he had grown three heads. "What on earth are you talking about?"
"What's wrong with him?"
thanks for sticking with the story, updates may be a bit erratic with fall semester starting and my professors deciding that I do not need sleep nor a semblance of free time.
"We're too far from the meeting point now for them to be able to find us. If they were running late, then we should assume whatever's chasing them is more important to escape than sending out a search party for two sirens. Especially because we can handle ourselves just fine," he said.
quickly replaced with cold dread. Harry’s eyes were black- he could tell even from such a distance. His curls whipped away from his face, giving an unobstructed view of the stiff way his face was set, so unlike the lighthearted joy that had been on it moments prior.
However, less than three hours after he had sent it, he had the reply dropped into his lap.
“I’m an idiot,” he said into her robes.
Draco’s mind was racing. In his previous imaginings of how this would go, he hadn’t considered the possibility of Potter liking him back. He wasn’t even sure that was a possibility now, but it seemed much more likely than it had before Harry had spoken.
“Though, I think you ought to apologize to Hermione. She prefers that sort of thing to be done in person, ya’know.” Weasley continued, shrugging.
Harry’s eyes were open; soft green gaze resting on the gilded cord connecting them. Draco could hear a relieved laugh, but it wasn’t until Harry reached out to touch his shaking shoulders that he realized it wasn’t himself making the noise. Instead, Draco was silent as tears made their way freely down his cheeks.
“Harry, I can’t- we can’t, I’m-“
She gave him a strained smile and took a breath.
She pulled away and patted him once on the cheek, ignoring the incredulous look he gave her. She turned to the subdued students.
“Resistance?” Draco supplied, easily imagining how hard he would have fought against anyone touching his memories. The suggestion earned him a weak smile and nod from Weasley.
Harry hummed in agreement, paying more attention to the way Draco’s long, elegant fingers seemed to conduct their conversation.
“In essence,” she started, as if every word pained her to say. “We have to try different chants until Harry wakes, or one ruins Mister Malfoy? Ritual chants are not magic to be taken lightly, old magic is hardly safe-“
“Draco, can you look at me?”
“Don’t be crass, Pans. You know as well as I do that he’s been quite busy in the past few years.” Draco sniffed, lifting a delicate bite of lunch to his mouth.
Maybe that was what stung the most, really. Even when he was unable to be separated from the epitome of everything good in their world, it wasn’t enough to combat the stain on him. He clamped a hand over his left arm.
Hermione nodded, and flipped open a decrepit looking tome. Draco and Pansy looked at each other before bending their heads to see what the book said.
to tell him. It filtered through that he had said Granger and Weasley had each other- not that he had them to talk to, too.
Draco took the parchment that she had pulled from one of the books on her lap.
“Professor?” Hermione’s tone was almost pleading.
“So what?” Asked Ron, genuinely perplexed.
Pansy, however, noticed.
Weasley took a sharp inhale, visibly trying to hold himself back from pressing harder. Draco was thankful.
“I am not quite sure where to begin,” Draco said, more to buy himself time than actually seeking direction.
“Fuck, stop yelling,” Harry mumbled.
“If you’re doing some whole self-pitying thing, thinking he’d be better off without you, he’ll be furious. Fuck’s sake, he’s had enough decisions made for him. At least let him make this one.”
Draco registered that Pomfrey and McGonagall were continuing to talk around him, he caught snatches of “core” and “tether” but they made little sense. He decided that if they wished to keep him in the dark, then he would make it easier on them by not paying attention. He busied himself with trailing his eyes over Harry.
Granger seemed to have a similar reaction with the light, as it turned mauve around her hair and shoulders. Weasley, still staring at Harry, was unaware of the light blue tendrils that ensconced his waist.
“I pay attention,” he said, tone grave as he spoke around his mouthful, “got to practice to increase my emotional range, I think I’m almost to a tablespoon now.”
“And yours?” McGonagall asked, looking down at the swirling light near her.
“Draco dearest, you’re about to ruin our potion.” Pansy’s voice is kind but the way she digs her fingers into his elbow conveys just how irritated she is with him.
Apparently Draco took long enough to contemplate this for Harry to realize the time.
The dark tears Draco had worried were blood would start to well up and spill over as his yelling became something more… desperate. He winced as he realized the women would hear his voice crack as he begged Harry not to do this, not to throw away his life for someone like him.
“What I don’t understand is everything else, why come here now? Surely you didn’t think I’d be awake, so what’s the point?”
Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head, letting out a breath. When they open again there’s no trace of the gold that encircled them just moments before.
Draco sighed, suddenly wishing he had saved his panic for tomorrow. If he had, he might’ve been able to convince Harry to let him sleep in the comfort of his lap. Slowly he disentangled himself, aware that this might be the last time he could be so close to the dark haired boy. He let himself give Harry’s curls one last brush before bidding the boy goodnight, and making his way out of the infirmary.
“It… it really doesn’t sound dangerous?” Draco didn’t intend for it to be a question, but apparently his nerves were determined to betray him.
“No! You can’t leave, every time you get more than a half meter from him he stops breathing again,” Weasley said in a rush. “Don’t you remember?”
“Harry, is something the matter with Malfoy?” She asked, hoping her tone sounded appropriately worried.
Together.
Harry swallowed, turning over excuse after excuse in his head. As much as he didn’t want to understand where Draco was coming from, the memory of one of Narcissa’s owls kept running through his mind.
He couldn’t hear anything. No voices but his own, no people other than the two of them and who he now knew to be the faint figures of Hermione and Ron on the ground.
It had been her idea, of course. “Surely my being there will help you, plus Potter might even be an ass to me and you’ll see he’s not worth all this pinning.”
“If he ever even looks at anyone else after this, I’ll gut him myself- don’t worry.” Draco said, brushing the pads of his fingers over Harry’s forehead before lightly carding them through his unruly curls.
Before either of them could say anything, Draco’s face split into a jaw cracking yawn. Pansy’s expression immediately softened.
Minerva cupped Harry’s face in her hands, his wide-eyed expression not enough to deter her.
“Eat, Mister Malfoy.” She gave a sharp nod towards the fruit he had clasped in his lap. She waited until he had taken several bites before speaking again. “I realize this has been a stressful event for you, but if you wouldn’t mind allowing us to review your memory of the incident yesterday, we might have a better chance of... recovering Mister Potter.”
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. His eyes still burned as he stared blankly at his fingers entwined with Pansy’s. He wished, not for the first time, that he could have loved her.
“The Master of Death. That rings a bell to you, Miss Granger?”
“He’s alive,” she said, “and that’s more than they thought they could do.”
“I’m not teasing you, or whatever mean-spirited thing you seem to think I’m doing. That’s not really my style. Besides,” He said, steeling himself, “if Harry’s been able to become friends with you, I reckon you’re probably alright.”
“I’m going to do some quick checks on him, alright dear?” She said, bustling over to Harry’s side.
Pomfrey gave a small laugh as she lifted one edge of her robes and stepped to the side. Every place she had been left small prints on the floor, fading within seconds only for new dark blue footmarks to appear when she moved again.
He also had the impression that Harry might have been holding him back, equally as tight, but dismissed it as wishful thinking.
“Min-Professor!” He called, “I didn’t actually think Madame Pomfrey was getting you, I’m sorry-“
“You have freckles, you know? And your hair, and the way you blushed, you’re just. Very…”
“You love me?” Harry asked, turning to Draco who still had his head still buried in his hands.
Draco hesitated before prodding Harry’s hand lightly, hoping he took it as an invitation to continue.
“I want you to hear me, okay? I’m not worried about people finding out about anything related to us. I’ve been undesirable number one, supposed heir of slytherin, and all other ridiculous things. If you’re worried about how these rumors or reactions might affect me- don’t. I want to make sure I’m understanding that that’s what your worry is.”
“Yes?”
“Yeah, yeah I promise I can do it. Just know that if you change your mind, you’re going to have to tell me. And,” Harry’s eyes slid to the side, seeming to deliberate on if he could say what he wanted to. “And know that I want you to change your mind.”
“And potions?”
He watched as the ginger cast a patronus, telling it to fetch Madam Pomfrey. Draco realized this was almost the opposite of what happened in potions. Granger was clearly panicking while Weasley was the one quietly taking charge, trying to prompt Draco for what happened.
, Draco thought before he let Ron’s words sink in. He took quick stock of his body and realized with no small amount of humiliation that he had wrapped himself even further around Harry, tangling their legs together and clasping him tight around his middle.
She shook her head.
Draco was just about to ask
“Just what was I supposed to do?” Draco responded, matching her tone.
“Harry, what have you gotten me into,” Draco whispered. “I know you don’t realize just how much you affect the people around you, but if you could just... have tried, at least. Have tried to reign it in, maybe I wouldn’t be in such a state.”
The problem with being a child in a war is that things fall out of priority quite quickly. Experiences that would be par for the course in any other setting, often fall to the wayside in the name of a greater good, or an old man's plans. However the perk of being these particular children, after this particular war, is they had the rest of their lives to make up for it.
“Harry owes me ten galleons,” said Granger, voice thick with fatigue.
_______
happened that morning, before a slow blush crawled up his face.
Nothing mattered but keeping Draco alive.
However, Draco was not in position to notice, and even if he had, he would have been hard pressed to guess what was happening as Harry watched him fall through the air.
__________
“Mister Potter, I would prefer you to stay for the rest of the night for observation, and you too Mister Malfoy.” Poppy said, giving a pointed look towards Hermione and Ron. They took the hint and bade their goodbyes, though Poppy doubted she could stop them if they had tried to say.
His glares were no longer effective in cowing the general public, however. It was an adjustment he had not quite made peace with.
“You’re handsome too,” was the teasing reply. Harry did seem genuine, but a compliment did not affection make.
Halfway through the bowl the doors of the infirmary swung open and Professor McGonagall swept in. Draco swallowed with some difficulty, watching as she approached the Matron.
Draco nodded, vaguely recalling seeing her.
As Harry gawked at the boy in front of him, a small voice that sounded suspiciously like Hermione’s reminded him that he had just had his glasses updated for the first time since he was a fourth year, and of course Malfoy wasn’t still going to look like a fourteen year old. That small voice was not quite loud enough to stop the louder, larger, more-sounding-like-Harry’s-own voice that was stuck on one word.
The only other person she had seen him get this flustered around was Cho. That was another realization Harry had yet to embrace from this summer.
“Miss Granger! Surely that’s not-“
Draco kicked her under the table, wincing as she kicked back.
If anything, this seemed to confuse the poor boy more.
She has just started to tip in the crushed star-thorns when Draco realizes it’s much too hot, and manages to pull himself and her to the floor when it begins to offgas sulphuric steam, hissing and spitting.
“Do I have to start addressing you that way?” Draco asked, as much a test as pinching himself would have been.
In fact, he knew Narcissa at least approved of him. They had exchanged a handful of owls over the summer after his initial refusal of tea, and had plans to spend a day with Andromeda and Teddy during Christmas hols. Molly and Arthur not only knew of his friendship with Draco, but had been the ones pushing for Harry to label it as such, rather than as a truce.
The last thought Draco had before sleep overtook him was that he and Harry ought to insist on last names only again, and a fervent hope that the distance would be enough to repair his battered heart.
It was such a perfect illustration of what made Draco fall for him that he groaned, dropping his head into his free hand.
“Ronald that’s quite enough!” Pansy’s shriek made the ginger burst into laughter, and once again Draco felt compelled to check that he was in the correct reality.
“I don’t want you to do the ritual.” She said, not hiding the sharp edge to her voice. Let him wonder if it was worry or anger. She wasn’t entirely sure herself.
As he did, his own magic began to show, deep red making a starker visual as he grasped the chain.
“Right, well. Later then.” Weasley lumbered into the classroom, returning to his spot next to Longbottom, immediately bending to look at their cauldron.
he told himself, though the voice sounded like his mother.
It felt, at the time, like a scolding. Harry wondered for days if his last note to Draco had been too harsh, if something in it had caused Narcissa to intervene, but the response from Draco was cheerful. Careful, but warm, and friendly, but now, months later, Harry understood Narccisa’s warning much more clearly.
But Pansy didn’t know that.
Which brought him back to the clarity the world possessed. He could see the faint smattering of freckles that dusted across Malfoy’s nose- he didn’t even know Malfoy had freckles before today.
The next few weeks passed in a series of stops and starts. Draco got Pansy to be the one to tell Ha- Potter, about his resolve for them to use their last names, and in return got a reproachful glare from Granger every time he saw her.
“Pansy, please just get out what’s on your mind, you’ll never finish your essay if you don't,” Draco said quietly, keeping his eyes trained out the window.
“There’s a bit of a chant involved. It’s quite a bit like the muggle wedding vows, but they’ve bungled it a bit. That’s why it sounded familiar when you mentioned it last night, Pansy. Mione had me keeping track of some of the phrases and that one kept coming up.”
“Around three,” Pansy answered. “The lead, Draco?”
Or at least, she wasn’t supposed to.
“I- we, won’t last. Our friendship, our… our anything. They won’t let us. You’ll become an auror and every day they’ll badger you about me, I’m a threat to you, to the life you should live, and Harry- I couldn’t make it. If you were any deeper in my skin, and you pulled away, it would break me. I’m already too close- I came to see if I could make myself say goodbye, but you-“ Draco let out a shaky breath, and that was the last straw for Harry.
Draco couldn’t decide whether to fume or to flush. Instead, he mostly felt tired.
“No you bint, today. After he got his glasses checked.”
else tonight, and do get some sleep. Goodnight!”
After one particularly harsh turn they lost sight of the snitch, trying to prevent themselves from colliding. Harry was transfixed as Draco evened out, laughing with his head tossed back.
“Tell me about potions, and tell me what you were thinking when you saw me that morning.”
It’s unfair that for all that Potter is distracted that his potion appears to be perfect, at least from what Draco can see. Granger’s shoulders are relaxed and she’s spending more time coaching Weasley and Longbottom than correcting Potter. Draco suddenly realizes that Potter has yet to make one mistake in their potions course yet this year.
“Harry James Potter, you will not die another time so long as I live, do you hear me?” Her voice was stern, though it carried a wobble that she couldn’t hide. She waited until the boy tried to nod, and threw her arms around him. “Oh young man you gave me such a fright, I can’t even begin to say!”
“So why won’t he wake up then? If Draco’s love is so powerful, shouldn’t he be alright already?” Pansy asked, stepping neatly out of reach when Draco reached out to pinch her side.
“Don’t act like I don’t know when something’s up with my best mate, and I know your apology to Mione didn’t come out of the blue. So,” he leaned forward, “figure it out. Whatever it is. Harry is… Harry deserves…”
Rising out of the memory he was startled to see Pansy now among the group watching him.
. He was certain if Harry had believed, even for a moment, Draco was doing it for any other reason he would’ve thrown a strop.
To Draco’s delight, Harry began to blush.
She was quieted by Weasley’s hand on hers.
“Well done, Weasel. You have successfully found me alive, now go and report back to The Nosey One.” Draco didn’t have the heart to put any acid into the words, and it made him all the more miserable.
Hiding in the library seemed like the natural response. The three of them had been tucked in the corner of the common room, Draco really being the only one trying to work. Pansy was knee deep in a story about her experience trying to sneak in firewhisky during the Yule Ball when Finnegan came over.
you, that maybe this would all be surface level, but your face when he fell earlier, I… Draco, there was no hiding how scared you were. Scared for him.”
“I suppose I should keep Hermione from finding out she won the bet, huh?”
“Did you try Envenerate?” He asked.
He deserved someone who was strong enough to face the public with him, the way he had done on his own for years. He deserved someone who wanted to protect him as much as he protected others. He deserved someone he wanted.
“Do you remember when Hagrid brought me back to the castle?”
“I believe so. You should have seen when Miss Granger and Mister Weasley were here, and look at how solid it is there-“ Pomfrey gestured to the light above Draco’s hands. “It’s only like this when he’s not been awake to control it, I’m sure it takes quite a bit out of him.”
“Alright Malfoy, let's go back to potions,” he said, hoping Harry would appreciate the effort it had taken not to refer to him as a ferret.
“Look, Potter, I know you know your way around the castle, I thought it was a mild enough barb to count as… well, never mind, clearly even obvious jests are too harsh for your Gryffindor sense of what tests a
“Seamus, I am actually busy right now. I’ll join next time.” His voice was firm, and then he turned to face Pansy once again, giving her a small smile. “So you had just realized the bottle was too big?” He prompted.
Draco made his way back to Pansy, who seemed to have finished the last steps perfectly, and was stirring methodically.
He probably needed someone to teach him how to be selfish, Draco decided. If he couldn’t be those other things, there still might be-
The dark haired boy hadn’t moved at all in the night. His chest still rose and fell in even measure, but Draco no longer felt the deep reassurance he had in the night from the sight.
“Alright alright everyone, please continue on your potions! I believe you all must be getting close to being finished!” Slughorn called, seeming to only just realize how the rest of the class had paused at Harry’s collapse.
Draco wasn’t sure what to do with this new light that shone on her character. He had always assumed it was Harry’s influence that made those around him be brash and ridiculous, or got them into situations where they had little other choice. Clearly this was giving Harry too much credit.
Scrawled in her neat handwriting was a set of three similar looking phrases. He read each carefully, but felt his breath catch on the last.
Small touches, a hand on his shoulder or clasping at his wrist as he was tugged to the quidditch pitch, an elbow to his side as they teased each other. It was driving Draco spare. That was why he was hiding alone in the library to begin with.
“Mister Malfoy, if you do decide to go forward with this, I will do everything I can to ensure your safety. Hogwarts has lost too many of her students.” With that, she swept into her office, leaving Draco with Pansy.
“Did they try?” Draco didn’t have to feign his surprise.
He was bored.
That got Draco to stop in place.
When they first came back to school, Harry trod lightly around the subject of flying with Malfoy. He knew that their experience in the Room of Requirement was one of the more tender spots between them, and resolved to give it, and anything related to it, a wide berth.
She knew from her not-infrequent conversations with Harry that Draco had changed substantially from the abrasive boy he had been for most of his schooling. She had patiently listened to the way Harry ranted about the other eighth years tip-toeing around the blonde boy.
At what, Draco doesn’t immediately understand, but once he’d been righted to standing he turns to look at their potion and stops short.
“I want to know what you were talking about- so fair’s fair,” Harry shrugged, eyes still closed.
other than himself, let alone Weasley?
“I don’t think you’re doing this out of any wish to reconcile with me,” she began, eyes hard despite their glassy appearance. “But I also know that Harry means a lot to you, therefore what he cares about, you do too. I… I’m accepting your apology, for the same reason. Harry means the world to me, and-“ she broke off with a huffed laugh, looking up at the ceiling. “And for some reason he cares about you too. So, thank you, Malfoy.”
“What, in his letters? Seems pretty vanilla for you, dear, I mean love letters? How gauche.”
Draco, for his part, was trying very hard not to be frustrated with all of the dancing around. The fact no one had mentioned what the voice had said, or what the light was, got under his skin. It felt like a reminder that he wasn’t trustworthy.
While she knew Harry wasn’t prone to falsehoods, he had always possessed a flair for the dramatic in a way that made her question the extent to which Draco Malfoy had been trying. However, between the way he had pleaded with Harry in his memory, and the gentle touch he had just unthinkingly given- she was convinced. More than a little touched, as well. Gaining Harry’s trust to the extent he obviously had was one thing, but knowing Harry let someone care for him the way Draco did- well, she was pleased to say the least.
McGonagall raised her hand, and apparently tried very hard not to do the same with her eyebrow. She was not particularly successful.
The relief she felt at the sight nearly immobilized her.
_____________
Granger spoke first, looking over at Malfoy wearily before asking Pomfrey, “Is that because he wasn’t conscious this time?”
It was… incomplete, somehow, but out of the ones written it came the closest. Draco told Hermione as much and was surprised when she blushed.
“We brought you dinner, you slept through lunch- Madam Pomfrey said.” Hermione’s voice had an edge of humor to it.
“Harry if you don’t come back to me Death will take us both, you absolute tosspot! I am your Tether and I refuse to die, and
A small cough brought Draco’s awareness back to the room at large. He snatched his hand back to his side and fought furiously against the blush that was rising before turning to face Madam Pomfrey. He realized his battle against turning pink was futile as he took in her raised brow.
Ron shrugged, but had the awareness to look at least somewhat abashed.
“Why wouldn’t Draco be able to be separated from me?” Harry whined. “How long have I been out?”
“The charm of my company isn’t enough?” Draco teased, righting himself so Harry could reach his wand.
“Harry, dear, I believe you’re due in class at any moment. Best be on your way.”
Harry had manoeuvred them near a rock so he could be taller than Draco, arms still wrapped tight around each other. He pressed a kiss to the top of silver-blond hair, before rocking Draco in his arms.
“Wha’dya mean pretty? He’s a pointy git! He’s all pale and,” Ron scrunched up his face, trying to find the right word. “Delicate.” He decided.
“I knew it was in there, look at this!” Hermione cried, not bothering to wait for Ron to catch up with her as she shoved the book into their laps. “It’s right here,
“Pomfrey said it could be dangerous to wake him up like that, and Ron, h-he’s got n-n-no pulse,” she broke into a fresh wave of sobs.
“Is it presumptuous for me to not use that?” Draco asked mildly.
“I take it you are unsure?” She asked. “Would you like to review it yourself?”
Pansy came over at once and pulled his head to her shoulder, stroking his hair.
It was easier to babble than it was to let the moment stand. The electricity that ran between them was almost unbearable at times- a devotion and love so grand, already proven so early in their relationship- well. It was difficult to find a balance between defeating Death in the name of love, and being two teens who could hardly hold hands in front of their friends.
“Can we please not do this?” Draco asked wearily. To his chagrin Ron burst out laughing, and Hermione only barely managed to stifle her giggle.
Harry didn’t know how to explain that, to him, the biggest hurdles had already been cleared. Ron and Hermione had both given their approval, in their own ways. Draco himself had clearly come to terms with his own feelings. And Harry’s own acceptance felt like the last piece of the puzzle. When those foundations were set, what else could come between them?
Draco stared at her. What in Merlin’s name was she talking about? Draco didn’t recall anyone else, and he knew Harry hadn’t spoken the whole time.
She had clearly spent many of the last several hours crying: sleep couldn’t fix how red rimmed her eyes were, or the slight shudder to her exhales. She brought a hand up to rub at her face, and that was when Draco remembered.
He knew they would soon hear him trying to call out to Harry.
“I have absolutely no clue what you’re trying to say- do you need me to call Pomfrey?”
be- Madam Pomfrey- there’s no way!”
Draco looks down, and realizes absently that he was about to add powdered bicorn horn instead of powdered boomslang skin- a sure fire way to turn what should be a healing draught into a sizable explosion.
Draco shook his head.
“Started with the ritual, of course!” Granger’s tone suggested she thought this should be obvious.
“Here are the facts as I see them. You are in love with Potter. Potter is more powerful than we ever gave him credit for, and clearly something about that is going wrong. You are a former death eater. There is very little here that suggests a happy ending, darling.”
He turned his palm up to squeeze hers before nodding.
When McGonagall returned she was followed by a floating basin. The hospital wing was silent as the two women bent over the pensive, diving into Draco’s memory.
have had to start over. There’s nothing that can fix a reaction like that.”
“Alright, fine. You’re going to be angry though.” Pansy put down her quill and faced him head on. Her voice was low, and Draco knew with terrible clarity what was going to come next.
, a voice called, soft but unkind. Harry had enough experience with invasions of his mind to know this was another.
The problem with being a child in a war is that often things that would ordinarily be important seem to fall out of priority quite quickly. The problem with being this particular child, is that he already had quite a habit of not prioritizing things that ought to be important. Things like glasses appointments.
“Potter I swear to Merlin if the next word out of your mouth is pretty, I will knock you back out myself,” Draco said, trying not to panic.
Apparently that had been the right question to ask, because Harry let out a short laugh, and Draco felt the tension seeping out of his arms.
“Yes, well despite your romantic inclinations, it needs some work. Is there anything more in those decrepit volumes of yours that might help?”
“You are hurt aren’t you- oh god I knew the bastard was lying when it said it would help, you’d think I’d stop listening to voices- love, say something if you can, should I call for Pomfrey?”
The fact it was a genuine question was what made Draco raise his head from where it had been buried under Harry’s. They were only a few inches apart, and in any other scenario he might’ve flicked a pointed glance at Harry’s lips, but at present he couldn’t tear himself away from the steady fire of conviction that burned in his eyes.
“Once you‘ve eaten I’ll call the headmistress in. I sent Miss Parkinson to her dorm seeing as Mister Weasley and Miss Granger saw fit to do so, but I’m sure they will all be here again before long.”
Harry laughed as the doors closed behind him, thankful that at least one person in this school wasn’t treating him like glass. Ever since the staff had been informed that Harry had indeed died in the forest they had taken to slightly hysterical levels of protection. Professor Sprout couldn’t look at him without starting to tear up, and Headmistress McGonagall routinely pressed fruit into his hands whenever they passed in the hallways. And that was to say nothing of the students.
“I am the Tether to your Master- tie him to life, as he ties me. Until Death comes for us both, we shall not part.” Draco repeats, ignoring the growing cold. “We shall not part!” The tugging is somewhat worse, and Draco has a moment of clarity of realizing just
She had just begun detailing the argument around the versus they had written when the pair came running back in, unassuming leather bound book in tow.
“I’ve found exactly one mention of how someone else had gotten away from death- they didn’t have the h- elder wand conundrum, but they did have a very powerful Tether to life. Someone who they couldn’t be separated from.”
“I know you’re going to do it anyway,” Pansy said. “And I know that the list of people you care about enough to be so stupid for is small, so I won’t bother lecturing you on infectious self-sacrificing tendencies. But if this happens again?” The warning was clear. More of a threat, really, but Draco felt loved all the same.
There was a pause.
“And unpredictable. And kinda destroying him.” Ron added, putting a hand to his girlfriend's arm. “So, we’ve been looking into it some, and realized that dying while in control of the elder wand might have had some- ah, consequences?”
So really, if Harry could chalk up the surprising ease he had for NEWT level courses as anything other than an uncomfortable amount of power, he would do it. And if that uncomfortable amount of power was something all the staff was aware of, then he could pretend it was safely in their hands by going to Madam Pomfrey for every little sign that maybe this new level of power was affecting his body.
Draco wasn’t sure what happened next. One moment his eyes were vacantly trained on Harry’s face as Weasley whispered to his girlfriend, and the next he was curled around Harry’s prone form in the hospital wing.
Dark red tendrils floated around Young Malfoy, some thinner than others, but the strongest were clearly around his hands. However, that wasn’t what made McGonagall start. No, it was the thin band of gold that seemed to be tied within them. It was clearly not Draco’s own magic, and with the display that had occurred earlier she had a feeling that this small tie was part of the mystery.
“I wish I could say I was surprised, however I hope you three will have plenty of time to rethink this entirely foolish decision in detention with Poppy for the next three weeks. You are supposed to be leaders here! Mister Malfoy, while I am entirely grateful to your part in bringing Harry to safety, I had hoped your rather more
“Oh,” Harry said, as if it all made sense. It did, in some ways, but not enough that he was satisfied. He was, however, able to be more patient with his questions afterwards.
It had to work.
“Ron. How do you want me to answer that?” Harry asked wearily.
There was a stretch of silence after Draco spoke that made him realize how painfully earnest he sounded. He was just resolving to explain it away as a tactic for when Pansy inevitably brought it up when McGonagall spoke again.
“And I suppose the gold reminded her of something else?” Draco asked. “That doesn’t explain why you all are doing a terrible job of calling each other by your given names.”
This stopped Poppy’s flurry of action. A quick glance at Miss Granger and Mister Weasley told her this was news to them as well.
“It might not be dangerous.”
He picked up a spoon and a bowl of porridge.
“Mister Malfoy, while I appreciate your willingness I cannot endanger the life of a student for another- it’s unconscionable.” McGonagall's voice was firm, but Draco’s mind was made up.
“Mione,” Ron said quietly, taking her hand. “It’s okay.”
Weasley’s voice was nice. It was calm and deep, and didn’t cut through the cotton that had filled Draco’s mind the second he realized Harry was cold.
Blaise and Theo too could often be seen with the eighth years of other houses. Greg had decided not to come back, which left Draco to be seen as the lone snake. Aside from Harry and Pansy, no one approached him. There was very little outright hostility, especially after Finnegan had tried to jinx him the first day back, giving fuel to Potter’s fire as he lectured the whole of their year about leaving Draco alone. There just was no warmth either. For the most part, Draco didn’t mind. He had six years of being the Slytherin prince and that was quite enough. It would have been nice to have someone to talk to about Potter, though.
Now, flying way above the pitch, Harry couldn’t have been more glad.
Harry nodded once, quickly looking at the ground before forcing his eyes back to Malfoy’s flushed face, and nodded again.
“He saved me, Pans,” the words came out choked. “If I-“
“Draco?” Potter asked softly.
There was a heavy silence.
“So, regular, unconscious feats of extremely powerful magic,” he prompted.
“Unfortunately it kinda is, Professor. Sorry, it’s just…” Ron shrugged helplessly, gesturing to Harry’s prone form. “Gotta keep safe what we can, ya’know?”
They sat in silence like that until Pansy squeezed his hand, once, twice, then let go. She rose, giving a small nod to Granger as she turned to leave the room. A nonverbal goodnight that was returned from Granger’s place across the room, leaning heavily against a sleeping Weasley.
“I think Harry ought to be the one to decide if he’d like to share the full extent, but for the moment- yes.” Her eyes flashed and everyone in the room seemed to flinch as she fixed them with a hard stare. “This stays here, I am not afraid to use memory charms if that ends up being the only way to keep this quiet.”
Draco’s earlier realization crashed around him, stealing the air that Harry’s declaration seemed to fill him with just moments prior. Tears threatened to make themselves known, their stinging only just enough warning for Draco to duck his head.
Draco’s mouth was dry, but managed to croak out an assent.
It was only a result of years in etiquette training that prevented Draco’s mouth from falling open.
Time dripped like honey after that- one scene moving slowly but seamlessly to the next. After potions was a trip around the grounds, something his court-ordered mind healer suggested, followed by a methodical dinner passed in relative silence. Soon enough Draco was ensconced in the eighth year dorm, sitting in the armchair farthest from the fire, staring out the window.
The fear, anger, and overwhelming
In fact, even Slughorn isn’t looking at it. Instead his eyes are calculative as they set on Potter.
Draco, crouched on the floor with Harry’s head pressed in the crook of his neck, could think of nothing but how relieved he was that Harry’s breath seemed even and unbothered in his unconscious state.
Granger had Harry’s face cradled in her hands. Her fingertips were streaked with the remnants of dark tears, and he could hear that her scolding had turned to pleading whispers.
Granger and Weasley exchanged a look. It made Draco want to shake them, to ask what they were hiding. He was saved from acting on this temptation by Madam Pomfrey casting another diagnostic spell, one that lit up the entire room.
“We can ask them in the morning. Ridiculous Gryffindors, staying up all night doing all manner of things. No wonder they’re all so short tempered.”
“He’s not…?”
Just as he made it to the door of the infirmary he heard, “-And don’t come back sooner! If I hear one more professor realizing you need a health concern addressed, I’ll keep you here for good!”
“It involves the hallows,” she said meaningfully, flicking her eyes to Draco.
“Oh I’m
Draco, Granger, and Weasley all hovered as Madam Pomfrey went about casting diagnostic spell after spell, occasionally prompting Draco for more information on the incident.
Death can keep you apart. I’ve written a few if you’d like to see.”
“I know! Oh god the look on Theo’s face-“
Poppy catalogued all that she could see before turning around in one last visual sweep, in case she needed to review this incident in a pensive later. Once completed, she flicked her wand to end the spell.
He closed his eyes. It was bad enough, still enveloped in Harry’s warm embrace, but if he had to meet the searching, the yearning that was so apparent on his face, he knew his resolve would break.
Draco stared at the two of them.
Draco whipped his head to the side, mind trying to race despite the effects of the potion.
“To what?”
After they had sat down in the great hall, and found to Ron’s delight that he had been accurate in his prediction of roast chicken, Hermione resolved to stay out of it. She and Ginny had many an enlightening conversation over the summer, and all attempts to bring their conclusion to Harry’s attention had been met with confusion. If he needed more time to realize that his preference for lithe forms wasn’t limited to just girl athletes, she would give it to him.
Draco thought darkly.
“Well, first, I don’t want to be an auror anymore, so no worries about Robards or whoever trying to convince me that you’re evil. Second, if someone did try to say something like that about my boyfriend, I’d clearly have to correct them.”
“It’s about time you noticed,” Malfoy sniffed, eventually.
As a couple, they were shy about any sort of PDA. Harry had turned a spectacular shade of red when Draco had linked their pinkies together during a class. In retribution, Harry had pressed a kiss to Draco’s forehead while they were in the library one day, and both boys fled when Pansy cooed her approval. They seemed to argue all the time, but with so many endearments it was hard to tell.
“I’ll give you anything,” he said easily.
“You said you were in ‘such a state’ or something, maybe there?” Harry offered, ever trying to be helpful.
“Fucking priceless, oh Merlin I thought I’d never sleep again with him in the same room!”
Harry wondered absently as he packed up his books.
“Woah, okay, then why d’ya keep staring at him? Last time you were mad we didn’t think he was up to something and now you’re mad we’re asking?”
“Harry is well loved, as you know. But we, the staff, and his friends, knew that this might have been borrowed time. If I-“ she broke off again, and Draco couldn’t hold back.
“He would do it for anyone.” He said quietly, hoping the woman who Harry looked up to so much understood what he was leaving unsaid.
“Mr. Malfoy, please drink this.” Madam Pomfrey was watching him with worry written into every line of her face. She was pressing a cool glass vial into his hand, and he took it without a second thought.
He might also have noticed how Harry stiffened, as if someone had laid an unwelcome hand on his back.
Once Pomfrey had declared him safe, and done the same for Draco, she told them all to stay put while she retrieved the Headmistress. Draco thought she was giving them a moment of privacy, though one look at Hermione and Ron said they felt it was more time to fester in their guilt.
She paused, taking in the wide-eyed expression on Harry’s face.
This was the scene that Madam Pomfrey came into, clucking as she made her way to where their group was huddled.
“Well despite this altogether enjoyable discussion I believe I- we- have class to get to. Come along Potter, I shall not have you ruin my perfect attendance record.” With this Malfoy swiftly turned down the hallway, not pausing once as he strode towards charms.
Too many of her students had a haunted look about them this year, but that was to be expected. A tragedy of course- but grief was a natural response, and one she encouraged. Harry’s smile as he continued to take in the new crisp-ness of his surroundings was painful to Poppy because she couldn’t remember ever having seen it before. A small contentment. It was the expression of a child who had his needs met in a way Harry clearly was unaccustomed to.
Draco screamed when the force holding him up gave way, dropping him unceremoniously when he was a meter from the ground. He hit the grass with enough force that the wind knocked out of him, but his mind was stuck on Harry.
“We haven’t even gotten to Umbridge yet! Hermione said we had to wait until she thought I wouldn’t blame myself,” Draco scoffed, as if it were unwarranted. Harry considered bringing up how Draco had worked himself into a severe panic attack when they had told him how Ginny had come to possess Riddle’s cursed diary, but decided against it.
Draco was sure that Harry would give in. A few months into the school year and the other eighth years still went out of their way to avoid Draco. Potter occasionally pushed for him to be included, like during the game night Thomas and Daphne planned. Every time Draco made some excuse to pardon himself. It would be… appropriate, for Harry to leave them, and go be with his friends. All part of the distance Draco was trying to put between them.
, he thought,
“Darling,” Pansy whispered, rubbing between his shoulders. “It’s alright, you’re doing just fine-“
At that, everyone turned to Draco.
“I’m just trying to figure out what Harry sees, I guess.” Weasley’s voice suggested some level of amusement. It made Draco’s blood boil.
Harry winced as he re-thought his addition of that last tidbit. It was too late now to take it back, he could hope that Malfoy would gloss over it, but with the way his grip tightened Harry doubted it.
There was a moment of silence that Draco would have been tempted to label as awkward before Madam Pomfrey drew herself up.
He bolted upright, chest heaving as he bit back the cry that seemed determined to burst from his lungs. Taking in frantic gulps of air seemed to make the burning worse, and he flinched when someone touched his hand.
“Shut up! I didn’t realize what had happened until Pomfrey came out and found the lot of them frozen in place, after that Hermione helped her set up a ward that prevented anyone who wasn’t keyed in through to me. Ron has to be the one to key new people in, so if you got here without a problem they must’ve… you know…”
“Well as charming as this was, I am going to find some other company,” he said, intending to stare down Pansy as he did so but was unable to stop his gaze from falling once again on Potter.
you?” Draco’s tone was more even, but no less wet.
“Till death…” Weasley muttered before rising and exiting much in the same manner his better half had taken.
“And am I meant to do something about it? You know just as well as I do that if I could control some aspect of this, I would.” Draco tried to match the evenness of her voice, but couldn’t help the tinge of frustration that leaked into it.
The first breath of winter had scared most of the students indoors, leaving the couple to roam the grounds without their usual audience. The entourage of students who followed Harry became slightly more jumbled after the news of his and Draco’s relationship spread through the school. Rumours had flown left and right, whispers of love potions and imperius curses as widespread as those of true love’s kiss. Gaggles of their peers hoped to observe the two boys, to see for themselves which of the tall tales might be true, but were often disappointed. The fact was that Draco and Harry were boring.
“So? What happened!” Harry cried as soon as the doors shut. “C’mon Hermione, I know you’re dying to say how you figured it out.”
“Something about ‘to love and to cherish, till death do us part’ or an iteration like it. It’s part of a longer set, but honestly I couldn’t be bothered with the whole thing; muggle weddings are disgustingly soppy.”
“Sure mate, we’ll hold off till this tosser’s up too,” Ron said, gesturing to Harry. “Speaking of, you ready? We’ve got about an hour before Pomfrey usually checks to see if we’ve come in, so we should get started.”
“The last thing you remember is touching him, just before Gr- Hermione,” Pansy corrected when Weasley shot her a look, “got there?”
He watched as she ran though several diagnostic spells before uttering the one he had watched the day of the potions incident.
Pomfrey had long since cancelled the spell that showed Draco’s magical core, but Draco felt as if he could still sense where Harry was tied to him. Tethered.
“Draco,” McGonagall started once they were alone, “I want you to know that while this may feel like you are being asked, or that you are expected to do this- I assure you that is not the case. Particularly, if you do decide not to go through with this, no one will be upset. Harry…” she took a shuddering breath, losing the composure that had been holding her upright.
Harry knew with how high up off the pitch they were that he would have no chance to save Draco from the fall. They had left their wands on the ground after Draco tried to charm Harry’s broom slower, and he couldn’t believe how stupid they had been.
Granger gasped, leaping up from her chair.
“Sorry, sorry, not the time. My best guess is that you have to start with an appeal to death, state your status as his tether, and that nothing
, Draco thought, trying to reign in his desire to continue his chant of expletives.
, as it were, when it comes to you.” Draco peeked between his fingers, endlessly frustrated that Harry appeared to have no idea what he meant. “Potter, when you collapsed, I thought my heart was the one in danger of stopping.”
“I bet I know who,” was Pansy’s cackled response, already waving him off.
Draco wished he had asked something else. Anything else. Harry, unaware of this, continued.
“Harry Potter you did not hex a bunch of kids for checking on you!” Draco crowed, laughing harder as Harry tried to push him off his lap.
“I cannot say I’m surprised at you two,” she said, shooting a dark look at Ron and Hermione, “but Mister Malfoy- could you really not wait until tomorrow?”
Her voice was steady enough that Draco risked looking up. While there was a suspicious sheen to her eyes, there was also kindness, and he wasn’t sure which felt worse.
Weasley sighed and stood up.
“Wassit about Malfoy? Has the ferret gone and done something?” Ron asked, possibly a little too hopefully. He had not reached quite the same level of truce with the Slytherin as Harry had.
“Mister Malfoy, would you mind if I did a few tests on you as well? Seeing as your proximity is a factor in this, it might tell us more about what exactly is happening.”
“C’mon, it’s not like you’re doing much right now,” wheedled Finnegan.
Once they entered the hospital wing Draco realized with some trepidation that this was the first time he had been in here since Harry had sliced him open. The lump that formed in his throat as he recalled the way Harry had apologized for that incident threatened to choke him. It wasn’t that Draco was oblivious to his feelings, truly. He had known prior to this moment that the way he heated around Potter had nothing to do with anger, and that it hadn’t for some time. It wasn’t until this incident, however, that realized that the feelings were more than small admiration culminating in an embarrassing crush- something he shared with half the wizarding world. No, the stinging in his eyes as he laid Harry down on the crisp white bed suggested the feelings were something rather deep.
On the other, he was right that Harry deserved better.
Flitwick seemed all too happy to disregard how close the pair had been to being late once he learned Harry had been having his glasses updated. The suggestion had been his own after he happened to overhear Ms. Granger complaining that Harry seemed to need to have the instructions on the board right in front of him in order to follow them. The complaints Severus had in staff meetings all seemed to click in place at this comment- no wonder the boy had so much trouble. Still it was something of an embarrassment to the faculty to have not noticed that Harry, along with several other students who had grown up in the muggle world, did not know about sight charms and were operating at a significant disadvantage because of it.
As Malfoy danced with his cousin, an uncoordinated mess--were both of them trying to lead?--that they still somehow managed to look graceful, Harry felt a pit in his stomach as he came upon a realization.
"Oh, dear," was all he said, before rushing off to do Merlin knows what.
They swam up until they could see the bow of the Durmstrang ship before turning around. Draco didn't know why he had been so apprehensive about doing this, it was so much better than staying in the pool (even if it was charmed to measure a couple hundred meters in distance, it didn't come with the same excitement and life that the lake did).
"She can't slack on her studies even if it's her job to play the dumb American here," Andy said, "The Oracles think that something bad is coming, and we all need to be prepared. That's why your mother called. She wants you to spend the summer at Sirenum scopoli, and attend St. Achelous' next year. It's expected sirens worldwide will end up sheltering there, some have already left for the islands."
Had he been in any other setting, he might be mortified at their childish behavior. Instead, it was something he had come to depend upon, as steadfast as gravity or Her love. He didn't have to worry about appearances or a reputation or anything of the like here. He could be anyone he wanted to be. Most importantly, himself.
"Nightingales were feared the most by sailors, as they couldn't be spotted at night. They couldn't sleep easy if they knew they had crossed a siren, and even worse, days would go by with no event. Then, when they finally felt safe, Nightingales would enact their revenge, and She would drag them to the very pits of Hell itself."
"The gossip in this place is intense!"
When Draco's consciousness reentered the conversation, it had been picked up by Pansy, who had been chattering excitedly with Granger about potential dates to the dance. In the past, he'd probably have asked Pansy to go with him, a politically safe choice. There were friends, and complimented each other well.
Cassie cursed to herself as she accidentally heated her tea to its boiling point. It was surprising how no teacher had yet to overhear her cursing like a sailor, even with the sounds of dragons roaring in the forefront.
Moody grimaced, sending a hex in her direction, and--arm still outstretched--Cassie flicked her wrist. The hex bounced right off of her.
He had already made a pact with himself this year to not try and start anything with Potter, or anyone else, for that matter. He didn't need to draw unnecessary attention to himself, it could only bring trouble. Especially when it concerned the Gryffindor trio, whose curiosity could kill quite a few herds of cats. Not even their nine lives could save them at that point.
Cassie didn't raise her hand this time, and Draco tried his best to not tense up in his seat. No other student provided an answer. Moody did not seem to care too much, ready to answer his own question.
"You gonna tell me what it is you find so terrifying?"
"Hurt him, or me?" he scoffed.
Yes, Draco had enjoyed his peace and quiet. He'd almost forgotten how little volume control Cassiopeia possessed.
Cassiopeia hummed, and the reporter's jaw slammed shut with an unnerving clatter. "If you write anything in your little paper about anything regarding my family, you will be unable to resist taking a dip in the lake. Doesn't that sound nice, going for a swim? Letting the water overtake you? You will forget this conversation, lest your lungs run out of air. A shame, how they won't find your body. Isn't that right, dear?"
"Cassie is sweet, I don't know how many times I have to tell you," Hermione contributed, albeit looking grateful the conversation was beginning to take a turn.
Cassie sat in the chair next to him, followed by Andrew next to her, and Corey on the end. The room was silent. No nervousness. No excitement. Simply silent.
"You will find," Umbridge spoke with a syrupy voice, "that the next siren to use their Song against me will come to regret it. If you care for your fellow students, you will learn to behave."
He almost wanted to laugh at Snape's theatrics, barely reigning it in as the Ministry official analyzed them both. The potions professor rested the mug on the edge of his knee, looking towards the ceiling in defeat.
?" Potter looked ready to piss himself.
The three sirens stood at alert, even when no danger presented itself after a moment's silence. They glanced wearily in the direction of the supposed source of the noise before Corey resumed his tirade.
The voice that answered made Draco's blood run cold.
The portrait swung open, and he broke out of his friends' supporting grasps to rush to the toilet and empty the contents of his stomach. Andrew stood at the portrait's entrance, stance wide and arms stretched between the open door and the wall, as though he were trying to block someone from entering. Draco rested his cheek on the cool porcelain, observing the protective stance. If She couldn't protect them, then how could Andrew? They weren't even near a body of water.
He shrunk in his seat, for once loathing the attention. "Cassie, a little help here?"
There was a sharp knock on the door. He ignored it, knowing that Corey would come in through the bath and therefore was not locked out of his own room. Plus, Corey knew better than to come back earlier than he had promised Draco, well aware of the guest he was having over.
He hummed in annoyance of having last-minute plans sprung on him. "Very well, but if she finds anything incriminating it's on you to do the damage control."
"I'm not taking it," he whispered.
The most senior Oracle, Pythia, reached forth with steady hands, scoping up the feathers in cradled palms. She studied them for only a second before presenting her observations to her colleagues.
Once seated, he pressed into her side for stability. "Knowing and actually seeing are two very different things. They're unsettling."
"Everything is ready," McGonagall told the headmaster, who nodded in acknowledgement.
That actually sounded quite interesting. He was determined to help brew the next batch. "Any particular reason why Cassie is dead to the world?"
"You're not gonna die, you're gonna be okay," Harry tried to reassure his panicking boyfriend, to no avail. Hands raised in surrender he tried to get close to Draco once more, when someone fisted the back of his shirt to yank him away.
"Harry, Malfoy's ill, we've been over this."
Ron's eyes widened. "Oh! That's right, you wouldn't- Well, with Pure-blood families, it's expected that the Heir will continue on the family bloodline. Malfoy's the Heir in his family, so it would be expected he'd marry a witch, but since he's ill that expectation for him gets waived. The Lord can pick a distant relative instead as the Heir... Wait, I wonder about that cousin of his, the American? Maybe she qualifies..."
"I don't know why, but I didn't think that we'd have to deal with him as a threat just yet." His throat felt tight, and when he swallowed to dislodge the imaginary knot the sharp pain only got worse. "I know the war's already here, I know that-"
If there were any doubts in Draco's mind that he was attracted to blokes, Andrew definitely settled those.
Now he had both Andrew and Draco breathing down his neck to run after her. It was all too familiar to him, their fierce love for someone stuck in an impossible situation.
He let Corey link their fingers together and closed his eyes. Then he wouldn't have to look at him any different than before.
Having re-watched the memory himself, there was one question still rattling about in his brain. One that Kingsley had asked, one he was not able to answer for them or himself.
His eyes fell to Severus' hands. They were clutching his knees, knuckles bone-white as his fingers dug into black robes. Robes being clenched so tightly that Draco was certain the fabric would tear under the pressure, straining and stretching until it could handle the tension no longer.
"Would you want to go with me?" Nice, Draco, very proper.
How the hell was he going to make it through the school year if his first day back he could barely focus?
"There's two Slytherins making their way over here."
Andrew turned to her in curiosity. "Since when do you say 'snog?'"
Draco was laying on the floor in Severus' office, struggling to catch his breath and stop himself from laughing hysterically. Alas, anytime his laughter subsided and air finally returned to his lungs, he'd make eye contact with either Cassie or his godfather, and it would start up once more.
"I'm Corey. Draco's potential mate," Corey introduced, looking lost as to how they had gotten here.
Corey stood. "Yeah, thanks. I always forget that you're the voice of reason in the pod."
"I'm so sorry for what I must do."
She certainly knew how to play the cards she'd been dealt. Draco certainly never wanted to be on the receiving end of her manipulated attacks.
TW: lots of swearing at the end
He smirked, getting closer until one foot was between Draco's, the warmth of his breath tickling his face. "Because right now, you
He wiped furiously at his tears, hummed a chopped tone that gave Harry his agency back. It was a miracle he didn't turn and bolt the instant he was back in control.
then you are wasting your time!"
"Why doesn't it help stabilize it?" Harry asked.
Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Vince, and Hermione Granger sat with him around a library table, discussing the Potions practical coming up and the ridiculously lengthy essay they had to complete for History of Magic.
(See the end of the chapter for
Umbridge leveled a cold stare at Cassie, as though she were the one to blame for the gross indecency.
Draco started trembling from where he was pressed against Harry, but it was impossible to tell if it was out of fear or something else since he couldn't see Draco's face from where it was pressed into the crook of his shoulder. The water buzzed with anticipation--despite there being not even a ripple on the lake's surface--and Harry realized that this was how the sirens communicated with Her; he had inherited the ability to understand Her from the piece of Draco's magic that now lived within him.
"My cousin was just taking me to the hospital wing," Cassie replied, already well-informed on who they were dealing with.
He sucked in a breath as he collected his bearings. Focused on following Andrew's steady directions.
Draco's heart was pounding, all he could hear was the rush of his own blood in his ears. He wished he had his wand. He wished he wasn't frozen in place and paralyzed like a coward from his own fear.
The fire made his eyelids warm and heavy. Closing them was almost painful from the heat yet was nothing but a pleasant sensation. He leaned into it, caressed by the blazing glow and soft crackling of the logs, accented by the occasional turning of the page per Cassie.
It was a shock that Cassie hadn't joined in on their plot. Her only input on the situation had been: "Draco has the right to have some input, it's his stupid soul."
"I think I like blokes," he muttered.
this isn't how I planned it but I have no control over this plot,, this fic is driving itself babey
"Cassie?" he cried.
Draco gasped awake, falling from the bed onto the stone floor. He scrambled to find purchase before someone was grabbing at his shoulders and he had to kick them away. He turned his head and began to violently retch, his breath stolen from him as bile burned his throat. There was shouting, more hands grabbing at him, and Draco vomited.
Class revision sucked Harry’s attention away from Malfoy’s profile, and any time it seemed to draw him in again Hermione's sharp elbow to his side quickly brought him back to the task at hand. It turned out that returning for NEWTS was rather interesting.
Draco knew he fit at least one of those. The others went against all of his instincts. Maybe that was part of why Potter standing up, however indirectly, for Pansy had shocked him so much. It shouldn’t have, because if there was one thing Harry was, it was foolishly noble.
McGonagall raised a hand to her eyes, pressing lightly.
Harry waited to see if Draco had worn himself out before saying, “I had you this time, plus I got to be asleep for a lot of the scary bits. Essentially a luxury for me.”
“Say it again?”
The worst, though, was when Pansy joined them.
, and nothing felt better than being reminded of that.
Draco recalls that sixth year had also seen Potter with an exceptional potions performance, but he never seemed to be following instructions then, not as he does now.
Pansy flicked her eyes to the unconscious boy beside them, and then back to Draco.
“Can you tell me who you mean by them?” Harry whispers, once Draco seems to have caught his breath.
when she had been quite clear that she wouldn’t tolerate being swept into more of Draco’s issues.
“You’re telling me this wasn’t
Potter.
Sure, he and Potter had forged something of a correspondence over the summer, but that was largely at the insistence of his mother. At least, as far as he had told Pansy. The initial letter had been her doing at any rate, penned under Narcissa’s careful watch Draco expressed his family’s deep gratitude at Potter’s testimonies, and his mother’s wish for him to come to tea.
“Better?” Madam Pomfrey asked, swishing her wand in a quick diagnostic charm. “Your heart rate seems to indicate so.”
, that this didn’t matter.
“Alright, I’m going to do the core test as well, are you ready?” Poppy’s voice brought Minerva out of her reverie just in time to see her wand swish.
love him.
Draco blushed to the roots of his hair.
“Pansy left out the bit where she threatened-“
Weasley woke as she was tearing out.
Looking around he found the sleeping forms of Granger, Weasley, and most surprisingly, Pansy. They were huddled together in a triangle, obviously having fallen asleep while talking. There was an empty chair next to them, which Draco supposed he must have been in originally.
. It’s from a diary entry of a muggle who was handfasted to a wizard, who made a miraculous recovery- that’s mostly what this whole thing is about, miraculous recoveries, mostly due to bonds, I had started looking at it because some people have theorized that such accounts are how we found treatments for dragon pox and some others, but-“ She took a breath when Weasley put a hand to her back.
Draco hardly realized that he had shot out to catch Potter until the full brunt of warm weight was on him. Draco shifted his arms, trying to maneuver Harry into an easier hold. By the time he had his head supported, Granger and Weasley had rushed over, the latter looking at his best friend in Malfoy’s arms with an unusual expression on his face.
“I know,” she replied.
“Alright Mr. Potter, this should do the trick,” the woman said, handing over his glasses. “Now seeing as the spell Ms. Granger placed on them was unusually enthusiastic, it’s understandable that you are out of practice at maintaining the prescription yourself, but so long as you re-apply the charm I’ve taught you every year or so these should adjust as your eyes do.”
“He had to shout at Death?” Ron asked, suddenly seeming unsure of himself.
“Better now,” Harry said, grinning back. “What happened? I remember- Oh fuck Draco! Are you okay? You didn’t get hurt from the fall, did you?”
“I cannot say anything conclusive. I know Mr. Potter has expressed a desire for open communication, but until he regains consciousness I do not feel comfortable conjecturing any further. Now, if one of you could stay here with him while I find Minerva…” Madam Pomfrey took one last sweeping look at Harry before turning out of the infirmary.
what Death could do.
“I understand, quite a bit more than you might think. However, I think he would not wish for you to put yourself in harm’s way for him.”
“I’m just sayin mate, I don’t think it’s the freckles if you think he’s pretty. I think it’s probably more to do with the fact that you’ve always been kinda arse over tits for him and finally have something to project it on to now that he’s not such a wanker.”
It was too much. Draco lasted a scant few minutes longer, eyes unseeing as they trained on the quill hanging limply in his hand. The sound of Potter’s laughter as Pansy explained how they were caught by Snape washed over him. He stood from their table and mumbled some excuse about finding a book before tearing out of the common room.
That was not the outburst Hermione had been expecting.
“Also, of course, you can’t say a bloody word about anything in the hospital wing, right? Harry’d be pissed if something got out.”
Sure, it’s only been a few weeks, but usually between Potter, Longbottom, and Finnegan there were already two exploded cauldrons, and several class-long lectures from Granger over potions that were seconds from disaster.
Draco shook his head. Pomfrey sighed.
, Draco thought absently.
“But other people know too! Does that mean…?”
It made something warm and horrible grow in his chest whenever he watched them.
The gesture seemed to break the dam, and Hermione rushed forwards as well, practically plastering herself over Harry.
Likely the effect of a Siren Song, Hermione had told him. Which had thrown him for quite the loop.
He hummed an affirmative.
"That doesn't answer my question about Andrew."
Heart racing in his chest, Draco yanked Harry by the front of his robes all the way into his space, spinning them as to pin Harry firm against the wall. The fire that ran through his blood was one of the likes he had never before felt, possessing him as he pressed their lips together in a clash of teeth and tongue. Draco tasted blood, unsure of whose it was, but pressed on, Harry returning the effort just as passionately.
Severus stormed in, his eyes ablaze. "Which one of you was foolish enough to be seen by Potter?"
Harry would have to talk to him. Talking. To Draco Malfoy.
, Mr. Potter would be better equipped to not reveal your secret."
In a baffling synchronization, Severus and Cassie blurted out, "Absolutely not!"
"It was self-defense! Most of them were Death Eaters!"
Andrew put a hand on his shoulder, and Draco clenched his eyes shut, as if it would prevent him from hearing what was about to be shared.
"Draco, listen to me." She grabbed his wrist, pulling at it to bring him back to the moment. "You need to root your magic back to your body, you need to let go of mine."
"No. Absolutely not, not after what he did. It's siding with the Light that will be taking a calculated risk, or choosing to side with neither, stay our own faction aligned with neither side."
As Draco's godfather and surrogate healer at Hogwarts--especially when you considered how he bore witness to the horror that was Draco's siren transformation last year--he'd only find it unpleasant if Draco weren't sickly and possibly dying.
Andrew hopped down from where he'd been lounging on the pool ledge to grab a rose-colored potion. He knelt down behind Draco, using a clean scrap of gauze to apply it to the established scales on the back of his neck. While the anti-itch potion was clear in color and smelled strongly of winterbloom and chamomile, the conditioner for his scales smelled like freshwater algae and came with a cool burning sensation.
"How are you certain this won't kill us?" he asked once more, needing to hear some type of reassurance.
"I, uh- Well, I fancy blokes. Women, too, but... That's not the big secret, really. I'm..." Merlin, it was hot in here. He pulled on the collar of his shirt. "You know Andrew?"
sentient enough to be capable of such a thing.
"Actually, can we stick together? I feel like I'll get lost in here otherwise, parting walls or not."
Even with the aid of the potion, the itching felt like being bitten by thousands of fire ants. Severus had begun brewing a numbing draught after dinner but it was unlikely to be finished for another hour.
Harry just hadn't anticipated Draco continuing to surprise him, although this likely was far from the last time that he would. The pure awe that struck him as he learned more and more about the sirens--now allowed to know every secret, way more than Hermione, thanks to his newfound status as mated--it would never get old.
Draco refused to admit that he saw where his cousin was coming from. There was a logic in siding with the rest of the magical creatures--which was, in fact, what they were still considered by the Ministry--and ensuring better chances for their survival (even if it was only for the duration of this war). Wizardkind didn't like them, that hadn't changed, so what difference did it bloody make?
"Leaving so soon?"
Severus interrupted, "I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware you had gone and trained extensively as a Healer? Tell me, who was it you studied under at St. Mungo's?"
Ron elbowed his side, and he was broken from his trance. Hermione was trembling like a leaf as she cried, Ginny shushing her and wrapping an arm around her in comfort. She had been his friend. He hadn't even gotten the same honor.
He turned to the two sirens. "The walls are charmed to part for magical creatures, yourselves included. The Champions will enter the maze at staggered intervals with the goal being to reach the Triwizard Cup at the center of the maze. There are many dangers that lie inside to deter them, but Miss Prince has assured me that she has amply prepared you both should you find yourselves in trouble."
"Also, I think we should be friends with Hermione Granger. I quite like her, even if her two best friends are possibly the most empty-headed wizards this side of the sea. The other Slytherins weren't even surprised to see me talking to her! Pansy said something about 'Americans having such loose morals,' and I couldn't even care to try and argue her point."
"Here, boy." He held it out for Draco, who sat up only because of the promised relief in front of him. He took it without having to exercise any cognitive function, at this point used to taking potions by rote.
The air shifted as someone moved forward, right next to where Andrew was kneeling.
"Harry-" Andrew interjected, "remember the talk we had? About siren mating traditions?"
"Anything, anything!"
No one questioned their leave of absence, and for once Draco didn't mind the pity-filled glances some of his housemates directed in his direction. He couldn't think of any other excuse for this once-in-a-lifetime sort of experience.
"What does he possibly want at this hour? Couldn't he have waited until breakfast?" Draco asked.
Andrew left, Corey taking his spot not a moment later. Draco, head leaned against the tile wall, turned his eyes to the drain. He couldn't face him. Even if Corey was nice and a siren and easy on the eyes, Draco would never be able to feel the same way as him. He hadn't even gone farther than holding hands with him, and yet-
Her tail was skinned. Bloody
would be the better word, as Harry couldn't even begin to follow it.
Andrew plopped down next to the professor, smirking at the disgruntled look he received for jostling the older man before turning to Harry.
"You don't?" Draco interrupted, genuinely laughing this time.
Cassie? He dared not shout, could hear that they weren't alone, muffled voices of confusion in the distance.
It had been three days since the Second Task, and everyone sat in the Hall seemed groggy this Monday morning, with the exception of Hermione of course. Leave it to her to be excited for a full day of classes.
The toad was turning red enough to match her ostentatious frock. Draco imagined she was not too far off from literal steam coming out of her ears.
The impatient know-it-all beat him to it. "You have a crush on Andrew, yes?"
There was a toad-like woman dressed in all pink stood at the common room entrance that watched them like a hawk as they took their seats. His instincts screamed that she couldn't be trusted. Her frilly pink exterior was doing her no favors either.
Moody spoke first. "Miss Prince."
"Then you understand he's in no condition to be involved with the Second Task? Dragging him up here at this ungodly hour is already taxing enough on his frail health. If you want to try justifying risking my cousin's life for some
Cassie hummed, a noise that could be interpreted as one of mild inconvenience, before she returned to the scroll in front of her.
"Mate, we're going to be late for Charms, and I'm going to kill you if you're not there to be my partner for today's practical. You can stalk your boyfriend around the castle later, we need to get to class."
"What if our magical cores are the same color?"
He laid down onto the floor, forcing his shoulders to relax and his breathing to even out. The lock clicked open, followed silently by the door. He listened as two pairs of footsteps entered, the first more hesitant than the second.
Although, he wasn't sure how much he could mentally brace himself for his imminent death.
When he awoke much later in the day, he was no longer on the floor, but in his own bed. There was a plate of food and a cup of tea on his nightstand--still warm, likely charmed to do so--and a piece of parchment atop a few of his school books. As he scarfed down the much needed meal, the parchment revealed itself to be his list of assignments to complete for the day.
He nodded, curt and quick, and Cassie yanked him by his arm to stop, keeping him in a death grip so he couldn't escape. He refused to meet her eyes.
It prompted him to bring one of his hands up to his face for closer inspection. He hadn't noticed until now, but he had changed to the new environment as well. Not unusual, as sirens had to be quick to adapt as they traveled through the oceans. He, too, had gained a significant amount of color, more so than he ever had in his entire life. Who knew all it took was a bit of Mediterranean sun for him to look like he didn't spend all of his years hidden in the shadows?
"Hey, how we feeling?" Andrew spoke with a soft conviction that was only reassuring.
A true Nightingale.
Andrew must've read something on his face, and stopped Draco from forcibly waking his cousin up while he was still pondering it.
She hugged him one last time as the train blew the final whistle. It was a sight to behold, an improper gesture that any sensible witch or wizard would never guess would be seen within their lifetime. An outwardly display of affection by a pure-blood family, and the Malfoys, at that. Had more people been actively watching the group amidst all the chaos of parents and students doing a last-minute shuffle before departure, perhaps the momentous act would've made the gossip section of the next day's paper.
"It's the miracle child in Gryffindor. The one you have an obsession with," she answered.
A blast of sparks went up not long after the Task commenced. It was Delacour, stunned and beginning to be consumed by vines. He hummed a low tune and they released her, and cast a silent levitation charm before sending her on her way, the maze automatically parting and guiding her back to the entrance.
Pitch-black and predatory, Draco's eyes served as a firm reminder of how deadly he could be. Just like the first time he saw him like this, Harry felt anything but afraid. He bit back a groan, and Draco leaned in, hot breath ghosting over the shell of his ear.
"Oi!" Draco groaned.
A few of the guards were waiting for him, and he made quick work of removing the cloak.
"My guess is severe brain injury, in which case, there would be nothing on your mind-"
Lucius gulped, face managing to grow even paler. "He, well, has stepped out for a moment. Had something to attend to and, well... He'll be gone for the rest of the morning. I wished to speak with you, privately."
He shook his head. "I don't know what you're talking about."
"You're certain that something is off with Professor Moody?" he asked them once more.
Draco emptied the contents of his stomach all over the bathroom floor, not even making it to the toilet in time. He sobbed, coughing and gagging on the lingering bile in his throat and mouth, and Cassie shushed him as she removed his soiled robes and moved him into the shower stall. He wailed like his soul was trying to escape him, break free of this prison of a body and go somewhere where it would never undergo torment ever again.
It was in between moments of darkness that it was calm. The drowning boy did not scream, there was no thrashing of water or loud voices arguing. There was a soft glowing light. It felt nice, like the bright sun being muted by a passing cloud.
