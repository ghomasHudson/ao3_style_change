The inflection she used on that particular word was unmissable, but the reason behind it had Harry confused.  "Yes," he answered, though it came out as more of a question. "Slughorn wants two feet on the reactive properties of Moonstone by the end of next week – thought I'd get a head start on it."
Harry reached out, quite unable to keep the broad grin off his face.  He took the book as eagerly as good manners would allow and scanned the cover with speed.  "It's a book on healing."
"Fine.  But I've also had boyfriends.  And as far as both you and I know, Draco never has, so just leave it, please?"
Pansy snorted derisively.  "Please, that look hasn't worked on me since we were eight.  It's hard to be scared by that scowl when I've seen it smeared with your mother's lipstick."
As she left, Harry began mentally planning a list of all the ways he was going to make his best friend pay for embroiling him in this mess. "You owe me big time," he said, turning to glare at Ron.
in Azkaban, do they."  Draco banished that sobering thought immediately, and added, "I have had a few offers of threesomes though."
"I'm fine," Draco replied shortly.  Then, seeing his mother's expression, he added, "Honestly.  I just didn't sleep much last night."
Obviously he hadn't said it as quietly as he thought, because Pansy grinned back at him.  "Oh, I don't know," she said lightly.  "It's better than I expected."
"Nothing." Harry hadn't realised how long he'd been staring till then, and gave his head a little shake to clear his thoughts. "You're just not who I expected at all."
Draco stepped back, a look of complete horror on his face.  "Please tell me I'm not helping you chose underwear to shag the Weasel in?"  Then, before Pansy has chance to answer, his expression quickly changes to one of confusion.  "Hang on, does that mean that Weasley isn't eating over at Theo's tonight?"
"Thanks."  Harry unscrewed his bottle and took a deep swig.  "I hear Zabini's coming home for a visit," he said finally.  "You must be looking forward to that."
"Semantics."  Potter gave a dismissive wave of his hand and then continued to watch Weasley manhandle Draco's best friend.
Apparently not understanding the reference, Pansy ignored the interruption. "He doesn't trust people very easily, so you'll have to…although, I think
Wishing, for the first time, that he'd taken Hermione's advice and actually talked to his surrogate parents beforehand, Harry reached for Draco's hand and squeezed gently.  Draco squeezed back, much to Harry's relief, and turned to smile at him.
"Well, the sooner you disillusion her, the better for all," Pansy said briskly.  "Now, tell me how you left things with Potter?"
It really isn't fine, and they both know that, but Harry wants it to be – so badly. The problem is that things are so messed up that he doesn't know what fine looks like anymore. He does know that it isn't Draco twirling Astoria Greengrass around the dance floor with laughter in his eyes, though.
"I haven't."  Harry got to his feet, and ran one hand through his hair.  "He's still in the hallway like always, I just...shut the curtains."
"Malfoy," Harry said in acknowledgment and followed it up with a brief nod.  He kept his tone as neutral as he could manage, and was pleased to hear not the slightest hint of a slur.
Despite the somewhat maudlin thoughts overwhelming Draco, he couldn't help but smile just a little – Pansy really had no idea when to shut up.  "What's Millicent done now?" he asked, hoping this would be hint enough to rein Pansy's tongue in.
Malfoy's expression was unbearably smug. "You're a sensible woman, Granger. I always knew you were."
"Nothing?"  Ron shook his head and crammed another bite of sausage in his mouth.  "You've been grinning like an idiot for the last three days, and you just smiled at Malfoy.
"He'll be down in a minute."  Hermione seemed oblivious to Draco's inner turmoil.  "He's just getting changed."
"You're giving me your memories?"  Harry's eyes widened noticeably behind his glasses as he spoke. He reached out to take the case, his fingers curling around the leather, brushing Draco's as they did so.
"It's fine." Malfoy gave another vague wave of his hand and settled his glasses back in place. "I was done anyway."
"I thought we could eat in the Gardens," Draco suggested as Harry shrugged off his work robes.  "It's lovely outside; it'd be a shame to sit indoors."
"I don't know why you don't say something about them."  Never suppressed for long, Pansy nodded at the empty beds.  "It must be depressing as hell looking at them every day."
"Ron?" Harry was a little concerned. He was pretty certain this wasn't some big homophobic freak out, but he wanted to make sure.
"She's always busy with bloody Malfoy." Ron began viciously shredding the serviette in his hand. "That git's still ruining my life, even now."
Pansy gave up all attempts at holding in her laughter now.  "Oh, Merlin, that's priceless.  I have to see those."
Draco didn't deny it.  He wasn't about to admit the truth, though.  If Pansy found out he'd actually owled the editor asking for the original, well, he'd never hear the end of it.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but before the words could leave his lips a soft moan of "oh Ron," from the next bed over, followed by some inaudible but nonetheless husky sounding speech from his best friend made it impossible for him to concentrate.  If for no other reason that the look of abject horror on Malfoy's face.
Harry smiled at that. "I don't think age has anything to do with it. It's just what good friends do for each other."
Draco found himself on the receiving end of a particularly sharp elbow dig – in the process of squirming away from it, he ended up wearing a large portion of his own drink.    "Bloody hell, Potter."  He began dabbing futilely at sodden wool of his jumper.  "I'm soaking wet now."
Harry perches on the edge of the desk, his fingers gripping the wood tightly for balance.  "But he doesn't want me, so it doesn't matter."
Hermione gives Harry a non-too-subtle glance, and even Ron is glaring.  Draco, thankfully, remains oblivious.
Blaise had slid off his stool by now and was making his way over to the window, glass still in hand.  "It all looks very romantic out there.  Can I take this as a sign that you're finally going to talk to Harry about things?"
A loud slamming door shattered the silence of the Slytherin dungeons.  It caused barely a raised eyebrow, such was that house's immunity to dramatics – and given some notable residents of said dungeon, both past and present, this was hardly to be wondered at.
Draco ran his eye around the cosy room, filled to the brim with family, friends, and gaudy Christmas decoration.  Ron was right, it really wasn't his scene.  But for the first time, Draco found himself wishing that it was.
Ron let out a whistle as he took in his surroundings.  "This is a bit fancy, mate. That flat of yours'd fit in here a hundred times over."
“Is he really?”  Malfoy looked at him curiously and Harry tried his hardest not to squirm under the gaze.
Each pairing is then handed a pack of cards, full of questions, topic suggestions, all designed to help them know their partner.  Harry almost laughs out loud at that.  If there's one thing he doesn't lack when it comes to Draco Malfoy, it's knowledge.  After seven years at Hogwarts – eight, if you count that aborted seventh year – and another six months in the Auror Academy, he's pretty sure his knowledge of Malfoy is second only to his parents.
Potter let out a throaty chuckle at this and gazed down at Draco with eyes that seemed as dark as the Black Lake.  "You're amazing," he murmured, so softly that Draco wasn't even sure he'd heard right.  But before he could ask Potter to clarify, Potter's mouth was busy elsewhere.
“Okay, fine,” Harry answered huffily.  “I’ll do it.  But you two are helping.”  He paused here and glared meaningfully at his two companions.  “And by helping, I don’t mean hovering round the kitchen like a dog begging for scraps, or peering over my shoulder giving a running commentary like you’re the
"I'm sorry," he blurted out suddenly.  He knew the words weren't enough, but he couldn't keep them inside any longer.
“I don’t see why that’s put you in such a bad mood,” Harry interjected, ignoring the glares that were passing across the room.  “I bet your mum could do with a break, instead of running round after everyone else.”
Draco glanced down and scowled at his offending fingers, but before he could rebut Pansy's accusations, he saw she had all the evidence she needed right there in her hands.  "That's private," he snapped, and reached out to snag the letter from Pansy's hands.
Upon leaving the library, and Malfoy, Harry had felt a wave of relief sweep over him.  He hadn't realised just how much keeping that particular secret had been weighing him down.  Just saying the words out loud felt liberating.
Draco could only hope that Harry had missed the rather overemphasis Blaise put on those last words.  Pansy clearly hadn't, if her sniggering was anything to go by.  And the wink that Blaise gave as he stopped into the Floo could hardly be misunderstood either.  But Harry didn’t look anything other than happy when Draco turned back to him, so he Transfigured a couple of chipped mugs into champagne flutes and decided to go with the flow.
A loud scrape followed as Potter selected his seat.  Barely managing to suppress a wince, Draco returned his focus to Professor Vector's latest torture method, which was cunningly disguised as his Arithmancy homework.
"Sounds like a plan to me," Harry agreed.  He pushed his chair back from the table and got to his feet.
Somehow Harry didn't mind the words coming from him.  If anything, they meant more, considering who they'd both once been.  He didn't know what to say in return though, so instead of ruining the moment, he leant back and closed his eyes, and enjoyed the sensation.
Harry’s stomach dropped.  “Malfoy?” he asked flatly.  Of course the git couldn’t keep his trap shut.
Harry's heart felt like it stopped for just a fraction of a second as he realised just who he'd run – quite literally – into.  Never one to miss an opportunity, he dived right in.  "Malfoy," he acknowledged as casually as he could mange.  "Do you have a minute?  I want a word."
Given that they're attached, Harry has little choice but to get up as well, and finds himself, once again, stumbling along in Malfoy's way.
"I need to get Draco's present," she explained, matter-of-factly.  "And I can't very well do that when he's tagging along behind me."
Draco pouted but wisely remained silent.  Once Harry left the room, he turned to bid farewell to their visitors also, only to find Hermione watching him speculatively.
It was only brief, a matter of seconds really, before Harry laid his head back against the pillows again, smiling broadly.
He didn't, though.  Instead, he trudged onwards, cursing the Ministry and their bloody stupid statutes.
Harry was a terrible liar.  He knew that without having to be told.  Which, he supposed, should really be a good thing, but right at that moment, Harry could only wish he'd embraced his Slytherin side more.
Harry scrunched his nose up in displeasure.  "Am I done yet?" he asked, a hint of a whine in his tone.
"Fine."  Malfoy spoke through gritted teeth and his expression was not so neutral anymore.  He spun on his heel and strode from the room – after a moment's hesitation, Harry followed him.
“She’s not trying to get pregnant again, is she?” Blaise enquired.  “I thought the Healers told them it was a waste of time.”
He made his way into the living room and was confronted with a rather red-faced Hermione, who appeared to be taking a deep breath in readiness for her next tirade.  At moments like this, Harry understood what Ron had meant when he said that marrying Hermione would be like marrying his own mother.
"He went to his death willingly.  Stood in front of V-Voldemort and let him cast the Killing Curse.  Would you have done that?  Because I know I wouldn't have."
and the doors opened onto a polished hallway.  As he stepped out of the lift and looked both ways, Harry realised they were already inside the flat, and that it was
Ron remained silent for a moment and looked intently at everyone around the table.  Not a moment too soon he nodded in acceptance and Harry let out a breath he had deliberately been holding.
"Never said I didn't care."  Draco reached for the bottle at his side and began refilling his glass.  "Just said I wouldn't object."
“Coming right up.” Hannah scribbled some more on the pad.  “Grab a table; I’ll bring it over when it’s ready.”
What Draco wasn't expecting was to be greeted by the sight of George Weasley answering the door wearing little more than Pansy's skimpy pink robe.
Harry shrugged. "If he does it."   Right now he wasn't allowing himself to think about the future – he couldn't bear to be disappointed a second time.
Harry's stunned. His mouth opens to reply, to demand explanations, but there aren't any words. Ginny's always been able to surprise him, but
It's a phrase Harry hears on an irritatingly regular basis now, and the more often Neville uses it – and at increasingly loud volumes – the more Harry panics that Draco will hear.  Thankfully he's not arrived yet this morning, so doesn't hear Neville's bellow from halfway down the greenhouse.
Their faces were now only inches apart, and Draco could feel the warm puffs of Harry’s breath against his cheeks.  There was something so wonderfully innocent about Harry’s expression while he slept that it caused Draco’s heart to swell.  He raised one hand and carefully brushed the messy hair back of Harry’s forehead, before sliding it down to cradle the side of his face.
At the first touch of Potter's hand on his cock, Draco knew this wouldn't take long.  Potter traced his fingers along the shaft, before wrapping them firmly around it and beginning to stroke.  Draco reached out and hooked one hand around the back of Potter's neck, tugging him in closer for a kiss.  As their lips met, Potter increased the pace of his strokes, and Draco groaned his climax into the kiss.
"Ah, yes," Narcissa replied.  "I ran into her mother in Diagon Alley yesterday.  All she could talk about was her
Something in Draco's tone makes Harry look up.  Which he regrets instantly as he can see Mrs Morrison approaching out of the corner of his eye.
Not wanting to go back to bed – it was almost noon, after all – but not really in the mood for activity either, Harry snagged one last cup of black liquid and headed towards the living room.  His sofa was incredibly comfortable and perfect for lounging purposes.  Plus, it had all the associated memories of the night before – and Draco.
Even Draco was forced to admit the truth of this statement - though secretly he thought that it would have been Ron’s inclusion in the party that pushed his father over the edge.  “You’re probably right,” he agreed reluctantly, before his face brightened.  “I’ll just send one of the house-elves over with dinner for you.”
"Thanks."  Harry turned away as he spoke, but Draco fancied he saw the faintest colour on his cheeks.
Something wriggles delightedly in Harry's stomach, but he's too busy hiding his dirty hands behind his back to pay it much heed.  "So, you think you're back at work for good now?"  Harry really hopes so.  He likes working for Neville, but there's one obvious reason why he'd taken this job.
"Your Aunt Andromeda and I had plans to go out.  Only, I've received an owl from her this morning to say that young Teddy is poorly."
Potter was a revelation.  As far as Draco knew, he had only limited experience with girls, and absolutely none with boys, yet he seemed to know just what to do, where to touch, to make Draco forget all the plans he had of his own.
"And?" If she wasn't eight months pregnant, Harry thinks she would be bouncing on her toes right now.
"Come on." He grabbed half the plates from Draco's pile. "You don't want to test Hermione's patience this evening, trust me."
Unlike Luna’s blushing, Ginny simply grinned.  “I know.”  She stepped into his arms and his hands automatically found her waist – they still fit together well.  “Have fun with Parkinson?”
"Is that why you're marring Astoria?"  The words were out of Harry's mouth before he'd given them any real consideration, but while a large part of him wished he could reel them back in, there was a small part of him glad that he'd brought it up – it would only have festered otherwise.
Blaise snorted softly and tilted his head until it lay atop hers.  “I told you we were wasting our breath.  Draco never takes kindly to advice, and certainly not on the subject of Potter.  Besides, he’s a big boy now, Pans.”
Harry allowed the smallest of smiles to grace his lips at that mental image, before replying, "I don't have the room for a proper bed. You know that."
Blaise frowned at him for a moment, before it cleared into a smile.  "Harry's bi.  I thought you knew that.  I thought
"Don't apologise," Draco replied briskly.  "I'd far rather you be honest with me.  It's not good for my professional reputation if I set you up in a house you don't like, is it?"
Harry spluttered at the outrageous lie, Hermione grinned, and even Malfoy had the grace to look abashed. But he remained firm. "You're just being difficult for the sake of it now. Give me one good reason why you won't stay at Hermione's tonight?"
Draco offered his best friend a two-fingered salute, then got to his feet and followed after Potter as quickly as his surprisingly shaky legs would allow him.
“There’s no point in cooking that much food just for the two of us,” Harry pointed out.  “Not even Ron can eat that much.”
Ginny laughed and Harry knew instantly that his bluff had failed.  Like Hermione, in fact more so, Ginny had always been able to see through him – he suspected it was one of the reasons why their rekindled romance had been so short-lived, and had ended so amicably.
First it's his head on Harry's shoulder.  A shock at first, but Harry makes no comment.  He rather likes it, truth be told.  The fidgeting that follows is not so nice.
Ron gave him a slap on the shoulder.  "It's time for you to get back out there, mate," he said.  "It's been over a year since you and Justin broke up, and obviously you and Malfoy are happy swimming in your Egyptian river."
Harry didn't want to see his friends fight, but there was something almost comforting in its familiarity.  Harry watched them walk away for a moment or two – deciding that staying out of the way was definitely the best course of action.  Only, seconds later he realised his miscalculation because he was left with Malfoy.  Alone.
And as Draco had noticed on more than one occasion that Weasley's eyes fixed significantly lower than Pansy's face, despite his professed dislike, he could attest to the truth of this.
"Work?"  Harry frowns at their joined arms, so close on the table top that it would look almost romantic to a casual observer.  "I figure we just have to make it through the weekend without killing each other.  Then go back on Monday and tell Kettlewell how well we've bonded."
Draco takes a sip of his drink, but when he looks back at Harry, one brow is raised. "Frankly, yes. You never did before."
They're released early.  Which, given that it's a Friday, should be cause for celebration.  But this is definitely not the way Harry saw his weekend going, and he has no idea where they go from here.
A loud bang from the next room diverted them from further conversation.  They lay there in the darkness, each of them reaching under the pillow for his wand.
Harry somehow manages to choke on fresh air and looks wild-eyed at Blaise. Even after three years, he's still not entirely used to their interactions.
When Draco's arms draped over his shoulders and he pressed impossibly close, Harry thought he'd died and gone to heaven.  But Draco's eyes were still closed, and as amazing as this was, Harry wanted, needed him to know who he was with.
"You know, I was thinking," he said slowly, and ignored the sarcastic snort that followed.  "Maybe you'd prefer it if I moved you up into the library?  Phineas Nigellus is already up there, so you'd have some company."
“It’s been December for all of --” Harry glanced at his watch, “eight hours.  You’ll be sick of that album by the end of the day, never mind the month.”
The silent oaths increased exponentially when Blaise's grinning face appeared over the side of the worktop.  "All right, Draco?"
It was all Harry could do not to choke on his beer in response. And it took even more willpower not to lean over the table and choke his friend, who was currently shooting him meaningful looks.
The red velvet came next and Harry was equally as enamoured.  It seemed anything chocolate based was a winner for them.  Draco’s tongue made another appearance as he cleaned red crumbs from his lips, and Harry struggled to convince himself it was the cake that time.
was gone.  He smiled winningly at the grey-haired witch behind the counter, placed his order, and then breathed a sigh of relief when his favourite dish was forthcoming.  Quickly, he grabbed to containers off the counter, feeling the heat of the well-placed Warming Charm, and passed several coins over.
Despite some prejudiced opinion to the contrary, Harry Potter wasn't stupid. He even had the NEWT results to prove it. But he was also human, and, as such, was prone to the odd schoolboy error. Like forgetting to lock the Floo behind him that evening.
“It’s not that ridiculous,” Ron said thoughtfully.  “Part of the wedding tradition, isn’t it? Best man and bridesmaid getting together.”
"Yes, Potter." Malfoy's look was still too intense for Harry's comfort. "Go and see your friends. It's time to end this hermit-like existence, and when you come home tomorrow, I promise you won't even recognise this place."
"We need to start getting you ready," Hermione said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Even without Hermione's words, Harry was fairly sure that the smile on Malfoy's face now would have done the trick. "Really? And you don't mind?"
Which was certainly true, however much Draco refrained from agreeing. Pansy snickered, but really that was restraint coming from her.
It wasn't the best kiss Harry had ever had – it was a little clumsy, with too much pressure and the odd scrape of teeth, but there was also of the hot, slick slide of Draco's tongue against his that set a fire burning in the pit of Harry's stomach, and his fists gripped tight to the front o Draco's robes as if he never intended for him to leave.
The robe makers was like no other shop that Harry had been in before.  Clearly exclusive, by appointment only, and the absence of price tags gave him a guilty twinge at the thought of the bill his friends would undoubtedly be paying for all of this.
"True," she agrees. "I don't have it with me, though, I'm afraid. Didn't think I'd need it. We can Floo back and get it."
Harry tilted his head to one side and opened his eyes.  The bright colours of the twinkling lights reflected off Draco's face, giving him an almost otherworldly glow.  "What do you want?"  Harry felt suddenly tired, the fight drained from him.
"Charming."  Pansy gave a little shake of her head.  "And damn right I won't marry you.  The last thing I want in a husband is completion for the gardener's attentions."
Draco opened his mouth to point out that they were grown adults, and anyway, Hermione was at least sensible, but a loud crash stopped the words in their tracks.  "Go," he said, giving Harry a gentle shove.  "Gag your friend.  And if that's Pansy breaking things, put her in a body bind before she gets too carried away."
“Oh, you can do that on Friday,” Draco replied, returning his calendar to its prized location on the kitchen wall, next to the fridge.  “I invited Goldstein and her over for dinner.”
"Do you think you'll like living here, Draco?" she asked  casually, but Draco could tell there was clearly more that she wanted to say.
After no discernible selection process, Harry grabbed a pre-packaged sandwich off the display.  "Take my advice," he said, turning back to face Draco.  "Steer clear of the stew.  Me and Blaise have been trying for months to work out what's in it, but I think we're probably best off not knowing."
“What colour do I get?” Harry took his seat on the floor between the two of them – he could only imagine Hermione’s expression if she could see him right at that moment.
Draco sipped at his wine before nodding slowly. "It was different. No one knowing who I am, or what I've done. It was nice to enjoy a meal without stares and whispers, or wondering if someone's going to hex you the minute your back's turned."
Harry tore his gaze away, thankful Malfoy was focussed on the curtains and couldn't see the fluster on his face. "Uh, no, not really."

Malfoy stops dead without warning, because he's a complete bastard, and Harry tumbles straight into him.
Neville smiled placidly.  “None taken.” He took a careful sip of his drink and then continued, “I think it’s great that you’re making the effort.  Luna was really happy when I told her.  It’ll make things much easier at the wedding if we don’t have to worry about you hexing Draco during the ceremony.”
had done a week-long series on it after he'd signed up, complete with psychological profile, and a Ministry-sanctioned photographer stalking his P.T. classes.  Harry had
Hermione perched in one of the fireside chairs, hands clasped in her lap. "Of course it's true, Ron." Her tone impatient. "Kingsley told us himself. He's hardly likely to make it up."
Harry wasn't sure what he felt most nervous about – seeing the finished product of his home, or seeing Malfoy again after what Hermione had said. Because it was like her words had opened a flood gate, and practically every thought he'd had in the last twenty-four hours had been about Malfoy. It had made for an interesting evening, with knowing looks directed his way all night, and smirks from Ginny, who, come to think of it, had previously accused Harry of having a thing for Malfoy.
"Of course you hadn't, darling."  Pansy grabbed a serviette off the buffet table and held it out.  "You might need this for the drool."
"Well, isn't this fortuitous.  My two favourite people."  There was a loud scrape as Blaise pulled out a chair and interrupted what Draco had officially termed
Choosing again to let it pass, Harry smiles and hands over the bag.  And the smile stays in place until the door snicks shut behind her.
"Next time, we're doing this at your house and I'll invite Weasley round.  Then let's see how funny you find it."
He's making a good point, Harry knows that.  He's seen what happens when people take that leap of faith – Neville and Hannah, Ron and Hermione.  Hell, even him and Ginny had been good, once upon a time.  But somewhere along the line Harry has become afraid, he's become far more concerned about consequences then he ever was before.  And while it's probably the sensible option, he knows, painfully well, that' it's holding him back.
Glad at least one of his friends was on the same page, Harry reached for his drink. Then stilled suddenly.  “Hang on, when did he tell you that?”
Harry shook his head firmly.  "No.  I didn't want him to.  There's little enough private about my life as it is – I don't want anyone messing around in my thoughts."
Malfoy nodded but the look of triumph Harry expected was missing. "Don't worry. After tomorrow I'll be out of your hair."
"I bet you do."  Blaise let out a bark of laughter.  "D'you use your left or your right hand for that?"
Before Harry can protest or deny, Neville thrusts one of the mugs at him.  "Here, why don't you take this over to his nibs, and I'll finish off here before someone breaks their neck."  True to his word, Neville deposits his own drink on the nearby counter and hoists the heavy sack over his shoulder – Harry is left alone, steaming mug in hand.`
“Unlikely,” Pansy replied, wearing the smug expression of one who knew they were about to impart a good piece of gossip.  “She’s left him.”
“I wouldn’t have thought your parents were the sunbathing types,” Ron commented, not bothering to hide the broad grin that split his face.
"Are you ill?"  Narcissa crossed the dining room quickly  and pressed her hand to Draco's forehead.  "You do feel rather clammy," she said, ignoring her son's efforts to pull away.  "Maybe I should ask—"
what you mean. But seriously, you have to ask yourself if this is what you really want, and if it is —"
"Yes."  Draco gave up all effort at pretence and looked Pansy firmly in the eye.  "We both know she's hardly the love of my life.  But
Draco's face shifted with something resembling sympathy. "It's one of the things I miss most about school," he admitted softly. "Quidditch, and the freedom to just fly wherever you wanted. Whenever you wanted."
Shaking his head to remove the smell of disinfectant and death that clung to the insides of his nostrils, Draco made his way over to the desk.
"Thanks, Blaise."  Harry still had that wide grin on his face.  "You too, Pansy.  We'd still be surrounded by boxes if it wasn't for your help."
The conversation lulled for a moment as Hermione entered the room, plates in hand.  Harry couldn't help but be grateful for the interruption – Ginny's expression showed her temper wasn't far behind.
Luna blushed prettily.  “Thank you, Harry.”  She reached up and tweaked his tie.  “You look rather handsome yourself.”
"Wedding dress shopping."  George scowled slightly before stabbing his fork at the chips in front of him.
Moments later Ron ambled into the room, his relaxed movements belied by the expression of outrage on his face.
"Harry, I…" Draco steps back again, and this time Harry lets him. He's made his case the best he can, and now it's up to Draco. "I need some time."
"So it would seem," Draco replied evenly.  "I'm starting to understand what Harry's been complaining about."
"Oh."  It wasn't Draco's most impressive response to date, but it was the best he could manage given the circumstances
"I don't think you need to be wearing that to meet the Weasleys for the first time," Draco remarked as Pansy picked up the scantiest piece of black lace he'd ever seen.
"Hard night?" Blaise teased, and Draco was relieved to notice a faint smile curving his lips, even though it came at his expense.
Tiny puffs of what looked like soot still coughed their way out of Harry's lungs on occasion – another reason for his brisk walk home in the fresh air.
"No more work talk," Ron said firmly, with a look that said he meant it. "We must be able to find something else to talk about, surely."
Malfoy’s attention immediately turned the small boy, and a soft smile warmed his face. “So I did.  Where shall we start?”  He shrugged off his outer robe and settled it carefully over the arm of a nearby chair.
"Oh, nothing," Hermione replied, and reached out to snag a chip off Harry's plate. "I was just thinking how much it sounds like you and Malfoy back in sixth year."
There was a loud clink as Pansy’s cutlery was swiftly dropped.  “That’s it.  I can’t eat this swill.”  She pushed the tray away and scowled at Draco.  “I said we should have gone for sushi, but oh no, someone couldn’t bear to miss out on the chance to ogle Potter some more.  As if seeing him over the breakfast table
"Tired? Not after a night in that new bed of yours." Malfoy looked outraged at the barest suggestion. "I have that bed at home, Potter, and it's impossible to have a bad night's sleep in it."
"Neither will Pansy's parents.  Still," Malfoy mused, "at least Weasley's a pureblood – that should placate them for a while, if nothing else."
"Just what, Ronald?" Hermione enquired.  Harry shifted his chair back just a tiny bit – there was no point getting caught in the crossfire.
Now that he was home a lot more, Harry liked to start his day with a nice cup of coffee and a leisurely read of the
Harry didn't reply for a moment.  Lost in thought, he just fiddled aimlessly with the box in his hands.  "I should really get on with this count," he said finally.
If Harry had known how short a time that would remain the case, he would probably have held his tongue. But hindsight, unlike his vision, was twenty-twenty, and something about Malfoy just made him want to
"So," Draco began, as he carefully undid the wrapper on his food.  "Have you had any more thoughts?"
The complaining tones of one Ronald Weasley were becoming an all too familiar sound in the Gryffindor common room.  To Harry, the usual recipient of said complaints, it was something akin to nails on a blackboard.
It was the truth and they both knew it. Just like they both knew Draco's weakness for Molly Weasley's cooking.
"A colander," Draco replied.  And when Blaise's frown didn't lessen, he added, "It's for straining things."
"Having fun, darling?"  Pansy strolled into the room as if nothing were amiss, and perched on the edge of the bath.
"Yeah.  And Draco's told Astoria as well, so that's good too, right?"  Harry looked up uncertainly – he still wasn't a hundred percent secure about this.
is loud. But they're in public and not even Harry's love of the impulsive can overcome his fear of scenes. Besides, Hermione is currently marshalling him around the dance floor in a deeply awkward fashion, and he needs to focus. Because while he now thinks there's a chance Draco might forgive him, Hermione's unlikely to if he treads on her feet. Dismemberment has already been threatened, and he's no longer sure she was joking.
Malfoy's expression was carefully neutral.  "I'm afraid I don't really have time at the moment.  I'm running late for breakfast as it is."
Harry bid him a quick farewell and headed swiftly for the door.  He needed to speak with George before he made any firm decisions.
"There's pie, too."  Potter's manner was friendly, almost confidential, and the smile that accompanied his words allowed Draco to imagine, not for the first time, what it would be like if only they could get along.
Harry had had a vague idea of who the blonde woman was – he'd seen her out and about with Draco and his mother several times – but he'd drawn a blank in coming up with a name.  "Lovely to meet you," he said instinctively, and, as the manners he'd been
"Exactly." Pansy placed her glass on the table and eyed Harry with a severe expression. "If you hurt him, Potter, you'll be talking in a very high voice for the rest of your life."
Ron nodded his agreement and seemed only too happy to let the subject drop.  Harry needed to take a few minutes to himself to process these revelations if he was to be any state to face Draco later.  And for the first time since they'd agreed to meet up, Harry found himself thinking Draco Malfoy was the last person he wanted to see at that moment.
"Yes," George replied, somewhat muffled around the mouthful of pasty.  He swallowed hard and then added, "Had to open the shop this morning and didn't have time for breakfast."
Ron had managed to make it into an upright position by the time Harry got back to the room – though he was still propped up by several pillows – and was clutching a mug of tea like a lifeline.
"Sleep? Chance'd be a fine thing," Harry replied.  "You find me somewhere with a nice comfy bed and I'll be happy."
"Ha ha."  Harry stepped around her and into the warmth of the lounge. "That's starting to get a little old."
It was hard to tell whose splutter was the loudest, but all three members of the Golden Trio were staring at Ginny with varying degrees of shock and outrage on their faces.  The youngest Weasley, however, remained unrepentant.
"We should probably replace most of this," he said with a gesture around them.  "I almost did it before we moved, but I thought we should choose the new stuff together."
Draco shakes his head and appears so instantly dismissive of the idea that Harry's heart starts to sink.  "Don't be ridiculous.  I'm sure Harry has better things to do than spend an evening making nice with stuck-up purebloods who probably wanted him dead ten years ago."
“What? No...I was just thinking about something.” Harry could feel the heat of embarrassment creeping up his cheeks and cursed his inability to hide it.
She had a point, Harry supposed. Not that he had any intention of telling her that. "And you're sure this will work?"
"Look," Hermione took hold of Harry's hands with her own and held them gently.  "I know you have feelings for Draco; I'm not blind.  I just want you to be sure you're doing this for the right reasons.  The last thing I want is you getting hurt."
"Draco."  Apparently tired of being ignored, Astoria tugged slightly on Malfoy's arm.  "I adore this song; dance with me."
"Well, this is something you don't see every day."  She turned her attention from Harry and Ron to their guests and nodded in acknowledgement.
A gentle hand in the small of her back is all the persuasion it needs to guide her towards an available chair. She settles her skirts and sits with more grace than her bulk should afford. But her eyes are narrowed slightly when she looks up at him. "Don't think this means you're getting away with it," she says, and taps her foot against his. "There
” Luna had just a hint of chastisement in her tone but Harry would not be made to feel bad for not using the ferret’s first name. “And Narcissa too.  They’re both incredibly knowledgeable about the right traditions and customs to follow.”
It seemed to take the wind out of Pansy's sails. She dropped into Ron's vacant chair and sighed. "He's miserable, Potter. Not that he'll admit it, mind you."
At this news, Draco switched into charming mode.  "Congratulations," he said warmly, stepping forward and kissing Hermione's cheek then turning his attention to Anthony and holding out his hand.  "Well done," he said, ignoring Hermione's disgruntled snort. As Anthony took hold of his hand, Draco leaned in slightly and murmured "I hope for the baby's sake it has
"No point whatsoever."  Harry crammed his feet into his trainers – untying the laces required far too much effort.  "The only plans I have for this evening involve pyjamas and a duvet.  And not even your scintillating company is enough to persuade me otherwise."
"It's an idea though."  Draco pressed the lid back in place and took a sip.  He sighed in satisfaction.
Ron shrugged again.  "It's not that unusual in the wizarding world – mum and dad were arranged.  It's a pureblood tradition."
. But Harry's tired and uncomfortable and she knows how much he hates these stupid Ministry events, so he just
Blaise sat watching, eating his way through the remains of Draco's lunch.  The smirk on his face was entirely too smug.  "So, are you still sure it's just business?"
Ron let out a groan, though whether this was in support of his girlfriend or the result of the third helping of pie he’d consumed wasn’t quite clear. Although, Harry thought, on reflection, the hand rubbing his belly was a good indicator.
“I’m not certain,” Blaise said, peering closely at the contents.  “But it looks uncommonly like something Mrs Norris once coughed up.”
“It would seem, Weasley,” Draco began coolly, “that your parents aren’t the only ones who have decided to take a holiday this festive season.”
Draco forced a smile onto his face.  "Of course.  It means more spare ribs for me, and you know how much I love them."  What Draco didn't add was that the reason he loved them was he loved watching the way Harry would suck his fingers clean afterwards.
"What do you think?"  Draco was about to get up when he spotted it – right at the back of the cupboard.  He grabbed the colander with a triumphant exclamation and got to his feet.
Draco frowned a little – he had yet to see the problem.  "But you always used to celebrate it," he pointed out.  "I remember."
Malfoy gave him a look that said he had his number. "Why would you stop? You've obviously got a talent for it, and you wouldn’t have kept all this if it didn't matter to you."
"Not yet," Harry said. "But between Blaise and Hermione, and those two over there," he nodded over to the bar where Ron and Pansy stood waiting for drinks, "I think we're going to be spending rather more time in each other's company. So I suppose it would be easier all round if we tried to be friends at least. Don't you think?"
An irritated flick of his wand sent the latest decimation of the English language off his desk and in the direction of its author in the outer office.
.  Not that he was planning to change into tights and pull his pants on over the top – Harry didn't think he was quite built for the Lycra look anymore – rather he was tempted to use the cover to Apparate the remaining distance home.
Malfoy seemed earnest and genuine, but Harry really wasn't in the mood to be forgiving.  "Couldn't it have waited?  It's gone one in the morning, and I'm already knackered."
“What time is it?”  Harry rubbed at his eyes with his fists, an action that Draco found almost irresistibly adorable.
Harry's stomach twisted pleasantly at the thought of dinner with Malfoy.  Even though there was nothing between them – Merlin, they were barely friends – it was a long time since he'd had such an attractive dinner companion.  "Won't Astoria mind?"  Harry wasn't sure the question sounded as innocent out loud as he'd planned it to, but he couldn't help himself from fishing.
Before Draco could come up with the perfect rebuttal, Blaise had his hand on Pansy's arm and was steering her towards the fireplace.  "We'll leave you two in peace now," he said over his shoulder.  "Why don't you pop that champagne and
Draco wasn't quite ready to admit Blaise's crime to himself, much less to anyone else.  So he attempted to distract Pansy instead.  "You know," he said casually, "that dress makes you look a little pregnant.  How appropriate for lunch with the most fertile family in Britain."
Potter reached for his wand and aimed it deliberately at Draco's hand – and for the briefest moment, Draco couldn't help but think of the last time he'd been on the receiving end of it.  But then Potter was murmuring softly, a gentle cadence of words unlike the typical healing spells Draco was familiar with, and he could see the cut vanish before his eyes.
Harry wrapped his hands around the mug and felt the heat of the Warming Charm seep through him. He raised the cup to his lips, but paused halfway. "Did you make this?" Hermione might have mastered Molly's glare, but the kitchen skills were definitely a work in progress. She could burn water, according to Ron.
Malfoy presses several kisses along Harry's jaw line before he replies.  "I plan on there being quite a few next times."
"He's invited me round for dinner tomorrow night."  Draco took a sip of his drink. "We're going to talk."
Draco lightly slapped Harry's hand away and returned his attention to the claret-coloured cravat.  "However much you hate wearing dress robes, I can assure you that it's the preferable option to turning up at Granger's wedding looking less than perfect."  Draco's hands stilled and he took a step back to admire his handiwork.  "I'm under strict instructions where you're concerned, and I do
Harry flushed slightly.  "I overslept and didn't have time for breakfast," he explained.  "Draco kept me up late watching some pretentious film with subtitles."
As an Auror, Harry didn’t exactly move in the same circles, but they did work in the same building, shared a couple of mutual friends, and Harry wasn’t stupid – he knew Andromeda had built bridges with her estranged family, however tight-lipped she was about it around him. By rights their paths should have crossed. How much, Harry didn’t realise until things changed. Then it seemed like Malfoy was everywhere he looked.
"Ah." Knowing Pansy, it's probably closer to the truth than Harry likes to think. "So best I stay out of her way tonight then?"
Harry flushed slightly at the hidden meaning of that comment.  "I thought you said you wouldn't men—"
favours owed for the damn tickets. But there was something about Draco, about the brief flashes of unrestrained joy on his face in the rare moments the Canons played well, about the wary, almost nervous look that overtook his face in between, and in the way that Harry found he was starting to wish that maybe this was a date after all. That they weren't in a stadium with thousands of prying eyes, and that he had Draco alone so he could get to know the man he had seen flashes of in these last few meetings.
"Said I would, didn't I?"  Potter was a little defensive, but the usual rancour was absent as he waved Draco into the cosy living room.
Eventually, Potter's thrusts became more erratic.  He lowered his head then, and as he bit gently at the crook of Draco's neck, his climax shuddered through him.
"Maybe I should just tell them the truth," Harry continued, as if Draco hadn't spoken.  "Tell them about the ten months' worth of chances I gave you, before you left me to go and have pureblood children with a woman you don't even love."
After that, Harry did his best to avoid Malfoy. Ginny and Hermione questioned him constantly about what had happened – but Harry told them nothing.  He'd just waved them off with a few vague answers and hoped that would be enough for now.  He hadn't really expected it to work, so when they both appeared to back off, Harry couldn’t help but suspect Ron's tongue had been wagging just a little.
Draco let out a groan, placed his peas safely on the worktop, and then swiftly emptied his own glass of wine down his neck.  No sooner had he placed the glass back down than a loud beeping noise filled the room.
Draco’s expression clearly showed his scepticism at this claim, but he just shrugged.  “Fine,” he said, pushing away from the worktop he’d been lounging against.  “Don’t say I didn’t offer.”
Harry nodded in agreement and never gave it another thought, until an ear-piercing scream rent the air.
Blaise just smiled and shook his head slowly.  But as the flames crackled green around him, Draco definitely heard the words, "Don't say I didn't warn you."
Harry feels like he really should say something to this, but it's all he can do right now not to swallow his own tongue.  So he gives a weak smile and gestures towards the door, hoping Draco will understand.  The smile he gets in return is sympathetic.
Draco stood motionless, eyes wide in shock.  "I...I'm sorry," he said.  "I shouldn't have come here tonight."  Then, in one swift motion, he raised his wand and began to turn.  Before Harry could process what was happening, the crack of Apparition echoed in the still night air.
Ever since that first evening, which Draco had written off as a fluke, something never to be repeated, he was never alone at his table for more than a few minutes before Potter arrived.  Not that Potter was distracting Draco with ceaseless chatter – they merely passed pleasantries and then both settled down to their tasks at hand.
Harry reached for the holly covered gloves and handed them to a definitely harried-looking Hermione.  "Remind me again why you're doing this?"  He looked at the kitchen table, its surface already covered with earlier batches of baking.
Draco Malfoy tumbled out of the Floo with none of his usual grace.  Flailing slightly before retaining his balance, he glanced around quickly to make sure no one had seen.
"You mean he's stopping until the wedding?"  Draco intentionally spoke a little louder so Pansy could still hear him, but even he winced at just how shrill his voice sounded then.
Harry's last warrant request. Harry had a feeling that even the best of Malfoy's friends still had a small cross to bear in that regard.
"Fine," he gritted out eventually.  "If that's how you want." Harry left then, as quickly as possible, without waiting to hear Malfoy's reply – he'd heard enough for one day.
And it wasn't just the tree.  There wasn't a part of the flat that had escaped Draco's attention, except for the bathroom, and Harry wasn't entirely convinced that wasn't next on the list.
It's silent and uncomfortable, and Harry's wondering how long he's going to have to lie there before alcohol or sleep takes hold.  Fortunately, his bed partner has planned ahead.
"Mmm," was all Draco said in response.  Memories of that night tended to evoke memories of a particular broom ride, and somehow he doubted Astoria would appreciate him reminiscing.  He took another sip of his coffee and sighed his satisfaction through the steam.  "What brought this on, anyway?"
"It was more than my life was worth at the time.  And you'd have never managed to keep it to yourself, anyway."
As interesting as all this was, none of it grabbed Harry's attention as much as the sight of Draco's pert arse straddling the banister did.
"What are we going to do?"  Harry asks, because his usual weekend plans of football and beer with Ron are clearly out of the window.
Despite everything they'd been through in the past, and his current irritation at her spying, Harry had never loved Ginny more than he did in that moment.  He shifted slightly in her embrace and wrapped his arms around her tightly in return.
Harry shifts back just in time to avoid Hermione's hand – the intended slap falters in mid-air. He proceeds to tug at his collar pointedly.
“And spend the week listening to you and your latest boy toy screwing each other senseless?  No, thank you.”
"I'm sure she'll understand."  Possibly the biggest lie Draco had told in some time – he knew quite well Astoria would be anything
Malfoy snorted. "They might be free elves, but the old instincts are still there. They anticipate your needs, and one look at your face this morning was enough to set them scurrying. And the shouting didn't exactly help."
“I’d need a partner first.” Malfoy expression was a touch wistful.  “And for the wizarding world to recognise gay marriage.”
"Absolutely wonderful," Blaise said, and he grinned as if blissfully unaware of what he'd done.  "I was just wondering where Astoria is?"
Harry shifted uncomfortably under his old professor's scrutiny and was relieved when he turned his attention back to Draco.  "Friends," Snape repeated with a shake of his head.  "What is the world coming to?"
Pansy had impeccable timing – Draco had to give her that.  Or at least he would have, had he not been so busy cursing her name under his breath.
of surprise that escaped his mouth.  Then Draco's hands worked their way insistently under Harry's robes and deftly undid his trousers.  Sliding his hands inside, he couldn't hold back a groan at the feel of Harry's skin, hot and smooth against his palms.
Harry grinned at the memories this evoked. "No. Her and Malfoy are quite friendly, believe it or not."
"No." Ron shook his head firmly. "Well, maybe a little. I just…I know you took Malfoy out as a favour to me, and I appreciate it, really. But me and Pansy are good now, I reckon. You don't have to keep it up if you don't want to. I never…" Ron stopped then and looked away.
Harry had only just set foot through the doors of the Manor and was admiring the Christmas decorations when Draco came hurrying across the marble floor towards him.  “Sorry.” He gave a sheepish look.  “I got caught up at Ron and Hermione’s.”
Draco inclined his head in acknowledgement. "I imagine being an Auror keeps you busy, and having Pansy in the department must be interesting to say the least."
Felix himself, no doubt egged on by a well-meaning Ron, had owled him a very sweet note asking him to dinner.  Harry had considered it for a split second before his conscience reminded him that it wouldn't be fair to lead someone on who was obviously interested, when his heart was already engaged elsewhere.
"Nothing serious, I hope?" Harry asked.  Malfoy's tone and expression didn't indicate that this was the case, but after years of making small talk at these functions, the question was practically a reflex.
Harry crossed the room in a few, short strides.  He reached out and carefully tied the scarf around Draco's neck.  "Positive," he replied, with a warm smile.  Then it faltered.  "Are you having second thoughts?" he asked softly.  "I'd understand," he added hurriedly.  "This is an even bigger step for you than me."
Harry scrubbed roughly at his face and stifled a yawn.  "Look, there's obviously no way I'm getting back to sleep any time soon, so if you insist on us talking, how about we take it down to the common room?"
The trouble was, the future he'd always assumed he would have had turned out to be fool's gold.  Ginny was gone, happy in her new relationship, and the reality of Auror training left little more than the bitter taste of disappointment in Harry's mouth.  He was starting to suspect he had only clung so tenaciously to this vision of his future out of the very real fear that he would not get to have one at all.
In the end Draco decided to forgo the lube, despite Pansy's helpful owling of some earlier that afternoon.  He took, instead, a bottle of wine, snaffled from the Manor's wine cellars under the curious gaze of his mother.
"Did you at least advertise?"  Harry didn't want to interfere, but sometimes George just needed a little prodding out of his apathy.
“George says you’re a good bloke.  Most people do.  But until very recently all I’ve seen is you treating my best friend like a pariah.”
.  Hermione and Ron had both told him he was being stupid, that Molly wasn't angry, but Harry was still a little nervous about facing the woman who was like a mother to him.
Some of his disbelief at the question obviously leaked into his expression, because Malfoy huffed in response.  "Fine," he said, with what, on anyone else, Harry would have called a pout.  "You try making small talk then.  It's not as easy as it looks – especially not between us."
When the first shout echoed through the house, Harry was in his bedroom fresh from the shower. He looked at his clock – a whole hour had passed since he left the Ministry; Hermione was slipping. Harry had just tugged on a pair of jeans when a loud 'pop' heralded Kreacher's arrival. House-elves were no great respecters of privacy.
"Yes."  Draco watched in satisfaction as Potter raised his fingers to touch his lips. It was good to see he wasn't the only one so affected.
"Don't pretend like the thought hadn't crossed your mind."  Pansy refilled her glass, leant back on the sofa and settled her feet on the table.  "And I expect details."
"Side-tracked?"  Neville looks around, clearly searching for the cause of Harry's distraction.  Harry can tell the moment he finds it because Neville's expression is a mixture of amusement and exasperation. "Honestly, it's like working with some love-sick teenager."
"A Malfoy working for the Goblins," Snape mused slowly.  "I imagine your father is not thrilled with that prospect."
Whilst he made hard work of swallowing, Harry let his gaze flicker over to the Slytherin table – Malfoy's hair stood out like a beacon amidst the drab light of a Scottish winter morning.  The subject of Harry's scrutiny was far too busy selecting his breakfast with an expert air to pay attention – Parkinson, on the other hand, was not so occupied.  She spotted Harry's fleeting glance, and returned it with a wink of her own.
"Well, you say bi, Harry, but I've never seen you show any interest in women since the littlest Weasley was on the scene.  I'd say you're definitely at the higher end of the Kinsey Scale, my friend."
Draco stepped forward, his eyes filled with a visible excitement that reminded Harry of a child on Christmas morning.  "Severus," he said softly, voice full of awe.
He laid his quill down atop his parchment, clasped his hands together on the desk's careworn surface, and leant forward slightly.
had begun with, and Harry thinks he was right.  He likes the interaction, even if this is the result.
"Yeah, maybe."  Harry rubbed at his face and wondered if Kreacher had slipped crazy pills in his porridge that morning.  "Can I get back to you on it?"
Harry's now certain someone's spiked the champagne. Apparently he voices this thought out loud because Blaise is laughing again.
"Doesn't leave you long to organise the wedding," Harry said suddenly.  "If you need any help with anything..."
"Oh, Draco, there you are."   Harry watched as a pretty blonde woman sidled up to Malfoy and took hold of his arm as if clinging for dear life.  "I thought I'd lost you."
Now that Hermione's attention was solely fixed on him, Harry half wished Ron was still there – loud overreactions and all.  But he'd learnt the trick with Hermione was to get confessions over with quickly, like ripping off a plaster.  The longer you left it, the harder she dug, and the more painful it was for all involved.
"There.  Look."  Blaise nodded in what he clearly thought was a discreet manner.  It occurred to Harry that for an ex-Slytherin, he was decidedly
want to be an Auror," he said finally. "Or at least I think I did. But that was ages ago, and it might have been more about spiting Umbridge than anything."
"Not unless you ask very nicely," Parkinson added.  And suddenly, what was on the other side of the door became of a lot less concern to Harry than what was on this one.  He turned the handle without further word and entered.
Harry poured himself a coffee from the ever-present pot and sank into Malfoy's recently vacated chair.  "Yes."
Harry was a little surprised to hear that, given the history between the two. But then he supposed if he had noticed that Draco Malfoy had grown up, others probably had too. "Not to be rude, Nev, but why are you here?"
"I don't know what else to tell you," Pansy said, coming to a halt as they reached the till.  "You know the best way to avoid it happening, but you're not willing to do it."
The flat seemed unusually quiet for a Saturday.  Normally it echoed with the sound of Draco's running commentary on his favourite TV programmes, plus his relentless demands for caffeinated beverages.
"You're only just realising that now?  Idiot Gryffindor."  Draco shook his head in mock pity.  "Now get going; Granger will have my hide if you're late today."
A loud, derisive snort filled the hallway.  "Zabini?" Snape demanded incredulously.  "You think he and Potter are...?"  Snape tailed off, clearly not willing to put such a thought into words.
"You should have said earlier."  Hermione cast a Stasis Charm on the table – Harry just managed to whisk his hand away in time.
“All under control from the sounds of it.”  To be honest, Harry had tuned out a lot of what Luna had said – it was a side effect of her using the phrase
The noise was sufficient to draw Harry's attention.  He appeared in the hallway, wiping dirty hands down his apron.  Hedwig instantly settled on his shoulder, affectionately nipping his ear.  Harry grinned at Draco.
want company.  But, as with most of his life so far, what Draco wanted rarely came to pass.  And perhaps the only saving grace was that it was Blaise who awaited him, rather than his mother.
Author's Notes: Thanks to the mods, my beta, and the person who prompted this wonderful song. And to everyone who reads, I hope you enjoy.
"Good," Hermione said, while Pansy settled for glaring at Draco.  "How about you two start sorting things out in here, and we'll get all these put in the right rooms."  She gestured at the pile of now-resized boxes at their feet.
"Good."  Harry leant back in his chair and stretched.  "Either of you want anything else?" He nodded towards the counter.
There was an odd sort of affection in Draco's tone as he spoke.  Harry wanted to point out that Hermione was
Harry was grateful he'd had the foresight to choose the seat facing the door – for once he felt that Ron would be better surprised, rather than giving him valuable seconds notice to work up a head of steam.
Even now, he could still feel the touch of Harry's lips against his own – something he'd barely dared to hope he would ever experience again.  One brief kiss, the barest of touches, and yet Draco had felt more in those few seconds than in his entire two year relationship with Astoria.
So most evenings Draco sought out his secluded little corner of the Hogwarts' Library where he remained unmolested by students and Madam Pince alike.
"Fine," Ron said with a huff.  "You can live with whoever you want.  But you're not telling me," he pointed forcefully in his wife's direction, "that you don't find it a little bit odd that his first choice was Malfoy."
was written all over Ron's face.  The truth was an explanation that Harry – and, he was fairly sure, Ron – wasn't ready for yet.  So instead he shrugged.  "I thought it might be good if people saw us all together.  You know, getting on, putting the past behind us?"
Rose gave Draco a look that reminded all concerned that she was still Hermione's daughter, however young she might me.
Ron watched their boss stalk away before turning to scowl at Harry. "Thanks for that, mate. You were a big help."
Blaise paused for a moment and watched him through narrowed eyes.  "Sure about that, are you?" Then placed one hand on Harry's jaw and tilted his head until he was facing the dance floor again.
Certain his cheeks are as red as can be, and wishing he'd made his exit just a few seconds earlier, Harry turns slowly.
"Just had some contracts to drop off upstairs. Draco didn't want to leave the shop, so I thought I'd take advantage and see if I couldn't catch you for lunch."
"So what about you?" Malfoy asked after a few moments silence. "How come you ended up as an Auror? Or is that a daft question now?"
"I was," Narcissa agreed, "but it can't be helped.  I think I shall take a potion and then retire to my chambers."
"I didn't mean to the first time. I was just…I didn't…" Harry scrubs one hand tiredly over his face. "I have no idea what I was doing."
Harry’s eyes shot to the clock.  He’d been overjoyed the day that Andromeda had pointed to the hand that represented him, and now bloody Malfoy was on it.  With Luna and Neville, Hermione, and now this, it was like the bastard was trying to take over every aspect of Harry’s life.
Draco had still been living at the Manor but regularly confided in Harry just how stifling and oppressive he found it, not only because his father’s fall from grace had caused both parents to turn their thwarted hopes and ambitions onto him, but also because of the vivid and terrifying memories Draco had been left with as a result of Voldemort’s residency.
Blaise stepped forward at that point and placed a bottle of champagne into each of Draco's hands.  "A little house-warming present from both of us."
Hermione had clearly been reading up on its history, and insisted on relentlessly imparting snippets of information to them.   Harry nodded politely, long used to faking interest in Hermione’s lecturing, Anthony managed to show slightly more interest, having more of a vested interest in appeasing his wife, but Draco was far too enthralled by the sights of Trafalgar Square to pay her any heed.
When they finally parted, both panting slightly, it wasn't to go far.  They were separated only by a matter of inches.  Draco looked at Harry through lashes which were thicker and darker than Harry had imagined, and asked "D'you want to get out of here?"  in a breathless voice that stole Harry's own away from him.
"Maybe you should take some time to think about it, Mr Worthington.  Go home; discuss it with your wife and son.  We want you to feel comfortable with your decision."
In reply, Draco simply thrust the items he was carrying into Pansy's hands.  "I...um...have to go," he said lamely, before turning on his heel and striding from the shop.
A frantic knocking on the door pulled Harry from his reverie.  Despite the noise being muffled by the water, Harry could still make out the vague sound of his name being called.  Clearly, Draco, too, had returned after a busy day at the office, and was keen to stake his claim on the bathroom.
"You can't rush these things," Draco said, as he pulled plates out of the cupboard and placed them on the warming pad.  "We live together now.  If it goes wrong can you imagine how awkward that would be?"
"Ahh, you mean like Granger and Boot?"  Clearly the rest of the Golden Trio weren't quite so in the dark about Granger's activities, Draco mused.
The tinkling of the shop doorbell eased the tightness in Draco's chest, and the sight of Harry waiting for him did the rest.
Just as with the Welcome Feast in his school days, Draco always ate too much at Christmas.  Even before sitting down to the main meal he had consumed vast amounts of Honeyduke's finest chocolates.  Draco had quite a sweet tooth anyway, but when it was Harry feeding them to him, he was hardly going to say no.
Harry grinned again.  Draco always maintained he wasn't an animal lover, but creatures of all shapes and sizes seemed to just adore him.  And though Draco would never admit it, Harry suspected the reverse was true also.
They might not share a bed anymore, but she still knows him better than anyone. Besides Ron and Hermione, she's the only one he's ever really let through his defences. He'd denied this when Draco hurled the accusation, like a knife designed to wound. But as he looks into her warm, compassionate eyes, Harry can no longer deny it to himself.
Harry slanted a glance across the room and watched as Draco chatted with Hermione.  He’d been seeing him through new eyes for a while now, but he’d never dreamt it could be reciprocal.
Harry was as surprised as Malfoy looked at the laugh that escaped, and even more surprised to realise that they were having an almost friendly conversation. "This might just work," he said finally.
Hermione's frown cleared.  "Oh thank goodness.  I was beginning to think we'd have to drink out of bottles.  Let's go inside, and you can put those down."
Malfoy slapped the parchment on his desk, though his expression was more exasperated than angry. "For Merlin's sake, Potter!"  He took off his glasses – how had Harry never noticed those before? – and rubbed tiredly at his eyes. "If you want me to recommend this warrant to the Wizengamot, you're actually going to have to let me read it."
And suddenly it was too much for Harry to bear.  He knew there were a million reasons why this was a bad idea, why he should just pull away and ask Draco to leave, but it just felt so achingly familiar, so
"Weasley," Harry corrected for what felt like the millionth time.  "And, given some of the more choice tales I've heard of yours and Pansy's exploits, I should bloody well hope not."
"Hermione, you're a Law Witch, right?" Harry dumped his tray onto the table and sank into the empty seat opposite.
"And yet you seem strangely unperturbed by it."  Draco frowned as this occurred to him.  Surely Potter should be horrified – not just because Draco was male, but because he was a Slytherin, and worse still, a Malfoy.

"How is this any of your business, exactly?" They'd gone several weeks without the faintest flicker of irritation, but Harry could feel his temper rising now.
What Harry really wanted was to say no, for Malfoy to go away, and for him to be able to get a good night's sleep for once.  But as Harry had learnt over the years, he rarely got what he wanted, so with a vain hope of
"Draco," Hermione acknowledged a little stiffly.  "You've recovered from your earlier bout of deafness, then?"
Snape ran a hand distractedly through his hair, which, Harry noticed, didn't look either as lank or as greasy as it had in real life.  "Potter, why on earth—"
"Are you absolutely sure he's straight?"  Hermione's brow wrinkled slightly.  "I know he's supposedly dating Astoria Greengrass, and then there was that whole thing with him and Pansy Parkinson at Hogwarts, but I've heard rumours.  And Pansy's made one or two comments in passing that have made me think."
