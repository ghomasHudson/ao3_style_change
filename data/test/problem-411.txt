He catches up to me and we continue in silence again. I should’ve taken my camera. The sun is up and the city is nice. Tomorrow then. I pull out one of the papers from my pocket. It’s one with museums, one of the pages in English.
The woman, Coraline, waves at them. Malfoy leans slightly in and guides her in opposite direction, presumably to their office.
“Potter, let me introduce you to our new colleague, Coraline Auclair. She’s the temporary exchange for Craft,” Malfoy smiles down at her, and she extends her hand towards Harry. Harry shakes it, thinking she’s just Malfoy’s type. Short, long brown hair and blue eyes.
'So? Ginny and I are still friends.'
'Yeah, a bit. Whatever, you already knew so what. I don't care.'
‘Ugh! Stop it, Harry. I don’t want to hear about anyone’s sex life. But I want to help you to feel better, so I’m willing, but just this once.’
Also, I was never obsessive – and if I was it was justified, I was right!
‘Good game by the way,’ Potter says and yanks me from my thoughts, ‘even though you did have Ginny.’
‘Great! So, this was lovely. I will start on the contract tomorrow and on Monday we will hopefully finish it at the office, but as I know our legal department, might take some time. But in any case, I’ll owl you, yeah?’
Jesus.
‘Isn’t it their bedtime?’ I ask.
and maybe that made me mad because I pushed away more forcefully than I intended and he squawked something when I practically pushed his face into the pillow.
Potter looks happy and that hurts even more.
'Everything.'
'See you.' He blinks, nods and leaves me again.
‘Well then,’ she stands up, ‘I’m going to check. I will send Twinkle to tell you once everything is set.’ she walks out the room.
If he thinks he'll make me beg...
he said, his fingers pulling me back by my hair, kissing my neck while I was putting the box on the countertop, missing it and hearing as it fell on the floor.
When he’s done, he puts a plate in front of me, Full English, tea, coffee and a bowl of fruit.
‘Yes, you English are very uptight, right?’
‘Draco! Blaise! Where are you?’ Pansy is screaming from above.
'Yes.'
'It's good, can't complain. Bit weird at the beginning, but they got used to me.'
When I finally reach him and give him the wand he sneers: ‘I fucking hate you.’
So even when we’re broken up,
‘Cultured,’ I shrug and sip on my beer the waiter already brought.
She sits on Harry’s desk. She keeps doing it and Harry hates it. She perches there and talks to Malfoy, loud and voice high like hyena.
To keep the promise – to myself – I went to the Knockturn Alley after my shift, straight to Malfoy’s shop – it’s called Curious Curses (suspicious much?) – and he had a customer so I waited inside, looking around, looking into glass displays, watching for anything that might attack or spurt some dark magic right on me. Malfoy glared immediately as I stepped in and still managed to glare between talking to his customer. When the wizard left, Malfoy barked
He stands there for a second until it’s clear I won’t be saying or confirming anything, then he strides out of the room, keeping the door wide open.
'Don't touch me!'
Potter sighs. ‘Fine. But you find it.’
I walk in front of him. Not that I know where I’m going, but I’d rather get lost than to follow him. Yes, ten hours with Potter is basically a torture for me, but seeing as he might hate it even more, it’s worth it.
‘So we told you everything we remembered, your turn.’ Pansy looks all excited, grinning at me.
'You don't have to. I like you as you are.'
Before he can say anything at all, I slide down his body and kiss him there.
'Then yes, I won't come alone to the wedding. I'm not as pathetic as you.'
'That's fine too. So just, I don't know, find a hobby or something, to take your mind of things.'
So, I waved to Ron who was looking from the shop window waiting to have lunch with me and walked with Malfoy.
Ron hums and Hermione just looks at me, not convinced at all. ‘If you say so.’
'I'm not adorable.'
‘No, I’m okay, thanks,’ I shake my head as I’m bouncing Rose on my knees. ‘How was your day?’ I ask her.
From the options I have, he’s the lesser evil.
'Yeah.'
‘No I didn’t. He did it on his own volition.’
'Okay, whatever. So you want to?'
Yeah, I can’t even justify this to myself anymore.
'I missed you so fucking much.'
'Thank you for the cake, by the way, I don't know if I said so already.'
Hermione comes back holding a steaming cup. ‘I’m tired boys, I think I’m going to head upstairs. Thanks again, Harry.’
‘Did he remember it the day after? Do you know?’
'You started this whole thing, Potter so don't you dare blaming me for it.'
Grey eyes look back at him with a frown, as usual. Harry noticed the other day Malfoy’s lashes were sort of pale brown, glowing in the light just like his hair. His eyes had specks of blue in them, Harry looked very closely while he could. It was on a stakeout three days ago, in an incredibly narrow space between buildings. Malfoy was looking down the street and Harry was examining his face.
Whatever.
‘Oh my lord!’ Pansy breathes. ‘What happened to you, Blaise? You didn’t use to be so… no fun! I think you need this more than Draco. Come on you two! I know just the place!’ She points a finger at me: ‘You! Get dressed, you have ten minutes and in the meantime, I will start on Blaise. Here, you have another, drink up.’ She pushes a full glass in his hands which he takes, reluctantly .
‘You bet you will be responsible, Potter!’ Robards shrieks and spits, the vein on his forehead pulsing. ‘I don’t know who you think you are! I am still the Head of this department and you might be groomed for my position, but not yet, Potter! How dare you suggest Malfoy… Malfoy! For highly important and top-secret mission is beyond me! I am the one making decisions here and what I say, goes! Do not think for one second…’
‘Yes, I work in Blaze Potions. With Blaise Zabini, friend from school.’
'Sometimes it can be and it's completely fine, I get it. There will be a lot more other different parties.'
'If he could hear you now, he would be so flattered.'
“Hilarious, Potter.” Malfoy takes his wand and points it at his shirt and trousers, vanishing the smell and drying himself. “Hope you’re happy. Now, scram.”
'Yes.'
‘It’s a night-club!’
'Why is he barking?'
'No?'
It must have been in the alley, it’s the last thing he knows. Him and Malfoy duelling a witch who was smuggling muggle children to Norway, a flash of red light, and then darkness.
If he thinks I’m going to leave this be, he’s sorely mistaken.
'What have you been up to?'
'Yes.'
'Sometimes it sure looks like it, the amount of times you cancelled on me.'
'Pft. Doubt it. You'd have to lift me above your head, no magic.'
'Oh, no, I forgot. Sorry. I let him out in the garden.'
He laughed, very ugly, sneering grin:
. There was no answer.
'That I am.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Excuse me?'
'Access to this vault. On the Minister's orders.'
in his most annoying, poshest voice. I shrugged. I couldn’t tell him that I just wanted to spy on him, still.
‘So?’ she asks and she and Ron looks at me as one.
'I have few names in mind but I haven't written to anyone yet.'
'I thought we were having dinner with Hermione and Weasley.'
“He would if you wouldn’t be such a cock-block!”
‘Sod off, Malfoy. If you didn’t have a professional on the team you wouldn’t have a chance.’ He throws himself on the sofa and frowns.
I stay still, just kiss him until his hands grab my ass and guide me to move. I do and my arms bracket his had and we're chest to chest, cheek to cheek, his cock hard, pressed between us, mine grinding inside of him slowly. His nails drag on my back almost painfully as I thrust inside.
I have to stop going to his shop.
It hangs between us, the question we both know the answer to. He stands in his door, not letting me in. What a prick, it's not like we've never come to blows before the last time.
She sees me but looks at Potter who’s sitting on the armrest of the sofa. ‘Be a darling, Harry, and give this to Draco.’
We cross a river and I choose the first nice looking place near a park.
'Yes, let's.'
He stops short at that but resumes drinking soon after. I watch him cringe at the taste, and even his borrowed face can not completely wipe out his trademark sneer. His face is ruddy and greasy, his hair matted, falling on his hunched shoulders and his stomach is flowing over his belt. Somehow, it’s much easier talking to him in this form.
So, I stood up, said
'I feel honoured, Potter. Finally, it's nice to hear I truly am more than this crup of yours.'
'But I just really wanted to wind you up, Potter. I know how you like it.'
‘Would you like to leave?’ I look at the man whispering in my ear. So handsome. Andrew, the man I am fucking tonight because I need a rest from the week from hell. Plus, I don’t care, I tell the voice in my head that is ready to reprimand me and is very similar to Hermione’s.
‘It’s none of your business, Potter,’ he spits and put his hands on the table, his knuckles are white and I think he’s about to get up and leave. ‘If you don’t believe me, fine. Don’t. We’re not friends, I don’t care, but…’
'Yeah, of course. She's my friend, we've been friends for so long. I want the best for her. I want... yeah, soon...'
Andromeda smiles and nods. ‘Yes, she did. She had a very specific idea.’ We are quiet for a moment. ‘I like her, you know?’
'You're mean.'
‘Yes! I need vodka or something. Is there a firewhiskey?’ Ron hands me a glass.
He smiles and then leans in.
'Hi.'
‘Enjoy,’ Andromeda says.
I told her, Ron groaned again, shook his head and said
‘…just ask one of the aurors to cast some disillusionment and protective charms,’ I finish.
'No problem. I will give you something more now. Come up.'
‘Why is it any of your concern, Potter?’ He rounds the corner to the lifts.
'Your face.'
'Why are you here, Harry?'
‘What are you doing?’ he asks.
I sigh, trying so hard to keep my cool. ‘The Ministry did not choose those two on a lark, you’d know if you read the file.’
'I don't know. It was just too much, I guess. Too many feelings. I just always thought it would be me up there, being finally a part of the family. I don't know, it just... suddenly got to me that it will never happen anymore.'
'You don't feel like you could do it?'
I really wanted to take a break, but I can’t now, can I?
'Okay then, see you tomorrow. I love you. Good night.'
He keeps banging on the fucking door. She keeps yelling. I so don’t want to let them in.
Harry stomps his feet and does the same spell Malfoy just did, the one he reluctantly showed him when Harry asked the first week as partners. The folders flutter for few seconds and then don’t do anything. Harry’s never been good at it. That, or the git lied to him.
He keens when he slips out and starts caressing Harry’s back and lower, until he reaches his hole where the cum is already spilling out. “Did you?” he asks, licking Harry’s skin.
Merlin, I hate this place. I don’t even know why I’m here, honestly. Probably some weird remorse or conscious or whatever. What if he dies and then everyone will blame it on me and then they kill me or sentence me to the Kiss?
'I don't get it.'
'Oh please. Of course I'll come with you.'
Fucking ridiculous, that’s what it is.
'Blaise is my friend and it's not his mistake that you two broke up like, what, one, two years ago? If you will ruin this for him, Potter...'
He nods again when Malfoy leaves and Harry hears his retreating steps. He has no idea what he just agreed to.
The fact that Malfoy has not released his cock yet makes it a lot better. He keeps wanking him and it feels like too much. Harry can feel his balls swell. His heart beats faster.
'I want to fuck you too. Slow and nice, I want to listen to your moans as I take you apart.'
'I took a half day off.'
I think I fucked up.
'I would never think this is your sort of bar Potter.'
“Okay?” Malfoy asks when the head is already inside, stretching him wide.
Harry really tries not to think about it. When he does, he feels this weird ache in his chest and stomach, and he doesn’t care for it. But sometimes, he can’t help himself. He imagines them together and he wants to go back several months. When he and Malfoy had barely any relationship beside being partnered. When Harry didn’t find him ridiculously attractive.
I nod. ‘I won’t write anything else.’ When he’s still standing there, glaring, I add through gritted teeth: ‘I promise.’
we wake up together. And then, because he starts it, I follow up.
'Whatever. My argument still stands. You are my plus one so we match.'
Malfoy shakes his head. “Dream on, Potter.”
I found a cursed vase this time. I brought it to Malfoy.
I turn, open the door, ready to leave. I look back at the last moment, one final miserable attempt.
I try to answer but then Blaise interrupts. ‘You know you have a job, don’t you? You could’ve at least tell me you wouldn’t be coming! I had to postpone some orders, Draco, I am losing money because of you.’ He bangs the door closed and follows to the sitting room, Pansy behind him.
Harry sighs, placid and hard. “Kiss me,” he demands, and Malfoy brings his head upwards, nipping at Harry’s bottom lip. Harry cards his fingers through Malfoy’s hair and guides his mouth properly on his. He likes how Malfoy tastes and wonders what the rest of him tastes like. “Do you want to show me your bedroom?” Harry pants into his mouth.
‘Yeah, that’s why she got the position, family connections. I think anyone else would be better.’
'Yeah?'
We were half naked and he was struggling with his jeans, so I helped him out of it and since I was already on my knees, I thought,
‘Please! No one will even spare you a glance,’ she says, closes the folder and throws it on the table next to the fireplace.
'So what happened?'
‘I don’t know, Potter. I’ve never been here. Probably will have to explore a bit.’
'I really like your hair. It's almost white.'
'Harry, you're all dirty.'
and then he disapparated on the spot.
I don’t know for how long we’re sitting there but eventually I’m calm enough to realise my leg starts cramping and I disentangle myself from her, eyes dry.
And my brain just short-circuited, and I didn’t know what to say other than hum right back, feeling like a fool. Thankfully, he finally started talking, about his week and work and how Parkinson was making him go to a different bar every second night and how she always left with some man. He asked me few questions, but I was just so deep in the vacuum of my mind that I answered briefly, trying to focus where I was walking and definitely not on how near he was.
and left with door banging after him.
I, once again, because
'Hm.'
I nod. 'It was... you've been gone for a month and we had this party. I got drunk because... and she was there, kept... talking to me, and laughing and... and I went with her.'
Harry would like to hex anyone who came up with the idea because now he has to watch Malfoy doing weirdly named positions, like cobra, bow, a fucking camel or whatever. And all those hand and headstands, when all of Malfoy’s muscles tighten and Harry can see them constrict with the effort.
Kind regards,
Harry Potter
'God, yes, loads of them. I can show you some I took if you want.'
'What?! No, you're not. We're going to talk now.'
'Yeah, but I didn't ask you, it was of your own volition.'
'Are you okay?'
He couldn’t be clearer. All sleepiness disappeared and I looked up at him, his brow was raised in question like
He huffs. ‘Of course, you are, and you are also my guide, so speak.’
'So you got drunk because you were lonely and fucked her.'
‘I might have skipped that part.’
'The goblins hired new people, to delegate some less important work. There was a woman, we were supposed to work in the same office.' I hear him breathe out. 'It was fine at the beginning, she was nice enough...' I pause because his fingers grip the glass just a bit tighter. 'But then she made it obvious she liked me, she started flirting with me...'
‘No, you prat. Let’s be silent.’ So we stand there, listening to our breathing and sounds of party outside. I tap my foot in the rhythm of music.
‘Okay. I’m going to fly now. Come on Harry, you can watch!’ He takes my hand and is pulling me up. I laugh and stand up.
‘Hello Harry. You can put the bottle on the table, dear,’ says Andromeda as she pushes Teddy inside.
'Who says it's not strange for me?'
‘Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry…’
I’m developing a headache.
His hand shakes and few sparks fly out of his wand. 'It's not my business once the item leaves the shop, it's not mine anymore once it's paid for. I am not responsible for the customer's actions.'
'Of course. As your friend and confidant I think I deserve to judge whether she's good enough for our Saviour.'
It didn’t go on for as long as I’d want, he pulled away, blinked and then pecked me on the mouth, stood up, straightened his clothes, said goodnight and left while I was still sitting on the bench, completely out of my mind.
I am a little bemused. ‘And you don’t have any other picture just this one?’
'Good luck. He and Victoire already got a flat there.'
‘Well, you’re alive so obviously you did not kill each other and considering you spend several minutes together in a closed closet at Luna’s few days ago, one is wondering, you know?’ He grins even wider.
I stopped over for lunch at Andromeda’s. Well, she practically invited me the other day, so I don’t know why she looked surprised when she opened the door for me.
Her lip curls, just a tiny bit. ‘You know she doesn’t like me much. You only will be away, what, a week?’
, it was so funny,” she laughs. Harry thinks it isn’t that funny. The story, just as her – truly dull. Malfoy, on the other hand, chuckles and continues writing in the file.
'Yes, whatever. I'm way too old for this. I'll be forty by the time I'll be able to do anything of my own.'
and I wanted to say yes but then I remembered I was going to the Burrow and then I promised Ron we could test that dream charm again, and I started saying
Harry groans internally, deciding on his next words. “I should bring Malfoy his tea.”
'Good night kiss?'
'Sounds even better. Can't wait to obliviate myself.'
She fire-called me today.
'Then what was it?'
Then it starts to hail.
‘Potter,’ he says as a way of a greeting and gets out of the lift.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
‘The best,’ I murmur and she yanks me forward and hugs me again, much tighter than before.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'It's not like you'd tell me the truth even if you would.'
'Will you go with Wes?'
So, when we were playing hide and seek, I noticed a picture on her fireplace, tucked behind all the others. It was Malfoy with Teddy. Malfoy looked a little stiff, sitting on the sofa and Teddy on his lap, fidgeting, playing with the dragon I gave him, trying to roar into the camera. It was a very nice picture.
We walk for a while, see few other parts of the wall. I stop next to each, because he’s hungry and he doesn’t want to see any more of it. We end up in a restaurant, posh, just like Malfoy requests.
Immediately as he was back in his own body, he demanded I bring him lunch to his room. I ordered some takeaway for everyone and he said it was just grease on bread, so I shoved it at him and shut the door. Then he wanted tea and biscuits, then dinner, glass of water, he even demanded softer toilet paper and I’ve had just about enough for the day. The others kept giving me strange looks, but no one said anything. Except Ash who smirked with
I’m finally alone. I have a constant headache, third day running. There’s been so many people and questions – especially from the Ministry.
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
almost kissed
‘Potter,’ he slurs and smiles, ‘fancy seeing you here.’
'Oh fuck!' He's close and he's gripping my hair tightly, pulling me off. I go, reluctantly, kissing my way up to his mouth, slipping my tongue inside, swallowing his breaths.
He rolls his eyes. ‘What’s next on your crusade to annoy me? So far, mostly unsuccessful, I must say.’
He loves the sweat glistening on Malfoy’s chest and his messy hair. He loves his hand around him. He loves the heat between them, Malfoy’s cock in his ass and when it hits the spot on every other thrust. He loves the sounds coming out of Malfoy’s throat.
He eventually snatches his arm free. She faces him with that permanent fucking smile, raises her fingers towards him. This woman cannot take a hint.
'Yeah? What is it?'
I try again. ‘Malfoy, I understand that…’
'What's wrong?'
'Seriously, stop.'
‘Potter. What the actual fuck?’ I watch him as he strides in and paces from one end of the room to another. ‘I am waiting for an explanation!’ he snaps after I don’t say anything.
. I didn’t turn back, staring holes into the wall.
‘It means that recently you are obsessed with him, mate. Again,’ Ron supplies and lets Rose yank his hair and gurgle to herself happily.
He waves at me one last time and they’re off. He is scared of deep waters but he still dives in... I don’t understand him sometimes.
'Will there be any more horrid dancing attempts?'
He blames Malfoy. He kept visiting him those months ago when he was off duty. He made Harry think about him as though he was becoming his friend who cared whether he died or lived, even if when he kept saying he didn’t really care – he came because he was bored or to update him on a case or to see him looking ugly. And then they were both friendlier when Harry returned, and it just got worse from there.
'I've never been unfaithful to you before. I would never lie about it. I told you. And I wanted to tell you when you came back but I couldn't. You were home and alive and I forgot everything else. I wanted to have you for a while more.'
are, a true murderer.' It stings a little. I see disgust in the curve of his mouth. 'Did you come here so you'd feel better about yourself? Because you believe me a murderer too? Did you think if you'd make me confess my guilt it would vanish the blood on
'Yes.'
'Month ago? And you decided to tell me now?'
As though he’s been sinking this whole time but hasn’t realised the air was running out.
‘Why?’ he asks and props himself up, looking down at me.
'The woman you... that one.'
'Yeah, maybe.' He looks through the window. 'I still haven't got the promotion.' I knew, there would be articles. 'You were right.'
'You like my place. You lived there.'
Maybe, with time, as most things, even this will pass.
'Very funny.'
Auror Office
‘Nothing! He’s drunk, he came here and got sick,’ I defend myself.
Auror Office
‘Well, she just told me, so.’
and I shook my head and asked what he’s been up to, to which he narrowed his eyes and just said
and that was it.
Fucking awesome.
'No.'
'Yeah. Still plenty of time. And I went to order the invitations and we should have them here in two days.'
Draco L. Malfoy
She said that he wrote some letters – which she didn’t let me read – with apologies and
‘Yes,’ he whispers back and his breath tickles my ear.
'As I was saying, I was thinking, Clo and Bono adore each other so much that it breaks my heart when they're apart.'
'Like what?'
'So just get up and get it and stop making so much noise.'
'Hmm, is it?'
Whatever. If it will result in solving the case, then it’s worth withstanding Malfoy’s ire and presence. I hope.
He stares at me, incredulous. ‘You do realise I have to work, right? I can’t just go, gallivanting through Berlin whenever you set your mind on it.’
'Yes. Here is the invoice and I took some pictures.'
'I know.'
I am silent, just chewing and trying to burn a hole in Potter’s forehead, right next to his scar, but Andromeda looks at me and says ‘and you, Draco?’ and so I answer her. ‘Very much so. Can’t wait.’
I look at her. ‘Are you lying again?’
And if he is while I’m gone, then fuck him. I can’t sit here for who knows how long, in this stifling room with charmed fake windows and green robes that make my eyes sore. I can’t believe I missed a date with Astoria for this! Again!
Yeah, no. I’ll give it some more time and then, if it turns out awful, I’ll go from there.
I said between kisses.
‘Amazing! Thank you, gran! Now we are going to play to my room the new Gobstones you bought me,’ he kisses her cheek, turns around and says, ‘once you finish with your tea you can come upstairs, I will get everything ready.’ He darts out of the room, snitch flying behind him and stomping up the stairs.
‘Maybe a bit later yeah?’
'Oh, Zabini wanted to levitate the chocolate from the fountain all the way to his mouth, it was ten metres away. He was pretty sloshed at that point.'
and so I told him I just came to look around. He said he would be closing soon, to go. I asked him whether he planted the potions into the old witch’s basement and he, of course, denied it. So I asked then, whether I can look around some more, maybe behind the curtain, the back room. He said no and to quote he also said ‘fuck off, Potter’. I left, but not without ‘I’m keeping my eye on you, Malfoy’ which I think was a
'You're such a prick. Not that it's any of your business but I am really happy for her.'
He doesn’t say anything, just shrugs.
, which made them look at me all squinting and frowning. I laughed and said I was joking.
‘Yeah? Anything else?’ he leans forward too and kisses me briefly. Then the waiter comes back, we pay and we are leaving, Timothy is grabbing my hand and pulling me with him. Outside we apparate to mine and he’s undressing me and pushing me on the bed, kissing me, making me moan his name and keen in pleasure.
The moon is bright above his head.
Harry nods even though he doesn’t enjoy it at all, and she goes on. “Come on, there is a VIP box where we can talk!”
'Hey! You said I should try being happily single and so I am. And who's to say I won't find the love of my life in three months?'
‘Yes.’
'Is this why we didn't have sex for more than two weeks? Because you think I'm depressed?'
He turned around, saw me, smiled a little and said hello. And so that was the whole of my plan. Thankfully, Malfoy saved the situation – or better, he ruined it – by asking
‘I want you to come,’ I say, pull out, my fingers sneaking between her legs.
‘Well, if you say so. Does your girlfriend believe you?’
'That you were so in love with me you couldn't wait to propose and even asked him to help you with the ring. Which, considering, turned out to be to my liking.'
‘She just had her first child, so you know, she’s pretty busy now,’ she answers and her smile is a bit strained.
'What are you talking about? It went great.'
'Hi.' He sounds the same.
'Hey.'
'Thanks, I wasn't asking your opinion.'
'Malfoy... hello. What are you doing here?'
'Are you laughing?'
'And you left the dishes in the sink.'
Once he says
I wanted to ask where he was going, but I bit my tongue and dressed, very calmly. He left somewhere and didn’t come back, so when I was at the door I yelled
“One annoying, messy, specky git with horrid handwriting but amazing arse and coffee making skills.” Malfoy grins and Harry laughs, shockingly loud.
‘You like birds, do you? Which is you favourite?’ he asks.
but that he could find time this coming Saturday. So, that’s great.
'Because you are such a sucker for rules.'
'I mean, towards the end, but it was alright at the beginning. So, we'll see.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Clotilde tolerates him, at the most.'
'Potter. You are their family.'
'So you feel better than yesterday?'
Malfoy was fine with cancelling plans and asked me to bring him some chocolate.
“My English is good enough! You’re just a stuck-up!
'You didn't come to the party.'
‘Stop this, Draco,’ Pansy interrupts me, ‘I know where you’re going with this and it was not your fault. The fucker was a cheater and I repeat – that is not your fault, whatever the reason was, he should’ve told you upfront and break up with you,’ here the tears intensify for some reason and sobs start coming out. ‘Fuck. I’m sorry.’ She pulls me to her and hugs me, the position slightly uncomfortable.
‘So what?’ I look back at them, incredulous.
“I like it,” Harry says even if the only thing he really manages to notice is the bed and the blue sheets on it.
‘No, I had no idea you would be here, you prat,’ he hisses right back at me.
“I wish I would never have to speak with you, ever again. Tell me where it is then you can shut up.”
'Very hot.'
. She apparently asked them not to tell me because she wanted to see me. She missed me – as a friend, she made it clear – and wanted to remain friends but that I kept avoiding her.
'Then maybe order something vegetarian next time.'
'I will miss you.'
‘I’ll be right back,’ he says, touches my wrist and walks away from me, weaving through the crowd.
'Fuck...but it's your... jesus...'
Harry leans backwards, puts his hands on Malfoy’s thighs and pushes himself up and slams right back down. Malfoy growls and tightens his fist around Harry’s cock. Harry repeats the movement, faster and harder. Malfoy starts making small abortive thrusts with his hips. Harry can feel his restraint.
'By the way, I spoke to Weasley and he told me you told him.'
'And are you?'
‘I just wanted to go for a walk,’ I shrug.
'But it's so shabby... '
‘Well then,’ I interrupt him, ‘plenty of time to go sight-seeing, don’t you think? We have about ten hours.’
'I would, but you are not me, you're much more patient.'
‘Malfoy, stop. Just use the bathroom, take some pepper-up or something. Believe me, you’ll feel better,’ I try to reason with him as we stand there, door wide open, his fingers fisted in my shirt and my palm on his shoulder and I am afraid someone might see us and get the wrong idea.
‘Thank you,‘ she throws it back and makes a face. ‘I wanted to talk to you, actually. I read your article in the June issue of Precious Potions, very interesting.‘
'You should feel sorry, ashamed, a good person would.' There is no point. I know him well enough. We were friends. Somehow we found a way out of our school animosity into, at first, reluctant friendship. Then we started sleeping together. And then something happened and he started with the dark magic again, opened a shop under the pretence of honest business, selling objects of questionable origins... and the relationship changed, sour, even worse when we fucked. Worse because it was good and I wanted him, wanted to talk to him, kiss him, fuck him. I despise him for wanting all of it still, for disregarding everything I don't like about him.
‘You were so good,’ Pansy grabs her and then murmurs something in her ear. I take my leave to get mother and go home. The match is over so I don’t see a reason to socialize any longer.
I followed him today. I went to his shop and as I was nearing it, I saw him walking with Parkinson. Curiosity overtook me and I cast some quick charms over me so they wouldn’t notice me. They went to a club. I followed them inside. They met there with someone, as I got closer, I recognised them as Zabini, Goyle (looking extremely out of place) and Bulstrode.
‘What?’ I jump in, all pretence forgotten, and all the blood rushes to my face. ‘You must have heard wrong, I would never… Blaise, did I really say it?’
'Me neither. It's not easy for me, I always miss you.'
'Can't wait, darling.'
I snort, silently. ‘Oh. Good, thank you. Work is good, I can’t complain, really,’ he tells her.
‘I do, it’s delicious,’ I answer and smile back at him. It’s been a year we’ve been together and I feel like I know him for ages. We are perfect for each other, so similar in everything. I can’t imagine anyone better for myself. We are going to Italy in few weeks and I think it will be the best time to ask him. I didn’t tell anyone, I want it to be a surprise. I’ve got the ring already, matching his beautiful blue eyes.
‘Come on now, I would, your friends would, Narcisa surely…’
Can’t say this is the best day of my life, but it’s very close. Teddy is jumping up and down, pure joy, grinning when I hand him the snitch.
Ministry of Magic
'I don't know. You have more experience with these things than I do and based on that I think it's very possible.'
‘I want to go see that gold angel on a column, today,’ he says and lifts his chin up.
'Been on a date. Leaving just now.'
'So I was even lesser than an animal?'
and didn’t even look at me. I spoke about weather, what a nice day, he just hummed and sped up. I walked inside the shop with him where he finally turned to me and almost pushed me against the door as he was advancing, finger pointed right at me.
Harry Potter
I am not going to cry. 'Is this what you think of me?'
Auror Office
'What are you doing here?'
People bump into him. Someone spills a drink down his jumper. And she still catches him.
. Ron looked surprised but smiled and hit me on the back, saying
'I think I made my decision.'
'That didn't take too long.'
I apparated from the toilet right in front of his gate, behind a bush on the side of it. I was crouching there for couple minutes until I heard a pop and watched him opening the gate, waving his wand after he closed it. I went home when he was inside.
‘Well I didn’t! So you’re saying you don’t care she wanted Harry dead?’
Harry Potter
'Good. Sorry, Malfoy, I have to go, meeting Hermione. See you.'
Potter steps back, his nostrils flaring and without another word he walks out of the room.
‘Aunt Ginny said what?’ Potter asks when exactly at the same moment I say ‘we’re not friends’. Potter glares at me and mouths something at me which I think is ‘shut up’. So I mouth back at him ‘fuck you’.
I just grip him tighter. ‘No. You are getting on my nerves and if I have to hold your fucking hand for the rest of time for you to be still, then I will.’
'Blaise might have mentioned something about fourth year.'
'That son of a bitch. Lies, all lies.'
'Fuck you, Potter! Fuck off you utter shit!' His spit lands on my cheek and he's pushing the door closed with all his strength. 'You think you're so righteous, oh the Saviour, the Hero! Fuck you!'
His brain is probably damaged from the beating from the hails, because there’s no other explanation for what he does next. Because Malfoy just had his heart broken and Harry is an asshole who doesn’t know boundaries. Because he leans in just as Malfoy’s fingers are still touching Harry’s glasses. Because he kisses him, out of nowhere with a pounding storm around them. Malfoy’s lips are cold and soft as Harry’s lips finally touch them.
'Okay, okay. We need to stop. For real.'
Harry admires Malfoy’s ability to say this in one breath. “My mouth wasn’t open, and I was thinking about something.”
He’s so red in the face, the veins in his neck bulging. ‘Those are just standard terms of agreement. Nothing will happen to you or anyone else, we know what we’re doing, Malfoy.’
‘I will, anything for you, my favourite cousin,’ I tell him and I am oh so glad that Potter’s here, looking pretty annoyed right now.
'I love you, you know.'
'You must have drank something, Harry. No way you're this happy.'
It didn’t mean anything to Potter, Draco knows.
'We cut the grass.'
He wants to wrap around him, be inside him and be a part of him. He slips his hands lower, down to grab Malfoy’s cheeks and pulling him in. They collide, from thighs to lips, no space between them. He guides Malfoy’s hips to grind against his. Malfoy’s moan goes straight to Harry’s cock, and he pulls him even harder against his body.
‘That’s the point,’ I mumble, moving my mouth lower to his chest.
'Don't listen to this mean man, Bono. You're the cutest, yes you are!'
‘So Zabini is okay with this? I just don’t want him to accuse me of stealing you or something,’ she asks after she finishes her wine.
'Take a good look then.'
'I wish they'd be here.'
‘I did. They decided to go with someone else.’
more than anything. He’s so close and yet so far. His palms on my hips, flexing fingers. He barely dances, just moves from side to side. I can dance for both of us, then. But if I do, he will let go and I cannot stand it. So, I move from side to side with him, barely dancing.
'I obviously cannot do anything about Bono, I guess I can vacuum more after him and Clo, because she is not innocent in this either. But I stand behind the sitting room, it's comfy and homey but you can change the curtains, they were a mistake.'
'Where are you going?'
'I'm not telling you. Surprise me.'
We find out it is a nightclub near the main railway station, mostly opened only during the weekends. I send Ash and Reynards to scout the area, outside and inside. They come back in the evening, reporting it is apparently pretty large area to cover. There are six aurors on the mission, so it’s decided we’ll take night shifts to monitor the building, just in case, in pairs. Tonight, it’s me and Julie and I cannot wait to leave this house and Malfoy.
. He mumbled into my hair
'No...yes, maybe, I don't know. I think about you, what you might be doing and with whom... The doubt is there and it's huge. I can't just... make it disappear.'
'Who?'
I sit on my sofa and then decide to lie down for a minute to avoid a headache I feel coming. Just a moment of peace before I must work.
'Do you want to go again.'
I managed to put that night in a dark corner of my brain, forget it because it was weird and awkward and not entirely unpleasant and he didn’t remember it and I didn’t want to remember it by reminding him either. But now here it is again, at the forefront. Here
'Not what you said last Christmas.'
'I meant the happy part. What's happy about not getting over your ex?'
'You know how to compliment a person, Malfoy, I give you that.'
‘What are you doing?’ he asks, still holding the doorknob.
‘Accio wand,’ I say, extending my arm, hoping it will land in my hand soon. I see it flying away from the guy who took them.
Every time Potter only as much as glances him somewhere, he runs.
Harry Potter
He just stands there for a moment, looking at me with the sneer still on until finally, he grabs my forearm and I turn on the spot with him right beside me.
'I know what I want to do with my allotted free time.'
'Good night.'
I needle him about it. ‘Never been in a gallery, Potter? You can’t just grab everything with your greasy fingers.’
'I don't adore him. He's disgusting, look at him.'
'Alright, I will.'
'How's Bono?' I can't bear the silence.
'Thanks for being supportive.'
'What? You thought I was cheating?'
'Nice. A lot of fun, Hermione went a little wild as the evening was progressing but, considering, was to be expected I guess.'
'I don't know. However you want.'
‘Yes.’ She thanks Ron when he puts her mug and three muffins next to her on the table. ‘Maybe if you two would talk things out or change both your attitudes towards each other, he might be prompt with you two.’
'Of course you're not.'
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'So how did it go?'
‘Mhm! It’s delicious gran. Just like when Draco makes it.’ Teddy’s mouth is half-full when he speaks, and I think I will have to teach him some more table manners.
‘So how are you?’ Ron interrupts the silence. ‘I noticed this week you’ve been a little off.’
‘No,’ she shakes her head just as I hiss ‘no’ as well, ‘probably just the not so suppressed hatred.’
Today I had lunch at the Burrow. I love Sundays at the Burrow.
Hermione kept watching me the whole time until she let it slip that
I feel dazed.
I am so tired. Exhausted. All this international travel... Thank god I’m home.
'Come on! You are so cute right now.'
‘I’m not mad,’ I answer, just a little miffed with them. Blaise extends his arm and thumps a part of my back he can reach. ‘You’re such jerks.’
He might shriek a little. “Malfoy! Fuck. What are you doing here?”
Harry Potter
'Well, could've been worse.'
‘People change,’ he says and drinks.
'Nothing's going on.'
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
Malfoy’s hair sticks to his skin in places and his lips look pillowy and soft. Harry wants to lick that glittering space above them. Harry wants to smell and kiss his pink cheeks, put his own cheek next to it to feel the skin.
We stand in front of Quality Quidditch, staring for almost ten minutes at the newest Nimbus 6000k. I mean, it looks great, but for how long can a child watch one broomstick for?
I take his books, scattered all around the place, and throw them in the fire. And just like that, they’re gone.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
I clench my jaw. ‘I am not your house elf.’
I said I wouldn't come anymore, that we were done, that I was done with him, never wanting to see his face again. Yet here I am. Again.
she said and so I turned to her, being polite, said hello back and felt my face flame hot red. She continued with
‘If you wish,’ I smile sweetly and watch him cringe while I do some sharing of my own.
‘I promise you Ron, the first thing I’ll do when I see her is going to make sure she isn’t planning Harry’s demise any time soon, otherwise that really would be a deal breaker.’ She takes my hand and swings it between us. ‘Bros before hoes, right?’
'What? No. I wanted to. I want to live with you.'
‘The plums Draco, of course, what else?’ She laughs like it’s so obvious.
At last, he straightens and grabs the file back. ‘Malfoy,’ I say, ‘I promise all will be alright.’
'So who did you choose?'
He halts, barely for a second, then closes the door and I’m alone once more.
'You're older than me.'
'He's trying to bite her! Bad crup! That's enough.'
'As much as I would love for your beast to eat from my plate, I have to decline.'
And I know I have no right. We agreed this was all it was. He made it clear he didn't want to get back together, but that
Teddy doesn’t let him finish. ‘Isn’t it just? I wanted the new Nimbus, but Draco didn’t want to buy it for me. Will you buy it for me, Harry?’ And what a gall, his hair turns black and messy.
'Not in those words!'
'Come on now.'
'Oh please. Tell that to someone who would actually believe you. I can see your face, how you look at her... don't worry, I won't tell but you can not either.'
'What?'
'You will get it, Harry.' I lean forward, I want to touch his hand.
‘I work mornings, sometimes very early mornings. Besides, you never tell me to stay, you just turn on the other side and keep on sleeping.’
'Either way, I can always ask her to help me make more.'
She tilts her head to the side. ‘Well, just that you and Timothy broke up because he cheated on you with his diving instructor. He definitely has a lot of Wrackspurts flying around his head now.’
Well, that definitely doesn’t sound like Malfoy. “Er, thanks for the offer, but no, thanks.”
‘I’m good, thank you. How are you?’ I ask, putting my best smile on.
Auror Office
I kept thinking about previous evening, barely focusing on conversations around me.
'Stay... if you want.'
'Harry?'
“That’s great,” he smiles, and he thinks he doesn’t quite manage it when Malfoy frowns at him. “We were just heading out to lunch, so,” Harry points to Ron.
“Why did you? You’ve never said.”
‘Yes, indeed,’ I regard her and sip my tea.
'I knew you'd love it!' She hugs me and then the others start wishing me all the best. Hermione, who looks apologetically at me and says: 'I tried to stop it, Harry, I did. Bit it was just too much Weasleys, even for me.' Ron hugs me too, pushing beer in my hand which I gratefully take and drink almost half of it in one go. Luna's here, her hair wildly flowing around her, smelling like dirt and grass and I can barely hear her in all the mingling voices and music as she advices me to go erumpents seeing to clear my mind. Neville is next, and then George and Bill and Angelina, Fleur and Seamus and Dean, and others.
Draco L. Malfoy
I walk to the bar and grab Malfoy’s sleeve to follow me. He goes but his steps are reluctant.
'Look at the colour.'
Kind regards,
‘Didn’t ask for your opinion.’
'Really? That's great! When?'
This is more pleasant than I expected. It was awkward at the beginning, we never interact too much, just occasional small talk whenever we manage to bump into each other during my few Ministry visits. But once we started talking – well she started talking about my research – it was easy, it was work. And now, when it nears to an end I start feeling the awkwardness again.
‘Of course. Something to eat?’
People say Ron’s obtuse, but he’s more observing than they give him credit for.
'What do you want to do?'
On Friday we almost kissed or I think
'You were lonely because I was gone so much. Who's fault is it?' He asks and I hate myself even more.
I know the moment those words leave my mouth how pleased he is. ‘I don’t think this is a necessary information for you. But if indeed it is, ask Granger.’ With that he turns around and walks away, his robes swishing behind him.
'No.'
'We just change... we cannot change anything, the wedding is in seven months.'
Ministry of Magic
The second time he wakes up, he’s laying on his side with Malfoy behind him. They fuck again, slow and lazy in the early hours of the morning. Malfoy keeps him close the whole time, touching him everywhere he can reach. Harry keeps him just as near when Malfoy pants in his ear.
'What a praise, Harry, thank you.'
At the beginning, Potter’s lips were hard and reluctant, like he already hated that he did it, that he allowed himself to get that close to Draco.
We still have a lot of paperwork to do, so I didn’t even stop to breathe since we came back, but I’m going to see Teddy tonight - I bought him a plush dragon toy.
He’s about to fall asleep again when Malfoy speaks: “I broke your nose in sixth year.”
‘Oh god, thank you,’ she says and laughs. ‘I must be drunk!’ That’s when Potter appears out of nowhere and glares at my hand still on her arm.
‘Right back at you,’ I smirk and fall back on the chair. ‘I hope now we’re clear.’
Once the tour ends, I sit in one of the pews, looking at the altar. Potter takes the other side and we sit and look. I glance at him from time to time, he keeps turning his head this way and that, looking at people and the ceiling, looking everywhere.
'Me too.'
'Yes...there...'
“No,” Harry answers and looks at him again.
'Of course you can.'
'No. They are your family and you are theirs. Don't make me go all nice about the Weasleys, Potter. All of them love you like you'd have their ginger hair and this is the only thing I'll say.'
Malfoy’s eyes narrow at her. She sips her coffee and doesn’t provide any explanation.
I try to remember exactly what I said, how I said it, how many times and whether it was that most damning thing. ‘Do you?’
‘I like peacocks,’ I say the first that comes to my mind, ‘they have nice feathers. Which bird is your favourite, Malfoy?’
and I said (even though I knew he was dismissing me)
He then kissed my thigh and hip and stomach, and I grabbed him by his arms and kissed him. I was thinking we would just lounge there, in front of the fire, maybe he would bring something sweet and maybe we would do it again. He was so pliant; his hands were everywhere, and we were kissing for a long time and I just wanted to kiss for longer. But then,
'No.'
, slowing down, teasing smirk on her face.
He turns, at last, looks at me. I'm still naked, rooted to a place next to his bed, staring back at him.
'What do you think they would say?'
horny and Malfoy was
“Are you all right?” asks Ron. Harry’s almost forgotten he’s been there the whole time and that they are going to get lunch.
'Keep it, Potter. Have a great night.'
'Hm?'
Jacoby smirks. ‘Wouldn’t you like to know. I guess you will have to figure it out yourself, it’s a secret recipe, after all.’
‘I’ll talk to them. I’m being discharged tomorrow, so then.’
‘Well, then you tell her and you’ll break up and when that happens, Draco and I will come and rescue you from your sorrow. But until then we will save all the drama and crying. Yes?’ He stands up and brings Pansy’s mug.
Draco watches them and cold turns to dread.
she said while I was probably gaping.
'And you suggested I quit, you gave me the idea.'
'Like what?'
'What are you talking about? Bono is my friend.'
, looked around more, laughed when he found a shelf dedicated to only Quidditch books, magazines and memorabilia with
'Am I? So come on, now. Fuck me and get it over with since it's all my fault.'
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'Potter!'
‘Not like this.’
'It is my job! How many time am I supposed to defend myself about this?'
'You have no idea how much.'
I make him moan.
Potter rips the brochure from my fingers and frowns. ‘Gallery? Why?’
'Yeah, but I want to go again. We have only two days left.'
if I have some suspicions.
It was surprising though how strong he actually is. He manhandled me, made my lie on the bed – I have to admit it was pretty arousing and if I wasn’t hard before, that would do it. He lied on top of me, warm and solid and I opened my mouth then, saying
'So sweet.'
I can't supress the groan escaping my mouth when I come, pointless, really. I slump down on his back, my hand around his cock trapped between him and the bed. I don't want to move, ever. But he does. He pushes me off and turns on his back, slaps my hand away. I watch, his red splotched chest and face, sweaty forehead where his hair is sticking to.
Harry’s breathing quickens as his fingers reach Malfoy’s hips. The trousers are low, and his hipbones are jutting out. Harry looks up and Malfoy nods. He takes them off, pants and all. Malfoy stands there naked, in front of him. Just as Harry’s imagined these last endless months. Malfoy is hard and Harry sees his stomach clench when his knuckles brush Malfoy’s cock.
He loves the pain of seeing him with someone else.
He sees me and I see his jaw tighten. He walks towards my table and sits down.
'If that's why you came, you didn't have to bother, I know.'
He snatches the thing out of my hand and looks inside, humming to himself and nodding. ‘Yes, that.’
Scamper away, Potter. Go enjoy the fireworks.’
‘What’s that supposed to mean? I asked, so obviously I want to know. Spill.’ He turns his whole body towards me and I wish he didn’t because I already know I’m telling him, I need to tell someone and he’s here, waiting. I just wish we would not see each other at this moment.
'I just wanted to look at you. Without anyone else looking at you.'
. He asked why and I told him
'Wow.'
Harry Potter
and she grinned again with
'Will you ever stay home for more than a week?'
‘And you let me leave with him? What if something happened and he’d killed me?’ I am completely disgusted with myself.
‘Will you? So, I suppose you won’t have to eat?’ asks Andromeda.
‘Ron told me he couldn’t say, George swore him to secrecy, apparently,’ she whispers and sips her wine.
“Give it to me. Your Reparo is shit.” Malfoy snatches it away and spells them as good as new.
I mean, fine, we played less rough, considering Teddy was playing with us so we had to adjust some things, but all the same, we won. And I thought the best thing was the look on Potter’s face when Teddy chose me for his team.
“Yeah.” There’s a silence for a long while. “Well, I just wanted to explain.”
‘Merlin, you’re twelve!’ I snap and march away from him.
'You do. You said it yourself, last year, on your birthday.'
Malfoy was not happy when I came around and I felt nauseous for some reason. I put the bust on his countertop, and he grimaced.
, I know, but I obviously can’t help myself when I want to find out what he’s truly up to.
‘Hm. I will let you know, okay?’
'I can take the exams after two years apprenticeship. Utter bullshit.'
'You say you're hot... yet after this, you...will be definitely...hotter... There, again.'
‘Whatever. Just be there at four,’ he says and with that he turns to leave.
Few drinks later and we were stumbling to bed together.
I smirk as Potter flounders, mumbling something unintelligible, probably trying to spare the child of the truth of our animosity.
'No, none of this. You will be excited and you will do the apprenticeship and you will be the best potion brewer there is.'
Malfoy stands up and waves his hand vaguely in the direction of Harry’s shelves. “Look into that mess, I remember it was poking from somewhere.” He puts on his robes, waves his wand and all things on his desk put themselves in order. It even smells nicer there and Harry grits his teeth.
Malfoy steps out and his fingers curl in Harry’s jumper. He tugs Harry close. “I meant we should really get to the sex now, talk later.” Before Harry has any chance to respond, Malfoy kisses him for the second time that evening.
‘So, since when are you going to muggle galleries?’ Potter shakes his head, most probably in disbelief.
'It's so beautiful.'
'Now we watch them and should we see they try to maim each other, we intervene.'
'Okay.'
When he reaches the last one, Harry moves forward. He slips it down his shoulders and drops it on the floor. He puts his palms on Malfoy’s skin and maps out his chest, the scar under his clavicle, shoulders, arms, belly.
We talk more, Teddy boasts about his grades and friends, Andromeda is happy with her baking endeavours, Potter talks also but I’m trying not to listen, I talk about my real work and not much else. I might be little paranoid, but I don’t want for Potter to know anything more about me, lest he decides I am up to no good whenever he sets his mind on me.
'Maybe I will if you'll be like this.'
‘Draco! What a catch!’ Pansy says, ‘ugh, you’re sweaty, no hugs.’
Yeah, we might never get back together. Ever.
‘Er. What do you mean?’ I touch my forehead. Not too hot.
They finally bring us our meals. It’s delicious.
'No one else can go. I am the Head Auror, I have to take responsibility.'
Teddy flies, his face pure joy.
'So where is she? I think introductions are in order.'
'What? What's with the last name?'
‘Mhm.’
I don' want him to see me cry in case that happens.
‘Oh really? What success?’ I ask and sip on my drink.
He knocks for the third time and is seriously considering just apparating inside, the wards be damned. He finally hears some muttering behind the door when it swings open. There stands Malfoy, still in the clothes from the party. “What do you want?”
'Yes.'
From then on, it all went fast. We were basically just grinding against each other, only used our hands, and it is embarrassing how fast I came, now that I think about it. Once he came too, he rolled off next to me, breathing heavily, I turned to him and we kissed for a while. I was getting sleepy, and we were still tangled together, I had my face in his neck because he just smelled so good and then, when I was
I push away from the bar, aiming for the stairs. I wait for Malfoy when I reach the top, who is still slowly marching up. It’s less crowded and noisy here, but while waiting, I’ve already spotted two couples having sex, right there near the banister. When Malfoy finally arrives, his breathing heavy, he spots them too.
'I do, it's beautiful. Do you have one?'
‘Okay, I’m going to make some tea. Do you want something?’ Hermione asks as she makes her way to the kitchen.
‘I’m glad you do,’ I answer, a little bemused. They met just twice, as far as I know, I was present once only and it was all very cold and polite.
I asked him to say what he wanted, and he didn’t and it’s not my fault he kept his mouth shut!!
'Oh Merlin. Fine, give it.'
I took a day off and am ready to fall asleep in my nicely enough smelling bed.
Harry pounds forward several times and finishes quickly, helpless. The intensity takes his breath away.
'Yes. Look at her. Isn't she just so different?'
'Okay now, mate. No one's taking your love away,' I say and Ron throws a peanut at my head. Ginny and I laugh, Ron scowls.
'I'm going to kiss all that pink skin. Every inch.'
‘That’s what I meant.’ I am speechless for a while and I don’t notice the waiter when he delivers my plate. I look at Potter and he is already eating his shepherd’s pie.
‘No, absolutely not,’ I shake my head.
and stupid, so I leave him there and walk away to take Teddy home.
And her accent! Harry hates it, it’s annoying because it’s coming out in her shrill voice. He especially hates when Malfoy starts speaking French to her. He imagines all sorts of things. He probably tells her some sweet nothings. But Malfoy’s French - Harry likes. Possibly too much.
'Yeah, sometimes, more often in the past. Now, occasionally.'
'I mean, I understand...'
'Draco! Stop!'
'Now like a sister not then, you git.'
and disapparated.
'I'm not making anyone come to my shop and buy whatever they want. People have free will, Potter, I believe even you should be familiar with the concept.'
So I say so and the only thing I get is a glare and another five minute tirade.
'Excuse me?' There's nothing else I can say.
God, I can’t believe it!!
He busies himself with making the drinks and eventually, because he does start feeling like a jerk and he doesn’t appreciate it, he asks her if she wants something too.
'Yet you still let me. Let's cuddle.'
She sneaks up to Harry from behind and screams into his ear: “Harry! Thank you for coming! Are you enjoying yourself?”
'Appropriately, of course. And then, when the reception is over and we will be left alone, we'll do all sorts of inappropriate things.'
Auror Office
He is perfect for me.
He nods and smiles wider, switching to English. ‘Please, if you can give us your wands. For security.’
'Harry...' And I can't say anything else.
“No, no. I told him the first time we met, and he didn’t have any complaints.”
'Has everyone left already?'
'I hoped, but you never said, after...'
‘By the way,’ I start, ‘we have a meeting tomorrow, there was a new fraction detected in Aberdeen, we think it’s the same group. Will you be able to come?’
We just sit for a while, the only sound the burning logs in the fireplace.
'I...'
I can’t believe in a week, my life will be endangered, and my girlfriend and friends are going about their lives like nothing’s happening. I don’t care what they say, I am right about this and it will serve them right if I'll come back damaged.
‘He didn’t, yet,’ I say just as Weasley strides in.
‘What?’ he asks when he notices me staring.
Malfoy proceeds to strip out of his shirt. He watches Harry with hooded eyes. Harry is looking at his hands as he works the buttons open, one after another, so slow it makes Harry’s skin burn.
'So you'll miss Hugo's birthday then, Teddy's quidditch game and lunch with my mother.'
I am warm and in a good mood in no time. I try to talk to everyone, we sit in groups, chatting and drinking and eating. It's nice.
'Hey! I'll help, you promised I can do some things.'
But Potter shakes his head. ‘I’m afraid not. From what Ginny says, only on national team. So, by the time you get there, you probably will have to learn to make at least a toast, Ted.’
‘Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Potter. I hear it’s uncomfortable.’
I shower, using a big amount of his soap. And if I haven’t before than I definitely smell like him now.
'Did you walk Bono today?'
He grumbles something to himself as I order beers, not caring if he’ll drink it.
'Merlin, this is getting way too soppy for me.'
Malfoy opens his mouth, but Harry doesn’t hear anything because there are people rushing inside, Hermione and Ron, Molly and Ginny.
'Two months.'
'Okay. Good night then.'
'You don't find this weird?'
should be stroking something else.'
Malfoy goes to work, works, then at about 6pm closes the shop and then at about 7pm goes home. He lives in the Manor. I tried to follow him inside, but he has wards around the monstrosity, and I didn’t want to dismantle them in case he would notice.
'Oh. No.'
He looks at me then. ‘True.’ Then his gaze travels down and he smirks. ‘I see you managed to eat my appalling pie.’
'What's up with me? Well Potter, thank you for asking, I am doing pretty well, unlike you it seems. '
‘Malfoy!’ he grits, stands up and I vanish the blanket. He looks outraged.
'Haha, very original.'
Blaise Zabini
I flip us around, her thighs around my waist and arms around my shoulders, skin to skin. ‘Fuck me how you want,’ she whispers, ‘fast and hard, however you want.’
'Is she still working with you?'
“Why don’t you then?” Harry asks and runs up to him.
'No, I went there to get my job back. I am starting this Monday.'
He hoped it would be him where he would rest his head whenever he wanted, from then on.
Once we’re finished and we’re outside, Malfoys walks immediately. We don’t talk, he walks in front of me, definitely not lost. After an hour we make it to the column, it’s tall and golden and Malfoy looks up and opens his mouth like he wants to say something but doesn’t and instead walks closer.
I mean, I really don’t think I am an asshole. It’s my duty.
‘Why did you come? You usually just send it.’ I don’t know why I try talking to him. Maybe it’s what Ginny said, or Hermione, whatever. I’m not going to try too hard anyway.
‘How would you know, standing hundred meters away?’
The assignment went great, we ended up in a wand fight but managed to arrest two of the witches, the third one fled but we tracked her down and brought her in as well. Jonson and I celebrated with kirsch because she said it was one of their traditional drinks and the morning we were leaving I also bought a box of chocolates.
'So?' I ask back. 'Will you let me in?'
‘None of your business.’
And I think –
'Wow. It's great! Congratulations. But let's face it, it's more of a present for you, after all. You deserve it. I should give you something.'
I devour him. I push and pull and he goes. He gives back the same to me. He tugs my head back, deepens the kiss. I moan, shamelessly, paying it no mind. He pulls back, I guess to take a breath, silently opening his mouth but I chase after him, putting my lips back on his. He doesn’t protest, he lets me. And when he wants to take some air in his lungs yet again, I allow him the smallest inch of space between us before I kiss him anew.
The bust remains hidden in the attic, safe and ugly and not cursed .

Towards the end he demands I go harder, so I do, making him growl and writhe beneath me until I come inside him, grinding to a stop.
Blaise snorts. ‘It’s like you think we are stupid or something. If you want to talk, you can always talk to us. Right, Pansy?’
He laughs. ‘Yeah, they’re angels.’
, went to Malfoy’s shop today, because the whole sex thing left a sour taste in my mouth and he didn’t send an owl or fire-called or anything since then.
'You should get ready to clean the house for a month.'
on the spot, all
‘One yes is enough!’ I snap at him.
'I already am, sorry I didn't wait for your permission.'
‘You could’ve helped him, Harry,’ says Ginny next to me. ‘Holding his hair or something.’ She rummages in the cabinet and takes out a vial, handing it to Parkinson. ‘Well, some people are lightweights. Will you stay here Pans?’
'How was your day?'
, we’re still going to hang out together. Like tonight.
’ and leaves, the door slamming behind him.
“I don’t want to talk about it. You made it clear what you still think of me.”
I unbutton my shirt.
'Of course I am.'
'Okay?'
I don’t know what just happened. I was having a perfectly fine afternoon and now in two weeks I’ll get all sweaty playing quidditch with all the Weasleys imaginable and Potter? I think not.
I push closer, put my head on his shoulder, smelling his neck. His hands move around my waist, to my back, pressing. I breathe him in and smile. I brush my nose along his jaw and see him swallow. I kiss him there, just a brush of lips, barely noticeable. But he notices and tilts his head. I kiss lower, his skin so hot. Then I turn my head away, close my eyes and wait. My fingers playing with the black hair at his nape.
‘It is Saturday, so, I guess not.’ I gaze at him as he grins.
We spend about two hours there. It’s past noon when we step outside.
We're silent while there's noise all around us. He drinks his coffee, finishes and then slumps back in his chair.
‘Thank Merlin. I was worried for a second,’ he shudders, ‘look, Rosie is finally falling asleep.’
Somehow, she still managed to persuade me. I just got ready, Ron and Hermione are waiting downstairs and I decided to write a little just to delay the inevitable a bit.
'The last one, really. The last, Draco.'
'You think kissing will make me forget?'
‘Because you’re my partner, girlfriend, lover? Because you love me and cannot imagine your life without me?’ I look up at her and she laughs.
So I drink and eat more and my head empties – all is gone except here and now.
and led me to the door, didn’t even accompany me to the gate.
'You don't have to persuade me.'
. I tried to push it away by pushing my face in a pillow as forcefully as possible, but it was still there, mixing with Bill’s face and the guy’s who gave me his phone number and Ginny’s and Hermione’s colleague’s and Cho’s  until it finally settled on Malfoy again and the only thing I wanted was to go to sleep.
'Great.'
‘What?’
'Nothing. Just...it's sort of unbelievable. We're all getting old.'
“Potter,” Malfoy grumbles just as Harry is few steps away. Harry turns and watches his mouth open and close multiple times, until he settles on: “I’m just tired.”
'Thank you, Potter! If it meets your approval it must be amazing.'
and shooed me away because she needed to work.
That was one of the possibilities, but I was really hoping it wouldn’t come to that when we were planning this night.
When I look at him, I see perfection. His perfectly styled hair, immaculate style, great cologne, wealth and security, his fit body. I want him, right now. Shame we’re in the restaurant. So at least I rub my ankle on his calf under the table. He grins, his perfect teeth on display.
'Yeah. Might be worth it.'
‘Nothing curious, just random occurrences that I was most often then not forced in,’ I huff, affronted.
At this point, he would take a nightmare over a sex dream. It’s excruciatingly difficult to go to work and pretend he doesn’t dream of Malfoy almost every other night, naked in his bed, doing all sorts of things. It’s also still hard to believe that he wasn’t hexed.
'It wasn't your fault! I told you...'
Wednesday, I came earlier (after his stalkery comment) and went inside. He had a customer, so I was free to look my fill. I peeked into the vitrines, the displays and couldn’t really find anything odd. I even accomplished getting into the back room – when there was no one around he took my wrist and pulled me inside, we snogged until we heard the door opening and he left to service the person and I was able to investigate. There were multiple cursed artefacts, labelled and under protection spells and I wanted to take a closer look, but the person left, and he came back and I grabbed him by his neck and kissed him and we were kissing till he decided to close early. We went to the park, intentionally this time I think, we talked and kissed and then he stood up, said goodnight and left.
Harry’s perplexed. “I thought Malfoy was showing you around already.”
'Of course I did.'
He wraps his thighs around me. I touch him and feel he's still wet from when I was opening him with my tongue few moments ago. I put just one finger in and he sighs and I'm gone.
‘Did she let you know she’s in London?’
Only after, when I lie in bed and he’s putting his clothes back on, do I wonder whether Malfoy and the woman will be in the club the next time I’m there too.
'Month ago, when you were on that assignment.'
'Tough luck then.'
Harry embraces him and breathes in Malfoy’s scent, fresh and sweet. It’s everywhere, on his skin and hair, under his arms and between his thighs and Harry’s head is full of it. It’s quickly becoming his favourite smell.
‘I’m going to pretend you didn’t say anything.’ She stands up, still holding my hand and drags me to the kitchen. ‘It’s your favourite, filet mignon.’ We enter the kitchen and I can smell only a slight odour of burnt meat. ‘Sit down, I’ll get you a plate.’
‘So there are no misunderstandings, Potter,’ he tilts his chin up like the haughty git he is.
'Okay, I have to go. I love you.'
It was him who asked to meet. To talk. I think... no, I don't think anything. I don't want to think anything.
still here, lying innocently in those blue sheets, the man who allowed it to happen. The man I know, no matter how many times I will try to stop myself, I will seek and come to. Again and again and again.
I tried to visit Malfoy, just for a fun of it. He looked normal, even talked to me, but there was no usual kissing. We confirmed Saturday, he said to come to the Manor, I said okay and then he had a witch walk in, carrying a miniature window. I left and I really can’t say that I’m looking forward to this weekend.
He keeps staring at him, across the Ministry atrium, as Malfoy talks to some witch. He’s very animated and smiles a lot. Harry grinds his teeth.
I can't help it. When the days get hard, I always come to him.
Harry kisses him again because they should kiss all the time.
Malfoy’s mouth moves, but Harry can’t hear. Just as he wants to help, send a Scourgify at him, Malfoy also stomps away without a single word.
and it was only few minutes till closing (I came later than usual) and soon enough, we were outside, the bust shrunk in my pocket.
'It is what I have to want.'
I eat a piece and it’s good so I tell him: ‘You should stay with aurors. You lost touch with the snitch and this pie is abysmal.’
Now, he watches them dance, swirling around, smiling at each other and his heart aches.
Well, could’ve been worse, considering. I expected some shouting and curses, but Malfoy was just blankly polite and cold. I had to excuse myself halfway through the training for a meeting with Kingsley and now I am finishing documentation for Malfoy’s clearance and equipment and all else.
He said
'Really? Glad to see you're moving on.'
Not even in that one moment, one night, did they really say much.
'I can't wait to look through Narcissa's many expressions.'
'Hello.'
‘Yes we did.’
'What do you want for Christmas?'
I came to take the box right before he was closing the shop. He muttered something about being on time but brought it from the back room. He opened it and it started playing and gold sparks were flying out from its mirror at the bottom. It was very nice. I thanked him and paid the rest of the money.
so I shrugged and sat down as well and somehow I ended up having dinner with him. He kept glowering the whole time, except when he was chewing.
'Hm?'
I don’t care if this is just for tonight or few more days or hours. I will take whatever. Because I don’t want to let go. If he does, that’s another matter. I will let him, I will watch him leave, I will wait until I’ll go cold completely.
'Yes.'
'Yes.'
'Potter! They were perfect! What did you do?'
'Do you ever think about it?'
‘Exactly,’ Pansy agrees and sighs dramatically. ‘Plus, Ginny and I did have a pretty spectacular fight.’
I am an hour into the game when they return.
He doesn’t expect it when Malfoy helps him stretch his legs alongside his. Or when Malfoy then manoeuvres them and guides Harry’s cock inside of him, wet and ready. Or when he kisses him and keeps kissing him.
'There are none. I don't want to kiss any of my friends.'
He walks backwards, pushing me down on a chair, kissing me some more and then leaving me, carrying on with the food.
'I hate you. So much.'
“Definitely. I don’t think we should talk about it now.” Malfoy says, hand still on the door.
‘Okay. But you can’t go alone. One of us must supervise you,’ he tells me and I bristle.
'Yeah?' I murmur and he pulls his legs higher and closes his eyes and my heart aches. I kiss him wherever I can reach. I release his hands and he pushes his fingers in my hair, the other palm on my back and I know it will end soon and I don't want to let go but it's inevitable.
'I knew it! You think I'm fun!'
‘I am.’ She withdraws her hand and looks at Ron who raises his brows. ‘I can see you guys having your inner mental dialogue about me, you know?’ I eye them. ‘I know what I’m doing. Don’t worry.’
‘So, Parkinson huh?’ he starts while we’re walking away from the stadium, ‘why?’
. She nods and then we talk about how Hugo is starting talking while we watch him play with George and Rose.
Everyone’s acting so normal I want to scream. This cannot become a thing.
So, he led me inside, he made Shephard’s Pie (during several conversations about food we’ve had, I mentioned it was my favourite, so it was actually sweet of him to remember) and when we were sitting down I asked him about that evening. Literally what I said was:
'And I know, I know, we argue a lot, especially these last months but that doesn't mean I don't love you. I love you and I want to argue with you and then make up and do it all over again.'
‘Are you looking forward to the trip, boys?’ Andromeda asks out of nowhere.
‘I thought you wanted to cuddle,’ I gasp out between kisses when he strokes me until I’m hard.
'That's a bit pessimistic.'
‘I cooked dinner,’ she says. ‘Enough for two.’
'Here you go.'
'What are you doing?'
Two, Harry has not spoken about it to Malfoy. Malfoy isn’t stupid so he must know what she’s like, she hasn’t tried to hide any of it. Harry doesn’t understand why he still wants to spend time with her when she’s so obvious. Even now they’re together – where, Harry doesn’t know because no one told him, just as many other times these last weeks.
Is this some sort of rebound? Am I just lonely?
'She wanted a break, just that. But then she never came back and I let her be, giving her time. I thought she would come back to me, like always. But she didn't... and found Zabini and forgot about me.'
He takes the note.
'Don't talk to me like I'm your crup! Now what?'
'Seriously?'
'Yeah.'
'I think it looks promising, she stopped trying to scratch him.'
'Yeah, I could eat something.'
‘No. if you want to know, read it yourself,’ I tell him and walk away.
I don’t know where we’re going and Potter is no help, so in need, I ask a passer-by. He shows me how to get there, moving his arm in confusing directions, adding some German word here and there. I try to follow his advice but end up in front of some church instead where people are taking photos and which was the main picture of one of the brochures.
Will have to keep an eye on him.
'Don't play dumb. You are all understanding, never complain, you let me choose everything for the sitting room!'
‘Did she catch the snitch?’ I ask.
'You did? Why?'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Can I see?'
'Well when you beg so nicely, Potter, how could I refuse?'
I linger too long, watching him. He must hear me because he turns and his expression falls. I should’ve left, I think, that’s what is expected and polite.
‘What are you, twelve? I’m not you, so that wouldn’t happen.’
He yearns for Potter and it’s slowly killing him because Draco’s nothing to him.
Neville said, while already three drinks in, that he’s thinking of proposing to Hannah. We all encouraged him to do it, placing bets when or if that would happen, Neville was flushing the whole time, grinning, saying
As a parting words on Sunday, he said from the open doorway
I only hum and drink the water that the waiter brought.
'No that's it for now.'
I watch his face as he comes, eyes squeezed shut, mouth open on a silent scream and I halt all my movement, just looking.
seemed much better.’
When he finally lowers it, he just says ‘
'Yes, again.'
“Three days, give or take,” he shrugs. “I’m not sure.”
'When was the last time Teddy was here?'
'That was... out of this world.'
'Gross.'
I burst out laughing and Ron frowns. ‘Whatever. Why do I even try?’
“Break-ups?” Malfoy frowns.
(Honestly, I don’t mind this new development, but I do mind how it came to it.)
'Good. But not yet.'
'Because I wanted to tell you today.'
Harry Potter
'And we will have to talk about the sitting room. Mrs Weasley mistook your carefully chosen tablecloth for a napkin.'
Potter took him to bed, undressed him, caressed him, pushed inside him.
She laughs and oh, how it grates on his nerves. “He does, of course. He’s very nice. But you can show me something too.”
I chuckle weakly, because Ron is truly amusing. ‘Sorry mate, no can do.’
‘Did you see him, Malfoy? He was so happy, how could you crash his hopes to have his family together?’ he asks and is he trying to make me feel guilty? Well, tough luck!
‘I was not feeling well,’ I finally say. ‘I blocked the floo and all owl post. I needed quiet, you do understand.’ I sit down, I hope all poise, even in my pajamas.
I am happy to report that I manged to peruse his shop a bit more during these last three days.
'Merry Christmas.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Please, do tell.'
I flop back down on my chair and just hope Malfoy will be able to get over himself by next week. It’s not like I’m doing it to spite him, murder him or for my own entertainment, damnit!
Obviously, I can’t do that so I said:
He’s making breakfast. Maybe he’s making it for me too. Maybe.
'I haven't and I am. Oh, wait. What about the wedding? We said it would be in a year. Should we postpone then?'
and so I thought that yes, I’d love to go to the sea and relax.
The first thing I see when I come to work is smirking Blaise wishing me a good morning. ‘Hey. I’m going to the lab,’ I say to him because I’m almost hundred percent sure what he’s grinning about.
I slam my palm on the desk. ‘Enough Blaise! This is not funny. Just tell me what happened at the party.’
I may not have been ready for a surprise birthday party in the middle of the week when I have to go to work the next day, but I have all day tomorrow to regret tonight's decisions to drink and stay up late.
“I know you are,” Harry shrugs, “even if you still, you know, reek of alcohol.”
I can't help myself though, I know there will be no embrace, no sweet whispers in my ear, no kisses, but I still try. I kiss his shoulder, the closest part of him I can get to, just a brush of lips and he's sitting up.
'Yeah.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
Andromeda comes back carrying a tray. ‘Why aren’t you sitting? There’s a space on the sofa. I believe you boys can behave while sitting meter apart?’ she puts the tray on the table and I see Potter’s red face.
‘Certainly, I understand.’ I stomp away, back to my room. I pace along the small space and then, in somewhat childish rage I go right to where I know Potter’s room is. I bang the door open and I am delighted to see how he wakes up, startled, sitting up.
I put my glass down just so I don’t throw it at the wall. ‘No Luna, I don’t want to make an appointment right now. What exactly did Pansy tell you?’
'I know.'
'Why?'
‘But at least you can still go to work at the shop sometimes,’ I say and pick up Rose who is trying to climb my legs.
home with Malfoy. Unfortunately.
I’m not ashamed I kissed someone, I am single. But it was her friend and I think there might be some law or something about kissing your ex’s friends.
'Try, Harry.'
I told him. He nodded and asked
'This you will summon wandless, but a cooling charm...'
'There is another chair, right here.'
When I ask her again, after she stops writhing under me, she says she did. ‘Next time I will come on your cock, I promise.’ There’s silence and then we’re laughing and she says more dirty things and it’s ridiculous.
So, I went, we played for about two hours and then I almost came in my pants, pushed against that stupid shed wall (I cannot be blamed, it’s been, what, 6 months??). I wanted to cry when he pulled away and said
‘Ts, in such rush, no fun with you, British people,’ she sighs and motions to the man who brought us here, speaking German. He nods and leaves. ‘Stefan will bring it. It will take just a moment.’ She then proceeds to strip the man of his shirt, smiling sweetly.
I stay put. I think if I stand up I might just fall back down. Because this can’t be. It’s moving way too quickly.
'It's fine.'
I don't see anything but fury in his eyes. Just as there was nothing but mild interest when I delivered the news.
“Why do you want to get rid of me so much?” Harry asks jokingly. Malfoy doesn’t react, just looks ahead, jaw set. Harry continues, good humour disappearing. “But yeah, I suppose. If you want to be alone, I’ll leave you. See you Monday.”
She is from south of France, she’s their age, she has a cat and a crup, three siblings – two sisters and a brother, she loves cooking, chocolate, travelling, she’s been working as an auror for French Ministry for two years and jumped at the opportunity to work temporarily in England, she loves her work, she loves helping people and she hates injustice, she wanted to come and help during the war but her parents didn’t let her, she wants to go to America and do exchange there as well, she loves sea food and she can’t stop talking, ever… And all this in a matter of one week.
Harry snorts, can’t help it. He likes sarcastic Malfoy. “Good idea for a Christmas present.”
After a while, when I was a bit too excited about the situation, I whispered to him if he wanted to stay the night – because in my mind it was an okay thing to ask when you were grinding with another man against a hard surface for about a fourth time – and he kissed me again and pulled me closer and then pushed his hand down my pants and said
'No. I'm not coming in.'
'None at all.'
'Are you getting broody?'
It starts to look like I might be into guys. That, or Malfoy’s using some Amortentia or something else illegal that makes me this way now. It only started when he appeared, all of a sudden, men flirting with me everywhere? Did he spray it on me or something, is that why?
He looks up at me. His fist tightens and releases and he goes to lie down on his back next to me.
He raises a brow. ‘Why?’
‘You are mental!’ I yell back.
'Yes, whatever you want. Inside of me... inside of you, I don't care...' I kiss him and push down on his fingers, just twice. I take his wrist and withdraw it away.
'I feel really bad for you. Does your ass hurt from sitting all day?'
‘Great you say? So why did you decide, after weeks of nothing, to engage us in your case you are apparently unable to solve?’ I ask.
‘I don’t care about that. I like you.’ I look at her, her blue eyes and flushed cheeks. So pretty.
Morning, in the middle of his kitchen, after or during an argument about mornings and I never want to do anything else. I never want to let go.
‘How in Merlin’s balls did you hear that?!’ Ron squeaks with wide eyes.
‘No. I told him to stop contacting me. I felt guilty and disgusted about it all when I sobered up. I still feel disgusted with myself.’
‘Well I thought it was given that sometimes… we’ve been sleeping together for five months, fucking hell! You could stay!’ I can’t believe what’s pouring out of my mouth. I’m essentially begging him to spend mornings with me. ‘Sometimes,’ I finish, trying to save face.
Auror Office
'Yeah. Now pst, listen to the nature.'
'Okay.'
‘Really?’ he asks, grinning. ‘Can it be the normal one, not the big for kids? Can it be gold?’ He grabs my sleeve and pulls me inside the shop. He keeps chattering and once we’re inside he’s carefully considering each snitch on display. Once he points at his favourite one and the shop keeper gives it to him, he smiles, his eyes sparkle and he holds it close to his scrunched up nose, inspecting it and finally nodding contently and putting it in his pocket. ‘Thank you Draco,’ he smirks. ‘Can we also get ice cream now?’
We were just after dinner and I turned on the wireless and there was a Celetina Warbeck song on and he started dancing and probably singing – sounded more like screaming to me, but then that song wasn’t any better – and it was the cutest thing in the world. Andromeda said it was his favourite song that he always dances to it, but this was the first time he attempted the singing too.
‘We work together.’
Harry shrugs, holding Malfoy’s tea and his coffee, glad the office will be quiet while she stays here. “Sure, you can.”
We went to see the Berlin Wall. I read about it in one of Malfoy’s brochures.
He takes her hand and takes her to their table.
Harry knows what Malfoy smells like when he’s all sweaty and his skin is glistening. He smells like musk and apple and something Harry can’t even describe, so divine he would like to bathe in it. In Malfoy’s sweat. It’s so fucked that sometimes Harry thinks he’s really gone crazy.
'But why do you want to come back? You said you hated it.'
Unlike Malfoy. ‘Hey! What the hell?’
Malfoy’s palms slide up Harry’s arms, all the way to his shoulders. “She took it into her French head that she wanted to bed the Chosen One.”
‘Is it? Well, since you’re so interested, work’s great. How is yours?’ I guess he tries to smile but it comes out as a very weird grimace.
Hermione just raises her brows and goes to take Hugo. ‘Hello my little angel,’ she says pointedly.
‘I want lunch,’ I announce when we are down the steps.
Yesterday we went out again after work, Parkinson joined us, and we went clubbing. I mean, I mostly just sat and drank, they danced. I watched them from time to time. Malfoy was popular on the dance floor, loads of people wanted to dance with him.
I shout right back at him. ‘It’s been ten minutes. Sit and look out!’
Once we were outside, he just nodded with
His eyes narrow. ‘I heard you. I just don’t know why you’re asking.’
As soon as my fingers touch the wood, a shudder goes through me, some sort of yanking sensation and I feel the Polyjuice wearing of. I hear a gasp somewhere on the right. Jacoby is not smiling anymore and her fingers on the box tighten just as I am about to jerk it away from her. There are some shouts and people disapparating, and it’s all happening so quickly I barely notice someone is pointing a wand at me and yelling a spell in German.
I look down at Teddy, his palms and the tip of his nose on the shop window.
'How long were you together?'
I feel the pain in my chest and I think I will choke on it, that this is something that will finally kill me.
'I'm not pining.'
'Well, last time was pretty special.'
I take the pie from the oven and place it in the middle of a table. I think mother is now peacefully sleeping, no dreams, no emotions, in a void, it was one of those days for her. ‘Yes, she still does. We used to have it every Sunday when I was younger. She just felt a little under the weather. Probably cold, I made her some Pepper-up.’
'When?'
, to stay, to not leave me alone. I was a complete
I stop there, no more left to say, looking somewhere behind his shoulder.
I land on my feet but my knees crumble and I fall forward on my hands. Malfoy lands next to me, I hear him yelp and I hope he broke his fucking neck.
and Hermione answered with
I didn’t go to the shop for the whole week. No one flirted with me, so it has to mean I was right and this was Malfoy’s plan all along. To get me all obsessed with him all over again.
'No thanks. I'll finish this one and then I'm off.'
I use a quick spell to freshen my clothes, put them on and go down as quietly as possible - I try Apparating in his room, but there are wards, of course.
'Malfoy! Did you like the game?'
‘Have you even been in a church or gallery or museum before, Potter?’ I ask and look at him.
Harry’s face is burning. He startles at the shout and almost falls off his chair.
Teddy bemoans his misfortune, with a real anguish of a boy who just found out he might need to tend to his own food in the future. ‘Then I might get a house-elf or a cook,’ he shrugs and continues on eating.
‘We’re not,’ Blaise interrupts, ‘but honestly, you can stop fucking her for once in order to spend some quality time with us.’
'Well then. I don't find it weird so no one else should.'
, she said. I felt pretty uneasy. She was nice and all, my age and pretty, but all the same, it was awkward. I mean, it was for me, she looked at unbothered, but I was fidgeting and constantly sipping on my butterbeer and looking all around. I was glad when she decided to go grab a cupcake and with
'Tell me. Please?'
'What?'
'I thought we already talked about this.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
An owl pecks on his window.
My mouth is on hers the whole time, not really kissing, touching lips and tongues, moaning and whispering dirty things to each other until I come inside her, shaking and groaning.
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'I don't want to talk.'
'Turn around,' I say and he does. His ass is on display, his thighs spread. I kiss him there, suck lightly, move to his cheeks and spread them, kiss him there as well, dart my tongue out into him. I know he likes it, he always complains how dirty it is, how gross I am for doing it, but when he does the same to me, all's good. Right now he just spreads his thighs wider and pushes back. I suck, lick, kiss and I love every fucking sound he makes.
Ministry of Magic
‘I don’t know why it bothers you so much. The jerk cheated on you. You should be happy you didn’t actually propose.’
'But, I would call and let you know. You're right, it is inexcusable. I will do my best next time. I will do my best with delegating my work, because I want to spend more time with you and our friends. I don't want to make you feel like you don't matter, because you do. I love you and I will do better.'
He sleeps again and has nightmares about Malfoy and his stupid fucking hair.
Now it keeps replaying in his head and it is agony. He needs to get laid, that’s the solution.
'What emergency?'
'I said...'
'I want to know the reason, I obviously don't want you to describe the whole...act.' Now I see it. The contempt, there, only for me.
Malfoy smirks back at her. ‘I certainly will.’
He doesn’t for a long time.
'Because of you. Of what you did. I don't trust anyone.'
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'We will, indeed. Oh, let's go. I promised mother I'd dance with her to this song.'
Another owl flies in, dropping the
Same thing yesterday, the park, the bench, the kissing, the goodnight, the leaving.
‘I’m not unable to solve it but I am no potioneer, am I?’ he growls and takes a swig of his lemon water.
‘I hope you like it.’ He eats and so I eat too.
I put it in my pocket and tell Andromeda and Teddy her hellos. ‘I think I’ll go. I have to get up early tomorrow.’
I have no care in the world. My mind is blank. Bodies moving all around me, touching, brushing.
Once we left the Leaky, he asked
‘I see. ou wanted to protect the Statute of Secrecy then?’
'People change.'
I summon Malfoy’s wand, catching it. ‘Malfoy!’ I shout, hoping he can hear me. Jesus, is it possible they took him somewhere? That would be even bigger fuckup than it is now.
'I was heartbroken. I just wanted you to hurt the same. I never hated you. I definitely don't now.'
We clear the table after everyone is done and Teddy moans that he is so full and cannot possibly go upstairs yet but should rather take his broom and fly. I can see Andromeda rolls her eyes, standing next to her by the sink, drying the dishes, and she summons his school things. Teddy drops his head dramatically on the table. ‘Don’t worry, I will help you,’ Potter encourages.
'For always.'
'No? I am a groomsman. You are just... a guest.'
‘Ron!’ I whine into my pillow. ‘Let me sleep please. Do whatever you came for and go.’
He changes the topic. “I’m sorry about Coraline,” he says even though he’s not sorry at all. He’s only sorry if Malfoy’s heart is broken or some such.
‘You know what things. And okay, I will not hold it over you, you said it during sex, but still. You could treat me as always, at least.’ He’s angry, standing up, taking the plates and cutlery, putting it in sink.
Now, of course I think: we have the contract with Zabini and Malfoy, one of them can come, depending on the contract which I only skimmed through, it might be possible. Well, I say so.
‘Mhm.’ I don’t have anything else to say. It’s not like we are a couple again now that she’s back, I don't keep tabs on her.
‘I will blast this fucking door off! Do you hear me, Draco?’
I don't have any self-preservation.
We went to the Leaky today. Ate some food, drank some beer and spoke some words and went home.
'I'm sorry, I didn't mean it! Draco, please, stay in bed.'
He’s too tired to go and try tonight. He has to settle for a glass of firewhisky and most probably a quick wank.
'Okay.'
‘I am never drinking again. I have no idea, I don’t remember any of this and neither anything after.’ I massage my temples in hopes everything will suddenly come back to me. It doesn’t.
'What's this? Are you givimg me your badge?'

'My team caught the snitch...'
‘I was not wailing!’
‘She keeps arguing with me about this shirt I am wearing! She says it was always purple. But clearly as you can see,’ he pushes the photo right in front of my nose and points a finger at himself, ‘it used to be red. She cannot admit she did the laundry wrong. Oh, she’s going to be so pissed she’s not right!’
'So you want me to keep fidgeting?'
'I love it, thank you, it will go great with my blue robes. Good night now.'
It’s different than the first. Malfoy’s lips are warm now and tastes of mint instead of alcohol. Harry hears and feels the puffs of air on his cheek when Malfoy tilts his head to the right and devours him. Because that’s how it feels. Malfoy’s lips move softly but hard at the same time, as though he wants to move even nearer if it would be possible. He presses him into the railing next to the door and Harry catches him around the waist. Malfoy releases a small sigh and there’s a hint of a smile.
‘Mhmm...’
His tongue in my mouth, lips firm against mine, his heat, all of him, in me, around me.
The smirk disappears and his fingers tighten around the door knob. 'By all means, Potter, you can fuck off.'
‘Prompt?’ I snort, because in my experience he’s anything but.
But still.
'See? Wasn't that hard.'
'Yes. Totally.'
'Well.'
‘Okay?’ he finally speaks. ‘And you are feeling bad because you took that pill? Was it … what do muggles call it… durg, drug?’ His eyes widen. ‘Did you take drugs, Harry?’
'No. I guess someone else can...'
There is only one exit, it seems, unless something is concealed with a spell. When patrolling the building days previous, we were not able to detect these rooms. I think we might have to update our procedures in the future. Or maybe the room was not there yet. I keep thinking what we missed, what can happen tonight, whether the team is stationed near the mirror or if they got inside.
‘What things?’ I ask.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Er, yeah, otherwise we wouldn't be friends.'
Harry Potter
'I missed you so much. Come here.'
Auror Office
I want him to hold me tighter, not letting me fall or falling with me, hard.
We sit in silence, he looks everywhere but me and I can't stop looking at him.
'Oh come on, don't be so grouchy.'
And I can’t help it, I can’t stay quiet. ‘Are you stalking me, again, Potter?’ I hiss, hoping no one else can hear me.
There was a complaint against Malfoy again. I saw the report first, that’s why I went, not any other reason. The same woman, almost exactly the same scene when I arrived. I sent her away just as the last time and Malfoy was even more insufferable, he only answered in one word sentences, the git.
'I will.'
Slow and languid.
'I told you, I'm fine.'
He asked multiple times whether the curse he was hit with left some side effects. Or the potions they gave him for pain and blood replenishing, whether they weren’t botched. They kept saying the same thing: no side effects, the potions were brewed properly and administered in the correct way, his brain was not damaged nor was his core. They ran diagnostics again after he asked them to – when he saw Malfoy laugh and blushed so hard, he thought his cheeks would catch on fire.
right into my face when I said he was a prat like it was the funniest joke he’s heard and
I think, overall, the things are going well.
'No! No need. I like it. You look hot with it.'
‘Just a minute!’ I yell, wash my hands and yank the door open, hoping it’s not that woman. Lucky me, it’s Malfoy.
‘Are you joking?’ he looks at me like I’m mad. This kid, I swear, where does he get this cheek from? ‘But you are not my gran. You are Draco, my most favourite cousin!’
I sigh and bite down my honest reply. Instead, I just tell her that it was quite last minute but it’s fine, it’s work, just as Potter says.
It probably takes only two seconds when he jerks away. He wants to play it as an accident. “I’m sorry! I thought-“ He can’t finish the sentence. He can’t think of a good excuse. Nothing. In fact, he wants to go back and kiss him some more. “Those hails hit my head!” he blurts out.
'I won't wear it at all, because mmpf...'
“Ow!”
Maybe.
I might be crying but they are happy tears.
'That's really nice of you, thanks.'
‘It was great, thank you,’ I tell him, at last.
‘This is a fucking sex den!’ Malfoy shouts at me, looking somewhere to the left of us. My eyes follow in the direction and indeed, there are two people in a lit corner, enjoying themselves, barely clothed.
We don’t speak. He finishes before me, so I shovel in the rest of mine.
I just hope I won’t hit a wall at the end of this all.
I stand still, not moving an inch. It started settling in several hours ago, when they questioned me, when I was filling in the report, when I was eating my dinner. And now there's an urge to be rid of it, the emptiness of not feeling guilty.
“Something work related?” Malfoy’s voice is scathing and even though Harry doesn’t see him he can imagine his face – mad at being ignored.
‘Salazar, thanks for the honesty.’ I finish my drink also and go to pour another.
‘You’re welcome to not eat it then,’ Potter grits and I’m glad I managed to irritate him even more.
I really wanted to just say no and to just talk about what’s going on, but I stepped back and said okay instead.
“Salazar. Potter, that was a lot.”
I brought up my encounter with Malfoy to Hermione and Ron. Ron groaned and Hermione said that she sees him sometimes in Diagon Alley. I asked why she never told me and she said she didn’t think it was important!
‘I don’t understand why my glass is empty!‘ I yell and wave it in front of the bartender who glares at me and I bet he’s going to spit in it and I don’t care. ‘What are you doing here, Granger? Getting much needed reprieve from work, too? Can I invite you to have a drink with me?‘
I want
I grab his shoulders and push him away, looking at his face. ‘You didn’t break anything. Now, can you stand?’ I ask and let him go, he sways and his back hits a cabinet behind him. He grumbles something and closes his eyes. ‘Okay. I think you’ll manage,’ and as I say it he grabs me by my elbow, his eyes suddenly clearer and wide and a horrible flashback assaults my mind.
'Are you serious?'
‘Oh my! Absolutely,’ Blaise agrees readily.
‘So. Ginny is thinking of taking a position in America, in some amazing quidditch team they have there. She would move there, for two whole years at least.’
‘Sorry, Draco. There is a charm on, so you can only open the closet after seven minutes. If you don’t want to make out then maybe you can talk. I noticed some tension between you two. Are you sure it’s not sexual? Because in my experience…’
'But you're not sure.'
‘Stop it!’ I hiss.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Why did I even try....'
‘I know her. She’s a niece or something to Adeus Lynxar, the Wizengamot official.’
'Did you have fun?'
and I jumped in, said it was fine, laughed, a bit mad, wished him a good evening and left, Parkinson was standing outside, I said goodbye to her too, she said goodnight and I disapparated right on the spot.
Is it too soon to think about this? It hasn’t even been three weeks yet since we kissed. Is that enough time to have a crisis?
'Well...'
At least now no one will be harassed for no reason.
I start a slow grind with my hips. 'Good?' I whisper and he nods, biting his lip. 'How good?' I prod. I want to hear him.
'I don't think it's pathetic, going alone.'
'That's not fair! I just want you to be happy and content. It's so hard recently to talk to you about anything. Everything sets you off.'
'They're fine but they don't match the colour scheme.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
‘There’s no what if! I am fine with not knowing. Now seriously, get out, both!’
‘Happy you’re so in sync today,’ I murmur when Pansy wraps her arm around my neck and I can smell cherries in her breath when she says to not be mad and laughs.
'And maybe I'm wearing it now.'
After, my head rests on his stomach and his fingers play with my hair, stilling when he falls asleep.
'Wouldn't help anything since he would just jump back up, would it?'
'Why did you cheat on me? What did I do? Why did you do it?' He exhales and his fingers clutch the cup.
'Alright, but then...'
'Do whatever, but quietly.'
I fall face first into my bed, ready to sleep for the entirety of today.
'Yes, that's a wonderful idea.'
What if he sees it, sees right through it all, all of me, and is just having me on?
“Listen,” Harry starts but another voice overtakes his.
'I don't know what to think about you anymore. You ruined everything I ever believed was true about you.' I wish we were alone. I would crawl at his feet and beg him to not think so.
I get interrupted from my musings but his laughter. He has those ghastly goggles on already and the instructor is making the last checks on him and setting his own goggles on.
Harry opens and closes his mouth in quick succession.
'Hello. How was your day?'
'Will you stay the night?'
‘She fire-called me if I wanted to meet and catch up.’
We finished eating, I tried to talk because the silence was stifling, but his answers were short and clipped. He didn’t offer any dessert, instead he said
'And are you marrying Longbottom now that he's choosing our flower arrangements?'
Harry Potter
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'I know. But I want to try.'
'Sure. So, nothing else happened here in the last two months.'
He keeps pointing at me, his jaw clenching and eyes blazing with rage.
‘Was I supposed to send a formal letter? By all means, Potter, it will be the first thing I do as I get back home. Is that good enough for you?’
'Oh my god, gross, no!'
Finally, after what feels like forever, I see him striding to me. He smiles and orders as well, sidling up to me, telling me how dirty the loos are here and I laugh, saying I hope he washed his hands otherwise I won’t let him touch my silk shirt. He whispers in my ear ‘I want to touch much more than just your shirt,’ and then he kisses my cheek, lingering, grinning.
'I'm saying out loud what you think as well.'
Maybe I just love the castle too much, or I don’t have an active imagination, or maybe I just don’t feel happy anywhere at any time, other than Hogwarts. That would be grim. I hope it’s the charm’s fault.
'That was not what we were discussing at all!'
‘So you’re really going to sleep? Fine, but remember – I feel betrayed.’
'Hello Potter.'
We fall on his bed, rutting against each other. His finger finds its way to my ass, lower and inside. 'You want to fuck me?' I ask him, licking his bottom lip.
I undress him.
'Yeah.' He doesn't look at me and I need to see his face so I reach out and touch his arm. He flinches and stands up.
'That is not what I meant. But you barely speak to me, I don't know what's going on in your head.'
'Yeah. Now let's listen to the birds. And maybe we can integrate some kissing too.'
Harry moans his agreement and bears down slowly, just as Malfoy continues his equally slow push inside.
'Are you okay? Was the food good? Are you hungry?'
'Merlin, unbelievable. Here, catch!'
. I will have to talk to him.
'I need to tell you something.'
'She definitely didn't forget about you, Potter.'
I don’t have to revert to secrecy, it’s apparently enough being friendly-ish with Malfoy to get him talking. Even though I think I still have a long way to go. I’m planning to stop by again today, to see how much more he will let slip.
Turns out Malfoy hated the idea of Harry getting it on with Coraline just as Harry did. Her first concern apparently was whether she would be working directly with him. And when Malfoy confirmed it, she went on saying she fancied him and wanted to seduce him.
'Are you joking? You're the soppiest person I know, Harry.'
'Different? She looks like any other black cat to me.'
“Fuck. Yes.”
written in bold red letters floating above their heads. 'Happy Birthday, Harry!' she screams, 'how do you like my decorations?'
'Why?'
He spreads his legs and wraps them around Malfoy’s hips. “You’re so hot,” Harry can’t help saying in between kisses. “So fit.”
Harry Potter

‘You are welcome, Potter,’ he sneers and turns to leave.
I breathe in deeply and exhale. I can make it, we must be half in, for sure. ‘Shut up, Pansy!’ Malfoy yells back and somehow thwacks my side.
and I told her
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
They will get married, have children and be happy.
‘Good then,’ I say, ‘I’m glad.’
'Buzzkill.'
'You know I was joking. Of course I'll miss you. But it's a great opportunity. Who would be better Head Auror than you, hm?'
After work I stopped by again, he even let me wait inside, not many customers. He said the vase isn’t done yet, most probably on Tuesday.
“Probably.”
'I'm not stupid, Draco.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
I hand it over. Even if it’s not my wand, I still feel wrong giving it to some stranger. The man extends his hand to Malfoy, who frowns down at his palm. After a moment Malfoy drops it into his hand and frowns further.
'Come on. They will be fine.'
There’s a dull pain in his chest when he wants to sit up. He groans, sinking helplessly back into the pillows. And then he has a scare of his life when he looks right and sees Malfoy sitting on a chair next to his bed, staring at Harry.
‘So, I heard Ana is back?’ Hermione says while sipping her wine.
‘Excuse me if I find it suspicious he’s suddenly friends with Hermione and everyone else it seems!’
Blaze Potions Ltd.
Harry wants to fuck Malfoy senseless.
‘It really is, when you give them,’ he answers and bites into the cherry muffin, chewing noisily. ‘But maybe you can go and buy some yourself, hm?’
I think it’s progress. I do think that he will bolt as soon as he’s conscious enough, though.
'So you kiss all your friends like this? Do you kiss Weasley like this?'
‘Oh is it?’ I ask and continue with my tapping, now more loudly, to annoy him more.
She looks at me, highly unimpressed. ‘You said Blaise’s attorney approved it. And I don’t see anything wrong,’ she flips through the pages again, ‘they guarantee your safety. Do you know what would happen if they let any harm come to you or Merlin forbid, if they let you die?’
'You're welcome. When's the party?'
I quickly made my way to the garden where Teddy was playing with Bill and Victoire and where some other people were mingling. I joined them, Victoire was making some unsteady steps on the grass, Teddy cheering her on, Bill taking pictures and smiling, sun shining on his red hair, looking young and happy.
'Okay, okay! So start sending now, the sooner the better so you won't be forty.'
He just glowers at me and turns to the room, not moving.
‘Yes, Potter,' he snaps, 'my apologies if it offends you. Believe me, if I’d knew you’d be here, I wouldn’t come.’ He hits me with his elbow - judging by its sharpness, .
He grabs my arm. ‘We can’t apparate from here. That woman threw wards around here as she was leaving.’
He flicks through it and sips his tea.
'It's great, thanks... er, I gotta go, Ron's waiting for me. See you around, Malfoy.'
I roll my eyes. ‘No, Pansy, I didn’t. I didn’t have it handy and I was otherwise occupied.’
'I like fucking.'
I let myself fall on top of him, just for a moment, still panting. His arms are loose around me and I feel them slipping away slowly. I know it's my cue so I roll over and we lay side by side.
‘Yesterday you were telling me all these things and now you can barely look at me.’ He’s frowning.
I got a debrief from Ash. There was no suspicious change of plans and the smugglers kept up their usual daily routines. We were ready and I just hoped Malfoy wouldn’t ruin it all.
'Damn it, Potter... okay, come on, I want to see you naked as soon as possible.'
Harry Potter
'Draco, I know it sucks, I don't love it either.'
Robards said.
'In the shower?'
'Are you sure? Because you didn't want to hire anyone and I will not be able to prepare it on my own. Although, I guess your mum could help, or Mrs. Weasley or Andy, Hermione or Ginny, even Blaise I think. Parkinson? There's also Luna, yeah. Yeah, no, I would be fine if they'd help.'
'Alright, I think I'll go now.'
‘Did you apply for a job with the Ministry before? To work as a potion master?’ Potter asks out of the blue.
‘Can we skip to the business, please?’ Malfoy asks, clearly annoyed.
He is definitely up to something.
My face flushes red immediately.
'I don't even know. She was nice.'
He cringes and leans in a bit. ‘Don’t be crass, Potter! Don’t say lover in public places, you idiot.’ He leans back and settles in his chair. ‘It’s good to learn new things.’
'Yeah. Alright. Let's go to bed.'
'If I do then what? What will you do Malfoy?'
'You smell like grass.'
'Draco... okay, get this off.'
No reason to be thinking about him now.
‘Well, this is interesting,’ my mother smiles pleasantly at us and then raises her brows at Andromeda.
'Do you want some pepper-up before going back?'
The talk didn’t go as good as expected. I came to his this afternoon, we were supposed to have lunch and then go and see Miss Congeniality in cinema, some sort of re-run.
(which, I admit, was super weird). Malfoy laughed, said no and then looked at my hand still on his arm which I immediately dropped. He frowned, but in the end, he nodded and started walking.
Draco L. Malfoy
He frowns. ‘No, someone must come with you. Plus, of course, the charms.’ We stand there in silence for few beats. ‘Unfortunately, I cannot go with you, but you can wait until one of the others wakes up.’
‘Yeah? I’m so happy you like it, this is my first time sucking a man’s cock,’ she says, smirking.
'No. If you want it, accept. If not, that's fine too. I'll stick around you, either way. As long as you bring the galleons.'
Malfoy is about to close the door on him, Harry knows, and so he says the first thing that comes to his mind. “I just want to have sex with you!” It’s probably way too loud, judging by Malfoy’s horrified face. “I mean,” Harry goes on in a low voice, “not just, not like let’s fuck and farewell. I didn’t want you to sleep with her, or anyone. I want to sleep with you. As in, I like you.” Harry watches Malfoy’s face go pink, bewildered, and shocked. “Merlin, that came out wrong. I don’t think anything bad about you, I don’t think that you’re some entitled prick. I think you’re a posh prat, sure, but not like you were in school. Less, you know? Jesus, just dig me a grave,” Harry finishes in an embarrassed murmur.
'You know you can just cast a spell, right?'
‘Excuse me?’ I ask and watch as he licks a drop of coffee that spilled from a corner of his mouth.
'Yeah, when we had sex on or against said furniture and it held, why wouldn't I?'
'I love you. I would never. You know that right?'
Harry’s head will surely explode eventually, from all the chattering.
has no manners.
'No problem. So, feeling better? Ready for some shots?'
Harry bites his lip and nods. Malfoy’s fingers disappear and he swiftly turns them both around, making Harry breathless. He sits on his lap and looks at Malfoy’s heaving chest, then his face. He pushes up on his knees and Malfoy sits up, planting a kiss on his mouth. He reaches behind Harry, pushes his cheek apart with one hand and holds his cock with the other.
‘Okay. How then?’ I don’t let him answer when I slide my tongue in his mouth, savouring his taste, his heat and gasps.
‘You help us lot more than our lab does. Why not? I’ll talk to Kingsley about it,’ he shrugs like it’s no big deal.
I don't feel any remorse.
‘What are you doing here? Where’s Andy?’ he asks Teddy but glares at me, like I did something to her.
'Well if it was a success, that's what matters.'
We’re sitting on a bench in the Friedrichshain public park, at nine in the morning, waiting for the contact. We’re under Polyjuice, pretending to be brothers from Manchester interested in the business and Malfoy cannot stop complaining. ‘I hate this cloak, by the way. It scratches my skin. Merlin, awful. And this ugly skin! So itchy and way too big and heavy. Couldn’t the Ministry get someone better?’
'Yeah. Weasley is ridiculous, he should get over himself.'
‘Yeah. Thank Merlin for mum that she’s so willing to look after these little devils.’
I went out yesterday and I definitely shouldn’t have drunk that much, I will try not to, ever again. The whole day was a trial in suffering.
'What is this?'
‘You could’ve told me she was here! Are you seriously not done with flaunting my dirty laundry in front of everyone?’ I go back to the floo.
‘I think she invited me to the wedding but, sadly, I could not attend at that time.’
‘You are fucking crazy! You started this fight!’
But I don’t have anything, do I? Just years long animosity towards the git, but nothing real.
‘It is,’ I say.
Malfoy just keeps whining and we’re just twenty seconds in! ‘I will suffocate here. Why me?’
We find it in a corner, half-hidden behind some ratty drapes. I tap the exit sign twice and the mirror pops out of the wall slightly. I take the edge and pull it off the wall completely to reveal a dimly lit, large empty room, slight shimmer on the sides.
He fucks himself faster, their skin slapping together. He loves everything about it.
Harry Potter
'Merlin, he hates her. This wasn't a good idea.'
She laughs and it sounds lovely, like some stupid bells or something. “You will, Potter. She’s assigned to us,” Malfoy explains with pained expression.
So we are in the sitting room, mother and Andromeda are talking and drinking tea, Teddy is running around trying to catch his snitch and alternating between reading Quidditch Through the Ages for kids and I am eating an apple pie Andromeda baked, when there is a knock on the door.
'When are you leaving?'
What a fucking bullshit! ‘I don’t have anything else.’
Blaze Potions Ltd.
It was too much so I said
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
‘Okay, Teddy!’ I shout up at him. He looks down, hovering in the air, snitch fluttering in his hand. ‘I’m coming inside. You should come down now too, I think grandma cooked some dinner!’
Draco L. Malfoy
'Why are you even awake?'
'Of course he did, he said so and he also looked like it.'
'Harry, I barely see you anymore'
So I speed up and try to catch the ball, Malfoy steers into my side and I almost loose my balance. ‘What the fuck Malfoy?!’ I scream and somehow the snitch is there and flying into my palm.
'Wow. Thanks.'
'Hi.'
‘No matter, we can go the next day,’ I tell him. ‘Remember what we agreed, you’re at my beck and call. I understand you have to work sometimes so I am being benevolent. You’re welcome.’
We burst into laughter, me and Blaise, while Pansy keeps muttering some very lewd curses.
I turn and see him, still under Polyjuice, which makes me feel a little relieved.
'August... you're amazing. Come here.'
When I walked inside the Curious Curses, Parkinson was sitting on the counter, swinging her legs, Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
'We broke up.'
'Are you fucking kidding me, Potter? Go back to sleep.'
‘Okay,’ she rubs her temples, ‘I admit, she was not the most helpful in that situation, but I was intoxicated from all the fumes and so relaxed…’
‘Okay,’ Pansy starts, apparently done waiting, ‘I never liked him, Draco. I’m sorry, I really tried, but he was just so pretentious! I could not stand it!’
'I don't care! I want this to work. I'll do anything. Anything you want, I swear.'
He nods and sits up. He takes us both in hand, watching. ‘How would you want me?’ he asks, not looking me in the eye.
He hears Malfoy say: “Just wanted to see if Potter’s still capable of basic skills, such as writing. Lovely to see you Granger.” The door shuts closed, and Harry asks for a potion to relieve the ache that is now spreading through his whole body.
'You should.'
‘When Draco is not there?’ Teddy asks.
'Yeah!'
“I will.”
He looks up, his hair white blond and this time he manages to change his eye colour grey as well.
'Oh, yes. Would be even better if there wouldn't be some awful restrictions from the bride-to-be.'
'Come back here. Draco!'
Robards called me in today to send me to another abroad assignment, two days, but at least this time with Jonson, in Switzerland, so it’s fine.
'Mhm.'
'...A lot of photos of Ginevra.'
'Will you marry me?'
I can’t stop, not now when I got this close. I have to consider my next step.
'You love it.'
Harry licks his lips when Malfoy now opens his mouth, brows set low above his eyes. He wonders about that tongue. What it would feel like in his mouth or on his neck or his shoulder or chest or cock or thighs-
'What are you doing?'
Draco L. Malfoy
'You are an exception.'
‘Why me?’ I hiss at him, wanting to smash his glasses along with his wand.
'I know.'
And I came back at 7pm.
Auror Office
Malfoy catches both of Harry’s wrists, wraps his fingers tightly around them. “What the fuck are you talking about?” he whispers.
He doesn’t say anything else, only turns to leave.
'Fuck me. Hard.' He bites my lip and then soothes it with his tongue.
‘Draco bought me ice cream and a snitch. Wait, I’ll show you.’ He takes out the snitch and gives it to Potter.
It had to come from the Minister himself. I, obviously, have no say, but at least, if no one else, Kingsley listened to me. He ordered the group to be discharged immediately and he gave me a written warning, after all. It sucks, but then I did go
'A suit?'
‘You slapped me?’
'For how much longer will they keep sending you off like this?'
'Yes. If you want to be.'
I wanted to say no or not write back at all, but he said we could play a seekers game and who am I to refuse Quidditch?
'And once I was less angry, I just said we grew apart.'
I haven’t thought about it before.
‘Is everything okay?’ she asks, frowning at me.
'I don't know...'
And then the closet opens and I’m blinded by light. ‘Seven minutes up, mate,’ I hear Ron’s cheery voice, my eyes trying to adjust to the brightness. ‘Why are you holding hands with Ferret?’
‘You’re welcome.’
Afterwards, a bit tipsy and warm, I asked him if he wanted to come to mine. He nodded and I took his hand and apparated us to Grimmauld. We landed in the kitchen. He noticed the vase with coneflowers sitting in the middle of the table and he said
'God, I really hoped I wouldn't see you again.'
‘Sometimes,’ I sigh, ‘a simple yes or no would suffice. And if you’d remember, you’d stop using my name.’
'No. I don't think I can... I will take my things and...'
I yank my arm from her grip. ‘Of course I didn’t. I’m telling you he’s drunk. It’s not my fault he can’t hold his own.’
and just tell her straight
'You hate dancing.'
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'Nothing.'
When the dishes were being washed, Ron asked me
'Don't ask me, I have no idea. Hermione somehow extracted it from our hair, it was a whole lecture.'
'You are my plus one.'
'I don't know, Harry. You can ask her, I'm sure the goblins still have her file with her address, I can ask around.'
Kind regards,
'Come on. We'll be quick. I feel like I haven't touched you for ages. Always so busy with planning and work and planning.'
“Yes,” Harry admits and feels his face heat.
Kind regards,
This morning I got an owl from Parkinson to come and entertain her with my presence this evening at some muggle club. This is a great opportunity to know more about her and Malfoy - if he’ll be there.
I went babysit today and Andromeda told me that Malfoy was visiting over the weekend, like it’s no big deal!! He apparently brought some toys over for Teddy and stayed only for an hour or so.
'She's hissing and ready to attack.'
'What was in it?'
'We'll see after your first 5 am alarm.'
True, I went straight home from work, so there was really no opportunity to test it fully, but still.
while pointing at me.
'Probably. And he's funny as hell.'
‘… was because of an occasional long-distance portkey to see your girlfriend? Honestly! At least your alcohol is good.’
‘Here you go, but I will limit you tonight to this one drink only.’ Pansy sits back down next to me and watches as I drink the whole thing in one go. ‘Better?’ she asks.
'I love you too. I'm sorry.'
win today, did it?’ grumbles Weasley and glares at Potter.
I investigated – calmed the woman down and sent her to her own shop.
‘Nice to meet you too. Isn’t Daphne your sister?’ I ask her.
“Why? We’ve been working here for more than six years.” Harry can’t think of what Malfoy’s talking about. He can’t think of a time recently when someone would have a problem with him.
Today I decided, the next time I see him, we’re going to have some serious talk.
'You were supposed to say you'd catch me or some such, based on all those muggle films you've made me watch.'
I’m not gonna lie and say that kiss didn’t jar me. It did.
He holsters his wand. ‘You will once we are back in England. It is in a safe vault right now, so you don’t have to worry, no one will access it.’
'Alright. If this is it then.' What a stupid thing to say. It'll never be it for me.
Kind regards,
'I think they are starting to warm up to me.'
There’s a pang in Draco’s chest, like something wants to claw out.
'Seriously? We went over this million times already.'
'No way I'm talking to her about it, are you insane?'
‘I thought you did,’ I ignore him, ‘by your hanging mouth and all.’
‘Fine, when I see her I will shove this to her face, screaming, how she could ever think it might be anything else than a Bloodroot poison.’
'I must ask him if he remembers, he wasn't very coherent the day after... yeah, looks like it was a good party.'
'Yeah.'
I let him go abruptly and shove him away from me. He gasps and slides down a bit, still standing. ‘You have no idea! You don’t know me!’ I step backwards, trying really hard not to just thump him and break his fucking face. ‘I have nothing to apologize to you for! Just because you can’t handle the truth! Fuck you Malfoy and fuck your so called morals!’
'Okay... wait...before we...'
'Are you drunk? You basically just confessed.'
'Amazing. Now, let's eat, I'm quite hungry because I waited so long for you.'
I don’t answer, just jerk my head in a nod.
He kisses my ear, jaw, cheek. ‘Am I crushing you?’
When he doesn’t continue, Harry asks him: “So you what, exactly? Slept with her instead, out of some spite or something?” He doesn’t get it. Was Malfoy so jealous of him he couldn’t let Harry sleep with her, so he did? Not that Harry wanted to. But what if he did? He thought they were on good terms, he truly did. But so, what was this kissing about? Some sick game?
Harry Potter
‘Good morning,’ he mumbles and rocks his hips, only a little, but it makes me hot all over anyway.
He said Draco was his.
. He hummed and was looking straight ahead and there it was, that mole right on his jaw.
'Then you will come with me, to save me, as you put it, from my own ruin, hm?'
‘Here you go.’ He puts the mug in front of me.
I go to the fireplace and sit in front of it. ‘Hello Luna.’
“I’m going to get a coffee,” Harry stands up and turns to Malfoy. “Do you want something?”
‘What about Ministry potion lab then?’
“Harry! You’re awake! We were just in the healer Willow’s office. Oh, Malfoy, what are you doing here?” Hermione finally notices him, and Harry can’t see them anymore. He’s being tended to by Molly who is fluffing his pillow.
'And we already discussed it and acknowledged it was just a misunderstanding, didn't we, Bono? You see? He agrees.'
Malfoy tilts his head and puts a finger on his chin in thought. “Hm, so if I am to shut up, I can’t tell you where it is. I’m perplexed, Potter. I don’t know what you want me to do.”
'He's seventeen already.'
'You've looked more tired than usual.'
'You didn't do anything. It's all my fault, not yours. It's never been yours.'
A guy in a muggle bookstore flirted with me today. I think. Maybe he was just polite. He gave me his number, which is useless to me, since I don’t have a phone.
'I get it. Don't worry, I'll take photos or something. You can look at them when you come back.'
He tilts his head, staying in front of the door, facing me.
‘Yes I did.’ I know she's figured it out.
'I love you.'
'I would love it if your feet were cold right about now.'
“But you were spending so much time together, always laughing.”
she said, like that isn’t exactly the reason why I don’t want to go.
‘Congrats,’ I say.
‘I almost came,’ he laughs.
‘Of course. We will draft it as soon as possible so everything is nice and official,’ she smiles and pours more wine in both of our glasses.
‘I think it’s none of your business.’ He says this with his annoying smirk and then continues. ‘But since you care so much, I’m meeting Granger.’
Thank god. I would not be able to stand the git here after he’s been hindering my cases.
The only thing I’ve managed to think about is, how I want to do it again.
‘Oh please, I’m always happy to see you. Come in, come in.’
'Listen, I wanted to talk.' He says it finally, eyeing me.
He huffs and goes on. ‘We are looking for Jon Jacoby.’
'That's the spirit!'
And then there are presents. I don't like opening them in front of people, but I do it anyway.
‘For fuck’s sake! Stop it Malfoy!’ I grab in the dark and I manage to take hold of something, forearm and fingers.
He’s been avoiding Draco ever since.
“Coraline.”
“How do you want me?” he asks Harry.
'I do want to. Isn't it too soon though?'
'We've had this planned for a month, Harry.You're just gonna leave and let me go alone?'
, when he put his clothes to rights and he did the same with mine, because apparently, I was useless, he asked to show him around. He said he used to come here when he was little, he frowned when he saw the renovated parlour and hall, said the red on the walls was
We breathe into each other's mouth, not really kissing, just there, against each other. I push my hand between us and I take him in my fist.
I want to get up, get dressed and leave. I want to throw him off me and I want to kiss him and I want to leave and stay here.
'Fuck me now.' He's so blunt sometimes, when he wants something he just says it. And I'm so in love I give him everything.
Andromeda just hums. She knows I’m lying but doesn’t say anything else about it. ‘Shame Astoria couldn’t come either.’
'Better than doing it alone. We might have ended with burnt off bits.'
'And you couldn’t get one more, I don't know, pretty?'
'You didn'r guilt me. I wanted to come.'
He said he wanted Draco.
He was delusional but he’s not now.
'Yeah. That would be nice. When do you have to leave?'
‘Potter!’ He motions for me to come to him. He’s crouching under a table. The others notice us and start directing their spells at him.
Potter smirks into his mug. ‘And you want to spend those ten hours with me? Figures.’
'Fine. We'll work up to the best, don't you worry, Potter.'
Well then. Ginny came today and took the rest of her stuff. I begged her,
I really don’t want to talk about it, especially not with Ron. ‘You really don’t want to know.’
All of a sudden, he’s right in front of me, his eyes narrowed and blazing. ‘You know what, Malfoy? You can f…’
He remembers as they kissed for the first time.
'I am furious, Potter! Seething! Stop laughing.'
'Someone has to take care of Bono.'
Harry nods.
is again, the same strange look, drunk eyes and me, not drunk at all for once.
I know people say I’m oblivious. By people I mean Hermione and Ginny.
Teddy licks his ice cream. ‘She’s home. She’s ill. But Draco gave her some medicine so today she
‘Cheers!’ Granger holds her glass up to mine.
'We must stop meeting like this, Potter.'
'Okay.'
Getting Kingsley’s approval won’t be a problem, as well as all the paperwork needed. The hardest task, I think, will be to get Malfoy on board.
‘Potter!’
'You're awful. You know how bad I am at this yet you do this to me every year.'
He leans in and hisses. ‘It was one painting and I didn’t want to smell it.’
I answered and I was mad enough to continue with
‘I mean, of course I do. But it’s not love. It’s just attraction, that’s all.’
'I've been feeling burnt out. I hate going there.'
We are quiet, I’m waiting for her to continue and Blaise is just nodding as though he is too. Before I have time to do anything at all, Pansy snaps. ‘Wow, thank you guys, great advice!’
‘I’m here,’ I step inside intending to finally take it.
'Potter, the wedding is in three months. Who knows if we're still together by then?'
'There are no tears gli...'
He even came to mine when I asked him, twice. And every time it ended in bed, on a sofa, on a floor, and once in a chair in my kitchen.
When I was leaving, I apparated in front of his gate and could see in the distance that the lights were on downstairs and almost reverted back to dismantling the wards to enter the grounds. But I didn’t.
I wake up though, way too soon. I hear some noise, footsteps. I don’t even care. I hear my bedroom door creak open and then there’s a squeal of surprise.
‘No? About Blaze Potions.’
'Yes.'
He lays there unmoving, looking up. He tries to remember what happened that it got him here.
‘Good morning,’ one of them says.
He kissed me goodbye, a bit more forceful than usual and I thought he changed his mind and might call me in. He didn’t, just smiled and went inside, alone.
'Okay but stay... Draco, I can't think when you...'
'I didn't tell anyone.'
And that opened a whole lot of questions, like: what is wrong with me, am I feeling sick, do I have unexplained empty spaces in my memory, any sickness, did I still not stopped with stalking him and what do I mean by seeing Malfoy?
'Of course I hate it! You look miserable and tired all the time.'
I didn’t enter the grounds today because I remembered I promised to babysit Teddy from 5pm and was an hour late. I apparated straight to Andromeda’s, apologising profusely. She was a little miffed, understandably so, so she greeted me in the doorway and left.
I imagined I would do it slowly, savouring it, because it’s always way faster than I would like. Alas, I almost rip it all off him in my haste to get to more warm skin.
Malfoy let me in this weekend when I apparated to his gate, ready to dismantle the wards, disgruntled at 9am, saying that apparently there is nothing he can do about me.
A man appears in front of us, smiling politely and saying something in German.
'Okay...'
'Alright I will. But only because you're so adorable right now.'
'Yeah?'
'Good, good...'
'Well, this is your ex's engagement party.'
'Sure. Have a good date.'
‘All right. I just finish the tea. Sit down.’

'Somewhere away from you. Don't try to contact me.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
Today, I went to apologise to Malfoy. He was just finishing with a customer. I told him I won’t follow him any longer. He smirked and said he should’ve complained sooner.
‘Is it?’ I ask him and watch him as he squirms a little. ‘I don’t remember you wanting to learn about muggle things back at school.’ I can’t help myself. It still grates on my nerves that people were so quick to forgive Malfoy for his bullying and being a prat when he was younger. And why not asking him, while we are waiting for our food to arrive?
Well, I don’t think so. ‘So tomorrow I was thinking, Teddy suggested some wall. I perused these papers, and it might be this, it’s called Berlin Wall. How original. We should go,’ I show him a picture.
Harry’s frown deepens. He wants to comment but Malfoy speaks up again. “I just want to go home, shower and sleep this fucking night away.”
Honestly, week is not nearly enough. Will continue and will see.
Sunday, there will be a party at the Burrow, Molly insisted. I just hope she won’t be there. What if I’d get drunk and cry
Blaze Potions Ltd.
“If you’d rather, you can fuck me. I like it.” He licks his neck as he says it and continues the torturous movement with his fist.
I leave the restaurant.
‘Where do you want to go?’ he asks between gulps.
Ministry of Magic
'Hm. Any pictures?'
’. And apparently Lynxar must be coming too, because she’s our potion expert and therefore needed in this particular operation. I don’t know the woman, she might be a real hoot and wonderful company, but she is a horrendous ‘expert’.
‘Pansy told me when she was getting her weekly massage. I have to say, now that I’m looking at you, there is a tension in your shoulders. I acquired a very good oil made of lavender and melissa plus some erumpent’s tears which I think might help you release stress and relax your whole body. Would you like to make an appointment with me?’
'Yeah?'
'To erase the whole thing?'
I'm dressed. I stand there, looking at him, who knows, maybe for the last time. I want to apologize again, explain, make excuses even when there are none. But it just always makes him angry and I can't see that if this is the last time...
'They won't. This is a part of the process.'
‘Oh, please,’ Blaise scoffs, ‘like Potter would hurt anyone, even you.’
'It's my birthday.'
'No! Let me through first, I'm going to talk to him and get that idea out of his head.'
'What's your obsession with the thong? It's revolting and uncomfortable.'
'Do not despair, Harry. If you'll be good, I might wear the thong tonight.'
She laughs at this, like it’s the funniest shit she ever heard. ‘Yes, you can buy me a drink, Malfoy, thanks. Are you alone here? Would you like to join us?‘
I take a breath. All the memories from that time rushing back at once.
'Fine.'
‘Wasn’t it you who kept repeating we, the Ministry, aurors and me, are responsible for your life?’
When I come back home, I think about Ana. How my life could’ve been if she stayed here four years ago, if we would have kids of our own, a crup or a kneazle, a home and I just cannot imagine it at all.
'Whatever lies you want to tell yourself, Potter.'
'What about Sam?'
'Exactly. That's what I wanna do. Waste it.'
'Harry!'
'Yeah, maybe.'
‘Why exactly are they not already sleeping, Ron?’ Hermione asks when Hugo burps.
'Okay? Come here.'
'Of course I will. You know how I love her sour lemon bars.'
‘Depends who’s us.‘ I kind of suspect, because even as adults they are still attached to the hip.
'Bye.'
I went to work today, loads of paperwork to catch up on, no new cases. Which suits me right now, as I am conducting my own investigation.
When he’s completely seated, he strokes Harry’s thighs, kneads the muscles briefly, licks into his mouth and flops down into the sheets.
– but why doesn’t he just say so for fuck’s sake??
Malfoy leans in. “That’s flattering. But in the last few months, I’ve only had one type.”
'Nothing.'
'Drunk people tell the truth, don't you know, Harry?'
‘Malfoy. I won’t have time tomorrow. My shift starts at twelve and lasts five hours. You can go with someone else.’
‘You don’t solve cases, Malfoy, you are a consultant on them and your contribution helps
‘I absolutely don’t know what you’re talking about,’ I yawn.
'I like this because there are no expectations.'
'You don't. No! You fucked me up so much. Fuck!'
'No, I told her about your work thing. But you will try to make it right?'
'Jesus, okay.'
I straighten up and look at him. His face is flushed - so pretty. The lights reflecting on his skin, pink and blue and purple. He looks like a dream. Like my personal fever dream.
She doesn’t even let me finish. ‘Alright, Harry, whatever you say. Now come, let’s watch the spectacle the guys prepared. Here you go,’ she hands me a camera, ‘go stand there so I have it from different angles.’
'It was your job. I should've handled it better. It was only my doing.'
Robards huffs for several more minutes, yells at me a bit, gulps a glass of water so he can yell a little longer and then I am leaving his office with a permission to get the Minister’s approval to engage Malfoy, ‘
‘So. I better get going then.’ I feel hot. I can tell I’m sweating as well. I might need to see a healer.
'Here's to nothing then. Cheers.'
and the door banged behind her.
Everywhere.
‘Do you? Really?’ I whisper back, scared he will think about it more, deciding that no, not really, running away, never seeing him again.
'See you.'
He’s looking at me, his chest heaving and eyes wide. Suddenly he laughs and then there’s a moan and I kiss him until he lifts his hips, until he says
She glares at me and punches me in my arm. ‘Of course I won’t, you prat. What kind of friend do you think I am?’
I think I would come just like this. But she sits up and takes me inside her.
It’s also unfair Harry still has not managed to lure someone into his bed. It might be bit arrogant, but he thought it would be easier, being him and all. Alas, it’s not. He flirts and he laughs and he’s all charm, and then he gets stuck. He can’t make himself follow through with it.
It’s awful, really, the complaint was trashed and Davies just laughed about it when he was telling me how Malfoy
'No, it's not like that.'
'He just wants to play, he won't do anything. Put her down, we will sit and let them get to know each other.'
Malfoy points to his mouth and shakes his head regretfully. Then he smirks and leaves their shared office.
'I wasn't lying. I was just... suppressing myself.'
'What is it?'
I might have fallen asleep for a bit because I almost fall down when there’s a knock and not a second later the door opens.
'Are you hiding?'
‘You do realize everyone will carry wands, right? Someone could kill me at any time.’ It is true and I will repeat it no matter how many times anyone says otherwise.
'Easy.'
'So rude! Look at those eyes, so soulful.'
“Oh, thank you. I’ll have a coffee.”
“Where are you going?” Harry asks despite of himself. Malfoy and he are supposed to go on patrol in about an hour.
‘Good. We played, screamed a little because someone borrowed someone else’s toy, kept throwing ourselves on the floor several times… but we managed. You’re welcome.’ I put my feet up on the coffee table and Ron follows suit.
I don’t know what I was thinking, honestly. We weren’t a couple, that was clear way before tonight. But I thought that he was just angry, or his pride was hurt when I said I wanted to keep it a secret for a while. I didn’t think he would go and kiss someone other than me! Okay, well, now I truly sound pathetic.
I look up at him and watch him as his hair changes back to blue.
'His spawn was climbing up my leg. Anyway, guess he wanted to give me some sort of speech about kicking my ass or something.'
‘Well, fine, I hope you know better than to take it again,’ he says, ‘but then what is the problem? You had a… er, good time I presume, you know, in bed. Was he ugly, do you feel bad about your lowered standards?’ I laugh and shake my head. ‘Well what am I supposed to think then? Just tell me! I do feel slightly uncomfortable here, hearing about my best friend’s sex life.’
‘Wonderful!’ she claps and continues: ‘So I assume I don’t have to recount the events for which you were still sober. Obviously you didn’t like he came, even though I did not invite him, Ginny did, but that we already cleared at the party, and I think that was what triggered you alcoholic spree.’
'Oh my fuck.. yes, yes... oh god,' he chants over and over. I add fingers and he buries his face in his pillow and lifts up his ass more.
'No, not yet.'
'What are you doing here?'
He knows almost everything there is to know about her, he thinks. Malfoy might know even more, considering he appointed himself as her personal guide around London. Harry wonders if they’ve already slept together. Sometimes he gets an unbelievable urge to just ask and quench the curiosity.
When we’re sitting in the living room after, Hermione subtly mentions she met with Ana. Which means she knows Ana does not want to be friends with me any more. It stung a little when she called to talk, she is funny and smart and I will miss her, but she said she cannot do it, because she doesn’t like me just like a friend and I am breaking her heart with
'You know...' he starts and I'm dreading what will come next. 'I almost wish you'd end up with her or something. Because then it wouldn't be my fault.'
‘Good answer,’ she nods and takes me back in her mouth. She pushes at my hips so I don’t move and I want to, so much. I don’t. I just look and grip the sheets.
when there is him?
I stand there, still, alone for a moment and I mind quite a lot that people are brushing against me now.
‘What the fuck are you doing here, Malfoy? I told you to go back!’
That I will definitely be embarrassed after I’m lucid again.
'Which is?'
'You don't have to know everything. And why do you think I don't speak to you about it? Exactly because of this, because you hate it when I'm like this.'
'That is not at all what I want.'
'I am aware. But I understand your job is important as well.'
and then Malfoy said
I don’t know whether it’s whatever I’ve done or whether he doesn’t know himself. He’s hot and then he’s cold, and then he doesn’t talk to me and then he calls me over to have sex, then doesn’t speak to me again for a week and then he’s eating breakfast at my kitchen table and then he’s storming out!!
I crumple the parchment and Incendio it for good measure. He tried calling today, I heard a chime. Thank Merlin I blocked all his access. He doesn’t deserve any note from me or his damn books!
'Of Granger and Weasley snogging? No thanks.'
‘House arrest was it?’ she asks, her polite smile returning. I hear my mother’s sharp inhale.
, to which he asked a very incredulous
‘Will you offer me a drink or do I have to do it myself?’ I say as I plop down on her sofa as soon as I floo over. She doesn’t skip a beat, puts down her book and goes to the bar.
'See you Potter.'
'I was thinking we could go see the edge of the world.'
Harry curves his back and lowers himself down, making sure they’re still connected and says: “You can fuck me hard now.” Malfoy wraps his arm around his waist, kisses him, all tongue and soft lips. He bends his knees and fucks upward. Harry growls into his mouth and Malfoy does it again and again and again, and Harry loves it all.
‘Where’s Draco?’ Andromeda asks, taking my plate, looking around.
I’ve been so busy this week. Work. But honestly, mainly Malfoy. We’ve been meeting every evening, never walking or eating together anymore. I don’t remember having this much sex in one week before.
We parted ways probably at about midnight, they left together arm in arm, Parkinson kissing my cheeks and Malfoy just grunted a very poisonous
'I'm afraid to ask, but did you make any changes to them too?'
'I am so sorry. I feel awful.'
'You asked. And it's not just them, lots of other Weasleys too.'
'You know what? If you're just going to make fun...'
'Ouch.'
– at 7pm. He asked if I wanted something to drink – no food this time.
‘What in fucking hell are you yelling for?’ she appears from behind a corner in nothing but a towel, her hair wet.
“Do you want to clean yourself up?” Harry motions at Malfoy’s shirt and hair, wet and probably sticky. “I can help you with that.”
‘Of course. So, what, I would just be left to die of a heart attack?’ He rubs his hands on his trousers, his forehead glistening with droplets of sweat.
‘Yeah,’ I nod and continue eating, ‘how do you know?’
'I killed him today,' I say in the silence, void of emotion. His eyes widen a fraction. 'I felt good, for a second. Then I felt nothing. He's dead and I don't care.'
“Oh god!” Harry’s scream is muffled into a pillow. Malfoy drives in few more times and Harry clenches his ass.
'Was it just this once? Or did it happen before?' This hurts.
‘How’s work, Potter?’ I say slower and louder.
‘Yeah? Well two can play this game. Let me... I need to stretch.’ I get an elbow to my shoulder, knee to my thigh and he finally stomps on my foot. I fucking hate him!
'Oh really? You think I'm deaf when you speak to him over the floo, I can hear you whispering my name, I'm not stupid.'
“I think I’ll be going, actually!”
‘Stop whinging. It’s just seven minutes, I think you can make it,’ I tell him and try to adjust in the small space.
'...mhm...'
'You patronizing ass.'
He checks his letters.
'So every time you're gone you'll think I will do it again.'
Ginny is the first one I see, grinning widely and motioning towards the banner
He came to mine on Friday. I, unlike him, offered him pasta I made. He looked at it like it was poisoned but ate without too many scathing comments and then he kneeled in front of me, and afterwards I practically carried him in my room so I could return the favour and then he left once his breathing calmed down.
'I can't... Harry, I...'
‘Well… I guess. I don’t know.’
Doesn't matter when, only matters that I will.
'Don't insult me, please. I know exactly what you were asking.'
. I died then, just a little, froze completely. I don’t know how, but I was already tucked in when Malfoy pushed me away, put his robes back on and said
'No, thank you. I think he ruined my shoes enough already.'
‘You know what? Let’s wait in silence,’ he suggests.
'What do you want to talk about?' I blurt out, I need to know, I need to breathe.
'I did not abandon myself. I am thinking what's next for me.'
‘You two are the ones to talk! You are the same so do not make this into something ugly.’
‘What.’
Malfoy sighs and fling his head back, up to the sky. “There’s a lot you don’t see, Potter.”
and left it at that and
? A fuckbuddy? Not even a buddy, former enemy turned lover? Jesus, that just sounds awful.
'No.'
I take my broom, look at him for the last time and disapparate on the spot.
'I've got an idea. How about we took holiday once I'm back?'
'Yeah maybe.'
'I think you're still not over Ginevra.'
'Thank you. So, you don't want to pour your heart out to me? Old school mate?'
‘You are, of course.’ We stop under the shop roof; I extend my arm for Malfoy to take. ‘Since it was you who dragged me into this, you personally will be on my beck and call, Potter. Every time I will need as much as a cup of tea.’
So. Ginny is leaving on Saturday and she invited me to her farewell party tomorrow. I said I’d think about it but I know I won’t come. I don’t want for everyone to see me cry or something worse, if it would come to it.
Draco thought Potter would keep saying it, after.
'No, I won't... oh my god!'
'So how's working for the Gringotts?'
‘So,’ I start because my manners just won’t allow at least an effort at conversation with my enemy, ‘how’s work, Potter?’
and then louder ‘
'Yes it is. It was stupid to think I could start a new career.'
I drink one glass after another after another. I want to get dead drunk. Not because I am heart broken, I am not, but because it’s Friday and I want to forget the whole week.
‘Really?’ Ron asks, sounding pretty heartbroken himself. ‘Oh, well I guess, if that’s what you want.’
I went home, listened to some wireless, went to bed, stared at the ceiling, thinking back to Friday. Over and over and over. Until I could imagine it to the smallest detail and developed a headache.
Harry closes his eyes when Malfoy makes a loose fist around both of them and slides it up and down slowly. “I like to be on top.”
Since Draco knew of Harry Potter, it never wavered, even when Potter’s hated him.
“You can make tasty lube?” Harry chortles.
This is so not going according to plan. Malfoy was supposed to be mostly quiet the whole time, not instigating a fight.
'Some smugglers. Robard's Patronus didn't really go  into too much detail.'
When Teddy comes back after a while, his hair is strikingly blond, almost white. I have a flashback to Hogwarts. Teddy, though, explains immediately. ‘Grandma, Draco called. I told him he could come in that we have a chocolate cake and Harry’s here, but he didn’t want to. He’s saying hello.’ He grabs the cake now that he’s allowed, no fork, and shoves a piece in his mouth.
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
‘Okay, look,’ I start but he smashes his hands on my desk and leans forward, sneering down at me.
‘Morning,’ I answer, barely opening my mouth.
He loves her, so plain to anyone with eyes, even from the distance
I haven't seen him for three months. I was avoiding him probably just as much as he was avoiding me. It's better that way. I tried to fall out of love with him or something. Thinking, if I wouldn't see him I would forget us. One exceptionally awful night I begged Pansy to obliviate me. She refused. I cried and then I woke up with a headache.
'Thanks.'
'I can't. I'm actually on a date.'
Hermione asks how I am feeling and I say
'Shopping, just like you, I suppose.'
‘Coffee, please,’ I move into the room then and stop near the table.
One, she’s kept hitting on him whenever there’s been an opportunity, whenever they’ve been alone. Harry’s tried really hard to avoid such situations, but somehow she’s still sniffed him out. What was even worse, Malfoy has appeared each time, frowning and taking her with him somewhere. Harry still hopes against all, it wasn’t to go and fuck in some cupboard.
“Do you want to ride me?”
‘Yes.’ I haven’t moved an inch and now his palm is on my chest, tips of his fingers under my shirt. He leans in, breath on my ear and whispers: ‘I adore you, too,’ he presses his lips to my cheek, then on my lips and we’re kissing.
He just laughs like a maniac that he is and then we fall. The broom goes down, albeit slowly and thankfully the fall is softened.

Today, I was testing the new Wheezes dream charm and it wasn’t what I was expecting. I was thinking I would see a meadow or a beach or something else calming and nice, place I would like to visit. Also, as I was told by George, the purpose of the charm is to provide
'Wow. Look at it. So many stars.'
'I do.'
'Would you like to eat? I cooked.'
‘Good. So you’re still working with Malfoy?’ I question.
'You make it so easy sometimes.'
'This close-the-door obsession of yours! And yeah, I might have mentioned something to Ron or Hermione in passing if they ask how you are because you don't go visit them with me anymore. Sorry people are noticing you acting like shit!'
Do I want to be a couple? Do I want people to know?
‘Then what? Will you kill me with your constant whimpering? Just shut up and don’t move and we will be fine!’ I cross my arms on my chest. ‘Who actually invited you here?’ I ask because his presence bothers me. Is he all of a sudden friends with everyone?
'Shouldn't we see something new then? Make the most of it?'
Today I learned that his parents are in France – which I knew already but didn’t want him to know I knew -, that the peacocks fled during the time Voldemort was living there – I asked, the peacocks were not leaving my thoughts for some reason –, that he is friends with Luna, that he doesn’t like wine too much, that Zabini used to have hots for Ginny – I felt only slightly jealous –, that he likes going to muggle places and even owns muggle clothes.
'Because it's yours. And you can definitely keep it. I will keep Grimmauld too.'
'Asleep in two seconds. Unbelievable.'
'I doubt it.'
I was told keeping a diary or writing in general helps with emotions, dealing with them. Well, Hermione told me that. But I don’t know. So far, I still feel like
But the bathroom smells like him. Combination of honey and air and grass? Just … him.
I pinch my nose and exhale. ‘Fine. Go on.’
'So you don't feel anything at all about the whole thing, you don't care an innocent child died because it was your shop that sold the earrings?' Feel something you twat! Show me that there's something good left in you! Make me hate myself less.
'Don't even, Potter. This is my cat. Where's that woman? Go and tell her I'm taking her. Come here, come here Clotilde.'
'A shirt? You'll hate it. Some book about cats? Something sexy? Jewelery?'
'I don't need your help with this. If I'm going to do it, I'm doing it on my own.'
'Yeah. It was a lot of goblin ass-kissing but when's there desperation there is also lack of self-esteem.'
‘I think I’m getting a headache,’ I say and sit down on my chair.
Adnromeda laughs. ‘Yes, Teddy, thank you. We share the same recipe, don’t we Draco?’
“Malfoy!” Harry gasps, relieved. He stumbles back, away from her, towards irritated looking Malfoy.
She basically just told me the same thing as when she was breaking up with me a month ago, something along
'Third but whatever.'
‘Okay. Let’s head back then.’
‘Are you serious? Just because someone said it might be another poison?’ I look at him and he’s suddenly the twelve-year-old brat who must have everything.
‘It’s called making conversation,’ I say and sip my wine.
. I shouted
'Of course I want to.'
How did this lovely day turned out this dreadful? Oh I know. Harry Fucking Potter arrived.
'Agreed!'
I stare.
'Tell me while I suck you off.'
'Okay.'
'I cheated on you.'
Auror Office
'Harry, please. It is never happening again, I swear. I was drunk and I missed you...'
'Hi!'
Auror Office
He throws them on his chair and pushes his sleeves up. He’s wearing that light blue shirt Harry can’t stand because it makes his eyes glow or something. Harry can see the sweat under his arm when he rakes his hand through his hair. He would like to just go over and push his nose into it, as strange as that might sound.
“Because I like to smell of cranberry vodka,” he sneers.
was what he said three weeks ago.
He makes a step. She puts her hand on his shoulder. “I meant with you, not alone. We can talk.”
'What hate?'
‘Fine,’ she says and looks at me. ‘Did you bring it?’
'That will be very awkward lunch tomorrow. I cannot believe you.'
I decide to tell the truth. ‘I did, since you don’t seem the type.’
'Starting? I thought they were already warmed up. Well, except Ron.'
When he doesn't move, I speak: 'So?'
'He will. I wonder which team he'll choose.'
Magical Massages
'Fuck...yeah...slow down, baby.'
'Nothing, honestly.'
I want to scream and cry and destroy and cry.
'I will.' I say and move even slower. He doesn't like it, says my name,
‘You’re serious? Harry, please,’ Ron sits down on the bed, ‘do you know who is coming if not you? Ginny somehow invited herself and Parkinson, I don’t even know how it happened but here we are and only you can save me.’
'We would find something together. Something we would both like.'
‘They do, but still. How are you feeling?’ she asks, narrowing her eyes.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
“Cum inside.”
'Wow.'
‘You are supposed to agree with me,’ I tell her and flop down next to her on the couch cushions, laying my head in her lap. She pushes her fingers in my hair and starts stroking.
That's why, because my heart is breaking all over again. And it's, once again, just my own fucking fault!
‘Faster,’ I manage but she says
'I... if that's what you want.'
‘All right, you two. I’m going to bake the Treacle tart and I do not want to hear anything,’ she warns me, pointing at me and then at Teddy, ‘be careful!’
'I asked Neville and he gave me some charms, so it should be fine.'
I avert my gaze and feel my face heat up a bit. ‘I didn’t choose the place. Let’s just focus on the task at hand.’
and told him it’s still new and a bit confusing and I had this feeling that I wanted to tell him it’s a man, that it’s Malfoy to just tell someone who could maybe talk me out of it. But I didn’t and he grinned and for some reason I asked him to not tell Hermione or anyone else yet.
'And every year you get me something nice.'
'I'm sorry.' I wait for an agonizing five seconds and when there's no change I walk away, shut one door and another and I'm outside, alone, with this fucking pain everywhere.
Jesus, I think I hear her coming.
‘What?’ I ask, kissing his shoulder.
'I am, I will be, I guess. But this whole, long process!'
'I'm sorry. Harry, I really am.'
‘Potter, seriously, go home or whatever, I don’t need your help,’ I tell him for the tenth time when he’s shuffling the pages.
It’s all bullshit, I’m so mad. It’s Potter’s fault, anyway. He was reckless and dumb. Plus, I’m not an auror as I was telling them from the very beginning, and they still took me with them on a supposedly easy mission. Well, who’s laughing now? Definitely not Potter.
There’s a pop and Twinkle appears. ‘Missus Malfoy, lunch is almost being ready,’ she bows and pops right away.
‘Yes you are darling,’ Pansy smiles and sits down on my desk, turning back to Blaise. ‘Did you tell him?’
‘Interesting,’ mother responds and drinks her tea. In the past she would probably got a fit, but being a part of a losing side of war changes people. She did her best to unlearn the worst, but some things are still foreign to her. Like understanding why a pureblood witch would decide to work with muggles when her family’s fortune is there for the taking. So it is me who asks

'I can fall asleep without it.'
‘Oh. And who is that?’ my mother asks.
‘You would be taken back to the house,’ I shrug.
So, we talked for a while, it was nice, like old times. I almost forgot how funny she was.
