So, when summoned Severus had done his best to prepare himself for multiple different scenarios. Everything from raids with mass killings, or political plots of assassination or torture either his or to participate in someone else. He had thought he had covered all of the options but what had not even crossed his mind was the thought he might be called on for his healing abilities. Or that the Dark Lord would have continued to not act like what was expected.
“Are you sure there is nothing I can do that will convince you to come back?” She asked kindly. Severus shook his head firmly.
Harry slumped back not expecting an adult to calming agree with his outburst. it took all the wind out of his sails
“Good. Here is where things can get bollocks up easily. Sometimes people say yes but they don’t mean yes.”
“No pain or weakness?” Severus looked at him askance. Putting aside the question Harry asked as he needed to prioritise and his health came first. Harry squirmed then admitted.
“The only features you have in common are as follows. You are both male, both have black hair, both wear glasses. If that was all that was need in order to call someone your father, then congratulations Harry, you now have hundreds if not thousands of Fathers in Britain alone.”
And even some saying. “that’s what his cock looks like? It’s got some length, I suppose, but there is nothing to it. His girl ain’t going to tell the difference between that and his fingers”
His dreams were vague but terrifying, there was no defined shapes everything hidden behind a thick smoke cover but his heart pounded in fear and dread crept up behind him, while guilt clutched his ankles pulling him down. He shot up in bed a scream strangled in his throat.
Determination filled Harry, he wanted to get better and to be able to move on from this. What better way than to do it for someone he loved? This was perfect it was killing two birds with one stone. Harry got to do something to make Sirius feel good for a while and he got to work on overcoming a trauma from his past. Harry gently pulled the blankets off them both, then slid down the bed. He carefully reached out and nudged Sirius top leg slightly so he could get access. Then with hands he tried to stop from trembling, he slowly parted the slit in Sirius pyjamas’ pants and pulled out his penis. Harry took a deep breath, taking a moment to look at it and realise the sight of it wasn’t that scary. It looked pretty similar to his penis, just that he was looking at it from a different angle. Feeling more confident, Harry opened his mouth and got to work.
Oh, Merlin, that felt nice. No wonder Lucius was content to let Narcissa brush his hair for hours. It also explained the pleased cat-like expression on Lucius’ face. Severus could feel his body melting into a relaxed heap leaning against Tom’s legs. Secretly, in his heart, Severus hoped Harry would manipulate Tom into doing this again for him.
Author freezes in the crouched position and holds breath as the angry horde of readers stampedes past the hiding spot.
Harry let out a high-pitched scream, the same noise a rabbit makes just before it’s torn to pieces by the fox. The sound of shattering glass from below cause everyone to turn their heads and look out the bedroom door.
Blaise got the strong feeling that it wasn’t because Harry was shy that they were holding back, but that they genuinely weren’t engaging in any. The thought brought a hint of melancholy to him. While Blaise would never want to be in either of their shoes, the fact they had such a strong relationship was one that he was kind of jealous of. It was something that he didn’t think was in the cards for him. He was pretty sure he was going to be a player moving from one person to another, he couldn’t see himself settling down with just one person for the rest of his life.
Harry nodded and Severus pleased with how well this was going walked over to the chair that sat in-between their beds. He sat down and pulled the parchment from his pocket. He smoothed it out on his knees and cleared his throat.
Feeling confident that he had everything he needed, Severus headed out to the bedroom that both Harry and he were staying in. Knocking on the door he entered and saw Harry sitting on the top of the made bed. He was quietly relieved to see that his godson was currently not glued to Harry’s side. All the better then. He wouldn’t have to ask Draco to leave.
“The point being, Pup all I was fucking using to think with was my bollock and my cock. So, when some pouncey fluffy wings sprouted out of my back, I wanted them fucking gone quick smart. How the hell was I going to get laid if I had chicken wings growing out of my bloody body? Then there was the fact that my dear bitch of a mother kept raving on about wings being a sign of purest blood or some shite. So, I got my best mate to cut them out for me.”
Harry blinked then slowly got to his feet, he had to lean against the headstone until the pins and needles withdrew from his legs. Spotting his wand Harry scrambled in a mad dash and snatched it up, holding it defensively he spun around but nothing moved. Harry wasn’t sure what was happening but he didn’t want to be in the graveyard for a moment longer. He quickly cast a spell at Wormtail tying him up with ropes then floated his stunned form over to where Cedric’s body lay in the grass. Harry knelt and making sure he had a good hold on both of them he summoned the cup. It flew across the grounds and thudded into Harrys chest. The hooking feeling from behind his navel grabbed hold of him and the graveyard went spinning away.
Harry had taken to avoiding all reflective surfaces. He hated the very sight of his freakish shrunken skin and hollow cheeks. He also tried to avoid touching himself as much as possible, he didn’t like the feel of his bones sticking out. It was like even his skeleton found him abhorrent and was doing its best to break out of his skin and flee.
Tom sat in one of the uppermost tier seats in the courtroom, his view half obscured by a column. Tom had chosen this seat in particular. People tried to avoid it, but Tom always knew how to make to best out of the cards he was dealt. He cast a wandless spell that allowed him to see one way through the column anyone on the other side couldn’t see him. Keeping him hidden from view. It had the advantage to be in just the right spot to hear what was being said from all corners of the courtroom.
“Thanks, Kiddo, ok so I’ve covered the whole family don’t so sex stuff, now onto the more complicated shite. Figuring out when it’s ok to do sex stuff with others.” Sirius ran a hand through his hair as he gave it some thought.
( Author plans to end chapter with Harry shredding the leaf. Cackles madly........ Stops and looks over the supply of glitter realises they do not have enough to blind all their readers when they come after the Author with pitch forks..... Mutters sourly and adds on Severus bedside vigil.)
“No, don’t be stupid Potter, only your gay, cause you’re the one sucking my dick. I’m not gay. I don’t want to suck dick.”
“Wait,” Sirius said, attempting to quickly jump from the bed then wincing as his arousal made this impossible.
He did consent to drinking a cup of tea and slipping an apple into his pocket for later. There was a chance he might become hungry at some stage today and he had been squirrelling food away since he was five years old. There was no way he could break the habit now.
“Ah, yes, I’m afraid the paperwork is getting quite out of hand. Still needs must. You’ll let me know if things change?”
Seeing that nothing else was forthcoming Severus picked up the parchment checking the points marked out so he could get back on track.
“Come with me, I want to show you something,” Mr Malfoy said rising from his chair and heading out of the office. He took them to a gallery and then pointed at a painting in the corner.
Blaise was the next to arrive, and he collapsed with a huff into a neighbouring armchair. This made sense. Harry as the ugliest was the quickest in the shower. Once he had done the basic wash of his body and hair, there was no point in staying in any longer. Nothing was going to change how he looked. Blaise was an alright looking bloke, so, therefore, he should logically take longer. Understandable, if you were blessed with as much fitness as Draco, you would need the longest time to make sure you took proper care of all the perfection. It wasn’t a case of being vain, but of respecting and looking after what Merlin gave you.
He was the Hero of the wizarding world. The boy-who-lived. He couldn’t afford to be weak. Hero’s didn’t hide under blankets. They didn’t curl up and cry when things didn’t go their way. He needed to stop this feeling sorry for himself this instant. Harry told himself to straighten up and stop sniffling.
“My dear boy, how else do you imagine that we are going to see if a curse attached to your body if we don’t look?” Dumbledore asked patiently while around him random people muttered to themselves about how this was proof, he had the stocky curse Hermione had talked about.
“Bugger, I didn’t fucking ask. Are you cool with me taking my shirt off? Cause it’s totally fucking fine if you’re not.”
“Come now Harry,” Voldemort scolded mildly. “Don’t take me for a fool, I could give the most convincing allocution that has ever been heard and you would still doubt me and not believe a word I said, how could you not? You are tied up and held at my mercy.”
Harry pushed the soaked through sheets off the bed and grabbed his favourite jumper, pulling it over his head and hugged himself tight. It still smelled faintly of Draco’s cologne and it only made Harry miss him more.
Draco couldn’t possibly have wanted him. He’d somehow found out that Harry wanted him and reacted accordingly to improve his situation. If Harry hadn’t known better, he’d have thought Draco had reciprocated his feelings – but Draco Malfoy hated him, that much was a universal truth and would never change. The sun rose in the east, the earth revolved around the sun and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy hated each other. A cold ugly laugh escaped Harry at the notion. At least one of them would safely go on hating the other, probably more so after the liberties Harry had taken, but to him things would never be the same.
The crowd around him finally seemed to remember he was still there and he had to force his way through them, threatening them until they all turned tail and ran. When he reached Harry, he was almost completely dehydrated and there was a milky-white film across his eyes. Draco brought Harry back to the surface with him where the others were waiting.
Luckily his flat wasn’t very far from the park and it took Draco only ten minutes to walk home through the descending darkness. When he reached his front door, he noticed an ash-blond man dressed in plain clothes trying to inconspicuously study the bus schedule while at the same time keeping an eye on him.
It had been raining all day and it didn’t look like it was about to stop any time soon. Draco had pretty much given up on ever finding help and was sitting by the window, staring out into the grey distance and feeling sorry for himself. He was wearing one of Harry’s jumpers and was hiding his shame under the large and warm hood. The tea that Harry had placed on the window sill before him that morning had gone cold a long time ago. Footsteps were approaching his location, he didn’t turn around.
This was going to be so awkward, he thought, as he squeezed between Malfoy and the back of the sofa. He pulled up the duvet to cover them both, wrapping his arms around Malfoy from behind, running them up and down his torso and arms. Warmth from the fire caressed Harry’s face, where he lay behind Malfoy, feeling his cold frame shake against Harry’s chest. Slowly but surely the shivers subsided and Malfoy’s breathing began to even out. Harry raised himself up to look at Malfoy’s face and was glad to finally see his features relaxed in sleep.
He’d sat down at his kitchen table and almost reverently unscrolled the small piece of parchment, smoothening it out on the flat surface before reading it. A single line of slightly scrawny writing had been all it contained. Draco had read it and smiled.
“Yes, I got what I needed. Thank you Percy.” He points at the small stack still left behind. “Can you make sure that I can include the content of those files as well? The others were very helpful and I don’t want to miss someone we might otherwise be able to help get out of an abusive situation.”
“I’m sorry. I just couldn’t let you leave like that. I don’t even know whether you want this, want me, but I had to try. Please, before you say anything, please think about it. And if you do, if you want this or if you don’t, send me an owl.”
“That’s kind of fucked up.” Is the first thing Millicent says to him, it makes him reel for a moment before she continues, “but then so are you and so is Draco. I believe things will be fine eventually.”
Harry didn’t know what he was expecting, but when Draco surged forward to press his own lips back against Harry’s with a desperate sound, he could only kiss back. Harry immediately loved the slide of Draco’s lips against his. He nipped Draco’s lower lip and quickly soothed the hurt with his tongue. Draco opened his mouth on a moan granting him access.
"Thank Kreacher," Draco shrugged and stepped passed him; with one look over the shoulder he added. "The couch is yours tonight."
All in all, the box made him happy and Andromeda gracefully accepted the bar of Honeydukes dark chocolate he offered her. He knew that was the only flavor she'd eat on occasion.
Draco explained everything thoroughly and even with some technical details that went way above his ability to understand. Harry appreciated it anyway. If anything, Harry was lost on the rest Draco said because his excitement bubbled over. Since Draco knew and understood, he didn't gave it much mind and wondered how it would feel to fly on a magic carpet and if he would like it. He loved flying on his broom and made a mental note to press for a ride when they got back to planning.
Two car doors slammed shut, one followed by the other and quickly after that, the blond stomped into the house without as much of a word to her as he pushed past, dropped op the couch and covered himself with a blanket. He did so from toe to head, leaving nothing but a tuft of blond hair visible. Obviously he wasn't going to talk with anyone.
He explained a floo ticket, where one essentially buys a list of floo network names and one hops in and out of a series of fireplaces until they exit the last one, close as possible to their chosen destination.
"Yeah, alright! I know!" Harry yelled back, he ducked between the helium like balloons swarming in air to get out of their purple kitchen. To his dismay, he had to hopscotch to cross the hallway and climb up by the railing of the stairs because the steps had turned into a slide an hour before. Already used to the mud puddles and the weird dance he smiled and walked into the library only to have the smile wiped off to shock.
Harry blanched, shook his head wildly and got ready to take a bite but decided to put indeed some effort in. "I can cook as you know, but I actually can make a full traditional English Christmas dinner too.. Then again, how does rabbit for a main dish sound?"
Harry gaped. He had said it as a half joke but now thinking about it, it may not be the worst idea he ever had and he grinned at Draco. "Deal. You're coming with me."
Thus, knowing that; Harry had sourly set off, feeling that it was the same story as the front door and had taken a bottle of fire whiskey up. Not even intending to try. After a few hours, he had, with a sarcastic stance and in an unmistakably drunk drunk state, twirled and bowed after smashing the bottle broken on the door. Then, he had gone on by turning around, giving a roar and skipping over the mud puddles, another mishap in the house, to the master bedroom. Harry had never heard the tick of the door opening but Draco had heard the roar, gone up, seen the door stand ajar and smiled when he had followed Harry into the bedroom.
She tried to reason Harry, bring him back to reality, but she failed because she had yelled and cried, called the friendship between the two boys a toxic tryst that was pulling them further down. Harry had ripped away - telling her that it wasn't true and made way, leaving her behind, standing alone.
He knocked on the rickety door and they waited for several minutes. "I don't know what's taking so long," Charlie said, a little confused. "Maybe something is went wrong again, I did let them know we'd stop by."
Draco raised an eyebrow and got up from the bed. Harry looked through the window again as if somebody had stung him badly, he started to run through the room, looking for a place to hide. Even if, there was none.
"Potion ingredients," Charlie muttered, examining a stem of some plant, shook his head and moved along to examine another. Harry followed. "To be honest, being a Dragon handler doesn't make much money and I'm as good with plants as I'm with the magnificent beasts."
"Occupied." Which was, technically the truth. He waved the papers. "I'll serve him the summons but out of curiosity, what will happen if he doesn't comply?"
She smiled triumphantly and Ron patted her on the back as if to congratulate her on a barb well done. Draco took it as a cue to change tactics.
"You and I," Draco moved a finger between the both of them and huffed, as his other hand pushed his hair back in slight frustration. "We need to talk."
"You've got loads to do, I see." She said, standing in the door opening of the kitchen where Harry already had installed himself for a long study session.
Charlie shrugged. "Thought I'd point it out that it doesn't really matter what the state is versus the treasure is hold, its unmistakable the most valued for us and I think, for the wizard population of the world in the whole."
Draco nodded and lazily dropped himself on the comfortable bed in the middle of the room, waiting for Harry to get himself ready to start.
There wasn't anything left to say when Harry's front door was blown down. Harry jumped behind the couch Draco sat on. The blast knocked Draco sprawling, arms and legs wide by pressure and the couch almost toppled over. It wobbled on its legs but remained standing. Draco tried to move but three wands were shoved into his face. Two came close, one actually touched the tip of his nose. When he looked up, he knew he was toast. The two Weasleys were there, along with another Auror he'd never seen before. The man was tall, broad and very, very angry.
She was about to give both a piece of her mind when Harry turned around. He was pale, shaking and barely still standing. "Andy.. " He squeaked, his hand reaching up to touch his chest. "I don't feel well." Promptly, his eyes rolled back and he tumbled to the floor.
“Stop it, you’re really starting to freak me out,” Draco said. And it was true, only for all the wrong reasons.
And then it was finally over. The flames rose high one last time and then all that was left of the diary was a pile of ashes in the fireplace. Draco felt as if a veil had been lifted. Sensation rushed back to him seemingly intensified a thousand-fold. The hard wooden floor beneath him digging into his legs, the smell of wet earth and rain from outside and the warmth of Harry at his back being the most predominant ones.
Harry was genuinely worried about Draco, because the few times he had caught glimpses of him in the last two weeks, Draco had looked haggard. If only Harry could figure out what was wrong with him then maybe he could fix things. Not for the first time Harry wished that his silence about the matter wasn’t part of the contract he had entered into. He knew that if he could just be honest with Draco, he wouldn’t feel so disgusted about himself. Every time he had seen Draco, except for that first time in the pub, he had lied to him.
“I have to admit that I haven’t been back there since we spoke, so I don’t know about that, but I think I might know what to do about the nightmares.”
“I’ve wanted to touch you, suck you, fuck you, bring you off for months now. I never thought you’d let me.” This statement was followed by a firm stroke on his cock, making Draco whimper.
“No, I promised I’d let you show me why this,” Draco said decisively and gestured encompassing everything around them, “Muggle experience is fun and Malfoys are known for keeping their word.”
“Yes, although I am not sure she’ll still think that. If Father dies of apoplexy after seeing the two of us together.”
Draco didn’t think that he deserved such a kind reaction from someone who had essentially been tortured and locked up in his own basement for months. Luna however didn’t give him a choice.
“Protego Maxima,” they said in unison and Draco let his magic go, feeling it guided by Potter’s. It was as if Potter had got under his skin, was warming him from the inside. It was too close, too intimate and intimidating as hell and yet it wasn’t enough. Part of Draco longed to turn around and capture Potter’s lips in a kiss, finally releasing the pent up tension. When he focused on his wand again, he could see the spell had begun.
“Draco Malfoy! I know you’ve been back at the Manor for a month now. You could have got in touch with me you know? Your sentence was served and there’s no reason to keep old friends out in the cold!”
“Oh Fuck! I am sorry Malfoy, let me just…” Potter stuttered, as he looked around for the glasses, picking up the delicate frame, his cheeks red with what could only be utter mortification. He mended the lenses by casting a quick
Harry spluttered as he tried to find his balance and gave chase. He managed to get up after the second try only to realise that he was completely starkers.
He jumped in his chair when the door to his study suddenly flew open, slamming against the wall and revealing an incredibly pissed off looking Harry Potter.
Of course it had to be Potter, as if Draco’s days weren’t bad enough without anyone showing up. It wasn’t like he’d made a special effort to avoid Potter after the trial, but seeing him again reminded Draco of all the things that were wrong with his life. As if searching for re-assurance, his hand slipped into his pocket unbidden and closed around the small glass phial.
After a while, Potter finally pulled away from him, pushing Draco back so he was sitting on Potter’s knees instead of directly in his lap. Potter took both of Draco’s hands into his, staring down at them in wonder. He had trouble meeting Draco’s eyes, as he held his hands and mumbled. “I’d like that very much.”
He sat up with a start. He was in his own bed, the soft morning light streaming in through the curtains he had forgotten to close the night before. The remnants of the dream clung to him like spider webs and it took a moment before he could remember. He was Harry and he was in his own bed at 12 Grimmauld Place, where he was supposed to be.
“Since the sentence said that you need twenty-four-hour supervision you will be staying at Grimmauld Place with me. We’ll pick up your things from Ministry Convict Accommodation later today and get you settled in at my house tonight. You will floo to work from there every morning and report in with me half an hour before shift starts. After work you’ll go straight back to your room at my house. You will only leave your room to eat, work or use the facilities. Any questions?”
After a cup of coffee and a scone with clotted cream, Harry decided that it was time to have a proper look around the inside, now that he wasn’t tired from hours of flying. For some reason the lighthouse was in what the Ministry called a “no Apparition Zone” and despite being an Unspeakable, Harry didn’t know why some regions that weren’t under any kind of protective spells, like Hogwarts, were still impossible destinations.
Draco seemed to spend most of his time reading a leather bound note book or gazing thoughtfully at the large shell Draco’s mother had described to Harry. None of those items seemed particularly dangerous. If only Harry could come up with a solution to his problem. He knew he was grasping at straws when he went to the library and read up on the kind of shell Draco kept staring at. Hours spent in a dusty room full of old tomes brought him no closer to discovering what was going on.
“So,” Potter said before strangely enough grabbing Draco’s elbow and turning him back to the sculpture Draco had admired earlier, “what is it about this piece that got your attention?”
No, he shouts, struggling more than before, but not for long, since that one shout has taken the last bit of precious air with it, as it rises to the surface in a series of small silvery bubbles.
“I— I don’t know.” Draco had no idea what was going on, a moment ago he had been convinced that he wanted Harry to see the diary.
His tea had gone cold a while ago, but Harry couldn’t be bothered to re-heat it. He stared into the dark swirling liquid, its surface disturbed only by the tiny waves the constantly stirring spoon was creating.
He felt lost now that it had been torn out of his grasp. He was probably supposed to feel relief or joy – he assumed those feelings might be appropriate and come later. At this moment all he knew was that he felt destitute and lonely, like a sailor lost at sea whose ship had torn itself free of the wharf and now drifted anchorless and rudderless to Merlin knew where.
It was still dark and Draco couldn’t tell whether it was because it was dark where he was, or because his eyes were closed. Deciding to put his theory to the test he tried to open his eyes. On the third try bright light assaulted his retinas and instead of trying to open his eyes, he now squeezed them shut to keep out the bright glare. Next he tried speaking, but all that came out was a croak. He tried again, more forcefully this time. “Where…?”
“Because I wanted to. I’ve wanted to for a long time and I thought it would be my last chance.” Harry closed his eyes.
The fact that Harry didn’t want him here hurt more than it should have. Reacting to Draco’s frown, his voice became more conciliatory as he went on.
Harry had tried to find out more about the secret room Draco had claimed to have found, but when he mentioned it, Draco had pretended not to know what he was talking about. When they had been at the flea market Draco had eyed globes and maps, he didn’t even seem to be aware of it at the time. And now there were these books and a bunch of rolled up maps. Harry didn’t know what to make of it. Maybe the family history would shed some light on it.
“I’m glad to hear it, you deserve it. How long do you think Scorpius will be working on your inventory? I might have plans to go out later and I want him home before then.”
Draco slumped in his chair in the study. It was dark and cold outside and snow was covering the grounds, there was nothing to do but worry and obsess until the new potion ingredients arrived.
“Fuck!” The word didn’t do how Harry felt justice. Just when he thought he’d finally been able to make things right again, fate decided to show him just
“First we need to cast some ground rules. You will call me either Mr. Potter or Auror Potter, both when we are alone or at the ministry. You will do anything I ask you to, without complaint, no matter how menial the task might seem to you. In return I’ll make sure the others don’t come up with tasks just to humiliate you. You will not have any contact or relations with any Death Eaters or any of your former house mates.”
It couldn’t have been more obvious – Harry didn’t want him anymore. The man couldn’t even stand to be touched by him. When he realised that the man couldn’t even stand to be touched by him, all was lost.
Harry and Draco seemed to dance around each other. Yes, there was a sort of combined interest in meeting again. They had fun when they were together, but what they had defied rules or definition and some days it drove Harry up the wall. This uncertainty of where he stood. He knew what he wanted, but he had no idea whether Draco even saw him like that, or whether he was just spending time with Harry to pass the time waiting for the perfect pure-blood witch to come along.
Draco tried to consolidate the new information he had just received with what he had thought to be the truth. He didn’t know whether he was ready to forgive Harry, but he could at least accept that Harry had not acted out of malice, but rather out of kindness. Draco made a conscious effort to push his worries away.
“I agree. You’d better take my invisibility cloak. I’ll try to distract Ron so you can get out of here without being discovered,” Harry said, pressing the thin shimmering fabric of the cloak into his hand. When Draco turned to go, Harry pulled him close once more, holding on to the cloak and dragging Draco back in for a short, heated snog.
“Shhh Draco. It’ll be okay. Everything’s going to be okay.” She cradled his shaking form in her arms, rocking him back and forth. “Does he really mean that much to you?” She asked.
Harry broke their kiss and nibbled on Draco’s earlobe before whispering to him, making him gasp involuntarily. Draco could feel delicious tremors run through his entire body.
Just when he thought everything was all right, Harry broke the kiss and pushed him back so hard he fell to the floor. Looking up in confusion, he saw Harry’s face crunched up in despair and sorrow, his eyes wide and scared and some nameless emotion flitting through them before his mask fell back into place. Harry wiped the back of his hand across his mouth with a disgusted look, as if trying to erase a bad flavour.
“What are you looking at me like that for Gin?” Harry’s voice sounded slightly strained as if he was trying to keep his temper under control. His statement was followed by a long pause, until finally Ginevra decided to reply.
, he thinks and can only watch in horror as her smile grows ever wider, revealing sharp pointy teeth, before she goes on. “I’m the last siren that you see, before you die.”
He simply nodded. Pansy would know what was best for him. She’d proven time and again that she was better at taking care of him than he was, just like Harry had been.
“Doesn’t mean I have to like it, why does it have to be Ferret Face anyway, couldn’t we have got someone else?”
“Are you alright, Darling?” his mother asked, the back of her hand pressed gently against his forehead. “I hope you’re not coming down with something. All this exposure to the elements can’t be good for you. You know you have a somewhat fragile constitution.”
Harry lowered his eyes. He had just put his heart out there and while he didn’t know what else he could have done, waiting for Draco’s reaction made him feel incredibly vulnerable.
Ligeia’s head breaks through the surface only seconds after they have reached the safety of the shore. Her face is a mask of anger, her hair dishevelled and the beautiful tiara adorning it askew. Her hands outstretched like claws, she reaches for them as she ascends the stairs. Draco lies there panting, beside the man who saved him. He has got no strength left and still she is advancing. Something tells him that she can’t leave the water, but then the lake begins to swell and slowly, but surely the water begins to crawl towards Draco and his saviour.
“Did she now?” Draco smirked. “Be my guest,” he added nodding towards the chair across from him, regretting the motion immediately as his head seemed to spin, which was particularly annoying, because Harry wouldn’t have been able to see the gesture in the dark anyway.
he tells Draco and Draco knows that it is true but he also knows that he is not strong. Ligeia has power over his mind and body that he cannot resist.
Harry was grinning were he pressed his face into Draco’s neck when he heard Granger sputter in the background.
Potter lips were slightly chapped but somehow Draco didn’t mind, simply enjoyed the slide of their mouths against each other. He untangled their hands to get a better hold of Potter, climbing into his lap and turning his head this way and that to get better access. They kissed for a long time until Draco’s lips felt puffy and slick with saliva. He wouldn’t have wanted to have it any other way. He broke their kiss, to pepper a series of pecks along Potter’s cheek, his nose, the closed lids of his eyes, his forehead and finally on the corners of his smiling mouth.
“Yes, I am convinced that it is in my son’s possession. I want you to find it and destroy it. This most likely means that you’ll have to spend more time with him. However, he cannot know about this. I cannot make that clear enough. If I have to, I will demand you vouch-safe your silence by entering into an unbreakable vow, for now, however, I will accept your word for it.”
“So beautiful,” Harry said dreamily. His hand moved up further, tracing the outline of Draco’s Dark Mark. Draco tried to pull his hand away without success; he didn’t want Harry to touch the part of himself that he was most ashamed of. To his surprise the grip on his hand merely intensified trapping his hand in Harry’s grip, the repetitive motion of his fingers never ceasing.
Spending time with Draco quickly became something Harry enjoyed. The man had become so insinuated in his life that every morning when Harry was trying to get his hair to behave and inevitably failed, he imagined Draco’s voice and snide comments. It should have been mortifying but it grounded him and usually meant that he would start his day with a smile.
“Yes, no, maybe.” Potter sighed and finally looked down at their joined hands as if he couldn’t quite believe his eyes. “You see, I should be at the Weasleys’ right now, having dinner, talking about how lovely everything is, cooing over babies and this year. Well this year I just couldn’t.” Potter’s voice faltered for a moment and it became obvious he had to force the next words out. “They love me, I know that, and I should be there, but it’s like they all moved on without me, somehow they are happy, they’ve finished becoming something else and they simply are where they needed to get. I’m just here, just me. Just Harry.” He smiled sadly. “Even Neville is married now with a pregnant wife. I know he always had this potential and I’m happy for him, I really am, but sometimes I wish… I wish our roles had been reversed. Sometimes I wish I was someone else, not just someone people only notice when they get in their way.”
Feeling suddenly shy he started to get up and mumbled: “I’ll clean them up right away, let me just go fetch a broom.”
His therapist’s smile seemed strained and Harry felt even worse when she went on to say, “If you must know, my little girl is sick and I need to go home to take care of her.”
“I have looked over your test results and I’ve got some good news and some bad news.” Potter said neutrally.
“Maybe you should look into what happened at King’s Cross Station three years ago, not everyone is as lucky as you. Good night, Harry.”
“What am I… you’re kidding right? You didn’t just forget that you asked me to see you for lunch to celebrate my quitting the Auror department?”
“Poxy, I am leaving now, I didn’t hear anything. There’s really no need to punish yourself!” Harry said stepping away; he cast one look at her, seeing relief appear on her face for the briefest moment. He nodded at her once and disapparated.
“More, Draco, please, I need…” his breath hitched as Draco’s prick hit his sweet spot. “Oh fuck yes!”
“I’m saying that last night must have been quite the night, because I can’t remember anything past hanging out at the Leaky with Ron, going to the Loo and then nothing.” Harry was surprised how easy the lie slipped from his lips, feeling slightly uneasy, he went on. “So, I’m really sorry, I actually have no idea. We must’ve gone home together or something.”
“Only once, after a couple of rounds of cruciatus curse, he ranted and raved before getting me to brew him some basic potions. Since nothing of any significance happened, I didn’t bother with tying up some of your time but send a written report.” Severus indicated with his head towards Dumbledore’s desk that was currently covered in letters. One of which would be the report that Severus had written and sent weeks ago.
Blaise diverted his eyes once again as Draco fed Harry from the small bowl that came out for him every two hours. Blaise was pleased to see someone was finally doing something about Harry stick figure impersonation, but he couldn’t watch Draco feed him. It was weird because Blaise could sit through a full-on orgy and not be discomforted, yet this act felt so intimate between the two of them that Blaise had never felt more like a third wheel intruding then now. He would prefer it if the two of them were doing sexual acts instead. But there had not been even a hint of it the entire time he was here
Tom held the square covered board along with the required white and black circle stones as he entered one of the smaller sunrooms. He had asked via house elf if Mr Potter was amiable to receiving his company and had been oddly surprised when the answer had come back positive. He had found himself unusually attached to young Harry. He as of yet had no explanation why it was that he had wasted countless hours worrying about the child's well been. Or why he had made sure that Severus and Narcissa had everything they required to attend to Harry’s needs. So far, he had kept away from being physically present knowing that he was a symbol of all the suffering Harry had gone through. But he was hoping that if they had small controlled interactions that Tom would have the chance to slowly change Harry’s perspective on him.
At this Severus realised a couple of things. Firstly, that Narcissa had made no move to enter the room despite her only child who was going through a massive change being within it. And secondly, she had a hand on the back of Lucius neck that was clutching tightly betraying her feelings despite her pleasantly polite face and smooth voice.
Draco now knew enough that Harry had to eat his entire bowl of food. And only once he was done would he be allowed to eat sweets. Which in Harry case meant fruit. Even so, Draco was careful to only offer him a small amount. He didn’t want to overload Harry’s stomach and ruin all the good work they had just done. Unlike other teenagers, Harry could not afford to fill up on junk food and not eat his normal meal. Draco for the first time in his life was restricting his diet to keep Harry company. This would be the first summer where he did not spend days on random occasions gorge himself on products from Honey dukes and even after the anti-nausea potion not having any room left for his dinner.
The doors to the hospital wing banged open making Harry jump his heart pounding in his throat. Snape strode in face thunderous followed by pinched lipped McGonagall and trailing them looking flustered was Fudge.
Piers came with a groan and fell back, collapsing on Harry’s bed. He made no move to cover himself up, pants still down around his ankles, instead closed his eyes with a blissful smile. Harry spat everything in his mouth onto the floor. “I don’t consent, I don’t consent” He babbled looking up at Dudley.
“Cause you were asleep so you couldn’t drink any fire whiskey. And cause I’m a kid I’m too young to drink?”
“I found out that James Potter like a lot of the male Pure-bloods was sterile and unable to sire any child. It's unclear whether Mr Potter ever knew of this information but his wife certainly did. Around the same time as this medical test was being run, Lily Potter purchased both a fertility potion and a love draught. After that, the trail runs cold. I’m afraid the next place to check for clues will be within your mind.” Tom informed Severus who had become expressionless as he went on. Hinting at the depth of emotions he must be burring under his Occlumency.
“I promise, I have not been keeping this information from you to dangle over your head and only offer it at an opportune moment. I myself only just discovered it when you arrived here and needed healing.”
Draco had known that Harry was important and not because of any of that boy-who-lived crap. His instincts had been telling him so right from the start. And Draco had done everything he could think of to make sure he was involved with Harry. And alright he could admit it now, some of his pigtail pulling had been a bit harder than necessary, and yes there were one or two instances where he had gone way too far. But he had been a kid and desperate. He hadn’t understood why he needed Harry’s attention he just knew subconsciously that it was important.
Narcissa gathered up some simple healing potions and organised the house-elves to pack multiple containers of Harry’s special food for Severus to take back with him.
Tom sat back in his chair and watched interestedly as Dumbledore walked stiffly over to a table. He was drawing a lot of attention as he was the only person who didn’t have his face concealed. The person Dumbledore was meeting looked like they wanted to be anywhere else when Dumbledore sat down.
Author never though the childish game of hide and seek would give them such valuable life skills, nor that the army camo clothes they had in the wardrobe from their teenage rebel phase would come in handy.
Narcissa had been able to reassure him that he hadn’t caused irreversible damage. But an important lesson had been learned. Eros wanted to do what was best for their mates and that sometimes meant saying no. Because he had come into his inheritance so young Narcissa was reaching out to other Eros to build Draco a safety net of guides and teachers to help Draco come into his own and to learn which instincts to listen to and which had to be controlled.
Sirius took him to his bedroom and got Harry some of his own clothes. He then left Harry alone in the room to get changed. Even though the clothes swam on him Harry was extremely grateful. He didn’t want to wear Ron’s stuff. Once he was done he let Sirius back in and took a grinned when Sirius both locked and warded the room keeping all the other busybody out. He even added a sound charm, so they didn’t have to listen to either Molly’s scolding or Dumbledore lecture.
Harry just stood there not moving or talking, staring blankly as various members of the Order came up to him to say their farewells. It was only when Sirius came over and wrapped him in a bone-crunching hug that life came back to Harry. He wrapped his arms as tight as he could around Sirius ribs and held on with all his might.
“Here,” Draco thrust a bulky wrapped material bundle at him. Severus clutched it, bemused. “It’s my old camping tent. I might not be able to do much for my mate, but I can at least offer him shelter from the elements.” Severus looked at Draco with pride.
“There will be some of Mr Weasley’s clothes available for you in the bedroom you both share. You may get changed into them after the examination.”
Harry on the other hand said nothing. Severus waited patiently perhaps Harry was trying to compose which question he wanted to ask in his head? But minutes passed and nothing was said. Severus frowned slightly, there was a chance that Harry didn’t understand, so Severus try to clarify it for him.
Draco had been too confused to pick up the diary or do anything but stare out of the window of his room and try to make up his mind on what to do about Harry on whether he was in earnest or whether giving Draco what he wanted was in some way a desperate last attempt to keep his promise to Draco’s mother. Draco didn’t have an answer to these questions. The diary felt tempting and heavy in his hands, but it didn’t feel right to read in it with Draco’s own mind so clouded in worry.
That’s not what he wants, so he takes a step towards Draco, reaching out for him, but not quite daring to touch. Malfoy’s hand against his chest stops him.
Draco pulled Harry down with him to lie on the soft grass beneath the roses. The wind showered them with rose petals, but neither of them noticed.
After the war everything has changed, everything he’d taken for granted has become slippery and then like a puff of smoke evaporated into nothingness. All that Draco has taken to make up his life, himself, his convictions and how the world worked has been torn asunder, made to be worthless and wrong. He has always known that the way he behaved didn’t make him friends it only made him minions and people who were afraid of him.
Malfoy nodded but then, as if to make a point he stole a quick kiss from Harry, before letting himself be led up the stairs, helping with every step.
“Oh shit, oh shit! Please Draco, just… hah…!” He sharply exhaled as Draco reached for his prick squeezing and pulling to hurry his climax along. Draco could feel Harry’s stomach muscles tighten as he came, screaming his orgasm into the curve of Draco’s neck, almost sobbing in relief. He quivered and shook as his release coated Draco’s hands and his own stomach.
“I thought you wanted me to do the laundry this week Harry. What the fuck did I do wrong this time?”
“Yes, that. And you didn’t for a moment think that might be a bad idea?” Draco shook his head disbelievingly, already trying to derail Potter’s finger that were trailing up his trouser leg. Again.
Instead of jumping at the opportunity to fight or mock, Harry looked around himself and grabbed his favourite pair of slippers from where they stood by the front door and then chucked them up the stairs, missing Malfoy by mere inches. He went back to the kitchen, annoyed with Malfoy despite himself. The floor in his home was not sticky, thank you very much, perhaps it was a bit dusty but nothing at all like what Malfoy had implied.
In the late afternoon Harry had discovered what could only be the master bedroom. The heavy chest in the corner creaked ominously when Harry opened it. It was at the foot of a large four-poster bed that seemed a bit out of place in a lighthouse, the thing even had drapes and Harry was reminded of his bed at Hogwarts. Like with many other wizarding buildings while the ground floor of the lighthouse was the actual size it should have been, the rest of the lighthouse was much larger on the inside than the outside. Despite having lived in the wizarding world for most of his life, Harry still hadn’t grown numb to its wonders.
The fear of anti-Death Eater retributions drove him up the stairs at a dead run, he panted as he took down the wards and unlocked the door to his flat. He rushed in and closed the door behind him, leaning against the cold smooth wood, he tried to get his frantic breathing under control.
“I don’t want to be your friend Harry,” Draco heard himself say. At this, Harry tried to get up and leave but Draco would have none of it. Using more force than strictly necessary, he kept Harry pinned to his side. “You didn’t let me finish, now listen! I don’t want to be your friend; I want to be something more. Friendship never really worked for us, did it?”
He had sat at his desk for over an hour now, starting and discarding letters to Draco that included anything from outright accusations of stalking to desperate pleas for him to forgive Harry and come back to him so they could make love.
Later that night, Draco lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling and watching the shadows of the trees dance across it like twisted morris dancers. Not announcing the spring, but a darker time and suddenly Draco was afraid. Without conscious thought he grabbed the shell and pressed it to his heart, like a frightened child might a beloved toy. Something compelled him to move the shell up to his ear and hold it against it. He fell asleep like that, embraced by a feeling of love and belonging, the shell still at his ear.
“Harry… please!” Another moan escaped Draco as the hand on his prick sped up. His hips pushed up into each downward stroke and he couldn’t hold back the gasps and whimpers that fell from his lips. This was what he’d wanted, what he’d needed and coveted for months – this strong confident Harry taking control. Draco knew that he was completely at his mercy and didn’t regret it for a moment.
“Well, fuck!” he forced out, his lungs constricted from the position his struggling had manoeuvred him into. The sound of footsteps could be heard on the steps below. Clanging and clattering upwards, the metal steps ringing under the heavy boots, which took his mother out of the equation. The Aurors must be coming to check out where the noise had come from.
Malfoy’s hands are trembling with what can only be barely concealed anger. If Harry didn’t know that Malfoy’s wand both old and new had been taken into custody after the battle of Hogwarts and both of them weren’t likely to be released any time soon, he might have worried about consequences. As it is, Harry never does know when to stop.
Draco picked up one of the crushed paper balls and unfolded it carefully. It was more of the same, they probably all were, about how it was all Harry’s fault and how he loved Draco and about how he needed him back.
“Uhm…was that today?” Draco was mortified. This was the second time he had simply forgotten Harry. What must he think of Draco.
“Then why are you wearing this…?” She seemed to be searching for an appropriate word but was at a loss for words in the face of “it”.
Draco’s fist punched the air in victory and he only felt slightly weird for doing it while nobody could see him do it. That was what those notes were, coordinates. He should have made the connection sooner, especially since Pyxis had been studying to become a navigator. How fitting for a cartographer to send coordinates that only a navigator would understand. Draco definitely approved of their methods.
He slid out of bed, his feet involuntarily shrinking back from the cold floor until Draco realised that someone had cast a heating charm on the cold dark wood not too long ago. Feeling grateful to Harry for taking such care, he tottered into the bathroom and splashed his face with cold water to chase the weariness away.
Ten minutes later, after he’d cleaned himself up in the Gents as best as he could without magic and wrapped his hand with a makeshift bandage, he went to work in the Auror recruits’ locker room. It was just his luck that the recruits had been out training for a field assignment, apparently spending the entire day running up and down a muddy road. It reeked of petty revenge, but by this stage Draco was used to it and began the job in a state of numb despair.
“It’s the second door on the right.” Potter said absentmindedly as he wheeled his chair to one of the counters, conjuring up the images he’d taken earlier and making notes in Draco’s file. The moment Potter’s back was turned, Draco fled the room.
The invisibility cloak slipped to the floor shortly followed by Harry who hit it with a thud and finally woke up.
“No, you utter berk… uh, Mr. Potter.” This was ridiculous. Draco cleared his throat and tried again. “Why did you speak for me?”
Understanding comes like a punch to the gut and suddenly Draco remembers it all, the things his subconscious has been trying to tell him for what must have been months now. The drink that tasted off, Harry showing up and suddenly seeming like the most attractive human being in the universe, as if he had been a walking love potion. Draco blushes as he remembers throwing himself at Harry and he also remembers the men chasing them. Why hadn’t Harry ever told him?
Malfoy is leaning against the window frame, the light of the sun casting his face into shadow and making it hard for Harry to read his expression.
Harry’s hand gently brushed over the marked skin, almost making Draco jump as he hadn’t expected Harry to be quite so bold. Shivering at the intensity of the other man’s stare as he caressed the Dark Mark, Draco still couldn’t have torn his gaze away even if he’d wanted to.
He didn’t know how long it would be until rescue came or if anyone even knew he was missing. The last thing he remembered was waking up on his sofa with Draco draped across him in the warm afternoon light, talking excitedly about something. The memory was fuzzy and when Harry tried to picture it more clearly, it slowly began to drain away, leaving him with an intense sense of loss. Grief overwhelmed him and he couldn’t hold back the sobs when he realised he was utterly alone.
His eyes slowly drifted shut as the exhaustion of the day’s ordeal caught up with him. He’d rest for just a short while and then go back to the patio. He had to sneak back into the house before anyone noticed. Draco couldn’t remember why that was important as sleep eventually claimed him.
Harry felt chastised when Holly accompanied him to the border of the Malfoy estate, where he could Apparate. He had run out of ideas and he couldn’t even ask his friends to help him. In other words, Harry was utterly screwed.
Draco didn’t know what Harry meant at first, but then two fingers were held in front of his lips and he sucked them in laving them with his tongue, imagining they were Harry’s cock. He swirled his tongue around them, insinuating it between them and then lapped at them again open mouthed, before they were withdrawn with a growl.
Harry swallowed and looked away, his body speaking clearly of his wish to be anywhere but here. That more than anything convinced Draco to take the one step forward that brought him close enough to touch. He reached up embracing Harry’s neck with his hand. Draco’s thumb traced gentle lines across Harry’s cheek while he spoke.
Draco gasped out loud as it all came back to him. The dark presence pursuing him and a pale light calling him forwards, he recalled almost drowning. And then he recalled the memories of a night he had forgotten.
Her reply was inaudible, but soon after Draco could hear the sound of what he assumed were whispered endearments followed by what he knew to be the sound of kisses. His heart in shreds and unable to bear it any longer, he fled to his room.
“Ron, what the fuck is going on? Why isn’t Malfoy in my office indexing my case files, like I wanted?”
In contrast to Harry, Draco definitely felt something. His focus was narrowed to the inches of his forearm that Harry was caressing, lighting his nerve ends on fire. The touch of Harry’s fingers on his skin had temporarily destroyed his ability to speak. All he could do was sit there and let it happen.
He sits up again, trying to push whoever is still hovering over him away. The person he can’t see in the darkness of the room tries to calm him but only makes it worse. Harry fights against them and manages to get away. He ends up pressed against a wall, frantically taking in his surroundings. It’s too dark to see anything but shapes all of them vague and threatening.
“What? Kneazle got your tongue?” he asked again, looking slightly disappointed. “Was so hoping you’d buy me a drink, the last guy to buy me one was really very very ugly, but what’s a girl to do.”
Resigned to his fate, he walked towards the kitchen, feeling like a convict walking towards the gallows.
The corridor he runs along is bright and clean. The walls are creamy white tinged slightly pink and luminescent with some undefinable light. Windows are interspersed at even intervals and as he runs past Draco can make out the vast stretch of the square, the field and the avenue beyond. Everything here seems to vibrate with a quiet hum. Draco doesn’t know what it is or where it comes from, but it makes him tired and his steps become heavier.
“Malfoy, I already said I was sorry. This is embarrassing enough as it is, since you’re clearly averse to my advances, forced or otherwise.”
Harry talked for what felt like hours. He talked about the time when Ginny lost the baby and of his guilt, he talked of what happened between him and Draco and the aftermath and how he still couldn’t let go. He talked about the darkness inside of him and of the two people inhabiting his body who both wanted completely different things out of love and how much it hurt to be so divided down to his very core.
It was too late now, with Pansy standing before him, reaching for his forearm and tearing him away from Harry.
“Harry…” he whispered. Looking up into his eyes, Draco could see the same need mirrored there. He didn’t resist when Harry spun him around and pressed himself against the length of his back, his arousal obvious even through the two layers of clothes.
On and on it went until they had to come up for air again. Harry slowly detached his hands from Draco’s face and wound them around his waist instead. When Draco opened his eyes, he could barely make out the man standing in the rain in front of him. How could it be foggy during a down pour of this magnitude he wondered, until he felt Harry shake with laughter.
