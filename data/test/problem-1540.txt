Before casting the spell, Draco took one last moment to try and remember Harry like this. Hair tousled in a way that only could have looked artful to Draco, eyes shining with warmth and something like affection.
“Once we have the locket, we’ll need the diary,” said Harry, turning to the blond. “Malfoy reckons it’s in his family’s possession like the cup was, so it’s either at the Manor or the second property, Wisteria Hall, where we believe Voldemort to be hiding out. Once Cedric is back from the castle, he and Malfoy will head to the Manor first as the less heavily guarded location,”
By the time they got through with telling her everything they had been up to over the past few weeks, McGonagall was looking very much like the younger version of herself that had marched James and his friends into this very office.
Instead of going back to sleep and risking another horrible dream early that morning, he’d curled up on his window seat and watched the dark sky outside. Somewhere in the castle, someone else must have also been awake because when he opened the little door where food appeared, there was a piping hot mug of cocoa waiting for him. And if he squinted hard enough out his window over the far field, he could see black shapes like large swooping bats floating and diving around a grassy pitch. He’d smiled wearily and wondered at how long he would still find all of this magic stuff completely novel.
“Ah yes. I never feel quite so at home as when I am in this very chair,” said Voldemort, His face crinkling unnaturally into a smiling shape. “How is my favourite pupil?”
“You thought it would be that easy did you?” he taunted, his thin lips turning up into a wicked smile. “This is only the beginning.”
“Moreover, I can’t recall her ever having a gift with the Sight before the incident this year,” said Voldemort, shifting his gaze from Lucius to Draco. “Can you Yaxley?”
“Yes, Father,” said Draco, subduing himself immediately. Damn, he had been so close. “If I am eager, it is only because I am anxious to understand the plans the brethren have for me. With Zabini called up to Wisteria Hall, I’d just assumed he was taking steps past me in the ranks.”
Harry’s eyes darted to Luna to see if she was upset with all this talk about time magic, but she seemed perfectly content, smiling warmly at the others as she placed Ivy back in her terrarium.
Finally he pulled back and Draco found himself drenched in sweat and clinging to the armchair, surrounded by Death Eaters. Voldemort stood over him, wand pointed at his heart.
“I don’t doubt it, my boy, I don’t doubt it,” said Ollivander. His eyes refocused on the two in front of him, his brow now creased.
“It’s not about me anymore. Not on balance with everything the world stands to lose if we fail at this,” said Harry, staring pointedly into the faces of each of them. “I’ll take you as far as I can, but if something happens to me, you’ll at least have the Horcruxes. You can finish the mission.”
“Thank you, Harry!” said Luna, twirling, her golden hair fanning out around her. “Mine are from Madame Malkin’s, but I did put my very own rain-proofing charm on them. I can do yours if you like, Draco.”
“I have half a mind to.” Draco’s anger was turning to frustration. “I’m two weeks into learning about Potter’s pathetic life and I’m no closer to understanding his true power, or what happened, or whether the Dark Lord would rather see him delivered whole or incinerated.”
“Of course,” said Harry, digging into this share of the feast. He had a long night ahead of him, and he might not have a chance to stop for food again for a while.
“What is it?” asked Harry, sleepily. He was lying with his arms folded under his chin, tilting his head to get a better look at Draco next to him.
“Shrub has taken the liberty, as the draught has been seeming to help sir of late after long nights at the Pensieve,” said the elf uncertainly.
“It is true, Minerva,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “I have long known that this is a quest Harry would be destined for.”
Draco’s eyes flickered to Harry’s and then quickly into the fire as he took a deep drink of Butterbeer. Harry noticed his hand was shaking. “In what way?”
Draco paused for a minute and let the words sink in. Pansy’s stare faded from reprimanding to comforting. “I’m worried you’re about to make a choice you’ll regret.”
“In that case, I don’t expect you would mind sharing your thoughts,” said Voldemort, the space where his eyebrows would be raising into an attempt at an endearing expression. “For my peace of mind.”
Harry blinked his eyes. He wasn’t wearing his glasses. The smell of evergreen trees and damp earth filled his nose.
“So you and I were best friends with Ron Weasley,” said Hermione, twirling a lock of hair and looking uncharacteristically flustered. “And we’d separated from the others to go Horcrux hunting on our own because we were the only ones who believed Voldemort could be defeated. Sounds oddly familiar.”
“I don’t think he would have gone far, he’s probably just cooling off,” said Draco, summoning his Muggle jacket as well. “I can do a sweep of the neighbourhood and Kreacher can watch for him here—”
“Don’t be jealous.” Draco wound an arm around her waist and drew her close. “Quidditch isn’t the only thing that can keep me up after hours.”
Draco felt a pain in his chest. The memory of Lily laying her life down for her son came roaring back to his mind as he was reminded of what true love looked like. What you’d be willing to sacrifice for the other person. He knew he could never give that to Pansy.
Harry wheeled around brandishing the flaming sword, coming face to face with a man with an outstretched wand who was the spitting image of Draco. He hesitated for a moment as the Dark Lord laughed viciously, but Lucius did not move his wand. Instead he reached into the pocket of his robes and withdrew a tattered leather bound book, throwing it at Harry’s feet.
“I trust you’ll support my story then, once I am able to reveal it to the Dark Lord, that we’d agreed to wait this out. And it will be me who reveals it in the end – after all, I’m the one teaching him. How does that sound?”
Now, in the Great Hall for breakfast before heading to Hogsmeade to depart, the group was back to pretending they hardly knew each other.
He cast his eyes at Neville, who had puffed up with resolve, Luna leaned her head lightly on his shoulder. Several others in the crowd looked on knowingly.
“What if the Dark Lord hasn’t actually been defeated?” she asked, leaning closer to Dumbledore and finally voicing her real fear. “You said it yourself, you’re not certain he is truly gone. Lily’s sister’s house is the first place he’ll come looking for the boy, blood magic or not. He’ll be defenceless out here with no one but Muggles around him.”
“You’re staying close to Harry because you know the world will find out about him, and when they do, he’ll be famous. The only person in the world to survive a Killing Curse and at the hands of You-Know-Who to boot. You think you can ride his coattails straight to the top,” said Hermione, crossing her arms and smiling like the know-it-all she was.
Draco picked the black king off of the board and rolled it in his hands. The stone piece was icy cold.
“I can’t even look at you right now,” he said as he slammed open the door, and Draco could hear his feet receding down the stairs.
“Don’t thank me yet,” said Hermione, also pointing her wand at him. “Any funny business and you won’t get another chance.”
Snape was sputtering, blinking but unseeing. There were empty phials of invigoration draught scattered around the desk and the floor, clearly the house-elf had already tried this. He grabbed two fistfuls of Snape’s robes and shook him into a seating position.
“Don’t be coy with me, Snape,” barked Draco, losing his patience. “Potter has some connection to the Dark Lord. I know you know something about it.”
“Please. You won’t have a clue what you’re looking for – You’ve had a wizard chess set for years and never known,” said Draco, putting his empty coffee cup down decisively. “I’ll go with you.”
“Just be careful.” Hermione turned to rummage in her seemingly bottomless bag and withdrew a blue book with an embossed eye on the cover, titled
“Yes, Mr Malfoy comes from an esteemed wizarding family, much like yourself,” cut in Professor McGonagall with a forced cheerfulness. “I imagine if you had gone to school here you two would have been the best of friends all along.”
She certainly did not. He locked eyes with his mother as she gave him a meaningful stare – she was silently protecting him. Willing him not to ask questions that might expose either of them when the Dark Lord inevitably raided their thoughts.
Not bad, thought Draco. If he navigated back to the small room, this would be a decent start at memory traversing. Then suddenly a giant shape blocked out the sun. Harry turned slowly, a deep sense of foreboding as a lumbering moustached man came towards him.
“If you’ve tried to evade your attacker and you’re forced into a confrontation, a quick Disarming spell might be your best chance to avoid an attack,” said Cedric, as he paced in front of the slowly growing number of onlookers to his weekly defence class. “Malfoy, would you care to demonstrate?”
What’s more, Cedric had started reporting alarming advances in the Ministry’s inquiry against Dumbledore. The Headmaster’s cause of death was ruled as accidental, with no investigation of homicide. Luckily, the memories that Dawlish and Mercer had attempted to extract yielded nothing except Dumbledore’s favourite recipe for banana bread and a rude limerick, but that didn’t deter the department from throwing everything they had at the case.
He looked back to change the subject but was surprised to find Potter already staring at him, with a look of something like admiration. Unbidden, Draco felt colour start to rise in his face.
As a child, Draco had been shocked his father didn’t turn the repulsive man away point blank, but the man held a secret; a twisted, strange second face on the back of his head. Whatever the face had said, it more than convinced his father, and the stranger had been invited to stay. From that moment, Quirrell only grew weaker, while Lord Voldemort grew stronger.
He felt a pressing sensation at the corner of his thought and realised it was Malfoy. His eyes flashed to the blond who held his gaze – he was trying to use Legilimency to connect with him.
“I was coming to give you a revised timetable to meet with you-know-who,” said Hermione, pulling a scroll of parchment out of her bag. “But if my telling you this will interrupt your flirting, feel free to let McGonagall know.”
“Poor thing fancies me,” said Draco. “She’s got a ploy to spend time with me where she’s offered to tutor me in any subject I’m behind. I reckon I’ll nick her best notes for us, eh?”
There were quite a few memories of Voldemort himself, though none as bad as the one of Alice Longbottom. Most were of Draco as a young boy, being tutored in the Dark Arts by a skilled hand. Though as he grew older, he became more and more privy to the tasks that the Death Eaters were being made to run on Voldemort’s behalf, and the swarms of witches and wizards who were flocking to the cause and visiting the Manor to pay their respects.
“Not until we try that again,” said Harry, pulling the cloak back in place and heading into the hallway.
They had tried tracking down objects of value from the Gaunt lineage as well, but that line of searching dried up once it was discovered that the last members of that family died in destitute squalor. The ring, wherever Al had found it, had certainly been a lucky break.
Before he knew it, he was showing Harry the time he tried to set Luna up with the Slytherin Quidditch team. Harry was asleep on the couch, under the power of the diadem, as Draco and Luna chatted about the mimbletonia and Neville Longbottom and Luna’s philosophy on love.
As the other men left the room, Harry found himself face to face with Voldemort. His damaged skin looked healed, but there was little else Harry could see that humanised him. His face had a pallid, waxy complexion, and he gazed at his own reflection with an unsettling expression of mirth.
“Delightful,” said Dumbledore, his eyes crinkling into a sad smile. “In my final days I had worried whether everything would go according to plan. But now, I can rest knowing you found your way to Hogwarts and into the company of fine friends.”
“Leave me alone. For your own good,” he said, pushing down any emotion so his voice rang ice cold in the empty hallway. “We’re through.”
Harry wanted to be grateful for Hermione’s exhaustive diligence, but he found he was just as disgusted with Hermione as with Draco at this point.
“Look, this isn’t the moon of Endor, Harry,” said Cedric, sitting forward to lean on his knees, and looking very much like the adult of the group. “It’s not like we’ll be able to roll a log and defeat the empire.”
He was just drawing a matrix of wand movement and incantation, to see if rearranging the two would have any effect on the spell, when there was a knock at the door. It was too late for any lessons, Hermione had already come by after dinner to drop off a new Charms textbook,
“We had identified Flamen & Sons as a failing brand in the magical medical remedies sector, and were planning for a buyout when Lucius proposed an M&A opportunity. He was old friends with DuPont and knew he had been looking to enter the European market. He made the connection and acted as a facilitator of the deal, as well as putting a portion of his own fund on the table.”
Harry stared at the board. Finally moving his king-side bishop out to put pressure on the white king.
“Daddy, we just heard from Draco’s friend Harry, who’s free to come play with us today,” said Angelica brightly.
“I see,” said Draco, wondering how in the hell Potter could still be alive if those were the two sent after him and feeling an annoying wave of relief. He could barely cast a solid Shield Charm, for Merlin’s sake. “And what led our old friends to make such an egregious error?”
“Even so,” said Hermione, her eyes darting to Harry’s scar. “We don’t know how that happened. You-Know-Who’s true weaknesses were never revealed, and the only wizard he ever really feared is gone.”
He had a moment to think, feeling around in his brain for any unwanted presence, but he had severed the connection at least. Then, remembering Luna, he sat bolt upright – he’d never forgive himself if he’d hurt her in one of his unpredictable blasts. But she was crouched a few metres away, her pale brows knit together.
“Darling, it’s the right bet to make. There will be no stopping him when he has returned to power, he is not a man that makes the same mistakes twice. I am
Harry stumbled back from the memory as the battery fell to the floor with a thunk. He was on his feet, pacing towards the door, his hands laced through his hair.
“Right,” he said. He was deluding himself if he thought for a second Draco wanted to spend time with him at three o’clock in the bloody morning.
“Really? A great Legilimens like you didn’t know the motivation behind the act that would lead to his master’s demise?” asked Draco, an air of challenge to his voice.
If he could just end this game, he could get to the Room of Requirement and see what was going on. If Potter had somehow made it back alive, then what could have caused the
“I knew I should have gotten into duelling,” moaned Neville from the front, causing a ripple of tense laughter to waft through the group.
If anything, Harry was relieved that their prior conversation didn’t change the way Hermione acted towards him, but he’d had about enough lectures on Fudge’s incompetence as Minister to last a lifetime.
“We don’t know that for sure,” said Harry. “We should start with things we know to be true. I think I saw something about his rise to power in my copy of
“So I suppose you wouldn’t mind Draco, one more time before you go, just to humour me,” said Voldemort, fixing him with his red eyes.
“That’s right,” said Greenacre, nodding slowly with a strange glint in his eye. “They Collective acted as co-signatories on the deal.”
“No chance,” said Draco. Cedric’s head snapped in his direction. “Putting him back out into the Muggle world will make him a prime target. If there’s any credence to the suspicious activity going on, we should keep him protected.”
Draco cleared his throat. Harry watched his throat move with the motion, gaze jumping to his mouth as he began to speak. “I usually wouldn’t intrude, certainly not at this hour…” His eyes darted past Harry, as if intent on peering into his rooms.
“No, that’s all been brilliant,” said Harry, furrowing his eyebrows slightly at Draco’s dressing down of Granger. “But I think my aunt and uncle might be getting worried. Perhaps I should get in touch. Maybe send them an owl?”
Draco frowned to himself. That was the one piece he wished more than anything he could confide in Pansy — that he was sure he’d be seeing Harry again. But as he played the conversation over in his head in the days that followed that fateful night, he became more steadfast in his commitment to keep Potter’s position a secret. After all, it wasn’t just Potter that would be hurt if he was found out.
“I could never think it, my love,” said Narcissa, running a hand down his cheek. “I have long known the mistake we made in isolating our needs and ignoring those of the many. But please don’t tell me what you plan to do… he is often in my thoughts.”
“It’s fine, Draco, really!” said Pansy, putting her hands on his shoulders and squaring up to him. “I won’t tell anyone. I know what you’re afraid of – the Dark Lord will want you in a partnership eventually that can produce pure-blood offspring, so you’re right to keep it hidden for now, anyway.”
“She thought it was Ravenclaw’s diadem,” said Harry, trying to give any information that might be helpful in a diagnosis. “She put it on for—”
which crinkled under the clear plastic. He paged through the first pages, landing on a vibrant illustration of a wooded scene, with a set of small house-elf type characters walking down the path together.
“Yes, back to the hard skills,” said Draco as the other two rose. “Very important to concentrate on – Sweet Merlin, what are you wearing?”
“All students are meant to be gathering in the Great Hall,” said the moustached man, taking a few steps to make sure the rest of the stairwell was empty. “There’s an active Ministry investigation going on in these halls.”
Draco hesitated. Less at the request of the painting and more so at a loss of where to go. The common room was out, as was the Great Hall. He couldn’t bear to see any of his friends in his present state. Snape would probably turn him away cold. He could always go to the astronomy tower and avoid everyone, but with his luck there’d be a special meeting of the star gazing club already there.
, the wandmaker didn’t seem to notice. As wand after wand failed to cast an adequate lighting charm, he seemed much more interested in the response time or the magnitude of the output than to worry that the wands were not doing at all what Harry was willing them to.
“While I think it’s highly unlikely that anyone else will follow the same path as Miss Lovegood,” continued McGonagall. “I think a recalibration of the room’s rules will do the trick. And we’ll of course bring Miss Lovegood into the Fidelius for good measure.”
For a moment, Harry stopped resisting. He could no longer deny that this person, whoever he was, was real. And if that were the case, then the deaths he had seen, those too had happened. A creeping fear settled itself in his mind.
Hermione hesitated, her straightforward gaze making Draco’s stomach turn. “It’s funny. I always thought you were just another spoiled pure-blood. But Harry seems to think there’s something more to you than that.”
He had refused to admit the possibility to himself for so long that he had actually believed she was still out there, waiting to be saved. But Cedric was right. There was little reason to believe she had made it off the train platform after the Dementor attack and even less reason for the followers of Voldemort to keep her alive.
“What, like it’s that easy now?” said Harry, with a laugh. “You spend your entire life keeping secrets and then you’re an open book all of a sudden.”
The sneaky bugger. It seemed Draco wasn’t the only one who couldn’t be trusted around here. McGonagall might tell Potter to his face he was a guest in the castle, but there was no way he’d be getting out of a guardian ward without help.
“Please, that’s about as subtle as a punch in the face,” said Angelica with an eye roll, collecting the card and resuming her shuffling. “He wanted to see me married, settled. I wanted control. So I started looking for eligible partners in the states. There are a lot of degenerates with illustrious family names out there, let me tell you. But my criteria were simple. I wanted someone who had their own interests, so I could keep to mine.”
Harry pulled out the small snake, cradling her gently. Charlotte leaned her head in till they were almost touching as they looked at the little green creature, who had narrowly escaped death.
“It doesn’t hurt to try,” said Luna, waiting till Harry was out of the room before closing the door with a crisp click and turning on her heel to walk down the corridor.
“I can’t do nothing!” he snapped. “For weeks, they’ve locked me up here, teaching me a few magic tricks, on the pretence of keeping me safe. Yet they never bothered to tell me—”
No one on Privet Drive seemed to notice her anxious pacing or dour expression. She was, after all, a cat.
“Or whatever you and Ginny are calling yourselves these days,” said Hermione. “Honestly. The girl is still holding out a flame for you though I’m sure Dean is breathing down her neck back at Hogwarts.”
“If you don’t mind,” repeated the woman in a sing-song voice as she flicked a few slices of toast onto a nearby pan and a set of dishes zoomed by Draco’s face towards the table. “Where are we then, Buckingham Palace?”
Draco massaged his temple and wondered why in Merlin’s name had he been saddled with this twit for the last half hour. He looked at Gemma incredulously, but she seemed not to notice and carried on with her story, as enthralled with the sound of her own voice as Gilderoy Lockhart on his autobiographical book tour. Draco took a big drink from his glass and scanned the crowd for the rest of his group.
“Are you telling Draco the Augusta story?” said a deep, jovial voice from behind them. “One of those suckers nearly took my foot off!”
Charlotte’s braid had been pulled loose, and her hair was fanned out around her shoulders. Harry could feel the pulsing of a black eye forming behind a cracked lens in his glasses, but he didn’t care. He and Charlotte had just done the unthinkable; they’d taken Dudley’s gang five to two and lived to tell the tale.
“Always great to have your support, father.” Draco gripped his gloved hands. “But I get the sense there’s something more you want to talk about. The
But that was clearly not the right thing to say. Before he knew it, a force like a push to the chest was knocking him back. Harry’s expression was dark.
He turned down the Transfiguration corridor, coming quickly up on McGonagall’s door, when the memory of an evil, high-pitched voice sounded in his mind. There was, of course, one other option. He could forget Potter and his stupid rebellion and save his mother instead. The only way to release himself from the Fidelius was to kill the Secret Keeper and become one.
He knew he’d have to play into the bit sooner or later. The others would have surely found him missing this morning if Luna hadn’t gone and tattled last night.
The guilt had been eating away at him for longer than he had even acknowledged to himself and he needed to be redeemed, even if he could never be forgiven. All this before he could say what he really felt towards Harry.
Harry frankly hadn’t the faintest idea what had caused the wand to respond on its own, but it didn’t matter. In this one action his suspicions were confirmed – Voldemort was at the end of his regenerative spell. If he was at his most weakened state, they might truly stand a chance of defeating him.
The pretty redhead had flung herself into Potter’s arms the first chance she got. Potter for his part seemed genuinely surprised by the gesture, and Draco could almost feel present day Potter squirming as Draco watched the memory, even trying to Occlude weakly. But Draco forced the scene to play out, feeling an inexplicable level of loathing towards the girl, and utterly exasperated with Potter’s naïveté.
“She’s always suspected it,” said Cedric, gathering the file together and not making eye contact with Harry. “It was one of Dumbledore’s last messages that Harry and You-Know-Who shared a mental connection. Hence the Occlumency.”
But he was still holding onto the door handle. Draco had kissed him back – that had to mean something.
“Draco, what’s wrong?” asked Pansy, hastening to keep up with him as he made his way through the entranceway and down the corridor to the Slytherin common room. “You hardly said two words on the train and I haven’t seen you eat a thing all day.”
Harry laughed as he twisted the ends of two wires together. “Leave it to you to find a way to weaponize Luna’s personality.”
“I don’t know,” said Harry, his eyebrows knitting together. Draco didn’t have to use Legilimency to know that Harry must be thinking of the conversation they’d had earlier in Sirius’s very room.
“I haven’t heard any different,” said Draco, keeping his eyes on the paper, where they fell on the weekend’s Quidditch scores. Potter would love this; the underdog Kestrels trampled the Cannons at home in Devon. Diggory would be having kittens.
“Oh, I thought this was just pretence,” said Luna. “We really ought to be going if you want to leave while everyone is still at the feast.”
“Yes, there’s a whole team of us,” said Harry, turning to smile at Draco as well, though he did not return the gesture. His features were still drawn in a tight line, as they had been since he appeared in the Room of Requirement earlier that afternoon. “Hermione has been organising everything, she’s the one who figured out who Voldemort was. And Cedric, he’s an Auror now, he’s been keeping tabs on the Ministry. That was it at the start, but then Luna found us and now we’re all on the case.”
Draco’s smugness at how easy it was to get Harry onside was overridden with incredulity in an instant. “What’s Quidditch?” he repeated. “Only the greatest sport ever invented.”
Draco sighed in annoyance and glanced out to the pitch before striding around to take a seat in the armchair across from Luna. Harry followed, sitting in the chair opposite as they usually did for their Occlumency sessions.
“Alright,” he said finally. “We haven’t got much time left to figure this out. I’m willing to try whatever you think will work.”
His father blinked at him, clearly expecting some sort of response, so Draco quickly collected his features. “Oh? I’d imagine that made our Lord very happy indeed.”
When Draco didn’t respond, Hermione shot a spell across the room that made the book stand on end. “I’m not sure there’ll be much about Harry’s past in
“I’m doing a bit of research on your bursts of magic,” she explained. “There are some consistencies with accidental magic, which occurs sporadically in magical children when they become stressed or angry.”
“If she did, do you think you would have come?” asked Harry, attempting to sound lighthearted but feeling strangely apprehensive about the answer.
As he showed Harry the memory, he was horrified by the callousness with which he regarded this woman. But in the memory itself, Draco let his ambition supersede his compassion. He was called on first to perform the Cruciatus Curse, and he intended to set an example.
Besides which he had a Quidditch team to run, Head Boy duties to take care of, and a fake girlfriend to keep entertained. And, most importantly, when would he find time to figure out how to break this damn Fidelius? So far he hadn’t broken through anything meaningful to Pansy or to his mother, but he was confident there were weaknesses in the charm worth exploiting.
“If I hadn’t met you, my path would never have been righted. I certainly never would have abandoned my quest for power and I probably never would have questioned it, either. Not until it was far too late anyway,” said Draco, sickened by the thought. “And most likely there would have been a piece of me that I would have always kept hidden.”
“Legends,” said Harry with a smile around at the group. “Maybe If we can get our hands on old Hogwarts records, I can start looking for students who—”
She drew her paws together and waited for him to approach, debating whether to reveal herself or wait and see if he was about to do what she feared. Her tail twitched.
Snippets of memory started whipping by; a park, a wrought-iron table, the shape of a man in a brown tweed suit. Draco attempted to press in on one or two of them, to get a better look at the man’s face, but Harry resisted with surprising force, so Draco kept his pace up, diving back in time. The park flashed through winter, summer, streaking by before Harry could get a foothold and push him away.
“Oh my goodness, you are hilarious,” she said, grabbing a hair tie off her wrist and gathering her hair into a ponytail. “I mean, talk about dedication.”
“Well, that’s just it, it could have been a tiny thing that made the difference. You might have just gotten up an hour later one day and it put you on a completely different path for life.”
“I suppose,” said Hermione, considering. “He can’t do too much harm with the spells he’s already learned.”
“Funny enough, that’s news to me,” said Harry, balancing a large pot shard in place with one hand and attempting to mend it with the other.
“I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, eyeing it suspiciously. “I doubt the other objects are rings or Dumbledore could have just said so in the letter. This thing likely has inherent magical properties,
“Yeah, but that’s because he never used to party before. Being an Auror is such a drag,” she said, reaching into the cleavage of her dress and pulling out a small green vial that she waved playfully in front of his face. “You want some?”
“No, you’re right. We’ve got work to do,” he said, turning back towards the desk and spilling out the day’s phials of memories in front of the portrait of the man who made them.
Draco sat anyway, on the side of black. The men at the other tables chatted sporadically, and the tree branches creaked overhead with the light winter breeze.
“All the more reason to celebrate!” said Blaise, grabbing the champagne bottle from the table and topping up everyone’s glass again.
“Is it?” he spat. Cedric wheeled around to face him, a look of bewilderment on his face. “Or are you just the reason Charlotte’s being held captive by a madman?”
“Yes, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, his head rising in the direction of the half giant. “I’ll have to take care of Sirius separately, of course, but the three of us must rewrite history tonight. We must tell the world that Harry Potter did not survive.”
“It’s all rubbish, Harry, don’t think twice about it. Wizards have no desire to really learn what Muggles are like,” said Hermione, waving her hand at the offending book and focusing her attention on Harry’s programming text.
She squealed with glee, her girlish demeanour returning. “Yay! I’m so excited. I love getting what I want.” she held the deck out to him again. “Shall I give you another reading? A real one this time — I won’t interfere with the cards, I promise.”
Al had gripped his arm with a damaged and curled up hand, and shoved a cold stone shape into his fist. It was days later when Harry was going through the pockets of his jacket that he’d discovered the spare black king; Al’s parting gift.
First things first, thought Draco, turning to head back to the dormitories for a few Extendable Ears. He’d need to know what the teachers were saying; McGonagall was bound to know something.
Harry knew there was no point in arguing against Kreacher’s loyalty. He nodded and Kreacher dashed into the kitchen to bring food for the others and hear the end of the briefing.
He was reeling. All of the months spent at the castle, the dangers he’d been through, everything was worth it for this moment, this truth about his mother. He had to remind himself to breathe as the disbelief and joy at seeing his mother’s last action to protect him was replaced by a loathing and a strange curiosity about the Dark Lord himself.
He turned the corner into the living room, which had felt so spacious when it was just the four of them. Now, it was packed side to side with a dozen or so students in black Hogwarts robes with more emerging every few minutes through the flames.
“Intruder ward on your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Cedric. “I set it up when I went back for your things. When a magical presence tripped it last night, I called McGonagall straight away. From there it didn’t take long to figure out you were on the run.”
“Not altogether off point, but Potter never suppressed his magic as far as I can tell. He just didn’t know how much he was able to control it,” said Draco, glancing across the page.
As he reached for the calculator, he spotted a new item on the shelf. It was the picture of his parents that McGonagall had given him. Harry hesitated. That had definitely not been there in his memory before. Surely this had to mean something.
Draco’s hands tightened on the wooden arms of the chair. He was well acquainted with this story. In the past seven years since the Dark Lord’s early return, when he was nothing but a misty shroud, he had been whispering conspiracies that the Potter boy had lived. That he could feel the connection, even see through his eyes. But no, everyone knew that was just paranoia.
As he entered the room, several heads immediately turned to look at him and conversation dimmed. Harry, the only one in Muggle clothes in a sea of black robes, was conspicuously out of place.
Harry jumped to his feet and padded over to the door, opening it to find a blonde, but not the one he was expecting.
He gripped the broom handle tightly and kicked off, reliving the memory of the final Quidditch match of the season last year. Slytherin versus Ravenclaw. The teams had been neck and neck going into the final and the tension in the stands was palpable. Draco remembered every feint, every Bludger hit, as vividly as if it had just happened earlier that afternoon. As he sailed through the game, he could feel Harry’s mind reeling and smiled inwardly to himself. Nothing beat flying, and he knew Harry had realised that as well.
By the time he was alone with Angelica a few holes later, Draco was thoroughly paranoid about what she and Harry could be talking about behind his back. He brought it up nonchalantly, or at least he was pretty sure he did.
Snape bartered for Lily’s life, Lily bartered for Harry’s. And Draco had held it in the palm of his hand, about to give it away to the Dark Lord with no more than a second thought.
The house-elf’s weathered cheeks pulled up in a smile as he left the rest of the biscuits on the table and turned to Draco for praise. Draco nodded appreciatively and Kreacher beamed with pride, toddling off to the kitchen to inevitably begin on another snack.
“And here I was thinking there was something noble in you,” she said in a mocking tone. “Last chance. Do you want to tell them or should I?”
While Hermione was under, Cedric turned up after a morning of casework and the others caught him up on the diadem over lunch at the coffee table. Harry even told him what he had witnessed after the Triwizard Tournament, and though it chilled him, it seemed to make him even more confident in the fact that – in this timeline at any rate – they were on the right path.
“Are you kidding?” said Hermione, her fork halfway to her mouth. “You’ve learned all the year one charms and most of the defensive magic. You even picked up second-year mending charms in less than a week.”
“I know,” said Draco. “But I want to help. We have all the information we need, and that’s something. We can end this.”
And he wasn’t the only one that was acting out of character — From the moment the curtain had been pulled away, it was like Gemma had transformed into an entirely different person. She was practically dripping off of Harry’s shoulder as they made their way to the booth, swinging her hips as she walked. She smiled a toothy smile and laughed loudly, shouting greetings across the drone of the music. When she spotted a scantily clad witch in magenta, they simultaneously shrieked and did a sort of funny high heeled run towards each other, air kissing cheeks in greeting.
No fewer than six Death Eaters had their wands trained on her, but Voldemort held his hands out “Stop! Do not harm her,” he commanded, and they stopped in their tracks.
Harry winced reflexively at the title. His upbringing at the Dursleys was something he’d spent his entire life trying to hide, and something he’d done a pretty good job of at that. But Hermione could read him like an open book. The realisation didn’t scare him, as it had done with school guidance counsellors and corrections officers he’d dealt with before, but it surprised him to realise how well his friends had managed to know him in a short amount of time.
“But Professor—” started Draco. Was she really going to stay here alone with this untamed wizard on some kind of rampage of uncontrolled magic?
“You’re back,” said Petunia, in not much more than a whisper. Harry couldn’t tell if it was a question or a statement.
“Did you stop to consider the implications of the world finding out that Potter survived?” asked Snape.
But he didn’t have time to dwell, he had a train to catch. Harry quickly set about shrinking sets of clothes from his wardrobe and packing them into the folds of his backpack. He packed a book on coding that Salerni had gifted him, but otherwise ignored the books and movies scattered about, pulling on a heavier coat and grabbing all his cash savings from years at Video City out from a tin under his bed. Until at last there was one thing he’d come back for, which was more important than anything else; the chess set.
“That’s strange, we haven’t spoken of Andromeda in years,” said Narcissa, slowly. “We were very close as children. But Andromeda chose her path. Your father and I chose another.”
Narcissa guided a small trowel in a circle around the Bowtruckle sprout, and reached her hands into the warm earth to cup the roots and lift it out, placing him in Draco’s outstretched hands. The memory flickered, worn through in parts like an old record, as he dutifully carried the small creature across to the base of the old birch tree nearby and Narcissa helped him plant it, smiling and chattering and not caring a lick that her diamond rings were caked in mud. It was when she looked most beautiful, Draco thought.
Breakfast in the Great Hall was always a loud affair, but Draco was particularly annoyed by the chatter as he had spent longer than planned with Potter the night before, and was forced to stay up late to make a dent in his assignments for the week.
The great beast landed in a barren park, and Potter patted the creature tenderly, feeding it before he turned to go and feeling a sense of gratitude for the animal that Draco could not entirely understand.
“How did you learn healing magic?” asked Harry. “Only I haven’t seen it in the curriculum from Hermione.”
He stared in disbelief at the space where Draco had been standing. Where he’d kissed him, held him, and now – Draco was gone, and there was no way he could follow.
The regeneration draught called for a very specific ingredient; the blood of the enemy. This woman had defied the Dark Lord on multiple occasions and her work had led to the capture of instrumental members of the brethren.
The only light in the room was a flickering candle on the far side, casting shadows on the fading wallpaper of the modest teacher’s quarters.
“I just stopped by to see Beedle,” she turned to reveal the painting of a pastoral countryside where the familiar portrait of a man in a frilly white collar was hard at work scribbling notes on a piece of parchment and muttering to himself. “We’re looking for a source of inspiration.”
“You should see yourself,” said Draco, laying a hand on the side of Harry’s face that wasn’t burned by the power of the sword. “You’re a fright.”
“There’s a roast in the Great Hall on Sundays,” said Luna, who had already Transfigured her robes into a set of overalls and a jumper with bell sleeves, and was dipping her hand into the terrarium to retrieve Ivy.
“Then we’re in agreement?” asked Dumbledore. “The best way we can protect Harry’s future is to cast the charm. He will grow up here, protected by Lily’s sacrifice and by our secret. And he will be remembered in our world as a young boy who gave his life on behalf of free witches and wizards everywhere. His existence will be as unknown outside our pact as our world will be to him.”
“With all the strange energy in the castle these days, I just knew that I was missing something. And wouldn’t you know it, I was walking up and down this hallway here, wondering what was wrong with the castle, when this door appeared!” she waited till Ivy had fully slithered off her hand before offering it out to Harry for a shake. “I’m Luna Lovegood.”
“Prefects too. Everyone is to head straight to the dining area where we can keep an eye on you. Now come with me.”
Harry let out a sigh. “For the most part. It was the only piece of the world that really belonged to me, you know? Sometimes I’d go there just to get away. Other times, when I was forced to stay, it was less pleasant.”
“Yes, how foolish of me,” said Pansy with an eye roll. “I’m sure that’ll be nothing like the nights I had to spend with you to teach all those prying Slytherin boys a lesson. Those long, hard… games of exploding snap.”
“Don’t change the subject, you git!” said Pansy, stifling a laugh. She always got uncharacteristically giggly when an object of affection was brought up in conversation. “I just mean, what if you never get another chance like that with Harry again?”
“It would just be easier if he wasn’t so serious all the time.” He knew Malfoy was right, but there was something about the older boy that got under his skin, like Cedric had sized Harry up as a common criminal before he’d even said two words to the guy.
Draco’s glass fell from his hand and smashed on the ground as Voldemort bored into his thoughts. He could hear his own strangled voice crying out in pain as the Dark Lord searched for his memory of the letter to his mother. He attempted to Occlude, but as soon as the Dark Lord felt it, he shattered Draco’s defences and pressed in farther.
He found the old proprietor hunched over a pocket watch of some kind, which was laid out with an assortment of strange instruments on a workbench. He looked up at Draco through thick microscoping glasses, twisting two large dials until his eyes came into focus and his lips parted in a deferential smile.
Draco could say nothing; let Harry struggle with the wand. If anything, it would make it easier to overtake him in the future. But Snape’s words of advice rang in his ears. If he needed Potter’s help to access the memory, it shouldn’t be too hard to befriend him. Giving him a bit of assistance might go a long way in securing his trust.
“Hear me, Potter,” he spat, staring up at him with malice, his breath wheezing. “You will never be rid of me. I will haunt you till the end of your days. I will become a very part of you and you will forever wonder when I will return to end you.”
If the evidence from that night really was gone, he was struggling to hold on to any reasons not to attempt another reveal of the Fidelius, except for that his own mother’s life might be jeopardised if he couldn’t execute it flawlessly. No, it had to be done with certainty; it had to be one of the surefire ways to break the Fidelius.
“Now Harry,” said McGonagall in a softer tone. “Do remember that you’re here for your protection. I’m afraid any type of communication with the outside world would be too dangerous, as it might reveal where you are.”
She had a point, Harry thought. He and Draco had let their sessions slip since his return to the castle and their focus on Dumbledore’s memories.
The feather on the table fluttered promisingly, and then made a sizzling sound as it curled up from point to tip like the moisture had been sucked out of it.
He turned his head to look at Pansy. She was perched on the arm of the chair with one leg folded under her. A finger lazily twirling a strand of dark hair. She really was quite beautiful, objectively speaking.
“Close!” said Angelica, lighting up and pulling her feet up onto the edge of her chair. “Much closer than I’d thought you’d get. Ugh. In another world, we really would be perfect for each other, wouldn’t we?”
“Yes, I looked at the Fidelius chapter, and yes, I was trying to figure out whether the charm could be broken,” he started. “The only way to break a Fidelius is for the Secret Keeper to die. If someone were to attempt Legilimency, they may see a gap, but they would drive the holder of the secret to insanity and still not be any closer to the truth.”
They stood outside of a large metal door that raised with a loud thunking as Tonks flicked her wand. It was an old parking structure for disused buses, which sat in the dark in neat rows.
Harry tried to listen for the sound of heavy boots on the platform, sending knock-back jinxes and Stinging Hexes, but his magic felt weak. It was his panic, he was sure, and the damn unpredictable wand. He hit one of them sharply enough that it had him cursing in the fog, and a jet of orange shot out and hit Harry in the leg, slicing it open with a deep gash. Harry hissed in pain and took cover in an archway.
“On anything that’s a matter of taste, Potter,” said Malfoy, turning his eyes back to the textbook. “Now hurry up. I’m skipping a free period for this.”
“Let’s see then,” said Harry, snagging it out of Hermione’s hands and cracking it open. “‘A parking metre is a device which looks after motor vehicles to keep them from being stolen’… what?”
A harassed-looking McGonagall sat behind a mountain of parchment on her desk, looking wearily between Hermione, Draco, Cedric, and Luna.
said Harry. Looking down at his hands and sending a surge of magic to them, where it crackled at the end of his fingertips. Not all change was good, though. He wondered whether Al would be proud of the person he’d become.
This was indeed the safe space Harry was looking for. This place, his prize possessions, and this escape to a magical world. Draco tried to focus on the words of the story with Harry, to practise bringing them into focus, but they were hazy. More a feeling than hard and fast memory.
Harry was not surprised to see less of his friends over the following days. Cedric was called in to the department more frequently, Hermione made excuses about her class work picking up, and Draco had all but disappeared.
“We’ve got to start somewhere,” said Harry. “Hermione, surely if anyone could figure out what he means in the letter it’ll be you.”
, but the Ministry says that Hogwarts is the safest place for students so parents are reluctant to take them out of school – that’s absurd!” said Hermione, looking up from the letter. “Surely parents can see through that.”
“Try to suppress your enthusiasm,” said Draco with an exasperated half smile. And as soon as their eyes locked, he was in Harry’s mind.
“You can’t keep me here,” he said, wheeling on McGonagall. This was outrageous. There were crimes for holding people against their will, whatever the reason. Harry tried to think through the options for escape he’d planned for in his first week at the castle, but if they could ward the door, he was sure there would be unseen protections on the rest of the room as well.
“On the contrary, I find strong women incredibly attractive,” he said, smiling down at her. Losing to her was not an issue. Losing to Potter, on the other hand, was not an option.
“Veela!” mouthed Blaise to Pansy, as he pointed to the back of the woman leading them. Pansy elbowed him and tried to suppress a smile, which had Blaise laughing and draping an enormous arm around her shoulder.
Blaise rose to his feet. Taking one last grief-stricken look at his friend, before he turned in a flurry of robes and was gone.
“Of course, my Lord,” said Wormtail, as the snake flicked its tongue threateningly in his direction.
Snape’s warning played on repeat in Draco’s mind over the following days. His waking hours were spent weighing up the merits of various plans of action, none of them satisfactory. And his nights were taken up with strange dreams of Harry, sometimes standing next to him victoriously, other times racked with a look of betrayal.
“No, we can’t, Harry. There’s a proper order to these things,” said Hermione, pulling out her timetable scroll. “The basics of Transfiguration are the building blocks for Vanishment, Conjuring, and Disillusionment – all very important advanced magic. First we do transformation, then switching—”
Draco took a few staggering paces after her, standing shoulder to shoulder to look down one long street beyond which lay a scene of destruction. White stone buildings gave way to rubble halfway down the block, like teeth in a broken jaw, and the taller city buildings in the distance were dark and empty. The city was quiet.
She pointed to a large oval frame farther down the wall, and Draco was surprised to see that it was indeed a picture of his parents. His mother sat on a chaise, wearing a dark silk evening gown and fur stole, and his father stood behind her, one hand reassuringly on her shoulder. They looked much younger than he knew his parents to be and found it slightly unsettling how their eyes followed him quietly as he took a stance in front of their portrait.
Luna turned to look at him, her long hair looking ghostly pale in the wandlight. “Lord Voldemort,” she said, and the forest shook with a strange silence.
“I want to hear Malfoy’s side,” said Harry. “I’m not in the business of sentencing before the hearing.”
A jet of green shot upwards through the smoke, bursting in the sky like a firework. Harry looked up as the shape of a skull with an undulating serpent crawling out of its mouth materialised as the two men cackled. Before long, an inhuman shriek could be heard.
“Yes, yes, alright,” said Draco, as Kreacher started pushing him out of the kitchen by the back of the knees. “We better clear out of here then.”
“Ok good!” said Angelica, flopping back in an overly stuffed leather armchair. “This will be fun. Daddy has played all the best courses. One time, in New Zealand, we got dropped off by a helicopter halfway up a mountain. He always says that he gets some of his best business deals done on the golf course.”
Draco’s shoulders dropped some of their tenseness. “Alright, this should help,” he said, pressing the cup back to Cedric’s lips. Then, turning to Hermione he continued in a low voice, “He must have been heavily dosed. He'll be stable for a while but Veritaserum overdose can cause nerve damage if it’s not treated quickly. Do you know how to make a wideye elixir?”
“No sillier than working up a revisions schedule for classes you haven’t taken in three years,” said Luna.
“Fuck,” muttered Draco. “Not anymore. Alright, Potter and I will go to the Headmaster’s office and get his. Granger, you go to the dungeons to make a wideye elixir, but on the way I need you to make as big of a diversion as possible somewhere on the first floor. Try and tie up as many Ministry officials as you can, but leave the Divination stairwell free. We’ll meet back here and leave straight away, so Diggory better be back on his feet.”
“So that’s where they were going,” muttered Draco, making a mental note to leave a sock out for him.
“Oh dear, now how was this missed?” said Lockhart, sweeping back to his desk in a flurry of lilac robes and looking more concerned than he had been when Neville had flat out fainted a few minutes ago. “Students! Please. Turn to page 167, paragraph three. There is an egregious error in here where it says I brazenly approached the horde’s encampment, when I’m positive it should say I
No sooner had it swung back into place than the room started gently spinning around the table like a carousel, the frames rattling softly against the walls. Angelica and Blaise inspected some pictures with interest, chatting about Angelica’s most recent trip to the Amalfi Coast, while Gemma looked disinterestedly at her nails. Pansy was saying something to Harry about his early retirement and Draco, looking for something in the room to pretend to be interested in, kept his eyes on the chandelier overhead, which appeared to be stretching upwards.
As Draco paged through, Greenacre continued in a bemused voice, “This one has been on my books for a long while. I remember it falling through. It was a devastating blow. We ended up not executing on the buyout, and the investors and the American partner company were furious.”
Ignoring Draco’s thinly veiled attempt at derailing his endgame strategy, Harry moved his knight forward and Draco let out a disparaging sigh. “Your funeral.”
Draco looked like he was battling whether to run from Harry or to him. Harry’s eyes darted to the pile of gadgets on Sirius’s floor, stopping when his gaze reached something metallic. There, looking back at him, were red eyes.
“Sounds like you know more than the rest of us,” said Harry. “Now’s not the time to be keeping secrets.”
Harry didn’t come back to Regulus’s room the following night either. He was cordial enough in front of the others, but Draco knew he was still thinking about the memory of Alice Longbottom.
“He’ll be fine, Potter,” said McGonagall, clasping and unclasping her hands as she glided into the room. “Miss Granger gave me the full account. I blame myself really, I should have insisted on closer supervision of your studies. Merlin knows if it weren’t for the Ministry coming apart at the seams, I would have taught you personally. It could have been much worse.”
“If you keep that up, you are going to make me extremely jealous,” teased Draco, leaning down to kiss Angelica.
Voldemort looked like he wanted to spit curses at Harry until his last breath, but as he approached, the Dark Lord’s face broke into a frightening grin and his shrill laugh pierced the room over the din of battle.
Greenacre chuckled at this. “Yes, it is, but we at Greenacre Capital deal with both magical and non-magical alike. Private equity is a type of investment where the capital is not publicly traded. Meaning the investment is either with a private company, or in buying out a public company and taking it private. Then the business can be rebuilt or acquired and delisted. Do you follow?”
Hermione ran the length of the room as Draco staggered and fell to one knee. Harry’s heart dropped. He was momentarily frozen, but Luna came to his side, neutralising the spell on his leg so they could dash down the length of the hall to gather around Draco. Hermione was already ripping the tattered fabric away from his shoulder to get a better look at the wound, while Draco winced in pain.
“I think you’re overthinking things, darling,” said Draco, putting a hand on her arm and caressing it gently. If he could just corral her into a kiss, maybe he could distract her long enough to drop the whole thing. Otherwise they were heading towards a situation he might not be able to talk himself out of. “I really haven’t been gone all that long.”
“You don’t say,” said Harry, remembering the seriousness of the young Auror. “A little too hardworking if you ask me.”
“I can assure you that my mother and I have distanced ourselves from such a legacy. Angelica would have no ties to—”
Draco drummed his fingers on his knee in thought. He’d never been particularly close to the Headmaster personally, but it couldn’t be denied that he was one of the greats.
To his surprise, Voldemort instructed Carrow to crack a bottle of port and pour a glass for everyone. His eyes glinting in the enchanted flames, he raised a glass in toast.
“I wonder what it says about you that your favourite memory is of a Muggle sports team winning and you getting the shit kicked out of you.”
,” said Harry, tracing the familiar pattern in the air. The wand flickered to life, then sputtered, letting out a raspberry sound as it dimmed.
“Right,” Draco sighed. Unlike Loony Lovegood, he didn’t have time to wander around befriending paintings. “Well I suggest you take a look at the Thestral tapestry in the ancient runes corridor before you go about finishing your ‘masterpiece.’ All those things are just rumors. Anyone who’s seen a Thestral will know you haven’t got a clue what you’re talking about.”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking genuinely put out by the fact. “It’s not a subject that’s usually taught here. It tends to be linked to practitioners of dark magic.”
Draco’s mouth formed the words, but the Fidelius hit him like a ton of bricks and he groaned in frustration.
“This is insane,” said Cedric, shaking his head and crossing to the other side of the room to grab the jacket of his Auror uniform. “When you all are ready to stop being children about this, let me know. Until then, I have actual work to do.”
Tonks offered for Draco to stay with her while everything was sorted out, but after the calamity they had been through all Draco wanted was a bit of peace and quiet, and distance. From everyone but Harry.
“He did one time pull a full umbrella out of his jacket pocket when it started raining,” said Harry with a laugh. “I guess you just convince yourself of what you want to see – oh my god move already.”
She must be, given the shape she was in the last time he saw her. Hopefully she’d had the time of her life dancing at Aparecium and mingling with all the fashionable socialites and had simply tired herself out. With any luck, Pansy had played her role perfectly and put Angelica straight to bed for him.
“You don’t know me anymore,” said Draco, taking a few sauntering steps away. “Now run along to the common room, and don’t let me catch a word of this to anyone else.”
“Just because there isn’t a battle doesn’t mean lives won’t be lost,” said Harry, “A cold war is still a war.”
Pansy paused, searching his face for a moment and then dropped her wand arm. She stepped closer, lowering her voice to just over a whisper. “You don’t have to do this.”
Draco looked at the beleaguered group and felt a pang of sadness and something else – anger? – as it dawned on him what type of transport he’d be running out of London. Refugees.
At the far side of the room, Cedric ducked in through the fireplace, signalling to Hermione that this was everyone.
“That’s true,” said Harry in an attempt at amends. “But without Luna’s mad scientist perspective on everything, we probably wouldn’t have found the diadem at all. It was here in the room.”
Umbridge had effectively shelved Cedric’s reports, saying how useless he was and turning her attention to other things. She’d been busy contacting the surviving victims of some of Dumbledore’s old mistakes, like parents whose children had been injured on school grounds or old scholarly rivals, in an attempt to amass criminal charges against him.
But Harry had to know that if there was a wizard’s chess set in his possession, someone in his life knew more than they were letting on.
What he had not planned on was Angelica owling Harry Potter to extend an invitation to this excursion.
Harry navigated them both out of the memory, no longer requiring the small room as a pit stop. And by the time the two of them were back in the castle, he was beaming.
“The Dark Lord is requesting your presence,” said Wormtail. Lucius quickly rose to his feet. “Both of you.”
Luna went to spread out the pile of photos, but Cedric caught her hand. “Careful, there’s some heavy stuff in here. I’m not sure I should even show you.”
“Oh?” said Pansy, tilting her head to one side. “Seems a bit early in the season for long practices. Slytherin didn’t win last year’s Quidditch cup by running the team into the ground in the first month of school.”
As she turned around, placing the diadem on her head, Harry only had a moment to shout, “Luna, no!” before her eyes fluttered shut and she crumpled as if struck with instantaneous sleep. Harry caught her small form just in time and laid her on the couch.
This was interesting. If he’d been able to reveal there was a secret, maybe he could describe the Fidelius Charm.
Surely this man, one of the great figures in her world and a longtime personal mentor, was not suggesting that they leave their friends’ orphan child on the stoop of the most odious Muggle couple imaginable. She tried to argue that Harry would be famous, that he could never understand his place in the world from some second-hand retelling of a letter, but Dumbledore simply waved it away.
said Harry, withdrawing his hand and propping open the top of her terrarium so she could go wandering.
“No!” screamed Voldemort, stumbling to his feet and taking a few lurching steps forward. “Nagini, stop them!”
“That reminds me,” said Harry, turning to fix Draco with a questioning look. “How did you go with digging up any information on the DuPont deal?”
“Great!” Tonks rose to her feet, slapping Draco on the back unceremoniously and levitated their plates to the sink with a clatter. “You’ll be fine, chances are nothing even happens. Nine times out of ten it’s just a walk in the park.”
“Besides that, though,” said Harry, shifting restlessly. “It wasn’t just that you weren’t on the hunt with us, we were enemies. You betrayed Dumbledore. You… you were a Death Eater.”
“Happy Halloween,” said Harry awkwardly, as he tried to keep Luna’s attention on the small feast he’d set up on the coffee table and not the fact that the room was looking particularly bare. “Thanks for coming.”
“Of course he did,” said Hermione, seething. “Alright, well, charms can be useful too. Why don’t we skip to locking and unlocking?”
“I have only encountered this once before,” Snape was saying, looking past Harry as if he didn’t exist. “Another Halloween, many years ago…” He trailed off, a wistful look in his eyes.
“Let me tell you what Dumbledore sees in promising young wizards, Harry,” said Voldemort, his voice turning harsh, his bony hands wrapping around the edges of the armchair. “He sees talent for the purpose of moulding in his own image. A pliable magic, capable of becoming everything he wished himself to be. Only you can never live up to that image – not even Dumbledore himself could. And when you fail, you are nothing to him. You are cast aside like so many who were unable to reach the bar before you.”
“Hogwarts is much the same,” he said, sitting. “Slytherin has won our first two Quidditch games of the year. Pansy is still leading the duelling club and regularly striking fear into the hearts of new joiners. My marks remain high – I believe Lockhart might even try and put me forward as an Auror candidate if you can believe it.”
He was wondering whether McGonagall would let him take home a few books on basic curses or if the accident had cost him his chance, when a piece of paper fluttered out of
He turned towards Draco and took a few paces, stopping when they were face to face, his expression unreadable. Draco suddenly realised how large he was.
Pansy said nothing but stood rigid as he moved a hand to her waist, pressing a knee between her legs.
The two of them stalked the last few paces to their balls and stood in tense silence till Harry could take his next turn.
“Right,” said Harry, his eyebrows pressing together slightly. “You could have mentioned it sooner I guess, but it doesn’t surprise me you’d know where he is. So what’s the problem?
“I’m sure Diggory will be glad to hear it. He seemed desperate to know what happened to Han Solo,” said Draco, coming to sit opposite. “Listen, Harry—”
“Hardly,” said Draco. “You don’t know the type of scrutiny that’s on you as the only child of a pure-blood family. Lessons on everything since the time I could walk. Rules around how to spend my time, who to spend it with. It’s completely overbearing.”
Fuck. The last thing Draco needed tonight was a nosy Slytherin poking his head in where it didn’t belong.
“I would, but in case you’ve forgotten, I’m not allowed outside of my bloody room.” Harry clenched his fists.
“Nothing,” said Harry with a harmless shrug. “I’m just keen to see what your childhood was like. I’m picturing young Bruce Wayne, for the record.”
“They’re invisible?” he asked, as Luna began stroking the air, and placed Harry’s hand on a solid, warm patch of nothing. He could feel a smooth coat of hair, and the slow, measured breathing of a great animal.
So they were somewhere that Harry felt safe as a child. But where? Certainly this dusty cupboard was nowhere his guardians would want him to be. Draco had once hidden out in a wardrobe as a child and fallen asleep in his own imaginary world, only to be wrenched from the cosy space by a hysterical Narcissa who thought he’d gone missing. Vanishing cabinets were not uncommon in the Manor.
“Alright, follow the map and I’ll be right behind you,” said Tonks, holding off on mounting her own Thestral till the others were in the air. “If we get separated, just carry on straight until you reach the safe zone. Moody will know what to do if anything out of the ordinary happens. Just remember, the most important thing is getting these people to safety.”
“Remember what you agreed, if your scar starts hurting even a little bit we are turning right around,” said Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
“Well, you must have an excellent reason for it. After all, you can’t imagine I am in the practice of giving away information about my clientele. That would be a complete breach of their privacy,” said Ollivander.
Without another word, Harry closed the space between them. Before he knew it, his hands were on Draco’s neck, drawing him into a kiss.
“I don’t understand,” said Harry, frowning. What had the other wand done? Was his wand strong or weak? Of course, he would pick a wand that added another hurdle to his journey.
“You’re right, I should go find Angelica.” He went to stand up, but Pansy kept her hand firmly on his shoulder and pushed him back down.
“I’ll take your word for it.” Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to the door with one more demand to make of McGonagall. This time, however, he noticed muffled voices from within. He couldn’t miss the chance to eavesdrop on news of Dumbledore, but his normal charm proved ineffective.
“In that case, how can I say no?” said Draco with the best smile he could muster. This ended up being more a statement than a rhetorical question.
He collapsed on his back, looking up at the green shape in the sky, knowing that Voldemort saw it too. As an oppressive cloud of pain overtook him, Harry thought he saw red streaks of magic flying over him. The last thing he heard before he succumbed to the darkness was
“There’s nothing I can say to add to this account,” said Draco, honestly. He thought he saw Snape’s lip twitch.
“I thought you’d be happy to see him!” she continued, toying with the hem of her pleated pink skirt. “Besides, we need a fourth player to make it even.”
Maybe the soul fragment was something he’d have to play for. Al’s note said he’d have to challenge him for it. He turned the board around, playing white. It was worth a shot, anyway.
“Not sure what you’re worried about,” drawled Malfoy over by the sofas. “It could only be an improvement.”
Draco was still fuming at Blaise’s insubordination by the time he’d staked his way up to the 7th floor corridor. How dare he challenge Draco in front of the group like that? Though the information Blaise had discovered in the
He knocked on the door and heard a muffled confirmation from the other side. Harry was sitting up on his elbows in his bed, with moonlight streaming through the diamond-paned window.
“I found you, didn’t I?” said Luna with a quizzical head tilt as the curved wooden door appeared. She grasped the large wrought iron handle with one pale hand and pulled.
Draco aimed his wand at the book, and just as he was about to cast a voice from the end of the row asked, “What are you doing?”
as he pressed it to Cedric’s lips. Hermione and Harry both crowded around as he opened his eyes dazedly.
“How do I know you won’t just pick my future for me?” Draco asked, keeping his voice level but secretly quite keen to see what was revealed.
“Isn’t it obvious?” said Harry, fixing the others with a serious look. “Voldemort can’t be allowed to climb back to power. He has to be defeated.”
“Naturally. I would have thought six years in Slytherin would have taught you that leverage and friendship are synonyms for the weak.”
But Granger, usually quick to correct their professors, seemed to take no notice. She was bent over a piece of parchment, listing out a curriculum of spellwork spanning Charms, Transfiguration, and Defence. And she wasn’t alone in working on other things. Most other students were dozing, doodling on scraps of parchment, or frantically finishing their essays ahead of the afternoon’s double Potions.
“Stop,” commanded Voldemort, so forcefully Yaxley flinched. Voldemort rose from his chair, much stronger than he had felt in past visions. He plucked a phial off a nearby table with a pale hand and drank it, placing himself in front of an oval mirror. “Leave me.”
“Atoning for my sins more like,” said Draco, glancing down at his wrist, where the black snake head of the Dark Mark poked out of the sleeve of his jacket.
Only now that he had it did he realise the Mark wasn’t a sign of power but a brand of ownership. He was no more than a servant. The least he could do would be to help the resistance even in some small way, and then hopefully – mercifully – disappear forever.
“As I say,” said Cedric, turning back to Harry and repositioning his shoulders. “Just another once or twice, to see you’ve got it.”
Draco suddenly felt the heavy gaze of the other three. Damn, he’d have to keep better track of his stories.
“It’s too late for me, Pans,” he said, straining to retain his composure, the Mark burning like acid on his arm. “Go. Please.”
“What’s so funny?” asked Harry, propping himself up on his arms to pull back from the kiss, his face still inches from Draco’s own, smiling broadly.
“He’s dying from the burnout of the regenerative spells. He needs me to survive, he’s going to try and take my form somehow.”
Harry wanted to feel angry. He wanted to explode and send his aunt flying down the hallway like he’d done to Vernon, but he couldn’t feel anything. He was numb.
“And I was back at the school training students how to fight in Dumbledore’s Army,” said Luna, her eyes wide. “Where was Draco?”
“Found those too,” said Harry, feeling Draco come to stand next to him. “I think we’ve cracked your message. I have the ring, and we know what it is we’re looking for.”
Draco smirked to himself. No wonder Granger was so dedicated to the cause. She wasn’t helping Harry out of her big Gryffindor heart; she wanted the recognition for her apprenticeship applications. Maybe Hermione had more tricks up her sleeve than he’d given her credit for.
“Never better, Mr Borgin,” said Draco with a shallow nod. “You do well to keep an eye out for the activities of the brethren. Change is indeed on the horizon.”
“No? they must have been too busy intimidating a group of unarmed minors to have been looking very hard.”
“I find the portraits are more interesting to converse with. Ghosts are always repeating themselves,” said Luna, softening her paper ball. “I’m writing a sonnet with one of the portraits on the ground floor, you know. About a Thestral and a unicorn.”
How annoying. Draco had hoped the stupid painting would keep its mouth shut. He couldn’t have people like Loony Lovegood wandering around telling people he was softhearted, it would damage the reputation he’d worked for six years to build.
“I know she takes classes in the west corridor. Everyone does,” said Malfoy, sounding bored. “But how could I have known she would be there then? I covered for us. Trust me, the only thing she’ll remember about the last hour is what we did when we went behind the tapestry of the Hippogriff migration and—”
Draco and Snape shared a look, but Draco could read nothing in his teacher’s face. He swallowed hard. If the Fidelius was still intact yet the Dark Lord knew of Potter’s return, Draco had somehow found himself the missing link, unable to reveal what he knew.
“When you’re in there, it’s not like all your memories come flooding back. Concentrate on what you need to remember,” said Luna.
“Come off it,” said Hermione, brushing his hands away. “Harry nearly died, McGonagall is missing, and the rest of the world is acting like they’ve never heard the name Voldemort before. We need to know.”
“I’m not really supposed to leave the room,” he said, fighting his desperation to get outside of the castle for a brief moment, but not wanting to get Luna in trouble.
“Right, yeah,” said Harry, glancing around at the surrounding Death Eaters. They were either having a startling realisation dawning on them or they were too far gone in his mind games, Harry thought. Whatever the case, they didn’t look like they were expecting what Harry knew to be gathering outside the room at this very moment. “And let’s say I don’t want to become a living deity alongside you. What then?”
“Doesn’t sound any worse than the odds we’ve had till now,” he said, his eyes flicking up to meet Draco’s.
“I forgot that was how it ended,” said Harry, breathing heavily but finding a smile on his face. “It’s honestly one of my favourite memories.”
“I’m with Harry on this one,” said Cedric from his place by the window. All eyes in the room turned to him. Even Harry was shocked to hear the usually stoic Auror agreeing to something the others clearly thought was ludicrous.
Draco was not therefore surprised to find Luna and Harry perched on the window seat in the Friday afternoon sun, looking into empty teacups.
While they tried to figure out the best way to extract the basin from the office, the Phoenix swooped down from the tall cabinets, dropping something that looked like a stack of tattered old rags in Harry’s hands, before perching on his shoulder. He would have tossed them on the ground, but the portrait of Al was looking on with such pride that he merely pasted on a smile and shoved the thing in his pocket.
With an unsettling lurch, Draco was whisked away as Tonks side-alonged him without so much as a warning. They landed in a small clearing which appeared to have been at one time a park, only now it was overgrown and disused. The bare trees scraped together in the wind overhead and rusty swings creaked nearby.
“Leaving the two of you alone together is like watching a first-year Potions class. You never know what’s going to explode out of a cauldron,” said Draco, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Draco realised he had not said anything other than muttered thank you’s and was now standing with many eyes on him. Angelica gazed up expectantly, with her hand tightening slightly on his arm. Without another moment’s hesitation, he slipped back into character and wrapped a loving arm around Angelica, pulling her close and planting a chaste kiss on her forehead.
“Come on, Luna. There’s a better chance of finding Black Bart’s compass at the bottom of the ocean than having one turn up in the middle of a boarding school.”
“I’m sure you can afford gardeners if you’re living in a house like that,” said Harry with a good-natured eye roll. “Here I am showing you my cupboard and you’ve got an entire wing to yourself, probably. Not a care in the world, eh?”
“Too true,” said the bard, tapping his temple knowingly. “Exactly why I choose this time to write. No one around to disrupt the muse.”
“Wait,” she said, putting a firm hand on his arm, and then pulling back a few inches to look into his eyes. “I like to be in control.”
“Still working on the summoning. Hermione says it will be dead useful,” said Harry, looking back to the book with puzzlement. “Want to put a record on and help me practice?”
“I can make you something for that,” said Draco, before he knew the words were out of his mouth. “For the pain. I know a few healing potions that might help.”
“What’s worse is I thought it was the right thing to do. I actually believed that a blood traitor who defied the Dark Lord deserved to die.”
But his muggle clothes were feeling particularly warm suddenly, and he could feel sweat on his brow. And why did it feel like the air was suddenly stagnant? The pressure of Mr Dupont’s expectant gaze, Angelica sizing him up, and Potter just physically being present culminated in Draco miscalculating into a sand trap. Unacceptable.
The group ducked through the doorway into a massive room, packed corner to corner with plush looking booths in dark jewel tones. The high vaulted ceiling overhead was painted with cherubs and other rococo-style figures, who moved about languidly between pastel clouds, like Greek gods looking down from Mount Olympus. It was as though the Sistine Chapel and Trelawney’s divination classroom had come together in a single aesthetic.
This seemed to meet Voldemort’s expectations somewhat. He nodded and said, “Draco, Draco, Draco. Someday you will know the extent of where my followers lie. You are right, of course, that it takes years to get the proper network in place. Though I think it would shock you to know how deep my web already runs.”
“I understand your concerns,” said McGonagall. “Once we discover how Miss Lovegood accessed the room, we shall simply adjust the room’s logic to protect against it.”
McGonagall stepped back as though she had been slapped across the face. “Where did you hear…” she started, her breath no more than a whisper. In a moment Harry felt a pang of sympathy for the woman. She looked more stricken and sorrowful than he had seen her yet. But she also looked scared.
“So it’s true,” said Yaxley, turning to his friend. “It’s better than we could have hoped. We’ll be made kings for this.”
“So what, she just turned up out of the blue?” Draco asked, his eyes darting to the fireplace instead of at Harry who was sprawled out on the couches, attempting to levitate the cover of a book open.
“No, Luna, as we discussed, we’re only teaching Harry relevant skills,” interrupted Hermione. “Magic he can use if he needs to protect himself.”
“Thank you, my Lord.” Draco smiled at the honour as Yaxley slapped him on the shoulder. Only one more night of playing into this farce and he’d be back to Hogwarts where he was meant to be. Back with Harry.
“Good luck, darling,” said Pansy, grabbing the front of his robes and dragging him down for a kiss. Draco’s eyes flicked up momentarily to catch Theo watching.
“This is a completely different situation,” said Draco. “We were recruited into this group, let me remind you.”
Then, without warning, she lept off of him. His eyes snapped open, and he quickly propped himself up on his elbows to see what had happened. She stood by the foot of the bed, laughing as she pulled the robe back around her slight frame.
“I’m not sure I want to,” said Draco lightly, his pale eyes flitting across the board before landing on a pawn. “It wouldn’t be the same without your sorry arse on the 7th floor to sneak off to all the time. I think I’d be quite bored, actually.”
“So allow me to make you an unprecedented offer,” said Voldemort, turning his back on Harry to return to his throne of a chair. Harry had the mad thought that he might have a chance if he took it now, but he held fast. “Join me and ascend to greatness by my side. I can offer you power beyond your wildest dreams; revenge on the family that abandoned you, control over those who once looked down on you. And immortality to outlast even the greats like your so-called mentor.”
A sudden change in the music dragged Draco out of his thoughts and back to Aparecium, where Gemma was still chattering away and laughing at something she had just said. He absently massaged the back of his hand at the memory of the black quill and realised that his whiskey glass was once again empty. As the room around him came back into focus, his eyes darted around for another waitress to order a drink from. How many was that again?
“Wish I could say the same,” said Harry, suppressing any tremor of fear in his voice despite the fact that he was the most terrified he’d ever been in his life. “But you don’t look anything like the Tom Riddle from Dumbledore’s memories.”
on Halloween and the disappearances of old loyalists. I think it benefits us. Let the rest of the world wonder while you regain your strength. By the time you’re ready to take a seat of power, your followers will have had time to prepare.”
“Not to mention it’s long been rumoured in his circle of followers that You-Know-Who never believed that Harry was killed. It’s too much of a coincidence not to be true,” said Luna. Hermione turned to her, a dumbfounded expression on her face, to which Luna replied. “What? It was in the
“Me either,” said Draco. He wanted to return the look of hopeful earnestness, but the only thing he could remember from the encounter in the Headmaster’s office was McGonagall’s screams.
“I’m telling you! We’re on the same path, just in two different places,” said Harry, returning her serious gaze. “So far, we’ve got two of them, but we don’t know what to make of the new one. We’re waiting for you and Cedric to arrive.”
“Still?” asked Draco. Cedric turned to cast a withering look in Draco’s direction. Harry could feel a smile pulling at his lips.
Draco was still trying to collect his thoughts when there was a rustling from the couches and a very sleepy looking Potter sat up with the diadem in one hand.
The most interesting item on the shelf had been an action figure which, after leaving the memory of nicking it off his cousin in a heist-like fashion, Harry was shocked to hear Draco did not recognise. He had proceeded to show Draco a memory of several episodes of an animated TV program, which Draco was forced to admit were captivating. What was there not to like about a millionaire playboy masquerading as a bat in the name of vigilante justice?
“Oh! Sorry, I don’t know what’s gotten into her,” said Harry, moving to collect her. “She must really like you.”
By the time they were back in the corridor, Hermione didn’t waste any time grabbing Harry by the elbow and leading him to an alcove where she cast a Disillusionment Charm and marched him back to the Room of Requirement, grumbling about inferior wand cores and the setback this would cause to their lesson plan.
“Right, I’m sure he’ll be back any time,” said Harry, nodding reassuringly. “You know how he can be. Classic Slytherin, right?”
Draco kept his eyes trained on the ceiling, but he couldn’t lie to Harry. Not now. “I had a feeling he might know something about it. He said the Dark Lord asked him to keep it close by. I think it’s with him at Wisteria Hall. Or maybe the Manor.”
But Ivy didn’t move to coil around his wrist like she usually did. Instead she turned her diamond shaped head towards him, flicking out her tongue gently.
“Gets loud in there, doesn’t it?” said a familiar voice. Draco looked up and saw Harry on the far end of the balcony, hands in the pockets of his suit, wind rustling his hair.
“I’m sorry, Professor, but I have to object to the Occlumency. We don’t know enough about him to be training him to close off his mind. It may interfere with interrogation in the future.” Cedric looked agitated.
called Harry, drawing his wand in a wide arc across the room and watching the red sparks shoot down the end of the corridor until – There! The sparks bounced back off of a shape in the fog and Harry had a split second to cast a powerful
“Compassionate, as always,” said Snape, in a bemused monotone. Draco let go of a tenseness that he hadn’t realised he was holding.
“Yes, but you forget I know Potter better than any of you. I’ve been inside his head,” said Draco, taking a sip of Butterbeer. “And I’m sorry to say there’s nothing in there.”
He had spent so many years trying to cover it up, wondering why he was cursed to have survived the accident that killed his parents, but suddenly, it felt like the most powerful thing in the world. A few of the students started murmuring to themselves. Ron and his crew nodded appreciatively, and everyone crowded in closer, their eyes on Harry.
As they were making the move to leave for the day, a flurry of owls arrived through the high window. He could see his family’s eagle owl in the fray, a black envelope clutched in one claw. It swooped to a perch beside him, dropping the letter neatly on his lap. He handed it a bit of bacon before opening the letter.
Harry sighed, shifting further under the covers. His mind was filled with the everyday dilemmas of schoolchildren, who never failed to approach him with their myriad and oddly frightening accidents.
Fear and anger tore through Harry as his magic released, sending a burst of energy through his small room and severing the connection. As his consciousness slipped away, he could see the worried face of McGonagall hovering over him and whispering a healing spell.
Draco could feel the panic rising in young Harry, and was surprised to find that he seemed genuinely concerned for the other boy’s welfare. Wasn’t this the same kid who had thrown rocks at him? Draco would have let the boy go to teach him a lesson. If you can’t keep your head above water, you shouldn’t be swimming.
“I already told you! The Ministry rounded them up and destroyed them. You know it’s really dangerous messing with time.”
Harry froze. How Luna knew the things she knew, Harry would never understand, but he recognised his cue when he saw it. Taking a few more mouthfuls of potatoes, he pulled on his heaviest jumper and grabbed his bag from the foot of the bed. By the time he turned around, Luna was already back in her school robes, folding a few pieces of meat in a napkin.
“Trouble in paradise?” drawled Blaise, who was reclined at the potions desk in front of them, reading the weekend’s Quidditch results while Theo scrambled to finish their draught.
Harry sighed. “Have you looked into this family? I did some digging and I’m concerned they’re not altogether on the straight and narrow.”
Draco turned to leave, catching Luna’s eye, who looked just as surprised by the recent turn of events as he was.
“It’ll look strange to Ollivander to have a student under a Disillusionment Charm and we might not have a chance to remove it without another student seeing. McGonagall doesn’t want to let him into the Fidelius, so we have to be sure he won’t be able to identify you by your looks. Now hold still.” Hermione leaned forward with her wand outstretched.
Pansy fixed him with a sisterly look of reproach. “If you say so,” she said, “If I didn’t know better, I’d say this has something to do with Potter. Or is he really just settling the score over a golf bet?”
“What I couldn’t get out of my mind was that scrap of a letter you were trying to write your mother at the start of term. Something about a boy. And a secret. Something the Dark Lord would want known.”
to follow. The Weasley twins helped the last few stragglers out the door and waved encouragingly as the group set off through the streets, dim in the late afternoon sun.
“Gone, it is,” said Kreacher, fixating on the fake locket in his hand. “Gone. When Mistress cleared the house. She told Kreacher we would not need it, and let Kreacher keep her brooch to protect instead.” At this, he turned over the chest flap of a toga-like wrap he was wearing to reveal an exquisite cameo brooch.
The battery rolled about a metre across the floor with a loud scraping noise, scattering motorcycle gears in every direction.
Draco showed flickers of Dumbledore at his finest; welcoming first-years to the sorting ceremony, awarding Slytherin the House Cup, and even presiding over the Yule Ball. But he showed gentler memories too; how Dumbledore used to wander down to the lake to check on the giant squid, or how he always helped himself to the largest portion of pudding at the staff table. Or the times he used to wander into “Minnie’s” classroom, just to remark on the cleverness of Transfiguration students’ more exotic attempts.
“No, unfortunately Mr Dursley is falling behind in his classes as it is,” said McGonagall, before Harry had a chance to respond. “If you’re unable to assist, perhaps I could contact one of Gregorovitch’s apprentices—”
“She said the same thing, actually. I saw her in the library with a gigantic pile of books on dark magic. She’s really worried about it, and about you, too. And she came round to remove the wards off your door – says it’s ‘a violation of your civil liberties,’” said Luna.
As he was remembering the duel in the bathroom with diadem Draco, real Draco turned to him, his blond hair falling in a delicate swoop across his eyes. Their eyes met and Harry’s darted away.
“You’re right of course,” said McGonagall, betraying a tone of worry. “Perhaps we should reconsider.”
“What the hell, Professor,” said Draco. Snape propped himself up on an elbow at the edge of the stone basin, looking like he might be sick. “You can get lost in there if you’re not careful.”
“Good news, I caught McGonagall before she had to go off to another counsel meeting and – what’s so funny?” asked Cedric as they took in the other three, who were in varying states of laughter, Luna rolling on the floor.
Draco nodded. “Right, well, that might be the problem. Try focusing on a discrete memory rather than just a feeling. Show me a memory where you remember the day exactly.”
“I’m in,” stuttered Draco. The memory of his own parents came unbidden to his mind. This is what he was here to do. To make sure no one else lost the ones they loved for someone else’s pointless war.
“Oh shush,” said Hermione, flapping her hand, her cheeks flushed. “You never even took half the classes I spent time in that year. Though I have to say, Divination and Ancient Runes were a total waste.”
Draco was no stranger to the odd party hit, but what could Potter, a recently retired Auror and ministry golden boy, possibly be thinking messing about with the stuff?
Malfoy tilted his head as he studied Harry, his long fingers drumming on the arm of the sofa. “Alright, let’s try that. Show me a time when the little guy won.”
“I’m quite astonished,” said Draco, collecting his thoughts and wondering about the scope of the charm and whether he’d be able to relay this valuable information to certain interested parties. “It seems a hard thing to keep a secret for this long. Surely every teacher, every friend, every shop owner, would have heard the name before. Would have recognised him. Where has he trained?”
“I know, mother, and I am eternally grateful,” said Draco, tucking a stray lock of blonde hair behind her ear. “But do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you’d chosen another path?”
But no, he had a responsibility back home in Surrey. He and his best friend were going to make something of their lives, and it would not be magic tricks that got him that. It was going to be actual skills, a real future. And getting as far away from Privet Drive as soon as possible. To that end, Ivy wasn’t wrong – the Dursleys were the last thing he wanted to go home to.
“The Ministry is astounded by the disappearance of a second patient from St Mungo’s Janus Thickey Ward in under 6 months,” said Pansy, picking up the paper to read under her breath. “The ward, which treats patients suffering from permanent spell damage, was recently reinforced with Ministry class A protective wards following the disappearance of long-term patient, Alice Longbottom, in May of this year.”
“We’ve already tried that,” said Harry, sitting across from him. “Besides, didn’t you say practising recall clarity would help? I’ve been practising sharpening one in particular.”
The trio were in stitches as they paged through the rest of the book, pointing out incorrect assumptions or hearing Luna’s thoughts around the true purpose for a laundromat. They were just on a hilarious section illustrating current Muggle fashion trends when Cedric and Draco walked in.
Harry recognised a few of the more outlandish memories, and he and Draco swapped stories; Harry retelling the mundane version Al had told him and Draco recounting what had actually happened until the light from the window faded away entirely.
“Look, I don’t care who goes or who stays, but I’m getting tired of standing around here,” said Harry, grabbing his glasses off the desk and jamming them on his face. He squinted and pulled them away again.
Draco shot a glance over Pansy’s shoulder at the onlookers, and all three heads whipped back around as they started whispering furiously. All the better for him. He was determined to make sure everyone in the school knew how madly in love he was with a girl.
“The same reason we were all unsure in the beginning,” said Draco, gesturing out to the group. “I was concerned Potter might be dangerous. That
“Harry’s magic is strong, remember?” said Hermione as she ran her wand across the edge of the gash and Draco struggled to hide a wince. Harry felt a small hand on his shoulder as Luna hovered by his side.
True to form, Malfoy did not press the matter of the memory of Al any further over the following days. And with Luna and Hermione doubling down on lessons, Harry found himself easily distracted from thoughts of his past. He was determined to get whatever he could out of his time at Hogwarts, and get back to his real life as soon as possible, and if that meant never finding out the truth about his parents, so be it. His priority was protecting the pieces of his family that were still alive.
Umbridge huffed an unpleasant laugh and came to stand opposite McGonagall at the desk. “You do know that ignoring a Ministry summons is grounds for arrest, correct?”
“You probably don’t want to hear this, but you’re not friends with Malfoy here,” said Hermione. “In fact you completely despise him. You’ve been at each other for years, he’s always been awful to you. Starting rumours, playing dirty. And he’s done a lot worse than that.”
“Exactly, but we don’t want Harry to be seen out in the corridor, so I was thinking we’d set up a guardian ward. That way Harry can only leave the room if he’s with one of us under the charm. We’ll put him under disillusionment, leave the room, then return with the intention to have a training space. And we can switch it back before we go.”
Cedric looked more taken aback by this change in direction than if Malfoy had simply shoved him right back.
“I think we’d know by now if someone was on to our normal grocery runs,” said Draco, steering her away from the window, towards the game of chess he and Harry were playing by the fire.
The day of the first snowfall of the year started normally enough. Luna had awoken Harry at 6 o’clock in the morning, flitting in to check whether the mimbletonia was flowering after the full moon and chattering animatedly about the effect of moon phases on some more sensitive plant species. The mimbletonia was not affected.
“Did you get what you needed?” asked Pansy, tucking her hair behind her ears as she turned to face him with an unimpressed look.
“Wait wait wait, my good sir!” said the bard, leaping into a painting of a pastoral scene to catch Draco’s eye before he was out of sight. “Can’t you recall the many nights we sought the muse together? I have been eager to regale you with the finished product. It is, I believe, a sentiment you too will understand.”
!” said Harry as he slashed the air and a bright jet of red light shot from the end of his wand down the length of the room like a flare gun. The slashing definitely helped the wand release sparks, but there was something about having Malfoy next to him that seemed to positively impact his magic as well.
“Well, I guess you’ll need a bit of all three in this line of work, eh?” said Fred, slapping Draco on the back as he passed by.
“You didn’t,” said Harry, tensing. “They wouldn’t believe you, they haven’t got any idea about magic or any of this.”
Unable to stay alone in the empty home under the watchful eyes of the black family portraits, he left through the front door as well. He made the first right down a residential tree-lined street and let his feet carry him from there.
“Quite the motley crew you’ve gathered,” said Draco, sauntering over to their regular spot on the couches and casting an
“Do you know them, Harry?” asked Charlotte, her voice trembling. At the mention of his name, the two men shared a look of utter delight, their faces splitting into yellowed smiles.
Voldemort snapped his fingers and a pair of Death Eaters came forward, holding a cloaked figure by the arms. Bringing her into the light as she was shoved down on her knees, Harry saw Charlotte in person for the first time in months. She was so close he could practically touch her, but he dared not. Her eyes were glazed over and cloudy, clearly under some heavy enchantment, as she stared blankly at him.
“Wait a minute, at least stay a while,” said Harry, grabbing him by the shoulder. “We were just catching up. Have a seat, change out of your robes, you look like you’re heading to a funeral.”
Whether it was to share something or to peek into Harry’s current mindset, he couldn’t be sure, but it pissed him off that Malfoy would try weaponising something that was so personal to them. He threw up the strongest Occlusion barrier he could muster and tore his eyes away to glare at the door.
charm, the next he’s set the bedsheets on fire. I wouldn’t want to teach him a Stunning Spell for fear he’d send someone’s head flying.”
“It’s fine, really,” said Harry with a laugh. “I’m here all the time. And I’d rather spring for you guys than Gemma’s friends.”
Nymphadora bent double with laughter. “Ha! Nice try, but no. I’ll be getting you a Cleansweep replacement just like the last one was. What kind of salary do you think I’m on, anyway?”
“Thanks, but I think I’ve got what I need,” said Harry, marching to the end of the bed and zipping up his backpack roughly. “If anything comes up, I’ll be sure to flag down the nearest owl.”
“You’ve just seemed so distracted lately it’s hard to tell where your head is sometimes,” said Pansy, leaning her chin in her hand. “I mean you hardly spoke on our date to Madam Puddifoot’s, and you didn’t even laugh when I cast that sticking spell on those two fifth-years that were snogging.”
“I don’t want to know,” laughed Harry. “But where are all your friends? Surely you would have a million memories with Pansy and the rest.”
Draco deferred any further Legilimency sessions until after the break, though he had a feeling the dreams would be around much longer than that.
“I guess so,” said Harry. “It just seems like a waste of time. And I can’t even practice without a wand, which means I’m not getting any closer to the sort of spells I really need. I’m starting to wonder whether there’s really any danger and if I even have a chance against it if there is.”
Maybe with a bit more context he could figure out how to access the memories on his own. He’d rather not have to spend the time with Malfoy if he could help it, though he had to admit, the look on Malfoy’s face when Harry showed him his first experience at a Muggle cinema was pretty priceless.
The dark man said something in a low voice. She replied something biting, but edged in fear. Harry was certain he wouldn’t be able to understand their conversation, but Draco urged him forward. He could almost hear him saying to sharpen the recall, to block out everything else but the two people before him.
“What Voldemort did in the first war,” continued Harry, ignoring the several gobstruck faces of students as he said the name. “Was to attempt to divide the magical community even further, by telling us that something as arbitrary as bloodlines could make us enemies. My parents died trying to prove him wrong, and I’m not about to let their deaths be in vain.”
“On it,” said Cedric. “Hopefully he’s smart enough not to go near Diagon Alley. The papers are going wild with rumours.”
“This ought to be good,” said Harry, crossing his legs under him and sitting up straighter, ready to reach out into Draco’s memory.
“I’m really nervous about it, Professor,” said Hermione at an emergency meeting in McGonagall’s classroom. “Does this mean anyone can just walk up to the room and find Harry?”
Damn, Luna’s knack for guessing was uncanny. Had he completely lost his touch? Between her and Pansy, he might as well be walking around with a badge on that said “I heart Potter.”
Draco was just starting to feel back in control of the conversation when the fireplace near them roared up with green flames and Harry stepped out, straightening his glasses and running a hand over his hair in an attempt to flatten it. A small cloud of dark ash kicked up around his ankles as he stepped over the hearth onto the pristine Persian rug.
There was something different about the grey gaze today. Maybe it was the fact that he was the first person to show Harry he was really on his side and not on some other agenda. Or maybe it was the fact that he’d been able to provide the exact advice and reassurance that Harry had been craving since he got here. Or something else?
Draco took a seat obediently and tried to recall anything about his life in this version of the world. The woman at the stove hummed as she cooked, cracking a couple eggs and tossing the shells into the sink. The tune sounded a bit like a lullaby his mother used to sing to him, but it was punctuated by a yelp as she burned her hand on the pan and her hair immediately turned a deep scarlet. A Metamorphmagus.
The afternoon would have been uneventful except for two things. The first was the almost overwhelming sense of loss that Minerva felt as she played the news of Lily and James’s deaths over and over in her mind, coupled with dread at the thought of what political turmoil was going on in her own world at this very moment, and what other lives might be lost before this thing saw its end.
“I hate when Angelica’s predictions are right,” he said, leaning back into the embrace, as Harry laughed.
“Why not,” said Draco, hopping to his feet and walking down the long corridor of the practice space.
Draco’s eyes again flicked to Harry. “It is if you can achieve prolonged life,” he said. “If you can store a piece of your soul somewhere safe, you double your chance of survival from the fates.”
Draco pulled the bezoar back out of his pocket and dropped it back into the drawer, closing it with a snap.
Harry felt a sudden jerk at his side and turned to see Malfoy ghastly pale and shaking. Their faces were inches apart as they huddled together under the cloak and Harry could see sweat forming on his brow as McGonagall’s screams continued. He put an arm around Malfoy’s waist, drawing him close and keeping him standing.
“I know very little beyond these walls, unfortunately,” said Snape, lingering on the last word. “Might I suggest returning to the original source?”
“Fair,” she said at last. “And while we’re on the topic of unsolicited advice, maybe the reason you’re struggling with Occlusion is that he doesn’t trust you all that much either. Have you tried relating to him at all or are you just watching him bare his memories to you from up there on that pedestal?”
Draco’s eyes flicked to Snape, who had a faraway look as though he imagined he were somewhere else. McGonagall leaned closer, her hands laced together on the desk.
Harry paused. He moved the book to the side and reached out for an item on the shelf. His hands closed around a seashell.
“Me neither. Maybe just tea then,” said Draco, trying to locate a kettle but his eyes falling on the old bottle of wine instead. “Or something to steady the nerves?”
“Shrub has tried her best, sir,” said the house-elf, blinking back tears in her protuberant eyes. “But sir is not moving from the basin’s edge, sir.”
“As to whether the danger is real,” said Draco, his eyes darting away. He shrugged. “Who can really say? But if McGonagall and Dumbledore said there was something to fear, it’s better to play it safe. It makes sense for you to ride out the next few weeks here at least. Did she say when you’ll be ready?”
“Professor, why are you here?” he said, as a thought occurred to him. “I told you—I’m listening.” Draco glanced at him, a small crease between his eyebrows joining the one on his cheek.
as the two men started directing spells towards the sound of his voice. The last thing he saw before they were consumed in a cloud of white smoke was Charlotte’s face, tears welling in her eyes. Fuck, he hoped she would run.
“We must discern that separately, but it doesn’t change the circumstances for Harry,” snapped Dumbledore, betraying a hint of emotion behind his words. “If Voldemort’s followers know he’s alive and set out to kill him, there’s nowhere he’ll be safe. What wizarding family would stand a chance of protecting him where Lily and James failed?”
“Keep your musings to yourself, bard, or I’ll tell McGonagall to move you to the astronomy tower,” snapped Draco, annoyed at the pointless delay.
“It’s more than possible, there's a prophecy. It’s the reason the Dark Lord went after you in the first place. It said the one with the power to defeat him was born to rebel parents at the end of the seventh month of that year.” He watched as Harry’s eyes widened, remembering how deeply Snape wished he could have protected Lily. “He believed it meant you.”
It was a long shot, but there wasn’t much to lose at this point. Maybe it would unlock something for Harry. Maybe it would build some trust, as Granger suggested. Whatever happened, if he wanted to access the green flash, Draco’s hours were numbered.
“Well, I’ve been hogging him all week, so I thought that would give you some time to get to know each other.”
In a flash, the thick body of the snake was hurtling through the air in their direction, its fangs flashing as it pierced the air near Lucius’s shoulder. Lucius aimed a blast at the snake which dodged him, slamming him into a wall of the room.
