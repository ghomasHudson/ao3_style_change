“Don’t feel fine,” Harry grumbles. “Feel dumb.” His knees hurt, yes, but his pride is far more bruised than his body.
Draco murmurs a
“Cursed AT me!” Draco said, pulling his own wand and keeping the door closed. “Calm down, Harry!”
He sent a gentle Hot Air Charm at Harry, drying him. Harry nodded his thanks.
“But it’s
Harry gently kisses Draco’s eyelids and Draco lets out a huff.
Harry was stretched out on the opulent bed, his face full of emotion, but his body wasn’t moving. There was a huge sword by his right side and his wand was in his left hand.
“He didn’t even want you!” Harry proclaims.

, Harry.”
Standing still for a few moments and catching her breath, Hermione looked down at Bellatrix. She was convinced that she had vanquished the other woman and looked up. She whispered, “Father, I miss you,” before healing her wounds and running off to try and find Ron and Harry.
“Imagine what we could do if
“It’s well made?” Harry tried.
Harry retaliates with a deep inhale and revels in Draco’s shiver. “I want to smell you all over,” he whispers.
Harry nodded under him. “You feel different than a girl.”
He makes sure he’s as crisp and posh sounding as possible. If Harry’s going to tease, Draco will do his best to counter it. When Harry falters in his step, there’s a fluttering in Draco’s chest.
“You’re such a sap,” Harry says.
“Yes,” Draco agrees. “But not when we’re naked!”
He focussed all of his attention on finding a rhythm with Draco, their slick pricks sliding against each other. Draco’s was as hot as a brand against Harry. He gave as good as he got, wrapping his leg around Draco’s hip and fucking up against him. Harry writhed and groaned until Draco reached down and grabbed them both with his long, clever fingers.
“That was way better than the Muggle club,” he exclaimed.
“No,” Harry says, stilling his hand. “I thought I would do it for you.”
“I mean, yeah,” Harry says to his meatballs. “You had to have known.”
“Do you think it will work?” Luna muttered as they walked away.
out here.”
“Hawwy!” Rose cries as she runs to Harry and grabs him at the knees.
“Have fun, Dad!” Scorpius shouted from the sitting room.
“I am engaged to the next king of Wiltshire,” Draco said in what he hoped was a placating tone. “If you would allow me the use of an owl, I know he would pay you handsomely for my return.”
“That feels so good,” Harry gasped. “I’m glad you’re not treating me like I’m delicate any more.”
Running to his closet, Harry grabs his jacket and shrugs it on and as fast as he can, then Disapparates to meet Draco.
“But—”
“Tea,” Ron says in greeting.
“I can’t believe so many people came,” Draco said.
He was in uncharted territory with Draco. They’d never been close, had
“For Circe’s sake, Harry, don't finish that sentence.”
“Well then, I'll have to remember to bring sweets when I next visit so we can have a somewhat normal interaction in the future.”
Harry smiles as he gets up to follow Draco to his office. “Mental,” he says to Ron as he walks out of their office. “You’re mental, mate.”
“That’s very thoughtful of you.”
“There was no mention of murder, Zacharias!” Hermione butted in.
“Go,” Ron says waving his arm at where Draco's just been. “We’ve got everything under control here. Help where you can, but go.”
“Could you stop talking while I climb?” the man in black shot back.
Harry looks up at Draco who is still smiling and flushed and reclining in a faux-relaxed manner. Harry can see the slight lines of worry around his eyes and Harry has to reassure Draco that he doesn’t dislike—
The store was packed. People were having a hard time moving and Draco could barely think over the various conversations.
“You didn’t tell me you had a whole speech,” he says into other Draco’s neck.
“It’s lovely,” Emily said with a meaningful look at Draco.
Draco was having a hard time keeping a fond look off of his face. There had always been something about Potter that had caught his eye. When they were at Hogwarts, no matter what Harry insisted, they had hated each other. But Draco’s eye was always drawn to Harry; Harry with his messy black hair; his dark skin that made the bottle green of his eyes stand out; his baggy, messy clothes that seemed to dwarf him. Now, ten years later, Harry still looked the same but he dressed a lot better. He was currently in a green henley and dark jeans that fit so well Draco wanted to know who had tailored them. However, Draco was sure they were unchanged from when Potter had bought them off the rack.
right there— they wouldn't have had the patience for the slow way."
“Nobody hates you, Draco,” Harry said.
“That seems oddly specific and also false,” Draco says, interrupting Harry mid-babble. He grabs Harry’s face and makes him look directly into Draco’s grey eyes.
“Stella makes me and Emily go out into the sun occasionally.”
“I think she would,” he said walking to Sorpius’ room. “But there’s no need to shout.”
“I got it at the shop, Harry,” Luna says as she starts banging things around in the kitchen. She must use magic to heat the kettle because, almost instantly, it starts to whistle and Luna is back in Harry’s room with a steaming cup of tea. She holds it out, proudly, and Harry takes a sniff of it.
Hours later, it was just Harry and the Weasleys and their various plus ones.
Emily, for the first time since Draco had known him, looked impressed. “That was brill,” she said. “I had no idea you could do something like that!”
“Ginny gave it to me,” he admitted. “She said something about us needing all the help we could get and that it might come in handy. I kinda forgot about it until just now.”
“Thanks, Stella,” he said.
“He gave me a drink and I’m almost certain it wasn’t Firewhiskey. It’s gotten me rather bladdered.” Draco glared at the burly Weasley. “I think he’s trying to take me out so he can snatch you up.”
Harry shuts him up with a kiss, close-mouthed and chaste. Their noses bump a bit, but Draco’s lips are soft under Harry’s and Harry sighs into it. Draco tilts his head and deepens the kiss, licking at Harry’s lips. Harry retaliates by nipping at Draco’s lower lip. Draco opens his mouth and coaxes Harry in.
Harry smiled at him. “I mean, we got all sorts of things besides kitchenware.” He pointed at the sofa that was set up in front of a fireplace. The fireplace had a television mounted over the mantle. “You’re connected to the Floo Network, just for calls, it’s not big enough to actually Floo. And I warded your telly like I did your mobile so it should be pretty indestructible, but still work. Emily got all of the things she uses for movies and logged you in to her accounts.”
“Professor, I’m so sor—”
Harry laughed and kissed Draco back, finally,
Draco smiles and the tips of his ears turn pink, making Harry smile in return.
“Ack!” Harry shrieks. “What was that for?”
That was the other reason he and Emily had become friends. When they had first moved, the building the family owned had been fully occupied and they had been living at the local inn. Emily had caught Draco in the midst of a rather violent Scourgify strop in their room. The linens would forever smell like lavender, but he had inadvertently outed himself as a wizard.
When Draco had learned of Voldie’s betrayal, that he had not in fact sent Harry back to his ship, Draco had snuck into the castle’s resident Potions Masters’ quarters and stolen a phial of pure essence of Belladonna. He made sure it was packed with his belongings when they were all moved to the Honeymoon Suite. Opening his valise, he cancelled the charm that hid the false bottom and took out the phial. Choosing death over marriage to the foul Prince Voldie seemed to be his only choice, so he took out the stopper and moved the phial to his lips, ready to drink.
Harry flinched again and then, to Draco’s dismay, turned away to face the room.
“So I need to—” Draco said.
The man in black let out a little hum, the small smile still on his face.
Potter followed Draco like a little lost puppy. Stella already had a paper cup ready for Draco and he nodded his thanks. Then they stalked off to Draco’s flat.
“Please what?”
“I’m going home, Potter.”
Draco could hear the people outside talking. “Should we do this?”
Harry nods his assent and grabs their one pillow that’s slightly bigger than the others and wedges it under Draco’s hips.
“I’ll take off my shirt if you do,” Harry said.
were regrettable choices in Draco’s opinion.
“You know, Malfoy’s not so bad,” Harry said, his mind on
Bellatrix looked around, wildly, at Hermione, then back to Ron and Harry. She spared a split second glance at her fallen guards. Her wand started to shake in her hand. Then, unexpectedly, she turned on her heel and ran away.
Later, after Draco had dropped off his mother’s tea, he decided to drop by the General Store.
“Sure, love,” Harry says, and goes into the kitchen to get it together. Draco stays in their sitting room and looks at all of the pictures on their walls. There are plenty of baby pictures and group pictures, but Draco’s eye is drawn to the triptych of wedding photographs.
"You were expecting me, then?" Harry can hear the smile in Malfoy's voice. Which is nice because now Harry's studying the ankle boots Malfoy's wearing.
“Tea would be nice,” he replied.
Malfoy looks at them all like they’ve grown two heads. “To Potter and me,” he says sceptically.
Draco let out another sigh and went to sit on the sofa with Scorpius. “It’s fine,” he said. “I’m probably blowing everything out of proportion.”
“He’ll grow out of it when he learns what a prat you are.” Harry lets out a short laugh and Draco’s cursed ears heat again.
“We all have,” Draco said quietly.
“Draco,” Harry gasped.
Throwing back his head, Harry laughs, and Draco feels a small sense of pride at the volume of the laughter. When he’s recovered, he asks, “Is your home covered in green and silver and snakes?”
Ron and Hermione carried Harry back to the castle. They found an abandoned battlement where they could see the gate.
He pushes Draco’s knees apart and settles between his legs. Draco’s head pops up again to look, first at Harry, then at his cock.
“Uh.” Draco had to clear his throat. “I just, wow.” He swallowed. “That was
“Fine!” Potter shouted. “But you’re obviously close enough to spend the night! I
“Here’s your tea,” Stella said, interrupting them again.
“To the sign?” he asked Harry’s back.
Harry’s head pops up, and Draco almost kicks him as he rolls over.
Running towards the edge of the cliff, Zacharias screamed, “INCONCEIVABLE!”
“I’m sure the door’s unlocked,” Draco shouted back.
“He will rule by my side for what I hope are decades to come. I present to you… Prince
“Harry, make Draco a cup of tea,” Hermione
“I would hardly call you a ‘bitter’ enemy,” Draco says, finally moving. “More like an annoyance.”
Harry barked out a laugh. “It’s fine,” he said walking to where Draco was pacing in front of the shop counter. “Molly has a charm that will keep the plates of food full and if we run out of wine, well, we don’t really want drunk customers. As far as the discount goes, that was your idea so I don’t know what to tell you.”
She reminded Draco, a bit, of Pansy.
“Why would they do that?” Harry asks.
“So I talked to the owner of the building and she gave me a lease agreement. Apparently, if we don’t lease it, they’re going to sell it and tear down the building. I got a tour while I was there and I’ll be honest, it’s really nice.”
Draco’s really glad Harry stretched him so much.
There were various nods and several people said ‘yes,’ and Draco decided it would be better to ignore them all and take Harry his coffee.
“Might we have some tea and biscuits?”
“Like ‘em fine,” Harry says, feeling his face catch fire. “Just didn’t know you got one.”
that might give them an idea of where the man in black might be hidden. She let out a sigh that sounded like a sob. “Father,” she whispered. “I have failed you. I have lived my life to avenge you and now that I’ve gotten so close, I cannot finish my task. Not alone. Somewhere, close, is the man who can help me exact vengeance on your murderer but I need your help.” She closed her eyes and dropped to her knees, unholstering her wand. “Please Father,” she murmured. “Please, help.”
Draco pulled Harry close until they were skin-to-skin from their shoulders to their toes. They tangled their legs together and Harry could feel himself start to get hard.
Hermione lets out a laugh. “What is it?”
“Hey!” Harry exclaimed. “Those were my favourite pair.”
“Is this OK touching?” Draco’s voice was the most tentative Harry had ever heard.
“He died well, if that means anything,” Black said. “Does it upset you to hear me speak of him?”
“Why wouldn’t I accept a drink from him? Isn’t he one of your brothers?”
Draco let out a sigh. “Yes?” he asked, already dreading Potter’s response.
They had to drive, but Harry had a license and Emily lent them her automobile. Though that was a very kind way to describe the hunk of rust and metal that made a weird sound when Harry shifted gears. When they pulled up to the town line, Harry sputtered out a laugh and pulled over into the grass that surrounded the sign.
“Do I need to call a Healer?” Harry asks.
They make their way to Harry’s bedroom and Harry flicks on the light, thankful that his room is clean. Harry watches as Draco sheds his trousers and shirt, then rushes to follow suit. They settle themselves into Harry’s linens in their pants and undershirts and Harry whispers “
Draco,” Draco says.
“So we’re going to lease the building?” Potter asked, excitement evident in his voice. He got up and flipped the light switch.
time we attended Hogwarts?” He casts one last time at the clown and looks incredibly satisfied and continues, “Their greatest hits album came out last year, OK?” Draco narrows his eyes. “How exactly did we get on the subject of mid-90s girl groups?”
The man in black gasped as he was, once again, knocked against the boulder, but kept his arms wound tightly around Ron’s neck. “You see—” Ron wheezed out. “When it’s—” he pushed back against the boulder yet again, his voice strained— “when it’s one—” he let out a harsh gasp and fell to his knees. “One man…” he trailed off and the man in black laid him gently on the ground.
Ron had a weird look on his face. “
“Now?” Hermione asked Harry.
“Blah, blah, blah?” Draco asks.
“Whatever,” he said to them as his mother finally picked up.
“I have passed on
and I’m spoilt. They pretty much leave us alone. We have a small sum of money that we have to live on for the rest of our lives.”
face.  Draco takes a large drink of his wine. “Absolutely not.”
A few weeks went by before Harry
“And then, well there’s the matter of that shirt,” he says as he openly ogles Harry and dammit, Ron was right. “I mean, I knew you were fit, but sweet Salazar.” His eyes are sparkling as he takes another sip of wine. “I realised maybe you weren’t
“I’ll go get Draco now,” Harry says and hangs up the phone.
“Are you getting emotional over the size of your bed?” Harry seemed genuinely surprised at Draco’s reaction.
“Are you the miracle woman, Ginevra, who used to work for the king?” Hermione asked.
“Yes!” Hermione squeaked. “How will we find Draco? And once we do, how will I find Bellatrix? And once she’s dead, how will I find you both? And what will Ron be doing while we find Draco and Bellatrix? And once we’ve rescued Draco and I’ve slain Bellatrix how will we all escape?” She took a deep breath, but before she could continue, Ron cut her off.
Draco rolls his shoulders and considers his options. “Honestly?” he says. “We both had an early morning, and as much fun as this has been, we will both eventually get too tired to finish.”
“I can’t believe Stella talked us into
looks and whispers, “I’ll keep you safe,” and lets his eyes close.
“Sober Draco will care.”
With a wiggle, Draco takes stock of his body. The stretch in his legs is a little more than he had anticipated, but he’s not quite gone to pasture yet. He and Harry are both fairly active still and go on walks together and sure, he’s not twenty anymore, but he’s certainly not old. The mattress under him is soft and supportive and his back feels fine; his hands are a little sweaty from holding his legs, but it’s more of a nuisance than anything.
Colin Creevey must have taken the picture, Harry decides. It’s from a Gryffindor/Slytherin match and the players zoom around in the frame. But what makes Harry smile is that, in the centre of the photo, the focus is Second Year Harry and Draco taunting each other, hundreds of metres above the ground, relishing in the fight. Harry watches the younger versions of themselves argue for so long he loses track of time.
Ginny’s face got even redder at the mention of his name. “Yes!” she half shouted. “You said he could
Harry did a double take. “Why are you here?” he asked.
“I found him lurking and muttering to himself,” Pansy said.
With a sigh and an eye roll Draco nods. Draco’s never been one for overly flowery terms of endearment, but with Harry’s focus on him, sometimes they slip out.
“You are an areshole,
Draco kissed him again to shut him up. He gently moved Harry, backing them up until Harry’s legs hit the mattress. “I’ve wanted to get in your pants since we were fifteen.”
“Yes, yes,” Harry agrees.
“Hello boys,” she said. “Welcome to the hotbed of activity in our little Hamlet.” She looked around the room and nodded at the other people there. “You all know my son Draco, and this is his little business partner, Ha—”
“Good night.”
She started to grab things around the room, a fire bellows, her wand, some goggles, and a pair of gloves. “You’re lucky you found me,” she said as she walked back over to the table. “You don’t even know the difference between all the way dead and mostly dead,” she grumbled. She looked appraisingly at Ron and Hermione. Making up her mind, she nodded to Ron. “You,” she pointed at the man in black, “hold his mouth open.” While he was following her orders, she put her gloves and goggles on and used her wand to lift the bellows. She levitated it over and it settled gently into Harry’s mouth. With another flick of her wrist, it inflated and blew a gust of air into him.
“Ron and ‘Mione’s is a safe place,” he whispers to himself. “Malfoy isn’t a racist arsehole anymore.” He takes another deep breath. “You’re a catch, Witch Weekly’s Best Smile Winner for the last decade,” he tells himself with a wry grin.
Hermione shook her head. “He saved his small country from a madman, sacrificing himself at the very end. He has a husband and a small child who need his support.”
“Well that was dramatic,” he says. “Are you going to be OK?”
“How goes your progress in the Thieves Forest?” Voldie asked the Carrows.
"I thought I was bisexual and I know penetration isn't the end-all-be-all of gay sex but I wanted to know if I would enjoy the feeling."
“Yeah, he’s a real nutter,” Ronald agreed, “Hermie.”
WIth a wry smile, Draco answered, “It’s been a few years and it wasn’t unexpected.”
The clock on the mantle chimed
“Potter, I don’t know what you think—”
The rest of the Weasleys looked at Draco in confusion.
It was a fairly chaste kiss. Open mouthed but no tongue, just two people moving together for the first time. Draco closed his eyes and moved his hand to cup Harry’s face. Then it was over and he pulled back and looked at Harry to make sure he had read things correctly.
“OK, that’s my cue to drag Harry home,” Draco interrupts. Gently grabbing Harry’s arm, he pulls him out of Hermione’s embrace. “Don’t sniff people,” Draco scolds gently.
“It’s milk for your
“Luna!” Ginny half shrieked.
“Cheeky!” Draco said. You’re spending far too much time with my mother.”
They walked into the restaurant and Draco looked around. The black and white checkerboard floor was a little intense but the framed prints of multi-coloured fish on the accent wall were funny. Patrons were seated at a bar area and in a couple of booths with well worn looking wooden seating. There were no empty chairs to be seen. The sounds of forks hitting plates and laughter filled Draco’s ears and the sharp smell of vinegar assaulted his nose. Under that, he could smell the fish and chips and it smelled
Smiling, Luna answers, “It tastes perfect as it is, Harry.”
Reaching up, he pinches Draco’s nipple and smirks at the gasp Draco lets out. In retaliation, Draco slides his fingers in to gently stroke Harry’s hole. They’re doing little more than humping each other in the shower, but it feels like the most brilliant sex they’ve ever had.
At least, that was what Draco had told Harry upon the news of the trip. So they had traveled to France and were staying in a hotel on Rue Daunou. Draco complained that it was a bit
Draco groans and lifts up his head to look at his prick. “We’re obviously not going to get any,” he says to it. “Let’s go home and I’ll treat you right.”
“Do not!”
Harry walked over to Draco’s corner and sat down on the floor. “Oh,” he said. He looked up at Draco. “That makes sense.”
Harry, and he started to feel hot, the pressure building up behind his breastbone and behind his bollocks. He panted and swore and
“You know everyone can see us,” Harry said between kisses.
“No worries,” she said with a little smile. “If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be.”
Draco turned to look at her. “When did you see Emily?”
“HA!” cried Voldie from his chair in the corner. “I knew it!” he exclaimed. “You don’t have any…” he trailed off as Hermione pointed her wand at him.
Harry stares at him.
“I just wanted to know if maybe if Scorpius came to visit Rose, if you’d like to grab dinner one day,” Harry finally got out.
!” Draco whines.
“You know you said all of that out loud,” Emily said.
Draco leaned over to grab his wand and sent a gentle cleaning charm at Harry followed by a lubrication spell.
Ron snorts. “I’ll be sure to get right on that, Ferret.”
They reached Draco’s building and Draco looked at Potter again. He was smiling faintly and the light from the lamp reflected off of his glasses. Draco thought he looked incredibly lovely.
,” Draco said, letting the hurt come out in his voice. He was half-way to being proper drunk and he wanted Potter to feel bad for coming out of nowhere.
“Blimey,” Ron exclaimed. “That’s loads more than thirty men.”
Harry’s perpetual awkwardness threatens to rear its ugly head so he takes a healthy gulp of wine and grabs a piece of fried food.
Another shoulder bump and Emily said, “Yeah, but it’s what matters now. You’ve obviously changed from the arsehole you used to be.” She moved to lean against Draco. “Besides, we’re about to watch the dumbest movie ever made while we’re high. Don’t bring me down.”
“OK, ‘Mione,” Harry said. He went over and gave her a hug then pulled Ron into one as well. “I’ll talk to you both later and I’ll be here Saturday before Draco gets here so we can talk strategy.”
“By all means Zacharias said, “come closer. I’ll kill him before you—”
“Will you be going home?” Draco asked.
“Yes, while everybody is calm and we can get away,” Draco agreed.
"I—" he starts. "No, you—" he tries. “Love?” he croaks. He shakes his head. Vehemently. “But, Draco—”
“Harry, we do
and Harry screamed. He thrashed as the blood in his body started exploding and—
Ginny straightened her shoulders and looked at Luna. “Let’s get to work!”
Draco leaned down and did as asked.
“I’m not going to judge you for where you live, Draco,” Potter said with a frown.
a pirate, an occupation that does not lend itself to steadfastness.”
Not knowing about the fears for his safety, and needing solitude after the royal proclamation, Draco changed into his green flying robes and grabbed his broom so he could clear his mind. He noticed a broken carriage, in the middle of a field, and landed, hoping to offer some help.
“Oh, I’m aware I’m over sharing right now, but you did ask for
you’re fit.”
“No!” Harry replies emphatically. “And it’s fine if
“Why?”
Thanks for the invite.
“If you’re sure,” Harry says.
“Ronald!” Hermione shouted. “Leave the newlyweds alone.”
Thrilled that Draco has dropped the terrible name and is in fact getting them a table for two, Harry smiles and lets himself look at Draco. Apparently, Harry was not the only one who went home to change.
Harry kisses Draco’s arm. “No problem.”
“I won’t last long like this,” he gasped out, and Draco let out a low, breathless laugh.
“Hermie, maybe now’s not the time.” Ron reached to grab her hand, behind Harry where they both had hold of him, and gave it a gentle squeeze. “I know how you like a plan, but he’s had a tough day.”
Draco shook his head. “It’s fine,” he said. “I honestly can’t believe you’re all being so nice to me.” At Hermione’s look, he clarified. “I know Scorpius is wonderful and I appreciate you letting him spend time with someone his age, but I didn’t expect to be welcomed as well.”
“...That’s oddly specific,” the man in black answered with a frown. “But no, it’s just me.”
?” Ron nodded and threw the rock off to the side. It clattered loudly but neither the man in black nor Ron paid attention to it. They both nodded and sized each other up.
Emily and Draco looked at each other.
“See?” he asked.
Prince Voldie was in his chambers, again at his desk, waiting on the Carrows, his Chief Enforcers, to come. He was finishing a missive, when Alecto cleared her throat. “Sir?” she asked.
“Oh you poor dear,” Emily said, her voice full of mock sympathy. “You’ve put up with his histrionics for almost two decades.” She stood up and went to Potter’s side. “I have some good whiskey behind the counter. I can pour you a few fingers.”
Draco rolled his eyes and made himself comfortable on his bed. If he was going to talk about the last year, he wanted to be on something a bit more plush than the hard wooden chairs.
”, but the door stayed locked.
“What?” he asks in a sleep rough voice.
Al and Scorpius groan in tandem.
“That’s not the part I’m asking about, Draco!”
Then Draco curls around Harry, and
Harry debates rushing out of their office in a huff but remembers why Ron is his best mate.
“Drinking Draco’s wine and telling him he should get off his arse and get a job.” She smirked and grabbed the bottle of wine from Draco’s hand and topped up her glass.
Draco let out a big sigh as he closed his eyes, unwilling to even look at their flat. Their
Harry let out a huff of breath. “So it will be torture?” He let out a dry laugh. “I can do torture.”
“Oh,” Harry teased. “A fibre of common sense.”
“Who decided this was the way people should greet each other?” Potter muttered. Then, after shaking far too long, he said, “I’m Harry Potter, but you can call me Harry.”
Draco doesn’t respond, casting a Stasis Charm on the toys and Disapparating away.
Her uniform was plastered to her body and her short wet hair hung into her eyes. Draco could still feel the power of her glare through her sodden appearance.
Harry, Draco decided, was a much better helper than Scorpius. That was to say, there was nothing wrong with his son, but the attention to detail and just
After the hustle and bustle that was involved in a meal with the Weasleys, Hermione found Harry in the kitchen, cleaning up.
He gestured towards the fireplace and watched as Scorpius grabbed a handful of Floo powder then listened closely as his son, very clearly and precisely, shouted the correct address. Scorpius had only been Flooing alone for a few months, so he was still anxious about having them end up at separate places. But so far, his fears had all been unfounded. Draco grabbed his own handful of powder and braced himself for the journey.
“Well let’s eat then.”
“Don’t cry, Draco.” Harry’s voice is a little frantic.
Zacharias let out a hysterical shriek. “I’m only getting warmed up!” he shouted as a little bit of spittle flew from his mouth. “You have beaten my giant, you must be relying on your own strength to keep you safe from the poison and would have put the poison in your own goblet. However you also bested one of the most talented duelists in the world, which means you’re obviously highly logical and know that strength alone cannot save you from poison, which means you would put it in
Harry looks down at his ratty jeans and t-shirt, things that are fine under his Auror robes, but definitely won't work for a first date.
Draco quickly scanned the menu. “I’ll also have a pint of lager, please and the Mayfair Classic to eat.”
Draco pretended like he didn’t hear Potter. “I need to get a tea for Mother.” Draco was annoyed that Potter had made him forget. He turned to glare at him. “
“I was just thinking about how different my weddings were,” Draco admits, settling himself on the sofa.
Then it was Harry’s turn to be levitated to the ground. Draco had already grabbed a broom and Harry climbed on behind him. Hermione’s arms were wrapped tightly around Ron’s middle as they shared their broom. Taking off in tandem they flew off to their freedom, confident in their love, sure of their safety, glad to have found friendly faces in their conspirators. They flew until dawn and love filled Harry and Draco’s hearts as they landed. Harry swept Draco into a breathtaking kiss. Time itself seemed to stop as they kissed. Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind.
Draco turned to Harry who looked as gobsmacked as Draco felt.
they’re healthy.”
Draco’s happy to comply. Harry moves so he’s on the far side of the bed, and Draco lays down next to him.
The whole process is over in a flash; Harry’s far too nervously excited about dinner to linger. And Draco has been the main star of his most recent masturbatory fantasies, so all of Harry’s thoughts are consumed with the thought of skin the colour of fresh cream and a posh voice groaning Harry’s name. Before too long, he’s gasping and splashing come on the shower floor, his toes curled and his breath coming fast.
They walked, hand in hand for several long minutes before Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Harry, how exactly did you end up as the Dread Pirate Black? Everyone knows he’s been marauding for twenty years and you’ve only been gone three!”
“So, we’re really doing this?” Draco asked.
And, well, if Harry thinks Draco’s arsehole is
She fiddled with her phone and the movie started.
The man in black looked down at his feet and frowned. “I’m so sorry for your loss.”
After learning Falkor was a lucky dragon from an ancient text, Draco bid Emily goodbye and made his way home. Before he made his way upstairs, his mobile buzzed.
Draco shivered again and felt his cock start to firm up a little bit. “The
Harry let his hand rest on Draco’s leg and gives it a little squeeze. “I’m glad you listened to superior intellect,” he says and Draco lets out a small laugh.
Eyes twinkling in the candlelight, Harry smiled. “That doesn’t sound like something that
Harry let out a laugh, a true laugh, at that. “Let’s change that then.” He looked back at the clearing. “Now tell me how I can help you with your weather gear.”
“Oh.”
With an inscrutable look Draco asked, “Why?”
“You asked him out? Brilliant!” Ron crows.
“Then welcome to our house,” Hermione said. “Would you like something to drink? Tea? Water? Some wine?”
“Come in!” Hermione said with a smile as she ushered Draco in. Then, “Oh you look nice.” She turned around and shouted, “Harry, Draco’s here!”
“I need him to help me find revenge for my father against a six fingered woman.”
can’t
“That’s…” he started. “You weren’t exaggerating about the horribleness of the sign,” he said.
Ronald scoffed. “Good luck with that,” he muttered.
“Rich?” Harry asked, leaning against a tree and trying to look nonchalant.
“Potter, when we first started working together I thought you hated me.”
Draco humps the bed again and then stops, his whole body tense. He lets out a little sob and rolls over to his front, this time not missing Harry’s head.
Scowling, Ginevra—
“He was very gentle and caring,” Harry added. “There was lots of meaningful eye contact.”
Their next date is drinks and dancing at a club. They dance and grind on each other until Harry’s left hard and sweating and they go back to Harry’s to dry hump on his sofa. Harry wakes up the next day thankful he doesn’t have to work and spends half his day in a lust-filled haze, wanking himself raw.
After a few more minutes, Hermione said, “We’re almost to the top but the man in black is gaining on us.”
Draco shivers. “Didn’t know it was a kink of yours, Harry.” His voice is impossibly soft.
"All of it." Harry takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry you grew up surrounded by hatred—"
“This was mine,” Draco says, clenching his jaw. “She gave this to
is what I remember; that and his green eyes. Not many people are polite to pirates, so it rather stood out. But he spoke of you, his True Love as if you were an angel; your generosity and kindness knew no bounds; your beauty beyond compare.” Black scoffed. “Maybe it’s better he died all those years ago, instead of finding out your love was conditional.” Draco stood stock-still as Black asked, “Did you wait a full week before becoming engaged or did you agree to marry the prince as soon as you heard of this Harry's passing?”
“Crups are cool!” Scorpius says with a squeak. “Here,” he says to Lily, gently handing over Peanut Butter. The boys run off to Al’s room, chatting about what they would name a Crup if they owned one. Mrs Malfoy smiles at Lily and asks her about the origin of Peanut Butter’s name. Jamie is nowhere to be seen, having presumably escaped to his room.
“Ah, my darling,” Voldie said when he saw Draco enter. “We’re to marry tonight and all of the kingdom’s owls will be sent out to deliver the joyous news.”
“Motherfuck!” Emily shouted. “Warn a woman!” After she quit screeching, she looked at Draco. “Now aren’t you glad I told Stella about magic?”
“We need to change places,” Draco murmurs into Harry’s skin.
“Harry,” Draco gasps after a minute. “I’m going to come in my trousers.”
“This is so much better than last year!” Scorpius says, almost vibrating out of his skin in his excitement.
"Fuck me," Harry whispers.
He lets his intentions show on his face and Draco nods and leans down, letting their lips meet in the middle. They’re both far too tired and raw to do more, but Harry leans into the kiss, enjoying the warm, wet slide of Draco’s lips on his.
“Harder,” he insists. “Or faster.
Harry shook his head. “Neither you nor I are idiots,” he said with a scowl.
“What can I do?”
“You and Weasley were talking about—”
Drained by the hustle and bustle at King’s Cross, Draco decides he wants something stronger than tea. “Firewhiskey?” he asks.
“Sorry,” Draco says.
Ignoring their conversation, Draco walked over to the sofa and made himself comfortable. Somehow, his Muggle, sarcastic-as-shit best friend and Harry had become friends. Draco let their conversation wash over him as he thought about the logistics of the opening.
“This one’s not my fault!” Draco demanded hotly as they both made it inside.
With a smile so big it shows off the tooth she’s missing, Lily runs out to her brother, shouting, “Who is the owl from?”
“How are your glasses not broken?” Malfoy asks, actual interest in his tone.
Ron takes advantage of the fact that Malfoy’s attention is elsewhere and leans into Harry.
Harry’s babbling. He’s completely babbling but he’s also helpless to stop himself.
The next week Harry is able to take Draco out to Pasta Was a Rolling Stone again. They both wear looser clothes and eat their way through several amazing dishes and a cannoli that’s so perfect, it brings tears to Harry’s eyes. They’re too full to do more than roll around in Draco’s bed and kiss. Harry spends the night and they wake up with just enough time to kiss a bit. Harry has to Floo back to his flat for a quick wank before work.
“Fuck,” Draco cursed. “From the back I thought you were my—”
Draco had to admit that was a good point. He waved his wand at himself and his clothes disappeared to his closet. At that moment he realised two things: one, his Mark was exposed and two, Harry could see his scars from sixth year. He cast again and he was fully dressed.
With a sigh, Draco let himself fall over so he was lying down. He let out a yawn. Things were set to open, he was warm, and Harry and Emily were talking quietly across the room. Draco drifted off, warm and happy.
The man in black turned his back on Draco and Zacharias, and when he turned around again, he was gently swirling both goblets of wine. He placed the one in his left hand in front of himself and the one in his right hand in front of Zacharias. “Now it's up to you,” he said with a small smile. “Will you drink your own wine or would you prefer mine?”
“Next time,” Harry promises and wastes no more time in taking Draco down his throat.
gasped.
He’s interrupted by the Malfoys' eagle owl. Scanning the note, he grabs his biro and writes down their address, and the owl flies off. He’s assuming they will be Apparating because if rumours are true, Draco and his son live right outside wizarding London, which is a brisk forty-five minute ride by broom.
Harry, who is in the middle of a bite of mouthwatering chicken, starts laughing and chokes.
“What’s wrong, love?” Harry asks as Draco makes his way through their lounge into their bedroom. He flops onto the mattress that’s still on the floor, their bedframe not yet assembled. Harry’s footsteps follow him into their room.
Potter chuckled behind him.
“That’s not—”
Draco turned and stalked back to the café. He got a few metres before Potter caught up to him.
Feeling suddenly shy, Draco turned back to the castle. “Thank you, Po— Harry,” he said, starting to walk away. But he could hear Harry’s footsteps behind him, so he assumed he could hear. “I need to collect my son before Profess— Minerva, gives him too much sugar and he never sleeps again.”
“Because it’s packed full of guests for the holidays.” Harry tried his best to frown. “I’ve told you all of this several times. Are you going senile in your advanced age?”
Then she shrugged her shoulders and looked at Draco. “If you’ve truly changed and are actually sorry, then let’s start over.”
The breathing has helped his anxiety and he takes the time to look for clothes that will compliment him instead of what’s nearby.
“I’m not making bacon sandwiches either,” he tells her as a consolation.
Draco’s curled up in the foetal position and letting out little gasps, sure he’s permanently injured himself.
“Ron.” Harry’s voice was clipped. “Tear her arms off.”
His mother, true to form, had brought them dozens and dozens of narcissus. Part of Draco’s upbringing had been to learn the language of flowers, so he knew she was wishing them well. Draco was amused to see she had also made wishing them success about her.
He let out a little shiver—not sure if it was from nerves, from the cool air, or from the intense eye contact he and Harry suddenly had—and cast a Warming Charm.
“Muggle’s probably fine,” Ron continues, ignoring Harry’s outburst. “There’s this tiny, hole-in-the-wall Italian place ‘Mione found, Pasta Was a Rolling Stone. It looks like it's right out of a rom-com, but it’s got the best red sauce I’ve ever had. And meatballs as big as your fist.”
“Goodnight, Harry,” Draco said, half asleep.
“We're armed,” Bellatrix drawled. “Don't be foolish.”
“I was about to come!” Draco hisses again because apparently that’s a thing they do now.
Harry winked at him and put his hand in his pocket. A moment went by and Draco saw several of the Weasleys put
Hermione didn’t answer, but she finally stood, hunched over in pain.
This time it’s Draco who pulls Harry in, and he wastes no time nipping at Harry’s lower lip and gently fucking Harry’s mouth with his tongue. He swallow’s Harry’s groan and starts to mouth along Harry’s jawline.
Last year had been Scorpius’ first year at Hogwarts without his mother. Draco was dating Harry, but things had been too casual for Draco to want to share Scorpius’ attention. Astoria had only passed eight months prior and they had both been a little emotional.
letters, ‘Welcome to Hooker’s Hamlet where your balls and bat feel welcome’.
on his hand.
“Oh, well if it’s not her cooking, let’s go.”
Draco nods.
“Who are you?” Hermione asked as she was backed up into a wall made of stone.
talked about their feelings or emotions, but Harry suddenly wanted to wipe the melancholy look off Draco’s face.
“I’ll spell a cover-up,” Draco promised, briefly lifting up, then going back to sucking at Harry’s neck.
Narrowing her eyes, Bellatrix
They were still shaking hands and Draco had no idea what to do with a friendly Potter.
He and Harry were in Draco’s barn, tending to the Malfoy’s menagerie of creatures as the sun set one autumn evening. Harry was feeding the hippogriffs. Draco didn’t care for them, (he had been on the receiving end of their ire) so he gave them a wide berth. Draco was infinitely more intelligent, so he was tending to the estate's parliament of owls.
“The fact that everybody knew I was in love—” Harry pauses and feels his eyes go wide. “Um, that is to say, we were talking about your tattoo and how brave it was for you to get it and whether or not it hurt and how I’m too in love with myself to ever get one. And Ron said that it mustn't hurt too much because—”
in love with you.”
“Everything,” Emily and Stella said in unison.
see Malfoy again, he can't look him in the eye.
“Molly Wealsey?” Draco stood up from his squashy chair in the corner, looked at Harry, and sat down again.
“Yes, I’m familiar with the musical stylings of Jason Mraz.”
-Draco would like.”
“You really do love me,” Draco groans.
Scorpius' prediction turned out to be true. A month went by with no incident, though Draco had checked things four times before each event, and Draco started to relax. A little. The second month after the
Stella darted in and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and ran off, with a shouted, “Sure!”
Nodding, Draco said, “I’m right behind you.”
Harry looks up and takes in the surroundings for the first time and smiles. Their table is covered in a red and white gingham tablecloth and a wine bottle with a candle is in the centre. The bottle looks old and there must be a year's worth of melted wax cascading down the sides. The walls are covered in black and white photographs of Italian landscapes and Harry suddenly understands what Ron meant when he said the place was out of a movie. It's at once, horribly cheesy and so very perfect Harry's heart could burst.
Holding the door open for Harry, Draco followed him out into the cool evening. Harry held out his arm for Draco and they Apparated away.
"I'm dropping by because of the doll—"
“Yes,” Luna agrees. “Let me make you a cup of tea. I have a new blend that should be soothing.”
"What, Weasley?" Malfoy drawls. "Do you and Potter need directions on how to get back to the Ministry?"
“I suppose watching something would be tolerable.”
“I dare, darling, because you’re not half drunk,” Draco replies.
Draco scoots his chair closer to Harry and places a gentle kiss on his cheek.
“I want to try everything,” Harry said, a little breathless.
“He—” Harry gasped, then laughed some more. “Why did you let Charlie Weasley give you a drink?” he asked when he had finally calmed down.
“It’s just weird,” he admitted.
“Potter!” Draco shouts. “I may not be divine intervention, but please cease your caterwauling!”
“I don’t understand why that keeps happening,” Hermione said with a little frown. “I’ve been keeping up with his business and I’ve only heard good things. Molly’s not the only one who met with Minerva. She says he’s changed a lot since our school days.”
Their verbal sparring is interrupted when Draco walks into the office.
“This place is creepier than the Manor,” Draco said. “I wouldn’t—”
“I’ll be fine, I just want to kiss you,” Draco says. “I need you to distract me.”
“Can I touch you?”
Hermione snorted.
“We’ve drawn a crowd and they all seem to want to stab me,” Potter said with a smirk.
“Shame about today,” Neville murmured, looking at the children who were settling into the squashy sofas and chairs in big groups. All of the Fourth Years and younger were chattering excitedly about the sudden rain while the older teens were striving to act
the mental picture, Harry.”
“Maybe skip the garlic bread though. Unless you’re opposed to kissing on the first date.” Then he seems to realise what he’s said and backpedals. “You don’t have to answer that! And it’s not
“You weren’t much better, Potter.” Draco walks to Harry and stands behind him, not quite touching, but close enough Harry can feel the displaced air when he breathes.
“But you’re so pretty,” Harry says in a quiet voice.
Draco got caught up in the story of the teens who found some conspiracy theory guy and they got stuck in some sort of pod on its way to China. And there was the really fit guy who believed that the middle of the Earth was some sort of paradise. And the giant robot that looked like Godzilla. Then the scientists, and possibly the teens—Draco had no idea—all got into ships to take the large monkey down to the centre of the Earth.
Draco can only laugh. “I think it’s just part of getting older,” he allows. His next words are cut off when Harry spreads his cheeks and there’s the quick chill of a cleaning spell.
Harry laughs. “There can be wine,” he promises. "I'll owl you the details when I figure them out?"
Draco simply says, “You,” and Harry loses his mind, leaning down to kiss Draco, fucking his tongue into Draco’s mouth and
“I’m not saying you have to ride off on your broomsticks into the sunset—”
Draco snorts a little in disbelief. “Fine, Potter.” He makes his way to the sofa and grabs his blanket, pulling it around his shoulders. He glares at Harry. “I don’t have a telly so you’ll have to entertain yourself.”
Harry has to bite back his smile at the indignation in Draco’s voice. “What did you have in mind?”
He’d had to ring up a cat hair scarf and some soap for a woman. Harry had been the one to suggest the cat hair scarves and they were surprisingly soft. They were almost sold out on the floor.
Harry sat back down.
“Pensioners,” Ron answers. “All of them in the sixty and over crowd.”
Harry shrugs. “To be fair, this is the first time we’ve been naked together so it’s not like it’s a trend.”
Draco let out a sigh. “Potter, no.”
“No!” Ron gasps. “You take that back right now, Harry James Potter!” Then he gasps again. “You’re right!” he half shrieks. “We always thought Charlie was going to be the next Mum, but it’s me!”
“Why would Bellatrix leave something here?” he asks. “If her goal was to hurt Muggles, what would she accomplish by hiding a cursed object somewhere nobody would want to visit?”
where
“I spent the first two months living at the inn because all the flats were occupied, but then a tenant moved out and Mother and I moved in.” Draco looked at his hands as he recited his story. “For some reason, the most bitter person in the place imprinted on me and the rest of the town seems to tolerate us. They think my mother’s
“But the WWN calls it—”
“Harry,” Hermione interrupts them all. “Go home.” She looks up at Draco and shakes her head. “He’s going to be a terror tonight,” she says.
Stella rolled her eyes and left.
kill each other, but before he could say anything, she continued, “What if it turned into a lovely business?”
Draco reared back. “They hate me that much?”
Voices drift into the large room, and Draco looks frantically for a place to hide. Two large forms, both in Auror robes, turn the corner and Draco freezes in panic.
“Draco!” Harry shouts again and bangs on the door.
Ginny laughs as Harry lets out a sigh.
Fred cackled.
Deciding even the worst of moods could be cured by tea, Draco was in much better spirits when he went out to gather his equipment. Minerva,
“I’m awake,” he insists, grumpy.
Shaking his head, Harry responded with a solemn, “No. To the pain.”
Then a couple of years after
“You’re fine, Draco,” Harry assured him.

“We need to go,” Scorpius said, ignoring the correction.
“What are you doing?” Harry murmured.
but i’ll have you know, i have those exact jeans and i’m gay af
Malfoy comes almost immediately after Harry sends the memo and takes the bear, no sign of the softer, flirtier version of himself evident. He’s preoccupied by the toy and frowns at Harry, distracted.
“Uh, Ron was the one who—”
“Nice to meet you, Draco,” Potter said,
“Yeah, mate,” Ron said as he ran in, right after the toddler. “You’re right and you should say it.” He picked Hugo up and blew raspberries on his belly, making Hugo giggle.
Potter laughed again. “No, they honestly don’t care about you—”
“J’accuse!” he shouted, pointing at Emily.
The next morning,
“Prince Voldie, do you promise not to hurt him?” Draco repeated.
“Why is Harry making out with his desk?” Seamus asks, after walking by and pausing, then coming back to stare at Harry.
Letting out a sigh, Ron asks, “Do you think we should take it back to the office or have Malfoy come out here and look at it?”
what I mean!”
Malfoy nods. “Yeah, they were sloppy and I was able to get a trace on one of the wands used to curse the victim. I’ve sent the data off to be analysed. As soon as Records has a match, they’ll let us all know.”
“So, Draco,” Hermione starts after Harry’s able to look up from his plate. “Ron said you were helping him with a cursed item? He wouldn’t give me too many details.”
,” Draco gasped.
“No,” Harry said with a grin. “He’s still mad that I moved into our flat instead of insisting you live here.”
“Shit,” he whispers.
“And don’t let him swim for…” Luna looked at Ginny in question. “An hour?”
“That was also horrible.”
”. They’re left in the dark, listening to each other breathe.
He was going to see Luna at an event, late on Sunday, and he wanted to ask her what she thought about the idea. Blaise and Pansy always had been supportive of Weather-Be's, but Draco felt like running most of his major decisions by Luna. There had always been something about Luna that separated her from most people, and Draco found the older he got, the more he appreciated her unique take on things.
They shuffled across the battlement, Ron dragging Harry as Hermione cast charms to try and hide them all. “I’ll need a sword,” Harry whispered.
“No,” Harry said, gently. “I’d like to take you out, like on a date.”
Albus comes to pull Scorpius away, letting them both know that the train’s boarding and that if they want to make sure to get seats together, they need to go.
“Don’t sniff me
you?” he asked, stalking to the door.
“You—” Harry starts. “How?” Then, after a pause while Harry looks at Oliver Wood’s arse and has to internally agree that it is a very nice bum, he asks, “Is this a common occurrence for you?”
Apparition and shrinking charms meant he was able to meet and transport everything with ease. In fact, the one trip he hadn’t Apparated to had only been a few kilometres away so it hadn’t taken long at all. The woman who sold the goat cheese was concerned with how he was going to get all of the new goods to the shop, but Draco had reassured her that Emily would be by to pick him up and take everything back to the store.
“Will you survive, light of my life?” Harry asks in what is surely supposed to be an innocent tone.
“It was an accident.”
Harry just laughed at him again.
"I don't suppose you're planning on letting me go?" he asked the man in black.
“We can go to the Town Hall,” Draco suggested. “My mother is usually there and Robert doesn't understand personal boundaries in conversation.”
“I’m not surprised you failed,” Bellatrix said, cruelly. “After all, your father was a muggle so you were born with a clear disadvantage.” Bellatrix sent a curse at Hermione, wounding her in her right shoulder. Hermione still scrambled to advance. Laughing, Bellatrix fired off a second curse at Hermione’s left shoulder.
“That’s moving very quickly,” Draco says as he makes his way to the door.
Professor McGonagall had asked him to come to consult with the staff about the feasibility of starting an LGBTQ+ club. Coincidentally, the house elves had planned a big picnic on the grounds after his meeting. Something about a ‘back to school event’ since the fall term had started only a week prior. Everything had been sunny and clear when Harry had first arrived. From the staff room, Harry had watched some big fluffy clouds pass by and he’d been looking forward to spending the afternoon outside. But as soon he was a few metres past the entrance, the sky had turned dark and then he and most of the students and staff of Hogwarts were soaked.
“Didn’t quite catch that.”
She pushes him towards Lovegood a little, her eyes sad, and Draco has to obey her.
!” Potter insisted.
Harry lay there with a defiant look on his face, completely at odds with the blush that was staining his cheeks and ears.
“Well, you brought me cake,” Harry reminds him.
“At least I haven’t fallen in a shower,” Draco counters.
“You know, we’ll get warmer faster by sharing body heat,” Draco said as if that was something reasonable people said to their flatmates in the middle of the night.
Well, Draco thinks, she was a bit sleazy in her offer, but she’s still allowing Scorpius to spend a couple of nights away, giving Draco and Harry some time alone.
Harry laughed. “I mean, the how is pretty self-explanatory.” Shrugging, he continued, “It was a few years ago, I went out with some Muggle friends to a
“Full,” Harry said back. “And a little sore, but not too much.”
He’s cut off when Harry reaches down and grabs his prick with the hand that’s still slightly wet from lube. Draco loses his breath for a second, but soon enough he’s pushing up into Harry’s hand and back onto Harry’s cock and he’s stuck in a perpetual motion machine of his own making.
Harry laughed and Draco could feel the way it made his entire body move. “Emily said you would hate them,” he admitted.
“Mother and I moved around the continent, living off Father’s money until the Ministry took it all and we had to move here because they didn’t want a Muggle building. Apparently, some distant relation bought the building as a wedding present. They weren’t fans of my parents. Obviously.”
Ferret to you, Weasel.”
He flexes his arms,
“You’re not exactly helping,” Draco said with a grimace. “You’re supposed to be helping.”
With his best fake sigh, Draco said, “I suppose not. But only if you let
“You know exactly what I said, Ronald.”
but—” Draco smiled. “It’s fine in moderation, I suppose.”
“I swear, this has never happened before, Blaise! I have the maths to back—”
“All of the Weasleys are competent, ” she had said. Then she’d taken another deep drink from her glass of wine and looked Harry right in the eye. “Malfoy—”
Leaning down to kiss Harry, Draco says into his mouth, “Don’t do it like that, you look ill,” and then he slips Harry some tongue. Harry shrieks internally and Draco pulls back.
Ron put the brooms down and pulled out his wand. “I can help you get down!”
we can go back to my flat.” Draco paused, looked at the townspeople again, turned back to Potter. “Before you say anything, I share the flat with my mother and it’s very small and it’s only one room.”
“Too early,” Harry grumbles.
“Git!” Harry says.
“I’m still interested,” Draco said. “Did I kill the mood?”
Hermione let out a little hum of agreement. “How long do we need to wait before we can give it to him?”
“It’s the receipt of our first sale,” Harry explained. “It’s stupid. I just thought. Well, nevermind. It’s nothing. Let’s order some drinks and—”
“I feel like I’m going to throw up and my head is going to explode. One after the other.”
the smug grin in Harry’s voice.
“I’m sorry, but my son and I are a topic of conversation between you, Granger, and Weasley?” Draco couldn’t keep the incredulity from his voice.
“These gingers are your in-laws,” Harry’s ex-wife and the mother of his children said, seemingly coming from nowhere.
“So you invite me over to insult me?” he asked as he finally reached the kitchen. He watched in delight as Hermione smacked Harry in the arm.
come with a plan,” Draco says, a little impressed at his usually fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants husband. He stops talking at Harry’s hot look.
Draco frowned even harder. “I don’t think that will be necessary.” Then he smiled. “My mother’s flat.”
“I take it back!” Ron shouts. “Don’t bring my mum into it!”
“Ah, so the way to Harry Potter’s heart is through sweets,” Draco drawls. “And the part where you could only look at my shoes?”
Harry’s eyes got soft at that. “You’re really sweet when you don’t mean to be, aren’t you?” he asked.
“Just to sleep, Malfoy,” Harry repeats.
“That can’t be correct!” Harry insisted.
Draco frowned and laid his head on top of Emily’s. “I hate him,” he insisted weakly.
Harry’s still coming to terms with being 40, so he gets a little sozzled at her party.
Draco’s starting to get hard against Harry’s leg, and Harry’s more hard than not when they start to grind against each other. Everything is slick and hot and it feels like
“You know!” Draco insists. “
Harry lets out a deep sigh. “I think so?” He looks around the house, avoiding Ron’s eyes. “He’s not taking it well, the curses being directed at kids and then it being his aunt who cursed everything.”
Several days later, Emily was back to talking about Draco’s store.
Harry turns to watch him. Malfoy pauses at one of Harry and Rose; Harry’s got her on his shoulders and he’s pretending to be a broom while she shouts, “Fwy! Fwy!” in her little voice.

case," Ron had waggled his eyebrows, "of Harry's missing heart") and Malfoy works a few cases with other Auror teams.

make the drinks.”
“What are you doing with Mr Malfoy?”
“You kicked me in the head!” Harry hisses back, holding the ear that Draco had knocked his boney knee into only seconds before.
“Oh, well if that’s the case.” Draco leaned back down to kiss him again, making sure to keep his kisses small and teasing. “I’m happy to just kiss you, but if there’s something you wanted to try…”
Harry laughed. “What’s zhampagne?”
But Draco’s main objection to the sign was the fact that it proclaimed, in
Hermione looks at Harry again, but Ron has hit his stride and Harry knows even
“She’s getting away!” Hermione screeched. “Please, Ron!”
Ginny lets out a little laugh and grabs Draco’s pint, taking a long drink. She gives it back with a little flourish.
Harry had tried to glare but he’d been so amused, he couldn’t keep his smile in. Silly things, stuff that should be
“You’re very drunk,” Harry said, stifling his laughter into Draco’s neck. He kissed the side, just under Draco’s left ear and Draco couldn’t keep back his shiver.
A popping noise sounded behind them and suddenly the hem of Draco’s robes were on fire. Harry grabbed his wand and muttered
Hermione scowled. “Fine. It’s just that my boss says—”
. Then, in slightly smaller font:
“You’re going to have the worst headache,” Harry chimed in.
With a solemn nod, Voldie picked up a piece of parchment and a quill. “Write your letter and give it to Bellatrix. She will see it delivered to the owlery. My dear, if he accepts your proposal, I will be the first in line to congratulate you both. However—” Voldie frowned— “I would ask, on the slight chance he refuses, that you would consider me as an alternative to death.“
“Sex is a very serious business, Potter. I won’t have you giggling.”
“Will you be OK?”
“Neither of those were our finest moments, were they?”
After they’ve both stopped, Harry says, “You’re good with your son and your mum.”
The next time Harry sees Malfoy, he’s confident he’ll be able to speak like a normal person. He’s seen Flora in the interim. He had confessed to her that usually, he doesn’t have a hard time talking to hot guys, that he can mostly look them in the eyes even, but for some reason, Draco Malfoy proves to be the exception. She'd given him a few exercises to help calm his anxiety and Harry was cautiously optimistic.
Forcing a smile, Draco waved at the people he had grown up with, who were to be his
Draco could hear Granger’s, Hermione’s—damn all the use of proper names—groaning laugh and he fought to keep his face impassive.
“Yes, lovely to see you, Harry,” she said. The door slammed behind her.
“It’s nothing,” Harry insisted, sitting down next to Emily. “Draco. It’s really…” he trailed off but didn’t object when Emily handed it to Draco.
“You’ve been mostly dead all day,” Ron explained.
Draco grabs the box and puts it on the coffee table, not bothering to grab plates or cutlery.  Harry follows him to the sofa and they both sit. Draco grabs a slice and moans at the first bite, clearly hungry. They’re both quiet as they eat and suddenly the box is empty.
Owling Draco Malfoy was something Harry hadn’t ever anticipated doing. However, under the watchful eyes of his best friends, he was now doing that very thing.
Ron powers on. “One could even suggest the ending left you feeling… flaccid.”
He waved his wand and muttered under his breath. Casting spell after spell, Draco didn’t let his mind or eyes wander until he found what he was looking for.
Harry smiled again. “Well, there you go!” he exclaimed happily. “No ‘I do’, no marriage.” Then, in a cooler voice, Harry turned and looked at the doorway. “Wouldn’t you agree,
He parked by the inn and they walked over to the Town Hall. As expected, Draco’s mother was there.
“We’re not keeping it,” Draco reiterates.
“I’m too old to walk around in my socks,” she says with a soft smile.
“Hermione,” Ron says.
“All of the owls except your best,” Draco repeated. “The owl that you sent to Harry…” he trailed off in understanding. “Oh,” he said matter-of-factly. “You didn’t send…” Sighing, he straightened his shoulders. “It hardly matters. My Harry will come for me.”
Then there were the Weasleys. They had
Half an hour into the movie, there’s a knock on the door and Harry gets up to pay for their food. Bringing it to the coffee table, he settles himself back down into his comfortable sofa and nudges Draco with his shoulder.
“Well if Granger and Weasley approve,” Draco says, pushing past Harry to open the door, “then I suppose it can’t be too dreadful. No matter how badly it’s named.”
"Can't have that," Draco said.
“He didn’t fall,” she replied. “In fact—” she paused to look down— “he’s still climbing.”
“We’re going in together,” Draco says. “I don’t trust you to Floo home alone.” He pulls Harry close as he steps into the green fire, and suddenly, they’re in their flat.
He had found the various bobble heads that were based on movie and television show characters.
in the past.”
She was pacing and muttering to herself, working herself up into a proper fit.
“Please,” he begs.
“Sure,” Draco agrees, distracted. “I’ll need to get these back to my lab to see if I can get anymore information about who would be leaving these things.”
“Well, now that you’ve put that picture in my head, you’re not going anywhere near my bathroom while Malfoy is over.”
“There’s got to be more to your story,” Draco said.
with the other things in that game where they all wear white and have tea.”
“Fuck Harry,” he says in a rough voice. “I know I’ve seen you just in your pants, but
Harry Floos to his flat and seconds later Draco joins him. He lets Draco pick a DVD while he goes to call in their order in his kitchen. When he returns to the lounge he can hear Draco singing while looking at the shelves of movies.
“He’s at the Ministry this morning to let them know he’ll be unavailable for contracts for the near future and then he’s coming back to the Hamlet so we can start planning things.”
Ron thumps him on the back and whispers, “He’s lucky to have you in his corner.”
“It’s like breaking up a couple of feral cats,” Ron said with a glint in his eye.
“Harry!” Draco cried again and put the top back on the poison, gently laid it down, and rushed to Harry’s side. He clambered on top of Harry and started covering his face with kisses. Harry kissed back when he was able, but still didn’t move.
“Yes!” Bellatrix shrieked.
Draco shuddered.
Draco unlocked the door with his antique key and discreetly disarmed the wards. Harry followed him into the store. They shut the door and stood by it, shoulder to shoulder, looking at the mess from the day before. Harry shrugged off his blazer and hung it on the coat stand that was by the door.
Harry gave her an appraising look. “You and Ron seem to be hitting it off. How do you feel about piracy? You would make a dashing Dread Pirate Black and Ron would be an excellent first mate.”
“You feel really good,” he said, leaning down to kiss Harry. Gently, as gently as he could be, he rocked his hips until half of his prick was inside Harry. “Really good,” he repeated against Harry’s mouth. “How do you feel?”
“Gently,” Harry gritted out as Draco lifted his head to pepper more kisses on him.
guy.”
He scrabbles for his wand and casts, grimacing at the stretch and dual tingle of a cleaning and protection charm.
“This is all a dream,” Draco whispers.
“So what kind of food do you like?” Harry asked, squeaking at the end of his question.
Bracing himself on his elbows, Draco started with little, gentle, thrusts, barely moving his hips, just a hint of friction. He did that for half a minute before he started rolling his hips and deepening the thrusts. Harry’s arse squeezed around him every time he pulled out and it was the most divine thing Draco’d ever felt. Without conscious thought, Draco started pulling almost all the way out, snapping his hip harder than he meant.
“Malfoy was there,” Harry admitted.
There was a loud noise from the television and they quit talking to watch.
“I think he could be good for you,” Emily answered. “For the store, I mean. You told me yourself that he saved everyone during the Wizarding War and he apparently has enough money to provide half of the start-up funds. He’ll be able to lure customers in
Bowing, the Dread Pirate Black smirked at Draco. “At your service.”
“PB must have snuck out when you were meeting with Scorpius,” Harry says, putting together a loose timeline.
which, 'Mione and I have realised is your type." Ron takes a loud slurp of his tea then lets out a sigh. "You know he comes by the house to ask 'Mione for help?"
“I brought tea and pastries!” Emily shouted.
"Too fast?" Harry asks.
Harry shrugged. “I met someone who was looking for you.”
“What?”
“Potter’s right,” Malfoy agrees. “I grew up in a bloody manor filled with dark and cursed objects and I can’t look it in the eye.”
Bringing himself back to the fact that it's half six and he is expected at Ron’s at seven and Harry has yet to shower or dress, he panics a little. Throwing off his work clothes, Harry jumps in his shower before it is warm enough and lets out a little shriek.
“Harry?” Draco scoffed. “When did the two of you become mates?”
“This and that,” he answered. “Cleaned up Grimmauld Place, helped Ron and Hermione out a bit. Mostly I volunteer now.”
“He’s always been like that,” Potter agreed.
After they had gotten their giggles under control, they got back in Emily’s car to drive back into town.
Draco held out his hand and Potter put the tea in it. He rolled so his face was still a little bit under his pillow and sniffed the tea.
“Does everybody know what, Potter?” Malfoy asks as
“OK, OK!” Draco said.
His smart arse comment is cut short as Harry hits Draco in the face with his pillow. Bob lets out a little yowl and jumps out of the bed.
sign over his head. He's looking at one of his bookshelves and Harry can see a small tremor running along his shoulders.
“To the sign,” Harry agreed, turning around.
“Who are you?” Harry asked. “Are we enemies? Why are we on this wall? What’s going on? Where is Draco?”
Harry nodded and Hermione threw the invisibility cloak over Ron, making him completely disappear and Hermione started a cold, blue flame in the space Ron had just occupied. Ron cast his voice to the flame. “The Dread Pirate Black is here for your
“Where is Harry?” Draco asked.
painful sensations will become too much soon.
“Draco, must we be so formal? You’re free to call me Minerva.”
Harry grimaces. That was his main objection as well. That and the fact that his kids only want Molly’s seven step sauce that takes close to two hours to make. It’s simple, but incredibly time consuming.
“There’s not much to see.” Draco groaned. “You’ve seen the best part.”
“That’s what I said!” Harry said with a smile.
gay.”
Harry motioned to the kitchenette. “We did set this up so that almost everything runs on magic, but it looks like Muggle technology.” He pointed at the kettle on the hob then the small cupboard in the corner. “Pansy found a place that sells your favourite blend of tea and she and Gin sent over enough to fill your cupboard.”
Straightening his shoulders, Harry looked at Draco in the eye. “I find you very attractive,” he said.
“Why did you buy it then?”
“Draco!” Harry sounds scared. “Are you OK? Did I hurt you? I’m so sorry!”
Harry looks over to see what Draco has ordered and is pleased to see he has also ordered the meatballs. Silence falls as they start eating and Harry has trouble keeping his eyes off of Draco.
ago.”
“Rose loves that bloody murder doll. Can’t get her to part from it. It’s only fair. Do you want to send a message to Malfoy, or should I?"
“It’s too tight!” Harry proclaims. “The buttons barely fasten around my chest and the sleeves are too short! Who buys a shirt with sleeves that short? Who
or you
“Harry!” he exclaims. “That was great! He flirted back with you this time!”
Luna giggles. “He is a ginger,” she says with a big smile. “Which makes him an honorary Weasley.”
“I don’t think you understand, Harry.”
“One, we all want you and Ginny to be happy, so I’m glad you’re both so supportive of each other. And two, did you just sniff my hair?”
“Answer the question,” she ordered.
Harry cut him off with a laugh. Draco smirked back at him and Harry took a second to really look at Draco. He was smiling back at Harry, his eyes reflecting the flicker of the fire, his hair slightly staticky from the dry air, and the fondest expression on his face.
“‘Ow are you so pretty?” he slurs to Draco.
Draco heard a rush of air and he was covered in a Cooling Charm. He let out a yawn and settled back into his bed, straightening his sheets and pulling up his duvet.
“It is!” Harry insists. “You’ve saved our arses so many times since we all graduated from Hogwarts. It’s not your fault your aunt was basically evil incarnate.”
“We’ve been hired to kidnap the prince and start a war with Surrey. When Prince Voldie finds his fiancé’s broom and part of a robe from a royal guard of Surrey, he will know the prince has been taken. When we dump the body—”
“Gorgeous,” he murmurs, stepping back into Draco’s space and pressing their now bare chests together.
“Don’t let it go to your head, Potty,” Draco snarked.
An early International Portkey meant that they were both worn out after arrival and they had decided on a nap. An hour later, Harry’s refreshed but still feels a bit manky from travel.
“That would be nice,” Draco said. “I hear the food at the Blue Moon Café is moderately edible.”
And honestly, Draco was a former Death Eater, his family had been at the forefront of Voldemort’s dark regime, and the Malfoy name had been synonymous with sinister happenings. So, if quite possibly the most twee person in the wizarding world had been supportive of said business and had suggested something silly to drive business, Draco was astute enough to take her advice.
Draco glared at him. “Retiring,” he said.
Hermione is the first one of them to turn 41.
“Will he not do your room?” Draco asked.
“It gets better,” someone else says from the corner.
Luna gave her a loony smile and started running around the table chanting, “Voldie, Voldie, Voldie, Voldie, Voldie, Voldie,” until Ginny covered her ears and shouted, “Fine! Maybe he
“He’s not a person, Draco.” Harry’s tone is tempered by the kiss he gives Draco.
“I want to see your face though.”
“Do you want me to use magic to get you ready? Or the Muggle way?” Draco paused. It had been a while since he’d slept with a Wizard. “Or a combination of both.”
“It’s a little cool outside but we can bring out a space heater if you need it,” she said as they followed her to a small courtyard with wrought iron tables and chairs. Against the building, there was a table set for two with several candles burning bright.
They sit together, the silence only broken by Harry’s fork clinking on his plate as he finishes his cake. When he’s done, he smiles at Draco.
“He is good at his job, Duckie.”
“It’s exciting,” Harry said.
Harry’s pulled from his musing about competence (and how
“But you have to admit you’ve changed a lot in ten years.”
“Ah,” Draco says. His ears turn pink again. “Have I made it weird?”
Harry lets his head drop to his desk with a loud
“No!” Draco shouted again. “Harry bloody Potter is the reason it rains!”
Draco closed his eyes and counted to five. Then he admitted to himself that he had officially lost the battle of what to call his business.
The next day at The Burrow, Harry was sat on the couch with Molly, sipping his tea. Arthur was in the corner reading
“‘M just really happy,” Draco says.
“We really can stop—”
“Say husband and husband!” Voldie demanded again.
They both stood in silence as they took in the sign. It was a pretty normal sign, burgundy with black posts and gold writing. Even the cricket balls and bats weren’t so horrible, considering the Hamlet had been named by a cricket enthusiast.
“You’re calling me ‘Harry’,” Harry said. “And calling it
