Trocar reappeared frowning in thought, "It was, but there's probably a good reason. What does Mr. Weasley do for a living? … and what's a Scabbers?" He asked recognizing the names Harry told him about and effectively figuring out who the wizard was without much difficulty.
“all of the above and then some” Harry groaned as he went into the kitchen to make some tea.
"Let's hurry. I'm hungry!" Ron grumbled as he patted the rat.
Draco wrapped his arms and legs around Harry tightly as he felt the slow thrusts pick up speed, "Ahhhh hahhhah! So so g-good! Harry! Harry I-I I'm ahh! Harry!" Draco screamed even louder as a very sensitive spot deep in him was slammed into by that hard cock. Harry readjusted to hit that spot every time. Soon both lovers came together and curled up in bed holding each other ...
What if Dumbledore gets his mind controlling spells on him again?
The potion master hummed in agreement as he sipped his tea “indeed however something reasons may differ. My concern has more to do with the controlling spells and the idiots Granger and Weasley. I despise having that know it all in my class”

“I’m speaking”
With quick graceful strokes of a brush the potion master applied the potion to the parchment. The secretly green eyed wizard saw the professor’s eyes narrow as words formed revealing spells he never expected. Severus still didn’t make the connection as he instructed Cache on which potions to make. The apprentice had to brew each of the three potions needed by himself because Severus might sabotage himself. The spells on him could make him destroy ingredients and perhaps fight taking the potion. Cache, however, was ready and prepared the potions.
Harry blushed at the kind tone and slowly reach back under the bed and pulled out the stuffed wolf. While clinging to the wolf as if someone may take it away he stood next to Brian although it was just out of the headmaster’s reach …
“yes, Daggerfang is coming with the records” Brian said and he raised an eyebrow, like everyone there, when the minister showed that the name was in crisp black ink, instead of the grayed out version it should be, as if claiming Harry Potter was never adopted “that’s not right”
“that we both agree on. I will do what I can to help Mr. Longbottom. Hopefully he can see passed my deplorable behavior last year and trust me enough to talk to me about what’s going on so I can help”
Harry snorted, the old fool must’ve done that before he left the infirmary and then worded that little speech before the house cup was awarded so he didn’t suspect anything like a disconnect involving two different stories “I see … I believe it was, but I don’t know how”
Cache blinked “really? Why’s that?” why would Ollivander give him a wand that wouldn’t work for him? wait … Voldemort has the brother wand to his. That what Ollivander said … symbolism maybe? … but he stopped the dark lord so why give him the one wand that can’t kill him? Harry shook the thoughts away … he was getting a headache trying to figure it out …
“the muggles he was abandoned with at one years old … Death Eaters would be sickened by what that child suffered through before Brian found and blood adopted him” Severus said simply not going into any further detail.
In the morning Severus walked into the Great hall and was immediately confronted by Minerva “what’s this rumor going around about you getting married?” she asked and she would clearly be a little hurt that Severus wouldn’t tell her personally if it turned out the rumors were true.
Once the boy took hold a powerful warmth filled the room. Cache couldn’t resist closing his eyes at the feeling completely unaware of the old wizard’s awestruck look as the withered flowers in the window came back to life and bloomed. After the feeling calmed down he gently set he wand down.
“sorry Albus. I was brewing and then I was needed at Gringotts to assist with an adoption. I didn’t get your owl until a moment ago. What do you need?” Severus asked getting the feeling the old wizard was mad that he wasn’t at his beck and call.
One after one people gave it a shot. It turns out the leeches were really pickled Deadly Snare. The spider webs were fibers from deep in the Whomping Willow. The black beetle powder was really dark seashell powder. The lionfish spikes were actually the pointy hairs from an acromantula’s back. The dragon blood was aged sap from the mistletoe plant and finally the mandrake was really shriveled bat wings. Though she got them all wrong at least Hermione is learning something, but she didn’t seem to see it that way and seemed to be sulking …
"There ... is?" Hermione commented strangely stunned for someone who should've been told these things before she came to Hogwarts. Perhaps Dumbledore neglected to tell her some things …
"Ms. Granger … I was hoping you'd come to your senses." Gritmace sneered before leading them away.
Quirrell chuckled as he crouched down to the boy’s eye level “I’d be happy to help. What’s their name?” he asked not realizing that Julian was using Voldemort’s interest and distain for one Harry Potter to get closer.
“yes, but we can’t do that to the students” Poppy hissed. She knew Severus was kidding, but she still didn’t like the reminder.
Lucius wanted to race to his son too, but he knew rushing could make things worse and they can't risk their son's lives, "I know you're worried about your kids, Arthur. I am as well, but you need to calm down or you'll make a mistake you'll regret.
Daggerfang sneered, "Impressive magic. It's rare for people to connect with their magic so soon after getting their body back, though this bond is mostly likely what aided in his soul shattering in the first place." The goblin said grimly as he watched the teen blindly cuddle close and cling to Julian. "It seems he hasn't regained control of his senses yet or his memories either I suspect." He mused as the healers behind him casually moved passed him as Brian returned to his human form.
“the White party I presume” said the brown goblin wearing a suit that came over to them as they recovered from the elevator ride. Brian simply nodded as he comforted Julian who shaking a little “very good, I am Daggerfang, the goblin now managing the Potter accounts and assisting Bloodbarrel with the binding removal. Please follow me” the three adults and child followed the goblin to the room where they will remove the bindings. Waiting there in the stone room was a red goblin that Brian knew because this goblin handled the White vaults “now Julian you see this circle carved in the floor? We’re going to have you sit in the middle and we’ll put a numbing spell on you. Tell us if feel anything”
“my apartment is on the top floor” Cache stated as he looked at the vampires and werewolves on every single floor. Six were in the sitting room. Armel and Maria were on the second floor seemingly chatting about something. A few werewolves were helping Sanguini update the wards and charms in the complex on the third floor. On the fourth floor was now Frank and Trocar arguing about something. It didn’t take a genius to see that they were watching out for him. There wasn’t any sign of Greyback, but the Alpha was hunted by the ministry so he had to be careful. He did a great job protecting his pack so no one knows who they are, but he was in danger if the wrong person saw him.
The blonde Potter scanned the displays as he wondered why no one let him get a holster before. Dragon hide sounded good, but it was expensive compared to the other. Two holsters would take nearly all of his budget. On the other hand the bank will resupply him in a week and dragon hide lasts a long time. In the end he took a calf holster and a shoulder holster.
If Dumbledore could read Severus’s thoughts he would be ducking for cover and fleeing for his life. Furious didn’t even begin to describe how Severus felt right now. Brian told him everything. How Petunia, the one person Harry Potter should never have been allowed near, somehow got custody of him. How the Dursleys were being paid to hurt him and were ordered to by Dumbledore. How some squib was being paid to watch Harry and keep him in the dark about magic. Yes, he knew it all and Brian even let the potion master use Legilimens to see inside the Australian headmaster’s mind so he knew it was true.
I'm thinking)
The Malfoy smirked as his jackal stretched out on the bench he and Julian were on before “don’t hurt them too badly” he said as he followed Julian right out the window. The shrieks of horror were heard behind them as they fell through the air. Tanzanite grew to his supposed full sized form and gracefully flew under the bridge the train was riding across to catch both the Legerdemain students.
“Bloody hell … maybe the Headmaster is guilty of something …” Someone said and a slew of whispers and rumors swirled around the room as the curious students.
As the train rolled to a stop he grabbed his things and Hedwig and followed everyone off the train “see you guys” he frowned when both his friend just waved over their shoulders without looking at him, but he instantly felt better when Neville smiled, waved and wished him a great summer. It wasn’t long before everyone was picked up by their parents or guardians, he was alone.
One tap, one incantation and they had their answer in the form a bright gray glow coming from the carrier … it worked! The tracking charm was stuck to the carrier! Now for Harry’s tracker …
“shh secret, danger” Alice said in a hushed voice before losing all her focus and began mumbling incoherently.
After tucking his trunk away in the cupboard and picked up the potion book he was using, but found nothing. Flipping through the pages revealed something else though … a reference to a book that has all the potions for reversing all the damage done by malnutrition!

Harry peeked out from his Daddy’s shirt “yes please” he turned to take the vial. Sophia uncorked it for him and didn’t let go until the tiny hands had a good grip. It wasn’t very tasty at all, but Harry noticed that most potions weren’t. However potions worked fast and were really effective. The pain relieving potion made him a big potion fan already and he couldn’t wait to start learning. After a second his eyes got blurry and removed his glasses.
"Normally yes, but not this time. Ring." She gave a 'hand it over' motion. He did only to deadpan when he saw her press it to a little hanging picture of St. Mungo's symbol. A picture, by the way, that he could have reached even easier than her. "Thanks! I always wanted to do that!" She grinned as gave the ring back and reached into the passage hidden behind the picture to pull out some papers. "Here are the amazing results- … you ok?" She asked when she realized Cache was staring at the picture.
“I don’t know” Cache sighed genuinely concerned “my professor is frighteningly observant when it doesn’t involve me. I don’t think he’s a push over either so tackling him would not go well, but if he doesn’t see for himself that it was his blood or hair used he will never believe it”
“yes of course” Dumbledore said and he began to fume inside as the blonde wizard walked away.
“yep … something about a prodigy apprentice healer that is approaching healer status faster than anyone” Trocar chuckled as Harry blushed modestly. Problem is the vampire only told part of the rumors. The other part was the ‘smoking hot apprentice healer whom everyone wants a sample of his bedside manners’ …like hell he’ll tell Harry that perverts are after him “oh, Harry you have an owl”
“wait … you were never told who Harry was with? Why? You’re really the only family he has. You should’ve been around him to care for him” Moody scowled at the werewolf who was pacing the hotel room that they charmed for privacy. At first he did consider telling Albus that they were here in the UK again, but as he pressed the werewolf for information he started questioning Albus’s story. Why wasn’t Remus more involved? Why didn’t he even know where Harry lived or who was taking care of him?
Snape was a professor at Hogwarts …
Exhaustion finally over came him. He laid down on the cot and fell into a deep sleep feeling more secure than he ever felt before …
“I want my cub.” Remus growled actually trying to use his wolf’s strength to recover from the stunner he was under and he was getting close to.
First Harry glanced at Trocar who was checking the wards securing the room “the founders went above and beyond to protect their professors’ privacy. It’s safe to talk here. There’s even a Censor ward like the Malfoys. You know they didn’t even know about it! I saw the sequence stepping right out the floo and told them if they wanted to prevent any slips, though I doubt they’re the types, then they have the both say your real name ten times. After that they must give the ward the order’ replace Harry with Cache’ … they didn’t believe me until they followed the instructions and your name started being magically replaced unless they turned off the ward with the ‘halt replace’ order. They had fun with that, but it was nothing compared to burning that ugly staff”
“I’m speaking”
As the young wizard watched the bird fly off towards the attic he was hit with a realization making everything truly sink in …
Libra moved off the red head and padded over to Cache as Percy all but dragged his youngest brother away. The two kneazles trying to cheer up Ginny and the kindness from the new healer made the twins take an instant liking to Cache. Even more so than their brother who was in deep trouble. In fact, as Cache tended to Ginny’s lip in the infirmary, Fred and George took out the parchment again, which turned out to be an enchanted map. At first they were going to look for Ron’s name, but their eyes widened as they saw the names floating around the infirmary. Instead of Cache standing next to Ginny it was Harry Potter!
Blaise smirked, "That gives me an entire train ride to discover how truthful you're both being."
Arthur nodded, "After some investigating it was found that Dumbledore was the one who helped my ex wife potion me." The goblins nodded and with that it was over. The humans were asked to leave, but as they left the Minister was heard reassuring Hermione that Lockhart was sentenced just last night. In fact, he mentioned that the details would be in today's paper. When they return for breakfast she can read up on it.
Narcissa came into the study just as Lucius sent an owl with the muggle newspaper to his friend in the Daily Prophet “found some more informa-” Narcissa was silenced when her husband came over and pulled her into a that was more passionate than any kiss in years “oh my, good news I take it” she smiled and leaned into her husband’s embrace.
Greg winced, "You're leaving?"
“Severus made the offer meaning he is responsible for handling the payment” the twins said in perfect sync as they held Severus close.
After hesitating for a moment Remus went first eagerly and Moody soon followed watching Geryback who was still pointing the wand at them. When they got through the first door they found the second door refused to open until the first closed, however, once that was done they went inside. The sound of screams made them panic, but they didn’t see the scene they expected. Much to their surprise they didn’t find a frenzy of vampires going for blood, but just standing there staring at them and the screams were from the injured werewolf and two people who must’ve gone into labor.
Aster frowned “maybe, maybe not. We won’t know for sure until he’s older. Lets continue the tour. Come on boys!” she called out before Lucius could ask what it was they were talking about.
“I think the castle is trying to tell me there’s a horcrux in this room” Julian exclaimed and started weaving through the towers of things to search for that horcrux that remained besides the main fragment, which was stuck in that one professor’s head. It was several minutes before he spotted something on a tall stack of books “found it! It’s up there!” he exclaimed as he pointed up to the top of the tower at something glittering. Before he could levitate it down Tanzanite snatched it in his jaws and flew down to Julian.
“what kind of activities do you have?” Narcissa asked.
Slashclaw nodded sharply, "Quite right. Minister Fudge, would you describe you passkey?"
“I don’t remember” Sirius said looking confused even though the truth potion was still effecting him and it was no surprise since the potion was able to bring out the truth eve if your memory was fuzzy. It would take a pensieve to confirm it, but it was clear that Sirius was obliviated at some point.
“it’s about time. We were starting to think you would never come. Follow me, Master Ironclaw will be joining soon” the goblin muttered as he escorted a stunned potion master to a private room.
Harry nodded “it’s not as scary as it looks”
“very well, we’d like a pensive memory of that entire day” Cornelius said and gestured for the aurors to administer the antidote and pull out a silvery memory that did show that a very clear blank spot from an obliviate was present when the Wizengamot members all watched it “you are cleared of all charges and we will overlook the lack of proper registration if you sign up now. Also you will be released into Remus Lupin’s care-”
Frank sighed and looked at the windows that were all sealed shut “of course you probably wouldn’t, but you can never be to sure. Many vampires fall into such traps because even though they only require blood to survive they also need shelter and certain things need money for that. Very few humans are rich upon being turned so vampires need to get money somehow. Runes are one of the very few things they can still do magic wise, but when entering someone’s home they’re at risk. All the home owner has to do is flood the room wit light to kill them. The few people who report it only do so because Gringotts had an account with that vampire and want to know what happened. Of course the home owner bitches, putting on an act claiming they were nearly killed and the aurors don’t bother looking passed that story cause they don’t care. Just another dark creature they don’t need to worry about. Maybe, just maybe, they will be saddened, but it’s only because they couldn’t kill us like they do in their ‘hunting games’. It’s one reason there are fewer and fewer of our kind every year … that and because know one wants to bring children into this world-”
After hearing what Aster had to say twin potion masters believed that a more powerful scar removing salve will be needed to help with the painful scars the little boy has. Since that point Sophia and Silvia have spent the entire tie brewing the potions to heal eyesight, remove scars, a potion for helping him regain the height he lost due to malnutrition and a different type of nutrition potion to help him gain some much needed weight. Today is the day the twins have finished the potions and first day they meet Harry. Stephen already informed them on Harry’s situation and she told them to call Brian’s cellphone first before visiting … Harry might not react well to someone sticking their face in burning embers to chat or seeing people burst into flames.
“But they’re so cute!” Trocar squealed dodging the werewolf getting an eye roll from Harry. This will take a while …
A massive crocodile …
When he made it up to the cell he saw the attic panel on the floor “oh right … I forgot that was left open” he remembered what happened when Vernon beat him before leaving. Hedwig clawed her way through the panel in an effort to help him. it didn’t even occur to him until now that she must’ve been getting to hunt through there … he shut all the other places after Lyra and Libra came to trust him.
“I’m speaking”
Wrapping the cloak around him made him vanish so he could slip out of the house and races over to Ms. Figg’s house completely unseen. She used to babysit him so he knew where it was. While quietly tiptoeing over to an open window he started to hear the two women chatting.
’ Tanzanite hissed from his perch around Julian’s neck not sure how else to describe what just happened.
“oh what?” Draco asked his mind still spinning from Harry’s comments about his eyes. Harrys was thinking of him all that time … something about that made his heart race.
The professor stared blankly at the bag …
“you could say that Neville” (more like desperate though) Harry thought. Since it was still early he tidied up his clothes, summer assignments and first year books before double checking that he had everything. As the silky texture of his invisibility cloak brushed soothingly against his cut thumb another question came to mind …
“he’s a headmaster so why should he not be?” Harry asked, his hunger forgotten.
I’m thinking)
“they know Severus” Cache said quietly.
Brian pulled his toasted sandwiches out of the oven and let them cool as he cut some fruit “the process is normally started by murdering someone, but it can be unintentional too. Young people who suffer a horrible loss or traumatic childhood or simply believe they killed someone can shatter their soul without them knowing. Well an abusive childhood isn’t enough otherwise you’d see far more instances of this, but it is normally seen in those people. After the split everything goes slowly down hill and they may accidentally make more even if they don’t want to”
“I’m sure it won’t be that bad- …” Stephen smiled sheepishly as Brian raised an eyebrow and stared blankly at him “I’ll try to talk to Silvia and Sophia before word gets around” he promised knowing that now they were both involved and the twins will take their wrath out on both of them. Aster is safe since after all no one can blame her for taking care of a child in such bad condition and keeping quiet about it, but they were going to get pranked in some way.
“where did he go?” the professor frowned as he noticed the blonde boy has disappeared … the boy interested him and worried him a great deal. The boy was brewing alone according to his body language and the boy seemed … terrified, desperate to be safe. Severus wanted to find the boy and help, but he’s going to have to find the boy first and with that in mind he heads down the street keeping a look out for the young wizard.

“I’m speaking”
For now he had to focus on getting to Gringotts. Once he went shopping then he could figure all this out. Sapphire eyes landed on the botched potion which was supposed to be for his skin color. He shrugged and grabbed another Q-tip, opened the vial with milky liquid, dipped one end in and held his hair back to dab the lightening bolt scar.
“that’s good to hear … and it explains why the Bloody Baron seemed so happy in the morning” Theo comment and shivered as he recalled the ghost’s slightly sadistic smile.
Blaise rolled his eyes “well you aren’t helping” he commented as he leaned back on the couch in the common room.
"A job slip?" Cache observed as he looked the slip over. "You both wish to work part time at Hogwarts during school and over breaks?"
"Well it wasn't perfect. It was reported that random teachers would be chosen to teach Harry Potter while he recovers instead of making go back to school-" A smirk came to Draco's lips. "They aren't random teachers, are they?"
“he is protective” Harry chuckled.
“of course’ Cache said and watched Severus’s robes billow as he walked away. what was Severus going to do? As he pondered that question he looked at the transfigured quill still in his hand and got an idea of his own …
Trocar looked worried as he entered the apartment, “Are you ok? Oh! Your eyes look so red!” He exclaimed the second he spotted the bloodshot green eyes.
“Damn brats!” Dumbledore muttered angrily as he entered his living quarters attached to his office and shut the door.
To everyone's shock the hexes suddenly stopped. The silence that followed was a little off and it prompted Harry to look over the side of the couch. He saw that Severus was frozen in shock. With a glance at Draco both Harry and Draco got up. Draco gently guided a dazed Severus into a seat as Harry got out his wand. One quick spell revealed that the potion master was, in fact, pregnant.
The idea was promising, but where will he keep his kneazles now? He needed a real home to run to. Either way this made Gringotts a big priority so he climbed down to the cot and went back to focusing on the potion for his disguise.

“We didn’t … the one responsible for that apparated away before your wolves came out.” Moody said as he looked for a chance to kill the werewolf who was a wanted criminal.
It made him happy that they had gained weight. Now they didn’t look so bad and their fluffy fur hid most of the signs, but they will be big. Both kneazles were close to his knees when standing, which made them far bigger than regular cats and actually their still growing. The both of them were small tigers under the fluffy fur and as they get up to their appropriate weight they will be something to watch out for.
“so we can ask you to do something right?” Ron asked.
“the floating part is perfect, now what did you do for making an object immovable?” Trocar ignored the potion master who was testing the shutter over the window or the full moon phase so it will close properly and filled the kneazles bowls with food.
The snowy white owl hooted angrily and hopped closer so Harry could pet her feathers, which offered a great comfort “I ran into Professor Snape” Hedwig flapped her wings in a huff “it’s ok girl, he didn’t even recognize me … he was … very kind actually … something is very strange there, he doesn’t strike me as someone who jumps to conclusions just very smart, but he did to me as Harry Potter. Even if he had something against my father he doesn’t seem like someone who’d hold the parents sins against the child … I think Snape has been lied to about my life”
With great care he ground the whiskers, poured them in a bowl and put them in the oven. Kneazle whiskers were used as binders for some potions, but weren’t considered all that special. It wasn’t enough whiskers, but a little toast might help like with the mandrake root.
XXXXXXXXXX
It was a heartbreaking decision actually, to not go back to Hogwarts. Harry wanted to continue his education, but he knew Dumbledore will keep forcing him back here and how will he keep up Cache’s lessons with Poppy at the same time as Harry’s regular classes or more importantly what will he do with his little kneazles? It wasn’t a good idea to try. He would get caught after too long. Maybe he could slip into Hogwarts as Poppy’s apprentice to put Snape’s things back.
Draco smirked “even Potter can’t tell Cache to leave. All professors are allowed to have an apprentice and have extra help if needed especially in the case of the infirmary. My father is on the school board so I know no one will force Cache away if Poppy feels more help is needed when caring for the students. Get over it”
Frank decided to go too, but he noticed Trocar watching the baby come out excitedly, “If you ever change your mind I’m here.” He whispered in Trocar’s ear, but his eyes widened as he saw a pretty shade of pink grace Trocar’s cheeks. “Trocar, you’re blushing.” He said more than a little confused since vampires shouldn’t be able to do that.
“no! How did he get a broom? How did this happen?! At this rate he’ll be across the- …” Albus smirked as he remembered something. There was no way an underage wizard can get passed the border without someone noticing. At least that’s what he believed. He headed back to his current home feeling very smug and waited to get a floo call from Fudge saying that Potter has attempted to escape.
“so he knows nothing … why would you let this treatment go on and why would Dumbledore want this?” Brian asked though he had a sick feeling this was a plot to take advantage of the child and turn him into a symbolic weapon. After all Harry Potter was ‘The Boy Who Lived’ if he recalled correctly … he rarely read the newspaper so he had to go and check …
"But people here already believed that because of the way your abuse got out in the first place and Gringotts did make a statement on that so it's obvious that you're connected to magical world more than muggle." Draco said pointedly.
The tingling from the wards made him stop and looked at the house “wait …there are no blood wards. Only very strong wards that will keep out those with ill intent … at least only magical people with ill intent. What kind of protection is that if Harry is beaten to death by his muggle relatives? What is this Dumbledore thinking? And to actually give someone those instructions to take care of a child … it’s disgusting … I’m not going back to explain to the Dursleys” he muttered and continued down the street until he spotted a house with nearly a dozen cats in plain view through the open window. He went over and knocked on the door …
“ok … did the goblins say anything about the directions? Cache said they had blueprints” Severus asked as he looked around the chamber for any way out.
“why is Harry being so open with his scars around Professor Prat?” Frank asked curiously.
Tom came back with a big plate full of food and two bowls filled with morsels “here you all go” the pub owner said as he set the plate in front of Cache and the bowls in front of the cute kneazles “so Cache where did you find these two?” Tom frowned as the blonde looked slightly nervous as he nibbled his eggs “you won’t get in trouble with me” he had a sick feeling the kneazles were suffering and the boy saved them.
"I have a cousin around my age. I don't know the exact details, but … well, obviously no one here would actually hurt a kid and Armel disappeared for a little while before what I think was the time the others …" Harry trailed off implying that he meant the demise of the adults. "There was a tiny hint of an orphanage and later on a tiny hint of an adoption. It wasn't mentioned directly, but …" Harry trailed off and shrugged. Nothing more was said, but Draco got the picture.
The apprentice did as instructed before going back to poor some tea “I read a book on moonlight in potion, but it only talks about how unstable it can become if too much or too little is involved … why is it always the full moon? Why not another phase?” he asked as he set the tea cups on the table and prepared Lyra and Libra’s food and water bowls.
The button with the tracker was popped off the school robe and the tracker was moved one last time … to his glasses!
“yes, that’s everything” said the dazed woman in a monotone voice.
Griphook scoffed, "A little late for that." Cornelius gave a short laugh reluctantly agreeing. "This we can tell you. Dumbledore knew before anyone else that Harry Potter got away from him. He used Remus Lupin and Alastor Moody, after telling them a false kidnapping story, to hunt Harry Potter down under the false impression of saving him. To help them he gave them a ministry level passkey that would get them through most legal and magical barriers, ministry and foreign ones. It was mainly for Remus Lupin who, as a werewolf, was restricted, but also the only one capable of finding him. A search that has also been taken on by Gringotts-"
Panic set in and it made Arthur break in1to a run. The Ministry employ wanted that bastard away from his son so badly that he grabbed the rat. With the rat in one hand and his wand in the other Arthur threw the rat hard while spelling the door to the chosen room open.
Since Ms. Figg’s home was much closer he went down to the squib’s home. He opened the door again even happier he didn’t bring Lyra and Libra along. A cat screeched as he stomped in the house flicking rain drops around, but it was ignored. Making his way to the fireplace he picked up the odd cat shaped jar and popped its head off revealing green powder inside … floo powder.
The Weasley lord sighed, "Normally you wouldn't be called in to talk and I wish that was the case, but Dumbledore can't speak and since you agreed-"
Once Sirius heard that the floo was going to be closed off he flipped out and lunged for the floo powder. They would’ve just put him in a body binding spell if it wasn’t for the fact that the floo powder fell all over him when Remus grabbed him again. With the floo powder everywhere it was actually dangerous to cast a spell on Sirius because of the floo powder. Only one grain of powder being hit with magic is enough to activate the powder and it could splinch Sirius who was in no condition to get that badly hurt. Remus and Megan had to restrain him without magic and without hurting his fragile body, which is why Remus looks the way he does since it was the werewolf took the brunt of his friend’s tantrum.
The disguised wizard gulped in fear. Did Snape see? Would Snape recognize him? … no, it was unlikely … he looked nothing like the ‘Harry Potter’ Snape knew and it didn’t matter if his scars were seen as long as it wasn’t the distinctive scar hidden on his forehead.
Poppy tapped her chin in thought as she looked around the lab shelves “hmmm … it looks like we’re low on Skele-gro. Lets have that be the potion of choice” she figured this boy will need some time to learn the recipe and get to that skill level to make that potion, but if he can complete that it would be a true testament of his skill. Severus was always saying that his seventh years couldn’t even be trusted brewing that one. The only potion he lets his older students try is blood replenishing and only as a demonstration for the first years.
“as interesting as Hogwarts was I feel it isn’t for me so I would like to continue training under you and Severus” Harry said sincerely.
Severus huffed sulkily “two points for running” he snapped before walking away from them.
Harry and his kneazles flooed home too, but Harry immediately ducked half expecting a hex to come flying at him … nothing happened. He looked up and sighed in relief “guess he went to his own apartment to sulk. He can be so moody” the fake blonde got to his feet and flopped onto the couch “maybe I should read this … it could take my mind off things” Harry muttered as he picked up the scroll he received on his birthday, the one he kept forgetting to read and opened it. With each line he seemed to get more and more pale and his hand unconsciously touched the spot where his hidden scar was …
“no!” Harry bolted upright in a panic. As he gaped for air he looked around in the early morning light he remembered where he was … the Dursleys guest bedroom. There was no Dumbledore … no Quirrell … no Voldemort … and no fire … it was only a nightmare.
Aster came back with a small bag “I have everything for a few days. This IV can go through the floo, but I’ll come to help. One spoonful of nutrition potion three times a day until he wakes then have him drink half a vial twice a day. I did two already so one more before nighttime and … Brian I am only a healer … I make people healthy, but you might want to consider a scar removal salve. Some of them look painful”
Cache blinked innocently “what did I do?” he exclaimed as Libra hopped onto his lap to cuddle and Lyra trotted over to Severus for a pet.
Severus scoffed not caring about the gory fate of the old wizard and looked at Harry, “I spoke to Poppy while at Hogwarts. I found her just as she was walking with the aurors who arrested Lockhart. She knows we’re busy, but we should stop by at dinner to see if a meeting will be set to discuss our missing staff members.” He said and Harry nodded as the wounded werewolf started carefully moving his reattached arm. It bled near the point of the slice, but Harry did a good job healing the nerves, muscles and vessels so he had function. at least, despite using only basic healing spells. A benefit to being a natural healer no doubt.
In mid gape Dumbledore froze. The goblin saw that it was 9:00 exactly and with each second that ticked by Dumbledore became a shade paler before finally breaking out into a nervous sweat.
Narcissa couldn’t stop her mouth from dropping in shock “2000! … but I thought it was a rare trait that only Salazar Sytherin and his descendants had”
Razorback’s eyes narrowed “why is a healer required?”
Gloria rose to the surface of the water just in time to see a huge dark blue occamy flying over head and riding on its back was an 11 year old green eyed wizard ‘
Harry chuckled, "And to think Greyback was so apologetic when Rosey and Sam accidentally rolled my quartz cauldron off the shelf and cracked it. We should be thanking him … and that only mini quartz cauldrons were in stock." He said and sighed. "This may seem odd, but maybe we should go muggle chemistry style for the next batch."
“what happened that night Voldemort attacked?” Cornelius asked ignoring the simpering from the members who feared the name of the dark lord who died years ago.
The false blonde smiled as he went to grab a red potion “it’s actually huge compared to anything I’ve had to live in … I don’t want to chance this so …” Cache glanced at Hedwig who was on the tallest perch. The owl nodded her deceitfully brown head say she had her flight for the day. With that Harry shut the shades on all the windows with one tap of the wards on the wall and ran the red counter potion through his hair and eyes.
“I don’t know who told you that, but it’s very unlikely that you are a natural healer” the witch said haughtily.
The blonde had no fear and didn’t find the vampire’s cold skin an issue …
“Then come in … though I doubt Harry will be happy to see you right now.” Greyback said surprising both of them.
“Oh, no you don’t! You’ve been through enough! First the basilisk, then your reaction to your dye! You won’t test it! I will if you have to know what it does!” Trocar said getting carried away and drinking the potion without even letting Harry explain what it was for first. Once Trocar set the empty vial down he realized exactly that. “umm … what was that potion-”
XXXXXXXXXX
“now, now love. Calm down” Sanguini purred as he kissed his way down Severus’s neck making the human under him squirm “don’t be mad at Cache. He just doesn’t want you to be in pain alone. I’ll make you forget any pain and don’t worry. Our mutual friend told me about the close call with my hickeys so I won’t leave hickeys on your neck this rime” he whispered huskily earning a shiver from Severus
“I don’t mind being around vampires or werewolves if that’s what you’re saying” Cache said politely “I just need to know if Kneazles are allowed and if there is a place for owls or if they can be kept in the rooms”
Remus finally nodded slowly after a minute feeling like he’d break down crying if he made any sudden movements “I … made those points, but he insisted and how could I argue with him after everything he did for me? Besides he said Harry was being cared for”
“I think that’s very true … that old goat was wrong” Cache muttered as he slowly pulled away from the vampire to start dinner.
“yeah Ginny said muggles had a belief about mistletoe, but she couldn’t remember what that was. Do you know?” Draco asked happy his godfather wasn’t around to witness this, but he wished Blaise would go away so they could talk alone.
The icy feeling of panic swept through the boy. Harry looked around at his sleeping roommates before quietly sneaking off to the bathroom. With a few splashes of cold water on his face he calmed down a little and sat down on a closed toilet.
Actually this was the first time he did this for himself. There was no point in doing this for himself since he always had very little money from his teacher’s salary. The only reason he knew the process so well is because he helped create vaults so they could get out of abusive situations. He has helped many kids, but … guilt was eating at him for not helping Harry sooner …
Blaise huffed, "Beyond borderline stalking Draco, that is."
Silvia looked just a heartbroken as her twin when they saw the scar and the skinny boy’s emaciated state “ok sweety, this won’t hurt at all” she said as Sophia pulled out a small bag from her pocket and very slowly made it grow in size so the boy was startled. Silvia was given a green jar by her twin and she opened it to show Harry the white cream in the inside “a little dab of our salve will help you feel much better. Is it ok if I put some on?” Harry peeked out shyly and he nodded again.
"Albus Dumbledore, the current headmaster of Hogwarts, correct?" Ruby asked and mused the thought when Remus nodded confirming her question. "I've read some odd things in your records. You and your teachers seemed to do a lot of covering up. You covered for your friends' like any child your age, but your teachers covered for them too in a disturbing show of favoritism including your former Headmaster. Tell me what you can about your past and as much as you can about Sirius. I want to be as informed as possible before I talk with him tomorrow … and try to recall any interactions with your Headmaster."
“two points to Gryffindor” Severus muttered grudgingly though he was quite proud in reality. He vowed he’d help Neville out of his shell and he will “there are several issues that can lead to a fatal or, in the best case, a simply failed potion. The most dangerous is mistaking one ingredient for another. The ingredients before you are in stages that are different then what you’re all used to. In fact you haven’t actually seen many of these outside a textbook because they only just arrived in my pantry today, but they have a striking similarity to things you worked with already or wasted” he said as he shot a glare at Ron who has had a history or destroying potions and therefore wasting ingredients just as bad as Harry was believed to have during the first year “Cache will open each jar and you will all get in line to get a closer look. Only Cache can handle the ingredients, but you can ask him cut or manipulate each item”
And somehow, they’d find each other again, in the wee hours of the night. Draco would ride Harry slowly, sinking down inch by inch with a bated breath and small throaty moans. He would take note of everything, from the hitch in Harry’s breath, the possessive way he gripped Draco’s thighs and repeated
Draco would rather have these weekends for all his life than not have Harry at all.
Draco forgot it all, forgot everything but this, this moment. He moved, lifted himself more before falling down, and Harry adjusted, hit the bundle of nerves inside him just right—enough that Draco yelped, threw himself further into Harry. Harry chucked, a deep and dangerous sound before he began pistoning at Draco’s prostate, swallowing his moans with filthy kisses, his tongue coating and tasting Draco’s. Harry’s pressed his forehead to Draco’s, his arm finding Draco’s bottom and lift onto his moving hips, and Draco gasped, sucked in lungfuls of air as Harry admired his bitten, swollen red lips and pounded into him. Draco arched his back at the harsh thrusts, abandoning all control from the look of fire in Harry’s eyes. It felt like Incendio was flowing over his body. He was taut and tight like a bow, Draco bent himself inwards until their chests touched and Harry still, relentless in his passion, delved in and out like the manic waves at sea until Draco was clutching at him and meeting his thrusts, chanting out
They landed with a thud in the middle of an expensive Turkish rug. Draco barely had the time to take in Harry’s London apartment before he was being thoroughly stripped of his clothing. Their fingers fumbled with each other’s, trying to get buttons open. Frustrated, Harry ripped the sheer top off. It slid neatly off Draco’s shoulders and just as he was about to protest, he cut off when Harry leaned down to take a nipple into mouth, his hands working Draco’s pants loose as he trailed kisses down the middle of his chest that left Draco feeling unhinged and tingly. Draco touched Harry’s shoulder lightly. Harry wrenched himself away, yanking his t-shirt off his head, pushing his pants off angrily, understanding their unspoken language. He came back up to kiss Draco once more now that he was only in his pants.The kiss was filthy, Harry's tongue caressed Draco's, moans erupted in the air, Draco's frame was shaking steadily from anticipation flooding his body. Then, Harry's mouth found the side of Draco's neck, right between his shoulder where ink bloomed. Harry kissed his way up, sucking, biting lightly at the head of the serpent that curled up Draco's right arm onto his neck. Draco groaned, craned his neck back, baring his throat for Harry. The assault left a trail of red, tiny spots that looked like flowers from afar. He was marking Draco, claiming what was his without him knowing.
“What’s a guy like you doing in a bar like this?” asked Harry, making the first move in the game they always played. The music was loud over his ears, fainter still than the beat of his heart.
Harry knew hunger, he looked at it in the mirror everyday.
“Yes!” said Draco, damn near tears now. He was so hard, so wet and open and ready for Harry. “Yours, Harry.
He leaned down to press a kiss to Harry’s chest. The arm under his head moved and when he looked up, Harry was gazing at him. Draco could see his calm, could see the adoration in his eyes that he swore was reflected in his own.
He had his demons and he played with them.
Harry knew, surely he knew by now. In answer, Harry kissed to Draco’s mouth, deeply, before pulling himself up and out of bed. He was walking away to the adjoined bathroom, naked as the day he was born. Draco curled the blanket around himself, closed his eyes just as he heard the sound of the shower turning on. Harry would return to his routine soon, he would go back to his life and so would Draco.
They played this game and they both lost everytime.
Draco’s hand gripped the hair at the back of Harry’s neck and pulled. Harry moaned low. “Why, Harry? What do you have that no one else does?” Harry’s hands trailed down to Draco’s arse, grabbing and kneading. Draco gasped hotly by his ear.
They barely made it out the door before Harry had it and turned once more, devouring Draco in a kiss he was expecting. They welded themselves against each other, two lost boys. And Draco was dizzy with it, with the way Harry kissed. It was like he did everything else, with the intensity of catching the Snitch everytime, with an effortless confidence, with restless power and so much passion that Draco's mind simply went blank every time. No thoughts, no thinking, just feeling, just Harry.
, Harry” until Harry was biting down on Draco’s neck, emptying himself with a groan, saying
Harry's body erupted in gooseflesh.
This was going to end in disaster. Harry was sure one day this whole thing was going to blow up in his face. But, fuck him if it didn’t feel good. Harry never felt like he was the best, he hated being called the Chosen One. He hated being called the Boy Who Lived. He hated the attention, the constant cameras, the papers, his job. He wanted normal, whatever that was. He found it wherever he could, whenever he could.
With shaky arms, Draco lifted his hands, pushing his face against the cool white wall to stabilize himself. He reached around, looking at Harry over his shoulder. He pulled his cheeks apart with his hands, opening his stance wider. Offering himself. And Harry, well he didn’t really have a choice. His world narrowed down to this point. He let out a broken moan, withdrew his finger and plunged in with three in total and Draco yelled, scrambled to the wall for purchase. He gasped wildly, trying to let oxygen back into his body but Harry was faster, more skilled. Draco was wet enough, he wasn’t lying. But his own finger could never match Harry, even when he touched himself the days they were apart, it was still Harry anyway. Wet squelching sounds filled the air as Harry scissored his fingers in, pulling and stretching the rim. Draco was loose now, his body slick from the lube he had used on himself before, to make it easier for Harry. The knowledge turned Harry on so much, his vision blacked out for a second. He squeezed the base of his own prick to curb his release. Shaking, Harry hooked his fingers up, hit that spot inside Draco that made him see stars. And Draco, wanton, pliable and open, took it all.
Harry was staring at Draco. Watching, waiting to find something he found. Want, perhaps. Sheer surrender. Longing, too. Then, without warning, Harry crashed his lips with Draco's with teeth and tongue, barely getting the incantation out before he slid in, to the hilt—hard and fast. Draco
“You know what. This is a game you will lose.” said Harry, sternly, standing himself, pushing Draco against the wood of the bar. He leaned over him, flicking his eyes from Draco's gray ones to his lips coated in something shiny and pink. Draco’s hands touched Harry’s side, rubbing circles under his ribs.
“Use your words,” said Harry, voice dark and heavy, his fingers massaging Draco's prostate. “I want to hear you say it.” Draco nodded, to lost to consider, too gone to think. He pressed into Harry’s fingers more, so close and yet so far. Draco just wanted him, wanted to be filled with Harry, wanted to wake up and feel it tommorrow. “Fuck me,” he chanted, mind blank. "F—fuck me, Harry.—
Draco accio’d his crumpled pack of fags, took one out and Harry lit it without a word with a simple wave of his hand. They knew the routine by now. They shared the cigarette. Draco took a drag, blew the smoke to Harry who captured it with a kiss from his swollen lips, saliva turning their faces wet. It felt seductive, raw, real. Their tongues were coated with the taste of nicotine and each other—sweet and smokey like the two of them.
And Harry was, Draco realized. Sweet, sickly sweet. Like everything that killed in the end.
, honey. You’re swallowing my fingers up.” he grunted, added “Like a slut,” and then his voice was at Draco’s ear. “A slut for me.” He bit at Draco’s ear roughly, enough to make Draco arch into him, “A slut for
The way Draco said filthy words, like he didn’t know they’d make Harry crazy. His tongue dripped honey, making a shiver pass down Harry’s back. Harry growled low in his throat, wound his hands around Draco’s hips and pulled him closer until he was standing in the circle of Harry’s legs.
It always felt like this. Electrifying. Glorious. Intense. Harry titled his head just right, pulling Draco up. He parted his lips expertly and Draco groaned, fisting his hands in Harry’s shirt. He pulled him impossibly closer, kissing him deeply. Draco's mouth tasted like alcohol and bitter coffee, his tongue mingled with Harry's and he felt desire pool low in his belly. Their tongues were dancing an ancient dance. It made Harry feel like he could conquer anything. Draco's kisses were like every winning duel Harry ever fought, like the first taste of treacle tart he ever had, like a shot of Felix Felicis.
He noticed a particular blond head hunched over the bar, nursing two fingers of whiskey over ice. Draco was dressed to the nines. Not Malfoy anymore, it hadn’t been Malfoy for a long time. Harry's eyes slid over Draco’s body like oil over water. He was wearing skin tight leather trousers that accentuated the perfect globes of his arse and a sheer gossamer blouse that left nothing to the imagination. Harry licked his lips, swallowing thickly. He made his way to him, already feeling turned on, feeling the heady effects of being this close to him.
Neville’s eyes widened as blond hair became soft wavy black hair, blue eyes became green and a lightening bolt shaped scar appeared on Cache’s forehead “you really went all out … this is serious, isn’t it?” Harry nodded silently as they both sat down “what’s going on?”
It wasn’t a point Lucius liked to remember, but Draco did have a valid reason for wanting to get involved so he relented “very well” they three Malfoys and Severus flooed into the bank and were allowed to go to Griphook’s office where they were surprised to see Cache sitting there as well “Cache? What are you doing here?”
“what’s he mad about? … besides the obvious” Poppy added sheepishly after all there was a lot to be mad about and much of it was Dumbledore’s fault.
“I’m glad I have you Hedwig … oh would you like me to get your cage?” he asked as he flicked on the light. The snowy owl shook its head and perched on Vernon’s favorite chair making herself right at home and munched on her treat “clever girl” he chuckled and settled back down to read.
The owl leaned over a little so he could take the letter. What the message revealed made his entire body sag in pure relief. Harry took it upon himself to tell him that the final horcrux was found and explained what was to be expected at ten o’clock. The worst chapter in their lives was finally over and Harry was responsible for it.
XXXXXXXXXX
Frank snorted “I am not a mutt and though this is only the third day we’ve been together I can tell you actually like me”
Just like before the boy took the wand and everything was enshrouded in warmth. David’s jaw dropped as his protective wards around his shop suddenly became much stronger.
“very well, it’s actually getting late for us anyway. Does this occamy have a name or family?” Brian asked as he son was still holding the occamy.
“what is your role with Harry Potter?” Brian asked cutting straight to the point.
Harry took a deep breath and went to answer. It was a very amused Maria and Armel. He went out with them for a couple minutes and came running back in.
It didn’t take long to get through the streets since most of the shops weren’t open. What Neville didn’t expect was that there was another wand shop other than Ollivander’s and it was a very different compared to what he heard from other students. There were no explosions for one. A kid said nearly every wand he touched destroyed something, but the owner of this place, David, only had him touch a glass orb so it can read his magic. The ribbons of blue and greens that whirled around in the sphere came as a pleasant surprise for Neville … he honestly didn’t expect to have enough magic for this orb to read …
XXXXXXXXXX
Maybe he shivered or something to show his distress because he was pulled into the vampire’s arms …
Brian sighed in amusement “our school starts later in the year so maybe”
The witch realized this wasn't a joke when two auror guards appeared out of nowhere from behind her, "YOU BASTARD!"
The young wizard sighed and went back to the kitchen, but it was too late … the potions were set.
Dark eyes settled on the boy with fake blonde hair and fake blue eyes “who?” Severus’s eyes narrowed as Harry all but threw a calming potion into his non-broken hand.
“a very good question” Moody mused out loud as he took the newspaper and folded it so he could tuck it under his arm “I think we should see what would happen if we left this in the Three Broomsticks” he said and grabbed Remus’s arm and apparated away. when they landed the retired auror removed the ‘notice me not’ spell.
Minerva looked absolutely baffled “Gringotts? Wha-”
It was believed that the Dursleys returned and panicked when they saw their prisoner was gone and basically ran away to avoid possible conviction. The newspaper went on to explain that the boy was underage, but they want to use his name and plead for him to come in to any police station for protection. Only three pictures were used. One was of the Dursleys. The second was of Ms. Figg who lived nearby and even went on the trip with the Dursley family. She disappeared around the same time as the Dursleys and seeing as the neighbors saw her babysit Harry it’s believed she was heavily involved in the abuse. The third picture, since they had no picture of Harry Potter, was of a hallway with a broken cell door laying on the floor and the word ‘FREE’ painted on the wall …
Harry smiled, "That was nice of you." He jumped slightly and rolled up his long sleeve revealing a tattoo of a wooden circular door surrounded by vines.
“correct” Cache exclaimed and Libra hopped up on her two back legs to take the chosen treat Cache gave her over to Draco. Again Blaise noticed a subtle, almost shy, reaction from his friend as he took the little jar of Bat Blood Soup from the kneazle “anyone else care to try the next?”
for Cache to learn of it and for the most part he was in the dark, but their change in behavior gave him a vague feeling that they were hiding something. He learned everything when a foolish werewolf got a screw in lodged in his jaw”
“night professor!” the twins said the password and the Fat Lady opened her door though she looked a little startled since she couldn’t see the student talking to her. Right after the twins disappeared behind the door Severus dropped the spell and let out an amused sigh as he heard all the portraits chattering about his personal business. Not that it mattered really. This is the last year he had too hide his life away from Dumbledore.
All the little wizard heard next was the sound of several locks clicking or sliding into place …
“hey Harry-ahh! What happened? Why is your shield up? Are you hurt?” Trocar yelped as he rushed over to Harry who absentmindedly canceled his shield. He didn’t even realize that the shutters and blackout shades closed when Trocar came in.
His eyes flew open to see what looked like the inside of an old stone gazebo covered in flowering vines “wicked … this must be my mental realm … now where is the core?” he walked out of the gazebo and walked through the surrounding forest “I bet my animagi is a forest animal … bloody hell” Harry winced as he saw broken stone buildings under fresh green moss and vines. It was obvious that the destruction was Dursley related, but the plants and butterflies fluttering around had to be a good sign, right?
“Remmy that bastard is trying to hurt Harry!” Sirius yelped as Brian dropped him making Sirius stumble and fall to the ground.
That’s right, Mike! A pregnant male! Imagine how shocked Hartry was to find out!
“yeah … whatever it was it fell on him too … hey Trocar can you get the towels over there?” Harry asked, but when the vampire turned to get the towels Harry hissed in pain …
“not brave?” Cache repeated blankly before leaning close to Neville and deciding to take a chance “someone one who gets a detention from Professor Snape, for something like say … bringing food in class, and then continues doing what got him the detention in the first place is actually very brave”
Trocar huffed “obviously” he said before vanishing in a blur with only the door flying open as the only sign where he went.
Frank finally calmed down and stared at the door where Harry was just a moment ago “he never asked what happened the other time … he knows”
left in his cell for him.
“that was our fault. If we checked for anything weird in the Dursleys’ blood before drinking from them perhaps we wouldn’t have gone … I don’t even know how to describe what happened to us” Maria pouted.
Thank Merlin for his growth spurt, it was all to easy to climb up to the attic space with the cot under him.
“that was close, but looks like Severus’s opinion of James Potter and telling him some tiny lies about Harry’s home life made Severus judgmental enough to assume things … if Severus ever learned the truth I would have to kill him. The boy has a big problem with abuse, but I need to mold Harry properly and it requires a bit of work … no matter. I doubt Harry will keep looking for help after being shut down so many times.”
“well Severus … you need to have a masters for at least three years in order to get access to two necessary regulated ingredients, but considering that will mean four years of students learning outdated facts, four years of you potentially ending up back in prison, which hurt Julian terribly, we have a proposal. We will brew you the potion you need” Silvia said sweetly.
Vincent nodded in a panic, "Please come with us to the infirmary-" Both Greg and Vincent looked shocked as Draco removed a necklace that had a Knut attached to it and threw it down the hall! What baffled the two Slytherins the most was what came next.
“yep, of course being in Gryffindor you couldn’t say any Slytherin’s name without everyone complaining so I never got an answer from them and I didn’t want to straight out say I was colorblind after … what happened when I tried to tell Severus” Harry felt a sting of guilt as he saw Severus flinch. They couldn’t change what happened, but there may be some more healing needed “anyway I spent the rest of the year thinking of your eyes” he said and noticed Draco’s cheeks darken … was he blushing? He couldn’t see red, but what else could it be? Sadly he didn’t have a chance to ponder on that thought …
Blaise snickered as the two scrambled to go get away “now Longbottom, how do you and Cache know each other?”
“I’m speaking”
XXXXXXXXXX
Greg looked frantic, "You don't understand! The other Death Eaters are going to be executed soon, which means they might take the Malfoys down with them!"
Being over 500 years old the vampire had knowledge on many things so he knew exactlywhat a horcrux was “oh … this is bad. You’re going to need the goblins!” Trocar raced to the door and opened it to yell “Frank get up here and bring your cloak!”
“you may not realize it, but my family owes you a great debt. It’s much more than being able to relax on a vacation. If something happens like an attack, we can get away safely and even my insane bloodthirsty aunt can’t find us” Draco said seriously as he looked up at Cache “you earned the Malfoy family’s trust and it is tradition to show that trust by allowing the heir to spend time alone with the person who is trusted. Even after we find a way to pay off the debt my family will always help you”
With the two happy kneazles at his side he went down to Severus' living quarters to floo home. When he opened the door he blushed lightly as he heard heated moans of a certain vampire landlord's name coming from the bedroom. He quickly headed for the floo, but was distracted by the parchment on the desk with potion formulas on it. Apparently, Severus was busy working on the potential cure when Sanguini thought he needed a break. Two notes labeled 'Ideally' caught Cache's eye ...
Severus frowned at Minerva “the headmaster seems preoccupied so we better not bother him” he whispered into her ear. He saw a flicker of dull light in her eyes and suspected a potion was influencing her as well meaning she’ll probably end up reporting this anyway.
of them will never be found."
"Oh right." Frank chuckled and slowly frowned as Trocar's anxiety visibility increased with each passing moment. "Trocar, you'll be fine-"
Sanguini patted the boy's head, "I do this to help everyone including you."
One, remove creepy tracker.
“a painting?” Harry smirked, a tattoo was a painting and if he remembered correctly there was a tattoo parlor in Knockturn Alley. That was an idea … if he got a tattoo he could make into a hidden safe using the charm and keep his suitcase, potions, duffle bag and bottomless bag with him. He can hide the tattoo with his potion to mimic skin.
Cache nodded “ok, I’ll work something out with Poppy. She says Sundays can be busy so maybe I can switch out. What should we work on while this is brewing?”
XXXXXXXXXX
"What?" Draco asked curiously.
“ummm … yeah” the Longbottom heir looked like he wanted to drag Harry to the floo and run, but any chance of that flew out the window when Lyra jumped onto his lap effectively pinning him down.
The young wizard twitched “more money? He really is a creep. Is there anyway to stop that?”
Griphook sent Severus a strange look before gesturing for the wizard to follow “I’m glad you want to because we arranged everything for you to be there”
…’An Animagus is a person who can transform into an animal at will. It is very difficult to reach the state in which to transform and the one changes into is unique to that person’s personality. One must meditate and allow the mind to clear in order to let the magic reveal the animal you are best suited to’…
This weather sucked …
The witch took a moment to ponder if Draco or Blaise knew who Cache really was or not, but in the end it didn’t matter with this topic and decided to ask later “ummm … you could ask about the different kinds of flying machines muggles have and … how they preserve food or about writing tools … here’s his music player too of course” she paused to think, but also noticed Draco was listen very carefully. Actually she noticed he was weird around her since he saw her. it’s like he had an issue with her family or, since she thought some of the looks were jealous ones like when Cache took her to the meeting, she wondered if he liked Cache.
Severus snorted “it’ll serve them right … fine … I’ll try to be a little less strict as far as teaching goes, but I refuse to be so lenient that they start blowing themselves up” the potion professor huffed irritably.
“that I’m not worried about that at the moment. Right now I better get dinner started before he flips out” Harry exclaimed as he grabbed off the floor his shirt realizing he hadn’t put it back on yet.
I’m thinking)
None of this was supposed to get out! He hoped the brat was wrong. Hell he had no clue how the Malfoy could know that when the train only just stopped! The boy was acting as if he had a mental connection to this Sasha, but that was foolish. Sure he can understand Julian being strong enough to make a connection, but not the Malfoy.
Ginny simply blinked innocently “I don’t know what you mean … did Cache say what it was?” she asked and mentally smirked as Draco blushed. However Blaise didn’t seem convinced of her innocence.
Fur, which needed a good cleaning, was short and exotic with its black strips, splotches and speckles over a deep, rich golden brown coat and maybe some white on their bellies … the smaller kneazle having the strips with speckles and the larger having large splotches with speckles and one black strip going down its spine. He wondered if he could run a bath for them without losing an arm. When Harry wasn’t too to keen on getting caught by those claws. The kneazles really looked like jungle cats from the size to the claws. Weight wise they were fur and bones, but that will change.
The old healer looked up to see her blonde apprentice who was shaking and out of breath “oh my Cache what’s wrong?” she said clearly concerned.
“I’m speaking”
degree burn I got helping someone in Gringotts” he admitted and sighed as Severus gave him a look silently ordering him to let him see his hand “it’s not that bad” he said as he held his hand out.
“there’s no time. Here, you’ll understand once you take this” Severus said as he held out the very potion he and Poppy took. The very potion that helped them see the truth …
Sirius' eyes lit up, "I can help!" He blinked as he saw an owl come in through the window. "You got something from Gringotts." He said easily identifying the mark on the letter.
“you also tell me not to let an opportunity pass by and I didn’t” Julian smiled cheekily, but his godfather wasn’t swayed. Either way he couldn’t bring himself to regret what he did “Tom’s last fragments were in a diadem and Professor Quirrell” he commented as his godfather knelt down to feel the man’s pulse on his neck.
“BLOODY HELL! … what was that for?” the Weasley snapped while shooting Harry a glare and ignored the other Gryffindors snickering.
Julian blushed and leaned forward “
“of course” he answered as he kneeled next to the bed. He vaguely heard Aster’s steps go to the floo as he wondered if he should put a plush with Harry. Brian decided to place the wolf plush next to Harry and smiled as the small arms held the soft toy close even when asleep …
Either way it was time to go …
Severus nodded as he handed Poppy the potions to remove the love potions effects “agreed I’ll have it done right after dinner and I’ll give it to her in the morning”
George tilted his head and brought the lantern closer to the magazine so he could see the title and his jaw dropped in shock upon seeing the wedding magazine showing different wedding venues “Blimy! Are you getting married Professor Snape!?’ George exclaimed just loud enough for some of the living portraits along the walls near the Gryffindor dorm entrance to wake up.
“Cache a letter from Gringotts came for you” the landlord handed the letter over.
"Actually no, I came through the Headmistress's floo. Come on, Ron. Gringotts serves food for early meetings so you and Scabbers can eat there." Arthur said hoping the ghost would understand that this was a little more serious than a typical trip since special permission is needed for that floo. Right now Gringotts and the Ministry have control because of the investigations. Thankfully, the Bloody Baron was clever and simply followed after them quietly.
“calm down. I can see why you like him. Tell me about him” Blaise said mentally getting ready to use every detail to help Draco get closer to Cache.
’ Gloria offered, soon after Brian and Harry were riding on the back of the large intimidating crocodile upstream and enjoying the very different environment Australia has compared to the UK …
“how are you Ms. Weasley?” asked Severus as he, Percy and Minerva entered the infirmary. Fred quickly hid the map in his robes before anyone noticed.
“I’m speaking”
"I'm Cache, a staff representative from Hogwarts, Master Gritmace." Cache said with a slight respectful bow as they continued through the halls.
“WHAT?” Draco snapped and ran over to see this letter faster than his parents “it’s in your old name, but how? … you lived in a cupboard?” Draco looked at his friend feeling a strong urge to hug him and offer comfort so he did. He could tell this affected Julian who hugged back firmly.
Trocar stepped up to Minerva, "You're right to worry, but not in your logic. The muggle world has several strange names for kids like Samsung or Internet. There are even lists of names that can't be used in several places because people are dumb enough to use them." He said even though he knew Minerva wouldn't understand why they were odd names. "A wizard from the muggle world having a strange name wouldn't be weird at all and translation spells don't work like that. Those spells work solely on everything except words considered name. Cache will never be translated because he sees it as his name."
“not yet Draco” Severus said as he gently shook the little boy awake and placed the vial of the clear potion at the boy’s lips “we’re going to try something different this time. Drink this and spit it back out for me” the young boy did as told with Severus’s help and the potion that was spat back into the vial was now white … it was the Cyclic disease “ok … good boy, I have something that may be a better option for you. Drink this” he helped Draco sit up and drink the green potion for just that disease before tucking the boy into bed.
However after the potion was finished and Harry left for the night when Severus finished undressing for the night a voice was heard “beautiful”
Green eyes widened as Maria vanished. He spun around at the sound of Trocar gagging and there she was holding Trocar by the neck. Maria was standing on the arm of the couch to get the height required to lift Trocar off the ground. Her eyes were nearly black and her fangs were extended … Maria was furious!
Harry licked the cum drops off his lips, "Ready?" He whispered huskily into Draco's ear.
Weary eyes of a skinny woman looked up and when she adjusted to the light she paled in horror “YOU! What are you doing here you freak? Go away-” suddenly her voice fell silent.
“are you ok?” Draco asked as he gazed into the blue eyes and looked for any sign of a problem. Of course he noted the bloodshot state, but was happy to see they weren’t bleeding like before.
“what about?” Albus Dumledore asked curiously though the twinkle in his eyes lessened slightly.
Severus looked at the carving of the snake under the stone image of the founder “Salazar Slytherin was the least popular founder at Hogwarts and he was really good at potions, but he was known for being skilled at many other things too even runes. The founders’ rooms were all accounted for except his so it was rumored to be in here. Considering how far we fell it’s not too much deeper than the Slytherin dorms so if it was true that he was very skilled in a number of areas and cared for the students under his care then maybe he built a passage to his office …” Severus looked at the stone founder’s mouth and saw a scrap of snake skin ”It looks like the basilisk could travel through the mouth. This skin it shed proves it. Is there a rune to open it?” he asked the vampire who quickly moved over to Severus with Cache in his arms.
The shrill whistle of the train signaled the departure of the students …
The young wizard smiled as the kneazles purred … it seems they liked the names …
Building mental defenses was difficult. Harry could easily make a wall of magic appear, but it collapses right away. His magic refuses to become a solid wall like the book mentioned. Granted the book said it takes a lot of practice to get it strong enough to resist Legilimency, but it should still … or not …
“you were still unconscious so it wasn’t your fault” Harry commented absentmindedly as he let the Skele-gro heal the broken bone so he could put a healing salve on the other cuts and burns.
The pretty green eyes turned to look at Severus “red … lots of red and little black dots, but its really … it doesn’t fly around like Daddy’s”
“enjoying your stay so far?” Tom asked curiously.
The two dark creatures blinked like deer caught in the headlights and stayed silent until Trocar turned to Severus and said “would it surprise you to know we were once very good at keeping secrets?” Severus couldn’t help laughing at that …
’ the occamy hissed back as he grew a little and wrapped around Julian’s neck.
"We did do it … we did-" Draco finally turned and startled when he realized the tall wizard was. He slipped slightly only to be caught around the waist by Harry. He blushed wildly and his heart raced as he felt the strong chest he was held up against. With shaking hands his fingers closed around the collar of Harry's shirt and looked up into Harry's eyes, which were green since he took a break from using the coloring potion while he was inside.
’ he growled and released a rather large flame for his current size, which goes to show just how pissed he was. With the small occamy flying along with him Julian ran to the kitchen and before his Dad could say a word he thrust the letter into his hand.
“I don’t know about that … maybe we need to check after some time passes. Until I’m sure I won’t make another batch” Harry said as he put his shirt back on. Maybe it was stubbornness, but he wanted to give this potion a chance. With his mind preoccupied with what happened with the potion at the moment a certain new scroll laid on the bookcase completely forgotten …
Cache nodded “they all do … the vampires and werewolves I know are more caring than any human I’ve met … I’ve met only a few humans who noticed that I needed help. A muggle family and a friend from school, but everyone else ignored me … and then there’s you … what do believe is wrong with me?”
“indeed … especially since the Cyclic cure is fatal to anyone who doesn’t need it” Severus remarked with an amused smirk at the subtle quiz. Normally he’d take offense, but the twins were very clever at hiding it and never sounded condescending … no wonder they make great teachers. Severus reached for the potions only for the potions to be moved out of reach … these women would make great Slytherins as well “in exchange for what?”
“tomorrow afternoon actually, I have to explain about the goblins and the possible exams they will perform … I hope he won’t be scared” Brian frowned more than a a little nervous about how Harry would react if he met the goblins. The last thing he wanted was to stress Harry.
"How long will it take for Tom to fully adjust?" Brian asked hearing said teen whimper as the healers came too close too fast resulting in Julian gently consoling him.
“yes and this is my son who goes by Julian now and my friend Aster” Brian introduced as they followed the goblin to a beautiful private room with a set of plush blue chairs around a pedestal and a coffee table.
Harry smiled sadly “no … no they aren’t” he rolled up his left sleeve and barely flinched at the growl coming from the vampire when the scars were revealed “when I returned for the summer they separated me from my wand, had me cook dinner and then locked me away in a cell” Cache swallowed as a knot in his throat started to develop. Trocar gently rubbed circles in the boy’s back to sooth him “the next day during my chores I found out that they panned to take their squib friend and leave on a three week cruise”
“perfect … ready girl?” Harry asked. He grinned as his familiar plopped down on the couch cushion next to him. He tapped her and said the incantation to reveal the charm. Once he had the green glow in sight he put his wand down and began lifting the charm away from his feathered friend. Harry noticed Hedwig shudder as he pulled the charm off her “I’m sorry girl” he said quickly not wanting to lose focus
Vampires and werewolves have very sharp hearing and there’s an added boost with a full moon coming …
"You didn't have to do this Harry!" Trocar exclaimed nearly in tears, which surprised Harry and Severus a little, "It has been so long since I taught a full class … what should I wear? What should I do to better my chances of being allowed to teach? Something more like robes perhaps?"
“you have my approval for brewing. I’ll get you a ring, be right back” Cache watched her leave feeling happy that this went so well. He bottled the potion and set it on the shelves with the other potions.
Tom didn’t show it, but he was concerned … was the boy living on a street of abusers? And what kind of squib would hurt the only magical creature that tends to bond with them? “you must take good care of them, they care for you a lot”
“over here Poppy” the healer spun around and spotted Cache setting things up in a empty brewing station “no one was using this spot so I hope it’s alright if I do. It only takes an hour to make Skele-gro, would you like to watch?”
“honestly, I didn’t know myself. It wasn’t until about a month or so later that I realized what the problem was … when I
I'm thinking)
“I’m just sore Trocar, I’ll be fine” Cache chuckled as Trocar clearly ignored his comment and continued wiping away the blood.
"I'm speaking"
the young wizard’s eyes lit up. Hogsmeade would be a nice place to see before it loses anymore businesses … a scroll titled ‘Ancient Sins Against Nature’ and another book called ‘Liquid Loyalty: The Lazy Approach’ were piled in his arms and he went up to the counter he paid with his last galleons before heading off to The White Wyvern where he found Trocar with a glass filled with a suspiciously blood red liquid.
“neither did I, but it’s passed for now. I’ll figure something out for when he returns, but until then are there other family friends I should be concerned with” Harry asked as he took a seat.
Remus spotted his wand on the ground and got it to remove binding spell on his leg “Sirius you shouldn’t have come here-”
Draco nodded casually, "Frank, how do you feel? Was there any pain?"
“thank you Severus” Narcissa said gratefully as she took the seat next to the bed and fussed over her son. Lucius didn’t even look up as Severus walked pout into the hall. No one saw him pick up his sneaky bat either …
"I'm speaking"
The goblin scoffed, "Dumbledore isn't kind or loving or selfless. Either he never noticed that your rat lived far too long, which I doubt, or he did and knew, but didn't care enough to say anything. He let a Death Eater stay in your home … with you." The goblin emphasized looking right at Ron.
“I’m speaking”
” Harry winced at the harsh sound of his aunt’s shrill vioce. It wasn’t too shocking really. Ms. Figg hated him for some reason … it was possible that it was for the same reason as Petunia and Vernon, but he wasn’t sure.
"We should stop him." One auror said, but 4 minutes passed before Sirius was pulled away from the bloodied Pettigrew. "If anyone asks we reacted faster."
The second they saw Cache appear Draco’s jaw all but unhinged “IT’S YOU?”
The wizard barely got down the street when the wind threw a branch at him …
“good, I’ll talk to them. Do I need to sign something?” Arthur asked and Ron gaped in shock as Severus handed his father a quill to sign a couple papers.
Suddenly, she broke down nearly screaming as tears poured down her face, "Why you?! … why so nice! … the only … one was … Harry! Now … he hates … me!" She cried out between sobs. Cache just held her and let her cry not sure what else to do. He was mad, but he didn't hate her. Unfortunately, he couldn't just say that so he stayed quiet and waited for her to calm down. Cache stayed through the treatment and until she fell asleep with her cat, which appeared seemingly out of nowhere to comfort her bringing about a fresh wave of tears at first.
The goblin manager of the Potter accounts went to another office and went in “Razorback I have an offer for your clients, the Malfoys” the other goblin looked irritated until Griphook started explaining …
Arthur saw he confusion go across his son's face as the team of aurors came out dragging a screaming rat like man with them, "I'm sorry-"
’ Sasha secretly spoke with her wizard through the familiar bond. No doubt she wanted a little pay back for those unflattering comments about her being weird for not being an owl like other familiars, which is stupid! Those feather dusters send mail not stay with their wizard to protect and no one seems to understand any of the owls or cats they claim are familiars, which means no bond. No understanding means no bond. No bond means it’s not a familiar!
Everything went like a blur once he spotted Professor Snape. Not one minute went by without him casting a glance at the professor. The buzz of people was barely heard over his heart pounding against his ribcage. Snape had finished his meal and was about to leave. Harry scarfed down a little more food and said he’d meet them in the common room to Hermione who looked a little put out, but it was covered up quickly covered up with a smile so he ignored it.
“I am in charge here Albus. He didn’t ask me or even start writing a letter while I was here” the healer said carefully avoiding the subject.
(just bloody great … well I’ll just read my new book while I wait for him to leave) Harry thought. It didn’t seem like a good idea to stroll passed him and potentially get caught with his cloak so he perched on a crate and pulled out the new book and put his ipod away.
As the werewolf fed his friend, he started pondering why Sirius was so confused yesterday. He seemed so much more stable now, but was that just because of the potions? No, Remus was sure something pissed Sirius off after he got to Hogwarts. After all Sirius clearly knew the connection between Julian and Harry before escaping, but was deeply confused after Remus caught up to him. That anger rattled his mind to the point that he forgot everything the Minister said only moments before. What pissed him off though?
Percy stepped up “I’m head boy so I have separate living quarters. I will take him there and confine him to that room. Since Ginny is in Slytherin I’ll get Professor Snape as well as Professor McGonagall”
Meditation … the same as finding your Animagi except you need to learn to clear your mind in order to enter your mental realm and wrap your magic around your mind core to create solid walls. So which did he want to start with? Occlumency, practically it is what he should master first to help him hide. Besides, learning that first might make becoming an animagus easier.
“one more little test and we’ll be done Julian” Griphook said as he and Ironclaw changed the settings on the sides of the pedestal. The ruins started glowing again, but the one piece of paper that appeared made the goblins growl.
Trocar’s strange resentment towards him …
“well … here we go” he kneeled next to Hedwig’s cage and opened it “I’m sorry girl, but if my Uncle Vernon sees you … I couldn’t forgive myself if something happened to you. Take your cage and fly to the house. The window in the attic is always unlocked so slip in and hide there or leave and hunt until I get there. Just please don’t be seen” Hedwig hooted sadly and gently nipped his hand making it clear that she understood the seriousness of the situation.
“it has been 11 years Albus. If he was going to return he would’ve found a way by now especially with those remaining followers out there brave enough to search for him. I won’t put my life on hold just to return to being a spy for some point that might not come. Why are you so sure Voldemort is still alive?” Severus hissed harshly under his breath.
The young woman with waist length white hair nodded in satisfaction and Brian relaxed “good … now his body is healing quickly and he’s out of danger. All he needs is rest and lots of nutrition potions. I set up an alarm ward if his vitals change”
A smile crept to Cache’s lips as he saw Draco glance at his right hand, which was free of bandages “yeah … my hand is fine, see” Cache held up his hand to show that no wound or even a scar remained.
Harry’s eyes widened as he saw a burn on Armel’s neck, “I’ll be fine, but you need blood! How many others were hurt?”
XXXXXXXXXX
A waste of space … would Brian get rid of him if he didn’t do certain chores? They didn’t talk about that! He had no clue what to do to earn his keep!
"Results? For my Nerve Tonic? It's a bit early for that, isn't it?" Cache gasped as he nearly stumbled over Libra from being unexpectedly dragged. Just after righting himself she stopped in front of counter he originally turned his potion in to.
Sanguini chuckled, “They better get a bite in for me.” He said knowing they’ll catch up easily being faster than the werewolves. Of course, since it’s stealthier to chase someone down on foot incase they can sense the magic flex caused by an apparating. It’s rare that witches and wizards can sense that tiny flex, but it’s best to be careful and not risk that your target can especially if it’s Dumbledore. That wizard will never see it coming …
“you know, since you’re up I need permission to send two of my Order members to America. I brought the paperwork so just need to sign off on it. Ones for Remus Lupin and the other is for Moody” the headmaster shoved a quill into the weak hands and made the poor man sign twice. Seeing the completed forms Dumbledore grinned. The werewolf who is gullible enough to believe everything he says and knows Potter’s scent is going with Moody, who is a good tracker too, to America to find the person who ‘kidnaped’ Harry … or at least that’s the story he’ll tell them.
Neville raised an eyebrow “I agree we should eat, but who would flip-”
I'm thinking)
“oh I see- … you what?! are you insane?!” the healer gaped as she stared at the headmaster in complete shock “I will, of course, get answers right Brian?” she said so sweetly that the headmaster knew he’d die a horrible death if he didn’t give a really, really good reason for the child on the brink of death in her guest bed … answers which he didn’t quite have right now …
Isaac chuckled at the cute blush gracing Draco's before looking at the glass tube in his hand, "Mom said you were the first to use these … it's hard to believe these were only in use for a few years, but then I grew up with this."
“and Ms. Granger, you have a regular cat” Minerva answered bluntly. She didn’t want to embarrass the girl, but she was asking for it. As Hermione turned an ugly shade of red in her shame during the students snickering at her Minerva glanced at Dumbledore hoping he’d control the situation, but the wizard looked like he was frustrated by something. With no help coming from the headmaster she raised her hands for silence “that’s enough! Dinner is over so all first years follow the prefects for your house. They will take you to your dorm where you will be staying for the rest of your time here. Should you need anything please speak to your professor. We are here for you”
As he stabbed the helpless pieces of fruit and devoured them he casually read the charms book to get ready for his tests. Hedwig quickly finished her meal too and fluttered back ready to get rid of this unwanted addition. With all his food eaten Harry cleaned up and went to the living room. He took a little knick knack of a frog fishing off the mantel and sat on the couch.
“his living conditions, but he didn’t say much. I think I guessed correctly about him simply wanting his broom” the potions master sneered.
“I DON’T MOTHER ANYONE!” Trocar leaned towards Frank and frowned “you need to eat more you look peaked”
Narcissi raised an eyebrow “he hasn’t turned this in yet?”
A moment after he heard Aster say ‘UK Gringotts’ Julian felt a sudden rush of warmth, but then nothing except the sounds of a very different place. Feeling brave … or the effects of the calming potion … Julian peeked out and gasped in awe at the building they were in. It was amazing! The creatures running around or working at the counters were the goblins his Daddy mentioned and weren’t as scary as he expected.
“we’d be worried if you didn’t have such security charms in place” Severus scoffed as he gave the goblin the wills “besides, when you changed the subject earlier it seemed like you had an idea who was behind this … oversight” the potion aster said trying to find the most diplomatic term for what happened to Julian.
Surely Cache is too young for that yet being he’s only 11 … Poppy blinked and looked around. Where did her new apprentice get to? “Cache?”
XXXXXXXXXX
Hermione looked up, "Why?"
The healer in training went on to reveal who his mentors were, but the surprises went on. Apparently Severus was Draco’s godfather! That was not something Harry saw coming at all. They didn’t have much time to revel in the pleasant news for a flood of people rushed into the town … something about a sale on Harry Potter figurines. The two young wizards left and started walking through the forest.
After completing the other steps he looked at the final product … it was the right yellow color, but it looked very pale. Harry just shrugged it off. He was still going to try it. He bottled the potion in the remaining vials, cleaned the cauldron and let them cool as he went to take a hot shower. The water rolling down his scarred back was relaxing in a way. His mind cleared for a few minutes and all his troubles melted away … until he got out and realized he will need to get himself clothes and added that to his growing list.
Frank snorted as he and Greyback walked in the room “yep, he’s Harry’s mentor and mother” Trocar was dropped to the ground as Maria finally calmed down. Harry went over to Trocar who was gagging slightly as he shot Frank a dirty look for the mother comment.
A smile kept to his lips as he saw Harry calm down and clutch the fluffy wolf toy “he can’t go around blind until he gets a vision correcting potion … this will work for now” Brian tapped a pair of sunglasses he had laying around with his wand and changed them into regular slim nearly frameless glasses. The measurements he took from Harry before came in handy, but he needed little Harry’s prescription. Sadly that means he will have to use magic in front of Harry.
“yes … Poppy and Severus have hinted to that a few times. There is a problem though … making the scars go away won’t do much for the damage underneath the skin. After an hour an injury has trouble healing back to full health even with magic. I never had any of my wounds treated before … I scanned myself and found some pretty bad nerve damage …” Harry said as he cleaned some plates, which Trocar immediately took over since Harry apparently wasn’t allowed to do that on his birthday “anyway, nerve damage is exactly what I want to test so I’m going to brew and test the kneazle whisker potion on myself first-… Trocar?” Harry blinked as he saw the vampire looking at him.
"You're right, I needed a safe place and I found that about two months ago." Cache said and noticed Minerva looked concerned. "I know what you want … Harry Potter is safe, but he won't come back until he's ready … he may never come back, but he's safe with people who care." He said with a glance at Trocar. Cache did not outright say who he was, but he knew it was enough.
Cache chuckled as he saw Greg and Vincent shiver in fear of yet another person with a mother owl persona, "Now, now go easy on them, Blaise. They seem to be telling the truth to me." With that situation handled Cache and Draco headed to the headmistress' office to floo to his apartment.
After hours of chatting Harry was sure he smelled smoke come from Hogwarts as they drew close, but he couldn’t see the source against the dark night sky …
First he made and ate a large lunch, cleaned his cauldron and stored his potions on the counter. He gave the kneazles some food before jotting down a quick list of each ingredient he took from Snape and the amounts. Of course he added some other ingredients for potions that might prove useful, like the dreamless sleep potion. That would be good to keep the Dursleys out of his hair.
“We can’t force you, but considering this may affect your job if you decide not to reverse these blocks.“ The goblin warned as he spelled away the blood. In most cases these magical scans wouldn’t work because, while goblin magic is different than human magic and can find potions with scans, it can’t test a wide range all at once. It would be ineffective if you didn’t know where to start, but Severus, Minerva and, unbeknownst to anyone, Harry Potter’s scans helped narrow down what spells and potions Dumbledore preferred. This made the process, which was the first of its kind in a long time because of the bad blood between the ministry and Gringotts, move rather quickly compared to what it could be.
“yeha … ok … I remember going on a trip to Albania … though I can’t really remember why … I remember everything after returning to school, but it’s all fuzzy …” Quirrell explained still very dazed though he was trying to move not knowing that Aster, Julian and Draco felt relieved. Even Narcissa and Lucius were relieved though they were still unsure why what happened to Quirrell was so serious, but it did make them more curious as to why Severus told them to look into the information concerning spirit magic.
“that is accidental magic. It’s not something you can control nor should you feel scared of it. Your aunt and uncle were afraid and jealous because you have a power that they don’t. That’s why they hurt you, but you never deserved it, do you understand?” Harry tightened his grip on his toy and nodded slowly, but Brian was sure the boy was trying to avoid a punishment by agreeing “I can prove magic isn’t evil, would you like to see?”
“I’ll talk with your mother about it” Lucius said amusedly. No doubt his son wanted a small token of revenge against Albus Dumbledore who hurt his friend.
“LUCIUS!”
Lockhart puffed out his chest and strolled over “how may I be of assistance?” he asked apparently inflating his ego a bit just knowing the fools who embarrassed him needed him now.
Harry sighed “this is becoming more and more complicated with each step … I could move my tracker to a button and sew it to my robes, but what should I do for you Hedwig. We don’t know who put these charms on us so if we’re seen and the person can’t feel the tracker we’ll be found out. We have to wear the charms until we want to disappear-of course! Can I have the letter carrier on your leg?”
“a love potion?” Cache whispered to Severus as they watched the students practice a simple yet effective shield spell before starting meditating as Cache suggested.
The blonde chuckled “after lunch then. This will be interesting because she’s one species of reptile that understands parseltongue so the three of us can chat”
Severus actually turned red “I WAS NOT MOANING! GET OUT!” he snapped waking the two sleeping kneazles.
“Ms. Weasley here is a tough cookie. She’ll be fine. I’m going to take her to the infirmary” Cache said as he used a spell to stop the bleeding and helped her up “I will need someone to confine Ron Weasley to his dorm”
“I’ll say” Sophia smiled as she looked around at all the little details like the vine pattern etched into the glass of the table. Just when Severus turned to close the doors so they could explore in peace they heard a distant scream echo through the halls and he ran out of the suite with his wives. The scream seemed to come from a floor below them so they went looking.
“indeed” Severus mentally rolled his eyes knowing full well that this donation wouldn’t appear until Draco was in school “do tell Narcissa that I will come to the party” with that the blonde pureblood left through the floo’s green flames.
“It is. He trained so hard with his elemental magic we thought it was time he had a place to meditate“ Lucius commented.
XXXXXXXXXX
Finally, Cache flooed into the room and Minerva looked up, "That didn't take long. What's the plan?"
“nope … the headmaster is 120 some years old and has been at the school as a staff member for 80 years so I think he can handle a joke” Severus said with a shrug as he stood up (besides he will need to get used to being the butt of every joke soon) Severus thought sadistically.
XXXXXXXXXX
“what?” Harry gulped nervously.
Cache sighed as he watched his owl leave and sat on the couch with Trocar “I’m only 11 almost 12 years old and I was raised by my muggle aunt and uncle … they hate anything magic” he glanced at the vampire who was listening intently “for the 10 years I lived with them I thought magic didn’t exist and that I was a freak … it wasn’t until my letter for school came that they finally told me I was a wizard, but they didn’t actually admit it until 100 more letters and a school representative came to get me … I remember the disgust on their faces”
“straight As across the board” Draco said proudly and quickly checked off a couple optional classes.
“yes” Trocar remarked as he turned away and zipped over to the fireplace. He paused in a moment of surprise as he saw a cloaked Armel standing protectively next to Harry and Frank, but shrugged it off. That pause gave Severus just enough time to join them before the flames of the floo to take them away.
“cool, thanks Tom!” Cache shook Tom’s hand and took off into the streets. Thankfully it wasn’t as busy as the first time he came there with Hagrid so he found his way to Gringotts in no time and soon found himself fidgeting nervously under the glare of a goblin sitting behind the counter “umm … excuse me, I’d like to talk to the goblin in charge of my vault please”
“he’s good with Julian” Sophia said when she joined her sister.
Cache leaned over and whispered “be honest, do I look that bad?” he said quietly as the entire hall erupted with whispers and chatter … Severus snorted in amusement, but didn’t respond …
“Merlin no!” the Malfoy Lord yelled “I refuse to let that monster near my family if I can help it, but what if he does return and this was gone? You know what could happen to us, to Draco. Until I’m sure the Dark Lord will not return it stays” he said as he put the book back on the shelf.
“thank Merlin … I need a break” Harry put the frog back on the mantel, tossed the figure back on Dudley’s game console where he assumed it was and opened his trunk “if I sew this on my robes it should be fine. I won’t be able to run around as Hogwarts without my robe … that might get weird over the weekends … I’ll think about that, but now what to do about this tracking charm?”
And what now?
“Libra claw me” Draco hissed quickly as Severus went towards the door. The bigger kneazle understood and scratched Draco’s arm “heal me”
Harry nodded into his Dad’s chest “yes, I get to pick my name” he mumbled shyly peeking out quickly to look at the women. The cool salve being spread on felt really good and each time it was applied Harry felt a little the tight painful scars go away. this was really happening! Nearly every night of his short tragic life he hoped for a kind person to take him away and Brian comes. Now these nice people are getting rid of his scars. He’ll soon have a new name and take a potion that will make him more like his Daddy … Harry was so happy!
. I won’t become spoiled so you can’t buy entire candy stores again” Cache said teasingly making Draco blush slightly.
The silence lingered as he bottled his potions and packaged them in a box with handles Sanguini had in the owlery for mailing. A dribble of wax on the box sealed it and Harry pressed the ring into the wax. With a clear mark and a light weight charm Hedwig flew off down stairs to go through the owlery so no windows needed to be opened to risk the vampires. The thought of having Hedwig mailing things made him a little nervous at first, but not anymore. He noted several white owls in the owlery delivering mail when he went to get the packing box and asked Trocar about it. Apparently the fact that the ‘Boy Who Lived’ had a snowy white owl meant that other people had to have one too.
Dinner was made and the kneazles were fed. Sanguine finally put Harry’s door back in its rightful place, which made Harry happy. Severus tried to leave after the meal because he felt like he was imposing on the young wizard’s space, but Harry insisted he stay on the couch so he could check in on him. It may not sound dangerous, but drinking too much of any potion too fast is a serious matter. Despite knowing this Severus snuck out of the apartment once he was sure the boy and the kneazles were asleep …
As the potion and liquids made their way into the child’s system she spelled away his clothes and began diligently cleaning the poor little boy with a set of never been used sponges. As each sponge was used on an area she threw it away so as not to use it again and contaminate any wounds.
“I can’t allow this-dear merlin!” Dumbledore looked at the occamy in horror as it gracefully landed “you boys get away from that beast right now” he ordered and pointed his wand threateningly at the dark blue occamy as if he was going to protect the boys on its back.
Petunia snarled weakly as she held Dudley “let us go you freaks” she hissed. They all looked pale and skinnier than when they first got there and their clothes were filthy and ragged. In the corner was a couple buckets, one filled with water and one smelled badly. Vernon, Petunia and Marge had fang marks on their necks from when Trocar and Maria tried to scare them … clearly it did work, but having drugged up vampires running scared everyone else too …
“-are hurting you” Sophia finished perfectly. Harry nodded shyly, but didn’t make eye contact. He just kept most of his face hidden by Brian’s jacket, which is exactly how he acts around Aster “ok sweety, we have some things that will help” said Sophia as they kneeled on the ground next to Brian who was still holding the boy.
“I do what I have to do to survive even using the cuteness of kneazles” Harry chuckled as he put both Draco’s and Neville’s trunks in the racks above. Just as he sat down next to Neville the door opened revealing Ron and Hermione (dear Merlin, I was hoping to avoid this) Harry thought, but couldn’t resist smirking as both Ron and Hermione’s jaw dropped when they recognized him as Cache.
Gritmace scoffed before looking at Cache, "Be as brutally blunt as possible. What is her demeanor like?"
“much better professor” Ginny said with a smile showing that her lip was indeed healed.
Brian grinned and patted Harry’s head gently “there’s no wrong answer. Which did you like?”
The headmaster smiled “I have no doubt little one, go to sleep” he gave Harry the toy wolf to cuddle and watched as the boy finally lost the battle with the Sandman and fell asleep. Brian gently ran his fingers through the black hair before getting up to call Aster and tell her about what happened … handprints
“of course” Severus said with a look of indifference.
“I don’t know, but one thing is for sure. We aren’t being told the whole story” Moody scowled as he thought about any other leads they may have “James had no relatives, but did Lily?”
“I’m speaking”
“at least you thought that through … oh, just so you know I’ll be helping out my mentors in their school through most of the year” Cache said feigning disappointment.
The disguised Potter heir snickered “Sugar Daddy is a muggle term to describe a rich guy who lavishes someone with gifts for
“really? I’m sorry, who dumped the boy on you? Please explain” Brian asked trying not to kill them. His hypnotism spell worked best when the ones under it felt safe and could talk freely.
I’m thinking)
“seriously? … of all the places that dart could’ve fallen it lands here … should’ve just gone surfing instead. Oh well, better make the most of this vacation” muttered a tall blonde man as he appeared in Diagon Alley through a burst of green flames courtesy of the Floo network.
If he tries to just grab his trunk and run with no plan then he will be caught either by Death Eaters or Dumbledore. Then he’ll be either killed or locked back in with stronger locks … with spells too. And if the things he took were discovered what would happen? … he didn’t want to think of it …
XXXXXXXXXX
The Minister nodded, "Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley wished to say their side. First, I wish to confirm something. In your investigation did you find a passkey in Dumbledore's possession? I was potioned by the man and I remembered him taking my passkey during that time. I didn't want it to fall into the wrong hands."
Ron smirked feeling great about finally ditching the ghost and it only got better. After flooing into the wizarding bank, they were met by a goblin and personally escorted to a room. He felt very important and loved every minute of it.
“now lets see …” Harry pulled out his list and started looking around. He rolled his eyes as he heard a couple women gossiping about weight loss and skin enhancing potions. Thankfully he had a way to ignore it. The disguised wizard dug into the pocket of the baggy pair of nice clothes he took from Dudley’s closet and popped the ear buds in his ears. Music from the ipod made everything better … he grabbed a cart with an expanding charm and continued knocking off the items on his list.
Voldemort just had to make the trackers on the Malfoys not just powerful, but painful and fatal. If the tracking charm is broken a curse is activated that will cause intense pain for a day before killing them. Also any loyal Death Eater can tap into the tracker to cause pain if they suspect the Malfoys tried to escape. Even Bellatrix who is in Azkaban can connect to the trackers if they have been gone too long. One week long vacations close by is the best they can hope for.
“it seems he fainted” Aster said as she levitated the professor onto the closest empty bed.
Harry blinked, "It stopped the venom, not just the symptoms?"
“ah, good timing then!” Trocar smiled as he shut the door behind him. He carefully took in the scent of old cauldron that Cache was going to wash before putting it away in the brown bottomless bag. The vampire was sure the older scent ingrained in the metal was that of the potions professor who unknowingly condemned Cache. If he can find that person he may be able to discover who his apprentice really was.
“good, I’m sure this will put Harry’s mind at ease” Armel commented approving of the update.
XXXXXXXXXX
That tracking charm will be off him if the tests he had in mind went right. Of course if someone put a tracker on him why not his stuff too? The realization nearly made him choke on his milk. He put his glass down, cleared his airways of the milk he inhaled and took his trunk out of the cupboard. After grabbing his wand he checked for a charm. Right in the center of the trunk directly under the handle was a gray glowing tracking charm.
Daggerfang growled as magic exploded from Tom's body sending the medi-witches back several feet, "As impressive as it is that you can use magic so soon after getting your body back, Mr. Riddle, you must stop this or you'll die permanently this time."
In an instant Trocar, Frank, Armel and everyone from downstairs went to the young wizard’s side and none were not happy with what they saw. Severus had opened his eyes and grabbed Harry’s wrist in a painful vice like grip. It was possible the potion master had no clue he was hurting Harry. In fact the young wizard was certain that his mentor was still out cold since his eyes, though open, were dazed as if he was asleep. That didn’t matter to the dark creatures who flooded the room and were baring their fangs or pointing their wands at Severus ready to rip him to shreds. Armel was the fastest and had Severus’s wrist in a flash … the same wrist of the hand clutching Harry’s wrist …
The fake blonde blinked “why don’t you want to fight someone with your brother wand?”
“unfortunately yes … my father was forced to protect a book. A diary, it’s in my office” Lucius said.
“hello, I’m David the owner of this shop! What can I do for you?” said the cheery burly old man behind the counter with a magical eye in place of his right eye.
Blaise twitched not thinking anyone saw him give Draco a little nudge with a hex, but it seems he was wrong, "Yes, Professor."
“I’ll look into it, don’t worry” Cache smiled as they all left “if you don’t need anything Poppy I’m going to head home”
However …
"We?" Harry asked with a playful smile.
Her sons and husbands nodded as she went in to call the police ...
“fuck you traitor!” Ron snapped trying to make this entire situation as difficult as possible starting with going dead weight so his brother had to fight to get him there.
“ow! … bloody hell” the young boy hissed in pain and clutched his hand. Harry was so consumed by his thoughts that he didn’t realize that his grip on a shelf was getting stronger with each thought until his thumb slipped and he sliced his thumb. Dashing over to the sink and washing the cut was the first thing he did. Then he took a square of toilet paper to mop up the gray blood drops on the ground.
Trocar saw Harry avoid eye contact for a second in a silent sign of nervousness and pouted “you know you can talk to us. What is it about this that bothers you? Just because we can’t stop the news doesn’t mean we can’t change some things so you can get feel more comfortable” the vampire said feeling really bad about letting himself and the others get carried away and not taking Harry’s thoughts into consideration.
“watch it Malfoy. You can’t always have your cronies with you” Ron snarled threateningly though he quickly backed away as Libra stood up and growled protectively.
The witch shrugged trying, and failing, to not look impressed “who cares? They are no where near as awesome as Harry Potter” she said, but though they all nodded in agreement they couldn’t take their eyes away from the window they practically had their faces plastered to until the occamy was out of sight. Unfortunately by the time they decided to return to their seats the full side of the compartment bench was taken by Sasha who shamelessly stretched out so they all had to go to the other side to sit.
“did you feel any pain?” Sanguini asked softly as he held Severus by his waist.
Cache frowned, "I saw the Bloody Baron as we went passed the Great Hall so he must be there getting ready for breakfast."
Hedwig was perched in her cage sporting a new color palette consisting of dark rich brown on her head, back, tail feathers and across the back of her wings. A creamy gold color colored her face, stomach and the underside of her wings and tail feathers. A few black speckles completed the owls disguise. Harry did this last night after eating … and after telling an army of ‘dark’ creatures his life story of course. Hedwig’s nickname is Ami and she was still a lovely owl …
Harry looked over his shoulder making Remus flinch at the cold indifferent gaze the young wizard had, “Which one of you did this?” He asked coldly.
An eager Cache dipped his spoon into the cold vanilla ice cream and tried the tasty smooth sweet. It was really his first time tasting the dessert. He could see now why Dudley loved it so much. It was now a favorite treat of his too. Draco however seemed to love the marshmallow goo more than anything. Every bite had to have a dollop of the red syrup and Harry found it very amusing to watch. By the time they got to the chocolate cake making up the cauldron Draco was breaking apart the baked shell and scraping the bottom of the jar to get every smudge of gooey marshmallow sauce …
The twins beamed at the adorable child and spoke in perfect sync “you’re very welcome sweety”
Harry mentally winced, what would the man say if he saw that he was using a kitchen as a lab? “I live in the Eventide Apartment complex in Knockturn Alley”
Just as breakfast he finished breakfast he remember his new purchases and started pulling things out. First the books and scroll were placed on the bookshelf and the new cauldrons were set on the lowest shelf after unshrinking them.
Severus paused to think about how to answer that and he sighed as he realized he might have to tell them more than he originally thought “I started teaching about three years ago and I would like to change a few things, but that might give away too much … since you’re part of Julian’s life and he wants to delve deeper in this horcrux issue at some point” he rolled up his sleeve and showed them the Death Mark, which made him feel regret every time he looked at it.
"Ah! Headmaster Dumbledore, is this a good time? We need to talk." Cornelius stated with a deceitfully kind smile as he politely bent down and picked up the cloak.
“do you think he escaped?” Cache asked quietly as he set up the potions in the infirmary to prepare for the girls who will be coming to unknowingly remove a love portion. He saw the look on Dumbledore’s face. There was no doubt in his mind that the bastard bolted, but how far could he get? It worried him to think abut what back up plans Dumbledore had …
“Fuck You!” Ron snapped and grabbed Harry by the collar. Lucius Malfoy was about to use his wand to break Ron away from the other boy before a dangerous growl could be heard. The growls made everyone freeze and look up, except Harry. On top of the store roof next to them were two large furious kneazles bearing their sharp teeth and claws. Ron dropped Harry’s collar and tried to back away, but the kneazles flew off the roof and ran for the red head who was sent running down the street making a few people scatter to get out of the way. The Malfoys and Harry smirked in amusement as the two kneazles stopped and returned to Harry, but Ron kept running not realizing no one was chasing him anymore.
Aster frowned “you mean now? He is mostly recovered, but I wouldn’t expect him to wake up for at least another day”
Dumbledore grinned at the floor of his office where a new rune circle was drawn “just a little more time and I’ll at least have a golem to hide the brat’s disappearance” he said. This had to be done now for the Hogwarts Express will be arriving any second. It will be easy to say Potter missed the train. No one will find it weird not like if the boy never arrived at all …
“sounds like the evidence against Dumbledore is mounting” a goblin commented as he came to collect some mail from an owl.
“Australia, my card” Brain didn’t want to go into detail in front of the muggles so he handed over a card containing all his information from owl address to floo to phone number.
One, don’t go to other potion masters for potion – the twins know they can produce high quality potions and many of them. They don’t trust the abilities of other potions masters unless they knew how skilled they were … while Severus understands the territorial instinct he did unintentionally stepped on their toes by creating potions for Julian through his involvement with Gringotts.
“you are welcome” Severus said and followed Narcissa up to the boy’s room. He looked over Draco who was happily playing with his toys. When the Lady Malfoy stepped out to check on an owl carrying a letter that flew passed the window and presumably up to the owl roost Severus stepped into the office quickly. He pulled out the orb and pressed it against the old brown book he saw before. The runes hummed for a second meaning it did indeed pull out a soul piece. After hiding the orb in his pocket he examined the book. There was nothing actually written in the book, but there was a faded inscription of someone’s initials …
Darkness consumed him as the door was shut …
“Yeah, that’ll need to be handled right away … I’ll change first.” Harry said s he glanced at his bloody clothes. Right now he was more concerned with the injured werewolf and the babies than his clothes, but now that everyone seems ok it’s time to clean up and, of course, fix the windows. Lyra and Libra were getting irritated having all the glass from the windows everywhere, after all.
Brian stopped in front of the older headmaster with a pleasant smile “Severus, Silvia and Sophia asked me to tell you not to worry about them if you don’t see them at meals. They have a house elf of their own so they’ll have food” he said and leaned closer to Dumbledore while losing his smile “there was an unstable issue, but that was handled … oh and we won’t be staying for any meals either. Once you explain that Julian isn’t a Hogwarts student we will leave” he said and smiled before walking away. The blonde headmaster had a hunch he just hit a nerve …
Severus smirked “is that so? I will be happy to assist him. I could use the laugh”
One blue petal was placed in the bottom of one vial …
“you can speak to her too Daddy?” Harry said in confusion. His Daddy said Aster could speak the language, but him too.
Too late to turn back now though …
Griphook seemed to fall silent and almost looked concerned “a height restorer is only used in extreme cases of abuse” Harry flinched, he didn’t tiptoe as well as he thought “were you abused? Answer honestly, it may help in the future if you decide to take it to court” Harry nodded tentatively “are you still being abused?”
Pushing away the irritation he felt for the oversight he went back to reading the charms book in his right hand. He could feel the bones mend slowly, but faster than naturally for sure. In fact once the sun went down he could use his left hand so he opened the cupboard and gave Hedwig her favorite treats … and he reluctantly pulled out his homework too.
“not bad Cache, you healed your first cut!” Poppy praised.
“actually occamies don’t use names to identify themselves … it makes it tricky for me to know who‘s talking to who even with parseltongue, but this guy is different from the others that live around here. He is the biggest we’ve seen by far, but has been no trouble. I think he came here a month ago … yeah, just appeared for no reason as if he was waiting for someone. This would explain a lot” one member of the group said with an amused smile.
Narcissa tweaked her son’s ear gently “remember your manners Draco” she scolded softly, though normally she wouldn’t scold her son at all, but this person was here to help. Cache just seemed amused as Draco blushed softly and mumbled a nearly unheard sorry. Draco stiffened as the large striped kneazle padded over to him.
Then there was that strange Quidditch issue … Ron was rambling about how amazing Quidditch is and Harry decided to be honest … he loved flying, but didn’t care for the game and wanted to quit. Again barely a few minutes passed before he was called to the headmaster’s office. Dumbledore was smiling just saying that he wanted to make sure Harry was adjusting ok. After the quick pleasantries the subject somehow changed to flying and Quidditch where he was informed that if he loved flying he had to stay on the team because he can’t fly around the school or in the muggle world.
Remus winced and looked up at the blonde man Severus gestured to “Brian … Brian White? As in Julian’s father?” he said nervously realizing that they were right in front of the very person who could take Julian away from them and Sirius already showed how unstable he is.
