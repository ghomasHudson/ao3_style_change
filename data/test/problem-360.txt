Harry reaches in front of him and gripped Draco's now pulsating cock, and started rubbing it in Time with his thrusts.
"I love you too." He whispered. "Now get up! I have a surprise." He said throwing the covers off us. I watched his perfect arse as he walked to our bathroom to get ready.
Harry had been waiting for Draco for an hour, and he was starting to worry. He had called 3 times and sent numerous messages, but still no reply. He decided to try calling the agency.
"Jump." Harry whispered into Draco's ear as he began to suck and nibble the lobe. Draco obliged and wrapped his long legs around Harry's hips. He could feel Harry's tip against his arse, and It drove him crazy.
"Yes, you should and no you shouldn't. I mean, fuck, call him tonight. You don't seem to have a problem waking people up at this hour." Pansy sassed.
"One more finger. I don't want to hurt you." Harry slid his fingers back into Draco's hole adding the last one and scissoring him open. When he was satisfied, he grabbed some extra lube and slicked up his cock.
When they got back to Draco's flat Harry apparated back to his place and changed and grabbed his things for tomorrow just in case Draco wanted him to stay the night again. When he got back to Draco's flat Draco was still doing his hair.
"Shh, it’ll be okay. I'm going to figure that out and keep you safe." He cupped Draco's cheek and tilted his face so he could look into his eyes, "Draco I need you to know something and I don't want you to just say it back to me."
Draco flirtatiously moved so his arms were folded on the side of the tub and his chin was resting on his forearm. "Do you want to get in with me?" Draco giggled.
"You can take it." Draco removed his fingers and lined up his cock. He slid it in harder than he wanted to, making Harry arch his back and scream. He gripped Harry's throat lightly and made him bend backwards a bit so he could whisper in his ear. "Are you okay?" He asked.
"Well what would you like to eat? I'll get you anything you'd like." Draco nuzzled his face into Harry's hair and smiled at the sent.
"Please move, Harry!" Harry started thrusting in and out slowly and first but gradually picking up speed. Soon he was pounding Draco's sensitive spot, making him scream in pleasure.
Harry gently bit Draco's lip making him moan. He took the opportunity to snake his tongue into Draco's mouth, which made Draco moan more. They fought for dominance, but Harry won.
"I told you I'd come back to you." Harry kisses Draco's head. He was so happy to be holding his man again.
Harry pulled away for a second and wiped Draco's tears away. "I will believe you." He said deeply looking into Draco's eyes. Draco fell back into his arms.
He followed the directions the woman had given him and soon he was standing in front of room 202. He took a moment to compose himself before timidly knocking.
"Yes, master."  Harry said. Draco raised his wand and the ropes wrapped themselves around Harry's arms and legs locking him in place. He felt Draco's hands move along his back and down to his ass. He felt Draco grab the vibrator and slowly pull it out. He moaned as he did.
"Damn, you're so sexy!" Harry exclaimed. Draco giggled and Harry could see a little bit of blush under neither his white mask. "You respond like no one calls you that."
Draco leaned back and gently pulled Harry's face towards him so he could whisper in his ear. "Touch me."
"You think this isn't real?" He just looked at our shoes. "Draco, I am sure without a doubt that I love you, and I have never in my life felt this way for another person, and it’s not just because you are taking care of me. It all of you. I have never met anyone as caring, as witty, as... beautifully perfect as you." He slowly looked at me through his shimmering blond eyelashes and a smile grew on his face. It was the most marvelous thing I had ever seen, and it sent my heart flustering in my chest.
"Well I kind of can't tell you that, he will, but first I've sent over some extra confidentiality forms. you have to read through them sign and give them to him when you meet up."
"Did I ever tell you I love hearing you say my first name? Makes me feel like I’m in a dream, and if I am, I never want to wake up." Harry said as he started serving the chicken Parmesan. Draco giggled in response. "Now let’s eat before it gets cold."
If this had happened years ago, I would have panicked, but instead and smile crept across my face and I rolled over pressing my face to the firm chest beside me. I felt Draco begin to stir.
Harry laughed, "That didn't exactly work out all that great." He put his hand on Draco's without realizing it.
"No, love, I just gave you a few shoves. This was all you, and I am so proud of you." He kissed me passionately and wiped a tear from my eye.
Draco started kissing and biting his neck while thrusting his hips forward making Harry a moaning mess.
"I guess, but I’m going to be awfully sad about it." Harry sighed and pretended to be sad. Draco giggled and gave him a shove which made Harry laugh.
A tear slipped down Draco's cheek. He was so happy. He was kind of mad that Harry didn't wake him, but this note was so sweet it made him forget about it. He got up and took a shower. The entire time he thought about Harry. Every time he thought about the night before it would send shivers down his spine. It was now his sexiest memory.
I wanted to write this because this has been something that's been on my mind for awhile. It was inspired by two of my favorite songs, One More Light and Heavy, Both by Linkin park. I just wanted you guys to know, and for all of you out there that need to hear this there is always a reason to keep fighting, and there will always be help to those who need it.
I was standing over his body. His angelic white skin now covered in blood. He wasn't breathing, and soon Snape was pushing me away and kneeling by his side.
"George? I wasn't expecting you. I said wiping my hands on a dish towel. "Come in. Would you like to stay for dinner?"
"Gods, you are an angel." I whispered as it felt like my face was gravitating to his. He opened his eyes at the feeling of my breath against his lips, only to have them flutter shut as I closed the distance. His lips against mine were the most amazing thing I have ever felt. The way they moved the way they tasted, the way his hand found its way into my hair pulling me in deeper, all of it was perfect. We pulled apart panting hard, from the passion.
Draco pauses for a minute. He wasn't sure if he loved Harry. He had obsessed over him all through school, but he wasn't sure if the feelings he had for him were love. Then again, he didn't think he had ever felt love. Maybe a little from his mother, not romantic love.
He didn't catch up to him till Draco was at the gates of Hogwarts. "Draco, please wait up!" He called to him. Draco turned to face him with his arms crossed and Harry could see the moon light reflect of the tears on his cheek.
We talked a little while longer then they left after checking to make sure harry was okay. He was still fast asleep.  I let my head fall against the back of my arm chair for a moment as I ran through a list of everything that I needed to do, but my thoughts were soon interrupted by muffled screaming. I jumped from my chair and ran to Harry's room.
"I'll take that." Harry smiled big; He was so happy to know Draco at least cared about him enough to have feelings. "Draco, love, can I kiss..." Before he could finish his sentence, Draco closed the space between them and gently crashed their lips together. It was a soft and sweet kiss. Draco's hand found its way into Harry's hair, as Harry cupped his face. His other hand slid around to the small of Draco's back pulling him closer.
"You are making this so difficult you know?" He smiled as they got into bed and Draco curled up in his arms.
Being a male escort wasn't so bad. At Least he had a high price and only high-class people could afford him. Although he did get the occasional older person, he could usually tough it out. He mostly had ministry officials and celebrities. The type of people he was used to associating with. That’s why the underground company he worked for was happy to hire him.
Harry laid down on the bed watching Draco's every movement. Draco got up out of his chair and started undoing the rest of the buttons on his shirt. He slid it off then looped his fingers in his trousers and pants and slipped them off as well. Harry couldn't remove his eyes from Draco's naked form. He was so tall and lean that it made Harry's mouth water and his cock twitch. Draco approached the bed and flicked his wand. Harry was flipped over, the restraints magically wrapped themselves around his wrists and ankles, and the wedge was placed under his hips, so his ass was in the air. Draco whispered another spell and a silver band appeared tightly around Harry's cock.
"Such a nice way to say good morning." I smiled into the nape of his neck and could feel him smiling against my head.
Harry cupped Draco's face and tilted it so he could look into Draco's eyes. "Can I kiss you, Draco?"
"With all my being, I've been crushing on you since we were in school." Harry gave Draco a small smile. Draco looked extremely happy, before a wave of sadness washed over his face.
Within second, they were both shaking though their orgasms. Harry collapsed to the bed and whispered a quick cleaning spell.
"Come in. Give me just a second to get dressed." I said gesturing to the living room on my way back to my bedroom.
"Harry?" I said gently, and I touched his shoulder. He continued to stare at his shoes. "Would you like me to show you to your room, so you can rest?" He silently ponders for a moment before nodding and I led him to the guest room leaving Ron and Hermione in the kitchen.
"Harry, who's...?" He heard Draco begin to ask from behind him. He looked over his shoulder to see Draco frozen with fear.
Draco smiled and shook his head. This guy was the complete opposite of smooth, but he liked it. "That was a cheesy save."
"I think I heard something about that through the grape vine. I think I also heard you came out as gay. Is that true too?" Draco blushed again.
The day they had to let Griffin go was the worst day of they're lives. He was 15 years old and was suffering for kidney failure. He laid on the table, both Draco and Harry petting him and crying, purring away because he knew he was loved and that he'd see his friends again someday.
"Thank you, Harry." Draco whispered. They got lost in each other’s eyes for a minute. Till Harry shook his head and Draco looked away shyly.
"Yes, master. What are we going to do first?" Draco smirked at this question as he thought of all the things, he'd love to do to Harry.
"Does that answer your question?" Harry whispered in Draco's ear and bit the lobe. Draco let out a loud moan which went straight to Harry's cock. Harry spun them around and pushed Draco against the wall. He looked Draco in the eye searching for approval which Draco gave in the form of a nod.
"He came into the pub one night and we got to talking, and, Pansy... He said I’ve been his biggest crush since he laid eyes on me." Draco giggled.
"Thank you." As he brushed my cheek there was a knock on the door and I jumped. He smiled, "Are you ready?"
"I decided I'd let you choose and I would happily get the lion if that's what you wanted." I laughed and kissed his nose.
Teddy face changed to one of focus as his hair went from turquoise to red then to violet then to platinum blond like Scorpius's and Draco's.
He was now sitting by Harry's bed reading out loud to him and holding his hand. Hermione had just left and Draco was taking advantage of the alone time with Harry. He knew it wasn't much but he felt like Harry could hear him, so reading to him made home feel closer. He was so enveloped in the book he hadn't noticed Harry starting to stir.
"Now we should get up, we have guests coming at noon and you, my dear, need a shower and some food." He smiled and got out of bed. leaving me missing the feeling of his warm body.
"What was that?" The bartender asked. Draco continued to press the butting making it difficult for Harry to think.
Draco pressed his clothed, hard cock against Harry's bare ass, teasing him. With a hand still on his throat he whispered in Harry's ear again, "what did you learn? What do you call me?"
"Oops, busted!" Harry laughed. Draco laughed in return. They both picked up the plates of food and walked them over to the Breakfast table.
"I haven't been happy for quite a while. You don't even make me cum anymore. I'm sorry Ginny. You just can't satisfy me anymore." Harry realized how harsh he sounded after the words left him.
"Yes." I replied in a loud whisper as well, not letting my eyes leave Draco's face. He smiled, and I giggled as it was the first time, I had ever seen him blush. It was by far the most gorgeous thing I had ever seen.
Draco started to cry, "Yeah, I'll be there as fast as I can." He said trying to hide the quiver in his voice.
When they got inside, they were immediately under fire, as curses they'd never heard of were slung at them. He watched as the other two Aurors were hit and both fell to the floor. It was just him now. He flipped a table over and continued firing back. He could see there were 8 of them. He was completely out numbered.
"Yes." Draco moaned. Harry began pushing himself into Draco, slowly filling him up. Draco arched his back and let out a loud groan.
With one hand and while still moving his hips Harry started unbuttoning Draco's shirt. Once done he sat up bringing Draco with him and slipped it off. Without skipping a beat Draco grabbed Harry's shirt and ripped it off. Buttons flying everywhere.
"Harry!" Scorpius yelled as Harry came through the fireplace first. Draco smiled up from his book, but Harry notice his eyes seemed off. Scorpius got up to give Harry a hug but stopped when he saw Teddy come through the fireplace too. "Who's this Harry?"
"Look at me." Draco demanded. Potter obliged. "Undo my trousers." Harry unbuttoned Draco's trousers. "Now pull my cock out." Shaking, Harry stuck his hand into Draco's pants, gently gripped Draco's cock and removed it from his trousers. He was amazed at how long it was. Long, throbbing and pink. Without being told he scooted forward a little and licked the tip, tasting Draco's pre-cum. Draco couldn't help himself, he threw his head back and moaned. Draco's moan sent chills through Harry’s body, going straight to his own cock. He took Draco's tip into his mouth and swirled his tongue around it. Draco had to fight the urge to grip Harry's hair and throat fuck him. He figured since this was Harry's first blow job that that wouldn't be a good idea. He settled for clawing at the arms of his chair.
"No of course not. It's just if you keep going, I won’t be able to stop myself and I don't know if we should go all the way on our first date." Harry brushed Draco's cheek.
"For your information, I've always cared, and I care even more now that he's my boyfriend!" Ron's jaw hit the floor and he was left speechless. Hermione was equally shocked but hid it well.
"Well not entirely." Draco winked. Harry blushed a little he never thought Draco would flirt with him. "I also know you a lot more than my other clients and I wanted to catch up."
"Well, I guess I was married to the job more than her so, she left me. Now that I think about it, I'm kind of glad she did." Harry looked deep into Draco's stormy grey eyes and felt himself start to get lost until he realized the adorable blush spreading across the pale cheeks. His vision found its way to his elegant pink lips and he found himself wondering if they would taste like butter beer.
Once Draco was satisfied with Harry's mouth he pulled away and started kissing, licking, and nibbling Harry's neck. Harry let out another moan, but something inside of him didn't sit right. He was afraid Draco would regret this in the morning if they went any farther. "Draco, are you sure this is what you want?" He asked.
"We've done all we can to help him, so we can't blame ourselves, but maybe it's not us he needs. Maybe we're not trying the right things." Ron sounded wiser than ever, for once. We went back to sitting in silence while I thought.
Harry gave him his address and took Griffin out into the living room to wait. It was my long till there was a knock on the door. Harry's heart began to race as he opened the door.
"Thank you, Draco." I barley heard as it was muffled by the blankets. I turned off his light and joined Ron and Hermione in the kitchen. I poured myself a cup of coffee and let out a small sigh.
"Well I was thinking of taking you to dinner, but I kind of don't want you to get dressed up. So, what if I go get some groceries and I cook you something?" Harry suggested.
They walked down multiple hallways until they came to a door which Miguel unlocked with a skeleton key. The site before Harry sent a rage though out his body.
"Harry, I was so scared. Granma said I might not be able to see you for a long time." He pulled away and I looked at his sweet face, tears welling in his eyes. How could I do that to this sweet little boy? I asked myself. I forced the thoughts away and gave him my best smile.
I held him tighter, "Please, Harry, y-you have to forgive yourself, for that day. Y-you didn't mean to do it, a-and I-I can't lose you." I buried my tear-soaked face into his soft hair.
"I'll be up in a minute to tuck you in." Draco called up after him as he helped Harry pick up the toys.
"I know but I didn't think he was capable of it either until we were married." Draco was crying so hard he could barely breath.
"Yeah, you just seem so different, and I can't quite put my finger on the reason why." The way Harry said this sent a shock through Draco's body and he let the smile on his face grow.
"Tonight, I'm going to test your endurance. Your job is to not orgasm unless told you can. Any questions?" Draco asked.
"Well, yeah. Freshly divorced, but don't even think about its Harry. He treated you like shit in school." Hermione warned.
Draco grabbed at the mark on his arm and harry noticed, "well it’s kind of har to get any other job with this. I did try, but I was turned down everywhere I went. I was shut off from the family fortune and I left the mansion, so I needed something, and this just happened to be the first thing to accept me. I make good money though."
"Yep! Pretty easy huh? I'm Guessing you're a..." Harry paused and pretended to think hard, "A Hufflepuff."
Draco got super close and with a serious look in his eye that Harry found insanely sexy, so much so that he was hard again, Draco whispered, "Dear, after the orgasm you just gave me my stomach couldn't handle any food."
"You can't die. You promised you'd come back to me." He whispered. A nurse walked in and started checking his vitals.
Harry brushed the Hair of Draco's cheek. "You're so perfect you know that? Can I ask you something?"
Harry felt a tingling on his cock that slowly got stronger and stronger till he was gripping the sheets.
"Hey Harry! It's Draco! I got your number from the receptionist. I hope you don't mind. I just couldn't stay away." He heard Draco's excited voice.
"Oh...my...Harry...more." He moaned, and I obeyed thrusting in another finger and waiting for him to adjust before making a slow scissoring motion. I sucked him as gently as I could, giving him just enough friction to merely tease him.
"Come on Ron let leave them alone." She said calmly as she guided Ron to the waiting room. "I'm sorry Draco."
"I like when you put me on my knees." Ginny had heard enough so she slammed the front door alerting Harry that she was home. "Damn I got to go. Ginny’s home. I'll see you Saturday. Goodbye Draco." Harry whispered.
Harry began thrusting in and out, slowly at first but gradually picking up speed. Soon he was pounding into Draco, making him grip the bed sheets. Soon he found Draco's prostate and continuously hit it until Draco was screaming in pleasure.
"That is the most beautiful sound I've ever heard you make." Harry whispered as he pulled away. Draco didn't stop though he kissed his way down to Harry's neck and started biting and licking till Harry let out a loud moan.
"Auror Potter?" A nurse said. "We can't find anything wrong with him. As far as we can tell he's just sleeping, but to be on the safe side maybe he should stay with you for a few nights to be sure. Once he awakens of course."
"Draco! Oh merlin! What have I done?!" I heard him hell he rushed to help me up but stopped when he saw the blood. I could finally see straight and looked up to see his vacant expression. In seconds he was running into the bathroom adjacent to his room. I stumbled after him, not liking the look I saw in his eyes. A loud crash shook the lasts bit of dizziness from my brain and I ran to him.
"So why did I need a tux?" Draco asked as he sat down at the other end of the couch harry was sitting on.
"It's not fair that you've cum twice and I haven't even been touched." He gently grabbed Harry's face, " suck." He ordered.
Draco was stunned. The way Harry had said his name and the feeling of his warm breath on his neck sent something through his body he never expected, and he could feel his trousers growing tight. He just kept blinking, trying to figure out what he was feeling, so he could shake it away. He decided it would be best if he just made his way back to his room.
"It's Harry, He was attacked and he won't stop asking for you." Draco could tell she's been crying. "Draco can you come to St. Mungo's. I don't know if he's going to make it this time."
"He doesn't see that as enough. All he sees is the fact you were almost part of the blood shed and directly by his hand. He also regrets not reaching out to you. He thinks he could have done so much more to save you from the torment you endured, if he hadn't been so intent on being your mortal enemy."
"Oh, fuck Harry! How are you doing this!?" Draco yelled in pleasure. Harry didn't answer just inserted another finger. He spat on Draco's hole lubing it up more so he could add another finger. "I don't know if I can take much more!" Draco moaned.
"Yes, it's me, love. I'm here, he's gone." He wrapped both of them in his arms. "Everything is going to be okay."
"Ah well, in that case I’ll set you up with The Master as we call him. He does everything except excrement play, and he's really knows how to work a beginner. He'll have you coming back for more!" Zachary exclaimed.
"I always do after care afterward, to make sure you are okay." Draco said making a point to make sure Harry understood.
"He'll see you in his office." The first bouncer said and the second lead him through the door. Inside there was a massive stair case and multiple hallways with red doors lining the walls. It looked like a hotel. Harrys but wrenched, he knew Draco was in one of these rooms.
"No, master." Harry said as he stood and slowly started unbuttoning his shirt. He started staring at the floor again.
"Look if you're going to ridicule me, I’m just going to leave." Draco finally said as he turned to leave, but a hand grabbed his arm.
"Draco, of course I did. I've never felt this strongly for someone in my life." He cupped Draco's face trying to get him to look at him, but he refused.
Harry thought he could feel his heart breaking. He was sure Draco had felt everything he had, but Maybe he had been wrong. He was so confused. He decided to sleep on it.
"H-harry if you k-keep this up, I'm not going to be able to stop myself." I pulled him in for another searing kiss pushing myself hard against him, just to make him moan.
"Mm, yes." Draco said as he slowly laid back and rested his head on Harry's chest. He could feel every inch of Harry's hard member against his back. "Fuck." Draco said under his breath.
He had just gotten home from his last assignment, with a man from the ministry. He didn't have a pretty face, but he did have a decent enough body, and he didn’t want long crazy sex just someone to sleep with. A lot of his clients were just lonely and in need of company, maybe that’s why he grew to like his job. Because he was lonely too.
"I needed to talk to you, and I asked your mother. Is Scorpius in bed?" Harry looked even more sheepish.
"I liked you all through school, but I hated you because I knew I could never have you. I was so mean to you." He looked away.
I began to scream. It was all I could do. I was screaming and pulling my hair as I fell to the ground and crawled to hi side.
It had been 3 months since the hospital and Draco was finally healing from the ordeal. He started seeing a mind healer and Harry was there to support him the whole time. He moved into 12 Grimmauld place with Harry, and They were happy.
I was just finishing up by placing the last of his clothes in the dresser when there was a knock on the door. I opened it revealing a smiling Hermione, a skeptical looking Ron and an incredibly frail looking Harry. Never have I been so thrilled and yet so heartbroken in my life. I was over the moon knowing the man I had been in love with for years would be under my roof where I could protect him, but the sight of him before me now completely shattered my heart.
Soon it felt like he was trudging through mud and it got worse the close he got. He refused to give up though. Not seeing Draco again would be worse than death. He trudged on finally he was just in tech of the light. He could see Draco on the other side. Draco reach through and took his hand pulling him through.
Harry moaned and gripped the sheet as Draco pulled his trousers and boxers down just enough to show his ass.
"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I don't see how anyone could have done that to you. You're just so perfect." Harry took Draco's hand and started rubbing soothing circles on the back of it.
"Mm, Harry I need more." Draco whispered. Once out of the tub He pulled Draco in for a deep kiss, and walked them into Draco's bedroom. When they reached the bed, he laid Draco down and took a minute to admire his naked form.
"Bacon and eggs. There's coffee too, if you want some." Draco said turning around and wrapping his arms around Harry. He leaned down and kissed Harry gently. "How'd you sleep."
Throughout dinner they talked about all sorts of stuff; the war, Draco's parents, Ron and Hermione, and they just got on the subject of the Dursleys when they started cleaning up.
"Yes master." Harry said and he straddled Draco. Draco lined up his cock and Harry slowly sat down on it. Draco threw his head back as Harry bottomed out.
"Gods yes, harry. Please touch me." Something about him begging fogged my brain and I tore his pants away with on swift motion. Not even surprised to see he wasn't wearing underwear. I let my eye s trace his now completely naked body, he was so hard for me, and that alone could have been enough to tip me over the edge, but I restrained myself.
It was Sunday night and Harry was lying in bed scrolling through Instagram again. He was kind of addicted. Suddenly he noticed Draco posted. He pulled it up and nearly passed out. The picture was one of the sexiest of Draco he had ever seen. It was in black and white and Draco was lying on a red chaise lounge chair in just black satin boxers Griffin was laying on the end of the lounge chair looking regal as ever.
"Harry, you are perfect to me. You are and have always been the most beautiful creature I've ever laid eyes on, and I do care about you. Harry I've loved you for years. I've loved you since I first laid eyes on you. I hadn't known it at the time, but the more I watched you, the more I saw your colors show the deeper I fell. You have always and will always mean the world to me."
"T-thank you." Draco closed his eyes tightly then realizing he wouldn't be able to do this without crying he got up and left without another word.
"Oh, that's sad! I remember when we lost our dog when I was little. I was heartbroken!" Hermione said. "Dinners ready."
"Shall we move this to the living room? This is the first time I've met my aunt and cousin." Draco laughed as he led Andromeda to the living room. I began to follow with Teddy still on my hip.
"I promise, Scorpius, He's not going to get anywhere near you or your father. I'm going to protect you both." Harry held onto both of them and let them cry until Scorpius fell asleep in his arms. "Let's get you both to bed." He whispered.
"f-faster." He begged. I began to pick up speed till sounds of skin harshly slapping skin filled the room.
Harry pulled Draco in for one last soft and loving kiss as he pulled out and then collapsed to the bed. He pulled their sweaty bodies together and tried to catch his breath.
"Baby, I'm going to take care of you. I'm sure I can help you get a new job, or you live here and be my personal escort forever." He kissed Draco’s neck which made him moan.
"Oh god yeah! Keep doing that!" Draco moaned. His thrusts started getting sloppier. "Harry, I'm going to cum! Cum with me!" He screamed as he unloaded into Harry and Harry did the same all over the two of them.
Today Harry was taking Draco to the hospital again to test for any std's. Draco was incredibly nervous. He couldn't stop fidgeting the whole way there.
"It's okay. It's all over now." Harry smiled and patted Draco's hands. "So, did you date anyone before this?"
Draco pointed his wand at Harry’s cock and whispered a spell Harry had never heard of. A blue light came out of Draco's wand and as soon as it hit a tingling sensation spread along Harry’s shaft to the head of his cock and made Harry arch his back in pleasure. He became a writhing mess on the sheets and after only a few minutes of this he finally shouted, "Draco, I’m going to cum!" Draco stop abruptly.
" Do you want me to stay until you fall asleep?" Harry asked. Draco just nodded again. So, Harry sat on the edge of the bed and gently stroked Draco's back until he fell asleep. Then he flooed back to his house.
"What are you crying about? Clean yourself up. No one likes a crying slut. Well not before the fun starts." Miguel laughed at his own cruel joke, as Draco wiped his face and tried to show some courage.
"Now get on your knees in front of me." Miguel commanded. Draco just sat there in defiance. Miguel started to get angry and grabbed him by the hair and forced Draco to the ground. He let out a yelp as his knees were pressed into the carpet and his hair was being pulled so he was facing Miguel.
"M-master." Harry replied. Draco let go and sat down in his chair taking another sip of his whiskey.
"No, dear, I’m not laughing. Please stay come in and talk for a while. You don't have to stay the whole night but please give me that." He sounded so sincere and Draco did find that pout irresistibly adorable. Draco nodded and harry took his hand and led him to a cozy little living room, then accioed something. "I know you don't care much for muggle clothing, but I don't think you want to wear that tux all night." he handed him a t shirt and jeans and a pair of house shoes. "There's a bathroom over there."
He was waiting for a text describing his next assignment when his phone started ringing. His boss usually never called unless it was something big.
That night he flooed over to Draco's after Scorpius had gone to bed. "Hi, love." He said as he entered the living room.
"Shh I won't let that happen. I'm here to protect you and Scorpius. It could also just be a rumor. I'll find out for sure from the ministry when I go into work on Monday. What's his name?"
Draco was still in the shower when harry finished his fire call and was getting ready to make pancakes. He was just pulling out a pan when there was a knock on the door. He decided it'd be best if he got it, and he was glad he did. He opened the door to see a broad shoulders dark haired man. The man eyed him up and down, taking note of his pajamas.
He was a ghost of himself hidden in the shell of his body. I had never seen him this broken before. I was so used to the brave and strong boy I knew I school. The one filled with so much determination it made his beautiful green eyes glow, but the man in front of me right now was nothing but a shadow of that. Those emerald green eyes were pale now and filled with unspeakable amounts of pain and guilt.
"Who said I didn't want to do this? This has been one of my biggest fantasies since school." Draco whispered in Harry's ear. Harry could feel his breath on his neck and he was amazed at how hard he already was. "Do you want this?" Draco asked.
"So much trouble! Professor Snape was furious! We had been seen by 7 muggles and down damage to a tree that had been on the grounds, 'since before we were born!'" Both Harry and Draco laughed at Harry's poor imitation of Snape.
"This is crazy!" Harry said staring in disbelief. He picked up his phone and started a message to Draco. He didn't know how to start this conversation. It had been so long since they talked it felt weird. So, he went with "Hey Draco."
It was one of the newest pictures of Griffin and it read; "Guys I really need your help! Griffin got out yesterday and he's nowhere to be found. I'm so afraid for him. He's never been outside his yard and his previous owners had him declawed. If you've seen him please contact me. I can't lose him forever. I love him so much."
Harry sat there for a few moments before realizing what just happened. Then got up and ran after Draco.
"We decided it would be best to have an auror look after you just to be sure you're alright, Mr. Malfoy." The nurse said.
Harry hadn't even notice who he had sat next to until, "Also this year, we have a new Matron. Draco Malfoy." McGonagall spoke and Harry froze in his seat as he felt the person next to him shake their head and sand up to acknowledge the crowd.
"I-I-I-b-but I was so mean to you." Draco had tears welling up in his eyes at the thought of Harry caring about him no matter what insult he threw at him.
"Draco, you’re ready. You're back on your feet and the Blaise thing was years ago. Things with Harry will be completely different. I don't think Harry's the cheating type like Blaise was. Besides, if he has wanted you like you wanted him for as long as he says, he's going to do everything he can to keep you." Pansy said comfortingly.
"Ugh might as well come in. I'm not even close to being ready." Draco said opening the door so Harry could come in.
Harry apparated to the club and walked through it like he owned the place. He was so confident and excited. He reached room 202 and knocked on the door.
"So, tell me why you're following me." The blond said. By his voice alone Harry could tell it was Draco.
"Well..." Hermione tried to say but looked like she was having a hard time finding the question. Pansy placed a hand on her knee and proceeded to speak for her.
I gave him a smile and a nod. "He's in his room." I pointed him down the hall and he nodded his thanks.
"I'm really not sure. I guess I kind of believe that this is the love I deserve after all I've done." Harry suddenly found the table very interesting.
Draco turned so he was on his knees with his hands on the tub behind Harry, so he could look into Harry's eyes. Harry looked surprised, as he moved his hands to Draco's waist.
He sat under the dim lamb light contemplating calling the number on the card. He finally gave in and dialed the number.
"Oh I'm... Malfoy?" He said as he looked up to meet the gaze of the blond hair, blue eyed man. He was absolutely stunned to see the man he had been crushing on for years.
"Harry!" Teddy yelled as he came through the fire place. Andromeda followed with a scowl on her face.
"I want you so badly." Draco moaned as harry laid him on the bed. Harry pushed his hip against Draco she he could feel how hard he made him.
Hungrily Harry attacked Draco's lips. Kissing him with so much lust it took Draco's breath away. Harry sucked Draco's lip into his mouth and lightly bit it making Draco whimper in pleasure. He took the opportunity to insert his tongue and taste every inch of Draco's mouth. Draco was loving every bit of it. Not many people dominated him like this, and it felt so good.
"Can I see the scar I left on your chest?" Harry asked with a sad look on his face. without warning Draco slowly got up and straddled Harry's hips then as teasingly as he could, removed his shirt. Harry watched in amazement as Draco revealed the long pink scar. He slowly reached up and touched it, letting his hands slowly caress Draco’s body and wrap around to his back. he pulled him in closer and without losing eye contact left little kissed all over the scar.
"I love you too daddy.'' Scorpius snuggled into his bed as Draco began to leave the room turning off the lights behind him. "Daddy?" Scorp said before he closed the door."
"Draco Malfoy! He was taking his son trick or treating. He makes cute kids, I'll tell you that! Oh, and man, that ass!" Harry yelled.
Harry was internally freaking out, but he nodded his agreement and went to Draco's bed side. He put his hand on Draco's arm and in that instance his eyes started to flutter open.
"Yes please, I feel so much safer when you are around." Draco snuggled against harry chest and Harry squeezed him tightly.
As I read it I couldn't fight my tears any more and one slipped down my cheek. "How could he feel this? How could he be so hurt?" Was all I could think. I looked back to Hermione who was finally pulling herself back together enough to speak.
Three days passed since I went and saw him in the hospital, and it was finally the day he was to be released. Hermione and Ron were picking him up while I made a few final preparations to my guest room. Removing anything that might be used to cause harm to himself and making sure he would have anything he might need.
"Just a minute." came a very familiar voice. Draco stood there with wide eyes hoping he hadn't heard it and thinking about running. He'd be fired for sure, though so he stayed and waited for what felt like forever but was merely a few seconds. Soon the door opened revealing exactly what he feared but more cut and handsome also dressed in a well-fitting tux that show the beautiful curvature of hid fit body he now wore a short well-kept beard and contacts, but his dark messy hair and emerald green eyes still remained the same.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he licked his lips and used his fingers to get what he couldn't reach, sucking the cum off them as well.
When Harry woke up Draco wasn’t in bed with him. He heard the shower running so he laid back and waited for his lover to emerge.
Draco felt Harry's member hit that sensitive spot inside him and he let out a sharp cry as he arched his back in pleasure.
"To be my dom. We had sex last night." Harry looked at the floor. He didn't want to see the tears that were starting to flow from Ginny's eyes.
"I... can't." Draco looked down at his glass. Too scared to look Harry in the eyes. "I'm sorry Harry."
"Draco?! I'm so happy you did! I haven't stopped thinking about you since Saturday! You're even in my damn dreams!" Harry blushed realizing he may have over shared.
"Good boy. You've earned a reward." Draco said as he undid his tie and slipped out of his suit jacket. he folded them and sat them on the chair, then undid just the first few buttons of his shirt, and rolled up his sleeves. He leaned down on the bed and got up close to Harry's ear. Harry was expecting to be touched, but instead Draco whispered, "But for teasing me I'm not going to touch you yet. First, I'm going to tie you down and use a few spells on you and you're not going to cum until I tell you to. If you do, you'll be punished some more."
"So did you." Harry kissed Draco's head, as he reached for his wand and waved a quick cleaning spell. Then they both fell asleep in each other’s arms.
Draco added another finger and started moving them faster, repeatedly hitting Harry's sensitive spot. Harry screamed in pleasure.
Draco leaned forward and kissed him, so Harry pulled him closer. Soon Draco was on Harry's lap and Harry was grabbing his hips.
The bartender gave him a weird look and walked away. He looked at Draco who was smirking at him the whole time.
"Me too." Draco pumped a few more times before both him and Harry were rolling in ecstasy. They both shook in each other's arms, kissing tenderly, for what felt like an eternity.
Draco smacked his ass hard and said, "No, not yet." He added another finger, really stretching Harry's tight, tight hole.
"Who that, daddy?" Harry heard a little voice say. he looked down to see a five-year-old version of Malfoy clutching onto Draco's pant leg.
"I'm having a pretty rough time to be honest. I'm in a custody battle with Andromeda over my godson, Teddy." Harry placed his hands in his pockets and kicked a rock in front of him.
"Me too." I said before kissing him passionately. I trailed my hand down his side and cupped his perfect arse through the thin silk of his pajamas, and he let out a moan. I took the opportunity to flick my tongue inside his mouth and he met me half way. Our tongues seem to dance together elegantly, and I could feel myself twitch in my pants.
Draco leaned forward and whispered in his ear, "for not calling me master...again... I'm going to make you cum right here in front of everyone. Then I'm going to take you back to the room and punish you."
"I want to be with you. I'm done being alone and I want to take you on." Draco couldn't stop smiling. There was just silence for quite a while. "Harry?" Draco asked.
Draco paced back and forth in his room for a while trying to decide what to say. When he thought he'd thought it through enough he finally dialed Harry's number.
"By far the best sleep I've ever got in my life!" Harry exclaimed. as he walked over and poured himself a cup of coffee. "You?"
Everything was starting to crush me again. The weight on my shoulders was heavier now than it ever had been. Even though I was raised with that weight, raised to be a war machine, it felt so much heavier now with every lost soul bearing down on me. I'm suffocating in it.
"Oh, honey, you don't have to repay me. I did this because I wanted to not because I wanted something from you. I'm happy just to be here with you." Harry smiled.
The morning light that was streaming in from the bedroom window flooded into my eyelids and I began to stir. I clenched and unclenched my fist trying to figure out why it hurt. I opened my eyes and was becoming aware of the warm puffs of air fluttering through my hair, and the familiar, strong arm under my head.
"Uh...uhm. Same thing." Harry finally said giving up on trying to think of a drink. "Fuck!" He whispered.
"Throat fuck me!" Harry gasped as he popped Draco's cock out of his mouth for a second. Draco was surprised but happily did as he was told. Pushing Harry down onto his cock till it hit the back of his throat. Harry didn't gag so he started going faster till he was lifting of the bed in wild pleasure.
He was just getting changed into some more comfortable clothes when he heard Harry come through the floo. He ran down stairs and fell into Harry's arms.
"Sure! Would you like me to get you some water and put you to bed again?" Harry said brushing Draco's hair out of his face. Draco nodded again. Harry went to the kitchen, found the glasses then brought Draco the water. After he drank the whole thing, Harry took his hand and led him to his bedroom where he transformed his clothes and tucked him into bed, leaving a kiss on his forehead.
"I love you daddy." My stomach did another flip as I heard his sleepy voice, but this was a good flip. I hugged him back.
Again, once he'd relaxed the tingling sensation was back but this time, he felt something new. Draco's tongue on the head of his cock.
"Now then get cleaned up and put that on." Miguel said pointing to some black booty spandex shorts on the bed. "I'll be back shortly to make sure your ready then it’s time for work."
The waitress came and took their order. Harry got pancakes bacon and eggs and Draco stuck with just coffee.
"A surprise?! Daddy, you never do surprises!" Scorpius exclaimed. Just the fireplace roared, turning bright green, and out stepped Harry carry several grocery bags full of food. "Harry?! What are you doing here?!"
"Ok, I'll check out the files on them and start preparing myself." Harry said cracking his knuckles.
"If you can't take it how will you take my cock?"  Harry whispered leaning across Draco's back. Draco sat up and stared at Harry as he slowly slipped out of his trousers and boxers revealing a massive 9-inch girthy cock.
"What do you need, dear?" Draco asked quietly. Harry felt butterflies flutter in his stomach at the pet name.
Harry started kissing his way down Draco's torso till he reached the hem of Draco's boxers. Then he started biting and sucking on Draco's hips while he slowly pulled off his boxers. He stopped to stare for a minute. "Gods you're so beautiful!" He said.
"It's okay, truly. It was an arranged marriage anyways. So, what about you? I know you were an Auror, but what happened to Weasley?" Draco's stomach was turning at the thought of her touching Harry.
"We'll start with spanking, and if I think you deserve something more, I will tell you first." Draco said. "Any other questions?"
" I'm not going to lie. You should have told her before, but what's done is done and she knows now and both of you can start to heal and find something that makes you happier." Draco's word made Harry feel a little better and he smiled.
"I guess I wasn't good enough for him. I hope I'm good enough for you." Draco was fighting back tears now and Harry could see this.
Draco just smirked and increased the vibration. Harry squirmed in his seat he was so close and doing everything he could not to cum. Draco increased the vibration one more time tipping Harry over the edge with a loud "mmm fuck!"
Draco took out a dragon-hide notebook and wrote down the appointment. "It's a date."  He winked, "I have to head to my next appointment. Will you be ok getting home or do you need me to take you?"
Draco was having a pretty good day at work till close to the end of his shift. He was walking down the halls of St. Mungo's getting ready to file his paperwork for the day when he heard a familiar voice come for the nurse's station.
Draco gave harry a shove and then they cleaned up breakfast and got ready. Soon they were out the door heading to the arcade.
"Shhhh, I have an idea." Harry said wiping Draco tears away again. "Let's put you to bed, then tomorrow after Teddy's in bed I'll come by and, since you told me your story, I'll tell you the story about a boy who lived in a cupboard. Maybe then you'll trust me more. Is that ok." Draco looked puzzled but nodded his head in agreement. Then he led Harry to his room. Harry cast a spell changing Draco’s clothes into pajamas, then tucked him into bed.
"I'd love some!" Harry followed Draco out of the office, down the hall, and into a fairly big kitchen.
"Aunt Andromeda and Teddy." I watched his eyes widen and I could visibly see the fear rise on his face.
He didn't get any sleep that night. He laid in bed tossing and turning thinking about all the what-ifs. He reread the note over and over again, hoping he'd get a call. He finally gave up on sleep and started cleaning his flat hoping that would get his mind of it. That didn't work so he tried watching TV, then exercising, then reading, but nothing worked.
"H-harry, it's ok. It's in the past. I forgave your years ago. If anything, you saved me." He pulled back and wiped some of the tears from my cheeks as he gazed into my eyes. "In more ways than one." There sincerity in his eyes calmed something in me and I fell back into his embrace.
"Wow he likes you. He usually takes a while to warm up to people." Draco said patting griffins head.
I rolled the parchment up and placed it beside me on the table, then picked up the sleeping pills. I didn't deserve such an easy way out. I'm sure I'll pass out before I feel anything, but it was all I could think of now. They were right here after all. I shook all the pills out into my hand, there had to be at least 60.
Harry knelt Infront of him and place Draco’s face in his hands so he could look onto his eyes. " You did nothing to deserve this my love. This is all they're fault."
"No, I took a few months off. This is more important to me and it's not like I can't afford it." I smirked but I know sadness still showed in my eyes.
"It just suits you. You make a very good dom." Harry winked. "I wish I knew what you wanted to do to me back at Hogwarts."
"Fuck yes! Harry! I love your tight little hole! My dirty little slut!"  Draco yelled. He grabbed Harry's head and pulled him down against him still thrusting inside of him. "Do you like when I fuck you, my little slut?"
"Of course, I am! I want to be a father someday, maybe I'll get to be a step-father." Draco giggled as they sat down on the couch.
Before leaving work that night he grabbed the files he needed and went home to start studying. He tried his hardest to focus on the information, but his mind was too preoccupied on blond hair and blue eyes. He would do anything to just touch him right now. Finally, he became overwhelmed by the thought, so he grabbed his coat and headed to the bar Hoping Draco would be there.
"Bye, Harry." He said, and I followed him out of my room. As he was leaving, he turned to Draco. "You better take care good care of him." He said with a wink and Draco let out a breathy laugh.
"Of course, Ron." I said I reached out my hand for him to shake it. He looked as surprised as I had a few moments ago but shook it as we put our differences aside, knowing we now had common ground. Helping Harry.
"That's perfect!" Draco exclaimed. He gave Harry his address Then they bid each other goodnight and went to bed.
"Roll over." Harry whispered as he pulled out. Draco got on all fours with his ass in the air and without warning Harry slammed inside of him once more.
I lifted my hips just slightly pressing my hardness against Draco's, and he let out a sharp whine in need as he pulled away from my mouth.
"D-Draco, your head?" I carded my hand through my hair feeling the puncture wound on my scalp. There must have been a nail in the wall. "c-can I help you?" I nodded, and he turned me around, so he could clean me up and fix the wound.
After Dinner, Harry played trains with Scorpius. Draco couldn't help but smile at the two. He had never seen another person so invested in his son. It made him happy to watch them laugh and play.
"You're taking me to Draco and I'm taking him from this place." Harry growled from behind Miguel. Miguel held his hand up in surrender.
It had been a week since Harry ended up in the hospital, and Draco spent every moment he could there. When he wasn't working or sleeping, he was with Harry.  He spent more time there than Hermione and Ron, whom he was slowly becoming friends with. Well, Hermione at least.
Draco crumpled to the bed, barely able to hold his wand, he whispered a cleaning spell. Then grabbed Harry and pulled him close.
"For that you'll get 4 smacks." Draco would never admit hearing Harry call his name was a huge turn on but he had made the rules and they must be followed. He raised the leather crop and brought it down on Harry’s backside with a thwack. Harry hissed in pain "One." Draco said. He brought the crop down again with another thwack. "Two." Harry arse was turning red already and Draco's cock was throbbing. Another thwack rang out. "Three." Draco made the last smack a little harder and Harry gripped the bed sheets. "Four." Harry was silent and quivering on the bed. Draco then splayed his hand over Harry's sore bottom, making Harry moan, and leaned forward to whisper in his ear, "Are you okay to go on, Harry?"
They both slid into a booth and ordered their drinks. "So, Dray," Draco beamed at that nick name, he only liked hearing it from Harry, "What did you do after the trials? That was the last time we saw each other, right?"
"Since this is your first experience we'll start with a little game. I'll give you orders and every-time I feel satisfied with their completion I will take off an article of clothing and/or touch you."
"I just got tired, I guess. One can only take so much violence for one lifetime, and I really do love teaching." Harry replied shaking his head to sort out his mind. "Why did you decide to become a healer?'
"Well I was wondering if you'd go on a date with me?" Harry asked finally finding his Gryffindor courage.
"Yes master." Harry started slowly bouncing up and down. He moaned loudly and clawed at Draco's chest. Draco bent his knees placing his feet to the mattress and started thrusting upward into Harry.
He opened his front door and walked in with griffin still in his arms. He went to his bedroom and placed the chunky cat on his bed where griffin started kneeling his blanket.
My green eyes pierced into his Startling silver, and I frowned noticing they held just a tinge of sadness.
The door creaked open flooding the cell with light. "Grab him and bring him with us." He heard Miguel’s voice say.
"Okay love, but I have to be honest something might poke you." He laughed. Draco rolled his eyes but laughed as well.
Harry followed not long after that, filling Draco with his seed.  They both collapsed on to the bed, panting.
He was just getting ready to take a shower when his phone rang, but he didn't recognize this number.
"Still just as nosy as when we were in school? Huh, Potter?" Draco laughed. Harry took notice of how laid back and gentle he seemed now. His demeanor had changed so much since Hogwarts, five years ago.
Harry slid his tongue in and out of Draco's tight hole, gently lubing it up. He they slipped a finger in and curled it automatically hitting Draco's prostate.
"Baby, I'm already in pain. Why do you have to break my heart with your tears?" Harry smiles as he felt Draco's warm skin against his.
"No, you goof. You have no idea, do you?" He cupped my face staring into my eyes. I just shook my head hoping I hand forgot our anniversary.
"Y-you...I need you." Harry removed his fingers and Draco could now feel something bigger push against his hole. "H-Harry." He moaned as Harry pushed inside.
"Yes, I did! I think it'll help you to see me in a different light." Harry said getting up and sitting on the couch.  "Would you like me to hold you?"
Harry let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding and slammed the door. He put up new wards, the strongest he could think of, and went upstairs to comfort Draco and Scorpius.
"I want you too." Draco moaned throwing his head back so Harry could nibble at his throat. He slowly slid Harry's shirt off before slipping out of his own as well. They pushed they're naked torsos together and moaned.
Draco came up behind and put his hands in Harry’s back pockets while his kissed his neck and whispered in his ear, "If you wanted me too you just had to ask." Harry Moaned and pushed against him to feel as much as he could of Draco’s body.
They stayed up talking for a little while till Draco started to yawn, then Harry suggested they go to bed. Harry was nervous but he stripped down to his boxers, then he noticed Draco had done the same.
The all placed their order, Draco getting vanilla, Harry getting rocky road, and Scorpius getting bubblegum.
"Draco, go back upstairs with Scorp, and whatever you do don't leave your room. I'll take care of this." Draco turned and ran as fast as he could up the stairs. Harry had never seen him so scared in his life. not even when they faced the fire in the room of requirements, or when they were with Voldemort.
"I know Harry. I believe I love you too." Draco smiled as Harry kissed the tip of his nose, and they drifted off to sleep in each other's arms.
"Harry... I know you feel... responsible...for... Fred's..." He looked at his hands not able to finish his sentence, "But it wasn't your fault. He was fighting for a cause he believed in, a cause all of us believe in."
"Harry, please, relax. Breathe, please." He said stroking my back, "I'm not going to let them." My eyes grew wide. "I've managed to call in some favors and make it, so you can come stay with me, until I'm sure you're better." I blinked trying to take in the information. I had a horrible realization.
He watched as Draco bit his lip and his eyes seemed to be slightly sad. "Well After everything that happened, I started to hate myself, and I decided the only way to redeem myself was to heal people." He felt Harry Squeeze his hand, "It really has helped. I love my job. Getting to watch as I bring someone from the brink of death, it makes me feel... useful." He gave Harry a sad smile.
"I'm looking for someone." Before Miguel could speak or even move Harry pulled out his wand stupefied the two bounces in the room, apparated behind Miguel and held it to his throat.
They messed around at the arcade almost all day. Harry taught Draco how to play laser tag which he turned out to be excellent at, he also won Draco a green stuffed snake. Soon they had played every game and were ready for dinner.
"Oh yeah been stalking my posts?" Draco laughed and Harry couldn't tell if he meant that to sound so flirtatious.
He brought the paddle Down with a thwack. "One." Again, with another thwack, "two." Harry moaned again. Thwack! "Three!" Draco said. He sat the paddle down and stood Harry up by grabbing his throat and the back of his shirt.
"D-Draco..." I began to cry out, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I d-didn't mean to... I'm so sorry... I didn't know..." He pulled me close again and I tried to fight but his word lulled me to him.
Harry followed him in unable to take his eyes off Draco's naked torso. "I just got to say, I find you so attractive right now."
Harry was just as confused. He found himself strangely attracted to the tall blond. He had never been attracted to a man before, but Draco intrigued him more than anybody.
"I-I want to see you. All of you. I-I've waited so long..." I push my finger against his lips and gave him a sly smile as I stood from the bed. His eyes widened as I slowly, agonizingly slowly, pulled began to finish undressing. I let my boxes catch on the tip of my cock as I pulled them down and watched as Draco licked his lips.
"Hmm, actually there was this little dinner just down the street. Would you come with me?" Harry shakily lifted his head and looked into Draco's eyes.
He felt the warmth of Draco's tongue again, lapping at his hole. Then a finger being inserted inside him. He moaned and pushed against it.
"You may only speak when spoken to. If you have questions save them for when I ask for them, and I will ask for them." Draco took another sip of his whiskey.
I spent the next three hours playing with teddy while Draco and Andromeda caught up. I was happy to see he now had blood relatives he could trust, but that didn't make me near as happy as realizing just how much Teddy loved me. I never realized how much he looked up to me. I was his only father figure, and that awoke a sense of purpose in me.
After dinner Harry walked home. It wasn’t my too far between his place and Ron and Hermione's. Just a couple miles. When he got close to his house, he noticed something moving by his front door. As he got closer his eyes got wide. There was a giant orange cat curled up next to his door. It looked up at him and meowed with a meow that was so squeaky he was amazed it came out of this huge cat.
Harry left the ministry fuming. It had been the 6th court date he had had with Andromeda, and, again, her lawyer managed to push the date so he'd have to continue only seeing his godson, Teddy, every other weekend. He was tired of it. He would do anything to get custody over him, but ever since he came out as gay Andromeda was doing everything, she could to keep Teddy from him. She had even started spreading viscous rumors about him, making him look like a bad guy. luckily many of his friends and people that followed him during the war didn't believe them.
Draco couldn't hold out anymore. He waved his wand releasing the cock ring and both Harry and him road out their orgasms.
Harry smiled, "Gods, I hope so. I'd rather die than never see your perfect face ever again." with that he left leaving Draco smiling.
" That makes sense you're very straight forward." Draco Laughed. "I'm guessing you were a Gryffindor?"
"It's ok." He whispered. I closed my eyes and exhaled, my breath feathered against his skin cause tiny goose bumps to appear. I lean down and kissed his beautifully scared skin. I trailed kissed and licks all the way down it. His breath getting hard with each movement, until I reached them hymn of his pants. I looped my fingers inside and his hips bucked just slightly. I locked up waiting for approval.
Harry pulled his fingers out, popped Draco's member out of his mouth, pulled off his boxers and lubes up his cock as quickly as he could.
"H-Harry, I've never felt anything like this. In my life there's been nothing but heartache and pain, and I don't know if I can face it again. My life has been so lonely. I don't know what this feeling is, but I want to know. I want to know what love is, and I want you to show me." He finally let his eyes meet Harry's. They seemed sad but there was something more there. Something he hoped Harry would help him to understand.
"Yeah you've been my biggest crush since the day I laid eyes on you." Harry took another swig of his whiskey and refused to look up.
"So, do you." Draco moaned. He began to move in and out slowly picking up speed. Soon they were both shaking through they're orgasms and Harry woke up with a mess in his pants.
"With all my heart." I said pushing my forehead against his and meeting his gaze, so he could see I really did mean every word I said. He pulled me in for another kiss. This one slower and more loving.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he delicately slid his pants off allowing them to catch on the tip of his cock making it spring upward again. Draco lost control a little and licked his lips without realizing it. Harry fought a smile.
"I'm certain Ginny and I are done and I want you more than anything." Harry stroked Draco's cheek. Draco sat up slowly.
"Come in." Draco's voice made Harry's cock raise immediately. Harry opened the door and stepped inside, closing it behind him.
"Have a good night... Draco." Harry winked. Draco just shook his head again and left. Harry stared at his ass as he did. when he was far enough away that you couldn't tell who he was, Hermione and Ron showed up.
I'm so sorry you had to find me. I'm so sorry I couldn't do it. I've tried for 4 years now. I tried to be strong for you and Ron... and Teddy. It's just too heavy. Please make sure He's taken care of... since I couldn't. Hermione, I'm so sorry the guilt is eating me away. I don't want to see their faces every time I close my eyes. This is what I deserve.
He pushed his hips flush against Draco's letting their erection slide together. Draco tilted his head back in pleasure and Harry started kissing his neck, giving the skin a little nip every now and then.
"Demoted?" Harry's stomach dropped. He didn't understand what that meant but the way Miguel said it worried him.
"Yep, it's probably the only rumor she's spread that's actually true." harry shrugged his shoulders.
"I think you can help more than any of his psychologists and mind healers combined." Hermione finely said.
"What!? Why!? You've been after him since we were kids! Why the hell would you say no!?" Pansy screeched.
"I wish I could do this every night." He whispered as he tucked Draco into bed and kissed his forehead again. He then flooed home.
"It's Okay, Harry. I didn't think he would ever track me down at work, and neither did you." Draco started to calm down.
The next morning Draco awoke alone in his bed. He sat up wondering if it all had been a dream, but then he saw the note on the dresser. He picked it up and read it;
"I would love to." I said as I held teddys sleepy body. I went to hand him to her, but he gripped my neck.
"That sounds lovely." Draco said as he yawned and fell asleep in Harry's arms. Harry kissed his forehead then picked him up and carried him to his room.
Harry sat next to Draco's bed holding his hand while he slept. They had been there for a couple hours and were now waiting for the healer.
After about thirty minutes of cuddles the two finally stood and started getting dressed. Draco had to help Harry stand on his shaking legs to get his trousers and pants on.
Harry carried him into his bedroom and fell to the bed, Draco's legs still wrapped around him. He kissed his way down letting his tongue tease Draco's nipple as he passed, till his lips were pressed against the waist band of Draco's lounge pants. He slowly slid them off and watch as the man beneath him turned as red as a cherry.
"There’s nothing to forgive you for, you’ve done nothing wrong. I'm sorry I couldn't get to you faster." A tear slipped down Harry's cheek as he kissed Draco’s forehead. He wrapped Draco in his trench coat and picked him up bridal style. As he walked out the door, he kicked Miguel hard in the head, breaking his nose. He wished he could do more.
They arrived from the hospital a few hours after Draco awoke, and now harry was hard at work getting the guest room, that he had used as a storage, ready. He had forced Draco to relax on the couch.
A couple big guys picked Draco up and began staging I'm down the hall. They climbed a couple flights of stairs and soon they were in another much nicer hall. They soon stopped at a door which Miguel opened with a key and signaled the men to throw Draco in. The room was very nice there was a four-poster bed and a bathroom to the left of where Draco was laying on the floor. The decor was done in deep reds and burgundies with dark wood floors and furniture.
Harry was shocked but nodded his head. Draco generally wrapped his fingers in Harry unruly hair and moved in slowly, placing his lips against Harry and kissing him slowly. Harry melted into the kiss. They're lips fit together magically, and Draco tasted like vanilla coffee. He felt Draco's tongue swipe against his bottom lip so he ever so slightly opened his mouth. Allowing Draco to enter and explore every inch of him. He let out and quiet moan and Draco gripped his hair a little tighter. A few minutes later they pulled away, lip swollen and out of breath.
By the time Saturday came Harry was nearly pulling his hair out in anticipation. He was so excited to find out what was to come tonight. He had fantasized about it every night that week.
"Well we tracked down a couple of death eater that are still very loyal to you know who. They’re not going to come easy, and they're known for being dangerous. You'll be risking your life on this one." His boss said.
"Yes." Harry could sense a bit of fear in Draco's voice and he noticed how tense he had become. He got down on his knees in front of the man and looked into his eye, "Are you afraid that I'm going to hurt you over this?" He took Draco's hands in his.
Harry started to slowly go deeper and deeper till Draco's cock hit the back of his throat. He quickly took It out of his mouth and coughed.
That smile killed harry inside. Knowing how bad this poor man in front of him must have felt after everything, made his heart break. He never deserved that. He couldn't choose his family. He hadn't realized his hand had moved from its position, and was now stroking Draco's cheek, till he felt Draco melt into his touch.
Draco fell to his knees and cried. He didn't understand why Harry had to be taken away from him just when they'd connected. He cried for about 10 minutes then he pulled himself together, got dressed, and headed to St. Mungo's.
"Is this death?" I asked myself. It's nothing like last time. It’s just darkness. I couldn't feel my body and I kind of like that. There was no pain just complete darkness. Suddenly there as a small pin prick of light, and I found myself afraid of it. I reached out anyways and touched it. It started to grow, and I could feel tingles and warmth cover me. I was now trying to run from it. I knew what it was. It was life.
After he closed the door behind him, I walked up behind Draco and wrapped my arms around him and watch as he plated dinner.
Draco got even closer pulled Harry in close and whispered in his ear sexually, "Harry, you're probably the best I've ever had, and I'm just getting started with you." He lightly bit Harry's earlobe making Harry moan ever so quietly.
"No, Beautiful, they would never leave you. Hermione just believes I can help you more than they can." Everything about that sentence confused the hell out of me. I just sat there, blinking, again, trying to figure out if this was reality. I don't even think Draco realized everything he had just said in that one statement. Did Draco Malfoy just call me beautiful AND refer to Hermione by her first name!? Not only that there was care in his eyes!
"H-harry...I... I... think I need a little time to think things over." He gave harry one last sad look and disappeared into the castle.
"Yes, really. But be quiet. Scorpius is sleeping. Harry walked through the fireplace as Draco stood up.
"No! If I would have known I would have never asked you to sit!" Draco tried to spit but there was hardly any malice.
"I think you've earned a reward." Draco smiled and stood from the bed. He slowly and smoothly slipped out of his clothes. Harry licked his lips as Draco removed his boxers revealing his cock. Harry was fully hard again.
"Yes Dra..." Harry barley finished his sentence as Draco pulled him in for a deep passionate kiss. Harry had never been kissed like that and it made his heart pound out of his chest. Draco didn't want to say anything but he was in love and this kiss proved it.
"Yep," Harry nodded, "Well he made it so me and Ron couldn't get onto the platform, so we stole Ron's dad's enchanted car! At one point we almost got hit by the Hogwarts express. When we made it to Hogwarts, we crashed into the Whomping willow. Ron was so scared he broke his wand! So, there we are sitting on top the Whomping willow, without a clue as the what tree we just landed in, and it starts pounding on us from every angle!" Harry was getting animated now. Draco loved seeing this side of Harry and couldn't stop himself from smiling and watching his every move.
"I'm going to cum!" Draco shouted. Harry stopped him and pulled him out of his mouth but didn't stop working him hard with his hands. "Oh, my fuck! Harry if you don't stop, I'm going to cum all over your face!" Draco gripped the sheets tight. He found the thought of covering Harry's face sexy but wasn't sure if that's what Harry wanted so he tried to stop himself.
"I have another assignment in a few hours." Draco replied with a sad smile. Harry stood from the bed and wrapped Draco in his arms.
"Well I had tickets to an opera, but I would much rather stay here and talk to you?" Harry replied as he scooted just a hair closer.
God there was something about his laugh that made my heart pound in my chest. I picked my head up and stared at his face still chuckling with a big, amazing, toothy grin. I couldn't control my actions anymore and brought my hand up to stroke his cheek. I watched as his smile faded, a very brief look of surprise washed over him before he let out a loud exhale, which I could have sworn I head a faint moan, as he melted into my hand.
"Y-your right. All this time, I'd been thinking about myself. I never stopped to realize how much that little boy needs me." I wrapped him in my arms and wiped away his tears.
"D-Draco, what are you doing?" Harry moaned. Draco was expecting a fight, but this turned him on even more.
After Harry left Draco decided he wanted a bath, so he went upstairs and magically filled the tub. Complete with color changing bubbles. Then he poured himself a glass of wine and got in.
Harry adjusted his suit as he got ready for the Halloween masquerade ball. Ron and Hermione would be there any minute to pick him up. He was just trying on his red and black devils mask when there was a knock on the door. He took it off and hurried to answer it.
Harry put the food under a preservation charm and went upstairs with a wine glass. he entered the bathroom and had to stop for a moment. Draco look so sexy sitting naked in a claw-foot tub full of bubbles with his hair disheveled, his legs thrown over the side, and a glass of wine in his hand.
"Fuck." Harry said again as he grabbed Draco's hips and pulled him closer. They danced like this for a few songs. The light touch driving Harry crazy. He finally couldn't take anymore so he wrapped his arm around Draco and place a hand on his cheek to turn his face towards him a little bit. "Malfoy, come home with me."
"They locked you in a cupboard and beat you?!" Draco exclaimed, "I thought you were living the good life. I'm so sorry Harry."
Harry followed the guy and watched as he got a drink then went to the other side of the room where all the couches were and the music was charmed to be quieter.
"Damn that's an amazing ass." He thought to himself. "Excuse me, can I get some whiskey?" He asked politely. He was shocked when the bar tender dropped the glass he was holding and froze for a minute. Harry's eyes went wide as the bar tender turned around and he was met with the piercing grey eyes he'd dreamt about for years.
"Fuck yeah, Harry! Take it!" Draco yelled as he pushed his dick in as far as he could and held it there till Harry started grabbing at his thigh. He thrusted out and continued his pace, "good boy! Oh, you feel so good! I'm going to fuck you so hard!" Harry was throbbing with each word Draco said.
" I love you too." Harry smiled. Then he felt Draco's cock push against his hole and moaned. Soon Draco was all the way inside of him and he felt full and right.  "Fuck, Draco you feel so good."
"I love your cock so much, master. You feel so good!" Harry yelled. Draco grabbed him tightly and threw him to the mattress, fucking him hard.
"Y-yes." He moaned once he felt me against him. I began to push inside him, and he screwed his eyes shut and bit his lips.
Then there was Teddy. He held all my biggest regrets. One look from his beautifully innocent face and every memory of the war flooded back into my brain like  tidal wave. Seeing the faces of Remus and Tonks in his, set my every being ablaze. He would still have parents if it wasn't for me.
Harry pushed Draco onto the bed and climbed on top of him. He leaned close to Draco's ear and whispered, "I'm going to savor this." Draco moaned as Harry started moving his hips rubbing their cocks together through their trousers. Draco threw his head back and bit his lip.
"Oh." Harry said and they sat in silence for a few moments. "I should get going. I have an early morning tomorrow." Harry got up and started to leave.
Draco blushes but was soon moaning and writhing as Harry lower his head and took all of him in his mouth. He conjured some lube wandlessly and pressed his finger to Draco's hole, gently inserting it.
Harry pulled him in close and whispered into his ear "Dray, I'd love to show you." Draco let out a shaky breath as Harry's lips ghosted over his ear and down his jaw before they were pressed passionately to his. Harry pushed him against the wall off the entry way and slid his hand down Draco's sides, making him moan against his lips. He took the opportunity to slip his tongue inside and explore his mouth. Draco's long slender fingers began to twirl in Harry's hair driving him crazy.
He was aching for more and couldn't stand it anymore, so he took Harry's hands and pinned them to the bed. Then he let his tentacles pulsate around Harry's cock. Harry looked surprised and tried to protest but Draco made one tentacle grow and inserted it into Harry's open mouth, soon he let pleasure take over and began pushing into Draco begging for more. Draco realize moisture was building on the larger tentacle and decided to let it move a little lower to Harry's hole and tease him.
"I don't want you to stop yourself." Draco replied as he kissed and bit Harry's ear. That pushed Harry over the edge, so he picked Draco up and carried him into the bedroom. He laid Draco on the bed and crawled on top of him after kicking off his shoes.
"Fuck, Harry! That was amazing! If I didn't have to pay bills, I wouldn't make you pay." Draco said nuzzling Harry's hair.
"Harry...please..." I begged trying to thrust against me, but I held his hip down with my free hand.
Harry also wasn't sleeping. He couldn't, Draco was running through his head, leaving him worried and scared. What if Draco didn't feel the same thing he felt? A knock on his door shook him from his thoughts. He got up and put on some sweatpants. He looked through the little window on his front door and was shocked at what he saw, a shirtless Draco shivering in the corridor. He threw the door open, "Draco what are you doing?" He said letting his eyes wonder over Draco's bare chest. He could feel himself stir in his boxers.
I felt hands on my shoulders and opened my eyes one last time. I could see a blurry vision of Hermione's face. She was yelling something, but I couldn't hear a thing. I could feel a blissful smile on my face as I whispered, "You're early." And finally slipped into a beautiful unconsciousness.
Murmurs and claps filled the hall as Harry pulled out his seat and sat down, lightly brushing Draco's Arm as he did so, sending tingles through Draco's body. He was staring at Harry with big eyes and as much as he tried, he couldn't pull away.
"Well after he awakes from his coma, they plan on emitting him into the hospital for a while, probably a long while. We think it would be better if he was with you though." I gave her a puzzled look, "We know you can pull a few strings and get him sent to stay with you. I mean you are one of their top healers."
After about 20 minutes Draco finally calmed down, did his paperwork, and went home. He then called his mother and asked her if Scorpius could spend the night. He needed some alone time with Harry.  She agreed of course.
"You shouldn't say that." I heard Hermione's voice say in my head. If she were here right now she'd tell me I have her and Ron, the Weasleys, and little Teddy. I didn't deserve them though. I could barely look at the Weasleys anymore, especially George. I took so much from them. As for Ron and Hermione It was my fault they had to grow up so fast. They never had a childhood because of me. I forced them to risk their lives every time they came back to Hogwarts, all because they were my closest friends.
"Let's go grab a drink!" Harry yelled over the music. They walked over to the bar and ordered their drinks. "You'll never guess who I saw before you showed up."
"Would you keep it down potter? Do you want someone to hear us?" Draco whispered as Harry and him made their way through the abandoned mansion.
"Draco, we need to talk." Her voice was hoarse and squeaked a little bit, and I was shocked at the use of my first name.
Harry chases him and got a stall door slammed in his face. He made sure no one was in the bathroom then locked the door. "Draco come out."
Harry turned and stared at the tall thin man standing beside him. He had changed so much. Not just his body, which had filled out but was still lean and slender, but even his demeaner. He didn't give of that same harsh offensiveness he did when they were in school together. Now he seemed more relaxed and calmer, almost nice. Harry couldn't help but notice his face. What once had always held a sneer or a smirk no revealed, what he would explain as, a sad smile. It intrigued him greatly.
Draco's tongue lapped in and out of Harry's tight whole making him squirm and moan. Then as soon as it started it stopped. He gripped the sheets as he felt Draco sink his teeth into His ass cheek.
"Oh, that's great!" Narcissa exclaimed. Harry was surprised. "You two would be so good for each other! He needs someone like you in his life. He's had such a bad experience with love."
"Oh sorry, I was just thinking about how nice it was for you to cook for me and how I could return the favor." Draco replied as he hopped off the counter and got some plates down from the cupboard.
"Oh, don't be embarrassed honey. He's really good at what he does. You just go through that curtain and up the stairs it's the third door to the right."
Draco sat in his high back chair wearing black slacks and a white button up with the top bottoms undone.
"Dad told me one where there were rumors of you coming to school in a flying car!" Scorpius got comfy while Draco tucked him in and sat on the side of the bed.
"What. The. Fuck. Harry! I'm going to the fucking burrow. Fuck you Harry!" She grabbed her bag and slammed the doors behind her.
"I'm going to. I promise." Harry replied. He kissed Draco passionately, but Draco disappeared and darkness took over again. Hello led around him and could see a white light in the distance. When he listened closely, he could hear Draco's voice coming from it. He thought that couldn't be death, so he followed it.
"No, no I like when you call me Harry. does that mean I can call you Draco?" Harry asked as they both sat down in the booth Scorpius had picked.
Draco sat down on the couch, Harry handed him his glass of wine and sat down next to him. Draco took a big gulp then curled up under Harry's arm.
After a little bit of a longer break the tingling started again and Draco was now using his tongue and fondling his balls.
Harry turned around and wrapped his arms around Draco, "Oh, I'm sexy now, am I? Since when." Harry laughed.
"It's ok. I can talk about it. I'm over it now. I dated Blaise Zambini for a while. A long while actually. Then I found out he had been cheating on me throughout our whole relationship."
Draco stepped out of the shower, dried off, and put on the spandex shorts. He couldn't stop shaking as he sat on the bed. He had heard rumors of other men that tried to quit and ended up disappearing. He was scared but most of all he was worried he'd never see Harry again.
"I see you need to think. I'm assuming you don't have flew so here's my number. Please get back to me soon. Like I said, I'm leaving in two days." Harry said sadly handing Draco a piece of paper then turning and leaving.
Harry chuckled, "Mmhmm, my friend Ron and I couldn’t get onto platform 9 3/4 because your grandfather's house elf at the time, Dobby..."
"I-I was just doing what was right. You didn't have to save me. I didn't deserve it." Tears were pouring down his face and soaking Harry's robe now.
Harry got down on one knee so he could be eye level with the small child, "Yes I did, with a great big sword."
"Now, Draco, you have a choice, continue doing as you told and I'll keep doing what I do, or quit and I'll force you to do whatever I want. "
"Well he has multiple lacerations in his rectal cavity, one big enough we'll have to do surgery to repair. We'll also need to test him for HIV in a few months. Other than that, he'll be fine with no permanent damage. I'm worried about his mind though. I'm going to recommend a few mind healers for him to see. He'll also need the support of all his friends and loved ones." She replied.
"Hey all I said is I liked his ass. don't take it that far, but get this! He tells his son stories about me and he called me by my first name. Not just that I made him blush! Maybe he's gay for me." Harry laughed.
He just watched with sad eyes as I waved my wand and repaired the mirror then set to work fixing his hand. After I was finished, and he was all patched up and blood free he final said something.
"Please, Harry!" I hadn't even realized I had begun to sob. "Please." I whispered again. This somehow shook him, and the shard shattered on the floor. He began to sob with me and fell into my embrace.
Harry felt tingles in his fingertips. "The hospital, you’re alright, but you're going to come stay with me for a little while." Draco released Harry's hand without realizing he was holding it and jolted up.
"Whatever I'm going to bed!" Ginny shouted as she stormed to the room and slammed the door. Harry laid on the couch and grabbed the throw blanket. He didn't feel like dealing with Ginny. He was too tired and sore. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.
"So?" He flipped us over, so he was on top of me, and I stifled a moan as he bushed his lips against my ear.
After he had changed into Harry's clothes, he walked back into the living room to find harry had already changed as well and sitting on of the couches.
Draco hadn't noticed but he had slowly gravitated into Harry's arm," the little boy was you?" Draco asked.
Draco started to panic but sobered up when he heard a small voice say, "Ommin's free?" He looked up to see Scorpius, fear stricken and in tears at the top of the stairs. He opened his arms and Scorpius ran into them. "Daddy, no! You said he couldn't get us again!" Cried the five-year-old.
"Uh hi Harry." Harry had never seen Draco look so disheveled and unlike Draco. His hair was a mess he was wear muggle jeans and a t-shirt and he spoke so quiet.
"I'd like that very much, and I just so happen to have the next two days off. I can spend the whole time with you if you'd like." Draco said.
He sighed and took his clothes off so he could step into the shower. The warm water felt good on his sore body. He really liked that he could still feel Draco on him though. He started to get hard thinking about it again. He felt young again with all these feelings and lust swarming inside of him. He grabbed his cock and started reimagining the night before again. It didn't take him long to cum again.
"The tree hit us hard enough that the car fell out of the tree, and Ron punched the accelerator, just before the tree wound up and tried to smash us with all its force! The car must have been angry with us because it ejected us and all our luggage out onto the grass then sped off into the forest." Harry laughed.
After putting the toys away, Harry and Draco went upstairs to tuck Teddy in. "What story do you want to hear?" Harry asked.
"Well, if you must know," Draco looked down at his feet, "I came out as gay, and Father is against that so I was kicked out onto the streets, and I couldn't get work in the wizarding world thanks to the... you know. So, I got this job. Could be worse, I guess. at least it pays the bills." Draco laughed again when he looked up and saw Harry’s shocked face. "What? don't tell me you hate gays too?" He rolled his eyes.
"Also, mum said you and Draco must come over Sunday night for dinner, and we both know she blow her top if you two don't show." They laughed again.
"That little bit or the old Malfoy always manages to find a way to slip out." Hermione said jokingly. I chuckled.
"Now I want you to pick up your clothes, fold them, and place them on the dresser." Draco liked keeping his room tidy but he also hoped this would give him a moment to compose himself. He was wrong.
Harry had had enough. Everything was crushing him; His work load for the Aurors, His friends, and especially Andromeda not letting him see his godson because he came out as gay. He walked down the muggle city streets looking for the nearest pub. he finally found one called The Witches Brew. He thought that was amusing. The pub was pretty empty, so he walked in and sat down at the bar. He noticed the bartender with long platinum blond hair, turned away from him placing some glasses on the shelves.
"Well his father was very tough on us when he was young, so he never got the love he deserved growing up. It's my biggest regret. Then there was his late wife, that was an arranged marriage, so I don’t think they ever truly loved each other. And, of course, there was his ex-husband. He...well Draco should tell you about that when he's ready." Her face went from smiling to sad quickly. Harry was curious but he decided it was something he should bring up when Draco seemed comfortable with it. "Anyways his address is 454 Hillshire Ave. Good luck! I hope he agrees." She said perking up a bit.
Draco awoke with harry curled up in asleep in his arms. He was so happy in that moment, but then he remembered the tentacles. He looked under the covers and they were completely gone. Nothing there but his plain old cock. He gave a sigh of relief and a little bit of sadness. they felt great but he'd rather have his own dick.
"I'll have fire whiskey on the rocks." Draco ordered, "Harry?" As Harry went to speak Draco reached into his pocket and pushed a button.
That night they hadn't done anything more than snog, but it had definitely been the best Draco had ever had. It had been a week since that night and they had called each other whenever they had the chance.
After he got both Draco and Scorpius to calm down, He made them pancakes and spent the day trying to make them forget, even if it was just for a few seconds, the whole ordeal. They went and got Ice cream, played in the park, and when they got home Harry told Scorpius as many stories as the little boy could handle. He fell asleep in the living room with his head on Harry's lap and Draco, wrapped in Harry's other arm, stroking his hair.
"Guess you really can't die." There was no malice in his voice, but his word cut into me, as I remembered how badly I didn't want to wake up. My chest tightened, and I fell back onto my bed and curled into the fetal position. Tears were pouring from my face again and I couldn't breathe, but then I felt warmth surround me. Strong arms were pulling me tight against a firm chest, close enough I could feel his heart beat, and for the first time in months I felt comfortable. I was still suffocating but I could feel air being pull into my lungs one tiny breath at a time.
The next morning Harry awoke to the smell of bacon and coffee. He got out of bed and looked down the hall to the kitchen to see Draco with his back turned, wearing nothing but lounge pants, and cooking at the stove. Harry sneaked into the kitchen and wrapped his arms around him laying his head on Draco's back. He felt Draco's breath hitch at the skin on skin contact.
"Yes, master." Harry said as his eyes met Draco's. He finally reached the last button on his shirt and slowly slid it off.
"Please come home with me? The lack of you not being naked is driving me fucking crazy!" Harry begged.
A large man walked into the room and began to undress. He wasn't very built but not fat either. His body was covered in scars and Draco could smell the booze on him from across the room.
"Please, Harry, I'm ready." Draco captured Harry's lips again in a searing kiss. Harry grabbed Draco's arse and pulled him closer so he could feel Draco's cock against his own.  Draco threw his head back and moaned. Harry took the opportunity to attack Draco's throat and chest, leaving hickeys as he went. Draco moved his hands from the tub and drug his nails across Harry's shoulders. "I need to feel you inside of me."
And other week went by and Harry was over at Ron and Hermione's for dinner. He was sitting on the sofa mindlessly scrolling again while Ron was in the bathroom and Hermione was cooking dinner. He noticed Draco posted something and went to read it. When he did, his heart sank.
"I guess it's because you're so sexy." Draco joked even though there was quite a bit of truth in that statement.
Harry almost dropped the table he was levitating. "I'm not going to listen to you complain tomorrow about how bad the couch felt." Harry chuckled and continued his work. Draco swung around on the couch and leaned on the back so he could watch. Something felt strange though. He started staring at Harry's incredibly sexy figure and he'd be lying if he said he'd never done that before, but this time felt different. He almost felt more desire, like a strange primal urge. He'd never wanted someone so bad. he watched as little beads of sweat dripped down Harry's forehead and neck then he noticed he was starting to sweat too.
"Please Draco, let me explain myself. I'm a different man now. I need you." Ommin begged, but Draco could see he wasn't being sincere.
"I was just dreaming about you." He said. He almost laughed when Draco jumped but it hurt too much to move. His heart broke when he saw tears well up in Draco's eyes.
"Oh my god!" Harry yelled. Draco's balls slapped against his ass as he rode Draco's every thrust. "Oh master!"
For my big boy. I'll always miss you griffin. You meant the world to me. I love you so much and I always will. RIP my big boy.
When he read that post he wondered if this meant Draco was gay. He was embarrassed to say he got a little excited. Harry had fallen in love with Griffin and Draco. He loved how handsome and stoic griffin looked and he adored how much Draco loved him. He hadn't noticed but he had been reading through Draco's posts for an hour.
Harry smiled and started undressing. He looked up after undoing his belt and noticed Draco was covering his eye. "What are you doing?"
"Can I ask you something odd?" Harry asked as he stroked Draco's legs that were thrown over his lap.
"No, I do like you. I've liked you since I first saw you. It's just..."tears began to well up in Draco's eyes. "I'm scared."
Draco turned around and laid his head on Harry's chest. He thought for a moment about how safe he felt. He had never felt this way before. "It’s okay. I'll tell you." Draco whispered.
"I can't wait till I can ride a broom! Daddy are we going to go to the park next like we always do?"  Scorpius had finished his ice cream getting most of it on his face.
"S-stop." Draco choked. The man moaned and plowed him harder squeezing Draco’s neck more and more to the point that Draco couldn't breathe at all. He started clawing at the man’s hands, but the man just laughed and strengthened his grip.
"I thought no one would believe me, and the people I did tell couldn't do anything for me." Harry wrapped his arm around Draco.
"Harry! Wake up! I'm here!" I yelled as I shook him. He awoke startled and I was flung hard against the wall by his magic. I shook my head trying to shake away my dizziness and focus on harry. I refused to black out even though I could feel a small trickle of blood down the back of my neck.
Draco le out a sharp cry as I finally found his sensitive spot and I began to repeatedly pound into it. I felt heat pooling in my stomach as my orgasm began to pool.
"Suck." I whispered as I presented my fingers. He greedily took them into his mouth coating them with saliva. I followed my trail back down to his leaking cock and gently like the tip, savoring his pre-come and enjoying the magnificent squeal he expelled from his lips. I circled his entrance with my slicked fingers as my tongue continues to swirl around his tip, leaving him a writhing mess on the sheets.
"Harry Potter?" Narcissa said before Lucius had the chance to speak. Her voice was soft but surprised.
"Not yet! Take it Harry! Take it like the little slut you are! My little slut!" Draco shouted as he pounded Harry as hard as he could. Hitting his prostate with ever thrust.
"You're so tight." Draco said as he began moving in and out. He curled his finger and found Harry's prostate. Harry pulled on his restraints and moaned loudly as he pushed against Draco's finger. "Mm yes you’re such a horny little slut. Do you want more potter?"
"Professor." His voice of all things surprised Harry the most. It was smooth and deep, and held none of the malice it used to.
"Draco, I love you, with all my heart. You and Scorpius and Teddy, you're my family, and I’m going to protect each one of you." Harry said as he wiped Draco's tears away.
Draco went pale and his eyes got wide as he realized he wasn’t the only one with a crush, "R-really?" He stuttered.
"This is my treat." Harry said as he took out his bank card, and Scorpius went and sat down with his ice cream.
Soon he was in a bright white room. There was no furniture, it was just a white cube. He felt a tap on his shoulder, so he turned around. There was Draco smiling back at him. He quickly took Draco into his arms and held him tightly
Harry, who heard this from the hall way, smiled, and Draco’s heart fluttered, as he closed the door. He looked at Harry who still had a huge grin on his face.
"Well I got so many people killed and I've ruined so many lives. I guess I believe I shouldn't have complete happiness." Harry let out a breath, but his eye got wide when he saw a little bit of anger grow in Draco's eyes.
they began to throb and pulsate, so he touched them again. It felt so good to touch them, but it wasn't enough. he needed more. He started thinking of harry again. How good his new tentacles would feel against his skin, in his mouth, or in that tight little ass. He couldn't take it anymore, so he quickly got undressed and snuck into Harry's room
"I-I promise, D-Draco, I will try." He whispered. We stayed wrapped in each other's arms on the floor of the bathroom for what felt like hours, but it was only mere minutes, before I finally picked him up, Gods he was so light, and sat him on the counter.
Dinner went really well they both talked about work, what happened after school, and made amends for what they did to each other during school. They made joke and laughed and there was definitely a surplus of flirting. Soon they had finished, put cleaned up the kitchen and were sitting in the living room.
Ginny still wasn't back by the time Saturday came around. Harry didn't mind though. It made it easier to talk to Draco and to go see him when his appointed time came.
Harry laid in bed next to Ginny staring at the back of her head. They had just had sex, but this was the 5th time he had to fake an orgasm by doing quick cleaning spell so she wouldn't be able to tell. He just wasn't into it anymore. He was even finding it difficult to get hard anymore. They had been married for 2 years and were talking about having their first child, but how could he do that without ejaculating?
Draco glared at him as he reached back into his pocket and held down the button. The vibration intensified and didn't stop. Harry leaned forward and gripped the counter trying to suppress a moan.
"Well my sexual desire for her went away in the first 6 months of us dating, and now I can't even get off with her. She's really sweet but I'm just not attracted to her. And now she's talking about having kids, but I don't think I want that. I've thought about leaving but, I don't know, I guess I'm afraid of something."  Harry gave a half smile.
The waitress sat the water and coffee on the table. "Oh yeah how so?" Harry smile grew but he hid it as he took a long drink of water.
"What do you mean?" Draco said as he took Harry's hand. He could feel himself start to shake at the contact of Harry's skin.
"Wow! That's amazing!" Scorpius was jumping up and down now. "Do you want to go play a game with me?!"
"I'm s-sorry m..." Before harry could say another word his bindings were loosened and he was being flipped onto his stomach. a velvet cushion was placed under his stomach and then the bindings were tightened again. He felt leather straps tighten around his knees and connect to his elbows keeping him in position.
Harry smiled and grabbed his candy bowl. "Well aren't you super..." Harry looked up and saw the little boy's father "Cute."
"Same for me." Draco smiled as he plated the bacon and eggs. He sat the plates down on the table and they began to eat.
The next morning Harry awoke to Draco stirring. "Good morning, sweetheart." He said as he wiped dried tears from Draco's cheek. Scorpius was still fast asleep between them.
Before he could say another word, I flipped us over again and discarded my shirt. His eyes were watching my every move hungrily. He ran his hand up my torso "merlin, You're so beautiful." His fingers wrapped in my hair and he pulled me down to his lips again as I undid the buttons on his silk shirt. Once I had slipped it off, I let my lips draw a line down his jaw and neck till I reached his chest. My eyes finally caught a glimpse of the scars I had caused, and I looked up at him in silent apology. He gently raked a hand through my hair.
"Uh yeah. Look we don't have to do this. I know you probably don't want to." Harry said as he turned to leave. Draco grabbed his arm and swung him around. With one hand lightly on Harry's throat and the other wrapped around his wrist Draco pinned him to the wall.
"Mm good boy. I want you to ride me." Draco whispered. He added another finger and fucked Harry till he was satisfied.
He chuckled again. "I wasn't saying it was a bad thing. In all honestly I'd be perfectly happy waking up with pins and needles shooting through my hand as long as your perfect head it the cause."
"Well, it has been awhile." Draco half smiled, "If you saw who I was under this mask you wouldn't find me so sexy. Not many do."
"P-please harry." He begged. I continued and let my erection spring up out of my now discarded boxers. Draco stood from the bed and in a swift motion pulled me against him capturing my lip.
"harry who is he? Is he an angel?" Teddy whispered in my ear. I watched a Draco choked back his laughter which Andromeda couldn't do.
Draco and Harry dated for 2 years before Draco had Griffin give him a ring asking to marry him. The married a year later and moved into a big house. A year after that Teddy moved in and they adopted Scorpius.
My eyes wanted to tear up as I felt my mind breaking for the hundredth time. Maybe I should just give into it. I gripped my hair tightly in my hands and stared at the bottle, my only salvation, sitting on the table. I deserved a muggle way out, then again maybe I'm just afraid I'll survive an unforgivable again.
Harry quickly scooted closer to Draco and took him in his arms, "Draco don't you ever think you're not good enough for me. You're everything I've ever dreamed of, and you make me feel like the luckiest man alive. As for Blaise he was just an asshole that didn't deserve you." Draco laid his head on Harry shoulder, and squeezed him tightly not wanting to let go. "I got you baby, and from now on I always will. I know that's a lot to say on a first date, but I've cared about you for so long it feels like we've been together forever."
"And what did you call me?" Harry could hear Draco rummaging through a drawer as he spoke but no matter how he turned his head he couldn't see him.
"You're right, thank you Pansy. I guess I should call him." Draco said taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out. "I shouldn't let him go again."
"Well I was thinking I'd introduce you to a friend of mine, who's actually your cousin!" Harry handed Teddy his bag, "But first you need to put your stuff away."
Harry was really netbooks now. "Well... I kind of wanted to see if he'd go on a date with me." He said rubbing the back of his neck and looking away.
"Well that’s one way to get you to touch my butt." Harry laughed as he stirred the pots on the stove.
"D-dray?" He said as he wiped the tears away with his thumbs. "What's wrong? What did you mean back there?"
"Thank you, Draco." I whispered into his shoulder. He wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me in closer.
Then his eyes fluttered open and there was Draco. He had made it. He had survived death again. This time with help from the man he loved. He watched Draco read to him for a few minutes. Admiring the glow to his skin and hair.
Draco lay in bed trying to sort out his thoughts and emotions. Did he love Harry? Had he ever felt love before? His parents never showed him love. It was weak. His wife never loved him. They were force to be together. But this kiss he shared with Harry wasn’t like anything he had ever felt before. It was pure, and he could feel all the emotion Harry had put into it.
He grabbed a hand full of floo powder, stuck his head in the fireplace and yelled Malfoy Manor. Soon he was seeing a living room with Narcissa And Lucius Malfoy sitting on two chair both looking up from their books.
He gazed at Harry's sleeping form in the moonlight. He was so beautiful, Draco Had to have him. He slowly and carefully slipping into bed behind him trying hard not to touch him fully just yet. He started kissing and sucking Harry's neck.
"So, next weekend I’ll have Teddy, and I was wondering if I could bring him over to meet the two of you. He's not too much older than Teddy, so they should get along. I'm not too worried about it, Teddy gets along with everybody." Harry laughed, "What do you think love?"
"Thank you, Griffin. You were the best cat anyone could ever wish for."  Harry gave him a few more pets as the doctor administered the drug and griffin crossed the rainbow bridge.
"Are you sure you're ready to walk you look pretty worn out and you might be sore?" Draco was concerned.
Harry rushed to his side and when Draco finally realized who was there, he began to cry harder. Harry untied him and removed the ball gag. Once freed, Draco shied away from harry and sobbed ever more.
"What was that last night?" came a groggy voice. "They felt like tentacles. I thought I was dreaming but here you are so..."
"I can't, I won’t survive." Draco said refusing to look Harry in the eye. Harry lifted his chin so he was looking him in the eye.
"Harry, once you feel up to it would you like to start taking him on the weekend maybe even for the summers?" Andromeda asked me.
"Oh fuck! Harry!" Draco moaned as Harry squeezed lightly. Harry removed his hand and Draco looked disappointed in the loss of contact. Harry gripped Draco's pants and slid them down sliding down Draco's body as he did. Once Draco's trousers were off, Harry cupped Draco through his boxers.
All while Draco was screaming on the inside, "IS HARRY POTTER ASKING ME ON A DATE?!?!" He shook his head and calmed down. "This couldn't be a date after all. Harry's not even gay. I don't even know if I am."
"Yes?" Harry said as he looked deep into Draco's eye. He could see tears starting to form in the corners and he was shocked.
"Hey they said everyone who's anyone will be here! I'll know. I've been staring at that ass for years!" Hermione just shook her head, "It'll be like Cinder-fucking-Ella, but with an ass." Ron and Hermione broke out in a laughing fit.
without saying a word Draco intertwined his fingers in Harry's hair, leaned up, and kissed him slowly so he could savor every second of it. Harry kissed back just as slowly and pulled Draco as close as he could get. Draco became impatient of the space and crawled into Harry's lap. Harry fought a moan but it managed to escape. This cause a chain reaction. Draco moaned at Harry's moan which turned Harry on immensely, so harry pulled Draco closer to him making them both moan again.
Harry lifted Draco’s face so he could look I'm in the eye. "Everything's going to be alright, my love. We'll get through this."
"As long as I can remember I guess." Draco said. Harry noticed a slight blush on his cheeks. "Is the feeling mutual?" He looked and Harry with hope in his eyes.
Draco pushed Harry to the bed and climbed on top of him, never breaking the kiss. Harry gripped Draco's hair and wrapped his legs around his waist. Draco easily slipped his now hardened cock back inside Harry. Moving very slowly, they moved as one, worshipping each other's bodies. Neither one of them had ever felt this way. They felt needed and wanted. Like they belonged somewhere. Without saying a word, they claimed each other.
He took the job because no one else in the wizarding world would hire him. luckily there were a lot of high class people who got off on fucking ex death eaters. He no lived in studio apartment he paid for with hooking. He moved out of the mansion after his mother and father left the country right after the war 7 years ago.
"Me too. Oh, fuck Harry!" Draco screamed as he followed, and all his tentacles released on and inside harry.
"Put him on his knees." Miguel moved from his desk and stood in front of Draco. He griped his face and force him to look up. "Your mine and I'll do with you as I please." He then unzipped his pants and took his stiffening member out. "Now suck!"
"I'm sorry that happened to you, and I’m sorry I don't trust you. I don't trust anyone anymore. I'm just so afraid it'll happen again." Draco began to sob.
He pushed his chest against Harry’s back and whispered in his ear, "I'm taking you." He felt Harry shake and moan, so he flipped him over and crawled between his legs.  He spelled Harry completely naked. It felt so good being on top of him he almost just dove in, but he wanted to savor the moment. He left wet open-mouthed kisses all the way up his chest.
He felt Draco pull his body close and his lips against his ear. " I'm not done with you yet. Do you need something to help you recover?"
Draco kept glancing out of the corner of his eye to look at Harry as he ate. Every time he did, he couldn't help but notice that the green eyes never left him. His stare was starting to make the butterflies in his stomach flutter harder, completely obliterating his appetite, so he turned to look at him. "Are you alright Professor?" He asked not able to keep the smile off his face.
"You're welcome. Goodnight and good luck. Go get him dragon." pansy hung up the phone and went back to bed.
He looked out over the table watching as kids started to flood into the great hall. Looking down the table he could see Granger taking her seat as professor of Transfiguration and head of Gryffindor, a position she accepted 5 years ago after she grew tired of the ministry. Next to her was Longbottom, Professor of Herbology, and Weasley sat on her other side as the new Quidditch referee.
A few weeks past of them just passing each other in the corridors, and every time Harry would give him a smile and a nod sending electricity through his body. He just couldn't understand it. He had never felt like this before.
Harry made a metal note of the pronoun Draco used, but was more curious as to why Draco thought he was better off alone. He decided to leave it before he pushed Draco too far.
"You can't blame yourself, and we can't blame him." I tried my best to understand his words, but even for someone as smart as me. I looked at him confused.
"Harry you don't have to say it back just because I said it. Please don't say it unless you mean it. Your silence right now won't hurt me, I promise. I'd rather you not say it if you don't mean it than have you lie to me to make me feel good." He smiled and brushed my cheek one last time.
"He called you cute! I love things that are cute, like our cat Griffin! He's cute and I love him!" Scorpius was beaming.
Harry smiled and slowly started moving his hips. Draco started slamming back making Harry fuck him harder and harder. Harry finally gripped his hip in one hand and his shoulder in the other and started pounding him hard.
"Well I think that's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard." Draco said stopping just for a minute before returning to what he was doing. Harry's hips started to buck and roll trying to find friction.
"I need to feel more of you." Harry said as he started undoing Draco's pants. They both took each other's pants off and began grinding on each through their boxers.
"I told you it would be hotter if we waited till this moment." Draco giggled. "Fuck Harry." He moaned as Harry found his sweet spot.
Before he brought the paddle down this time he reached in his pocket and turned the vibrator on full blast. Five thwacks later Harry was shaking again with a throbbing cock.
"I really wanted to talk to you." Harry smiles a little more normally when he saw Draco had a little bit of a smile on his face.
Once there he immediately slipped his shoes off and crawled under the covers, curling up completely under the duvet.
He swung his legs out of bed and stood up then walked into his living room and sat on the sofa. He accioed his wallet and thumbed around in it for the right card. finally, he pulled out a little black card that read "The Underground Night club; exotic dancers, escorts, and Professional Dominatrix". A work friend had given it to him one day when he was complaining about his sex life.
"Yep." Harry smiled as he got down to eye level of the 5-year-old. "During the Triwizard tournament. I out flew him on my broom."
"Harry!?" He cried. Tear started pouring down his cheeks as he took Harry into his arms as gently as he could.
"Do you need me to come be with him while you're at work?" Hermione asked watching as Ron changed his mind and, also, helped himself to some coffee.
After Harry finally peeled his eyes away from Draco's body, he finally read the text and just about had a heart attack.
That night neither one of them could sleep. Draco was up all-night thinking about how he might have missed the chance to be with the man he cared for so much. Harry was trying to think of any way he could get Draco to change his mind.
Draco took his seat at the Professors' table. It had been 13 years since the war and, while he enjoyed being a healer at St. Mungo's, he was thrilled to get Headmaster McGonagall's letter asking him to train under Madam Pomphrey and become Hogwarts’s new Matron.
"But what if it's positive. That'll put you at risk to catch it. I couldn't live with myself if I did that to you." Draco pressed himself into Harry's arms.
"I've... never... been fucked... like that! Holy fuck!" Draco exclaimed through gasps of air. "Harry where have you been my whole life?!"
"Pansy? Why are you here? I have to be at the hospital in..." I looked at my watch, "an hour." She stepped out of the way revealing a disheveled Granger with old tears dried to her cheeks.
I smiled looking at the silver band round his finger and rolled over pressing my face into his firm chest. I started to feel my husband begin to stir.
"Sorry I'm late." He Announced to the now quiet hall as he walked, "Had one last mission to accomplish for the ministry."
"Thank you so much! I hope so too!" Harry exclaimed then he closed the call and went back to pacing. He still didn't know how to ask. 20 minute later he decided he'd just call and see how it went. He gabbed another handful of floo powder and made the call.
"Draco please come here baby." Harry said quietly," none of this is your fault baby. You were raped repeatedly. You didn't agree to any of this." Draco curled up into Harry’s arms and bawled into his shoulder.
"Scorpius’s mother passed away when he was born, and I remarried after, but it didn’t work out. I got divorced about 8 months ago, and I’m raising Scorpius all on my own now. well that hasn't really changed. My ex was never really there." Draco crossed his arms and looked down.
"Ten years ago, today you awoke in a hospital bed, after nearly dying." He pressed another kiss against my head. "You've lived ten more years than you wanted to." I Could see a tear forming in his eye.
"Draco, I need it, please!" Harry cried. Draco started to push in just the tip. Just enough to tease and prepare harry. He began working in more and more till harry was a moaning mess. It felt amazing to have something so tight around him. The tentacle was so sensitive, and he discovered he didn’t need to pump, he could just force blood through it and make it pulsate in a way let left both men grunting and moan and clawing at each other.
He looked up at the clock that read "10" and realized he had to work early the next morning. He shook his head and looked back at his phone. He debated following Draco but he was having a hard time deciding if he should. After about 10 minutes of contemplating he hit the follow button hoping Draco wouldn't see. Then he laid his phone down and went to sleep.
I wanted to say something, anything, but I just couldn't find the words. "What do you need me to do?"
"Fiiiiine, but is going to be the best damn dessert you ever had." Draco said as harry turned around and wrapped his arms around his neck.
"No! Keep going! You feel so good!" Draco yelled as he moved back making Harry push in faster till he was completely inside. Draco had never felt so full. "Oh my god Harry! Fuck me!"
Draco froze and turned around; his eyes widen in shock. Harry saw him mouth the word "Potter?" Before turning and running to the bathroom.
"I can't feel my arm." He quietly chuckled against my ear. I giggled and wrapped my arms tightly around him as years of happy memories flooded into my brain.
They apparated home and immediately Draco fell to his knees crying. "How could this happen? Is this the world getting back at me for everything I've done?" He sobbed.
Somehow, I knew immediately who she was talking about and I felt the air leave my lungs, "How?" I asked after inhaling deeply. She looked as if she was fighting not to break down again, so Pansy started rubbing little circles on her back.
The super market was quite busy, but he did his best to make his way through the aisles. He was just turning the corner of the frozen food section when he his cart crashed into another cart.
"H-harry?" He felt a strange sensation in his chest at the sound of his name in Draco's voice. Draco grabbed his hand. "Where am I?"
McGonagall was smiling at him from behind the podium "Quite all right, Everyone I would like to introduce the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Harry Potter."
"Draco, are these the drawings I was watching you do all week last week?" I nodded. "Awe, angel, I love Them. You're getting the lion, right?"
Harry was shaking but he managed to stutter out, "Y-y-yes master." Draco pulled out and slammed back in making Harry scream again. Harry’s ass gripped Draco's cock so nicely and he felt so warm, Draco was already so close to cumming. He threw his head back as he pounded harder.
Harry crawled up on top and started to slowly slide inside Draco till Draco grabbed his ass and pulled him, forcefully, the rest of the way in. Both threw they heads back in pleasure as Harry began to slam against Draco's ass.
Harry looked down contemplating if he wanted to say it or not. He finally built up enough of his courage and decided to just come clean. "Well..." Draco leaned in closer, "when I first saw you actually."
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco slowly so he had time to refuse if he wanted. He pulled Draco close then grabbed Draco's ass and pushed their pelvises together so Draco could feel his erection.
"Don't walk away from me!" Ommin whisper yelled and grabbed Draco's arm hard enough to leave a bruise. Draco wanted to scream and run, but he gathered his courage and looked Ommin in the eye, "What, are you going to do, hit me, in front of all my coworkers?" then he ripped his arm away and walked to his office.
"Draco this is Granger." his stomach did a flip. If Granger was calling something must have happened to Harry.
"No! No, I want to more than anything in this world. That's my biggest dream. It's just... I promised myself I wouldn't date for a while. Till I’m comfortable on my feet."
"Of course, Draco. I love you and I'm here to protect you." Harry kisses the top of Draco's head and caressed his face. Draco tilted his head up and kissed Harry's lips ever so gently. Harrys heart melted. He kissed Draco back putting all of his emotion into it, wishing it would take away all of Draco's pain.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he did as he was told. As he took off his sticky boxers his cock was dripping with cum. Draco smirked and walked towards him. With two fingers he swiped up some of Harry's cum.
When I'm not seeing their faces on the streets I'm seeing them in my dreams. Reliving their deaths one after another; Sirius falling into the vale, Dobby pierced by the dagger, Bellatrix's laugh as she murders Tonks, Dolohov taking Remus down without a care, watching the Weasley's cry over Fred's lifeless body, Cedric lying limp in the graveyard, Snape holding his bleeding throat with tears on his cold cheeks. All of them, even the deaths I didn't see, were in perfect view like some terrible film put on display for me every night. Not even drugs helped.
"W-what happened with the job?" Draco was shocked to hear himself stuttering and quickly looked down at the table.
I started to take them three at a time, with each swallow I thought of someone's face. Someone who lost their life for me, or someone who lost someone because of me. Counting my regrets till I was down to my last two pills. My head was starting to spin, and my eyes felt heavy, my stomach felt like it was on fire, but I loved the burn. I knew it was going to be the last thing I felt. I rubbed my fingers over the last two pills in my hands, and laughed, "I'm coming mum and dad." I swallowed them and laid back on the couch, waiting for darkness to take over.
I pressed my face into his shoulder and he pulled me tighter to his chest as I continued to sob. I cried for what seem like an hour before I remembered who was holding me and memories flooded into my brain. I could feel the scar I made on his chest all those years ago. I had almost murdered this man.  I pulled away from him and could have sworn I saw hurt him his eyes.
"Yeah. Before I had no problem with missions like this, but now I have something to come back to and I don’t want you to go away." Harry was fighting back tears at the thought of never seeing Draco again.
Draco grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him to the bed. He bent Harry over it then leaned over him. As he undid Harry's trousers he whispered in his ear, "Only a few seconds and I already have to punish you."
"I'm a healer actually." Draco smiled big. He was quite proud of himself. "After the war I decided I wanted to help people, and I figured this would be the best way to do so."
It didn't take him long to get everything for chicken Parmesan, and soon he was knocking on Draco's door again.
"Yeah." Harry scratches the back of his neck, "Griffins just so damn sexy!" They both laughed. Harry took in a deep breath and gathered the courage for what he wanted to ask next. "Do you want to sit and catch up for a bit?" He asked his heart about to leap out of his chest.
"Can sleep with us?" Draco asked again. Harry nodded and picked Scorpius's limp body up. He led Draco to the room and laid the little boy between them. then he transfigured both their clothes and wrapped his arms around both Scorpius and Draco. He watched over both of them for a few hours before he, himself, fell asleep.
Harry carried Scorpius to bed and Draco tucked him in. Then they went down to the kitchen for a glass of wine.
"I'll be fine, Draco. Just a few more minutes of this then we can go." Harry relaxed his head and snuggled closer to Draco's chest. Draco smiled and wrapped his arms tighter.
"You're also one of his biggest regrets." Hermione said looking at me through her eyelashes. I was taken aback by her words. Why was I one of his regrets? "He almost killed you, when he knew you were just a pawn."
"interesting, not what I expected you would do after school. Are you married?" Harry asked praying to the Gods the answer would be no.
"Good boy." Draco smirked. He waved his wand and the bonds released. He sat in his chair again. "Come here Potter." Draco ordered. Harry obeyed and stood before him. "On your knees in front of me." Harry got down on his knees. "You're going to suck my cock." Harry looked nervous. "What's the matter potter? Never sucked a cock before?"
Ommin threw up his hands in surrendered and backed off the porch. "You tell them I will be seeing them. That's a promise." Then he apparated away.
"Do you really mean that?" Harry didn't believe Draco. There was a long pause then he heard the stall door unlock.
"Mm thank... oh fuck!" Draco said as Harry gripped his cock and licked it from base to tip. He then took his balls into his mouth and sucked them both gently. "Oh my god! You're so good with your mouth, baby!" Draco nearly yelled.
"Draco, what happened?" Harry stroked his cheek to get him to look at him again. Tears were forming in Draco's eyes.
Draco scooted close to him and cupped his face so he could look at the dazzling emeralds, "Harry I wish you would have told me." He slowly and gently brought their lips together. it was a slow sweet kissed that still brought out all they had held back for so many years. Draco’s finger wound themselves into Harry’s hair and Harry's arm wrapped around Draco's waits bringing them in closer till they were laying on the couch.
"Mmhmm he put up a good chase but I was faster!" Harry said as he retold the story from his point of view.
"Draco," Harry cupped his cheek and tilted his head so he was looking into his eyes, "I'd do anything for you." They stared at each other for a few second, Harry wanted to kiss him so badly, but he thought it wasn't the right time. Draco was secretly hoping the same thing, but was too afraid to make the first move. Plus, Scorpius was crying in Draco's lap holding on to both him and Harry.
"Oh, yes please." Harry said as Draco poured him a glass. "Now are you going to answer my question?"
He got up from his chair, sat his book down and took a seat beside me on the sofa. "Harry I can see right through you. I promise everything will be okay. If I notice any change in your behavior or see that you need an out, I will help you. Can you promise me you'll try though?" He had his arms wrapped around me and was staring into my eyes as if he was attempting to see my soul.
He continued to follow Draco's posted for the next week. Draco posted every day, and every time he did Harry got butterflies. He loved looking and Griffin’s beautiful green eyes but he really got excited when Draco posted a selfie. Which wasn't near as often as post he made about griffin.
They sat and talked for an hour about what they did after the war. They didn't bring up any of the sad part just kept the mood light and relaxed and it felt good. They were so happy that they could laugh together now.
"Oh well. Leave him there to suffer. He's not going to make it this time." Another said and they all walked away.
I was just stepping out of the shower when there was a loud knock on my front door. "Hold on!" I yelled. Who could be here so early. I thought to myself as I threw my button up shirt on and zipped up my pants. There was a second knock even louder than the first.
"Say I'm beautiful, or perfect? I'm far from, and even I was why do you care." He could notice the tears forming in the corners of my eyes, so he began to stroke my hair.
Tears were now pouring down Draco’s cheeks as he let out scream after scream. It felt as though he was being torn apart. He looked down at the rug as the man pounded into him. He could see blood starting to trickle down his leg. It made him feel light headed.
"Dear gods, the things you do to me." He whispered against my skin and he began to bite and suck a sensitive spot on my skin, surely leaving his mark.
"Harry, bloody, Potter?" The man Infront of him said, "You've got to be joking? Harry, bloody, Potter is shagging my husband!?"
They left the office with Miguel walking in front of Harry who had his wand stabbing into Miguel’s back so no one would see.
He turned and saw Ommin walking towards him with a smirk on his face. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears and he thought he was going to be sick.
It gripped me a threw me into a bright room. My eye lid fluttered open, and I threw my head back and sobbed.
"Of course, I do! I love Smithy's! I'll see you there!" Harry was so happy now. This completely changed his day around. he finished his shopping, loaded up his car and Headed to the ice cream shop. He pulled in just as Draco was getting Scorpius out of the car.
"He's one of our highest paying customers and you'll only spend twelve hours with him." Miguel continued to talk. "Oh, and Draco, Dress high class muggle. I'll text you the address." as he hung up and owl flew in through dracos open window and dropped a small packet of papers. He picked it up and read through it. It was mostly things like not telling anyone including friends, family, and especially the press who he was with, so he signed them then went to take a shower.
"Well I work here, duh. Still a little slow, I see, Potter." Draco said but there was no malice in his voice like there used to be.
Harry downed his whiskey in one shot, "Can I have another?" Draco rolled his eyes and poured him another.
"It's ok I had it coming." Draco said. Entering the room, he finally saw just how bad Harry was. His face was black and blue and there were scars from all the cuts the healers had healed.
Harry and he two fellow Aurors had just followed a couple of the death eaters they were after to an abandoned mansion. Not thinking about there being more death eaters inside Harry told his two companions to go around back while he pinned them down in the front. Harry had made a mistake.
I stared at my fingers; every crease, every shadow. They almost looked fake. Like they were drawn by some realism artist.
"Harry Potter!? The man from duh stories?!" Draco blushed hard. he didn't want harry to know he talked about him so much.
"Draco? C-could you stay?" I nodded and after removing my shoes crawled into bed next to him. To my surprise he curled up next to me wrapping my arm around him and fell asleep. I soon followed nuzzling my face into his perfect jet-black hair.
"Not quite your shoes untied." Harry said then bopped Teddy's nose when he went to look. "Made you look!" They both laughed.
"No, actually I was told I'd be best for the job by the nurses." Harry spoke calmly and now Draco felt bad for his sharp tongue.
Harry greedily took his cock into his mouth. Swirling his tongue around the tip and using his hand to play with Draco's balls.
"No shit!? The famous Harry Potter is gay too?!" Draco exclaimed. Harry rubbed the back of his neck and nodded. "How long have you known?"
I sat back in my chair and took another deep breath, trying to clear my mind, "Okay, I'll see what I can do." I stood from my chair and was enveloped into a surprising embrace by Hermione.
"The tentacle part was a but weird but..." Harry pushed Draco to the bed and kissed him, "it was an amazing dream." He smiled.
"It highly unlikely he'll show up. he has a kid and you have to know the right people, people that hate death eaters, but if he does how will you tell it's him." Hermione asked.
"Okay." Harry smiled. Draco wasn't expecting that. "So, the story starts with and orphaned baby boy left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle. He was neglected till he was old enough to clean and cook. They forced him to live in a cupboard under the stairs for years, and there was always a surplus of abuse. Both mental and physical. His aunt would call him stupid or freak. His uncle would beat him senseless, until he was bloody and bruised sometimes. When he was finally able to go to Hogwarts, it became his only home, but after every summer he'd come back malnourished, bruised, and so depressed he sometimes wished Voldemort would just find him and finish the job."
Harry unlocked the door and sent Ron a text saying where he went then they apparated back to Harry's place.
"You're just so fucking sexy!" Harry exclaimed. He walked over and poured himself a glass of wine, topping off Draco's as well.
"You can have me." Harry whispered in his ear as he nibbled the lobe. he stared to grind causing as minimal fiction as possible, just enough to tease. Draco tilted his head back and clawed at Harry's back.
Draco had gotten up from the couch and was now stand with one arm out stretched and the other on Scorpius's shoulder. "It’s nice to meet you Teddy." He said as smiled and shook Teddy's hand.
"You must be Ommin?" Harry said trying his best to hide his anger, and wondering how he managed to get past the wards.
"Thank you, Draco." Ron whispered. He looked a little defeated and I know my face showed my surprise.
"When we first met, he was very sweet to me. He talked me into marrying him after only 5 months of dating. Once he got what he wanted, a husband and a son, he completely changed. It started with him just slapping me around when I did or said something wrong. Each time he would apologize and buy me something nice and be extra sweet to me, so I’d forget, but then it started happening more and more, and each time it got more violent. What sacred me the most is he never once used magic on me. He always used his hands." Draco said as he started to cry. anger was building in Harry but he hid it well, because he didn't want to scare Draco.
Harry slipped out of his shoes then removed his socks. After that he started on his trousers. Draco leaned forward in his chair placing his drink on the table and steepling his fingers. Harry continued to meet his gaze which seemed hungry and lustful. It was starting to drive him crazy. He wanted to be touched again so badly.
"Well, with medication and potions you'll be able to live a normal life actually. You'll even be able to have sex normally without fear of spreading the disease." The doctor said.
"Draco, it's ok! I just don't want to do it if I think you're going to regret it." Harry slid over and gently removed Draco's hands from his face. He kissed his knuckles. "It's ok love. I'm glad you trusted me enough to give me that. It means the world to me. I just want to make sure we're going at your pace and not the pace you think I want."
"Harry, don't you ever say that again, to anyone! You of all people deserve happiness!" He stroked Harry's cheek, "I want you to be happy."
"It's where I take care of you and make sure you are comfortable with the events that just occurred. I also use this time to soothe any pain I may have caused you physically and emotionally. In short it's a way for me to make sure you're okay." Draco said.
"Seriously, da? Where are we going? I really want to know too." They both gave me their best puppy dog eyes knowing I couldn't resist. God's, I love my little family.
I heard him chuckle, "I'm far from an angel, Harry." I cringed realizing I had just spoke my thoughts but was quickly pulled from it when I heard his voice whisper my name. It was so familiar but, in the way, that I had realized I'd never heard his voice speak it before. I blinked and rubbed my eyes and finally sharp features and blue eyes filled my vision.
Draco froze for a minute, "Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry. You're right! I'm not ready for this. I shouldn't have taken it this far. I'm such a tease. I'm so sorry!" Draco moved to the other side of the couch and put his face in his hand, embarrassed at what he'd just done. The loss of contact made Harry die on the inside.
