But the steady exhalations lull him to sleep, and as always, he dreams of Harry.
He spent most of his days and nights running his pub, or experimenting with new drinks for the menus, or when he’d finally get home, he just ordered take out, took off his trousers, and watched reality shows on the telly. He was just Harry: a regular guy, arguably a workaholic, and an awkward person who didn’t really know how to interact with people in relationships.
Grateful to finally be alone, Harry ripped his wet shirt over his head, grimacing as it peeled away from his skin. He wadded it up angrily, throwing it towards the swinging doors of the back room.
than just fucking. To me, anyway.” Harry’s tongue darts out, swiping against his lower lip, his eyes dropping to Draco’s mouth. “I didn’t realize you felt the same.”
And that just
you?”
He just couldn’t seem to really find anyone willing to invest in him, long term. It was always about the lightning scar, or fucking the guy who’d killed the Dark Lord, or even his wealth, when he hooked up with muggles. Nobody seemed to want to bother with him when they realized he wasn’t
“Sure, mate. They’re terrible,” Harry deadpanned, utterly amused at Draco’s attempt to deflect. “You know, I’ve heard you telling off those dates of yours that you bring by. And it very much sounded like you enjoyed the cocktails.”
Harry leaned across the bar and grabbed a bottle of his finest tequila, two shot glasses, then cast a quick
He thought nothing of it the first few times, different men always accompanying him and joining him for a drink. Malfoy would select something new off the menu, rattle off a series of descriptors for the taste, give him his compliments, and return to a table.
The shame burns fresh as Draco finally looks away, eyeing the rings on the counter.
Draco’s eyes flashed open, having at some point slipped closed while he untangled the mix of flavors. His cheeks flushed as he glanced at Pansy before placing the spoon back on its plate.
There’s a stinging behind Draco’s eyes, wetness gracing his cheeks, saltiness coating his tongue, and Draco is resolutely
” but had continued to rant as he
But for now, he sighs into the quiet of the room as hands turn to lips. First to his collarbone, now mended, shards knitted back into place. Then to his hip where a new scar joins the others, each in their devotion to this man who has marked him, changed him irrevocably over the years. Scars he now traces with his fingertips as he eyes his reflection, savoring the finality of their connection. Even if severed in their physicality, the scars will always remain as a part of him. The pieces of flesh tendered and raw will be there on his body to mark the passage of their time together.
“Potter. It’s been awhile.” Malfoy nodded his head to his companion, who wandered off to secure a table.
Harry makes a pained noise, something desperate and primal, before lowering his face and pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s. A sharp tug of want pulls at Draco’s chest, pressing him closer, sinking him into Harry’s skin, gasping against his mouth. Harry takes, and takes, and takes, and Draco is all too willing to give him everything. Every bit of himself, every broken shard, every stitch of his pieced together heart. Threaded from some of the lowest of his lows, from his darkness, and his shame and his selfishness. He’d tear it apart the second he was asked.
They parted, resting their foreheads together to catch their breath. Harry gently brushed the hair off Draco’s face before pressing a small kiss to his cheek and stepping away.
Malfoy nodded, a serious look on his face as he grasped the stem of the glass and inspected its contents. He looked pleased as he watched the small pearls swirling and settling to the bottom of the glass as the cool fog from the dry ice curled into the air around them.
Harry places his palms on either side of Draco’s face, tugging him up before crushing their lips together. It’s hardly a kiss at all, messy and broken, whispers and murmured moans and desperate pleas filling the space between them, each of their faces wet with sweat and grief, and it’s not perfect, but it’s
But he can’t. They both know it, the unspoken gesture being taken for what it is, in the same way that they both know what comes next.
Harry slowly broke down the bar, pulling the pour spouts off bottles, replacing caps, cleaning up and refilling the garnish bar before casting a
Malfoy tugged the bottom of the shirt down, a final sliver of skin being hidden away beneath the dark maroon fabric. Harry admired the way the Seven Spirits logo stretched over his body. The white vinyl letters made the fabric bunch and pucker over his chest, and a nipple peeked out from behind an S as Malfoy sighed. Malfoy ruffled his fingers through his hair absentmindedly. Harry’s fingers itched to reach out and touch him, to tug him closer, to run his hands over those now hidden muscles, and Malfoy would lean into him, perhaps eagerly undress him and tug that blasted t-shirt back off and-
“Evasive?” Harry stalked around the counter, watching as Draco turned to face him. “
“What-” Draco starts, placing the ring down on the counter beside its companion. He skims the stack of letters, wrinkled and folded open as they are. Varying in length, but always signed with that insouciant, curling G. Draco lingers on one in particular, standing out amongst the perfectly penned, a messily scrawled single line drawing his eye.
“Ah, so you do make some of the classics here, after all,” Pansy mused, “That’s one I recognize.

of them against his skin filling the silence, before carefully turning his face, letting his forehead drop against Draco’s shoulder, his breath burning his skin. Draco stills, caught between wanting desperately to lean into the anomalous touch and pushing him away, feeling the need to shield himself and keep Harry at arm’s length, needing the strength from that distance to finally,
. In a way.
It hurts more than he thought it would, the anguish searing sharp through Draco’s bones, burning his blood, and he sobs with relief and despair. He knows that, for him, these stolen moments so few and far between, will never be enough. That he will never be replete of him.
Draco gently tugs Harry back, dragging him away from his cock with a quiet gasp, watching as it inches out of his delectable mouth, lips slick with spit and swollen red. He gives himself this moment to look, just the barest second, as Harry’s eyes open, burning, glazed over with his own wanting. He sears it into his memory, promises himself he’ll savor it later. But right now, it’s time for the second act, for Draco to play his part, to ensure the natural order of this
“Thank you, but I think this shirt is a lost cause, to be honest.”
Harry sighed, admiring the way Draco’s cock quietly slapped against his bare stomach. He reached out to grasp the shaft and gave it a few gentle strokes, thumb curling against the gathering pre-cum. Leaning forward, Harry tongued at the slit, swirling around the reddened tip before finally letting it fill his mouth, bobbing his head, gradually working his way down until his mouth met his hand.
” Harry’s voice is hoarse, wrecked in his desire, broken between gasping breaths that fill the room. “
Harry wasn’t quite sure how he felt. Not jealous, given Malfoy wasn’t paying her more than polite attention.  And it certainly wasn’t anything he’d define as
“Business partners, Harry. Not dates, you berk.”
Most of the men were largely their age, maybe a tad older, and seemed to hail from the upper echelon of society. He’d typically catch a few words from them, most of them grumbling about their drinks or offering suggestions on how

Because this owl is
in a single thought.
Harry tracked Draco’s movements, keeping busy as he wiped down the bartop and taking a deep breath to steady his nerves. Maybe he’d ask him out, if he got the chance. For a coffee, or lunch. Something casual. Something low-key enough that he wouldn’t have to worry about being an overt sign of his interest in Draco, but pointed enough that if that affection were, perhaps, returned then-
Harry kissed down and down and down, finally dropping to his knees, licking and sucking the dripping foam off Draco’s chest. His lips eventually met that trail of sandy blonde hair he’d seen before. He raised his hands hesitantly to Draco’s waist, laving his tongue against Draco’s sharp hip bones, leaving a soft kiss before glancing up.
But instead, he nods, tucking his chin to his shoulder, chewing his bottom lip, cheeks flaring with a fresh burst of heat.
“This is quite good, Potter. How does the colour charm work?” Malfoy reached distractedly for his back pocket, bringing out a handful of galleons.
Draco gulped and shook his head slightly, but raised the glass to his lips and tossed his head back. Harry stood stock still as he watched Draco’s throat bob as he swallowed the liquor, setting the glass on the bartop before pulling Harry closer, his breath hot against his skin. Harry gasped as Draco’s tongue delicately reached out, skimming against his collarbone and gently lapping up the foam. His mouth pressed harder, licks turning to kisses, teeth nipping slightly as he worked his way up Harry’s neck to nibble his earlobe. He breathed against him for a moment and Harry took in large, panting breaths before Draco left a soft kiss on his neck.
A small cry slips from Harry’s lips, his hands moving to tug at his own riotous curls. But Draco can feel his cock leaking between them, twitching traitorously each time he says his name and it bolsters his instincts. He
Harry felt his face fall, attempting to rearrange his features and stifle his disappointment. On the one hand, it was technically good news that Draco hadn’t been bringing failed dates to his bar. But Harry still couldn’t be sure of having a chance with him, of having his affections returned.
Harry was thankful for the chance to busy his hands, and entirely grateful to Malfoy for not forcing them into some version of polite
“No? Er, what-”
, which he had previously dismissed as a result of his upbringing.
Harry startled at the unfamiliar voice, sharp and ringing against the noisy din of the bar, glancing up to find the delicate features of
“Uh. What?” Harry murmured through his daze, stealing a glance at Malfoy’s lips, before meeting his eyes again. “What was that?”
Harry waited patiently for the exact moment that the drink burst across Draco’s tongue. He’d become rather invested in Draco’s feedback. It was a strange joy that flooded him, a sense of warmth and fondness, much like the first time he presented a new cocktail to Ginny or Terry, similar to the feeling that settled in his chest seeing his group of friends meet at his bar every week.
being boring. He was perfectly content running his pub, watching his shitty shows, having dinner with Ron and Hermione on Thursday, and brunch at the Burrow on Sunday, and teaching Teddy how to fly, and read, and how to bake biscuits and the animals in the alphabet. It was a quiet life, one he’d worked hard for. One he’d fought a war for. He took peace from the simple pleasure of his friends and family and his work.
But tonight, he truly did
“What kind of partners?”
Harry was honestly surprised he hadn't seen him here until now. He hadn’t planned for his pub to be considered top-tier, the opposite of what anyone would expect from Harry. But the fact of the matter was, his menu ended up incredibly posh, and a large portion of his patrons deemed his drinks "the haute couture of cocktails." If there was anyone that made him think of

“Tasty, too.” Draco tapped a finger against his lip, apparently wavering on whether or not to continue. “I love a good gin cocktail, especially when they have such a rich history.
in his bedroom.
“It’s-” Malfoy smacked his lips slightly, peering down at his glass with surprise, before meeting Harry’s eye. “It’s very tasty, actually. Unexpected. Grapefruit is already quite tart on its own, so I was a bit worried with the stacking of the lemon juice and bitters that it’d be too much. But somehow,
Harry shudders, fingertips pulsing against Draco’s thighs. He can feel the sharp, metal edge of Harry’s wedding band digging into his flesh, knows he’ll have a bruise there in the morning, a small imperfection that only he’d be able to see. It’s one of the only marks he’ll vanish, not wanting to think about its implications; the rest he’ll keep for himself.
Harry pulls back, their breaths mingling in the lingering space between them.
He gently unlatches the window. The bronze fixture’s gleam is muted in the morning light as it falls aside, before Draco pushes the windows open to let in a nondescript little grey owl. One that, oddly enough, looks a bit familiar. It nips lightly at his finger as he reaches to untie the parchment from its leg, before turning its neck to the side and hooting gently.
A niggling sense of curiosity planted itself firmly in his gut; familiar, in the way that it was a feeling that he knew like the back of his hand, especially in regards to Malfoy. Different in its accompanying pang of confusion against the backdrop of Harry’s growing fondness for the man.

The man was easily twice their age, portund, with an awful silent film villain mustache that he continually curled up at the edges with his fingertips. He was
He felt his breath hitch, his heart a steady rushing beat in his chest, his fingers clutching desperately at his sides to prevent himself from reaching out to touch. Because that would certainly be unprofessional, and not welcomed, and... and... and….
Draco shifts, hands moving slowly to rest on Harry’s shoulders, trembling as they trail up to thread themselves into long, inky locks, fingernails gently grazing against his scalp, doing what he can to soothe Harry. He knows it’s selfish, that they’re here by his actions alone, but it’s all he can do these days to ease his own guilt. He wants to smooth Harry’s wrinkled brow, wipe away the anxiety of the evening, erase all the tension between them that reminds them that Harry is not his, that he’s not Harry’s - not outside of these moments.
Malfoy cleared his throat, standing and laying a few galleons on the bar, tucking his rumpled shirt under his arm.
“I’m not, though I do pride myself on having a refined palette. Thanks for the drink, Potter. And the shirt.”
Draco swallows thickly, limbs shaking from the stress of waiting for Harry to adjust, watching Harry breathe through the initial intensity, furrowed brow finally smoothing as he begins to rock his hips back against him with a low moan. Draco almost loses it immediately, the novelty of being able to experience Harry face to face, to watch as he becomes blissed out. Draco is enraptured, drowning in Harry. He bites his cheek to distract himself from the sheer sight of it.
Pansy laughed loudly and grabbed Draco’s shoulder with an iron grip. Her nails dug into his starched white shirt as if physically restraining him from fleeing the scene.
It’s a bit sweet and smoky.”
know, but steadfastly refused to acknowledge it. Him. Draco.
“Sorry, we’re closed for the evening.” Harry lifted his gaze, surprised to find Draco slipping his jacket off and placing it on the bartop. “
in a sneering, holier-than-thou tone of voice, it was Malfoy.
He’d hit a bit of a dry spell as of late, not really interested in the work it currently took him to get laid and get out without being recognized, or in the endless questioning that came with dating someone new, wizard or muggle. So perhaps that was why he’d taken an unnatural notice to Malfoy, and the sheer amount of dates the man seemingly had.
Harry paused, feeling the shaker cool to the touch, the slight beginnings of condensation coating the outside. He quickly set it back on the bar top and unseated the shaker. He placed the strainer over the top of the glass, smiling slightly as an ethereal fog revealed itself as the drink was poured into the glass.
He found himself irritated, disconcerted at Draco’s abrupt departure. A niggling worry sat in the back of his mind as he waved goodbye to the last of his patrons and began clearing their table. He waved a hand carelessly, charming the open sign to switch off and dimming the lights, no longer worried about any muggle bystanders.
Draco stammered, glancing away, before clearing his throat.
A tapping at the window breaks Draco from his reverie, starting slightly as Harry mutters something under his breath that sounds suspiciously like
“Ooh,
Always Draco’s flat. Never
“Yes, yes, I know, Potter. I
His lips never leave Harry’s, determined to not give Harry a chance to
Harry wasn’t entirely sure when it had happened, or why. But the way that Draco’s face lit up before he placed his spoon back on the plate solidified the idea that Harry didn’t want to lose this. He would be perfectly content watching Draco try his drinks and offer clever quips and serve acerbic comments up to his failed dates in that biting way of his. He was charming and prickly, a juxtaposition of personality that he’d never had the opportunity to see before. Like some sort of cactus that you lovingly tended; watering it, turning it just so in the window, sucking away pinpricks from your fingers while you watched it bloom.
Draco arched an impetuous brow before laughing sharply, his hand hovering behind the man’s back as he guided him towards the bar. Toward Harry. Harry’s bar.
Harry’s eyes are fierce, darkened, as they finally meet Draco’s gaze, before pointing his spatula at a stack of letters littering the countertop, turning back to the pans on the hob.
this. He needs to be as close as possible, to be
A sound of bewilderment must have slipped from his lips, because Harry turned abruptly to face him, hands cradling the spatula awkwardly in front of his chest as a sheepish grin broke across his face. Harry’s eyes dart to Draco’s naked thigh peeking out from the loosely tied robe, skim over a bare shoulder exposed as fine silk slips, and traverse his bare chest, lingering on silvery scars splicing through a pink nipple. A flush spreads across Draco’s cheeks, and he awkwardly fidgets, tucking his messy hair behind a burning ear before bringing it forward again. Knowing how he must look, how Harry had left his mark on him.
at Malfoy. He ducked quickly to place the row of glasses - now shiny and clean - beneath the bar top. He popped back up only to be met with a look of amusement on Malfoy’s aristocratic features.
Harry laughed, quickly shaking another set of cocktails before pouring them into martini glasses and admiring their pale chartreuse color.
crying. He is not broken, he is not weak. He cannot be crippled from a few pretty words falling from the Savior’s lips, cut down by his supplicating hands skimming his arms, shattered by green eyes. Vibrant, guilty, earnest.
He slowly inches the door open, flinching slightly as it creaks. He slips into the hall and makes his way into the rest of the flat, shoulder sliding soundlessly along the wall, fingers curling over the familiar feel of his hawthorn wand. Draco slowly scans the living room, seeing nothing amiss but his clothing strewn about. Cautiously, he peers around the doorframe into the kitchen, eyes widening as they take in the scene.
There had been a few others, but nobody seemed to spark much of an interest for him. Not like Terry had. And Harry had decided that now that he knew what a real relationship was like, what it felt to be loved and accepted as himself, as just

Harry walked towards the back room, glancing over his shoulder to make sure Malfoy was following him. He pushed open the swinging doors and winced as they knocked against his latest keg shipment. He held the door open for Malfoy to come through, as well. Harry rummaged through the clean towel bin, grabbing a handful. He turned around to hand them over and got his first look at the damage, now exposed under the bright lighting.
The room spins beneath him, the air sucked clean from his lungs, the rug ripped out from under him. Harry’s mindless murmuring is a numbing cacophony adjacent to the buzzing filling his ears as he raises the newest letter to eye level.

Harry held Draco’s eye and he quickly downed his shot, then leaned forward to run his tongue along Draco’s neck, leaving hot open-mouthed kisses as he followed the trail down his chest, nipping his nipple, tongue soothing the bite. Draco moaned low in his throat, hands scrambling to clench themselves in Harry’s hair.
“Uh, I think you’ll like this one,” Harry murmured, desperate for a way to cut the tension and gave in to his own version of
“It’s on the house.”
“I figure you can go first, since my shirt is already off.” Harry gestured vaguely for Draco to raise his glass before grabbing a spoonful of the foam. “You take the shot and then you lick this,” Harry dabbed the foam across his collarbone, letting it sit in the concave of his collarbone, “to chase the tequila.”
“Potter!”
“Well, this was a pleasant experience, gentlemen. Potter, I can genuinely say that cocktail was an absolute treat. I dare say I’ll be back. Draco was right when he argued this was the best bar in London.” Pansy sifted through her clutch, finally finding a tube of lippy and settling back into her seat to reapply it, popping her lips and placing it back in her clutch with a snap.
“What is
When Draco wakes, he is alone. The bed is cold and grey morning light peeks across the rumpled sheets. Wrinkles dip in the shape of where Harry had been. It’d been a foolish thought, thinking he would stay. Draco knew that, had made plans the night before to distance himself from the inevitable outcome. But this is how it works for them, this is the role he’s been slated to play, and, well. He hadn’t expected anything more than that slight deviation,
come to ask you if you wanted to be my partner, Harry. What do you say?”
He held them out stiffly, wondering how quickly he’d be able to escape the room and if maybe there was a secret exit behind all the boxes. Instead, his feet stayed plastered to the floor and his eyes glued to the towels as they rubbed down Malfoy’s body.
Harry turned away, tucking his chin as he attempted to hide a grin at the praise. Warmth settled low in his chest as Malfoy continued to ramble on in that posh way of his, the crisp notes of his accent sharp enough to cut glass. He busied himself putting away the cocktail pearls, placing them back in the small ice box beneath the bartop. He wiped a rag mindlessly against the wooden surface before pausing at Malfoy’s long-winded explanation of flavour. It seemed that he knew quite a bit for being a
He does it anyways, just like he knew he would, weak as he is. His palm slowly reaches up and over, gently threading their fingers together like lovers. Like this means something to both of them.

Harry peppers kisses across his cock, tongue darting out to lap at the head, licking at the pre-cum that’s gathered there in his exploration. He doesn’t look up, not yet fully immersed in this quiet space, the inevitable

Like Harry will be here in the morning.
He opted for a nice pair of jeans and a sharp collared shirt instead of his usual ratty pub tees. With a tight knot of anticipation low in his belly, he wondered if Draco might stop by the bar tonight; if he’d have the chance to talk with him, to see that shiny platinum hair rustled and rumpled by nervous hands. That sense of suspicion now transfigured into
“Er,” Harry started awkwardly, not entirely sure what one says after watching a drink thrown in their ex-rival’s face, “Would you like a towel or something to clean up?”
but he will
yes. Shirts, yes. Er, yes. I think I have some in a box somewhere.” He reached a hand up to his hair as he started looking around the room, finally spotting the box a few feet behind Malfoy.
The din rushed over him like a familiar friend, the sound of his patrons chattering, their glasses clinking, the quiet music all rushing over his senses and dousing him. A sense of calm settled in his bones, relief and comfort loosening his tight shoulders. He stepped behind the bar and waved Malfoy over to a stool on the very end, so he could offer Malfoy specialized service.
Draco slowly lowered his hands, looking up at Harry through his eyelashes. Harry grabbed a spoonful of the foam, tapping it out slowly along Draco’s neck, entranced as he watched it drip down his chest.
“He does know what he’s doing. A big fan of praise, Potter? Being told you’re a good boy?”
He glances back up at Harry, meeting his gaze as he nonchalantly makes himself at home in the kitchen.
A matched set, then. Draco always wondered if his wife’s ring was the same shining gold as Harry’s.
. He dug into the box to find a shirt that would work for him. He emerged with a medium, randomly guessing on Malfoy’s preferred size, and handed it over his shoulder blindly. Malfoy took it from him, as Harry pretended to re-sort the shirts to fit back into the box, resolutely trying to avoid ogling at the shirtless man any further this evening. There was a rustling of fabric behind him, the small ping of buttons hitting the stone floor at their feet. Harry squeezed his eyes shut tightly, fighting the urge to turn around and drink in the sight. A small grunt came before more swishing of cloth over skin, upon which Harry decided he was probably being ridiculous and gave up the ruse of sorting the t-shirts.
The second the words left his lips, Harry realized he’d made a mistake. Those cracks he had so admired, that had made his blood warm and his chest tighten in familiarity; gone. Sealed from the inside, stone-tight.
It wasn’t like he was dating the man. It wasn’t even like he was truly
Draco remains silent, playing his own part perfectly, feeling his veins warm, his blood rush south, Harry’s hands reacquainting themselves with his body as his lips wander closer to his cock. He’s patient, reigning in his desire to guide Harry’s face where he wants it most, waiting. He doesn’t want to break this tentative understanding, doesn’t want to give Harry the chance to think about the consequences too soon. He wants Harry mindless with need, wrecked, throwing caution to the wind. He wants Harry in this gentle way he gets after he’s been injured, handling Draco like spun glass, something delicate to be careful with. He wants to take it, bottle it up, bathe himself in it, store it away for the days when he’s still waiting and he can’t remember how it feels.
much to his consternation. He’d testified for Malfoy, after all, after the war; he’d argued that he should have the right to return to Hogwarts. He’d accepted the apology he was given in a series of trembling words with a handshake and a nod in the eighth year common room, and that was that.
“Everything.” Draco tightens his shoulders, holds Harry’s gaze unwillingly, unrepentantly, feeling warmth bloom bright across his cheeks. “It’s
“Will you wait for me? To make this right and do it proper?” Harry rasps, unbearably vulnerable, all pinked cheeks and swollen lips. “You’ve got me, you’ve got my devotion. Only, Ginny’s last match is today and we were planning to announce the divorce after the season’s over.”
Harry’s heart raced, feeling a sharp swoop in his belly as something akin to

“Well, I can’t say that’s exactly what I expected when I came here tonight.” Draco laughed softly, gently tugging Harry up to press a light kiss to his lips and wiping away the mess he had made of his face.
But he’d like to be.
The pride of ownership and the now familiar rush of creativity. The magic rushing to the tips of his fingers, the awe of watching the science unfold before him. The sweet gratitude he felt in being able to bring together the magic of wix and muggle with an easy pour of liquor and the shake of a wrist, much to the delight of his regular string of customers.
. It’s them, together, and it’s too much all at once. Harry comes with a cry against his mouth, sticky and pulsating between them, arse fluttering and clamping down, wrenching Draco over the edge as his thrusts slow to a near imperceptible pace as he spills into him, before stilling completely. He exhales softly, closing his eyes as he settles against Harry’s forehead, noses brushing, attempting to swallow down his heartache while he waits for his heartbeat to regain its natural tempo.

Harry’s hand found its way around the back of Draco’s waist, the other curling up the side of his neck, soft platinum strands of hair wrapping themselves around Harry’s fingers. Draco whimpered, a shiver breaking across his body.

, Harry,
He wants to keep this. He wants to spend hours in adoration, praising Harry’s bronzed skin, the tufts of hair peeking out from his waistband, the scars littering his frame. He wants to taste him, memorize the feeling, until he knows Harry like the back of his own hand. But he knows it’s impossible, intangible, something that will always remain beyond his grasp. So he takes what he can get, reminds himself of the ticking clock, and moves on far more quickly than his heart wants.
I have one with a lovely red-headed spitfire that I’m going to be late for if we don’t get going. Shall we, darling?”
Harry eyed the clock as he prepared a round of mojito spheres for a six-top, grateful for the ease of this particular order. Friday nights were always particularly busy, and tonight was no exception. As he placed the drinks on a serving tray and called for the server, he wondered if it might be time to expand his staff. Namely, another bartender. Perhaps a bar back, or ideally,
“I can’t believe you know that! Yes! It’s an American cocktail, so anyone who serves them in London is typically just creating them because they’re popular, but they don’t know anything about its history!”
, tied down and tucked away, kept at bay until the next time one of them breaks. He sighs, rolling to his side and half heartedly reaching a palm out to brush against the empty side of the bed.
expect anything to change. This is the reality of them, and what they’ve done: him at home, bones chilled, soul shattered, left wrecked and emotionally drained. Harry at home, with Ginevra, warming his palms with a fresh cup of tea and a peck to his stubbled cheek, excuses of late nights at work getting the better of him these days.
Draco doesn’t want to shatter the illusion just yet. He wants just a few seconds more of this, promises himself that he’ll shake the sleep from his bones and tug himself away before too long. He can still extricate himself from this perilous situation, back away from the ledge of
to transfigure the drink in full view of the other patrons.
Because it’s Harry, in wrinkled trousers, his bare back and shoulders rippling with each flip of the spatula as he… cooks breakfast. And Draco isn’t sure what to do, because this is so far out of their normal roles, so far beyond any expectations he may have ever hopelessly set that he feels
had changed for Harry. That Draco was some sort of distraction, or mistake, or just callous enough to take advantage of Harry’s good natured heart. And Harry was always sure to remind him of this every time he left, face awash with guilt, clutching clothes wadded in his haste, leaving Draco bereft and emotionally raw in his absence.
“Yes, that sounds about right,” a soft chuckle escaped him, before he tapped the menu with a well-manicured finger, giving Harry a considering look and seemingly changing his mind at the last second, “Can I get two of these Galaxy Highballs?”
Draco arranged his features carefully, setting his glass back on the bar top, before adjusting his silver spectacles on his nose and smoothing down the front of his t-shirt.
“Well, Pansy has brought it to my attention that perhaps I’ve been a bit.. Evasive. So, I wanted to clear the air between us.”
“Well, then, what about a margarita? That’s a pretty standard drink, yeah? You can salt his rim for him, he likes it that way.” Draco choked, covering his face again as Pansy continued, “I like a sugared rim, myself. It’s much more pleasurable to drink.”
you are.”
Harry grimaced slightly and shook a few drops of bitters into the mixing glass, and popped the shaker on top with a bit too much force. The metal cocktail spoons and strainers jangled, and the liquor swayed in bottles on the bar top. He began to shake the cocktail quickly, pointedly ignoring what the gesture mimicked, and Malfoy’s attention to it.  Harry grabbed the tin of his pink cocktail pearls from the fridge with his other hand and kicked the door closed.
Draco breathes out slowly. Sitting back on his heels as he mutters a spell under his breath to conjure lube, he quickly coats his cock before pausing to rub the remainder against Harry’s hole, fingers teasingly dipping in before pulling away as Harry starts to rock against his hand. He cautiously eyes Harry’s bitten lips, his purposeful stare to the ceiling, his trembling jaw. Harry moves to roll over, like he always chooses to do when they’ve gotten to this point, but Draco grabs his hips instead to still him. He’s breaking their unspoken rules, he knows, but his selfish heart is beating too hard in his chest, swallowing up his inhibition, begging him to take just a bit more this time.
Draco had asked himself the very same question so many times that it became an all encompassing mantra, an intrusive wondering of what had changed so much for him that he’d make such a foolish decision, again and again and again. One thing he was sure of was that something certainly
Slowly, Harry relaxes, shoulders sinking, breaths changing their cadence to a new tempo. Resigned, surrendered to this dance they do.
in the way that he seemed invested in Harry’s craft, and the way that he seemed to put careful words to the flavours that Harry had curated for his menu. “Are you a professional of some sort, then?”

words, naming a thing that could not be named. Too close to the surface now that he can’t help stop them from tumbling out of his mouth.
The stranger was taller than Malfoy- a remarkable feat, really. With his lithe frame, dark hair, and sullen brows crowded against deep-set features, Harry almost would have thought he was Krum, if not for the fact that he’d just seen him at Hermione’s baby shower a few weeks ago. And Krum was decidedly
His hands carefully burrow beneath Harry’s thighs, squeezing slightly as he takes him deeper, letting the head of his cock press against the back of his throat, shivering at the hoarse moan that falls from Harry’s lips. Draco slowly presses his legs, curving his body to his will, palms kneading his arse, ankles over his shoulders. He lets Harry’s cock fall out of his mouth, pressing hot open-mouthed kisses against his shaft, moving lower with each kiss, single-minded in his focus to make Harry desperate, shattered beneath him. Draco wants to take him apart, craves the ability to turn him into a begging, pleading mess on his bed. He mouths along his perineum, lips and tongue greedy, moving steadily lower before his tongue reaches out to delicately trace Harry’s furled rim. Draco feels it contract beneath his mouth, loosening with each orbit of tongue as Harry takes in a sharp breath, finally breaking as his hands reach out to card themselves in Draco’s hair, tugging him closer in a silent plea.
Harry’s mouth ran dry, words failing to leave his lips before his mouth slammed shut. He squeezed the towels in his hands, swallowing thickly.
“Oh, he has

Harry sighs, rubbing a hand over his face before pinching the bridge of his nose.

He just felt
“Yeah, me, either,” Harry chuckled. “Not that I, erm, minded. I’ve been thinking about it for weeks.” Harry blushed, dropping his gaze and stepping back to pull up Draco’s trousers and then his own.
“I can’t say that I have. How does this work exactly?”
Harry shuddered, feeling his blood rush south, fingering Draco’s braces  as he ran his hands down Draco’s chest.  His palms tingled as they dipped beneath Draco’s shirt and finally met the heat of Draco’s bare skin.
Malfoy laughed softly and brought his hand up to cool his burning cheek with a glance back towards the doors.
Draco gently tucks this feeling away, commits the moment to memory, shiny and new, wrapped up in gentle hands and soft kisses in the dim morning light. Infused with the knowledge that they’ve abandoned all pretense, deviated away from that fine line. Accepting the way that their messy and broken and shattered pieces fit imperfectly, their love patchworked and threading the gaps. His heart squeezes, already making room, no longer desperate to clutch at every shred. He’s willing to learn the sweet expectation of a longing that is met, the joy of a warm embrace in the morning, the sweet kiss at the end of a long day.
It’s not what he expected. In fact, it’s in direct opposition of what he expects it to say. He anticipated that if and when this moment came, that he would be filleted by the fiendfyre of her rage, drawn and quartered by her words, gutted by the consequences of their actions. Eaten alive by the guilt of watching Harry choose her with a finality that would crush him wholeheartedly.
“They aren’t
“Months,
Draco’s lips trail up, languidly capturing the beads of sweat painting his stomach with his tongue, unhurriedly making his way towards Harry’s leaking cock as it twitches against his belly. He licks teasingly up the length, lapping softly at the head, groaning quietly as he finally takes it into his mouth. Draco’s hands gently caress Harry’s thighs as he gasps above him, fists pulsing in the blankets beside him. Draco knows that he’s resisting reaching out, not wanting to tangle his fingers through his hair, fighting that last bit of control that says this is
A small smile curved against Malfoy’s lips as he dipped his head, a curtain of hair falling from behind his ear, his round silver spectacles glinting. Harry hadn’t noticed those before.
Harry stared in shock, wondering when they’d gotten close enough to simply call each other by their

with him.
“The letters, Draco. You should read them.” Harry turns back to the hob, twirling the spatula mindlessly between his fingers, much like he does with his wand at the office. Most people probably don’t notice. But Draco does. Of course he does. He’s spent far too much time observing, watching, waiting. Waiting for the perfect time to strike, waiting for Harry to save him. Waiting for Harry to heal him. Waiting for Harry to fall to his knees and put his hands on him again.
forgive himself if he doesn’t try. Just once.
Pansy grasped one of the spheres and gently placed it in her mouth. Her lipstick left a ring of red around the silver spoon. Her eyes closed as a delighted smile broke across her face, chewing for a few seconds before turning to Draco, who had been watching avidly. She nodded excitedly, reaching for her second sphere as Draco reached out hesitantly to grab his own.
. To address him as Potter in the morning at work. Not Harry.
But after the dust settled, and the wixen world began clinging to the idea of peace, the job itself became rather tiresome. It became a lot less action and righteous catching of bad guys and a lot more political hierarchy and endless paperwork. Which wasn’t to say that Harry wasn't glad. He
Draco’s ears turned scarlet as he tugged at the collar of his shirt, gaping at Pansy with his mouth opening and closing repeatedly, a noise of dismay slipping out.
Draco slapped a palm on the bar top, excitement and the liquor increasing his volume as he laughed in delight.
Harry’s hands unclench from his hair, breaking against their invisible bonds, trailing their way up Draco’s arms, clutching behind his shoulders, pulling him closer, ever closer, Draco’s name a neverending litany against his tongue. Draco tucks his face into Harry’s shoulder, panting harshly between open mouthed kisses, groaning as his hips grind deeper, and slower, undulating on a current that he can recognize, that he can call something that’s remained unspoken.

Pansy rolled her eyes, watching Draco’s outburst, as if this was something she’d had to listen to before. She grabbed her clutch, stringing it across her body as she moved to get up.
His eyes widened as he put two and two together, glancing hesitantly between the liquor in his hand and the foam on the table.
in front of Draco. “New look?”
Malfoy’s eyes brightened in the dim lighting, running a tongue across his teeth before biting his lip to stifle a smile.
“It’s, well, it’s my take on your classic grapefruitini, I suppose. Most of the ingredients are pretty standard, like the grapefruit vodka, house simple syrup, fresh lemon juice and bitters. Uh, your typical list that you might find at any other pub.”
But something about Malfoy had always gotten under his skin, a jittery energy he’d always marked down as

By the time he’d gotten to the table, though, Malfoy was already thoroughly reprimanding the stranger, lips moving frightfully quick under the cover of a silencing charm, chest and neck flushed with a barely-contained vexation that sparked at the tips of his platinum locks.
Immutably. Infinitely. Irrefutably.

“Salazar, you boys are no fun.” She clucked her tongue, perusing the menu with a mere glance. “We’ll take two of those mojito spheres, then. That sounds tasty.”

, before glancing over at Malfoy, who seemed almost dazed in his incredulity.
“What?” Draco’s voice is hoarse, breaking slightly, leaving him as little more than a whisper. He clears his throat, before continuing, “What do you mean?”
Recklessly. Heedlessly. Helplessly.
Merlin help him, he’s going to savor the seconds before the dam breaks. Before he tells Harry, before the guilt crashes over them both, drowning them, turbulent and unforgiving.

Draco fights down his own desire, his rush, drowning in Harry, wanting to take his time with him, to relish in this as much as he can. He gently pushes Harry back, dropping down to his knees as he deftly unbuttons Harry’s trousers, tugging them down as Harry finally falls back on the bed. Draco’s hands move without thought, reverently brushing from ankle to thigh as he dips his head again to place soft, teasing kisses along Harry’s legs, eyeing the tented pants as Harry’s gasps sound out against the silent room.
He bends slowly to pick it up, grasping it delicately between his thumb and forefinger, before placing it in his trembling palm. Draco slides the parchment open, dreading the proverbial ax that is about to fall. Finally. Inevitably. He exhales, taking a moment to steep in the vision of Harry cooking in his kitchen. Happy, and warm, and here. Just for Draco. He lets it infuse his blood, fill his veins, permeate the memory with the scent of breakfast cooking, and dewy morning air from an open window, and the earl grey cooling in a pair of mugs on the countertop. Because if this is truly the end, and it
Draco’s thoughts drift in the silence of the room, his body slowly sinking deeper into the sheets. Harry warms his side, mumbling tiredly in that hazy post-coital daze, sighing and smacking his lips as his messy head droops against Draco. Those famous inky locks are stark against his pale skin, the moonlight filtering in slowly through the fluttering curtains as the moon rises high in the night. It’s quiet. Peaceful. A peek into a parallel that he cannot have, but craves so desperately that he’s willing to slice himself open at any chance to get a taste of it. The moment lingers, his heart swelling and throbbing mercilessly against his ribcage. Harry’s hand slides across his chest, easy as ever, fingers curling slightly as he falls asleep. Draco sighs, knowing that it’s a mistake, grappling between his own will and the illogical desires that unerringly drive him. He knows this will make it harder for him to build his walls back up, to stitch himself together, to pretend like this never happened,
He’s at a total loss for words, flustered, unsure, hesitant. He’s on unequal footing, perhaps always has been, only holding his half of the story. Draco’s in uncharted waters, gasping into the unknown, rethinking what his role is for this part, remapping the path they’ve tread to get to this point, circling and pointless. “What does this all mean?”
, of all people, and how he was coming off as a bumbling fool
But Harry always seems so detached, so cool and aloof that Draco assumed that
Malfoy smothered a laugh, a hand coming up to perch under his chin as he watched the process avidly.
He’s thought of it, in abstract form, twirling with the lights against his spelled ceiling, longing and yearning for this moment as the shadows cut the thick beams of moonlight, breaking the colored charm’s magic, reminding him of his utter selfishness, his depravity, his desperation. But even so, he’s entirely at Harry’s mercy, on the back foot, grasping at straws and still trying to fit the pieces together. The words are just there, playing on the tip of his tongue.
“Harry, can Draco have sex with you on a beach?”
“Er-” Harry cleared his throat, suddenly parched, “Here are some, uh, towels.”
Perhaps the better question was not so much what, but when and how and
“Do you have any extra shirts?”
to split. But Harry didn’t want to hold Terry back from his academic ambitions, and Terry didn’t want to take Harry away from the newly opened pub. It didn’t seem fair to either of them. So they’d spent their last night, cuddled up against each other in Harry’s sheets, Terry’s trunk ready by the front door. They’d talked about the future, and the good times, and how much they loved each other - enough to be happy to let the relationship go and end it on a good note. How they didn’t want to draw it out and taint everything they had built together or tarnish their memories of picnics in the park, gossiping about the latest happenings on their favorite shows, the nights spent wrapped up in each other’s arms with the faint summer breeze filtering in through the open windows of the bedroom. In the morning, Harry had kissed him in the doorway, a sweet and soft thing, a bare brushing of skin, and let him go.
. Uh. Hi.”
Harry stalked around the edge of the bar, throwing a towel over his shoulder, not caring about the dampness seeping into his faded black t-shirt as he approached the table to give the man a piece of his mind. Not only about his total lack of
He placed the spoons in a semi-circle across the crisp white plate, carefully arranging them around a fresh bundle of mint leaves, and swirled a curl of his house-made coconut lime reduction with a flourish to finish off the plate.
Her shiny black bob swished around her shoulders, a flinty smirk on her red lips as she demurely sat at the stool directly across from him.  She crossed her legs before turning to glare over her shoulder. Draco fidgeted awkwardly, adjusting his shirt and smoothing down the front before shuffling to Pansy’s side and taking a seat at the bar.
, when it was clearly so practiced and refined. A mask that set upon his features as easy as breathing.
Draco slowly runs his hands against Harry’s stomach, watching as it tenses beneath his gentle touch with each desperate gasp. Slowly,
“I never said it was a foolproof plan,” he whispered, fingers white-knuckled around the edge of the bar behind him. “I’m a difficult person.”

and didn’t see anything that needed fixing.
That’s not to say that he hadn’t dated. He certainly had. Ginny had been great for the 8 months it had lasted after the war, a little piece of himself being put back into place after the time he spent on the run. But they’d split amicably, realizing belatedly that they loved each other as
This is Draco’s favorite part, if he had to choose - though most of it ranks among some of his life’s greatest delights on their own. But it’s at this point that Harry has chosen him, has given in. It’s the point at which Harry has surrendered himself that is truly intoxicating, the heady rush of lust and acceptance coursing through Draco’s veins, the pure, unadulterated, unfiltered
Harry swallowed a moan, pressing closer to Draco, heated desire weaving itself deep into his blood. He bent closer, wanting desperately to close the gap between them, just as Draco tilted his head to do the same. Their lips met as they pressed closer together, Draco’s hands greedily sliding up Harry’s torso and tangling themselves into his hair, tugging it slightly with a gasp, angling their lips to meet again, and again, and again. Each kiss, deeper and more delectable.
It always started like this: bright lights flashing, spells arcing overhead, the thick smoke of magic and ozone coating the back of his tongue. There’s a close call. Shields gone awry, their team’s bodies misplaced in the field. Draco is hit with a strike to the shoulder, or chest, or knee. Always followed by racing hearts, a rush of blood to the head, the slight daze of a mission gone wrong numbing his mind before the sharp tug of apparition spins him away back to his flat.
partner.”
“We don’t really, uh, make those here.” Harry reached a hand up to tug on his hair, lost for words and utterly flustered at Pansy’s lewd drink orders.
The front glass was foggy and caked with dust, portions of the windows covered with plywood where vagrants had obviously broken in at some point. The hanging sign above the door hung at a frightful angle, poised to drop on any unsuspecting pedestrian. It was in rough shape, clearly having been left sitting for quite some time, but Harry could see it. The potential. The space for creating some good in this world with his own hands. The ability to cultivate a little slice of peace for himself.
Draco pulls away with one last chaste kiss. Harry sighs when Draco’s soft cock finally slips free, eyelashes fluttering against his flushed cheeks. On impulse, Draco brushes the sweaty fringe off Harry’s forehead, leaning down to leave soft kisses against his scar, his closed eyes, the tip of his nose, before rolling away. He lay on his back, staring at the ceiling, listening to Harry’s slow breathing. He tries to find the courage to say what he needs to. He knows the words, has been on the receiving end of this part too many times to count, has let the words eat him up from the inside out. But when he opens his mouth, he can’t seem to force them out over the lump that’s grown there, can’t seem to get his tongue to cooperate.
. What are you even talking about, Pansy?” Draco scoffed, patting down his trousers as he attempted to locate his wallet. “These are

about this, about its consequences or possible ramifications, for Harry to second-guess this part as he has in the past. Draco remains intent, tongue flicking against the heat of Harry’s mouth, vying for some semblance of control, his hands now free to start peeling away Harry’s robes. His mouth still occupied, it’s easier to keep Draco’s murmured praises and exhalations to himself, to bite down on Harry’s lips instead of his own as he finally,

“Draco has regaled me with tales of your fancy cocktails! Imagine my surprise that he hadn’t deigned to bring me along as his esteemed guest.” Pansy tapped her long nails against the bar top, a staccato rhythm that was equal parts intimidating and nerve wracking, smile widening the longer Draco avoided Harry’s gaze. “Darling, why don’t you order for me?”
Harry sighed and wiped down another table as he readied the bar for closing. There were still a few patrons hanging out at a single table in a darkened corner, regulars who wouldn’t mind him cleaning up while they chatted quietly until closing time. Harry tossed the damp rag over his shoulder, forgetting he wasn’t wearing his usual t-shirt until it began to soak through the cotton as he began putting the stools up on the bar top.
Harry waved a lazy hand, cancelling the
A matched set.

that’s been eating them both up, blazing through their bones, dangerous and weighty, though it is.
Harry watched open-mouthed, words lingering at the back of his tongue, as Draco made his way through the busy pub and out the front door without a backward glance.
Draco’s just happy to have the space to piece himself back together with no witnesses there to spot the fissures. It’s one luxury that he has that Harry doesn’t. Space. For better, or for worse. It leaves him with time to be engulfed in his desolation, to douse the feeling and push it out, back behind his walls,
“Well, you know that I love a good mojito. So I appreciate you keeping the classic ingredients here, and experimenting with its form, instead.” Draco took a breath, sending another embarrassed glance at Pansy, who was smirking with her hands folded beneath her chin mockingly, “It’s interesting, because you get a perfect combination of each flavor - the mint, the lime, the rum, that bite of the soda. It’s like you never have to experience that insufferable watered down version at the bottom of the glass. Instead it’s capturing that first sip every time.”
It was remarkable, really. The casual posture, the blasé way he adjusted in his seat and let his shoulders fall, face blank and unreadable. It was remarkable that Harry could see any cracks in his facade,
It was simple, but the aesthetic was effective. It elevated the plate to something otherworldly, something that seemed high class and one of a kind. Exactly the type of thing he liked to serve up, and that he was proud to have created.
Harry’s main goal, other than running a successful bar and supporting himself doing something he loved, was
as broken and fragile and awful as it sometimes makes him feel,
Harry held out his hand, the moment striking him as the perfect start to this next chapter. Rectifying a previously denied handshake, and opening them up for a new beginning, all in one. Draco grasped his palm, slowly pumping it once, unsure.
and nothing else.
“Oh? Is the ice what sets it apart from the other cocktails on your menu?”
“Well, you do seem to enjoy the drinks. You’ve been back every week for months.” Harry turned to drop some champagne flutes into the soapy sink behind him, gleefully looking back over his shoulder at the pair of Slytherins. Pansy hid a laugh behind her hand, amused at Draco’s antics.
Then Harry’s hands are peeling away Draco’s layers, a humming blue of warm magic flaring palm against his porcelain skin, bruises fading, cuts stitching, curses deactivated or destroyed. By this point, Draco knows what comes next. If he was honest with himself, he knew it prior, too. Waiting for the pendulum to swing, his gut churning with the sharp dichotomy of unspent guilt and fathomless want. But still, he waits. He waits, and waits, and waits. Until recently, when the waiting has become too much for him, an endless stretch of unknown spilt out, unbearable and unpredictable. He has instead chosen the option of throwing himself forward, heedlessly, recklessly, into whatever fight will find him back in Harry’s hands. It’s become a habit of late, each raid more enticing with the reward of Harry caving in against the fine line they walk, spinning them away and sprawling himself wide across Draco’s duvet at the end of the evening.
Harry is always the exception.
Hermione said it was the trauma. Ron called him an adrenaline junkie.
“How about I make us a drink, and this time, I’ll choose.”
Weeks passed, and Malfoy continued to show up at Harry’s bar at least once a week.
“Want another drink?”
Draco’s eyes find the stack of letters on the counter, recognizing the same plain parchment, but stills. They’re scattered, unfolded and bent, shivering against the breeze, mocking in their hazy waving. He takes a cautious step towards them. And then he sees it. Harry’s ring glinting brightly on the countertop, a halo of parchment surrounding it.
He shook his head at his own foolishness. Embarrassment crept up as he remembered that this was

. Harry would usually roll his eyes, putting it down as just another posh prat with too many opinions. Like so many of the others that seemed to be drawn to his pub.
Harry grabbed a rag and began wiping down the bartop for lack of anything better to do with his hands. Malfoy cleared his throat, reaching into his pocket for a few seconds, before placing the round silver spectacles upon his long nose. He quickly glanced up beneath his lashes, ears pink-tipped and flushing, before pulling a menu closer to him, fingers tapping a mindless rhythm against its surface.
