Things go quiet for a few more minutes. Malfoy pulls another cigarette out and lights it with his wand.
Harry lay on the bed as Draco sat on top of him, he was wearing Harry's black t-shirt. His long blond hair covers his eyes as he smiles at Harry his one of those shy sweet smile that makes Harry's heart skip a beat. Harry lifts his hand and pushes his hair behind his ears. Then Harry catches Draco's hand and pulls his knuckles to his lips and gives him a soft kiss. Draco bends down and places a kiss on his lips. Harry licks his bottom lip and Draco gets the command. He parts his lips and Harry deepens the kiss. Draco moans into the kiss. Harry places his hands on Draco's hips and tightens his hold to pull Draco even closer. Draco places his hands on Harry's biceps and rests his cheek on Harry's shoulder, nuzzling in Harry's neck. Within seconds, Harry can feel Draco's even breathing and he knows that Draco is asleep. He smiles. He raises one hand and runs it through his sleeping pet's soft hair.
As said before, their sex life was good. Harry even spanked him with the belt two times but as it hadn't been more than a couple of weeks since Draco came back from St Mungos, Harry wanted to take it slow. Harry had let him have one orgasm every night as well. This novelty would only last for another week though. Then Harry is putting him on dry spell for at least three weeks. Draco was always on edge while he wasn't allowed orgasm. It made him more wanton, more desperate to please Harry and Harry loved that Draco would trust Harry with such power. And he loved how Draco would try to cross his legs while sitting but then remembered he wasn't allowed to do so. One of the rules that he has to keep his legs parted all times when Harry was near. Unless they were sitting on the floor, then he needed Harry's permission. Till now, Harry hadn't made him ask for that permission verbally in front of everyone. Draco might be ripped off all the pride he has but Harry respected him so one pleading look was enough for Harry to give him a nod and the permission to cross his legs. But what troubled Harry most was that Christmas holidays were near. Harry still hadn't decided if he wants to stay at Hogwarts or stay at grimauld place that he has gotten it remodelled front to back by professionals. He wanted to ask Draco to come with him. Draco was living at Nott manor since he was out of azkaban. And more than that, he wanted Draco to come to the burrow and spend time with his adoptive family. Harry sighed, his eyes felt heavy. He'd worry about it tomorrow. Now, he kissed Draco's forehead and closed his eyes, drifted to his slumber.
Harry finally touches his cock. Just a gentle finger stroking through the shaft. Harry thinks that Draco has had enough teasing and tormenting for the time being or three weeks. He holds Draco's cock and gives it a firm stroke. He fists Draco's cock up and down and increases the speed. Draco archs his back and struggles to follows order. When Harry sees that Draco is completely on edge, he tells Draco to cum and Draco immediately does. Draco cums all over Harry's hand and his stomach. Harry cleans everything with a scurgify and then walks towards the bedside table. He pours water and makes Draco sit up so that he can drink it. Then he makes Draco drink some water and places the glass back on the table. He casts a cleaning charm on the bed and on them and then lays besides Draco after removing his shirt to give Draco skin to skin contact. He pulls over the duvet so that Draco is covered as he comes down from his post orgasm high. He kisses Draco's hair and and mutters sweet praises, telling Draco how much he loves him and how proud he is of Draco. And how good Draco was. He holds Draco until Draco finally falls asleep.
Potter squeezes his hips a little bit more and Draco prepares himself to face the disappointment and hurt he'll feel when Potter will lose. Instead but, what happens is Potter gives another frustrated groan and drops his hand from Draco's hips.
The flush in Draco's cheeks renew. He obediently get's down on all fours and stares at Potter's chest.
"Are you suggesting we talk about our feelings?" Albus laughs. "Oh, you Gryffindors." Albus laughs as he leaves.
"No. You healed the first day. Madam Pomfrey kept feeding you sleeping draught so you'll be alseep and safe." I nodded. "Belle. Why didn't you defend yourself. You are really good in dada."
I leave them alone and go back to my dorm. As soon as I enter Diana starts asking me questions of what happened and why did I run and where did I go. I tell her its none of her buisness as politely as possible. Last thing I need right now is someone mad at me. That can be used against me. I take the diary out and write.
Cormac smiles. It means that he got the promotion. It means that his salary will go tripple digits. It means that he is one step closer towards his goals.
Hera smiles at Ralph as he eats the custard. She always loved cooking for him. He always looked so happy whenever he ate anything she cooked. And Hera once again goes back in time. Once again she's the 17 year old girl who fell in love with this handsome 17 year old boy. A Slytherin pureblood girl who fell in love with the forbidden gryffindor muggleborn.
Teddy grabs Draco's curly hair and pulls. Draco makes a sound of protest and Teddy laughs as he turns his hair to green colour. Draco chuckles. The laugh sounding foreign to himself. He doesn't remember how it feels to laugh. He hasn't since three years. Three terrible years the war took away from him. Just like they took away Teddy's parents. Draco knows he's to blame but he'll be damned if he lets remorse take over. He's done plenty things he shouldn't have, but he'll do them all over again in a heartbeat for his mother. Who else would if not him? Just like his mother tried to keep him safe, he tried for his mother. He knows many people in his position would do the same but right now they have someone to blame. To show that they are high and mighty. Right now Draco can list at least ten people in the Wizengamot who would've turned their backs to the wrong side of the war because it would benefit them. In fact they have done it. Draco's just one of those who came out the hardest to be blamed. He's a Malfoy after all. And Malfoys haven't done something that makes people embrace them with warmth. But for this child in Draco's arms, he's ready to do better. His life in some way have always been for others. It's been for his father's so that he can be the perfect pureblood heir. For his mother to keep her safe and secured as much as he can. A bundle of terrible burdens that no child should have.
"Nothing. I don't know anything but what I've read in the papers." Draco lies through his teeth on veritaserum.
"Its Greengrass, Potter. And her name is Astoria. Also, are you really just finding this out?" Malfoy asks.
"I'm packing my bag and I'm going in Room of Requirement. We need to find out a way to escape Hogwarts. I need to talk to my mom." Ginny begins to cry.
"He has to be your flesh and blood. That pathetic excuse of a son. Just like you. A slave." Lucius yells.
"From not feeling anything for months to feeling so much of everything at once. It's not, I'm not over it. I still feel as if my head is under water most of the time. It's just, I think, being here helps. So does
Its endearing how even now he blushes while asking for permission to cross his legs and sit. Sometimes Harry says no just for amusement sake but today, today he says yes.
"Wow. A night with Slytherins, in their home. This is going to be scary." Neville said. Hannah shook her head.
"Draco, I'm technically an older version of that guy. Look at me. We have similar built, similar height, black messy hair, and the entire tine we danced the last time, he looked at me like he would kill me without a second thought for touching you. It's him you wanted all along, isn't it? He's your classmate, you know him since years." Christian said.
Potter accio's the leash and with a smile, attaches it on the collar. He climbs off the bed, Draco does the same but then Potter clicks his tongue when Draco gets ready to stand. Draco stares at him blankly.
Harry smirked and slowly picked up his pace. Soon he was thrusting in Draco fast and deep. Draco let out cries and moans of the pleasure and pain he felt. After good ten minutes of fucking, Harry took out his cock from Draco and came on his ass.
"I'll be fine." Belle said, taking a deep breath. "Can we do something?" She asked as she started unbuttoning his shirt.
"I don't know. All I remember is that I was walking towards Sugar Sweet and then piercing pain and everything going dark." Draco replies.
Potter smiles again. It's been so long. More than a year. It still does so many things on Draco's heart when Potter smiles at him that way. Draco walks into the bathroom before Potter starts taking off his clothes because he knows he won't be able to stop himself get down on his knees if he watches Potter undress. Even with all the grime and blood, Potter is always unbelievably sexy with his messy black curls and the bronze skin and green eyes. Draco sets the water to warm and takes out the sponge and bodywash to place it on the glass shelf on the wall besides the shower but then he hears Potter enter. He turns and Potter shakes his head. Potter motions towards the floor and Draco's knees wobble. He knows what this gesture means. They had talked about it in great length a couple of days ago when Draco had read in a bdsm short stories book. He wanted to try this. Wanted to be used as furniture or just something Potter can use and forget about it the same time. Draco swallows. With bodywash in one hand, shampoo and loofa sponge in other and a cock that gives an interesting twitch, he turns and faces the shower and kneels down, holding all the stuff.
"Within ten minutes, I can throw you back in where you belong." Darien barely manages his temper. "Fuck restaurant, you won't be able to sell Street food."
The glass escapes Scorpius's hands and shatters on the floor as he sees Rose kiss the Ravenclaw boy in the corridors. He felt rage. He storms towards Rose and pulls her away from that boy.
"Its a boy." The doctor said and gave the baby to the nurse. Luna had to start pushing again. She was giving birth to twins. After more two minutes of pushing, the cry could be heared again. "This one's a girl."
"I wish I wasn't wearing leather pants." Draco said with a weak voice. When Harry looked at his pants, he could see a bulge in Draco's pants. He had a hard on. Harry had a hard on as well but it was well hidden because of his long hoodie.
"Mr Olivander." Draco heard Blackburn speak. "Is it true that you were a prisoner in the Malfoy Manor?"
"And you pray to Circe, Merlin, Morgana and all the founding parents of Hogwarts that I remain a slave because I swear to all of them Lucius, if I ever find a way to escape this prison, I'll make you suffer for everything you've put my son through." She warns her captor.
Draco's in a haze. There's a fog clamping his brain. He blinks several times before he can register the question his Master just asked.
"Sod off you lot." I said but couldn't suppress my smile. "I wasn't obsessed with him. And I definitely never saw him that way until I saw him in those leather pants." I regretted immediately after saying this. They all laughed.
"Don't talk with your mouth full, Ronald." Hermione scolded Ron. "And he's right, Harry." She turned to him.
"That child can't cast a dark curse to save his own life. They forced him to do it. He couldn't. Couldn't say the words. Which was given because his wand has unicorn core. I sold him his first wand. Unicorns are the most purest of the creatures. They are the most lightest of them. And not many people get the wands with unicorn cores. In a my life, I've sold about 40 wands with unicorn core. One of them to Draco Malfoy. That boy is more light than anyone of us here is."
"There is a chance it'll all go bad. But there is also a chance that it'll all be good. Let's take the chance, Scorpius."
Harry is sitting on the bed, crossed legged, reading a book on magical residue he found in the Black library. He watches as Draco climbs on the bed, crawls towards him, closes the book and places on the table besides then climb on Harry's lap. Harry smiles at him and grips his hips.
"Diana!" I scream. She stayed. She stayed to fight. A death-eater just cast her the killing curse. There she was holding her wand and now she's laying on the ground lifeless. Shit! Through teary eyes I stun that death-eater and he falls of the tower.
This momentarily stuns Harry. Malfoy saying please. Never does Malfoy says please. Harry opens his mouth to say something when Zabini touches his shoulder and walks him away from the lake.
Harry still didn't shut his mouth. Gaping and with a sudden hard on, he looked at others. Everyone had similar expressions. Okay, maybe nobody's mouth was open as huge as Harry's but you can't really blame him on this, right? Not after what he just saw and how his cock reacted. Ginny gave him a knowing smirk which finally made him shut his mouth.
"Alright! Alright! As you say. Hey, it's alright." Cormac tries to calm her down. "Sir, she, uh..." Cormac trails off.
Narrowed eyes. Potter is looking at him with narrowed eyes. There are only five times when Potter has looked at Draco with eyes like this. And all those times, Draco had misbehaved. The first time was when Draco had thrashed the dorm room and burnt Potter's bed in Hogwarts. Draco swallows. He gives a faint meow.
Draco knows the answer; not anymore. He doesn't have the strength to say it out loud. And Harry understood.
Guys. I just recieved a very shitty news. A Hufflepuff thirteen year old raped by the death-eaters then tortured and killed by Bellatrix. Fucking Goyle was laughing about it. She's killed! I don't know what to do. I'm so scared.
"Oh god. Some good some bad. I fucking hate defence against the dark arts. All our school life we had just one teacher who actually I can call teacher."
Draco's eyes narrow and he looks at Harry. Harry manages to supress his snort and raises his eyebrows at Draco with a challenging expression, hoping Draco understands and drops the topic. Which, Draco does. He sighs and looks down which pleases Harry immensely. But what Draco does next makes Harry want to spank Draco. He looks up at Hermione.
"Is this not you, Mr Malfoy? Wasn't this taken the day you saved Mr Potter in the Manor before the war? Isn't this you getting punished by the Death-eaters because you helped Harry Potter escape? Isn't this how they used your body while you were drugged and immobilised? Isn't this you getting raped by so many of those death-eaters while your mother begged them to forgive you and your father and the dark lord stood there watching, not caring at all about you? Aren't at least couple of them are the Death-eaters who had raped you repeatedly while you were a child?" The prosecutor half yells.
Harry was confused. He wanted to talk about what now? His confusion must have showed on his face because the head auror cleared that up.
After two years of having James and Romie, Draco and Harry adopted two more kids. Albus Rubeus and Scorpius Hyperion. Then again they had found Lily when she was a year old and adopted her. Astoria Greengrass was Lily's mother, she was weak and had a blood curse that came back. The blood curse hadn't attacked anyone for quite a few generations, but they found her way to Astoria. Astoria came to Draco and Harry. She was disowned after She joined Draco to work against the blood-purists and accidentally got pregnant. She wanted her child to be brought up by good people and not blood purists. Today was the day Scorpius and Albus were going to start their first year in Hogwarts.
Potter drops Draco's hand and accio's a jar of mint green salve. He pulls back Draco's bedsheet that covers his chest and Draco lets him, holding his breath. He dips his fingers in the salve and applies it on the round scar on Draco's chest, carefully avoiding the other scars. The skin absorbed the salve and within seconds, the scar was gone, leaving plain pale flesh as if Draco was never hit by those four people. He looked at Potter, sho was looking at him intensely with those bright green eyes.
It was as if he was floating—flying with the clouds.  Days later the feeling remained, and he wasn’t sure if he’d land on the ground anytime soon.  He absentmindedly fell into his daily routines, but his mind was back in that alleyway with Potter’s lips against his.  He wanted that again, and he kept wondering when will be the next time they’d see each other.
As they left, Draco snorted.  “Love birds?  Really?  Just who exactly do you think she’s referring to?”  He turned his gaze from them to their group—which now only consisted of him and Potter.  “What!  Where’d they go?”
The Floo room of a wizard’s residence is probably the last place you want to do anything even remotely obtrusive.  Without blocking the connection, anyone could walk in on something they weren’t meant to see.  Auror Harry Potter would know, honestly.  He can recall countless moments he’d walked in on a crime scene on a would-be victim now turned suspect.  He’s closed several cases, just from going through the bloody fireplace at just the right moment.  The whole department is in awe over it—well, everyone that is to say except his own partner, Draco Malfoy.  Malfoy just coins it as Potter’s typical dumb luck.  Harry, on the other hand, refers to it as his impeccable timing.
“Sit down, Dean!  You can console him later.  Last time I let you get around the table you two made out for 5 minutes straight.  We have to focus, guys...”
“You asked Ginny Weasley how big Potter’s cock was?”  He couldn’t believe this woman.  “Why does it even matter to you?  It’s not like he’s seeing you!”
“You too dear,” she responded, kissing his own cheek.  Then she took off towards her flat, just a few blocks away.
Draco wasn’t going to have that.  He made his decision before his thoughts even collected completely.  He stood from the couch, gathering his clothes in his arms.  “Let’s go to my room,” he suggested.  “You can lay on my bed, while I blow your mind by blowing your cock.”
“No, well,” Draco took another sip of wine, to get him to focus on something else besides Harry’s lips.  “You could always wear heels,” he teased.
It smelled of delicious pine, like the woods and the earth.  It made Draco think of one of those colognes Potter used to wear in 6th year.  Draco would always get a whiff of the scent in Potions class, the heat from the cauldrons causing the smell to permeate in Draco’s nose.  It smelled nice--just like this wreath.  “Mmmm, nice...” he smiled, practically nuzzling the wreath.
“Yes,” Draco answered automatically.  Then his blush rose as he’d realized what he’d just agreed to.  Of course, Draco wanted it.  He’d dreamed and fantasized about shagging Harry for years, it was not a new concept by any means.  But for it to actually happen—that Harry would even want to, it was almost unbelievable.
“Just a late-night study session,” shrugged Dean, taking a swig of his own coffee.  The prick was using his plain mug.
blazed sharply along the corner of the store, drawing everyone’s attention.  But not for long, because as if on cue the remaining buildings along the rest of the street lit up with all colors of the rainbow.
Mother of Merlin, Harry couldn’t think.  He shuffled carefully over to him, his mind blank.  Never in his wildest fantasies had he ever imagined anything like this.  Fuck, Malfoy was a vision.  Harry couldn’t possibly stop ogling him.  This would be wank material for years, and he didn’t even
He waved them away, still at a loss for words.  Pansy sauntered over a moment later, while he was still trying to recover from what had just happened.  “Feisty, isn’t she?”  She asked, sipping from a martini glass.  Draco could see the appeal of turning to the harder liquor right now, the champagne wasn’t doing anything to settle his nerves.
Releasing his hands from Draco’s hips, he reached around to grab Draco’s arse and opened him up even wider.  Groaning from the scent of sex and sweat and Draco, Harry’s tongue formed a tip and tentatively he pushed inside.  Immediately, Draco’s hands buried into Harry’s hair and he tugged hard, urging him forward.  Harry plunged further in, noting just how hot and tight Draco was.  His right hand slipped, fumbling around blindly for the bottle of lube.  It was practically a miracle that he was able to open it and coat his fingers, all the while his tongue stayed buried inside of Draco.
Having only started the program three months ago, Draco was well aware of his position in this program.  It was not unheard of for lower ranks to feel taunted or teased by upper level trainees, but in Draco’s case it was certainly worse.  He knew he was the only Marked man in this whole building, the only one who had a criminal history.  Just what exactly was he even doing here?
“I never thought I’d witness the day you’d say I was better than Weasley at something,” Draco smirked.
“Did you like it?”  He continued with that same troublesome smile, having no idea the effect he had on Draco.
Pausing along the sidewalk, Draco turned to his friend and really looked at her.  Pansy was biting on her lips, anxiously looking back at him.  Her browns eyes, always so large and expressive were earnest and waiting.  Even after all these years, after Draco’s fall from grace and his loss of fame and fortune, she still regarded Draco and his opinion over anyone else.  No one else cared what Draco thought these days—no one else paid him much mind at all.  Draco’s breath caught in his chest, suddenly overwhelmed at the idea.  He had no one else, no other friends or family.  Just Pansy.
someone from Hogwarts?”  Pansy grinned, nodding anxiously.  “Hmmm...”  Draco couldn’t think who else it could be honestly.  Blaise had dated practically their whole year of students, both men and women—whereas Pansy was quite picky with who she went out with.  For Pansy to be smiling like she was now, it had to be someone truly outrageous.
Before he knew it, he was outside and pleased to see fresh snow across the grounds.  It had been snowing on and off for weeks now, but this was the first snow to have actually accumulated to a few inches.  Secretly, Draco always loved the magical way snow transformed the world around him.  It was breathtakingly beautiful, and made him remember snow angels with his mum and throwing snowballs at Blaise and Pansy.
Pansy scoffed.  “So, I’m not allowed to be just generally curious about it?  You’re my best friend, Draco.  I want to make sure you’re happy.”
Harry shook his head, chuckling.  “You are insane,” he stated.  Then Harry had waved his wand and his favorite mug came sailing to the table.  He took a seat across from Draco and proceeded to pour the tea.  Afterwards, he plucked a peppermint stick out of a jar at the center of the table.  After Seamus and Dean’s baking session, they’d left the peppermint in the middle of the table along with some matching ornaments as some sort of makeshift table centerpiece.  It was oddly charming and no one seemed to complain.
It seemed to be the right thing to say because Potter laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  He licked the grease from his fingers and wiped them on a paper napkin.  “Right, don’t get me started on what you are
Pansy lifted her hand, silencing him.  “Don’t.  Even though that place has great food and is certainly posh enough, don’t do it.  Do you guys want to be mobbed by the Prophet on your way to dinner?  You’ll have to take him somewhere Muggle, darling.”
All Draco could say was, “Wow.”  He’d never believe he’d see the day where Blaise Zabini, known heartbreaker of Hogwarts, would settle down on just one person.  And especially Ginny Weasley of all people.
“Yes, Harry’s sweet!”  He agreed with his weak tongue, then silently cursed himself when the words registered to his brain.  “Now if you’ll excuse me, bed.  I need to get to bed.  Not Harry’s bed—my bed.”
“You...um,” Harry continued the nervous gesture of rubbing the back of his neck.  “You look really nice this morning,” he finished, coloring an even darker shade.
With the hand not gripping Malfoy’s cock, Harry waved around wandlessly on Malfoy’s bonds.  The silk slipped free and he wasted no time yanking him to a new position.  He pulled him up to meet his back with Harry’s chest, pressed completely close together.  Harry kept up the pace, never faltering.  But this new position had an added bonus and Harry quickly latched to Malfoy’s neck, marking him up roughly.  His fingers slipped along Malfoy’s erection, his balls drawing so tight.  “Going to come...in that tight little arse of yours...”  Harry moaned near Malfoy’s ear.
He took a shuddering breath, her words affecting him more than he’d like to admit.  Sipping at his wine, he finally was able to say, “Yeah right.  It’s just something Potter will be better at than me...”
“Certainly, I’ll be right back,” he grinned at both of them and quickly brought over another helping of the dessert.  She winked up at the man, which he returned before he checked on his other tables.
Pansy watched their exchange intently, then smirked.  Moving her eyes from them, she focused on Neville instead.  She pulled away from Draco and she clicked her heels on the marble floor over to him.  He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and she leaned into his embrace.  “Dear, let’s go leave the two love birds, shall we?  There’s a party in the dining hall, and I fancy dancing right now.”
While Draco was distracted with their kissing, Harry brought his hand to Draco’s cock and began to stroke him slowly.  Draco gasped against his mouth.  Harry grinned, picking up the pace and relishing in the feeling of Draco filling in his grip.  “You feel so good,” Harry muttered along his lips, shaking to keep from pushing that much deeper in Draco.
Now here he was, accepted into the training program to the complete astonishment of his peers.  Of course, it was dumb luck that he’d entered into the program at exactly the same time as Potter and his gang of Gryffidors.  Their floor of the dormitory was flooded with them and each of them looked at him in disgust—it was Hogwarts all over again.  The only salvation in all of this was there was an odd number of them, and so he was picked to be the only trainee with his own room.  The rest of the room assignments were pretty typical, Potter with Weasley, the Patil sisters, Thomas and Finnigan.
Finally, he reached Draco’s bottom lip, and the combination of the paste on his skin and Potter’s fingers caused Draco to let out a gasp.  Potter instantly removed the fingers on his lips, his eyes widening in alarm.  “Have I hurt you?” he asked, his eyes finally moving up to meet Draco’s.
Before he could ask, she answered, “I haven’t eaten dinner yet.  Have a meal with me.  I promise it won’t mean anything except dinner.  I’m starving.”
“Would you like that?” Harry suggested, his gaze turning heated.  Then of course, Draco’s mind supplied the images for him and he realized rather quickly that
“We can’t skip,” Draco said with a hint of sadness.  He started to slowly pull himself up and brushed his clothes off.  “Maybe I can see you later and we can talk more.  Didn’t get to talk much while we were here,” he added cheekily.
“I’ve always noticed you,” Draco whispered, saying it so soft that Harry could have easily missed it.  He gulped, clearing his throat and tried to divert his gaze from Harry licking the sugar off his lips.  “Harry...what are we even doing?”
They had both finished their meals, the bottle just about empty as well.  Harry stared at Draco across the table, warm and intense.  Draco could feel his gaze raking over him, particularly lingering on his lips and neck.  He couldn’t fight the flush that rose up his face even if he tried.  Draco gulped the last bit of wine in his glass and it slipped clumsily out of his hands as he set it back down.  “Want to get out of here?” he croaked, his stomach in knots.
Draco watched the clock closely above the fireplace.  Harry had told him to wait by the Floo and he’d come to get him around 6.  As each minute drew near, Draco grew more nervous.  He still had another ten minutes so he needed to focus on something else.  He reached for the Prophet Dean had left on the coffee table.  Staring blankly at the photo of the front of Gringotts, the words barely made any sense.  Apparently, there was another attempt at a break in—but they proved to be unsuccessful.  Nothing new there.  Harry was the only one that could steal something from there and live to tell the tale.
Dean stood up from the table, blocking Draco from Ron’s line of sight.  Dean was easily the tallest guy in their dorm, and he looked down his nose at Ron.  “He’s our friend.  Got a problem with that?”  His voice carried weight and Draco was silently impressed.  “He’s here because he fucking lives here.  He can be in his room, he can be in our room, he can be out here.  If you’ve got an issue with that you can just bugger the fuck off right now.”
“I um...”  He glanced around to make sure none of the others were near or could overhear them.  Weasley and Potter hadn’t even returned to the dorm for the evening, but Draco was still somewhat cautious.  “I was thinking of asking Potter out tomorrow morning.  While Weasley is in class...”
Draco had noticed it now.  It was hard not to, with the way Potter was looking at him.  Merlin, it was too much.  He pushed him gently, stepping out of his arms and putting some space between them.  This was all so confusing, and Draco couldn’t take much more of this.  “Just...what do you want with me?”  He asked in a rush, knowing if he didn’t ask this question right now, he might never get the courage to ask it again.
Smiling, Harry brought his own hand to stroke through Draco’s hair.  There wasn’t any tinsel in his strands of platinum though.  Draco was already rather flushed and lightheaded from the drinks at the party, but Harry’s touch caused his cheeks to warm even more.  “Don’t know if you’ve noticed,” he whispered, leaning closer.  His lips brushed over Draco’s, “but I’m just as crazy for you.”
“I shouldn’t,” Draco said automatically, though his body thought the idea was rather fantastic.  He recalled the one and only time they sparred here and it was during their first week in the program.  They were instructed on wrestling techniques in case they were ever assaulted without their wand.  Of course, their professor paired them off for a demonstration.  Draco secretly thought it was to witness the sick satisfaction of an Ex-Death Eater get the shit beat out of him by Boy Wonder.
If Draco were 8 years younger, he’d have jumped at the opportunity.  But now at 20, things were very different.  Draco was afraid if given the chance to get that close, he certainly wouldn’t be hitting Potter—but something else entirely.  He flushed, stepping back to give him some space from Harry.  “No,” he shook his head.
It was as if the fingers digging into Harry’s hair at the base of his neck caused him to go full force.  Harry ran his own hands through Draco’s hair, cupping his cheek softly, caressing his neck, all the while his lips never left Draco’s.  Then his touch grew bolder, as Draco started to get louder and before he knew it, Harry’s hands were working the buttons of his vest.  His hands were clumsy and hurried and Harry huffed in their kiss, breaking away to look down at Draco’s chest.  “Too many buttons...god, Draco...”
,” he whispered, waving his wand over the card.  He was careful to focus his magic solely on the handwriting and not on the cover.  He didn’t want to vanish the snow charm on accident.  Either way, his spell had no effect.  So, it seemed this actually was a card from Harry Potter.  Potter, who not only thought they were friends and Draco deserving of such a gift—but also hinting at possibly going to this place together.  Merlin,
Harry noticed what he’d been staring at and he chuckled.  “Sorry.  We are really trying to keep Crookshanks from tearing up all the furniture.”
“Ugh,” Padma groaned, covering her face in her hands.  “I had no idea about Harry.  He hadn’t been with any men before—at least that I know of.  And Draco?  Wasn’t he with Pansy?  We could have sworn we heard her coming in here not too long ago and disappearing in his room with him.”
“How crude,” Draco wrinkled his nose, standing up from their table and wrapping his coat around himself.
Draco couldn’t help letting the words slip out.  “And does he know I’m the one you are spending time with?”
The Auror training dormitories loomed in the distance.  The only lights illuminated in the night sky were from a few bedroom windows.  Christmas, it seemed, was still a long way away.
For graduating Hogwarts, Blaise Zabini was gifted with a Victorian townhouse in Chelsea.  It was similar in the way to how Pansy’s flat was, nestled between other neighboring Muggle properties.  However, the home itself was magical in nature, charmed space expanding from the moment you stepped through the front door.  The best feature of the townhouse was the entrance way.  Once you walked in, the floor plan was very open and there were staircases on either side trimmed in a rich mahogany.  For this particular Christmas party, Blaise had decorated the banisters with hundreds of Christmas ornaments and a spiraling garland.  Two Christmas trees could be seen, one in the main hall, and one directly atop of it on the second-floor entrance way.  It was at this entrance way that the Slytherins got their first look at their dates for the evening.
“Hmm?”  Harry hummed, his lips wasting no moment in finding a spot on the side of his neck.  He was licking and nipping along the skin there and Draco shuddered under him.
“Never,” Harry groaned.  Draco watched, mesmerized as Harry’s chest rose and fall.  He knew he couldn’t release his hold—it would be just like Harry to take advantage of a moment of weakness.  Draco decided to dig his knee further into Harry’s leg, and Harry hissed under him.  He smirked, applying even more pressure with the pads of his fingers to his thigh.
“I’m sure if you were to ask Parvati,” he continued on, lifting their joined hands, “she’d have told you I was the worst dancer to ever partner with her.”  Draco would have laughed at that, if he weren’t so lost in what was happening.  “But I can assure you,” he leaned closer, resting his cheek against Draco’s as he whispered into his ear, “I have learned a lot since the Yule Ball.”
Inside the letter was a round multicolored circle.  Draco recognized it as one of those weird discs Thomas was always playing with, to make the music blare in the common room.  He smiled, twirling the disc on his finger.  He had apologized to Luna shortly after his trial, and though the two have sent occasional messages back and forth, this gift was totally unexpected.  But then again, Luna did things in her own way and Draco appreciated the gesture for what it was.
Before he could consider walking over to them, the Floo flared.  Oh yes, Pansy.  The whole reason Draco had been sitting in front of the fireplace in the first place.  He needed her help desperately for his upcoming date with Harry.  She had cleared her schedule for the following evening and now here she was, getting caught in the garland draped over the fire.  She batted it away, the greenery pulling her hair into a tangle.  Huffing, she managed to disentangle herself.  “Merlin, Draco.  What the hell is all this?” she asked in irritation before she joined him on the couch.
Harry smiled against a now purpling mark forming underneath Malfoy’s jawline.  He figured now would be the time, and he gently pulled the blindfold off.  Malfoy blinked dazedly at him, almost as if he was just now waking up from a dream. Harry figured he was coming down from the high of the mind blowing sex and it’d be a minute before he came to.
“We told you he would,” Seamus sung cheekily.  Draco looked over to see him pull out a sheet of cookies.  Sugar, butter, vanilla, ginger smells wafted over to him.  He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply.  Maybe one cookie wouldn’t hurt, surely?
At this point in the teasing, Harry couldn’t wait any longer.  He dipped his tongue in Malfoy’s crevice and lapped down to the stretched ring.  Malfoy hissed above him, chanting “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” uncontrollably.  Harry darted his tongue this way and that, moving all along the ringed muscle holding the plug in place, all the while he brought up a hand to grip the toy and started to push it in and out, fascinated by the movement of watching it disappear further inside.  At this point Malfoy huffed, his voice going shrill.  “Fuck me, please!  You horrible fucking tease!”
“I don’t know anymore!” He wailed, fingers digging into his beautiful black locks.  Seamus watched him from across the table forlornly.  “Let me make us some coffee or tea or something.  I’m going to pass out soon otherwise...”
His run was therapeutic and allowed him the needed time to think about all that was happening within his dorm.  He’d somehow stumbled into an unlikely friendship with Dean and Seamus—and now the twins were even being agreeable.  He had no idea how the dynamic of the dorm could change so much in such a short time.  It was unexpected, and Draco pondered if it was something in the water.  Why else would everyone suddenly be so
How could he have forgotten about her and Longbottom?  He guessed that he'd been too focused on his own problems with Potter, he’d neglected to ask about what was going on with her.  He felt like a right twat.  But before he could dwell too much on that, she reached for his hand and started to pull him towards his room.  “Oh, don’t put on that face, dear.  I’ll tell you all about it in good time.  It’s still very new and we’re not entirely sure what we are looking for right now.”
“That sounds like a fantastic idea,” Blaise agreed, pulling her closer to him as they turned to the nearest corner table.
“Er,” Harry finally looked at the rest of his dormmates.  “I guess the secret is out,” he finished lamely.  Dean laughed while Seamus clapped excitedly next to him.  The girls stared intently, their hands covering their lips in shock.
Reluctantly, he pulled off.  His gaze still looking at the skin further down.  Licking his lips, Harry couldn’t get enough.  He loved how Draco smelled, how he tasted.  He very much wanted to see how he tasted
Not missing a beat, Seamus shouted back, “We’re not into threesomes, but I’m sure Harry would love to FUCK YOU!”
To Draco’s horror, Dean and Seamus started to look around the kitchen and surrounding living room for a comparison.  “Guys, stop,” he pleaded as Dean held up various kitchen utensils, considering.  This was so embarrassing.
Fuck this, he thought and stepped inside the fireplace.  “Draco Malfoy’s flat!”  He shouted, the flames licking up his boots and pissing him off even more.  God how he hated the Floo, he thought as he felt the familiar pull in his navel.
He held up his hand, “Please, that won’t be necessary.”  He absolutely didn’t want her intervention.  Less attention drawn to him, the better.  The only way he could get out of this program in one piece would be for him to stay in line, keep his head down.  He didn’t need her stirring up trouble.
“Oh!  Pansy,” Neville grinned, walking over and taking her hand and kissing it softly.  “I was just giving Ginny a demonstration of Luna’s mating ritual dance.  She’s researching on how to repopulate and protect the existing Blibbering Humdinger population.”
“Yeah, so,” Harry paused, his blush travelling up his neck.  “I’m going to get out of these stupid robes and put on something else.  Where we going again?”
They both took their shot, tilting their heads back at the same time and then slamming the glass back onto the bar.  Pansy let the alcohol wash over them before she said, “Yes, same one actually.  He’s working on his Herbology mastery.  Apparently, he’s really good with his hands...”
The only one not speaking was Draco.  He was just staring at Harry in that same transfixed expression.  Harry blushed brilliantly, and waved at them all to quiet down.  Then, with it silent once more, he approached Draco with that same charming smile.  “Hey,” he said.
She rolled her eyes dramatically.  “No, we have to go shopping for the rest.  I know being a wizard, there’s no need to own a single pair of jeans.  But I think now is the time, come along now.”  She pulled him up by the hand, determination in her eyes.
Harry smiled at him with that same smile that had been driving Draco mad for weeks, and then they made their way inside.  A hostess greeted them promptly and seated them at a table near the back of the restaurant.  Draco was secretly pleased to see the establishment had decorated for the holidays.  Hanging on the wall next to their table were two golden bells, with holy and a red satin bow crowning the piece.  Normally Draco would have found the decoration slightly garish, but with the subdued candle lighting it caused the glitter to sparkle.  It was oddly charming.
Immediately they stifled a moan, and Draco was so lost.  Harry somehow recovered from the distraction first, because he was able to successfully grab Draco’s wrists and pin them over his head.  Draco wasn’t even going to fight it anymore, he was exactly where he wanted to be.  “You give?”  This time, Harry had asked, letting out a ragged breath.
.  Merlin, he was so fucked.  He wondered if he’d have enough time to style his hair or perhaps even fix his jeans so there weren’t bloody holes in them.  Why Muggles bought jeans that looked dirty and falling apart was beyond Draco.
for Merlin’s sake, and he had held off this long when they started on cupcakes, lemon bars, and cheesecake.  But now there were cookies involved and his resolve was slowly fading.
Sighing, he ran his fingers through a few stray strands of hair that fell to the front of his face.  “It’s fine, honestly,” he tried to shrug it off.  “My schedule is different from each of you.  I have eaten out here just as much as my room,” he lied, looking to the right of her.  He could see her frown out of the corner of his eye.
She smirked, her eyes trailing him up and down.  “It’s been too long, dear.  You look tired.”  Draco tried to reign in the desire to roll his eyes at that one.  She took a delicate sip of her drink and continued, “But I must admit the hard work has paid off.  Your arms and shoulders—just what are those Aurors feeding you?”
But before he could ponder on what to do, his wand chimed to signal it was time.  Draco took a large breath to calm his nerves.  Fuck it, it was too late now.  If this all blew up in his face, at least he had Pansy to blame for it all.  He swallowed, his throat suddenly drying up at an alarming rate.  With his heart pounding, he walked the small distance out of his room and knocked quietly on Harry’s door.  “Just a minute,” he heard him call in response.  Draco’s heart lurched, just hearing his voice.  Merlin, they were really doing this, weren’t they?
She scoffed, clearly not caring at the attention she was drawing to their table.  “He liked the tea you made him—even wished you a Merry Christmas, and you ran away like a frightened school girl.  Merlin, you’re hopeless.”  She then waved her hand and signaled to a waiter.  He paused at their table and before he could even get in a word in, she smiled politely up at him and asked, “Does this establishment offer anything a little stronger we could put in this coffee?  My friend is a lost cause—think we need to get out the hard stuff...”
He didn’t want to think about it.  He knew somewhere out there was Harry Potter.  No word from Voldemort meant Harry Potter was safe, that he was working to stop this.  Draco hated Potter, but he hated Voldemort more.  Potter had to win, he
“Not a bad way to go, if you ask me,” Harry smiled widely.  Draco’s heart pounded, and he swallowed thickly.
“Right,” Draco colored.  “This is somewhat embarrassing for me to say, but I think you should know before we get any further.”  Harry’s eyebrows rose, but he didn’t dare interrupt and waited patiently for Draco to continue.  Draco inhaled once more and let out a shaking breath.  “It’s just...I’ve never been completely intimate with another person.  I mean, oral sex, yes.  But to actually...”
.  Potter also informed him that the music player was called a stereo and that not only could it play cds, but it could also play tapes and the radio (which was some sort of Muggle wireless network).  Draco was enthralled with the concept of it all, doing all of this without magic.  It was mad, really.
Dean laughed, shaking his head.  “Oh, don’t worry about them.  They reacted much in the same way when they caught us snogging the first time.  They’ll get over it.”
Pansy snorted.  “Let’s see, Longbottom got fit.  Blaise finally has the Quidditch star he’d been chasing for weeks.  And you’ve finally told our Lord and Savior Potter how you feel about him...”
“Harry.  Stop, please.”  Draco shushed him with a finger to his lips.  He let his touch linger and his eyes burned as they connected with Harry’s.  “Yes, Harry.
“Oh,” Draco felt his flush rising past his cheeks and up his neck.  “So, Granger knows?  What um...how did she react?”
He couldn’t settle his nerves down for anything.  One glance from Potter and Draco was an absolute wreck.  He didn’t think he had stopped blushing from the moment he had knocked on Harry's door.  Now they were walking close to each other—close enough to touch, actually, but Draco hadn’t the nerve to reach for his hand.  He wasn’t entirely sure if the gesture would be welcome.
Frowning, Draco could already see the plan in motion forming across her face.  Sure enough she started, “If you want, I could talk to—”
Draco ran in the mornings, before the rest of his fellow classmates even stirred.  It was the only time he had to himself.  He’d layer his clothes when it was cold, charm his shoes to resist slipping, and even repel the rain.  Inclement weather didn’t stop him.  He needed to run each morning, just like he needed to eat or breathe.  It was his only escape in those dark months.
“I was wondering if you were free tonight?”  He asked, chewing on his plump lips nervously.  Draco would not let his eyes look there.
“Hurry up,” moaned Malfoy, his tone of voice drifting from impatient, now far away and lost.   Harry’d never heard him sound like
“Draco...” Pansy reached for him, wrapping her arm around him and rubbing small circles along his back.  “It’s fine, darling.  You have nothing to worry about...”
Draco waited for the bird to settle before he even attempted to retrieve the letter.  When the owl finally released the envelope, he pushed off Draco and flew up and away into the snowy sky.  So, no reply was needed.  He frowned, looking at the letter and noticed there was nothing written on the outside.  He peeled open the envelope and pulled out the parchment.
Harry stopped his teasing, and proceeded to finish undressing him.  He kissed, nipped, and caressed each inch of creamy skin revealed to him.  He had been kneeling in front of Draco as he helped him out of his pants, licking along his inner thigh.  Then he began to stand, once Draco was free of all his clothes.  Harry stared at him in wonder, and Draco felt like melting under that gaze.  “Lay on the bed, love,” he whispered, kissing him once more.
Then he started to wave his wand, a curse on his lips.  Harry saw out of the corner of his eye Malfoy root around under the couch pillows and pulled out his own wand.
He shrugged nervously.  “I’m not sure.  I was going to have breakfast with you then probably go to the gym.  Have you run today?”
“Potter stop fucking teasing and get on with it,” Draco huffed in irritation.  “Don’t say you are going to do it and then back out.  If you don’t have your mouth on me in the next minute, I’m going to shove your face down there and do it regardless.”
Harry stood up, helping Draco down the last step.  Now on even footing, Draco was still slightly taller.  Harry stood on the tips of his toes and reached for Draco’s lips with his own.  Even though it was a quick, practically chaste kiss, Draco still felt as if he was melting.  Harry’s smile and his sheer close proximity wasn’t helping matters either.
“So, what do you mean they haven’t been together since 6th year?  I saw them after the battle, arm in arm.  The Prophet’s taken loads of pictures of them kissing.  It’s sickening really.”  Draco said over his vodka tonic.
He made small dabbing motions along his nose, Draco clenching his eyes shut.  After what felt like eternity, Potter slid the cloth further down and grabbed Draco’s chin softly.  The contact of his bare fingers holding Draco still made his stomach flutter.
“Oh FUCK,” Malfoy shouted, shooting his release all over Harry’s fingers.  His arse kept on clenching, drawing Harry’s release out in long pulses.  “It’s....it’s you....holy fucking shit,” Malfoy moaned through his orgasm, trembling in Harry’s arms.
“No,” Harry gave him a small smile, almost nervous.  “I do sleep here most nights, but my time is sort of split up at both places.  I’m in the process of remodeling, and well...I’d like to show you the house.  If that is ok...”
Harry groaned automatically, opening his mouth to allow Draco’s tongue to slip inside.  He was going absolutely mad with the feel of Draco completely underneath him, and Harry couldn’t stand it anymore.  With his other hand not holding Draco’s wrists, he brought it up to Draco’s chest and caressed him through the fabric of his shirt.  He loved how sharp the planes of his chest felt, and Harry couldn’t help yanking on the t-shirt and pulling it aside.  At last his hands connected with bare flesh, and Draco moaned along Harry’s lips.
Pansy smirked, sipping her glass of merlot.  “Honestly Draco.  Have you kept each and every Prophet article?  I thought you were over this by now...”
He laughed nervously, pushing Harry’s hands aside to help him get it off that much quicker.  When the last button finally slipped free, Harry quickly shucked it off Draco’s shoulders and proceeded to pull out his silk shirt from his trousers.  His hand came up to Draco’s collar, gently working those buttons down as well.  Draco stopped breathing, feeling Harry’s fingers brush against his bare chest.  “H-Harry,” he stuttered.
Harry pulled off, gripping Draco’s base tightly to suppress the feeling.  Draco’s eyes snapped open and they met Harry’s gaze immediately.  “Look at me,” Harry croaked out, his voice completely destroyed.  “Look at me when you come down my throat,” he demanded.
“We’ll be right here with you if things go awry,” Pansy leaned in, kissing his cheek.  “We are happy for you and Harry.  It’s going to be fine, love.  You have nothing to worry about.”
Draco let out a strangled noise, feeling himself harden immediately.  “Fuck, Harry,” he groaned once more, clenching his eyes shut.  He couldn’t look at those earnest and gleaming green eyes right now.  It was too much.  “Right here?” he asked instead, almost shyly.
“Secretly, I think they find it hot,” Seamus said, his gaze still trained on Draco and Harry.  “Can’t say that I’d blame them on that one...”
Groaning, he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes.  “No, Pansy.  That’s not it.  It’s just...I’ve never...”
is he, exactly?” Pansy asked Dean and Seamus, completely ignoring Draco.  All he could do was glare at his friend—and secretly contemplate going back to his room to get his wand.
“No,” he responded carefully.  “This just isn’t like us, wouldn’t you agree?  You’re supposed to fight me every step of the way, think I’m always up to something.  Yell at me or punch me, I don’t know.  We can duel for old times sake.”
“Good,” Harry grinned, finishing the rest of his tea.  “Well, if you’ve got the time you could join me at the gym.  We could talk more about this there.”
“Please what?” Harry kept on peppering Draco’s skin with kisses, moving further down his leg to where it met at his hip.  His fingers were sliding in and out with ease now, and it wasn’t long till the third finger joined the other two.  Harry watched greedily as his fingers disappeared inside, his cock throbbing.  “You are doing so well,” he praised, stretching and pushing his fingers even deeper.
He needed some time to himself, to think through just what the fuck had just happened.  He pointed his wand at the door, firmly locking the door and putting up a silencing charm in the process.  He wasn’t sure if Potter would try to get in, but he absolutely couldn’t see him now.  He needed to think, he needed to calm down.  He needed to ignore just how fucking tight his sweatpants were around his groin.
Draco had been gripping the sheets on either side tightly, but as Harry stroked him, he grabbed a hold of Harry’s sweaty back, pulling him in even closer.  The movement caused Harry to slide further inside, immediately making both of them moan through their kiss.  “More, Harry,” Draco begged, his fingernails digging in his skin.  “Give it to me.”
Harry’s eyes twinkled across the table.  "You’re so posh, Draco,” he said, warmly.  It was clearly a compliment from his tone of voice.  “I’m sure it’ll be lovely.”
“NO!”  Draco yelled, blushing even darker.  He didn’t know why he was still standing here talking to these two.  Nothing good could come of this but further embarrassment, surely.
Harry stood immediately, their chests pressed together from the movement.  Draco didn’t step away, instead he shifted his hips purposefully and Harry hissed from the contact.  “Let’s go,” he let out a breathless whisper.  “Bedroom.  Now.”
Draco chuckled, trying to mask some of his nervousness.  But inside his heart felt like it was going to leap out of his chest, it was beating so fast.  He swallowed, noting Harry’s eyes zeroing in on his throat.  Leaning closer, he moved his lips to Harry’s ear.  “Show me your moves, Potter,” he muttered, before he nibbled playfully at the skin there.
“Right,” Ron smiled awkwardly, looking at each of them.  “Well, this has been fun.  I have to head out.  Harry you coming along?”  He nodded to Harry, making his way to the fireplace.  He pinched some Floo and threw it in, the flames turning emerald.
He didn’t know how long he ran, he just kept at it till his chest ached.  When the feeling became overwhelming, he crouched low and started panting.  His legs tingled, muscles clenching as he wiped the sweat from his brow.  It was while he was leaned over, hands holding his thighs that he heard the door of the gym open.  Draco lifted his head, and of course, who else would be walking in but Potter?
He heard Potter drop his gym bag, making a loud sound that echoed in the empty room.  Draco tried not to look at him, and attempted to walk on past.  But of course, it couldn’t be that simple.
But what ended up happening instead was Draco squirming out from under him and avoiding blows at all costs.  He didn’t want to swing at Potter—he knew if he even attempted it, chances are he’d be punished for such a thing.  So, he darted this way and that.  Their instructor was bored and impatient and whistled to signal the end of the demonstration.  And when they were finished, Harry had a confused look to his face and asked, “Why didn’t you hit me?”  Draco never did answer his question.
in some horrid plaid pants and an oversized t-shirt.  Draco always had to put in some sort of effort, and even then, he was pretty sure he didn’t sparkle, thank you very much.
“Oh, um sorry,” Harry called sheepishly, having noticed Draco almost immediately.  “I can, er, leave if you want me to...”
When he returned to the dorm, the sisters were gone.  Draco could tell they must have left for class in a hurry because they still have a few spare scroll and quills upon the table and dishes in the sink from breakfast.  Draco did the courteous thing and waved his wand at the mess and cleaned it up as he made his way back to his room.  It was when he was sitting on his bed and pulling off his trainers that he noticed it.
He choked on his drink.  Coughing, he cleared his throat.  Her perfectly penciled eyebrow rose, watching him carefully.  “Why?” he asked, “It’s just, you don’t need one Pansy.”
The couple reached her at last, Mr. Zabini taking Mrs. Parkinson’s offered hand and kissing it gently.  “Radiant as always, Mrs. Parkinson,” he greeted her, purely charismatic as only a Zabini could be.
“Harry,” Draco groaned, his voice suddenly a lot closer.  Harry’s eyes flew open and Draco had moved from his spot on the arm chair and was standing in front of him.  He was palming his own erection through his trousers, lips parted, and his grey eyes looked like molten silver from the way he was staring Harry down with such want and intent.  “Please...” He groaned once more, biting his lip as he finally moved his eyes to Harry’s lap.
“Figures,” Parvati mumbled, finishing the rest of her coffee.  “Of course, the hottest boys in our year would hook up with each other.  Is anyone straight anymore?”
“I think you might have conjured it on accident,” he answered with a knowing smile.  He walked the few steps to where Draco stood and made to reach for his hand.
It was dark when Draco awoke.  He cringed as he sat up and saw the bloody sweater he was still wearing.  He pulled it off and threw it in the corner with the rest of his laundry, only now noticing the owl sitting patiently on the perch outside his bedroom window.  “Come in, darling,” he cooed, instantly recognizing the owl as Pansy’s.  The bird held a letter.
His fingers joined Harry’s tongue causing Draco to quiver uncontrollably.  He opened him up slowly, pressing against his tight ring of muscles.  It wasn’t till he was fully relaxed and Harry’s finger slipped inside with ease that he added another.  Draco let out a small grunt, his chest rising and falling in an erratic pattern.  “You all right....love?”  Harry whispered, withdrawing his face to look at him spread beautifully along the bed.  He began kissing Draco’s inner thigh once more as he spread his fingers hesitantly.
“This is nice, Draco,” Harry grinned, taking his seat across from him.  “I had no idea you knew about places like this.”
Draco flushed, as everyone moved their attention to him.  “Pansy, we’ve been through this.  You don’t have to get me anything.  And yes,” he took a sip of his drink.  “Luna’s gift, though unexpected, was very thoughtful.”
“Well, we could try,” Potter suggested as he now stared at his own trainers.  His blush now reached the tips of his ears and at any other time Draco would have found it endearing.  “I got Ron to back down, the twins seem to like you more now since our game in the snow.  Even Dean and Seamus think you’re not so bad now...”
Potter frowned, concern still across his features.  “All right, I guess.”  He dropped his arm and watched Draco carefully as he backed out of the room and headed for his dorm.  “Have a good night, Malfoy...”
“I didn’t even know what it was at the time,” Draco tried to shrug it off.  “I spent a lot of time that year watching him and wondering.  Making Potter stinks badges.  I guess I just wanted him to
“I wasn’t flirting!” she screeched back.  Draco couldn’t find a better moment than now.  He quickly left for his run while they were too distracted arguing with each other.
“Mmmm...last chance to back out, Malfoy.”  He mumbled, Draco feeling his stubble rubbing across his stomach and driving him crazy.
“Yes, exactly.  You’re going to drive him absolutely mad,” she winked.  Then they were back in the living room and passing through the Floo.  Dean and Seamus waved at them excitedly as they vanished into thin air.
His grin slowly returned, paired off with a pleasant pinking to his cheeks.  Potter looked good with that blush and Draco realized he wanted to see it happen more and more.  When he finally spoke next, he asked, “As friends?”
His face turned concerned, immediately.  But he sat next to him on the neighboring couch and pulled Draco’s hand to his lap.  “What is it?” he asked, worry laced in his voice.
“What do you mean?” Pansy asked, eyebrow rising.  “You’re over thinking things.  Just do what comes natural.”
The gym was a horrible idea, Draco soon realized.  How was he supposed to focus on anything else but the sweat accumulating at Harry’s brow and sliding further down his neck?  His face was beautifully flushed, muscles clenching as he performed his pushups, crunches, and various other stretches.  Draco attempted to meet him for each stretch, but after a while he lingered behind.  Harry was just too distracting, and those form fitting joggers hid
With her bright red lips in a pout, she continued, “Oh all right.  Could you please bring us two more of those lemon bars then?  Maybe the extra sugar would help this disaster...”
Gulping, Draco read through the parchment on his desk.  Of course, it was an essay type question test.  He dipped his quill in the ink and didn’t hesitate a moment longer.  He began to write in a rush, barely thinking as the words filled the page.  He was thankful to have at least known the material.  But that should have come as no surprise to him, he was rather book smart.  Locking himself in his room and studying for hours on end had its benefits.  However, given that he was practically a half hour late, he wouldn’t have the time to go into detail in any of his responses.  He’d have to skip right to the point, just to ensure he could complete the whole exam.
“Oh, ok.”  Draco licked his lips nervously.  “I’ll, um, owl you a time and place.  That sound good?”
“Potter, he tried to kill you.  I should be asking you that,” Malfoy replied, closing in on him and eyeing him carefully.
Draco answered with a small smile.  Then he leaned in and carefully left a chaste kiss.  Harry’s whole face flushed at the touch.  “Let‘s go home, Harry.”  Grinning, Harry pulled Draco into his arms in a firm embrace.  Then they both felt the pull of apparition take them away.
“He’s bi,” she said simply, as if she was commenting on snow being cold and rain wet.  “Apparently I tend to date in some sort of trend.  Dean Thomas, raging bisexual.  Harry Potter, the closeted bisexual.  Then this sphinx over here that’s had half of London.”
She shrugged, pursing her lips in concentration.  “He pulled you out of that fire, I’d say that was pretty nice of him...he testified for you and your mother in court.  Another thing, I’d say, that’s pretty nice.”
The moment their skin touched, Draco was frozen.  He looked at their hands, feeling his face heat up.  He fumbled with the disc, dropping it awkwardly into Potter’s hands.  If Potter noticed Draco’s fumble, he hadn’t said anything.  Instead his lips broke out into a small smile, before he slipped the music into the player.  He pushed another button and music slowly started to fill the room.  The sound of drums and a keyboard started playing to a steady beat.  Harry let out a delighted laugh, which made Draco’s insides squirm.
“You own the old Black property,” Draco noted.  It was common knowledge.  Draco hadn’t stepped foot in that home since he was a small child.  All he could vaguely remember of the place was drafty windows and those horrifying House Elf heads.  He really hoped Harry had gotten rid of those, at least.
He flipped through the paper, finding the Quidditch section and noting the leaderboard with the Holyhead Harpies set to take the top spot.  His eyes scanned the rest of the page, falling on a photo of Ginny Weasley flying through the air and throwing the Quaffle.  The caption read,
“Merlin,” Pansy sighed.  “As sweet as that all is, you’re starting to sound like a Hufflepuff.  I think it’s safe to say I have no desire to jump you anymore.”
“I was just a child that was taught all the wrong things,” Draco frowned, pulling his lip in with his teeth.
Blaise Zabini was always so sharp looking, and tonight would be no different.  He wore some expensive designer dress robes that accentuated his broad shoulders and thin waist perfectly.  Draco and Pansy gave him both an appreciative glance.  “Well?” he asked, doing a small turn in front of the gilded mirror.
“And I’ve wasted all my time analyzing on something that wasn’t even illegal, basically?”  He asked, helplessly.  Dean made to get up and walk around the table, but was forced back into his seat by a swift yank from Draco.
“Fuck,” Harry exhaled shakily, collapsing on the bed next to Draco.  He wiped his brow, his lips fighting a grin as he looked at how severely flushed and debauched Draco looked.
He mentioned it over dinner on Monday night with Dean and Seamus.  The three of them were working on another potions related assignment and they’d ordered takeout.  Draco dug around in his box of rice with his chopsticks and asked nonchalantly, “Uh, do you guys have any plans for tomorrow morning?”
“Just studying,” Dean answered, while he sat up straighter in his seat.  He’d been sitting in between Seamus and Draco, and he started to drape his arm across both their seats.
“Ew, Draco, don’t be crude.”  Draco immediately felt relief at that.  Let her date anyone else, but not that fucking prick.
Before he could get another guess in, Pansy couldn’t handle much more of this.  She interrupted, “Oh it’s Weasley and Longbottom!  Can you believe it?”  She was giggling now, her face lighting up.
When Draco ran, he let his mind wander.  He thought of his parents, his friends, Dumbledore, Severus, the Dark Lord—and yes, of course Harry Potter.  At Hogwarts, it was more of a question of
Draco gaped at her; Blaise grinned widely.  “Merlin, I love it when you threaten my friends.”  He wrapped an arm around her and nodded at Draco.  “We’re going to go find one of those famous flaming Christmas puddings.  Do you want us to go get you a serving, Draco?”
, Draco began to panic.  His thoughts tumbling around and perhaps he read this situation completely wrong.  Perhaps he’d just pissed him off, maybe he’d punch him in the face next for even thinking such a thing.  But before Draco’s mind could go completely off the deep end, Harry’s voice broke through.  “Yeah,” he gulped, biting his lips as if he was keeping his smile down for once.  “I’d like that.”
Gasping, Harry grabbed Draco roughly by his shirt and led him out of the drawing room.  They made it up the stairs before Harry had to stop and pin him against the wall.  He devoured Draco’s mouth in a kiss that left him breathless and almost unable to stand.  “I’ll show you something, Malfoy,” he smirked, practically holding Draco up.  His other hand fumbled with the nearby door, and he managed to open it while distracting Draco with kisses along his neck.  Then they were stumbling into the room and Harry waved his hand casually to shut the door behind them.
His Auror robe slipped from his shoulders, making a loud thunk upon the floor.  Malfoy cocked his head to the side to look at the source of the noise by instinct, but Harry was pleased to see his eyes were blindfolded with the same black silk material he’d used to tie himself up.  “Take it all off,” he demanded, his face still turned towards Harry.  He sucked his lips inside, biting on them as if he was holding back saying something else.  Harry very much wanted to pull those lips out himself, suck them into his own mouth.  Perhaps even stuff his mouth full of something else, make the annoying prat silent for once.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned.  Of course, he had class as well.  He’d just simply forgotten about it.  Kind of hard to focus on much of anything at all with this gorgeous blonde under him.  He sighed, releasing his hold along Draco’s wrists and rolled off of him.  He laid on his back on the mat, taking a few longer breaths to calm his racing heart.  Unconsciously he trailed a hand down to the front of his joggers and pressed his palm down on his erection, willing for it to calm down too.  Draco glanced at the movement and bit down on his lips, watching Harry.
he would like that.  Just the thought alone of Harry walking around in Pansy’s stilettos was causing his head to spin and heart to stall.
“Harry?!  Since when are he and Harry a thing?” Parvati screeched.  Draco winced for a second, merely reacting to her shrill tone, but then the smile returned.  His eyes never leaving the flames from the fireplace.
Lunch would come and go, and Draco would find himself wiping his brow and leaning against the outside wall of the stables.  Their horses long since fled, when darkness resided upon the grounds.  Draco should have run with them, in all honesty.  He panted, attempting to regulate his breathing once more.  His mind still drifting to Potter, wondering if he had given a statement for all of them, if it was just part of his duty as the Savior.  Or maybe he only bothered with Draco, for whatever reason Draco didn’t know.
"I had asked for the keys to your flat. Not your fucking cabin!" Darien yells at Cormac as he enters Cormac's office. He seems more pissed off as Cormac ignores him, packing up his stuff. "I'm talking to you, McLaggen!"
Draco's blush renews and his cheeks turn completely red. He bites his lower lip, completely flushed. Oh, how Harry loves that blush. He repeats the action again.
"I'm sorry, Harry, I'm so sorry. I feel so cheap. I feel so, I don't want to become what my husband has. I feel like a slut. I feel like a slut. Please, Harry please." Draco sobs and turns to run away.
"Belle Darling." Blaise said. "Ever since I met you, I knew you were different. You were sassy and witty but kind and compassionate at the same time. You could be ruthless dangerous and ruthlessly kind. You always understood what I am feeling because we are exactly the same kind of people, just very little different. And when I first kissed you, I knew I never want to kiss anyone else. I want to belong to you all my life. I love you forever and always."
If Harry wasn't all maniac and raged at the moment, he would've laughed. He still wants to but those movies remind him that a smile is more creepy, and creepy is what he's going for. Or maybe he should go for friendly like he did for those four people. Huh. He really should've thought this through instead of just going at it after acquiring all the information he needed. But he's been smiling for a while now so a laugh will probably tick Cartier off. Yes. Stick with the smile now.
"Draco, Bellatrix was always a psychopath. Violence and bloodshed was always her idea of fun. I remember how me and Sirius were always talking about running away from them to live a life without their blood purity bullshit. Sirius did run away. After everything that happened,  I refused to believe that Sirius would betray James and Lily. I was glad when I found out Sirius was innocent. Cissy and I were always close. It was one of the reasons Bella hated me. But then I started to like Edward. Cissy was fine with it until she met your father. Thats when our differences started. I knew that I had no one in that family. I only had Cissy and Sirius. Then I had no one. When I found out about you, I wanted to take you away from them because I knew they would turn you into twisted terrorists like them. When I read Harry's letter, Draco, you have no idea how happy I was knowing you didn't go on their footsteps. I'm so proud of you kids." Andromeda said and proceeded to kiss mine and Belle's forehead.
Yeah. Molly, Dori and Mar just left. I've never seen Molly so angry. She said she will kill Bellatrix herself one day.
"Exactly. I was equally in danger with you as I was there. I had nowhere to go. You would've tortured me equally. Now Potter and I are dating. What about it?" Draco said.
"Find Draco, would you? And if you find him, ask him to come home. And if he seems like he's in danger, come to get me immediately." Harry tells the patronus.
"There are kinks, which are things you definitely like and will do. Soft limits that are a list of maybes. Hard limits which are a definite no. There is safeword. That's a word you say when you want to stop whatever is happening. And there is aftercare which means the dominant takes care of the submissive after they are done with a scene. Like Potter always makes sure I've had water and as much as I hate to admit it, I become awful clingy and need the body contact. So Potter holds me until I'm asleep, most of the time I'm asleep after a scene. And Potter says a lot of loving words and kisses and cuddles. He even takes care of the marks like applying disinfectant and stuff.  You're topping or bottoming?" Draco asks.
Draco and Harry were with Luna, who had agreed to be their surrogate. Luna was in labour and was finally giving birth. Harry had given her sperm for this. They wanted Luna to be the mother because it meant that there was a chance that one of the child would have white blonde hair. Luna and Draco had similar hair. Luna finally gave a huge push and crying could be heard.
"You don't need to run Malfoy. This is your dorm as well. If you don't want me to talk to you then I won't." Harry says.
"Thank you sir! From now on, you will be my top priority." Cormac smiles as he goes to see his cabin.
And so Draco does. He takes a deep breath and gets on all four then puts his head under the soapy water. It doesn't take much effort to find Harry's cock and Harry moans as he feels Draco's mouth on it. After bobbing his head like ten times, Draco comes up for air and coughs.
"Is she the one from the zoo?" Draco squealed. His face was bright and looked happily at Nura like a child looks at a puppy.
"Tell him to leave." Malfoy says with a crack in his voice. Something in Harry's heart clenches more.
Charlie looks at Draco and Draco panics. His hazel eyes meet Draco's grey ones and Draco can see something in his eyes flash. Something that he has seen before. Something he wishes he wasn't seeing now because it's been three years and Charlie is here, looking just as good as he did then and Draco wants to bolt.
He looks back at the little child in his arms who seems to be talking to him in his own babbling language. It's so easy, isn't it? Being a child, not having any responsibility, not having to have the burdens, to be free. There's no chance for him to be free anymore, is there? Ah, here is comes. The tears. He can't. He just can't feel the remorse. He doesn't want to and he tries not to but the tears come anyway. He orphaned so many children in fight for not becoming an orphan himself. All this in vain. He ended up orphan, didn't he? He ended up just how he didn't want to end up. He lost everything.
I brushed and had a quick shower. Once done I ran to my room. I found a pen, yes pen. Not a quill. Its so time consuming, filling the ink again and again. I took a pen and wrote in the diary Theo gave us yesterday. I wrote in it fast.
Harry laughed. He laughed and shifted Draco's wrists above his head, holding them secured with a tight grip. And then he couldn't help himself. He leaned down, looked at Draco's lips and then back in his eyes. He leaned down so their lips were almost touching. Draco closed his eyes and let out a soft whimper. And Harry lost it. He smashed his lips on to Draco's and kissed him firm but gentle. Smiled when Draco kissed back. Harry pushed his tongue inside Draco's mouth and hungrily swallowed Draco's moan.
Harry looks at Ginny, still feeling guilty. She's an amazing girl. Supporting Harry as her heart breaks, Harry wishes he could ease her pain somehow.
"See, if she finds out, boss's marriage will be in trouble. Please. You've finished everything with him, haven't you? Then why put him through it? He was so worried he was crying. He was completely broken down, believe me! See, it's only for a few days, please understand!"
"You couldn't control yourself for a minute you little whore. You'll pay for this." He says and pushes me away so hard I fall to the ground.
Draco sits there in the winter garden, turning the pages of the old tome as he finishes reading the pages. Potter sits in front of with with his lap full of Teddy. Andromeda comes back with Nani Paki.
"Very good. I'll tell you, this is only for a week. Then if we both want to continue we will, but not without talking about it. And if any one of us don't want to do this after a week then we don't do it at all. Do you accept the terms?"
"Alright." He replies. "That will be for both of us. If any one of us want to stop what's happening then that's the word we'll say. Now what about name calling?"
The crimson tinge on Draco's cheeks are so visible as he blushes from Harry's praises. Draco always was a sucker for praises. And Harry loves giving praises.
They had the decency to look ashamed. Harry didn't blame them but they simply didn't understand. Harry remembers all those times his uncle used him as a punching bag. Using Harry to remove his frustrations of the day with his belt repeatedly hitting Harry. Harry hated belts. Belt was not something he wanted to spank Draco with but he wasn't about to let a belt get him down. He would only use the belt to get his pet pleasure. Never in punishment would he use the belt. He remembers so many nights, he was locked, bruised and scared through the beatings in the cupboard. He turned around and left the dorm, back to his pet who waited for him in their dorm.
Draco saw Potter to make a move of the professor, enraged but Draco stopped him with a shake of his head. This was his battle. He would fight it himself. And he was glad when Potter listened to him.
"Well, if that's that, I have something to do with my pet." Harry says and stands up from the chair he was sitting in the kitchen.
Draco gags as Potter directly shoves it down deep in his throat. He can feel his throat burn in intrusion. He tries to relax his throat and breath through the nose, which honestly is a huge task if you're sucking a cock like Potter's. Potter clutches Draco's hair with both hands and fucks Draco's throat in a brutal pace. Draco gags and chokes, he can feel his eyes burn with tears and spit drool down his chin. He knows Potter is close, he always does. And today, potter isn't trying to prolong his orgasm. Soon Draco can feel the sticky salty taste of Potter's cum. He coughs as he tries to swallow it all down.
"So I won't be able to cook for so many people. Shall I order take-away instead? Chinese okay?" Draco asks.
"Wow. You ramble quite a lot when embarrassed. Was it like I like you kinda kiss or I need to have you right here right now kinda kiss?"
He presses the cane more, watching Draco struggle to follow Harry's command to breath slowly while in pain. Harty twists the cane more and Draco jerks behind. Then taking Draco by surprise, Harry gives a sharp swat across Draco's chest, effectively hitting the left nipple. Draco lets out a scream and cries. The sounds all beautiful to Harry's ears. A couple more swats, getting both the nipples hit, Harry then picks out the clamps and places it on Draco's nipples. Draco hisses. He knows the clamps are tight and painful. He then pulls the foreskin of Draco's cock ahead and clamps it shut. Draco lets out a loud scream. Harry worries that he went a bit beyond Draco can handle but then he hears Draco beg for more and breathes. He gives a small swat on Draco's cock and Draco jerks behind. Oh god. Harry is so hard. He canes Draco's front, the chest and the lovely cock again and again. Not keeping a proper rhythm, keeping Draco on edge. The clamps still tightly shut on Draco's nipple and cock. He stops and finally drops the cane. He looks at Draco. Draco is crying loudly, barely being able to breath. So many marks, red and purple, all over Draco's chest and abdomen. On his cock as well. Draco is barely managing on his tippy toes and he looks BEAUTIFUL.
"That is true. Not all are open minded like you." Bulstrode smirks and takes a drag of her cigarette.
Harry is a little afraid that Draco will think its too soon. Is it? They did live the entire Christmas break together. Isn't this the step forward? And Harry loves Draco, he wants to live with him. He looks at Draco who is looking back at Harry with his eyes soft.
"Harry, nice to see you." Kingsley said and barely acknowledged Draco. "We are here to talk about your outbursts with Mr Jared Sparks, Mr Cormack Mclaggen and Mr Donald Dickens, the Prophet's editor. And we're here to talk to Mr Malfoy."
Harry Potter has always been powerful. He was powerful as a child to kill the Dark Lord. He was powerful to run an army. He was powerful to kill Voldemort again. He was powerful to finish an entire war. And now, he is more powerfull than ever.
We need to find a way to get out of this fucking castle immediately. Bee you concentrate on saving the kids and Ginny rn. We'll try and find a way to escape. Guys meet me in the common room. We leave and search every inch of this castle now.
Pain. So much pain. Stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Harry. Harry make them stop. Harry please. It hurts. It hurts so fucking much please stop. Someone please help.
"Please please please please. Harry!" Draco begs. He doesn't know what for but he does. He needs to cum so bad.
"You all can relax. I don't plan on hurting him. He's mine and I'll make sure he is always aware of how much he means to me. You can trust me." Harry reassures them.
"He was asleep before I reached the dorm last night and today he didn't even look at me." Well, this was true.
Harry swallowed as he saw Draco's eyes light up. Damn. Now that Draco has this leverage, he'll be like a dog with a bone. Draco gave a huge smirk.
And as if Harry heard him, Harry tightens his hold even more on Draco. He pets Draco's hair and his back simultaneously. Until Draco passes out, exhausted.
Harry is in the library with Hermione and Luna when Malfoy comes with the blond sister and Zabini. Harry was drinking water when he literally chokes on it as he sees Malfoy enter. Malfoy looks at him and smirks. Its not just Malfoy. Its Malfoy wearing a nice black leather skirt. The length extremely indecent for school and gives perfect exposure to those skinny and lean, milky white thighs and long legs. He can faintly hear Luna and Hermione laugh. His eyes are fixed at Malfoy's thigh showing out of his barely there skirt and swallows a huge lump in his throat. The library suddenly feels extremely hot. Just to torture Harry more, Malfoy fake drops his book. He turns to give Harry a full view of his arse and bends down on his waist to pick it up, giving Harry a full show of those pretty blue lace knickers. Harry takes a deep breath and gives out a heavy groan. He burries his face in his palms and yells.
As Hayden entered the elaborately decorated room, he couldn't help but feel anxious as he walked down the stairs case.
Hayden was soon on the path that led to Hogsmead. Logically, there weren't many other students out considering classes would be starting in a couple minutes, so Hayden was pretty much by himself on the path along with maybe a handful of other people that were either well ahead of him, or just getting on the path.
"I'm so sorry, my child! I'll make sure you are never put in harm's way again! Can you ever forgive me Hayden?" By this time, Tom had tears flowing down his cheeks and pretty soon Hayden had a couple tears as well.
He looked around, trying to figure out why he was in his room and not in the infirmary. He knew he got injured in the first task, he couldn't remember if he had finished the task though.
"Something I hope you'll enjoy" Draco replied softly as he gently brought up a hand to tuck his hair behind his ear. Hayden leaned into the warm hand cupping the side of his face. He smiled as he relished in the feeling.
Looking over to the other side of the room, he saw the Draco was still asleep, his blonde hair spilling over his black pillow like moonlight. Hayden started for a moment, he could feel a small smile slip over his features.
Hayden stood from where he was seated, bowed his head in acknowledgment of the apology and disapperated from the study.
Almost immediately after classes, Hayden rushed over to his mother's classroom, hoping that he hadn't given another student detention.
Harry collapsed on his bed in exhaustion that night, the Dursleys having worked him harder than normal.
Hayden walked up to Dumbledore with conviction in his steps. He continued his scathing gaze until he passed the old man and looked to the door he was supposed to walk through.
"Hey," Hayden grabbed Draco's wrist as he turned away, making Draco face him again. "I'll be fine, I promise!" Hayden reassured, giving Draco a comforting smile. Or at least he hoped it was comforting.
"Mhh Hmm," Draco hummed. "You made the dragon submit to you with them. To be honest, it was really rather amazing"
Once the meeting had ended, about an hour and a half later, a knock sounded on the study door. Before Hayden even had the chance to stand, the door opened and Draco Malfoy walked in, completely oblivious to what was happening.
“Now, now. It's so hard to be attentive when you're so determined to be a brat” Cedric chastised, keeping his fingers against Hayden's lips as he leaned a bit closer.
"We wait, we can't do anything until the others have done their part. Now come on, someones bound to notice here, we need to leave." the leader responded.
Hayden walked back to his room a little while later after just visiting with his mum. When he got back to his dorm, quietly as to not wake the blonde, he saw his owl sitting on his desk.
After a minute of them doing stunts and tricks in the aisle, their High Master came in, following the other students, with another walking beside him. When he two walked in, you could hear the Gryffindors freaking out.
"I am going down there to make sure Hayden is as far away from this tournament as possible, I will not allow him to battle a dragon all on his own!" Draco said with conviction.
"Hayden Snape" He said before leaning back against the wall and closing his eyes. Unfortunately the two did not get the hint.
“I know but that doesn’t mean you should! If you go and do something rash then someone is bound to find you have creature blood and by relation, that I have it as well! I cannot have the entire school knowing that we are creatures! It’s bad enough that Granger and Krum know, it would be disastrous if anyone else knew” Hayden explained, muttering at the end as he sat on their bed.
And you all though everything would be better now Hayden and Draco were back together! I can't wait for the next chapter!
Hayden sighed in relief before turning around. He started to slowly climb his way out the ditch he was in.
Viktor leaned back a little, smiling. Hayden was blushing at his closeness, flustered at how the taller man was acting.
Hayden took a breath in as he was graced with Draco's smile. He had never seen it before, it was beautiful. It was a soft smile but it showed how happy he was. An emotion Hayden had just never seen before.
Harry laid in his bed for a couple minutes. He hadn't heard from any of his friends at all so far this summer. He knew that Ron and Hermione had gone traveling with their families out of the country, but that hasn't stopped them from sending at least one letter.
“Wh-When Draco pulled you out of the water d-during the last task. You had wings, and p-people usually don't have wings un-unless t-they have some sort of cre-creature blood in them. You d-don't h-have to answer if you aren't comfortable with t-telling me, I understand. I'm just curious. Your w-wings were as black as coal when you were dragged onto the platform” the girl uncharacteristically stuttered as she mumbled quickly.
Hayden started to look around the store, but found himself gravitating more towards the women's section. Severus had expected this, so he went over to Hayden and handed him a dress telling him to go try it on.
"GET UP BOY!" Harry's Uncle Vernon yelled. The poor wizard could tell already that Vernon was in a very bad mood.
"I don't need them anyway. There was always something off about them, I don't think they cared for me at all" Hayden said.
Hayden arrived at Hogwarts on Friday night. Now he had to figure out how he was going to keep his distance from Draco for the next two days until school officially starts.
"Champions, in a circle around me" Barty directed moving Fleur on his left, Viktor next to her, Cedrick between Viktor and Hayden, who was on Barty's right.
"Hello" Hayden said cautiously after a minute of silence, but as soon as the word left his mouth he was engulfed into a bone crushing hug from his father.
Severus smiled at him. "No, you are able to hide them. Just concentrate on them disappearing, and they will"
After a minute, Hayden finally opened the door. When Draco walked in, the first thing he saw was sad Hayden wrapped up in blankets in a ball on his bed. Draco couldn't help but think he looked adorable!
Once everyone was seated with their partners for the day, McGonagall started giving out instructions on what they were to be doing.
"Hayden, I would like to introduce you to some very important people, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix LeStrange" Tom pointed out.
Draco sat there blankly for a minute, processing his teachings words, before slowly getting up and shuffling back out of his office.
"Draco, think hard for me? I came the year Harry Potter disappeared. Why else would I bring him up now if it wasn't important?" Hayden asked. He could feel his eyes start to sting from the uncomfortable lump in his throat.
Once Dumbledore was done, the feast began. Throughout the meal, Malfoy cast glances over at Hayden whenever he thought the other wasn't looking. But of course, Hayden always noticed.
And so Draco ignores everybody to converse with this Veela lady in French who's name is Fleur. And the reason she seemed so familiar is because she was one of the champions for the triwizard competition at Hogwarts. Draco loves speaking French. It's one of the rare things he is brilliant at. He speaks French as it's his native language, which by the way, it is. Fleur includes Andromeda, amusement twinkling in their eyes. They laugh about how awkward all are here as they watch them converse in French, not knowing what the they are talking about
I closed the journal and stared at it. I felt so many emotions. I felt happy because I felt connected to my family that I lost. I felt angry because I couldn't save my godfather and uncle Moony. I felt upset because they aren't here with me anymore. I realized that Draco had Teddy in his arms. Draco's expressions were upset as well. He still gave me a weak smile. I gave him a kiss and we all fell asleep together.
"Shut up. Come now. I'll introduce you to Elizabeth. She's the one who you will work with if you nail it."
Pansy knocked at Smith's door, wearing a beautiful red dress that shows off her best curves and assets. She's determined to sleep with him now. Three weeks are slow enough, right? It's a house elf that opens the door.
Please don't talk like it's already over please please please. I can't live without you all. You all are my family. You'll are the only true friends I've ever had. I won't be able to live like this. Please!
Its been two days. Two days and no boy in the entire fucking school will touch him. The dimwits are scared of Potter, apparantly.
"Looks like you've found my private garden and these two babies. Would you like to keep them?" Professor sprout asks.
Lily is still unconscious. Pads is sleeping. He'll be fine by tomorrow. I'm scared Remus. She won't wake up.
I leave my dorm and go in the common room. I see everyone is just as worried as me. I look at Luna and she looks at me. Luna is usually always high spirited, no matter the situation. But today, even she is as glum as anyone could be. With Luna being this way, I only lose more hope. What will happen to us?
Potter says this with such intensity looking into Draco's eyes that as much as Draco wants to believe its a lie, he can't. And a treacherous part of Draco's mind helps him with the suggestion that if anyone can understand half the things Draco has been through, it's Potter. Because Potter, like Draco, is broken and fucked up. Also, the bastard used Draco's given name and Merlin and Morgana it sounds sweet from his lips.
Draco's voice so shaky, so desperate, it sounds like music to Harry. And Harry wants to dance on this tune, he wants to play Draco as the melody, wants Draco to go along as Harry strings him.
"Very good. Five points to Hufflepuff." Storm smiled delighted. "Now occlumency is raising a wall on your mind and hiding everything behind that wall. The stronger the wall, the easier to hide everything."
The eight year common room was not green as Slytherin, Red or any other house colours. The common room was white. Completely white and students had the permission to add the decor they would like. So many students from other houses had already started to mingle up, discussing what they'd like to stick on the walls. Draco ignored them all and went to check out his room number. He sighed. Great. Just what he needs, being paired up with a Gryffindor. What were they thinking, pairing him with Neville Longbottom? He suddenly realises everyone is quiet and turns to see everyone and sneaking glances to the Slytherins. Especially Draco.
With a nod, Draco leaves the bathroom to follow his morning routine. Use the loo, fades the glamour, hate himself, put the glamour back on, brush his teeth, wash his face. You know, the usual. He leaves the bathroom and just as he was about to walk towards the window, Potter calls him out. He crooks one finger as a silent command to Draco to come near and Draco, like a good boy, obeys. Potter pulls the covers off his lower body, exposing his glorious cock, balls and thighs. Draco licks him lips and kneels between Potter's thighs. He looks at Potter, waiting for permission to start and when Potter nods his head in a yes, Draco attacks.
[Note: I will be using text posts and memes to show their conversations. If any of the dialogues is written by me and some are mixed. James is regular, Remus is italics, Sirius is bold, peter is underlined.]
"Lets leave." Harry said and gave Draco another peck on his lips. He could see the purple Hickey getting dark on Draco's neck. He caught Draco's hand and their fingers intertwined. They left the room holding hands. Everyone smiled at them and the game was over. They all got a lot more drunk, had some food, got more drunk. During this entire time, Draco and Harry kept stealing kisses. So did Neville and Hannah. Blaise and Belle kept their distance but blushed. After a couple more hours they all passed out on the floor of the living room.
Potter gives him a look at makes him swallow. He groans and gives a disdainful look at his pancakes. He sighs and picks up the fork.
His magic makes him remove the joggers and waits for other instructions. It doesn't come. Instead, Potter walks towards him and picks him up bridal style. Potter walks him in the bedroom, places him on the bed, lays down besides him and just holds him. He relaxes in Potter's arms, closes his eyes and smiles as he feels Potter stroke through his hair with one hand and his back with another. Nothing about this is sexual. Its just that. A dominant and his submissive, together in a loving embrace. Boyfriends together. That's it. And Draco breathes. He chuckles as he feels Nura fixes herself in between them, feeling left out.
Draco doesn't know what to think. He doesn't know if he'll ask Harry to stay. All he knows is that he has to see Harry one last time. He run towards the door and as soon as he opens it, he watches Darien standing at the door, all broken and on the verge of crying.
"Will you- Uh, can you, you know, make some pancakes maybe?" He asked, playing with the hem of the duvet.
"You can stay in these for now. In France, I'll arrange a proper nest for you to stay." Draco says as he pets Nura's head. "Potter! We still have a lot to pack." Draco calls out Harry.
"If you ever need me, I'll be there for you Draco. But it looks like I finally have a reason to move on. You know I'm only a call away." Christian says, as he slowly leads him towards the end of the dance floor, kisses him on the cheek.
Draco closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath. He hasn't been here an hour and he's already ao tired. It feels like it's been such a long day. Draco calls in Mimi to set up his silk sheets and bed. He sits on his bed as soon as he is done and watches as Mimi casts undetectable extension charm on his closet and sets his stuff how he likes it organised. Draco pulls out a photo frame out of the trunk. It's silver with beautiful flowers. There's a picture of Draco in his fourth year with his mother and Dally. They're both smiling at Dally's small form. She's in a bundle of blankets his mother is holding her delicately. Dally hasn't any hair in the picture. She does now. Beautiful white blond hair just like his. This is his favourite picture. Picture of him, hia mother and his new born sister before the dark lord came and fucked it all up. They had kept her birth a secret. Draco doesn't know the child well. She's four now and Draco has met her many times secretly. He places the photo frame on his bedside table takes out his book and sits on the bed to read.
"Blaise." Belle said with a soft sob and a wide smile. "We are two very same people. Who in this world would have thought that two people like us, who are so commitment phobic, who never wanted to settle down would end up settling down with each other. But you've always seen through me. You've always understood when I need to hug and when I need to be left alone. You've ways been perfect for me and I couldn't be any happier with anyone else. You're all I will ever need. I love you too, forever and always."
"Potter you hate me. Why would you want to be with me if not hurt me?" This question, Draco believes.
Draco narrows his eyes at Potter, who seems like he can dish out orders. Which he can. And Draco will listen. He always listens. That's how his father raised him, to obey anyone who he can. He's been drilled to be a puppet ever since he was a child. And right now he's obeying Harry Potter. He can't help it. He both loathes and loves this trait of his. Loathes because he can't help it when even the dirtiest of scums have used him knowing this about him, thanks to his father who gave him away, literally, like people give tea and coffee to the guests,  and loves because it does take the edge of being in charge and that when Potter speaks like that, it is so fucking sexy. He realises he hasn't replied to Potter for telling him not to play the metal music he likes so he gives a short nod and turns back to look at the view.
He took a sip of his minty tea and Draco watched closely as he swallowed.  “Merlin,” Dean cut in.  “If you guys want, we can leave you two alone.  I don’t think I can stand much more of how you two are looking at each other...”
before.  Without thinking, Harry shucked out of the rest of his uniform, kicking his boots off hurriedly and tucking the case files underneath his clothes.  He dipped his thumbs in the waistband of his too tight pants, pulling them down with more effort till his cock finally sprang free.  He was already leaking and he hadn’t even touched himself yet.
Draco walked over to her.  She was sitting on an antique settee with a book propped open in her lap.  Draco tried to glance at the pages but she hastily shut it and threw a pillow over the cover.  He raised an eyebrow at that but before he could inquire any further, she’d pulled the card out of his hands.  Draco waited patiently for her to finish reading it.
Potter grabbed at a bottle, uncorking it and dabbed his fingers inside.  His eyes never left Draco’s face, and soon his fingers returned.  He started the same path he had before, focusing on Draco’s nose.  A cooling tingling sensation enveloped him, the pain easing away.  Minutes passed and he was gradually able to start breathing out of his nose, the scent of blood gone.
“Right, then.”  Finishing her tea, she reached over for the kettle and poured herself another cup.  “So, are the rumors true then?  Our hero, big cock?  Ginevra wouldn’t let me know one way or the other, the wretch.”
“Right,” Harry whispered, the movement of his lips was felt under Draco’s finger that was still resting there.  Draco watched, transfixed as his finger moved along the line of Potter’s bottom lip.  Harry’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed thickly.  “You’re probably right...we should stop.  Before it gets to be too much...”
Draco shushed him with a finger to his lips.  Harry blinked in surprise.  When Draco finally felt like he got his voice under control he said, “Don’t apologize, Harry.  I liked it.  Very much,” he coughed, blushing even darker.  “I’d even suggest we go again, but I’m not sure I would be able to stop...”
Seamus sighed, walking over to him and giving him a small hug.  “Of course.  You’re our friend now.  Pansy can have one too, since she’s a friend of yours.  Plus, well, we heard about you and Neville.”  He winked over at her and Draco frowned.
When they pulled apart from their kiss, Draco knew now was probably the time.  He took a deep breath.  “Harry, there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
“It’s ok,” she smiled softly.  He led her to his disaster of a wardrobe silently.  This was the main reason for her visit, after all.  Draco had great taste, but Pansy’s was even better.  Draco knew high wizard fashion—Pansy knew
“We’re going to get going,” Parvati finished for her sister, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her out the door.
“Yeah, just as much as Potter.  Which means not at all.”  She slid her empty wine glass across the bar.  “Darling, can I get a few shots now?  My mouth is dry from all that wine.”
Harry chuckled in his ear, pressing them close.  Then they began to dance under the twinkling lights and ornaments.
“I need...” Draco moaned, bending his waist to feel even more.  He was squirming and trying to feel everything.  It just wasn‘t enough.  “More...Harry...I’m ready...”
“Wow,” Harry breathed out for both of them.  His gaze was heated as he took in all of Draco, and his mouth fell open of its own accord.  He couldn’t seem to keep his own gawking in check, and normally Draco would have found that highly amusing.  But Harry Potter looked fancy and delectable and Draco was having a hard time thinking anything else.
Bristling, Draco set the paper back on the coffee table and looked down at his lap.  He was wearing nice trousers and a button down top.  He decided to forego the matching vest and suit jacket, insisting this was comfortable enough.  After all, he still hadn’t the faintest idea where they were going.  He still wanted to look like he had tried.
Ron Weasley looked right pissed off.  His face was practically purple, and his nostrils were flared.  But the way Dean looked down on him, eyes burning and fists clenched there was no other option.  Potter pulled him by the sleeve and walked him to their room.  “Ron, it’s ok,” he said, trying to diffuse the situation before they disappeared inside.
His frown deepened.  “But that’s not what he said in the card!  He told me he’d want to take me to that fancy restaurant someday.  I have to find something like on his Christmas card.”
Draco choked on his drink.  Pansy smirked behind her glass.  He quickly recovered, gulping the rest of it down.  “And why would that matter if she’s shagging Blaise now?”
he always seemed to have.  It was a smile like no other, as if it was specifically reserved for Draco, and him alone.
“So, you’re saying, none of these potions are illegal substances?”  Seamus asked in disbelief, flipping through several sheets of parchment.  The three of them had various books, quills and scrolls spread out all over the kitchen table.
“Ahh, sorry,” Potter mumbled.  He was so close Draco could feel his breath hitting his cheeks as he exhaled.  Curiously, Draco finally opened his eyes.  He was lost, staring at Potter merely inches away from him.  He had a deep frown on his face, his eyes focused entirely on Malfoy’s lips.  That fluttering feeling rose up into his chest.  “Merlin, this looks terrible.  Let me see if this will help...if it doesn’t we might have to take you to the onsite healer...”
He stared at the card for what felt like ages.  His eyes reading the words over and over again.  There was no way this was actually happening.  But when Draco tried to pinch himself, he realized he was really awake and not dreaming.  The card in his hands was real, and of course the horrible script was Potter’s.  Draco memorized the look of his awful handwriting back in 3rd year.  There was no other person that wrote like him, as far as Draco knew.
There was a card propped on his desk in the corner.  He went over and picked it up.  On the front cover was a photograph of the front door of a restaurant, snow charmed to magically swirl throughout.  He found the sharp contrast of the stained wood paneling and the pure white snow to be absolutely beautiful.  It looked like a place Draco would love to see one day, a restaurant he might possibly go to in the near future.  Smiling, he opened the card to read:
“You’ve never gone all the way,” Harry finished for him.  Draco nodded, blushing even darker.  Harry bit down on his lip hard, the thought alone driving him mad with a sudden rush of lust.  Of course, he wanted Draco.  Now with this new information, and just the idea that he could be Draco’s first just about ruined him.  He crossed his legs awkwardly, hoping Draco wouldn’t notice just how excited he seemed to be from this.  Harry took a calming breath this time, before he asked, “Do you...um...want to...”
What was he doing?  Oh yeah.  He remembered.  He fumbled around in his pockets for his wand.  He waved it around the front of the door, trying not to fall over.  Thankfully the door still read his magical signature and opened up for him.  When he finally made his way to the top floor, he stumbled into the living room.  Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan were necking on the couch again, but Draco just shrugged, walking on past.  The sight of them together was nothing new, now.  If he kept around there much longer it’d just make him feel lonely and pathetic.
An hour later, they had met up and Pansy was leading him through the same path he’d taken earlier that day.  The park was lined with many benches, but this time the snow had melted.  They watched as Muggles slipped around in the slush, and Draco had never been more thankful for the charms on his boots.
“F-fine,” he croaked.  “Think I just need to lay down.  If you’ll excuse me.”  He made to stand, and Potter was instantly on his feet with him.
Draco Malfoy lived on the top floor of the Auror trainee dormitory.  The building itself was close in size to the manor, and each floor was arranged based on your rank in the program.  The lower levels were for the highest ranked officials, actual Aurors that preferred the dormitory, or any official involved in the training process.  As you moved up the floors, ranks diminished, till you reached the top to the rookies and recruits.
It started out as just the two of them, launching snowballs and chasing each other across the grounds.  Then Potter had overshot his throw and just so happened to hit Parvati Patil square in the chest as she was walking out of the dorm.  She wailed, and then her sister was crouching to the ground and rolling up her own ball to throw at them in retaliation.  Then it was two against two, and Potter and Draco had formed some sort of silent alliance and were playing against the girls.
They sat in silence for a few minutes as they dug into their lemon bars.  About halfway through with his, Draco set his fork down.  “Ugh, Pansy.  It’s not so much the smile.  It’s the fact that it's
He ran the perimeter of the park in no time, pleased to see the snow hadn’t faltered in any area of the park.  No doubt, in an hour or two the Muggle kids would come flocking to build snowmen.  Draco figured now would probably be wise to get back, before he’d be seen vanishing out of thin air.
But as Draco paused to admire a Christmas display at a small toy store, he wondered.  Perhaps there wasn’t something in the water—but rather in the air.  It was Christmastime after all.  Maybe his fellow dormmates were feeling the holiday spirit.  Maybe they wanted to put the past behind them, simply because it was something too painful to think about right now.  Christmas was about being happy and loved.  It had been such a long time for Draco to have felt either of those feelings.  Maybe the same could be said for the rest of the dorm.
In order to move further down, Harry’d had no choice but to get on his knees as well.  This brought that perfectly shaped arse right at eye level, and God what a treat that was.  Harry bit his left cheek, pleased with Malfoy’s yelp of surprise.  He rewarded him with a slap to the other cheek, which resulted in a quick intake of breath, his arse clenching and squeezing the plug tight.
“I just wanted to let you know, we agree with Dean and Seamus.  You shouldn’t have to hide in your room any more than the rest of us.”  She paused, her gaze turning thoughtful as she took in his appearance.  Draco was dressed in his typical running gear, his hair not even brushed.  He didn’t bother with putting himself together properly till after his run.  His hair would get frizzy mingled with the sweat and wind from outside.  There was no point to it, really.  But now with Padma looking at him full of concern, perhaps he should have tried at least a little bit.  “I don’t think Parvati or I have even seen you eat anything here.  Are you taking your meals to your room?”
All of a sudden Potter’s door burst open and music blared into the silence.  It was some muggle song, string instruments and a piano in the background while a man sang about chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.  Draco had no idea what that nonsense was about, but before he could even take time to comprehend it all, Potter was backing out of his door, hunched over and dragging a tree into the living room!
Then all of a sudden Harry swung at Draco, and it was so unexpected that Draco moved back, releasing his hold on his thigh.  With his leg free, Harry wrapped it quickly around Draco’s waist and turned them around.  He grappled for Draco’s hands, Draco squirming under him and making it almost impossible.  He kept trying to bring his legs up to kick Harry off of him and the only way for Harry to stop that was to lean his other leg over both of Draco’s.
He chuckled, shaking his head.  All Draco could do was stare on in shock, practically on the edge of his seat.  “No, well, not really.  I’m inviting her to come live with me.”
Snorting, Harry turned his head to look at the spot Draco had been in moments before.  To his surprise, there was a small red and sparkly thing on the mat.  He blinked, bringing into focus.  It was a tiny sequined heart shaped ornament.  “Hey Draco,” he chuckled, picking up the small heart.
He pulled his hand out from under Dean’s roughly, then crossed his arms across his chest.  Draco glared.  “What do you want, Thomas?”
Parvati leaned in, and began to whisper, “Yeah and what is even up with that?  Have you noticed Harry and Ron are hardly ever here?  They get in rather late on the nights they do stay here.  I think they are staying somewhere else for half the week.  I’d bet they are at Granger’s.”
Immediately they felt something else entirely from this new position, because now Harry’s groin had lined up with Draco’s.  Both of them flushed brilliantly, because how could they not notice how this struggle was affecting both of them.  The joggers concealed nothing, and Draco clenched his eyes shut as he felt Harry’s answering hardness against his own.  Merlin, all he’d need to do would be to buck his hips like so...
The Wizengamot couldn’t try him as an adult.  He had a brief sentence of house arrest and then was to report to a probation officer.  He was urged to finish his schooling and take his NEWTs, which came as no surprise to him when his results came back all Outstanding.  From his exam scores, he drew the attention of the Aurors and was urged to apply to the program.  Given his record it was a little unorthodox, however they seemed to think Draco possessed useful knowledge of what it was like on the other side.  With nothing left of the manor, no other job prospects (because who would want to hire him?), Draco had very little choice.
“Well, I know you two have already met,” He broke the silence.  “But, Draco, this woman right here has been resisting me every step of the way.  It’s driving me around the twist.  I wanted to take her here to show I’m serious about us.  She seems to think she's just like any other girl I bring home—but this is different.”
He didn’t know what compelled him to say what he said next, but the words came out of his mouth anyway.  “Why are you being nice to me all of a sudden, Potter?”  I mean, yes, he was curious about it all.  But a part of him didn’t want to ask, in case things started to revert back to unpleasantness.  He kind of enjoyed these quiet moments between them.
“What?  No, of course not!” He flushes, looking slightly to the left of her, his gaze focusing on her diamond earrings.  “It’s just something I’d rather not see first thing in the morning...”
His voice accomplished the desired effect.  Draco needed to leave now.  “Yeah, sure,” he practically squeaked, starting to pick up the pace for the door, even though his legs screamed.
The club is small with mostly everyone above 30. There are some people in their twenties as well. The lights are bright. Not dark in usual clubs and there's a girl singing on the stage wearing a cowboy hat. Draco and Harry wait at the door. The pub, not club, is relatively small. Suddenly there are people clapping and the host appears on the stage. She's a woman in her eaely 40s but extremely beautiful with tanned skin and brown long hair with bangs, wearing a beautiful red full length cocktail dress.
"Are you mad at me?" He asks in incredibly small voice, sounding so vulnerable. His voice is hoarse since extremely limited use.
Harry looks at little grass and his heart burns painfully. Her hair is all disheveled, her eyes bloodshot and puffy from crying. She hugs Ginny back. Draco definitely wasn't lying about the packing. She had got three trunks for two days stay. Harry mentally prepares himself for a longer stay. That means not much of naked Draco around the house. Shame. And this is definitely not something he should be thinking about given the circumstances.
"Leave quietly, Weasley. Trust me, one more word, anything towards Draco, I'll rip you apart piece by piece and force your body parts down your wife's throat.
Darien knows that if anyone finds out that he is with his employee, they will ask why. He knows it's because with this girl, he feels the happiness, the peace that he doesn't feel at home anymore. Whether at home or office, he is always irritated. His mind always overthinks but with Millicent, it's quiet. He feels like twenty again. Free and full of joy. And there's nothing wrong with being happy. Everyone is happy and nobody is getting hurt is what Darien feels, forgetting that someone is getting hurt. That someone is Draco.
Potter raised his eyebrows and narrowed his eyes. Draco just realised how Potter could look strict without narrowing his eyes. And now that he has seen Potter narrow his eyes, he wants them to go large again. He swallows.
They walked to the common room together. Belle held his arm and rested her head on his arm while walking. Blaise was really tall for her. As they entered the common room hand in hand, everyone smiled at them.
"She doesn't deserve to be respected if she's a housewife?" Draco asks. "Isn't your mother a housewife?"
"You can't say yes to anyone else from now then. You're all mine." Potter says and kisses his forehead.
Draco gives Iris a long, tight hug and she kissis Draco's forehead. Her heals enough to get her to Draco's height.
Draco can feel his cock twitch at the evil smirk Potter gives and oh fuck, he wants this. He wants to be used, wants to be made to do things and he wants the humiliation. He's had the romance for so long now that he craves the humiliation. He craves the disdain and the disrespect and the humiliation like he felt when Potter made him rut the tub like an animal. He can feel his face and neck burn off as the drool starts dripping down his tongue and runs through his chest and stomach.
Harry looks up to see the sweat dripping from Draco's temples, his ivory white skin flushed and pink and beautiful. Harry doesn't increase the speed, he dives back to suck on Draco's nipple, biting it gently and then increasing the pressure. Draco lets out a sob and arches his back up.
Harry smiles as he watches Draco complying, as Draco places his arms above his head as he holds on the headboard for support.
Malfoy fell asleep on Harry's bed last night after all the thorough teasing and Harry, too exhausted after two wanks, [fucking Malfoy who didn't even give him a chance to cool down] sighed and resigned himself to sleep on Malfoy's bed. The moment his head hit on the silk pillows and sheets, he groaned. Two things, this bed is way to comfortable than his, it smells like Malfoy. It smells like that citrus flowery thing that suddenly takes him back to sixth year when they were making amortentia. Fuck. That was Malfoy's conditioner. How come no one noticed that he used floral products? How come Harry noticed? But that's not all. He even smells vanilla which he knows Malfoy smells like. His expensive bath products and having Malfoy in his arms for those few seconds are proof enough. This is going to be a long night. Harry inhales all fragrance Malfoy and closes his eyes.
Its been a month since the war is over. I was sent in azkaban immediately along with my parents. I have no idea about Belle's well-being. The dementors come and all I can feel is the dread and horrid moments I was forced to live. Again and again like a broken record I've been seeing my worst memories, one of them was seeing Belle covered in blood. This is going to be my life now. Here, in this cell, alone.
"Harry make them stop. Why won't they stop? It hurts so much. They're so many of them. Make them stop please." Draco says weakly in between his sobs.
"This was Draco's diary. These diaries are how we communicated without getting caught. Theo had charmed them." Pansy explained.
"There are so many children. Then there are people our age as well. How do we fit so many people in the Room of Requirement?" She sat down and asked with a sad face.
Mr and Mrs Weasley, and the professors leave. Only we school children are left. We all spend the night together in the Manor.
Harry feels jealous. He hates Christian. Christian has had his Draco in his arms. He takes a deep breath to remind himself that it is him Draco belongs to. Not that guy.
Ginny and Theo had a good lunch and dessert. After roaming a little bit, they left for Hogwarts. As soon as they reached Hogwarts, they found out what happened. They went to meet Draco. Draco was asleep so Ginny left for her dorm. Theo turned to Harry.
"Then I'm going to kiss you now." Scorpius says and leans forward slowly, giving Rose a chance to back up. Rose grins as she closes the distance between them and their lips finally touch.
Harry could feel his blood boiling. How dare they? They had no right. None, whatsoever and Harry would enjoy teaching them a lesson. He was about to snap when he felt Draco's hand squeeze his hand tightly. He looked at him to see Draco staring right back at him, his expressions soft. He then turned to look at Kingsley.
An auror came at my cell to tell me I've been released. First I thought it was some kind of sick joke but then it turned out to be true. I, however was too weak to even stand. The auror helped me get on a wheelchair and pushed me out. Once out of the grounds of azkaban, what I saw was Potter. He helped me out of azkaban and led me to where a group of people were standing. There they were, my friends and my sister. For the first time in a month, I felt actual hope. They all were alive!
"Beautiful. You are truly and utterly beautiful when you submit yourself like this to me, pet." Draco can feel warmth spread in his whole body at Potter's praises.
Harry looks back at the beautiful white and blue mist of the dragon. The dragon walks towards Harry and sits at his feet with his head low. It reminds Harry of how beautifully Draco submits to him. How he kneels at Harry's feet and reads his novels while listening to music while Harry does his research. It reminds Harry of how he kneels at breakfast and let's Harry feed him. It reminds Harry of how Draco lets Harry take charge and listens like the good boy he is. He is Harry's most prized possession. And Harry feels like crying.
Harry grinned. Draco hasn't yet told Harry that he loves him. Not while completely being in his senses. While he knows what he's saying and is not in the foggy bliss of subspace. He doesn't need too. Draco makes no issues proving Harry that Harry is the only one for him. Harry pulled him closer and captured his lips in a long sensual kiss.
"Because of this." The prosecutor says and hands Draco some pictures as he levitates some pictures to the judge, specially called for today.
"Like it was brilliant. But forbidden. He's Harry Potter. He's always just been Potter for me but he's Harry Potter for the world. The world I helped ruin."
The seconds hand of the clock ticks by. The sound so loud in this ridiculous office. It's all beige and brown and white. The stupid couch is brown as well. Draco lays on the couch, wearing black trousers and dark grey shirt button upped. His sleeves rolled up that shows his mark all black and prominent. His hand is on his chest, interwined. He keeps tapping his right foot on the handle of the couch. He looks at the ridiculous posters with things like
"Can Hermione be there? She was saying she has some ideas for, uh, whatever you were doing down there."
"It felt good. It was so quiet, Harry. So quiet and my mind was all fuzzy and it was so good and fuzzy. It was good. And fuzzy." Draco sniffs.
Where are you, Draco? He never disappears without telling Harry where he is going. And he left at least a three hours ago. To get ice cream. Something isn't right. His phone is unavailable as well. Is he alright? Is he hurt? Has something happened- No! He's fine. Harry will find him. He's fine. Draco is fine. Harry feels a hand on his shoulder.
"I'm sure you don't." Blackburn replies chucking. "Well, Mr Potter, they are on to you. I suggest you refrain from your extra curricular activities for time being. And do not go after the aurors. They are waiting for you to slip. Right now they have no proof of your proclivity so you're better off now. But one slip and it's you who will face issues not them. And I'd suggest you start practicing lying through veritaserum."
"You're so overdramatic. It wouldn't have mattered if you didn't have money. I might not have hundreds of millions in my vaults but I am rich for the both of us." Potter says.
"Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter." He shakes our hand. "I'm here to talk about the will of Andromeda Black Tonks."
"That's a brilliant idea." I heard Pansy. "Although we should wait for Blaise. Where did he die anyways?"
"He loves you. So did Christian. And if what those people were talking about is right then a couple more men too." Harry said.
Draco feels the burn of tears in his eyes. He tries to blink them away but those stubnorn fuckers still flow. Silently, but they flow. Potter's hold on him tightens and he hugs him, holds him like Draco is a treasure to be cherished and a sob escapes Draco's throat. Potter walks him towards his bed, lays him down, lays besides him and makes Draco curl around him. Draco falls asleep listening to silent breaths of Harry Potter. The person Draco now belongs to.
Draco wakes up with a gasp. He looks around and sees that it's still dark outside. He looks to his right, still laying down and looks at Potter. Potter's hold on his torso is tight as if he's afraid that Draco might disappear again. Draco smiles. He snuggles up closer to Potter and holds his firm and strong biscep. He feels Potter kiss his head and hold him tighter.
"I was supposed to die anyway. And I never asked you to come. I specifically told you not to, time and again.  You came with me because you wanted to. You came because you were Harry Potter's so called best friend. Don't give me this bullshit, Ronald, just because you can't use my friendship anymore. I know the only reason you want me back in your life is because no one respects you two idiots who drove Britain's golden boy away." Harry replied furiously.
"Arry? There's a birthday on fifth June. Customer has asked our best dark chocolate cake along with anything lemon and raspberries. And they will pay for the bakery to be open for about four people at midnight. Shall I accept or reject it?" Eveta asked.
He can feel Draco's spent cock twitch in his fist. No doubt, the effect of his praises. Draco always was a sucker for praises. He looks at Draco, his mouth parted, revealing the knickers in his mouth and his cheeks flushed. His hair falling all over his face, he looks gorgeous, so Harry tells him so. The reaction can immediately be felt in his fist and Harry smiles. He increases the speed and Draco drops his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry can feel his fast breathing and the amout of power it takes Draco to not make a sound. Harry commends on it. The praises take their effect and soon Draco is fully erect.
"Sorry. I didn't know whether you would want me to stay or was I allowed to get up." He replies sheepishly.
Students started filling the hall. Some people stared at us, some at me, giving me looks of disgust. I sat there with breakfast in front of me. I didn't feel like eating. Since last year, my apatite was almost as good as non- existing.
Cormac waits outside his house as he hears loud noises from the inside. He had given his house to one of the executives in the company he was working for couple of hours. Those executives came along with their girlfriends, looking for a safe place to fuck where their wives won't find out. Cormac provided his flat in diagon to safely floo and leave when done. He cursed as he heard yet another moan. Hadn't these people heard of silencing charms? It was a wonder these idiots hadn't been caught yet.  After two hours of the noises, the couple finally left. Cormac was opening his door when he heard his neighbour's door open.
"My father, he didn't let me have a childhood. I wasn't allowed to do things children are supposed to do. And if I wanted to do, he would, he would beat me. As I grew up, my punishments started to get darker. I've been crucioed more times than the days I've lived. My life was, it was similar to Sirius Black. I would've run away if I had a place to go to. Running away to Blaise's or Pansy's or Theo's didn't make sense because their parents were the same. Honestly if I had someone like you had the Weasleys to go to, I would've left that house so long ago. Only if I knew about Andromeda, I would've run to her. Then maybe I wouldn't be forced to this dark mark. We would'vee been together so long ago." Draco explained.
Draco knew this could be troublesome for Potter. Last thing he wanted was his Master to get in trouble because of him. He immediately looked at Potter for permission. Potter gave him a nod, giving Draco free reign of what to say.
"Oh he's jealous. He would've given you more time if two other people weren't trying to persue you." Astoria replies.
She should be. Harry is an idiot. A huge idiot. He didn't even realised what he did and Draco listened to him. Without complaining. Harry took away that small freedom from him. Harry metally slaps himself for it. He has to be better at organising where Draco needs to be free and where held. He sits at the table and rubs his temple. This has already been a long day and it hasn't even started yet.
"Hera, there's a fish called pacific salmon. It travels all seven seas but comes back to where it was born when it's time to die. I've come back as well." Ralph says with a rueful smile.
"You just know the truth, Potter. You haven't seen it. Once you see it, you will agree with me." Draco says.
