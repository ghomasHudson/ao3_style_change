Harry mouths an apology and re-casts the spell to surround Malfoy’s chair too. I just sit there, frozen by the memory of Neville’s stag do. I thought we’d had an agreement, Harry and I, to pretend it never happened. I’ve certainly done everything I can to force it down, to act like I don’t remember the feeling of his jaw under my hand, his breath on my lips. I don’t understand why he even brought it up—usually I’m pretty good at that sort of thing, at making connections and puzzling out motivations, but my brain keeps getting stuck on the memory of the taste of
He was standing so close. Despite Draco’s very best efforts, his gaze fell to Potter’s mouth. He knew what those lips felt like against his. Two weeks and four days ago, he’d kissed them, desperately, sure it was his only chance. It had been better and worse than he could have ever imagined.
Harry would have liked to make Malfoy suffer a little longer, but he himself felt as if he would explode if he didn’t fuck Malfoy immediately. He withdrew his fingers – a moan from beneath him – and lined himself up.
“What?” Draco blinks at him, his fingers digging into Harry’s side. His pupils are wide, his mouth dark and swollen. “You’re not changing your mind, are you?”
“Kiss me,” he said, and it was that tone again – that imperious tone that Harry could never resist, even if it was a little quieter than usual, a little more strained around the edges.
Malfoy didn’t say anything. Slowly, he raised his hand. Harry watched, confused. Malfoy clicked his fingers.
“Please, Ron, you barely understand a word.” Hermione bustled over and arranged the tea and a plate of fresh scones on the table. “Molly’s,” she said at Harry’s interested look. “Help yourself. Weren’t you saying only yesterday that Malfoy must be a genius to have passed the Mind Healing exam?”
Without the need to nurture Harry after an invasive Legilimency session, Ron and Hermione shifted easily into lighter conversation. They took the trouble, every single time, to give Harry the backstory to each person they mentioned, each place, each tiny detail of their shared history. But Harry struggled to keep track of all the faceless names and found his attention drifting.
“Like you and me,” Harry says. His hand makes it to Draco’s bony shoulder. He pauses, then decides, fuck it, it doesn’t seem like they’re here for Exploding Snap, and dips his fingers under the collar of Draco’s pyjama top. He has to step closer to reach the back of Draco’s neck, but he does, because he’s been thinking about burying his hand in that soft hair ever since their first dance. Draco blinks slowly, heavily.
“We do,” Harry assured him, as if Malfoy hadn’t seen every single café, pub and restaurant Harry had been to over the last month. “This is the first time we’ve been here in weeks.” He grinned. “We really missed the rhubarb crumble.”
Every inch of Draco was alight. He was trembling, hyperaware of every movement of the bedsheets under him, of every slide of the hot skin of Harry’s legs against his arms, of the slowly softening pressure around his fingers.
. Was that the new ice-cold magic that thrummed in Harry’s veins, wanting to reunite with its true owner? Or was it something else?
I still can’t look at him, but now it’s because the relief in me feels so huge that it might, if I let it, prickle against the backs of my eyes in an attempt to escape. Instead of thinking about how it’ll probably hurt even more in the harsh light of morning, I exhale shakily and ease myself down until my head hits the pillow. Draco makes a low noise of satisfaction and shuffles closer, pressing his front against my side. Harry tucks himself behind and reaches over, twining his fingers with Draco’s on my stomach.
I release his wrists, drop my head to his nipple and finally take it into my mouth. The silver ball of his piercing is sharply metallic, warm from the heat of his skin. He groans and pushes his chest upwards, digs his hands into my hair.
Harry was so thrown by Malfoy’s comment and the wicked look on his face that he almost let Malfoy’s first spell hit him; he threw up a Shield Charm at the very last second. Malfoy pouted at Harry’s save – and then they were duelling.
Potter shrugged. “I didn’t know whether you’d be going back to school in September. I’ll see you there, I suppose, if you are.”
Harry tightened his grip on Malfoy’s jaw and attacked him, teeth and tongue and lips biting and licking and kissing. Malfoy – who had been so calm and still while Harry was questioning him – burst into life, the book landing on the floorboards with a
Harry nodded, though truthfully he wasn’t sure. Malfoy’s ready acceptance of Harry’s apology had been so unexpected that Harry felt out of sorts. He was sure there had been something else he’d wanted to say, something he’d wanted to ask, but in the face of Malfoy’s acquiescence (and his easy flushes), it had quite gone from his mind.
“A month?” Harry spun in his chair so he could glare incredulously at Malfoy properly. “We don’t need a
“I’ve never – I didn’t know I knew that.” Harry raked his eyes over Malfoy appraisingly. “That’s the first thing that I – I dunno, does that count as remembering? None of the other Healers have ever…”
Harry is unperturbed by what I’m sure is a very stupid expression on my idiot face. “Listen,” he demands suddenly. “Am I the odd one for not being in the mood sometimes? I mean—he’s
“Sure,” I say, like it’s no big deal, like any member of the past ten generations of Malfoys and Weasleys wouldn’t writhe in horror if they knew what was happening. “Draco. Are you going to boss us around all evening while you just watch, all buttoned up?”
A large Christmas tree stood in the corner of the room. It was decorated sparsely but handsomely, with delicate silver ornaments that looked like they would shatter if Harry so much as touched one. Carefully, Harry put his gift amongst the pile of presents that were arranged beneath it.
Potter drops his hands and blinks owlishly at Draco. “Oh,” he says. “From the spells on the door, I assumed you were–” He sounds disappointed. It’s a nice touch. “I just need to get Hermione’s book.”
“There you go,” she said. “Good as new.” She paused, then smiled mischievously. “You do look very handsome, you know. The robes suit you.”
Harry’s every nerve is on fire. He’s alight, burning with how good it feels. Draco’s cock is sliding against him and their hands are wrapped around each other, fingers twined, hips thrusting, sweat beading, and Draco looks fucking gorgeous, painted gold from candlelight and silver from moonlight and pink from desire and—
Harry blinked. He didn’t expect his urge to know more about Draco Malfoy, the Death Eater turned Mind Healer, to be fulfilled so soon. He nodded quickly and shifted in his chair to pull out his wand.
Malfoy studied him, his head cocked. “Maybe it will be easier to identify the feeling if you are fully immersed,” he said eventually, in tones that suggested he was about to say something he thought he’d regret. “Do you know Legilimency?”
It’s a mess. Blood winds deep red tracks over pale skin, collecting in thick droplets on the underside of his arm. One of the droplets swells. Falls. Harry whimpers.
Malfoy’s only reply was a heated look. They gazed at each other for a long, tense moment, their breathing loud against the stillness. Then the moment snapped, and they fell on one another like animals.
God, had he only managed to waste five minutes? Harry gazed at his desk in despair. It was the tidiest it had been all year. “I suppose we should go then,” he said unhappily.
Hermione paused in smoothing down the fabric that Harry had just tweaked. “Malfoy chose them? That’s interesting.”
He wouldn’t get to pick someone. He wouldn’t get to propose. He wouldn’t get to plan a perfect future with his favourite person. He’d just have…Malfoy.
The solution came to him on a trip to an antique bookshop. (Draco’s suggestion—followed by a disdainful, “Since there’s nothing better to do,” to disguise his eagerness.)
The bedroom was too confusing. Jumbled memories clamoured for his attention. Harry knew that some of them were fantasies – they had to be, surely – but it was impossible to tell what was real and what wasn’t. Hanging over the lot of them was a haze of – was that … tea? His pounding head throbbed, and at two in the morning, Harry dragged his duvet and pillow to the spare room on the second floor, where he’d stayed with Ron during fifth year. The room was clean, tidy and clearly unused. It was a comfort. Harry was asleep within minutes.
close to cursing her nose right off her face. Merlin knows what was setting her off—you didn’t put much effort into sentimentality, did you? Though I don’t blame you, Draco—I wouldn’t be able to think of anything nice to say about Potter, either. No offence.”
“You’re so hot, Potter.” It’s so liberating to say it aloud. It’s so fucking painful. “You bastard. You stupid, untouchable bastard. You’re so hot.”
The roar in his ears fades gradually. Fingers of pleasure cling to him long after the world has sharpened into focus.
The thought strengthened him, and he managed a rueful smile when Hermione stepped back, her gaze raking critically over him.
He realised his mistake as soon as he was on the station concourse, squinting at the large map of the London Underground that hung on the wall.
“A shooting–?” Harry rubbed at his forehead. It was a gesture he couldn’t remember having done before, but it felt familiar in the muscles of his arm, in the smooth ridge of the lightning-bolt scar against the heel of his hand. From the look on Malfoy’s face, it was something he used to do a lot.
“One sec.” Harry closed his eyes and checked that his mental doors were still locked tight. They didn’t budge. “Okay,” he said, meeting Malfoy’s gaze. “I’m ready.”
Harry wouldn’t put it past Draco to, even now, be calculating. Wouldn’t be surprised if his brilliant brain was still trying to gain the upper hand, trying to figure out the exact things to say to drive Harry wild. But he couldn’t have known the effect that
The rolling waves crested and hot, white, blinding pleasure overwhelmed him. Harry came with a shout, his grip tight and his hips pumping and come shooting over his stomach, his chest, his face. It went on and on, convulsion after convulsion, until eventually Harry was left messy and empty and utterly, utterly confused.
I thrust upwards again helplessly. His arse slaps against my hips. It’s a filthy sound and I immediately want to hear it again, so I shift my feet and fuck him as best I can—though my range of movement is limited by the two full-grown wizards I have on top of me. What a problem to have.
“But–” They’d never exchanged presents before. Harry had nearly bought Draco about twenty different things over the last month but had stopped himself – presents weren’t something they
Harry shook himself. “Not really,” he said, still staring at the backs of the retreating group. “She was right, I don’t remember a thing about her.”
But Harry waves me away. “That’s not it,” he says. “I just mean— I’m surprised to hear you say it. That he’s pretty.”
“Why did it take so much convincing?” Hermione sounded just as doubtful as Harry was. “That’s hardly encouraging.”
Malfoy looked backwards and shook his head. “No,” he said. “Take tomorrow to rest. We’ve been working too hard. I’ll see you on Monday.”
Potter twists around to look. His eyes are bright and unfocused, but even now, even in a fantasy, Draco feels inadequate under his gaze.
“Yes,” Malfoy breathed, brushing his nose against Harry’s. “Anything you want. I’ll do anything you want.” He grabbed Harry’s jaw and kissed him again, devouring him, rolling his hips all the while, sending waves of pleasure shuddering through Harry. Harry had to grip the desk to keep himself upright.
Malfoy gazed at him, open-mouthed. “Could—” He swallowed. A flush threatened the flawlessness of his fine throat. “Could anyone else confirm your presence in Southend-on-Sea that day?”
“No.” Malfoy’s tone was cold, heavy with finality. “If you’re going to continue to insist then I suggest you leave.”
The rest of Malfoy’s sentence was lost to a curse and a moan. Harry took up a punishing rhythm, able to go so much harder and deeper now he was no longer working against the weight of Malfoy on top of him. And god, Malfoy felt so good. It wasn’t just the heat and tightness of his arse, but the way his hands scrambled for purchase on Harry’s biceps, the way he threw his head back and arched his neck, the absolutely indecent noises he made. It was the way his hair was a mess, unlike Harry had ever seen it, the way he lifted his hips to meet Harry’s thrusts, the sight of his cock, long and hard and red against his stomach.
“Fifth year.” Malfoy’s voice again came disconcertingly from inside Harry’s head. Or should that be inside Malfoy’s head? “This was the last match we played against each other. You got banned for life after this,” he added fondly.
His Shield Charms went next. He didn’t make the connection to the misbehaving Summoning Spells. He didn’t even realise—actually felt a stab of pride whenever it happened, assuming his students had improved under his tutelage. He even awarded twenty house points to the ever-anxious Aoife O’Neill when her ordinarily shaky Stunning Spell knocked him out cold in the middle of a lesson.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “It might surprise you to learn that I am actually fairly well-respected within this field, Potter,” he said with unexpected venom. “There are several other things I could be occupying myself with if you consider my services beneath you.”
Harry closed his eyes as the magic slid over him. It was a strange sensation, his own magic rising around him as if responding to a threat. It prickled uncomfortably against his skin, and he fought to keep his hands from clenching into fists.
“But I can only remember five and a half months,” Harry countered. “So, percentage-wise, that’s a good chunk.”
“Not yet,” Draco said, shifting again, settling himself. “I want to enjoy this first. God, you feel good.”
Draco whimpered and ground down onto Harry’s dick. “The things you say.” His voice was high, strained. Reverent.
“Fuck, sorry,” Harry said. The Leaky Cauldron vanished and Harry saw Malfoy across the desk, his eyebrows pulled together in concentration, before they were back in the Garden.
The world tilted again. Harry gripped the arms of his chair, suddenly worried he would fall out. “Fuck.”
Draco’s heartbeat thudded in his ears. If he said no, they could go back downstairs and end the evening with a cup of tea and a polite chat. They could discuss whatever was between them like adults, they could shake hands, and Draco could go home and get himself off with his nose buried in the collar of his robes, searching for a lingering trace of the scent of Harry’s pillow.
The white walls of the high-ceilinged room blurred into browns and blues; they were in Malfoy’s office. For a moment, Harry couldn’t identify why it looked peculiar. Then he realised: he was used to seeing it in the bright morning light. The room before him glowed with the oranges and reds of sunset.
Draco remembered this day, now. It had been a particularly good session, but Agatha had been shaken by it (the best sessions usually had that effect). He also remembered that he hadn’t felt comfortable giving her back to her father when her bottom lip was still protruding and her eyes were wide and watery, so he’d—oh, bloody hell—crouched down and transfigured his nose into a—
Harry made a noise of disbelief and reached into his pocket for his wand. He realised too late that he must have left it at home.
“Well, we were at the seaside, so we had to eat some fresh flash-fried thick fish and chips. Then we caught some clean clams and crammed them into some clean cream cans. And then…” He fought to keep the smile off his face. “When we walked back to the Apparition Point, there was a shrill shrieking sound coming from a side passage, so we investigated.”
. He should have taken one look at Draco and laughed, thrown some robes at him and left. Instead he’d stared, rooted to the spot, probably drooling. He pressed his hands to his cheeks, trying to cool them. “Where’s this present, then? Under the tree? Tell me which one, I can just pick it up and go. Leave you to – you know.”
of Harry’s heart sounded different inside his own head. It was now, undeniably, distinct from his actual heartbeat, which had begun to calm immediately after their minds had connected.
“You said that you’d thought about this,” he said instead, addressing the pantry door. “Us. Before you lost your memory.”
“See that you do, see that you do!” And, bundling several rolls of parchment haphazardly under her arm, Brisley wiggled her fingers at them and left.
“Years of practice,” Malfoy said. “But to begin with, to achieve this level of detail, you need to pick something you’ve spent a lot of time with and know well. A room in your house, perhaps. A memory of yourself reading your favourite book or …
The orange-pink of the twilight sky lit up the small, sharp curve of Malfoy’s smile. His gaze dropped downwards, then back up again. A door slammed somewhere in the distance.
“I …” The taught line of Malfoy’s shoulders softened minutely. “I suppose I could move some things around,” he said slowly. “Is this a business meeting?”
Malfoy swallowed again, Adam’s apple moving against Harry’s little fingertip. “Are we roleplaying?” He looked up at Harry through heavy lashes. “Have I done something very bad, Auror Potter? Do I need to be punished?”
“Haven’t noticed what?” Harry pulled himself upright. The cold metal bars of the headboard dug into his back. “Hermione, what is it?”
. His muscles scream with the effort of keeping still, but stupid, suicidal Malfoy presses closer, licks at Harry’s lips, and Harry is powerless against the warmth of him, the wet of him, the
It’s the maddest thing that’s ever happened to me—and before the age of fifteen, I’d been knocked out by a giant chess piece, had my pet rat transform into the person who murdered my best mate’s dad, and had been consensually kidnapped by mermaids.
“Let me–” Potter says. He tugs at Draco’s shoulders, pulling him upwards. “God, you’re amazing, that was amazing, let me–”
But despite Harry’s attempts to get lost in the concrete maze of the city streets, his feet invariably took him to Charing Cross Road and the Muggle entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. The barman always welcomed him with a smile and ushered him to the booth Harry used to share with Ron and Hermione. Harry always ordered a drink and nursed it until closing time, practising his mental exercises for lack of anything better to do.
Draco shivered. “Yeah,” he managed to say. “You would have put the entire hospital at risk, you brute.”
“Please what?” He twisted his hand again, curled his fingers, and Harry let out a hoarse stream of curses.
For all Harry’s inexperience, it wasn’t long before Malfoy’s moans rose in pitch and his hips began to jerk. Harry lifted his head and wrapped a vice-like hand around Malfoy’s dick.
“Why did you decide that after dark on a Wednesday was the right time to show up? It’s an odd time to pay a visit to someone you hadn’t seen in years.”
“You’re a little shit,” Harry told him just the same, and Malfoy’s smirk grew. That is, until Harry pointed his wand at Malfoy’s chest. “
Harry let the parchment fall to the table. Other members of the Auror department? What the hell? Who? Was this a regular thing for Malfoy? Was he working through an alphabetical list of Aurors he could con into bed and had just now made it down to “P”? Was grumpy old Proudfoot pencilled in for next week?
“Shut up,” Harry said, and kissed him again, affectionately, with playful little lip-bites and gentle bumping of noses. “You did this,” he murmured, rubbing his nose against Draco’s, “when you kissed me in your office. Do you have any idea what you did to me?”
And then there’s Draco. His left arm lies across me, the edge of his burn scar just visible. I don’t know why it affects me so much—evidence that he is actually made from flesh, not marble, maybe. Evidence that he has emotions, guilt, a whole history I don’t know about. I want to find out what else I assumed about him is wrong.
“I can’t,” Malfoy glanced at the clock on the wall. “I have another patient, they’ll be here soon. It’s too late to cancel.” He grimaced. “But I’ll try to rearrange when they arrive. I’ll come and find you as soon as I’m done.”
Happily, Malfoy seemed similarly affected; he shifted in his chair and almost dropped his wand when he fumbled it out of his pocket. The fact that Harry had reduced Malfoy’s customary grace to clumsiness sent another wave of pleasure swooping through him. He clenched his fists. He’d said he’d let it go. For now, he’d said he’d let it go.
The elf narrowed its huge, pale eyes. “Is Master once again insulting the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black by attempting to sever the sacred connection of house-elves to this honourable residence?”
Part of Harry knew he was being unreasonable, but he couldn’t stop. His face was hot, his skin prickling uncomfortably. He had been so sure that Malfoy had been a minor character in the story of the War, a side note, his inclusion barely more than a technicality. He had been so sure that Ron had been lying.
Unexpectedly, the frown melted from Malfoy’s face, revealing a soft, almost awed expression that Harry couldn’t interpret.
“Please, I want–” He spreads his legs wider, offers himself up. Draco throbs at the sight and feels himself slipping, his grip on reality shaken by this awful, brilliant, devastating charm.
His stomach clenches on every dip of my head. His nails dig into my shoulder. He keeps saying my name in that tight, strained way. It’s all an incredible fucking turn-on and I’m glad nobody’s touching my cock right now; I’ve nearly ended this too soon already.
Harry stabbed at his pie. “I mean, I know that sort of thing isn’t a priority right now. But it would’ve been nice to know.” He thought about Malfoy’s long ink-stained fingers running slowly over the spines of books on a dusty bookshelf. The curly-haired Muggle leaning against the wall of the Chelsea Physic Garden. The hint of promise in the dark-eyed stranger’s smile.
“Tell me which other Aurors you fucked.” Harry leaned forwards, pressing Malfoy almost in half as he pushed his cock deep inside him.
“Harry,” I gasp, wrenching myself away and turning to find him, needing to see him. “Do you wanna join in?”
“Yes.” Harry was aching for it. Every grip of Draco’s hole around his fingers sent a throb through him, through his cock. “Yes, I will, I want to. God, Draco – Come here, let me – Can you get up? On your knees?”
Harry’s awed voice drifts over from somewhere near my feet. “This is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen. Draco, your arse is— Ron, your
“We did talk about it a bit. When I was really young,” Draco said eventually. “She loved her wedding day, you know. She’d get the photographs out all the time. Said it was the best day of her life.” He swallowed, his voice going funny. “She said she couldn’t wait for me to have the same happiness. A big, grand wedding day, with lots of flowers and food and music and hundreds of guests to be impressed by me.”
“No, it’s nothing to do with…” Harry had never seen Malfoy look so deeply uncomfortable. “But you shouldn’t – Really, Weasley is just speaking from his own experience. It’s not something you should be angry with him about.”
Ron gaped. With his mouth open and his ears as red as they were, he looked like a fish with bright red fins. “And you’re all right with that?” he demanded.
“The potency of a person’s magic can be measured, like your heart rate, or oxygen level, or anything else. And yours is dangerously low, Harry.
The doorbell clanged and Harry jerked so violently he almost fell off his chair. He lifted bleary eyes to the clock on the mantelpiece. Who on earth would be at his door at this time of day? Didn’t they know he had work to do?
Usually I love the wordcount restrictions of drabbles but I was desperate for like 20 extra words on this one. D: Written for the January 2021 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge.
. God, he was close. In his mind, Malfoy leaned against the wall of the Leaky Cauldron next to him after their fight with Ron. In his mind, Malfoy dropped to his knees, right there in the alley, yanked open Harry’s robes and sucked his cock to the root. Harry imagined what it would be like to bury his hand in Malfoy’s hair. He imagined Malfoy looking up, his gaze locking with Harry’s. He imagined how it would feel if Malfoy cast
“I’ve never seen you hard,” he says. His eyes still have that same dark look, the colour of his irises vibrant against his swollen pupils. Seeing my dick and his face next to each other does something extremely funny and not unpleasant to my insides.
On those rare occasions, Harry would allow himself to daydream. He’d fantasise that if Draco had gone from hating Harry to maybe-liking him, there was a chance that one day – at some distant point in the future – Draco might feel more. That he might, one day, feel towards Harry a fraction of the affection that Harry felt towards him. He might even – maybe, potentially, hypothetically – let Harry kiss him, perhaps in the boozy haze of after-work drinks, or on a sleepy stakeout, or after they’d solved a case, the two of them drawn together by the thrill of victory.
Malfoy’s eyes were wide and desperate. “I – my parents, they disowned me. I’m here alone, there’s nobody I can – I thought…” He raked a hand through his hair. “You’re so…so
Malfoy didn’t look up as Harry walked over. Harry stood at the bar beside him, allowed himself three seconds to study Malfoy’s face at a closer-than-usual range, then said, “Hey.”
“You know, you never used to like Earl Grey,” Hermione said conversationally while she arranged teapots, mugs and strainers. “So interesting – I wonder if it’s related to the memory loss? Or perhaps something to do with a lack of awareness of your own habits leading you to try things you’d ordinarily avoid? I’d love to know more about it. Do you suppose there’s research on that sort of thing?”
Draco hums, his voice still low and scratchy with sleep, and Harry clutches one of the sofa cushions. He’s not going to touch himself. He’s not going to look at Draco’s erection again and he’s not going to touch his cock while Draco is
Baby's first attempt to write something creepy instead of dry banter and vaguely dubious sexiness. Done for the October 2020 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge.
Harry’s free hand shot down to grab the base of his dick, holding back the orgasm that threatened to overwhelm him at the words, at the roughness of Malfoy’s voice. Malfoy’s eyes followed the movement. His mouth dropped open. “Are you – shit, Potter, are you close already?”
He wipes his mouth and gets shakily to his feet. He’s unsteady. He really should take a minute to catch his breath, but he doesn’t have a minute. Or rather, he only has eighteen of them.
“Shit.” Draco grabbed sightlessly at Harry’s sides, withdrew, and pushed slowly back in. He had a brief moment of clarity and checked for any discomfort in Harry’s mind—but Harry truly wanted this, wanted
“Please,” Malfoy said in a low voice. “I don’t want to be alone. I’ll make it worth your while.” From the look on his face, there could be no doubt about what he meant.
It wasn’t an issue at first. After their impromptu heart-to-heart in the Hampton Court Starbucks, they were as polite as possible to one another for six tense days. Perhaps they should have known it wouldn’t last; on the seventh day, they had an explosive argument. Insults were exchanged. Hexes were cast. Several Black heirlooms were destroyed. All in all, it wasn’t what Harry pictured when he thought of the word “honeymoon”.
In the quiet, horrified aftermath, we both turn our attention back to the bar. Hermione and Parkinson have left—and, excuse me, where have they gone? I can’t see them sitting down anywhere—and have been replaced by George and Angelina. Malfoy finally seems to have decided on a drink; he’s tapping his fingers impatiently on the bar while the bartender waves her wand over a cocktail shaker, setting it in motion.
Malfoy sneered and opened his mouth, then closed it again abruptly. He took a deep breath and laced his fingers together. “I understand that it must be disappointing not to have the answers you’re looking for,” he said. “But what happened to you may be irrelevant.”
Harry remembered Ron’s outrage when he heard Malfoy’s name. He remembered Hermione and Malfoy’s incredulity when he’d asked if the two of them had been a couple. A new possibility occurred to him.
The evening after their second meeting, Draco had made a concentrated effort to bury his memories of Potter behind the locked doors of his mind. He made himself pretend he’d never met that scruffy medical mystery before that Friday in Brisley’s office.
The evening passes in the usual blur of noise. Midnight finds Draco lingering by the Floo, helping stumbling colleagues through the flames.
“You’ve improved so much since we started,” Malfoy said, and the strained edge to Malfoy’s voice made Harry shiver again. “Keep focusing on the noise for me. Then describe what you can see in your mind’s space.”
Malfoy followed him to the parlour, which Harry never used and therefore was free of stray files, though not free of a telltale layer of dust. He summoned a bag of gold and wordlessly held it out alongside the pot of Floo powder. But Malfoy hesitated.
things like – Show me. I want to see.” Harry reached a hand across the table. It was the second time he had demanded to see Malfoy’s thoughts. He had been refused last time. “Please. Draco. Please.”
Malfoy’s only response to Harry’s noisy entrance was a raised eyebrow. Harry muttered a greeting and slumped into the waiting wingback chair. Malfoy continued to write in his stupid notebook for what Harry considered to be an obnoxiously long time.
Draco stares, taken aback by the performance. He expected an immediate seduction. He expected Potter to appear shirtless and dark-eyed and wanting, leaning over Draco and murmuring praise into his ear. That’s the main scenario that has preoccupied his regular, not-from-a-box fantasies – the curtains around his bed sealed tight, his cock straining in his fist, his lip bitten so hard against his whimpers that he can taste blood.
It took four days to track down Malfoy. They found him in a Muggle village in rural Wales, quite by accident—Mr Griffiths, the husband of a Muggle-born Auror, was visiting his sister-in-law and saw Malfoy frowning at a carton of milk in the corner shop. Mr Griffiths had a startled moment of recognition, then skirted around Malfoy to get to the pet food shelf. He happened to mention the encounter to his wife during a Floo call that evening, in between complaining about the rain and holding up his sister-in-law’s new puppy (which, Mr Griffiths later told Harry earnestly, had the cutest little face he’d ever seen).
“Imagine that,” Harry said drily. “Would that be at the usual rate? I heard you mention the sum of fifty Galleons.”
There’s a long silence. I assume they’re doing that couple thing where they communicate entirely in facial expressions. I don’t know for certain, because I keep my eyes firmly shut.
Harry doesn’t know how to deal with the fact that Malfoy went upstairs from the tavern not to drink a Blood-Replenishing Potion, but to prepare his arsehole for Harry to fuck. So he doesn’t try to deal with it. Instead, he pulls Malfoy upright, so Malfoy’s warm back is flush against Harry’s chest. Malfoy’s head falls onto Harry’s shoulder, baring the long line of his neck. Harry tightens his grip.
“I’ve never lost control around you.” Harry wraps a hand around Malfoy’s dick to stop himself sinking his teeth into it. He pumps up and down, firmly, slowly. “Not since the first time.”
“You don’t have to,” Harry said quickly. “But it’s just—fuck, you feel so good, in my head. The thought of you inside me, in every way…” He shivered.
Never one to be shy, Harry reached down between their bodies and squeezed. Malfoy’s hand in Harry’s hair tightened, and he made a whimpering noise in the back of his throat. God, the sounds he made. Harry ran his fingers along the shape of Malfoy’s cock under his robes, feeling the length and heat of it, then abruptly sat back.
This time, Harry barely needed to think about it. “No,” he said dully. “All I do is go to St Mungo’s and the Leaky Cauldron.”
, and really, he’d been paid to work with Harry, he didn’t deserve any kind of thanks or reward—but Harry didn’t wait for permission; he slid his hand over Draco’s stomach, wrapped his fingers around Draco’s cock and started to stroke him with smooth, confident strokes.
“Hello,” I say warily. It occurs to me that, while I don’t regret agreeing to this, the same might not be said for the two of them. They’re looking awfully serious.
It’s a risky remark, but it pays off when Harry smirks and glances appreciatively at my dick. I resist the urge to preen.
There’s no chance to complain—Draco is already climbing on top of him, straddling him, his cock a tantalising bulge in the front of his pyjamas. Harry can’t look away. He itches to touch it, to feel the heat and weight of it—then he realises that he can, and promptly presses his hand against it.
“Is that so.” Malfoy’s voice was low, velvety. Harry licked his lips. Malfoy’s tongue slid out to mimic him.
Harry slid his thumb into the gap between a ribbon and the dip of Draco’s hipbone. “Can I…?” He moved his hand lower. His chest was a knot of anticipation.
“So,” Malfoy said eventually, carefully blotting the ink on the page. “Are you ready to get started?”
“I mean it.” Harry curled his fingers under a ribbon on Draco’s hip and pulled it tight. “I’d do anything for you. I would.”
“Because it would be the best thing to ever happen to me,” Harry said bluntly. “I couldn’t go back to not having you.” He grimaced. “I understand if this changes things. I tried not to let it get in the way of – Anyway. I’m sorry.”
Brisley was satisfied with his progress and sent him away with a smile and a reaffirmed instruction to put his feet up for the next few days. As Harry and Hermione stood to leave, the cuckoo clock burst out to shriek that it had just turned ten o’clock. Harry resisted the urge to hex it straight off the wall.
soar through him. Harry bucks his hips helplessly. His sweaty hands scramble for purchase on Draco’s waist—but the contact makes things worse. Sparks ignite along his arm, flare on his chest where Draco’s fingers are clenched, explode from his hips, his thighs, his
The door slammed open. Malfoy appeared, wild-eyed, panting. “Sorry, sorry! Is he – Harry? Are you–?”
– and Harry keeps taking, keeps moving his hand, keeps pounding into him. His bloodlust and his human lust are one giant, swirling entity, dragging him to the edge, closer and closer and–
Malfoy kept his gaze locked on Harry’s as he waved his wand. The nightingale disappeared. Harry exhaled.
.” I bite hard on my knuckle to stop myself from shouting the place down. God knows what I’d even say—I’ve been knocked absolutely senseless by the feeling of Malfoy’s mouth sliding all the way down, down, down to the base of my dick, his tight throat swallowing effortlessly around me.
“While I’ve got you here…” he’d sneered, looming above a paralysed Harry in a deserted train carriage and stamping hard on his face.
My heart is pounding at double speed. This is mad. It’s mad, but I know for a fact I’d regret it forever if I said no. I’d be thinking about it for the rest of my life. I’d probably corner them in a few months’ time and beg them to ask again, and that would be awkward for everyone. So I nod, and say, “Yeah. Okay. Why not? If you’re sure. I don’t want to make anything weird. For you two, I mean.”
Slowly – so, so slowly – Draco sank down. Harry bit his lip against the aching heat and tightness. It felt like his whole body, not just his cock, was being enveloped by Draco. Harry wanted it. Welcomed it. He’d already been consumed by Draco, already belonged to him. It felt so
“I…” What was Draco supposed to say to that? He shouldn’t have done it. He should have shut it down immediately. He shouldn’t have even gone back to the Leaky Cauldron once he knew Harry spent time there. “I was going to pay,” he said lamely.
“Give me that,” Draco snaps. He’s not going to be impressed by wandless magic when it’s not even real. He snatches his wand and casts the
He Apparated from St Mungo’s to the Burrow, thrilled that, for the first time in months, he’d be spending longer than twenty-four hours away from the hospital. Mrs Weasley was overjoyed to see him, and Harry spent a wonderful afternoon pottering around the Burrow and chatting, her sympathetic questions startling truthful answers out of him. When he left, she hugged him tightly and made him promise not to leave it so long until his next visit, because she would still love him even if he had no idea who she was.
“What is that supposed to mean?” Harry snapped. Parvati rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to respond, but Malfoy held up a hand.
Together, they stroke clumsily, fingers tangling and knuckles bumping against skin and fabric. They’re both still wearing trousers, their balls squashed high and tight by their hastily-shoved-down waistbands—but the uncomfortable pressure of elastic against his bollocks does nothing to dampen the euphoria of Draco’s hands on his skin, of Draco’s cock surging against his, of the pre-come sliding between them, of the way the clean, refined scent of Draco has sharpened into the bittersweet tang of sweat and sex.
.” He shoves Harry, palms against the bunched-up fabric of his T-shirt. Harry lands on the mattress with a bounce and a soft thump.
. It’s not like it’s going to be a real wedding, is it? We just need to sign a bit of paper and move on with our— What— What’s it doing?”
“Nothing!” Hermione said quickly. “Nothing at all. I think I might try the rarebit today. What are you going to have, Harry?”
Harry pauses when he’s all the way inside. Our bollocks are touching, our cocks clamped together inside Draco’s tight, clenching heat. I squeeze my eyes shut and force myself to take three slow, deep breaths. Harry murmurs comfortingly in Draco’s ear.
. “I … Thank you for telling me,” he said sincerely. “Really. It means a lot. I’m so glad things are better for you now.”
Draco snorted. It was much more familiar than the soft snicker. Harry abruptly remembered who he was standing next to.
.” He wanted to argue the point, but nothing that came out of his mouth was making sense. “I don’t know how to deal with this. You’re the only person I…” He exhaled and took off his glasses. He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes. “God. There’s nothing I could say that would make you change your mind?”
The sensation of Malfoy’s consciousness spilling into Harry’s mind was by now so pleasant that Harry struggled to stop his eyes from fluttering closed again when Malfoy’s mind met his.
When I can’t pretend my glass is anything but empty, I ask, with forced casualness, “What about Neville’s stag do?”
“Anyway, thanks again, Mr Potter. I’ll let you get on.” She gave a little wave and dashed off to join her friends, who had been waiting for her. One of them put their arm around her waist. She looked back at Harry and grinned.
“I, ah.” Healer Brisley seemed similarly wrong-footed by the curt interaction, but regained her cheeriness almost immediately. “Lovely!” she said. Her flyaway grey hair quivered with the force of her excitement. “So! As my wonderful clock so kindly reminded me, I have a few teensy errands to run. If you don’t mind, I’ll leave you to get to know one another and discuss next steps. Do give me a shout if you need me! Ms Granger, Mr Malfoy, I assume one of you can send a Patronus?”
Harry wondered what he was writing. ‘Harry Potter is an idiot’? ‘Patient 734 shows remarkable lack of any kind of mental function, not just memory’? He squinted at the page – then looked away guiltily when Malfoy glanced up at him. He tried to distract himself from the prickles of shame that crept up his spine. The shattered window and the burn on the wall from the duel yesterday had both been fixed, he noticed. Sunlight fell, buttery and warm, onto the dark wood of Malfoy’s desk.
He valiantly tried to gather himself together through this unanticipated haze of lust. He knew he shouldn’t be doing this. A fresh surge of guilt shot through him. What was he doing? Why hadn’t he just said no to this?
He picked the letter off his stomach. His first thought was work, but the parchment wasn’t Ministry standard. His second was Ginny, but his full name and address were written neatly on the envelope – not really her style.
. Each angle of him is sharp, like he’s chiselled out of marble rather than made from flesh—but it adds an element of risk that I can definitely understand the appeal of. He’s cold and dangerous. He’d fall apart beautifully.
,” Potter hisses, and Draco is pulled towards him, has his dick in his hand and is pushing himself into Potter’s tight heat before he knows what’s happening.
.” Draco’s voice—but Draco didn’t realise he’d said anything; he heard it through Harry, through Harry’s appreciation for the way he sounded, his control fraying, his vowels sharp and his consonants messy.
Harry strode across the kitchen until they were standing toe-to-toe. Draco’s eyes were wide, almost scared, but he didn’t flinch at Harry’s proximity.
Draco is still pinned under me, but Harry seems to decide I’m not a threat. He exhales. Pulls his hand from under the pillow. Touches my arm.
“Yes, yes.” Malfoy shifted on the bed so that Harry was pressed firmly between Malfoy’s legs, Malfoy’s foot hooking around the back of him and pulling him downwards. Harry moved his hips to push his aching cock against Malfoy’s answering hardness. They both groaned.
“Monday, Potter.” Malfoy strode to the door and disappeared into the hazy night. Harry dropped back into his chair and groaned, long and loud and heartfelt. He may only have five months of memories, but he could say with certainty that he’d never been so frustrated in his life.
“Exactly,” Harry said. “It’s our wedding. People think we’re madly in love. They won’t mind if we sneak off for a bit. They might even expect it.”
want – You’re welcome to–” He huffed and gestured irritably to the wingback chair, which showed no signs of the abuse Harry had hurled at it yesterday. “Please, sit.”
Harry had defended Malfoy to Ron while Hermione was listening, right there. He felt like he’d been punched.
“Jesus,” he couldn’t help but mutter. Hermione had warned him about this, too—it was the sensation of his magic returning to him. But it was his magic mixed with Malfoy’s—which his body would resist. Harry had to relax, to let it in.
Harry was so busy taking in Malfoy that he had almost forgotten where he was or why they were there. It came back to him suddenly and unpleasantly when a wizard at the front of the chamber that Harry had overlooked cleared his throat. He was small and tufty-haired, and it took Harry a moment to place him. When he did, his stomach lurched again. The officiant.
“No.” Harry couldn’t wipe the grin off his face. This was so much easier with Malfoy scowling at him. “One more thing.”
Despite Malfoy’s steeliness – or perhaps, a traitorous voice in Harry’s head suggested, because of it – Harry felt compelled to obey him. He Apparated to Ron and Hermione’s and knocked sheepishly. A harried Hermione answered, a quill behind her ear and an ink smudge on her cheek. She seemed surprised but pleased to see Harry, and ushered him inside.
“Five?” There was a sharp edge to Malfoy’s voice. “You know, for someone so clever, Granger talks a lot of shit.”
“Hmm,” Malfoy says in mock thought. He settles against Harry. “I think you could stand to be trained up for another few months. If you can cope with the hardship.”
– all he’d done in the last four months was stay at home, spend time with Ron and Hermione and get poked at by Healers. Trying to file those memories into imaginary cardboard boxes did not make them any more compelling. And all too often, he’d found his mind drifting back to the day’s session, and to Healer Malfoy – his vicious glare, his bright laugh, his Dark Mark…
Harry let her words sink in. “Oh.” Behind her, the bell above the door tinkled, and the roar of Muggle traffic drifted inside. Harry tried to think of something to say.
“It wasn’t a rivalry,” Ron snarled. “I’m sick of pretending we just threw Dungbombs at each other across the Great Hall.” He looked Harry dead in the face. “He’s a Death Eater, Harry.”
“I’ve been awake for hours counting the minutes until we could get started,” Harry told him. He crossed the room and settled himself into the wingback chair.
“The No-Maj Matrix, you say? Really?” The officiwizard’s eyes lit up. “I saw them perform at a MACUSA event back in ’85, you know!
“Listen, I really don’t know if I can,” he says, and his voice cracks, sounds human again. “We haven’t left it so long before. I think you should take the potion.”
against him. Pleasure flooded through every part of him—his fingers, his toes, hell, even the tips of his ears lit up with it. He fucked up against Harry’s dick, and was rewarded with another low, bitten-off noise from Harry.
“Come on,” Potter whines. His breath plays over the head of Draco’s cock, and Draco crumbles. He teases the head against Potter’s lips again, then finally, finally lets himself sink into the wet heat of Potter’s mouth.
A flash of panic shoots through him, and he focuses back on Potter to find him bare-chested, his shirt discarded on the floor at his feet. Draco’s mouth goes dry. He’s seen Potter undressed – they’ve shared a dormitory for months – but it’s never been for him before. He’s never been allowed to
“Wha–?” Harry’s dick was fully hard in Malfoy’s grip, but he was distracted. He should leave. He should stop this and go.
Harry’s eyes lingered on the flush that had worked itself up Malfoy’s neck. That precise shade of delicate pink was rapidly becoming Harry’s favourite colour. “Did you really not know?”
Harry tightened his grip on Malfoy’s chin, tipping his head backwards. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy’s breathing quickened at this, his lips parting. It was infuriating. Harry felt his cock twitch.
It was only after Harry had rescued Luna from dancing with Blaise Zabini that he caught sight of Draco again. He was lingering alone by the buffet table, a champagne glass held loosely in his hand. Harry always felt a bit silly, holding a wineglass—his fingers always felt clumsy with such a delicate thing. But Draco thoughtlessly pinched the stem as if he’d been served champagne every day of his life, the glass held straight and sure even as he stared into space.
At least Malfoy still hadn’t figured out the rest of it: that he was the reason for Harry’s – how had Malfoy put it? –
Harry twists to look at him. I miss the weight of his attention immediately, but I’m also currently getting a pretty spectacular handjob, which definitely lessens the blow.
Harry’s heart clenched. “Forget I said anything,” he said abruptly. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t’ve … What, er – What do you think about the Magpies’ chances against the Tornados on Saturday?”
Harry couldn’t speak. When he hadn’t been gazing at Malfoy, distracted by thoughts of hot mouths and pale skin, he had spent the evening convincing himself that he didn’t mind if his memories never returned. He’d have to come clean to the press, and it would be a bit of a pain relearning everything he used to know, but it wouldn’t be so bad. He’d make it work. It might even be nice, starting afresh.
But after a tense moment, Draco blinked, and his blank expression became a smile, only a little strained at the edges. “It’s absolutely lovely, Mrs Weasley. So thoughtful of you. Did you do all the charmwork yourself?”
Draco swayed as Harry wrapped a hand around his cock, and Harry instinctively steadied him, his free arm settling at Draco’s lower back, just above the swell of his arse. Fuck, but he was so hot and so
“What spell?” Draco asks vaguely. Harry’s response seems to have appeased him—but now he’s abandoned all pretence and is adjusting himself shamelessly. His legs part as he does and Harry gets an eyeful of the very defined shape of Draco’s swollen cock pressing against the thin cotton of his pyjama bottoms.
He went slow – much slower than last time, when Malfoy had impaled himself on Harry in one smooth movement – and allowed himself to savour it: the tendrils of pleasure wrapping around his entire body, Malfoy’s increasingly frustrated stream of words, the overwhelming relief of
Harry’s eyes linger on the scar-littered line of Malfoy’s neck. “Yeah,” he says, and smiles. “I think I could manage that.”
Harry already knew that Hermione couldn’t cast a Patronus – not since the War, she’d told him – but was faintly surprised to see Healer Malfoy avoid Brisley’s gaze.
“‘Better’?” Malfoy repeats. His voice is stronger, and the knot in Harry’s chest loosens. “I’d hardly say a few mouthfuls of Blood-Replenishing Potion is
I was already warm, but at the words, heat flares over me. I drain the last of my pint, knowing it won’t do anything to hide the redness of my ears, but I need something to concentrate on, a second to compose myself.
“He’s being a dick about it, of course,” Malfoy allowed. “But that’s certainly not your fault. And besides …” A pause. Harry turned his head, watching Malfoy through his lashes. Malfoy was already looking at him. “I like that you wanted to invite me over.”
He lets go of me, twists around and finds Harry’s mouth, kissing him awake. My chest throbs with a bittersweet longing.
Harry growled and deepened the kiss. Malfoy made a low sound in the back of his throat; Harry felt it on his tongue. He struggled to keep his head – he wanted to remember every detail, every noise, every movement – but the feeling of Malfoy pressed against him overwhelmed Harry’s mind in a way that Legilimency never had done. He couldn’t focus. He could only scrape his fingers through Malfoy’s hair, moan into his mouth, and kiss him, and kiss him, and kiss him.
Harry hugged them both tightly. When he let go, Malfoy was in place with his wand raised. “Need a moment?” he asked.
“I have to say, I’ve worked in Healing for twenty years, and I have never seen anything like your case before.” Healer Medlar stroked his goatee and leered at Harry. “But it’s hardly surprising you have stunned magical professionals. It wouldn’t be the first time!”
“Listen to me.” Speech is not coming easily. He doesn’t sound like himself at all. The melodious note is now less of a note, and more of a chorus – a harmony of inhumanity that Malfoy is powerless to resist. “If I take too much – if you feel like you might faint – hex me, and drink a Blood-Replenishing Potion straight away. Do you understand?”
It was actually nice to be back. The barman beamed when they walked in, and personally ushered them to their usual table. Harry recognised the familiar smattering of regulars. There were a few people he didn’t recognise, too. A handsome man with dark eyes and a full mouth smiled at Harry as they passed. Harry found himself smiling back.
He’s got his hands on the waistband of my boxers and his face less than a foot from my straining erection. At this point, it must be obvious that I’m absolutely fucking sure.
“No,” Harry says fervently, and kisses Draco again. Draco melts into it, and god, Harry wants to get impossibly closer, wants to drink up the sharp, clean, expensive scent that has been driving Harry to distraction for weeks.
Harry inhales sharply and jerks his head up. Draco is watching him carefully, his eyes bright even in the dim light. “Oh my god. Are you suggesting—?”
Malfoy’s face crumpled a little and Harry was worried he’d get tearful again, but he seemed to gather himself together. He straightened his shoulders, took some Floo powder and pocketed the gold. “I won’t forget this, Potter,” he said.
I start. Draco is watching me, his pale eyes sharp. I swear he was snoring into my shoulder less than a minute ago.
Every fifth letter, Harry would write Malfoy’s name at the top of a blank piece of parchment, stare at it, then screw it into a ball and throw it over his shoulder. Every tenth letter, he would stand abruptly, grab his wand and stride to the front door to Disapparate to St Mungo’s, only to come to a halt, swear loudly, and stomp back to the drawing room. By the evening, Harry’s head was pounding again. He balefully surveyed the remaining pile of letters (now the size of a short human – or a tall goblin) and decided that if the senders had already waited for months, another day or two wouldn’t hurt.
My hand falters. “They’re just scars.” I suppose talking about them counts as a distraction, but I’m uncomfortably aware that Draco’s dad is part of the reason I have them. There’s distractions, and then there’s mood-killers.
“Yeah, it’s me,” he said. “Fuck, Draco—” He rolled his hips, and Draco swore and thrust up against him, shifting the angle each time, chasing the feeling of—
Harry did so. That glimmer of hope still burned within him, and he relaxed into the image of the circular room like sliding into a warm bath. He let Malfoy’s voice wash over him as he gave further instruction: choose a unique memory of a specific place or person and move it behind one of the four wooden doors. They’d done similar exercises in the past. It was all quite soothing.
“On the bed,” Malfoy says imperiously. “Weasley, on your back, shoulders propped against the headboard; Harry, above him, knees either side of his chest.”
Brisley waved a hand. “Oh, he’s very in-demand – he’s absolutely brilliant, you know! He shot to the top of the field in such a short amount of time. We’re very lucky that he’s agreed to take on the case. Though I imagine it would be hard to turn down the opportunity to work with Harry Potter!” Another expectant pause. This time, Harry didn’t bother to force a smile.
Malfoy’s face betrayed no emotion. “Tomorrow,” he repeated. “Have you spoken to Weasley and Granger yet?”
A refusal had been on the tip of Draco’s tongue. He’d anticipated going home and moving on from the last few months. He’d already been planning new strategies to lock his far-fetched dreams back deep inside his mind. But the way Potter was looking at him…
Other memories bubbled to the surface. Malfoy’s instructions in Harry’s first Legilimency session – “Focus on the feeling of me,” – were suddenly scorching. The words morphed from a gentle admonishment to an order breathed over the head of Harry’s dick while Malfoy’s fingers pressed inside him, worked him open.
Harry wasn’t sure he’d be able to keep up with this conversation even if they were both fully clothed and sitting across the office from one another. He certainly couldn’t keep up while he was standing in Draco’s bedroom with Draco naked and tied up and within touching distance.
“Nope. I’ve heard it’s iffy, ethically, for a Mind Healer to talk business during social hours. I wouldn’t want to put you in that position. Er, again.”
Unable to think of another excuse, Harry grudgingly tidied his desk, taking as much time as he dared.
Something in his gaze, his tone, instantly evaporated Harry’s resentment and sent his blood rushing southwards. “Oh?” He dropped his voice. “Do you like it?”
It was startling the difference a day had made to Malfoy’s physique (all the more reason to suspect foul play, Harry told himself). He was still visibly too thin, faint shadows under his eyes and smudges of bruises across his torso and along his arms. Yet he seemed somehow more alive, his skin more vibrant, his hair brighter. Perhaps it was merely the way he held himself: surer, more confident – despite being tied up and naked and looking up at Harry with that sinful mouth caught halfway between a gasp and a smirk.
Involuntarily, Harry locks eyes with himself. In the half-light, his familiar features are sinister.
“Huh.” Harry looked around with renewed interest. It was a lot bigger than Harry’s circular stone room. “What do you need a mental space for? Did you lose your memory too?”
Malfoy’s grinning face flickered and a man Harry had seen only as a portrait floated to the front of his vision. The hooked nose and curled lip of Severus Snape – Harry’s previous Occlumency tutor, according to Hermione – sneered down at him from the wall of Professor McGonagall’s office: a memory from Harry’s unsuccessful trip to Hogwarts.
Harry tilted his head and, with the familiarity of weeks spent crashing together like waves on a shore, Malfoy kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him.
The words barely penetrate the fog of bloodlust, but the metallic tang of fear on Harry’s tongue pierces through. He wrenches himself away.
“What about him?” Draco runs a thumb over the head of my dick. It jerks eagerly in his fist. “He won’t be up for it yet.”
Draco shrugged in agreement, but he lowered his eyes. “My point is, that was the first time I thought you didn’t hate me. It was the first time I thought that maybe – one day, if all the stars aligned, I might have a chance with you.”
“The breeze,” he said. “That’s you, isn’t it?” He focused on the feeling – now he thought about it, it was less like a breeze and more like a cool patch of – something. What had Malfoy said? A presence.
“Oh – yeah. Yes. By the looks of things, I’m pretty much fixed now.” He grimaced as he sat. “Sorry, I should have got in touch.”
The first had been after that tiff with Weasley. Harry had probably just wanted company, shaken by what might have been his first disagreement with his friends.
The Harry in front of them slid his hand inside his underwear and pulled out his hardening dick. Malfoy made a quiet noise that could have been described as a whimper. The Harry on the bed bit his lip and dropped his head back to the pillow. His eyes closed.
“But what if I get my memory back and – I dunno, what if I’m like Ron was? What if I’m a dick and I can’t get over the – the Death Eater thing? What if now is our only chance?”
Malfoy strode over to Harry, grabbed his face in both hands, and kissed him, hard. He broke away quickly.
There was a strangled squawk and a brisk shushing sound from behind the two-way mirror. Harry grinned.
Draco tips his head back and savours the sweet silence. He finally has the dormitory to himself. It’s about fucking time.
There was a tightening in Harry’s groin. He looked down, shocked to find that he was already half-hard.
“Either way,” he said, forcing his voice into brightness, “you might be my best shot at fixing me, Death Eater or not. You already got me one memory back, didn’t you? And Healer Brisley says you’re brilliant.”
If Draco had any breath left in him, he’d be groaning praises to every ginger-haired spawn to ever come out of St Mungo’s Maternity Ward – but he’s shocked into silence, the wind completely knocked out of him by the slick, devastating heat of Harry Potter’s mouth.
“Fuck.” Harry scraped his hair back from his face. He scrubbed at the week-old beard on his chin. Reread the postscript. Felt himself get hard. “Fuck.”
“I haven’t!” Malfoy’s fingers scrabbled for purchase on his bindings. “I’ve never fucked an Auror before you –
“Yes,” Malfoy said from somewhere beyond the walls of the room. “Very good. Can you describe the space for me?”
Harry’s heart raced. His every muscle was tense. But when he fell forwards into Malfoy’s mind, he found himself in the empty high-ceilinged room that was Malfoy’s private mental space. The rows of white doors that lined the walls were all closed. It was quiet, serene. A spring morning in a stately home.
Malfoy looked at him as if he’d grown two extra heads. “Of course I do. What sort of question is that?”
“She is the most likely suspect,” Robards confirmed. “Though, given that both of your parents are deceased, we cannot be certain. Do you maintain that you had no knowledge of it?”
Underneath him, Malfoy was the picture of debauchery. His face was red, his hair was a mess, he was still tied up and he was covered in come. Some of it had landed on his face. As Harry watched, the first stirrings of orgasm gathering in his stomach, Malfoy’s tongue slid out to lick up a stray drop.
!” His fingers dug into Harry’s arms. Harry held him down, fucked him with everything he had. His legs were burning but it was nothing – nothing – compared to the searing ecstasy that blazed through the rest of him.
Potter nodded, then inhaled sharply. Memory-Draco had caught sight of Potter, and was looking absolutely stupid: frozen, staring, his Butterbeer halfway to his open mouth. Potter blinked, then turned back to the witches at the table.
Draco gets on the bed. He scratches his nails down Potter’s back, following the smooth line of his spine, until he has Potter’s pert fucking arse cheeks in the palms of his hands.
“This is—” I say helplessly. “You’re— Fuck.” I run shaking hands over the backs of their heads, taking care to keep my fingers gentle as they run through Harry’s chaotic hair. He makes a soft noise of appreciation, and the sound seems to affect Malfoy as much as it does me; he grabs Harry’s chin and kisses him roughly, the head of my cock still between them.
Draco looked at him through his eyelashes. Having him change the colour of the ribbons had been a mistake. He was unbelievably gorgeous. He was Harry’s favourite person, wrapped in Harry’s favourite colours. “But?”
The hot lick of desire that swept through him at Malfoy’s words was quickly tempered by the thought of having to replace him with another useless, toadying, arse-licking twat.
Of course, Harry had also fantasised plenty about fucking Draco, about having him naked and hard and begging. But there had never been any part of him that believed
” Draco broke the kiss and threw his head back. “Oh my god, feels so good – I’m gonna come – Stop – You have to stop.
He was sitting across a dark wooden desk from Head Auror Robards, Harry’s former (and Ron’s current) boss. Ron and Hermione were with him—Ron in the chair next to him, Hermione on her feet, pacing anxiously.
They returned to a smiling Hermione and a scowling Ron. Harry slid into the booth easily; Malfoy hovered at the edge of the table.
“I was never roleplaying.” God, Malfoy was so hot. How had Harry not realised how much he would like this? “Who told you the details of the Paxman case?”
Draco snorted. He unhooked Harry’s cloak from the rack and held it out. “Madam Tamsworth isn’t that bad. And anyway, her mince pies make up for the, you know” – he waved a careless hand – “general over-effusiveness. If you’d just
Every single door slammed open. A dark, swirling vortex burst out of each one like the sea gushing into a sinking ship. The room filled quickly, the white walls vanishing beneath the maelstrom of noise and colour. Harry drew his wand instinctively, defensive spells already on his lips, but he and Malfoy were untouched by the deluge. Malfoy was still looking at him.
He wanted Malfoy. Fuck, he burned with it. He wanted to touch him, to fuck him, to be owned by him. His heart pounded loudly in his ears, a heavy
“He is Harry’s Healer,” she said, smiling sweetly. Ron’s wince intensified. “To have a chance of recovering his memories, Harry needs to be completely comfortable around him. I think a drink with us in a casual setting would be extremely beneficial.”
Harry smiled tightly. “That’s kind of you, but I came to see whether Malfoy here had got settled with his room for the night. Did you say you were fully booked?”
Malfoy shook his head. “Don’t worry. You have many memories overlapping. The memory of your first day is evidently too similar to things you have done since. Is there somewhere you’ve been only once in the last few months? Something specific and different to your everyday life?”
“I’m really sorry, I know it’s a dick move to take down privacy charms. I just need to get this book. Hermione and Pince are ready to kill me.”
“So good,” Harry says. “Feels so good.” Then, his tongue loosened by pleasure, he says, “We can do more another time. I wanna— Wanna suck your cock, fuck, I wanna taste you—”
“If you don’t want this, say no,” Harry ground out, biting Malfoy’s neck. “You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.”
He knew better than to mention his theory to Hermione while Ron was listening, but the tentative thought bolstered him as he headed home. He settled himself on what he’d finally come to think of as “his” sofa and closed his eyes. For the first time he could remember, he had some homework to do.
“Carriages. Pulled by Thestrals.” He had a thick silver ring on his left thumb. Harry couldn’t quite make out the design.
– in that strained, breathy voice – would have. It took everything – everything – to stop his hips jerking upwards at the words. It took everything not to swear and let instinct take over and bury himself deep in Draco’s body.
Draco is looking at me in the exact way Hermione used to when she was having An Emotional Realisation, About Which We Really Do Need To Have A Discussion, Ron; I determinedly ignore it and climb onto the bed. All three of us are fully naked now, but so far I’ve avoided ogling Harry’s dick. It seemed like it would be impolite, really—like Draco said, I’m a guest. It’d be like going to someone’s house and not taking your eyes off a pile of Galleons on the mantelpiece, wouldn’t it?
“Yeah?” Harry meant it to sound alluring, but it came out more of a breathless rasp. “What makes me different?”
A flash of need – Harry was sure it was need – passed over Malfoy’s face, but he shook his head, not taking his eyes off Harry. “We can’t.”
He picks the wand up now. It feels uncertain in his hand – has done ever since he got it back, but the thought of getting a new one is hysterical. Where would he go? Ollivanders?
It was hard to keep the disgust off his face. “Yes,” he said. “It’s very important. You’d be helping your – your Master out very much.”
It is a bit weird, finally. But the weird thing isn’t that it’s Harry, that he’s my best friend. The weird thing is that instead of panic and uncertainty, I feel relief. Instead of being stuck on “What the fuck is happening!”, my brain is going, “God. Yes. Finally.”
“Hi.” Harry closed the door behind himself and lingered on the threshold. There were pewter smudges under Malfoy’s eyes. He looked almost as tired as Harry felt.
Nothing tastes as good as Malfoy’s blood. Nothing – not the Thirst-Quenching Draughts Harry forces down, not the Bicorn blood he buys for fifteen Sickles a pint, and certainly not any actual food. But if anything were to come second to the soaring ecstasy of Malfoy’s blood, it’s the taste of his mouth.
“God.” I’m still staring at his cock. The dark ridges of his veins fan out over it like forks of lightning. I lick my lips.
“Okay. Erm.” Harry took another fortifying drink. “The reason I started using the Pensieve isn’t because I’m trying to hide resentful feelings towards you or anything,” he said in a rush. “It’s because before two weeks ago I didn’t have any kind of sex drive and all of a sudden it came back and I didn’t want you to see what I was – what I was, er. How I was dealing with that.”
Fuck, but he was so tight. Heat flared over Draco until he was sure he was as red as his tomato nose had been in Harry’s memory. His finger sunk in slowly as Harry’s body relaxed around him, hot and tight and sweet.
. I find myself gripping Draco’s waist again, but I can’t remember moving my hands—can’t concentrate on anything other than the slow, hot slide of cock-against-cock.
It might be easier to walk when you can see where your next step is going to be. But, Harry thought, splashing through ankle-deep puddles, his glasses all but opaque from cold rain and hot breath—sometimes it’s much more fun to grab someone’s hand, leap into the unknown, and see where you land.
Merlin, but he was a tragic sight. A fat tomato in the middle of his face, the rest of him flushing to match. But the feeling colouring Harry’s memory wasn’t contempt, it was—something strange. Soft and slow and warm.
Malfoy grabbed his wand almost instinctively. He made no move to cast. “I shouldn’t.” He swallowed. “The environment, it’s not ideal, we don’t know how your mind might react–”
Behind his eyelids was Malfoy. Harry shied away from the image, assuming it would be strange to think of him in such a context. But the snapshot of Malfoy after the duel – pink-cheeked and panting – persisted. The surroundings shifted. Suddenly, Harry pictured Malfoy sweaty and elated, not standing, grinning, framed by the large window in his office, but laid across Harry’s bed in the half-light of dusk, eyes lidded.
“Not at all,” Malfoy said. “I’ll leave you to it. A pleasure to see you again, Mr Scuttleby.” He met Harry’s eyes meaningfully. “Do let me know when you decide on a date for the Mixed-blood Being Outreach Fundraiser, won’t you, Potter? I’ve always been impressed by your work with them. The ball last November was a wonderful night – I’ve never attended a more well-put together event. The fairy choir was a wonderful touch.”
“He wants to hear you,” Harry interprets, idly fondling my balls. I close my eyes against the renewed waves of pleasure.
“God.” Harry glared at Malfoy and tried to project his filthy thoughts as loudly as possible in his direction. “Fine. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Over the last six months, Harry had received so many letters, been approached by so many strangers, read so many news articles – all of them talking about this grand hero that didn’t sound anything like Harry at all. How was he supposed to be that person? He knew, deep down, that he wasn’t a Saviour. He wasn’t a Chosen One or a Vanquisher of Darkness. He was just … Harry.
Malfoy’s face was still inscrutable and Harry’s heart was so, so soft. He couldn’t resist adding, “Of course, I’m also fine skipping the dinner and heading straight to mine, if you’d prefer. I’m actually free right now, if…?”
Harry’s eyes were still closed. Awareness returned gradually. “I won’t,” he said. His heart pounded a dull, rapid rhythm in his ears. “I couldn’t. Fuck, Draco.”
Harry soon found himself echoing Draco’s approving noises as they pressed closer, as their mouths learned each other, as their movements became jerkier, more urgent. Between the heat of the fire on his back and Draco on his front, Harry was getting uncomfortably warm, but the thought of pulling away to remove his robes sent a sharp pang through his chest. He didn’t want to stop. If he stopped, he might come to his senses. Stopping was an awful, awful idea.
Draco’s head is on Harry’s shoulder, his nose jammed into the side of Harry’s neck. His quiet snores send faint puffs of air over Harry’s collarbones. His pyjama-clad legs are tangled with Harry’s: one leg hooked over Harry’s knee, one bare foot caught in the hem of Harry’s jeans. His hand is resting on Harry’s stomach, perilously close to— Oh, bloody hell. Perilously close to the raging hard-on that Harry is currently sporting.
“What?” My attention catches on “Granger”, but Harry has wrapped a loose fist around my dick and is stroking me torturously slowly, so I’m struggling to process what Malfoy just said. “God, Harry—”
As a rule, Harry didn’t like taking orders from anyone other than his superiors at work, and even then it irked him to be told what to do. On the other hand, Harry did really, really want to fuck Malfoy, so he decided to let this one slide. He lifted Malfoy’s legs onto his shoulders, tightened his grip, and began to move.
Each Diagnostic Charm had provoked a similar reaction, but each felt slightly different. Healer Brisley’s were always warm and oozing, giving Harry the uncomfortable feeling that he’d wet himself. Healer Medlar, who Harry had had the dubious pleasure of having worked with throughout the whole of April, performed Diagnostic Charms that felt like the static from a Muggle television.
They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry didn’t know what to say, so he summoned his wand and pointed it at the ornate bow at the base of Draco’s dick. Draco didn’t flinch.
—and they kissed again, again, Draco’s hands in Harry’s hair, on his jaw, his neck. His thighs burned from holding himself up, but Harry was touching them—was touching him everywhere—and Draco had never felt anything like it.
Since their conversation in the pub and Harry’s distracted exit afterwards, Malfoy avoided Harry’s eyes in the morning until Harry had finished siphoning his memories into the Pensieve. It was much worse than before, having Malfoy know why Harry had to lean heavily on the sideboard for a few minutes to recover. Harry’s face always flamed as he turned around. Malfoy always had a matching flush lingering above his collar.
A low, loud groan fills the room—it takes me a second to realise that it’s me. He’s so tight—so fucking hot and tight. I haven’t done loads of anal before, but I’ve done enough to recognise the slide of lube, to know that his hole has been stretched—and knowing that the cause of his earlier breathlessness was probably him fingering himself open for my dick does
Harry tried his best to ignore the hand still trailing over the books. He concentrated. After about thirty seconds of feeling nothing at all, he let out a groan of frustration.
What the fuck have I done? That kiss after Neville’s stag do was hard enough to repress, but this? How am I supposed to carry on like nothing happened now I have the memory of Harry’s raw voice ordering me to suck his cock? Now I know what he sounds like when someone slides a soft hand into his hair? What he looks like when he comes?
Draco cleared his throat. “I’ve put the kettle on,” he said, gesturing to the stove. “Did you want tea? Or something else?”
—like an evening in a Central London park—and I’m hit with a wave of affection so aching that I nearly stumble from the strength of it.
But Harry was on a roll. “And all that crap he was spewing last night – that you only agreed to work with me because you like having power over me!” He scoffed. “Absolute dragonshit.”
Harry’s tongue meets mine and I let out a quiet gasp: I know Harry was drinking beer at the pub, but he tastes like
Harry shuddered, his fingernails pricks of pain on Draco’s back, and Draco licked and sucked his way downwards, lingering at the base of Harry’s neck, his nipple, his hipbones. Harry arched into him, following the path of Draco’s mouth—raising his chest, then his stomach, then his hips. Fuck, he was hot. He was so hot.
Harry was so tight—so incredibly tight—and he pulled Draco’s fingers deeper, pulling him inside in the same way his mind dragged Draco’s in when they worked with Legilimency.
“So.” Something like pain tugged at Malfoy’s thin mouth. “I haven’t seen you in Auror robes since I became your Healer, have I?”
“No,” Malfoy allowed, “but there’s still more than enough time. If you place too much weight on it, it will hold you back. Do you hear me?”
“His cock feels amazing too,” Draco gasps, steadily impaling himself, over and over. “So big. Fuck, Ron, you feel so good, stretching me so wide. I wanna do this forever.
But now, faced with this girl, he felt uneasy. She said she didn’t expect him to remember, but Harry was sure that if he still had his memory, he’d know exactly who she was. He was sure he’d be able to talk to her, to ask specifics about her situation, to say something meaningful – to say anything at all.
Draco lets out a cry and his thighs tighten around Harry’s hips, but Harry barely notices because he’s squeezing his eyes shut and coming—drowning in the ecstasy of their joined hands wrenching his orgasm from him, of the hot splash of come over his fist and stomach, of Draco above him, against him, around him.
Hermione’s mouth twisted in a strange way – as if she was trying not to smirk. “Of course,” she said, turning back to Malfoy, “I’m sure Healer Medlar is incredibly skilled. But I never got the impression that he had taken the time to really familiarise himself with Harry’s case.”
When they had first been assigned as partners, Harry had quickly learned that he couldn’t say no to Draco. It had surprised him at first, how Draco could tell him to do something in that imperious tone, and Harry would obey unthinkingly. Even when he’d still thought Draco was an arrogant dickhead, Draco could order Harry around, and Harry would always listen.
He arrived at Ron and Hermione’s for dinner with his eyes still prickling and his arms full of food. The hours passed quickly – it was only now that he realised how tense Ron and Hermione had been for the last six months. Seeing Hermione snort with laughter and Ron wave his arms to recount a frenzied tale from the Wheezes shop floor warmed Harry’s insides more than Mrs Weasley’s delicious shepherd’s pie ever could. He went home smiling.
“Mmm, yeah, definitely. I agree,” Harry said, cutting Morgan off with a vague wave of his hand. “It’s very bad. Disgraceful.” A pause, then, “He looks good, though, doesn’t he?”
at you – God, I love you.” He tightened his grip on Draco’s sweaty sides, on the silky ribbons that wound around his hot flesh. “I love you so much. I do.”
Harry takes a step back. “It’s in my dormitory!” he assures her. “In my trunk, very safe. I’ll bring it back first thing tomorrow–”
It was getting late, but Harry’s day-long sleep had done its work; it was with a clear head that he stepped out of the fireplace in Malfoy’s room at the Leaky Cauldron. Malfoy was lounging on the bed, shoulders leaning against the headboard and one long leg bent at the knee. He had a book in his hands, but he wasn’t reading it; he was staring at Harry, his mouth open.
Draco’s voice catches on every upward jerk of my hips. My jaw aches and my eyes are watering but I’m drowning in pleasure. At this point, I’m groaning around Harry’s cock more than I’m actually sucking it, but he doesn’t seem to mind; his breaths come in short, harsh pants as he watches me.
“He’s here already,” Harry says, nodding to the bar. “Making a fuss over the quality of the drinks, I expect.” He nods to the bar and I follow his gaze—past Hermione (who, I’m horrified to note, is now actually
After the Healers at St Mungo’s determined that Harry showed no evidence of having been hit with any sort of Memory Charm, Hermione had taken it upon herself to take charge of Harry’s medical situation. She had fought the Healers when they had suggested he stay permanently in the Spell Damage ward. She had accompanied him to meetings, tests and therapy sessions, and had also done an incredible amount of research herself, brandishing pages and pages of theories to every new specialist that they saw.
Harry braced himself. A few tense breaths later, he unclenched. He counted to five, waiting. A breeze passed over him from the open window. He shivered.
Malfoy inhales sharply. His fingers tighten around his length. “Fuck. You hardly need to flatter me at this point, you know. I’m already here.”
But the mirror remained motionless, and Malfoy’s once-wintry voice was weary when he whirled to Harry and said, “So, to summarise, Susan was sitting in a Southend shoe shop, Seamus was selling seashells by the Southend seashore. Where were you positioned in all this?”
Draco’s mouth got that twisted look that meant he was running through possibilities in his mind. Usually, a case-solving suggestion followed – the answer to a riddle that had been stumping them for weeks, an idea that led to a breakthrough, a lead that no one else had noticed. Harry would miss that look, if Draco didn’t want to work with him any more.
Malfoy didn’t get up, but he scrubbed the glistening streaks of tears from his face. They were quickly retraced.
Draco’s eyes rake down Harry’s body to his crotch, where Harry’s own cock has not yet got the memo that now is not a good time.
Mum always says my problem is that I care too much. I think that’s nonsense, honestly—one of those meaningless things mums say to make you feel better about overreacting to stupid shit. But I can’t deny that I care about my friends. I mean,
On three, Harry let his hair fall. The two strands—one black, one almost white—floated down and landed simultaneously on the surface of the potion. Harry expected ripples, but they sunk under the surface without disturbing it at all. Harry felt his attention beginning to stick again. He fought to stay present.
Harry glanced at the mirror again. It revealed nothing but the bright, blank, brutal room reflected back at him. He shrugged. “Fancied a day off.”
It had occurred to him that Malfoy might not be there, that Harry would have to slope back to Grimmauld Place and stew in his own lust until tomorrow.
“He doesn’t,” Ron insisted, pointing at Malfoy. “He’s only doing this because he likes having power over you. It’s all he ever wanted!”
Harry stared. Malfoy had drawn the details out effortlessly – Harry hadn’t even noticed it happening. After a month of no progress, the bright spark of hope ignited inside Harry’s chest again. He hadn’t realised that it had dimmed.
“I know.” Draco twists his head, the lines of his neck straining, then they’re snogging messily, open mouths and tongues and teeth. I’m so strangely overwhelmed by the sight of them—they have each other, fuck, I’m so glad—that I flinch at the unexpected feeling of Harry’s dick against mine.
Draco’s fingers scrabble at the hem of Harry’s shirt, struggling to find skin without breaking the kiss, and Harry curses himself for putting his shirt back on. But then Draco growls and jerks the fabric up until it’s bunched under Harry’s armpits and slides his hand against Harry’s bare side. Icy heat spreads from Draco’s palm and shudders through Harry’s whole body. Harry grabs Draco’s arse, yanks him closer.
A loud chime sounded, signalling the end of the interrogation. Harry grinned at Draco, who threw his hands in the air.
Ron looked like he was on the edge of another outburst, but another severe glare from Hermione seemed to evaporate it out of him. He made a noise of disgust, and shook his head.
“How come the cleverest, funniest and best person I know also has the world’s most beautiful cock? It’s not fair.”
Harry snorts. “Hardly. He refuses to pay at all if the service doesn’t meet his exacting standards.”
Harry managed to Floo to St Mungo’s – cleaned, clothed and caffeinated – for exactly ten o’clock. He knocked and, like yesterday, opened the door without waiting for an answer.
Harry pulls away—both of us panting harshly—and suddenly Malfoy is there, elbowing Harry aside with a haughty, “My turn.” He jabs his wand at me and my open shirt vanishes, leaving me naked from the waist-up. My yelp of protest is swallowed by Malfoy’s mouth.
Something wet and cool fills Draco’s hand, but Draco barely notices – he only needs to turn his head a fraction and his nose is buried in Potter’s hair. He breathes him in. Potter smells like sweat and shampoo and Amortentia and Draco wants to
“If you won’t tell me that, then tell me this,” Harry said. “Who was it? Which other Aurors have you compromised?”
But instead of chuckling politely, Harry’s looking at me, his gaze oddly intense. “Ron,” he says slowly.
Harry shrugged, unapologetic. “None of you will tell me how we know each other. And I couldn’t help but notice your arm yesterday.”
“I knew your whole story was a set-up,” Harry snarled. “I should arrest you right now for fraud, obstruction of justice, entering a household through dishonest means – I let you in my
The heat around my cock vanishes, snatching me back from the edge a split second before it’s too late. I cry out in protest.
Malfoy sucked Harry’s cock with purpose, and through the thickening cloud of pleasure, Harry struggled to process what was happening. Twenty minutes ago he’d been alone in his study, almost tearing his hair out in frustration. Now, he was in a dingy room in the Leaky Cauldron with his dick in Draco Malfoy’s mouth, almost tearing Malfoy’s hair out in frustration. And Malfoy was so damn good at this…
you, you were fucking awful and I hadn’t heard from you in years and I was stressed out of my mind and I helped you! How could you
“Don’t worry.” Malfoy’s presence in Harry’s mind shifted. A cool, soothing wave washed over him. “Keep the sound in your mind for me. Concentrate on it, but don’t hold it too tightly.”
It’s been six months, two weeks and four days since Hermione. Time has sewn up the hole in my chest—clumsily, with uneven stitches my mum would tut at, but it’s definitely no longer the gaping wound it used to be.
At that, Malfoy laughed. It was a bright, delighted sound, completely at odds with his lofty tone. “Have they been that bad?”
“You don’t have to, if you don’t want to,” Harry reminds me quietly. “I told you, Draco’s not really in charge, here.”
“Not at all,” Malfoy said, and Harry’s heart sank. Malfoy noticed his reaction. “I mean,” he corrected quickly, “I don’t
“And I said you don’t need to be,” Harry counters. He glances towards Malfoy again. “Listen,” he says in a low voice. “I couldn’t tell you at the time, but the only reason I stopped you was because I’d just started seeing him.” He jerks his head to the bar, where Malfoy is levitating drinks onto a tray, snapping when the bartender tries to help.
It’s easy to find Malfoy’s room. Inside, the decor is simple. Rustic. The mustiness of the furniture is barely perceptible, overpowered by the intensity of Malfoy’s scent. There’s another smell – bitter, medicinal – and Harry focuses on the bedside table, on which sit three phials of Blood-Replenishing Potion. He frowns.
Harry blinked rapidly. “Thank you,” he said. “Both of you. Thank you for looking after me while I’ve been so useless.”
“—and there are definitely times when it’s weird. His mum came round while I was at his flat the other day. Turns out, it’s awkward, trying to come up with something to say to the person who lied to Voldemort for me, but who is also still married to the bloke who tried to murder me on multiple occasions.”
“Wait.” Harry did grab Malfoy’s hand this time. He heard a strangled noise come from Ron’s chair, but he didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy. “Will you stay with me while I do it?”
“Whoa, hang on a minute. What’s going on?” Ron looked from Hermione to Harry, who shrugged. “What’s Legilimency therapy? Is it dangerous? Is that why you’re being weird?”
I stand so abruptly that one of the glasses does fall, shattering with a crash on the rough flagstones. A few people look over—George jeers at me, calls out something about fleeing the scene of the crime as I repair the glass and hurry to the fireplace. Maybe on a normal night I’d respond. But tonight isn’t a normal night.
That first morning had been the worst, although not initially. He’d woken up and everything had been … peaceful. He hadn’t known where he was, or who he was, or why he should care. There was just the bright sound of birds through the window and the soft brush of cotton sheets against his skin. He hummed contentedly and blinked lazily at the ceiling. It felt like he was floating.
Tier five showed Harry being carted to St Mungo’s on a stretcher and Draco shut inside a neat little cottage, a Welsh flag in the window.
“You don’t have to cover your eyes like that,” he says, aiming for amused, falling somewhat short. “Come here.”
Malfoy let out a breath of laughter – the same bright, delighted sound as before. His chest was rising and falling heavily beneath his neat buttoned robes. “Don’t worry about it,” he said. “I’ve seen enough, anyway. That was…”
.” Hermione jabbed her wand at the Patronus; it hissed and fled. “Come on, then,” she said to Harry. “It’ll be over soon.”
Potter’s grip on Draco slackens – but returns a moment later, pulling him close, biting at his lower lip. “Okay,” he says. “Yeah, okay, let’s – God, Malfoy.”
“He’s all right,” I allow, shaking my head to rid it of that last rogue thought. “If you like them pointy and inbred.”
.” Draco pushed his hips upwards, angling his dick towards Harry’s mouth. Harry wrapped his hand around it, marvelling at the resistance of it as he pulled it upright. Despite his complaints, Draco was still so, so hard.
Malfoy tugged him down and kissed him, long and deep and soft. Harry lost himself in it, fancying he could taste Malfoy’s come on his tongue, feeling his cock stir again.
Harry kissed back immediately. Just like that. No hesitation. His entire body curled into Draco, pressed him against the counter in a mirror image of the memory Draco had just yanked them out of, and, fuck, it was everything. It was
As the conversation veered into obscure principles of Mind Magic, Harry struggled to keep his eyes from drifting to Malfoy. He was unused to seeing him in profile like this – they were so often face-to-face, Malfoy sitting across from him, their eyes locked, their minds linked. His nose looked different from the side – straight and sharp rather than pointy. The flickering candlelight cast dark shadows under his jaw, making it look even more striking than usual. As Harry watched, a lock of white-blond hair fell from where it had been tucked behind Malfoy’s ear. Harry had the bizarre urge to reach out and fix it.
There’s a pause, then tension floods through him—they’re so close that Harry feels it keenly—and he sits up quickly. He stares at Harry, mouth open, for a long moment, then he blinks and shuffles backwards. He draws his knees to his chest, rubbing his eyes.
Harry surveyed her coldly. He wanted to demand who she thought she was, and was stopped only by the casual way she greeted him. Someone else from his past, he guessed. He didn’t care.
Malfoy grinned, and for a moment, he looked nothing at all like a Healer, nothing at all like any of the stuffy experts that had poked and prodded and pestered him. He looked nothing at all like someone with a Dark Mark burned into his arm.
Harry sat back in the wingback chair. He hadn’t felt this nervous having Malfoy’s wand pointed at him since his very first session. His heart beat rapidly in his chest. Malfoy’s eyes met his. “Are you ready now?”
Harry’s hand was still moving in that steady, confident way. Draco wanted to scream—he didn’t know what was more frustrating, the measured pace of Harry’s hand or the level tone of his voice.
After six months, the Healers had said, the likelihood of regaining lost memories dropped to almost zero. Six months had felt like a long time back in February. Now, at the end of May, it felt like no time at all.
it, wants to see what other noises he can draw from Potter, and he closes the distance between them to capture it, to swallow it, to make it a part of himself for this glorious, blessed thirty minutes. The kiss consumes him, and he finds himself acting completely without thought – he’s surprised when his fingertips slide against the warm, smooth skin of Potter’s stomach, not having realised that his hands had slipped under Potter’s shirt.
“Ron,” he says, strained. Just that, just my name. But knowing he knows it’s me, that it’s my name in his mouth, spurs me on. I take him deeper.
Harry wasn’t sure the words were meant for him, and was too distracted to care – Malfoy had just wrapped a hand around Harry’s cock and was lining himself up.
“Absolutely you did,” Draco said, and Harry’s face fell. “I’ve had a constant hard-on ever since. I haven’t been comfortable in weeks.”
Harry starts moving again, but it’s slow, wary. I wish I could see his face, but I satisfy myself with Draco’s. He seems to be caught on the very edge of pleasure and pain, his eyebrows quivering upwards in the middle, his mouth open, his eyes closed.
They go. Potter keeps his arm around Draco. He smiles, laughs, casually compliments. By the time they’re outside Draco’s flat, Draco’s face is hot.
Malfoy tutted. “Concentrate on something else. Picture your mental space. I think you’re ready to revisit your memories of your trip to Hogwarts.”
He smiles, strained, at my pitiful attempts at encouragement. “Yeah?” he asks breathily. “Does it feel good?”
Harry shook his head. “I dunno. Yesterday I would have sworn I’ve never seen you before in my life, but … you just feel so…”
Ordinarily, I’d snap that I don’t need Malfoy to tell me what Harry likes, but his lips against my skin and Harry’s mouth around my cock make me forgiving. I brush a shaky thumb against Harry’s forehead and slide my fingers into his hair. He whimpers around me, sucks me deeper. My cock hits the back of his throat.
Harry mumbled his thanks and skulked to the row of cupboards along the left wall. He couldn’t remember ever using a Pensieve – ever even seeing one – but he knew exactly what to do. He heaved the empty stone basin out of the cupboard and set it on the sideboard. He touched the tip of his wand to his temple.
Harry had never Splinched himself before, and for a long second, he was confused why his appearance had caused an outbreak of horrified screaming instead of the usual whispers and stares. He looked down at himself—at most of himself. As if it had been waiting for his brain to catch up, pain abruptly flooded through him. Harry inhaled sharply, once, and collapsed on the spot.
Malfoy didn’t take the bait. “Any further details about his appearance? Height, build, hair colour, complexion, clothing?”
Harry pulled a face. He’d seen the carriages Malfoy had recommended—awful, ostentatious things, pulled by silver adolescent unicorns with red ribbons woven into their manes. Harry wouldn’t be seen dead ten feet near one, much less riding one through London.
, Harry–” Malfoy says, his voice rising on a sharp inward thrust. “Fuck – Talk to me again – So hot when you sound like that–”
“Does he feel good?” Harry asks me roughly. His eyes are dark, his renewed attention delicious. “Does Draco’s arse feel good around you?”
“Well, I said ‘hold on’.” But Harry’s tone didn’t match his flippant words. His eyes were wide and dark—and fixed on Draco. “God, seeing you here. You’ve no idea how much I’ve thought about this.”
“Hi,” Potter said. Draco blinked at the affection Potter managed to inject into even that single syllable. He hadn’t expected— Obviously, it was different now, so—
even through the barrier of Potter’s underwear, and it jumps when Draco’s fingers brush it. “I want to take you apart. Fuck, Potter. You drive me crazy.”
He doesn’t flinch when his borrowed face—vibrant, pretty—melts into his own—pinched, unlovable; the ache in his chest is far worse than the burn of Polyjuice.
Harry struggled to make sense of the chaos of images that flashed before him. He caught a glimpse of Ron, as he’d seen him in Malfoy’s head – thinner, ganglier, wearing school robes that showed six inches of freckled ankle. Then Hermione, drenched to the skin, curled up, sobbing loudly. A hawthorn wand wrestled out of a sweaty grip, the owner’s cool, fragrant magic still thrumming through it. A man with long black hair, fear and surprise twisting his gaunt face, falling backwards through a veiled archway. A high, sinister laugh.
“Granger, I swear on all that is magical, if I have to come over there and shove him out of the door myself—”
Harry was unrelenting. “You figured out what was wrong with my memory without even meeting me. You took all the shit tests the other Healers used and made them better. You listened to me and guided me and helped me in so many ways you didn’t need to. You
It hit him, suddenly, that Draco was naked. All of Harry’s fantasies unrolled in his head, painfully close to being attainable. Harry didn’t stop lavishing attention on Draco’s neck – how could he, when Draco was groaning like that? – but he let his hand fall from Draco’s hair to his shoulder, finding the edge of ribbon under his fingers and unseeingly following its path as it circled Draco’s sternum, his ribs, his stomach…
Harry’s world had narrowed so much to the hot sweetness of Draco’s mouth that it took a few seconds for the words to make sense. He pulled back, only to be confronted by Draco’s kiss-swollen lips and heavy-lidded eyes. Harry let out a whine and kissed him again, helplessly.
With great effort, he loosened the claw-like grip he had on Harry and rubbed the deep crescent grooves that his fingernails had left behind. “Sorry about that.”
Again, Potter obeys without hesitation. He draws himself off Draco’s cock and clumsily arranges himself until he’s spread out on the bed. His cock lies against his belly, hard and dark and leaking. He wraps his hand around it and groans.
Some more red hair was ahead of him. Harry gratefully followed the beacon of it until it sharpened: Ron, his best man, a solid presence at the front of the room. And behind Ron…
Sighing, he banished the letters into the drawing room and began to plough through them. He could identify fanmail at a glance and burned each one on sight, but even then, it was early afternoon before he’d opened them all. By the time he was done, only a single stack remained. It was good progress, he thought.
Malfoy lifted his wand. The sensation faded. “That’s an interesting question,” he said carefully. “I’m not entirely sure of the answer, myself.”
“See that you do.” Ron’s hand darted around Harry’s and he brandished a second chip triumphantly. “Mum’d be over the moon.”
There was a crackle of magic. The air felt charged—Harry could have sworn his robes were moving, as if buffeted by wind, but he was unable to look away from the light that surrounded their joined hands, his gaze stuck on the flare of silver and gold.
“For fuck’s sake, Potter, put your dick in his mouth,” Draco snaps from behind Harry. He sounds a bit breathless. I wonder what he’s doing. I don’t wonder enough to look away.
Potter pulls back and gazes into his eyes for a long, hot, moment, then – without looking away for a second – pushes Draco backwards.
Harry clenched his fists. The circular room appeared again. The image quickly warped into the Grimmauld Place parlour – the Leaky Cauldron – the St Mungo’s reception.
He makes a high, desperate noise, and Potter responds with a murmur of agreement, pressing closer, his lips parting. The charm has reacted to Draco’s desires; there’s no hesitation from him now. He grabs Draco’s hips and heat flares through Draco’s whole body. He can’t stop touching Potter everywhere, anywhere, from his face to his arms to his earlobes – he wants it all. Has wanted it all for so long. He never thought that he could
Malfoy’s impassive mask flickered. “If you’re sure, the sooner the better,” he said. “The noise in your head is still very strong. But we don’t know how long that will last. We can’t risk delaying, not at this stage.” His eyes were bright. He was still so pale.
He hadn’t been thinking clearly. It didn’t excuse it, he knew. But a week without sleep, without food, without company – of course he’d be suggestible. He’d never have done it if he’d been in his right mind. He wouldn’t.
“The Hogwarts Express.” Harry tried not to let his frustration show. These questions were common knowledge. He could have picked them up at any point over the last four months. Not to mention that he’d been quizzed on them dozens of times. This was never going to prove anything.
“Actually, I think I called them that,” Hermione had corrected. “I think you said they were ‘arse-licking twats’, Harry.”
He arrived at Malfoy’s office in a foul mood, the letter still clenched in his fist. He stuffed it into his pocket and opened the door with a little more force than necessary.
“Fuck–” Malfoy bucks his hips and Harry easily takes his cock deep into his throat, pulls back to swallow another mouthful of blood, takes it deep again, repeats. “Fuck, Harry, I’m – I’m close–”
It occurred to him, suddenly, over a crisp bacon sandwich, that Malfoy might have shown him the Mark on purpose. “If you wish to continue, I will see you back here tomorrow,” Malfoy had said. And then he’d rolled up his sleeves, slowly, lazily, making sure Harry was paying attention. Had he been ensuring Harry was aware of his past before Harry let him into his mind?
Harry was still preoccupied with thoughts of Malfoy, of possession, of Malfoy liking it. “I didn’t send you anything last night.”
Next reared the memory of Malfoy teaching him to secure the doors in his mind. “Nice and tight,” he had said. He was saying it again in Harry’s imagination, but he was gasping it, his body stretched above Harry’s, his soft hair stringy with sweat and his mouth open in pleasure as he pushed himself slow and deep, deep, deep inside Harry.
Harry shivered under Malfoy’s stern glare. It had been a long time since he’d been on the receiving end of it—he’d forgotten how those narrowed eyes could feel like a dagger in the chest.
Malfoy leant against the wall next to Harry. Their arms touched, reigniting the sparks of heat on Harry’s cheeks that the evening air had begun to calm. Harry didn’t lift his head.
It was easier and far more enjoyable than he’d thought it would be. He hadn’t realised that he’d contemplated what sucking cock would be like – but once he was doing it, he found himself comparing it to his expectations: yes, I knew it would taste this good. No, I didn’t realise my jaw would ache like this.
Harry liked Healer Brisley. Over the last four months, he’d seen a great many Healers and experts and various other interested parties, and not all of them were as good-natured as she was. But given how slowly his case had progressed, he did occasionally wonder whether key information hadn’t been lost somewhere in the piles of parchment that littered her office. Four months was surely too long. To Harry, it was a lifetime.
At any other time, Harry probably would have agreed. Spending two weeks with nothing to do but relax and enjoy the summer sounded heavenly, but…
It’s funny—I know Harry’s face better than my own, I reckon. I’ve seen him basically every day for the last seventeen years. He’s on every front page, poster and commemorative bloody plate. A witch came into Wheezes last week who had a tattoo of him on her left tit. She asked me to sign it. It wasn’t even the first time that has happened.
“Let me–” Harry steadied him, held him still, and fucked upwards properly – a long, deep stroke that made them both moan.
Perhaps Luna had been off the mark with the compliment tip; it was the third one Harry had given in the last ten minutes, and Draco still wasn’t cheered.
He had learned quickly that people had a certain way of saying his name – like it was important, an in-joke that Harry didn’t understand. He’d been told of the War and his role in it, but the way people talked about him like he was some fictional hero, especially when he couldn’t remember actually doing anything – it was annoying.
It took a second for Draco to understand, but he nodded. Harry eased his fingers out and helped Draco up. Draco leaned heavily against him, the tea-pine-potions scent Harry knew so well mixing with the heavy smell of sweat and the sharp tang of sex. Harry couldn’t help but kiss him again. His tongue was cold. He’d been dragging in desperate breaths through his mouth.
He hurried through them and followed the path to the ridiculously huge venue that Malfoy had chosen. A person in buttercup yellow robes was waiting for him by the building’s impressive entrance. Harry’s glasses were too splattered with rain to see who it was, but he knew. Luna.
“Mmm, you’re right. You had better go in before you really are late,” she said, blinking her large eyes at him. “And if you think he looks nice, you should tell him. He’s very nervous, and he responds well to compliments.”
Draco glanced at the sink. “Yes,” he said awkwardly. “It— After a hectic night, I like to— It’s quite relaxing, really.”
“Please,” he said softly. He reached out a hand to Harry’s arm. Harry shied away from it. “I swear to you, I never lied to you. Everything I said was true. Everything. You can go to the Apothecary right now and get some Veritaserum and I’ll take it, you can ask me anything.”
“Nothing,” he said quickly. “It was nothing. Notes on another patient. I couldn’t let you see them – confidentiality.” His eyes were wide and wary. “How much did you read?”
“Hey—!” Harry says, but the protest dies in his throat when Draco leans forwards and puts his hand on Harry’s thigh. The light from the TV paints his pale fingers yellow, then green. He squeezes, and sparks of ice and heat tingle under Harry’s skin. Harry’s legs widen.
Honestly, Harry didn’t recall the incident Malfoy was referring to. He’d spent half of eighth year in a haze of dizzying relief that it was all over; he’d spent the other half having nightmares and getting angry at everyone and everything. He’d been especially angry with himself. He still was.
Harry’s chest squeezed. “It’s still me,” he said. He reached out a hand to Malfoy without thinking. Malfoy strode forwards and almost took it, before he thought better of it. He coughed.
He’s trying to convince himself, the alternative too much to even contemplate. But when he finds the second scroll of parchment, the incantation is still there.
“Hermione wouldn’t let him tell me why,” Harry continued. “But I reckon it might be to do with the fact that you were a Death Eater. Am I close?”
“But you look so delicious all tied up,” Harry said, feinting left so Draco ducked right then meeting him with another volley of pecks. “How am I supposed to resist kissing you all over?”
Harry is beautiful, his mouth open, his lips full, frowning in concentration as he fucks Draco and me both with long, slow thrusts.
“Oh, nah, nothing like that.” He grins at me conspiratorially. “But it’s awkward as hell telling someone you want to have sex with them, but you don’t want to have sex with them as often as they want you to.”
There was a flash and a loud crack, and a wizened old house-elf appeared next to him. He yelped again and jumped backwards. The elf peered up at him over a snout-like nose.
A tsunami of noise and colour burst forth. It crashed over them, filling the room in an instant. It was much like the time Malfoy had opened his mental doors to show Harry his fantasies, but multiplied a thousandfold – these were all of Harry’s memories, twenty-seven years of them, and they were fighting to have him remember them.
“Waiting outside?” Harry scrambled to his feet. “But I–” Horrifyingly, his voice cracked. “Aren’t you going to come with me?”
,” – and somewhere in the back of his mind, he dimly recalls the first time Malfoy ever called him that. It was supposed to be an easy job, the sort of thing Robards routinely assigned to new Aurors, the sort of thing that wouldn’t get them into trouble.
“God.” Harry kissed Draco again, then lay on his back in Draco’s spot on the bed. It was still warm from the heat of him. Harry was too hot, sweat prickling over his skin, but he relished the echo of Draco’s body on the soft sheets.
“So go for a walk at the same time every day and have your house-elf bring you a cup of cocoa before bed!”
“It’s not your scar.” Ron said quickly, reassuringly. “It’s nothing like that. You lost your memory for a bit. For a few months. Do you remember?”
When the reply arrived, another cup of tea later, it was in the form of a blank parchment. Harry, used to receiving letters in this form, cast the revealing charm without a second thought.
Malfoy let out a whimper and a voice in Harry’s head reminded him that Malfoy was obviously going through some shit, that Harry shouldn’t be doing this, that he didn’t even like Malfoy, that he had a case to solve, that he was with Ginny. Harry ignored all of this and yanked Malfoy closer.
“How do I know you’re not actually a fantasy? How do I know you’re not going to fade away in another few minutes?”
But I can’t help but notice Harry is moving closer—much closer than our usual friendly proximity—until there’s only an inch or so between us. I feel stupid, just standing here. I can’t for the life of me think what to do with my hands.
Harry had grown used to it in the last ten years; Ginny had not. She had tried to get Harry to move, to buy another place with his endless amounts of gold, but Harry refused, stubbornly unwilling to part with something so closely tied with Sirius in his mind. He couldn’t bear the thought of someone else living there, someone else sleeping in the room that Sirius had grown up in, someone else cooking in the kitchen he had moped in.
He reached out to Malfoy in his mind and started when Malfoy grabbed his hand again in the physical world.
, and those jeans show it off in a way she’d probably be embarrassed about, if she knew. She always thought I was being polite, when I told her how sexy she was. Funny, isn’t it, how clever people can be so stupid about themselves.
Draco was sitting tall, his head hanging backwards, the collar of blue and charcoal a possessive ring around the long line of his neck. His eyes were closed. His mouth was open in a silent
“Well, by all means, if you feel your time would be better spent out in the field assisting the Aurors, you know where the door is.”
With a monumental effort, Harry lifted himself onto his knees, separating their bodies. He rested his forehead on Draco’s heaving chest.
The great wooden doors slammed open and two giggling women—the Greengrass sisters, possibly—burst through. They stopped dead when they saw Harry and Draco. The younger one’s eyes flicked to their laps. No—to their hands, which Harry belatedly realised were still joined. Draco straightened, tried to pull his hand away. Harry held on. He wasn’t entirely sure why.
Potter lets out a rough, desperate cry. His back arches, his whole body tenses and he’s coming, ropes of it shooting over his stupid gorgeous chest and that’s it, Draco is destroyed. Orgasm crashes over him, blinding him, deafening him, narrowing his whole world to his pulsing cock and Harry Potter’s clenching arse.
He took a deep breath and leant forwards. Draco followed Harry’s lead immediately, as if he’d been waiting for Harry to move first. There was a strange pressure at the back of Harry’s mind, an urge to get
“Yes,” the elf said slowly, then looked away and added in an undertone, “Although Kreacher still doesn’t trust her, oh no, not at all. What Kreacher’s poor Mistress would say if she knew someone of” – a resentful glance – “
“Nearly Headless Nick,” Harry said, confused. What did that have to do with his memories? Was Malfoy going to hand him off to a ghost next?
happy. So there they stayed. They stayed, and lived with the gloominess, and argued about it every three months like clockwork.
“Shut up and stay where you are,” Hermione snapped. To Harry’s great surprise, Malfoy sat down again immediately.
“Yes, but ‘Practical Mind Magic Instructor’ doesn’t have the same ring to it.” He grinned at Harry, and Harry again felt that strange urge to reach out to him, to move closer.
“How did you find the process? Did you experience anything unusual while you were putting the space together? Any strange sights, sounds, sensations?”
Malfoy shifted and Harry’s hands dropped to Malfoy’s hips. He yanked Malfoy forwards – instinctively, automatically – and the hard line of Malfoy’s dick ground into him. Harry swore into Malfoy’s mouth and pulled him closer so that Malfoy could feel him too, could feel exactly what he was doing to Harry, what he had done to him for weeks–
He’d complained to Ron and Hermione about it, once. To his surprise, they had both burst out laughing.
He gazed fondly after her until she and Mr Arrington left through the Muggle entrance. Then he turned, and caught sight of Harry.
Malfoy’s smile faltered. He cleared his throat and laced his fingers together. His right thumb rubbed at the thick silver ring. “Homework,” he said.
Unwillingly, I remember how that cock felt in my hand, hot and hard, as Harry and I fucked him. I remember the glint of his nipple piercing as he rode me. The regret of not being able to suck it into my mouth.
Harry could still hear his own heartbeat as they settled into their chairs. It pounded in his ears, pulsing at the back of his skull. His dick pressed painfully against his trousers, but he ignored it. He’d said he’d let it go after one kiss. It was much more difficult now he’d done it, now he knew what it was like, how Malfoy came alive, the noises he made, what Malfoy’s tongue felt like against his. But Harry had said he’d let it go.
It suddenly occurred to Harry that perhaps he should be worried about the whole Legilimency thing. Ron and Hermione had seemed awfully tense yesterday after his first session with Malfoy. And how had Ron phrased it? Malfoy would be “forcing his way into Harry’s brain and rifling around”?
Potter to be looking at him. He’s sick of people looking at him. He just wants to keep his head down, get his NEWTs and disappear. Yet people won’t stop
“I was under the impression that you were taking advantage of my considerable knowledge of Mind Magic to attempt to regain your memory,” Malfoy said coldly.
Malfoy snorted. “I’ve never heard it described so eloquently. Usually I’m told my mental presence evokes the scent of a spiced Earl Grey tea.”
Harry didn’t feel he quite deserved Malfoy’s disapproval. “I did try!” he protested. “But then I, er … I fell asleep.”
“Feel free,” Malfoy said. “Though if we can move away from the subject of my father, this might go better –
Malfoy splayed his hand on the table. Harry stared at it. “Listen,” Malfoy said. “Do not preoccupy yourself with the time limit.”
“I assure you, he’s fully committed to Mr Potter’s case,” Healer Brisley said. “In fact, that’s why I invited you to come in today. He’s cleared a few hours to discuss the case with you. In fact – oh, dear me, is that the time already? He should be here any minute!”
Harry tried to keep his voice casual. “Because of our history? Because we didn’t like each other when we were twelve?”
“Healer Malfoy thinks Mr Potter is ready to take the final step in his recovery!” she trilled at Ron and Hermione, as if Harry wouldn’t have told them why they were there.
“Er, no,” Harry said, realising Hermione was still waiting for a response. “It’s fine. My head just feels … messy.”
“No,” he says shortly, and the charm reacts immediately: Potter nods, slides his hand smoothly around to Draco’s back, down to his arse, tugging him forwards into a soft kiss that washes away the past like blood sluiced down a drain. The touch of Potter’s bare stomach against his is electrifying, and Draco forgets about
Draco inclined his head. “Well—‘poor’ is rather a strong way of putting it, of course. We had enough to be getting on with, but many of my father’s connections and investments had been lost, and my mother and I were rather eager to gut the entire Manor and start afresh. After that, we estimated we had about five years of comfortable living before we needed to worry.”
“There you go.” Malfoy looked down his nose. “Now you know you’ve walked through a ghost, eaten Gillyweed and held a Quaffle and a crystal ball. Is that what you wanted?”
,” Harry pleaded, and if Draco had been touching himself, he knew without a doubt that he would have come at his name sounding like that in Harry’s mouth. He let go of Harry’s dick and clenched his hands in the bedsheets, pressing his forehead into the inside of Harry’s spread thighs. But it was difficult to regain control of himself when Harry’s skin burned hot against him, when the salt of Harry’s pre-come lingered on his tongue, when he knew that Harry’s cock was
“God.” His past self had done more in two weeks than Harry had managed in four and a half months. Each day had at least six things listed – so many unfamiliar names and places. There was a painful tug in Harry’s gut. These days, he considered it a busy day if he stopped at the shop on the way home from lunch.
.” He lifts his unscarred arm from where it was squashed beneath him and settles it under his head. His soft cock shifts against my leg. “I just think it’s a conversation you should probably have. He won’t notice otherwise.”
Malfoy looked genuinely regretful, which was about the most stupid thing that Harry had ever seen. He shook his head vehemently. “You shouldn’t have had to mention it at all! And I certainly had no right to make such a fuss about it. You have no obligation to share personal details like that, you’re at work–”
Draco nodded, and Harry kissed him. It was slower, softer—an apology for the unexpected Apparition, maybe—and, fuck, it sent desire dripping through Draco like honey.
“Potter.” Malfoy glanced at the clock on the wall and deflated a little, as if he’d been hoping Harry would be late. “Right on time,” he said grudgingly.
“I’m heading home anyway,” Malfoy said smoothly, getting to his feet. “It was an unexpected pleasure talking to you, Granger.”
Even aside from the chandelier, Malfoy’s money drips from every corner of the room. The walls are covered with a thick  wallpaper—cream with a winding gold pattern—that is so very different from the scuffed paint and chipped plaster I’m used to. The soles of my trainers squeak against the polished wooden floor and—god—there’s a giant star-shaped fur rug at the end of the four-poster bed that I suspect used to be a Quintaped.
“I’m gonna fuck you,” Harry murmurs in his ear. “I’m gonna fuck you and I’m gonna bite you and I’m gonna suck you
“Maybe Mrs Weasley will have made me some for Christmas,” Harry said, attempting a grin, fully aware of how Draco felt about Harry’s collection of Weasley knitwear.
“I said your name three times,” Malfoy said, amused. He gestured to the seat across from Harry. “Mind if I join you?”
Malfoy was writhing, squirming, desperately trying to meet Harry’s punishing thrusts but lacking the leverage to do anything but dig his heels into Harry’s back. His head was thrown back – then lifted, Malfoy’s heated gaze raking over Harry – then thrown back again with a groan as Harry pounded in especially hard, Malfoy’s neck bared, the entire length of him stretched out, all Harry’s for the taking. And Harry did take – hard and fast and hot and deep and
Visions of a long, luxurious afternoon spent with Malfoy vanished as quickly as they had appeared. But tomorrow – tomorrow was okay. Tomorrow was more than okay.
“I’m uncomfortable,” he complains. “I love a post-fuck cuddle as much as the next person, but I also need to
“Right,” Malfoy said, snapping the notebook closed. “If you’re willing, firstly I’d like to test your recall speed of the things you do remember. I’m going to ask you some questions, and I’d like you to answer as quickly as possible.”
Harry’s stomach sank at the onset of the old argument. He tried to think of a believable excuse to leave.
But despite his efforts, they definitely weren’t as close as this when he nodded off, sometime between
“Been thinking about this ever since you left,” Malfoy gasped into Harry’s mouth. He pulled on the back of Harry’s head so Harry was dragged forwards, pushing Malfoy back onto the bed. “Fuck, I couldn’t get you out of my head for one minute. I can’t believe you came back.”
Fuck, this charm. Draco’s mouth waters. He wants to taste him. He needs to taste him. He’ll never be able to look the real Potter in the face again, but the real Potter never pays him any attention anyway. Draco licks his lips, takes a steadying breath that doesn’t steady him at all, and takes Potter’s cock into his mouth.
The officiwizard cleared his throat. “You can let go now,” he said kindly. “Look, the bind has gone. The ritual is over.”
Potter stumbles to his bed – three over from Draco’s – with one hand out, feeling his way, the other still covering his glasses.
“While I appreciate you coming back, I think you should consider working with another Mind Healer. It wouldn’t be ideal after the work we’ve done together, but I cannot in good conscience recommend continuing with me when I’ve proven that I – I cannot remain professional with you.”
“There would be other signs if you were approaching any sort of deadline,” Malfoy continued. “Changes in your thought patterns, your physiology. So don’t worry about it.”
On those nights, Harry’s insides warm from alcohol and companionship, he didn’t really mind that none of the solutions St Mungo’s had suggested had worked. It wouldn’t be so bad to start afresh if he had Ron and Hermione by his side.
Malfoy saw the gesture and shot out a hand. ”Wait, listen, please! I didn’t know! I’m telling the truth!”
“Nonsense,” Malfoy sniffed. “Your new homework is to sort things out with them. First thing tomorrow.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said. Harry was concentrating very hard on a spot on the wall, but could see out of the corner of his eye that Malfoy was still staring.
“You’re insufferable in literally every form, aren’t you?” Draco says automatically, but he doesn’t mean it, not really, certainly not when Potter snickers and mouths kisses along his jaw, his hand still wrapped around Draco’s, warm and comforting and heartbreaking.
Malfoy waved a hand. “The entire last two months has been a key stage,” he said. “Anything after the first week was a key stage. There’s no good time to heroically go it alone.”
“Fuck,” he gasped, staring at Malfoy. He remembered this from last time, too – Malfoy pink, panting, euphoric.
Malfoy snorted. “Yes, it’s a yes, you tireless arsehole.” He waved an impatient hand. “Lead the way.”
“You also can’t unlearn facts by extracting the memories of when you learned them. You’ll remember the fact even if you don’t remember how you know it.”
“Let me,” he repeated. His fingers lingered over the pale scar that ran from Draco’s collarbone to the base of his ribs. “Let me take care of you. You took care of me for months. It’s my turn.”
“I was worried that I’d imagined you,” Malfoy told him, seemingly completely unconcerned about his new constraints and state of undress. “Or that I had let all those years of fantasising about you twist my memory. But fuck, no, you’re genuinely like this.” He pushed his hips up so Harry couldn’t fail to see his hard, pink cock lying against his belly.
.” They were both squinting from the effort of maintaining eye contact. “Fuck, fuck, I’m— Draco, I’m—”
“Please, don’t mention it.” The words sounded automatic. Malfoy must get patients thanking him all the time. “It was my pleas– I mean, it was no trouble.”
“No, half past. Did he tell you one? Well, it’s a good thing, I suppose. You look like you flew here—you didn’t, did you?!”
Malfoy had told him to rest on Sunday, but despite the lack of sleep, Harry had never felt more restless. He showered, dressed and had breakfast as normal, and was outside Malfoy’s office door at quarter to ten.
“I knew it,” Harry crowed. “I knew Ron was exaggerating. All that nonsense about the headmaster – about Hermione–”
Draco has built up this charm in his head for months, yet the incantation is so simple. Two words. He mouths them to himself until he’s confident he has the syllables right. He casts a
In the five months that Harry could remember, erections were not a problem he’d had to deal with. He would have almost been grateful if they were – the occasional wank would have helped break up the tedium of his repetitive days. But every explorative touch had been met with stout disinterest, and eventually Harry had stopped trying. Something to do with his memory loss, he assumed. It didn’t really bother him.
“I don’t get it.” Harry swallowed against the break in his voice. “What do you want me to … do? With you?”
I look desperately for Hermione. Everyone else automatically left the two seats facing us empty—one for her, one for Malfoy—but she’d apparently rather clear off somewhere with Parkinson than rescue me from my big mouth and stupid questions.
“Malfoy,” Harry says. His voice is different, lower, melodious. Malfoy blinks slowly and drops his gaze to Harry’s mouth.
“Well, I remember…” Potter paused. Did he get the same spark of pride and happiness from saying that phrase that Draco got, hearing it from him? “In sixth year. I accidentally overheard Snape saying that Bellatrix taught you Occlumency.”
“Fuck,” Potter says, his voice ragged. His thighs are quivering beneath Draco’s hands. “You – Draco,
Harry tapped his fingers on the bar while Malfoy handed over the gold. He cast a longing look over his shoulder at the fireplace, but grudgingly decided he should stay until Malfoy was in the room, just to make sure Tom didn’t actually lead him out to sleep in the street.
“Thank you again, Mr Fryer,” Draco said, but the officiwizard was already out of earshot, scurrying over to join Hagrid at the buffet table.
“So,” he said, lacing his fingers together and regarding Potter with his head tilted at a careful, open, interested angle. “How has it been, these last few weeks? You said you were fully signed off by Brisley?”
Harry concentrated, and the Leaky Cauldron vanished, replaced by his bedroom at Grimmauld Place. Harry was stretched out on the bed, staring at the ceiling.
“Not at all. You’re right on time,” Luna said with a serene smile. As soon as she finished speaking, bells began to peal from some indeterminate point in the clouds above their heads.
Harry tried to focus his attention away from post-duel Malfoy’s pink-tinged cheeks and thought about it. The way Hermione and Ron had talked about Legilimency, he had expected it to be painful – or at least uncomfortable, like the defensive prickles that rose around him during a Diagnostic Charm. But Harry didn’t feel anything at all.
“You’re sure this is the right door?” Malfoy pressed. “Take a moment to look around at the others. Count them. Focus on each one in turn. You’re sure it’s this one?”
“Wait, don’t say anything,” Potter interrupted. “Because you always do that with your hands when you’re trying to keep me out and I just want to make sure you’re clear on where I stand.”
Harry had never put much thought into the concept of marriage. He had never really pictured himself as a husband, living a domestic life with someone he wanted to be with forever. So it was quite a surprise when he found himself grieving, over the next few months, for the future that had been snatched away from him.
of understanding, then he bursts out laughing. I’m a little offended—it’s a fair question! I’m just making sure my best mate is being looked after in his relationship!
Potter swears. His hands shoot down to cover his dick – his real, actual dick that Draco actually had in his real, actual mouth.
Malfoy looked at him, turning his head but not the rest of him. His face looked as tired as Harry felt, but his movements betrayed no signs of fatigue when he came closer to Harry. A bit too close, actually. He reached up to touch the fabric of the robe covering Harry’s chest.
Another night, another dinner at a pub. They had exhausted themselves trying to find a new place to eat every time none of them wanted to cook and so: they were back in the Leaky Cauldron.
Harry paused. It hadn’t made sense before, why Draco agreed to the wedding when he lived as a Muggle, when he didn’t even notice his magic disappearing.
“Before we start working with Mind Magic, you are welcome to use my Pensieve to store any thoughts or memories you wouldn’t want me to see.” Malfoy gestured to the dark wooden cabinet that lined the left wall.
had not been as clear. Draco had caught himself snapping and sneering in a way he’d never, ever do with another patient—and had found himself, mortifyingly, faced with Harry’s polite confusion, even hurt.
He drops to his knees, raises fumbling fingers to the buttons of Potter’s trousers. Potter’s hand slides into his hair.
“Yeah,” I growl, tightening my grip. He’s going to have bruises tomorrow. I wonder if I’ll get to see them. I wonder if he’ll like it, being able to see the smudge of my thumb on his hipbone.
It was like he had been handed one of the delicate silver baubles from the Christmas tree downstairs. Harry felt clumsy, sure that one wrong move would shatter this moment, would ruin everything. He slid his hand into Draco’s hair to hide the trembling of his fingers, and Draco made a low noise of approval. His lips parted under Harry’s. Harry’s knees went weak. He was lost.
The house was big, and several hours later found him at the back of the kitchen, rifling through drawers. He had, at this point, learned several things about Harry Potter, whoever he was – mainly that he had dozens of crumpled letters (all of which concluded with dozens of unfamiliar signatures) stuffed into every drawer in the house. But he still had no idea who he himself was or how he had come to be there. If there was an owl in the house that he could use to reply to the letter from Hermione, he had yet to find it.
Parkinson couldn’t know the gift she’s actually given him. A fantasy. Thirty minutes where he won’t need to hunch under the weight of his past. Thirty minutes where he can act without thought or consequence or shame – where he can just
“Potter.” The sound of Draco’s snapping fingers dragged Harry’s attention from the parchment. “Are you listening? I said, are you nearly ready to go?”
“We’re in a quiet room having a private conversation; this is exactly the same as usual,” Harry said. “You want to know if I mean it? Take a look.” He sat back and spread his arms, watching Malfoy through his lashes.
“I had a purple pickled pepper flavoured one,” Harry added. “And one that tasted a bit like bitter butter. That one was better.”
Draco dimly noted that the lamb was tender and the sauce was rich and buttery, with a tang of orange zest and a hint of rosemary—but honestly, he could have been eating anything. All of his attention was on Potter.
, he suddenly wants to say, but it’s so ridiculous that even in the fantasy, he won’t let the words leave his mouth. He doesn’t know Potter. He’ll never know Potter. He certainly doesn’t
into Harry’s mouth. It’s euphoric, unlike anything Harry ever felt when he was human, and it tips him over the edge too; his grip tightens and he’s growling, forcing his dick as deep as he can, filling Malfoy with his come while Malfoy’s blood fills his mouth, his throat, his body.
Harry stepped closer. Kneeling on the bed as he was, Draco was half a head shorter than him. His face was tilted up, his eyes fixed on Harry.
Another deep moan filled the air, and Harry couldn’t say which of them had made it. He dug his fingernails into the flesh of Malfoy’s thighs and finally, finally let loose, fucking Malfoy with abandon.
“Maybe I’ll bite you, let your blood soak into your pretty white shirt until it’s red and dripping, and then I’ll wear it.” Harry groans at the thought. “God, it would drive me mad. You drive me mad.”
. Draco shudders. The movement is so severe that he chokes and he pulls off, gasping for air. Pre-come and saliva drip down his chin. Potter is looking at him like he’s the most brilliant thing he’s ever seen. Draco drinks it in with watering eyes.
“Shh, you’re okay,” Harry says. He manoeuvres Malfoy around, props him against the pillows. “You’re okay. Here, drink this.”
. Never mind that it’s not real, that it’s the product of ten Galleons spent in the back room of a joke shop. It feels real – it feels
A breath. Then two. Then – “So, since we’re here,” Harry said, the words spilling from him without his permission. “Fancy a drink?”
Harry, please – God, you’re – You’re going to have to stop, you’re gonna make me come – You’re gonna make me come in your mouth,
“Unbelievable.” But Draco couldn’t quite hide his smile. “Yes, she taught me. A similar method that you first learned with, from what I can gather.”
For the first time since he was sixteen years old, Draco struggled to maintain the Legilimency connection, struggled to keep his eyes open and his mind focused. Harry’s pleasure swam through him, slipping into his body, over his skin, around his cock.
Harry is struck by the gesture. Ever since their magic was restored, Harry has been casting spells for everything he can think of, but Draco almost never draws his wand. His avoidance of magic during his life in Wales was one topic they didn’t cover during their coffee-shop confab.
And yet despite that, despite Malfoy’s initial snappiness, Harry had every intention of going back. He couldn’t say that he’d particularly liked Malfoy, but he was intrigued. Malfoy had managed to learn in just a few questions that Harry could see Thestrals, which meant that Harry had seen someone die. Harry could have guessed that, given the things he’d been told, but he hadn’t known for sure. He’d had made more progress that morning than in the last two months put together.
Harry blinked. “Not much,” he said, then when Malfoy’s panicked look intensified, added, “None of it! I was still thinking about the schedule. What was I doing in France? I didn’t know I was in France.”
Harry nodded, then realised he wasn’t sure how physical gestures worked inside someone else’s mind. “Er, yeah.”
Malfoy took even longer to reply this time. When he finally spoke, his sentences felt heavy, as if he had carefully considered each word. “Since there is no guarantee of finding a culprit,” he said, “and no guarantee that, if such a person did exist, they could reverse what has been done to you, yes. I believe it is worth your while to pursue strengthening your own mental capabilities.”
“A bit, but it’s fine.” Draco shifted, widened his legs to give Harry better access. His bound ankles pressed against Harry’s back. “There are other spells too, you know. For stretching.”
He rolls his shoulders. It feels like a pressure has been lifted from them. He can’t remember the last time he could just
Draco nods, captivated, and follows suit. Potter hesitates with his fingers at his waistband, so Draco goes first, pulling his shirt over his head, emerging with an unpleasant jolt to the sight of the
right now and told you to think of anything but an erumpent, I know exactly what we would both see.”
Their gazes locked, and Draco thought of the way Harry welcomed him in, practically wrapped his mind around Draco’s and pulled him closer each time Draco cast. He’d had patients who’d said they found Draco’s mental presence soothing. He’d never had any who
“Same old,” Harry said. “She dragged in another so-called expert. Their new plan is Legilimency therapy.”
Harry has been tracking Malfoy for hours. The journey has taken him from Munich, through Rosenheim, and now to here, a dark street in outer Salzburg.
Malfoy tugged Harry towards the bed. They fell onto it, Malfoy on his back, his legs spreading easily so Harry was on top of him, pressing him into the mattress. Malfoy made a keening sound and pressed his hips upwards, and any doubts Harry had that Malfoy might not be enjoying himself promptly vanished.
Malfoy opened his mouth. Closed it again. “Resisting temptation is not a skill of mine,” he said eventually.
Harry has tried to tell Malfoy, over and over, just how close Harry came to killing him the night Harry became a vampire. He tried to explain five days afterwards, when Malfoy came to Harry’s hospital room at two in the morning and offered Harry his neck. He tried to explain twenty minutes after that, when they’d both rutted themselves to completion and lay panting, covered in blood – when Malfoy’s life had been saved again, this time not by Ron Weasley and a well-aimed
“I believe,” Malfoy said slowly, “that in your case, recovering your memories is not dependent on identifying the cause of their disappearance.”
“Mmm.” Draco remembered well having his mind forced open, the sound of Bellatrix’s cackling laugh, the pain of his knees hitting the floor of his father’s study, over and over, until he could barely hold eye contact with her through his tears—but she managed to get in anyway, every time. “It’s not a method I favour, personally.”
were blurring again. The wary stiffness that this version of Potter had carried when they’d been in public had vanished. He was loose again.
Draco was not prepared for this. He thought Potter would dirty talk into his ear for half an hour while Draco touched himself. Never in his wildest dreams did he think that he would ever be able to have – that he would ever deserve the chance, even the fictional one–
Harry filled his mind with the image of Hogwarts, of his Defence classroom, of Hagrid’s hut with smoke curling from the chimney, and tried to loosen his rigid muscles.
Harry frowned. He himself had just started to have a good time—and while Draco wasn’t stomping around, scowling (which was Harry’s personal go-to when it came to expressing discontent), it was obvious that something was up: he had never before—not once, not since they’d met in Madam Malkin’s when they were eleven years old—been polite to Harry.
“I…” It was absurd, the dizzying relief that came from knowing he’d see Draco again before the New Year.
“You were so slippery this time,” Harry murmurs. Talking helps to keep himself in check, helps to remind him that he’s still a person with a brain, even if he no longer has a heart. “I almost lost you halfway through. What did you do? Did you fly?”
The jumbled puzzle pieces in my head clunk into place, forming an impossible picture. My face burns.
“Did somebody send you to my house the other day?” Harry clarified. He wiped his mouth with his free hand. Malfoy’s eyes followed the motion.
He left Malfoy’s room at the Leaky Cauldron without waking him and Apparated from the stairwell straight to the Ministry. He rushed through the permits he needed to round up the final suspects and by four o’clock in the morning, they were all in custody. Soon after dawn, the case was as good as closed. Harry took the Floo back to Grimmauld Place and collapsed into bed. He was asleep within minutes.
The crumble did sound good, and the thought of it distracted Ron enough that the topic of Legilimency therapy was dropped in favour of a debate over the merits of custard versus ice cream as the superior crumble accompaniment and Hermione’s odd behaviour quickly faded from Harry’s mind. By the time they were polishing off their second helpings of crumble (Hermione: custard, Harry: ice cream, Ron: both), all three of them were in good spirits.
that stopped him. Not for any noble reason – not the reminder of his regular life, nor a stark headline making him pause to appreciate what he had. No, it was the date atop the paper that gave him pause: the 25th. He had slept an entire day away.
“It’s just an idea. No pressure, obviously,” Harry says quickly. “I just thought—after that kiss. And you said you thought Draco was attractive.”
“Really take note of the sensations,” Malfoy murmured. “And compare it to the next memory. Hold on.”
A sharp elbow to the ribs jolted Harry from his trance. He scowled at Ron; Ron rolled his eyes and nodded towards the front of the room.
Harry spent the rest of the day with Ron and Hermione. By the time he went back to Grimmauld Place, he was warm, happy and extremely well-fed. He had forgotten, over the last few weeks, just how grateful he was for them. How much he appreciated that they still cared for him despite that, without his memories, he wasn’t really the friend they’d had since childhood.
Draco makes a small, pained noise as the second finger slides inside. Harry stills, but Draco says, “No, I’m good, it’s good. Don’t stop until I say so.”
Harry fumbles at his flies. Draco’s cock is right there, inches from Harry’s clumsy fingers, flushed and hard, and Draco’s hand is wrapped around it, stroking lazily. Harry falters, his gaze fixed on the movement of Draco’s hand. On the bead of pre-come that grows at the slit. At the way Draco’s thumb swipes over it, spreading it over the head.
“Holy shit,” Potter breathes. Draco shudders, the sound of Potter’s dazed voice as potent as the feeling of his skin beneath Draco’s tongue. “What–?”
“Of course, you remember concepts, don’t you?” Malfoy looked at him then, head cocked. “That includes details about Hogwarts?”
Malfoy. Harry clung to the coolness of him, the sweet, spicy scent of him. His head was bursting, splitting with pain, and his heart was huge and heavy and so desperately, desperately sad. But Malfoy was there, his hand and his mind anchoring Harry to the present. Harry didn’t have to go through this alone. Not again.
Malfoy’s face twisted strangely, then he straightened, his nose in the air. “Well, she’s right,” he said loftily. “I am brilliant.”
Harry forced Malfoy’s head back further. A suggestion of a whimper escaped Malfoy’s throat, yet still he made no move to struggle. God, why was this turning Harry on so much? It was hardly the first time he’d interrogated a suspect off the record, and it had certainly never affected him in this way before.
Harry yanked out a strand of hair and held it up; on his right, Malfoy did the same. The officiwizard peered at them, nodded, then conjured a small stone bowl that hovered in front of him. He waved his wand again, twirling it over the bowl, and began to murmur a long, flowing incantation. A bright, sparkling liquid poured from his wand into the bowl.
“What is that?” Harry asked. “It’s sort of … not like a gingery flowery lemony smell, but also … that’s exactly what it’s like. What is it?”
In response, Harry yawned widely and closed his eyes. “I’ll tell you later,” he said. “So how does it work?”
His bedroom at Grimmauld Place appeared around them before Harry had made the decision to think of it. It was quickly replaced by the downstairs mantelpiece – the rows of photographs on the wall – Kreacher’s bleary eyes peering up at him from the nest of blankets in the kitchen cupboard.
is a work of musical genius. The lyrics are complete nonsense, of course, but that’s Americans for you, isn’t it?” He chuckled. “Yes, I think I will stay, in that case. Very kind of you! And are those Rosmerta’s sausage rolls I see over there? You do know how to put on a party, don’t you? You’re a lucky man, Mr Potter! Yes, I’ll just nip over and join the queue, I think—Excuse me.”
“When we remember things, we tend to overlook the finer details,” came Malfoy’s voice. “We retain a sense of what happened, our recollection emphasising how the events made us feel. This can make it difficult to focus on details. Look at the pages of the notebook.”
“You know,” Harry said, and couldn’t stop the smirk from spilling out. “An Auror whore horror roar aura.”
He falls to his knees in front of Malfoy. Malfoy’s thighs widen, and Harry runs his hands over them. Harry is warm now, yes, but Malfoy is warmer. His skin is hot under Harry’s palms, the hair fine and soft, thickening and darkening at his crotch.
“I’ve been meaning to catch up with you, old boy!” said the man. “The other board members and I think we’re about due another fundraiser – we were hoping to get an update on your schedule for the next few months.” The man paused, taking in Harry’s blank expression. “Ah – so sorry. Am I interrupting?” he asked, looking to Malfoy and back again.
The lid of the antique chest on Robards’s desk sprang open. Distinctly unfriendly sparks of magic crackled from within.
At just the thought of the scent of Earl Grey, Harry felt his face heat with the memory of last night. He was grateful that Hermione was still nose-deep in the cupboard. “Erm, no thanks. Just normal tea is fine.” He sat somewhat awkwardly at the kitchen table.
around our half of the table. “We weren’t exactly decent when she arrived, which made the situation extra mortifying.”
Malfoy turns his head blindly and they fall into a kiss – open-mouthed, sloppy. Harry keeps kissing him when he takes himself in hand, lines himself up and pushes, slow and aching, into the burning heat of Malfoy’s body.
Harry hummed and changed the subject, but Malfoy’s face remained clouded. Harry was distracted himself; his eyes caught on the way Malfoy’s hair kept falling out of place, the way his long fingers wrapped around the stem of his empty wine glass, the way his teeth absently chewed at his lower lip. Malfoy’s leg bumped against Harry’s again and Harry completely forgot the ending to the story he’d been telling. He trailed off and laughed awkwardly. Malfoy smiled.
“Poor show, Auror Potter,” Robards said. His prominent salt-and-pepper eyebrows were pinched in disapproval, but Harry just shrugged.
“You,” Harry said. He twisted his wrist and Draco shuddered. “In the restaurant, the way you were talking—what happened to the snotty little shit I knew at school who was fully aware of his own worth?”
“Fine,” Draco says, his fingers tightening on Harry’s thigh for a second before he pulls away. Harry misses the contact immediately. “I’ll meet you there. Two minutes.”
. All of Draco’s vows to keep his cool, to remember who they were, melted into nothing when faced with a Harry Potter who had his memories back and still wanted him.
The spare bedroom was especially unfriendly after Harry’s sentimental day. He only hesitated for a half-second before he scooped up his bedding and took it upstairs to his old bedroom.
For a moment, Malfoy looked lost. “Confusing things,” he admitted. “I’m so used to being the one to apologise. I don’t really know what to … Anyway, it doesn’t matter. If you see Weasley, tell him I’ll reply after work. Let’s get started.”
“Incredibly weird,” Draco said, but warmth crept up his neck. Honestly, he was a bit turned on himself. His wrist still tingled from the feeling of Potter’s hand around it, and—well. Potter really was devastating in those robes. The table had hidden the full effect of them, back in the restaurant, but now Potter’s body stretched out as he leant against the doorframe, casual and thoughtlessly powerful.
My mind flounders at Harry’s command. I do the first thing I can think of, which is grab Draco’s cock clumsily and stroke it. It’s rock hard—hot and velvety against my palm. Pleasure shoots through me, as though I’m wanking myself, not him.
“Good.” Draco aimed a Lubrication Spell at his hand, discarded his wand, then trailed the tip of his finger over Harry’s dick—which jumped at his touch—down to the tight skin of his balls. Harry widened his legs and Draco lowered his finger further, further, until he found the hot furl of Harry’s hole. “Tell me if it hurts.”
Since then, Harry’s Legilimency sessions abruptly stopped being enjoyable. Instead, they were tense and frustrating for both of them, and Harry often staggered out of Malfoy’s office grumpy, drained and achingly, achingly aroused.
Malfoy jumped, his gaze snapping to Harry’s. “Potter.” His voice was almost guilty. “I didn’t expect you to be here. I thought you dined elsewhere now.”
“Thanks,” Harry said. “I appreciate it. But I reckon it’s Malfoy you need to apologise to. He had to hear it all as well.” He tapped his temple.
Draco’s eyes fell closed, a low hum of pleasure escaping him. Harry’s cock was thick and so hard, and the twitches of his hips had stopped immediately once Draco had taken him into his mouth, as though he was forcibly holding himself back from fucking Draco’s throat. Draco drew his mouth upwards and swirled his tongue around the head, savouring the sharp, salty flavour.
Draco didn’t know, and didn’t want to think about it. “Want you to fuck me,” he growled instead. “Or I wanna fuck you. I don’t care which way, I just want—”
“Have you seen how Parkinson is looking at Hermione?” I demand. “She’s practically licking her lips. You’d think she’d be a bit more subtle about it.”
“Wha–?” He wants to ask what Potter could possibly be apologising for, but instead of words, a strange gasping sound escapes him. Potter is on him immediately, his warm hands gripping Draco’s shoulders. Fuck, he’s
“Not made up.” Malfoy arched his back. “There’s no one else, I swear. It’s – fuck! – it’s just you. It’s always been –
Pleasure rolled through him in response—Harry’s pleasure—and Draco felt a sharp sting of pain in his mouth. He’d bitten his lip against the cry that threatened to escape him.
“That’s normal,” Malfoy said. “You were trying to force yourself not to think of something, which will always have the opposite effect. If I were to cast
“I’m going to cast Legilimency,” Malfoy said. God, the weight of his eyes sent shivers down Harry’s spine. “I want you to immediately focus on your mental space, exactly where we were just before the duel. Can you do that?”
“I’m glad to hear it,” Malfoy said softly, but it was in his usual professional tone that he added, “Would you be comfortable showing me?” He raised his wand.
, of Dean laughing till he cried at Seamus’s attempt at breakdancing, at Ginny and George’s straight-faced formal dance to an incredibly upbeat song that seemed to be called
Harry didn’t move for a long moment. He never would have thought in a million years that Malfoy would make such an offer, let alone that Harry would be tempted by it.
The end of the night drew closer, and eventually the pub started clearing significantly enough that it was obvious it was time to leave. Harry didn’t want the night to end, and took his time straightening the still-damp menus and brushing imaginary crumbs from the table once they had stood to go.
Harry had never felt someone else’s hard cock rub against him before. He was only mildly surprised to find how much it turned him on – maybe he’d always known, deep down. Maybe that was why he wasn’t saying no now. Maybe he needed – just once, he needed–
their way directly into his brain. Mostly, he glanced at the letters and threw them aside – an error-ridden reply would raise suspicions, better to not say anything at all – but every now and then, there was a letter that was actually meant for him – that is, the version of him with no memory.
It materialised around them almost without effort on Harry’s part. The four doors still hung open. The fifth door loomed.
Harry cast around for something to say to clarify the situation, but his thoughts were racing too fast to pick out anything coherent. Instead, he nodded at the ribbons. “Slytherin colours?”
Harry looks at him helplessly, desperately missing the feeling of those long limbs wrapped around him, of the hand on his stomach, warm despite the cotton of Harry’s shirt and the chill of Draco’s magic that rose to meet it. “I dunno,” he says. “I just woke up too.”
At Hermione’s prompting, Malfoy talked somewhat reluctantly about the training and research he’d done to become a Mind Healer. Ron stayed mulishly silent. Harry had nothing of interest to contribute, but listened intently for more details about Malfoy’s past.
“I don’t blame you for any of it, you know,” Potter says, and a desperate little noise claws its way out of Draco’s throat. He pulls off his bedsheets, frantically searching for the second scroll, the one that had the incantation on. It was supposed to disappear as soon as the spell was cast. Maybe – Maybe it changed once Draco read it out. Maybe Draco has somehow won a prize – some extra time.
Harry huffed. “You know, I’m getting very mixed messages from you. Sometimes it feels like we’re flirting, like this is going somewhere, but other times it feels like I’m – harassing you, or something. I’m not, am I?”
After a long, frozen moment, memory-Draco transfigured his nose back to normal, nodded tersely to Harry, then turned on his heel and strode away. Draco remembered well what had happened next: he’d gone back to his office and had banged his head on the back of the door until he was worried he’d have to nip to the Non-Magical Injuries Department and have them check for a concussion.
“What? Of course it’s relevant,” Harry snapped. “How are we supposed to fix me if we still don’t know what happened?”
“I remember you saying.” Potter shifted against him. Slotted a knee between Draco’s thighs. “That’s not what this is, though.”
“Harry! I didn’t – So sorry I didn’t stop by earlier – I was just checking to see if you were here so I could apologise.”
He tentatively offered the owl a treat. It took it in its tiny beak and flew off without a backwards glance. He unfurled the scroll.
“It’s awful, when you think about it,” she said. “Quite a lot of Muggles were persecuted during the trials of the 1600s for using the natural healing properties of plants. You don’t need magic to chew on a bit of echinacea, do you? It’s hardly any sort of professional Healing.”
Malfoy fired question after question at him, and Harry almost stopped paying attention, letting himself respond automatically. Malfoy didn’t take any more notes, his quill resting loosely in his hand. He had very nice hands, Harry noted.
Harry had crumpled the letter in his fist. “Back to square one” – that was four whole months wasted. His time was running out.
“I think about kissing you all the time,” Harry said in a low, urgent voice. “Every day. Every time I see you.”
“I think…” Malfoy hesitated. Harry could feel his apprehension, but wouldn’t have needed to have him in his head to know that this was something big. “I think it’s your memory.”
The ache in my chest warps. I clear my throat against the lump that’s threatening to form. I say, “Not just once?” instead of what I really mean, which is,
Harry kissed him again – roughly, deeply, until Draco’s protests melted into those small, delicious noises of approval. Harry drank them up, swallowing each one greedily, then made his way south. He followed the lines of the ribbons with his tongue and raked his teeth over the peak of Draco’s nipple. Draco cursed, arched his back – and Harry licked further, further, ducking under Draco’s thigh until he lay on his stomach between Draco’s spread knees. Draco’s bound ankles rested on Harry’s back.
“Please,” he said scornfully. “There was nothing truthful about it. You don’t need to be noble about this, you know.”
“Gentlemen,” Robards snapped. “I’ll thank you to take this marital spat out of my interrogation room. Moreover”—his moustache twitched in a way that sent shivers sliding sharply down Harry’s spine—“lamentably, Mr Malfoy has managed to make a minor Auror error: although Potter supposes erroneously that your union forces you to be unfit for the trophy, the unfortunate fact is that the persistent existence of the incentive of Employee of the Month is a monumental misconception.”
Groans, from two mouths, in two minds. Harry’s eyes burned into Draco’s—and Draco almost wished he could look at the rest of him, could properly admire the way he shuddered and sweated and spread himself open. But Harry was right; this
Their noses brushed before their mouths touched. Harry waited for it to feel weird, to feel wrong. It never did.
Harry stood, pulling Draco up with him. “There’s a coffee shop down the road. I have Muggle money with me—I’ll get you a frappuccino.”
“You’re so funny, in this brilliant, quiet, clever way. You’re fucking gorgeous, especially when you’re all ruffled like this, like after we duelled. And you’re so stupidly
Harry concentrated. It was, in a way, similar to the intangible Earl Grey scent of Malfoy – more like he was sensing it rather than hearing it. A dull repetitive pounding, coming from somewhere in the back of his mind.
They were both sticky with sweat and come. While his pulse slowed, Harry listened to the traffic from the Muggle street through the window. Sluggishly, it occurred to him to wonder whether the rooms were fitted with Silencing Charms. It would be a problem if the entire inn had heard what had just happened – it wasn’t as if nobody had noticed them arrive together.
Harry nodded and pushed his glasses back onto his face. “If I get my memory back and I’m an arsehole, I won’t be able to get that mad about one kiss. I’ll still remember how much I wanted more.”
“You’re gorgeous. You’re fucking gorgeous,” Harry gasped, barely aware of what he was saying. Draco whined, his cock jumping, and Harry carried on, mindless. “Draco, you – You’re everything. You are. You’re – Fuck,
Harry pushed on Malfoy’s head, his hips thrusting upwards, and groaned deeply. God, but it felt so good. He dragged Malfoy up again and shoved him down. Malfoy let out a long moan and braced himself on his hands, letting Harry manhandle his head and fuck his mouth, his eyes closing in pleasure only to look up at Harry every now and then, their gazes locking.
“I…” Malfoy looked helplessly at his mostly-full glass. His expression was hard to read, but he didn’t look happy.
“Uh-huh,” Harry says, skirting around an awe-struck first-year who stands frozen in the middle of the corridor.
Harry concentrated. The image of the room he’d thought up appeared around him, replacing the dark wood and summer sunlight of Malfoy’s office. Harry let out a quiet noise of surprise – it was strange, seeing a figment of his imagination look so real.
Malfoy was talking shit. “What do you mean, ‘if such a person did exist’? Of course they exist. I just need the Aurors to stop being useless and actually find them!”
Harry grinned around his mouthful. He bobbed his head, and Draco threw his head back and moaned, long and loud. Harry was so turned on that he was stupid with it, but luckily, sucking cock didn’t require much intellect; he dedicated himself to the task, and it wasn’t long before Draco was
“I’m inside you,” Harry repeated mindlessly, digging sweaty fingers into Draco’s sides. “You’re amazing. You’re my favourite person, Draco, fuck – God, so
His hips sped up without his permission, his brain too tangled with Harry’s to have any power over his movements. He felt like he was losing his mind, something that ordinarily would have sent panic shooting through him, but he
He should probably check that Malfoy wasn’t there waiting for him, though. It would be rude not to drop in, just to give his apologies. Harry owed him that much.
it took to get anywhere without magic. By the time he fought his way off the bus outside Hampton Court Palace, he was anxious, sweaty and twenty minutes late.
One of Harry’s fingers traces the rim of Draco’s hole where it is wrapped, hot and tight, around me.
“Good,” Malfoy said. “In that case, I propose we run through a few tests, I will give you a more in-depth explanation about how I expect the therapy to proceed, and you can think the matter over. If you wish to continue, I will see you back here tomorrow for the first Legilimency session. Do you have any issues with that?”
The Head Auror allows pub nights under two conditions. One: at least four team members don’t drink. Two: everyone carries Sobering Solution. Constant vigilance.
“Perhaps he didn’t have a spare twelve hours to dedicate to reading your notes,” Malfoy said wryly, but he was smiling.
Harry did not sleep that night. After months of dormancy, his libido seemed to be making up for lost time. A mere fifteen minutes after his first explosive orgasm, he was hard and aching and ready to go again.
Harry considered Draco Malfoy’s pale, unimpressed face while Hermione snapped a response. There was something intriguing about him. Something in the way he spoke to Harry – none of that obsequious deference that most of the experts Harry met had shown. Instead, he had quiet confidence and a blunt honesty that Harry couldn’t help but like. It didn’t hurt that he bickered easily with Hermione, which Harry associated with Ron, and home, and comfort.
Malfoy fell to his knees. Harry hadn’t realised just how much Malfoy’s appearance had improved, but in that moment it was as if the last month had been wiped away. Suddenly, Malfoy looked awful. He looked terrified.
“I’m not done questioning you.” Harry slowly moved to the foot of the bed and reached down to assess Malfoy’s handiwork.
“Friends, family, honoured guests,” the officiwizard began. Harry’s back prickled with sweat. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two souls: Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
it, Potter’s breath in Draco’s mouth. He can feel all of him, and it’s so much more than he anticipated, so much more than he ever dared to imagine. Potter is unbelievably warm and solid. His skin is smooth against Draco’s face and his lips are soft – although shocked and unyielding.
it, one hand wrapped around the base of Draco’s cock, sucking and licking and slurping and driving Draco wild.
“Is that what you… That wasn’t – it wasn’t me he told,” Malfoy said breathlessly, letting out a cry as Harry thrust in again. “It was Parkinson, she – ah! – she’s with Cunningham. Roger – fuck! – Roger Cunningham. He just completed training last year –
“Not—” Harry starts again. He considers whether this is a good idea for the briefest of moments, then lets himself finish. “Not here,” he says. “My room?”
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up and his elbow slipped off the edge of his desk. “Ah – no,” he said in a strangled voice. “No, we – we did not.” He straightened the papers on his desk again, though they were already piled neatly. “We didn’t get along too well, actually.” He avoided Harry’s eyes. “We were in rival houses.”
“You’re already making me feel good.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arse and pulled him closer, grinding them together. They both groaned.
Harry slowly pulled his hips back, watching as his softening cock slipped out. An ooze of come followed it.
the present,” he said. His voice sounded strange, even through the wood of the door. Harry would almost say he sounded hesitant, but Draco hadn’t been hesitant around Harry since their first awkward month as partners, three years ago. It had been self-assured jibes and haughty smirks ever since.
“Lord, I regret teaching her how to do that,” Hermione said, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I thought it would make it easier to communicate, but she’s been a nightmare all morning. Anyway, you’re here! How are you feeling?”
His voice helped. Harry inhaled. Exhaled. The flashes resolved into a single street – a small, unassuming road, brown brick walls on either side. A handsome man with curly brown hair was waiting for someone next to a green sign with white text:
“How has my …?” Malfoy seemed wrong-footed. He straightened. “Fine. It’s been fine.” His gaze raked over Harry. Harry tried not to squirm under the weight of it.
Harry presses himself flush against me. The heat of him sinks through my shirt. His chest expands and contracts against mine.
He leans in, has closed the distance between them without realising. He’s mesmerised. Malfoy’s breathing is uneven – quietly so, small, tight inhalations that most wouldn’t notice. Each one sends desire searing through Harry, narrows his focus, until he’s no longer aware of the murmur of chatter from the tavern downstairs, nor the sounds of life from surrounding rooms. He’s only aware of Malfoy. Malfoy’s sounds. Malfoy’s smell. Malfoy’s
“Malfoy,” he tried, wrapping his fingers around Malfoy’s thin wrist. “Come on. You don’t mean that.”
Ron appeared to have been thinking along the same lines. “What’s up with you?” he asked her, looking up from the Detonator for the first time.
Draco throws his head back and moans. He grabs Harry’s wrist to hold him in place, and he grinds himself into Harry’s palm. It’s such an unashamed, greedy movement, and Harry has never been more turned on in his life. He can’t stop his own hips from thrusting up against Draco’s arse, and his eyes roll back as his magic reacts. Pleasure curls over his dick, wraps around it like a hot mouth. He thrusts again, Draco’s cock thick against his hand, Draco’s arse delicious against his dick, and they both groan, bodies jerking.
“Mr Potter, Ms Granger,” Healer Brisley said, beaming at the newcomer. “This is Draco Malfoy. He has made many significant contributions to the field of Spell Damage and Mind Healing. Healer Malfoy, this is Ms Granger, and I’m sure you recognise Mr Potter!”
“I must say, it has been rather nice, seeing so much of you these last few months,” Hermione chipped in, suddenly able to hear again. Ron exchanged an amused look with Harry. “You used to be so busy, Harry, we were lucky if we could squeeze in an evening every three months.” She beamed and clapped her hands together. “Anyway! Now that’s sorted, I don’t fancy cooking lunch today – shall we eat out somewhere? Leaky Cauldron?”
Healer Malfoy conjured a chair a reasonable distance from them and sat in it stiffly. A strange silence settled. Harry didn’t mind being the one to break it.
“Mmm, I like hearing you beg,” Malfoy purrs, his tongue licking hot ownership into my skin. “Do it again.”
It was seven fifty-five, and Draco’s stomach churned. This was an awful idea. What had he been thinking?
The warmth of Harry’s hand seeps through the fabric of my jeans and I’m back in that park, on that cold March night. I have the wild urge to grab his wrist and press his palm against my half-hard cock. What would he do if I did? Is that sort of thing allowed, now?
It was a deeply embarrassed Harry that stood to leave at the end of the session, not looking Malfoy in the eye as he made his goodbyes.
“So sorry for the delay, Healer Brisley, Healer Norwood, Healer Rowland, Healer Fiddleton.” Malfoy nodded to each of them in turn. Healer Brisley and Healer Rowland both giggled and blushed. “Completely my fault. How are you feeling, Harry? Can you still hear the knocking noise?” He pressed his hand to Harry’s forehead as if checking his temperature. Harry was sure it was unnecessary, but he was grateful for the contact. The metal of Malfoy’s ring was cold against Harry’s skin.
“What?” I say, valiantly fighting the urge to cover myself again immediately. “Is it the ginger pubes? What did you expect?”
Draco had assumed that he’d kept his covert ogling of Potter over the last few months to a minimum, but now he’s not so sure: Potter’s chest is almost as familiar as Potter’s face. The dusky nipples, the scar on his sternum, the dark line of hair trailing downwards – Draco already knows it intimately, has already imagined how it would feel, how Potter’s nipple would harden under his thumb, how his stomach muscles would tense as Draco’s hand trailed downwards, what the hitch of his breath would sound like as Draco’s fingers followed the line of hair to the buttons of his trousers.
Malfoy is leaning bonelessly against him, but Harry darts to the pile of Malfoy’s clothes and is back in position before Malfoy starts to fall. He shoves the wand into Malfoy’s hand.
When Draco opened his eyes, he was wrapped in thin, winding Gryffindor stripes. He looked at Harry hopefully. “Better?”
“You’re being ridiculous,” Harry snapped. “I’ve told you how embarrassing it is when Malfoy hears your stupid lies about him in my head, and now you’re doing it in person, too? He was dragged into the War when he was a kid, just like the rest of you.”
“It’s hardly advanced Arithmancy,” Draco scoffs, but even so, it’s Harry who makes the first move. He reaches out. Draco steps forward to catch his fingers.
Harry picked up a sticky menu, though he knew every dish by heart. “He wanted to run through some tests first,” he said, scanning through the sandwich selection instead of looking at Ron’s scornful expression. “I’m seeing him again tomorrow morning.”
The hangover rekindled Harry’s ire from the night before. This was all Ron’s fault. How did he have the nerve? The things he accused Malfoy of – yes, Malfoy could be snappy, but Harry was certain he wasn’t evil. He’d got the Dark Mark when he was sixteen years old, not even of age. Where did Ron get off, blaming him for stuff Death Eaters did when Malfoy was a kid?
He hadn’t been thinking at all. As much as he believed – and he did believe – that people could change, that they had all been much too young, when it came down to it, that hadn’t been enough.
But with a beam and a flourish, Molly’s surprise was finally unveiled: a six-tiered masterpiece, with an edible tableau of Harry and Draco’s lives winding up the tiers, culminating in miniature icing-sugar figures of Harry and Draco holding hands, gazing at each other adoringly.
Harry drags his nose over the sweaty dip of Malfoy’s neck, licks at it, doesn’t bite. Not yet. He sits back. Tugs off his shirt.
Malfoy waited while Harry dawdled, a steady presence by Harry’s side, not touching but close enough that Harry could have reached out if he wanted. If he dared.
“Merlin,” Malfoy said. He didn’t take Harry’s outstretched hand. “Fuck. Yes. Okay. I’ll show you. But no matter what I – Nothing can happen. I stand by that. We can’t – act on anything. Okay?” He waited for Harry to nod before raising his wand. “Cast your Shield.”
“Oh.” The world tilted. Maybe Harry was still a little drunk. “And … what was Ron saying about his brother? Did you…? I mean … I know one of them died in the War.”
“Yeah. Bye.” Harry didn’t even look at her. He held Malfoy’s gaze as he backed out of the room. Malfoy slashed his wand and the door slammed in Harry’s face.
“Is… Draco, is that why you put so much effort into today? Why you agreed to it in the first place? For your mum?”
Harry laughed breathlessly. “God, seeing you like this, I almost wanna…” He bit his lip, hooked a leg around Draco’s arse. The head of Draco’s cock pressed torturously against Harry’s hot, slick hole.
“I needed to be drunk to ask the first time, but…” Potter trails off, but his voice is clear. “Draco. Can I kiss you?”
“If that’s all he does, at least it’ll be a short session tomorrow.” Harry attempted a grin. But rather than laugh, Ron straightened, his face thunderous.
Pinning Potter to his bed is its own reward, but the position has other benefits, too – their cocks are trapped between them, Draco’s lined up against the hot line of Potter’s. The sensation is unreal – too real – and Draco grinds downwards, chasing more of it. Potter swears and scrapes his nails down Draco’s back, digs his fingers into Draco’s arse and drags him closer, their cocks sliding against each other, and a high moan escapes Draco. He thrusts his hips again – and again, and again – and rapidly finds himself losing control, thrusting harder and faster, desperate for more heat, more friction, more Potter – always more Potter.
But Draco lunges upwards, and Harry’s answer is lost to the heat of his mouth. The wave of relief I felt before is back tenfold, surging through me. I pour it into Draco’s mouth so it doesn’t escape as something more embarrassing, like a whimper—or a sob.
It was all Malfoy’s fault. The conniving bastard. He’d known all along what he’d been doing, what he needed to say to get Harry’s attention. Harry had been wrong about one thing – it was never about the Paxman case. It had always been about this: the Malfoys’ greed.
