“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be fine. Thank you, Mx Greenfeld.” Harry smiled hesitantly at them.
“As your letters said, this year your rooms will be two person only. They will still be separated by gender, and here I have a list of your room assignments.” Headmistress McGonagall spoke to the group of eighth year students. “First, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter will be in room 6A at the top of the tower…” Draco shot a panicked look at Pansy from across the room. He’d spent the last week worrying almost constantly about who he was going to be roomed with, and somehow the chance of him having to share a room with the man he’d been in love with for years hadn’t even crossed his mind- he rocked back and forth slightly on the balls of his feet and twisted the plastic toy Angela had given him under his sleeve.
“What do you mean?” Draco was concerned by that.
“Alright, then, I guess.” Harry nodded. “Not sure private school’s right for me, like.” He shrugged nonchalantly as Sirius, Remus and even Officer McKinnon laughed.
He swallowed and shook his hands out, not unlike the way I was when I first shut myself into the cupboard. “I’m autistic.”
Harry remained silent and slid Vernon’s plate over to him, piled just as high as Dudley’s had been. Avoiding eye contact, as he knew that would be the fastest way to another violent lashing, he turned back to the stove and began moving the dirty dishes to the sink and wiping up the mess on the countertops with a rag, trying to ignore the angry grumbling of his stomach- it had already been three days since he had last been permitted food. By the time the dishes were clean and put away, his relatives’ plates were all empty. He took them and cleaned them too, putting them away as Vernon stood and clasped Dudley’s shoulder.
Harry looked up at him through thick black lashes. “Really?” Draco nodded and Harry grinned before flipping them over, pressing Draco into the mattress and kissing him hard.
“Takes after his-”
"Of course I will, sweetheart. I'll be back before you know it."
“Do you not have any other family you can go to?”
“I love you too. Now, come on.”
"I- I was back in my cupboard!" Harry's voice was muffled because he didn't remove his thumb from his mouth.
“You were staring at Draco a lot, you know.”
“-must be Teddy.”
"They absolutely were not. There is nothing about age regression that makes you a 'freak'. If you met another little would you think they were a freak?"
“Freak Addams! A strong name! My name is Gomez, and me and my wife Morticia,” Gomez’ eyes went vaguely misty thinking about his Cara Mia. “Will be your mother and father now.”
“Alright. Where do you want to go?” Draco took hold of Teddy’s pram and smiled at Harry. Harry felt his heart flutter at the soft smile.
“Only for like, 5 seconds! Hey, I didn’t know!” Harry tried to defend himself.
He wasn’t sure how long he laid there, his sense of time was always skewed when he had a migraine, but his bedroom door opened, letting in light that made Harry screw his face up painedly.
, he added on silently.
could have
“Freak Addams!” Professor McGonagall shouted and a hush befell the room, before heated muttering broke out- an Addams at any magic school was rare, made even rarer by the ‘Addams Clause’ written in to every school charter to prevent any more than one Addams being at each school at a time (Beauxbatons had, thanks to his sister Wednesday, decided last year to never allow another Addams into their school again- the family were so proud.) and given that Freak, the second youngest Addams currently, was already fourteen, and Pubert was lined up to go to Ilvermorny, they had hoped that they wouldn’t have any Addamses this generation- however, Freak had simply chosen to start a few years late in favour of apprenticing with Grandmama first.
"Harry? Harry, mate, are you alright?" Ron swung his long legs off of his bed and made his way over to Harry's. Harry looked up, his eyes glassy and damp as a new wave of sobs wracked his petite body, his thumb stuck in between his lips. "Okay, what's up, mate?" Ron knew something was off about how Harry was reacting- he'd never seen him like this, but he didn't know what to do beyond trying to comfort him. He sat down on Harry's mattress and wrapped one long, pale arm around Harry's slender shoulders, pulling him into a hug.
“Yeah, or we could share.” Harry’s voice was soft again.
“What?” Draco grabbed his weighted blanket from his trunk and heaved it onto his bed, smoothing it out as best he could. He’d had it since just before second year when his mother had caught him under a pile of all the heaviest cloaks from his wardrobe.
“Well, if you want to go back, I’m only taking Potions, Transfiguration and Arithmancy, so I’ll have plenty of free time to help out still.” Draco’s cheeks pinked as he thought about how much he already didn’t want to lose the fragile home he’d found with Teddy and Harry.
Harry groaned. “I want to complain about that, but if it means I can go back to school with Teddy I can’t even be mad about it.”
“I, uh, heard you playing, so I wanted to come see who it was.” Harry grinned sheepishly and ran one square, brown hand through his already messy hair.
“Shit. Shit man, I’m so sorry. Why?”
“Because I love you, and you’re important to me, and I don’t want you to struggle on your own when I could be helping.” Harry’s brown cheeks were flushed red at his confession, and he loosened his arms around Draco in case he told Harry to fuck off and wanted to leave, but he didn’t remove them entirely- he was far too happy to have Draco in his arms.
“Right! Right, sorry, my name’s Sirius Black, and I’m your godfather-”
"He doesn't want to take off the jacket, so here's the tag, do you mind keeping hold of it?" Hermione addressed them.
Draco seemed to suddenly realize what he had admitted to and flushed red. “Well, yes. I may have never met them, but they were still family.” He shrugged awkwardly. “And now I suppose I can use some for Teddy, here, if the need arises.”
Draco felt his face flush. “I-no. There is someone I have feelings for, and have done since my first year at Hogwarts, but he doesn’t-” Draco cut himself off, shrugging and dropping his eyes to his lap.
He'd dressed in his favourite outfit, hoping to make himself feel as comfortable as possible. Dungarees, a t-shirt, his jacket and a pair of high tops, all made to look like or printed with bears. He was sure people would probably be staring at him, judging him, but he also couldn't bring himself to care- it's not like people hadn't been doing that since he'd first entered the wizarding world, after all.
“Mngh. M’rn’g.” Draco mumbled, pouring hot water into an odd contraption he seemed to have found somewhere. Harry assumed it was some way to make coffee, but he’d never had to make any at the Dursley’s and he wasn’t a huge fan of it himself, so he wasn’t sure.
He was startled out of his book by a knock at his door. “Harry? Dinner.” Remus’ voice called.
"Oh- Potter." Draco Malfoy stood in the doorway, and Harry felt his jaw drop. Draco was wearing black drainpipe jeans, Doc martens and a cut up black tank top, and his arms were covered with heavy, colourful tattoos. "I'm really sorry, but would you mind if I sat in here?" Draco shifted uncomfortably.
“Fine. Hermione, what about you, then?”
Draco felt his eyes start to burn, anger at the horrible family giving way to sorrow than anyone could treat Harry, sweet, loving Harry, like that. He deposited his half-eaten dinner next to Harry’s and scootched closer to him, wrapping one arm around the shorter boy and pulling him into a hug. “You’re worth so much more than they ever will be.” He whispered into Harry’s curls.
“Miss Potter, it seems-”
“’s not high.” Harry shrugged, following along as Leo headed towards the front office. Harry hadn’t been in the office since he was dropped off about 6 years before. When Leo pushed open the door, Harry was mildly surprised to see the walls were a pale blue colour. He vaguely remembered them being an ugly yellow, so they must have repainted. Shaking himself mentally, he looked at the men by the desk. There was the Head, Mr Yaxley, standing with 2 men he’d never seen before. One of them was even shorter than he himself was, with long, wavy black hair and silvery eyes and a leather jacket, and the other was at least 6’4”, with mousy hair, amber eyes and at least 10 scars on his face, and more visible down his neck and across the hand resting on the shorter man’s shoulder.
The little house elf nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, Mister Draco, Sir, Lanky be doing that right away!” They popped out only to return barely a few seconds later with a tray full. “Does that be being all, Mr Draco, Sir?”
Remus frowned. “Why not? You’re welcome to stay here, of course.”
“Piano, violin, cello, flute and harp, mostly. I learned piano when I was a kid, then the others as I got older. Aside from the guitar, I like the harp best, I think.” Harry was surprised at how much information he was being offered, and from the look on his face, so was Draco.
“Harry, don’t worry about it. I was going to hand in my notice soon, anyway, because I’ve gotten a job over at a boarding school in Scotland for next year, and I’ve got the savings to be alright for the next seven months until then. All my things are already packed up in my office. Will you be alright if I just go get them?” They asked, worried about leaving Harry to the mercy of Um-bitch, as they called her.
“Er, hey, Malfoy. Pads asked if I’d come and help record. That’s alright, yeah?”
Draco had never met Sirius Black, and he wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but he was simultaneously surprised and unsurprised to see a handsome man with shaggy black hair and a worn leather jacket walk in to the room they’d set up to record in. He had the same eyes as Draco, and similar cheekbones as well, but that was about where the similarities ended. Where Draco was tall, Sirius was short, where Draco’s hair was fair and fine, Sirius’ was thick and dark.
“I don’t know. I mean, they were scared of me, because I had magic, and my Aunt Petunia was really jealous of my mum when she went to Hogwarts, but I don’t know. They just hated anything that wasn’t ‘normal’, and since I checked basically all of their ‘abnormal’ boxes, I guess it was easy for them to just hate me, even when I was a baby.” Harry put his plate down on the table and pulled his legs up to his chest, picking at a loose seam of Remus’ old sweater.
“You’re cute, too.” Harry smiled gently and Draco somehow blushed even harder and dipped his head, avoiding Harry’s eyes. Harry used his thumb to tilt Draco’s head back up slightly, his eyes trained on the blond’s perfect lips. “Can I kiss you?”
“I’m so glad you’re here, love. I always said Narcissa was daft for marrying that man, but ah well. Nym!” She turned to her child. “Grab Draco’s stuff and take it to his room! Your dad’s on his way home and I’m sure he’ll want to meet Draco too.” Nym grabbed the three items from the backseat and Andromeda frowned. “Is that all you fetched?”
And he was floating away, his feet carrying him away from the dungeons and his mind succumbing to bliss.
“Of course. We can get some stuff for your room at Hogwarts, too, while we’re out.”
Draco nodded and headed to his room to grab his pipe and his pot, before heading outside to sit on the garden bench while Harry got the memory card into his laptop and started the download. He took his laptop with him outside and sat close beside Draco, passing the pipe back and forth between them. Both of them just kept thinking
“Do you like her?” I asked before I could think about it, then clamped my mouth shut.
Harry snickered. “I live with him, Hermione.”
“Yes! Yes! Do it!” Nym jumped in excitedly. “I’ll play drums, and we can invite Siri over and he’ll do bass! It’ll be iconic!”
“H-” Draco’s voice cut off. “Hi.”
Harry smiled crookedly. “Okay, yeah, sounds good.” Once Draco left he started undressing, getting ready to shower. It was much easier when he could stand, but over the past few months he’d gotten fairly adept at getting clean whilst sitting. It was only once he’d gotten washed and wrapped himself in a big, fluffy towel that he realized he hadn’t gotten any pyjamas out. Normally he’d’ve just summoned something from his trunk, but his magic was always a bit dodgy after a migraine, and his spells either came out as absolutely nothing or with far too much power. He shuddered as he remembered just after the final battle when he’d tried to summon something from his trunk and had accidentally summoned the whole thing; that had definitely worsened the damage.
“Hullo.” Harry gave them a lazy salute, his half-smoked cigarette between his fingers.
“He really is just like his mother. 5 galleons on his being a Hufflepuff like them.” He whispered under his breath.
When Harry woke up that morning, Hermione was gone and he was halfway laid across Ron, who was still snoring. He remembered what had happened the night before and felt himself flush, his head dropping in shame. He'd been doing so well hiding the weird episodes he'd been having for the past month, but one stupid nightmare and both his friends had found out.
“Why not?” Harry rolled his eyes a little.
Draco’s silver eyes went wide. “You love me?”
“Really?” He rolled his eyes exasperatedly, but it was all in good fun- they were both well aware that he would end up going to school in the daft t-shirt (although, actually, not that he’d admit it, it was a pretty cool shirt. It was black with a shiny black print on the front, and Nym had used her seem ripper to remove the collar and un-hem the sleeves and bottom and fray it out a bit for him.)
“Hem, Hem. Miss Potter, such a brutal attack on your fellow students will not be tolerated in this school. The only acceptable punishment for such a transgression is expulsion.” As she said that, Mx Greenfeld walked into the reception.
“Mr Potter? I’m sorry to bother you at such a… delicate time, but I’m afraid a Mrs Andromeda Tonks has been killed, and after her child’s death you are her next of kin.”
The main issue with rooming with Harry was the fact that he almost never wore a bloody shirt in their room. As soon as he decided to settle in for the night, he’d shed his shirt and jeans and laze around the room in either his boxers or one of his pairs of sweatpants that had loose waistbands at constant risk of slipping down over Harry’s narrow hips, and Draco felt like he was slowly going insane. He constantly wanted to curl up against Harry’s strong chest, be held by his muscled arms and press his face into his brown skin, and the fact that he couldn’t was infuriating. He complained about it to both Pansy and Angela, who both just laughed at him and told him he should just tell Harry how he felt, as if that wasn’t a nightmare waiting to happen.
"Nope, I'm all yours."
Harry just shrugged his shoulders a bit and buried his face back into Ron's shoulder.
Son of infamous crime boss Lucius Malfoy wins the heart of the ministry's "golden boy"
Mx Greenfeld was growing more and more concerned for Harry as he spoke. “Just how bad are your relatives?”
Harry interrupted him, “What, the same godfather who killed my parents? What the fuck?!” He turned to Leo, who was standing against the wall and smirking at his outburst.
“It’s almost 10. Now get your lazy arse up!” He turned his head to glare at his cousin blearily.
!” Draco snapped his fingers and a spark of magic cracked through the air. “Maybe I helped you realize it, but you are exactly the same person you’ve always been, Harry!”
Hermione sighed and quickly cast cleansing and drying spells before asking "Well, has it?"
“Yep, pretty much.”
“Good. Do you suppose there’s for me to visit the library before the feast?”
. I thought, sadly, and dropped his hand. “What’s wrong?” He turned to me, his brow furrowed.
“Oh, Harry. Come on, sit down, I’ll get you a cuppa. Ron and Hermione will be back soon, I’ve just sent them out for some meat for dinner.” She ushered him into one of the armchairs near the fire. “I reckon I’ve still got some of my old baby books in the attic, I’ll dig them out for you after dinner.”
“Sure, you can. He’s been crushing on you all week, and he almost never has crushes on anyone. And clearly you like him back, so just ask him on a date. He’ll say yes.”
"Why would Malfoy be in a Muggle….. wait a minute…. Mate, I think that is Malfoy. What's he doing in a Muggle tattoo shop? And dressed like… that?" Ron raised his eyebrows, looking far less intently at Draco than Harry was but confused all the same. He was perhaps even as tall as Ron, his usually pristine hair a mess and his stuffy pureblood-approved clothing switched out for torn up black jeans, combat boots and some kind of shirt he'd clearly cut the sleeves off of himself, and his arms were pretty much covered in Muggle tattoos. When he turned to leave, they saw that he had three separate piercings in his face, two in his bottom lip and one between his eyes.
"Thanks, 'Mione." Harry smiled. "Laura recommended I choose some of my own clothes to sort of cut the tie between me and the Dursley's." It wasn't a lie- she had said as much multiple times in the past few months, he just hadn't bothered until now.
“Officer Riddle, and my partner, Officer Lestrange. What seems to be the issue?” The man’s voice was dry.
In the 6 months Harry had been on testosterone, his period had stopped entirely, something he was incredibly thankful for, his voice had lowered, not much but enough to be noticeable, his body had generally begun to look more masculine, which in turn made him feel far more confident, and he had even started to grow a bit of wispy facial hair. He was hoping that the facial hair would start to thicken soon- he was sure he would look fantastic with a full beard.
“L-Luna! I can’t just ask him out!”
“How many?”
before, a baggy black sweater, a green jacket and a pair of black, worn in doc martens.
“Yes, please.”
Ron awkwardly butted in, seeing that Harry wasn't going to elaborate without being prodded a bit. "You know it's alright if it has, right mate?"
“Andromeda was killed by death eaters.” He closed his eyes for a second and leaned into her motherly touch. “I’ve adopted Teddy and I’m living in her house now. Or, my house, I suppose.”
He looked at them for a second before deciding on the Weird Sisters one. Once he was dressed in the t-shirt that was a little loose on him, the black, torn skinny jeans that fit perfectly and the boots that he really had to thank Ted for, Nym made him sit down at their dressing table.
They ate in silence, until Hermione turned to Harry as he took a sip of his tea and said "Had what happened last night ever happened before, Harry?" Resulting in him spraying his tea all over her, coughing and sputtering.
“Why not, mate? I mean, he’s a prat, so its no big loss.”
“You’re queer?” Draco’s silvery eyes were wide. He couldn’t believe it. The man he’d been in love with since first year liked men! And was cuddling him! “Sorry, not the part I should be focusing on.”
"Could… could we go?" He knew his cheeks, usually a rich brown, would be stained red.
“And who the fuck are you, Harry? Do you even go here?” the group started crowding towards him instead, and he saw the blond boy pick up his headphones and turn to look at him. Harry smiled a bit at him and nodded his head towards the door. For a moment, the boy looked confused, his head tilted sweetly to one side, but then he realized what Harry meant and smiled gratefully at him, slipping out to the great hall.
“If you say so, Smith.” He shrugged, and out of the corner of his eye he saw one of the other boys start towards him. Before he could even land a punch, Harry’s knuckles met his face hard enough that Harry felt the sick crunch of his nose breaking.
Before they even got home, Teddy was half asleep on Harry’s chest, one little thumb in his mouth, and so by the time Harry laid him down in his cot and set up the monitor charm Molly had taught him, the little boy was already asleep.
Harry laughed at that, and Draco was entranced.
“’Mione, I think I’m having a nightmare. I just heard Harry say he thinks the ferret is gorgeous. Please slap me and wake me up.”
“I love it.” Sirius put his arm around Harry- he was a few inches shorter than him, so the angle was somewhat comical, but it was comforting all the same.
“I just did.” Harry had to suppress a snicker.
Back at the burrow, Hermione quickly used her wand to change Harry's bedding into the soft teddy bear print one he'd picked out in the store and used a switching spell to change him into his bear onesie, before tucking him into bed, his teddy bear clutched tight against him, a pacifier in his mouth and blankets surrounding him like a soft nest.
“Fine, whatever.” Harry turned away and headed towards the stairs.
“You think that’d be okay?”
Harry grinned. “Sounds good to me.”
“No, ma’am. I think Harry might be autistic, so we’re here for you to test him.”
“Aw! ‘Oo iz zis?!” She smiled warmly and reached over, stroking her delicate finger down Teddy’s nose.
"Good morning, Harry. Are you feeling alright?"
“Mh, sounds good. ‘m tired. Love you.”
. He couldn’t stop shaking or crying- that was the worst nightmare he’d had in months. Pushing himself out of bed, he pulled the sweatshirt he was wearing down as far as it would go; it was too short and too wide on his tall, skinny frame, because it was one that Harry had left in his flat a few days before. The past few months, Harry had been coming over almost every day to hang around with Draco, listen to music, and once even gave Draco a new stick and poke (a snake wrapped around his leg just above his knee), and they would definitely refer to one another as friends now.
he added on in his head.
“No, you’re not.”
“I did all of this for you! I killed the person I used to fucking be, not just Avery! I changed who I was for who you wanted me to be!” Harry yelled, his eyes lacking the softness they usually held when he looked at Draco.
“I dunno. I just wanted to.” Draco nodded, leaning closer to me until his head was almost on my shoulder. I saw Ron open his mouth again, but he was silenced by Hermione nudging him.
. Everything was too much, too loud, too bright, just too overwhelming. I shook my hands in front of me, biting my lip as I slid down the wall. I was in what seemed to be a small, empty cupboard. I let out my habitual sounds I always made when things got too much- two ‘Brr’s, two ‘Choo’s and then three whistles in a row, two short and one long, repeated until I could think properly again- but it didn’t seem to help. Screwing my eyes closed tightly, I slammed the heels of my hands together as hard as I could over and over until I could feel the skin start to bruise, but even that wasn’t helping for once. I could feel tears start to push out of the scrunched-up corners of my eyes and smacked both hands to the sides of my head, rocking back and forth as I tried to breathe as evenly as I could whilst digging my teeth into my lower lip harshly. I could still hear the overwhelming noise breaking through the flimsy door, but the idea of having to cast a silencing charm and listen to the buzzing magic sounded even worse than having to deal with the noise. I pulled my sweater down over my knees and the sleeves over my hands, pressing my face into the soft yarn and clamping my hands over my ears, continuing to rock back and forth and repeating my sounds again. The tears were finally slowing when I heard the door creak open.
“The majority of that was an act anyway, so I doubt that will be much of an issue.” Draco laughed. “Although, I’m sorry to bother you with this, but I was unable to grab any of my things before leaving the Manor and my vaults have been frozen, so have you any clothes I could borrow?” He looked embarrassed.
"I- I'm- fuck, I'm so sorry!" Harry's eyes were panicked.
“You’re dating Malfoy.”
“No way. If you really want to, you can just help me out with Teddy and shit, don’t even worry about it. Now, pass him here and I’ll get him ready while you have a shower.” Harry held his hands out to take the baby off of Draco.
“You- you’re adopting me?” Harry felt almost as if he’d fallen into an alternate universe.
“You kissed me.” Harry felt like he’d been confounded, and he lifted his fingers to press them lightly against his tingling lips.
“You could have just asked, you brat.” Blaise’s voice was as deep and warm as ever.
“I guess. If you need anything from Diagon that we can’t get in muggle London, though, just let me know. I’ll have to send the twins or something anyway for Teddy’s milk.” Harry knew he could always just switch him over to muggle milk, but it didn’t seem like a good idea.
"Bear, don't you have a clip for your pacifier?" Draco asked- surely it'd be almost impossible to find among all his blankets if it fell out during the night. Harry just looked at him blankly. "Okay, sweetheart. I'll have to get you one so you don't lose it, okay?" Harry nodded contentedly.
Draco wasn’t complaining, of course. As embarrassing as it always was, particularly on the days Potter turned up when he was already hours into his research and mortifyingly dishevelled, seeing Potter soon became the highlight of his days. The man was just as funny and charming as Draco had remembered from school, and it brought the ache in his chest back to full force, the longing to be loved by Potter, to be someone who mattered, but Draco refused to let his daydreams impede his research- he would never be special to the man, and he just had to face it- surely, he was just a distraction, something to pass the time.
“You are an absolute disappointment. I was willing to overlook your drug use, your lacklustre grades,” Draco thought that was a little unfair- he was second in every single one of his classes, and he knew the only reason his father was upset about it was because the girl who beat him out for top spot was a scholarship student “and even your friendship with Xenophilius’ daughter, but I refuse to accept an heir who sees fit to treat another man as he ought a woman.” Lucius’ face was a picture of disgust.
“Theo Nott outed me to the house and my father.” Comprehension dawned on Remus’ face- most of Draco’s dormmates were children of the bigoted, upper-class families.
“Oh! He did mention him and his husband having adopted a son last year. Its good to meet you!”
“Just checking up on my baby cousin’s first day as a disowned man!” Draco groaned and dropped his head to the table.
"It's possible he has regressed before now but no one noticed, however it's more likely that it just hasn't presented itself until now. PTSD and related things sometimes don't show up until one is out of the situation and safe, and Harry has really only just gotten out of the war, and he was essentially thrown from an abusive household into Hogwarts, where you know everything that happened there, into the war. It's not really surprising that certain trauma responses are only just beginning to present themselves." Hermione explained.
“Harry! I meant, why did you come in holding Malfoy’s hand, and why did we follow him in here?”
“I suppose it was rather idiotic on our parts to expect any less.” Draco listed a brow and shrugged.
“Alright. Fine. Lets do it.” Nym jumped up, fist pumping in the air and Andi grinned at him.
"I like all of these!" He said excitedly to them as he saw them approaching.
“Draco!” She smiled widely at him and stood a bit too close, almost leaning over him, her radish earrings swaying. He could feel her dirty blond hair ticking his nose.
"You sure?" Harry checked, and at Draco's immediate nod, he worked the both of them out of their remaining clothes before pushing Draco back up the bed and laying between his open legs.
so "make some friends
Draco was dressed in a pair of tight jeans, and Godric why had Draco never worn
“Harry Potter, new transfer from St Brutus’ Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.” Harry smirked as the blood drained from all of their faces- the case of St Brutus’ had been all over the news and Sirius had told Harry that in some of the boys’ interviews they had mentioned that everyone left Harry alone. Harry had thought it was funny already, but using it to scare pampered little rich boys…. Well, now it was just hilarious.
“Yeah.” Draco whispered.
Hermione smiled to herself while Ron gaped. “Ferret-face is gorgeous? Mate, you’ve got to work on your taste!”
“Professor McGonagall.” The man greeted, his voice creaky and old, but kind. “And this must be Harry.”
After his shower, Draco put on his underwear and socks and headed towards Nym’s room. He knocked quickly and they immediately pulled open the door and yanked him into their bedroom – there were band posters all over the walls, along with loads of pictures of her with a gorgeous, curvy woman, and a few with a tall red-head he recognised as a Weasley.
“That’s ridiculous. I mean, I knew she was mental already, but Merlin. I’m definitely glad Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon are muggles; I think the cruciatus would be the only spell they’d like.”
“Drakie! Are you on your way home?” Her voice was very calming to him.
“Oh? Alright, just these then?” He nodded his head at the throw cushions under one of his arms.
and 7
“Draco? Are you alright? Do you need me to do anything?” Harry dropped down into a crouch in front of Draco. Draco just shook his head. “Do you want me to leave?” He looked up at Harry, who was watching him patiently. He shook his head again. He didn’t want Harry to leave, which was odd- he almost always wanted to be alone when he felt like this, but something about Harry was very soothing. Plus, he smelled nice, like sandalwood and leather. “Can I sit on your bed, then?” Draco nodded, and heard Harry move around until the bed behind him dipped. “Do you want me to touch you or not?” Harry checked. Draco nodded again, and suddenly there was a warm hand in his hair, rubbing soothing circles on his scalp. He leaned back into the touch and Harry shifted, laying down so he could continue more comfortably. Draco burrowed against Harry’s side, feeling his muscles loosen and his breathing even out until he drifted off to sleep.
“You- they made you cook for them?” Draco wished he could use a time turner to go back to earlier in the day and punch the pair of them in the face, muggle-style.
“Harry, I’ll bring your stuff up from the car for you.” Remus smiled at him.
Then it hit him. He briefly let go of Harry, trying to avoid the hurt look on his best mate's face, and grabbed his wand from his nightstand before settling back onto Harry's bed and pulling him into a hug. Harry seemed to have calmed down a bit, but he was still crying quietly and sucking his thumb, so Ron quickly waved his wand. "
“You can take the bed, if you want. I’ll sleep out on the sofa.” Harry said as soon as they entered his room.
Draco was surprised at that. “Really?” he looked up at Harry through his long white lashes.
"As they will continue to be, Lu. You know exactly why." He rolled his eyes.
“I-oh. Okay. Good.” Draco’s pale cheeks were flushed pink, and it was beautiful. He took my hand again. “We should probably head back to the tower.” I just nodded and followed him out into the corridor. About half way back to the eighth-year tower, the sounds of the busy hallways got to be too much for me again, and I used my free hand to pull Draco’s ear defenders back up, stepping closer to him unconsciously.
His breath was short and his eyes started watering, and before Hermione and Ron could even notice he had turned and fled. He found his way to Myrtle's bathroom and dropped down onto the floor in the corner, pulling his knees to his chest and sobbing brokenly. His thumb made its way into his mouth as he cried for the loss of his parents, of Sirius, of Remus and Tonks, and of everyone else who shouldn't have had to die but did.
Almost three months since Harry and Draco had re-met, Draco bolted upright, his duvet tangled around his legs, panting and sweating, and he felt a sob wrack through him. Tears flowing down his cheeks, he looked at the clock beside his bed.
"Harry, it's perfectly natural to be nervous about seeing someone you have feelings for. I'm assuming that your age regression has not helped in this?"
“Yep. I reckon we should take the knight bus to Diagon, get whatever we need there and then head out to muggle London. Is that okay with you?”
The small boy heard the door open. Dudley had been very glad when at the beginning of his school year, his father had told him he was finally old enough to walk home alone, but that would now be the main thing allowing Harry to complete his task.
“Fine, fine, your highness.” They shoved him for that, laughing as he lost his balance and tripped arse-first onto the carpet. He glared at them.
“Well, now that I’m a free man, I was wondering if you’d like to come and live with me and Moony, er, Remus. Your parents, they wanted us to raise you, but with me in prison and Remus not having any legal claim on you, it’s obviously not been possible ‘till now.” Sirius looked hopeful.
“I-I was hoping to speak with my Aunt Andromeda?” Harry’s heart dropped.
“Yeah.” He nodded, even though he knew she couldn’t see him.
“Dray, can I put some eyeliner on you? It’d look dope as hell, I promise.” Draco barely even had to think about it before nodding- why the fuck not! “Killer.” She grabbed what honestly just looked like a pencil to Draco and dragged it along his waterlines. Once she was done, he turned to look in their mirror.
Draco looked up at Harry’s face, shocked, their eyes meeting. “You love me?” His voice was small and insecure.
“And he’s fetched a baby!” They spoke together.
“Sounds good.”
The main issue with this, however, was that he had been in love with someone for years, and he was certain that even if he could, somehow, convince Draco Malfoy to be his boyfriend, he wouldn't want to be his caregiver. He flopped back onto his bed with a sigh, closed his laptop and curled up to go to sleep.
“Uh. It basically means that my brain works a bit differently?” He didn’t seem too confident in his explanation. “Like, I don’t do too good with social… stuff, and I sort of have, uhm, sensory issues? So, sound can get really overwhelming, so can bright lights, or like, I have issues with certain textures or whatever, and, I don’t know, I can get, like obsessive over things? And even though I’m really sarcastic, I don’t always notice when other people use sarcasm? I don’t know.” He looked like he was really struggling with his explanation, his face scrunched up and his hands flapping again.
“Right. Sorry, who are you?” Harry raised his eyebrows and folded his arms in front of him.
“Oh, yes! I can see that! You’d look lovely in some nice clothes like hers.” Draco beamed, and Andromeda felt her chest swell- honestly, how Lucius could ever turn someone as sweet as this boy away, she’d never know.
“Fab. That’ll look right handsome on you. Okay, Sirius first then Harry.” She turned and headed into the little piercing room, Sirius following.
"be yourself,
A thud on the other side of the table made him look up. The new transfer was sitting, staring at him.
Like with the previous floors, he took his rather large pile of shoes and other items down to the counter before moving onto the fourth floor. This floor was filled with all different kinds of toys, plushies and children's books, and he grabbed as many as he could carry, spending about 20 minutes trying to select the perfect plush. He ended up picking out a white dragon from jellycat that reminded him of Draco, very regal looking. His favourite things other than his plushie were a set of blue alphabet blocks and a sanrio colouring book with pastel coloured Crayola crayons.
Yaxley looked down at Harry’s shoes, taking note of the odd shape and copious amounts of duct tape holding them together. “I will see about getting you a pair of standard-issue boots today, as I see the urgent need for replacements. This will not be standard practice, and any other time they would be included in your next week’s pack, understood?”
Draco didn't even dare say no.
“What you gonna do about it, faggot? Gonna go cry to daddy?”
“Alright, so now that’s out of the way, call me Harry, yeah?” Draco nodded, feeling his face flush at the fact Harry was still holding onto his hand. “Our room’s the top one, and I convinced McGonagall to let me see all the rooms last month, so I can tell you it’s the best one- there’s a window seat and everything.” Harry finally dropped his hand and took off up the stairs. “You coming?” Draco shook himself and followed Harry to their room.
. I stuck up for you because you don’t deserve to be treated like that, and because maybe if their stupid fucking ideas are challenged, they might end up semi-decent people.
"I- everything. I'm in love with you." Draco's eyes widened with shock and he decended back down, kissing Harry deeply again.
“No worries.” Just then Fleur seemed to catch sight of Teddy, still being rocked slowly by Molly.
“Why did you do that?” Harry considered playing dumb, but somehow he knew Draco would see right through him.
Hogsmeade was a nice town, and a gorgeous area to live, but the options for clothing were limited to one store and a tailor, and there wasn’t even a hairdressers, so Sirius and Remus instead drove Harry to the nearby city to shop. There was a huge shopping center, and even a smaller store about 10 minutes from it which stocked things like binders.
Going back to Hogwarts was more nerve-wracking than ever. Not only did he have to deal with knowing he was in the same place the final battle had occurred, the same place so many people had died, but he also had to make sure no one found out he was a little. He knew, thanks to Ron and Hermione's constant support, that it wasn't a bad thing, but he was also very aware that if it got out it could cause him lots of problems. On top of that, he was going to have to be in the same place as Draco bloody Malfoy, who, when he had seen him a couple of months before, had been even hotter than ever, and his new look definitely wasn't helping.
"Fine, I'll get 'mione over here to tell you herself. 'MIONE! C'MERE!" She called across the great hall.
“Yes, I noticed your medical records were rather lacking. Not to worry, today we’ll just be having a bit of a chat about how long you’ve known you were a boy, your plans for your transition, things like that, and then you’ll have to book in with a regular doctor for a full check-up before I can prescribe you any hormones, but if everything goes smoothly it shouldn’t take more than a week or so until everything is sorted, alright?”
He sighed and, moving as little as possible, kicked off his jeans and deposited the book he was still holding on the ground next to them. He untucked one edge of the duvet from around Harry and pulled it over himself, settling in beside him and wrapping an arm around his shoulders. Harry latched onto him like a monkey, wrapping himself around Draco's lean form. Draco smiled softly and let his eyes droop, holding Harry close.
By the end of fourth period, Draco was already Over It. Everyone kept staring at him, and he’d heard a million different rumours about him, ranging from teenage rebellion to alien abduction, and he was getting incredibly annoyed by it all. He was on his way to the Great Hall for lunch, when the annoying photography kid from the year below, Colin Creevey, stopped him.
"But…. 'Mione…." Harry's voice was practically a whine and his eyes were glued to Draco, but just then the blond turned to open the shop door and Harry panicked. "Oh fuck, guys, we need to, we need to, he can't see, fuck…" he started mumbling, pulling them towards the shop and they both huffed out a laugh at him before following him off of the street and into the store before Draco could notice them.
“Okay, one minute.” Draco whispered, and before Harry could even fully register what he’d said, Draco was leaning over him, whispering a featherlight charm, wrapping his long, slender arms around him and pulling him up. Harry wanted to burrow his face into Draco’s neck, because the man smelled wonderful and was warm, but he refrained. Draco laid Harry out on his bed and then leaned down and grabbed the plush duvet from the floor, wrapping it around the shorter man. He then went to the tray he’d left on top of the trunk, fetching it over to the bed. He grabbed the anti-nausea and painkilling potions he’d fetched- they wouldn’t cure the migraine but hopefully they’d help enough that Harry would at least open his eyes or eat and drink. “Here, drink this.” He uncorked the anti-nausea potion. It was the slightly stronger sibling of the stomach-soother they’d brewed on Monday. Draco smiled to himself as Harry just took it without question, and uncorked the second vial. “And this one.” He passed it over and then took both empty vials, setting them back on the tray. He then picked up the Evercool compress and put the tray on the floor by the bed, kicking off his shoes and setting onto the bed beside Harry. He pressed the compress to Harry’s forehead and adjusted them until Harry’s head was in his lap so he could rub his scalp.
It was after curfew, but Harry couldn’t sleep and he knew that sometimes just being outside was nice at night. At the Dursleys’ he used to sometimes sneak out and lay in the yard in the dark, so he decided that he was going to sneak down to the football field and hang around out there, breathing in the fresh night air.
“Christ, I’ve wanted to kiss you since you threatened Pansy.”
“Of course, yeah. A tight, squeezy hug?” Harry asked knowingly. Draco looked up, nodded and tilted his head to the side in question. “’s how Luna likes it.” He shrugged. Draco’s eyes widened a little at that- his cousin was autistic, just like him, and that phrasing made it sound like Harry had figured him out. Harry noticed and chuckled as he moved himself until he was sitting with his back pressed against the wall and his legs spread, and pulled Draco gently into his lap, wrapping his arms around the slender boy. “I won’t tell anyone if you don’t want me to.” Draco nodded and leaned back against Harry’s firm chest, relaxing at the comforting pressure of the hug.
“She used to, uhm.” Harry paused, wondering how to phrase it, to eat the last of his dinner. He put the empty plate back onto the tray and settled back against the headboard with his tea. “Whenever she thought I’d done something wrong, like burn their breakfast or, I don’t know, breathe too close to my cousin, she’d hit me in the head with a frying pan. Not super hard, but yeah. Poppy can’t heal it because it has been too long.” He looked down at his cup, still ashamed even now he knows he wasn’t the problem.
“A charming reaction!” the man’s voice was dramatic but jovial and sincere.
“I could always kill them for you, if you want.” Draco knew Harry would take his offer as a joke, but he was half-way serious.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat, and he nodded, gasping s he felt Harry’s plush lips cover his own much thinner ones. They kissed for what could have been seconds or eternities, until they broke apart, both breathing heavily.
Harry grinned, his eyes squinting a little and where his scar branched out under his right eye wrinkling. “I’m glad to hear that, sweetheart.” Draco felt himself melt into Harry’s arms at the pet name before Harry pressed his lips to his again, smiling against his mouth as Draco wrapped his long legs around Harry’s hips again.
Harry's room was very…. Soft, would probably be the best descriptor. Three separate rugs, each with a different soft texture, soft bedding, piles and piles of blankets, a stuffed bear, lots of soft colours, teddy bear curtains around the bed and in the window instead of the standard purple (Draco thought Granger had most likely charmed them), an oversized pillow seat in one corner with a pile of children's books, and colouring books and supplies all over the desk.
“Why did you kiss me?”
I will try and try to change but I just stay the same.” The boy’s voice was a rich, warm baritone, but he sounded sad.
“Potter, you will address me as Head Yaxley or Sir, only. You will be rooming with 5 other boys, and any violent behaviour will be punished severely. Many of the boys in here form gangs; this is not against the rules but is not recommended either. You will be released on your eighteenth birthday, by which point you ought to have completed your GCSEs, and your criminal record will be stricken off, as you are here and not in police custody. You are free to miss as many meals as you please, although failure to attend classes will result in punishment. Cigarettes are available, up to one carton per week, regardless of age, but any drugs or alcohol will be confiscated and result in a punishment. You will have a weekly list of chores and tasks to complete, it us up to you whether you do them all in one day or spread them out. Weekends are your own to do as you please within the center. You
Harry fell asleep on his shoulder just over half way through the book, and Draco couldn't keep the fond smile off of his face. He gently adjusted Harry so that he was comfortable and pressed a soft kiss against his curly hair. He started to stand up to leave, when Harry whimpered in his sleep and reached out for him. He moved a little closer and watched the way Harry relaxed once he had Draco's arm in his grasp.
"You don't- think it's weird?" Harry cracked open one eye, resulting in a ridiculous, screwed up facial expression.
me!” Harry stared pleadingly at the Headmistress, hoping that she would believe him. She looked at him with pursed lips before shaking her head and fishing her mobile phone out of her cheap polyester blazer.
"Wait, so you and Malfoy weren't already dating?" Ron looked befuddled, and both Draco and Harry immediately burst out laughing.
years once already, so he was 2 years older than the rest of his year. He harassed and belittled Harry every single time he saw him, and had even once threatened to rape him to “prove he was really a girl”, which had earned him a detention from his own head of house, and the only instance anyone had ever seen of Snape taking points from Slytherin.
Harry's first class back on Monday morning was potions, and although he shared it with Ron and Hermione, they wanted to sit together, naturally. When Slughorn made the announcement that whoever they partnered with that day would be their partner for the rest of the year, including their projects, Harry made a… rather impulsive decision, and dropped into the seat beside Draco, carefully placing his backpack against the table leg.
Draco picked out one of the books- the spine was more cracked than the others and it seemed to have been more worn, so Draco guessed it was most likely Harry's favourite. He seemed to be correct, because as he got in bed and Harry saw it, his eyes lit up excitedly.
“If you want. We could just share.” Harry’s head snapped up, and he saw the pink flush spreading across Draco’s face.
"What's wrong?" She asked, her eyes darting back and forth between Harry and Ron, taking note of the way Harry seemed to actually be allowing himself to take comfort in Ron's touch whereas he usually squirmed away from too much contact due to its foreign discomfort for him.
“Hm? Oh, sorry, I should have asked first.” Harry seemed genuinely guilty.
“Good riddance!” Vernon practically yelled as they left.
He rocked back and forth lightly, chewing on the skin and breathing heavily as he blinked tears out of his eyes. The combination of the horrible day he’d had and that girl trying to force herself on him was just too much. He wished he had his weighted blanket with him, because he knew the pressure would sooth him, but it hadn’t occurred to him to grab it before leaving his dorm. He was glad he was at least wearing his comfort clothes. He bit down on his hand extra hard and felt the points of his teeth rip into the skin and pulled his hand out of his mouth with a dry sob, gagging as the taste of blood hit his lips. He slapped both palms into his head, one on either side and applied pressure. He had been trying to stop hitting his head so much, but sometimes he couldn’t help it.
“Why did you want to do that?” Draco didn’t understand what was going on.
“Yeah, because he tried to
he could see from the back yard of their cottage.
“That all you got to say?” Harry raised one thick brow sardonically, laughing to himself as Kane turned on his heel and stalked back inside. He lit up another cigarette and laid back, blowing smoke rings to entertain himself. Most of the other boys at St Brutus’ had split into gangs, but Harry had never seen the appeal. He’d never really been one of the ‘Incurably Criminal Boys’ after all, he’d just been unwanted. Plus, he’d been there year-round since he was 9, and at first he’d just been the kid they all liked to pick on. Well, that hadn’t lasted long. By the time he was 11, most of them had learned not to fuck with him. Sure, a few of the new transfers like Kane tried it, but they usually learned pretty quickly.
“You have no idea what you’re talking about, Dorian.”
No one had expected him to walk into first period Physics with Professor McGonagall, his arm around Harry Potter’s shoulders. No one had anticipated Harry leaning up to press a kiss to his cheek before heading for his seat at the back with Ron and Hermione. Certainly no one had expected Draco Malfoy to look happier than he had since first year. He smiled to himself as he sat down beside Padma Patil.
"Since we met." Draco pulled him gently until he laid back on his chest.
Harry smiled amusedly. "I wonder if they'll talk to your dad. He'll probably try and insist I kidnapped you or something."
“Uh, thanks, Remus.” Harry said, his voice a little quieter than usual. As he spoke, the black-haired man looked up at him, pinning him with his silver-grey eyes.
“T-truce.” Draco shook, feeling his delicate hand almost engulfed in Harry’s larger one.
He could feel everyone’s eyes boring into him and he tried to just ignore them, heading towards where his friends were sat smoking.
"What's a caregiver?" Ron wished Hermione would remember not to just throw out terms she'd read about and assume everyone else had read the same books she had. He loved her, but it was one thing that was less endearing to him and more annoying.
"Okay."
"Why do you think there's something wrong with you, Harry?" Laura's voice was as neutral as ever. Harry had been seeing her for nearly 3 months now, ever since the end of the war, and although she was a Muggle, so he couldn't tell her anything about the war, she'd already helped him a lot. Especially with processing the trauma he'd experienced as a child.
Draco's eyes strayed back to Harry, breifly just taking in how beautiful he was. "Of course."
Harry nodded vehemently. "I did it as soon as I got home, and then the day after I went to this store that sells lots of stuff for littles, and I got new clothes there, do you like them?" He babbled excitedly, sticking out his leg to show off his yellow jeans and his white converse shoes.
so "make some friends
“I- no, I’m a 10. Are you really sure about this?” Draco looked as if he was half expecting Harry to rescind his offer at any moment.
but only if theyve been approved of by me"”
d Draco, grasping his bony hand tightly and tugging him to his feet. He vaguely noticed there was still a bit of blood trapped under his blunt nails, but holding Draco close against his chest seemed much more important in that moment.
The next morning, Harry woke as normal and thanked god that Remus had another little coffee pod machine in the sitting room. He gulped down his cappuccino and rinsed his mug before heading to take a shower. Once he was showered, he dressed in his uniform, his black oversized sweater and his boots and grabbed a pack of fags.
I'm not even fucking surprised
“Oh. Fair enough, then, I guess.” Harry could tell Draco didn’t want to talk about it and chose not to pry and make him uncomfortable, although he did continue to watch as Draco pulled out even more blankets and laid them haphazardly on his bed. He then moved back to his see from the trunk and started methodically removing items and placing them carefully in what seemed to Harry like no specific position, but he could see from the care Draco was taking that it must mean something to him. He put an odd-looking collection of plastic items that Harry didn’t recognise into the drawer on his bedside table.
“Not whatever! You are a wonderful person once you get past all of Lucius’ bullshit, and you deserve the whole fucking world! Lupin would be lucky to have you!” He didn’t believe her for a second, but it did make him feel better. He wrapped his arm around her shoulders and kissed the side of her head.
“Mghf, y’s pl’s. C’n’t g’t up.” His voice was muffled and slurred.
year.”
Draco smiled indulgently. "While you go change, I'm going to go and change into my pyjamas too, then, is that okay?"
“Well, why did you do that? With Nott?” Harry pressed and Draco rolled his eyes, somehow managing to make the motion inhumanly elegant.
He was just plating up an honestly ridiculously sized portion when his whale of a cousin waddled in, taking his seat at the breakfast table. “Hey, Potter, where’s my food?” He demanded, and Harry silently slid the overfull plate in front of him before preparing a second plate for Uncle Vernon, even larger than the last. Through a mouthful of food, Dudley called over to him, “Potter, you still going to be pretending to be a boy today?” just as Uncle Vernon walked through the door.
“Uh… I’m… not sure?”
"Oh, Harry, you're okay. You're not a freak, I promise. Look, sweetheart," the term of endearment just fell naturally from his lips, "Longbottom won't think you're a freak. He might feel sad for you, but he won't think you're a freak." Draco stroked his hand down the side of Harry's cheek, wiping away the tear streaks gently.
Draco butted in quietly, “You were having a meltdown.”
“Shit.” Draco noticed that Harry was clearly having a panic attack, and after quickly strapping Teddy back into his pram and pulling it safely against the wall, he stood in front of Harry. “Harry, you’re alright, you’re safe. I’m right here, can I touch you?” Harry nodded shakily, his green eyes fixed on Draco’s face. Draco took Harry’s square brown hand in one of his delicate ones. “You’re going to be fine, and we can go home if you want to, you’ll be alright soon.” He noticed the way Harry’s breathing was starting to even out and his body, previously tensed so hard it was painful, was slowly relaxing. “Alright, you’re okay, I’ve got you.”
Eventually their kisses shifted from hungry and lustful to sweet and tender, and then to light and sleepy, and that is how they fell asleep, Draco laid out on top of Harry, one of Harry’s hands resting on his lower back and the other on the back of his upper thigh, their lips still touching lightly.
“And who the fuck are you?” One of the group shouted at him.
“Oh. I love you too.”
I stay the s-ame.
Muggle London was just as busy as Diagon had been, but thankfully they were far less likely to be mobbed there. Pushing Teddy and chatting idly as they shopped for new quilt covers and pillows, Harry could almost pretend they were a normal family. Oh, how he wished.
“Sorry.” His voice was a little raspy from disuse.
“That’s fine, I’m sure that they will be much more… equipped…. To deal with his
“No, don’t be sorry! He is rather handsome, isn’t he? You should ask him out.” Her bluntness made him splutter.
McClaggen just sneered and walked off, but half way back to his seat he tripped over seemingly nothing, and Ron’s younger sister, one of the girls on his team, Ginny, had a smug smirk on her face and shot a brief wink at him before continuing her conversation with the odd blonde Ravenclaw she was dating, who never seemed to sit at her own table.
They both stirred into awareness at around the same time, Harry smiling sleepily down at Draco, who’s face was pressed right into his collarbone, but his entire body was wracked with tremors.
Harry had barely even thought about it before his gun was out, a bullet travelling fast directly into the back of the man's head. Blood splattered across Draco's pointed face and he looked up, startled, and smiled upon catching sight of Harry.
Here at the Prophet we recommend caution around Potter, and will report any updates that may arise.
"I'm 5'1"." Harry flopped back down onto his seat, pouting again.
“Is that another one of you freaks? Don’t tell me someone actually had a child with
“Okay, kid, pack up all your stuff and you’re completely free to leave with them.” She winked at him. He crammed all of the pairs of pants, underwear, socks and t-shirts he had into the backpack and thanked Christ that they were big bags, before grabbing the 3 brand new boxes of boots out from under his bed.
"Okay, baby."
“Hi, Luna Lovegood. Please get out of my face.” Harry tried to be polite but he realized it came out ruder than intended. Luckily, she didn’t seem to take offence, just sat back down and smiled serenely at him.
“You know how I take my tea? And the name of the house elf?” Harry reached over to grab the tea and take a quick sip.
“Oi, Malfoy!” He signalled with his head for Draco to ‘come here’.
“Oh.” Draco leaned in and kissed Harry- he had always thought that the world-shifting, fireworks-type kisses were a myth, but when his lips met Harry’s, he knew he had been wrong. It just felt right to be kissing Harry, more right than anything had ever felt before. “I love you too. Have done since we met, really.”
lessons are off?” Harry turned and looked right into the angular face of Draco Malfoy.
“Thanks, Hermione.” He nodded at her and headed down the stairs.
Once he'd tried everything on, he took the big pile back towards the counter.
“Is this- is this what you’ve been working on?” Potter’s eyes were on him, so intense it made him squirm.
Draco turned to them and raised a brow, leaning back into Harry’s strong arm which was still wrapped around his narrow waist. “So, am I faggot for being attracted to Harry, or is he a woman? You’re not particularly consistent, Theo, and consistency is a virtue.”
“I will try and try to change
Luckily almost everyone else was still in class, so they didn't come across anyone on their way up to the tower, so it didn't take too long until they were stood outside Harry's dorm. Harry was still holding Draco's hand in a vice grip, but he pushed his door open and Draco smiled to himself when he saw the room.
Draco shivered, and Harry pulled the duvet up over them, wrapping it around Draco’s shoulders and rubbing his back soothingly. “I-it started with the night on the astronomy tower… but I k-killed Dumbledore, and-and then I killed Sev, and Granger and Weasley, and then the rest of your s-side, but not you, because I th-then,” Draco’s voice broke as he sobbed into Harry’s chest. “Then I tortured you, and-and-” Draco’s voice cut off.
Draco stepped in front of Harry, leaning down slightly and wrapping him up in a hug. Harry stood frozen for a second before wrapping his arms around the taller boy, pulling him close and burying his face in his neck.
“Your mum’s eyes though.” The taller man chipped in.
“I was going to help you out with him anyway.” Draco almost pouted, but handed Teddy over and stood up. He stretched himself out like a cat, and Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from the way his lean muscles moved under his pale skin. “I’ll just go have a shower then.” And he headed into the bathroom. The mirror was still fogged over and the air was moist. Draco took a deep breath in and inhaled the lingering scents of Harry and soap and closed his eyes.
“Thanks.” Harry almost mumbled.
“I love you.”
Draco dropped down on the sofa heavily and pulled his long legs up to fold underneath him before grabbing his plate. He took a bite and groaned. “Salazar, Harry, where did you learn to cook like this?”
“Yeah, I guess.” I admitted. Draco hummed.
Harry kissed him soundly. “I love you.”
or something similar into the base spell work of the time turner."
"Yes, yes. Thank you." Draco stepped over the corpse, his long legs making it easier than going around, and headed straight towards Harry. He almost fell into Harry's arms as he tucked his gun back into his waistband. "Will this cause you any problems at work?" He whispered against Harry's broad shoulder.
Ron coughed awkwardly. “Uh, mate, that doesn’t explain why you were holding hands?”
“You’re braver than me. If Lucius was my da’, I’d probably be in the closet ‘till I finished uni, at least.”
Draco turned to him, surprised. "Why… are you sitting here?" Draco winced, clearly realising how rude that came out, and Harry couldn't stifle a giggle.
but only if you're who i want you to be"
"He will! 'N now you've seen me crying 'n you're gonna think I'm a freak too!" Harry's lower lip wobbled.
Harry huffed a laugh. “My decision is you. your side, and you. As you very well know.” Harry knew a flush must have spread across his cheeks, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to care when Draco looked at him just like that.
“Okay, no problem, I can- I can do that.” Harry shifted Teddy against his body until he could hold him with one arm and reached for the quill Kingsley was holding out for him, signing each line Kingsley pointed to as quickly as possible.
“Dunno. Didn’t get her name.” He shrugged.
“Excellent point, darling. Let’s go.” The three of them crowded into Mils’ car and she drove them to their favourite smoke spot, just on the edge of the Forbidden Forest not far from Draco’s family manor.
or mad
“I love you too, mum.”
"Can we leave these with you then pay at the end when he's done?" Hermione, ever practical, asked.
Masked by the rustle of text books, Ron leaned over to him. “Bloody hell, mate, I didn’t know you were a genius!”
Draco had barely been waiting for 15 minutes when a big black jeep pulled up besides him, The Weird Sisters blaring from its radio. A cool looking pink haired person rolled down their window and leaned out, grinning at him so widely her septum ring touched their black-painted upper lip. “You Draco?”
It was 9:45 on a Wednesday evening and he was headed down to the smoking spot for his last fag of the night, when he came across Draco Malfoy in one of the alcoves. The taller boy was curled in on himself and visibly having a panic attack, his shoulders shaking and tears running down his delicate cheeks. As soon as he saw him, Harry stopped and dropped to his knees in front of him.
“You’re awake Ron, now just be happy for Harry! Malfoy hasn’t been so bad the past year or so, and if Harry likes him, then we should support our friend!”
Harry raised one thick, black brow, specifically the one that had a huge lightning-shaped scar running through it and down onto his cheek from the car crash his parents died in. “Hm. If you like.”
He knew, however, that he wouldn't want to have a caregiver who wasn't also his partner, which caused even more issues than the age regression in general. He just didn't want to have someone, even Ron or Hermione, looking after him, and ideally he would want to be in a romantic relationship with someone who would also be his caregiver, otherwise he would be more comfortable regressing alone- it wasn't news to anyone, especially himself, that he was a very private person. Part of it was his nature, and part was caused by his childhood, but either way the idea of regressing around someone he wasn't emotionally and romantically invested in made him uncomfortable as opposed to the safe feeling he got at the idea of having a caregiver who was also his partner.
and suddenly when i dropped the mask
"But… but… it's freakish! I-"
As he turned, though, he caught sight of Draco Malfoy, his eyes slightly glassy and his high cheekbones spotted with pink as he clutched the arm of his best friend, a short Filipino girl with a severe black bob called Parkinson. Harry didn’t want to dwell on it, but he thought that Draco, his silver eyes glassy and his face flushed, might be the most gorgeous sight he’d ever seen.
"Well, you certainly look a lot better!"
“Not whatever! You can’t sit here when you’re not a Slytherin!”
Ron leaned in close and whispered “Fucking Smith saw you showering and told the whole school you’re trans.”
They were still kissing when a wholly unpleasant voice came from behind them.
She looked up as he sat. “I think you’re at the wrong table.” Even her voice was bitchy.
The next morning, Harry woke at 06:45, just as he did every other day. He then showered and dressed in clean clothes and his boots. He slipped his new phone into one of the pockets, his knife into another and his cigarettes and lighter into the one by his knee. Grabbing his jacket, made of heavy black canvas, he headed down to the common room. There was only one other person in there, a short black girl with large front teeth and a big book in her lap. As she heard him walk in she looked up, startled.
“Oh, we’re gonna get along great, kid.”
“Yeah, pretty much. Dramatic bastard.” His voice was fond, and Harry couldn’t quite suppress the snicker at the pout on Sirius’ face. “So, Harry, the three of us will be living in my home in Hogsmeade, and you’re free to decorate your room however you want, and we’ll take you shopping tomorrow morning. You’ll be starting at Hogwarts Academy in a couple of weeks once half-term’s over, which is a private boarding school, but you’ll have your own room there too, in my suite, and will be able to come home with me on weekends if you like, seeing as I’ll be driving home each weekend to stay with Sirius.” Harry nodded, a little wide eyed at the idea of
“Fair enough. What about you, Luna?” He tried to include her instead of giving in to his urge to just swoon over Draco.
“Thanks, Pans. Love you.”
Draco almost leapt from his bed, usually pristine hair in disarray and his eyes wild. He threw himself uncharacteristically gracelessly into his desk chair and immediately began scrawling messy notes across his parchment. He’d discounted time turners almost a year ago, but he thought he might be on the verge of a breakthrough with his new idea.
"Makes sense, I guess. Ready, Harry?"
"I'm in love with you too." He whispered against his ear, trailing kisses down his cheekbone and back towards his mouth.
“And I know that. Why are you stuck in here?”
He walked into the dressing room and carefully hung each item up ready to try them on, and with each outfit, as soon as he looked in the mirror he grinned- this was him, this was what he looked like.
"I do think it's funny that her favourite child isn't even technically hers."
“God, Draco, I’ve been mental over you for years.” Harry didn’t try to force eye contact, instead just running his eyes all over Draco’s angular, flushed face.
“Uh, its your nephew, Draco. We’ve never met, but my mum gave me your number? My father’s disowning me, so…”
“Oh.”
“Draco, I don’t mind. It wasn’t a bother, I’m glad you felt like you could come to me last night, and I don’t mind the cuddling.”
“Fuck yes.” Draco pulled Harry back in for another bruising kiss before standing up and leading Harry back towards the house, their hands entwined. Sirius’ car was gone and Andi, Ted and Nym had all retreated to their rooms, and so no one noticed when Draco pushed Harry lightly into his bedroom and down onto the bed, both kicking off their shoes, socks and jeans and curling up together under Draco’s heavy duvet, their kisses slowly going from hot and fervent to slow and sweet to barely-there touching of lips as they both fell asleep.
“M-my roommate, Theo, he found out I’m gay and outed me to my father and the rest of the house.”
“Harry, this is Remus Lupin. My fiancé.” Harry wondered vaguely why they seemed to keep answering the questions he aimed at the other one.
"Of course I can." As soon as he finished, he found himself once again with his arms full of Harry. The smaller boy clung to him, pressing his face into his shoulder and wrapping his legs around him. He reached up and tugged the cute hood down from Harry's head so he could card his fingers through his thick curls. "You okay, little one?"
“The woman who used to watch me sometimes, Mrs Figg, she was deaf, so she taught me when I was little.” Draco nodded, and he considered asking more questions, but before he even fully realized what was happening his eyes drooped and he fell asleep.
“Gryffindor is red, Ravenclaw is blue, Hufflepuff is yellow and Slytherin is green.” Remus looked very much like he already knew which he’d choose.
Harry
“Sorry, I forgot to get any pyjamas! Would you mind grabbing me some boxers and something to wear on top?” Harry called back. He felt a bit ashamed he was having to rely on Draco like this, but he also somehow instinctively knew that Draco wouldn’t mind or judge him for it.
“C’mon, Dudley, time to go. I’ll drop you by school on my way to work, son.” Vernon’s voice was as close to warm as it ever got.
Lupin?” She asked.
“Oh. Okay.” I thought that all sounded pretty normal to me, and said so- “Is that… not normal?”
silk sheets?” Draco didn’t think Harry was being mean, but he still tensed.
“I’m surprised Granger never noticed anything, but it’s not something people really talk about in the Wizarding world. It’s not difficult to find out though. Come on.” Draco got to his feet and held out his left hand to help pull me up. I took it, feeling my face flushing at the feeling of his soft skin on mine and hoping that my dark skin covered it up.
“Yeah. I guess he’s your… cousin? Of some kind? He’s my godson. Or son, I suppose, since I adopted him.”
Harry felt himself flush. “Shit. Sorry.”
“If Molly hadn’t already done it, I’d go out and kill her right now.” His voice was dark, and it sent a twisted thrill through Draco.
Draco snorted and ran his silver-grey eyes up and down Harry’s body. “I suppose you’re in need of a new tutor, hm?”
“Harry, what’s wrong?” Mx Greenfeld hovered worriedly.
Draco hadn’t spoken until he was 11 years old (specifically on his 11
A series of cleansing spells to his clothes and the bathroom and he was left with one last piece of clean-up. Twirling his wand between his fingers, he stalked over to Myrtle’s stall where she was cowering against the wall. A sick smile on his face, he started casting.
“Fuck you, Potter, you fucking freak.”
"Well, they're idiots then. And really, you, the next Tom Riddle? You're far too smart for that, although if you ever tell anyone I said that I'll deny it."
“Yeah. Fucking arsehole. I got a good punch in for you though, mate, and McGonagall pretended she didn’t see even though I know she did.”
“I had assumed. Would you like me to leave?” He aimed is question at Granger.
"Don't wanna take this off though!" He hugged it closer to himself.
I try to change.
"Theoretically, yes, it makes sense, and it would run less of a risk of destabilising the timeline, but there is still the issue of if someone were to go back and, say, stop Harry being hit with the killing curse, it could entirely destroy the world as we know it. Muggles call it the butterfly effect, how a little action can entirely destroy the future."
“Yeah. I’m just tired.” Draco tore his eyes away from Harry’s broad chest and the silvery and pink scars all over it. Harry hummed softly in response.
“Mum then, does he?” The twins laughed with him and Harry watched as Teddy looked confusedly between the two of them.
Potter pulled back after a moment. “Don’t do this. It’s all done, its sorted, and I don’t- I don’t think it’s a good idea. But thank you.”
“Why the fuck not? It’s not like we all don’t already know you ain’t got a cock, tranny.”
“God, yes. Please.”
Most of his issues at school came from one particular sixth former. Aaron Michels was a year 12, 17 to Harry’s 11, and yet for some reason he wouldn’t leave the younger boy alone. Every day Harry had to try to avoid him in the corridors, even when that meant going the long way around and being late to his next class, lest he be pulled away from the crowd and felt up, regardless of how much he squirmed and fought to get away. Aaron was strong and tall, his muscles toned from playing football and working out in the gym, whereas Harry was scrawny, small and malnourished. He was the reason Harry had stolen Uncle Vernon’s old pocket knife, because Aaron had already managed to push his hands down Harry’s pants once, and he didn’t want to risk it happening again, or, even worse, going any further. Perhaps he was too small and underweight to actually fight the older boy off, but at least now he had another layer of protection. He vaguely wished he had an adult he could trust to go to about the harassment, but he’d learned in primary school that the teachers would never believe him, and if he went to the Dursley’s he’d probably be punished for wasting their time.
years at Hogwarts, and then a phalloplasty on December 21
As soon as they were out of the car park, Vernon chuckled gleefully to himself. “Finally going to be rid of you, boy! Just another two hours and then we’ll never have to see your freakish paki face again!” Harry sort of wished he could be upset by Vernon’s words, but all he could think was ‘Two more hours and I’ll never have to see them again!’
“Back to Potter, are we, Draco?” Harry smirked, teasing.
but only if theyve been approved of by me"
Harry shook his head violently. "Wan you." He wrapped both his arms around Draco's neck as tight as he could.
“Girl! Are you still doing that? I thought we told you to stop lying!” The obscenely fat man bellowed, his moustache trembling.
true, stabbing Mr Michels three times seems excessive, no?, it seems we have no choice but to either arrest him or have him sent to a secure center. Mr… Dursley, was it? The choice is entirely up to you, as his guardian, although I will let you know that if you choose for him to be sent to St Brutus’ Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys, you will be required to sign over all of your guardianship rights to him.”
The person behind the counter grinned sunnily. "Absolutely! Just pass them here and you can get them when you're done!"
“Why?” Draco cocked his head. “Why do you have them?” I elaborated.
“You- you learned protective spells for them?”
“If it lies about what it’s got in its pants, it can be an it.” The boy sneered, and Harry suddenly realized they were talking about him- he was confused about why Malfoy was standing up for him though. He stuck his head around the corner just in time to see Malfoy’s fist connect hard with the side of Nott’s face. Nott went down like a sack of potatoes and Malfoy, posh, pristine Malfoy, spat at him.
Ron and Hermione were standing talking to the sales assistant while Harry got started on picking out clothes.
“Milk and sugar?”
Once Harry was settled in the middle of the bed she climbed onto the edge, and after making sure all three of them were comfortable she lowered the blankets to tuck themselves around them.
Harry noticed where Draco’s eyes were trained and his breath hitched, and slowly enough to give Draco a chance to push him away, he leaned in, pressing their lips together. Draco’s breath stuttered and he gasped, opening his mouth and giving Harry the chance to deepen the kiss.
“Thank Salazar for caffeine.” Draco’s voice was much clearer already. Harry laughed. “What?” Draco raised one pointed brow.
As Professor McGonagall nodded and turned to leave, Harry made his way up the stairs to the boys’ dorms. 6 floors up, and the room at the end was marked as room C. He pushed open the door to see Remus folding his clothes into a big wooden chest of drawers, his bedding and blankets from home already laid out on his bed, and there was a gangly red-headed boy laid out on the other bed.
"Yeah!!" Once Harry saw that Ron had one of each sweater he almost immediately moved on, grabbing different shirts, sweaters and hoodies as he went.
"Okay, you're okay, come here." Harry felt himself be pulled against Draco's chest and wrapped his arms around his waist. Draco slowly guided them into one of the alcoves nearby and leaned against the wall, holding Harry tight and letting him cry heavily against him. When Harry started to calm down, Draco spoke again. "What happened?"
