‘Alright,’ the man said, ‘Moving on. Says here that you would like to reenact what happened and be punished for it. Normally, ‘Fantasy’ do offer age-altering potions to make the experience authentic. But as you were a minor when you commited the bullying acts, it would be against the protocol of the club to exercise corporal punishment on a minor. So, the de-aging potion would only go as far back as you were seventeen years old, when you came of your legal age. The same goes for me, too. So when you request a scene, you could only request for age above seventeen for both of us. Clear?’
Draco bobbed his head a few times, felt the cock in his mouth throbbed and grew even bigger. The man, however, still seemed composed, just told him: ‘Careful. I don’t want you to choke on it. Yet.’
Praising and scolding in the same sentence. Draco felt himself burning with desire and dropping as if thrown down ten floors, then burning even hotter. He knew this was his warning. Potter was fine with him pulling a little something here and there because he enjoys to play, to chase, to conquer. But Draco already looked away from the memory ball, therefore disobeyed him once. He will not tolerate Draco’s repeat offences. And as that would postpone whatever he’s about to play with the silver balls, he would be even unhappier.
As if she knew Draco was wondering, she explained in good faith: ‘You must know the golden arrowbees. They always feed on the energy people give out when in love, and their honey is what Jupiter uses to make his arrow of love. That’s why love is so sweet, but sometimes stingslike a bee. Don’t be afraid; they will help chase away the warkspurts.’
Draco didn’t say anything, just looked back coldly with those silver eyes, and the first Crucio hit.
‘You um, you leaving?’ Draco asked, ‘I’ll walk you to the station. I can’t find James anywhere anyway, so my best guess is he’s already back at the train.’
It was not the question Potter was anticipating, he was surprised, and after a second, he said: ‘Everything… everything after fifth year wasn’t your fault. I never really met my parents, and I would have done everything to keep them alive; I can only imagine what your mother must have meant to you with years of goodnight kisses and lullabies. Everything before fifth year, well, we settled most of it, didn’t we?’
Draco felt something cracking like spring ice in his chest as he heard the words. Next to the memory ball in his hands, the little silver ball looked harmless, innocent even, and of course beautiful. But it’s also familiar.
Then he debated a little between opening Potter’s present first or the man’s present first, eventually decided he should save the best for the last, and opened Potter’s present first.
Malfoy’s fingers tightened around the crystal rod, and Harry revised: ‘Well, I have been, for a while. Not to speak ill of the Slytherins, he’s not necessarily a Slytherin, but great company, really.’
Draco turned to leave; he managed to pass Potter without blinking, bumping into Potter on purpose. To his surprise, Potter didn’t stop him by grabbing his arm or anything, but before he reached the door, Potter said without turning: ‘If you leave by that door, I will consider our Dom-sub contract over.’
‘Yeah?’ Potter frisked him, pulled out his wand and stuffed it in his hand, ‘Hold it. Hex me if you want. Doubt it would itch.’
But really, he knew the answer to all that. The thing he really wanted to know was: ‘Do you… forgive me? For what happened. Back at school. And… and everything else.’
‘Oh them!’ Lovegood smiled, ‘They tend to grow fond of the hosts who present good honey, and sometimes they help the hosts in return.’
The man was quiet again. Draco wanted to take back his question, but before he could, the man answered: ‘If it’s any comfort, yes. I grew up in a foster home, the people who raised me… let’s just say, I would make a decent house elf. The kind that would fit right in with the ones working on the Malfoy manor, by what I heard. The only difference would be, the household I grew up in favoured belt over cane. Quite a long and heavy one I’m afraid. A weapon of opportunity mostly, he was a big man.’
Of all the lights and jewelleries in the room, Potter’s emerald eyes stood out to him. They were such a vivid, vibrant green that made him remember how it was the colour of life, and there were lights in them that would shame the stars. For a second, everything of his world grows from those eyes, and the whole galaxy, the whole universe he was in was in those eyes. There were no other light, no other meanings or mysteries of life.
At the time it didn’t feel like a bad year. He made prefect, Potter didn’t; Umbridge in power meant he was finally on the good side of the headmaster (debatable), and was able to carry out his bullying with legitimacy. He had believed his father —— that he would soon bring honour to their family name. All at the same time, Potter became a liar to the wizarding world.
‘It seems you can take more.’ Potter chuckled deeply, ‘It’s quite a sight actually, seeing you cry and squirm under the cane at my mercy, your pretty little arse whipped pink. But I sincerely hope this cane can teach you a lesson about your behaviour — I do not appreciate you talking back, and do mind your language.’
Draco waited, then stroked Potter’s cheek: ‘I’m waiting for a turn, Potter. So far, you haven’t been able to make the position attractive.’
Potter was not the least bit irritated when Draco tried to block, tried to move away, or kicked and writhed fiercely. He kissed and hugged and caressed Draco every time till Draco calmed down and actually wanting for more, for though it was torture, it also sent him into ecstasy.
Draco looked back instinctively at where Potter was, but he was gone. However, the hippogriff was still there, stamping its hoofs, Draco was worried for a second, but the man had pulled him back into his embrace: ‘Don’t worry. Mr. Potter was secured. Ron will take Buckbeak —— you must be tired. Let’s go to another carriage.’
How he could be so calm was beyond Draco. Or maybe he wasn’t really very calm, because Draco really couldn’t see Potter clearly with all those tears in his eyes. He tried to wipe them away, but there’s just too many of them falling too fast.
Draco didn’t want anything to do with all things confidential, and he pulled his hand away as soon as he was sure Potter was alright. He looked around and saw they landed rather close to the station, and he just wanted to excuse himself so he can go find James: ‘I think I should leave. Whatever that is, I don’t think I have the clearance.’
At that, Draco’s anger evaporated. But he decided to pretend he was still angry and hated the pet name.
He was absolutely famished, but he was also sore in every muscle and couldn’t persuade his body to open his eyes, let alone go get something to eat.
Again thanks to Mika. She said Draco’s pile of ‘I don’t want to think about how James could be Potter’ is so high that it’s dangerously close to a landslide. So true.
Harry felt irritation growing inside him, wearing down his self control like sea waves eroding a dam. He had no intention to say or do anything though. No matter how unwilling he was, he was now the new Lord of the Wizarding World, any word from him were taken as orders, one wrong word and people would get hurt, so he learned to keep his mouth shut. Slughorn was just a clown he took pity upon, he wasn’t particularly interested in bursting his bubbles.
If Potter was so terrified to attend the Yule Ball, maybe he should just not come at all. Like the nine years before when Draco was not the planner.
Huh. Draco had never thought about that. The man did charge him a fortune, but that dress was not just expensive, he would have to be able to pull some strings to buy it.
She then asked Draco to proofread her speech, so Draco knew what she was going to say. It was beautiful, as she truly cared deeply about her students, and memorialised all the souls that were lost in the war.
But by nightfall, when the last shade of pink and purple was about to fade away, Draco excused himself from a laughing and smiling group of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, saying that he had to go find his boyfriend.
How much did Potter hear? Did he know what was going on? Or did he mistaken Draco as someone who threatens bodily harm because he was just a degraded person?
‘Technically, Draco is here after midnight, so it’s already the day of their wedding. It won’t be bad luck.’ Hermione said, ‘Now let’s go. We all got to wash and change before the wedding——ask Blaise if you need sobering potion and Pepper-up, and me if you need
‘Oh fuck you.’ He replied almost instinctively, and regretted immediately, swallowing the last syllable, as Potter dragged the cane warningly across the pink welts on his arse.
Not that Draco didn’t like it. The heat and arousal quickly fried his brain. He couldn’t have felt the full force of how much Harry wanted him another way, and he especially liked it when Harry said by his ears: ‘Say you want to be my bitch.’
Without immediate threat, Draco checked Potter’s wounds first, but he didn’t know how to heal the severed flow of magic, so he had to leave it at that, then he asked the most pressing question: ‘Please tell me you are not a Horcrux, that Voldemort hadn’t been watching when we were at it.’
Then he saw Draco walking in, and stopped himself, those obsidian eyes softened just a little: ‘Draco.’
‘Good.’ Potter said, but his tone was still harsh, even a little sarcastic, as he wasn’t convinced of his own words, but was satisfied with the progress, ‘I’m glad you learned your lesson.’
The man didn’t respond. Draco was beginning to think this might be very inappropriate. Draco was about to let go when he felt the man’s arms suddenly around his waist. The man was holding him very tight, a bit too tight, but Draco was glad. The young Potter somehow felt small in his embrace, vulnerable and hungry for love like a child at a new foster home for the first night, terrified and so hopeful he would get his first goodnight kiss. Draco lowered his head, and kissed the top of the man’s head. The messy black hair was surprisingly soft, Draco couldn’t help but ran his fingers through them, and held the man close.
The young Rosier studied him for a moment before answering: ‘The Weasley Burrow was attacked on the night of December 19th.’
According to some muggle tradition, they weren’t supposed to see each other before the wedding; that’s the only reason Potter was still staying at his apartment. Draco got out of the floo, intended to talk to Potter, but he almost tripped over…Thomas?
Potter had taken the de-aging potion. It was not the fifth-year Potter he had hoped to see. It must be what Potter looked like after the war when he dropped out of Auror training. Draco had seen
Draco walked down the stairs, and found himself just above a room that is weirdly familiar. It was a giant circular room, with its walls made of rough stones that were draped with red tapestry rimmed with golden tassels, a chandelier hanged low from the ceiling, giving out a light that was both warm and erotic. Directly across from where he stood was a burning fireplace, two long black leather sofa and a few smaller ones were placed on a thick red carpet that covered most of the floor orderly.
‘I blame it on the full moon.’ Draco said, ‘Equal Marriage Bill hadn’t even passed then. I should have said that to him: We can’t actually do that, Potter. Fortunately, I told him that…’
‘Umm… yeah actually.’ The man casted a protective charm on Draco’s arse so the hot water wouldn’t hurt him more, spelled the tap hotter before turning it on, then splashed a little on Draco’s hand, ‘Since you are staying the night, I’m guessing you prefer shower over cleaning charms, and you probably like your shower hotter than I do. Is this good for you?’
But he couldn’t talk very well, all he could do was try not to cough and struggled to breath, and Draco was furious and ashamed, he shouted as his tears fell uncontrollably: ‘Then you shouldn’t do it from the beginning! All those things you did to me… I let you did to me… How could you?’
He looked sharp and distant, the perfect Malfoy heir with the perfect fake mask. But he dislikes himself as just a Malfoy. The name that once made him proud was just meaningless letters now. Everything he liked about himself had something to do with the man: his hair was about the same length as his father, tied neatly in a queue, the man had said he didn’t much care how long Draco’s hair was, as long as he gets to bury his hand in it, and he devoted quite some effort to keep it healthy, right now, it glowed like silk of the highest quality; his skin tone was a bit pale, but the man had liked it, saying it made all the marks he left on Draco’s body distinct; he was still a bit thin, but the man, with his impressive cooking, had made him gain some weight, and ‘in all the right places’.
Draco laughed as he pushed himself up and at the man as he stood up and tried to shake all the snow from his hair like a big dog, laughing too. Draco looked around and found themselves in a muggle neighborhood; he immediately realised this must be where the man grew up. At first glance, this looked like a nice neighborhood, with neat rows of little brown houses, the garden they were in looked quite well kept except for the mess they just made.
Again and Again, it was slapped to the side and assumed its original position trembling, the pale skin painted red under Harry's cruel hand, but it was apparent that the Omega was getting more and more excited, his cock leaking and his arsehole wet.
The door of the dungeon opened, Draco quickly pretended to be unconscious, his nerve tensing as the footsteps of three kidnappers approached, and the candles on the wall lit up.
Draco didn’t notice when Potter removed the magic restraint, as the sensation hit him hard, all he could do was cling to Potter’s shoulder, cry out as a million fireworks went off behind his shut eyes. He finally had his much overdue release, bucking his hips helplessly, shooting his sperm over Potter’s chest and stomach, even a little on his face.
Potter slowly woke up, his emerald eyes watery and confused, but lit up the moment he saw Draco; it almost shattered Draco’s resolution. He sat up straight, confused as he said: ‘What…’
‘Other than Ziegler? No.’ Harry laughed. ‘But I kind of thought it’s better to incorporate it into my room of requirement, so that no one can get to it against my will as long as I’m alive.’
It’s the hell of alternation again; each time Draco couldn’t handle the heat anymore, Potter went back to paddling him, and when it hurts too much, and Draco wanted to be caressed, there will be the heating treatment. Not to mention, the ginger oil was abusing its power, soon Draco felt he was burning both inside and outside, his arse bright red and swollen, his arsehole contracting involuntarily, trembling in pain and heat. He almost doubted that his arse was cooked ripe, and was crying and begging for mercy.
Potter caught his wrists immediately, before he could even reach over his waist, and as the spanking stopped, he suddenly realised his mistake.
Harry wondered what could hold the boys out and up so late, risking to be caught, but then again, it's understandable, as the boys all seemed to be strong Alphas; at least two of them were Class A, Harry could tell. Among the three sexs, Alphas prevailed with their physical and magical strength; Omegas are valued for their ability to breed, but there are still ranks among Alphas and Omegas; the higher the rank, the stronger the Alpha, and the stronger spawn the Omega could produce. It's also true that high-rank Alphas tend to be trouble makers as they often have less impulse control and high libido, and high-rank Omegas are hypersexual too——Harry himself was a vivid example of how abhorred Alphas are to abiding rules. He distinctively remember getting their classifications in fourth year; while Ron was Class A+ Alpha and Hermione Class S Omega, Harry was one of the very rare Class S+ Alpha, which did not help with his relationship with Ron back then. It also didn't help with dating, as it's difficult for the opposite sex of a lower rank to provide sexual gratification and heir of the higher rank. His relationship with Cho failed as she was just a Class B Omega. Sure he could make any Omega rut for him, but any Omega below Class A won't be able to make him knot, and that's just frustrating.
The suggestion of giving up control, to have someone else guide him to fight the hopeless fight he had been fighting for years, to take care of him and make him feel better was too delicious and too close for Draco to decline. Even though his guilt kept gnawing him in the background that this wasn’t something he deserve.
‘Do it.’ Potter demanded coldly, ‘Come. I would very much like to see that —— show me the good slut you are.’
Again, Potter was surprisingly skilled with a belt, he controlled the force and pace, reddening Draco’s arse and upper thigh just within Draco’s endurance. To be fair, he wasn’t too cruel, Draco’s hard cock spoke to that. He never thought he would be into pain, but the man had a way to arouse pleasure from the pain. However, Draco was delicate, soon he couldn’t keep up the counting, just trying his best not to fall off the bed, moaning and sobbing at the pain.
A lot of Omegas and Betas, especially since they are taking the class with the seventh years, gave up on looking for an Alpha partner immediately and looked to Harry instead.
Draco wanted to say no, but he knew it was the truth. Despite what he said, Ginevra Weasley had everything. The Weasley family was undoubtedly the most prominent pureblood family after the war, she was the only girl in the family with so many brothers at the top of their lines of work, and she was beautiful with flawless character.
‘Ahhh! I’m sorry… sorry for my disrespectful behaviour, sir —— thank you, sir. May I have another please?’
He grunted softly in annoyance, his smile immediately vanishing as he straightened and looked up where of course Potter was standing a few yards away, quickly becoming drenched, staring at him.
He paused for some immeasurable amount of time near the man’s cock, his face pressed into the curls of dark hair at its base, overwhelmed by the smell of musk, the tang of pre-come heavy in the air. Then he licked a stripe of skin at the junction of his leg and torso, just behind his bollocks, hearing himself groan when the act prompted Potter’s hips to jut sharply into the air and a curse to come tearing out of the man’s mouth.
The man's joyful laughter accompanied them down to the hotel pool, where once they'd changed into swim trunks Potter shoved an enormous glass of alcohol, too many straws, and miraculously several glorious ice cubes into Draco’s hand and then snapped a picture of him holding it against a flushed cheek.
The next day brought an incredibly boring lecture on home electronics, which must have been copied directly from the lesson Fry had given on the subject back in May since there were several terrible jokes shared that Draco
A moan tore through him, the sound starting somewhere in his chest and travelling roughly along his throat. Potter’s hand still had a firm grip on his hair, holding his head back, while his other hand was on his arse grinding their hips together.
“I’ll think about it,” he heard himself reply, then he pursed his lips. “Thanks, Potter, for saving my life again. And for not being too much of a git this past month.”
There was laughter over something that Draco had probably just missed when they entered the drawing room, then as the room’s occupants caught sight of him they all fell silent. Well, almost all of them did.
He set to work, setting the charms and then manipulating their strength, testing them while standing and while flying, until he determined a configuration that seemed adequate for his size, weight, and build. Then he unsheathed his knife and started carving, making a thumb-sized indent an inch over from the stone. He felt a smile form on his lips as his mind called up memories of certain badges he’d made what felt like a lifetime ago.
The next morning Potter arrived holding two brooms and Draco promptly Apparated them to Great Mewstone, where they appeared standing on rocky hillside with sparse clumps of grass. There was a strong wind whipping the rain against them, the sky was a dismal grey, and twenty or so feet again the hill abruptly dropped into a steep rocky shore, where the ocean’s waves were loudly crashing.
Draco couldn’t contain his incredulous expression. “How is that even a question?” The man had been absolutely maddening. Infuriating.
A few hours later he hadn’t successfully managed to get the charm to activate when he tested by asking Vince to perch on the broom, but it was activating whenever he so much as touched it. To be certain, though, he wanted another tester.
Pansy’s name was a common one in the society pages, since she’d apparently had some torrid affair with a squib Italian designer a few years earlier and somehow turned into a fashion icon. Theo’s name was all over the business pages after purchasing about half the shops in Knockturn Alley and turning them into a large assembly hall. Even Greg, whose Azkaban sentence had been a mere two years long, was now a well-regarded chef in Cardiff.
Potter let out a gusty exhale and shoved his hands in his pockets, kicking at the floor with a foot a few times before looking back up at him. “Not really, no. I’d make the same decision again. I just—I didn’t do it because I don’t care about what you want. I did it because I’m worried that something bad will happen. And I didn’t want to just ignore that worry, and regret it for the rest of my life when something bad actually
There was a pause, and Draco looked over to see a resigned expression on the other man’s face. “Potter, I know my mother. She didn’t just agree to give up. Not without something else in return.”
Draco only had a broad understanding of what the Internet was from his classes, since he had no electricity here in the woods and didn’t feel the need to own a computer, but he felt a bit more at ease now that Granger had acknowledged her interest in the subject for the subject’s sake. Because that at least felt like something he could wrap his head around.
Then he realised that his quilt had a warm arm around his chest and a hard cock pressed up against his back and groaned, pressing back into it, idly musing that Vince was going to be bloody furious with him once he finally made it home but he didn’t quite care at the moment.
“Vince, you’re free to take off when you like. I’ll see you at home,” Draco told the owl who’d been watching him with a narrow gaze.
There was a silence for several beats while Draco considered all of the reasons the man had to be worried about him, then he replied, “I know.”
“Sure, no problem. I’ll be back up in a few, just going to put away the extras.” There were the sounds of Potter clomping down the stairs, then quiet.
“Hey.” He looked up, and Potter was looking at him with his concerned intensity. “It’s fine. I mean, it’s not, it’s really fucking sad, but it’s fine. That’s all in the past, and now he’s just a kid who has a huge family, even if most of us aren’t related by blood. He knows he’s loved.”
“Well, nice of you to turn up,” Draco commented, standing and feeling his joints pop. With a groan he started on some stretches, wincing at the first few.
,” Potter whimpered, his fingers digging hard into Draco’s shoulders, and the sound of his name falling from Potter’s lips in that tone almost brought him to the edge.
Draco blinked his eyes open as he muttered a curse. “Fine,” he bit out. “At least then your nudity will be situationally appropriate.
“You can’t just go diving sixty metres underwater and then surface as if pressure doesn’t matter! The body can’t handle abrupt shifts in pressure! We discussed this! You read about it! I know you did!”
Potter spun around, then chucked the broom his way. “Yeah. Just stick within six inches of the end, if you can. Otherwise you might mess with the stability.”
He was just making his way back to the cabin after another night spent in the clearing, shivering slightly at the dampness of his clothes following some overnight drizzle, when the crack of Apparition interrupted his grumbling to Vince. After exchanging a frown with the owl he hurried his pace, his eyes widening when he spotted Potter waiting on his front step.
That first Monday Draco spent the morning in the bath, wallowing as he hadn’t in weeks, or possibly months. The afternoon was spent curled up under his quilt with only his head emerging from it, knowing that all that remained of his spaceflight project was fastening the set of three brooms to the trunk and furnishing the interior of the expanded space.
Hermione laughed brightly. “Oh, definitely not. We cleared out all of them when we found that most of the containers were cursed horribly. And it’s not like Harry does his own brewing.”
“How much time do you expect this experiment to take? I could probably spare three evenings a week, at most.”
Something about the way that his arrival had flustered Potter made his chest clench uncomfortably. “I brought this,” he said, his voice slightly raspy. He handed over the bottle and then removed his coat.
Vince shifted restlessly on his perch as he did when he was ready for a hunt, so Draco opened the door again and watched as his friend set off into the night.
“That’s good,” he forced out, not looking over. He was drying his mug, which he usually left out to air dry, and soon would run out of things to ostensibly keep him busy in this part of the cabin.
“It’s not a break. I’ll have finished my year of classes by then.” When Potter’s mouth rounded in an ‘oh’ of understanding Draco added, “So after that I’ll be keeping busy around here. If I’m not home when you Apparate in, either holler or wait. I’ll be around.”
He would have known this was the right address even without coordinates; it’s dark and unwashed and unlit, overwrought with ivy and tall grass—an eyesore among the well-maintained family homes even in the blackness of night. Knocking on the door seems too senseless so he moves silently along the side of the property, towards a sliver of light through a thin basement window that’s cracked open, hung low against the grass.
“Ah. Congratulations, sir.” He wants to jump into the Great Lake, and perhaps find himself engulfed by the squid.
In truth, however, only Luna has mentioned Draco in relation to a mastery. As far as he knows, Harry should be perplexed.
In Charms and Curses, he brushes fingertips over the copies of his work, considering with a wild hair how positively evil it would feel to post a copy of his
Orsix hoots and kicks off the ledge into the trees, and just like that the message is out of his hands. He rewards himself finally with a hot shower to rinse his morning sweat and ire off. Occasionally, he reaches a dripping arm out of the shower curtain to take a sip of the coffee he’s brewed and left on the vanity. He tries hard to keep his mind off Orsix’s current path. By the time the bathroom is sufficiently steamed and he feels clean, he’s thought of nothing else.
It’s an ivory-stoned wizarding institution of central London and they’re ushered through quickly without a single fuss about Harry’s addition, though there’s no telling whether it’s common practice or a reaction to which famous bespectacled man made them four. Pansy practically pulls Harry into the chair beside her, and Draco’s getting the sense that he’d be her newest project if he let her.
It’s a tad cooler in the shadow of the mangroves, but they’re both still sticky with sweat when they reemerge into the sun and Draco beaches them on a small island shaded in coconut groves. He removes his life jacket and pulls out sandwiches and waters.
“You’re sociopathic,” he says to Lucrezia as she looks to her sibling. She nods her head curtly. “You’re—“
He tiptoes around papers and books on the messy study floor like an adventurer deftly avoiding booby traps while Harry hangs back in the doorway. He stoops down and when he turns back to Harry, he has the skull in his hands.
They apparate to just outside the Ministry, then take the guest entrance in. It’s been eight years since Draco’s probation ended but it still feels wrong to willingly enter the building. He’s grateful that he doesn’t need to go past the atrium, and that he’s sandwiched between friends. A trip deeper might do him in.
He flashes his teeth, nodding his head in greeting. “Pratik Shah, Harry Potter. To see you walk in today… it is the last thing I expected.”
Dante’s large yellow eyes meet his, so he lifts his index finger to his lips to shush him as he tiptoes around. The kneazle blinks them shut—
It’s so tiring and yet relieving to hear him capable of complaining. “You want to enter St. Mungo’s in just your pants? Because we’re leaving immediately and I’m not going to waste time not having you seen because you wouldn’t wear a bloody dressing gown.”
A few minutes later Potter managed to haul himself upright again and reached for his glass, taking several long sips before turning to meet Draco’s gaze. His eyes were full of pain, and Draco had to look down toward his drink.
“Hmm, there we are.” She flipped the switch back and the fire immediately extinguished inside the chamber. Twenty seconds later there was a quiet
He swallowed hard, turned his head away, and finally opened his eyes. His breathing was still uneven.
“Not a problem. I take it Harry’s not here yet?” Draco shook his head as she sat down on the loveseat, pulling her coat off and digging a thermos out of her bag. “I hope you don’t mind that I brought coffee. Tea’s lovely, but I’m afraid it doesn’t quite do the trick for me in the morning.” She cracked the lid and steam rose from the container, filling the cabin with its rich, almost nutty, aroma.
The last thing of Potter that he saw that evening was a glare before he turned back toward the wood stove, his shoulders only relaxing when he heard the door close followed by the sound of Disapparition.
Draco chanced a look up as Eddie’s parents rose to their feet and approached to collect him, and accidentally caught sight of Potter. Who was still looking at him like
He accidentally bumps shoulders with Draco on the pavement and pretends not to notice the entire arm’s length the man keeps between them afterwards, instead pointing out the bushes he’d gotten sick in on Ron’s stag night a lifetime ago. He
Draco’s thoughts are stuck between squirming under the truth of the accusation and celebrating the proof that he’d been right to restrain some information for so long as he wanted to coast along with his feelings unrecognised.
“Cheers,” he says, closing his eyes for a moment to appreciate the sun climbing from behind the clouds.
All three jump from the eardrum-bursting volume booming in the first word from the commentary box. The young voice echoes, reverberating off the stands, and the chatter dies for a moment before picking back up.
When he opens one eye to sneak a look, Draco’s face is lit dimly by his wand hovering over the book, and he licks the tip of a finger to turn the page. Harry sighs in contentment at the day and at Draco before he can stop himself and quickly snaps his eyes shut when Draco’s head begins to turn. After a count of thirty, he opens them again, but Draco is still staring right back. Harry closes his eyes again.
The gates were only half open when he slipped out of the lift, stalking to the floo before he did something he’d regret. He’d gone straight to Pansy’s, not needing to be told she and Blaise would both be there.
He’s still lingering on that strange frown when he arrives at Hermione’s. He’d run straight to work, his Auror robes pulled wrinkled from his knapsack and thrown hastily over exercise clothes to retrieve the rest of his case notes before Murray or Lucrezia can request them. By the time he stands at Hermione’s door, then, he’s properly grumpy, but she looks excited to see him, and for this alone he smiles back—this and the fact that she took an entire half-day off work for him and has read multiple books about mid-nineteenth century immigration.
Harry lets Draco shampoo his hair instead of trying to raise his arms again, laughing lightly when he even shields his eyes as he ducks under the stream. He kisses him gingerly under the flood of the water, and holds him close with his chin tucked against Harry’s shoulder, one arm around his waist and the other hand on the back of his head. They stand still for a long while, holding tight, immovable. If Harry's face wettens a tad in overwhelming relief as he feels Draco's body against him, the water disguises it.
,” she adds, making a show of eating one, “Blaise and I have already RSVP’d.” She grants him a smug look. She knows she’s caught him by surprise.
“Hermione will be more responsive than Ron, probably,” he says as they cross a small park. It’s a nice night out, just chilly enough to need a coat, and there’s a pickup football game on between a group of teens, lit by streetlamps in the open field. The sound of their shouting echoes through the quieting streets. “He’s been a bit slow to wrap his head around this.”
“You know, I haven’t thought about it in years,” she says, “but my dad owns a few acres in Wiltshire, adjacent to the Malfoy property. They were an old acquirement, some great-aunt died… the Malfoys wanted to purchase it and he refused due to their political leanings.”
She looks between them sourly, from Ron’s exasperated look to the smile Harry’s hiding into his wine glass, as if just remembering that they’re still the immature boys she’d grown up with. Then something crosses her mind, a flash of alarm, and her eyes grow.
instead. The England Quidditch team merchandise on the wall is tacked up haphazardly, without pomp, and most of the walls remain boringly beige. There’s music, at least. And cheerful chatter.
Thankfully, his news is forgotten as the conversation turns back to work. Blaise asks about his writing in diversion from the awkwardly created silence and Draco grasps onto it enthusiastically. He’s providing a rendition of Marta’s merciless critiques when Pansy begins trying to interrupt him.
They move fast when the words leave his mouth, falling together with a mutual desire for a belated intimacy. Draco can’t decide where to put his hands. He wants them everywhere. Harry’s hair, his chest, his biceps, his hips, his thighs.
“Is it working?” comes the playful response, followed by a slow kiss. Draco breathes a sigh through his nose, tilting down to meet Harry better.
Draco hadn’t said ‘I love you’ exactly, but they both know he’s said it. He’d said it on stage that night, in a way. He’d said it in the preface, too. And he’d said it so clearly in the dedication that Harry had grown silent for a worryingly long time. Draco presented the real editor’s copy excitedly when he’d arrived at his door for dinner one evening, watched him inspect the cover and the back before flipping to the inscription and freezing completely:
doesn’t get you thinking terrible things then I think you need to have a deeper search of your sexuality.”
Ron joins in from his other side. “Look, you and I will go tomorrow. We’ll sort out your hunch about Murray, see if we can find anything on him before he knows we know. Malfoy’s in holding, so… he’ll be alright, so long as he can handle spending the night in a room that shares a toilet and bed with little privacy.”
When he looks back to Draco again to try and communicate, he's surprised to see that he's eyeing him already, repeatedly staring at him, flicking his eyes around the room, then shaking his head. Harry can't decipher it, and he looks frustrated by this, but his gaze moves up past Harry before he can try to communicate back—a firm grip lands on his shoulder. Hadrian had come closer during the exchange, and now pushes forcefully to drop Harry to his knees. The tip of a wand prods into his temple and he scowls.
“I’m being civil, alright? This is a small gym, so I’m going to be the bigger man and not avoid you.” Harry takes a patient breath at the insinuation that this makes him the lesser man. “It’s not as if you can wave a magic wand and make it all better. What happened in the locker room—“
Jack closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. When he opens them, he looks like he’s trying hard to appear okay, a shaky smile plastered on. He puts his hands on Harry’s shoulders, arms locked awkwardly.
Perhaps this was them, he thinks. Perhaps Hogwarts had simply been their rising sun, and now he needed patience and understanding, just in time for the afternoon light to pass the mountain’s bulk and shimmer on the valley.
Potter doesn’t rise to match his volume or stature. Instead, he scratches his neck nervously, even-toned. “I dunno, I saw you walk out, and you looked unhappy, so…”
“It’s a formality, you see. To double-check the evidence in a situation where the previous specialist has been terminated.”
Harry looks back down at his plate with a pained look. He’d been sure this moment was coming, but it hadn’t stopped him from procrastinating a prepared answer all day. He goes with his gut.
By then, the sky was turning purple and pink, so they found four a.m. breakfast at a Muggle diner, and that was when, while she was simply a consideration, his two best friends asked him to be Rose’s godfather.
“Erm, Harry, got a second?” Ron asks. Hermione stands beside him with Rose on her hip, putting him in an unnerving spotlight.
this is?” he prods instead, sauntering back into Harry’s personal space. It sounds belittling, the way he says it, but there’s a warmth to it that long ago stopped him from taking such things personally.
Harry sits forward on the edge of the sofa. “God, I’m sorry, ‘Mione, I was really excited for today, things have just… they’ve been a little hard to manage lately. But I’ll get out of your hair. I just need to… I need to…” He trails off. There is no plan, really, to move forward. He’s lost.
the spell! She’d be in a lot worse of a state!” he spits, nodding towards the recovering woman with the little mobility he has left.
, this is such a good opportunity! Here.” He transfigures a box to ready transport for the items, and Harry levitates the vial in. “That’s so interesting—the vial isn’t cursed at all, in fact, you could touch it. The blood inside was
“He’s not that skinny…” Harry furrows his brows, contemplative. “And I’ve not seen him scrunch his nose up once. Maybe there’s been a miracle and he’s finally not disgusted to be in the same room as all of us.” He adjusts his glasses absently in easy conversation. “Surely we’ve all grown out of that petulant rubbish from school, right? Besides, he must be busy doing… something. And his robes are a bit snobbish, aren’t they? If he’s kept a good tailor, his job must be going alright...”
He pulls Harry by the arm back through the department to his office, closes the door softly and casts a silencing charm. Instantly, the muffled white noise of the Ministry vanishes, as if they’re in a void.
“Well, you said it first; you’re not an Auror. I’ll decide how I investigate,” Harry says quietly, affirmatively. It’s a sign that their friendship has progressed that he’s not offended, just mostly proud of Harry for standing his own.
“I’d be more concerned if this didn’t make you want to get work done,” he says. “Go ahead. I’m not going anywhere unless you want me to.”
Slowly, dipping their toes ever-so-cautiously into unspoken topics, they nestled into the plush, sinking couches in Ron and Hermione’s cosy living room and shared explicit confessions of how life after Hogwarts—after Voldemort—really felt, and how they all needed each other now more than ever.
Her gaze drifts again, and she takes a sip of the wine as she cocks her head and lingers on the corner of the wall.
They pass into a dark creek. Aerial roots brush lightly against them as they drift, and Draco’s reminded of the thick bramble of the Forbidden Forest. He almost says something, a reach for common ground, but follows an instinct not to. He’s plenty comfortable in the easy silence between them, and his view of Harry rowing strongly with impressive form.
He’d begun to rub his thumb distractedly across Draco’s wrist, and they both watch it instead of daring to make eye contact. “It’s… it’s closer to… one more way to separate yourself from the boy you were physically as much as you feel you already have inside, right? There are so many other markers of your change, though. You don’t need it.”
But while he might be projecting what his insecurities would be in Harry’s position, the man himself looks recovered. He chats casually with the waiter like they’re mates, and Draco watches as the smartly-dressed man’s unbreakable formal stature relaxes under Harry’s attention. It’s only when meeting Draco’s watchful eye, apparently, that his friend’s discomfort is palpable.
he thinks, in a lazy attempt to mark this trip as fueled by anything but his mother’s intimidating influence.
Ron waggles his eyebrows and pulls a scarf from the pocket of his coat. They turn to leave, Harry still standing alone by his desk, when he stops and turns back quickly.
“Ten years ago, I began my journey to defeat the very personification of evil and restore peace to the wizarding world…” he recites under his breath as he removes his shirt and running shorts.
He watches Draco’s face tighten and knows him well enough to tell that he’s deciding what to say. How much to let Harry in. He’s surprised by the candour he offers when he opens his mouth.
“I know my wife’s ethnicity,” Ron says sternly. “What I’m saying is, there’s—she has photos of her grandparents in Jamaica though, right? Immediate family. It’s… different.”
Draco catches Jack’s eye with a wide smug grin, eyes wild and stature pompous. He bends at the waist and leans his head forward, cheating his left cheek towards his opponent. With his teeth flashing, more disturbing with the mouthguard in, he taps a pointer finger brazenly to his jaw, as if to say
He’s moving weights and a yoga mat and other miscellaneous gym items to the outer edges of the room, so Draco knows before he’s told that they’re going to be wrestling. He’s not surprised, considering how well Jack had grappled with him last week.
He tries to send an apologetic look, but perhaps it’s too soon to attempt something that affable with Potter, because he looks more confused by the expression than anything. He never tells him why he’s not living at the ancestral home, but he does begin to wax poetic about muggle London with a new burst of passion, likely fueled in part by Draco’s pro-muggle speech.
His father had told him Blaise wouldn’t be attending the Cup, spliced somewhere into a rant about old wizarding families not doing their part. Blaise doesn’t need to know that, and because his avoidance tactic clearly isn’t working anyway, he takes advantage of the guess and hopes it passes as genuine.
Ron’s mouth goes slack and he glances around as if the Minister for Magic might be standing behind him. “Fucking hell, you’re not joking.”
“That powerful trace that doesn’t have Darkness,” he begins, dropping Harry’s hand and rifling for the diagnostics. He presents the data proudly and watches interested green eyes skate across quickly. “You felt
“Thank you. I… I like ‘mint gum’, too, still,” Draco finally whispers. “I think you could call me anything and I’d be honoured just to be addressed.” He falls back into silence, then after a beat murmurs, “Harry?... Harry?”
He’s pulling a blanket from where it’s been draped on a trunk by the window when he catches sight of Draco’s work. Like before, one section of papers is labelled ‘
There is no malice in the shushing, just the familiar quieting he’s received more than a few times when he got too chatty as they worked. He’d learned not to fight it when the other man was in a rush of inspiration.
“This way,” he says quietly. If looks could hex, Draco would be a national threat—he’s glancing fiercely around, as if daring a Ministry employee to look his way. Harry dismantles the shield on the empty office and ushers him in. “The white lilies are the cursed ones,” he pointed, “but I wasn’t sure about the rest, I thought you…”
’, but unlike before, it’s been covered completely in his script. He takes it with him back to the couch and sinks in, pulling the blanket up and holding the pages so they’re illuminated by the firelight.
“Thank you, er… Cadry,” Draco mumbled, his arms emerging from within the blanket to take the platter. When he turned to the bed Harry was sitting up, wild with bedhead and face pink with restrained laughter. He hadn't heard the end of it for weeks.
It’s a large office for someone who prefers to work from home, appeasement under the guise of promotion he’d received around the time he’d been dubbed ‘Too precious to risk in the field.’ A bribery office, to make up for the slow shift into desk work he’d been subjected to.
“Seats four,” says the merchant, joining them when he sees their interest. “Flies high as the clouds.”
“The Blacks! And Narcissa. Of course, it’s been so long since Sirius—since anyone from my family mentioned it. Have you been
Harry thinks of hot breath in his ear, Draco’s weight on his legs. “He—yes, he took it well enough.”
Draco doesn’t answer, but he does attempt to take him down again. Harry counters him hypocritically, with the same confidence in his strength that he’d pointed to as Jack’s fatal flaw, and Draco smirks and dodges swiftly. Harry looks shaken, surprised—just as Draco likes him—and they lock eyes.
“I’ve met the woman twice,” he murmurs, laying his head back against the stone and closing his eyes. The tone in his voice suggests that he’s exhaustively asked himself the same question.
week I thought you’d never want to be my friend again. And now we’ve practically spent every moment together.”
All is awkward for the first minutes after Draco shows up at Harry’s door Wednesday evening. He hears the knock while he’s scrambling to find his shoes, and lets Draco in without much talk or greeting. He remembers that his favourite trainers are upstairs, and by the time he returns, he sees that his friend has moved to the living room. When he finally speaks, the tension in the air disappears.
incapability to communicate. I am a closed-off man who’s forgotten how to navigate healthy relationships.”
He sighs, trying to connect the dots. He wonders if he’d had that resting sad look on during dinner again or something. Sure, work was strange lately. His boss was an ethical workplace nightmare, and he wasn’t sure how he was supposed to feel about being assigned a huge case again.
“I’m not going to share them around! No one will see them. They’re for me. You know, sightseeing pictures. So I can remember the places we’ve been.”
“Breathing. Warmth. Fucking UV.” He ticked the items off on the fingers of the hand that wasn’t holding a mug. Then he got a crafty sort of look and casually said, “Hermione was impressed, actually.”
He threw together some breakfast and thought about what he might do to pass the time that week while he waited for the kettle to heat up, frowning when his thoughts kept turning over to Potter.
Not releasing the captured flesh his pressed his hands forward to the man’s flies and quickly dealt with them, pulling down his waistband and pants as far as he could in their position to release his straining cock, hearing himself moan as the smell of arousal hit his senses. Then he wrapped his hand around the length, smearing a thumb through the pre-come that was gathered at the tip and started to stroke hard, flicking his tongue against the abused nipple all the while.
That evening he was just dislodging icicles from the edge of his roof when a loud crack sounded behind him, and he turned to see Potter walking up to the front door carrying the broom with the stone insert.
On Monday after class he busied himself mashing the majority of the berries with his mortar and pestle before slopping the mess into his saucepan, setting it to bubble away with some sugar, salt, and a few other additions on the wood stove.
Potter huffed and grabbed the broom. “I don’t think so.” A quick spell later and there was a large red and gold bow tied around the handle.
Once they broke apart Draco let his forehead fall against Potter’s shoulder, breathing unsteadily, his racing pulse only just beginning to slow. He could feel the other man trailing a hand up and down his arm, leaving goose pimples in their wake.
“Then they started throwing around accusations about illegal potions use, dark curses, awful things like that because of your identity, so I contacted Hermione because I couldn’t think of anything else that didn’t involve throwing an epic tantrum.”
“Kreacher,” he then said to the quiet room, “Can you please bring us two glasses and a bottle of something with alcohol in it?”
“I should probably head home,” Potter said in a strange voice. “It’s getting late. The platters are already charmed to keep things preserved, so you don’t need to worry about them turning for at least a week.”
Draco opened eyes he hadn’t realised he’d closed and looked around at the pier, taking in the sight of the little sailboats that were scattered over the very blue water halfway between the edge of the docks and the opposite shore. Quite a bit farther down the pier there was an enormous boat, so large that he even hesitated to call it a boat and not a floating fortress painted in gleaming white, absolutely covered in rows and rows of windows. Between where they stood and that monstrosity there were plenty of people walking along the water’s edge, some at a leisurely pace looking downward at their mobiles, others taking photographs of the view.
In the following days Potter didn’t bring up the subject of Draco’s cowardice again, for which he was grateful. He also didn’t make any more terrifying declarations, though knowing the man Draco wasn’t certain that they weren’t a moment away from another one.
He could see Potter’s fingers tightening their hold on the mug so much that the joints were white, but he didn’t pull away from Draco’s faint touch.
“It’s fine,” Draco said, and his voice sounded hoarse. He cleared his throat. “Really. Thank you, you didn’t need to do this.” He tore his eyes away from the display and looked over at Potter.
Potter was right there, and was smiling at him, and the warmth from the broom was making the enormous snowflakes melt into nothingness as they drifted into his hair. And the heat in the air was climbing into Draco’s cheeks, and he couldn’t
Draco couldn’t contain his scoff and turned to face him. Their eyes met and the moment seemed to drag on, the weight of concern in Potter’s heavy gaze drawing him in until he couldn’t hear the crackling of the fire right next to him. He swallowed, not knowing how to break the intensity.
“Oh. Right. No, I’ll just go then. Er, see you in a few days.” Then mercifully he turned and left, the crack of Disapparition sounding a few moments later.
“Foraging?” Draco slid his gaze to the side and caught a perplexed look on Potter’s face, which quickly morphed into worry.
“I’m not doing this so that I can die, Potter. If I wanted that I wouldn’t bother will all of this spellwork. I wouldn’t even bother with the brooms, actually. There are plants in these woods that I could eat with far less effort.”
He spent the better part of the day outside, the fresh air helping to keep him clear-headed while he organised his thoughts. He was finding it more and more difficult to handle the letters from his mother; he’d expected it to be the opposite, that he’d become accustomed to the distance, but he wasn’t feeling so apathetic in recent weeks. It hurt.
The next hour, two hours, possibly even longer passed in exploration of various shipwrecks, some deep enough in the underwater gullies that the only light was that of his wand. It was eerily quiet, and a few times Draco would fly around a wall of kelp to find himself face to face with a fish. After withdrawing from one kelp-covered gully he decided that he was satisfied with the enchantments and that there had been enough testing for the day, since his hips and shoulders were beginning to ache from the amount of effort it was taking to direct the broom.
He expects an old library, maybe, or another market with something specific he needs, but they reappear surrounded by lush greenery, and Harry realises they’re in a garden.
He leaves Harry leaning against a half-wall under a covered entranceway, staring with interest at a sign reading ‘
Of course, the same notoriety that kept him safe from paparazzi ensured death glares from every passerby in Diagon Alley, so he didn’t set foot there, either. He was much more content to see no one, occasionally have Pansy and Blaise over for tea or drinks, and spend all his time reading and wandering the grounds of the estate.
Harry chuckles politely. He had gone so easily, hadn’t he? Draco Malfoy not putting up a fight. It was frustratingly confusing, but suggests that he’d corroborate Hermione’s plan of action. In a way, he’d known this was coming, too. He’d just been too hopeful that they’d outrun it to be pragmatic.
They certainly didn’t speak about how Draco lowered his wand in the astronomy tower. How he, too, had been threatened with death by Voldemort. How he was just seventeen, in way over his head, living with the choices his parents made, and punished for their sins alongside his own. This would be too much acknowledgment of the grey area, the complexities on both sides of the war.
The mirror is quickly steaming, obscuring his features into blurry shapes, and he drops his hands from his hair. It’s a perfect picture of what Draco’s done to him; the same thing that had caused light conversation in bed now, in the absence of that contagious happiness, simply looks like a lack of self-care. He’s been so focused on Draco that he’s forgotten himself.
“—listen! Don’t I read all Draco’s books? Sit through Blaise’s frightening practice opening and closing remarks?”
Draco frowns thoughtfully. “We are… two people who are attracted to each other and would like to be more to each other. And… what happens next is we act like more to each other.” He lowers his arms and grabs his right ankle, pulling it up behind him. “And I love that our friends know we’re close, but maybe we keep these specifics to ourselves. Not because I’m ashamed,” he clarifies quickly, eyebrows raised.
“I swear I didn’t eat slowly to tease you and your ‘No work talk during dinner rule,’” he tells her, sipping his wine.
The week before, when he’d been procrastinating his speech and staring at the blank paper, Harry had jokingly called from the kitchen, “You know, I think it counts as name-dropping to acknowledge me in your speech—I’d just steer clear entirely.”
But then he murmurs, “This is a little belittling, don’t you think?” an inch from Harry’s face. “I’m a grown man.”
It’s not a word he takes lightly, but Draco loves Dante. He’d gotten him as a kitten in Diagon Alley a few years back when the flat had begun to feel especially lonely. Dante’s done well at filling the space and loving him back, and was eerily good at knowing when he’s in distress, even for a creature with an affinity for reading peoples’ trustworthiness. Just as importantly, to him at least, Dante was one of the few living things that only knew post-war Draco.
Hermione taps her finger against her lips thoughtfully. “Not just with your wands maybe, but a specialist might.”
Now, he wants to sate his curiosity—discover what he’s been doing for a decade, why on Earth he’s dragged himself to a Ministry-hosted Hogwarts event, how much he undoubtedly regrets it now—but can’t force a single word out into the hanging silence.
Seamus suddenly decides he’s not needed, too little too late, and disappears with a rushed goodbye, leaving Ginny to take his seat. Ron, either graciously or feeling the chill in the room, makes for the bar.
There were only two people who could summon a heartbroken Harry from his curtained bedroom and they had invited him to dinner, presumably hoping a meal could coax him out. With the blinding flash of reporters’ cameras still scored into his vision, he was moody before he’d even arrived.
His arse is now burning, he could feel the ten harder strikes welt higher and burning even more painfully than the rest.
At first the man thought it was because of the fierce orgasm that ripped through Draco, but he soon realised that was not the case. Draco was biting down hard on his lips, tears streaming down his cheeks.
Malfoy caught it rather gracefully with his seeker reflex, his lips pulled into a thin line, Harry could guess what Malfoy would say: why do you think I would want to brew the potion with you, Potter? You are terrible at Potions, and your scents are weird. But Malfoy didn’t say anything, just proceeded to deal with it, a faint hue of pink on his cheeks as the potent scent of Harry’s filled their bubble.
Potter stopped for a second, as if surprised, and stroked his cheek lightly, this time even more comforting and complimenting. Potter then vanished his restraints and went to adjust his posture, making him stand on his forefoot, raising his arse even higher in the air. His arse hurt just by stretching, but he complied. He knew that this position would not only drown him in the shame of Potter seeing his arsehole, but also have all his muscles tense, and hurt a lot more when the cane lands.
The way Potter looked up at Draco, his eyelashes like a startled butterfly, only letting the emerald colour shone through occasionally, and the way he was blushing, was like he was a fucking virgin, nervous as the man he loved just pinned him to the bed. He almost made Draco feel guilty.
There were still twenty more strikes left when Potter released the restraints, taking him in his arms and sat at the couch.
‘Never picked Emerald as the type to spoil his sub.’ Someone teased, ‘None of my subs would ever dare to make sounds or move.’
Then it dawned on him. This —— what they have, couldn’t have been real. It was too good, too quick, and too effective. How long was it —— two months? And he just went from hating Draco to crazy in love with him? No way. It’s just simply impossible.
Now Draco was kneeling on the floor, his platinum hair ruffled, silver eyes teary and red rimmed, lips chafed rosy and swollen, cum tainting his pretty face and part of his shirt and Slytherin tie, cock hard between those lean pale legs wearing only black socks and garters, arse still red and plump. He was burning with desire, the colour of his eyes gleaming like liquid mercury. Probably the most beautiful scene the man’s ever seen, and a frame taken right out of his childhood fantasy.
Despite the fact that many Alphas had visited the Omega tonight, it was the first time he was stimulated to the point of abandon or loss of self-control that he opened up his gonocoel. Harry could tell because the new pathway opened up to him was tight as a virgin, sensitive to the point of painful to any touch.
‘What, you are afraid to say anything else?’ Draco forced out the words sarcastically; his heart was pounding hard; he’s not even sure what he was talking about, just thinking while he was talking, buying himself time somehow, ‘Why Forgecount? His partner Rosier would be the much better choice; he’s a pureblood, has a much better connection with his family. You chose to impose Forgecount because he was divorced, has no children, and didn’t talk much, right? Makes sense. He’s one of the most isolated people I’ve ever seen. It would be difficult to figure out he was imposed.’
However, the man didn’t seem affected by the holiday spirit, Draco brushed elbows with him, and asked as quiet as the man can hear him: ‘You have something against New Year?’
He smiled as he pulled his hand back, inserting one finger into the Omega’s tight hole. He was good with his hand, fingers rather long and calloused from holding quills, wand and broom, he had never had a chance to familiarise himself with playing the piano or violin, but it’s the closest he had ever felt to it, the tip of his finger brush through the veins and texture of the Omega’s hole, turning and scissoring at the rhythm of his choosing, and drawing every reaction he wanted from the Omega, like an instrument that companied him for years playing a beautiful piece with him.
He wondered how just the presence the man could make him so happy, heal his wounds and make him forget about all the grey in his life, smiled as he started putting on his gear.
He could tell they had finally got saved, not by the Aurors, though, probably some rogue action carried out by Dumbledore’s army or something, as he managed to make out from his shaking vision that the neo-death eaters had been captured and were being guarded by Lovegood and Longbottom. More than a few Weasleys were running around. Forgecount was already healed, presumably after a few vials of hematinic potions, and was sitting by Draco’s side on another stretcher.
Not that it's a bad thing, no. She's just——She's just pregnant. It happened as an accident, a bit reckless for someone like Hermione, but they all thought for a while they wouldn't be able to make it through the war. She couldn't even pinpoint the time it happened, surprised by it when she went to St. Mangos to check out her weird rut periods.
Again it was a delicious sight to the man, seeing the forever self-righteous blonde at his weakest, so fragile to the point of near breaking. There was the beauty he tried to pull together, and the beauty that threatened to break through, as if he were a glass bottle full of pearlescent starry liquid on the verge of shattering into a hundred shinny pieces.
Ok. Draco told himself. It’s good to know in advance. So he could have a few years to prepare himself…hopefully. Potter wanted to get married by thirty-five, but he would have to date his wife or husband or partner——Potter was pansexual——beforehand, right? For what, a year or two? Maybe three? That gave Draco how long, five years, if Potter didn’t meet the right person tomorrow?
The man would be able to feel his frustration and humiliation from the day Potter turned him down, to feel his need to revenge, to have those green eyes focused and only focused on him. To him then, Longbottom was the perfect target. He was the weak, the stupid, the unlucky, the vulnerable. The one that had no value and could bring no profit. He couldn’t defend himself, and no consequence could come from hurting him.
It was his design and he knew it by heart. He had them randomly placed on the ceiling of the entire finca, to be a pleasant surprise at midnight.
Potter looked like he just had his limbs installed and wasn’t sure how he should react, but he followed Draco to the kitchen where they could talk.
He couldn't remember how long he cried, but the man was more than patient, and extremely quiet, not saying anything until Draco’s crying subsided.
Draco bit his lips. Sure, he had fooled around with a few women and men before. But he never had anal sex. It just never got that far. He heard about it, of course, just never had anything up there. It’s not like the contract asked about that, and he felt it would be petty to bring it up himself. Right now however, he didn’t want Potter to stop.
She opens her mouth in shock, then closes it again. Instead, she gestures her head from the Aurors to the Bodes, and they begin awkwardly picking them up. She steps over Hadrian to kneel by Harry.
Ginny was also the one who’d learned to brew Dreamless Sleep, full of fire and ambition to ease their nights, and when months later Harry hadn’t weened himself off as she had, she’d also stubbornly refused him another ounce.
It’s a Muggle American book—the exact kind of thing Harry hadn’t imagined Draco reading, full of cowboys and spitting and horses and southwestern country—but the further he got into its pages, the more it made sense. It’s dreamily poetic, but down to earth. Gritty and real and fanciful. Just reading it makes him feel like one with nature, and he’s starting to understand why Draco inhales books the same way Harry loves an old film.
Interesting. He speaks as if possessed, nervous about the words once they’re out of his mouth, brought forth by Potter’s optimism.
“Of course, not now. You’re right, we had fun last night, but as friends. She stayed over because we haven’t seen each other much lately, what with the Ministry work.”
He’s the lead investigator and yet in the brief minute of silence at his disposal, his voice had escaped him. He sees icy locks and permanent frown lines and grey eyes on the inside of his eyelids and yet recognises nothing in the man he’d known every snickering, glaring inch of for the better part of his youth. Draco Malfoy is a stranger.
Cassandra Flax is a lovely girl. She’s worked reception in the Auror department for five years running, a natural at charms who decorated for every holiday with delightfully interactive décor, sweets, and cheerful nicknames for every person in the office. She kept her strawberry blonde hair in a tight, bouncy ponytail and giggled at Harry’s lamest jokes. Just this morning, she’d peered at him between two huge bouquets and chirped, “Hey, Harry Peary, shall I expect some fauna, too?”
Draco nods. His neck feels too loose, like one wrong move and his entire body will go slack under Harry’s hands. He braces in response, but this only makes the hand on his right hip squeeze in disapproval.
His expression is unreadable. He’s already kicking his shoes off and setting his water down by Harry’s feet. His jaw is tight and he stands with poise and attitude that’s completely unnecessary for the situation.
Deprived of his lips, Draco moves to his jawline, the dip behind his earlobe, the slope of his neck. “Fortunate people.”
too late to stop.” Her face pinches up into remarkable anguish out of the blue. "'I released him until the trial and he followed me home!’” she cries. “’Auror Potter saved my life but not before Malfoy took his!’ Even better than taking care of Malfoy in 'self-defence', right, Hadrian?”
He hears the man’s dreadfully heavy stomping down the stairs before he sees him, returned as quickly as promised in jeans and a polo. “Ready?” he asks, eyes flitting around the room like he’d left a child unaccompanied.
Draco’s feeling a tad abandoned, so he channels the energy into making them both tea and turns the radio on while the kettle heats, because that’s something Harry does, and he hasn’t stopped endeavouring to try things as Harry does them. He sidesteps the top hits for easy listening and hunts out some digestives, steeps the tea, and is just plating it all on some saucers when he hears footsteps. He stops nodding his head to the music instantly.
Alright, well it's 22:30 over here, so still a daily update! On a most definitely unrelated note, hope everyone over here is enjoying the reopening of pubs.
“Mm,” Blaise nods in recollection. “Adrian Pucey, once, right? I saw you guys leave together, a Hogsmeade weekend.”
Draco nods and vanishes the box. With it, strangely, goes Harry’s stomach. He thinks for a moment he’ll be sick, that the alcohol has caught up with him, but the sinking feeling bores deeper; he’s just vanished his only excuse to attend the best study spot in England. He’ll return to his pre-friendship habit of late nights in his dark, empty office. At least when he finishes the genealogy book Draco’s lent him, he can stop by for another. Or perhaps he can join in on some light terrorism to get more evidence into Draco’s little laboratory.
Harry takes a deep breath and shakes off the uneasiness and Draco’s hand. He musters everything he can and forces a smile. “Brilliant,” he says. “It’s been years since someone’s tried to kill me.”
“Mm,” Draco hums into his coffee cup. Harry raises his eyebrows expectantly. “We think that was a diversion, right? What if that one was Murray, and the others were a curse expert with the proper wand to set me up? He panicked—had to handle Cassie independently at the last minute. Perhaps he has the extra wand on hand, shared with an accomplice.”
Harry peers jealously at the front table full of his friends as he makes his way. Hermione’s passing around some wallet-sized pictures, probably of Rose, to Luna and Ginny as Ron sets her wine down. They’ve been joined by Neville, Dean, and Seamus, who are all having some sort of boisterous conversation of their own. An eighth seat sits empty, waiting for Harry if he can stagger through his guest of honour duties.
He slams the box of evidence onto the desk, his good mood vanished instantly. It’s one thing for Harry to need time, and quite another to have him vocally shut down anything that could even imply Draco’s sexuality.
“Reading,” he offers, holding up the pages. Draco rounds the couch, wrapping his arms around Harry from behind. He looks at the paper from over his shoulder.
“Malfoy,” Harry confirms. The word feels foreign on his tongue when not spoken directly to Draco. “He lent me books—hey, now, what was that?”
It is his lack of movement, perhaps, that leads Harry to think he’s asleep, or out of it enough to continue. Slowly, painfully slow, he feels fingers card into his hair. They sit still, in hesitation maybe, flat against his head. The room is quiet of everything but the tinny dialogue from the television.
“Whatever house you end up in, I’m sure you’ll make great friends. And someday maybe you’ll even miss your brother!”
“Precisely. And I trust my ‘nose’ here,” he says, throwing up air quotes as he begins to pace. “There’s not even a fucking specialist, Ron, she’s been letting the evidence collect dust in her office, because of
“It feels like home,” he says quietly, just as he’d told Draco, if a little less assertively. “I spent my life growing up there, it’s like my… I don’t know, my heritage.”
“My turn,” Harry says then, impatiently placing a wrapped box in front of him. He unwraps it delicately along the glued seam, revealing a beautiful chestnut box, perfectly proportioned for the size of parchment he uses for his writing, with a small hinged compartment in the side for an ink well and multiple quills. His initials are engraved on the outside.
As he speaks, though, he feels a strange sensation; the glowing heat of his tied hands slowly dissipating. He adjusts his wrists minutely just to see.
be Harry Potter’s job to come to the rescue?” Potter opens his mouth to speak but Draco cuts him off. “Oh, enough with the pretending to be nice! I can’t decide which is worse; if you’re using me to be the bigshot who solves this case, or if you felt so much pity for me after the banquet that you offered me a job working for you. Either way, you apparently can’t think of anything to say from one human to another besides asking me how it’s going working for you.”
“I was having dinner with my mother last night,” he begins, “and—forgive me, but she asked about you, and about the case, and the victim names are public knowledge so I told her about it…”
“Mm!” Ron speaks before Harry can open his mouth. He’s already gotten the first bite in his mouth, so he holds up a finger for them to wait.
“I couldn’t tell him why, obviously, so I was trying to say that you needed to reconfirm the previous information, standard practice, all that, but instead…” He picks at a thread on his trousers. “Well, instead, you were removed from the case.”
They walk linked together back through the village and up to their cabin. As Harry packs that afternoon, he ignores the necklace he knows is piled in a heap at the bottom of his bag and folds his clothes in on top of it. Draco thanks him again for the trip. And again and again, and when they disappear through the fire into their separate London flats, he throws the duffel towards his wardrobe and lays flat on his bed staring up at the ceiling, grinning like an idiot in the privacy of his own home.
They were. Pansy almost smothered him in a hug when he walked through her fireplace, Blaise a moment behind. He squeezed Draco tighter than she did, always a big sap deep down, said something about suing the entire MLE. Pans mixed some Irish coffees and they sat and listened compassionately to his age-old story of resentment, tired from another night of being judged for existing as an ex-Death Eater, ex-Slytherin. He twisted the snake cufflinks on his suit worriedly as he spoke.
“It’s the principle!” he argues, disappearing into the bedroom, clearly expecting Draco to follow. He saunters in behind, sits on the bed as he watches him struggle to get the drawer back on its tracks. “I give you a drawer and you put nothing in it!”
“I don’t have any other engagements. It’s a revising day,” Malfoy adds quickly, eyes hardening again. “Otherwise I’d be much too busy to wait around for you and some dodgy Ministry business.”
An old Hobgoblins hit fills the small room, and Harry sings blithely, accompanied by the sizzle of cooking egg.
He decides over breakfast that it’s best to give Draco some space, in part because the last words he’d uttered were ‘That was a huge mistake’ but also because Harry could hardly yet wrap his mind around his own thoughts, let alone whatever Draco would have to say.
He’d decided to take a cup of Spoonfuls coffee upstairs to soothe his soul after lunch, still feeling sluggish and morose after his lay-in, and he’d just gotten back to his street when he saw a flash of red hair and thought no… it couldn’t be. But then he saw him, looking cruelly identical to how he had last night—wide eyes, paling face, speechless.
“Hi,” Jack laughs, deepening his dimples. He leans his forearm against the locker next to Harry, seemingly in no rush to start his workout. It’s almost six in the morning, so most were in and out quickly before work. To chat like this was unusual—catching up was more of a Friday evening after-sparring activity for them. “So why’d you try to take my head off, then?”
He’s missed Draco. His eyes are watching Harry with impressionable sincerity, and they had spent all weekend apart only to spend all morning apart, too. What’s the point of a getaway together if they can’t even work in the same space?
Draco’s in shock that he’s somehow back in this position after so long, though a small nihilistic part of him remains less so. Blaise and Pansy are watching with angry and frightened eyes, all three sharing a knowing look—any intervention will only make things worse for them all.
He’s never had trouble with making excuses, of course—he’d gotten away with loads at school—but it’s been a greater moral test under his assumed identity, among his genuine friends. Everyone at the gym thinks he’s something called a ‘venture capitalist’ and they’d been suitably nonplussed. No one’s ever asked him follow-up questions.
“Oh yes, it’s about time we turn the tables on idolatry around here,” she laughs, and it’s all in good fun. Harry chuckles too.
“I go every September,” Harry is saying, and when Draco opens his mouth to ask questions before he’s finished, he holds a commanding finger up in front of his face. “I didn’t see any reporters downstairs today, so if you don’t call ahead and tell the press you’re coming, you’re just fine. And it’ll be fairly empty—too early for holiday shopping, but all the kids and parents just went shopping for back to school. Plus, it keeps me honest; no relying on holiday-themed gifts as a catchall.
Harry’s face must say it all because she gives him a pitying expression. He reads it immediately as he walks to his door.
“I’m just saying,” Draco sighs, trying to continue speaking in complete sentences. “I could use some esteem building.”
from a takedown to a turn.” He demonstrates from their kneeling positions on the mat, driving his shoulder into Draco’s chest, his head under his armpit and his arms securely around his middle.
Draco can’t argue with that—if he were Harry he’d also feel as though he’d had enough change for a lifetime. “Well then I’m glad this was a good surprise,” he says, “It seems… long overdue. I’m sorry it took reuniting with someone you hated against all odds at twenty-seven to get here.”
He brushes past the man to a hawthorn wand he knows all too well. He picks it up, sure that it practically purrs at him like an old friend. They’d done an incredible thing together, once upon a time. He’s unsurprised when it reveals only a handful of light charms and a counter-curse.
“I’m going to Hogwarts next year!” A little girl says while her mother gushes to Harry about something vaguely related to a charity ball he’d attended years ago. “My brother is already there. He’s in Slytherin.”
Now that he was looking at Potter, truly seeing him for what felt like the first time, he found himself captivated. His green eyes were more alive than he’d ever noticed before, brightened by the flush of heat and alcohol in the man’s cheeks, and Draco took a sip of his mead, unable to look away as he swallowed. He could lose himself in those eyes, came the sinuous thought, and he swallowed again, feeling too warm.
Granger was already pulling a small notebook and a biro out of her bag. “That’s a good start. What about discretion for your launch? If you don’t plan for that I can guarantee that certain nations will think that the UK is launching a missile and you might start World War Three.”
,” he paused, letting the word linger in the air before continuing, “don’t act like I’m someone you need to run away from. Because I’m here. I’m
He blinked a few times, taking in the slight frame, the short brown hair in tight coils that were hardly an inch long, accentuating feminine features, the large brown eyes—
Draco was now seeing how Potter and his friends had managed to defeat the Dark Lord. How Potter had won the Triwizard Tournament. It was almost frightening how focused and decisive she was, on top of the intelligence that he’d always known her to possess. “Yes, I suppose that would work,” he said carefully, then he clarified, “
The other man nodded, appearing to be mulling something over, then shook himself. “All right, I’ll keep that in mind. Later, Malfoy.” There was a loud crack an instant later.
He wasn’t really aware of the sounds from the hallway until there was a short knock on the door and he looked up to see Hermione slipping into the room.
Potter huffed. “Oh, you shut up. I was serious about healing your burn, you prat.” Then he blinked and added, “And you absolutely
“Oh goodness,” Hermione said, immediately leaping to her feet and opening the door. “I completely lost track of time. Sorry about that!”
“I want to compare the heat on both of these,” he explained, taking several paces back until he could only feel the warmth coming from the broom he was holding, and not the other enchanted heat sources. “Actually, do you mind stepping away from the rock so that you can compare them as well?”
“Hmm.” She took another sip of her coffee, then her expression shifted entirely. “Well, I guess we might as well decide what we’re going to test out today while we wait for Harry.”
for pestering Potter, sat there uncertainly, partly thrilled at the attention and the frustration that he had drawn from the other man, but also unsettled by the amount of hurt that had been in his voice when he’d spoken of Draco not surviving space.
He opened his eyes, squinting blearily at the bright white light, harsher than natural sunlight, colder than the warm light of a fire. The ceiling was white too, unnaturally so.
Someone, likely Potter, must have gone to the cabin while he’d been unconscious since the clothing that was on the small table belonged to him, but weren’t what he’d been wearing when they were out in the sea. He was just about to pull on a shirt when he caught sight of his chest, and let out a gasp of shock.
Then on Friday, he celebrated being done with his Muggle Appreciation class by digging out one of his last bottles of birch sap beer from the previous winter and completing an owl order form for a furnishing store. He selected a bath with built-in charms for temperature control, then added a mirror too before sending it off with Vince. He justified the latter by the alarmingly low level of alcohol that was left in the bottle by that point.
“Well, she said she’s a researcher. After hearing that, and the fact that she has a magical and a muggle degree,
Potter still hadn’t let go of his arm from when they’d Apparated. “It’s the 27th. Well, the 28th now, I guess.”
He was still lost in thought when he handed one mug over to Potter. He then leaned against the wall, taking a scalding sip from his own mug. If the brooms weren’t tested and graded for the heat that he would encounter in the atmosphere, then he would need to both find a magical shield that would protect him at those high temperatures, and also find a way to test it. Somehow.
With the idle thought in his head that they hadn’t yet fucked on this particular landing he grabbed Potter by the shoulders and spun them around, pinning the man against the front door and grinding their hips together, groaning at the friction on his impossibly hard erection. Both of them were then fighting with belts, and flies, and more layers of fabric, letting out moans at each touch and the occasional laugh as they got in each other’s way, until their trousers were around their ankles and their erections were finally sliding against each other.
It had been the 11th of January when they’d gone to test the brooms. He was looking at the tree, wondering what it was still doing up when he felt Potter give his arm a brief squeeze before releasing it.
They made their way back to the Atrium to return to Potter’s house in silence. Once they arrived Draco finally met Potter’s gaze for the first time in hours, biting the inside of his cheek at the concern, the worry, the hurt that was gleaming in his eyes.
He reached down and grabbed Potter by the front of his shirt and hauled him to his feet, wrapping his other hand around his neck and bringing their lips together.
“I’m hearing a lot of ‘if’ and ‘probably’, Potter. Will you be able to do this or should I just put up with McLaggen? It’s that or you can keep all of the brooms, and I’ll give Firebolt my business.” He looked on as the man nearly shredded the papers, his fingers were clenched so hard.
Biting a trail up Potter’s neck as he fumbled with the lid of the thing, he soon had a slick hand and let the container drop onto his nearby coat. After a quick brush of his lubricated fingers against their lengths, eliciting a sharp breath from Potter, he reached up with his dry hand to tweak a sensitive nipple, swallowing the resulting cry with his mouth before spinning the man around until his chest was pressed up against the door.
Draco leaned forward to catch his attention. “No. You can’t—he doesn’t deserve that respect from anyone, let alone you. It’ll be a media spectacle! She’s using you to puff up the family name. How can you not see that?”
“You might also consider using a physical vessel to take care of some of the protection, rather than relying solely on broom enchantments. That could also help with heat dispersal, and might offer improved protection against radiation. And it would give you a space in which to install Gravity Charms so that you can retain muscle mass and bone density and preempt
“I know that you don’t like the idea, but can you agree to accept some help on this?” The concerned look was back.
Amazingly, Draco received a note by owl two days later to let him know that Potter wouldn’t be by until the following week due to other obligations. He hadn’t expected the man to be capable of any such courtesy. So Draco instead spent several evenings after class fiddling around with the Bubble-Head Charm, determining how to apply it to his chair. If he could enchant a broom with it so that it could produce breathable air around it, rather than maintaining the spell on himself, he would feel much safer.
“Oh, he seemed to think that you’d be quite angry that he spoke to me about you. Which I can understand, of course,” she explained matter-of-factly.
Draco could feel his brain melting and trickling out of his ears, joining the sweat that already covered him.
The hand was back up in the hair. Draco pursed his lips, trying to figure out what had thrown the man into such inner turmoil.
Draco frowned and walked over to open his bedroom door, only seeing his mother’s owl on the perch. “No, Vince isn’t back from his hunt yet.
The expression finally shifted and Vince offered a dull hoot before gliding over to the window sill.
“No, it doesn’t hurt,” Draco said patiently. “I just didn’t expect you to actually want to touch the scars. They’re horrible.”
“And equipment?” he asked. “I don’t have any of my own, and I don’t think Potter would want me placing an owl order under my name to be delivered to his home.”
Draco closed the distance, his brow quirked. “Feeding me, now? Worried I’ll starve out here in the woods?”
“There. Perfect,” Potter said, setting the small bottle down next to the salsa lizano between them, before shoving a heaping forkful of rice and beans in his mouth and releasing a contented sigh.
“I thought you’d be happy to be home. I wouldn’t have thought there was much around that house to keep you entertained.”
Draco watched his friend’s retreating form, his irritation dissipating into nothing more than a dim ember. “Fine,” he said, his voice devoid of inflection. “You might as well leave now then, before you waste more of both of our time.”
“Tell me you brought enough information that we can be productive today,” Draco said. It was a question, he supposed, though he didn’t bother to add any sort of inflection.
Draco’s foot had slipped but before the log could fall Potter was on his knees in the slush helping to keep it propped up. And he was glaring fiercely as he helped to set the wood into place.
Potter let out a bark of laughter. “Why would I want to upset her further? If things go well with Andromeda she’ll probably become a part of Teddy’s life. If I break my word on this can you honestly say that she won’t use Teddy against me in the future?”
He had Potter’s entire body pinned at that point and reached out, his fingers blindly finding Potter’s and threading through them against the door as his eyes were screwed shut, his mouth pressed against the junction of Potter’s shoulder and neck.
“No, Potter,” Draco interrupted with a sigh. “She’ll get bored sooner or later and fly off. I can put an Imperturbable Charm on the door if her screeching bothers you.”
Draco was just contemplating taking a nap against the wall when the door creaked open and Hermione entered.
“Right,” Potter finally said. “Ten o’clock, Sunday. I’ll meet you guys there, in that case. And we can sort out Mewstone next week, maybe?”
“I grew up eating lobster, as I said.” There was a man out on the water in a little sailboat, swinging his hands in the air and trying to shoo away the swooping seabirds as they continued to pester him. “Lobster tail, specifically. I always thought they were large prawns.”
He breathed in the soothing scent. The tin was almost empty. Maybe he’d get a different blend when it ran out.
Considering how reasonable the man had been on his last visit, he felt generous enough to offer up a response. “Some trees fell this weekend. I’m building an addition.”
Potter actually flinched and Draco felt some regret over mentioning death so casually. But the man’s tone was even when he replied, “I trust you to not deliberately do anything stupid. And Kreacher will keep an eye on things in case you manage it accidentally.”
She appeared to consider, then replied, “Hmm, no. I’ve already made plans with Anthea tonight.” Potter then gave her a pleading sort of look, and she responded with a laugh. “Oh, fine. I’ll go see him off.”
Finally Potter finished his tea and they set off, taking a moment to retrieve the brooms he’d left propped up against the outside wall. The snow was still falling gently in large clumps but the temperature was rather mild, and the blanket of snow on the ground had a muffling effect on the sounds of the forest.
And sometime later, when they were both sated, Draco sprawled on his back with Potter tucked against his side, snoring gently, he was awake for what felt like hours, terrified by the thought of being trapped here with this man, but just as afraid of leaving Earth and not coming back to him.
Draco’s free hand gripped Potter’s hip, holding him close. He could feel the heat emanating from the front of the man’s trousers, could feel the hard length there pressing against his own erection, groaning as each minute movement made him impossibly hard.
“It’s no worry, really. As I said, it’s far too much food for me—they still feed me so much, even though it’s not like I’m starved anymore. But—yeah, it’s no worry.”
“And you can’t convince me that you’re not a cuddler too,” Potter then said cheekily, because of course he couldn’t help himself, and Draco pinched his side, rolling his eyes at the snickering that ensued.
“Well regardless of how much you believe in your convictions right now, you can’t make any claims about anyone else’s,” Draco said, feeling trapped by the man’s proximity, but unable to step away.
Draco, meanwhile, was quietly grateful that he had been all but ordered to do nothing for a month. He knew that if he’d been alone at home he’d have spent much of his time keeping busy and overexerting himself; his shoulders frequently ached, and occasionally tingled or went numb.
The door opened less than a minute later and his mother stood there, wearing robes of pale lilac, her hair done up in braids coiled around her head, tears shimmering in her eyes. “Draco?” she asked, a slight trembling audible in her voice.
Shortly the brewing was completed and he opened the trunk, and spent the next several hours painstakingly coating every inch with the thin liquid, brushing on several coats to ensure that it was absorbed evenly into the wood. When the last of the infusion had been used he stood and stretched, then looked around to see that Potter had left the room at some point.
“There. That should be a decent start for ventilation. I’ve asked Harry to look over the wards already so this is as safe as any brewing cellar. Now, I don’t think it’s wise to begin anything experimental, but if being productive will prevent you from resorting to more dangerous activities then you may as well start working on the brewing from our list.”
“Oh god, oh yes, please. . . .” Potter was rambling, his fingers scrabbling at the wood while Draco ran an oiled finger along his crease, pausing slighting over his entrance before continuing lower, softly rolling his bollocks in his palm, then sliding his finger back again, holding it against the quivering muscle, pressing ever so slightly, and finally sliding two digits into Potter’s warmth.
“How many more island stops do you think we’ll have before we head back?” he heard a few minutes later.
Draco considered, then replied, “I’m not noticing it as often. Just after sitting for too long, generally. Or exerting myself as well, I suppose.”
“It looks good,” Potter said in greeting, tilting his head as if to gesture toward the back of the cabin. “Is it done?”
Once his body was a bit more under control he put the rest of the food away, guessing that it would likely keep him fed for the full week that the charms would last. Then he cleaned up, Vanished the table, and sank onto his chair.
They sat in silence for a few minutes longer, each of them intermittently drinking their tea, when Potter abruptly commented on his change of clothes.
He slowly pushed himself up, supporting himself on his elbows, wincing at the dull ache in his shoulders, and looked around. Well. He was clearly in St Mungo’s, though he had no idea why.
.” Potter had a wildness about him, his hair an explosion of black around his red face, his eyes bright with a mixture of fury, frustration, and strangely, fear.
“Not yet. I still need to add in a door and owl order some things. Finish the plumbing.” He flapped a hand idly, then pushed past Potter, coming to a stop once he caught sight of the kettle on the stove and the two waiting mugs. He turned and watched as the other man stood, giving him a narrow look.
He shook his head. “No. I’ll need to be able to assess how much the alteration affects the balance and movement, and there are too many other variables affecting that one.”
He nodded mutely and held a hand out for the bottle, then poured himself one measure, then a second after a moment’s pause. He then scooted back on the bow so that he could lean back against the mast, feeling the burning heat on his leg where Potter’s hand had touched it.
There were a few footsteps and then Potter was next to him, facing the window as well. “It sounds like the two of you got on fine then?”
