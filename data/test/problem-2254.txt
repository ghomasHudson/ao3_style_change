Potter looked incredibly happy to see Draco enjoying his food, and he was smiling too much to eat his own. Trying to distract him, Draco asked what he got, but he couldn’t have repeated the name. It was a rice dish with lamb and smelled like heaven on earth. Potter offered him a taste, but Draco thought that if he took anything more from him, even the tiniest thing, he would spill all over, and refused. They ate in content silence for some time.
Malfoy gave a startled little laugh. “I’m not going to be able to play in the snow with you. Not with Snape around, at least.”
Harry tried to mask his gasp as a cough, but he was sure the other boy picked up on it. He looked at him intently. “What did it say?”
They were getting to the door, Draco could almost see it.
… - Hermione was hit by that silenced spell and she fell to the ground -
“Yes, Dobby,” Harry said softly, sitting down next to Draco, who still looked rather shocked. “We are friends now.”
This was a very vexing conversation. Draco was torn between anger with Potter’s stupidity, amusement at his innocence, general fear of opening this can of flobberworms, and a desperate sort of sadness that threatened to swallow him whole. “All right.”
Had he not been careful, he would have missed the little sigh of aggravation. “Of course I will, Draco. Of course I do. I love you more than anything else in the world.”
Another slap nearly sent him to the wall; he grabbed himself just in time. “You have crossed the line,” his father said in a voice so soft it was nearly a whisper. “You have really, really crossed the line this time.”
Right: sad, and angry, and afraid – it pretty much summed up his state of being, asleep or awake. Everything was so incredibly, stupidly, unbelievably hard, and he was so sad all the time, and he didn’t know why, and angry all the time, and he didn’t know with whom, and scared all the time, but he didn’t know of what. Of everything, really. Everything. Always. But…
Harry started. “Do what?”
I am attacked, you are to do absolutely nothing. Get back to Dobby as quickly as you can and leave. Am I clear enough? If not, we're leaving this very instant.”
and the buzzing and the panic and the flames both in and outside of his head, underneath all of that, Draco thought he might have maybe, possibly, somehow already known. After all there was only ever one other person who treated him the way He does. Did he really know? How could he not? But then again how could he know this and not – how could he
“He faked the whole thing,” he continued his friend’s sentence, rubbing his eyes which still stung a little from the smoke. “He pretended to betray us so that he could… take our place. So he could get us out of there.” The silence grew even deeper in the little bubble the four of them were in.
“He won’t be for much longer if you cast another spell,” Lucius drawled, and Harry was beat. He raised both hands and took a look at the mess around him. At least five Death Eaters were on the ground between the upturned sofas and rubble. He had no idea if they died. He didn’t really care.
,” Draco frowned. “I – well, I always knew when He was angry, at least.” He just had no idea what this row was about. No idea.
He chuckled, the bastard. “I really hope not, Sir.”
“Mr. Potter, Mrs. Malfoy, we must not rush into this. As long as we don’t know what particular curse set the bond, it’s reckless to simply feed him pain-potion without – “
“I honestly don’t care. Why don’t you get what you want? I know for a fact you both could use a proper meal.”
He couldn’t hear anything else anymore.
“No, that’s unnecessary,” he promised Hermione when she came over at four thirty, because Harry was nothing if not overzealous when it came to Draco’s safety. “I can skip the walk today. I’ll go a longer one tomorrow.”
Then he came outside and breathing was no longer an option.
“But how – why is this hurting you?”
“Draco.”
Draco shrugged. He was beginning to feel very tired. “Not all Muggle places are like that, then?” He didn’t feel the need to mention the living room is an almost-exact replica of His living room from downstairs. If Harry didn’t notice it, then that’s on him.
“Not what? Draco, please, what is it?” Potter’s eyes were huge with worry and his hands hovered right above Draco’s skin. Desperation leapt out of every inch of his face.
“I didn’t want to accidentally touch you or something,” he explained with an apologetic shrug. “I move a lot in my sleep, and you’ve had such a night already, I didn’t want to… it’s all right, though. I’m not as tired as I was before. I’m happy just lying here.”
“Enough,” Draco breathed into his mic, switching between cameras on his watch. “The suspension on the main building’s alarm is almost up. Granger, go help your boyfriend. Blaise, if you don’t get the system down this instant, you have no right to call yourself a hacker. Pansy, all’s well on your end?”
them? You are not naïve, Potter, you’re straight up delusional. The Aurors were the more creative ones, if I’m being honest.” He was surprised to hear himself speak, since he
was an incredible wizard, and Potter’s little wards would not be able to stand in His way. “Just you, I suppose. No one else should know I am here. No one else should be granted entry.” That would be enough for now, at least. When He’d be back, He could take care of the security issues. And He will have to protect Draco from His colleagues, at least.
He wasn’t sure that he did, but Draco nodded anyway. It was far too tempting to walk away now. Words that came right out of Pansy’s mouth… “Yes, please.”
at the same time? Moreover, how could this fucking be? How could this be? How could this – how could – how –
Draco looked down at the golden cuff and shook his head. It wasn’t even activated, he realized now. The mere presence of it was enough to stop him from trying – He didn’t even need to cast the spell; He knew Draco would be cowed out of any attempt just by seeing it. Draco was such a pathetic fuck, that he let a
The old man gave him a weary smile. “Usually I do not disclose my personal conversations with students to others, Harry.” There was a little bit of a twinkle in his admonishing look. “But since young Mr. Malfoy said I could reveal it all to you, I think that should be okay.”
He sounded upset, and Harry didn’t know quite how to touch this subject. “Do you think that’s what you’re doing? Hurting the Malfoy family name?”
Draco looked at the way he crossed his heart and resisted the urge to roll his eyes. It’s not that he didn’t trust Potter, just that… all right, fine, he didn’t trust him enough for it. Was it really all that mad, though? Potter broke his promises at least once a week. Draco trusted him with his life, but he could not trust him with this information.
Malfoy gave a strangled laugh, and Harry patted his shoulder lightly. “Thanks, Potter. This is the second time you’ve had to see me in this state. I’m sorry about that.”
The door opened so suddenly, he had to suppress a startled cry. Hermione looked at him through Pansy’s face with terrified sorrow. Bellatrix just looked outraged. Harry could still feel the numb emotions stirring within him, like smoke rising from a volcanic lake. Soon, he will have to face them. Soon he will have no choice. But right now there were other things to worry about – other pressing, far more important things than his need for revenge. “You’ve had your two minutes, Cissy. Go back to your room now.” She looked around them with an evil little grin on her face. “Perhaps Miss Parkinson here can help you get there, since she seems to be so intent to assist Draco. in the meantime, my dear nephew, let me take you to your father.”
He knew what Lucius wanted him to say, still it was hard to form the words on his lips. He shook his head instead. “Let her Apparate back to Hogsmeade. You can do whatever you want then. Just let her go.”
No, not a river – perhaps a stream; the more he looked at it, the smaller it got, until it was only a faint blue line snaking off in the distance. Draco tried, but couldn’t see its end. It had no end. He looked around – there was something eerie and unsettling about the whole place, especially with the thick fog covering the banks either side. It made him feel strangely exposed.
Two blond eyebrows shot up. “Oh, is that right? Do you have any plans for this long, long time?”
“Oh,” was somehow becoming Draco’s catchphrase. He thought about it for a second, empowered by the curious look in those damnable green eyes, and the frightening decrease in inhibitions provided by the wine. “Would you, er – like to – see it?”
So fucking scared, it was unreal. Because underneath all the
“Incarcerous,” the man all but leered, and thin ropes struggled around Harry’s body, binding him tight.
“I mean nothing’s changed. I still can’t… you need to leave.”
He knew it, he knew it will happen. Didn’t he beg Him not to leave? Didn’t he
"Oh, wow. I really don’t want to know what you want to do to me or with how many hands, all right? Keep those for your daydreams.” Malfoy was still smiling, though he became marginally more tense. Absently he placed a hand on the place where Harry knew his rib had been broken.
As soon as he left, Harry clenched his teeth and set off to clean. The sooner he’s done, he reckoned, the sooner he could leave. And the sooner he could go back to ignoring Malfoy. But it was a little hard to ignore him now, when he was so close to Harry, especially as he wasn’t doing anything.
Wiping his face Draco pulled himself back out of his head, determined to persevere somehow. It was right here, the information he could never get, wasn't brave enough to get, and he needed to know. The articles weren’t sympathetic, to say the least, though not entirely hostile – It would seem that losing her son before he was twenty one made people feel a little sorry for Narcissa, and it kept them from tearing her apart completely. Thank the gods for small mercies, he thought gloomily, flicking through the pages and religiously ignoring the pictures. That was really the best thing either of them could get out of this situation. With him gone, she could turn a new leaf. She could start again…
The first few dinners at the cottage were a solemn affair. The days were long and hard, and by evening time no one was really in the mood to talk. They were all just so tired. It was a
“That’s a load of bullshit,” Harry had no intention of mincing his words. “He’s the one who lost it, and now it’s up to you to restore it?”
“It’ll be over before you know it,” Harry’s response was nonsensical. “I will end this, do you hear me? It will be over so soon.”
Draco scoffed. “I hardly did anything. Kreacher did most if not all of the work. Whereas I don’t normally mind taking credit, I’d hate for you to think I’m some sort of master chef. The reason I suggested lasagna is the instructions to make it are written on the box.”
“You too,” Potter replied, or at least that’s what Draco imagined he said. It was impossible to hear over the music.
You were the one who – you failed me. You left, and you lied, and you hurt me – you hurt me so, so bad.” He raised his eyes to the shadow, and couldn’t tell which one of them was shaking.
Harry trembled with unease. “Sounds a little like the Death Eater that pretended to be Moody, using the Imperio on all of us fourth year.”
Draco nodded, but his mind was still on the predicament. In a fight between Potter and Him… no, it was better for everyone involved not to think about it. Only Draco would be punished for all this, he was sure. Potter won’t bear the blame. There will be no
Draco couldn’t hear anything after that. All he could think of was how He betrayed him, how completely and totally He did. It was a very devastating sort of betrayal, too. For even if he could put aside the whole Dark Lord thing, even if Draco was happy to be His – well, His pet, probably, if he’s being honest – teaming up with
Just to rub salt in the wound, it was a brilliant day outside. The weather (fucking weather, Draco hated the weather) took a turn for the better and the end of February was actually pleasant. That Sunday was sunny and gleaming and marvelous and offensive. Draco wanted to roll it into a ball and carefully tuck it in his pocket for future use. Days like these weren’t rare, they simply did not exist. Until now. And soon, probably too soon, it will all be taken away from him again. So he grimaced and grit his teeth and bloody
“No one!” Harry swore, raising his hands in defence. “Malfoy, they wouldn’t tell anyone, I promise you. Look, it’s really not such a big deal, it’s not like you’ve told me so much – “
The next morning they spotted Snape back in his dungeons, and Malfoy asked Harry to wait for him in Gryffindor while he goes to see him. “He still can’t know a thing,” he begged when Harry seemed reluctant. “He’s not going to do anything, anyway. I’m just going to ask for my wand, and he’d give it to me. It won’t take ten minutes.”
Then, near the end of the week, came his second test. He was walking with Ron and Hermione to Herbology class when all of a sudden he heard a faint groan and then a clash. Turning around he saw the familiar blond head on the floor, bag dropped next to his limp body. No one else was in the corridor. Not really giving it much thought, Harry dashed over to him.
Harry had to think about that. “I suppose,” he said, but he still felt a little uncomfortable. “I didn’t have to go through all the craziness you did, though. I was put under the Cruciatus curse, but very briefly. And when I tried to use it I – well, failed.”
eklectricity. Knew all about plugs and pockets, which could zap you if you stuck your fingers in them. How the light switch was attached by cords – not invisible, simply hidden behind the wall! – to the lightbulb itself, and all those little bits of electritisy flowed in it constantly. His chest swelled with pride as he said, “I know that it has to be turned
“Sure,” he breathed immediately. Anything to keep her away from him. And maybe he could take this chance to walk about, see if he can find Draco and Ron anywhere. He tried to keep his face blank as she gave him one last look and left, closing the door deliberately behind her. Harry waited for a few seconds, his breath hard and cold in his throat. The look on Narcissa’s face – he couldn’t get it out of his mind. Her eyes, almost exactly like Draco’s, filled with so much pain. What did they do to her? What did they do to drain her so of energy, of life? He remembered her in the forest; distraught, yes, but still elegant, filled to the brim with dignity. The woman he saw today was… not even a shell of her old self. She was still strong – he could see it in her. When she thought of Draco, she had strength in her yet. But other than that… he shivered when he pictured her face once more. It was terrible. Awful. Again he felt that bubbling wrath inside him. Why did Lucius do this to his family? He caused them so much pain, so much trouble, and for what? A chance of some power with his stupid Voldemort? This was insane. Harry wondered again where Draco is now and what is going on with him. Obviously he didn’t find his mother, so what is he doing? Has he found anyone else? Fear for him was bitter and burning at the same time.
“Narcissa kept telling me you were alive,” Andromeda shook her head, wiping her face absently. “She kept saying… and I didn’t believe her. I thought she was going mad with grief, same as I had.  And then… well.”
It seemed like he would have a slim chance, if any at all. The second the professor shut the door and opened his mouth, Harry found the memories flooding him, taking him miles away from the classroom and into the dark, hated house where his godfather was imprisoned. He remembered Snape goading him, taunting him… he remembered Sirius’s face the last time he saw him, how badly he wanted to tell him not to listen to his old enemy, not to take his words to heart. He didn’t then, and now regret overfilled him, and was verging on spilling out of his eyes. He gasped and buried his head in his arms before anyone could see.
What an idiotic thing to say. “Of course not.” He slept on a rug, for goodness sake. He shook his head exasperatedly at Potter. “Can we go now?”
“You let your house-elf sleep in your
Draco had to look at her, incredulity practically dripping from his expression. “You what now?”
“Well, well, well,” his voice was like a knife, sharp and cold, and for a second Draco forgot to be afraid of Grove, because he didn’t think Harry could do that. He knew he’d be harsh, yes – knew he was a professional interrogator, too. But… this much? It got a reaction out of Grove as well; he squirmed a little in his seat, clearly uncomfortable. Draco imagined the wolfish smile he could hear in Harry’s voice now. “Little tough guy Macnair is finally ready to talk.”
Merlin and Morgana, this could not have come at a worse time – but he’d already made eye contact, and there was nothing for Draco to do now but lay the paper on the desk and stare right at his best friend’s face. His hardly-recognizable best friend's face. Not that she really looked all that different – same nose, same cheekbones, same pout. But there was something… her eyes were perhaps harsher; Pansy mastered bitch-face all the way back in school, but this was something else. She looked hardened, like life tried to teach her a lesson, then deserted the attempt for a well-aimed kick in the ovaries. To the untrained eye she might look fine, but Draco knew her well enough to say she looked sad, and it tore his heart to pieces. Why was his Pansy sad? Was she not just promoted to some big-shot Ministry position? Did she not have a good life?
She smiled at him so brightly he was stunned for a second. “Of course, dear. A very fine choice. Harry, would you mind terribly to fetch the food while I go wake up Lucius? I’m sure he’d like to join us tonight.”
Instead of screaming, which would probably hurt even with the healing potion, Draco concentrated on breathing very hard through his teeth. “There’s nothing you can do. I’m His, always His, His alone.” As he should have been all this time, as he failed to be all this time. Being His was his due, it was his purpose, it was everything he deserved –
While he waited for the spell to hit, he took a moment to observe the Slytherin. His eyes were very light and slightly bleary, and there was a haunted air in them that was outright frightening. Harry hadn’t seen him look like that in a long, long time, and couldn’t help but freak out over what caused it. Could it be Snape, threatening him again? Crabbe and Goyle up to no good? A letter from his father or Lestrange? Or… something even worse still? Harry closed his eyes and tried to focus. It won't do, worrying about Malfoy when the latter was trying to invade his mind. There was nothing he wanted more than for Malfoy to feel safe with him, to trust him, but Harry knew better than trying to force that. Whatever was eating Malfoy – and it could not have been clearer something was – he will tell Harry in his own time.
to let my feelings get in the way of my assignment.”
Oh, God. He wasn’t ready for that, no way in hell was he ready for that. And yet the thought alone was enough to make his cock shoot upwards; he couldn’t tear his eyes away as Draco pushed further in, then inserted another one, pulling his fingers apart. He felt weak. This was all happening so fast. He had no idea what or even how to think.
pained. “I’ll be right here.”
Potter looked miserable. “Look, it’s not a big deal, all right?”
“You wish,” he whispered into his lips, and then he kissed him.
“Wow, didn’t realize you were quite so enthusiastic. Dial it down a bit, won’t you? You’ll have the neighbors complaining.”
as an excuse never to have to go out into the world! Hiding in that hideous house you hate because you can’t deal with the repercussions of what you did! You act like you can save everyone,
Potter made a gagging sound. “You – drank it?”
“I won’t touch you.”
“I can’t even… on my own…” the sobs were hard to contain now, and he knew he’s worrying Potter, but there was nothing to do about it. “I’m so sorry…”
anything.”
the Legilimency, He already knew. Was the one who planned everything. He only did it because He wanted me to… wanted to see.” There was a sharp, bitter taste in his mouth, but he had to keep going, had to finish now. “And it wasn’t just that. There were other ways He could make me – I was far too easy for Him; so desperate for the smallest show of affection, so eager to avoid punishment, so very much in need of direction. He taught me what He wanted, step by step, took me by the hand. When I did something good, I got rewarded. When I broke the rules, I got punished. And I learned. Not all of it was so easy – it took a long time before I could let Him, erm, without flipping out at least. But He was patient. And creative. And it didn’t take too long before I did my very best to be who He wanted. To give Him what He asked for. It – erm.” Harry’s hands on him were officially too much; Draco squirmed a little until he got the gist and let go.
And Draco felt the nausea rising in him, he was going to throw up again, he was going to be sick all over the place – “Harry, he – he – there’s – “ but he couldn’t form a sentence, he couldn’t make it into words, this indescribable dread buzzing within him.
“So gallant,” he sneered, and gave him a very cold bow. “Always ready for the rescue. I’m forever in your debt, you complete arsehole.”
There was no way he could explain it, but this stupid, stupid gesture from an already exhausted Harry was the last straw. It sharpened oh so quickly the details of the situation they were in, the dangerous,
Malfoy only looked a little surprised. “Why me?”
“It was – she wanted to tell me that – ah, fuck, Potter, it means we need to go to Dumbledore.”
“Will you really do that to me? Force me to make that choice again, you or my mother?” Draco bent his head, taking a few deep breaths. He looked unbalanced, like he might fall any second. Harry found he had absolutely nothing to answer him with, but thankfully he continued. “We don’t even know what Dobby will find. We don’t know if there’s anything we could actually do.”
“Look, Malfoy, it doesn’t matter, all right? Your dad told you everything that happened, you don’t need me to repeat it. He and his precious Dark Lord had me cornered, and I only just managed to escape. So do you think you can just shut up about it already?” Harry was really on edge. He was very abruptly reminded of the fact that he was actually sitting in front of someone who was raised by a Death Eater, someone who in himself had received a task from Voldemort. “Maybe we really should give this thing a rest for now.”
And the thing was… well, there were many things, too many to count. He was still not always certain where he was, what was going on around him, what was real. But the thing he was starting to get now was that he could learn all of that. Even if it would take time. Even if it takes a lot more tries before his chicken is as good as Mother’s. Even if some days he hurts Harry more often than he makes him happy. Even if saying no isn’t always an option, yet. He could change, he could grow, he could be better. He could learn, and there were just about a million different things in the world
“I know,” he said, but he sounded only more upset. “I hate that too, how fucking noble you are about all this, how bloody kind. Because I know that if it was the other way around…” he shook his head, furious. “You’re wasting your time, Potter. It’s not going to work. You have no idea what you’re up against.”
Ron laughed and smacked him on the shoulder, hard. “You're a total git, Harry, but thanks. I’ll –think about it. See what I can do.”
“I’m going to – I’m going upstairs to change, all right? Then we can make dinner. I was thinking maybe stew.”
, he told himself again, then shivered with repulsion. Malfoy.
“I thought we weren’t going to talk about me,” Draco said a little coldly, and Potter nodded.
He couldn't stop seeing it; every time he closed his eyes it was there, the memories, the horrors. He became afraid of his own eyelids. The dark room wasn’t dark enough, but he couldn’t hope to get up and turn off the one light. He kept it on for days now because if it was off there was really no telling how he’d end up. Already he was at such a state. Already he was barking and breaking and – and –
“What’s going on here?” Pansy’s voice was surprising enough to penetrate his frightened haze, and he straightened up a little, blinking too fast. “Draco? What’s going on?”

to kiss him, and he had to do it
“That’s exactly it. What about you? What are you going to do now?”
“Thank you for telling us all this, darling,” Mother said gently next to his ear as her kiss ghosted over his cheek. “You were so brave. I’m so proud of you.”
“Good night, Harry, you huge prat. I love you too.”
But it was too, too, too much. Fear chewed his heart and spat out a mangled lump, and Draco was drained. Every shadow was a threat. Every second was torture. It took until half four before he decided he can genuinely not take it any longer, and slithered his way back to Potter’s bedroom. He hoped the weary patient will not notice his entry, but of course he didn’t get his wish, and Potter stirred as the door opened. “Draco? Are you alright? What’s wrong?”
will not be satisfied until you have given every last piece of information, until you have paid in every possible way. And you also know that in the end, it will not matter- you will not be able to resist Him.” Draco shuddered, because he knew it was true; this could go on with no end. He will be broken apart and reassembled, every day, every night, for the rest of his life… the thought made it impossible to speak. “You are the only one who can stop it, Draco. Bring Potter here and I promise you will not suffer as much. Bring Potter here and He will let you die immediately. This is the only way, the only thing you can do. bring Potter, or imagine the next ten years of absolute living hell. Did you think you suffered before? Did you think it was bad? You have no idea.” and with these words he left the room and locked the door behind him.
scared?”
? His inner voice sounded disturbingly like Hermione. But she was right – meaning, he was right – Harry can’t just go there. He needs a plan, he needs something more concrete than ‘and then we just storm the place and win’. This was what failed them the last time, no? but Harry just couldn’t settle down long enough to formulate any plan through. He was lost without Ron and Hermione, and Dumbledore said they can’t visit him at the moment. He needed them, damn it, he needed them so badly, and he had no idea what to do without them. He had no idea what to do, in general. His desperation brought yet another wave of sluggishness and he plopped back down on the sofa. His head was burning and he closed his eyes once more.
“I’m not – you have to admit it’s weird, Draco. Why would your ex live in a place owned by a dead Death Eater?”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter, the unlikely potions duo. How surprising to see you two together on a Saturday morning.”
Did you know there’s a storm raging the atmosphere of planet Jupiter for hundreds of years, called the ‘Great Red Spot’? Yay for more planetary fun!
The face he could only see in his dreams for so long appeared before his eyes. “My Draco. How I missed you.”
“It’s gorgeous. You’re gorgeous. I… do another twist for me?” Potter’s voice was so soft and shy, Draco obeyed immediately. “Brilliant. I love it. Excellent choice.”
Panic was confusing in his high state of exhaustion. “So what are you on about? On what accounts will you charge Him?”
“I can imagine your reports would make Granger cry if she saw them.” Draco fidgeted in his seat a little thinking about her. Before his trial, she made several attempts to help him, coming to the Manor armed to the teeth with books of wizarding law. He was certain it was Potter who put her up to it. He refused to get any help from her, and insisted instead she focused all her time on helping his mother; he was a lost cause anyway, she still had hope. In the end, it did work.
Harry stopped moving at once, panting somewhat hysterically.
“I – was hoping that – “ the words died on his lips and Potter scrambled to a sitting position, looking worried and still half-asleep.
Tuesday brought with it rain and thunder, and Draco was soaking wet by the time he made it back to the flat. He was still under quite a bit of pain and hardly able to walk, and so he just waddled as fast as his legs would carry him on his way back and tried to avoid being splashed on by cars. It was a miserable, bleak London evening, and Draco was a miserable, bleak man when he stood in the living room, dripping on the carpet. For a moment he considered staying there like that, the ultimate punishment, shivering and most definitely catching pneumonia. But then he reconsidered, fueled by how furious He would be to come back and find Draco in that state, and took a very warm shower that lasted over thirty minutes. By the time he was out, draped in only a towel, there was enough steam to run a sauna.
“All right, here, I’m taking it. Honestly, though. Do you – and I really don’t mean to be nosy, but – do you have enough?” Potter grimaced uncomfortably. He didn’t look any more pleased than Draco felt.
Malfoy laughed again, and it was a much freer laugh, one that resonated inside Harry and felt warm. “Yes, that’s about right. Spot on with the snake print, too. Everything in Malfoy Manor is Slytherin colored and reptilian.”
Harry’s stomach turned, and for a second he almost lost his balance. He was so stunned, he nearly missed the next sentence from the Potions master. What the hell? Was all he could think. What the hell?
But Potter –
The water was thick and heavy and a hysterical thought went through him that it wasn’t water at all – it was blood – he had to get away from there – he couldn’t get away – it was a snake, holding him down, a snake of red eyes - and he was doomed, he was doomed, he was doomed…
Potter chuckled. “No, I promise. If I die you have every right to kill me.” He gasped when Draco pecked his lips softly before leaning back and getting up.
“I’m not good for them. I’ve – look, I can’t really explain it, so you would just have to take my word for it. I'm doing them all a favor by staying away, all right? It’s just for the best.” It was terribly silent for a moment.
Something hurt - his chest felt tight and full of thorns. There was a high-pitched cry of alarm in his mind and his head was going to burst with it. Danger. “What do you mean, Sir?”
Draco pressed the letter to his chest, where it got caught in the tracks of his tears. Fuck.
Harry shot him a grateful look for coming up with a fairly reasonable story. “You do have your wand back, don’t you, Draco? Why would you let Gregory tell you what to do now?” Snape seemed unimpressed.
“Why not? You know you can tell me anything, right? Anything.” Worry was clawing at his chest like a hungry feral cat.
Draco leaned back as Lovegood got them ready for takeoff. They did it. They fucking did it. They robbed the fucking Louvre. And good riddance to old Dumbledore, who told him he’d never make it on his own. Draco had in his possession the most famous ancient-Greek statue in the world, so clearing Father’s debt would be a simple feat. And now, with this job done, Draco would finally have time to focus on… other things. Muscular, broad, bright-smiled things, perhaps.
He nodded and proceeded to wash and peel the salamanders, working so quietly and efficiently, even Hermione looked impressed. Ron and Harry accepted their tasks from her without refrain, and for some time the four of them just worked away in surprising calm.
and Draco feared them too. The presence of his master there gave him no consolation; In his previous life, his master allowed them to hurt him. He hurt Draco himself. There was a stinging, hot lump in his throat that he desperately wanted to swallow.
There was no fucking time for this. Draco had to go
But it was only Grove that could make him open his mouth. “Come on, boy. Speak.”
It had been explained to him, after all, many times. Enough times to stick.
“How about, the next time you want to say his name and you can’t – how about you just say Dean’s instead?”
Draco considered that for a moment. “What about your wife, though?”
“Yes. I’m glad you understand.” Malfoy seemed very hesitant.
Potter mulled the matter over for a few seconds. “Okay,” he said in the end in a dark tone. “I will drop it. I won’t do anything about those arseholes, and they will keep on raping people and destroying more lives. Is that what you want?”
At first he leaned into Potter in an awkward angle, pushing his lower back out as he was used to, but it was unnecessary. Potter’s hand remained very surely on the center of his back and Draco had every confidence he was aware of the danger. His confidence may have been misguided, but also inevitable. Potter wouldn’t hurt him, he knew that for sure. Not on purpose, and not if he could avoid it.
“Yeah – do you know him? He’s my godson. I go to visit him every Sunday morning. You can’t even believe how big he’s gotten, it’s unnatural. Dromeda says he’s going to be taller than me any day now. Wouldn’t bet against it, either – Lupin was pretty tall himself.”
Then he remembered.

Draco gave the garden another look. More rays poked through the clouds, and the whole place was glimmering. It looked so beautiful, his chest actually ached. It was hard work, being alive; often sad, mostly painful, frequently intense. Draco spent a lot of time being scared, being hurt. Hurting himself. But all of it - whether he was kind or rough, whether he was good or just tolerable, the very fact he was alive, it was all his choice. A choice he had to keep making all the time, and maintaining, and concentrating on. But the control was never once taken from him anymore, and the decision wasn't given to him, either. It was just his. It was his.
Oof. A painful start, to be sure. Apprehension did laps around his chest, but Draco worked to keep his face neutral. “What is it?”
And it didn’t fucking help, the little pep-talk he was trying to give himself. True, it was going to hurt less than Crucio, but what did that bloody matter? It was still going to be awful. Just the thought of Greyback’s callous hands on him – forcing him down – spreading his legs –
was probably just late in His meetings with the other men. Meetings that Draco had zero interest in, naturally. He'd been burned enough by sticking his nose where it didn’t belong, and that was a mistake he was not likely to ever make again. So yes. It must be a meeting keeping Him away, because He wouldn’t leave him.
“Why for? So you could continue lying to the both of us? You’d need to face it at some point. I’m not saying it has to be now, but – “
“You know what doesn’t make sense, Potter? Waiting
“Fine,” Malfoy said eventually, eyeing him up warily. “I’ll tell you, but not here. Please.”
“Harry, this is getting out of hand. You need to talk to him.”
He fought the temptation to close his eyes. “Then yes, I suppose. I believe
He didn’t even hesitate for a second; Draco was desperate to show Potter that he can be good, that he doesn’t need to punish him, that he doesn’t need to
Potter returned with two full glasses. “Cheers.”
. He doesn’t want to… I can’t have him involved in the investigation.”
“It’s precisely how he sounds.”
So he made lists in his head. Trying to put some order in this wild fantasy, in this violently improbable imagination, he catalogued everything he could. His moods, his memories, his feelings, whatever he could put his hands on, he listed. It was all going to fit into a plan, somehow. He always used to have a plan, Draco Malfoy, the young prat. He just needed to try and think what could be a plan for
Can you die from being too aroused? Harry seriously considered the question as he pushed deeper inside, exploring this wonderous new surroundings, until he got to something that made Draco actually mewl.
“Oh,” Potter said, eyes widening in understanding. “I see.”
Draco pondered what he’s at liberty to say, but in the end he decided that fuck it. “Sometimes it’s the worst thing in the world. Not to be able to see her, to know she’s in pain because of me.”
“I’m sorry. That’s really rough.”
“He discovered the recipe, Draco. Of course he did. A talented wizard such as he, as mighty, as incredible as he was – of course he found it. The only one in the world, I do believe. For years he researched it, sought it, sought to make – me.” An almost apologetic smile appeared on His face, and there was nothing in Draco’s toolbox of emotional reactions he could use to deal with that, either. “I believe he thought he can… well, the legend was of a potion through which one could be reborn, but not entirely straightforward in the matter of how. What he did get was an imprint of his spirit, if you’d like. An inspiration of himself in me. The way the ingredients reacted together, each so strong on their own, I doubt anyone could have foreseen the exact result. It was a great risk Father took on my behalf, in order to create me.”
drunk! It’s my wedding day, I get to be a little sentimental!”
“I mean it. Whatever you want, I really don’t care anymore. After everything you’ve been through, everything that man did, I don’t… I honestly don’t care.”
“You have to be more careful,” Malfoy admonished as he tore the length of the room and lunged at him. For a few minutes Harry was too preoccupied in kissing his neck and his face furiously to even catch that he was speaking. “Potter. Potter!”
A snort, and Draco’s heart resumed normal activities. “You’re one weird egg, Potter. Daily reports, don’t forget. Oh, and, erm… don’t tell the others about this, all right? If anyone asks, you got a stiff telling-off, maybe even a beating. I don’t need anyone else lecturing me on how I let you off easy or some other crap.”
“Ah, right, about that. No, that’s not what I meant. I’m not going to go after him for that, I did give you my word.”
Harry didn’t know how to reply, so he was silent as he walked towards him and leaned on the windowsill. “Aren’t you freezing?”
“Harry. Please.” He huffed, but quietened, and Draco found he really didn’t know what to say. His head was on fire, underwater, some fucking how, and this was far beyond dangerous. “There’s a lot about me you don’t know yet. There are – things – complications. I can’t ever really… I can’t love anyone, not fully. I’ve given you what I can, but I… I can’t give any more. I can’t give you my heart.”
“My head does feel a little groggy,” he admitted quietly as he lowered onto the bed, and fucking hell, Draco would hurt himself
Harry was too stunned to say anything, so instead he grabbed the pale face in two hands and forced him to still. “Malfoy, look at me. Look at me.” Reluctantly, the grey eyes found his. “I don’t know what in the craziness all that was, I have no idea what’s happening tonight, but it doesn’t matter. I know this isn’t exactly what either of us had planned, but this is what we have now. And I won’t exchange this, or you, for anything else. Okay?” Harry pulled him tight against his chest. “Forget about the past, you mean everything to me now. Everything.”
“I know,” Potter chuckled, and his hand twitched like he was aching to place it on Draco, but he didn’t move. “I just want you to feel safe.”
On the other side there was no vegetation, nothing to cover the rich, deep brown of the earth. It was bare and basic and heartbreakingly familiar. There were lines in the ground, old and sacred, and Draco knew their meaning. There was comfort in that. He thought that if he lay there, just for a moment, the dirt will give him the perfect cover, and he will finally be safe.
“At the office, we work together.”
“He wouldn’t care about that,” Potter shook his head fondly. “He would like to have one just because he’d probably find the wretched thing
you do it?”
“You’re an idiot,” Draco muttered sadly. The corners of Harry’s mouth twitched.
Harry was planning to keep it a surprise, but Draco’s tone was really getting dangerous. “Actually, I took next week off. So we could have some time together.”
It took all the words out of his mouth, and Draco was left gaping. “I – okay,” he said in the end, flabbergasted. “I won’t.”
Harry struggled to swallow. His mouth was so dry. “Draco?” he managed somehow. For a second, a terrifying second, Harry watched as her face grew darker. “No – “
“Fine, I’ll take that. I’m not sure it’s exactly what I asked for, but I’m willing to settle. Was that so difficult, really?”
The next night they were all together in the Gryffindor common room, pleasantly trying to recover from the plethora of food Hogwarts supplied for dinner. Since it was New Year’s Eve, the whole castle was decorated; twinkling golden stars shot up and down banisters, real icicles shimmered in the hallways. But Harry didn’t really have eyes for decorations; whenever he was with him, all he could see was Malfoy. Malfoy and his soft, shiny hair; Malfoy and his slender, elegant form; Malfoy and the silver lines in his eyes. Ever since they spoke yesterday, and decided they are
“Why don’t you sleep here?” he asked tentatively. “No one else is in my room. You could take Ron’s bed, he won’t mind. Well, maybe he’d mind, but he won’t know about it, anyway.”
Harry’s voice was shaking slightly, but managed to sound furious all the same. “He was getting a little too close to the truth, wasn’t he, saying he’d seen Voldemort in Albania. It was you, then? With your little gang. Little new-Voldemort, you. You needed a distraction, and you thought that this little mystery would be enough to keep us off your tail – am I close?”
Malfoy laughed, and something seemed to have unclenched in his demeanor. “They are actually considered as the missing link between man and ape. Truly, science-wizards are stumped.”
, the cold voice said, and Draco was instantly and very violently ill all over the carpet. He couldn’t stand it anymore. He had to get out somehow. If he could slice his head open and cut the voice out with a knife, he’d do it. If he had to rip out his eye, reach into his brain and
“You have – I don’t – can you just tell me what the hell is going on here? I went to your bloody
“What are they doing? What kind of mess?” Panic flooded his mind and he
The thought of Him only intensified once inside the empty flat. Draco hugged himself and squeezed the jumpers until it almost smelled like He was there. If he closed his eyes and concentrated very hard, Draco could pretend like he can see His shadow behind his eyelids, sitting as He normally would on the armchair. Gods, only twenty-four hours and already he missed Him so much it hurt. Just to have Him here, nearby – it didn’t even need to be for long, He didn’t have to say anything or even look at him, just to be there. Draco didn’t need more than that. It may not have been great sometimes, but it was all he had, and he used to be perfectly content in his imperfect little world.
, like nothing he ever did in his life, “I don’t care what you fucking promised, Harry! What the hell do you think it means, now? You’ve broken every single promise you ever made me. What, did you think I could ever trust you again? I don’t want you here! Go away!”
“Yes,” he said, staring at her hard to see if she makes any moves to contradict him. Wisely, she remained silent.
“I understand,” he whispered.
“It doesn’t matter since when you knew me, I’m not that person anymore!” Draco was so frustrated, because couldn’t he see? “There’s – it’s not only what happened that you don’t know. You don’t even know who I am. You think I’m some – some – I don’t know, damsel in distress or an abandoned little puppy, but I’m not an innocent man. I killed – I tortured – I’m a bad person, Harry. I’m evil.”
Draco shrugged, looking at him only for a second, then averting his gaze quickly to the rug. “I wasn’t very absorbed with myself recently. My thoughts have been – elsewhere.”
“Fuck you, aunt Bellatrix,” he said curtly before turning and heading upstairs. Harry smiled, feeling the little victory swirl inside him, and gave the ashes one last look before he followed Malfoy to the dorm.
A painful moment passed. “I – I’m sorry. I don’t want you to see me like this.”
“That was, in fact, a question I meant to ask you. You would know by now that she used blood magic in order to track you.” Draco nodded hesitantly. “When she did, did you perhaps feel it? do you remember sensing anything when the spell was cast?”
“What is it?” Harry asked, brow furrowed, and Draco really wished he could disappear, but as always there was nowhere to run to.
. It made Draco feel this tingly, warm sensation in his insides that was not entirely unfamiliar and very much distressing. The scarlet robes were in his hands (after the way Draco reacted to them, Potter refused point blank to wear them around the house). Before he could start thinking too much about it Draco leaned forward and gave Potter a peck on his cheek. “I'll be fine. Go save the world, you bloody git. I will stay right here, waiting for you to return and show me how you
“The what?”
He closed his eyes a little warily after Potter left. He won the battle, yes, but the war was far from over. There was still so, so much to handle. Still… something definitely changed now that he'd given up. And on top of that, telling Potter about Grove’s death made him feel so much lighter, like releasing a fifty pound weight. Unbelievably enough, that night he actually slept.
“Draco? Are you okay?”
A sudden rush of energy allowed him to scoot back on the floor. “No,” he mumbled, though it may have been incoherent. He knew they have magic and spells, that they can force him to do whatever they wanted. But that was exactly the point, they would have to force him. He wasn’t going to just let them. He wasn’t. Draco shook his head like a man possessed, mumbling all along. “No, no, you can’t, you can’t.” Rutgrass stopped him halfway through the cell, and pulled him into standing, holding him in a tight embrace.
“That sounds – very gross, thanks, but…” Harry’s voice was light, but Draco knew him far too well. “You’ve not slept all night.”
“Is this how you end all your fights?” Draco asked instead of replying, still inexplicably stroking Potter’s matted hair. “Get the other person to save your life, so they can’t be mad anymore?”
, and
At first Draco did a natural, unavoidable double-take. Then he took a step back, also very expectedly. What was extremely
rules today. Is that clear?”
“You don’t have to,” Harry reminded him gently. He wanted so bad to touch him, but wasn’t sure if it’d be the right thing or not. The abuse Draco had been through – and he had absolutely no idea – but then Draco’s hand reached for his and he grabbed it, squeezing a sigh of relief. The hand was warm and rather clammy, but it was his Draco, and he wanted to support him so bad it was physically hurting him.
“Just to live, I suppose.” He took another sip, bringing the content of the pint to about halfway. He started to feel a little dizzy on top of it all. So a pint and a half before he is sozzled? Pathetic.
“Nope. I reckoned they knew enough about your position. But even if they did, they wouldn’t use it to get revenge on you. Once this is all over and done with, and you’re stronger again, we could try and arrange an arena for you and Ron to fight in. But he won’t do it unless it’s fair. You know it.”
“It’s not that I don’t want to,” Draco blurted, because he was stupid.
for the incredible beta!
Draco shook his head with disgust. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.” He began to wonder if the memory had been left in his mind for a reason. He was not about to play along. “Besides, your lot has been doing it to me for days now. Doesn’t seem to be working.”
“I do have a few ideas,” he whispered softly, before Harry’s tongue was in his mouth and he was rendered speechless.
But how could he possibly take it? There was no chance, not ever, that he could actually go forward and do it. Him? Doing something? What a ridiculous concept. He couldn’t even speak
Draco lunged at Grove’s feet, pulling at the edge of his robes. “Stop,” he cawed, “stop it, please, stop.” Instead of replying, Grove kicked him aside, but Draco wasted no time crawling back to him. “Please!” he screamed, his voice breaking. “Please, I’m sorry!”
He was there that night, after all. He’d seen just how much Harry cared, how much he was willing to do for Draco. And he would absolutely use it to break Harry good and proper. Hell, with everything he can tell him – and Harry has no idea, not even a tiny little bit, not even close to what Grove has done and will no doubt shower him with. Grove was the master of tearing people apart, after all. Draco had seen it up close, had felt it, and no matter what happens he
“Could you summon us some glasses?” he asked sheepishly, and Harry did so in an instant. Malfoy poured a generous amount of the smokey-scented liquid into each, then handed Harry a glass. “Did you ever try it before?”
Draco shook his head. “I’d just feel so much better if…”
Harry laughed a little, but it was pretty forced. Malfoy gestured him into an open doorway on the top floor. “You said that Voldemort wasn’t there all the times that Greyback attacked you. Does that mean it happened more than once?”
going on. With everything that’s happened last week – “
“Stuck with me, then, Potty? Oh, poor little Golden Boy. Don’t worry – at least it'll be quick.”
Draco rolled his eyes to Him, begging Him wordlessly to stop. Please, he’d learned his lesson. He knew now just how bad he was, how terribly he messed up. But there was no ending it, it may never end. It could go on forever. It could go on forever, and he would deserve it all. Even if it was the most terrible, the most twisted – even when it was going to kill him. Even if young him was so pathetically compelling, that to watch him literally hurt Draco’s chest. He deserved it, even when it would rip him to shreds again, just like it did the last time, only worse – only double as bad. It didn’t matter. He deserved it. He…
“I thought I heard her voice, right before I cast the shield. Like she was calling me. Then – I don’t really know anymore. I was sort of speared on the shield itself, and everything was a little blurry. It felt like – “ Draco paused, and there was fear in the grey of his eyes. “Professor, it felt like I was burning, but I didn’t feel the flames. Could it be that – through the spell – “
“B-because I – “ it didn’t
Was it some sort of test? Draco’s eyes narrowed even more. “But you don’t – “
“God, it’s so great to be outside. I feel like I’ve been cooped up in the office for weeks now.”
In the end, it was late and he wanted to sleep. Or rather, thought that sleep is something he should do. Wasn’t that part of a normal person’s life? He so needed to feel like he was normal right now. He took himself to the bedroom almost by force, for it was the strangest feeling in the world to go in there alone. He was not allowed to do that. He was not
“Hey, they’re your friends. You’d know better.”
Draco wanted to help them, but he was impaled by his own magic. It didn’t matter. Fighting the Dark Lord was Harry’s calling. Fighting the Death Eaters – well, that’s why the others were there. He only had one task. Before the school year began he got the task, only then he misunderstood it.
, or we’ll have no idea what’s going on and whether it’s safe for you to return or not. How about if I tell him a little bit more, but not mention your name?”
Yes, he had no doubt about that. Still. “You’d need me.”
Draco swallowed heavily. “Potter?”
“He won’t do a thing,” Harry said, trying to keep his bitterness at bay, perhaps not so successfully. “He doesn’t care. When Mrs. Malfoy was there he didn’t do squat to help her, did he? He would just get mad at us for even going in the first place.”
“They will remember this,” he spat, barely able to stay up with the way the ropes forced him to bend. “All of them. They will remember that when you had to face me, a wandless boy and all alone, you couldn’t do it by yourself. You couldn’t even fight him. You will be a laughing stock, a shame. All the Crucios in the world won’t change that.”
at the most erratic of times and could easily talk about any given subject in the universe. He tested her, actually, after the torturous first session. Not on purpose, but it sort of came out like that; he just changed subjects randomly and quickly, and she sailed through them with the ease of an old sea captain. Draco kind of hated her for it. He used to be good in making conversation, too. It didn’t make her all that special.
“The Dark Lord?” Bellatrix repeated, stunned. “You wish to speak to Him?”
would be enough. Next time…
That’s got to be the understatement of the century. Look at yourself, how easy it is to break your walls – you’re not even trying, not in earnest – Legilimence!”
But instead of punishment, Potter laughed.
make them, and he
But this was just so very unbelievable! Draco breathed in and out a few times in quick succession. The chaos in his head broke into proper mayhem. It seized every last bit of him and
“You failed me, son. You failed me, and even worse still, you failed our Lord. I wonder what you thought you could achieve, coming here today? Did you expect to see your mother for the last time? Did you think we would grant you this mercy? After you have been disloyal, a shame, a disgrace upon the family name and the Dark Lord? You will not receive any mercy or pardon from us today, Draco. You will have to pay the ultimate price for your failure.”
“Hey, it’s going to be fine. Would you get up? Please?”
“Please tell me what to do, Draco. Tell me how to fix it.”
“I was not!” Harry yelped indignantly. Malfoy only chuckled in response. “I was absolutely not! I was just looking at you to see – to see if you’re doing okay. I mean this isn’t your room and all, and I just wanted to make sure you were… comfortable.”
It only took him a minute to decide, and really, it wasn’t much of a decision. Concern and trepidation filled his heart and forced him to jump to his feet. Mumbling something to Ron and pulling the invisibility cloak out of his bag, he practically ran in the deserted corridors, not worrying too much about the sound his feet must be making. Only when he reached the steps to the astronomy tower did he halt. He climbed them slowly, carefully, making absolutely no sound. When he reached the top, a few long tormenting moments later, it took a while until his breath slowed down enough for him to be able to hear the two speaking. The door was closed, so he had to press his ear against it, and even then the voices were muffled. Wishing he had Fred and George’s extendable ears, he willed his heartbeat to slow down so he could better hear what’s being said inside.
“I swear, Draco, I really wanted to come before. I couldn’t stand thinking of you alone, waiting – I mean, thinking I’d be there, and how I was failing you. I was just… I thought it would be worse if I came and you saw how – how fucked up I was about it. I even scared myself.” He sniffled rather loudly, and Draco’s poor heart gave up in a wild ‘poof!’ and exploded.
They were to work on a Polyjuice potion. Since Harry had seen Hermione make one their second year, he wasn’t exactly concerned with the task; surely she would be able to repeat her success. Therefore he took the new arrangements in Potions class to resume his attack on the blond, and since the environment rendered him pretty much helpless, Malfoy had to listen. Ron and Hermione knew everything anyway, so Harry spoke freely.
“He’s a liar, Draco. Your boyfriend is a liar. Don’t you think there’s a chance he could have – “
“Thank you,” he breathed, and maybe Potter didn’t even hear it because his eyes went all round and misty and his smile was very hesitant. “I – thank you, Potter. Really.”
“Yes, Draco. Your little target was seen in the castle right after an intruder alarm was set off. This certainly does complete the puzzle, so to speak.”
now, where he belonged, where he knew the world best, and it gave him some clarity. Like a sip of water to a man dying of thirst, he could feel the flames in his mind dying down, calming a little. He knew where he was, on his knees. This was something. At least he knew where he was.
For a long moment he could only brave a shrug. “I don’t really know. Some of the guards said he went crazy, that something happened to him that night. There were rumors he met the Dark Lord himself, you know. I didn’t think it was that - I used to think it was just the sting of losing his perfect status. Many of them stopped respecting him after so many people in his charge escaped, and I don’t think he really recovered from that. Though I won’t say he wasn’t mental, because he certainly was. Absolutely mental. The things he…” Draco stopped abruptly when his voice broke. Breathing became problematic once more.
“Come on,” Harry breathed impatiently. This was no time for their stupid games. “I really do need to see him. It’s urgent.”
Harry thought about it for a second. Now that it was out there the possibility seemed too obvious, and he didn’t know how it didn’t occur to him sooner. They have been spending so much time together, anyway; and Malfoy would be grateful to stop having to relieve his worst moments and start visiting Harry’s, he was sure of that.
The smile on Malfoy’s face seemed strained. “I don’t think I’ll be back to my serpent-covered house, Potter. Not in the near future, at least.” He heaved a sigh.
“What?” Draco’s eyebrow jumped to his hairline. “Why would you dating someone hurt her?”
Without thinking about it he fell to his knees, pressing his face to the edge of His cloak. “Please, Sir, not… please… I… can’t…”
“Murders?” Draco was barely able to ask. “Who…?”
, but you’re supposed to be my friend, aren’t you? I’ve never seen you complain about the balance in our
“Dearest, you don’t have to stay here. We could – you could sleep in my room, if you’d rather.” Draco gave his mother an apprehensive look.
Truth be told, he was doing it because he was fucking
“But you weren’t trying before! You weren’t attacking me when I succeeded, so of course I could do it no problem!”
. “It helps to share, I hear.” He really, really did want to help.

“After you kissed him.” He had to look at her now; she sounded so business-like, not at all stunned, like he was telling her something about the weather and not about how he went and kissed their all-time school rival. “Did he say anything? Did he kiss you back?”
” he begged, once more reaching for her hand and squeezing it tight. “Please, you must do this now. You must leave. I’ll be fine, I promise. I will see you back at school.” He could tell she did not believe him. It didn’t matter now, really. All that was important was that she will get the others and get the hell out of this wretched place.
“I don’t side-along,” Draco said carefully. “Not anymore. Not since – “
He crept into their bedroom in the dead of night, when even the most insistent of the waiting gave up. Harry was awake, obviously, but he pretended like he wasn’t. Draco hated how touched he was by this simple gesture. It was like everything Harry did affected him tenfold. Or maybe he was just overly sensitive, now. Maybe it would pass, like everything ultimately did. Even H-him. Even him.
Queasy with relief, Harry slunk against the wall, unable to speak. Hermione put her hand on his shoulder. “So you guys have been spending the time all right?”
He was finally going to get his wish, even if many years too late.
“Never mind, it’s a Muggle thing. Give me a second, I need to find something else to focus on.” Malfoy nodded and waited as Harry looked around. It wasn’t that much different than thinking of a happy memory in order to summon a Petronus. He just needed to think hard and focus, that’s all. And it's only Malfoy in front of him, not Snape who was only ever looking to hurt him. He felt himself calming steadily. He took another couple of deep breaths. “Okay.”
“Are you not hungry, Harry?” Hermione asked quietly, and Harry found he was struggling to meet her gaze. He shook his head and stared as the others were eating, but since for some reason the image disturbed him, he found his eyes wandering around the room.
them. Frighteningly elaborate, so many hours were poured into building them, expanding his plans of revenge. Gods, he was going to destroy them. But then – well, they got to him first, didn’t they? After they broke him there were no more dreams left. And when it comes to the word Potter used… "Justice?" He asked, his voice weak. "I don't really think the term applies here." He got his taste of justice before. Nothing in the world was quite as terrifying.
Harry shook with repulsion, still not completely able to comprehend. “So you’re really – you’re okay with this?”
“If you so much as touch him – “
Accepting compliments was uncharted territory, so he grimaced. “I was always hilarious, Harry Potter. It was you who didn’t use to have a sense of humor.”
Draco didn’t have an inkling why Potter would think that should surprise him. “Of course you don’t. When you’ve had the fate of the free world rest on your shoulders, you couldn’t go around trusting too many people. I doubt that’s changed very much since then.”
It took three seconds before he stopped fighting the laughter. His more drastic answer,
Fuck. Draco should have seen it coming, but… just
“Just because we have feelings, Malfoy, doesn’t mean it’s wrong to show them,” He exclaimed hotly against his back. Then he brought his head up and placed it on Malfoy’s shoulder, looking at his two friends who were snickering.
“I don’t do that,” Draco mumbled, alarmed by Potter’s hurt look and feeling like he needed to explain himself. “Touching. I don’t… with people. Never.” That was about as accurately as he could put it.
Word count: 1k
“No one. I fell down a flight of stairs. How careless of me. Now, if you don’t mind…” Malfoy pushed himself against the wall and got back up to his feet. Harry remembered seeing him limping around, and wondered just how much further his injuries extend than his heavily bruised chest. The blond went back to where he dropped his pan and started cleaning it again. It took Harry a few seconds of debating with himself, but he ultimately followed the boy and continued to clean his forgotten bedpan.
“I don’t – who’s out there?” Or in there? Or in other words what, in all the gods’ names, was happening?
Harry looked at him, at that pointy face he imagined to death over the past few months. First it was with great enthusiasm, then with hatred unlike he had ever known, then with something resembling grief. The face that caused him so much pain, so much agony. The face he dreamed of every night. The face he loved.
“He will come for you,” his father exclaimed quickly. “After all you have done for him – your sacrifice – Draco, you just need to reach out, and he will not hesitate to come, I am sure of it.”
– “I got bits of my magic back, little by little. Never enough for a full antidote, only small flares at a time, to encourage me without my even noticing. It made it all feel natural. My body, my magic reacting to Him like that, it made me think I loved…” Draco closed his eyes, shook his head, but nothing seemed to be helping.
What if he said yes, and the door will open, and his mother will come through? What if she sat next to his bed and her eyes – and her hands – and her hair that always smelled like summer – what if she was there and she was his mother again? What if there was someone in the world who loved him? Really loved him, without hesitation, without complications, without refrain. Could he stand that? Could he trust it? Having someone who – just loved him, really loved him, wouldn’t it hurt so terribly? Was he able to do it? What if he let himself be loved again?
Harry was a little startled by the darkness in his voice. He looked at him closely. “Did she torture you? That time you told me Voldemort questioned you? Is that where you got all those burns and cuts?”
He thought about it for a second. Then… “Yes, I did! I got a papercut from the letter!” he produced the sheet of parchment from his pocket. “Do you think this was somehow connected to the alarm?”
“It shouldn’t be too hard to get hairs off of unsuspecting people – not that I have too much practice with that,” Ron smiled, and Harry mirrored his smile back. The three of them were actually getting to their feet when a yell from Draco made them pause immediately.
But he didn’t. Instead he heard someone else scream, a hoarse and low voice which made his already frozen body freeze all over again. They were torturing somebody
“But Malfoy…” Potter seemed in even more agony than before. “If what you say is true, something must be done about it. Someone has to say something, to do something about it. They can’t just continue abusing people like that. It doesn’t work that way.”
,” Potter sounded horrified. “You can’t!”
“So you stopped eating? Sleeping?” Harry’s voice suggested incredulity, but remained soft.
Draco tried for a coherent response, but all he managed was a startled “What?”
Are you – Draco. Seriously. You need to tell me what’s wrong.”
“You promised. You said – you said if I were loyal, you would never leave me. I have been loyal, and you… you left. I was all alone. You promised me, Sir, you promised you’d stay…”
“Cousin Draco!” he yelled, and the only thing that stopped him from flinging himself into his arms was Harry catching and hoisting his little body in the air before he had the chance. He was a baby the last time Draco had seem him, a tiny toddler. Now he was a full little person, squiggling in Harry’s hands and yelling something happy or other, his hair rapidly changing colors like it used to whenever he was excited.
Warnings: none
“She doesn’t really,” Harry twiddled his thumbs, feeling the heat still in his face. “She just agrees to check our work. But then she fixes it all up, and it’s like she’s doing it herself anyway.”
“Okay. I’ll stop asking. As long as you take care of yourself, so I don’t have to pick you up from the floor anymore in random deserted corridors.” He didn’t try and check if it sounded wrong or not, because the look on the blond’s face didn’t seem so dangerous anymore, and he calmed down again. Although having Malfoy sit next to him was a little disconcerting.
He seemed to come back to his senses with a deviously soft smile. “Regret it? Seriously? It was the best moment of my life.”
And now he knew.
The absolute train wreck of thoughts in his head was incredibly demanding, and Draco was still drowning. “So – so you’re – him?” From his corner of the world, Harry made a gurgling, panicked sound.
“The scent. I can still detect some of Potter’s smell from when he was here earlier, so that confused me a little, but… no. The boy here is definitely not him. It is a familiar scent, though.”
“Yes. My partner.”
“I just mean, you don’t have to come every weekend. I know you have other things to do, and you never come in anyway. So it’s not like – I’m not trying to be rude, I just want you to know you’re not obligated to come.”
“No, you did nothing wrong,” Potter finally deigned to look at him. “Okay? Nothing. I’m… I’m sorry, I can’t think very straight right now, I think the wine has affected me some. Is it all right if we, er, carry on this conversation tomorrow?”
Fuck, fuck, fucking hell. Hysteria, pure and baffling, tore every single thought in his head to pieces. He could not raise his head no matter how much he wanted to. He could not talk. He could hardly even breathe; his body was at attention, yet every single muscle was forced to relax. He was a puppet on a string. He was nothing. The tears that gathered in the corners of his eyes couldn’t even leak out.
Pansy arrived in such a moment, and he was absolutely terrified. Harry was standing a few feet away, obviously lost, Granger was nowhere to be seen, and Mother was just on the verge of calling a Healer. Draco was on the floor, crying in hysterical bouts, begging his fucking eyes out for them to just
, absolutely fine. Everything was just fine. Why wouldn’t it be? It’s not like his heart was crushed to fucking paste and everything hurt. His head did
Draco didn’t comment about that last remark, because there was absolutely no chance Potter would understand. “In any case, I should not have said that. You are observant, naturally. You notice things all the time. And you’re the only one who noticed me in a long while, so… I don’t really get to say that to you.”
“You know you can’t be with Draco! Lucius will be coming here too – he will not be pleased to see you together – “
It was actually the progress with the bond that brought about the first bout of real change. Or, well, the lack of it, anyway. It took as long as four days for Harry to despair of the Healers’ glazed looks, chart-tapping and general head-scratching. When they started questioning, “are we sure the bond’s even real?” he slammed the door in their startled faces and began setting the course for a new plan. Four days of small yet nerve-wracking quibbling, and now this topic proved to be the cherry on top. Mother and Harry just couldn’t see eye to eye; their heated debate (nearing argument, nearing fight, nearing full-on war) lasted most of the afternoon and came this close to sending Draco begging and pleading to the shiny hospital floor. He just couldn’t take it anymore. When they both turned to him, flushed-faced, panting, Draco was prepared to scream. They wanted him to make the choice: Mother had her mind set on this ridiculously expensive private Healer somewhere in the Alps, one she could in no way afford, and Harry was hell-bent on bringing Hermione Granger on the case. And they wanted him to decide. Him. Draco let’s-say-Malfoy, yeah? They wanted him to decide, and what in the world made them think he was capable?
He could feel himself tensing up, breath coming in a little shallower. He swallowed. “What did he want?”
“There’s Aurors there too, in the prison, you know. Are you saying they didn’t do anything to stop the guards?”
The man was closer now, and suddenly – too suddenly – dread the likes of which Draco could not have even guessed seized him, something terrible, something visceral. Draco looked back to His face in a silent plea, but the wall was already at his back and he couldn’t run, couldn’t get away. Still Draco scrambled against it as if it could save him. He was well aware it couldn’t.
“Merlin,” Draco groaned in pain, and Harry stilled immediately. It was excruciating, trying to hold himself in place, when all his hips wanted to do was thrash wildly and imbed himself in Draco. He started moving in really, really slowly, whenever the Slytherin drew a breath. “Stop, stop, my gods! Harry, stop!” he had to hold his breath in order not to move any further. Draco exhaled a few shaky, strained pants. “Okay, but go all the way, all right? In one push, do you think you can do it?”
“It doesn’t count when you can’t say no. I’ve been – I know I made some mistakes. I never should have asked you the other day to… I’m sorry. I’m working on it, but it takes times. I hope you can forgive me.”
“Yes, Draco. He will arrive very shortly. In the meantime, why don’t you handle your classmates? Tie them and round them up in the corner. Soon enough I expect the Polyjuice potion will wear off and we could easily identify them. Then when He comes along, you shall receive an honor beyond your dreams.”
“Why are you doing this?” Draco asked in a shaky voice.
He sank back into bed, thinking fast. Last night he and Malfoy kissed, but it wasn’t exactly like their previous kisses. It was… he blushed immediately at the very thought. But Malfoy was still unsure of what he wanted, still confused with the whole situation. Not that Harry felt more at ease with it, not even close. God. What a mess.
Just… no.
“Did he… when you… how was he towards you?”
, he told himself over and over again.
“You don’t want to break the conditioning?”
, and even
that he nearly fainted. It took a while until he managed even sitting upright, and his vision went swimming. Everything was black and white and dotted and unintelligible. He took some practiced breaths (doom was an altogether familiar experience by now, yes, thank you for noticing) and calmed his hysterical heart down. All right. Step by step now. He can do it. He can… Draco looked down at himself and frowned. He was fairly certain he didn’t have a pair of trousers from such a material, with a checkered pattern that looked more like a dish towel than anything else. He was also wearing Harry’s awful jumper, and – his socks? Draco blinked at the figure sitting on the carpet barefoot. Good gods. Shaking his head mentally (doing it physically would result in his nose deep in the coffee table), Draco found enough strength in himself to get up very cautiously and waddle his way to Harry.
“You promised you won’t leave, too,” Draco reasoned, which was perfectly acceptable since this was only a dream. He was not going to get destroyed over it like he did with Him. Harry’s response, however, was shockingly different to His.
There was very clear frustration on Potter’s face, and it was a little scary to see, but Draco didn’t let up his scowl. “I’m not investigating you, I swear I’m not. It’s just a little… the whole thing is kind of seedy. Macnair popping up twice, and he’s only been killed recently… With what you’ve told me about him, and with everything else – “
“Erm…” Draco was forced into saying something, because Harry looked positively helpless. “Congratulations on your win last week, Ginevra.”
, was everything that mattered.
. Draco’s love for Him was probably the most painful, at least physically speaking. It
the grease from the chippy in the corner, it was that realistic. There was a distinct Diagon-Ally-vibe to the place; the emulation was obviously of a magical street, as the store outside which Harry was standing had a terrific display of magic carpets and little toy brooms. There was even litter on the pavement; Harry saw a chocolate frog wrapper blowing in the wind.
“That’s genius, Malfoy.”
but then he realized what he was seeing, and his head pulled up as if magnetized. If Draco was stunned into silence beforehand, now he really would not have been able to say a word.
And it was far, far more than Draco was willing or able to accept. His cheeks flushed a deep red and his head was spinning. “You really don’t have to do that, Potter. There's no need for you to trouble yourself.”
“Are you sure? You – trust me? Just like that?”
The door slammed behind them and the cry was cut halfway through. Draco wasted no time before he threw up what felt like his whole intestines on the floor, only missing Harry's shoes by a small miracle.
“I’m…” only bewildered out of his mind, he supposed. “Yes, I’m fine. Did he agree? Is he going to see that the flat is safe?”
Twenty minutes later found them finally making their way to the living room, where Mother, Pansy, Blaise and Theo were waiting, looking smashing in their formal robes. A large vase sat on the table in front of them filled with delicate golden roses, each of them a portkey.
. He didn’t even sense the nausea Harry’s name brought in him this time, because he was out cold on the stone floor before he could notice it. The last thing he did notice was a slight tingling feeling on his neck.
In any case, now that he had the dough, it was time to go about and make the purchase. When next he had some free time, the following Sunday, he went for it, more than only slightly alarmed. Draco hadn’t bought anything for himself in… well… far too long to remember. Unless groceries count, of course, and even that he’d only started doing incredibly recently. He was so stunned when he walked into the shop – so large, so detestably lit, and the music so loud it nearly pierced his eardrums – that he almost stepped right back out. But then he steeled himself, gritted his teeth, clenched his fists and thought of England (and Potter). He could do this. He could do this. True that he’d failed before, true that he had no concrete evidence to support his hypothesis, true that he was a barely-even-solid mess, but this time, Draco thought he could maybe actually do it.
Malfoy let out a low whistle. “Wow, Potter. They really do sound terrible.”
“Nah, saw nothing. I was going to – your flat – “ he stopped for a cough or two, and Draco presented him with a glass of water from the bedside cabinet. After drinking his fill he continued; “was lucky I managed to get up the stairs. You – Draco, you saved my life.”
Having realized he didn’t deserve it made absolutely no difference in his situation; the rod still tore him apart and Him inside after it hurt just in the way it did then, but worse. He was still dying. His father’s face was still right in front of his eyes, in so much pain, and he was suffering eternally. This was still happening, and there was still nothing he could do about it, nothing at all. He had no voice from all the screaming and no energy in his withering limbs and no magic he could actually use. There was nothing he could do to stop it, to stop Him. There was no comfort in knowing he’s going through something he didn’t deserve.
Harry laughed and his smile brightened even more. “Unless you want me to.”
“And what exactly is your girlfriend doing here?” Draco thought hard for something to say, and to his horror found he hasn’t got much. Thankfully, Granger wasn’t the smartest witch in their year for nothing.
Fixing his gaze on the table between them, Draco firmly gave up. “I don’t know if I… I don’t even know what that means anymore. I don’t remember.”
At some point Ron must have come into the room, because he called his name gently; Harry prominently ignored him. He couldn’t speak to anyone right now, anyone at all - he was worried if he opened his mouth he will be sick. So he squeezed his eyes shut and tried to empty his mind, concentrating only on his breathing. He was not thinking about Malfoy.
“So what if they are?” Harry frowned.
Draco’s look of misery made for something thick and painful in Harry’s stomach, but thankfully shock was able to cover most of it. “You bloody idiot. I thought something happened
He released the biggest sigh. "Look, I get what you’re trying to say, all right? I know you’re a bloody good guy. You’re not going to take advantage of me. I get it. Your flowers and thank-you note are awaiting in your dorm. Now, you’ve kind of been all up my arse lately to eat, and if you don’t let me go soon, lunch will be over.”
And it was fucking
Then the door opened and all hell broke loose.
and a
, for bloody doing something, and every second he didn’t was a waste. Draco could be suffering God knows what by now. It had been five days. He would be tortured so bad – if he was even alive – and the thought alarmed him so much he jumped to his feet. No, Draco couldn’t be dead. They would keep him alive in the hope that Harry would come running there to save him. Well, he bloody well would, if they would only let him leave! He threw the mug against the wall, and relished the sound of crackling china. This was absurd. This was illegal, he was most certain. They can’t keep him here forever. They would have to release him at some point, and as soon as they would he will just – just –
“Gladly. So, Malfoy… had a good week?”
“Potter,” Grove’s voice set every hair on Draco’s body standing. “And a guest, I see. I’d say it’s good to see you, little Draco, but I won’t. I don’t think it means very well for me, that you’re here.”
“Can I kiss you?” Potter asked sheepishly. Draco wanted to give him the entire world, but all he could offer were his lips, crashing hot and heavy on Potter’s unsuspecting face. He took it well, though, and within a second he returned the kiss, panting slightly. It must have been torture for him, but Potter didn’t move an inch, just stayed right where he was. Draco wanted him so bad he could die with it right here and now. He bit Potter’s lower lip gently – gods, to have
“I was the one who brought him there in the first place,” Draco whispered to his hands. “It was my fault he was in danger.”
Everything was white. Well, everything
The sound of the wind didn’t make it inside the cave; only the waves, swishing gently to lap against the rocks. And now laughter, too, a little breathless – a question. A secret. An invitation, taken in full, tender under the distant, affectionate moon.
“Yes!” he shouted, and then, “I mean – “ because to be absolutely honest he didn’t know.
Well, now he was looking up. He was still frightened, but he wasn’t here alone. Potter was sitting close enough for comfort, not too close to cause alarm, and he was confident and sure in a way Draco couldn’t even dream of being. And he promised him on Friday, hadn’t he? That he wasn’t going to let anything happen to him? As much as he didn’t believe it then – or now – it was still a sweet concept. For a few hours, Draco completely forgot about the man who came to the flat last night.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. No. He couldn't. This was just - no. He could not be doing what he’s thinking of doing – but also he’d already done so much worse, hadn’t he? By waving a white flag, did he not just betray the one person he was sworn never to betray? Had he not just forfeited his life?
“You – He’s not big or bad, but He will destroy you if He thought you were trying to come between us. I’d seen Him do it before, when His colleagues tried to insinuate… things about me. And they were people He worked with, so He showed some restraint. I don’t even want to imagine… please.”
. How he couldn’t even come up with adequate adjectives because he was so extremely tired after not having slept in about forever. That could maybe explain why the curtain was so unstable that Saturday. The mild
“Why did he do it?” Harry bent forward and whispered in the boy’s ear. Malfoy turned to look at him, startled.
Malfoy poured some of the potion on his shirt and dabbed his gash and bruise with the liquid, and had to moan in relief when it eased the pain. Harry could see the wound closing up right in front of his eyes. It was making him slightly sick all over again.
“Yes, I’m fine, really. We’ll talk about it all tomorrow. We’ll pick right where we left off – with the talking, I mean, not the kissing. Er. Because we won’t have to do anything that, um, you won’t – well. I think it’s time for me to go. Been up very early, and… Erm, have a good night, yeah? I’ll – I’ll see you tomorrow.” And Potter quite literally bolted before Draco could even try to decipher the nonsense he uttered.
“Shut up about him!” Harry was somehow able to say. His mind was frenetic with exhaustion and tantalizing, breathtaking rage. He wasn’t sheltered anymore by confusion and fear. Oh, no. He could feel it now, every last bit of it, every excruciating tinge.
“I’ve always liked the cold,” Malfoy retorted with a shrug. “And the snow, too. I wanted to see it.” He sounded strangely young, and it was so endearing, Harry struggled not to hug him. Malfoy held out his hand and caught a snowflake, which melted instantly in his palm. “It’s so… pure, and light. It makes everything so beautiful.”
It was fairly simple, possibly achievable, and absolute madness to consider; first, he was going to get his N.E.W.Ts, as Hermione repeatedly suggested. And then once he has them, if he reaches that far, he’d look into the possibility of Muggle higher education. There were countless institutions he could go to, the brochures promised, and the more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea. Muggles were truly amazing, and there was still so much he didn’t know about them, so much he wanted to learn. So many things they mastered that wizards were painfully ignorant about. It would be a fantastic opportunity for him, if he could manage it. And… if it were possible, he thought he might even know what course he’d like to take. It’s just, well, he’s seen that most of these places also taught Psychology. And… it sounded pretty interesting, is all.
– he will apologize for that later. Harry didn’t deserve that from him, Draco’s done enough damage. He still beat himself over Harry’s hurt look earlier that night, before the whole… naked situation. There was so much to make amends for. He hurt Harry too many times to count, viciously, systematically, even if not always deliberately. Hell, he’d been lying to him all this time. While Harry did what, care for him? Try so hard to keep him happy, to keep him safe, to keep him warm? And Draco gave him nothing but lies and deceit?
“Draco, our boy. How wonderful to see you again. We missed having you around, didn’t we, Narcissa?” he took a step towards Malfoy, who shook visibly. The silvery moonlight made him look more like a painting than a real person. Greyback didn’t miss it. “Looking especially lovely tonight, little Draco. I always say kids look tastiest under the moon… oops, did I say tasty? I meant beautiful.” And with one long step he closed the distance between them, and wrapped his arms around Malfoy. Harry could just make the stony, frightened face from above Greyback’s shoulder.
“Yeah, Harry's a special case. Old Softie we call him here. Because of the never-ending crying and all.”
, caring
“I didn’t think I had anyone to talk to. I – didn’t think you cared.” His eyes were fixated on the wall behind Harry’s head.
It was bitter cold, and every exposed part of Harry’s skin was practically burning, but he did not move. Slowly, gradually, the boy in his arms relaxed into his hold, and became still. Then Malfoy pushed him away and Harry let him, taking a step back and looking at the pale face. He wasn’t crying anymore. Instead, his silvery eyes seemed almost like they were on fire.
And it was daft and a lot wrong of Harry to do that right now, he needed his magic, but damn if that wasn’t reason number twelve, right there in front of him – in his arms – breathing on his neck – on his lips – giving him the control, all of it, letting him set the pace, so warm and soft and perfect and
Almost, for two reasons; one, he wasn’t really alone (Potter came every night but for Saturdays. Every. Single. Night.) and two, if one were to get
“What?”
. The perfect speech he planned – clever, smooth, entirely not obnoxious – completely gone. Draco would be so lucky to even come across as coherent. He turned to leave in a panic when a hand closed around his wrist.
“What, because you didn’t want to kiss me? Don’t be an idiot. You should know me better than that.”
“I know,” he assured her in his calmest voice. It was still a bit difficult to speak to such a large audience, even though they were all people he knew, people he cared for, even.
“I’m not going to give up on you, Malfoy. Not until you actually do it. Then, you can be as terrible as you want. But until then I’m going to prove to you that there is always a choice.” He left the blond standing in the classroom, head bent, looking like the weight of the world was on his shoulders.
Harry blinked at him, confused. “That he was a half-blood? He was. What?” Draco shook his head, because this wasn’t it, but what he thought he heard… just couldn’t be. “It’s true. Voldemort, or well, Riddle, he was a half-blood. The Marvolo part was his magical ancestry, but Riddle was a Muggle. You can check it yourself. If we get out of here, I mean.”
“All right, for you. I’ll try to turn off my Malfoy Magic for a shout.”
The smoke kept getting darker and darker, and it stung his throat and made his eyes water. It must have acted as a sort of a sound-muffler, too, because Harry could barely hear what he was certain were pretty loud voices from the Death Eaters trapped on the other side of it. Out of the smoke a body slammed into him, and Harry caught on just in time when a little hand took his and he grabbed Ron and Hermione, four bodies tight against one another, and the little house-elf at their knees. In an instant they were all gone into the tight black void that Harry will never learn to like and away from the smell of something burning.
“Please, don’t think about it like that. Think of it as if you’re… finally punishing me.” He swallowed hard. “It probably wouldn’t hurt so much, to be fair. And I’ve had way worse anyway, I might not even feel it. Please, do it.”
“You do? But – oh, I knew it!” Malfoy said, for a moment too excited with the revelation to remember their very serious chat. “I always knew you must have something like… But, in any case,” he cleared his throat and his expression became grave once more, “that’s not going to be enough, not with Greyback. You're going to have to cover your scent too. I can make a potion for you, if you’d like. Together with the cloak, it just might work.”
“I know you’re not Him. I never said you were.”
“Morning, Potter,” he heard the quick response, and shuddered a little at the fact that he was shirtless. He could feel the grey gaze on his body. quickly he dove into his case and pulled on a shirt.
No, he really wasn’t. “Why… why do you have that picture?”
Potter’s eyes were blazing with warmth so intense Draco felt it all the way across the table. “How about I bring both? An appetizer, dessert and maybe a… bottle of wine, if you cared for some?”
“It’s okay, Neville, you can let him go now. It’s fine, I promise.”
He was sadder for Harry, but at least he could be free now. At least he could go back to being a good person in peace. Draco wanted to close his eyes, but he found he simply couldn’t; he needed to see Harry now, he needed it, if it was the last thing he was going to see. It was most definitely the last thing he was going to see. All this time he was dying, for years he was dying, and now was finally the end. He had been waiting for so long. It was honestly so, so hard. Now that he reached the last of it he could finally admit it.
“That's a serious allegation, Malfoy. A very serious one.”
All right, then. All right. He was on his feet, and he was walking. No one paid him any attention, because he didn’t matter. That was good. The knife was hidden in his jumper sleeve (Harry’s jumper – no, not Harry, not right now, gods fucking damn it). His whole body felt weird, hyper-sensitive yet numb in the same breath. He was never aware of how loud the flowing of blood in his veins was, but he could actually hear it now. He could feel the air, cold against his skin. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to die.
… but the voice was tiny and it was nothing against the sea of rage, of hurt, of “You think I need you for that? Why don’t you go and solve your fucking murders and save the bloody world again and be the fucking hero?”
“Oh relax, Potter,” Malfoy spat, his eyes finally finding their way back to Harry. “I didn’t tell him anything he didn’t already know. Who your friends are, what teachers drool over you, that kind of thing. Nothing that satisfied him to hear.”
Draco didn’t have an appropriate response, so he took Harry’s hand in his and pressed a brief kiss to it. Harry’s smile did that soft thing it does, and Draco’s heart melted into a puddle, and life was perplexing and anxiously wonderous. It was a little hysterical, but Draco imagined there might be a chance they could somehow be happy, after all.
Draco had exactly a second to realize what was happening before it did; he heard the whoosh of the leather a fraction before the whip landed on his skin. No matter how much he tried, he could not hold in the whimper. The whip was his least favorite. They’ve used it quite often – Cruciatus curse was worse in every way imaginable, but it didn’t leave any scars, and Grove wanted to see what he was doing. He wanted to have little reminders of his victories, so he took to many Muggle weapons, whips and canes and crops and knives. He loved seeing his work on Draco, seeing scars and bruises and burns, and somehow it still ended up being worse than Crucio, because Draco couldn’t stand how much Grove was
“It’s just that I – I – fuck, Malfoy. Fucking hell. I fucking hate you.” There was pain in the grey eyes, but he still didn’t let go. “Why did you have to ruin everything? Why did you have to break my bloody heart?”
Then they were off and Draco had to take a lot of air in before he could really look.
Draco followed his father out and back into the corridor. He spotted the object that caused the noise straight away – a torch bracket was torn off its place on the wall and was now on the ground. He looked as discreetly as he could around, but saw no other signs of the other two or his mother. He felt Weasley tense beside him and knew he must be thinking the same.
, and he
“It would appear you have. I wonder what on earth could possibly upset the great Potter so.” He gave him a look that made him shiver to his core. “And where is your potions partner?” he asked, making Harry’s eyes widen and a beginning of a gasp to escape his lips. How did he know?
“Hey, don’t worry. I don’t mind. Although it is startling to think of you as an actual human being.”
“It is not difficult, Mr. Draco,” Dobby shook his head. “Dobby can stay unseen. Dobby would be proud to help Harry Potter and – and his friend.” He gave Draco an apprehensive look, and Draco stared at him, amazed.
“I am safe,” Draco shook his head, wiped the tears away quickly. “I am, I am safe.”
“Even if I had an eternity, I could never thank you enough for everything you’ve done for me.” The words were bitter and heavy in his mouth, but Harry’s soft chuckle made it a little better.
“Dobby is working in Hogwarts school now, sir,” the elf replied weakly, and his hands were running over his ears. It seemed like he felt highly uncomfortable to meet his old master.
“All right, everybody, come on. Last push. We need to get it up here right now.”
“You really hate them, don’t you?” Malfoy sounded a little surprised. “I never would have thought the great Harry Potter had it in his heart to hate anyone.”
Draco stared at him incredulously. “Is it?”
Draco laughed. “I honestly can’t. You were way too much of a prat to be my friend when you were younger. Only this year you grew to be somewhat tolerable.”
“Yeah, I… I don’t really know what’s happened last night. I think I was just a little cold, and really tired and it’s just sort of – happened. I didn’t mean anything by it. Please don’t freak out anymore.” He wasn’t sure if he was being entirely honest right now, and there was a dull ache in his stomach that was growing worse and worse, but he really couldn’t say anything else to that panicked face.
The articles said she was struggling financially, and his heart broke reading that. He knew first-hand what it meant to count his knuts. It was even harder to imagine his mother, ever so refined, so well-bred and delicate, having to suffer such indignities. Apparently Potter understood it wrong; the Ministry didn’t allow her to return without seizing the funds, it simply allowed her to return. With no money left, having to fend for herself… Draco felt his heart catching fire, sending lava down his veins. There was nothing he could do for her. As always, nothing; he couldn’t help her, couldn’t save his father, couldn’t… he couldn’t do anything. In his brittle state the wrath was too much to take. Draco placed both arms on the table and pillowed his head on them, trying hard to marshal his breathing.
Alarmed and more than a little uncomfortable, Harry opened his eyes and bolted into a sitting position. Damn, he thought as he looked down at his fully erect cock. Damn, damn, damn.
“Right, those crazy parties you're so well known for.” He seemed thankful for the change of subject. “I remember all the times I never heard of them.”
“Malfoy, there was nothing you could do! You didn’t have a wand, and he’s far too quick anyway!”
“Why aren’t you just using your wand?” Harry asked in surprise when the Slytherin started collecting the books one by one. If it was possible, he became even more red.
Yes, he really was happy.
Dread was already seeped in his bloodstream from the whole night, and it didn’t take too long to ignite. “What is it?”
“Doing what?”
until a hand landed on his shoulder, cold and long fingered and brutal in the amount of pain it caused. “No! don’t touch him! don’t you dare touch him!” Draco did not expect the master to obey. Indeed he did not. Instead, he leaned heavily onto Draco, pushing on the very sensitive torn flesh and eliciting a huge gasp out of his cracked lips.
“Harry…” Draco couldn’t think of a single thing to say that would convey how he felt. All the anger and fear and disappointment he felt, with himself, with them all. All the love and gratitude and warmth that flooded his veins all the time. All the
Potter, who didn’t punish his servant
“Yes, you git, really. Friends?”
“Fine, whatever. I will not try to help you. Now, please…” he pointed towards the wand. Still enraged, the blond took his hand down, stashing his wand back in his pocket. “Just – just bloody eat sometimes, okay? Then these things wouldn’t keep happening.”
. He could smell the other boy’s scent; it was a little lemony and slightly fruity. His mind was so frazzled, he started wondering if he’d taste like that, too. He could feel Malfoy’s deep breaths pulling him in when he inhaled, and pushing him out when he exhaled.
And all this time Harry didn’t say a word, didn’t even come near him, didn’t dare to make a sound. But when Draco, overwhelmed, feeling drunk, fumbled for his hand, he held on tight.
“No, he probably wouldn’t. But it won’t be too far out of reach to suggest he would have her join him. And then she would be with the Dark Lord, as well.” The fear that must have engulfed him was visible on his face. He turned to look at Harry. “I don’t know what they would do to her, Potter. I don’t think they would hurt her right now, but – “ he paused, too horrified to continue. Harry slid down the sofa so he was sitting near him, and put a hand on his arm.
He was in rather high spirits, as were the rest of the students, until the Professor actually started to divide them. She seemed to be picking people at random and assigning them together, and the results were disastrous. For starters, Ron was stuck in a group with Lavender Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil and Dean Thomas; not that they were such a poor bunch, but after everything that’s happened between Ron and Lavender last year, Harry understood why he looked so uncomfortable. Hermione’s luck wasn’t much better: she had Seamus in her group, and Michael Corner who was harmless enough, but also Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini from Slytherin. Nonetheless, Harry was sure he got the worst team: though he was a little cheered up by the presence of Neville, he also had Ernie, who was a little too pompous for his liking, and of course, Malfoy.
Draco shuddered, because he really couldn’t imagine. Potter could get angry? Really angry, angry enough to hurt someone? It was a very disturbing thought. “Obviously you didn’t kill him. He’s still alive.”
“You want to – “ Draco thought he’d fall over with how fast he shot to his feet. “You’re unbelievable, Potter. Didn’t we just talk about your bloody hero complex? You don’t need to fucking help everyone all the time. Live a little, won’t you?”
“It's... amazing. How did you ever get here?”
Enter Potter. Why, why did it have to be him? Were it any other wizard in the country, Draco was certain they wouldn’t have gone through the trouble of coming back. They would see him, get the shock of their lives, and go away. Done deal. Perhaps a week later they would remember it in the shower, and have a thought along the lines of “hey, what was the deal with that Death-Eater bloke I saw the other day?” but nothing beyond that. Trust Draco’s luck that out of the whole bloody world, Potter would be the one to recognize him. And Potter just had to stick his nose in his business, same old same old. And now He was gone, and Draco had nothing, which was very dangerous indeed. He needed something to focus all his anxiety on, or he would become unraveled. Draco did not want to unravel. He wanted to stay raveled, please and thank you. He wanted to stay raveled very, very much.
“‘s fine,” Harry smiled at the blurry face above him. “I feel fine.” He moved his head in Malfoy’s lap again, making him gasp once more and jump a little in his seat. He didn’t know why, but that made him chuckle.
His heart swelled to painful dimensions in his burning chest. Oh, all the gods combined, he missed that face so much. He had no idea how long it's been since he’d last seen Harry – time was immaterial anyway, and could never compare with what he’d been through. It could have been days, and at the very same time it’s been years. None of that mattered now. With Harry here, this was the best and the worst dream ever; the best because he’d give anything, anything to see Harry just one more time, and the worst because the way Harry looked made Draco sick. Puffy, red eyes set in a pale face, his mouth a tight solemn line, seeing him was a blow to his already-ruined stomach. Draco swallowed too much acidic, awful saliva. The pain was still very much there, but he was actually beginning to feel quite numb. Thank Merlin for dreaming. He blinked a few times, unable to do much more, until Harry noticed.
Draco looked down at his body. He sat by Potter’s side, feet on the bed (shoes off, he wasn’t a savage). His hand was clammy where it was clasped in Potter’s. His neck was a little sore with the angle in which he was leaning. His heart beat a crazy jive in his chest and it ached. There was nothing he wanted more than to just stay there forever. There was nothing that could hurt him more. “Yes.”
was a real blow.
“She was probably right,” Malfoy said softly, his eyes still wide and questioning. “You do need to mean them, otherwise you can’t perform any of the Unforgiveable curses. But, Potter, don’t you – “ he considered his words before continuing. “Isn’t Dumbledore teaching you how to use them?”
“Commands?” Potter asked, miserable, and Draco complied.
“Oh, he hears all right,” Grove snickered. “Do you see the way his little throat tightens? How pale he became? And – here, just there, did you catch the way his breath hitched? He hears everything I say, doesn’t he, little poppet?”
Harry sounded very unimpressed. “Well?”
“Shut it,” Harry said tiredly, and suddenly his wand was out and pointing straight at the other boy’s chest. But Malfoy was prepared for this; he drew out his own wand and pointed it back at Harry. “Test me, Malfoy. Please, I am waiting for it. Honestly, I don’t know what else to do with all this… anger inside me.” It was alarming to sense how honest he was about this. Sparks were emitting from the end of his wand and catching the front of the other boy’s robes.
“How – how is she?” he asked carefully. The dread in his belly was alive and kicking.
“I don’t want
An awkward silence stretched between them, and Draco knew he isn’t out of the woods yet. He could see the wheels moving behind Potter’s eyes, and knew he did not satisfy his curiosity one bit. Potter would still want to know more, and he will not leave until Draco gave him
“Yeah, and for a second before they all started talking about it, the fire went green!” Ron agreed animatedly.
By the time Ron and Hermione returned he had already finished his essay for Transfiguration, and started on his moon map for Astronomy. Silently they slunk down on the armchairs next to him and pulled out their own homework. They worked for hours without saying a word, as the room around them grew rowdier, until Harry had to put his pen down in annoyance. Who can even think in such a racket?
This little vampire one-shot was about - you guessed it,
He didn’t think about anything, and he wouldn’t have been able to do it if he tried, but the movement seemed to flow naturally in him. He tightened his grip on both shoulders and just dove forward, landing on Malfoy, and it took a few breathless moments until their lips found each other. Malfoy gasped again, and Harry’s tongue seized the opportunity and slid into his mouth. He didn’t know what he was doing, but it felt so good nevertheless; his tongue was desperate to explore, moving fast inside these new surroundings, and it was so shocking he forgot to breathe. Then Malfoy’s tongue found his and they clashed together, intertwined, moving swiftly and smoothly, and it was so warm and wet and baffling, Harry thought he could do it forever.
He was right. After listing a few defensive spells and making sure everyone in class memorized them, she had the students follow her out into the hallway. “We are going to divide into smaller groups to practice different scenarios. Every group is going to go back inside and face whatever is in there, together. Please note that your group will remain in the same form for the rest of the year; teamwork is something that can be absolutely crucial in times of need.” The way she spoke reminded Harry a little bit of Moody, and he wondered how much of her auror training is coming into light today. Despite himself, he started feeling a little excited. This was, after all, his best subject. And anything he learns here… well, who knows. It might help him in the future.
“Maybe you should be,” he whispered, looking directly into Harry’s eyes. “Maybe you should be very, very concerned.”
“We love you too, mate,” Ron whispered in his ear as Hermione pressed a kiss to his cheek.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m not saying this is a perfect idea. I’m saying this is what I want.” He swallowed the multitude of
Normally, on Saturdays Draco would bring back the earnings of that week and He would do the books. Now that Draco was alone, was he meant to do it himself? That seemed preposterous. Draco knew nothing about money and book-keeping and taxes. He wouldn’t have the first clue what to do with it all. Last night he left the bag of money in the safe at the shop, sure he’d be unable to get it right on his own. But was he meant to try? Gods, this was exhausting. Having to think for himself was something Draco hardly even recognized anymore. He wanted to be told what to do, and to sweep all those uncomfortable thoughts way under the rug where he couldn't reach them. Like he can’t reach the bleach. Oh, this was just getting worse by the minute. He jumped to his feet before he could think a thing more and threw himself in the shower.
“Yes, I’d say we made some tremendous fucking progress.”
The towel was at serious risk of falling off him, Draco was shaking so bad. “P-potter,” he stuttered, the cold now mixing with the fright and making him shiver even more. “What the…” it took every ounce of willpower still in him not to faint on the spot.
“I know you hate me, Weasley. I’ve given you nothing but reason for years, and you too, Granger. Now you finally have the chance to make me pay, and you would have me believe you are not going to take it? Please, just get it over with. Do whatever you want, but do it now. The wait is killing me. I can’t take it any longer.”
“I’m releasing you from your promise. Listen to me, Harry. What I asked you, it was only because I was… I was scared. But I don’t need you to protect me, I have – “ a man who lied to him for years, right, wrong way to go, he had nothing. “Never mind. I regained my sanity and now I’m requesting you to leave. Thank you very much for the healing potion and the – clothes – and now, go. Find Grove and lock him up for good, that would be… that’s the best thing you can do for me. Honestly.”
“Relax, Malfoy. I think you should know by now I’m not going to torture you.”
The worst part was not the pain, after all. The worst part was being there, naked in the dark, eyes closed in a state between a lucid dream and being awake, never sure how and when the monsters will strike. Saying those words, the ones they had him memorize, Grove and Rutgrass and the rest of them. He could still see their leers clearer than the bathroom tiles around him. Draco wished so hard to be able to forget, but He didn’t want that.
to go. It was as far from simple as possible, and to be perfectly frank, Harry had no idea how to feel right now. He just knew that whatever it was that did happen, he sure wasn’t disappointed. Harry followed him, curious, confused, free.
. The buttons were open all the way to his
Harry’s shrug was as casual as ever, but the ache wasn’t so deep now, with this warmth in his chest. “They never do.”
“What about me?” Draco bristled. Potter, sat across from him at the table, twiddled his thumbs nervously.
familiar, because this time he wasn’t imagining it. And that’s how he spotted Pansy.
“Bullshit. Draco, that’s total bullshit, and you know it. You obviously loved your ex, and I think you love me too. You’re just too much of a coward to say it.”
“Nope, I’m really feeling the school-pride vibe this year. It'll be great. A lot of snow for us to play in, probably, too.”
. And he knew, he knew that next time He won’t hesitate. Next time no amount of
“You left,” he whispered, head bowed down and shoulders dropping. “You promised me, Sir.”
“Why do you need to know so bad?” Malfoy asked regardless, giving him a stern look. “Why do you care?”
“Hey, menace, why don’t you tell Aunt Narcissa about that really big dog you’ve seen?” Harry noticed his emotions spiraling, as he always did, and Draco gave him a tired nod of appreciation. Teddy rambled on with much gusto about this big black dog he saw in the park and how its owner let him pet it and throw this big toy around for it to catch. Andromeda tried to engage Draco in a conversation about his plans for the future, but he wasn’t able to concentrate at all, and quickly she gave up.
“Stop being so fucking
“It’s just pretty obvious,” Harry mumbled, scratching the back of his neck. “Look, just – just try to eat something every once in a while, okay? Maybe then I won’t have to bloody rescue you.” He tried a smile, but it wasn’t long lasting.
“This one, Harry,” Neville shouted and pointed at a figure all the way to the left, not too far from where Harry was crouching. “Ernie, you take that one over there, and Malfoy, cover the one in the corner.”
“Yeah, just something that came up today. Do you happen to know if – “ he took a deep breath, and now Draco was
Draco sighed. He knew what guilt and self-laceration felt like, whatever it was Potter thought he was doing. Then again, on second thought, this was nothing like his situation, because Potter didn't deserve this. He was the last person on earth who deserved to be punished. “It won’t help him, you know. You being miserable. It's not what he would have wanted.”
Draco gasped. “That’s an exaggeration. You’re putting words in my mouth, I defintely didn't say that.”
I really want.”
flowers. Anything to do with them, really. The way they looked, all frail and delicate. The way they smelled, so sweet and intoxicating. The way they needed attention, constantly, obsessively, or they just wilted into sad little lumps of saggy petals. Draco thought it was absolutely disgusting. And if it was by any chance because he felt himself like a flower sometimes – trapped in a vase for others to pluck at or admire, out of his control, always in desperate need – he tried not to dwell on it. He stayed in the shop because there was really no choice but to, and he left it every night shivering with hatred.
“Sure, anything. What is it?” Damn that man. He never even hesitated. Who does that, agrees to a favor without even thinking twice? Before even knowing what it was? Who was that good? And that stupid?
“If you want to,” Harry murmured, placing a sneaky kiss on the top of his head. “And… Draco, if you feel like you need to punish yourself, or, reassurance, or something… will you tell me that, too? Please? Or if not me, then at least Dr. Radford? Pansy? Someone?”
. He didn’t even care for the deliciously sweet scent that spread in the whole room, or the incredible mess Potter left on the counter. It was Potter – the green eyes sparkling with joy, the lighthearted smile plastered on his face, and Draco was smitten. Every single inch of his body quivered in dismay – he can’t, he can’t, he can’t – but it was too late. He was a goner, and damn it to high hell, Potter was beautiful. He’d never seen anything quite so lovely in his life.
“Right,” Potter got to his feet too. Draco caught a glimpse of his watch – it wasn’t even seven yet. He cleared his throat. “Do you want me to take you back to your place? I can probably apparate us there, if you don’t have any wards up.”
“Just so I’m sure I got this right,” Potter asked, and Draco wasn’t brave enough to look at his face so he trained his eyes on his knees, “are you having some sort of fit because – because of
“Of course I would. Draco, I love you. I would do anything for you.”
“A potions proverb?”
“What do you mean, you were special? How would they know?”
“I’m not pretending – “
Surprisingly enough, the shadow complied. Draco watched the image of the man he could never get out of his head stretch luxuriously on the grass, and something inside him hurt. He looked at the flowers again, eyes lingering on their brightness, on how vivid they were. How real.
“I need to ask you something. I know you’re in shock, I know it’s – I know all of it is a lot, all right? But we have to talk about it before your boyfriend comes back. It’s about… the connection between you two.”
“Yes. It’s got to be me. Since I was the one who interrogated him – “
“I’m sure you can make it up to him later.” Harry was so shocked to hear
Harry wasn’t able to swallow anymore due to a huge lump in his throat. He looked at the blond, who was staring out the window vacantly, and thought hard. It made sense, after all; Harry would have to learn how to use the killing curse in order to defeat Voldemort. Because he would have to kill him in the end; that was his destiny, was it not? He will have no choice, at some point in his life, but to stand in front of him and face him for good. If he can’t kill him, doesn’t it mean he will have to die? A cold shiver ran down his spine.
“Were those – some of your worst memories, then? When you saw me getting hurt? Did it really affect you so much back then?”
and we walk. You could kiss any other chance goodbye after that, so you want to be playing by
“But why?”
“Harry – what the fuck is going on? Why didn’t you come on Monday? And why have you been ignoring me all week?” he walked forwards with trepidation, stopping himself a few feet from him. “Is everything all right?”
“You should have heard him,” his father’s cold voice joined, and now Draco could see him too. They brought him to the corner of the room, furthest away from the crowd that gathered close to the fire, perhaps for inspection before presenting him to their Lord. Draco tried to scoff at them, to say something brave and stupid like Harry would, but his tongue simply would not listen to him. “He is cocky all right. Seemed to think he was quite the fighter. Almost as if he’s not aware he’s just a sad little boy.”
“Cool.” The silence was a bit too heavy for his liking. “Are you, er, going to tell me what it is?”
“You know what I want to talk about. I want to know who attacked you. And I want to know why.”
was the source of this wizardry. And it was so small, it could fit in his pocket! Muggles would never cease to amaze him. Potter grinned and offered him his free hand, which Draco took, then sat down next to him on the bed.
“Keep telling yourself that, but don’t forget, I know the real you. The one you’re too ashamed to let show now, what you really are inside. Only I know what you truly deserve. How sorry you should be. Do you not remember, Draco, how you begged them to train you? How you followed me, without question, without ever opening your eyes?”
“Malfoy,” Harry began to say, even though he wasn’t sure it’s a good idea. “Your father knows you were given a task. But if he knew you're being threatened, wouldn’t he try to help you? Do you think we should reach out to him and… ask for his help?” he couldn’t believe the way he sounded; almost like he was pleading. Malfoy snorted again.
Then a huge crash rendered him temporarily deaf and for some reason Harry grabbed him and threw the both of them on the floor, with Harry basically covering Draco with his body.
“Yes,” Draco brightened, face breaking into a smile. “Yes, good idea.” He wanted nothing more than for Potter to leave and never, ever return. There was some value in the stupid git’s life, and Draco would hate it if something were to happen to Potter because of him.
“Yeah, right after the war ended I spent a few months at the Burrow. Ginny and I were still together, and Ron and Hermione were there too, so it kind of made sense. We all had this… I didn’t want to go too far away, you know? There was so much darkness everywhere still.”
because that, after all, was what Lucius was. His father. The first man he ever loved.
"Yes, Harry, damn you. Yes."
“Harry Potter does not know where Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy is?” Dobby turned his eyes from Harry to Draco, as the latter shook his head. He seemed deflated again, like a monster truck just ran him over and left him flattened in the mud. “But – but Dobby can tell you where to find them, Harry Potter, sir.”
“Oh?” tension coiled in his gut like a snake. Potter looked terribly unhappy, so it couldn’t have been anything good.
The Slytherin still wasn’t looking at him. “He cannot guarantee my safety, Harry. No one can - once the Dark Lord hears of my betrayal, he will want to kill me in person. No one can survive once he decides to kill them. Well, no one but you.” His colorless cheeks became a touch pink.
eyes that were giving him a stomachache) and he felt seeped up to his eyeballs in pity. There was only so much even he could take, so when she laid the parchment next to him on the table where he and Weasley were about to finish a game, he decided enough was enough.
“Shut up, Malfoy. I just wanted to talk.”
“Don’t get too upset about it, Ronnie. He’s new. He’ll learn.” Grove’s raspy voice had a special effect on Draco; it didn’t even matter what he was saying, the result was always the same. It felt like his insides were trying to squirm out every hole in him, while his outside was trying to crawl in, and in the mess Draco often lost his head. It was fairly distracting. Draco spent many an hour of solitary debating over the age old question, did he hate Grove more than he feared him, or vice versa. Just like the dragon and the egg, though, the question was useless. The answer even more so. In the meantime Grove came right near him, and his breath was vile on Draco’s face as he bent down.
Harry shook his head, though he had a feeling he already admitted that to him. “Have you ever…?” his cheeks were burning and he found he’s unable to complete the question.
“I never lied about that either,” Draco found himself begging the carpet. “Harry, I never lied about how… I never lied about that.”
“Thank you, Fenrir. Now if you’d be so kind as to allow my son to breathe once more, I’d be grateful.” Her voice turned icy cold when she spoke to him. Greyback raised his eyebrows a little, but his hold on the boy’s neck loosened and Malfoy took a big gulping breath.
“Fuck me,” Draco repeated, pulling his head back so he can look him in the eyes. “Please.”
“Bells?” Harry asked, confused. Draco glimpsed at him.
Unbidden tears flooded his eyes, and he closed them shut. “About ten years older, yes.” He took a shuddery breath. “I’m sorry, it’s all been quite recent. I’ve not really had time to – adjust.”
