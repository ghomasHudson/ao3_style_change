"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's yours?"
"Dammit!" Draco let out, he wasn't the only one- most of his house let out groans of disappointment along with his friends. Huffing, he shoved the binoculars towards Goyle with a sour expression.
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork- bread, English muffins, marshmallows- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.
Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off."
"See you later, then," said Harry.
"Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. "Oh no oh no- I've just remembered- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."
"Shut up!" Harry whispered.
"Sorry, Professor."
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our fault he's here in the first place."
Harry battles with the demons of his childhood.
"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly.
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.
"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains- it's a kid- he's runnin' back up ter the school."
"So we were right, it is the Philosopher's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy- and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus Pocus- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through-..."
"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?" asked Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. Harry couldn't really blame him, though.
"Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must."
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:
"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
"-It's unfair that he has his own anyway when he's a first year like us-
-Parvati and Padma Patil's names have changed to be more culturally appropriate.
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry- he couldn't move for fear. He distantly heard shouts of "Potter!" and "Run!", but then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.
The next morning, the great hall was abuzz with excitement and chatter about the game that was taking place later that day. Draco sat with Crabble at the Slytherin table just a little way away from their houses Quidditch team; they were surrounded by other students who were wishing them luck while other students were taking bets on who the bludgers would hit first, who would score first, and how long it would take for Potter to fall off his broom. Draco had warned Higgs about what he had seen the night before, but the seeker had told him that he 'wasn't going to be bested by some Gryffindor kid'.
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
"He's doing something- jinxing the broom!" said Hermione.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. "You are safe now."
"How's your arm?" said Harry.
"What's the matter?"
"Never mind that!.. pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
"In here."
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.
"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. "The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times."
"Fifty?" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match.
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
That was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch...
"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough poking around."
. Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.
"I can't," said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd die."
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.
"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Ishita Rumman.
"That's why yer late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. "Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'S'not your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here."
"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell-"
"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?"
"It's here- just here- yes!"
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret, that is."
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.
Let me know what you think of the new character I added- ;)
"No."
I'm so sorry it took so long to post such a short thing. I've had serious writer's block this past week and I have also been very nervous and anxious about posting some of my own writing since I never have before but i'm happy at how this turned out!
"Vincent's right- Hooch is favourin' the Gryffindors. That or she don't know how to do her job."
"Professor- please
Draco could feel his heart in his throat, he dared not look away from the game, He had never been to a Quidditch match before- at least not from what he could remember- so this was a thrilling experience for him.
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.
Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.
But Wood turned out to be a person, a handsome burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused.
"But this isn't football, Dean," Ron reminded him.
"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.
On the morning of their second week, the first-year Gryffindors spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday.
The three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Yule decorations.
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.
"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced.
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you."
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.
After Hermione had properly bandaged Ron's hand, the three of them put their heads together to read the note.
"So," He continued, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised."
"Yes?" Harry cut in eagerly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here- I've told yeh- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
"-tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on"'
"Look at me!" he exclaimed joyfully.
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavour Beans. "If that's what I think it is- they're really rare, and really valuable."
"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot- jus' playin'- he's only a baby, after all."
Before Madame Hooch finished, Neville- who was nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had even touched Madam Hooch's lips.
"Are you all right?" asked the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.
"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."
." Pansy spoke after a while of watching.
"Stay there!" she exclaimed, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.
"Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it."
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?"
"Next to the tall kid with the red hair."
"Slytherin in possession," He was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the- wait a moment- was that the Snitch?"
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.
They didn't tell him much but He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.
Charlie wasn't what Harry had expected at all, and his friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with them all and thanked them very much.
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy. "Students aren't supposed to know about the Philosopher's Stone, after all."
"Another Weasley, eh?" chuckled Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."
"I- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't."
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the-- wait a moment-- was that the Snitch?!"
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief; He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.
"Well, that's something," Harry muttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we have a window open? I'm boiling."
"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.
Harry stared at him.
Draco whipped his head around to look at her.
"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey," said Hagrid in a muffled voice. "An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely."
It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" mocked Pansy Parkinson, who had short jet black hair that fell just below her chin, steely grey eyes, and a small amount of freckles that dotted over her nose. Silver snakes with a green gemstone for eyes were dangling from her earlobes which harry thought was quite inappropriate to be wearing for a quidditch lesson. "Never thought you'd like fat little cry-babies, Rumman."
“’S fine, wasn’t getting a good sleep anyway.” Draco can hear Harry yawn and he can’t help but smile at the thought of how adorable Harry must look now, messy bed hair and all.
The man smiled slightly at Draco, a genuine smile this time and not the grin from before. Draco took a deep breath and pulled the trigger. He didn’t flinch as the wall turned red and the body of the man thudded to the floor in a pool of his own blood, a small smile still left on his lips.
Draco reluctantly laid his arm down on the table but kept his hand and index finger tightly on the gun. “Well?” Draco leant forward, “What do you have to tell me?”
“Wow you’re really going all in on me today, thought I was the one who over-analyses everything?” Ron chuckled and Harry grinned briefly, something which Ron hadn’t seen him do in ages. Whoever this ‘Draco’ guy was Ron would happily keep him around if he made it easier for Harry to smile.
Once again it could just be a coincidence, but unlike Lucius, Draco was not arrogant enough to think that people won’t be able to figure out who his family are and to track them down. Running through options in his head Draco settles on tracking the caller from the landline. Even though he didn’t have the knowledge or expertise to track an unknown caller he did have a family friend who worked at the police station and could most likely track the call in a matter of minutes. Although it was somewhat of a risk getting an outsider in on what could potentially turn out to be an assassination Draco had a sufficient amount of dirt on Blaise Zabini to make his life significantly more complicated if the occasion called for it.
When Draco is out of sight of the apartment block he leans against a wall to stare up at the cool evening sky. The light wind brushes over him, as though it were clearing him of his sins. He removes his latex gloves and shoves them in his suit pocket, before sending a simple text to Harry.
“No one is entirely innocent Harry, but I do believe in justice.” Draco looks directly into Harry’s eyes and Harry sees a flash of danger in the serene grey. It’s exhilarating.
Can we also appreciate that chapters 3, 4 and 5 were all originally one giant chapter but I've had to split them all up oh my god this fic will be the death of me but I love it anyway! I hope whoever's reading this mess is enjoying it and please comment and kudos and all that jazz!
“I work in crime analysis.” It’s technically true, Harry just won’t mention the level at which he works. For all Draco knows Harry works for Scotland Yard and not the NCA, and for now it’ll stay that way. He notices Draco tense up slightly but he relaxes again almost instantly. Harry frowns slightly but ultimately decides it isn’t anything important. Most people are at least a little bit uncomfortable around members of law enforcement, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they have done anything incriminating. Instead of fixating on the momentary lapse in Draco’s body language Harry focuses instead on trying to convince Draco that he is in fact somewhat interesting. “Is my answer to your satisfaction?”
“Do you mind me asking a question?” Hermione hesitantly acts after a moment of silence.
“She certainly wouldn’t. Can you do it?”
“Don’t call him a bo-“ Draco is cut off by Bellatrix placing her knife against his lips.
“Can I ask him a question?” Draco quietly asked Voldemort who nodded, leaning back against the wall to watch the scene unfold. Turning back to the man Draco asked, “Why did you wait until now? You’ve known all these years why did you only phone now?” The man slowly walked over to the fridge and Draco kept the gun pointed at him as he pulled a sheet of paper off and walked over to Draco. He held it up for Draco to read, and Draco squinted at the messy scrawl before his heart sank in realisation.
“Parseltongue.” Draco hoped to God that was correct otherwise he’d be in a lot of shit. Thankfully he was, and before he knew it the low voice of Voldemort was sending shivers up his spine.
“So stubborn, nothing like your spineless Father,” Bellatrix strokes Draco’s hair, “Just think how much more you could accomplish if you just let yourself give in, Draco.”
“Why weren’t you getting a good sleep?” The thought of anything eating away at Harry and causing him to feel uncomfortable genuinely hurts Draco; he’s never cared this much about someone else’s wellbeing.
“Good,” Ginny leans against the door frame and flashes a smile at Hermione, “Hey Hermione. I’ll let you get going then, remember to text Ron that you’re home, Harry. He spends half his time stressing over your lack of sleep, at this rate he’s making Mum look like the most relaxed person on the planet.”
“Thank you.” Draco’s voice is small and sincere, nothing like the cocky tone Harry has come to associate with the man. The pair smile at each other softly; nothing more needs to be said.
“Yeah, I arrived early to get us a table, but looking around it was entirely unnecessary.” Harry nodded in agreement as he looked around the almost empty coffee shop. The two men sit in silence for a few minutes until a waitress comes over and takes their orders. Harry wonders if the fact that Draco takes his coffee black and Harry takes his with extra milk and sugar says anything about their personalities, but that just sounds too much like a stupid online quiz. After the waitress leaves Harry looks at Draco once more and finds the blonde scanning over Harry’s face with his eyes, almost like he was dissecting every part of Harry’s psyche just from his appearance. Harry is usually on the giving end of the analytical look so to find himself being the one under scrutiny makes his stomach twist uncomfortably and he makes a mental note to stop analysing people so often if this is how strange it makes them feel.
After he replies to Harry’s message Draco gets up from his sitting position on the floor to wander over to the piano and sit before it. He lightly brushed his pale fingers along the even paler keys, pressing absentmindedly at random which brought about soft echos around the dark room. The sun set long ago but the moonlight is enough to make the keys shine in an almost ghostly manner. Punctuated by the notes, the air held a heavy silence, and Draco contemplated opening a window so he could breathe easier.
to feel you.”
Harry didn’t answer, instead hiding his mouth behind his own mug. They stayed silent for quite a while, before Harry sighed and his eyes finally met Draco’s. They were heavy, darker than Draco had ever seen. “Why did you do it?”
Caipora raised a thick eyebrow. “And if you can’t?”
The Headteacher turned to them, lips tight with the effort she was making. “Hold the shield,” she requested.
Informal. Circumstance in which there is a mess, scandals.
“No one! Who… What? No one else was with me, just—” O
His friend shrugged with what he still had of his body. “Sacis only live seventy-seven years. And then, we become a mushroom.”
Draco was not one to give up. He would not take the coward’s way out, not when he was trying to do the right thing. That wasn’t about to change, even if those creatures couldn’t see it.
Samba schools are composed of different neighborhood representatives, each of them coming from tiny towns or ‘favelas.’ The schools have two practical purposes: they emphasize the importance of the Brazilian culture to the world, and provide local members with lucrative employment opportunities."
Draco
They did. Draco drew his wand, chanting in an indistinct murmur. At the same time, Francisca used her own wandless magic to cover them in a soft hum of protection.
“I swear to God, Potter if you…” Draco started looking around, and his eyes soon caught sight of a dark mass slumped close to them. “There!”
will come out, and it will want you.”
A hopeful smile tugged Draco’s lips, as he watched Harry’s eyes turn from night black to his usual green at Berenice’s soft words. Black tears still cascaded out of them, marring his skin, but his eyes were alive.
Potter snorted, shaking his head. “I think it’s a bit late for that, or you won’t be able to sleep. I meant something… maybe something alcoholic.”
someone so deeply it became part of him. This feeling never left him. And after some time, it didn’t even hurt anymore not to be near Harry while loving him.
They were resting on the grass, a large kapok tree serving as shelter from the sun, a pile of books mounted by their side. Despite having spent most of the morning trying to find anything new about the magical version of guarana or the mysterious mushroom that Draco was convinced was the last ingredient used in the Moriaetem Potion, the pile was now abandoned.
Draco didn’t look at his wrists. They still stung, but he’d deal with them later.
He couldn’t shake the feeling that everybody knew where Potter was and they had chosen not to tell him, even Teddy and Andromeda.
Harry’s fingers tightened around his skin, and Draco couldn’t contain the low, pained groan that escaped his lips. Harry didn’t even seem to notice.
“Liked someone?” Draco gulped around the lump in his throat. It was not jealousy. Just an annoyance. Potter could like whomever he pleased. It was none of Draco’s business.
“I’m not saying he wasn’t the target, in fact the only thing I am actually certain about is that Cresswell is the target. What I am saying is that this wasn’t necessarily done by a gang, not a local one anyway. It just doesn’t add up, and how would they know which of his properties exist on other estates? They timed it perfectly and like you said it would be a pretty big coincidence. So it's probably not a coincidence, meaning this was planned and those who were involved knew who they were targeting. This is a lot bigger than just some gang violence, and the fact that they managed to avoid being detected shows just how efficient whoever organised this is. Now I’m not saying local gangs can’t be effective and organised but they’d have to be communicating with other gangs from other communities, and I just don’t think this was them.”
Draco’s sobs had continued when he opened his eyes to look at Midnight, a dog he’d only had for a few hours but was the closest thing he had to a companion. The dog had looked confused at the distress Draco was in but still was sat looking at him with bright, wide eyes and its tongue hanging out. To this day Draco still doesn’t know exactly why he gave in to his father’s taunts. If this were to happen now he would have taken the puppy and left the family, but as a child he’d wanted nothing more than for his father to love him like a father should do. So the eight year old boy with the peroxide blonde hair and tears streaming down his porcelain cheeks had clenched his eyes tightly shut, and pulled the trigger.
-The book starts from when Harry gets his letter because I find the start of the book boring-
"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"
Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.
"Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.
Harry stood up.
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section."
"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?"
"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain, are there?" asked Harry.
"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen... They must show that Voldemort's coming back... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me... I suppose that's written in the stars as well."
"Well, I've bin doin' some readin'" Hagrid said, pulling a large book from under his pillow. "Got this outta the library- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An' see here- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're rare, them."
"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?"
"It’s alright.... Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy- it's all right, up you get.".
"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry with a small chortle, "we were on the team last year."
"I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry."
"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Philosopher's St-"
"Don't push me-!"
"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared." Harry replied, sarcasm lacing his tone.
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week- why did Snape hate him so much?
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.
"Look-" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
"Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry-!"
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.
“I would like to have not spoken to my parents since I was seventeen,” Draco says, “we weren’t exactly close either, so I understand what its like to feel like an outsider in your own home.”
“Come outside, Draco,” Lucius voice cut through the laughter and barking that made the usually soundless room seem so full of life, “And bring your dog.” Draco had nodded obediently, even though his father had been in a seemingly kind mood Draco didn’t want to push him too far. He had picked up the excited puppy who excitedly licked at his face, but Draco hadn’t been able to smile because of the uncertain feeling in his gut. As he followed his father through the hallways and out of the main entrance he quickly glanced up at Lucius and had tried to decipher his expression, yet Lucius had been unreadable.
In that moment, staring at a picture of a man who’s life Draco just snatched away, Draco feels closer to his father than ever before. Lucius’ emotional distance wasn’t confined to his relationship with Draco, Lucius Malfoy had been completely disconnected from everything in his life. Memories of Christmases past where a young Draco would excitedly open presents with his Mother in front of the grand fireplace are plagued by an absence of his Father. At the grand dinner parties his parents would host his Mother and Father were only identifiable as a couple by their matching silver wedding bands, take those away and they could have easily been complete strangers. If Lucius could barely even tolerate a connection with his own wife and son, then how could he have possibly held any emotional regard for those he killed?
Draco stumbles backwards, his nose bleeding rapidly after being hit by his opponent. The man in question; 6’4 and built like a brick wall. Most targets aren’t too hard to take down, usually they’re  politicians, hackers, or ?, not typically difficult to take on in a fight. But this target, a certain drug lord named ‘Mulciber’, had been blocking every fatal blow and had only sustained a few cuts to the face. Draco, on the other hand, was beginning to feel the ache of the fight. His attacks were less precise, and his head was beginning to spin.
“I agree. This case is like nothing I’ve seen before. There is no way this is all done by one person but one thing I do know is that everyone involved has psychopathic tendencies to some extent. Did you get that feeling from my notes or did you see signs of anything else?”
“Hey Ginny, Ron send you?” Harry smiles warmly at the redhead and turns to his desk to pack away his work. “I’m leaving now anyway, Hermione and I were just discussing a case.”
The sound of a woodpigeon screeching at the top of its little lungs arguably isn’t the best sound to wake up to, but nevertheless it's the noise that drags Draco out of his slumber at around nine in the morning. The sun is shining on the grounds making them look like something straight out of Jane Eyre, and for a brief moment Draco completely forgets about the events of the previous night. However, the peace doesn’t last long and before Draco knows it the computerised voice is sounding in his head once more, repeating the same combination of numbers from the previous night over and over as if on a loop. The frustration of being utterly unaware of where he has heard the numbers before eats away at his gut whilst he sits alone at the head of the dining table and looks at the empty chairs surrounding him. As the day progresses, Draco finds himself growing increasingly agitated as the numbers relentlessly throb in his mind, like a headache he can’t get rid of. Even texting Harry doesn’t cease the dull ache, but he realises that it would be out of the question to ask Harry for his advice in case the numbers link to something which could damage their relationship, or whatever their current status is. Hopefully that issue would be addressed when they get coffee tomorrow, resolving at least one of the disconcerting troubles within his mind.
“In the kitchen, down the hall.” Draco’s voice was surprisingly calm for someone so anxious. Voldemort didn’t speak as he walked into the house, merely signalling to the Death Eaters with him to stay outside. Draco couldn’t quite make out their faces in their darkness and didn’t particularly feel comfortable walking up to them and making conversation so he turned  back inside and followed Voldemort down the hall to the kitchen.
“Neither have you, nor are you going to start any time soon with the amount of caffeine you’re drinking.” Harry snaps, instantly regretting it when Draco’s eyes narrow. However the annoyed look fades quickly and is replaced with Draco’s trademark mask of indifference.
The line goes dead and Draco is left with a high pitched beep to tell him the caller is no longer available, and he puts the phone down slowly. A sense of foreboding replaces his anger and the sense that he is being watched returns. He practically runs up the stairs to his room like he did when he was a child and thought that monsters were chasing him wherever he went. As he lies in the cold bed looking up at the bare ceiling he thinks over the phone call. The numbers resonated with him for some unknown reason and he can’t help but feel like they have significance he doesn’t yet understand, not at one AM anyway. Draco closes his eyes in an attempt to calm himself yet the computer generated numbers keep playing over and over again in his mind. He groans and rubs his face out of frustration; turning on his side to stare out of the circular window at the manor’s overgrown grounds. The moon is full and bright which in turn causes the trees to cast eerie shadows across Draco’s room, and the wind causes the nearby branches to tap at his window like fingernails. Draco’s arms are covered in goosebumps as he tries to calm the unsettled feeling in his stomach. Yet this is a hard thing to do when you’re essentially living in a large, empty manor all on your own. Yes his parents are only a corridor away but they’re not in the position to keep him company. Draco feels completely isolated and, for the first time in years, scared.
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all."
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
"Of course I'm not, I'm in."
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he was doing it wrong.
"It- well... it shows me my family-"
"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family."
"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy-"
"I am- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup! I'm Quidditch captain, too!"
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside- and a horrible scene met his eyes.
He could deal with the Saviour of Bloody Everything. As long as Draco kept in mind this was the man—the
sorry,” Draco heard, as Potter’s calloused fingers cupped his cheeks. His voice sounded frail, too weak to relate it to the man Draco knew, his magic frantic and wild. Potter added, in a whisper, “This happens sometimes.”
It was easy. Draco could say no to evil, he… he hadn’t been able to do that in the past, but he had changed. He was good now; he
Taboo. Group sexual intercourse; orgy.
Her eyes beamed with excitement since Potter first brought up the creature earlier that day. Caipora, as Francisca had explained, was one of the native creatures that lived in the rainforest. Brazilian people believed these beings were nothing but myths, figments of the imagination. However, not only were they very real, but a vital part of the school. Caiporas, specifically, were protectors of the forest,
That was the night when Draco caught a glance of something red in the woods.
She shrugged again. “I don’t like being trapped here.”
it. And he would always belong, because that place had claimed him as one of their own—even if it had taken an obscenely long time.
Taking a deep breath, the words finally came out, slow and sorrowful even to his own ears. They were true, though. “I don’t know if I trust you not to break my heart again.” His voice was almost too weak to be heard.
“There's no point in my staying here, if your school is going to prevent me from reading anything useful.” Draco got up from the root they had settled on. “And I happen to be famished. You know I can’t think on an empty stomach.”
But one glance at Harry and Draco
Not so much to forgive.
Francisca chuckled, “I have never met someone who bonded and didn’t
The bright golden building beamed in front of them. Like a pyramid, the monumental structure raised from a rectangular base in even spaced steps, truncated to form a platform on the top that towered into the sky as if it intended to reach the gods.
“It was long ago, when two Indigenous people wished to have children,” she started, slowed by translating the text. Draco remained silent and patient. “They asked Tupã to make it possible. He’s the god that created the universe and light, and he lives in the sun. The sun is Guaraci, who gave the school and all Indigenous people fire and magic. You can call it Fire of Guaraci too, the one in front of the school.” Tainara glanced at him again and seemed satisfied to see Draco’s attentive expression. Draco didn’t want to call the fucking fire anything, really, but he didn’t point that out.
Potter smiled fondly at the girl and turned to Draco. “Tai is always here, just not… as a formal student.”
Convincing Martin that he was perfectly fine all the time, even when he just wanted to break a few things, had become somewhat tiring after a few years. It was easier to control his moods when he had no one else to please.
, but Draco couldn’t have it. He couldn’t. Draco didn’t deserve to feel that way, so at peace. Like he belonged.
Draco snorted inelegantly, his laughter merged with the long, distant screeches of the shadow creatures. Shaking his head, he walked away from Berenice and her feeble protection. “Get the fuck away from me.”
“Well, I’m
There was a startling variety of trees saluting him, towering into the sky in many heights, lengths, and hues of brown; some with trunks thinner than his waist, others so thick his arms wouldn’t fit around them.
Draco kept muttering to himself all throughout his trudge, kind of wishing Potter was there to hear what exactly he thought about him—even though he knew it was much more from his exhaustion and rage than truthfulness. Listening to his own voice, and concentrating on the one good English accent he heard these days, was the only thing he could do not to fall on Curupira’s traps, as the surrounding noises—crickets, growling beasts, the bloody deafening leaves brushing against each other—only grew louder.
Harry’s arm came around his shoulders, pulling Draco even closer. The hammock rocked gently from one side to the other, in the same rhythm of the night’s chanting: the low humming of the birds, their breaths mingling, Draco’s heartbeat slowing to a rate synchronised with Harry’s.
Draco repeated in a murmur, “What have you done, Tainara?”
A dry laugh escaped Draco’s lips, even as tears streamed down his face. “It’s okay. It’ll heal,” he whispered, lips locking with Harry’s; then Harry’s cheeks, his eyelids, his nose. “Better than breaking my heart a third time.”
“I thought you said you would not help,” Draco growled, trying to command his stomach to stop turning around all the food he had eaten earlier that day.
That's right (agreement).
Draco had thought when grey eyes met green. And he proved himself right when he awoke alone to cold, deserted sheets, never to be filled again by that heat.
“Potter, wait. I’m not hurt, it’s just—”
There was a hum of powerful magic around her. Draco assumed it had to come from the shielded greenhouse behind her, rather than the woman herself.

Draco wasn’t sure how he’d get up that morning, only that he’d find a way to stay in Castelobruxo, to work on his potion. He had come too far now to yield, and he’d be damned if he didn’t convince the forest, Pansy, Mother,

Person with the same name as someone else, “my uncle is my xará.”
He changed a lot. It wouldn’t be fair to say that he didn’t. Draco improved himself and learnt how to keep his mouth shut and his features schooled into something cool and distant, when all he wanted was to grab something—
It was a second before Potter burst inside wearing nothing but joggers, slamming the door against the wall. “What happened?!”
So, after having told Tainara what happened, and having planned everything out, she had left Draco at the edge of the forest, promising to keep Harry thinking Draco was deep in reading, like she had done the day he had met Rudá. Draco didn’t dwell on that and how she knew where he had gone, instead focusing on the task at hand.
Draco frowned at him. This man was… worried about their presence disturbing the animals. This man went out of his way to make it easier for others to be around him. Draco was secretly happy
Draco was sore at the edges, limbs complaining at every movement after he came back from a trek along the forest because Potter’d had ‘a few errands to run that day’ and Draco was invited to come with. He hadn’t considered those ‘errands’ meant checking the woods for hunter traps, the safety of the animals and a lot of plant hunting. Walking in the forest in his fashionable boots, following the Boy Hero Extraordinaire around proved to be a strenuous task—and why the bloody fuck was Draco wearing boots in Brazil, anyway?

He would have got the fuck away if another hand hadn’t grabbed his wrist. “Draco, we didn’t know!” Francisca said, making him turn to face her. “We didn’t know it was Tainara.”
“You don’t underrrstand anything about our magic, Drrragon Boy,” Caipora said, and it didn’t sound like she was coming to his rescue, she just sounded judgmental. “You think yourr magic worrrk herre, it don’t. You think things you do in yourr countrry worrk herre, they don’t. You listen to us now. If you free the night,

Harry’s eyes were even darker than before. Long, black veins slithered across his face as if the shadows were bleeding out of him, as if he couldn’t hold it all inside. It was pouring out, a mass of powerful, dark energy surrounding Harry—surrounding Harry
“There’s absolutely no way I’m trying this barbaric thing again.” He shoved a piece of
“I’m so mad with ye.” Saci bounced on his leg, from one side to the other, but didn’t step forward.
“He can’t.” Draco shook his head. “He’s hurting, and I won’t let it consume him. We will get it out of him and then trap it.”
Draco murmured, “What would happen if we managed to get Jurupari out of Harry?” His body was stiff and his eyes never left Tainara and the crescent cloud of dark matter around her.
Draco identified the lie, even before he felt Harry’s magic coming to life around them, rippling in the walls, dark and suppressing. Draco knew it, because of Harry’s eyes. The once light green orbs swimming in a sea of light were now almost entirely black, all white gone from them.
“The fire
They turned to her, and the sight made a shiver run down Draco’s spine. The girl had an arm raised, and mimicking her posture, was Harry just below, feet rooted to the ground by the same dark veins that came out of his eyes and were trying to consume his whole body. From his fingers Harry dispelled a sombre energy Draco was sure could hurt whoever it came in contact with. But the magic flowed slowly, like the stream of a calm river, instead of with the charge of Tainara’s rage for not having all the attention on her.
The belief that it was a mistake, all of this,
means “body”, resulting in “boy’s body”
It felt as if no time had passed at all. It had, but Draco was not thinking about that.
It wasn’t hot anymore.
Too much to have Harry staring at him like that, like he truly wanted Draco, like Harry had not been the one that had left seven years ago. Like he hadn’t shattered Draco’s heart into a million pieces when he vanished, taking from Draco the only thing that made him resemble something whole after the war had broken him.
Potter
“Oh, speak of the devil.” Her smile turned softer when they both caught sight of Harry walking towards them. Harry was wearing a beige shirt adorned with indigenous patterns, a colourful fabric armlet on his upper arms, and sandals. His eyes had gained a golden gleam in that magical light, and Draco found he couldn’t look away.

it, as Potter had taught him, but the usually deafening noise that a substantial amount of water made when descending into nothing was muffled and distant.
before he stared at the mass of a guilty and depressed man hanging onto him. “Merlin’s sake, Potter, forget it already,” Draco snapped, only because it seemed easier than to let them go down that road. It was too late for that now, it didn’t matter anymore who had hurt who. They had both changed, and they were both trying to be better. This was true for Draco, and he hoped it was true for Potter.
“Oh, you met Tai?”
His grin grew brighter. “I’m the exception to stupider rules, haven’t you heard?”
Tons of small cabins of the same height and shape stretched near the line of trees. They were the dormitories. “Four or five students each. And there,” Potter said, pointing at some slightly bigger houses assembled near to the student’s housing. “That's where the teachers and staff live.”
He pulled out the pocket watch, glancing at the numbers on display. The watch read half-past seven now, which meant half-past three where he currently was, and three hours since he had first started checking the time.
Draco wasn’t someone to give up that easily. He had, indeed, been through worse and got out of it. He could do that again.
, please, tell me what I can do to be accepted by Cast… Homunin.” He caught himself at the last minute, presuming she’d be happier if he used the original name of the school.
The breads Potter offered had been truly delicious—some sweeter, some saltier, but none like what he was used to—and went perfectly with jam from a fruit called guava that Potter made him try.
Draco couldn’t figure out what it was before the blinding gleam of the golden stones of the main building of Castelobruxo claimed his attention. It was an exuberant structure, but he noticed its beauty was more prominent from afar, rather than from the oppressing closeness in which he found himself now.
him because they were just so alike. The only thing Draco ever saw in Harry’s eyes was himself mirrored back, and he was sure that was all Harry saw when he stared at him.
“Victoria Amazonica,” Harry said, sliding his hand to Draco’s waist. “Or
Draco saw it, unfortunately.
Being deep in the forest had made the buzz of the students diminish to nothing miles before, and the only things Draco heard now were the leaves brushing, cries of the birds and monkeys, the crawl of smaller creatures and growls of the bigger. The macaw, at one point, had given up making Draco follow him as if he was as lost as Draco, and rested calmly on his shoulder as he usually did when wishing to be petted. Draco raked a hand on its head once more, before his brain started fully rationalising the deranged sight his eyes caught.
miss him, no matter what Draco’s opinionated heart believed, whenever Martin had to leave the city and their bed was too cold for a single person.
Tainara, despite Berenice's willingness to banish her, had been stripped of her powers and sentenced to live with the magical creatures of the rainforest, learning from them, hopefully growing. Harry and Draco didn't believe isolation would change the girl, it was what had made her so resentful in the first place.
“Potter, I’m in no rush to die before reaching Castelobruxo. I don’t know where you got the idea that you’re a perfectly capable driver, but I can assure you if I die like this, without finishing my research, I will come back and I will haunt you until
Harry still had a couple of smaller tattoos scattered around his body; the anchor on his thigh, a palm tree on his calf, and a snake on his hip. Draco worshipped each of them with his lips, stopping only when he was certain he had covered every inch of Harry’s skin with kisses.
A crack appeared on the edge of the translucent shield. A thin vein of black magic made its way across the energy that protected them.
The engine roared to life, slowly and carefully, as if it had been sleeping for too long. Draco averted his eyes from Potter, trying to make out what was moving on a tree just ahead. “You didn’t answer me. What are you doing here?” he asked.
Potter’s expression creased in pain as he fell on his haunches, arms hanging limp, but fingers still gripping the shirt. Draco held Potter’s hands, prodding them open and freeing himself from their grasp.
Still, when Draco saw the big dark cloud of smoke coming up from the forest near the Living Section, he didn’t run in the opposite direction. Draco and Tainara followed Francisca and José, and when they reached the place that seemed to originate all that smoke, it looked even worse than how it seemed from afar.
Draco looked.
“And Rudá, too,” Saci added, snorting, and rolled his eyes. “He could not give that to ye.” He stretched his palm, and Draco assumed he was talking about the coconut. “Give it back.”
Saci raised an eyebrow, silent for a moment. “I’m not
It seemed accurate. A shy grin made its way across Draco’s face as the world shifted into place again. Potter messing up wasn’t news, but he would very much like to know more about it.
, Tainara had explained in fewer words than she usually had when talking about her beloved tales, was a witch—
Lua smacked him again. “Not
“Right, well, thank you.” Draco cleared his throat, reeling at the prospect of having Harry’s undivided attention. “I’m looking for two plants, then. According to my earlier research they have been used on the Moriaetem Potion.” It wouldn’t be Draco’s first choice of naming, but since all the registries referred to it that way, he had little choice. “The last known sighting of them was here, in the Rainforest, by an English wizard and creature hunter called Edwin Thomas, back in the twenties. He had been researching those plants for some time when he discovered what they could do and started exploring their properties for twisted purposes. Most of the archives about him have been lost, though. I did some tests with the blood samples of those affected, and they gave me positive results when matched with some Plantae families Longbottom had brought from the rainforest and—”
The main building—the palace—resembled a temple. Its golden rocks glittered and refracted a flaxen hue almost everywhere the light touched. The field surrounding it was covered in short grass, the vivid green of such life that it seemed to beam a light of its own. Around the field, surrounding the school and the giant waterfall, the trees of the Rainforest enveloped them in a protective dome.
. Ye stink of it. Where did ye find it? Didn’t think the school wald make it for the students.”
The noises of the party were muffled at that height, and the only things Draco heard, beside the leaves, were the singing of the birds, the deafening cicadas, and Harry’s voice encouraging him whenever his shoulders sagged a little or he sighed. “You’re doing great, love. We’re almost there. Keep going.”
Draco was frozen. He couldn’t go back to London now that he was
According to the old Pottermore and JK, Caiporas are protectors of Castlobruxo. Though I don't agree 100% with this, Caipora is a fascinating creature and I wanted to use it in SoS.
A person from the countryside; someone inexperienced.
Potter had offered to take Draco to the normal greenhouse. But if he was being honest, Draco wasn’t ready for another disappointment if Castelobruxo decided he wasn’t worthy of that too. They ended up on a pleasant promenade around the Living Section.
Draco was there to finish his research, and that’s what he was going to do. After he found a few breakable objects to appease his growing temper, obviously.
to stare at the wizard.
“Yes, it’s me. I’m Draco Malfoy,” he interjected, forcing the boy’s attention on him again before any of them said anything else. “I need to know why I was rejected. Why won’t Caipora let me in?”
, but he’s always up for a shot of
Draco was used to the weight of Nazaré’s body crumpling him down in the middle of the night by now, and he didn’t even wake up to her anymore. But
“I doubt that.”
,” she spat, finally turning around.
“I’m zure you are.”
Draco was so intrigued by how it was produced once Potter began explaining the dynamics to him, he didn’t even have it in him to reject the idea. Brazilian TV shows, once aired, had one episode per day, except Sundays, and they filmed it while going, taking into consideration the public’s opinion. It could last hundreds of episodes and it was amazing how they made it work continuously.
He sighed. “Don’t you two have anywhere to be, classes to teach?”
She's also known as Mãe D'água,
The Living Section featured an assortment of small cabins, and a slightly larger building that, according to Potter, was the dining room. A powerful scent came from that structure and Draco could not identify it for the life of him.
This reprieve didn’t last long, though. Harry’s students demanded his focus back; and Tainara, the parrot, and his research demanded Draco’s. He was not on holiday, even if it seemed like it when Potter had his arms around Draco’s waist and lips all over his neck, under the shadow of a tree or laying lazily on the hammock on the porch. He had to get his bearings together and go back to work.
Draco went back to his books and just stayed there—unable to return them to the library, because without Tainara, most of them refused to even let him touch them—hesitant to leave them here in the open.
He shook his head; the ghost was back again. Not one, many. Shapes of light wriggled around him with arms raised, yellowish figures that were so bright in the dark night that they were outshining even the stars. The leaves had turned a shade more saturated, gleaming in the orange hue of the fire and the ghosts Draco was sure, somehow, didn’t exist outside his head.
“Don’t you think I would’ve figured out he’s here once I, you know, got here?” He tried tamping his anger, but it was not there anymore. Draco had known. He suspected as much, at least. It still hurt, though, that Potter had decided Draco was not worthy of the information. Even if they hadn’t parted on good terms, they… Draco never would have told anyone, Potter had to know that. “You could have given me a heads up.”
Not that Draco socialised that much with Potter’s friends, but time and some space had transformed their stilted bumping on the streets into something more polite and deliberate.
Despite how alluring the school was, he wanted to get rid of the prat’s company as soon as possible. If Draco was honest, Potter’s presence wasn’t all that bad. But Draco was
“Wait, but you said,” he started, heaving a shaky breath. “You said it would search for someone who had been touched by darkness. And I have.”
“I don’t mind at all, Draco. You’re welcome to stay as long as you want.”
, Draco thought, frozen on the spot, afraid to get too close and alert the person of his presence.
Yet, here he was, lost in the forest with a crazy man that had lured Draco there by convincing a bird—the only one from that forest that seemed to have accepted Draco—to drag him by the sleeve. It had to mean something, whatever Rudá wanted with him.
“But, you see,” he went on, unsure if she was even listening to him, but determined to break the walls she held so high. “There’s no logic to your line of thought. The longer I take to figure this out, the longer we’ll all have to deal with the sun. And with Rudá, whatever he was planning.” The name made Lua flinch. Whatever Rudá meant, it had worked, so Draco continued. “Rudá gave me the seed for a reason. I tried finding him again, but it’s impossible, as you’ve probably figured.” It was. Draco had spent a few days in the search for the half-marine creature, before Saci kindly reminded him that Rudá transformed into the pink dolphin by day. And since it was day every time now, the man was unreachable.
“This house has been in me family for years ya know? We used to be a big deal like you Malfoys, but we didn’t like doin’ illegal shit like yer people did. This whole areas full of clay soil, used to make a fortune offa it. But as ya can probably tell that didn’t last much past the 1850s. Hadda sell everythin’, ya know we used to have a big house a couple farms over? Got taken by this lord in the 1890s an’ we were left with this shithole. Anyway am getting’ side tracked.
“I did as well— I’m glad we’re on the same page. I mean it's obvious that none of them particularly feel any remorse for any actions and there’s a sense of detachment in all of the cases, even the ones which are more… ‘intimate’, for lack of a better word. Plus the amount of psychopaths in the system already leads to the assumption that those involved in these killings are on the higher end of the spectrum than most.”
Harry shook his head slightly, “I don’t think so, just look at his property rates. He’s got a decent influx of people buying into his property and since he’s a private owner he won’t come recommended by the council. So he must be being promoted by the people who live there, otherwise his rates would be a lot lower. I mean the average rate for private landowners is significantly lower than what he’s earning, and while he’s certainly no billionaire he’s got a fair amount of money.”
“If I told I’d have to kill you.” Draco’s voice is secretive and the deadly serious expression on his face makes Harry rolls his eyes.
After that point Draco spent more time in the little room in the far corner of the west wing. He’d spend hours on end trying to play songs he heard on the radio, avoiding all contact with anyone in the outside world. He’d never say that he was good (he’d never had a lesson in his life) but there was something about the way his fingers seamlessly flowed over the keys creating melodies he’d never even heard before that calmed his mind and kept him sane in the dark, dreary place he called home. Ever since his parent’s accident Draco had been spending a lot more time in this room to try and escape the dead, stagnant air in the rest of the house. Although his family had never been particularly loud there had always been noises somewhere in the house, whether it was servants making food in the kitchens, his father talking to clients or his mother arguing with her bat-shit sister. But now the servants are long gone, Lucius’ clients are now Draco’s and Bellatrix is completely off the radar. This evidently leaves Draco all alone in the echoing manor with peeling wallpaper and an ever increasing amount of grime on the windows, neither of which he can be bothered fixing.
“Your mother cares about you far more than I do Draco; even you can figure that out. But don’t be fooled; even she wouldn’t hesitate to cast you out if you don’t follow tradition. Do you know how hard your mother and I have worked to keep the family name going? We have built up the legacy of my father and have created a business which you have a duty to protect. If you don’t then you leave us no choice but to cast you out Draco, no inheritance, no title, no land, you’ll be left with nothing. Do you want that?” Every word that Lucius said chipped away at the defensive stance Draco had taken on and the child had felt as though his heart were being punctured with hundreds of needles. Tears welled in his eyes and he looked pitifully down at his shoes.Through his blurry vision Draco had seen Midnight come over and start sniffing at his feet, and the tug at his heart still resonated with him over twenty years later.
So in ’98 yer dear ol’ daddy came knockin’ on an’ demandin’ the money for Voldemort like some bitch to a fuckin’ lord from 1300s. Obviously me family were still livin’ off the dirt and couldn’t pay it all back, so he came back couple days later he shot ‘em all and took ma niece’s puppy. Dunno what happened to the lil guy, got off lighter than rest of us.
Draco’s eyes glimmer ever so slightly and he quickly diverts his gaze as though he were afraid of how Harry would react to a sign of vulnerability. Harry is scared to move in case he accidentally pushes the blonde man further away. After a moment, however, Draco smiles slightly and looks directly into Harry’s wide eyes, and places his hand on Harry’s.
A soft date moment.
“How did you get in?” Draco refuses to lower the gun, “And can’t you see that I’m working?”
By the time Draco returns to the manor the sun is much lower in the sky and the hedge is casting distorted shadows across the great walls. He smiles as the dog barked excitedly when they entered the house, and a soft chuckle escapes his lips when he imagines how his father would react to seeing this, especially a stray. After Draco has washed the dog’s matted fur and fed it some scraps of meat he decides on spending the remainder of his evening in the main office sorting through the decades of paperwork his father had neglected. Part of Draco’s job as the only member of his father’s business is to sort out the masses of paperwork he had let fall into disorder, and Draco has always found organisation to be a relaxing task.
“You dare speak his name!” Bellatrix snaps upright and points the bloody knife at Draco, “You have yet to earn the right to speak of such excellency.”
Harry chuckles slightly as he slings his satchel over his shoulder. He gives Hermione a nod as he leaves and bids the two women good night. The night air is quite warm and pleasant as he walks quickly through the dark streets, careful not to trip over any strangers’ legs on his journey.
“I’m sorry,” Draco’s voice is quiet but steady, “But my point still stands, I’m not leaving here until you’re dead.”
“Look,” He snarls into the phone, “Whoever you are, fuck off. I don’t know if you think this is funny but I’m not particularly amused. If you carry on I swear you will be sorry and wish you’d shut up when you had the chance, do you understand?” His fist clenches when he receives no reply, this is getting beyond ridiculous now. “Fine,” he snaps, “Don’t say anything you prick, and if you call me again I’ll make sure you don’t speak again. Now leave me the fuck alone.”
“Oh Draco,” Bellatrix cocks her head mockingly as she walks towards Draco, “They’re as good as dead, what was the point in me being there?”
Draco looked up the address from Blaise and saw that the cottage it would take him to was on the outskirts of the next town over. It seemed secluded enough, should things get a little messy. As insufferable as Blaise’s language was Draco had to admit he was actually fairly decent at his job, although not that Draco would ever say that to his face. Grabbing his phone and the bag containing his
“No,” Draco shakes his head, “No, I kill people that deserve it. You… all of you, you do this for fun. You enjoy seeing the light of someone’s eyes go out when you take their life away, you look forward to what disgusting thing you’ll do to their bodies after they’ve died. I’m not like you, I’m nothing like my Father. So tell your Lord to fuck off, and leave me and my friends alone.”
“Yes, someone who can detach himself completely. You’d be a valuable asset. Think about it Draco, you know where I am.” Voldemort gently ran his hand along Draco’s shoulder as he left the room, and when Draco heard the door shut his knees buckled and he almost fell to the ground. He stumbled over to the fridge and pulled the scrap paper with the instructions, breathing deeply and heavily. He slipped on some plastic gloves to avoid fingerprints before arranged the gun in the man's hand to make it look like a suicide. He’d thankfully shot the man at an angle where the blood splatter was behind his head, but he still took the routine precautions of staging a suicide. Draco arranged the corpse so it was sat at the table and positioned so that the blood splatter seemed to make sense. Motive is always vital when staging a suicide, but this man has no need for a note. No one was close enough to him to come by his house soon so he wouldn’t have anyone to write to. Draco glanced around the room carefully and spotted a photo frame with a photograph of the man and his family. ‘Perfect’, Draco thinks as he places the photo directly in front of the dead man. He does consider some blood drops on the frame but decides against that extra level of embellishment. Less is more after all.
“Not at all, I don’t mind anyone asking questions. I just might not give you an answer and if I do it might not be what you want to hear.”
“Yeah I understand what you mean about the intimacy still being detached. It's like whoever has killed the victims is saying that the victim was just a means to an end. They’re not the focus, the killer is. So what theories have you got so far?” Harry asks curiously.
Forced back to the present, he carefully held his hand out for the dog to come up and sniff, and surprisingly the animal took an instant liking to him. Draco smiles slightly as the dog licks the palm of his hand, and his smile widens when the dog begins to follow him on the walk back up to the manor. Draco wouldn’t mind a companion, even though it may be a furry one, and he hopes that Harry likes dogs. Although his trip to the woods hasn’t enlightened him with any new knowledge about the numbers and the mystery caller Draco almost wishes that he had been fixated on the numbers. Yes the numbers were frustrating him but when coupled with memories of Midnight it was like salt in an open wound.

As Harry is putting the papers into a pile to leave on Ron’s desk he notices the door to their office open. He straightens and frowns at the bushy haired woman who pops her head around the door to glance around the room. When her dark eyes lock his she flashes a toothy grin and walks over to Harry.
Things got worse ‘bout 30 years back when weather changed and the ground was fulla water all the time, couldn’t sell nothin’. We couldn’t even afford to move outta here, so me parents went to yer daddy askin’ for some money. He hooked ‘em up with Voldemort who gave it to ‘em sure, just didn’t tell ‘em about the payback time an’ how yer family dealt with folks who couldn’t pay ‘em back.
“So you don’ believe that people are innocent until proven guilty?”
Lucius had smirked at Midnight’s obedience and he aggressively clapped Draco on the back, “So you taught him to stay already, did you teach him to play dead?” At that the full gravity of the situation hit Draco and he had realised that his father wasn’t joking around, and that the threat of giving him away to an orphanage was all too real. He began to violently shake his head in complete denial of the situation and flinched away from Lucius’ presence.
“Sure, basically there’s nothing dodgy in most of the cases, just your run of the mill killers. They’re smart though, don’t leave any traces, the rooms are usually untouched, save the blood splatters. Granger guesses they’re not anti-social per se, there’s nothing really in support of an insanity plea if the killers were ever caught. They’re…average."
“McGonagall won’t be happy about that.” Hermione sounds hesitant, like she doesn’t bend the rules often.
Fuck, Draco thought as he ran a hand through his hair, am I becoming like him? Staring at his reflection in the computer screen, Draco dragged his gaze across his sharp facial features, the silver blonde hair, the cold eyes hiding a million lies. Was this what Father did, all those years ago? Stare into a face which is supposedly his own, and see nothing but his own father? The warm feeling Draco had felt before when his mind was filled with Harry had left as swiftly as it came, and in its place was an all-too-familiar hollowness in his heart.
Draco kept the gun pointed in front of him as he walked down the hall lit only by lamps, sticking to the shadows until he came to the door to what he assumed to be the kitchen. The wooden door was slightly off of its hinges and only partially open, so Draco couldn’t see what the man was doing. There was a lamp near the door frame which would no doubt cast a shadow and give away his presence if he attempted to listen at the door, so he decided to use the element of surprise to his advantage at this time. He pushed open the door suddenly and walked into the brightly lit kitchen, pointing his gun directly at the man sat at the table eating a bowl of soup. To Draco’s surprise the man didn’t look panicked at the intrusion; instead turning a blind eye as he merely went back to eating. Draco took this moment to scan the room for any phones or weapons, but all he could see was the pots and pans, not even any kitchen knives. He flicked his eyes back to the man who was still silently enjoying his soup, trying to figure out what was running through his mind at this moment. His questions were answered when the man sighed, wiped his mouth with a piece of tissue and set his spoon down.
“On what?”
He’d been successful thus far in getting the numbers out of his head and completely emptying his mind-- but now he found himself in the exact same position as he had been before, only with a different surrounding. Groaning in frustration Draco shifted his position slightly so his back was directly against the trunk of the old oak tree and he closed his eyes to focus his thoughts. It seemed that he was constantly thinking of something and his brain was incapable of just shutting up for a moment, even when he so desperately needed to concentrate on just one thing. He only opened his eyes again when he heard a rustling in the ground by his feet, at which point he reluctantly looked for the source. A small, skinny dog was nudging at his feet with its nose, clearly unsure of whether or not Draco was dead. It must have been a stray because his parents were strongly against animals being allowed on the property, save the albino peacocks they’d had before the accident.
“I don’t want to defend someone I know is guilty.” Draco shrugs, running his finger lightly around the rim of his cup.
“Ya gonna stand there pointing that gun at me all night or ya gonna sit down?” The man looked at Draco with a bored expression, like Draco’s being there were a nuisance and not a clear threat on his life. Draco narrowed his gaze and glanced briefly at the chair opposite the man before looking back at the man.
“And yet you do,” Draco looks at Harry curiously, “Now why do you think that is?”
“980603.”
After a few hours Draco felt like he had a friend who would always be there for him and that Lucius approved of, he had apparently even picked him for Draco! Draco called the dog Midnight which, in hindsight, wasn’t the most creative name but the eight year old had thought it fitted the dog perfectly. At around noon Lucius came back into the living room where Draco had been playing with Midnight, teaching him to roll over and to run in circles.
“What are you doing here, Bellatrix?” Bellatrix is leant against the doorframe leading to the next room, staring at Draco with her signature manic smile.
By the time he reaches the table Harry’s mind has managed to analyse every aspect of this meeting and the various outcomes, but he still feels mildly nauseous as Draco glances up and smiles at Harry whilst maintaining steady eye contact with his cool eyes.
“Where are we going Father?” Draco timidly asked, looking back at the manor which was steadily growing further and further away. He saw his mother stood on the front entrance looking sadly at Draco as he walked down the drive, but she abruptly turned and went inside when she realised he could see her. Lucius still hadn’t responded and there was an uncomfortable twisting in Draco’s stomach which made him feel queasy. He held Midnight tighter to his chest, using the dog as a source of comfort whilst he followed the tall, slender figure of his father into an open field far away from the manor. That year had seen a major heatwave and despite the sky being grey and dark the air had been uncomfortably humid. Draco could still remember how claustrophobic and queasy he had felt, and he had never been certain if it had been due to the weather or his nerves.
"I don't want anything."
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
“I tell ya what happened if ya listen an’ ‘humour me’ as ya phrased it. Guessin’ ya know who Voldemort is, or did yer daddy not wanna scare ya with the big bad boss?”
Draco's POV
“I’m fine up here thanks,” Draco’s tone was short and direct, his confusion at the situation causing his patience to wear thin, “Are you the one who’s been calling?” The man sighed and gestured to the chair again with a bored expression. Draco clenched his jaw in annoyance but walked to the chair, never taking his eyes or gun off the man. When he was sat down he rested his elbow on the table, angling the gun directly between the man’s eyes. “Answer me, now.”
“I’ll tell you if you tell me why you’re phoning at one in the morning on a Thursday.” Draco could practically hear Harry smirking on the other side of the phone. He wonders how far away Harry actually is, the bar they had met at was a 15 minute drive away from Malfoy Manor, but since Draco wanted to spend as much time away from that place as possible he would often walk for hours on end down the old lanes leading into the main city. Ever since meeting Harry he had been wondering what it would be like to walk with the messy haired man along that road, talking about anything and everything. Yet Draco couldn’t imagine that Harry would appreciate the nature of Draco’s job, or the intricacies of his home life. It’s for this reason that Draco decides that it's best not to tell Harry about the phone call, Draco wants to track the source and take care of this himself.
“Oh, why not?”
“Oh no reason, just wondering who you’re texting and why they’re more important than work.” Ron reaches over and snatches Harry’s phone out of his hand and looks at the contact name, “Ooooooo who’s Draco? That’s a fancy name-- is he a fancy man?” Ron laughs at Harry’s annoyed expression before tossing the dark haired man’s phone back to him. “Seriously,” Ron continued, his tone now calmer as he looked straight at Harry who tried to avoid his gaze, “Who is this guy?”
In the grass by the side of the main entrance, Draco digs a small hole for the victim of his panic, and gently places the bird to rest in the dirt. After he has patted the earth flat he sits back on the grass, looking mournfully at the grave. How is it possible for him to feel such remorse for shooting a bird when he can barely count how many people he has killed in his lifetime? Because the people deserve it, he thinks, and that bird did nothing to me. He nods, as if reassuring himself that he did the right thing, and hastily wipes away his tears with a dirt covered hand. Getting up and heading back to the Manor, only one thought races through his mind:
“Draco, this is a surprise. What is the meaning of this call?”
The shot echoed across the bare fields and seemed to carry on for hours, and when it stopped the air stagnated around them. After a brief moment Draco had let out an inhuman wail. The horrible noise cut through the silence like a knife through flesh and was only broken by Lucius harshly slapping the screaming child across the face. That was the first and last time his father ever hit him.
“I barely know him Ron, it's nothing serious.” There’s a clear sense of sadness in Harry’s voice which makes Ron cock his head curiously. Harry’s never been the type of person to be affected by people not wanting to form any kind of relationship with; he would usually welcome it. So the fact that he is genuinely bothered by this piques Ron’s concern instantly.
“No, I’ll look later. Just give me an outline.” Harry leans back in his chair, back slumped and pressing his fingers together.
“Guess I’ll have to be careful not to get on your bad side then?” Harry lowers his voice to mimic Draco’s.
As the man apparently settled down to eat Draco slowly and silently moved around the house, assessing potential exit and entry points. He considered cutting the phone lines in case the man attempted to call for help but decided against it just in case the police suspected a meticulous killing as opposed to a general homicide when they eventually found the body. There was no one around for miles so he didn’t have to worry about anyone coming by, but the darkness would make it difficult to track the man if he escaped. Hopefully the limp would hinder that course of action. As Draco came to the front door after encircling the whole house he was surprised to find it already open. ‘God he must be going senile’ Draco thought to himself as he quietly pulled the plastic suit on over his clothes and loaded his guns. Just to be safe he kept a cocked pistol in his hand as he softly walked into the house, sticking close to the walls to keep the doors in his direct line of sight. There was a set of rickety stairs towards the centre of the house but the lack of a bannister and the general instability they seemed to have assured Draco that no one would be running up and down them. He can’t be one-hundred percent certain that the man was home alone however he appears to be cooking for one and there are no other lights on in house. Even if there was someone else in the house they most likely wouldn’t pose any immediate threat to Draco’s plan.
“You wouldn’t find me that interesting.”
“No,” Hermione shakes her head slowly, “A gang would imply small scale, and this is a hell of a lot bigger than that. I’m thinking more along the line of organised crime.” Harry nods his head as he leans back in his chair. The possibility of organised crime wasn’t something he had considered, primarily because it isn’t as prevalent in the UK as other countries. But it still exists, and if Hermione is right then this could be far bigger than any of them ever imagined.
“Now,” Lucius’ voice was commanding and stern, “I’ll ask you one more time. Do you or don’t you want to make your family proud?” Draco’s young mind had almost stopped at that moment. He had wanted to make his parents proud, but nothing was so simple, even at that age. Draco had thought in that moment that if he did as his father demanded then maybe his parents would finally treat him like their son. Yet at the same time he hadn’t wanted to hurt anybody no matter how bad they were. Apparently his extended silence displeased Lucius who had taken a step closer to Draco, his shadowed figure engulfing the small boy.
