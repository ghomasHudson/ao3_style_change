Draco wanks himself off as Harry feeds him cake, piece by piece. He gets cream on his chin and on his cheek. Harry smears it across his jaw, messing him up. The line of Harry's cock stands pronounced in his jeans.
"No," Draco says. It's not like he's not going to need a bit of time to get his head around it. He'd like to know more about it, but it's not like his father's library is going to have a book on it, and he can't just pop into Flourish and Blotts and hope they've got a strange kinks section for the niche witch or wizard. Maybe one of the bookshops in Soho.
"Don't make that face," Harry says. "If we can't laugh at my specific childhood trauma, we'd never get anything done at all."
“There were a lot of very clever wizards who tried to protect that stone, is what I’m saying,” Harry says, “and it still got stolen.”
"I want to be with you," Harry says again. "I want to be with you and it doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do what I’m asking. I don’t care. I just want there to be an
It's the middle of the night and Draco hasn't quite got it in him to get hard again quite so soon, but this time it isn't him that Harry's getting off. It's Harry himself, his hand circling his cock.
"He wore flip flops," Draco says, but his heart's not in it. To Harry, was this the equivalent of meeting Draco's mother? Meeting Hermione Granger and her family?
Before Draco can approach him, Harry's shoulders catch like he's just remembered somewhere he needs to be, and he scans the people around him, gaze flitting from person to person, to Draco and beyond, and then back, settling on Draco.
"Just a hole," he says out loud. "I'm just a hole." His whole body is flushed pink, and this time when he does the same thing he did last night - down on his knees with his cheek pressed to the floor, hands spreading his arse cheeks apart, he stares at his hole until his dick's so hard he could come right there and then.
Draco has a meeting in the morning. He dresses carefully, flicking away the small creases in the sleeves from where his clothes have been stored. He's immaculate by the end of it, carefully fitted wool coat over his suit. He skims his hands over his hips, thinks just for a second about Harry Potter telling him that life's too short, and then he gathers up his meeting notes and apparates to his meeting.
Draco tries very hard not to let on how sad he feels whenever Harry reveals something so desperately mundane that he's never been allowed to have. "Not in the least," he says after a moment. "Not at all."
"I'd ask you if you had an opinion on what underwear you wanted," Harry says after a while, without looking up, "but it's not like you would want to express an opinion even if you weren't bound still. So I get to pick my piglet's knickers."
But then, then, Harry comes to a stop in front of the dog and cat beds. They all look relatively small on the shelf, but the labels promise that they're magically expandable for any pet size.
It's nice, and quiet, and Draco's a little fuzzy from the wine and the warmth from the fire. Harry's hand is in his hair.
Harry crouches down next to him. "I've been thinking about you fucking a cake," he says. "Two cakes. Your face in one and your dick in another. Have you been thinking about that too?"
Draco lies down on the rug by the sofa. His cock presses against the soft, white pile. His arms are down by his sides. He turns his cheek so that he's facing away from Harry, can't see what he's doing, and he closes his eyes. Nothing, that's what he wants to be. Just something to be used. A rag for Harry's come. Just nothing.
Draco's skin burns red. "Yes," he says, his voice small. He had often made himself come thinking about the thrill of discovery, the shame of being seen, the horror of humiliating himself and coming in front of his friends, his true self being visible to everyone. Sometimes he'd made himself make noises, made himself cry out to test out the silencing spell, to feel his skin heat up in humiliation as he rubbed himself to orgasm on his Slytherin sheets.
"Show me," Harry says, and Draco obediently moves a little so that Harry can see the marks on the tile.
Then Harry had found him, had found him out, and had given him everything he'd discovered that Draco had wanted. And one of those things, something that didn't really fit in with any of the fantasies or desires, was Harry sucking him off, licking the tiny length of him, every touch an embarrassing reiteration of just how small Draco is, a reminder that he can't fuck Harry or be anything other than just something for Harry to use.
"Is that little cock hard at the thought of what's coming next?" Harry asks. He drops his hand to cup Draco's little cocklet, then lets go so he can go back to playing with Draco's nipples.
"You wouldn't want to eat off them on the floor now, would you?" Harry asks. "Surely not your mother's china. Not when you could have your own bowl. With your name on it."
"A present," Harry agrees, tugging on his hand just enough to get them out into the hall and following the coffee tray towards a sofa, and, to Draco's surprise, the record player and a small pile of records.
“Perhaps,” Draco says, since he’s had a lot of time to think about how what Hogwarts might have done differently to avert the fracture in their childhoods. “What was your point?”
He kneels down on the kitchen floor, facing away from Harry, and leans down until he's pressing his cheek against the tile. Then he spreads his legs until he's presenting his hole for inspection.
He helps Harry out of bed, and then puts on his socks and his slippers, and pulls the red jumper over Harry's head. It swims on him, too big by half, the sleeves falling down over his wrists and the shoulder seams falling halfway down his arms. It makes him seem littler than he is. Then he takes Harry's hand and they walk through the castle to the long gallery, and the secret doorway by the fireplace, then down the hallway to the door that says
“I don’t know,” Draco says. “Do you think me wanting what I want, getting hard for the things I get hard for, do you think that’s a result of what happened to me? Because I don’t think it is. I think Voldemort could have stayed gone for good and I’d have grown up and got married and become Minister, or whatever it was that my father always thought would happen to me when I grew up, and I’d still secretly be getting hard for having someone humiliate me. It’s not some kind of retribution for being wrong-headed and a fucking disgrace. It’s just who I am. It’s just what I want. It doesn’t hurt anyone, me wanting it.”
For a while, they watch the sea. It’s relatively calm out there, if cold, and Draco refreshes the warming charm on the blanket, and on him, and on Harry. It gets rid of the worst of the chill.
Draco’s not exactly sure what Harry’s going on about, but maybe he doesn’t have to. It’s just nice hearing his voice.
"I turn around and I get on my knees," Draco says, and his skin feels hot. He wants to stop holding his arse cheeks apart to show off his hole and touch his useless little cock instead. "And I present like this, so I can look behind me and see in the mirror what I am."
"Can’t have you not being able to see what you look like," Harry says. "You’ve got my come all over your face and you’re masturbating all over the floor again."
Harry’s eyes are bright. "Thank fuck," he says, and he closes the difference between them and presses his mouth to Draco’s, kissing him again. "Thank fuck."
Harry glances down at Draco's cock, then raises an eyebrow, amused. "Anyone could see," he says, and Draco doesn't bother explaining any of the complex spellwork that protects his home from the outside world. "But I forgot, you like that, don't you?"
"Easier doesn't mean better, though." Harry spoons out stew into a bowl, setting it down in front of Draco. "And she never says anything. When I told her about us, she asked me if you liked stew and I said yes, and then made this."
Draco shudders with it, with the thrill of the shame of it, and he sucks the guy's dick and swallows some of it and gets the rest on his shirt and his chin.
The bell, when it rings, is a ringing peal that reminds Draco unquenchably of his mother. It isn't like he usually receives guests now that his mother is living on the continent, but before she'd gone she'd dined and held carefully curated card parties and weekend lunches. A deliberately quiet plan to eventually auction off Draco's virginity to the nearest reputable and agreeable witch, which had messily failed to come to fruition when Draco had begged his mother to stop.
Draco lifts his palm to his face and smears Harry’s come across his mouth, messing himself up. He can’t bear to think about what he looks like, cock out, come smeared, grass stained and sweaty.
Draco leans in and presses a kiss to the centre of Harry's forehead, catching the corner of Harry's scar. "We'll have a story after breakfast," he says, remembering the few times his mother read to him when he was small. "But first, tea and toasted teacakes."
Draco has to stop resting on his hands for that, leaning forward so that his cheek's resting against the tiles as he reaches behind himself to pull his arse cheeks apart. Harry can probably see Draco's useless little cock hanging between his legs too, leaking pitifully onto the floor like the desperate, filthy piglet he is.
should be doing that, but it just… doesn't feel like the kind of situation where Draco should speak. They haven't talked about that - haven't talked about
Harry shakes his head. "No," he says. "You'll know when I ask you. This is just me wanting a thing."
"Fair and square," Draco says, the odd little fluttering of the snitch’s wings tickling his palms. "Not my fault I’m better than you."
Harry comes on him, striping his lower back and the top of his arse, and Draco closes his eyes again, and thinks:
“No,” Draco says, and - not for the first time - he thinks that Dumbledore got what was coming to him in the end. He hopes that hand of his hurt.
Upstairs, Draco’s bedroom is warm and neat with a fire lit. Everything is clean and tidy, from the neatly pulled back curtains around the four poster to his toiletries on the dresser. A lot of the furniture dates back to the lairds, but in-between are a lot of the surplus from the manor. It’s a strange hodge-lodge of styles, magical and non-magical in origin, but Draco’s focus, the rare times he’s stayed here, has been the Quidditch pitch.
"You have permission," Harry tells him. "You have all the permission you want to eat exactly what you want. All the sweet things you need."
"I came all over her hand," Harry says. "Quite quickly, too, if I’m honest. I should probably be embarrassed."
Draco wakes first in the morning, and rather than wake Harry up too, he slips out of bed and into the small bathroom to dress. It's cold outside, the clouds heavy, the sea grey. He stands on the little rocky beach with his hands in his pockets and lets the wind wake him. It blusters against his skin and through his jumper, whistling past him as it buffets Harry's little cottage on its way inland. It's cold and overcast, but Draco feels nothing but bright, unbridled joy.
"Crawl after me," Harry says, already setting off across the hall, and the lead pulls on Draco's collar as he stumbles to follow him. Draco, crawling like an animal, a pet, like he's less than human. He leaves his pile of clothes discarded behind him on the entrance hall floor, alongside a little damp patch where he'd licked the floor clean of his come.
“Did you spend much time here?” Harry asks, once they’re outside and wandering through the woods and past the Quidditch pitch. “When you were setting up the wards?”
Draco considers a life without neat, pressed clothes. His mother might have a conniption if he showed up at her door in anything that looked as untidy as Harry's clothes pile. He's not sure he
Draco swallows down a breath. "That's right, sir," he says, and Harry's hips buck forward. "That's all I am, something for you to come on."
He hums. "Just a little," he says, which is somewhat of an exaggeration given the complexity. Harry's not wearing any clothes, and the part of Draco that's been bred to live and breathe etiquette shivers with the flagrant rule-breaking.
"Would you like that?" Harry goes on. "If I took you there so everyone could see? If I put you the lead and walked you around with that little, tiny cocklet jutting out?"
Draco realises he's lost his scarf around the same time he realises just how cold it is outside, which is around the same time that the sun starts to disappear behind the tumbledown rooftop of Ginny Weasley's new house. He's been at this for about four hours so far, and it's going to need another day. He's tired, and he liked that scarf, and the wards have turned out to be more complex than he envisaged.
Draco puts his own jumper on then, an arran sweater that's much the same as Harry's except for the colours. Then he holds out his hand, and waits for Harry to take it.
Harry steps back, tucking his cock back into his trousers. He reaches down for his broomstick. He’s flushed red and is a little out of breath. He sets off back towards the castle, and Draco’s left to stumble to his feet and practically run after him, gathering up his broom and the snitch case on the way. Harry doesn’t look back at him and Draco’s cocklet is hanging out of his trousers and he really isn’t anything other than a filthy piglet. A dirty, shameful piglet with a useless little stiffy.
, and it's so, so filthy. He never knew he could be this dirty, or this full of shame, or this fucking turned on.
Draco wants to rut against Harry's leg like he's been allowed to do before, but he stops himself. He stops himself. He hasn't been given permission this time, and he doesn't want to be bad for Harry. Harry, who called him pup. Who calls him piglet. He sinks down onto his knees, into the rug, and keeps his mouth around Harry's cock.
It's a while later when Harry speaks. Draco is still resting his cheek against Harry's thigh, sitting sprawled across Harry's kitchen floor with his stupid, useless little cock out. He'd come all over Harry's trouser leg, like a common animal. Draco keeps his eyes closed as if that will make the humiliation easier to deal with. He'd wanted this, begged for it practically, but that didn't make it any easier to manage after the fact.
"Amongst other things." He meets her eyes. "I know you have no reason to trust me. I know you're protective of Harry. But so am I."
"I want it less than you want your thing, that's all," Harry says quickly. "It's fine to want it less. Just because I'm not asking for it every other day doesn't mean I don't want what you built for me. You made that for me. I'll use it, I promise."
Harry throws Draco a look of sheer exhilaration, and then sets off at a run for the pitch, broom in hand. He’s kicking off and soaring up into the air practically before Draco’s even putting down the little case of snitches he’s brought with him.
Harry looks at him. "My poor darling," he says finally. "You've had to look after too much for too long, haven't you? You need this, don't you? Taking in hand."
Harry jumps, looking vaguely guilty as he clutches two books to his chest. Draco pretends not to notice, and instead, sets the little table by the fire for breakfast instead.
"Let me take charge for a bit, will you?" Harry asks, even as he's leaning in and kissing Draco's cheek.
Draco looks at him. Neither of them have made a move to start getting dressed. "Come on," he says, and nods towards the bed. "Let's just sit down for a bit."
Draco does like this. He likes it far, far more than he’d anticipated, given that it’s only ever been the stupid, overblown fantasy he’s masturbated to time and time again. Harry’s striking the right balance between keeping it fantasy, and making it real.
"Stand on the right," someone else yells, and Draco has no idea about how he's standing upright or not dying or anything, so it's down to Harry again to wrap an arm around him and tug him into his side on the right of the escalator.
Draco takes another chocolate, a gold one this time, and chooses not to think about how and when he got hard.
"My darling," Harry says. "My darling. Shall we humiliate you? Make you feel everything you want to feel?"
"Wednesday evening," Harry agrees. "And Ron will be there, you know. He won't go away just because you don't say his name."
"Fuck you when you're covered in cake," Harry agrees. "But first you're going to accompany me to dinner with Hermione and Ron, and you're not going to show me up, are you?"
They strip quickly, and not even the part of Draco that is desperate to serve is enough to slow them down. He's naked, his little cock stiff and leaking, before Harry's finished taking off his jeans. They're not… what they've done together hasn't really been the two of them naked together, at least not like this.
"Do you need help?" Draco doesn't want to come in yet. He wants to taste the sea spray on his tongue, watch the seagulls bobbing about on the grey waves, just stand out here a little longer and let the new day settle around him and shape him new.
"We both were," Harry says. His hands are in his pockets. "You were one of the first people I ever met, you know."
Harry smirks. "Just think, when we're away in Scotland, you'll be mine to do what I want with for a whole weekend."
"Bet you just go home and wank, don't you? Think about how you looked here, how you appeared. How humiliating it was."
"Doesn't save us from doing it entirely," Harry says. "But we can still serve ourselves potatoes out of the pan. How many would you like?"
Harry, for a second, looks so desperately full of longing that it hurts. "Please don't do that. Please. Because if you say no now--"
He touches his fingertips to her forearm. He doesn't know how else to stop her. Three fingers to her arm; it's the most he's touched someone that hasn't been Harry or shaking hands with a customer in a very long time. "I know," he says. "You're not telling me anything that we haven't already talked about."
Draco shudders with it, need pulsing through him. "Harry," he begs, hips rolling up, begging for something to rub up against. He'll rut. He's only an animal, after all. "Please. Let me come. I want to come."
"Don't touch," Harry says, when Draco makes a move to touch his cock. From where he's standing, he can clearly see Draco's arse in the mirror. "Present for me, I want to see your stupid hole."
Draco doesn’t think about Hogwarts. He doesn’t think about who he was when he was there, or the choices that he made that helped things reach their conclusion. He doesn’t think about his fucking superiority complex or the smug swagger of a boy who thought he was too good for his surroundings and the people around him. He doesn’t let himself. But he’ll think about this, him on his knees for Harry Potter in the middle of the Quidditch pitch, the cold seeping in through his knees, his mouth around Harry’s cock. He’ll think about this as he groans around him, as the taste of Harry leaks against his tongue.
Harry takes a few minutes to return, and when he does, he's holding the leather lead rolled up in his hand.
"I know," Draco says. "But that first time we talked, right back at the beginning, you said we could help each other out. We both needed something and we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. And I've been thinking about what you wanted, and what you asked for, and I don't think you're getting what you need."
Harry doesn't bother looking back, and by the time Draco's scrambled to his feet in embarrassed humiliation and got his dick away, there's no sign of him in the main bar. There's just a business card in Draco's pocket and humiliation settling down dark against his skin.
Some part of Draco that he's shoved into a box flickers into life, a small pocket of heat in his belly. He slips a hand into his pocket, casual, and glances towards the window. There are a couple of plants on the windowsill, a few books piled up by the bed, one folded out onto the floor to keep a page. Two half empty mugs on the bedside table. A glass of water.
"I make you humiliate me so I can get off," Draco says quietly. "The things I want are shameful. What about any of that makes you think I deserve soft things?"
Harry’s already flying away when Draco comes up with a witty rejoinder, and by then the only thing to do is fly after him, searching the sky for the little golden wings of the snitch.
"And I'm filling you," Harry agrees, breath hot against Draco's skin. He nips at Draco's shoulder with his teeth, arm wrapped around his chest, anchoring him close. Draco craves closeness, he craves intimacy, and Harry is holding him so tight that Draco can barely breathe, and it's perfect. "Making use of you."
Harry grins at him. "Pretty tame compared to what we actually like. But she basically talked about us fighting and then having sex. At Hogwarts, actually, which is the least sexy part because quite frankly, I think about Hogwarts and all I do is have nightmares about everybody I love dying, but apparently I could put that aside and still come at the thought of having sex with you."
?" Harry asks, coming in. "I thought you were going to be ready to leave when I arrived-- oh. Hi, Hermione. What're you doing here?"
He’s never slept with someone at his side and woken up early to plan tiny, careful changes to the nursery upstairs, and what he needs to procure to put his plans in place.
Afterwards, he lets Harry fuck his mouth, still kneeling down with his cock out and his come across the floor.
Draco considers that for a moment, and then puts his empty cake plate and his cup and saucer back down on the coffee table. "Do you think I could kiss you?" he asks, all in a rush, cheeks pink. It's not the time to consider how similar it sounds to Potter's
It's a muggle pub, a normal one just off the high street so it's not tremendously busy. The man from last night is seated over at the far side of the room, a drink in front of him.
"Perhaps," Harry says, but then he's shaking hands with the shop assistant, and putting on this whole
He doesn't know how much later it is, but it's dark when Harry kneels in front of him and says his name.
"Yes," Harry says. "He did." He waits a beat before speaking again. "I'm sorry for your loss, Draco."
“Put them on the floor by your pet bed,” Harry says, and Draco’s little cock is already hard at the idea of his furry piglet bed, all lined up by the wall.
The noise Draco makes is torn from the back of his throat. He’s already crossing his wrists, holding them out for Harry to take, and Harry’s eyes are bright.
The collar is on the bedside table and the nappies are in the nursery. It's the work of minutes to go and get them and bring them back down to the sitting room, and in the intervening period Harry has cleared away the tea things and stripped off his trousers until he's just in his underwear and his shirt and jumper. He doesn't look quite so confident as normal, but Draco recognises this Harry Potter. It's the one that occasionally gives speeches or appears on the front of the Daily Prophet. It's the mask he wears so that people don't find out what he's feeling underneath.
Draco rocks his hips down against the cake. He's got cake and cream everywhere, and he's sticky and dirty and it's not enough. He's not ashamed enough. He wants more.
"I don't know what that is," Draco says, although his attention is rather lost in Harry talking so easily about his feelings for Draco. Draco, who nobody had wanted. Who'd ended up finding this, instead, this pocket of space in the universe where he and Harry can breathe.
"I'm happy," Harry says, and Draco, his heart pounding, tucks his face into the curve of Harry's shoulder, and holds on.
"What did I do to deserve you, hey?" Harry asks, when the floor's licked clean and Draco's resting on his knees with his cheek pressed to the hardwood. "So beautifully obedient, my dirty, depraved boy."
"If I want to be fucked, I'll have to go elsewhere," Harry goes on, almost lazy as he runs his fingertips over Draco's hips. "Do you remember that, Piglet? You being cuckolded as I got satisfaction from a man with a real dick."
Harry strokes his palm up Draco's throat, tilting up his chin and holding him there. He kisses him, kisses him again, kisses dragged along his jaw, breath slack. "I love you," he says. "Love you so much. Going to look after you so well."
Harry drops a kiss to Draco's arm. He rolls away then, settling himself down on the right side of the bed, leaving Draco to his own side, like always. He rests his cheek on his hand. "I bloody love you," he says finally. "I really, really bloody love you."
"It's nice in here," Harry says. He leans back against Draco's desk, legs stretched out. Draco has to work very hard not to react to Harry virtually sitting on his desk; growing up he had been taught very explicitly the rules for climbing and sitting on furniture, and Harry always seems to ignore all of them. There is also something remarkably intimate about sitting this close to Harry's thighs, especially now he's made the move towards better fitting clothes. "It's very you."
“I like giving you sweets. I like how soft you are. I like making you come. I like you being my piglet.”
"If Ginny knows how to turn him back and she hadn't, then yes, he'll still be blue until it fades. I suspect his children love it."
Draco's whole body burns, but he doesn't tell Harry to stop. He follows him in, stands as Harry gets himself comfortable on one of the sofas, unzipping his jeans and pushing them down to mid thigh.
Harry is so good at pulling himself together and moving on to the next conversation like everything's all right, but Draco's starting to see through his mask. "I'd like that. But I'd also like it if we talked about this some more."
"They purr," Draco says, and doesn't make fun of him for his muggle assumptions. "They're nice if you stroke them, too. They're very soft."
“How could I forget,” Draco says, “given that it was the first in a series of disappointments for House Slytherin.”
Then Harry moves. He rolls his hips up and slides his dick further inside of him and covers Draco's little cocklet with his palm. "So little," he says, as he fucks into him, rocking up into him and Draco presses back to meet him, the ache stretching across his skin. "My soft little piglet."
4.30, they'd said, and Draco's been naked since 4.15. It's 5pm. There's pushing the boundaries, and then there's just plain rude.
"I can imagine," Harry says, and maybe he can, because he's reaching down and cupping Draco's little dick through his trousers. "My lovely round piglet."
The jeans go on a smaller, separate washing pile with Harry's other jeans. Then Draco settles himself in Harry's newly cleared red armchair, and picks up the first piece of mending - a shirt with a rip in the sleeve. It's a mixture of Draco's delicate skill with a needle and exquisite charms knowledge that leaves the tear almost invisible afterwards. He tidies up a fray on the cuff too.
"You have no reason to trust me," he says. "I know that. I don't ask you to. But you can trust Harry to tell you if he's happy. So you should ask him if he is. If he feels safe. You should ask him that."
"Of course," Draco says, and he helps Harry out by pouring some milk into a milk jug and positioning on the tray next to the cafetière and two cups and saucers. "How is it that we have cups and saucers in the same meal as you making me serve myself potatoes out of a pan?"
"That's better." Harry sounds lazily satisfied. "Rub yourself off against the rug. No hands. I want to see how desperate you are."
"I do," Harry says. He cups Draco's cheek in his palm. "This weekend. Let me show you exactly what I'm promising."
Harry gets to the bed first, and settles himself back against the pillows, legs up on the sheets. Draco hadn't quite imagined going that far, he'd sort of pictured them perching on the edge because he wasn't dressed properly for bed. Nevertheless, he climbs onto the bed and next to Harry, who immediately curls into Draco's side, much to Draco's surprise. He hovers for a second before wrapping his arms around Harry.
"Down on your knees," Harry says, but Draco's already half way there, heart pounding. "Get that stupid cock out."
Draco keens. "Please," he manages, because there's the blunt touch of a second finger against his hole, and it's teasing, promising, but not pressing inside of him. He wants to open his legs wide and show Harry just how desperate he is, just how needy he is, but Harry's knee is hooked over his, and he's anchored in place. He hadn't ever imagined the wet sound of slick fingers. "I want you inside of me. I want more of you. Please."
"Yes," Harry says. He turns around, leaning up against the table but making no move to come back over to the sofa. He folds his arms.
Harry leans even closer in this time, until his mouth is brushing Draco's ear. There's a pop as both their muffliato charms fall away under a flick of Harry's wrist. "I'll make you feel like you're nothing more than a hole for me to fuck," he says, not even bothering to lower his voice. "Two holes," he goes on. "Just a thing for me to use."
"Or if you must wear it," Harry goes on, like he wasn't paying any attention to Draco at all, "I'm going to pick it from now on. Frills, I think. Satin. Lace. Pink. The more humiliating the better, don't you think?"
"Oh, I know that," Harry says. "Everyone knows that. You're begging for it. You're begging strangers for it. Bet you'd beg Ron for it if I told you to."
His jaw aches a little and he shifts a little, letting his mouth fall open. He hears the tap of cutlery against the plate. His cock throbs. He wants so badly to rub himself off, to come because he's right where he should be, on his knees, forgotten, servicing someone who's busy doing something else. Useless, out of sight, out of mind, with spit running down his chin. It's just where he wants to be.
Draco folds up his clothes and leaves them on the seat. It's not that warm in here yet; the fire hasn't been burning long and it crackles in the grate, but the room is slow to heat up. He gets down on his knees, facing away from Harry, and leans down so his cheek's pressed to the carpet. He does as he's been taught, moving his legs apart and then reaching behind him so that he can hold his arse cheeks apart with his hands, presenting his hole for approval.
"I'm only good for my holes," he says, and then, without changing position, he reaches underneath him so he can cup his useless little dick in his fist, and he wanks himself until he comes on the tiles, right there in the entrance hall where his parents used to stand.
Draco has heard of this happening, but he's never known anyone where their mother was the main breadwinner. He can't help but wonder if his mother would have been happier if she'd been able to focus on something other than Draco's failure to position himself in the marriage mart over the past decade.
Draco whines, unable to help himself. He sticks his tongue out more, letting it hang out of his mouth like an animal.
"Piglets don't," Harry says matter-of-factly, but Draco can feel Harry's erection pressing against the small of his back. "Do you eat from bowls on the floor?"
"Indeed," Harry says, and he steps up onto the stool. "Maybe you'll have to come with me next time."
"Put me in one of those nappies," Harry says. "I want to know what it feels like. Here. Now. I can't go on not knowing. And I can't not ask anymore."
Draco shakes his head. Harry has it all wrong. He's not scared about losing his virginity. He's scared that he won't. "I want to," he says, because trying to articulate the confusion in his head is too difficult, and because Harry's never led him wrong before. "I want to so much."
"That's all right," Harry says. "But shush for a minute. I just want you to look in the mirror and see you for you are. My dirty, filthy, needy piglet."
Harry gives him half a smile. "I dunno," he says. "I used to watch you on that map all the fucking time. I didn't watch anyone else."
By 'civilised', Harry very clearly means 'hand-fed a naked Draco cream horns on his kitchen floor', but to all intents and purposes he seems very laid back and casual with his interpretation of the truth.
And Draco, desperate, humiliated, and so turned on he can barely see straight, cries out, and comes.
He dresses carefully the following evening, perfecting the same glamour as the night before and choosing middle of the road clothes that don't identify him as particularly rich or particularly Draco Malfoy-esque. He eats a small meal of soup and fresh bread before leaving, and then steps over the stain on the tiles as he goes to put on his coat. He has no intention of cleaning it up any time soon; he deserves to be reminded of how far he's willing to fall.
Draco wakes up first in the morning, and he has to extricate himself carefully in order not to disturb Harry from his sleep. He loses himself in the bathroom for a few minutes, morning absolutions to take care of, and then he dresses with an attention for detail, black trousers with the dark green stripe along the seam, matching black shirt. His underwear with
Something like electricity crackles over Draco's skin. He's learnt about electricity now, how it powers muggle houses. He's learnt a lot.
Draco follows suit, sliding in next to him, and they pull the covers up and over them even as Harry's moving closer and his dick's pressing up against Draco's hip. So much skin. They're touching everywhere, pressed together from shoulder to hip to knee. Their feet entwine under the covers. Harry's breath is hot against his cheek. Draco's never been this physically close to anyone in his whole entire life.
"Yes. My father liked to hide his money in things. Objects. And it turns out, places. We made a big song and dance about selling the Manor but it turns out we had all these other places. My mother hates Scotland. We barely ever went. I never wanted to go by myself, after."
Harry leads them inside, down the hall and down a flight of steps until they're in a long kitchen. On the table is a pot of tea, two mugs, and a flimsy cardboard box.
"Absolutely not," Harry agrees. He elbows Draco, and it's only semi-awkward. "Anyway, next time you can come and be the person laughing at me as I'm trying on clothes. If you'd like."
"Go like that," Harry says, wandering into Draco's bedroom fifteen minutes later. The wards have let him in without complaint.
Draco, for want of a degree of self preservation, went into the patisserie and bought the cake. Then, with even less self preservation and a strange sense of
Marks and Spencer is a confusing place, full of oddly shaped clothes and things that show off far too much skin for a respectable witch or wizard.
Harry leads him over to the tree at the side of the garden, half way up the slope. He leans against the trunk, and tugs on the lead. "Cock a leg, Piglet."
"Love sweets," Draco says, panting. In the mirror he’s a flushed, panting mess. Come’s in his hair and on his cheeks and lips, smeared across his skin. There’s stains on his shirt collar. "Greedy piglet."
And Harry, flushed pink and breathless, still coming down from his orgasm, bites his lip and smiles.
Draco knows he's getting hard. If it wasn't for the cushion Harry's laying on in Draco's lap, he'd know.
It's a different tack to anything Harry's tried before, to put his mind at rest about dinner with Hermione. Telling him.
"You want strangers to come in your mouth, and on your face. You want them to use you. I'll get you a queue. Tell them to ignore you, if you want."
"I'm nothing," Draco says, even as he's taking off his sweater, loosening his tie, and unbuttoning his shirt. "Just holes."
"I see the problem," Harry says. "My piglet's tiny cocklet is too stiff to piss. Is it the possibility that someone could see you? Could see that you're nothing more than an animal?"
Draco's hand tightens around his hairbrush. He doesn't meet Harry's eyes in the mirror as he neatens his hair.
He crawls forward, heart pounding. He's never done anything like this, never been down on his knees for anything other than sucking cock or being a rag for someone else's come. This, though, being on his knees because that's the level he should be at, this feels different, and good, and right.
Harry flushes at that. "I feel like it’s right," he says. "I feel like when it’s you and me, what we do, it feels like it’s right."
Draco burns with it, with need, with want, with… something beyond affection. When Harry looks over his shoulder at him, grinning, Draco wants to drop down on his knees right there and then and take his cock in his mouth. Instead, he walks a little behind Harry, just beyond his shoulder.
So Draco does, he uses his come as slick, Harry's hand covering his own until they're both wanking Harry off and Draco just wants to keep on kissing him for as long as he's allowed.
"You've had too much control over that silly little thing," Harry goes on, stroking Draco's hair, touching his face, letting Draco nuzzle closer. "Do you think you should have control over anything? Should horny little piglets be able to control when they come?"
There's something there, Draco can tell. A bit more of the jigsaw. Pieces he didn't have before. Harry's testing the waters, but for what, Draco doesn't know. "You can talk to me," he says finally. "You can tell me about it. You can even tell me which bits are supposed to be the funny bits so I'll laugh."
Harry strokes his hand through Draco's hair, forceful enough that Draco tilts his chin up to meet his gaze.
or had any particular source for society gossip; part of being shunned for the whole of his twenties did rather leave one out in the cold when it came to being in touch with the latest things. There had been that whole expectation thing that Potter would end up married to Miss Weasley, with a whole parcel of tiny sproglets by this point. Except Ginny was off touring with her Quidditch team, and Harry Potter was picking up boys in bars and hand feeding old enemies cream cakes whilst they presented their arsehole for comment, so clearly something had detoured from the path of least resistance over the years.
and they start to have a conversation about where they're going next, about their mate Tim copping off with a skinny twink with colour-changing hair, and the whole time Draco's sucking him off, and it's like he's not even there. It's like he doesn't matter, like he's just there to be used, and a thrill surges through his body, because this feeling,
"Both," Harry says promptly, and smiles at him. "Honestly, Draco, it's just my friends. We'll eat some food, have a drink, come home again. What could possibly be terrible about that?"
"In my defence," Draco says, "I always show the capabilities of my charms to my clients, and Miss Weasley was aware of this when we agreed to user testing."
"They are," Harry agrees. There's a pause. "I think the ones downstairs were softer. I think you deserve soft things."
"No," he says finally. "The wards will be to your specifications." The warmth of the coin in his pocket makes him want to slide his hand in and steal its heat. "I'll return at the end of the week, as arranged."
"You dribbled on the floor," Harry says, pointing down at Draco's softened cock, even smaller now he isn't hard, and the little spots of come on the hardwood.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Monster," he says, but it sounds mostly affectionate. He leans his elbows on the counter, lazily casual in Draco’s space. Draco feels quite warm inside.
"Your horror is worth the expense alone," Harry says, sliding the tray down the table and sitting down. He starts dividing the portions out so they have a small box each, a carton of chips, and a drink. The third box is 'chicken nuggets', and Harry invites him to 'dig in'.
A guy comes through and asks Draco if he wants to suck his dick. It's a little casual, a little lazy, and Draco doesn't want that. He only wants people to be casual with
Harry's face softens. He slips his hand into Draco's, lacing their fingers together. "All right. Come and have dinner with me. I've planned a nice evening for us. Romantic, you know?"
Draco goes pink before he even says anything. "I wake up stiff," he says. "Every day I wake up and my little cock is hard. So I rub it against the sheets until I come."
Draco hums. He presses his tongue to the underside of Harry's cock, but Harry just rolls his eyes, pulling out.
Harry hums. "It's likely she's building up a picture," he says finally. "She knows we've talked. That we're still talking. She's fairly certain she knows I've started seeing someone. I think there's a good chance she'll slide it into conversation tomorrow evening when I'm over for dinner." There's a pause. "Is that all right? That she knows?"
"I thought you might be," Draco says, and he pours them both a small glass of the red wine. It needs more time to breathe, but it would do. He sits down next to Harry, and Harry bumps his knee into Draco's.
"Yes," Draco says. It's oddly awkward between them, and it's probably because they started their relationship upside down and back to front, and never did this at the point Draco suspects people in relationships are supposed to get to know each other.
"And anyway, it all sort of got swept away with the whole, you know, Voldemort chosen one thing, and fighting evil from the age of eleven. All sort of overshadowed the bits that came before. And during, you know."
"I think we can run to that," Harry says, and then, somehow, there's some kind of spell that leaves Draco feeling like he's just touched by a warm breeze, and they're both naked in front of the mirror. The clothes are gone, Harry's too.
Harry snorts a laugh. "I'd fucking love to," he says, and he leans right in to press his mouth to Draco's again. "Get that useless little cock out. Let me watch you wank yourself stupid over cake."
He checks his pocket watch. It's only just past four, so he can't give in and stop work yet. Harry won't be here until seven, and Draco has had enough time off recently that there's a backlog of correspondence.
He comes back a few minutes later, dutifully having failed to put his tie back on, but with a tray with the wine, two glasses, and a selection of sun-dried tomatoes, olives, oils, sliced fresh bread, tiny mozzarella balls, and balsamic vinegar. It wasn't that he hadn't eaten, but a small bowl of soup felt a little like a lie, especially when the box of chocolates he'd treated himself to was going to be the main course. Harry had taken his shoes and coat off, but where he'd magicked them away to, Draco couldn't tell. His jumper was one of his new ones, a deep burgundy, and his trousers slim-fitting and the right length. A book rests on the arm of the sofa closest to Harry. His socks are bright blue and have tiny octopuses on. Draco hadn't signed off on those, he'd have remembered.
Harry points lazily to the arm of the sofa. "Rub yourself off on that," he says, and Draco must look confused because Harry's expression turns exasperated. "You don't get to touch. If you want to come, you rut against the sofa." He waves his hand towards the door. "If you don't want to come, you know where the door is."
"Will he be right?" Ginny asks. The long hair she had at school is gone, and instead she has short, tufty red hair, curled up at the front into a quiff. As an adult, Draco hasn't been around many women with short hair, and he wonders if this pre-dates her relationship breakdown with Harry. His mother had thoughts about short hair and societal expectations, and the value of Draco's virginity. She was wrong about that, though, and he suspects there's a whole world out there of families that aren't crippled by the weight of expectation.
"Water," Harry says. There's a jug on the side, and Draco opens the cupboards until he finds the glasses and the plates. He pours Harry a glass and takes it over to the table. Harry doesn't say thank you, barely acknowledging his existence. There's a magazine on the table, another Muggle one. Harry never seems to have a copy of the
"You make me feel like I'm loved. Like you know me, and you love me anyway. That's not stifling." He struggles to find the words. "It's like you're giving me the world. It's the opposite of stifling. You're the opposite of stifling. I used to be so alone, Harry, you have no idea. But I'm not anymore. I'm not anymore because of you."
Draco has been obsessed with being the centre of Harry's attention since he was eleven years old. It didn't stop with adulthood, or with them not seeing each other in years. It just got hidden somewhere, underneath, out of sight.
"Shut up," the man says, and he leans in and strokes his finger over Draco's hole. "Only good for your holes, aren't you? Tell me. You're only good for your holes."
"Only you could like something so humiliating, Piglet," Harry tells him, but now he's rolling the tip of Draco's little cock between his thumb and finger and Draco pants his desperation into the chilled sea air. "Only you could want something so dirty. Could want to come like this, being masturbated whilst harnessed up like an animal. Because that's what you are, isn't it? Just my animal. My dirty, horny little piglet. Going to come on the grass, are you? My pet Piglet. Property of Harry Potter. All mine, Piglet. Every last bit of you. Every humiliated, desperate last bit of you."
He's not worthy of attention, and the humiliation settles on his skin like a cloak. He's made to be this invisible. Born to be used and ignored. Even his heartbeat seems to slow, the world slipping away as he stays on his knees and lets himself be forgotten.
Draco is suddenly hard. Again. He spends most of his time around Harry hard. "Whatever you need," he says finally, and Harry nods.
And then, after a final check in the mirror to remove any imperfections, he goes back into the bedroom and kneels by Harry's side of the bed, and slides his hand into Harry's hair to wake him up.
Draco is in his underwear; he's standing in the middle of his room in his vest, pants, and socks. Harry has laughed at his underwear before, telling him that his underpants were so long they were practically trousers, but then Harry thought going outside in a
"I can give you what you need," Harry says, leaning across the table. There's a muffliato charm on their table, probably two since Draco is fairly sure Harry's put one on too, but it doesn't stop Harry from leaning even closer. "I can make you feel as ashamed and humiliated and turned on as you want. I'll take you to those back rooms. I'll tell you to get your cock out and show it off to anyone who wants to laugh at it. And they will laugh at it, won't they? They'll laugh at you, for being so fucking desperate you're begging for it off strangers. And then I'll take you home, and I'll give you everything you want, every filthy thing in your head. You can have it."
Harry can’t have had much time to find his way around Draco’s house, but he must have made some fairly quick headway because he leads Draco to a room in the far corner that Draco barely remembers seeing before, let alone ever sitting in. It’s carpeted in red, with long windows looking out over the grounds and towards the deserted owlery, out towards the Quidditch pitch. The sofas are old fashioned and can’t have come from the manor, so they’re probably left over from the laird’s time here. They’re certainly staid enough. There’s a lot of dark brown. Despite its clear lack of use, the room smells clean and looks relatively fresh, which is another point in the favour of the House Elf company Draco picked entirely at random to take care of his houses.
"And you couldn't show me quick enough. Desperate, you were." He pauses. "Show it to me now, again. Take down the glamour and show it to me again."
His scarf is on the floor in the hall at home, fallen off the hook in the hall cupboard. He'd never even taken it with him. He holds it in his hand for a minute before folding it up and putting it back into the cupboard.
He sticks his tongue out, and tightens his grip on Harry's cock as he wanks him off, and then, between one panted breath and the next, Harry's hips jerk forwards and he's coming. He comes in stripes across Draco's face, catching his mouth, his tongue, his cheeks, his eyelashes. He marks Draco like he's his own, and Draco is. He really, really is. He leans back so that he can look up and meet Harry's gaze, and then he smears Harry's come across his face. He smears it everywhere, and he doesn't look away.
"Don’t ask," Draco says, as Harry makes a questioning face at a giraffe staring out of one of the filthy windows.
He buckles Draco's leather collar closed, testing its tightness by sliding a finger beneath Draco's skin and the collar. He must be satisfied with it, because he clips the lead onto the collar.
"How long have you been awake? You're all dressed and everything." His gaze sweeps Draco up and down, and then settles on Draco's collar. "And everything," he says, reaching out to touch it with his fingertips.
He must have cast warming charms over the tiles, because neither of them are shivering to death on the cold kitchen floor. When Draco opens his eyes, the mirrors are both gone.
He lets go of Draco's dick then, and Draco whines at the lack of contact, but he licks his fingers clean of chocolate and watches as Harry gets a carrier bag out of a drawer.
"For me?" Harry looks a little uncertain, and there's quite a strong probability that he's readying himself to bolt. Draco doesn't allow his expression to change.
Harry shifts in his arms. "When I first saw you," he says, "you were crying out for this. You needed it so desperately it was coming off you in waves. You think I haven’t seen that part of you? You think I don’t know you at all?"
"You don't have to talk about the intricacies of what you want tonight," Draco says. "But maybe we can talk about how loved you are instead."
Harry curls in a little closer. When he speaks again, it’s a little muffled against Draco’s chest. "Why won’t you tell me if you want to be with me?"
"No," Draco says, but he's burning red just thinking about it. He eats more cake from Harry's fingers.
"I'd like that," Harry says, and when Draco looks down, Harry's vanished the nappy. His wandless magic far outstrips Draco's, but Draco can't find it in himself to be overtly jealous. He'd put that one to bed a long time ago. Harry is spectacular in all manner of ways, not least in his erection, which is magnificent, and pressed against Draco's thigh. "Malfoy, my darling, will you let me take you to bed?"
“Good,” Harry says, and he downs the rest of his tea before standing up and picking up the plate of cakes. “We can eat these in bed.”
After Harry leaves the room, it takes Draco a lot longer than it should to stand up and get started.
Draco's hands twitch. He reaches for his wand, then stops himself. "It's the cottage," he says softly, then he glances up at Harry. "It's for the cottage."
"You'd beg for it," Harry goes on, hand moving furiously. "You'd beg me for anything so long as you got cock out of it."
Hermione kicks him in the ankle. "Ronald," she says. "Honestly, shut up. You're showing yourself up."
Harry looks more enthusiastic than Draco had expected. “Bloody love the sea,” Harry tells him, clambering to his feet. “Never really got to go when I was little, they always left me at home when they were going on holiday.”
"I'd like that," Draco says, still uncommonly tired. He closes his eyes. He'll just rest them for a moment.
"Unfortunate thing to smell of," Draco says. "Was it as bad as you're making it sound? Living with them?"
"Maybe," Harry says, in a non-committal kind of a way. He slips his hand into Draco's. "Did I get your attention?"
There's a fresh tingle of a cleaning spell then, and whilst it's not Draco's preferred form of cleanliness, the sticky, slick, dirty remains of the cake is gone from his skin, and from Harry's too. The cakes themselves are vanished.
Draco opens his eyes. Hesitantly, he wraps an arm around Harry’s shoulders, keeping him close, and Harry doesn’t push him away. “What do you mean?”
"Philistine," Draco says, and attempts to keep the affection out of his voice. It turns out he's not marvellous at it, particularly whilst distracted with tea and cake. He doesn't look at Harry, just cuts him a slice and pours him some tea. Then he does the same, and sits back on the sofa so that their knees are almost touching. The cake is rich with chocolate layers and cherries and cream, and the scent of it is rich with alcohol.
. "Sometimes I do it right in the office, or in the sitting room. I don't always make it to the bedroom."
"Good," Harry says, like their conversation is completely normal and all right and isn't setting Draco's world just off kilter. "I'll get one for you."
"Cake, mostly," Harry says, which may or may not be a lie. Draco shivers. "And a well packed broom. And, you know. Other stuff."
Nobody in the room comments on what teenage Draco was actually busy doing, which Draco is thankful for. It wasn't his finest decade. So far, none of them have been that great, although the past few weeks have nudged this one up the leaderboard.
And after a while, Draco stops trembling and starts shivering instead, so Harry helps him to his feet, and into the bedroom. He dresses Draco, even though he's undressed too, and it's Draco's job to make sure that Harry's looked after. He won't take no for an answer, even putting Draco's socks on for him, until he's in his trousers and his shirt and his jumper and warm again. Then Harry pulls on his soft, elasticated trousers, and a t-shirt and a sweater, and finds a pair of socks in his bag.
"You're looking after me," Harry says. There's a peculiar tone to it, but Draco doesn't let himself react. He puts the book down on the bed, close to Harry's hand, and goes to explore Harry's particularly terrible wardrobe and drawers.
When Harry follows him in, he's lost his knitted sweater, and is holding a little jar in one hand and the lid in the other. He sets it down on the chest of drawers, next to a flowered bowl on a little lace doily. Like the rest of the house, it must have been very much as Harry had found it when he'd first moved in.
And Draco obeys, hooking his arms under his knees and drawing them up to his chest, keeping his legs open so his cock and balls and hole are on display. He makes eye contact with Harry and shame courses through him like a flood.
"Yeah," Harry says. "Family even without the blood. Me and Hermione and Ron had been through too much not to pretty much be bound for life, anyway. And now there are Rose and Hugo. Ron stays at home with them. He's a brilliant dad."
Draco's skin burns. He keeps his gaze fixed on Harry, who's sitting back in his chair, lazy, one leg stretched out, his cock hard.
"Yes. I recognise some commands but I don't think I understand the words. Just the sounds. But I know when you want me to sit back and come on me. It happens a lot."
"What about you?" Draco asks sulkily. He's eaten a nice roast dinner and a nice lemon tart with cream for dessert, and finished it off with more wine and a cup of coffee and a strictly limited two mint chocolates. He's briefly met two sleepy, shy children with sticky-up hair who call Harry
Harry shudders with it. Draco reaches for him, a little unsure if he should, a little careful, but Harry kisses him back, breathless against his mouth. He kisses him, again and again, and Draco can feel Harry's hand moving on his cock, bumping up against his thigh, but Harry doesn't pull away. He just kisses him over again. The butterflies in Draco's chest feel alive.
He whines at that too, at this blanket permission for something Draco's never, ever had, and never allowed himself to wish for.
"Go home and wank," the man says, and then he disappears back out of the door and into the main bar.
spell under his breath. It's another few moments before the familiar whoosh of something flying through the air and hitting Harry's palm with a smack. "Stay," Harry warns, one hand to the back of Draco's head, Draco's nose still touching the floor. "Going to put your collar on."
"Creepy, right?" Harry says. "At least that’s what Hermione said. And it would never work for an actual class of Muggle kids, so I retired it and, you know, made it into a keyring. Like I said. I never actually expected to see you."
"Do you want to come over here so I can put my cock in one of your holes? That's what you are, isn't it? Just holes."
The Quidditch pitch is almost as invisible to the world as the house, possibly more so because it’s got Draco’s more recent charms work in it, but that doesn’t stop them being right in the middle of a wide open space, even if the trees do surround the edges of the pitch. Draco glances around them.
"Yes," Draco says, and when he turns around, there's a box of Fondant Fancies right where the truffles had been earlier, and Harry's arm has slipped around his waist. "It is."
The night before, he'd ended up with a face smeared with cream and sugar and flakes of pastry as he'd attempted to eat a cream horn out of Harry's hand. Harry, clearly bored, had taken to fingering the tip of his finger in and out of Draco's arsehole -- the first person to ever touch him there -- and Draco had disgraced himself by coming on the floor before the cream horn was even finished.
Draco tilts his chin up. "I'm sorry," he says, even though there hadn't been instructions in Harry's hastily scrawled note that afternoon. "I'm sorry, sir."
Harry, thankfully, doesn't focus on the fact that Draco has nobody. Or on the fact that his mother was so disappointed by how Draco fared on the marriage mart that she removed to the continent. He dips some of the bread into the little dish of olive oil instead, and takes a bite. "I'm going to tell Hermione we're taking it slowly," he says, before dipping the remainder of the bread into the balsamic vinegar. "That I'm careful about what we are, because it's important to me."
When Harry disappears into the bedroom, Draco stands up to remove the rest of his clothes so he can be Harry's round little piglet. He folds up his discarded clothes and then gets back down on his knees, except this time it's hands and knees, and his head's bowed. His little cocklet hangs down, a tiny stiffy with a tiny blurt of pre-come dripping from the slit.
"I do," Draco says, and steps back so that Harry can come in. He closes the door after Harry, and the series of locks whirr away to themselves as the magic works like clockwork. Harry glances at him.
It's barely five minutes before he's finished and going downstairs to the kitchen, but Harry's waiting for him, seated at the head of the table.
Harry shakes his head. "Not today," he says, which is indication if indication were required that Harry is distinctly overwhelmed.
Draco expects Harry to tell him to take his clothes off, but instead, Harry just steps into Draco's space, cups his face in his hand, and kisses him softly.
"Collar," Harry says, and Draco obediently holds his hand out so that Harry can come over and take it from him. He holds it gently. "I like putting this on you."
He knows he doesn't deserve it. He's never deserved any of it. It doesn't mean he doesn't want it with every last fibre of his being.
There's one that's a red tartan on the outside, and white fleecy fur on the inside. Harry runs his hand over the fleece. "Maybe Piglet needs to learn his place," he says, and adds the tartan pet bed to Draco's pile.
"Pointless," Draco says, and he can't fucking figure out if he's hard because Harry's telling him he can eat sweets or because he can't fuck and has to suck dick instead, but either way it's fucked up. He's a mess, it's all a mess, and Harry never ever looks at him like any of it is.
"If it is, we're both going down with it." He helps himself to some, and then sits down. "Families are tiring, and they don't know you like I know you. But they're trying. Very trying, in some cases. Bloody Hermione turning up like that."
"My soft, happy piglet," Harry says, "so indulged." He leans in and kisses Draco's mouth again, too brief for anything other than Draco to moan and try to arch up to meet his mouth in another kiss, but Harry pulls back. "I'll indulge you, Piglet. I'll indulge you and indulge you and indulge you. Give you every depraved thing you want. Make you feel so humiliated you won't even need to beg for more. Show you and that tiny cocklet off in public so that everyone can see that you're mine. You're
Harry reaches down and into the pocket of his jeans. He gets out the coin that he’s been using to contact Draco, and a second one, but this one has a little hole in it and is attached to a door key. "My charms are only mediocre," he says. "Not like yours."
Draco loves every second of it. He comes on the tiles, and Harry sighs, then tells him he'd better clean up his mess.
"We should go to Dorset, when we've got a free day," Harry says a minute later, from somewhere inside their hug. "That glass studio I told you about. We can pick something out for your mum. Put it in an order so we can start making plans."
Draco whines, desperate, and Harry starts to come. He comes mostly in Draco's mouth, over his lips and his tongue, and it catches his cheeks and his jaw too. He tries to lick it up. He's a come-whore. A come-hungry little piglet, and he wants to fucking come.
Harry's hand strokes over the curve of his bum and down to cup his balls. "I could immobilise you here," he whispers, and the hairs on Draco's arms stand up on end as Harry leans in and blows a warm breath across his skin. "Like a statue, like you're part of the furniture. Like you're nothing but something to walk by and ignore."
Harry doesn't even wait for him to finish before pulling off and clambering to his feet. Draco's little cock is still pulsing, forgotten, even as Harry covers Draco's mouth with his own. He hasn't swallowed; Draco's come is still in Harry's mouth and Draco tastes it eagerly, always, always wanting to be dirtier, to be filthier, for the humiliation to be
"Settle down," Harry says again, still stroking Draco's hair, and Draco can't, he's too close to the edge and it feels too much like his insides are clamouring to get out. "Just stay still, Piglet, and keep my cock warm."
"A hole," Draco says, and he wants so desperately to rut against something, make himself come. Even the floor would do despite the chill. "A rag for your come. Nothing."
Harry hums. He's still stroking Draco's hair, but sometimes his fingers dip lower, over the collar of Draco's shirt and down over his back. "I think we did too."
"There are some people," Miss Weasley says to him, "that hold me accountable for Harry's broken heart. And they're willing to let me know by any means possible to them."
"It's really not," Draco says. He closes his eyes again. "I liked that," he says finally. "What we just did."
Draco very deliberately doesn't allow himself to move. "I'll call you whatever you want to be called. And you don't have to decide now. It can be a placeholder."
Draco's ordered a new frame, but he hasn't told Harry and he can't imagine a situation where he can give it to him. The order's still been sent, though, and when he stands in the entrance to the room early on Saturday afternoon, shirt sleeves rolled up, the room looks different. It looks cleaner and fresher, empty of all Harry's belongings bar the furniture. He's changed the layout, changed where the bed is and the wardrobes so that the light is better.
Draco would shiver if he could, but he can't. He lies there, holes out. His cock leaks. Drool dribbles down onto the rug.
"They're pyjamas," Draco says again, because he doesn't have anything for Harry right now that isn't that.
"Was that all right, what we did?" Harry asks finally, once the tea is finished and the cups are back on the little coffee table. "It wasn't too far?"
his bag across the room and gets out a small stack of books that he unshrinks back to normal size, helping himself to a cup of tea from the pot. He arranges himself so that he's comfortable, book on the arm of the sofa, one knee up so he's got a foot on Draco's mother's best sofa, the cup of tea resting next to him on the cushion.
"One day I'll fuck you," Harry goes on, "use you like you're supposed to be used. But not today. Today you're nothing."
Harry wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders. "Hold on," he says, and then the air's swirling around them and they're whipped away, whipped away from the little alleyway in central London, and are back in Draco's flat instead, inside the vestibule where the permissible guest wards start.
"Yes," Draco says. "Blankets and bottles, you said." There's a pause. "You know I'll be learning too, right? It's not like I've ever had much contact with babies and small children."
He's never been big, always on the smaller side of average when soft, but whilst some people get bigger when hard, he's not one of them. His dick's small, and the second time he goes out, he kneels down in the back corridor and gets his dick out and one guy tells him his dick's fucking tiny. That he'd better have a good mouth on him or no one would ever go near him.
Harry, still flushed, agrees, and trails after Draco to the window seat with his blanket and dragons in hand. He lets Draco tuck him into his side though, still in his pyjamas but with his too-big red jumper falling down over his hands. Draco finishes the story and asks Harry if he'd like to start the next one, which has virtually no pictures and will take an age to read.
He looks up at Harry then, who's sitting with his legs spread and the line of his cock obvious in his pyjama trousers. And then he lifts his hand, the one he's just wanked himself with, and he licks it until it's wet with spit and clean of come and pre-come.
Heathen clearly doesn't think very much of Draco, which is perhaps understandable considering Draco's concerted attempt to blend into the background - he's wearing a pair of
The guy fucking Harry doesn't last much longer either, but Harry doesn't come. When the guy pulls out, snapping off a condom and chucking it on the floor, Harry's still hard. He waits a minute, breathless, braced against the wall, and then he comes over to where Draco's waiting and crouches down. It looks like it aches.
“She mostly knew how to be nice to cats,” Harry says, heading for the door. “I think she liked me, though. It made a change. Didn’t mean it was necessarily a fair exchange for a holiday by the sea.”
Draco doesn't know how to answer that. He wants to be looked after, he wants to be given the chance to be blessedly, happily obedient. He wants to be loved, to be petted, to be be humiliated by wanting to be treated like something less than human. "I just want it."
Harry sounds amused. "Of course you did," he says. "Do it again tonight, and you can tell me about it tomorrow." He gets another card out of his pocket, the same black card stock as last night. "Come to this address at 4 o'clock."
“Should I let you on the bed for once, do you think?” Harry asks, smearing cream into Draco’s hair. “Do you deserve that, my stupid piggy?”
Draco opens his legs, slick dripping out of him and down over his thighs. That ointment has to be fucking charmed; Draco is going to figure out the spell and make so much of it that he'll be wet all the time. It makes him breathless just to think about it.
Draco looks at him. "You think you want to be with me," he says carefully, focusing on the key parts of the last few minutes.
Draco, happily obedient, gets to his feet and goes to join Harry on the rug by the window. "I don't know what to do."
When he gets home, he barely gets through the wards before he's dropping down onto his knees and wanking, shuddering his orgasm out into his fist, desperate and nothing and shamed.
"It doesn't have to be a big thing," Harry says. "We could just try it like this for a bit, here even, or in London at mine, and then, if it's awful, we never have to do it again. I might not even like it." He sounds a little desperate, and Draco is fairly certain that Harry's going to like it, and that he wants it, and that he needs it. Like Draco needs what he gets from the two of them. How his life's better for it.
Harry's smile widens. He lifts his glass of beer, and taps it against Draco's. "Here's to a hundred more weekends away."
He wants to weep, and they haven't even started yet. "I'm yours," he says, and his voice catches a little, small enough that he can't hide it.
Harry runs his fingers through Draco's hair. Draco's still: he's warming Harry's cock until Harry tells him to do otherwise.
Afterwards, Harry drops down to his knees and wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders. "Are you all right?"
Harry’s smile is crooked. "If you’d like," he says. Is that another piece of the jigsaw puzzle? There’s something about Draco wanting to look after Harry that’s supposed to tell him something, but he just can’t figure out what it is.
Draco nods. He can, both in the mirror and in his mind's eye. "I always come here," he says. "There's a stain."
Draco remembers. His cocklet leaks. His face burns with the shame of how much he'd wanted it, how much of a mess it had been, what he'd looked like in the mirrors Harry had conjured so he could see the extent of his humiliation.
"I'm trying. Please. All that time before my mother left, and that whole time afterwards, when I first started going out wearing the glamour, I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. I wanted it so badly. I needed it. I was crying out for it and I'd never been able to satiate any of that. It helped, going out. Getting people to use me. I'd been denying myself something that I'd needed for so long. But it wasn't ever as good as when I started doing it with you."
“Did I get it right?” Harry asks later, when Draco’s drifting in and out of sleep, even though he’s never gone to sleep naked and he should get up and put some pyjamas on. “Was that what you wanted?”
"Have that little cocklet locked away so you can't masturbate on the furniture?" Draco nods again, knowing he's already getting hard and blushing because of it. "Good boy," Harry says, stroking his hair again. "Good piglet. I brought some toys in case you wanted to play. A collar and a lead and a harness."
He sounds, Draco thinks, like he’s fishing. Draco prepares the milk jug and the sugar bowl, even though neither of them take sugar. A good host always provides a range. There are some biscuits in the tin that he can arrange onto a plate. "Like what?"
"Roast salmon. It's a Jamie Oliver recipe, one that Hermione found. If she can make it without fucking it up, then I can too.
"Hurry up," Harry says, and then there's only one bit of chicken left, and bread, and he's still chewing the bread as he sits back on his heels.
Draco gets up off the floor, wraps himself in his dark green robe, and gets the charmed coin out of the little bowl on his bedside table. It's not very big and they don't have much space for words - something Draco really needs to work on, given his charms skills - so he settles for
“So soft everywhere, aren’t you, my piggy? Thighs. Bum. Belly. Tits.” He keeps running his hands over Draco’s skin, down to his thighs, up over his stomach and up to his nipples again. He’s taking his clothes off as he touches Draco. “Cake-soft.”
"I'll make it," Draco says, because he wants to give Harry time to explore without being under Draco's watchful eye.
without saying yes out loud. Harry is back to touching his lip with his fingertip, and Draco licks at him, a hesitant
. Draco's never heard of it. He glances at Harry for approval, which Harry gives him with the smallest of nods. Harry is still holding his dragons, though, which Draco counts as a success overall.
"The water coming down on you like rain," Harry says, fingertips trailing across his skin. "Why on your knees, Draco?"
"As if I would. Anyway, come on. The coffee will be there before us and then you won't appreciate my present."
Harry taps Draco's thigh with the toe of his shoe. "Don't fucking wank," he says. He turns back to the guy. "Can't take him anywhere." He pauses. "You want a go?"
Draco nods. He takes another sip of wine. There's a fire in the grate, very carefully guarded so that there's no chance of a stray ember catching alight. One of the reasons Draco had gone into charms and wards professionally was because of the sheer amount of work he'd undertaken after being caught in the fire at school; endless nightmares keeping up in the middle of the night, countless hours where he'd read everything he could possibly read about fire charms instead of going back to sleep.
So Draco does. He lies, full length, on the kitchen floor, dick pressed into a destroyed, sat-on cake, resting on his elbows. And then he leans in and takes another bite, not even trying for delicate, getting cake smeared all over his face. A chocolate star gets stuck to his lip. Some of the icing gets on his nose. The noises he's making are humiliating. He's like a pig at a trough. He's sticky and dirty and he's hard, he's
"They look like books to me," Draco says. "Would you like me to read you one of these after breakfast?"
Draco does feel ashamed. He feels shame right down to the tips of his toes. It just makes him harder. It makes him want it more.
"Technically," Draco says, "I didn't turn Ron Weasley blue. Ron Weasley turned himself blue by violating the wards at his sister's house."
Draco makes a big show of rolling his eyes, but inside he's less sure. Harry had chosen his own family, all those years ago when they'd started Hogwarts, and he hadn't chosen Draco. He'd had good reason, and Draco didn't hold his decision against him, but that didn't mean that dinner was going to be easy, or that Harry's friends would accept their relationship. Particularly if Harry had let slip any of what they got up to whilst alone.
He doesn’t open his eyes until afterwards, when Harry’s untying his hands and pressing his thumbs to the insides of Draco’s wrists. Harry’s mouth follows his thumbs, a slow kiss pressed to each of Draco’s hands.
Draco can't fuck anything. He can't fuck Harry. He's just a piglet, just holes, just something to be used when useful, and ignored the rest of the time. Heat thrums through him.
Draco cries out, his hips rocking forward. He fucks his cocklet into the cake, Harry controlling it, controlling him. The cream goes everywhere. The sponge and the chocolate are so soft and moist and slick, and he's fucking his cocklet into a chocolate cake and watching himself in the mirror, and it's probably the dirtiest thing he's ever done, or imagined doing, in his whole entire life.
Harry touches three of the sets in turn. "Not much give in these," he says. "They don't look very comfortable."
Draco sits back down, and settles his teacup neatly on its saucer. “There’s nothing to be embarrassed about,” he says. “It’s a nursery and it’s yours. Let’s not waste our lives distressing ourselves unnecessarily. Don’t be embarrassed about wanting to be looked after.”
"Course I want to, you idiot. I spend half my wanking time imagining fucking you in front of the mirror so you can see."
"It is," Harry agrees. His hand is hot in Draco’s. "Me and Ginny didn’t break up yesterday, you know. It wasn’t even this year. We’ve been together and we’ve been apart and it’s been so long we’ve cycled through everything. Christmas and Halloween and birthdays and summer and other people’s weddings. She’s my family and I love her, but I don’t want to be with her anymore. I didn’t even before we broke up, and she sure as anything doesn’t want to be with me."
Harry leans forward and rests his elbows on the countertop. "Do you know," he says finally, "that I'd never had a proper present in my life before I went to Hogwarts?"
"Quite clear," Draco says. "So, you’re in this back room, having sex with a stranger, and you’ve got your keyring in your pocket—"
"With Harry, for the weekend," he says. "Would you like to wait in the sitting room whilst I make the tea?"
Draco drops down onto his hands and knees. His skin burns. Inside it feels like he's on fire. If his father could see him now, crawling naked on his hands and knees into the Malfoy kitchen, following Harry Potter there as he carefully unties the string around their pet shop parcel.
Draco isn't entirely certain how to present his mouth for inspection, but he gets up on his knees and puts his hands behind his back, opening his mouth.
Draco blinks at him. "You're mad," he says. "I'm never doing that again. People shouldn't be underground like that."
Draco doesn’t react to the change in topic. “It is,” he says. “So heavily warded that no one will find it.”
stitched beneath the waistband. Socks. Polished shoes. Then his collar, quietly purloined from Harry's bedside table, buckled closed with sure fingers.
When Draco's swallowed his own come, Harry finally kisses him, his hands sliding into Draco's hair, his tongue in Draco's mouth, and Draco kisses him back. He kisses him back until he can barely taste come anymore, until they're both breathless and Harry's pulling back.
“How can it not be, though?” Harry says finally, just when Draco’s about to give up and call it a day and suggest they head back to the castle. “How can me wanting this, wanting what I do, how can it not be a fucked up reaction to not having it growing up? How can it not be?”
"Such a dirty little piglet," Harry tells him, but then his hand curls around Draco's little cock and gives him a little tug. "Such a desperate, hard little piglet. Such a tiny cock."
Draco drops to his knees. He starts to kneel in between Harry's legs, but Harry shakes his head and makes him face the other way, away from him. He makes him lean forward onto his elbows so that Harry's presented with Draco's arse and the curve of his back. His coat's knee length, a beautiful black wool, exquisite.
, the box says, and Draco's mouth waters. He sits down, slips off the gold ribbon, and opens the box. The truffles are decadent and beautifully decorated, a gold shimmer over some of them. Draco doesn't know who Fortnum and Mason are, but they're clearly expensive.
Draco remembers. He'd come without being touched. He's not sure he wants to be restrained today, and he thinks he can read the question that Harry's not asking out loud about whether to do it today. He doesn't beg for it, and Harry tilts his chin in recognition.
“All right.” Draco holds his hands up. “We won’t talk about Dumbledore. Not now. I just…” He stops. Looks down. “I want so much to give this to you but I don’t know how to, not in a way you’ll accept.”
"Going to come all over your face," Harry says, flushed. "Going to make sure you know who owns you." His hand wraps around his cock but Draco's not having that. This is his job. He pushes Harry's hand away so that he can curl his own fist around Harry's hard cock, masturbating him, his mouth already open and waiting. "Fuck," Harry says. "You know just what I want. My dirty little piglet. My pig."
"Swift as they go, now," he says, and she hoots in disdain at him, but then she's gone, sweeping up into the early evening sky.
"Wank in front of the mirror," Draco says. "Say I deserve to be covered in other people's come, that I'm just a rag for them to come on. Wank my useless dick."
"Probably," Harry says. "I wouldn't worry too much, no one ever laughs when I tell them stories about growing up with the Dursleys."
"Neither had I," Draco admits. "But I think I'd like it too. I like the way things are between us, outside of the nursery. Maybe this is the way to help boundary it so that we're both comfortable. Do you think it might help?"
It feels like a very long time later when Draco feels together enough to rub his nose over Harry's collarbone through his shirt, and say, "Did no one ever teach you the proper way to prepare a scone, Potter?"
This time Harry catches icing sugar between his finger and thumb, and holds it over Draco's chest before letting go. He leans in after it, catching it on his tongue.
"Yes," Draco says, even though Harry had asked for it, and all Draco has done is obey. He tries to turn his head a little, get a better view, but the angle's wrong and Harry's not moving from the doorway.
"What a useless little cock," Harry says, fingers catching in Draco's hair. "So fucking worthless. Just like you."
"I didn't expect this," Harry says, coming up behind him. "I thought you were going to hang my clothes up."
"Do you ever think about that time you ate off the floor?" Harry asks, after a minute of them both focusing on their cake.
Harry beams at him. "Good. That's what I thought. Now come and sit down, there's crumble and custard for pudding."
Draco’s little cock aches to be touched. He crawls forward until he can nudge his face against Harry’s hand. He gets icing sugar on his nose even before he manages to take a bite; it’s harder to eat cake out of a crooked hand than it looks like. The cream goes everywhere.
The second guy, he raises an eyebrow at Draco at the same time as going for the zip of his trousers, and Draco prefers that, like he's just a service to be utilised, a hole to be filled. His dick's not as wide as the first guy's, but Draco's jaw still aches. But then someone else comes through from the main bar, looking for the guy getting his dick sucked, and the new guy just rolls his eyes and says,
"I was going to ask you for a nappy this morning," Harry says, still touching him. "But I couldn't. I couldn't say it out loud."
"Thank you," Draco says, because you're supposed to say thank you if someone buys you a gift, and it's best that he's pre-emptive since he's not entirely certain he can picture a situation where Harry Potter buys him a food bowl, like he's an animal, and Draco's able to say thank you.
. He could come right here. He stares at the plate. It's just pieces of chicken and salad. The bread's been buttered and cut into little soldiers. The chicken's already in small, bite-size pieces. There's no need for cutlery, and really, Draco doesn't deserve it.
"You don’t understand," Harry says, and his expression is fierce, and terrified. "I want you to look after me like I was little. I want to know what that feels like. I want to be loved."
"You cannot," Draco says. But then, he did live in a house with the Dark Lord. "You can't, can you?"
"I thought we could have breakfast in front of the fire," Draco says, going over to the little pantry-kitchen through the doorway in the corner. It all links through to the kitchen cupboards so they won't ever be short of anything. He lights the fire with a charm, and hopes Harry won't notice how heavily warded the fireplace is; he remains terrified of fire, and even more scared of anyone else finding out. It doesn't do to let people have access to your fears. "Toasted teacakes and tea, I thought? Unless you'd like warm milk?"
Draco must sound at least a little sharp, because Harry closes the book he's flicking through, and neatens up Draco's bookmark.
"It’s becoming clearer and clearer why she thought wanking me off and talking about you was going to yield a positive result, right?"
Draco doesn't bother looking down. He's dressed in his normal clothes again, neat and precise, right down to his waistcoat. His wand's on the dressing table and he fully intends on drying his hair with it. "And by comfortable, you mean--"
He sits back, Harry's cock sliding out of his mouth. Harry's still so hard, and Draco whines. That's his job, making Harry come. He's not doing his job if Harry doesn't. He's not serving properly.
Harry bumps his toe into Draco's shoulder. "Up on your hands and knees, I need something to come on and your face seems like an easy option."
"He was obsessed," Ron says, warming to his topic. "Hated you, he did. Went on and on, all sixth year--"
Draco rolls his hips up and helps Harry get rid of his pyjamas over the side of the bed. Harry settles in-between Draco's legs and cups Draco's balls in his hand.
Then he reaches for the charmed coin in the little green bowl on his bedside table. Hand-blown Venetian glass, an accent both picked and displayed by his mother. The coin shines silver. He runs his thumb over it until it glows.
Draco whines again. There’s nothing for him to rub his cock against, and he really needs to. He’s naked except for his collar, cake in his hair and and smeared across his face. He can’t help it; he reaches for his cock.
"I was a superior little snot," Draco says. There's a pause. "And I wanted so desperately to be your friend. Not then, when I didn't know who you were. But as soon as I did."
Harry lets go of Draco's hand so he can cup his cheek and tilt his chin up. "I love you," he says, kissing him. Draco smiles into their kiss. There's nothing shameful about this. Nothing humiliating or desperate or needy. It doesn't come everywhere with him and Harry doesn't bring it with him either. It's just them, on a cold afternoon by the sea.
"Everyone makes that face," Harry says. "Hermione still looks like she might cry sometimes. Ron and his brothers had to break me out one summer, but Fred and George taught me to pick locks after that, so not the end of the world. Normally I try not to talk about it anymore because, you know, people looking like they might cry is a bit rubbish but I thought I might try my material out on a new audience."
Then Harry slips the tip of his finger inside of Draco, and Draco's entire world has to realign after the sound that comes out of his mouth.
He wills himself not to startle Harry off. Instead, he goes over to the window sofa and sits down. It's just as comfortable as he'd hoped it would be; he hadn't allowed himself to test it when he'd been working on the wards and preparing the rooms earlier in the week.
Harry strokes his hair. "My dirty little piglet. My filthy little animal. My round little piglet. Look how lovely you look, my darling. You make me want to come."
"I thought we could apparate," Harry says, but he's opening a little velvet bag from his pocket instead, and putting their shopping inside of it. The bag's tiny, but their large shopping bags go in easily. "The Mary Poppins effect," he says, like that's supposed to mean something, but it doesn't so Harry just puts the little bag back in his pocket.
"I know," he says. He's drunk his tea too quickly, and mostly on purpose. "I've taken up too much of your time. I'll leave you to your evening."
"Yes," Draco says. "I know we don't leave your past behind. I know it. I know you carry it with you, and I know Harry does too, and I do as well. I know you're here because you love Harry. But you need to trust him."
Draco comes, his useless little cock fucking up into his cake, Harry's arm pressed across his chest. He comes.
"These are just the women's," Harry says, looking around. "The mens section is… up there, look, there's a sign. Upstairs."
"Greedy piglet," Harry tells him, the smirk turning into a laugh. "Always such a greedy piglet, aren't you? So fucking greedy." Draco flushes, and Harry laughs again, before feeding Draco his cock.
Draco nods again, cheek pressed against the tile. "So I can see it and always be reminded of what I am."
, it's always these strange magazines where the pictures don't move and the covers scream about ladies who've put on weight. Draco thinks they look nice and soft, no sharp edges. Draco is so tired of sharp edges.
Draco resorts to stroking circles into Harry’s back, just to see if he’ll settle. He’s restless, breath still catching, shoulders heaving a little as he tries not to cry into Draco’s skin.
Draco isn't sure he's ever been a good boy before. He trembles with it, even as he's licking his buttery fingertips and sliding them over his skin, pinching and stroking at his nipples until they're pebbling to hardness beneath his touch.
He's ashamed. He's embarrassed. He's humiliated. He's so humiliated he could sob with it, shame coursing over him. It's just that it's the most excruciatingly perfect thing he's ever felt in his life. He wants to come.
. He's a dirty piglet. He's Harry's dirty piglet. Literally on his hands and knees in the  grass, pissing up against a tree.
Draco glances down at the wine. It's expensive, but Draco is fairly certain that Harry knows nothing about wine or under which circumstances you'd pick which type. His good choice tonight is almost definitely accidental. Unlike Draco, Harry didn't have his parents to drill wine choices into him from the age of twelve. "Is everything all right?"
The club is busy and loud and the music pounds through his body and settles in his chest. People look him up and down as they pass, at his clothes, and Draco's never been poorly dressed in his life. His cheeks burn. He'd never have chosen something like this, this kind of casual humiliation. It wouldn't have come to his attention to even try it. They stop at the bar for a vodka and lemonade, and then Harry's leading him back through the crowds until they're going down a flight of steps and into a corridor busy with guys. There's a space when the corridor widens out, back in the shadows.
Draco understands that about as much as Harry probably understands Draco's desperate need to serve. "You really like that?"
"I don’t know why I’d say no," Draco says. He runs his hands up Harry’s sides. "Why would you think I’d say no?"
from all those years ago. It's certainly not the time to consider that Draco's never kissed anyone. The realisation that he'd liked boys had rather put an end to his early Hogwarts exploration, and then he'd really rather fucked his life up by driving himself to the brink with that stupid fucking vanishing cabinet and everything that had come after it, and after that, he wasn't exactly marketable on the marriage circuit, regardless of how hard his mother had tried.
"When I wake up." Draco recalls years of burying his face in his pillows and waking up to hump his little cock against the sheets until he comes with it. "If I shower or bathe. If I'm working at home and it's lunchtime. When I get into bed. When I'm going to sleep."
Harry doesn't bother rolling his eyes, but clearly that's mostly just because he can't be arsed. "Life's too short," he says. "I said you'd get what you wanted if you came here today."
“Probably not,” Draco says, and then has to watch as Harry sits on the floor in what was clearly at some point a boot room, and laces up some kind of walking boot.
“You deserve it,” Draco says, after a while, and Harry shivers a little at that. “It’s yours. Whenever you want it.”
"The same way you knew it wasn't… the same way you knew that what I need isn't something I've already asked for. The same way you knew I sometimes need looking after too."
Harry smiles. "Good boy. My good boy. If you need to go, then you crawl to the back door to be let out? Do you understand? And if you don't want to go outside, or if you want out for a bit, then you crawl to the bathroom door and I'll take you off the leash."
Draco hesitates. He's still in his coat. He's still dressed for work. He'd been meeting with Harry's ex-girlfriend.
"Comfortable," Harry says, and Draco can't stay and look at Harry looking at him like that, so he disappears in the direction of the kitchen so that he can decant the wine and find them both a glass.
"Imagine if I wasn't," Harry says. "Imagine if I just followed you around and talked about you all the time and I had a bit of free brain space to realise it was because I fancied you rotten."
Harry sits down on the edge of the sofa. "I could immobilise you like this, you know," he says softly. "Make you stay like this all evening. My little come-hungry piglet. My filthy little pig."
"You can come back soon," Draco says. He's offering Harry a full valet service. That's what he's giving Harry as part of their… arrangement. The cleaning's extra, just something else, something Harry deserves outside of what they do. He can't put a proper title on it, but he rather suspects it's got a lot to do with Ginny Weasley telling him that Harry won't let anyone do anything for him. He's letting Draco. He's letting Draco do this for him, and a little thrill keeps pulsing through him every time he remembers.
"You dirty, filthy piglet," Harry says, depositing his purchases on the sideboard. "Four seconds in the house and you're shaming yourself like this."
He's a greedy piglet who loves sweet things and being dirty, and he fucking loves Harry, and of all the things that have happened to Draco recently, it's loving Harry that is perhaps the most unbelievable. He'd never imagined the rest of it could happen, not in his wildest dreams. Most of it hadn't even made it into his fantasies. Harry, though, Harry's been stuck in his head since he was eleven, and Harry had never wanted him. He'd never, ever wanted him.
"No one should do this," Harry goes on, "want to humiliate themselves like this. But you do, don't you, Draco? You love the humiliation. You crave it. You crave cock."
Draco has a list as long as his arm, but he chooses to remain quiet. Harry had chosen dark blue tailored trousers for him, almost a match for Harry's blue waistcoat, but topped off with a pale blue shirt and a soft navy sweater. Without a tie and a jacket or a robe, he feels practically naked.
"I will," Harry says. He takes another piece of bread, buttering it before dipping it into his bowl. "I'm happy when I'm with you. You know that, right?"
"Possibly both," Harry says. He rolls his eyes. "Come on, let's go and find you some full coverage pyjamas."
"A thing," Harry says. He squeezes Draco's balls a little. "I could put you in any position I wanted."
"I wouldn't even notice you were there," Harry says, still watching him. "I've got a book to read. There's tea in the pot. Why would I be thinking about you?"
"The cupboard? Forgotten under one of the staircases downstairs. I've warded that, too. No one will disturb it." He slips his hand into Harry's again. "Come on. Let me show you the way."
"Get a move on, Piglet," Harry says, without turning around. He's making himself tea and a piece of toast. A perfectly normal breakfast, but then he's not a greedy piglet, not like Draco.
“Well,” Draco says, trying to ignore the little jump his cock makes at the thought. “I’m sure that can be arranged.”
"About you, mostly," Harry says. They're in the red sitting room, Draco sitting and Harry lying down with his head pillowed in Draco's lap. It's perhaps the only time in Draco's life he's ever sat like this.
"Whatever you want," Harry echoes, and they stay like that, with Draco kneeling at Harry's feet, and outside, it rains.
"Being nothing more than a hole," Draco says, and he wants to come, he wants to come so badly, but he doesn't dare touch himself.
"Yes," Harry says. "And I look over and there’s this guy giving blow jobs. And I didn’t recognise you at all. Not at all."
"Please," Draco says. "Please, Harry." He doesn't know quite what he's begging for, only that he wants it.
"I don't think I could be any more serious about Draco if I tried," Harry says. He's staring Hermione out, and she's staring back. There are endless years of friendship battling in that stare, and Draco can't help but be on the outside. He hasn't had a friend in a very long time. "I thought you understood that."
"I'm honoured," Harry says, and Draco wants to weep with it all over again. His breath catches in his throat. His eyes water a little and he has to blink as he looks up at Harry. "My darling," Harry goes on, stroking Draco's hair, his cheek, his jaw. "I've been really looking forward to this weekend."
Harry helps him to his feet, and then under the covers. He follows him in, and wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders. "Don't be embarrassed," he says. "Don't be embarrassed because it's something we both want."
Harry reaches up and presses three fingers to Draco's lips. "Lick them," he says. "Make them really wet."
"Come on," Harry says, after a while, pulling back so that Harry's cock slips out of Draco's mouth. Draco's lost track of the minutes. "You'll be more comfortable in bed."
Then, for the next five minutes, he hears nothing but the slick slap of Harry Potter's hand on his cock, his breath starting quiet and ended up rushed and hitched, the only indication after minutes of him masturbating that he's anywhere near the end. Because Harry Potter is masturbating on Draco's mother's nice sofa, and Draco is hard and leaking against her rug, and the shame burns through him like the plague.
Harry rolls his eyes at him. Underneath the table, their feet touch. "To Draco," Harry says, and then he grins. "He can ward my house any day of the week, if he knows what I mean."
“Apparently,” Draco says, after a while. “Apparently there are some people out there who remember their school days fondly. They just went there and made friends and did exams and left.”
Draco scrambles to stand up, but the man shakes his head. "Stay on your knees," he says ."Trousers down, yes, all the way. Turn around. Spread your legs."
Harry just nods, and turns his attention back to the room, waving a hand towards the empty wardrobes. "I thought there'd be more clothes."
Draco's dick pulses with it, with Harry's lazy disengagement, his lack of care or attention. His second guy comes and pulls out. Draco sits back on his heels, breathless. He tries to stretch his jaw a bit.
Harry ignores him, flicking through the magazine. "My cock needs warming," he says, without looking up. "Get down and do it."
"Just a useless little fucktoy," Harry says, after a second. "Don't know why I didn't think of this before." He doesn't meet Draco's eyes. Instead, he goes back to sit on the sofa. He
“Cleaner,” Draco meets Harry’s eyes, then ducks his gaze. “Hold me,” he says. “Just hold me for a bit.”
"I have my own bowls now," Draco says, and lifts the little plate with the cake on it. "Multiple sets, actually."
"Less of the taking over the world, and more of the being forced into saving it," Harry says. "Imagine how good a teenager I could have been had I not had someone trying to kill me every single year."
"It's all right, darling," Harry tells him, and he's stroking Draco's hair. "You were so good. You did so well. It's all right."
"Come closer and warm my cock," Harry says, and he starts to wind the leash around his hand so that Draco is compelled forward, into the open V of Harry's legs. He licks his lips as Harry pushes down his trousers just enough that his cock is free. Draco's mouth is watering. This is what he's here for; to be used. To be a hole. Nothing. An animal.
"Does it look like I care?" Harry says, and he still doesn't look at him. "I wanted a wank. Come here."
The work takes him five hours, or thereabouts, and there are a few hairy bits in the middle where there's a slightly higher than likely possibility that he might actually have been eaten by some quite inept charms work on the wards of Ginny Weasley's new house. And that's something for the corner of his brain that's not focused entirely on his work: why is Ginny Weasley still Ginny Weasley and not Ginny Potter, and why is she buying tumbledown old houses for knockdown prices with some fairly stellar charms work that comes along with it. Not that Draco paid any attention to
She tears her gaze away from his hand and stares at him instead. "You've talked about-- about how well adjusted he is?"
Draco fights the urge to roll the scroll up and send it over to the shelves with the rest of the in-progress plans. There aren't that many; Draco never takes on that many projects at once. He doesn't need to. "I charge people what I'm worth, with some concession for what they can afford. I'm extremely good at what I do."
"It's all right," Draco says. "They're looking out for you. I wouldn't trust me either. And as far as I understand, having people care for you is a nice thing, so stop looking like you've stepped in something nasty."
Upstairs there’s an old bathroom with one of those flushes that hang from a chain above the toilet. There’s also a large, claw-foot bath. There’s no bubble bath but — again — Harry’s come prepared. He drops a little pellet into the water and it fizzes with lavender-scented joy, little stars and petals and bubbles erupting through the water as the bath fills.
"You've got visitors," Harry says. "And I'm saying it might be nice if you felt a little bit less… restricted."
"Yes," Draco says. His little cock is so hard. "Put me how you want me, and make me stay there. Make me stay there. Please."
"That's right, Piglet," Harry tells him. "Don't forget where you are. On your hands and knees in the mud. On a lead. Wearing my collar. A real piglet."
"It's just comfort," Draco says. His voice cracks a little. "You shouldn't hate yourself for wanting to be loved. It's just a nappy."
Harry just snorts a laugh and angles his broom towards Draco. They chase each other around the pitch for ages, the wind in their hair, their Quidditch clothes blowing out behind them. They loop-the-loop and Harry attempts some kind of bastardised Wronski Feint that probably would have been a lot easier before they started approaching middle age, or at least stopped practicing. They swoop down towards the ground and back up again, first Harry in the lead, then Draco, and Draco is actually in the middle of
It's only then that Draco realises he's started whimpering, soft little sobs into Harry's skin. He presses his nose into Harry's neck. His body feels locked in position, even though he's free; his hands are still laced together behind his back.
"There's a doorway," Draco says. "Now you've touched the wall with me, you should be able to see the doorway when you come this way again. The wards are charmed to you and me. We touch the wall and the archway opens. Don't worry," he says. "If anyone else sees the archway - which they won't - they'll just see a cleaning cupboard. Brooms. Dust. Cobwebs. Nothing to hold attention." He waves his hand towards the archway and for a moment, the view shimmers, and it's exactly the view Draco's just described. A cleaning cupboard. Nothing to pay attention to.
Harry hums. He's still leaning against the door frame, arms folded, deliberately insouciant. Terribly handsome in his new clothes. Even his hair is behaving -- or at least it looks like it is -- and Harry's hair hasn't behaved once since the very first time Draco saw him. "I'll let you have final sign off."
He folds his jumper and shirt, then his trousers, and finishes with his socks and underpants before standing back up, little cock already erect.
He's not going to last very long, but even in the nicest of circumstances Draco can always find something to feel ashamed of, even if Harry's smiling against his mouth, breath catching, and not that far from coming himself.
Draco clambers awkwardly to his feet and onto the sofa, resting his messy face against Harry’s thigh. He’s still got his little cock out.
"Charmed," Draco says, and doesn't for one second let himself think about the possibility that Harry Potter's shared any of Draco's secrets with his friends.
Harry smirks at him from the other side of the carriage, where he's squashed in next to a tall woman in a headscarf and someone with tattoos on their face.
“I know,” Draco says. “I like that too.” He keeps stroking Harry’s face. “Do you think you might also like a place where you know that once you step inside, you’re not in charge? That the rules change, and you can set those rules, and you’re safe to let go? Because that’s what we can do.”
"I think it's very likely," Harry agrees, "given how I currently feel about you. Unfortunately I was a little too tied up in ridding the world of an evil dictator, so I didn't really have any time for all that, you know, important emotional growth and healthy stuff you're supposed to do as a teenager, so that you're not a fucked up adult with a side helping of post traumatic stress disorder."
"Good, Potter," Draco says finally, without rolling over. His dick's still hard. His whole body feels like it's waiting for release. "Would you like a prize?"
"Yes," Harry says, and they’re quiet for a while, Harry’s fingertips stroking Draco’s jaw. "Come on. Let’s go find a bath that’s big enough for two."
A steady stream of people then traipse past them, marching up the escalator, and Draco is even more confused. He's also still standing on the step below Harry, and Harry's still got his arm around Draco's shoulders.
"I won't be in a minute," Harry says. He's smiling. He doesn't look nervous, but then, he wouldn't; it's not his first time. "Take your underwear off and get into bed."
Harry's masturbating when he gets back, jeans swapped for a loose pair of cotton sportswear trousers, waistband pushed down low.
"Life's too short," Harry says, shortly. "If it was a rule of etiquette my Aunt Petunia thought was essential, then I definitely don't abide by it. No pans on the table? Fuck that. Saves on washing up."
He's wanking himself off, and Draco's not standing for this. The only person who makes Harry come is Draco. He blinks three times in quick succession and the spell breaks. Muscles held rigid for so long immediately start to ache but he ignores it all in favour of scrambling to his knees.
Draco shivers and nods. In the mirror, he's wearing ill-fitting, come-stained clothes. He's got dirty knees and come on his face and in his hair and down his shirt. He's wearing a shirt stained with his own come, that he'd come on himself watching Harry getting fucked. It had been just what he'd wanted.
Draco crawls over to the cake, his mouth watering. He longs to taste it, to put his mouth to the cream, but he's not allowed. He has to masturbate on it, like the filthy little piglet he is. His useless little cock is so stiff and he wraps his hand around it, even though he's really too small to fist his cock. His cocklet disappears inside his fist. It's not going to take him long to come, imagining what's coming next. Just being naked and on his knees for Harry is enough to push him to the brink, but couple that with Harry virtually ignoring him, getting on with his breakfast like Draco's not even there, it gets him almost there already. But then, adding that to the fact that he's going to be coming on a cake that he's then going to have to put his face in, that he's going to eat for breakfast, it's barely going to take him any time at all.
"No," Harry says, and Draco doesn’t know whether to be hurt by that or not, but then Harry speaks again. "I think when I was with Ginny, we were both desperately trying to put everything behind us and create something normal when everything around us had been something other than normal for so long. And if we could have managed it, maybe that would have worked, but I don’t think the world’s like that. We’re not here to fix each other. I couldn’t fix Ginny and she sure as fuck couldn’t fix me. I just tried to make her happy so that I’d be happy and it never worked. But I come here and I see you and you’re not trying to Spellotape me back together. I think you were just trying to find a way to be happy. Or give yourself what you needed. I just think, I don’t know, it worked because underneath it we wanted to make each other happy. For some degree of happy that’s about orgasms. I wanted to give you something that you wanted and that made you happy and I got something out of that too. I don’t think that’s a bad basis to build something on."
"No," Draco says, and Harry’s so close, Draco can tell. His hips rock up. Draco moves his hand faster, opening his mouth. He doesn’t want to miss a taste of Harry’s come. Draco’s such a fucking come-hungry piglet.
Draco wants to come. He wants to come imagining it, imagining being so far removed from his life right now that he's just an animal for Harry to own. A piglet with endless sweet treats and a tiny little nub of a cock he can rub off on the furniture whilst Harry keeps him on a lead, his little collar bell ringing.
"You deserve them," Harry says, settling back against the sofa and bringing Draco with him, an arm around his shoulders. Draco stays rigid for a moment longer than he should before letting himself relax against Harry's side. He takes a sip of wine. It is nice. Granger has good taste. "I'm so pleased you bought them for yourself."
Draco looks up. A free-standing mirror appears in the kitchen right in front of him, and Draco is faced with the reality of what he looks like, flushed and messy and covered in cake. He looks wanton and overwhelmed and so desperately, desperately turned on. He whines.
Draco leans in and presses a kiss to Harry's forehead. "Morning, sleepyhead," he says. "Would you like me to show you your nursery before breakfast?"
"Yes," Draco says, because it had taken him long enough to ever ask for what he needed, and he'd asked it of strangers in a bar, his glamour spells practiced for years. It had led him right to Harry's feet.
"Surely," Draco says carefully, "at least one of those groups of people should feel satisfied right now."
"I think we would have had a knockdown fight first. I hated you. Hogwarts Champion. You were always so special. Everything always happened to you."
Harry doesn't bother asking him if he wants tea, just pours him a cup and pushes it across the table. The milk isn't in a jug, just in a small plastic carton with TESCO on the front.
Draco's mother only approved of cups of tea if they were neatly placed on saucers, on coasters, and on tables. Draco had never looked as comfortable as Harry did right now, curled up on the sofa with his attention fixed firmly on his book. Draco couldn't do anything other than look at him, watching. He might not be able to move a muscle, but it doesn't stop him from drooling around his lolling tongue, and the shame courses through him as he dribbles onto the rug. He longs to come, longs to touch his tiny little cock, longs to masturbate his need onto the floor. All his life he's wanted something, needed something that he's never been able to properly vocalise, even to himself, and Harry keeps finding new ways to bury in deeper and uncover parts of Draco's soul.
"Fuck me covered in cake," Draco says, the corner of his mouth curving up. It's a strange angle to look up at Harry from, cheek pressed to the floor, down on his knees, but he likes it. It makes him feel settled down in his stomach. Grounded.
"My beautiful, humiliated boy," Harry says, and he reaches up then, reaches up and cups Draco's cheek in his hand. "My beautiful boy, Draco. Mine. So fucking mine, all right?"
Draco rolls his eyes. "Child." His hand is still in Harry’s. He isn’t entirely sure when it was he started feeling this way about Harry. There’s been way too long hating him. It’s all sort of rolling into one.
"This is practically a cupboard," Draco says, but it's got no bite to it. The cottage is ramshackle, nestled in the dip, next to a little stream that runs into the sea. There are apparently seals, sometimes, and puffins; some of the old books on the shelves are guides to the creatures of Wales and Pembrokeshire, others guides to the flora and fauna. There's another one devoted to ghosts and legends. Draco had considered reading it for approximately half a second before discarding it; he sleeps poorly enough as it is.
"She does," Draco agrees. "She loves me so much that she had to leave the country." It’s true, sadly, and it’s not even an exaggeration. Draco’s failed launch into the marriage mart, her inability to overcome their history to find someone who’d put a value on him… it had broken her in the end. It might have broken Draco too, but there were less people around to notice. Those that he did lay himself open for, they only saw the glamour.
Draco hands his plate to Harry whilst he unbuttons his trousers, getting things out of the way just enough that he can free his little hard cock. He reaches for his plate once he's got one hand wrapped around his pointless erection, but Harry shakes his head.
Draco had spent his holidays either on the continent or at home, at endless dinners where he had to dress up and remember which fork to use and which grown ups to talk to about what. "I think so," he says. "They'd probably have the time of their lives."
"I thought we could have a bath," Harry says. "A place this big, there’s got to be a bath big enough for two. My aunt and uncle had one of those corner baths, you know? It was beige. They had a whole beige bathroom suite. Pot pourri bowl to match and everything."
Draco follows Harry out of the kitchen and into a living room that's smaller than Draco's bedroom in the flat. It's still clearly a Muggle room, but it's crowded with pictures of the Weasley branch of the family, if the red hair is anything to go by, as well as pictures that don't move at all, which Draco suspects is the Muggle arm of the family. Harry, who clearly knows where he's going, opens the cupboard in the corner with an
"Normally she hates shopping but I think she was intrigued by the fact I actually asked Ginny for help."
He finishes undoing the ward charms and spells his equipment back into his case. It's leather, and engraved with his initials. It would have been a 21st birthday present from his father, but unfortunately his father was imprisoned at the time, so he'd had it for his 23rd birthday instead and liked it.
Harry nods once, and stands up, going out to the cramped hall and into the bathroom. Draco, his little cock aching with need, doesn't touch. He doesn't stand up, or sit back on his heels.
"More like a trough," Draco says. He knows he's bright red. "You've put me in a collar. It's got a bell on it. And your friends… they know I'm your piglet. They come around and I'm there and I'm so far gone from being me that I don't even know to be humiliated anymore. I'm just an animal."
“My whole life,” Harry says. “Playing with those stupid broken toys. Trying to be invisible and make no noise. Them locking me away. Then later on, always being the focus of one thing after another. I don’t know how people go about their lives and don’t do what I do, don’t fucking catalogue everything they can see and give it a risk factor. And I don’t know how to categorise this. I have no fucking idea how to give the fact you made me a nursery any kind of rating in my head at all, other than it’s terrifying. It’s scary and I don’t want it to be anything to do with me growing up but I don’t know how to do what I want to do. I don’t know how to be looked after and I don’t know how to be loved because I never had it. Not like this. I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t know how to ask for it because I don’t know what I’m supposed to want.”
Draco goes immediately silent, apart from a high, vaguely strangled sound as Harry slides his mouth around Draco's little cock. He must be easy to suck off, because his entire cock fits easily in Harry's mouth without any effort at all, not like when he gives Harry a blow job or warms his cock. He raises his eyes to the ceiling. He loves being on his knees so much, loves Harry using him, making use of him, like he's a thing, like he's Harry's to direct. He's wanted to be used for so long he can't remember a time when he wasn't secretly fantasising about being pushed to the floor or humiliated. Even before he'd realised it was sexual, when he used to think about Crabbe and Goyle pushing other children around and bullying them at Draco's demand and he'd found himself wondering night after night what it would be like if he was the one getting pushed around. He'd been confused for so long, and then after that, knee deep in secrets so embarrassing he'd known -- even as a teenager -- that he couldn't ever tell anyone. It had been years later, years of embarrassing, lonely masturbation sessions and even more embarrassing lonely days and nights as the wizarding marriage mart passed him by that he'd realised he could have a bit of what he wanted, and he'd found himself in the back rooms of clubs, his glamour spells getting better and better.
Draco does not like the tube one bit, and when he stumbles off when Harry indicates they're supposed to be getting out, he resolves he's never doing that again.
, and it even has a gas hob, which Draco is not going anywhere near, even if someone pays him. "You have an electric kettle."
“Fuck that shit,” Draco says. He still has his hand around Harry’s shoulders, but he shifts his hand a little so that he can stroke Harry’s jaw. “Do you trust me?”
Harry gets to his feet, and he's not got any shoes on. His feet are bare, his trousers rolled up a little at the ankle. There's the soft, gentle breeze of a warming spell cast over both of them, and then Harry turns the key in the lock and opens the back door. It's only a little garden, grass coming right up to the door, no step or stone or otherwise. The grass must be kept back by magic alone, because it doesn't touch the doorway. The garden slopes up, slate stone walls enclosing nothing but grass, an ancient washing line, and a few trees and bushes that can survive the onslaught of the Welsh sea wind in the winter. Above them, to either side, the cliffs climb upwards again, rocky and green.
"No, I mean--" Harry stops. "Hagrid came to get me. On my birthday. It was the first time anyone had ever told me about magic. He took me to Diagon Alley to get my school things, and sent me into Madam Malkin's, and there you were. Talking about racing brooms."
"Glad you've already learnt how to present," Harry says, and for some reason he's not standing behind Draco, but crouching down next to him with a cream horn in his hand. "No," he says. "No hands. I want your hands pulling your arse cheeks apart. Your hole on show. You can eat it from my hand, and clean me up afterwards."
"You don't want humiliation," Draco says. "When it's you we're going to discover out how to do it so you're not embarrassed. It doesn't work for you."
Heat settles in Draco's belly. He can't respond, but there's no need. He's where he needs to be, drooling around Harry's cock, servicing Harry however he needs. Spit runs down his chin. Above him, Harry hasn't even started eating. All Draco can hear is the rustle of pages.
"People look at statues sometimes," Harry says, and he doesn't make eye contact with Draco as he arranges Draco as he wants him, Draco yielding to wherever Harry moves him. "They don't look at lamps. No one cares about a lamp." Draco's kneeling up with his back to the lamp upright, his hands behind his back, his little cock stiff and jutting out in front of him. "They just turn them on and off when they want them, and forget about them the rest of the time."
, not with what they want, but it doesn't stop him from wrapping his mouth around the guy's big cock and sucking him down. His jaw aches with the girth, and after he comes, the guy cups Draco's chin in his hand and calls him a pretty little whore.
Harry colours again. “Thank you,” he says, dropping his gaze to his plate. “Do you mind if we don’t talk about it for a bit? I just want to… get my head around it, perhaps.”
"How's the work going?" Ginny asks, like she's on perfectly friendly conversational terms with Draco, instead of this being maybe the only time they've ever talked. "Any surprises?"
Draco nods. "I'll make tea if you'd like, whilst you get changed. And then I can get out of your hair."
"Thought everyone knew I was a coward," Draco says. "Just a weaselly little coward. That's what they say, isn't it?"
His glamour spells are brilliant, his speciality, and he finds a place in Muggle London where there's a back corridor where he can go down on his knees and get his cock out and take what people want to give him.
He lets go, and lets Harry take him, body and soul, and if he sees forever in the stars then maybe, just this once he's not alone.
"All the better for getting to the end of it. Hermione, honestly, what on earth are you doing here?"
Draco's overwhelmed. He doesn't know what to do, but he knows he wants to experience the chocolate cream touching his cock. He lowers his hips, moving his knees a little further back, until his cock's hanging over the cake, almost touching. And then he rolls his hips down, and his cock touches the cake, and there's icing across the tip. It's soft and delicious and he wants it in his mouth.
Draco obeys, even though he's missing the weight of the collar around his neck and the feel of his harness against his skin. Markers of being owned, of being nothing more than an animal. Of being Harry's pet. He gets into the bath and gets down onto his hands and knees again as Harry tests that the water's warm enough. And then he lets Harry sluice him down, the shower water soaking his hair, and his back, and his legs. Harry soaps him up, water going everywhere, washing his hair with a shampoo that Draco hasn't approved and probably wouldn't, but right now it doesn't matter. He's an animal, Harry's animal, and it's more important that Harry wash him everywhere, including between his legs and down his thighs and around his little, stiff cock. It seems less important that Harry make him come again, and Harry must get the message, because he does nothing more than clean him off, making sure the soap's gone from his hair and his skin before he turns the water off.
Harry doesn't ask him to move and Draco doesn't volunteer. He stays where he is until Harry nudges him with his toe and wipes his hand off on Draco's thigh.
"How was dinner?" Draco asks, even as Harry's nudging Draco up so that he can slide his pyjama shirt over his shoulders.
Draco does. The chips are salty and hot and nice. He doesn't like the greasy fingers though, and the burger is somewhat overwhelming. He watches Harry eat his, and then copies what he does, picking it up and eating it.
"Up you get," Harry says, and Draco looks up, bewildered, to see the magically expanded tartan pet bed next to him on the floor. "Get in."
People don't touch Draco. He can probably count on the fingers of one hand the people who've touched him in the last ten years, the strangers in clubs aside. His skin tingles beneath Harry's touch. At the top of the escalator he jumps off awkwardly, and is just about to announce to Harry that he's never riding another escalator in his whole entire life when they round a corner and there's another one.
"Getting there," Harry says, and maybe Draco shouldn't be so forward, but Harry doesn't resist as Draco pulls him closer, and slides his hand over Harry's stomach, over his pyjamas. Possessive.
For a second, Draco imagines being naked and in public, wearing nothing but his collar. "Yes. I want that."
Harry materialises, naked, and drying his hair with a towel. "I thought you might want to stay for a bit," he says. "There's supper."
"Sometimes it makes me sad, that's all," Draco says. "I promise I'll laugh with you when you need me to."
There's a jigsaw puzzle of Harry pieces in Draco's brain and all he's managed to do is fit a few bits and pieces together. Nothing's joined up. Maybe expecting all the answers in one go is too much. He smiles. "Do you want to watch me wank as I eat this?"
"No," Draco says. "Just some socks and slippers and something warm to put over your pyjamas. I've got a jumper you might like."
Harry makes a sharp, desperate noise in the back of his throat, almost like a sob, and Draco reaches for him then, pulling him into a hug.
Harry leans in to kiss him on the cheek. He's clearly shaved again recently, and Draco has to stop himself from shivering at the knowledge that Harry dressed up for him. For
"Are you going to come for me, Piglet? Come on, Piglet. Show me how much you love thinking about this. Being my good pet."
Harry obediently -- and nervously -- runs his finger down the back of the little orange dragon, and is startled when the dragon starts to purr, arching into his touch. He looks up at Draco with wide eyes. "They do purr."
. He's conversed with Granger and Weasley, and no one ended up hexed. He's been terribly polite all evening.
," Harry says, looking like he's mulling it over. Draco's fairly certain he's not mulling anything over, and that, like Draco, he's been thinking about the two of them and what they do in some detail. "Maybe pop into Magical Menagerie and see if I can't pick one up."
Draco's mouth curves up at one side. He spells the door closed and locked behind them without looking. The charms are sensitive and complicated. Draco likes to feel safe in his own home. "Yes, sir," he says, once the final lock has slid gracefully into place.
"I bet you're going to come on the floor, aren't you? Such a filthy little piglet, horny as fuck. I'm going to make you lick it up," Harry goes on, fingers moving slowly on Draco's cock. "You're too small for me to even get my fist around."
"Because I'm your come rag," Draco says. "Because you can come on me and it doesn't matter. I don't matter."
, filling him up, and Draco loves him. He loves him so much. "Make me come," he begs. "Fuck me and make me come."
After a minute, Harry touches his hand to Draco's elbow. "Take your coat off," he says. "Take off your shoes."
"A file landed on my desk today. This kid who they wanted us to investigate for magical potential. Except they got to his primary school and he was a catalogue of signs of neglect."
"Cake," Ron says, in disbelief. "One minute you're having cake, the next you're, you know, having each other?"
Draco glances over at the bakery box. He shouldn't have another cake. All those years of being sent sweets and cakes, all these years living with his mother and indulging her in lonely afternoon teas with tiny cakes, and him never being able to eat all that he wanted. Never giving in to how much he wanted the cream cakes.
And Harry, with a breathless rock of his hips, does. Come stripes Draco's face, catching his lips, his cheeks, his jaw.
, it's enough to make him want to fucking come, and he hadn't even realised this was something he might want. Humiliation normally comes with being noticed, but not being important enough to notice was humiliating in and of itself.
"It was," Harry agrees. "It's not anymore though, is it?" There's a pause, and Harry stops, pulling them over to the edge of the pavement, out of the way of the busy shoppers. "Did I get that wrong?"
“I’m embarrassed,” Harry says finally, after Draco’s poured them both a cup of tea and added a splash of milk. “I’m embarrassed about how much I want what you’ve given me.”
"I am," Harry says, which doesn't explain the small velvet bag, barely the size of Harry's palm, and the lack of accompanying sweets.
"Fair," Harry says. "But I can give you what you want, and I'm pretty sure you'll give me what I want, when I need you to."
Harry fists his cock, standing over Draco with his trousers undone. Draco, naked and hard and desperate, wants to beg for more, to be able to touch himself, to be able to come on the floor like he deserves.
"No," Harry says, and he almost thrusts a bottle of wine in Draco's direction. "I just wanted to see you."
There's a pause that lasts a beat too long. "There's no one for me to tell. There's only my mother, and she has a fractured relationship with how I live my life."
Harry grins at him. "I do. You can't have a bolthole that's practically a mansion, it makes no sense."
"Oh, he visited then?" Draco reaches for the kettle. "I always like to test the wards very thoroughly."
Draco shifts closer, and lets himself breathe in, then out. Harry breathes with him, the two of them naked but for Draco's collar, and pressed together. It’s the closest he’s ever been to anyone in his life.
Draco is already reaching for Jonathan's cock, hands encircling his length, guiding him in. He sucks on the tip and wanks him off with one hand, cupping his balls with the other. He wants Jonathan to come, to come on Draco's face and mess him up so that Harry can watch him get dirtier. So Harry can watch how far Draco still has to fall into his humiliation. About much he wants it, needs it, craves it.
He turns back to the counter and prepares a plate for Harry to eat. He arranges it neatly and then brings it over to the table with some cutlery, laying it out so that all the angles are straight.
Draco presses his forehead to the tile and breathes. He sometimes wonders if there's an end to what he imagines, a line beyond which he doesn't want to cross, but the truth is that they keep going beyond what he's thought up, Harry throwing him scenes that he just wants to gather up and add to his collection.
Draco stumbles up to his knees. His limbs shake. His muscles quiver. He leans in and takes Harry's cock in his mouth, lapping at him. He smells like heat and sweat and come. Draco craves the taste. He licks him, swallowing down whatever remnants of come he can find, licks him until Harry's thighs are trembling beneath him, and Harry's hands are in his hair.
"I'd like," Harry says, and then Draco leads him upstairs to his bedroom. The wardrobes are empty, but he's hung the picture up on the wall - without its new frame, which is still on its way to Draco's - and he's made the bed. It's tidy and neat and organised, a serviced space for Harry to exist within.
"Yes," Harry says. He's still wrapped in his robe from the bathroom, as is Draco. He glances around. "The decor reminds me of Professor McGonagall."
Draco sleepily frowns. "I'm a light sleeper," he says. "How did you get out of bed without waking me?"
"With the curtains closed and a silencing spell in place," Draco admits, although it hadn't been possible to get away with it every day. Even then, back when he was learning about himself and coming to understand that even then, young and alone, what he wanted wasn't normal, even then he'd known that no one else would want this. No one else would think it was all right that he liked to shame himself by humping the sheets every morning before it was light. That he liked to rub himself until he was coming.
"Look how hard you are," Harry says, with a smirk. "Hard because I made you eat from the floor. Do you think I should let you come?"
"I had it all planned out, but now I'm here I don't really know where to start." She smiles. It's a little wonky. "I just… a lot of people think Harry has everything under control, that he's well adjusted--"
Draco can't help but whine, trying to chase Harry's cock with his mouth, but Harry shakes his head, holding Draco back with a hand to his shoulder.
Harry's mouth curves up at the edges. "Good," he says. "Good, that's how it should be." And then he starts to undress Draco, taking off his jumper and his belt and kneeling down to take off his slippers and his socks. It's always really been Draco undressing Harry, and he's unused to this kind of attention; maybe he always will be. In his head it's always him looking after Harry, it's always him on his knees. This time it's Harry undressing him, standing up to help him off with his trousers and his shirt, until he's just in his long underwear, and Harry's still dressed.
"I trust you with my life too," Draco says, without meeting Harry's gaze, and then he slides his mouth over Harry's still mostly soft cock, and holds him in his mouth.
Harry picks one of the sitting rooms to stop in, one they've been in before where there's a view of the gardens and a record player left over from the previous castle occupants. The carpet is red and is just as rough beneath his palms as the last time he was in here, doing this.
Draco ignores the fact that his dick has just got hard. The one benefit to having a stupid little dick is that when it gets hard in situations where it shouldn't, it doesn't exactly come across as obvious. "Cautiously positive," he lies.
Harry kisses him on the cheek and then hides his face in Draco's neck. "Stay here a bit longer," he says, and Draco, content, does just that.
"I know you are," Harry says, his hand stroking down Draco's neck and coming to a rest in the small of Draco's back. "Because what you want is shameful, isn't it? Spread your legs a little, Draco, and then anyone walking in can see you properly, see that hole of yours and your balls, and they can laugh at how little your cock is. Do you like it when they laugh, Draco?"
"More than anything," Harry says. He bumps his knee into Draco's. "And there's a lot we could get up to in a weekend."
"Stop whining and wank me off," Harry says, and Draco's half way through thinking up a clever response when Harry kisses him again, covering his mouth with his own and cutting off any further attempts at witty repartee. Not that it matters too much, because Draco's focus is on his hand around Harry's cock, and Harry's hand around his, and he's groaning into Harry's mouth as they kiss, and touch, and rub up against each other.
Harry’s already over by one of the sets of hoops, turning over and over in the air like he’s being buffeted by the wind. Except there is no real wind to speak of, and Harry just looks stupidly happy. Draco hasn’t been on a broom in a while, not like this, but it’s all coming back.
Harry doesn't say anything for a while. "I kept trying to give her what she needed. Except there's a difference between what I thought she wanted and what she actually needed."
"It might not be as big as anything you own--" Ron starts sharply, and Hermione makes a very obvious show of poking him in the side. Draco feels helpless. He'd actually meant it as a compliment. A fairly standard one, but a compliment nevertheless.
"I’d been doing this work for the Muggle Outreach Centre," Harry says. "Before I went to work for them, just stupid stuff really. Trying to track magical signatures and stuff. Because sometimes we go and see primary schools and we wanted to make sure that when we went outside to the playing fields to play our games, we didn’t, you know, lose anyone."
Draco knows he's gone a little pink around the edges. He's been alone for so long that these last few weeks with Harry feel like an island of imagined bliss; surely at some point reality will crash firmly back to earth and Draco will be left, once again, with the same silent, neat, desperately lonely existence he'd had before he'd Harry had come back into his life. "Are you?"
