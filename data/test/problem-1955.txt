Draco couldn't stop the tears that escaped. He leaned forward and pecked his lips softly. "Harry, I think…no...I am in love with you. I have always been in love with you."
Harry let his cat go and pulled Draco closer to him; he buried his face in his neck and inhaled Draco's scent to ground himself. Two years of living away from Draco was something Harry needed to get on with and come in terms with. Not with this amount of longing, because Harry knows no matter where Draco will be, his heart belonged to him. This thought alone could not make their decision easier.
They sat in silence, neither of them, talking some time until Draco softly said: "You know, I saw you shining, when you defeated the Dark Lord. Everyone wanted to follow your light and your steps; they wanted to be strong just like you and share the glory."
One day, out of nowhere, Harry shocked himself by asked Draco about his parents. Draco stared at him with amusement. Harry diverted his gaze away from those intense grey eyes waiting patiently for his reply. Draco informed him that his father was in Azkaban with life imprisonment, and his mother never leaves the manor. Unknowingly they started talking about Malfoy Manor and Draco's childhood.
Just as Draco, Quaffle under his arm, comes close to a goal post in the foggy weather, ready to score, someone bumps into him knocking him away from his course. His breathing becomes hard, his vision is dotted with white. He tumbles and then jumps. He can hear people shouting in the background.
They all gather, Weasley, Ginny, Harry, Blaise, and Neville as one team and Draco, Dean, Pansy, Seamus, and Theo as the other team.
After what felt like years staring at each other, Harry and Draco giggled like children, and then looked away. Harry let the silence convey everything he was feeling, and could not stop the splitting smile on his face when Draco rested his head on his shoulder. Harry knew they both have fallen deeply for each other. Without words, without any deliberate action made, their heart pounding and thrumming together showed how they felt for each other. Sitting together, Draco’s head on his shoulder, the world around them shrunk, leaving only this moment be theirs and only theirs.
After Harry was fully dressed, Draco happily dragged him outside to the chilly, dark morning. Grey light of dawn fell on their faces, as they walked together. Harry let Draco led the way while he sleepily rubbed his eyes and continuously muttered under his breathe about Draco’s sudden obsession with muggle London and watching a stupid sunrise on a stupid hill, and Draco just being an idiot.
Harry felt lucky to know that Draco trusted him enough to let his mask drop. It was not easy to forget the seven years’ worth of hatred between them.
Harry was stretched out in his bed with Draco, his back pressed against Draco’s warm chest, blanket tangled around their legs, possessive arms draped around Harry’s waist. Harry slowly turned around in Draco’s embrace, and stared at the blond hair, his softened features. Draco looked relaxed and content while sleeping. Harry lightly traced his face with his fingers from his eyes, his nose then lips and smiled whenever Draco twitched sleepily. he can’t stop the fluttering in his stomach eveytime he thinks about Draco or about their time together.
One of the thing Harry learned from his past was that communication is very important in any relationship.
Harry sat beside Draco in the café, way too early for his liking. They were both drinking their usual orders, except that Harry kept sighing between his sips. Harry gave a particularly heavily sigh and Draco snapped at him to get on with it and tell him what is bothering him. Harry sighed again, then took a deep breath, he resignedly looked down at his feet, the words spilling out of his mouth on their own accord.
He pressed both of his hands on his ears but he couldn't stop hearing the whispering. A silver thread wrapped around his torso, smothering him.
" I ... maybe I'm scared," he admitted. It took some effort to form the actual word and let it flow out of his mouth.
"Weasley, are you sure?" Draco smirks at the redhead, challenge clear on his face, with his arm stretched out.
Harry’s attention, his affection: once he felt them he knew he craved them not for the first time. He realised he was always in love with his idiot, with his Harry.
Their days went by just like that, sometimes they talked about the war, but they never go deep into it and just tip toed around with each topic. They would graze through the conversation, and would simply change the subject, if the other showed even a slight reluctance or uneasiness. Maybe they were both feeling it- How they are starting to come alive after surviving a war with scars beyond imagination. They understood each other’s small movements, the small twitch of their eyebrows or the tapping of their fingers, upward curl of their lips or blank look on their face. They both knew when there was need to stay quiet, and leave things be, as they both get lost in thoughts they have reserved only to themselves. Things left unsaid by one of them can be filled by the other, and when one becomes too consumed by his thoughts, the other one simply snaps his fingers in front of them to bring them back to their silently observation of the world passing around them. They did not push each other to reveal what they were thinking; instead they kept silent and listened to their unspoken words with understanding.
Draco stares at him, shocked and with a sense of déjà-vu. Those green eyes watch him, and his whole face lights up. Draco is too stunned to even reply.
Draco tilted his head and looked up at Harry with intense eyes, his shoulders stiff and alert but his face in a blank mask, regarding him with those intense eyes, then he looked around him before nodding and proceeded to completely ignore his presence. They spent rest of their time in the café silently drinking coffee while looking out of the window.
Draco walks briskly reading his files as usual. He contemplates hexing his partner into oblivion for his tackiness when someone slams into him. A strong rose smell assaults his nose and he bends down to collect his scattered papers. Then he hears him.
Harry falls into him, weightless, and holds him to himself, breathing him in. he slowly tilts his head and kisses him, slowly, openly, and breaking contact only when it became difficult to breathe.
The words rang in his ears as the familiar sensation of Apparating pulled him away. Draco was so used to their routine argument that he could no longer bring himself to answer back, then he sighed dejectedly. He got so numb to all the things they said to each other in heated arguments that seemed to never cease. He no longer wanted the weight of his family name burden him. Draco shook his head to clear his mind. He did not want to dwell further onto thoughts that were not supposed to be touched, and ignored the longing ache he felt.
Umbridge walked in with her barrister on the left and Dumbledore From the right. When she got to her table she scanned the crowd and spotting Sirius she began shrieking.
"That failed" chimed severus "Bella acted as a buffer for us up until the wedding and we finally pulled our heads out of  our arses"
"And Uncle Sev you and I need to remain in class as much as I hate to leave Harry. Hermione and Ron can help us cover for him they think covering for the both of us dating all these years."
"So they can't claim anything," she whispered back "the Governors will call him up to verify the memories of detentions."
After that they met up with Ron and Hermione and went to the various shops to get everyone a new wardrobe.
"All harmful magical effects will be wiped from  Harry and I fully suspect that many of our problems will be solved when she gets here." Sirius said
"Madam Umbridge if you will please pass over the locket to Chief Wugmump Dumbledore so it may be returned to Hogwarts' Slytherin House" Bella said "Chief Dumbledore after this session if you may hand it to me to make sure she did not foul this artifact with anything and then it may be displayed in its rightful home"
Going to the first of the three vaults, she disappeared. She returned with potions, books of healing spell damage and fey ancestry, and a sack of knuts. She then went to the second vault and retunred with two pouches one contained precious gems and the other filled with sickles. Finally she went to the third vault and filled three bags of galleons.
"it wouldn't of happened if you had listened to me in the first place" Bella turns to Jasper," Jasper I don't blame you for a second over what happened. Your a Damn empath. Of course the thirst would overtake you. of course you would struggle more than the others. You feel their thirst on top of yours every single day. Even Carlisles.... the thirst is still there whether they act on it or not. How can you seriously blame yourself for what happened?"
She looked at the adults and said, "Severus and Sirius i want you to keep a monitoring charm on him and let me know if something changes drastically."
"Polyjuice!" sirius said, "Harry can go to class but if he gets more detentions one of us can take his place."
"all those in favor of guilty raise their wands" Madame Bones called. All but two wands were raised.
When the train got to the station the group got their stuff and parted ways knowing better than to keep uncle vernon waiting. As they got off the train Ginny was suddenly in front of the golden trio.
So for the next week or so after Vernon left for work Dudley and Aunt Petunia would go out to meet the solicitor. Sometimes Dudley would stay behind and help Harry finish his chores.
"If we may Minister," John Doolidge  stated, "My client would like to answer these charges individually as we believe that some may be challenged."
"We can also free Sirius" Harry said reading one of the books "This says that is Sirius had actually been guilty of a crime then the Black Lordship would have immediately passed to the heir"
“Are there any introductions or prior business to be discussed before we begin pretrial prep” Lady Bones Asked
"Before Umbridges trial the wizemongt will hold a small session as is required," Sirius explained "As Dumbledore is chief warlock he will not be there since he will be prepping for the trial."
With that each of the teachers stated their information and gave a sample of memory. Delores in her arrogance did not even realize that Severus pulled the memory of detentions as well.
OK SO THE MPREG STUFF HAS BEEN DECIDED DRARRY IS A DEFINITE AS WELL AS ONE OTHER HINT HINT ITS A TRIO HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT TILL LATER AND SINCE THERE WILL MAYBE NOT BE A SEX SCENE BETWEEN THEM I WILL LEAVE THE CARRIER A SECRET.
As the teachers began to line up in order the doors opened and Bella stepped out along with the Cullens. Each of the Cullens following behind her except Edward who had her by the arm and was escorting her down. Her green dress sparkled with the leaves made of gold and the emerald chips sewn in.
The house elf popped into existence and Lucius quickly and quietly stated explaining what they were and their purpose
"That's not," she paused to take a hurt breath to calm herself, "Thats not how this works. You know NOTHING about me. LITERALLY NOTHING. You haven't bothered to ask. I could tell you all at the least the basic facts about each of you but have you even asked me once who my parents are? No you haven't. Im supposed to mated or dating your son whatever you wanna FUCKING call it and you won't even.... talk to me about my family or anything else." Bella rants getting more upset.
"Severus," Mcgonagals voice came from it, "where are you its almost dinner time. Also you should be warned Deloris is on a rampage apparently Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Draco missed her classes and Harry missed a detention."
Everyone then exited their rooms. The students in their school robes, and the cullens each had on a pair on nice jeans and sweaters, with the girls wearing boots. Finally Bella came out wearing a black leather jacket, pants, an emerald green shirt, and thigh high black stiletto boots. As they all begin eating Harry's new familiar picked out from under his shirt collar started hissing
As they get in line to board Alice asks "Will a months long amount of close the enough for what we're doing and will we even fit in there with what we have?"
“That will fix itself when this is finished,” Bella said nodding as she turned onto the street with the leaky cauldron. “I want to discuss Tom later as well as the teaching situation. For now, we must go by Gringotts. I’ll need money as well as getting a message to Jareth.”
"The pregnancy itself a last 1 to 2 months depending on the factors surrounding the baby and is if it is Multiple babies. which I have no control over that's up to you and your mate as well as how often you are hunting and what you're doing if you put yourself in a stressful situation you won't lose your child, but it will take longer for the baby to develop. The baby will be born to cysearian section through magic and cutting into the body. what you would do is that in this world there are tools for everything and I do mean everything one of those tools is made for vampires because they do interact with the wizarding world and in some  hospitals that will take them vampire and werewolf teeth are used in some medical tools to a Aid that process I can't really go into it with you cause I don't have all the information from that but essentially your baby will be born through the cysearian section. After that your child will  Age at a slightly elevated rate. They will be strong as durable as you are they will age as a human their mind however saved on this 1 couple 1 couple alone.Their mind however is wonderfully intelligent at 5 months old they're able to do more than most 5 year olds can or least understand it."
Bella noticed them going back and forth and narrowed her eyes. The Cullens looked on in amazement as she replied
"Oh but don't tell me its for the best" she looked at him laughing sarcastically, "Are you fucking kidding me. You don't know shit about me and you want to decide for me my entire life."
“Then you do not know your history” Lady Longbottom answered him “The high table is meant to be a tie breaker and is only held by one person. The heir to Avalon and magic herself. This is, as anyone who has had an education knows, Arabella Easton; High Priestess and Heir to Avalon/Ambassador to the Wizarding world/Healer and teacher of magic, Daughter of Lord Oberon and Lady Titania High King and Queen of the Faerie rulers of Avalon/Sister to Jareth the Goblin King and Puck the trickster.”
"No," Bella said "he had one it was just completely unintentional in its making. That is how he was able to come back. However he used it up so hes back and that is it no redos."
Suddenly she skidded to a halt, "actually," she said "it would take too long here why don't we all go down to the chamber of secrets it's more secure and all of our stuff is down there already"
The rest of the year was rather quiet after the arrest and dismissal of Umbridge. Lucius had taken over as interim DADA professor as the governors of the school worked with Bella for her to be the new teacher next year.
"Oh i didnt but more so in the way that they were children. I met the marauders the night of the almost incident with Remus and Severus. I got there just as James had saved Severus and made him stay. Then when the moon went down i reamed Sirius a good one. Of course he had not meant any harm he didn't think Severus would actually go out there"
“This room is for Ron” she said next as the group explored a room that seemed to be themed after sunflowers with its brown and yellow shades.
"Not you," Bella replied, "so don't worry about it. It was the Gaunt ring which was thrown into the cauldron with him. The only reason he could have made it was because the Gaunt ring had the Resurrection stone in it."
So al little anticlimactic ending i know some of y'all were probably hoping umbridge would try to attack people. It could still happen IDK. anyway le me know what y'all think. Also let me know if you think draco or harry should end up pregnant i still have a while before those chapters
"To save us all time" Bella called from her seat "Why don't we make this simple. You claim you are innocent of misuse of a magical object however we have memory evidence of you using it from your own head. You claim you are innocent of child abuse however to use this quill which is only used for the creation of contracts as an implement of torture is abuse. That is what you used it as by the way, there is no other way to explain it. You TORTURED children. Finally the attempted murder charge will stand as I am the one who had to come halfway across the world to do an emergency purging and healing of Lord Potter-Peverell- Gryffindor. The evidence from this healing states he has undergone at least 12 sessions with you each lasting well into the 3 or 4 hour mark. These charges WILL stand as Lady Magic has already made the decision known."
As she showed them a room which was themed after tulips, and was an entire bouquet of warm, happy colors.
Nobel Houses: Potter (N), Prince (D), Crabbe (D), Goyle (D), Monroe (L), Bones (N) (holds 5 votes on the Wizengamot)
everyone had woken up the next day to a loud ringing from the floo quickly making sure that everyone had hidden Severus went to answer
Severus stepped forward as was accepted to everyones surprise not only in the prince seat but also in the Ravenclaw seat
Ok so here's the thing I kinda suck at writing violence so any abuse harry suffers will not be described just eluded to. Also I would like to thank my wonderful friend Stephanie for her description of the manor I couldn't have done it without her.
__________________________________________________TIME SKIP_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Quickly grabbing all of his stuff they apparated to Foxwood Manor where they were met by the others. Foxwood Manor had a certain aura about it, when its visage met the human eye. As the others quickly came to realize. It was hidden in the Fae Woods, which seemed to blur the lines between the human and Fae worlds in wide brushstrokes in acrylic greens and blues. Yet once a person found the Manor, they knew that had not mistaken it. The glorious building, painted in velvety burgundy, was breathtaking, a mixture of Victorian beauty and Tudor grace. Three stories high it stood, with small, elegant balconies along the windows of the top floor. The dark woodwork gave it an aged, contoured look, suggesting it had stood through the ages in the immortal woods.
Alice getting ideas was also starting to make clothes so they wouldn't go back all the time. The freedom of being in the magical world got her creative juices flowing.
"But continuing on, there are gifts that i have due to my heritage; i can speak with animals in fact I have my familiars which you will meet later, i can control the elements to an extent, i also have the gift of life. This means with certain conditions i can bring someone back to life also, under that. I can also make the girls pregnant if they wish."
"I'll be on the next plane out." She said to him nodding, "I can't get all the way over there on my own magic and the boat would take to long."
"What time do you think shall be here" Sirius asked as he looked down at his godson "the quicker the better"
Griphook went the get the racket bells when Bella stopped him. Walking up to the dragon she began to pet and croon to him, five minutes later he was asleep. Turning around she saw everyone staring at her.
"yes what Black," Severus (who had allowed the children to call him that while in private) asked walking out of Salazar Slytherin's potions lab. The man had nearly cried when he saw it although he would kill you if you said that.
"Not any more" Lady Anissia Selwyn said "I was going to wait after the results of the trial to disown you however I find it best to do it now. Delores Jane Umbridge is now exiled and disowned from any part of the Selwyn line. Another thing is that pendant is not an heirloom from our family."
"But we need to leave," Edward spoke up, "we bring to much danger to you and we can't risk it happening again."
“A few introductions to be made” Stated Arthur “My sons Fred and George have reached majority and are prepared to take the Prewett seat as in their familial will.”
Harry/Draco who bottoms therefore who is pregnant personally speaking I don't carry the way but I'm not going to do a switch so it has to be one or the other
That's all the male pairings that I can remember that I put down if that changes I will gladly update it to the poll just let me know
TIME SKIP Heathrow Airport early the next morning *****************************************************************************
"After the attack mom and i realized how wrong we were. I mean after all you could have just left me there but you didn't you saved," Dudley replied, "Mum's gonna divorce dad and try and get us away from him."
"Thank you" he said as it nodded. His Summer following that was relatively calm. While he still had to do his chores his Aunt and Cousin seemed nicer to him. Dudley didn't beat him up and Aunt petunia actually snuck him more food. While there were a few light hits, each time Uncle Vernon would seem like he was going to the extremes Bella's spell always seemed to take hold.
“Well now that that is over we have much to discuss,” Amelia started “We will start with talking about the upcoming trial however after the trial concludes whether that be today, tomorrow, or a week from now we will glean answers as to the other crimes committed such as false imprisonment of a member of our community.”
"With Harry and Albus abstaining that will take away 41 votes" Arthur said to the twins " Since the chief whugmump is the prosecution he can't vote. That leave 279 votes to decide. The high table won't be needed for a vote but she may have to interfere if the trial goes sideways"
"Once we have met our mate we live to their lifespan. For five years or eternity it is up to them. Some exceptions happen however. My brother Jareth was mated to a human however, she underwent the change and was made into a Faerie."
the memories began to play notes were being made by the govenors which would be later turned into meetings many looking displeased with Umbridge's hands off approach to ling. Then to everyones horror scenes from her detentions began to play. scene after scene students being tortured by a bloodquill most prominatly Harry.
When they got upstairs, an amethyst-colored hallway stretched before their eyes. Paintings of various eccentric-looking nobles lined the walls, as well as sentimental watercolors of trees, lakes, and mountains. The hallway felt as if it truly belonged to a strangely-soothing fever dream.
"That until Hogwarts lines are claimed the headmaster or Headmistress takes them over." Sirius answered, "however along the same lines they are duty bound to report the heirs."
"HARRY'S BEEN MISSING A WEEK AND YOUR JUST NOW SAYING SOMETHING!!!!" Molly and Sirius both yelled. Sirius sounding Dangerously close to strangling the wizard in front of him. Dumbledore waved them off and asked Severus if he had heard anything.
"So what can we do" Severus asked "?it was only recently I found out that he had stolen the Prince title. I had thought that I had been disinherited along with my mother."
"Aro in his mate. The Volturi know about me they know what I can do and that's partially why they left you alone. Jane and  Alec they weren't turned. Their Aro's children that's why he favors them.  Above all others this is the most closely guarded secret that the Volturi have. As for their reason for wanting this I don't know I can't tell you that it's not up to me and it wasn't my decision to ask."
"Being The Dark Lord's target for anger doesn't exactly make me in the best shape for class Albus. I gave Minerva the homework for my classes and the prefects are supposed to collect it and bring it to me at dinner."
"First i will tell you my story," she started, "then and only then can you ask questions. Keep in mind that i can't answer everything I'm not allowed to."
"one of my few regrets" she said "was that i was away on avalon and couldnt help james, lily, and sirius. I had only come out of Avalon during your second year Harry."
“Dad showed us a book of the families laws” The twins stated together “ The Black Laws dictate that if the Lord or Lady of the Black family is guilty of a serious crime such as murder then the title immediately passes to the heir”
"Not in such a sense," Bella sighed,"There is more in this world besides humans, vampires, and werewolves. Some of these things must remain a secret to outsiders. You are outsiders."
Rosalie was about to ask about the pregnancy option when they all heard a large dong coming from the ornate mirror in the corner.
"The ingredients for students are often subpar since they don't want them top be wasted" Severus, "However this also means that potions are sometimes incorrect and will lose points for mistakes that are not made by the students."
"My name is Arabella Easton; High Priestess and Heir to Avalon/Ambassador to the Wizarding world/Healer and teacher of magic, Daughter of Lord Oberon and Lady Titania High King and Queen of the Faerie rulers of Avalon/Sister to Jareth the Goblin King and Puck the trickster. I have come into the mortal world many times however the reason i came this past time was because when i reached the age of 1001 years old i felt my mate being born in the world. Normally once our mate should they not be fey, reached maturity we would seek them out. However, when my mate was 17 years old i felt them dying, to the Fey mating is for life we will not find love again."
"You all come to my office now." The headmistress gives them a glare and motions them to follow her.
Harry breathes out the words, but Draco hears him clearly. Draco smiles at him, and gently kisses Harry again and again on his lips, his cheek, his neck and finally buries his nose in Harry's hair, eyes shining.
His head held high, shoulders straight and his face a complete blank mask of indifference, Draco walked down the familiar road towards his office. The sun was hiding behind a heavy grey cloud, darker clouds had spread across the sky. He was wearing a formal white shirt with black robes. His silver tinted earing shone in the glass of the elevator as he entered the Ministry of Magic. His pale skin looked more pale, emanating his mood. He closed his eyes, but he could feel someone staring at him. The hair in his neck perked up, a feeling he was very familiar with since the war. But as he opened his eyes he was alone and the elevator door opened with a
Draco slowly walked toward the French window of his room, with his mug in hand, and looked outside. His window was charmed so he could see the nearby café where they were currently investigating. He was immersed in watching a mother and daughter pair talk animatedly to each other. First, he didn't notice the red-haired bloke enter the cafe. His gaze shifted and then he saw them: Granger and Weasley were laughing with each other. Draco had seen them more than he wanted to admit here in the Ministry as Granger was a Unspeakable. He often met her for a meeting or another.
Instead, Draco closed his eyes, enjoying the cool breeze and soft earthy smell, a small, knowing smile playing on his lips. He was relaxed, like being home. He looked different from what usually does, calmer, but more alive, full of life. Harry liked Draco like this.
And after three months of building their relationship, a small walk outside the castle made him panic and run away with god knows what and then stop in his tracks to stand, still contemplating what to do. He was in love with Harry. He could feel something heavy in his heart lift when he said that aloud.
“Rose, this is Mr. Malfoy, my-uh-guest.” Harry winces internally at the slight stutter he couldn’t stop from slipping out. “Mr. Malfoy, this is Rose Granger-Weasley.”
“Ha ha,” Harry says dryly, but he still hugs her back tightly. Ron gets in on it too, and the three of them just stand in the bathroom in a group hug for Merlin knows how long.
“Good, I think. The firs’ years get bolder an’ bolder every year. One o’ them the other day nearly got ‘is hand taken off by a kneazle. A
Harry looks back over at Draco, who has already trained his eyes ahead, on Ginny. Under his clothing, it’s hard to tell his physical ability, but Draco seems to be just as in shape as he was in Hogwarts. ….
The door bursts open to reveal his freckled friend standing in the doorway, his hair windblown, cheeks and nose red, and dressed in full, scarlet Auror robes.
Harry spots an empty desk in the front left corner and quietly slides into the seat. He looks around to see if anyone is staring at him or questioning his continued presence in the classroom, but every single student’s attention is already focused on Malfoy and words coming from his mouth.
Awkwardly, Harry takes it. “Friends.” They shake, and something seems to shift - imperceptibly. “How’s your thing at Hogwarts, by the way? With Sprout?”
Malfoy takes a minute to compose himself. It’s late, and through the window Harry can see that a snowstorm as picked up outside. But other than the faint whistling of the wind, this wing of Hogwarts is extraordinarily quiet.
“Bloody hell,” Harry says, his voice a little muffled by the sweater he’s pulling over his head. It’s his favorite one - a nice cream color with red stripes. Harry throws his robes over it and pulls on a pair of his trusty bootcuts.
The owl he sent with the letter preens itself lazily, clearly unaware of the life-changing letter it just delivered. Blood roaring in his ears, Harry almost knocks half the contents of his desk onto the floor in his haste to find a piece of parchment and quill. His response turns out barely legible due to his trembling hands, but it reads like this:
“Gentlemen, you are seated on the arm of the most ancient dragon of the Isles: Glyder Fawr, the Greatest Ancestor, the Eternal Dreamer.”
He tries to go back to sleep, he really does, but the thought that Harry is somewhere on the other side of the wall, breathing and awake at the exact same time, jolts his body with energy.
“Welcome!” The barista calls, but Harry barely hears her. He’s searching the tables for blond hair and a disapproving frown. Harry is almost ten minutes late. But the cafe is mostly empty and Malfoy is nowhere to be seen.
“Oh. A few years.” Malfoy begins to skate counterclockwise around the perimeter of the Lake and Harry skates so that they’re stay side-by-side as they make conversation. “I think the last time was when I took my mother out skating at the pond near her house.”
Malfoy moves on to other students after that, and Harry spends the rest of class trying to help Sophia and Lucas with their project mostly by obeying their instructions (“Can you look up the definition of these words on page 93 and repeat them back to me?” “Can you call over Professor Malfoy for us?”). By the end, Harry has gained little-to-no knowledge about chord progressions - though he does figure out that music has some kind of connection with magic through physics - but he has thoroughly enjoyed himself. It’s quite freeing to be in a classroom environment again without any of the actual responsibilities of being a student. And not to mention the attractive professor who always seems to be looking at him.
Harry only knows because he's resubscribed to all the outlets. It's an act of self-destruction, he's keenly aware of this, but he can't help himself.
Briefly, Draco closes his eyes, and imagines it: the stinging grit, the sucking tides. The sun in his eyes. The water, taking him in, and his friends urging him forward. Harry Potter’s voice in his ear. Harry Potter, buoying him.
But Robards doesn't seem to notice Edwards' peculiar demeanor. Really, judging by the way his narrowed eyes are still darting back and forth between Jenny and Ash, it just seems like he's still preoccupied by the interaction he had with them earlier. “Clarke and Weasley," he continues. Ron's hand tenses up a bit. Despite the fact that he's reminded Robards time and time again that he's married now and that his surname is legally Granger-Weasley, he's never bothered changing it. Hermione insists that it's not something to get too upset over, and Harry secretly agrees, but it continually bothers Ron. “You two will join the field teams, but with a focus on prevention and protection.” Alexandra Clarke, a round woman with long auburn hair who’s been Ron’s loyal partner ever since he joined the force, nods at Ron from across the table. Harry’s quite fond of her - she once baked Harry a batch of butterscotch cookies for his birthday, unprompted and without any ulterior motive. In fact, he wasn’t supposed to find out that she was the one who had done it, but Ron accidently let it slip to him almost immediately after they found the plate at his cubicle door.
By all conventional standards, Harry is an attractive man: shoulders solid as a foundation, hands quick and darting like small fish, silver in the streams. But his voice - anyone would know he was attractive from the way he speaks. The strumming rhythm, the undergirding fervency - Harry Potter talks like a hero would talk. Like he is both speaking to the world and confessing a secret for your ears alone.
in the first place. Lucas may be mature - at least from what Harry’s seen - but he’s no less naive about the world than Harry was at his age, or anyone else for that matter.
He shoots back, his words like a weapon, “Well maybe you fucking should have. When you and Ron came I was about to do it. I really was - I had a plan and-” He stops.
“Definitely not. Hermione still reads some from time to time, just to keep up with what’s being said, but she tells me all the time how garbage it still is.”
Draco takes Rose’s small hand and kisses its back before saying, his voice silky-smooth, “Enchante. And please call me Draco.”
Suddenly, Harry realizes that he’s dreaming and it’s like he’s emerging, gasping, from a pool of vague dream-consciousness.
Pat runs over and joins the hug, even though Jones doesn’t seem quite finished with her. “Thank you for coming. God I-” She takes a shuddery breath. “Thank you.”
A Muggle man with a moustache jumps in, tears in his eyes, "I've been following you for ages. Tonight was indubitably your best concert yet. Thank you so much."
“Goodnight, Draco. And don’t worry about the paperwork.” She wheels away, and there’s nothing else for Draco to do but close the door.
They eat in comfortable silence for most of the rest of their meal, only occasionally commenting on the food, the restaurant, or asking after each other's lives. At one point their shared connection of Andromeda and Teddy is brought up, and they both agree to all meet up together for supper sometime.
He's not sure how much time has passed when his fireplace flashes green and Hermione steps out and marches up to Harry.
Harry marches up to the counter “Excuse me.” The barista waits for him to catch his breath. “Have you seen a tall, blond man in here?”
“Set these down here,” Draco instructs Walker and Harry, who obey. Then, he runs up to Prasad. Behind them loom massive shapes: five grown dragons, sitting on their haunches at the edge of the nest, their slitted eyes luminescent and cutting in the heavy dark. In the crater is Amira, preparing the eggs for delivery based on their varying levels of readiness - just according to plan.
"Enough," Kingsley interrupts him with a firm hand on his shoulder. "This isn't anyone's fault but Auror Edwards'. And there's no use in pointing fingers at this point in time. Our priority should recovering the accuracy of the files and going from there. Auror Potter, you are dismissed."
was the one who vouched for Draco and Narcissa during their trials, after all. When did he stop caring?
Harry rubs his face wearily and deflates into his chair. Neville has every right to be pissed. Hell, if the roles were reversed, Harry might have even slapped Neville. But Neville is Neville. And no matter how angry he gets, his kindness still triumphs.
The professor next to her turns to look at whoever she just nodded at. He’s familiar: blond, snooty-looking with an ever-present smirk. So familiar, in fact, that Harry swears he saw him just yesterday.
The second half of the performance is noticeably different from the first. While even a musical novice like Harry could tell that the first half was mostly mainstream music - crowd pleasers - the second half is composed of stranger sounds. It still sounds like jazz: it still has the flashy parts and it still makes Harry want to sway and tap his foot, but the sounds are...different. In a a good way. It's like the notes are heavier than usual, like sponges filled with water.
“No. Or Mother didn’t think so, at least. If they did, they never said anything.” Draco’s voice goes a little bit wobbly at the end.
"These kids are very dear to my heart. I’ve seen them nearly everyday for the past ten years. I changed their diapers. I watched them grow up. And without them and Patricia, their caretaker, I don't think I would be where I am now. They have given so much to me," Draco pauses, choking up a little. "This is the least I can do."
"Ash, Jenny - sorry Gawain - I'm changing your initial order. You two are with me now. I think that if I am going to try to communicate with the Muggle Prime Minister, I will require your assistance."
Harry's head hits his desk with a soft thunk. He knows this is his fault. He knows what he did. A nasty voice in the back of his mind tries to convince him that he was justified, but was he? Probably not.
And they do just that. In the end, Molly and Arthur are the only ones outside of their group of friends who are going tonight - the rest of the Weasleys are either too tired from last night or already gone - like Charlie and Ion, whose trip back was rescheduled to today due to an incident at the reservation that required their immediate attention.
on him, that’s how receptive he is to his unspoken thoughts, but he knows he would never without his consent.
They do keep a light, however, with the help of Harry’s wandless magic. By the glow of his fingertip, and with a few, small apparition jumps, they reach the coast with all the supplies intact.
“Good.” Hermione gestures to the food laid out on the table. “Would Rosie kindly try my cooking? It’s a new recipe.” Rose practically leaps into her chair.
But a hand grabs Harry's again. "I'll owl you," Draco promises, looking into Harry's eyes earnestly. But all Harry can focus on at this point is how their hands are touching. Harry feels a sort of deja vu.
He sighs and lets his chin fall back onto his desk. In front of him lies the case file of his current target, the half-finished report strewn randomly. The guy has the usual profile for neo-Death Eaters: young, white, and male, and the small group of other young, white males he leads has grown bold in past months. Ron’s told him all about what he’s seen on stakeouts: the seedy, angry-looking bigots posted up in various side alleys down Knockturn Alley, preying on anyone who looks desperate or angry enough to believe all the bullshit they spout about blood status and, the Death Eater movement’s new gimmick, racial purity. The turn in their ideology came as no surprise to everyone. After all, The Boy Who Lived, the Vanquisher, the Chosen One - Harry Potter - is half Chinese.
"I've never shared my own music before, but-" Draco has to stop talking because the cheers of the crowd suddenly overwhelm his voice, even with the microphone. Once they calm down a little bit, he continues. "I want to share some of my compositions with you all tonight, for this last half. If that's alright with you."
Draco placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder, both of the staring at each other. Harry’s eyes started stinging, his vision blurred. He leaned his frame on the chair grounding himself to the warmth of Draco’s hand. He knew that Draco understands how hard it is to fulfil their expectations, and how draining it is to always be put in front, to lead when he has nothing to give. Harry let the tears flow and Draco sat beside him, his warm presence reassuring to Harry’s aching heart.
He hears someone clearing their throat and he has to try very hard to look away from this handsome man in front of him. Only then does he realise that they are standing in a very large crowd that has just kept on growing. Blaise is staring at him with his boring cool mask but his eyes betray him, glinting at him teasingly. Pansy is smirking at him and Draco can feel the heat creeping its way from his cheek to his neck. He can feel himself flushing all over and tries to hide himself as subtly as possible without giving anything away to the crowd, while he is failing miserably, much to the amusement of his boyfriend who is chuckling at his antics, to escape the group that is approaching them. Just when this couldn't get any better he hears headmistress Minerva McGonagall’s voice from the crowd. Draco wants nothing but for the ground to open and swallow him whole.
Draco stood—he couldn't stop himself even If he wanted to—and ran outside, skittered towards the Gryffindor portrait and stopped. For a brief second he stood there watching the portrait snore.
Draco fidgeted, standing behind his desk. He could feel a gentle magic, like a mother's caresses touching his mental barrier. Draco grabbed hold of his desk corner tightly that his knuckles turned white. He tried to keep the barrier up, but the smooth touch penetrated it without any force. Draco panicked and he could feel himself shifting forward. He heard a slow whisper in his mind, stopping all his panicking thoughts. Draco was glued to his place, his heart beating fast, eyes wide in fear as he tried to push the voice out of his head. He gathered every ounce of his courage, to look straight at the black-hooded figure standing behind the closed door. It didn't have a face just a black hallow mist in its place, blue shimmering light instead of eyes. Its hands were covered with long sleeves and above them was silver armour with different rune patterns sculpted onto it. The robe was long enough to cover or hide its feet.
Just like that all their days spent together flashed in front of him, one after the other. There were days when they fought and were disappointed in each other. There were days when they were hurt and sad, when they found each other struggling and overcoming. But thanks to that they started understanding each other. They started appreciating each other more, started falling for each other more. Things that were small and insignificant – things they considered small and unimportant – their small gestures and small things they did for each other that brought a smile to their faces – he finally realised them. He realised that it was impossible to share one's sincere feelings if it was too late.
He takes a moment to just gaze at the sky, his thoughts floating around a Draco. Eventually he shakes his head, snapping out of his thoughts, figuring he should probably head inside. As he enters, molly passes by him patting his shoulder in a motherly fashion. he grabs a drink from a floating tray (courtesy of one of the elves) and clinks his glass with Ron’s as he meets him sitting on the couch. Just as Harry was about to settle beside him, he hears a knock at the door. Harry puts down his wine glass and walks towards the door and sees who it is, he stands frozen, gripping the handle as tight as possible; his eyes blurring, his heart beating fast against his ribcage. Before him, he sees the only person he has been thinking and wanting the whole time.
Harry does not remember when or who or how it started, but at some point in their daily café routine, after one or two awkward hey and what’s from both of them, they started talking. Harry found out Draco had also been seeing Ms. Dary for mind healing, and he liked to drink coffee whenever he had a lot of things on his mind. so he came into the cafe for a cup of coffee to clear his mind or if he was agitated. On the day Harry first saw him, Draco had visited the café to clear his mind after a particularly hard mind healing session.
Only stumbling a little bit on the way there, Harry somehow makes it out the bathroom, through the labyrinth of his bedroom, and onto his bed without bumping into and breaking anything. In fact, the main reason that his bedroom is comprised of only his bed and a set of drawers now when it used to contain several bookshelves, a couch, and a glass coffee table is because he once fell into and shattered the coffee table while drunk. Harry had never seen Kreacher so disappointed in his master. In fact, he didn’t even know that house elves could
Unwinding her scarf, Hermione sounds breathless when she speaks. "Oh, I didn't expect you all to be up so early. Good morning everyone."
Harry nods into her shoulder and she lets him go. The last thing he sees before the green flames whisk him away is his best-friend waving at him, concern etched on her face.
Harry has never been a very religious person. Wizards aren’t really religious in general - though they celebrate Christmas - and Harry got enough of a taste from his time with the devout Aunt Marge in his youth to turn him off from it. But now, as he’s sprinting through the halls of the Ministry toward the apparition point, he feels himself praying, hoping, wanting to believe that his suspicions aren’t correct. That the twisting feeling in his gut is wrong for the first time in his life.
Something claws up Draco’s throat and makes its nest there, refusing to be swallowed back down. He accidentally meets Harry’s eyes across the flames, and the momentary touch stings him.
Sophia reaches the fort first and faces off against the one fort builder who managed to get back on his feet. He turns around and in his hands are dozens of snowballs that he starts throwing one by one in a wild barrage of exploding snow. Since his back is turned to Harry and his attention is focused on Sophia, Harry tries to use this chance to sneak up and grab the wands from behind their fort - the unfinished section, but a particularly hard snowball explodes against the back of his knees and Harry goes down.
Though he resists it, Draco feels himself slipping. He’s not as young as he once was; the floor could wreak havoc on his back, and they still have three days of hiking to go.
“And finally,” Hermione concludes, “I want to thank Harry Potter.” Dozens of sets of eyes land on Harry, but he doesn’t squirm. “Our success is in no small part due to you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your generosity. For being on the front lines with us.” She raises the medal again, its gold surface scattering light all over the place. “This award belongs to all of you! There’s still much to do, but for now, we can celebrate!”
The sky seems so much brighter all of a sudden. Harry takes his time walking back to Grimmauld Place, humming the - what was it -
Thankfully, his cubicle is nestled in the corner of the floor, away from all the hubbub. Because he's not actually involved in any of the efforts to apprehend the Death Eaters, Harry's surprised to find a memo hovers outside his door when he reaches his door. He snatches it out of the air, pushes open his door, and collapses in his chair. The memo reads:
“This was a team effort!” Prasad announces, proudly. “Lin and Amira baked the cake, Harry made the icing, and I spelled the snake!”
Robards is there in a flash. He knocks Harry's door open, sees Edwards on the ground, and crouches over him. "Edwards," he barks. "For Merlin's sake, stop your crying."
Harry, meanwhile, can't stop laughing at the entire situation. When he tells Hermione and Ron, he can barely get two words in a row out without dissolving into giggles. When he tells Draco, in bed that night, his shoulders shake so hard from laughing that the bed shakes and the mattress springs squeak.
They don’t even turn to look when he approaches. Angelica, the oldest girl, is standing silently holding a sleeping baby close. Dan, the oldest boy, is holding hands with two of his orphan siblings and staring at the ground. The rest are huddled around them, clinging onto each other’s clothing. Their caretaker, Pat, is relaying what happened to an Auror Harry recognizes to be Jones, the newbie who only ever wears Muggle suits to work. In fact, he’s in one now, looking entirely out of place among all the haggard faces and the scarlet Auror robes.
"I'm glad most of you are doing well. And for those of you who aren't having a good holiday season, just know that it's not over yet. My performance can still salvage it." His smile curls up, his voice turning a little cheeky at the end, but it only elicits more cheers. "Thank you for having me, and I hope you have a good time tonight."
Draco isn't wearing the sequined suit anymore, and has donned a green velvet one instead. It's just as gaudy and loud, in Harry's opinion, but infuriatingly enough, Draco pulls it off well. Paired with the messy blonde hair, Draco looks...good. Unfairly and effortlessly sexy.
After dinner, Draco and Teddy decide to practice a piano duet that they’ve wanted to perform for forever, and Harry takes the opportunity to talk over some plans with Andromeda.
All three are nearly identical - the middle one simply has two less beds. The interior is simple in each: dark wood paneling and white carpet, photographs of Snowdonia hung on the walls and thick rugs underfoot. Each opens to a living space, a half kitchen, and a bedroom. The porch in the back overlooks the wide-flung wild behind, its brush and tall grass and sweeping backs of mountains in the far distance.
Silence settles for a moment as Harry stirs his cold coffee and resolutely refuses to meet Malfoy’s eyes, the ones that Harry can feel searching his face. The barista comes and places a coffee and a sandwich in front of Malfoy. He tears it in half and offers it to Harry. It looks to be of the ham variety. “Hungry?”
"I am anemic. If I make a mistake, I might die." Ion passes the phone to Draco, and the blonde takes it gingerly and inspects it.
Clarke, Ron’s partner, walks up to them and she and Ron become immersed in conversation and discussion of the equipment they want to bring, etc. While they’re doing that, Harry realizes that he wasn’t given anything to do. Not a single responsibility.
“I don’t think anyone knew, even my closest friends. I wanted to fit in.” Draco eats a small cut of the pork and groans. “This is fantastic, Molly.” Then he turns to Harry and splits the rest of his piece with him. “Here, have some, Harry.”
Very few of Malfoy’s personal effects seem to exist here. The only sign that the someone is currently inhabiting the space are the stacks of books on the table.
but she definitely knew what her sister was capable of. And she still took that risk letting her be around you.”
The castle is mostly quiet - ghosts floating from one room to the next, some, like Nearly Headless Nick, are even wearing holiday gear like ghostly tinsel. Harry has no idea where the students are, but his thoughts don’t linger on them for too long. In fact, his thoughts can’t linger on anything for too long. Time and time again, they keep returning to the obvious, to the memory of him and his big mouth last night, to Malfoy, and to their
Snow has begun to fall slowly - just a few snowflakes here and there. Both men slow down to enjoy the view.
Harry tries to make friends with Draco, too, and quite incessantly. At every turn, Harry is there - offering Draco breakfast in the morning, helping him spell his bags back to their cabin after a trip. They settle into an uneasy rhythm: they wake up together, walk to work together, take turns cooking, and go to sleep together. When Harry goes out to buy groceries, he always comes back with a box of Draco’s favorite tea. And when Draco accidentally falls asleep in bed, with a book in his lap, he always wakes the next morning tucked in, with his reading glasses neatly folded atop his book - both set on the nightstand.
Carefully, he draws the egg pick from one of the bags. It’s a slender thing, shaped like a pickaxe, but with one blunt end and one end like a hook. He feels the dragons above track his every movement.
Harry wonders what time it is now, but makes no move to grab his wand off his bedside table and check. He might not even want to know. If he's late for work, then he'll be anxious. But not knowing if he's late for work yet or not makes him anxious too. So instead of doing anything to potentially resolve either anxiety, Harry just continues to lay, unmoving, in his bed and stare up at the ceiling. It's a drab gray color, and he suddenly flashes back to promising himself a long time ago that he'd makeover his room - and by extension the rest of the ugly house - some day.
He manages not to be embarrassed again, and instead dons a conceited and all-too-familiar smirk. "Jealous?"
"That was so cool, though!" One of the other children - Dominique, Bill and Fleur's youngest daughter - pipes up.
Is this where you’ve been this whole time?!” Neville’s getting agitated now, his voice getting louder. Harry glances nervously around him and hopes no one is eavesdropping.
A round of laughter makes its way around the table, not only from the said children, but also from her grandchildren - at least the ones who have been following the conversation. Harry has to hide a laugh behind his glass of water, and Draco smiles too. He seems more relaxed now, his shoulders no longer tense, his legs no longer crossed nervously, and his hands no longer fidgeting at the buttons of his shirt.
Although George and Angelina married a considerable number of years ago, they did so at a busy time for both of them: her career as a Curse Breaker was just taking off, sending her to all parts of the globe on missions, and Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was opening store after store all over the United Kingdom. As a result, they didn't see each other often for several months at a time. Harry remembers feeling bad for them, mostly because he and Ginny were in the same boat - with her traveling everywhere with her Quidditch team, playing games and doing publicity tours, they rarely had time for just the two of them. But Angelina and George are strong people, probably the strongest that Harry's every met, and they only seemed to have minor spats during that time.
The adrenaline takes a while to settle in his veins; it's been several years since his last, real date, and the stakes are even higher since it's with Draco Malfoy. Once his heart is beating at its regular rate, Harry feels his earlier enthusiasm slip away. Sure, he may have a date tomorrow night, but he's still here, sitting in his chair in his cramped, gray office, working a sham job. He checks the time and groans when it tells him that he still has several hours left to waste away.
He keeps his father’s ashes on his person, often. He takes it out sometimes, on windy days or while standing over a calm stretch of river, and considers releasing its contents. But he never does. Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t appreciate being spread so thin. He’s always liked his constraints - they shaped him, so to speak.
Percy and Audrey, after sharing a look, speak up. "We're willing to watch them while you all go," Audrey announces. Out of all the partners that Molly and Arthur's children have chosen, Harry still thinks that Audrey is the strangest, and he's thought that way since the first time Percy brought her to the Burrow to meet the family. And he doesn't mean it in a derogatory way towards her, in fact, it's the very opposite. She's beautiful: dark skin, hair, and eyes, full eyelashes, high cheekbones, an elegant, flat nose, and an amazing figure. That was the first thing everyone noticed about her - her modelesque aesthetic - but the second thing was even better: her personality. When she speaks, her voice flows like molten gold, and when she directs that speech towards you, it completely captivates your attention. Kind, patient, and independent, Harry even had a small crush on her for a few days, before he had no choice but to squash it once it became clear that her bond with Percy was unbreakable.
Harry doesn’t need to be told twice. He shoves the papers back into the folder and pulls on the robes draped over the back of his chair.
"Oh!" Hermione's jaw drops and Ron pumps his fist in the air while a few others - Bill, Charlie, Molly, Ginny, and Arthur - cheer. Especially since the War, the Weasley clan has remained close with Hagrid, and quite invested in his happiness and his relationship with Madame Maxine. Molly even knitted her an extra-large sweater with the letter M emblazoned on the front, which, for whatever reason, the extremely fashion-conscious giantess adores and still wears every winter.
Chatter in the club resumes immediately as people get out of their seats to get drinks or to approach the side of the stage and try to meet with Draco when he leaves or to gather their belongings and leave for the night. Harry looks around at the other people seated at his table.
Ron and Hermione are sitting to their left, and Bill and Fleur are sitting to their right. Hermione smiles at Harry and reaches over for an awkward half-hug with Harry's other arm keeping Lucy balanced on his knee. "Merry Christmas. How was Hagrid?"
But Edwards suddenly becomes completely unresponsive, just sobbing and mumbling about Azkaban on the floor. There's nothing to be done. Harry sends a Patronus to Robards, telling him about the situation.
Harry whips his head back around to look at Draco. The blonde is still playing, with what seems to be a slight smile on his face. But there's nothing to indicate that he's casting a spell.
His blond eyebrows jump up and he chuckles. "A classic reaction. I think celebration in my family has always been more formal and subdued.” He thinks for a moment before adding, “Actually, if my father were still with us, I think he would also faint at this point.”
“Yes.” He points into the valley, where, a little ways away, sits a small huddle of black-roofed cottages. “That is our destination. We should reach it by sundown.”
A pleasant tingle goes through his body as he reads his given name, written in the hand of Draco Malfoy.
"Oh, I'm so excited for this! I've heard so many good things from all of my friends - Yi-Chen and Jenn and Peter, do you know them? Well anyways, all they ever do when I ask them about the Amber Tap is rave on and on about the pianist, Draco Malfoy."
Audrey inquires, leaning her head on her hand, "Did you receive this past week off for Christmas, at least?"
“Well…” Malfoy’s eyebrows draw up slightly. He looks extremely weary, all of a sudden. “I’ll try to. But this class is only a trial run for now.”
And Harry can tell Robards is seeing them too. They both know that they’ve entered dangerous waters now; neither can divulge too much about Harry’s current professional state, as the media still believes that Harry is a successful, brave, high-ranking Auror. If any evidence of the contrary comes to light, especially during an already stressful time for the Ministry, Harry’s day-to-day life would once again become a literal battleground - just as he was immediately after the War and his divorce.
The couch is not long enough to accommodate Draco, he knows this, but he persists. “I will find something. Just, go.”
Inside, is a pair of snakeskin work gloves. Red with black diamonds, the scales are oil-slick and gleaming in the warm light.
Hope you enjoyed this fun little chapter as much as I did writing it! Next chapter is going to be a long one, so get ready for that!
Harry makes to walk after Longbottom, but he hesitates at the door and looks back at Draco, standing next to the firepit and watching him. Harry opens his mouth, closes it. Then, he disappears through the doorway.
After turning one final corner, the pair is met with the sight of the same group of students from last night sitting in front of a classroom door and chatting. They perk up at the sight of Malfoy and Harry and scramble to their feet.
Any argument left in him seems to die in Harry’s throat. He swallows it down, and his eyes bear into Draco’s with such heated intensity that something inside him thaws under the pressure. The melt collects, and drops to the earth.
Molly’s completely plastered now, her face almost as red as her hair, but she’s still sober enough to shout out the answer: “Second floor right!” before practically faceplanting on the table. Arthur and Charlie hover over her worringly, but she seems to be fine - just falling asleep.
"The owner of The Amber Tap, yes," She confirms, gesturing at the entire club with a big sweeping motion of her arm. "The best, most authentic jazz club with the best, most authentic jazz players in London."
He imagines Ron would be confused - maybe even cross about it - but he hopes Hermione would have a better reaction. She was the one who helped him prepare his testimony for Malfoy’s trial, after all.
Andromeda smiles and speaks slowly and softly, “Draco is family. We’ve been in contact for a while now. I just...didn’t know how to bring it up to you. Don’t worry, Harry.”
When Draco sneaks a look again, Harry’s head is drooped low and his quick fingers knitted together at his forehead - a man defeated, a man stripped away.
Draco chews on his lip and stares deeply into his empty wine glass, as if there's something left in it.
“Alright.” Harry stands, deposits Lucy into Ion’s outstretched arms, and grabs Draco’s hand. “Let’s go.”
Luckily, their food comes on two shining silver platters, distracting them momentarily with delicious smells.
He pushes it open and freezes. What looks like Keith Edwards has his back toward Harry, and he's bending down and rooting around in one of Harry's file cabinets. He hasn't heard him yet.
Thankfully, tonight’s dream falls in the middle of the two poles. Harry dreams of the last time he saw Malfoy: at his trials.
Paper airplane memos are so thick in the air that they regularly collide with each other and fall to the ground briefly before taking off again, more crumpled than before. Everywhere Harry looks there's a flash of red - someone's robes - as they dash from cubicle to cubicle, round corners with frightening speed, and sprint down the hall with bundles of files cradled in their arms. There's a distinct coffee stain on the carpet to the right of the elevator that no one's bothered to clean up, even though it's only a simple swish and flick of the wand. For the first time since Harry's begun working in the department, not a single person greets him as he walks past toward his cubicle. Not a single person even spares him a glance - they're too busy completely immersed in their files, in their enchanted maps, in discussing strategy with their team members. Harry wonders if this was what the department was like during the Wizarding Wars.
Harry glances at Ron who's standing on the other side of the room, back against the wall and his arms folded. He was out in the field too, it seems, judging from his mussed hair and the puddle of melted snow pooling at his feet. His eyes are resolutely trained on Kingsley and no one else. If he notices Harry looking at him or even Harry existing in the room at all, he doesn't show it. Harry feels cold all of a sudden.
He was about to turn when he felt the prickling in his neck again. Draco stood rooted to his spot, coffee in one hand, his wand held tightly in the other, ready to cast a Shielding Charm. He discreetly wiped the cold sweat that had formed on his forehead and maintained his unaffected posture. Slowly he moved back towards his desk, ignoring the figure that stood at the door. He placed his mug on the table and watched it out the corner of his eye. When it moved he barely stopped himself from flinching away.
When Harry first realised he had fallen in love with Draco, He just wanted to confess to him even if his feelings were not reciprocated. But it turned out that they love each other, and things between them just happened on their own; their silent confessions and long night conversations, their simple dinners at home and leisure walks in the park made him firmly believe they did not have some fleeting relationship. Their love is real and they were both fully into this relationship.
