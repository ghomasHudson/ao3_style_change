“Draco came over to the Burrow a few hours ago to tell me about your relationship. He wanted to make sure I was one of the first to know, as a mother figure to you,” she smiled at Draco.
“Well, in the spirit of no lies,” Harry said, “I may have one more.”
“They prove many things!” Al said, “I asked Scorp about them and he said they didn’t exist. He said they were “the things the Quibbler made up” and that I shouldn’t believe the tall tales of many magical creatures outside of the Care of Magical Creatures book.”
“I do not care at the moment, Ida. I am the head Auror, let me make the decision,” Savant’s voice was soft but firm as he addressed Ida. Turning back to face the fireplace, he said, “Potter, Brayan’s confession was thrown out. He was found to indeed be under the Imperius curse. Remmins was right. He used his dying breath to state what he thought to be the truth, and he was right.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “I should’ve guessed,” With that, he turned back to Hermione as if nothing had happened.
“There was a letter left at one of the places we’ve visited frequently where we think Kareach activity is possible, the one near Yorkshire, you know?” Harry nodded and Draco continued, “It had been burned, but I was still able to use magic to piece together what it had said. It clearly mentioned the next ‘meeting’ was at a Russian pub on the outskirts of town. I jumped at the chance of it being real evidence, which was foolish.”
Harry sighed, “Because I thought he did it, James. I swear. Much of my evidence pointed to that. Believe me, I didn’t want to accuse him. Blaise is a good bloke.”
“Go ahead.” Harry watched as Seb fell into the chair abruptly and beamed at him. Seb had an energy Harry had never seen in anyone else, despite perhaps his own children.
“Hermione!” he shouted, running toward her. To Harry’s surprise, Hermione was not asleep. Draco’s spells must have worked wonders. She was sitting up in bed, still orange as a carrot, but awake and seemingly alert.
“Tosh, Ron!” Seamus said heartily, “of course it’s alright! How are you, Padma, Ida and…” he paused, not recognizing Aviary, “I don’t think we’ve met?”
“Charming,” Patrick said, taking the bottle of cure from Harry and pouring it into a large cup on the table in front of her.
Molly gave him a look of encouragement as he got up and followed James to his room. James made his way to his bed. Harry followed and sat down besides him.
“The cooks sure know what they are doing,” he said. He followed this statement with another large bite of pie.
“We need to buckle down and find what this poison is,” Draco declared, sliding half of his pile effortlessly into Harry’s lap.
Harry pulled a face, “I’m listening now! Tell me the Marvin story!”
But Harry cut in anyway, “Ginny, he’s proven innocent! Anything I said about him doesn’t matter now. I’ll apologize to him myself, I’ll make things alright.”
Hermione smiled, her eyes shining as she bent over to give Ron a kiss, “I love you,” she whispered. She then turned to Harry, “I love you too, Harry. And I am so, so glad you are alright.”
Harry laughed, “Hermione, you have proved to Ministries time and time again that you and the rest of the British Ministry will do anything to aid the wizarding world. Even the Spanish Minister likes you.”
“Harry,” Ginny snapped, holding up her wand threateningly, “I will sting you again. I don’t want you to think of some ruddy excuse to tell me. I want the truth. For once!”
Angelina pulled a face at Ginny and countered, “Aviary only liked you more because you were on the Harpies! That proves nothing.”
Harry shook his head, “It was not obvious at all. I just thought she was taking Scorpius home after you had been watching him all day!”
“Molly,” Harry choked out. She then gave him exactly what she needed: a long and comforting hug. Harry had forgotten how much he depended on the only mother figure he had ever had.
“Potter!” Brayan shouted, running over to Harry and giving him an unexpected hug, “We are so glad you are alive! I was just with Draco Malfoy, and he said you were hit by what could have been a killing curse. I was besides myself with worry.”
Malfoy mocked offense, “I knew I shouldn’t have told you. But you asked about pets and I can’t not mention Murr but mention Roger. It wouldn’t be fair.”
The glare sent a shiver up Harry’s spine that he quickly jotted down as guilt, “No, I’m done screaming. For the time being. You never know how our conversions will go.”
“It means you need to learn to put yourself first,” Ida answered simply, “Wow, I really cannot stand talking about this,” she muttered this last part under her breath.
“I have plenty for the both of us,” Al agreed. Harry couldn’t argue with this either. Out of his three kids, Al was the one who worried about everything and wanted all that he did to be perfect.
“Next time specify emergencies, Draco,” Harry muttered, “Then we won’t have this problem.”
Hermione nodded, “I do. For what it’s worth, I think Blaise is pretty great. I mean, anyone who makes it their mission to personally scout out new security forces is good in my book.”
Molly looked like she was about to argue, but she only huffed and said, “Fine, but this better not be the only topic of discussion at lunch today!”
Seamus shot James a half-hearted glare and ruffled his hair, “You take that back, Weasley-Potter. I’m not scared of you just because you learned some spells.”
“Where’s the cut off?” Draco said, a small smile lifting the corner of his mouth, “When you killed Voldemort?”
“Well, my boss doesn’t always think so,” he said sullenly, “I was working on an important case for a long time. The Prophet, while still filled to the brim with pointless stories, has been working hard to gain a reputation of being able to tackle serious, hard-hitting issues in an effective and meaningful way. I was intentionally hired as an investigative reporter. Many times I’ve worked in ways similar to the Aurors to find out information about people.”
“She said I had potential,” Caser said proudly, “And that she was willing to give me the experience, as I always knew I wanted to be a Healer.”
He was saved from that thought when a sudden flash of light stole his attention from Dean and Seamus. To his utter surprise, Draco was standing in front of him, wearing a snowman sweater and a crown from a Christmas cracker on his head.
Just as Remmins had been waiting mere hours before, Ron was standing in front of the phone booth. When he saw the three of them approaching, he rushed towards them.
“Harry…” Ginny looked at him, so many unspoken words in her eyes, “I’m sorry.”
“It’s true,” Fleur piped up from a few chairs away, “He could barely speak French. Viktor also said his Bulgarian was frightful as well.”
“Your kid is named ‘Scorpius’! So don’t be going all high and mighty on me. You probably just looked at an astronomical chart and picked the first name that you saw!” Harry retorted.
“Bye everyone! I’ll see you tonight!” he shouted over the noise. “Thank you again, Angelina!”
With that, Draco began to carefully explain Chann to Dean and Seamus, being compassionate and comforting with each word. Harry tried not to admire this nurturing side of
Draco nodded, “I know that, Harry. I know we can. Just not yet.”
“Where’s Aviary?” Ida asked, “I’m not talking without her. She’s my partner.”
Harry looked once again at Malfoy, who looked calm and indifferent to Harry’s internal panic.
“Of course,” Harry gritted out. He hoped the fakeness in his voice covered up his internal rage.
“Yes,” Harry reassured, “I’m guessing Ron caught you up on everything?”
Harry held back a laugh as next to him, Neville gave a soft snort. Healer Brayan was about the least likely person to be part of a secret anything.
Harry had never been inside Draco’s apartment. He had only assumed the wards would hold him, figuring Draco would want Harry to be able to contact him in case of an emergency. He looked around before yelling for Draco. The room was not exactly what Harry had envisioned, but he supposed he should have known by now never to assume anything about Draco Malfoy’s life. Two red couches sat facing the fireplace, accented by soft blue walls and matching red curtains. The floor was dark hardwood, with a cream carpet placed under the two couches. The room had more small knick-knacks than Harry could take in. Everything had some kind of decoration, from the dark coffee table between the two couches to the four shelves lining the walls. Harry spotted many things that indicated travel, from a large black and white globe to countless framed postcards. Being a reporter, a serious one, must have brought him to many places. Harry felt a strange sensation, which he realized was jealousy. Draco had a kid who adored him but still got to live the life he envisioned for himself, the one that shed the dark shadow his family had cast on him. Very few people Harry talked to thought of Draco as an ex-Death Eater anymore. He was just Draco Malfoy, a man who worked for the Prophet and could write a smashing article. Harry wondered where this change started in Draco and why he had yet to ask.
“Gin, quiet do…” he started, as there were patients and healers wandering out of rooms.
Harry sat on a park bench upon arrival, planning to wait next to the fountain until Malfoy showed. He didn’t have to wait long. In less than two minutes Malfoy materialized in front of him. They were unseen by anyone due to the protective charms the two had placed around the fountain weeks ago when they started using the park as a meeting place. It was perfect due to the usual absence of wizards and wide open spaces. Even if a wizard or witch did show at the park, it was easy for them to prevent being overheard.
“I didn’t know what the spell did,” Harry supplied unnecessarily, “And I should never have begun to fight you straight away. And I should’ve helped better. I’m sorry.”
“For your information, Hermione, Ron and I hardly talked about relationship things,” Harry pointed out.
Seamus shrugged, “Say what you will, but you still talked about him too much, even if he was your competition. And then there was that whole thing with Cho Chang. Let’s just say, when you and Ginny started dating, I was very surprised at how functioning and normal you two seemed together.”
Seamus huffed, “I didn’t know what was happening at the time! We thought it was some ridiculous prank, remember? Anyway, I never said it was the best night of my life,” he paused for dramatic effect, “It was clearly the night we saw the Weird Sisters in concert!”
Ida looked at him skeptically, “Like what group, Harry? The Ministry hasn’t dealt with groups of Death Eaters in years!”
“Sometimes,” Padma said, smiling at Pansy, “The heart of life is really fucking good.”
“Right,” Ron said, “Aviary said that Remmins went home after they viewed the memory. She went to check on him about thirty minutes later, as he said he would only be gone for ten. Aviary walked into his house and was about to call out Remmins’s name, when she heard someone else talking. She said this person was threatening to kill Remmins if he didn’t tell everyone he was wrong about Brayan being under the Imperius curse.”
Harry pulled a face that transformed into a smile seconds later as Ida retreated to the kitchen to get glasses, one hand still maneuvering through her hair. This is exactly what Harry needed; the easy banter that came with a good friend. A good friend who didn’t ask many questions and didn’t expect many answers. She might not even bring up Harry’s whole coming out after a near death situation that occurred two weeks prior. He certainly wouldn’t mind. Harry needed a night where he didn’t have to think about his future or his messy and uncontrollable feelings.
Harry looked down at the floor, “It doesn’t matter. I shouldn’t have focused so much on him, and what my new identity meant in light of him. This…” he gestured at himself, “Mess of a person is my own thing, not Ginny’s or Draco’s or anyone’s.”
“How fucking naive are you?” Ginny denounced, glaring straight into his eyes, “Blaise is an ex-Slytherin who was known for being associated with Death Eaters. And before you tell that’s even more proof he was guilty, we both know it’s not! Unless, of course, you think your little gay crush did this too! No, you only think it’s Blaise. Because he had a human moment and slept with me. Because he’s Draco’s best friend and Draco would rather spend time with him than you!”
“I think so,” Harry answered. He took his last bite of pie and stood up, “I’ll go ‘n see what he wants.”
“Yes, James. I accused Mr. Zabini of being the attacker,” Harry admitted.
She looked up, “I can’t lose him,” she whispered, he voice containing a sadness Harry couldn’t begin to describe.
Harry smiled and reached out for Draco’s hand, “That’s what best friends are for.”
“It’s because of Seb, isn’t it?” she whispered.
Harry gave a stiff laugh, “I was actually just down on the Ground Floor today. Both Reyes and Zabini are in the hospital.”
“You tried to save my life,” Draco said, barely loud enough for Harry to hear, but it echoed in his head and drowned out all his thoughts.
The room stiffened immediately at the mention of the attacks. Harry could see Ida look down at her lap, no doubt feeling the same sense of shame he felt at letting the attack at the hospital harm so many innocent people. Molly stood up and began to make her way towards Seamus when he held up his hand.
“Weird. Want some?” Dean began to slide the pie towards Harry.
As the music of Lavender and Parvati’s first dance came to an end, a classic Twisted Sisters song began playing.
“A genius plan indeed,” Harry agreed, “Al has been thoroughly distracted since birth, what with Rose being his same age. Now he has Scorp as well. The three basically raise each other.”
“How in Merlin’s name could that be possible?” Padma asked.
He began to follow Ron to the lift to visit Dean’s hospital room. He held onto Ginny’s hand, trying to control his shaking. Dean almost died because he was a muggleborn. Yet he was one of the best healers on his floor. He was hardworking and contributed so much to this hospital. The thought that people believed all that was irrelevant due to his blood status was revolting. It was an ignorance that Harry had helped destroy, but never fully eradicated. He wondered if the wizarding world would ever be void of the terrors of prejudice.
“What’s with all the seriousness over here? Who’s ready to see my wife take down Harry’s wife!”
“Come in!” Harry gasped through tears.
“You don’t know that!” Remmins moved out of Harry’s embrace to shout at Aviary, “Av, you just don’t! I know you want to make me feel better, but you can’t. My partner and friend could die, and that’s something I have to deal with”
“I’m not complaining,” Seb answered. Harry was beginning to think he never did just that, “I could use the company. A dull time it is, having Dragon Pox.”
Darius nodded and said goodbye to the three of them. When he had left, the three sat in silence, all deep in thought.
“Hullo, everybody,” Harry smiled as he crossed the room to give Molly a hug. After she released him and he listened to a  round of her usual anxious reminders of how thin he looked, Harry went to grab a knife by a large pile of carrots clearly waiting for him. He handed a second knife to James, who himself had just left a hug from Molly and began to cut using his wand as Fleur veered into a new tangent about Dominique's new ambition to be a quidditch player when she grew up. Louis, who was cutting potatoes next to James and Harry, leaned over to whisper, “She’s already told this story more times then I can count. Dom’s never even been on a broom for more than twenty seconds!”
Aviary nodded, “First thing in the morning. We can’t have him heading Security if he’s the attacker.”
“It’s not bad, Gin,” Padma reassured lightly, “All we did was ask Harry’s opinion on a bloke for Aviary to hypothetically shag. And…” she paused as she saw Harry’s expression. Harry had no idea if they had noticed the bloke was Malfoy, but he hoped if they did they neglected to mention it to his wife.
“Youll?” Harry asked.
Maybe if he concentrated hard enough, he could overcome the charm. At one point he was successfully capable of fighting off the Imperius curse. Petrificus Totalus couldn’t be that much different. He focused on the counter curse, trying to do magic without his wand being anywhere in sight.
“Then it’s settled,” she stated, “We are all going.”
“You…” Harry trailed off, still trying to process what was going on.
I told him I love him. What was wrong with Harry? He tells a man he accused his best friend of a heinous crime, and then he tells him he loves him the next minute? After going home last night, he had paced around the living room. When he came to the realization that he was never going to fall asleep, he left a note for Ginny and apparated to St. Mungo’s at 5:30 in the morning. His training didn’t start until eight, but the last thing he wanted to do was walk anxiously throughout his house and wait for Ginny to work up. He knew it was selfish, but he didn’t want to explain to another person what he had done last night.
“How?” Harry interrupted, “She was under Petrificus Totalus!”
“Harry?” Ginny gasped, surprised, “Are you alright? You’re extremely pale.”
Draco smiled softly, “I can come back later if this is a bad time.”
“Scorpius and Astoria seem wonderful,” he blurted, hoping to break the silence he found awkward, although Malfoy seemed infruingatly indifferent to the quiet in the absence of his wife and child.
Harry realized his kids were all listening in stunned silence. He told himself that there was no way they wouldn’t find all of this out eventually, so it wouldn’t hurt for them to hear it now.
Harry shook his head, “Well, never mind, then.”
Something flickered across Malfoy’s face, that he recognized as what may have been gratefulness at Harry’s compliment.
Harry complied, focusing on casting the strongest spell he could so that it would hold up alongside Draco’s rapid fire of charms. He knew the spells were working, as Hermione’s violent shaking was slowly easing and her breathing was becoming steadier. When she finally stopped shaking altogether, he felt Ron’s hand grab his arm. Harry turned to his friend now. He had never seen Ron look so scared in his life. He was shaking violently himself, and his eyes were wide with fright. Harry hoisted his friend up.
Padma sent a glare at the door as she moved back to her desk, “Come in!”
“I…” he started, then paused. Ron nodded, then began to make his way towards the lift.
“It’s a good plan, Harry,” Aviary reassured. She was sitting in an armchair in the corner of the room. Draco was perched elegantly on the edge of it. Both of them were waiting for Harry to make a firecall as he sat with a handful of floo powder in his hand.
“It’s okay,” Draco said softly, finally looking back at Harry.
His breath caught in his throat as he tried to speak. Draco pulled out of Harry’s grasp forcefully and turned to walk towards the hallway. Harry let him, his mind moving faster than he could handle. Last week, Draco had told him kissing was a mistake. Now, Harry shows up in the middle of night and Draco tries to kiss him without needing an explanation? None of it made any sense. What hurt the most was the fact he wanted Draco to kiss him, but that was possibly the worst thing he could do with someone before telling them they accused their best friend of the crime of the decade.
“Well, I just thought maybe your interview yesterday went poorly,” Molly said, “You and Mr. Malfoy have a...well… complicated history.”
That left Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ron, Dean and Seamus at their table. The six of them began talking about which part of dinner was their favorite (Harry was partial to the steak) when a gasp from Draco stopped them.
Harry gave him a quizzical look, “Ron, it isn’t your fault. You and the rest of the Aurors did everything you could.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “Isn’t it obvious, Potter? I needed an out from a particularly clingy bar-goer. He was starting to think we were going to be going home together and I was anything but interested.”
As Seb leaned into the kiss and deepened their contact, Harry told himself that this was something he should want. He initiated it. Seb was indisputably handsome, kind and generally amazing. He also was kind, patient and understanding. Seb was everything Harry could ever want. But all Harry could picture as he closed his eyes was Draco.
“Er, thanks,” Aviary answered, looking at Harry as if he was losing his mind. He supposed he was.
“I like blokes,” he blurted, realizing immediately this was not the smoothest way to come out, “I mean, I am attracted to both men and women. And more.  I’m bi, or pan, or poly, or something else. I don’t know yet. But I’m not straight.”
“I can’t argue with that,” Harry agreed, watching as the ferret rolled over onto his back with his little paws up in the air and an imploring look in Harry’s direction, “This is about the most well behaved animal I have ever encountered. And I’ve meant numerous Animagi.”
“That’s incredible!” Harry smiled at him, “Did you come back for your check-up?” Dragon pox patients had to come back for a check-up a month after full recovery to make sure the disease was truly gone.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed, “Is that why you were so upset?”
Harry looked around. There was no use fighting it, his friends weren’t going to let him get out of this one. He began to scour the room for subjectively attractive blokes. Multiple times he thought he saw a winner, but then he would notice someone more appealing only a second later. Harry anxiously noticed the girls were stealing strange glances. Was he taking too long to pick? What were they thinking? He quickly pointed at the back of a bloke wearing a stylish gray jumper and a beanie. From the back he looked young, and well, fit, so Harry assumed he would be a good choice.
Raising her voice, she began speaking again to Draco and Harry, “We had the perfect plan. I bet, despite all your digging, you didn’t know what we used to poison all those muggles and muggleborns.”
“Ron, I told you I talked to Draco as a witness for the Trustins attack,” Padma said, looking up at Ron, “He really isn’t the same wanker he was at Hogwarts. He was still a bit distant, but he was willing to help in any way he could.”
Curses bounced off the shield from left and right. To Harry’s surprise, none of them were the bright green of the killing curse. Kareach wasn’t aiming to kill today. They couldn’t risk spilling any pureblood blood. But that didn’t mean they wouldn’t if they had to. Any of the Aurors were fair game.
“Maybe what we need is Hermione skimming these books,” Harry commented. He imagined she could read his entire stack in less than a day.
Harry looked away. He didn’t really want to consider how long his wife had liked Blaise.
“I know,” Draco whispered, looking at Dean and Seamus in turn, “That’s why we will fight to make sure no one else has this same terrible fate.”
“Otter nonsense, there’s nothing fun about that!” Malfoy joked. Harry was about to tell him about how he got the name from Sirius, but paused. Their conversation was light and friendly and Harry wasn’t ready to ruin that. Not when Malfoy had almost finished his third drink.
“Aries?” Padma said, “What does he have to do with this?”
Harry's eyes lit up in shock, “Yes! I do! He said he was shopping when he heard people screaming and decided to hide. We believed him, because he said he was a halfblood!”
Harry opened his eyes to the bright lights of a hospital room at St. Mungos. As he gathered his bearings, he saw all three of his kids; Lily grasping his arm beside the bed and Al and James sitting on the end of it. Ginny was right behind Lily, smiling down at him.
Suddenly, Harry could feel himself moving upwards to a standing position. Relief surged through him, believing he had done this himself. But as his back came into contact with another hard surface, he realized someone had merely moved him into a standing position. He was finally able to make out more of the room than the blinding overhead lights. The room was barren, painted completely white. The only other thing in the room Harry could see was a long black board, propped up across from him. It was beginning to resonate in Harry how royally fucked he truly was.
“No!” Ron gasped.
“Sir,” Ida said abruptly, “Harry’s not an Auror anymore…”
Ginny moved over to swat him, revealing a red-eyed Hermione.
Harry apparated into the living room of his house. Until he saw the shocked looks on his kids faces, he had forgotten he wasn’t supposed to be here at the moment.
“What are you talking about, mate?” Ron questioned.
“Only to prevent anything bad from getting out about him!” Blaise snapped, “We could bloody get on without his cover-up money!”
“It’s true, mate,” Remmins said solemnly, “We think it’s just people with a vendetta against muggles and muggleborns that are following out the once widespread beliefs of Voldemort.”
“Harry!” she exclaimed, quickly removing the black ink with her wand, “What are you doing here? Is everything alright?” She stood up and quickly made her way over to him to see what the problem was.
“I’m not straight. I’ve never been. Maybe I’m gay, or bi, or pan, or something else. I don’t know yet. But I like blokes,” he rambled, looking to his friend for confirmation that this was okay. That he was still Harry.
“Well, I think she believes part of her job is to keep the patient happy,” Seb said thoughtfully, “So while she moves at the speed of light to finish all of her rounds, she still makes time to adhere to all her patients needs, which includes cheering them up.”
“The Aurors were being overpowered,” Ron said, his voice hard, “You were right, Draco. There were far too many members of Kareach for the Aurors to handle alone.”
Malfoy shot Harry a glare but continued on, “Why did you choose to be a healer?”
“Harry?” Luna’s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, “Did you even watch that last play?”
“Harry, you couldn’t have…” Ginny began.
Harry began to feel angry as he left Daisy’s room. Yes, Draco had a right to be mad that Harry had gone behind his back to the Aurors and accused Blaise. But didn’t Harry have a right to be angry with Draco for being emotionally distant? For being the one who kissed him and then acting as if it was Harry’s fault he felt anything in the first place? For saying he couldn’t trust Harry to be in a relationship, or that Harry’s coming out was nothing but a phase attributed to a mid-life crisis? That was all cruel and misguided, while Harry had simply been doing what Draco had wanted in the first place. Trying to solve the mystery. Although he didn’t want to believe, he did think Blaise was the one to blame. And when that was revealed today, Draco would be needing to apologize to him.
“It’s true,” Victore piped up unhelpfully, “I’m almost positive he’s a Puddlemere fan.”
“Well, first of all, I never made a move!” Harry exclaimed angrily, “And second of all, my feelings are for a bloke!”
Harry had choked a little on his tea at Seb’s mention of LGBTQ rights. The topic was a little too close to home at the moment.
“Oh, Seamus,” Hermione said, a parallel of her address to Harry minutes before. Hermione crossed the room and embraced him, letting him cry into her shoulder.
“No, I didn’t,” He said shortly, not daring to look at Draco. He didn’t know what was happening to him, but he knew looking at Draco would only make matters worse.
“Hey, Gin,” Harry faked a yawn, “I’m knackered. I’m going to head up to bed.”
“They're expecting you,” Ron murmured to Harry as they closed the door behind them, “I’m going to go and check on Padma. Rana meant so much to her. I feel like a bloody awful Auror and friend.”
“No, I’m not!” Dom declared, “Uncle Ron said he would give me a galleon if I cheered for the Cannons!”
“I am taking that as a compliment.” Angelina said as she began to walk towards Lily, who was now shouting her name repeatedly.
“I Sorry-ed you not because I’m a sore loser, but because you’re my brother,” Roxanne pointed out.
“Looks like you need that drink more than I thought,” Seb commented softly.
“Nothing,” Molly said firmly, turning to the kids, “Private Ministry business.”
“You keep tabs on her for the next hour. Stay in this room, provide general check-ups about every fifteen minutes. Do you understand?” Harry nodded, trying to hide his surprise at the level of trust Healer Patrick was giving him in this moment. However, as soon as Patrick said a brisk goodbye and left the room, he wished she had been the one to stay with Hermione. He had no idea how to comfort a woman who found out she had taken a poison that had the ability to kill her child.
“Change?” Harry finished, “Yeah, I’ve heard.”
“Yes!” she gasped, “How did you guess?”
“Yeah,” said a voice from the doorway, “What divorce?”
“Malfoy…” Harry started.
“Because of what happened on Friday?” Harry asked.
Scorpius beamed, “I know a lot about tawny owls. Well, owls in general. But tawneys are my favorite.”
Her hair was now half in braids and half hanging around her face. As she moved to weave her fingers through another strand, Harry spoke, “Who else would it be? And if you say Aviary, I understand but I will be severely disappointed.”
“I got to Sorry Fred three times, Uncle Harry!” Roxanne said giddily, as Lily jumped out of Angelina’s lap to wrap herself around Harry’s legs.
“You almost were,” Harry murmured. He looked up at Draco, “Thank goodness you weren’t.”
“And tear Neville away from Hannah? I think not,” Ron shook his head.
“He’s a great bloke!” Aviary added.
Harry smiled, “I agree, Darius.”
Ginny nodded and pulled away from Harry, “That’s precisely how I feel. I’ve been telling myself for months that there is no logical reason for me not to be with you, Harry. But lately I’ve realized that we’ve been pulled together for so long that we felt like we were expected to end up together. So while we have both lived most of our lives with the goal of breaking expectations and doing what’s right for us and our family, we have slacked majorly in the relationship department,” she paused, “I think that’s why you quit your job, Harry. You felt the same way we now both feel about our marriage,” she froze and looked up at Harry, “I mean, how I believe we both feel.”
“Exactly,” Harry said, “We didn’t know who was involved or who information could be spread to unwittingly.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Brayan gasped, beaming down at Malfoy, “I can’t believe I almost missed your interview with my star trainee here!” he gestured towards Harry and continued, “I have much to say about Harry’s work ethic and continued successes as a trainee, and I am sure Mr. Potter has just as much to say about my influence on him as a teacher and mentor!”
“Well, he is the offspring of Harry Potter,” Draco said, “And if anyone has nerve, it’s you. I’m not saying this as a compliment, though, simply a fact.”
Ron nodded but did not look convinced. He still wouldn't look at Harry.
Harry didn’t get home until early the next morning. He ended up crashing on the couch as soon as he walked in. Harry and Malfoy had stayed in the cafe until the sun began to shine in through the multi-colored glass windows, talking about their theories for Kareach, everything from members and strategies to potential meeting places. Harry had blocked out his outburst from the night before until he apparated into his living room and saw the glasses of wine and bottles of beer still lying on tables throughout his living room. Guilt hit him hard in this moment, but before he had much time to think about it, he collapsed from complete exhaustion on the couch.
The normalcy of her appearance made the situation worse. She had created a signature crown of braids, that somehow, despite the fact she had just fought the entire Auror department, was still held up pristinely on top of her head. She was still wearing her Auror robes. She looked as if she was heading in for a day at the office.
“Healer Brayan!” Brayan exclaimed, moving to pat Harry on the back, “I’m sure Harry here has told you plenty about me over the course of your little interview!”
Harry felt a pang of guilt as he wondered if Ginny was upset over the fact he was leaving so late or whether she knew he was lying. Either way, Harry decided he needed a night to himself. He hadn’t been to his favorite pub,The Leaky Cauldron (which had been redone in the past couple years and was nothing like the grimy place Harry had first encountered years ago on his first trip to Diagon Alley), in longer than he could remember. Harry reasoned with himself. He needed a night out to clear his head and remove himself from everything. Tomorrow night he would spend time with Ginny and the kids. After telling Ginny and Lily goodnight, he walked upstairs to appear as though he was going to change into his healer scrubs. Once in his room, he pulled out his wand and focused on the outside of the Leaky as he began to feel the air compressing around him…
“Well, I for one think that people can change,” Luna said airily, “Remember when Lavender and Parvati were mean to me? Now they want me as one of their bridesmaids!”
“Love you too, Harry.”
Harry gasped when he turned the corner. The last person he would have expected had their face engulfed in flames in Harry’s fireplace.
Harry held his tongue on the numerous questions he had been forming about Malfoy’s life and answered the question, “I went into Auror training in ‘99. The training took about two years to complete. This year would’ve been my ninth year in the field.”
“So, as you all know,” Seamus said, “Dean was recently the victim of a terrible crime committed at St. Mungos.”
“It is,” Ron returned a small smile, “Because she helped me to realize that you and Ginny aren’t right for each other anymore. And that’s alright, because you will both always be in each other's lives. And in my life. Things will be different, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you two are both happy. If that means that Ginny is with Blaise and you are with Draco, so be it. You both could do a lot worse.”
“No,” Harry snapped, suddenly angry, “It’s all true! All of it! You should be doing more to stop it instead of sitting around in muggle towns!”
“I have,” Draco nodded, eyes brightening as he began to look around himself.
Harry snorted, thinking of how much of an understatement that was. As a matter of fact, he had felt particularly out of it since the interview yesterday, but he didn’t really want to unpack any of that. He had spent so much of his childhood trying to understand Draco Malfoy, the last thing he needed to let himself dwell on was the complicated man he had encountered again yesterday.
“Of course I do, Hermione!” Ginny insisted, “I just… I felt like I owed it to Harry to tell him first, you know?”
“I don’t know, are you planning on screaming at me again? Or is this not a public enough place?” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry.
“Of course, Harry. Just promise me you’ll be careful,” she whispered.
“Anyway,” Draco continued, “While nothing came out of the stakeout, I do have important news. I believe members of Kareach, or one member, planted fake evidence connecting Russians and the pub to Kareach. I should’ve known the letter was far too unlikely to happen.”
She looked back at him, “Harry, what’s going on?” she looked down at Dean and Seamus, who had stopped crying to look back at her, “What did you tell Dean and Seamus? Why is everything so sad and heavy with you lately? And why is Draco Malfoy the only one you are capable of taking comfort in?”
“It’s true,” Seamus confirmed. He leaned in to whisper to Harry, “And, we have decided that we are going to try and adopt. We are treating this extreme misfortune as a blessing in disguise. I mean, it would be amazing to give a kid born into an unfortunate life a good home.”
Luna placed her arm around his shoulder, “It’ll be okay, Harry.”
“Blaise?!” Seamus’s eyes grew impossibly large, “No fucking way! My boss, Blaise fucking Zabini!? Since when?!”
“For his safety!” Ron reiterated, “He has no Auror training. What he is investigating is extremely dangerous. As Aurors we can’t risk it.”
“Because!” Harry sputtered, “They act like a couple! With how much time they spend together and how well they know each other, I thought it was obvious! And then there was that bloody rumor Seamus told us! I can’t believe it isn’t true!”
“As long as I give Parvati or Lavender away, I guess I’d be fine with not getting to be maid of honor,” Seamus looked at Parvati imploringly.
The girls all laughed at this. “He’s playing!” Aviary exclaimed. She grabbed his arm and pointed with her beer hand around the room, “If fake Zabini isn’t your first choice, then who is?”
Harry shook his head, anger reverberating through his body, “And you agree with this, Padma?”
“I’m not going back to the Burrow, idiot,” Harry told Draco, “So tell me all the thoughts that have been swarming that poor brain of yours.”
Harry tucked into his first pie and sighed softly at the explosion of flavors. Dean laughed at him as Harry took another ravish bite but Harry didn’t care.
“No!” Aviary argued, “I’m sure the Aurors can handle it. Draco, Harry was just talking about how you two believe Kareach has been targeting you the past couple attacks! You can’t just willingly go into that!”
Angelina, thankfully noticing Lily was on the verge of tears, quickly said, “Lily, I am going to need a co-spinner,” lowering her voice to a whisper, she continued, “and my cospinner gets to eat cookies after dinner.”
Padma grinned sheepishly, “We’ve been dating for a couple weeks.”
“Hello, mate!” Seamus clapped Harry on the back as he sat temporarily in the empty seat beside them, Lily in his lap.
“Padma!” Harry called.
As soon as she released Hugo’s hand, he took off towards his group of cousins, who were now all sitting in a circle on the grass, playing what Harry assumed was duck duck goose (they really did know every muggle game in the book).
Ron nodded, “Then it’s just a matter of figuring out what the hell happened today. As of right now, we are going to hold Brayan in custody until we figure everything out.”
“Better than me,” Seb said, “I didn’t read if I didn’t have to before I got into my twenties. The only thing I wanted to do was play quidditch. I was only a few years behind you, you know. Hufflepuff. Didn’t make the team until after you left, though. Wasn’t as good as I imagined in my head.”
He moved to pull her into another hug when he heard a knock at the bedroom door. He immediately was full with worry. His kids had been sleeping for hours, so Ginny and Harry hadn’t put up any silencing charms before talking. Whatever kid had heard their conversation was bound to be even more upset than before.
“Ida, Padma and Brayan did the interviewing. So Remmins wasn’t present during the actual interrogation. But, as you know, Savant lets Aurors watch the interrogation via his pensieve,” Harry nodded again. Savant believed that having every Auror watch interrogations for big cases like this allowed the entire group to have a stronger idea of the case.
Without thinking, he told Luna he was heading to the loo and made his way through the legs of his family towards the side entrance. Harry looked through the swarm of people milling around the entrance, looking for the all too familiar blond head. After a few moments of searching, he spotted Draco alone, leaning against the bleachers with a notepad in his hand. Harry would have almost given a laugh at the sight of Draco scribbling furiously in the small notebook with his full size quill (which Harry assumed he just carried around with him) if it wasn’t for the look of panic on Draco’s face. Harry made his way through the crowd to him.
Harry moved to reach for Aviary to apparate when he felt his cell phone vibrate in his pocket. He jolted with surprise; there is only one person who would be calling him at this time of day.
“Are you sure you are alright with me staying here?” Harry asked.
Ginny pulled away, “Don’t hug me, Harry. You’ll only regret it. There’s another reason I needed to tell you I want a divorce, despite, you know, the general unhappiness.”
Soon both Albus and James were at his sides, throwing their arms around him just as their sister did. Ginny joined in a moment later, wrapping her arms around all the kids to complete the group hug. Harry lost himself in the warmth of their love, the feeling that he was once again whole.
Dean hesitated for a second before holding up his wand and grabbing Hermione. Draco let go of her legs but Ron wouldn’t let go of her arms.
She shut the bathroom door without addressing Harry, sending a clear message of general unhappiness with him. Harry decided to wait in his room until she came out. He dressed in his green trainee scrubs and then sat on the bed to wait.
Brayan told Harry to tell him if any more interviewers came around, as he had plenty more to say, and then gestured for Harry to sit down. Harry tried his best to ignore the not so subtle glare from a raven-haired girl he believed was named Sally as he passed her to get to his chair and take a seat. The young man next to him, whose name was Caser, whispered to Harry, “I liked your article. That’s exactly how I feel about healing, too. It’s the perfect job for someone who loves to help people but needs a break from the Dark Arts.”
Harry thought of all the times Draco was there for Harry, in his own weird Draco way. Harry had hidden from these parts of their friendship. He had pushed Draco away for them. And now, Ginny of all people was helping him realize this wasn’t the answer.
“It’s because I’m the Chosen One,” Harry whispered back.
Despite the fact that Harry and Ginny decided to get a divorce the night before, Christmas was actually a lovely affair. The two had decided not to tell anyone until after the quidditch tournament the following week, giving time to let their kids enjoy the holidays and tournament without thinking about the end of their parents’ marriage. They spent Christmas day, as usual, at the Burrow with the entire family. Harry could never have envisioned the talk going the way it had. For weeks he had been dreading talking to Ginny, only to have her say the exact same thing he had been thinking to him first. He felt liberated. But as much as he wanted to pretend it was only because he was relieved he hadn’t broken Ginny’s heart (as it hadn’t been his to break for awhile), a part of him knew his cheerfulness stemmed largely from the discovery that Draco and Blaise weren’t a couple. Dwelling on this, however, made him feel a bit crazy. Just because Draco wasn’t with Blaise didn’t mean anything; he could still be with someone else. Or he could just not like Harry, which was infinitely worse for Harry to consider. Opting to ignore these feelings, he focused on Christmas and Boxing day, followed closely by “Ida and Harry” day. Otherwise known as the twenty seventh of December, this was the day Ida and Harry had set aside every year, as per tradition, to talk and relax while still on holiday. As he hadn’t talked to Ida much since he had come out to her after the hospital attack, he felt it was long overdue for them to have a long and good conversation.
Draco sneered, “Yeah, right. I’m going to fuck around with the most famous wizard of our time behind his wife’s back as he figures out his sexuality only to decide he’s straight and move on. Brilliant idea, Potter.”
“Yes, you should have,” Aviary said firmly, “All the Aurors agree that you had significant reasons to believe Blaise was guilty. You also gave us reason to believe that the actual culprit is most likely a Ministry or hospital employee, in order to have the level of access they did. We are beginning to focus on the scope of the case, and that’s because of you. You must have been a damn good Auror.”
“Yeah, would you?” Albus piped in, “We want to see if someone can get it to do three back flips in a row!”
“How could you possibly accuse me of that?” Harry raged, “I would never put someone I think to be innocent in this position! Especially at your expense, Draco. I’m in love with you, don’t you know that by now?”
“That’s because that wasn’t the real reason,” James said softly.
“The only problem with your interview was the pointlessness of its existence,” Malfoy deadpanned, “And I’m here to write another article, that miraculously isn’t on you.”
“Yes, it’s true,” Brayan heaved a large sigh, “Ida was smart. It made for the perfect setup. Here I was, claiming I was a halfblood when she knew that my own father was not only a pureblood but a Kareach member. Of course, she didn’t bring up any of this in my confession. She wouldn’t expose Kareach. But Draco explained everything to me this morning. The goal of Kareach, the poison they used, the plan to use me as their scapegoat. I’ve still barely processed any of it. How terrible it all is!”
Dean opened the door and greeted the party to an excited cheer. Harry watched as Ron, Hermione, Padma, Ida and Aviary trailed into the flat.
“As in he didn’t actually take any?” Harry asked, “And he was forced to say whatever the caster wanted him to?”
Harry winced at this, “I’d like to remind you that the word ‘man crush’ is usually associated with a straight man finding another man attractive. This is not that.”
He rubbed slow circles on her back until she had calmed down enough to take normal size breaths. Finally, when she had stopped crying enough to speak, she said,
“Seamus!” Harry barked, “Steady him!”
Harry was glad he had set his tea down before Seb started talking again, he may have full on choked on it if he had been drinking when Seb said all of this. Harry had not known Seb was bi. Sure, he had a feeling Seb could be something other than straight, but the more he had spent time with Seb, the less he thought this was true. It was mainly because Seb had told him multiple stories about his ex-girlfriend Hestoria that Harry began to lean towards the straight side of things. But as Harry began to think about Seb’s words, it all made sense. Seb was still attracted to women. He could still fall in love with another woman and potentially get married. This gave him a possibility to be the Seb his friends and family had always envisioned, the one who married a woman and lived happily ever after in a heterosexual relationship. But even if that did happen, Seb was still attracted to other genders, not just females. By not coming out, he would be forever hiding a part of himself from the people he loved.
“Then what happened?” Harry demanded.
“Not for long,” Draco declared, “Now that Savant and Ida think Aviary is passed out at Harry’s house, with Ginny to cover for us if anyone shows up there, we can rest assured that Aviary will be safe.”
“Ha!” Ginny shouted, turning to Angelina. Ginny played for the Holyhead Harpies before she became the coach of the Cannons. As Angelina had always played for Puddlemere since she left Hogwarts, the two maintained a friendly rivalry over whose team was superior. And sometimes “friendly” was too kind of a term; both women were quite competitive.
“Quite a looker, isn’t he, Harry?” Hermione commented.
“But I would try for you,” Harry promised as he moved down the line, realizing that his fellow Healers were not eager to wait for Harry to chat with Lacey while they were hungry and on a time crunch.
“Hell no. Have you met Ron and Hermione? They are two of the most stubborn people I know,” Harry laughed.
Harry nodded, encouraging Ron to continue.
“Bloody prat, I was a fucking fantastic Auror!” Harry snapped.
Ron shook his head, “The healer doesn’t know everything, Hermione.”
He heard a creak at the doorway and looked up. Draco was standing there, still dressed in the clothes he wore to Blaise’s hospital room. Harry tried not to look directly at his hair or piercing eyes, which were making his heart nearly explode with the force of desire. How had he never noticed this attraction before? He couldn’t deny it; Draco made him feel things he thought impossible before. All his doubts felt futile as soon as he saw Draco framed in the doorway.
“I don’t think this is the time or place,” she hissed at Ron.
He could feel her gaze on him, “Blaise Zabini,” she half whispered.
“Harry?” Draco asked, his voice strained. He and Aviary were still gripping tightly to Harry’s arm, “Where the hell are we?”
Harry bent down to place a hand on Ron’s shoulder as Hermione asked, “Ron? I’m going to be okay. Honey, I’m here and alive. It’s okay.”
“What?” Ginny said, clearly surprised, “They are friends. Why would you think that?”
Ron took a deep breath, “Alright. The plan is to evacuate the entire building before Kareach gets here. Padma and Savant are with Ida in Savant’s office right now. They cast a bunch of charms that prevent her from leaving or contacting anyone from within the room. That shouldn’t hold her permanently, but as of right now she suspects nothing, so we should have some time. As they work in there, the rest of the Aurors and you all can help get anyone who is left in the building out safely.”
“Aviary,” he began, “I know we hardly know each other. But I couldn’t begin to imagine what you are going through. If I were to lose… someone that close to me, I would hardly be handling it as well as you are. All we can do is promise you we will avenge his death. I promise you.”
As the evening went on, the house filled up with friends, old and new. Every Ministry employee, especially the Aurors, had a look of exhaustion and weariness that they attempted to hide but couldn’t quite erase. Despite the unpleasantness of the ever-present difficulties that faced his friends and family, they all managed to let go for the night. He played countless board games with his nieces and nephews. Teddy and Victore, who were back from Hogwarts for the holidays, had managed to start a Clue club in the Gryffindor house and, as a result, were able to sweep their competition, which consisted of Dom, Parvati, George and Harry. They played five rounds before Molly came over and realized they were playing a game that glorified murder and scolded Harry, George and Parvati for letting them play during these times. They apologized sheepishly and settled on Trouble. All in all, the night was chaos and endless fun, which was exactly what Harry needed. After his fourth game of Trouble, he ended up retiring to the living room. As people came and went, Harry ended up sitting alone with Ron and Padma at one point. When Angelina, who had been drinking a firewhiskey besides him, went to find Fleur to ask her about her opinion on the new quidditch robes Reyes had ordered for the team, Harry moved to get up but Ron stopped him.
Harry tried to control his breathing. Why did Draco do that? Did he even understand how much the simple hug was affecting him? Reluctantly, he sat on the couch besides Draco. There was a strong possibility Draco didn’t share his feelings. There was also a strong possibility that Draco was in love with Blaise Zabini. Who was about ten times more attractive than he was. Right now, he needed to focus on the fact that Draco and Dean were alive and how they needed to keep it that way.
“My dad cheated on my mom!” James yelled, now addressing Ron, “With Mr. Malfoy!”
“I don’t know how she did it,” Ron said, clearly in awe, “Before I knew what was happening, Padma came out of the lift with basically all of our friends and family. Everyone was willing to fight.”
Aviary must have felt the same way. From a couple of people over, Harry saw her break her place in the shield and shoot an unexpected stupefy.
“Ida?” Draco gasped, moving abruptly from his place on the wall, “What do you mean, Ida?”
“Yes, and speaking of people who are alight, where is Dean?” Ginny said from Harry’s side. She placed a hand on Harry’s arm.
“You have no idea, Seb.”
“I am too!” Seamus insisted.
“Just for your information, James, Mr. Malfoy and I aren’t in a relationship,” he clarified, “But I am thankful for the… support? Reluctant acceptance?”
“And we are all old enough to know,” James added, “We know that not everything that happens is peaches and cream!”
“Then it’s only fair we help you, Padma,” Ida chimed in.
“You made it!” Seamus gasped, “I thought you all would be at the Ministry all night! Even the Games and Sports department has been talking about the incident nonstop.”
“I don’t,” Ida insisted, “But I don’t think you should put yourself in non-career related danger.”
“One that hopefully protects him from the hatred in this world,” Dean adds solemnly, leaning once again into Seamus’s touch.
Ginny laughed softly, “I know.”
“Then tell them the fucking truth, Potter!” Malfoy snapped.
“Never mind that!” Ron broke in angrily, “We know the poison prevents reproduction!”
“You are the best, Lace,” Harry thanked as he watched the two precious pies land onto his tray with a quick flick of Lacey’s wand, “I owe you one. I’ll see if I can get Molly to give up her ruddy shepherd's pie recipe.”
Ginny nodded, “I know that, Harry. Blaise is going to be okay, just so you know. He has his job back and everything. He won’t be head of security, but maybe that’s for the best. It was never his true passion anyway,” she looked up at Harry, “And I’m sorry to. For making a scene at St. Mungos. And, you know, outing you to the world. That wasn’t cool.”
“Yeah,” Aviary agreed, “Listen, Harry, if we made you uncomfortable, we are sorry. We weren’t planning to snog right before your statement.”
“You’re right, Hermione,” Ron placed his hand on top of hers, “We are all okay. Our family is going to be okay. That’s what I need to focus on.”
“I’m not about to play favorites, so let’s move on,” Savant declared, as he folded his arms on the desk, “Reyes, I’m sorry to say it, but it’s a trainee or bust.”
The whole group laughed at this as Seamus mocked offense. Luna and Hannah were already bubbling over what accessories they would wear to the wedding, to which Parvati and Lavender told them “anything goes.” Angelina was fighting with George over who would make a better bridesmaid (to be honest, Harry thought George could pull it off quite well). Harry was content with watching these conversations until a quidditch discussion sprung up next to him between Ginny, Ron and Seamus, in which Harry joined in to discuss the Cannons constant improvement under Ginny’s watch.
“Do you… do you think it’s him?” Ida questioned. She turned to him and grabbed his arm, “Harry, tell me all you know. You know something. We need any information.”
“Yes!” Ron shouted, wiping around in his seat, “That’s what I like to hear!”
“I think we both know I’m not either,” Harry mumbled.
Harry looked away from Hermione abruptly at this, not wanting her to see the guilt in his face.
“It wasn’t a good fit and I wasn’t happy,” he said bluntly. As a matter of fact, he still wasn’t, but at least his job was no longer the culprit.
“DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!” she yelled, “I can’t believe you! If you were upset with me, or with Draco, you can’t take that out on an innocent person!”
The three of them fell into a fit of laughter that didn’t stop when a knock sounded on the door.
“Why not?” Hermione said, wiping tears out of her eyes with her sleeve.
Harry tried not to look taken aback as he answered, “I didn’t know it was a team interview,” trying to keep any aggression out of his voice in front of Malfoy’s son.
“Not that any of us know. Did Ron tell you any more, Harry?” Bill asked.
“Teaching your daughter well, I see?” Seamus asked, grinning at Harry.
“Right here!” an out of breath Dean made his way towards Harry, “She saw you and Draco and took off.”
“We don’t need you to make excuses for Ron,” Ginny said tensely, “He’s my brother and Harry’s best friend. He should support us, not tell us we are ruining out family directly in front of our kids.”
Harry hadn’t properly talked to Blaise, well, ever. He hadn’t been expecting such gravitas from the man.
“I don’t think every none straight person is gay,” Harry mumbled, “That just came out wrong. But, anyway, none of this explains why you came over to fake talk to me.”
Harry nodded, “You’re right,” he said softly. The memories of the night began to flash before his eyes. Malfoy saying he was gay. Malfoy talking about his pet ferret. Malfoy telling him about Kareach. Malfoy saying he was gay. Harry wouldn’t have found about any of that out if he had been with Ginny. He wouldn’t have felt free to let loose. But he also wouldn’t feel as he did now; angry at Malfoy for leaving so abruptly, confused on whether or not they were on good terms.
“At least I didn’t pull a Seamus-Dean and pretend I wasn’t in love with my best friend for years,” Harry shot back.
Harry tried not to look visibly angry at this. He attempted to console himself by thinking Ginny was probably in such a bad mood after talking to coach Reyes that she didn’t think of the fact Harry would want to have a goodbye from her, especially because she wouldn’t be back until late tonight due to another team bar night.
The rest of the room broke off their chatter slowly as they turned to look at Ron.
“How do you know that?” Harry asked as Aviary opened her eyes and said, “It was?”
“I didn’t know Pansy was gay!” Harry whispered loudly, turning away so he didn’t appear as if he was staring.
“I haven’t decided if it’s ‘our’ investigation again” Draco retorted matter-of-factly.
“I will, Padma,” Harry agreed, knowing full well he couldn’t make any promises. Harry had been dreading meeting with Malfoy ever since he found out he had been the reporter assigned to his up and coming article. After finding out about his sudden change in career plans, the Daily Prophet had been quick to decide they needed an exclusive on Harry’s new life. Not wanting any ridiculous rumors to spread about what the real reason for his life change was (Harry could only imagine what certain reporters could come up with), he had decided to agree to an interview. He was regretting the decision now that Malfoy, one of the Prophet’s best reporters, was assigned to his interview, which would take place at St. Mungo’s. Harry had only heard bits and pieces about Malfoy’s new life; he knew Malfoy was married with a kid and was no longer living at the Manor. Not to mention the stories he had heard from Padma and surprisingly, Ida, saying Malfoy was different than in school. If two Gryffindors thought Malfoy was tolerable, he couldn’t be that bad, right? That thought didn’t stop Harry’s stomach from dropping every time he thought of the interview.
Harry hurried down the office to Savant’s office. He gave a knock that was immediately answered by the door swinging open. Ida was sitting on the floor of the office, papers spread like a fan around her.
“Well, I can guarantee Hermione is just as grateful for you. She’s been passionate about the rights of all magical non-humans, especially house elves, ever since I’ve known her,” Harry said.
“Well,okay,” Ginny paused, “I love you, Harry. So much.”
As Harry turned to walk down the corridor, hoping to kill some time before apparating to the very meeting he was dreading, he spotted the perfect distraction. Padma was walking down the hallway towards her office, a large pile of papers balanced precariously on her arms.
“George is still taking all the necessary security precautions as well, right, Angelina?” Arthur asked worriedly, no doubt thinking about all the possible things that could be poisoned effectively in WWW.
“I suspect that Darren’s not overly fond of kite Darren, though,” Albus admitted, “He seemed to be glaring at us while we were making it.”
“Then what did Seamus tell me last night?” Dean challenged.
Harry moved to leave, but Hermione grabbed his arm, “There is no way in hell you are leaving. You needed someone to confide in, and it can be me. I know you are dying to tell me who this mystery man is, so you can. I’m here for you.”
Harry sat down beside him as Ron continued to speak, “Aviary said she didn’t recognize the voice. Which makes very little sense, because the only people in the interrogation room at the time were Savant, Ida and Padma. Not that I think it was any of them. But they are the most likely options if someone was indeed casting an Imperius curse.”
Everyone laughed as Ginny pulled them in once again for a group hug. For the first time in months, Harry was starting to truly believe that everything was going to be alright.
“James!” Ginny exclaimed.
The bright early morning sun was streaming through the curtains in Harry’s bedroom, making it impossible for him to go back to sleep. He chose to sit up in bed, head propped against his three pillows as he replayed the previous night at Dean and Seamus’s apartment in his head. Seamus had told Harry that Draco was not only upset over their argument, but upset enough to tell Blaise about it. Draco obviously valued their friendship to some degree, perhaps more than Harry had thought. Sure, there were plenty of times, like last Sunday, when Draco had told Harry to come to the park just so he could run his thoughts by him. But there were other times where Draco seemed still reluctant to share information with Harry, as if it cost him too much to share everything with him. Harry knew they had created a friendship of sorts, but he didn’t know how Draco regarded that friendship. Then again, Draco had agreed to call Harry by his first name, something Harry couldn’t have envisioned in his wildest dreams. The event was so momentous Harry could hardly believe he had basically forced Draco to call him Harry the week before. Maybe it all goes to show they have created a legitimate friendship that either of them knew how to handle. That, Harry reasoned with himself, is why he felt a strange feeling to hug Draco the other day. The two had formed an unlikely friendship that neither was prepared to handle. They actually cared about each other no. There wasn’t any way for that not to be weird, right?
Taking a deep breath, he braced himself as he looked up at Draco, the words of Blaise’s interrogation on his lips, when Draco moved forward.
“I need to tell you something,” Harry stated, looking directly into Malfoy’s eyes and hating himself for how much he liked how blue they were. Maybe he wasn’t really over his recent selection of Mafloy out of the room full of blokes as the one who would provide the best shag.
“So Sirius was the original secret keeper?” Aviary asked, “For the Fidelus charm?”
“Yes,” Harry muttered, not really wanting to think about his two friends shagging.
“Are you planning on working on the Ground Floor once we’re out of training?” Harry asked.
“Ida, I wanted to. But I promised Draco I wouldn’t talk to anyone about it. We wanted to be as cautious as possible,” Harry decided to leave out the fact he had told Padma and Ron.
She turned back towards the group, “Who’s ready for the wedding of the century?”
“I know. Don’t think I didn’t notice you don’t sleep most nights,” Ginny responded, looking over at Harry, “You can talk about whatever is wrong, you know.”
The Healer who was sitting across from Harry (he thought her name was Mary) sent Dean a quick look and he stopped talking about the attacks. Harry knew that the Third and Fourth floors were most likely under strict secrecy to the findings on the mysterious attacks, so he opted to stop pushing for answers. He would know soon enough if either the Aurors or healers figured out what the poison was.
As she raised her eyebrows in anticipation, Harry told her about how he hadn’t been going to the therapy sessions they had talked about months ago.
As Harry made his way into the room. Aries head snapped up. He glared instantly, “You’re Ginerva’s husband,” his eyes narrowed threateningly.
“Are you alright, Harry?” Seb asked. He began to turn around to see what Harry was looking at, but Harry reached out and pulled Seb to him in one quick move. Without stopping to think, he kissed Seb.
“Ginny,” Harry warned, shooting a glance at Ida.
“Years ago,” Ida continued haughtily, “Brayan’s father, Gert Foget, found the poison, a rare and popularly unheard of one, in a small city in Cambodia. Once we found out the properties stunted the reproduction of whoever took it,” she emphasized, looking smugly at Harry and Draco in turn, “We knew it was the perfect poison. Kareach has arranged their entire plan to rid the world of muggles around the poison ever since. Ironically, the perfect scapegoat to go down for our crimes was none other than Foget’s son, Darius Brayan. You see, Foget’s wife, Annabelle, was a pureblood just like him. But she, being the filthy blood traitor she was, believed that Foget’s devotion to Kareach was unacceptable. She left Foget and took her son, Darius. She remarried years later to a muggle and told her son, a pureblood, that he was half muggle. While this is all very upsetting, it worked out for us. You see, Brayan has reportedly told everyone he knows that he is a halfblood, when in reality, he is descended from one of the oldest pureblood families in the world, based in Egypt. After being accused, he looked guilty. Pretending he wasn’t a pureblood? Working at the hospital as a cover-up? How could it not be him? This all made his confession that much easier. I’ve gotten so good at the Imperius curse that it was easy to cast the curse on him while my colleagues believed he was on Veritaserum. How fucking Remmins realized he was cursed, I have no idea. But he’s dead now. And soon you two will be.”
“Lily Luna, don’t hit,” Harry reprimanded. He looked up at James and sighed, “Just let her walk for now. There’s no use in carrying her if she’s going to fight you the entire time.”
“Remmins is dead,” Ron choked. Harry watched as tears brimmed in the corners of his eyes.
“Not to mention the fact we’ve been best friends since we were eleven,” Dean added.
“I still can’t believe he set the shed on fire! That’s some powerful magic right out of the gate!” Arthur exclaimed to Bill, twirling his own wand in the air, “My first magical “accident” so to speak was making a pebble float by looking at it! Hardly impressive, I have to say.”
Ron nodded. Harry wondered what he was thinking, whether he was still mad at Harry for being Draco’s friend.
“I would bloody disown her,” Ron mumbled, wincing as Hermione sent a fierce glare his way.
When Harry came out of his thought spiral, he realized he was still in Draco’s living room. He needed to talk to him; he couldn’t run away again, not now. Harry began to walk towards the hallway.
“I’m the one who came up with it!” Ida shot back, “I’ll explain.”
“I’ll just do everything in my power to prove I’m not that man,” Darius said, as if he was reassuring himself, “I’m not that man and I will never be him.”
As two more deep red filled glasses came sliding to a stop in front of Malfoy, he shot Harry an annoyed look but didn’t move as he took a small sip from the new glass of wine nearest to him.
Harry recognized a list of assignments on the door of room 06. Under the words ‘Aries Reyes’ were instructions on what to do to check up on the patient. As a trainee, Harry wasn’t in charge of healing the patient in any way. He could only help with that under the supervision of a Healer. For this rotation, he was in charge of checking up on patients after they had been healed but weren’t yet cleared to leave.
Tears ran down Ginny’s cheeks, “Only once,” she whispered, “Unless you count the feelings I’ve had for months, edging on a year. Harry, I’m so sorry. I made a mistake. I was lonely and sad one night, and I didn’t think. But you were so distant, and you were constantly lying. I needed another source.”
“You should be good to go home tomorrow, Mr. Potter,” the Healer Mateh said.
Padma looked at Pansy and then said, “It was after the whole scone throwing debacle. I realized that the real reason I was so upset with Pans had nothing to do with her political opinions.”
Despite his best efforts, the tears began to flow more; hard and fast down his face. He crumbled to the floor and pulled his face into his knees. Then he began to cry like he hadn’t allowed himself to in years. The nightmare of the day had begun to flash through his mind. Draco rejecting him after their kiss. Hermione’s piercing scream setting his world on fire. Fleeing the quidditch stadium. Working side-by-side with the man who had just rejected him to save dozens of patients while he internally panicked. Finding out about Hermione’s pregnancy. Draco telling him their kiss was just a mistake. Harry’s life hadn’t been this out of control since his time at Hogwarts. He felt like the fourteen year old who was forced to complete a maze riddled with challenges, watch a seventeen year old be killed and then fight the darkest wizard of all time all in one afternoon.
Harry grabbed a shirt and walked towards Seb, “Let’s get the fuck to the pub.”
“Well, at least I can still get at least one hex in per day. To keep me sane,” Malfoy said, smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, “Are you sure, Potter?”
“Then don’t fuck it up,” Hermione said matter of factly.
Harry looked at his son, tears building up again, “James…”
It took all of Harry’s remaining courage (which was hardly any, after the day he’d had) to tell Hermione the truth.
“Of course,” James added, “Sibling meetings, you wouldn’t understand.”
To break the silence, Harry asked, “Do you think they choose the hospital because of you? Because you were there?”
“Hesser couldn’t score a goal if someone put him a foot in front of it and put the keeper on the other side of the field!” Rose yelled. Hesser was one of the Cannon’s chasers.
“Pansy dragged me here tonight,” he stated, as if that explained everything.
Harry slowly opened his eyes, bright lights obstructing his vision as he tried to place his surroundings. Ron materialized in front of him, all red hair and freckles. Harry then saw Ron’s dark Auror robes and everything that happened came rushing back to him. He shot up quickly and frantically looked around.
“Okay, okay,” Astoria reached for Scoprius, “Hopefully I will see you around the hospital, Mr. Potter.”
“Victims are now being sent directly to the canteen!” Harry shouted, “Any available personnel needed.”
“Next,” Seb said conversationally as if nothing had happened, “We are planning on organizing a LGBTQ wizarding rights protest. It’s out of my technical career bonds as an activist, since I deal primarily with non-human rights, but I have many dimensions and it needs to be done. Well, done more often. There’s been protests before.”
