Potter gave a sort of bark of laughter, which was unexpected, but melted the bit of frost from the depths of Draco's heart. He couldn't help but grin.
"Are you kidding me right now?" Harry frowned. "You're seriously more upset about being grounded than about the fact that we're having our second kid and we're not even ready?"
"Hey-"
"Your son," Draco repeated in a whisper. He didn't bother to tell Potter that his first conclusions had been correct. He wasn't lying when he said that he was rarely mistaken. But all thought had left him when he was suddenly overwhelmed by the fact that
"It's- well I'm not sure exactly what to think of it, though it feels strangely familiar," he admitted. He was surprised when Potter seemed to have expected his reaction.
"How are you holding up, son?"
"...before these two Families of Noble Blood do we Name our new Heir, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, to uphold the integrity of our lineage and..."
It was such a private and tender moment that Draco felt he was intruding. Watching Potter's attention flicker between his son and godson made him feel something in the pit of his stomach. Actually seeing Potter make googly eyes at his son while he arranged the little pillows around him in the bassinet made something in his heart ache.
To be frank, it all interested him because of the magic. He had already known that Potter and Weasley had had some sort of a relationship after the war. However, the actual fact had never come to mind in recent years until now, so Draco knew that it was because of the
"Indeed, he did."
"Ginny, have you refreshed the Temperature Charm?" He had discovered earlier on that James was easily bothered when a room became too warm and stuffy. Now that the weather was transitioning, the fire was still necessary, so he had kept up a Temperature Charm to act as a thermostat for James and ensure he was comfortable.
"That's... is that what you plebeians do?" he asked, though without venom. "Purebloods have much more to worry about, and child rearing is only one of the many responsibilities."
grinning in spite of himself,
"Apart from the odd fluctuations, she hasn't had any serious malfunction. However, it was enough to cause a disturbance in the contraceptive charms so it might be better to monitor this progressively. I would appreciate if you could come in regularly for checkups."
He couldn't help it, but he had the innate desire to delve more into the mystery that was Draco Malfoy, and to see the world in the Slytherin's perspective.
"Hey, it's just me," Ron said, smiling tentatively, staying by the door. "Hermione told me to check on you in case you had decided to escape using that cloak of yours."
The training grounds of the Auror Corps took up a sizeable chunk of the Ministry. Being underground like all other Ministry offices, it took a lot of magical infrastructure to create a complex wherein Aurors and Aurors-in-training could hold classes, duels and all sorts of offensive and defensive spellwork. There were even rooms similar to the Room of Requirement, and Harry thought it was brilliant that they could stage mock attacks and create all sorts of possible scenarios that they would eventually face once they were Aurors.
Also, I'm not just randomly adding in angst or something to twist you up hahaha. The precarious relationship between Ginny and Harry is very tricky to write realistically, but I have seen it in real life  with one of my best friends who has  a child with a woman from another country. Their relationship has been almost like this, with sacrifices being made from both sides, making the thing work but not exactly in a perfectly happy way. They both try, though, and I think Harry, being Harry, would always want to fix things, and Ginny, wanting everything in her life to be perfect, will also want to try.
"She's aspired to be Chaser for the national team," Ron said. "But she's got to realize that those kinds of dreams have to take a bit of a backseat. She's got a kid, for Merlin's sake."
Harry laughed and accepted another glass of whiskey.
Harry blinked stupidly, as if seeing her in a different light. He knew how much this must have hurt her, and he had vowed to himself before, never to make her choose between whatever made her happy. If she could have everything, he would give it to her. He felt guilty.
: (shrugs)
"Nothing in the old records?" Draco asked from the fire.
Potter's interest seemed piqued at the possible new lead. He liked having something for his team to do on the field. "Anything else?"
"I'll watch," the boy offered with a grin.
"Are you sure?'
: I won't go into detail. But it was the one thing Dumbledore taught me, to understand an enemy. That's how I defeated Tom Riddle. I think that's enough answers from me for now. I'm sure you have other things you want to ask about.
Harry nodded and grasped Ginny's had even tighter. She squeezed back, seeming to understand how he felt at the moment and perhaps needing him as well.
The funny thing about that was, it was dependent on the people around Harry. He didn't have control over what they thought, but their own minds came up with various explanations for whatever Harry wanted unseen. Once, he had brought James with him under a full set of privacy wards, and no one even noticed anything out of the ordinary. Not even one witch, who had merely commented on the weather after bumping into him. So the fact that Malfoy even noticed Harry's awkward arms around James had shaken him, and it left him tense all throughout the call.
"I think that one's done," Malfoy's voice (which sounded alarmingly close), startled Harry enough to realize that yes, he had completely zoned out while cooking. He transferred the rescued pancake from the pan and added one last batch. "Teddy, why don't you go bounce on your Uncle Ron and see if he wakes up." The boy let out an exuberant giggle and ran out of the kitchen. Draco moved closer and peeked over his shoulder, as if taking down mental notes on making the perfect breakfast.
thereby guaranteeing that they wouldn't be noticed or overheard while speaking in confidentiality.
"Sometimes…" Draco whispered, "sometimes it's just hard to admit to myself, that I feel so weak sometimes and have to depend on you. Remember the Fiendfyre? And… at the trials… now this. This binding you've willingly shared with me of all people…"
Ginny tried to look at him beseechingly. "They think being away for close to six months is enough time..." her words trailed off as if she were afraid of how the rest of the sentence would affect Harry. Instead, she bit her lip nervously.
"Is it… good?"
"Hey, Malfoy!" the Auror said conversationally, as if they had planned this conversation.
"Sorry," Potter offered with a weak smile. "I was sort of in a hurry when I sent you that owl. But evidently, your messenger was more effective than my Patronus messages to Ron and Hermione. Go figure."
"I'm not quite sure what you mean, Draco." Pansy's voice was full of doubt, even through the flames. Draco had known her long enough to notice it.
And the connection closed.
"Not my favorite year, either," Harry offered with a shrug. He still got shivers whenever he thought about that night in the graveyard…
When it seemed that she had nothing else to say, he excused himself and left the room.
When both families had gathered in the delivery room around Astoria, Draco couldnt help but stare in awe at the little bundle of life, moving around in Astoria's arms. His wife looked so tired and fragile, which was to be expected after just giving birth to her first child, but Draco noticed the emergence of the strength of her character- she obviously wanted and needed to rest, but was holding herself up throughout the naming ritual. He felt such a rush of admiration, once again reminding himself how lucky he was to have bumped into her at the bookstore.
Draco felt a little indignant when he realized that he had only gotten an owl. Didn't he get the intimate privilege of a personal Patronus message, too?
Late into the night, Draco found Potter staring at the fire with a contented look on his face while everyone else was currently too busy to notice, helping to clear up the evidence of their inebriation.
Harry realized that the blonde was alone, and was standing awkwardly before their booth. With slight reluctance, he said, "Er, would you, er, care to join us?"
"Well, there you go!" Ron cried, "she said no! She said no, Harry! She doesn't want me, Ha-Harry!"
Ginny chewed on her lower lip, which Harry knew meant that she was trying to find the best words to soften the heavy blow that she was about to give. "Erm… I was actually thinking of… well, I'm not exactly the best parent, but shuffling the kids between us every other week just isn't working. In fact, I think it makes Jamie have more tantrums."
Draco shook his head in amused disbelief. "Of course I'd rather spend my time with my own flesh and blood than play masquerade with strangers who could care less about me beyond my social standing. I've experienced the ideal pureblood childhood, as did she, and I am quite sure at this point in my life that I didn't quite appreciate how much I was missing back then. I refuse to make the same mistake to Scorpius, especially now that I understand what a difference it can make for Astoria and me to be more... present."
Ron looked at Harry pointedly, and they had a two second silent discussion, after which the former relented and said, "Yeah, I s'pose. By all means, join our merry-making." Harry noticed that Ron was at least distracted from his misery, so that was probably a good idea. Nothing could possibly be worse than their previous topic.
"I see. My apologies, then" Draco said, now understanding why Potter had appeared to be waiting for him by the fire. "Well, thanks for taking my call anyway, Potter. I'll send you anything else I discover tomorrow."
It took most of the day, but Draco had finally resolved his inner conflict by deciding to pretend as if he hadn't just made the biggest discovery of all time. It wasn't as if he had sufficient evidence to fuel his suspicions, but his acute level of perception (developed by his father, of course) had never failed him. He had thought it over again and again in his head, using both inductive and deductive reasoning, and he was quite confident that Potter was definitely hiding something big, and that the most possible probability was that he had at least one child, and was keeping it completely secret.
Ginny nodded. "Other than that, it's perfect, Harry. I'm glad you finally found this place. You were driving us mental, you know."
: Oh but it's one of our most common. Everyone knows of your intellect and work ethic. You, along with Ms Weasley and Ms. Lovegood, are looked up to by young girls everywhere because you all represent to them what they can achieve against all odds.
"Gin…"
Naturally, no one else but those nearest Harry and Kingsley could hear the exchange, so majority of the people present still had looks of confusion stamped on their faces.
Hermione shrugged, then picked up Hugo, bouncing him gently in her arms in an effort to soothe him. "Don't even get me started," she sighed. "I hadn't even had any plans of having a child this early, much less two children."
"Yes, yes, but I got a call from-" she stopped, looking suddenly behind him. With a jolt, Harry remembered that Malfoy was with them.
Draco rushed out of the bathroom in response to his wife's growing impatience. She knew him well enough to know that he took great pride in grooming himself, taking special care that his soft hair always fell around his face in just the right way, but
Harry nodded in defeat - Arthur was still his elder - so he shook himself and felt as if he was coming back to his senses again for the first time that day. He hadn't realized how numb he had become to the rest of the world while he was stuck in his cocoon of worry.
Harry was confused. "No, and no," he answered smoothly. "Thought I was aware that both of them are currently abroad, I would have come by here regardless of their presence or not. We do want to be here for you, I don't know why you can't get your head around the fact."
Harry visibly relaxed at that. She was right. He would finally get the private life he deserved, away from prying eyes, as soon as this cross-country tour was over and done with. With what he had up his sleeve, there was no way he wouldn't be able to get what he wanted. The wizarding world owed him as much.
Their conversation was interrupted by Ron's reemergence from the wards. As they all stood up and waited for him to speak, it seemed to Harry that the very air around them flowed with so much love, affection and support, and it warmed his heart. Ginny carefully balanced James on one hip so that she could lay her other arm around her brother's shoulders. Molly gave him a quick hug before inquiring silently with her eyes. Harry could see the Ron's face turning slightly red, and to their surprise, he gave a weak smile.
"Ah," Ron said with a mockingly wise tone of voice. "You have gone the way of the Doormat."
"But she has an idea the amount of deep shit you currently are?"
Harry understood her silent "but", so he decided to bring it up to confirm his fears. "This was necessary because…?"
Draco laughed, brandishing his own glass. "I find that non-magic whiskey sometimes burns more on the way down than Firewhiskey, which is saying something. Now, what's wrong?"
Ginny rolled her eyes in amusement at Harry's inarticulate state. "He means, we've been using the contraceptive charm very religiously over the past year, particularly after having Jamie," she added guiltily.
Astoria and Narcissa had agreed to stay within Malfoy Manor in the meantime, his wife tending to Scorpius and his team of child rearing elves. His mother had placed her attention to researching about the Manor's wards in an attempt to find out how the first threat had managed to break through at all. While all of them were under strictly discreet Auror protection, Draco was at least allowed to do as he pleased outside of the Manor grounds.
He was in the fucking tower! Draco immediately thought back to that dreaded memory he had tried in vain to forget. The first feeling that flooded him was shame. Then guilt. Then... what? Annoyance? Anger? The thought that Potter had been there with him after all changed the way he felt about it. Was he relieved that there was at least one person who had seen him drop his wand to Dumbledore, seen that he didn't have the heart after all? Or was he outraged that his enemy had seen him, twice now, in a moment of extreme weakness and failure? His hand subconsciously went to his chest, fingering the scar that was invisible to all but him.
Draco considered his mother's idea. The Malfoy wards were formidable, but so were the Black Family wards. Maybe those two combined…
Draco hissed.
It was close to three in the morning, and he didn't want to interrupt Astoria's much-needed beauty sleep. With the round-the-clock attention from the nursing house-elves that Narcissa had arranged, he and his wife could enjoy more time for rest and relaxation, and he knew that they needed to be refreshed come morning.
"Malfoys never lose their temper," she told him with an air of dignity.
Harry just scoffed. "It doesn't work that way. And no, it won't happen in a while, I'm sure of that. Probably in years. Come on," he said suddenly, shaking his head and trying to change the topic. "No need for us to worry about this
"Lady Malfoy," he greeted formally, before presenting her with a bouquet that he had been hiding behind his back. "May you accept our congratulations on this very auspicious day of your son's birth."
Putting his face in his hands, Harry finally let out his frustrations and fell to sobbing into his palms. He felt his shoulders shake beyond his control, but he couldn't care less at this point. The worry he felt for both Ginny and their child was reaching a plateau and he had no idea how to process any of the emotions he was feeling. Everything seemed tight and stretched to the limit, and Harry felt as if everything holding him together was at the brink of snapping and pulling him apart.
Harry rested his forehead on one of his hands, hiding his eyes. He felt so tired these past few weeks. "So you only think you know what I called you two here for?"
Draco wasn't expecting any call, but he couldn't say he was surprised by Potter's head appearing in his fire. It was fast becoming a habit for them to invade each other's privacy at around eleven on the oddest of nights.
"It's what he's grown up with, Harry, so give him a break," Ron said quickly.
"I don't have time for your petty games, or your rather unhealthy fascination with me or my family," Draco spat out. "I've better things to do than waste my time on you,
Draco couldn't help but let out an uncharacteristic guffaw. It was always ironic for him that Potter was the Savior of the entire Wizarding world, but it was still so easy for wizards to doubt his sanity.
He felt Scorpius stir, the little body moving just that much to cuddle towards him.
"Historically, the Ministry, and its Aurors, were not always so deserving of such trust."
"So, Gin," he said, turning to her. "How was training this week?"
Her reaction made Draco wonder silently, if this was what it felt like to be needed and wanted in someone's life that a simple agreement to show up meant everything to them.
She replied with a slight nod and a determined look on her face. "Thank you. For everything."
Potter's comments had been calm to begin with, before escalating to passive-aggressive self-doubt.
"Why have you taken me here?" he demanded with narrowed eyes, maintaining his haughty composure despite the creeping panic in his chest.
"Undetectable Displacement Charm," he answered proudly. "Same family as   the Undetectable Extension Charm, except instead of extending a small space infinitely, I've simply Displaced the roof top upwards by.. a lot of floors." He grinned at her amusement. His eyes took in the late afternoon sky, tinged with pinks and oranges, the unsuspecting Muggles walking to and fro beneath them. "I wanted a space where I could go to, to clear my mind. I've always felt better in the air than on the ground, so I thought of this neat trick. What do you think?"
"We can handle it, Harry," she said comfortingly, her hand squeezing his arm gently. "We've always been able to go with whatever Fate throws our way, right?"
"See, was that so hard?"
It was only then that Harry remembered that Arthur was still with them. He shifted to look at the man and was surprised to see him smiling warmly at Malfoy.
the brunet had repeatedly asked in frustration.
"So, Ferret," Ron teased, beer in hand, "for what particular reason did you finally succumb to the call of the pint?"
The man rose dramatically and got as close to Draco as he could without touching. "Seems I've finally broken you, eh? As a matter of fact, it will be -"
: (incoherent language)
Potter merely gave an enthusiastic nod in agreement. "I remember, it was all dark corners and creepy shadows all around. That's why I demolished two of the walls there-" he pointed, "so it opened up this space more. I also updated the kitchen to accommodate both magical and Muggle appliances so I could use it efficiently."
"You've lost me." Draco was feeling more perplexed. Was this behavior to be expected? And truly, the child was not part of the plan, but he had thought that they'd agreed he, their son, was a blessing. He had no idea where these sentiments were coming from, nor what they even meant. And who was never letting go?! He certainly wasn't aware of pressuring her in any way...
"No, I was named by my grandfather."
"This is a decent enough break," Potter said, shrugging. "It's a sight better than my situation before you got here, anyway."
"I'm sorry," Potter suddenly blurted out. His bottle green eyes were on the floor, and his hands absentmindedly fidgeted. "For earlier, I mean. I didn't mean to get angry or anything."
"What-" Too many questions appeared in Draco's mind as he took another survey of the interior. Now that he thought about it, he could see a bit of the old house that he and his mother used to visit on occasion. Yes, it had been Great Aunt Walburga's, and he used to be scared of this place.
Draco couldn't help but shake his head in disbelief. "I can't imagine what you said that could have convinced her to change such a well-established routine," he said, eyeing his mother with some trepidation. "I'm guessing I don't have much of a choice, either?"
Weasley, however, seemed worse for wear, collapsing in a heap on one of Potter's couches. His loud snoring told Draco that he was now quite alone with Potter, and he wasn't sure how to be comfortable in the home of a former adversary. It wasn't something they taught in the Little Wizard's Book of Etiquette, of course. To distract himself, Draco decided to focus on his surroundings.
"No, Potter," Malfoy spat out in spite of himself. "Obviously I was saving all the information up for the next Dark Lord to use against the Golden Boy of the Wizarding World."
"I just want you to be happy, Draco," Narcissa said sincerely. "Truly happy. For that to happen, you need your wife, your son, and your friends. I've made the mistake of telling you to only focus on family, but it is evidently clear that being away from your new friends is detrimental. You are a wonderful husband, and an exceptional father. But I do not think that is enough."
Harry nodded. He hadn't felt this restless in a long time, and he wanted to spring into action. However, he also knew that going Gryffindor was not the best tactic in his line of work - he had to be more Slytherin in order to outwit the wizards he was hunting. "Send that new information over to Macmillan's team," he instructed Ron. "I want them to narrow down the traders who still personally procure the stuff they sell. They'll probably be the specialty apothecaries, the more expensive ones." Malfoy had told him last week that he suspected this was a high-class potion, and that the makers would want only the best organic, hand-picked ingredients.
that you're the only one who seems to find something about me to whine about, because obviously there's a reason for your months of hard work just to get me here. So what is it, eh? Money? That's something I could have given you freely. Did you just want to humiliate me to my face? That sounds somewhat juvenile, don't you think?"
right now. It was
That was when the endless stream of questions just kept going, and Draco knew that he could do nothing to allay these intimate thoughts - the best he could do at this point was to keep them to himself.
Harry thought about it. "Well I think he was able to grasp that Ron and I want to keep it on the down low about both the case and his secret connection to the Ministry. Viridian was the last place the three of us had a drink, so it would make sense that we would meet up there again for casual friendly banter. He's also got a good reason to be there without suspicion, and so do Ron and I."
"I've never had to tell anyone before. You caught me off guard just by asking." Potter was now biting his lip, which Draco found mildly distracting.
"Oh, no, it's not, um... I'm glad you're here," Harry appeased, shaking his head and wiping his eyes quickly with the back of his hand as he turned more to face Malfoy. He gestured his free hand towards the seat next to him, indicating to Malfoy that he could take a seat.
Draco shook his head. "No, that was all. But I was wondering…Er, Weasley?"
Hermione took hold of Harry's free hand and gave it a squeeze. "We're here for you, Harry. Regardless of whether we agree or disagree on anything, we're always going to be here to support you, especially when you need it the most."
"Sorry, Muggle expression. But anyway, what I mean is, there's probably a very good explanation for her fainting. Maybe she was just stressed out today and it didn't show."
"You know this is somewhat flattering," he started, trying for a bored tone. "I never thought I'd ever be so important to anyone so as to be the center of their entire life, but…here we are."
"Are you and Astoria doing well?"
"We'll have your back," Ron said very seriously. "A couple of
of all people, to lend his support?
"I don't fantasize-"
Several weeks after they felt comfortable with the changes, Harry made a specific change to the wards, making their relationship 'available' to the public once again, to an extent.
Ron, having heard everything from his desk, had leapt closer to the fire. "Hey, Malfoy, just relax, alright? Now, let's go through this logically. Are you sure the warding ritual was a viable one? I mean, are you sure it had historical precedence?"
He found himself slowly stepping towards her as if drawn by her gravity. He had given up a lot. He had made compromised. But this decision. This was the huge leap that he had never wanted to ask for. This was the grand gesture that Ginny was making to show him that she was serious.
They both ended up laughing at their pointless conversation. Finally Harry couldn't take it anymore.
"Too bad 'Chosen One' wasn't high enough of a status, I guess" Harry quipped.
"It's a fact that I can't exactly handle them when I'm by myself, at least not at this point. But I… well, it's crossed my mind before… erm…"
"You're supposed to be in France," was Harry's greeting. He deserved to skip the formalities and etiquette given that Malfoy had just called and caught him in a just-woke-up-still-in-boxers moment.
The little boy, just turned eight, was now a boisterous bubble of energy (or more so than he had already been when Draco had met him) but this was easily diverted by now having two outlets for his entertainment - Uncle Harry and Cousin Draco.
"Hermione did that for me," Harry said. Malfoy looked up from the carpet and they stared at each other in silent sympathy. "I mean, after the war. She and Ron stayed here for a bit to keep me company after all the... all the trauma. I couldn't really be left alone for a while."
"But then, I always used to dream of Voldemort when we were still at Hogwarts." Harry paused here. He had no idea why he was telling this much to Malfoy, of all people, but it seemed right. "No one but the Order knew, but I had a connection to Voldemort's mind."
"As if you need to remind me again, thanks," she replied coldly. "Yes, Harry, I am quite aware, and it doesn't make me feel too good about myself. But I also have a life, and this is just another responsibility that I have. You've got your job, and I've got mine!"
Draco snorted. "Understatement of a lifetime," he agreed. "After that, Father became a servant once more, and I think he both loved and loathed the fact. He was a noble pureblood, but there he was acting like a footman to- to someone like Voldemort."
"No! I just - I'm glad to be closer to being an Auror. It feels like my life is on track and my purpose is crystal clear. I'm pretty excited about graduating and being inducted into the Corps."
"I wonder why he wants to meet up there again," Hermione said contemplatively. "Nothing wrong with it, just, of all the other possible places…"
At that moment, he glanced his reflection in the window and realized that he had an almost comically manic grin on his face. If the writers at the Daily Prophet could have seen it, he was sure there would be an immediate wave of new headlines speculating his sanity. The Boy-Who-Went-Mental, perhaps? Or Gryffindor Goes Gaga? Maybe they could get Malfoy to give them a few of his creative titles. At this, Harry laughed heartily at himself. He was in such a good mood that even thinking of Malfoy couldn't dampen it.
As expected, he got a reaction from the wizard, who merely glared at him. "Shove off, Malfoy."
"No," Harry interrupted Ron. "I don't want anyone else in on this just yet." He didn't say it out loud, but he truly felt like he owed Draco at least a modicum of privacy. This was the sort of news that would propel the Prophet into another maelstrom of irresponsible journalism and mob mentality. Forget the fact that Draco might be the poisoned victim in danger of actually dying, but people were probably going to jump on the sensational aspects of the case - illegal potions, shady history, anything to get more readers.
Oh. Apparently he was mistaken, then.
"Does this have anything to do with something you and Mr. Potter talked about today?" she inquired. Draco nodded.
When Draco had agreed half-heartedly, said goodbye and cut the call, Harry turned immediately to Ron. "So, are we really making any progress on Howe?"
He sat, expecting a reply, or at least a biting remark, but Malfoy just looked at him with a raised brow.
"Which charm did you put, sir?" Ella asked curiously.
"So why is it just the two of you this weekend?" Draco asked while sipping his tea. He and Harry had finally gotten Teddy to bed after an interesting session of story time - Draco would
"She should have," Harry agreed. "But she didn't. Neither did I, if you recall. Like I said, we didn't realize that we needed to really grow into ourselves on our own first. We didn't. i think we both acted on impulse, we both had our own reasons to prove ourselves. And... Now we're here, and we've agreed that we won't regret any of it, or blame each other for our disillusioned choices after the war."
Since he and his wife had regularly visited the country during their courtship and engagement, they had already acquired several estates to their name, and it was to the Maison Blanc that the family Apparated to.
"How are you feeling?" he asked, worried.
"Happy happy happy happy happy happy birthday, Harry! It's your birthday! It's your birthday! Let's get cake!!!"
Draco turned to his mother. He knew that she, with limited exposure to the muggle world, would be doubting the entire process. But at this point, he was pretty much desperate for any solution, and all it would take was a reading of their aura and their family bloodline. Perhaps, he would pursue this interesting branch of muggle studies, but for now, his only concern was how it could help Scorpius.
Harry realized that it was much harder than he thought to get it to come out smoothly and naturally, but he got it anyway.
"Yes, I must insist," Narcissa said, crossing her arms. "I have already asked Astoria to include both you and Scorpius in her itinerary for France, which should have been the original plan to begin with."
"Scorpius," Malfoy said. "I've always liked Scorpius."
find that lucky girl within the year, you'll owe me twenty galleons."
"Hang on," Apollo interrupted. "I think I know which tracking charm you put. It's latched onto magical signatures, right?" When Harry and Ron nodded, he frowned. "We'd better get on it, because I know that sort of charm requires consent from next of kin to activate."
Draco kept his words to himself. He was sick of defending himself anyway.
Back in his room, Draco brought out a copy of the official announcement for his trial. The words were unbelievable, but they were right there in front of him. And just thinking about it put a small smile on his lips. It was such a different expression from his usual Malfoy smirk, but he couldn't help it - one year seemed a long time, but he knew it would run by quickly if he spent his time wisely.
Draco thought about it. There was something about Potter and Weasley needing him that made him want to laugh in their faces. But of course, that was the spurned young Slytherin in him. No, if he were being honest with himself, there was now an urge to rush to his former enemies and offer his hand to them. Even more shocking, there was a small part of him, a miniscule part, of course, but a part nonetheless, that recognized someone in need and wanted to do anything to help.
"Oh don't kid me, Harry!" Hermione cried exasperatedly, very obviously close to her berserk mode. He'd better watch it. "People always seem to have something to say about what I'm doing wrong, and what I can't seem to do to make it right. As if they'd know!" she added scathingly. "I've got Molly on my back telling me that I should focus on being a mom, and I've got Ginny setting up some impossible standard for working mothers. And Ron just won't quit hounding me about my job, either. As if I didn't get enough shite from the old coots on the Council! And now I've got you against me, too!"
"Yeah, well, I turned out alright with this on my head, so he'll be fine."
"It's just so blatantly obvious."
"This is old news, Gin," Harry pointed out. He felt like a dick, but it had to be done. Now was the time. "We've been avoiding it over the Floo, but now we have to open this up. You see how fucked up that has become, right?"
"That, I'm fine with," Ron pointed out. "Harry can go mental in the kitchen, so long as I get fed his shepherd's pie. But other than that, he's pretty much the typical tragic hero archetype."
When Draco nodded, Potter abruptly stood up and fell on his knees in front of the fire in an act of desperation. The blond had to admit that the sudden closing of distance, even through the Floo, was a bit of a shock. "Tell me," Harry said calmly, though Draco sensed the demand behind the even tone of his voice.
"I'm not quite sure, Draco," Narcissa said, eyes shining with worry. "One of the elves had come across her in your private sitting room, and she wouldn't wake!"
Draco nodded absently and kissed Astoria's forehead gently before walking out. He looked back briefly to see his mother seat herself on the lounge at Astoria's feet.
"I guess criminals must go on holiday sometime," she mused. "At least you're getting to spend your time the way you want it. Maybe you should consider starting a consultancy. Something with less work and flexible hours, instead of being a full time Auror."
Several heads snapped up, interest peaking. Not a single breath was released, and a dropped pin would have echoed thunderously. The reactions just made it easier for Harry to finish what he had to say. The earlier he could leave, the better.
There was a long silence, and Harry felt no inclination to break it. Before long, Ginny finally turned her body so that her face was hidden from him.
Potter nodded, but Draco noted that it was done almost mechanically. "I know, I know," the brunet said, sighing. "I just hope everything's alright."
"That's all you picked up from everything I just read out?" Ron joked, before looking back to the records in his hands. "Anyway, we can't be sure if he was meant to be the victim-to-marry, or the victim-to-get-rid-of. Straight out, it could have been Astoria who wanted him, and hired the Eilerts to dose him. And that's just a terrible theory to think about because… well, they're happy."
The Malfoy library was littered with bits and pieces of parchment, it looked as if a gigantic Christmas cracker had exploded inside. For the last month, the house elves, fearing Draco's last outburst, had agreed not to clean up after him lest they disturb the organized chaos on the tables and all over the floor. Granted, Draco had always been a neat-freak, and cleaned up after himself. But on occasion, especially during highly-demanding projects such as this, his brainstorming was only improved by allowing his train of thought to travel from the notes he laid around himself. This way, he allowed his mind to build connections or link information that otherwise would have escaped his scrutiny. At the moment, he was the epicenter of a three-foot thick circle of paper scraps, all with some valuable information scribbled. Narcissa and the elves knew not to disturb Draco during these times, so it was to his immense irritation that someone suddenly attempted to break down the library doors with a series of frustrated knocks.
: When you try to learn about your enemies, when you try to see why and how they did what they did, or why they think that way, you understand them much more. Because of that, it becomes possible to arrange more proactive measures in security, track down accomplices, or even prevent the crimes they've already planned. The Aurors in my office learn what to expect from the dark wizard, how he uses his magic, and we get to use that information against him.
A wispy girl interrupted them then to serve their drinks, before leaving (without any recognition, of course).
When Kreacher had served them all some tea and cookies, Ron cleared his throat loudly and sat up a bit straighter.
It didn't help that the dining room had reminded Harry too much of 'that fight' in the tent, when their trio had suffered a major drawback and Ron had walked out in the middle of their Horcrux hunt.
Ron's question hung in the air while Harry bit into a sandwich and chewed. Unable to swallow fast enough, Harry resorted to nodding his head while busy with his BLT. When he finally gulped down his mouthful, he cleared his throat before standing up to join Ron on the larger conference table in the corner of their office.
“Nevermind that now! Just get to Madam Hooch, the game’s about to start!”
Harry took a deep breath, preparing himself for his nude dash down a populated corridor surrounded by his peers and teachers. Godrick, was he really willing to risk the humiliation and multiple detentions that he would imminently face just for another taste of the cock of his mortal enemy? The velvet smooth, hard as rock, girthy, lengthy, throbbing, leaking, fucking deviously delicious cock of his mortal enemy?
“Fuck you, Malfoy.” Harry grumbled.
“Have you forgotten, Potter,” Malfoy paused, barely a hair’s breadth from Harry, and reached behind him as though to grab something. Suddenly, Malfoy’s wand was once again pressing into the sensitive flesh below the raven-haired boy’s jaw. Where had he grabbed his wand from? Had it been up his -
“Malfoy,” Harry groaned, “I need you inside of me.”
He had only unbuttoned the first when Malfoy growled in frustration and muttered, “Evanesco,” vanishing all of their clothes into the nether at once.
“Well, recently, Professor Snape has been taking me out of class - because I am his most promising student, of course - and teaching me the art of massage.”
Harry expertly flipped through the sky onto Malfoy’s broom, wandlessly and wordlessly Wingardium Leviosa-ing himself into position, with his cock bobbing above the entrance of the Slytherin seeker’s mouth and his own mouth ready to resume his earlier task. He slowly lowered himself onto, and into, Malfoy, their bodies seamlessly fitting together like yin and yang, and sixty-nine. Simultaneously, the boy’s mouths wrapped around the other’s members.
“Please,” he breathed, “Do it again, please Potter.”
“You snooze, you lose, Potter!” He yelled as he scooped back up through the air following the trajectory of the flying, golden sphere.
Harry reached forward to enthusiastically rub Myrtle’s clit. “Cum for me, Myrtle.” He demanded.
Draco apparated into the abandoned classroom underneath the Divination rooms and quickly summoned some casual robes from his dormitory. He changed into them and rushed over to the mirror he kept in the cupboard in the room at all times - one could never be too careful about maintaining one’s physical appearance.
“When and where?” the Slytherin quipped.
Harry nodded. His throat had gone so dry he didn’t think he could speak if he wanted to. Malfoy looked decidedly toward the Gryffindor’s covered prick.
Harry started to explain the altercation with Malfoy when Oliver interrupted him.
All at once, Harry felt as though his meatstick had been stuck simultaneously into a pile of snow and a cloud of feathers. Myrtle’s touch was soft and shockingly cold, but one of the most pleasurable things he had felt in his entire life. He growled and moved to grasp her hair but met nothing but air, his fingers slicing right through her head.
Baking a cake with a non-domestic Potions Master and a hyperactive eight year old Metamorphmagus was not how Harry had imagined at all. For one thing, the birthday cake itself, an ambitious and fancy-looking Black Forest confection, actually looked
"I think I know what you're thinking," she said gently when he remained silent. "You've done so well over the years, and I believe you and Astoria have completely redefined what it means to be a Malfoy. There's no need for you to ever feel like you can't be a good parent, because of your own past."
"You were exposed to the hazards of fire and sharp objects and manual labor when you were only a child?!"
"He's perfect," she said proudly, and shifted a part of the cloth in her arms, revealing the very tiny, very pink, and very dark-haired baby sleeping soundly. James wriggled in Harry's arms to inspect his new little brother with curiosity. Harry felt his throat tighten with emotion at the sight of his two beautiful children.
He nodded, hiding the slight sadness he felt for Potter. He knew that the relationship wasn't as strong as the Chosen Couple had been projecting it to the public, but still... he could sympathize wizard to wizard. Even with the privacy wards, there was no predicting how big of a backlash this could cause from the fickle public, who, Draco thought scathingly, were so quick to judge their Savior.
"That's true," Ron said. "I mean, being a Weasley kind of hardwires us Weasley men about what it means to really run a family. Anyways, I always thought Mum coddled Ginny because she was hte youngest and the only girl. I think that's what led to Ginny wanting to prove herself to be much more than just a girl, you know?"
"Anyway," he continued, "we can formally go over all of this at the Ministry day after tomorrow, unless you'd like to go ahead there later today without me. Sooner is always better after all. I'm sure the team is more than capable of handling this new piece of evidence."
Harry stabbed his quill into the parchment in agitation. "Apollo, assemble a Tracking team and lead the search to Vienna. Ella can secure the necessary permits for the ministry. I'll get a hold of Lucas myself, fix the transportation." He turned over to Draco. "I'm sorry, was there anything else from Astoria?"
Harry thought back to his conversations on the Floo with Malfoy. "Hang on. One of the reasons he takes this seriously is because the letter got through his wards in the first place. So relying on just the property wards isn't foolproof."
Ron and Harry clinked their glasses together in a show of brotherly sympathy.
As he let out another groan and smacked himself on the side of the head, a cracking sound announced the arrival of a house elf.
"You really want this," she asked, but it was more of a statement. Draco nodded, a smile slowly growing on his lips.
Malfoy nodded, as if he expected that answer.
When he once again checked on Teddy and James and ensured they were alriht by themselves, he called Kreacher to keep an eye on them.
This included his usual visits with his friends, old and new, as well as dropping by to see his Aunt Andromeda and his cousin Teddy.
"Truthfully, yes," Potter confirmed Draco's suspicions. "It now feels like everything is moving in slow motion."
"Will you come, then?"
"D'you have any idea how much of his life you've already missed, Gin? Do you?" Harry demanded.
"You can take Astoria, too, if she wants to come. And maybe Scorpius?"
Brown eyes met green in a whirl of confusion, but Harry went on, his voice still calm and collected.
"So Scorpius was an accident, was he?" Draco could no longer control the rage building up inside him upon overhearing these two people talk about his son that way. Because Scorpius
"I see," Potter said calmly, smoothly. "That... makes some sense, I guess..."
The man in question had remained silent, perhaps waiting for Draco to finish what he was saying. "It's too much," was all he could come up with.
Those weird feelings he got whenever he saw Draco cuddling Scorpius. Or playing poke-the-baby with Jamie.
he thought glumly.
At her question, a head of messy black hair appeared in the doorway. There was no mistaking that head of messy black hair.
Malfoy wrinkled his nose. "I think some water and a Sobering Potion might do."
"Yes, but-" Ginny sighed again. "I have to stay with the team in China."
"Malfoy!" he cried, sure that his surprise was evident on his expression. "What are you doing here?!"
"Ginny," Harry said, his voice low and guarded. "China is on the other side of the planet! You can't come through the Floo, and you can't be allowed to Apparate or use an international Portkey as often as..." Suddenly her tone made sense. "You're not planning on coming home here, are you?" he asked stonily.
"Did Macmillan have anything new today?"
"I noticed the name, you know."
Amidst the excitement of the Muggleborn in his arms, Draco felt a hand clap his back, and he turned slightly until he could see Weasley with a smug look on his face.
how I feel."
It would be their little secret, his and Narcissa's. Perhaps he would tell Scorpius in the future, about how his father and grandmother had decided to rebel in their own little way and ensure, metaphorically speaking, that the youngest Malfoy would not be entangled with his Family's history from birth. That they wanted his name to be symbolic of a future unencumbered by useless traditions and impossible expectations. No one would know apart from Draco and Narcissa.
"Oh, Harry?"
"-I swear, Harry, I have no idea how-"
"I still cannot grasp why this is any different from the magical means we use," Narcissa said, voice like the calm before a storm.
Malfoys never backed down from a challenge, and damn it al to hell if he even thought of giving up when he was so close, so close, to finally making a name for himself.
"So... what now?" Ron asked hesitantly. Harry couldn't help but smirk at the wording, very similar to his last talk with Ginny.
"It's stupid," the redhead answered. "I can't believe it. Auror Stone is insisting we take care of this stupid paperwork, despite the obvious crisis that Harry is facing right now."
Draco remained silent once again. This was a lot to take in. Kingsley seemed to understand his sudden taciturnity, and so he smoothly changed the topic for Draco's benefit.
Narcissa merely looked pained at his words. "The only thing I can even do with the rest of my life is to ensure that I raised you well. It is not a temporary job. I am here to guide you, not control you. I love you, Draco, and I want you happy, before..."
She merely gave a small shrug. "When you grow up in the magical world with a deep understanding of old laws, you kind of have it drilled to your head that when magic tries to tell you something, you should follow it. We were engaged, and while we didn't have a pureblood betrothal contract, I guess the oldest forms of magical binding were still applicable. I'm guessing we pretty much failed that test, if the lack of cooperation between our magical cores was enough to pull down even the
"What is
Harry had looked through the memory again and again, but he still couldn't see the exact moment when he had actually agreed.
Draco leaned back. "Well, now that you're feeling at home in my exquisitely opulent couch, why don't we move the real conversation along? And don't even bother filtering. Six years of stalking you and I can still read you like an open book."
The return of Draco Malfoy to the MMI was cause for celebration, and it became a running joke among the younger Aurors how much had changed since the war for the Corps to celebrate the return of a convicted (and pardoned) ex-Death Eater. Harry and Ron had shared a few laughs, to Malfoy's chagrin, but the office picked up right where it had left off for the two weeks that the potions master was absent.
This woman never misses a trick, Draco thought. He tried to give her a smirk of his own. "Pardon me, but I've been sworn into utmost secrecy and am forbidden by oath from betraying the brotherhood."
"It is not a laughing matter. Be safe. And come home early enough so you can tell me that I was right."
"It's a bit cold," Ginny pointed out, looking towards the fireplace.
Ron's eyes widened at the joke, then smiled. "Yeah, I s'pose," he agreed, knowing what Harry meant about putting all their hopes on their ex-nemesis. "If he's really the best, and he can't do shite, then we're all screwed."
Macmillan snorted, then disappeared from the fire, presumably to sign the documents. In a minute, his head returned and he handed back the parchment to Ron. "Anything else?" he asked, eyeing Harry warily, perhaps wanting to sincerely ask after his colleague without crossing him.
As expected, Hermione was highly affronted. "How is me handling my jobs perfectly fine an example of over-involvement or attachment?! Are you telling me I can't manage my own affairs? Just because I'm a girl, Harry, doesn't mean I'm not capable of-"
She was pale, and her voice shook. "I'm not sure," she whispered. "I just... I know this is already under your investigation, but..."
Eventually, he fell asleep, not waking even when Ginny had Floo'd home, levitated him to their bed and checked on their son and Teddy. Harry dreamt of soft kisses, a body snuggling close to him, the breath of a whisper in his ear. When he woke the next morning, his breakfast was waiting for him in the kitchen under a Warming Charm, Ginny already gone.
"Ginny's missing out on her own son's life," Ron gritted out. "I know, she's my baby sister, and I do love her, but I think she's started to take this for granted."
Ella was still speaking. Apollo's spell had faded with no results. "That's it, no hits on a William Howe. If he's our guy… it's no wonder he's hard to pin down."
The mere idea put a ray of light in Draco's mood. The thought of spending a relaxing day with Harry and the kids was welcome after all the hassle he and his family were going through with the threats.
knew how much he craved the privacy that S
Draco laughed this time, prior tension melting away. "Even if I end up in one of their houses, I'll be even safer there than in the Ministry," he assured her. "Perks of being friends with the Boy Who Lived, you know. Maximum security."
Soon after I posted the last chapter, I had gotten a new job, and it is really eating up a lot of my usual free time. Prior to that job, I was basically freelancing and staying at home 6 days a week. Now I work in an office 5-6 full days a week. Let me tell you, man do I miss all that free time haha.
"I still need to know how he could be getting through the wards," Narcissa said flatly. "Excuse me."
His best friend came running back into his view, face splotched with panic and fear. She didn't even have to explain. He knew his instincts had been correct.
The little attempt at a joke made Draco relax a bit as well, since he at least got Potter to resurrect his humor.
Harry thought about the message. "'
"-and I'm getting tired of having to remind you that you mean a lot to me, and Ron and Hermione and it's nothing you'll ever have to pay for-"
Harry knew she was back to teasing him, so he took his chance to turn the tables around. "Well, I'll tell them it's no big deal."
"Blimey," Ron said, "I'm impressed that you've gotten this far in the wizarding world without knowing about the old wedding traditions."
"Probably because they assumed you already knew."
The redhead settled tentatively next to Harry, who automatically held out his arms to hold her while she in turn held onto his arms for support. They knew they both needed some form right now.
"Oh, er, yeah. Well, we pretty much woke up alarmed because Ginny was in terrible pain and... We both got scared because she's got a pretty high tolerance for pain. Possibly more than Ron, in fact-"
"A bit," Weasley replied. "Not as often as the requests now, but for some reason it's a requirement to have various redundant confirmations archived in the Ministry. The Eilert investigation was examined for a bit, and revisited in the last few months, so new verification was needed."
"Whaaa?" the brunet asked dazedly to no one in particular.
"Her family was very amenable to the contract," she told him. "Daphne was the most perfect lady for you, Draco. Whatever could have happened on your acquaintance meeting that ruined such good chances?"
He was being honest with Draco anyway. He really did like the companionship the blond provided. It was a nice balance of carefree and snooty, of sincerity and smugness.
After saying goodbye, Draco ended his call and settled into the armchair in front of the fire. Pansy was right. It had only been a week, he realized, much too little time for the gravity to really sink in.
Ron sputtered. "This is one of your businesses?" Harry shared his surprise, since he and Ron had never heard mention of it.
"That, and our second little gremlin probably helped things along too," Harry joked, poking lightly at her stomach.
Hermione was right. Again.
he had added,
The Floo flared up again, and this time, Andromeda herself came through, holding James in her arms.
"If you've not noticed," Harry said, "I've moved my entire fucking job here just to be with James. We've both made sacrifices for this, Ginny, but are you sure you're choosing the right ones to give up?!" He paused, then added in a lower voice, "Do I even mean anything to you anymore? Because in the last year, we've barely had the time to be with each other except to put the other to bed, or maybe get in a good fuck while we can. We're not even married and we've already got so many fucking issues to deal with, but you're never here long enough to work them out with me!"
"She might have mentioned what she thought of your saving-people-thing, maybe once or twice," Draco smirked, tipping the rest of his drink into his mouth in one gulp. "But I could always see that for myself."
"Italian?"
His wife suddenly turned to look at him, her eyes slightly dazed as if she weren't seeing him. "I'd like to say I'm very sorry, but it doesn't seem quite right if I don't mean it, does it?"
"Lucky bastard," the brunet huffed, but without the tone of animosity that Draco had always expected. "I officially have my weekends free, of course, but you know how it's always been with our cases. Without my special circumstances, I'd have had to be at the Ministry about an hour ago."
Harry rarely shared his presence with other people apart from Ron, Hermione, Ginny and the rest of the extended family. It was his choice. But sometimes when he was on the end of his string, he found that he couldn't escape to be on his own.
Malfoy just scoffed. "One, immediate proximity. Two, a deep emotional bond that is mutual in nature Three, a sincere intent to protect and cherish. So how do you suggest we get more than one of those?" he finally spat out.
"So I've heard," the Healer responded wryly. She never did take well to Harry's infamy, as she liked to remind him. "Well, you might still remember the drill," she indicated to Ginny, motioning for her to go on the examination table and lay down.
Ron was bewildered and looked to Harry for assistance. The latter shrugged. "I just meant, you know, like the whole... I dunno... girls-can-do-anything thing?" he finished weakly, knowing he had dug himself a grave. Ginny looked affronted.
Right now, he was mentally checking off the list of reasons why James would be upset. Then he realized it was a bit warm.
"Is everything alright?" Harry asked. James was supposed to stay until tomorrow, so there must have been a reason that she was in such a panic.
He went back to bed, the book he had been reading left forgotten. With a huge grin, he thought about Ron's messily excited scrawl.
"Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint my family by being a terrible host." Draco motioned towards where Astoria lay and indicated the baby in her arms. "Everyone, I am proud to present my first born son, Scorpius."
Hermione looked livid, and positively scandalized. "Draco!" she admonished harshly. "I'm not sure if you've got even a
And it felt good.
Draco to him? Because now that he stopped to think about it, there was definitely something much deeper than friendship when he thought about the prat.
"Have you received a message from Harry?" she asked breathlessly. When he nodded, her eyes seemed to widen. "Then you know what he must be going through right now."
Malfoy perceived the sudden change in topic, but he allowed it. "It pays well."
"I'm pregnant, Draco," she whispered. "I'm pregnant, and I only just found out."
Harry was surprised. Shocked, even. He had expected some sort of feminist outburst or argument from her, and this development was completely unexpected for him.
"And it has!" Draco insisted. "You were right all along, Mother! I was neglecting my duties as her husband, which should never have fallen behind my being a father to Scorp."
Draco rolled his eyes. "You really
"It's Sunday!" Harry gleefully shouted out, swinging around a laughing Teddy in his arms.
Draco nodded. Aunt Bella had been younger, so the Black estates had officially been in the man's name. But he still failed to make the connection, so he glanced at the Auror in confusion.
"Mr. Malfoy, I had been warned against telling you this information. I was not forbidden to do so, however, and I think in this case, it would be better for you to be informed."
"No!" Harry cried at Ron's comment. "You know I didn't mean it like that! It's just-"
Ginny heard the softness in his voice, and she got up and went to him, nuzzling the top of his head and running her fingers down his tense chest.
This time, Potter laughed, slightly more heartily now. It made Draco's heart flutter less, if he was apparently able to siphon off Potter's angry tendencies without having to try too hard. In fact, just being with Potter was getting easier and easier with each passing day. Who would have thought that having the shared experience of drinking subpar coffee in the middle of a medical crisis could bring the two most unlikely mates together?
"So, care to elaborate?" he asked Harry, who hid behind a throw pillow and groaned.
"Are you telling me that you've never mentioned this appalling - Not even to Granger? Weasley?!"
Potter hadn't responded, which infuriated Draco. Was he being serious?
"Er," Malfoy began, looking as if he were trying to find the right words. "Well, I think it's about time I get myself home as well."
"Of course, darling," Draco said, standing up to kiss his wife chastely. "Have a good weekend, then."
"Yes," Draco's green flame-head replied. "But he did grow up here, and only moved there sometime after the drama with the Greengrasses."
For someone who had gone through what he did in the last few months, Draco Malfoy didn't look the part. In fact, despite his circumstances, he had made it a point to appear even more well kempt than before. His eyes shone with an icy brilliance, and his silky hair glowed in the light of the moon. Only his pale face betrayed the nightmare he had just woken up from.
"She wouldn't."
"I am very glad that you think so, my dear," Narcissa said.
He took a quick look around his office and spotted the day's edition of the Daily Prophet on one corner of his cluttered desk. With a shaking hand, he turned it over and was shocked to see Ginny on the front cover. She looked stressed and harassed, and the animated photo looped again and again, on her walking by and hurrying away from the camera.
." So now they were finishing up their pancakes, bacon, egg and toast, with Malfoy regaling Hermione with stories of Ron's antics on their event-filled night out.
: Only to him, he means. We all knew it was coming-
He remembered how he and Ginny had had long discussions about how they would name their son. She had wanted to name him Fred, but George had claimed the name for his own future child, and everyone immediately agreed to that. Sure, the names were plain and simple, but they had both fallen in love with him when he first came into the world, and the name seemed a perfect fit.
Draco smirked. He noticed that Weasley still had his mouth wide open.
Their eyes met for the briefest of moments, and then Potter gave a little shrug as if conceding to defeat, though there was a shadow of a smile that remained in his expression. "Call me whatever you like, then. Though I really would prefer if you'd start practicing with my first name." He obviously thought something was funny, though Draco couldn't fathom what.
And with that, Draco found himself being dragged off the couch and pushed upstairs to wash up before being manhandled into the kitchen for some unexpected muggle food preparation.
"I love you, Mother, I really do, but please, GO AWAY."
Draco could feel something like pinpricks behind his eyes, which felt suspiciously like tears. He held them back with all the control he could muster. He stood up and faced Potter squarely. The brunet dropped his arm from Draco's shoulder, but his gaze remained.
Number Twelve Grimmauld Place was dark and austere, but it was where Harry found some of the peace he'd needed. On a whim, he had packed a trunk for both him and James, and announced to Kreacher that they would be staying for a few weeks. The old elf was elated to be serving Harry once again, since he hadn't particularly enjoyed staying at Hogwarts when he knew his Master was trying to manage his own home without his assistance. In just a day, Kreacher had buffed and polished every possible surface of the old Black House, and welcomed Harry and his son with a wide smile and a warm meal, both of which Harry appreciated.
"I can't stand not knowing," Ron said glumly, looking once again towards the door into the ward.
Draco bit his lip. Potter was right.
Harry nodded, agreeing. "No one can bother us here, Gin, I'll make sure of that. I'll be sure to take care of you for the rest of your life."
meant to be a surprise," Harry said. "We would've gone here earlier, actually, but for the fact that we had to drop off the kids at the Burrow first. Ginny would have come with us but she - er - decided to stay with Arthur and Molly. To help supervise."
, thought Draco).
Narcissa's brows furrowed, which Draco knew she usually avoided. "I've looked through every record in our library, and I still cannot figure out how the threats can keep breaking through the Manor's wards! It vexes me that something so straightforward cannot be explained. The person must either be allowed into the wards or be part of it. It does not make sense!"
Harry had expected Malfoy to be shocked, but the blond merely looked at him gravely, his lips a thin line.
"He… Scorpius is not my son…"
There was a dainty knock at the door, and Narcissa entered when Draco acknowledged her presence.
"Complain to me, why don't you?" Harry sighed. Hermione looked at him with just the right amount of guilt that he decided to let her off the hook.
"I mean, you know, for - for this -" Potter stammered, waving his free hand significantly in the air between the two of them.
He found his wife in their private sitting room, laid out delicately on one of the lounges, her hair draped over the edge and brushing the carpet.
Potter had said easily
"Yes," he said, nodding his assent. "I'll get right on it."
Harry couldn't help but laugh hollowly. "No, it wasn't. But we can't exactly complain at this point."
"Right away, darling!" Draco called out, already heading to the kitchen for the box of confectioneries.
Draco was at a loss for words. Perhaps he really should have owled his mother first to avoid such embarrassing situations. He had no desire to interrupt what must be another of her social calls, which he had always hated when he was much younger. Even as a man, there was something about being coddled by his mother's acquaintances that made him feel oddly inadequate.
"I was jealous," she whispered. "I had packed up and stepped into the Floo, thinking that I'd catch you and James unawares with my surprise, and what happens instead? I step out and see the three of you having a jolly good time with Malfoy of all people."
: I brought them down for this. People should know.
As he and Teddy changed James (or, more accurately, Harry changed James while Teddy knocked around some bottles and jars while looking on curiously), the sound of the Floo from the fireplace downstairs rang.
Ginny's soft lips brushed the top of his head, and he closed his eyes contentedly. They hadn't had a lot of time together this last month, since she was out most of the day and only stayed over to sleep, leaving before anyone woke. Harry had no idea how she was doing it, but it pleased him to see her so happy and dedicated to her sport. He used his hold on her hands to maneuver her to settle on his lap.
The last two months of living together was quite an experience. Despite Ginny moving in with him two years ago, she had had training every weekday, and was home only at nights and in the weekends. Now that she was on leave for a quarter (she had to reapply regularly), it was like she and Harry had had to get used to actually being each other again. Part of it, of course, was that Ginny had to relearn how to handle James. They had already gotten down the feeding, burping, changing nappies and his sleep schedule. Ginny had absorbed it all like a sponge, which Harry was grateful for. He was now getting enough sleep, and she wasn't as exhausted from training, so they were able to alternate.
He sobbed, head falling down to rest at a step of the stairs, Harry was still behind him, thrusting passionately while Draco became an indecent mess. He always had his composure, but when it came to being fucked by Harry, Draco just lost it all “
?” Draco smiled while putting concealer on Dean’s face, apparently every Auror has bags under their eyes. Hermione had managed to
Draco should have listened to Pansy, he really should have. She
“Of course, normally at parties, you two would be snogging, or drinking somewhere, or with us, but now, he’s alone, which makes him an easy prey for all those hormonal teenagers” Pansy said, as they both stared at how all those girls were laughing at something Potter had said “You are scary, Draco, I mean, in this world, with one glare, all of those girls will back off right away, no one dares come close to Harry. Since you switched with him now, any time they find the chance to approach him, they will”
“Please tell me you’re not bringing me to a strip club” Draco murmured as Pansy led him to some place with his eyes covered by a cloth. She had managed to finally drag him out of the house for three months, it wasn’t that long but she insisted that it was, she had to pull him out with force, along with the help of Blaise and Ron.
, he gave the Gryffindor a curt nod so he could explain further “Hermione’s at the library, and Ron’s with her, and Ginny and I already broke up months ago, you know about that, and, er, I just thought…I could come here” He stuttered, scratching the nape of his neck, looking down at their feet “Er, if you’re uncomfortable, it’s…it’s fine”
“That’s our son’s voice, what’s happening?” Lucius said, pushing the door open as they both walked in, Pansy chased after them and smiled, still trying to save the situation “What are you doing here?”
” Harry grimaced but soon forget about the pain when Draco started taking off his belt, he quickly work his hands down Draco’s robes but it has way too many buttons “You know, I never like Pureblood robes”
“Well, my godfather, Sirius, told me there’s another mirror that’s the opposite of this one, a mirror of desire, but they also say two things like that could never be at the same place” Harry said, looking up at the mirror “Which would explain that maybe the other mirror you see is probably the Mirror of Desire. That must have happened to my Draco, he must have seen this one, had the same reactions like you, and somehow, you two switched places”
“Shut up, Ron” Pansy smacked the redhead so loud that Draco could hear the slap “Continue, Harry”
“I like you too, that’s why I let you fucked me” Draco said, blushing slightly “And you’re undressing me with your eyes” Draco suddenly smirked at him and put his hand on Harry’s chest, pushing him back until his back hit the soft bed. The blond inched up and settled himself right on Harry’s crotch, his hands already undoing the Auror’s belt “
“I can’t see anything”
bathroom…
The water was turned on and he suspected it was Harry’s doing “
“Oh no, is it an emergency?”
“Wha-…” Draco gasped, surprised at how she knew about until he looked down at his opened shirt that was revealing his chest “When did you do this?” He nudged Harry and quickly buttoned his shirt up.
you!”
“Y-yeah, I am” He unhooked his arm and stood back to his spot “Let’s just go to the bloody class”
“Can you speak up please?”
“I did intend on doing that, but you’re late, so I decided against it” He shrugged, looking the other way with a small huff “I hate tardiness”
big?”
“Where are the others?”
Draco might seem calm outside but inside, he was screaming and kicking, he picked up the concealer and applied it on the spot under Harry’s eyes “Did you always stay up so late? Probably because of cases, right?” He laughed awkwardly and began dabbing Harry’s face with the sponge “You need to take care of it better”
Draco murmured and Harry aligned himself between the blond’s legs, poking his hard cock at Draco’s entrance. As soon as he saw Draco flinching a little, he immediately locked their lips again, distracting Draco from the pain. Everyone knew Draco was a virgin, Pansy had accidentally spilt it out during one of the parties where she got too pissed, but whether Draco was a virgin or not, he just wanted their first time to be perfect, and making sure Draco wasn’t in too much pain was his first priority.
“Yes, Harry, we
because you insisted”
Ginny jumped at him from behind, scaring Draco with her loud words, he has gotten used to calling them by their first names, since he has to actually call them like that, it’s become somewhat natural for him to say “Stop standing at the corner, have fun!”
Pansy said, exhaling tiredly and plopped back down on the seat, melting down next to her wife with a frown “I give up”
didn’t like him. Because why? Who would like Draco? And if it was
you, I can
“Let him in, Lucius” He could hear Narcissa’s voice from inside, and soon, Lucius finally gave up as he opened the door to let Harry in
“Alright” Draco replied slowly, sitting up straight to wait for Harry to speak
“I’m going too” Neville said softly and left the room. Harry was already gone earlier, he was called in by Robards again, and hasn’t come back since
“Six” He said, helping Luna put Ginny down on the couch nearby “You should keep her from drinking”
“What? Er, no” Thank Merlin Harry was so focused on Draco, he didn’t hear anything
“About what?”
” Pansy stopped and rubbed her temples before speaking “Look, first of all, you won’t die alone, look at you, you’re gorgeous and smart, if Harry dumps you, then fuck him. You’re not going to die alone in your Manor in France, because I won’t let you, you think I’ll let my best friend live in another country? Never. And we
“Well, I saw him peeling shrimps and stuff for you” Pansy smirked at him and crossed her leg over another “I do that for my
“I was thinking, we could go back to our dorm, and have a taste of the chocolates” Harry leaned closer and whispered in Draco’s ear “And maybe I can have a taste of you too”
“Hey, not that” Draco turned around when he heard Hermione scolding Pansy, taking the Firewhisky bottle from her hands. Somehow both of them have become chaperones of the party, although Draco suspected Pansy wouldn’t be doing the chaperone much. Everyone was gathering at the Great Hall, where any Professor can come in any second, so they might as well behave nicely. It’s been an hour and so far, no one has thrown up, that was a good sign. It was supposed to be a party for them after the N.E.W.T.s, the graduation ceremony would happen at the end of this month, meaning it would happen exactly on Harry’s birthday, one week from now.
“Oh shit, here he is,
“Hey, want to grab a drink?” Pansy stood up and asked him, it was the first intermission of the opera and some of them left their seats to grab drinks from the bar outside, but Potter was still sleeping…
“I think so” Hermione said “But I suspected it was earlier than that, you guys worked together a lot for Ginny and Luna’s wedding, so it
“Beautiful? Brilliant? Perfect?” Ron chuckled while organising the files he had laid out messily the previous night “We’ve heard it all, Harry, we know how
” Ginny screamed through the phone “
“You’ll feel…horrible if you don’t see them every day, you will feel like someone is ripping your heart apart if you can’t be with them, and all you want to do is love them, protect them, be next to them. When you visit a random place, eat a random food, do a random thing, and it reminds you of them, or you want them to be with you right there. When everything they do makes you…have these butterflies in your stomach, the tingling feeling inside you. When you feel like you’re on cloud nine when they call you by your first name” She smiled, tilting his chin up with her finger “When you feel the need to always make them smile. When they’re on your mind every second of the day, when they still look absolutely perfect to you even when they look like shit. And…you know you’re in love when you’re questioning it” She pulled him in a hug and let his face be buried in her soft hair “That’s how I know I’m in love with Pansy”
“No, just…you’re naked”
” The blond spun around to see Pansy rushing in her long black dress, she was holding her heels in her hands and running through the empty street, Hermione was behind her, getting out of their car and locking it before running in her tight red dress
“Okay” Ginny said after a while and walked away, the blond sighed in relief, as long as no one knew what happened to him, it’d be fine.
“Almost”
“Yeah, he actually traded Seamus so he could have June, I don’t know why though” Dean replied and looked at himself in the mirror “He originally got July, but he just switched it a few minutes ago and
“Hey” Hannah arrived at their table with two glasses of Firewhisky and placed it on the table “Pansy said she had to go home, emergency something, she also said this is for you two, her treats”
I wouldn’t be
“Oh, yeah, that’d be nice”
much” Hermione let out a chuckle and dragged her wife to their table
“Alright,
you, I had to bring my girlfriend safely back” Pansy said, stepping in with Granger and setting her down next to the fireplace, the brunette finally leaned up to give Pansy a kiss with a smile and a small “Thank you” whispered between them before she continued reading again “And also, I intended to spend the night here. What are you going to do?”
“If you say so” Ron shrugged, throwing a few sweets at Harry’s table too, one of them falling into his ink bottle “Don’t let us catch you gawking at Draco again”
“You’re right”
“Never mind” Potter grumbled and spun on his heels to walk out. Draco could ignore him, Potter already has Granger, who was a fairly good witch at healing, she would heal him, Draco didn’t need to worry.
Harry followed him out to the street and Draco finally stopped when Harry called him. He was out of breath, running was never something he was good at “Draco”
“Hey, it’s me, Draco”
“I’m the guide of your love life, I know” Pansy hugged him back tightly and chuckled “I can’t let my best friend turns into a clueless blind man”
knock me out” Harry mumbled, kissing Draco’s temple “I’d fall so hard, I mean, I’ve already fallen
—no, I’m…I’m jealous”
“And?”
“And how is he different from me?”
“No, no! No matchmaking” He shook his head and cut off Pansy’s words, he has had enough with blind dates all his friends and colleagues have set him up with, none of it worked out well “Don’t you remember the last time?”
“We’re short on one person” Seamus spoke up as some of the students gathered around in a circle on the floor. Draco stood from a few feet away and watched Harry sitting next to Ron, he should have known Gryffindors always like party games the most “Anyone else want to join?”
me to carry you in my arms?” Harry asked with a lopsided smile, Draco felt the heat rising up his cheeks as he made a small squeaking sound
“And since you didn’t go to the pub last week” Luna uttered with a soft angelic smile, with a hint of sadness in it. Harry couldn’t believe Draco would dump Brandon, so Draco was single now “And we know what you think, why did he break up with Brandon and didn’t start talking to you again?”
“You’re forgiven,
propose to you”
“Harry” Pansy murmured softly, she sounded odd “Do you happen to lose a ring box?”
“So soon?” Pansy asked, her lips forming into a pout but Hermione gave her a knowing look and she nodded quickly “
yourself? It’s a challenge to
“I think I lost it when Harry talked to the snake” He murmured
“Why are you so shy, Harry?”
They stared at each other for what felt like ages before Potter took a step forward and headed to the bed next to where Draco was standing. He noticed the blood dripping from his forehead to his scar first, Draco leaned closer, holding in his breath as if he was afraid of their close proximity right now. He grazed his hand over Potter’s hair, pushing it up to see where the blood had started, luckily it wasn’t much. He also realised Potter’s hair was softer than he had imagined, he thought it would be crispy, but no, it was a nice feeling under his hand.
“Finished the
“Yeah, I remember it” Potter smiled at him and looked back at the sky “That’s why I made the chocolate shaped like the Ravenclaw Tower for you, it’s kind of…our spot, right?”
I’m okay now” Harry said and slowly opened his eyes, his left eye was now returning to its original colour, without the red infection. Draco breathed out in relief and put a hand on his chest
“I can vouch for that” Hermione smiled, pulling Pansy close, just a bit more and Draco’ll surrender “Harry’s not that horrible, Draco. I’ve known him for so long, and you know what? Based on what Ron told me about the incident that happened yesterday…I’m sure he might want to kiss you too” Hermione mumbled, her voice was soft but her words were firm, she has magic in persuading people as well, that was how she became the Minister for Magic, and Pansy loved that about her. Draco seemed to zone out and started thinking for a while, he was looking at the ground, his pupils moving just a bit, he was calculating, probably making a list in his head right now to pick. Pansy glanced at her wife, they both have hope in their eyes, if not, Pansy’s gonna throw a tantrum if she wanted to “Plus, he wants to kiss you”
“Come on, let’s enjoy this” Pansy dragged him through the big living room and pushed him on the couch “Sit here, I’ll grab us some drinks and see my wife for a bit” Draco nodded and watched Pansy ran away quickly, the blond sighed. The room was so crowded, it was hard for him to be in places like this, people dancing, snogging, dry humping each other, Draco rolled his eyes and looked away, waiting patiently for Pansy to come back
“I scared men” Pansy smiled “So, anything improved with you and Harry?”
“Yes, mother” He said, pushing Harry away as they scrambled up to standing positions before his mother walked in. She has a few boxes in her hands that she had shrunk down “Oh, you brought boxes?”
Harry widened his eyes, making Draco chuckled, his hands came up to cup Harry’s face gently “I totally forgot. I came home to pick you up and…well, the meeting wasn’t that serious anyway”
night for him”
“You did” Brandon smirked “You hurt him
“Neville is sweet, they won’t have a problem with him” Hermione comforted Pansy, Harry looked at the long line of people waiting outside the restaurant, a part of him was looking for someone in particular, but he wasn’t here yet “Now, let’s go in first” When Harry walked in the restaurant, he was amazed, everything was simply extraordinary. White walls, the four tall columns, the massive crystal chandelier that spread across the ceiling, the oak tabletops with white chairs, big arch windows that Harry could see the people waiting in line outside, there was a big piece of art of the Forbidden Forest hanged on the wall, the art was totally opposite to the tone of the restaurant, yet it still looked incredible together, that was why Ron and Blaise decided to name the restaurant
“Woah, Draco, you’re getting really intense about this” Pansy raised her hands up and fanned her face “But I mean, you have a point. Don’t think you could juggle two things at the same time, Theo”
“Don’t worry about it” Potter smiled “Have a good day” He said and watched the sad guy walked away, Draco stared at Potter and then at the girls, they were looking at him again now
“It’s
“Hey, are you alright?” The guy with brown hair and blue eyes in front of him waved his hand and snapped his fingers at Draco, bringing him out of his thoughts. He was a nice guy, but he wasn’t Draco’s type
“You have a good point, Mr. Malfoy, I will think about it” Professor Slughorn nodded slowly, touching his chin, Draco smiled and walked away, just a few more Professors like this, he’d be on his way.
“Er, no, I…I didn’t answer it”
“Okay we had sex, it was brilliant, but, er” He paused and remembered how he felt the next morning. The empty side of the bed, the ruffled bedsheet, nothing left, he was alone “He left the next morning, or maybe right after I dozed off, I wasn’t sure, the next thing I knew, Pansy told me he moved to Paris, to be a Healer. I mean I thought we were friends before, I thought he’d tell me news like that”
“Yeah, me too” Draco agreed with Theo while Pansy glared at them
why I
“And Ronald Weasley, he’s really struggling with Potions” He said, it wasn’t a lie anyway “If you could pair a student who needs improving with someone who’s good at this, maybe all students will pass the Potions test with an O”
“I should hope so” Draco scoffed and grabbed his glass up again. Pansy looked at the big clock on the wall,
?” Pansy pointed at Harry with a sceptical look in her eyes “Hermione never mentioned how good-looking you are”
Can you see the difference?”
“Why does that matter so much to you? You like Potter or something?” She joked, but Draco sneered at the idea. He could never fall for such a sloppy guy that was way lower than his taste in people. He might be interested in men, which he found out just the beginning of Eighth Year, but he’d never go for Potter, even if they were the two last people on earth.
“What feeling?”
” Draco turned around when a finger tapped on his shoulder
“You and your words” Draco couldn’t help but getting flushed, he stood on his tiptoe and kissed Harry quickly “How come it’s been 22 years and I still get weak in the knees because of you?”
much” Harry mumbled, his finger touched Draco’s jawline lightly, trailing it down to his chin and tilted his face up, planting a soft kiss on Draco’s plum and glossy lips “I can’t imagine a life without you, ever”
” She shrieked and stepped back, putting her hands up in the air in defeat “I’ll be going now”
“Yeah, for quite a while now” Pansy leaned on the headboard and put the champagne bottle between her thighs “I noticed it and asked Hermione, she told me everything”
” He yelped when Potter wrapped his arms around Draco’s slim waist and locked him tight against his chest, he started laughing and screaming for help but it didn’t work. Potter threw him in the water and Draco gasped
“Are you joining the party tonight?”
“Draco, what are you doing here?” Potter said “Sorry, I was in the shower and didn’t hear you the first time” Draco looked down, Potter was indeed wrapping a towel around his waist again. Draco shook his head and lunged in to kiss the guy, he was surprised, Potter was surprised, he was damn sure even the portrait of Walburga was surprised, Potter didn’t move at first, but then his hands were on Draco’s waist, and he started kissing the blond back
, I’m alright, I was just followed by some creep, apparently he follows people around and jerk off behind them”
“Strawberry
” Pansy groaned, leaning back on the wall with Hermione reassuring her
“Yeah” Potter nodded “Well, back then I still thought Ron and Hermione would be together forever, but I also thought Ginny and I would be together forever too, things just didn’t work out, I guess”
“Harry said you guys met at the robes shop, right? You talked to him, and he said he looked like shit at the time” Hermione said, bringing him back to past with her words “You
Draco widened his eyes and a shiver ran up his spine when Harry said the word. It could not be coincidental, could it? The weird thing was, when Luna said the word, it didn’t make him blush, but when Harry called him like that, he felt like his cheeks were burning up. Draco stayed still in his place, watching Harry look around the circle with the others. Padma was switching her place to Seamus’s lap while her sister was with Dean. Meanwhile, Draco noticed Theodore’s small frown when Hannah Abbott took her seat on Neville’s thighs as he moved to Ernie Macmillan’s. And surprisingly, Ron was sitting on Romilda Vane’s lap, the one that gave Harry the chocolates cauldron filled with love potions that Ron took years ago, who kept calling him
“Yes,
“Do you know you’re a sap?” Draco grinned, playing with Harry’s fingers and their rings, he could never imagine hearing this words from his so-called arch rival, but not in this world apparently
” His voice broke when Harry opened the black box in his hand, showing him the two silver bands, it was simple but beautiful nonetheless. It was surprises after surprises, Draco felt his stomach fluttering and pressing his lips together to stop himself from crying, it didn’t work when tears came running down his face again.
“Oh, and Haley, there’s nothing going on between us. She was just…she got drunk and slept on my couch, and invited herself to lunch, and er, and touched my…stuff without my permission. Nothing happened between us, and I don’t have any feelings for her”
“No, what happens at midnight?” Draco asked, but soon realising what she meant, based on the way his eyes widened after a few seconds and his mouth falling open “
“You can start” Draco mumbled, squeezing his grip on Harry, it could be uncomfortable at first, Harry angled it and tried to hit the spots he had hit with his fingers earlier
“No” Draco replied, and Harry felt tight in his chest, like disappointment, or sadness “I don’t regret leaving here to be a Healer in Paris, but I
’ and Ginny’s shirt says ‘
“You don’t have to do this”
Draco leaned on the wall, watching as people came in every few seconds into the Room of Requirement. It was definitely strange being in this room again, but as long as there was no bloody mirror bringing him to an alternate universe, he should be fine. A few students from every House have already arrived, since the N.E.W.T.s was coming up, some have decided to stay, which was exactly why Draco was surprised to see the Golden Trio walking in the room.
“What are you trying to say?”
It was a long way up to the Room of Requirements, it was pure silence between the both of them on the way, just the sound of their breathing and their warm hands locked together. When the door finally showed, Draco pushed it open. As expected, the room was empty, but there was a mirror in it.
“Maybe I should prove that all the couples here end up like there too” He traced his finger over the letter, his lips forming into a small smile, it was like a plan had been made in his head, and he’d definitely do it.
“Seven minutes in heaven?”
“Thanks, Han” He replied, drinking half of his Firewhisky down quickly
“Sex like…between guys and girls? That don’t always make sen-…”
can I see…your…uh…
“And you?” He pointed to Hermione, who has a blush on her face at the moment
” He moaned when Neville started kneading his globes, the Auror was learning very quickly. Theo sat back up and moved down until he was kneeling between Neville’s legs, he bent down, his tongue licking a stripe across the Auror’s length
“Huh, interesting” He mumbled, that was something, because those two also started like that in his world. Could it be that the Weasley girl dumped Potter because she was in love with Lovegood? Draco thought, maybe he was just crazy to think that.
at Harry?
“Hi” The waitress came to their table and placed a wine glass down in front of Draco “The man over there wanted to buy you a drink” She gestured to the bulky man in suits sitting at the bar, the man winked at him and Draco gagged a bit in his mind, he hated being flirted like this.
“Are you allowed to be this sweet?” He teased back, leaning in for another kiss, he liked it, the feeling of their lips meeting each other, he felt like he’d never get enough of it “Tell me, Auror Potter, just how much do you like me?”
“Yeah, of course” Draco said, the case was about a serial killer, and they worked days and nights to solve it. At first it was hard, even when all their friends were getting along well, things were hard between Draco and Potter, banters and quarrels, they would argue with each other so much in the first month working together, but then soon they got over it, or rather they were forced to, they had to be civil or else the case would never be solved. And then throughout that six months, sometimes he stayed over at Potter’s house, and fell asleep on his couch a few times, he always found himself waking up in Potter’s guest bedroom the next day. And it almost became a cold case when suddenly they connected all the dots and found the killer. After that, Potter was assigned to Ron again, and he went back to his normal life. Sure it was hard for Draco to
“You two enjoying this?” Pansy nudged his arm and whispered
The blond couldn’t even argue with that, he had seen himself in the mirror being fucked by Harry once, he looked like he even craved for more. Harry pushed Draco’s legs up so it was pressed against his chest, he looked down and thrusted faster “
He tapped on the guy’s shoulder and he turned around
as oblivious as Ron” Pansy grumbled “We meddled with Blaise and Ron, look how
“It’s okay” She nodded, suddenly she stopped in her tracks and rubbed her chin “Speaking of it, Potter asked Granger about something weird today, he asked about the Mirror of Erised, like, what is that?”
of wine, you know?”
“I think he could tell Draco is gay, so I improvised and volunteered myself” Potter shrugged and handed Draco his bottle of sunscreen
moment when his heart skipped a beat that he realised he wanted to get married to Draco and keep waking up next to him like this for as long as they can live. However, today has not been nice to him, Harry put the box back in his pocket and closed his eyes, he just has to wait for Draco.
, but I‘m not sure about anything” He walked to the door and sighed “I don’t know what to do”
did it,
“It’s alright, now, should I let you pose half naked?” He let out a weak chuckle and quickly added when Colin’s face turned white “Oh don’t worry, I won’t, I’m just kidding. Oh, you poor child” He chuckled and gripped on Colin’s shoulders tightly “I’ll put you…alright, this white poet shirt, and your Auror trousers, would you like that?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Blaise replied without looking up, his eyes were glued on the parchment as he kept scribbling. Draco might never admit it out loud, but Blaise was definitely a smart one, he got an O in a lot of classes, and he was actually the one to help Pansy saving her grades, which was exactly why he wanted to find Blaise.
“I, er, I don’t know, I just…Ron told me, and I guess, I guess I wanted to ask you”
his side of the bed
you’d forget to do so I get to bring him here?” Pansy turned to look at him and winked, earning a gasp from Ron “
“Oh, well, I feel closer to Draco using his, you know, since we’re pretty close now” He said, that was clearly a horrible lie, but he tried his best “What are you two doing here?”
“You’re drunk” Hermione laughed, leaning on Pansy, Draco smiled at them, his thumb playing with the head of Harry’s cock, making Harry jerked a bit, he smeared the licking precome all over the crown and wished he could lick it all off right now.
“Relax, Goldstein, it’s baby ducks, they are not going to eat you” He heard Blaise’s voice, advising Goldstein what to do
“I mean, er” He glanced at their friends, all of them were ogling at him, forcing him to spit the truth out…but he would never “I think you should go on this date”
“Well then, should we prove that it’s not?” Harry gave him a smile with a hint of smug in it, Draco pursed his lips and nodded “Alright, what food do you hate most?”
!” Hermione gasped and smacked Pansy’s arm playfully while blushing, Draco chuckled and grabbed another champagne glass when the waiter came, he enjoyed his birthday party a lot. He had talked to his coworkers, his parents and his in-laws, he even stayed with his kids for a while but Harry’s parents took them, saying they wanted Draco to celebrate his birthday instead of taking care of his kids and told him to have fun, which he gladly obeyed. Draco was happy, he thought the start of his 40s would be depressing, he even expected himself to have some kind of mid life crisis, but he felt alright.
Pansy yelled, breaking the two of them apart “There’s a
“I-…” Potter stood up and looked at the table full of Aurors looking at him “I was just telling Ron that, er, that you look incredibly beautiful today with that new robes on and it looks good on you, and Ron said, you said…” Potter looked at Weasley and the redhead muttered softly
“Oh yeah, he practically ran when you asked him to apply the cream under your waistband”
“Oh, just…wondering”
“You better be, your mother expects you to” Pansy said, shocking the couple “Don’t give me that look, she’s very observant, she knows about you two already, possibly even before today. She told me she’d be glad to see you introducing Harry tomorrow”
“That’s a long line of people” She said, making him smile
“I know, I know” Harry said, opening the door to his and Ron’s office, settling down on his chair “It’s so hard, Draco’s just so…”
. Pure
“You’re always here, right?” Potter asked, leaving Draco speechless before walking out of the hospital wing. That was…something. Draco sighed, turning around and noticing the red and yellow scarf left on the bed. Potter must have forgotten to put it back on. Draco touched the warm fabric and picked it up, it still felt like it has Potter’s warmth on. And suddenly, it didn’t feel like the coldest night anymore, the blond shook his head and quickly erased the thought. He must be going crazy.
” Harry grumbled, he knew what Ron was doing, and he really wanted his friend to stop
!” Hermione’s panicked scream filled the room as the flames burst out again
“Still haven’t found the courage to tell him how you feel even after 7 years?”
“I don’t know” Pansy said “I’m not a Legilimen, you are”
“I…well, we’re friends, right?”
kind of disappointed at the same time
“Sorry, it was just too boring” Potter stood up, stretching himself and yawned the second time “How long was I asleep?”
“Did you…did you just say their first names?
“We deserve free desserts” Draco shrugged softly, digging his spoon into the soufflé. Harry looked at the way Draco ate and remembered the first time it happened. It was one of their weekly dinner as friends, they have been friends, for years now, it was no longer strange for the world to see them together anymore, but no, they were
” Ron hummed, pushing back on Blaise’s fingers “
“Would you
“It’s nothing, we are just in the same situation” He shrugged, he had come to Draco yesterday to tell him how he felt back then, how he also had a fight with Blaise, and how he gathered up his courage to tell his parents, and that their opinions won’t matter even if they want to forbid it. Draco had surprisingly accepted it, he guessed time really changed them. Eight years ago, they graduated Hogwarts thinking they’d never meet anyone from school again, but now they were closer than ever, than he could ever imagined. He was friends with the people he didn’t think he’d ever talk to, he got married to a man that he used to think was a stone cold, heartless person, who turned out to be a man that treasured him the most. Life was good to him “I’m just glad they made up, do you know how annoying it is to see Harry moping around?”
Well, not
“I love you, and you are the one I love the most, I can’t think of anyone but you” Harry slowly retracted his hands and Draco hugged himself instead, fighting the cold now without his boyfriends’ hands, the sudden lost felt extreme. He heard the rustling sound in front of him, like Harry stepping on the snow under them “And you’re special to me, that’s why I want you to meet them” He said, pausing for a second “Open your eyes, Draco”
“No, he’s not, I am” Draco said, wondering why he even wanted to be Potter’s arch rival. But it has always been like that, even now after the war had ended, they were still fighting and arguing every day whenever they see each other “I have to know what’s on his mind”
“Really?”
“I have to go” He grabbed his bag, he could leave his book, he didn’t need to care. Draco rushed out of the library only to realised Harry was running after him
“How do you know? We hate each other there, right?” He asked, and it was true, since they hated each other, Draco has never been able to see a soft side of Potter before “If you have feelings for me, then I’m sure the other me has feelings for you too” Harry told him, with his green eyes never left Draco’s gaze “Because you once told me, you’ve always loved me like I’ve always loved you, there won’t be a universe or a time where we wouldn’t be together, it’s simply impossible, because we’re meant to be”
“Juice is fine, tea makes it hard for me to sleep” Draco answered, watching Harry walking around half naked in grey sweatpants, the blond was definitely struck my this man’s body.
“Hey, Granger invited us to Longbottom’s birthday party tonight” Pansy suddenly said, putting down her Witch Weekly and kicked Blaise’s leg, who wouldn’t put his book down. They were still waiting for the graduation ceremony, which happened only two days from now, and that also meant it was two days left until Harry’s birthday. He didn’t get him any present, since he was in no position to give Harry one anyway, they weren’t arch rivals anymore but they weren’t exactly friends either, it would definitely put them both in an awkward spot if Draco gave him a gift.
“Let’s go, alright?” Draco told her, intertwining his hand with Harry’s and kissing Lily’s hair. They’ve had her three years ago, she was the light of their life and Draco could never forget the first time they held her in their arms, it was one of the most special moments in his life.
“I think I love you too” He said, and Draco stopped doing everything he was doing before, he forgot he said it before Harry came. The blond smiled and tilted his head to the side to kiss Harry’s cheek
“It’s not a date” Draco leaned back on the wall of the courtyard while Pansy smirked at him, he hated how smug she looked right now “I told you we’re just friends”
They both turned to look at the Hogwarts yard, where Luna was standing, waving at the redhead. Ginny gave Draco one last curious look before walking away. He knew Ginny would be stubborn, she has every right not to trust him, but he was hoping maybe Luna’d be able to help him. Draco clutched tightly on his books and walked away as well, he needed to find a few more people.
“Shut up”
“Marking my territory” He looked Harry with an innocent look on his face
“Of course,
“I just came back to get the eye drop, can’t lose it. My girlfriend gave it to me” She said, picking the eye drop bottle from the bench “Anyway, a date”
“Do you want him to fuck only you?”
“I’m old, no one celebrates their 40
, I love you too” Draco said, turning his head to the side, meeting Harry’s lips midway, his body was sweating, the pub was hot, and he was still wearing his long jacket and that only made it hotter for him, then sex with Harry just added the fuel to the fire inside him, in a good way “I have never felt so good, Harry, you are so good to me”
“Er” Robards’s Adam’s apple bopped up and down, the Head Auror finally grabbed Pansy’s hand and pushed it down gently “I don’t, Miss Parkinson, you’re perfectly capable of blowing this place up. And…” The Head Auror looked back at the table full of Aurors and raised his hand, that’s when Draco prayed silently in his mind,
“Do you think people will fix the lift soon?” Theo asked, his hands touching the small stubble around Neville’s jawline
boyfriend, I, of course, said yes, I was so glad, I literately wooed him into coming in my shop for years”
“Good, he’d be thrilled”
these outfit” Potter chuckled and Draco started running again, he couldn’t let Potter catch him. But Merlin knows Potter was the fastest in running during the Auror training program, so he did his best, running for his life, trying to keep his outfit dry
“Oh, I guess” Hermione said hesitantly “I’ll tell the others”
“Well listen here,
“Oh, yeah, I met with her this morning”
surprised us”
“Okay, first, I ask because it’s merely curiosity, and I’m not worried about him, I’m worried because I’m a Healer…I’m supposed to worry about everyone. And I don’t dress up because he’s there, I dress up for everything”
“I just think that, well, since I’ve been single for a while now, I’d like to get back on the field”
“Oh?” Draco said. Could it be another present? There was already a table full of gifts in the ballroom already, he wondered what Harry’d show him. Draco followed as his husband took his hand and led him to the staircase, they went up and Harry opened the door to another room. It was dark, Draco couldn’t see anything so he just let Harry guide him.
“It’s just really, really red” Draco said, panicking “Oh I’m so sorry”
got your attention?” Theo snickered “I was kidding, I came home alone yesterday, but, I listened to you, and I kinda flirted with Roger a bit earlier”
The shower ended way quicker than he realised, Harry wrapped the towel around his waist and walked back downstairs, he still needed to eat something at least. He saw Draco from behind when he reached the kitchen, the blond was sitting on the couch, looking at something Harry didn’t notice, the television wasn’t even on. Harry furrowed his eyebrows and decided not to open the fridge but instead approaching Draco to see what he was doing.
What are you two talking about?” Pansy rested her hand on Draco’s arm gently “Brooms?”
“I’m just dabbing this
“Even though everyone says I’m brave because I’m the saviour and all that, I never found the bravery to confess to you, I didn’t want to lose what we have, I suck at feelings”
“Wow, it
“Oh, right, Potter’s birthday is today, Granger invited everyone over again, I don’t really care about Potter, but if there’s a party, I’m in” Pansy beamed, nudging him but he didn’t react at all “Are you going? It’s going to be a few hours from now”
asked him with his eyebrow arched, Draco rolled his eyes and glanced at the table Harry was sitting at. He was all smiling, talking with his dates while Draco couldn’t even look at anyone without comparing them to Harry. They could not…they simply couldn’t, Harry was the best thing he’s ever asked for, and Draco lost him. Draco looked back at the guy in front of him and felt like hexing this guy, who kept winking at him.
“What’s that sound?” Lucius asked them, but Pansy chuckled and held him back while waving Ron to go
“And…he
Draco stepped back and looked down at himself, he still has his shirt and trousers on, thank Merlin
“They could celebrate with us” Pansy huffed annoyingly and sighed “It’s just that, with work and all, we all got our stuff, I just want all of us to get together”
“I know” Harry mumbled, standing up and wiping the dust off his jeans “But see,
” Draco demanded and Harry didn’t dare disobey, he pushed the third digit in and curled them, earning a loud moan from Draco, he could feel how aroused the blond got just from his grip on Harry’s hair
sad, by the way” Pansy sat on the other side next to him, her hands removing the bowl of popcorn out of his lap “We saw him”
“Please don’t ever say
“I am” He replied “I’m fine, Harry brought me back”
“Did you enjoy the meal?” Ron approached the bar with a bright smile, he placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders and gripped it tightly “Any comment?”
“Hi, you two” He smiled, leaning close to hug both of them before looking down “You brought your kid to a pub?”
“So put the robes on and go somewhere else” He said, turning around to fiddle with the clothes on his rack, putting it back in the right order. He has a habit of organising things when he was nervous, and now he was doing it again.
“Thank you”
“What happened to my collection of The Daily Prophet since I was seven?” He arched his eyebrow at her and watched her grinned “You borrowed it before First Year and I never saw it again”
“Here” Blaise mumbled quietly, trailing kisses down Ron’s neck
“My mother says you only do this kind of stuff to someone you love” Draco said softly “Mother used to do it for me when I was a kid”
“You’re just daft” Ginny chuckled while leaning on Luna from behind. For those two girls, it began way smoother than Ron and Blaise. After listening to Harry’s advice, Ginny confessed her feelings at graduation, and they’ve been together ever since, Ginny became a professional Quidditch player, and she’d stay home to watch her and Luna’s kids while Luna was out being the famous Magizoologist “So, do you guys like it?”
you’re my best mate, so I can keep it”
Pansy and Harry’s words came rushing back in his mind, making him wonder again “If I could prove that this world is just like that world, then maybe it’ll work” He mumbled to himself, looking at his own handwriting ‘
“Maybe it’s good for you, Ron” Hermione said, he knew she’d agree with that suggestion, she was fed up with teaching Ron anyway
“I knew” She winked at him and took a sip of her drink “So, why are you here at this event?”
“Just burn it”
“Be patient, Potter” He smirked when Harry pouted and pointed to the door in his bedroom, that was probably the bathroom, Draco kissed the Auror’s cheek before sashaying away. When he got in the bathroom and closed the door, Draco breathed out, he wasn’t always composed like that, he needed a moment to calm himself first, even he couldn’t believe he was in Harry’s house right now, about to sleep with the man. Draco took off his jeans and black boxer, getting in the tub and turned the water on, feeling the cold water from his head to his toe, he almost forgot he was already half hard, just the thought of Harry pining him to the wall had him harder, let alone imagining how Harry would fuck him. The blond leaned back on the wall and closed his eyes, he was about to do something crazy. Draco turned off the water and walked out of the bathtub to open the door quietly, looking at Harry, who was lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling, Draco bit his lips at the sight
“We’ve chosen a theme for you” Hermione said and pulled out from her bag a small box “You’ll be posing with animals. In this box there are a variety of animals that I have written down, and you will randomly pick one to take the photoshoot with. Understood?”
“Why are you saying ‘
“I’d like to see you try” Harry chuckled, leaning down to kiss Draco on his forehead “You look like a cute bunny when you try to fight me”
, 2002” Draco said, Harry furrowed his eyebrows but he couldn’t remember anything “It was Hermione and Pansy’s wedding, we were all a bit tipsy after the party, I…I asked you whether I should keep being friends with the oblivious person I like or should I confess, and you told me to just confess already and then passed out on the table”
“What?”
Harry said, and Draco abruptly let go, Draco stood up back on his feet and winked at Harry
“Are you and uncle Draco not talking now?” She said, climbing up and sat next to Harry, leaning on Harry’s arm “Do you hate uncle Draco now?”
“We suspected this day would come, sooner or later” Narcissa said with a knowing smile, it was like she saw it coming already “Lucius and I both agree that we will do anything as long as it makes Draco happy”
” Draco called out, and Potter turned around to look at him under his glasses. He stepped forward and pointed at the bed “Sit down, I can heal you”
“He’s using you, I did it to tell you, to warn you” Harry tried explaining but no one seemed to believe him, Pansy and Hermione were ogling at him, Draco’s eyes were filled with shock, Brandon was standing behind Draco, his lips quirked up into a small smirk, and Harry was the only one to see it.
Potter said quietly to his friend “Draco was kissing me because there was a guy that kept clinging to me, so he saved me by saying he’s my boyfriend, and we kissed to prove it”
“You really believe that?”
“Nah, I’m not interested if my girlfriend isn’t going” She looked at Granger, sliding her hand in the brunette’s curly hair with a soft smile. She did look like she was truly in love “Plus, the Hufflepuff girls party the hardest,
y-yeah, I can see you” Harry said after staring at Draco for a while
” Ginny greeted them in her light blue sweater, her arms opened wide as she took the gifts from Draco’s arms, she tipped her head over and mumbled “Did you get it?”
” Haley’s hand was on his arm, gripping it tightly “He knows just what to do, everyone is impressed” As something flashed through Harry’s eyes, he glanced down on her hand and widened his eyes
knocked him out”
He grunted, grabbing at Pansy’s arm “I cannot do this today, Pansy”
“Yeah, I hate the cold but I like snow, it’s beautiful, fragile” He said, letting the snow fall on his open palms as Potter kept his focus on him. He shivered slightly, the cold would be too much to handle soon.
“May 18
“Oh, er, so, will you go to my party tomorrow night?”
mischievous cow, they were a match made in heaven indeed
Draco yelled at Ginny’s suggestion, leaving the phone there and ran to the kitchen to search for things, anything to put out the fire and stopped the smoke detector from screaming,
Draco mumbled when Harry enveloped the blond’s length quickly, slurping and bobbing his head up and down, his hand traced from Draco’s inner thigh to his perineum, casting a wordless spell to lube Draco up before inserting a finger slowly inside the blond. The deeper he pushed in, the louder Draco got, he pulled away and knelt down on his knees, he pushed Draco’s legs up high and leaned in, pulling his finger out and sliding his tongue in smoothly
“It has to” Hermione whispered, smiling discreetly at her “We’ve got our plan B right?”
“Oh well,
“You…you don’t know him? Voldemort?
rough one, he could not imagine Potter liking him back, ever.
“Smile for the camera, Draco” The blond turned around to see Blaise with a camera, standing next to Weasley “
“It’s alright, it’ll still taste good right?”
“You tell me, are you up for a match?” He said, sipping on his drink, noticing that Ron was still staring at him, like he was trying to figure out what he was up to
“Jealous? I’m just mad that she cancelled something that the Headmistress told us to, just to date someone”
“You fractured your shoulder blade” Draco stood up and gazed at Potter, this time he has to, he couldn’t tell a patient bad news without looking into their eyes. The blond swallowed and looked down, murmuring the words out loud “I’m sorry too” He said, and he meant it, for all the things he had done. There was no better time than this, especially when Potter had just apologised to him too. When he looked back, Potter still has his eyes on him “What did you do?”
“Alright” Ron said and grimaced a bit when the dragon was put on his shoulder, the small dragon breathed out a small blue flame and Ron started to panic
I’m blowing this place up”
“Hey” Colin came to his spot and Theo gave him a weak smile “Oh, what’s with your hand?”
” Draco looked down, avoiding Harry’s eyes. He had no memory of it, he didn’t even notice Harry before “Where did we first meet?
“Hi” Potter approached the guy and extended his hand, the guy stared at him for a while before shaking his hand, then Potter put on a bright smile and added “I’m his husband”
the sweats when he ran home. Fortunately, he didn’t wear any mascara today or else he would have looked even more terrible. It was definitely the
“We had to bring him” Luna said after putting all the bags behind the bar “He wouldn’t stay at the Burrow with Molly and Arthur because little Hugh wasn’t there”
“It’s…uh, I—…”
“Sorry, Harry” Neville said before shoving a brown paper bag down on Harry’s head, blocking his sight, Dean and Seamus tying his hands together behind his back while Blaise was doing the same with his legs
Harry got in the bathroom with Draco, closing the door as he spoke
“You keep saying that, the next thing you know, you’ll be forty sitting at home in your pyjamas with fifteen Kneazles and moping around all day”
“You’re cold” Potter pointed out but Draco shook his head, still too indulged in the pretty snow around him. Potter exhaled quietly before unwrapping his scarf, putting it around Draco’s neck, and he was pulling off his hat to put over the blond’s head as well.
way anyone could come here this instant, we need to find the best” Hermione said, flopping down on the couch again and turning to Pansy “Hey, you’ve been quiet”
, you are the representation of love, I feel every incredible thing when I’m with you, if there’s a word higher than love, I feel that way about you too, you know, I just love you
, we are taking a bubble bath, honey” he said as Harry quickly pushed the bubbles into their spots so she wouldn’t be able to see anything inappropriate
mean you can go and break your own bones just so you can come here, do you understand?”
wouldn’t even be the exact word to describe it, he actually ripped it apart and he could hear buttons hitting the wooden floor. The sound of the belt clacking when he undid the blond’s trousers and let it fell on the ground, Draco stepped out of it and kicked the trousers to the other side of the living room, gluing their figures together again.
? Alright?”
“Potter” He clasped his hands together and begged the Auror “This outfit is tailored”
Harry put down the computer and cupped Draco’s face, stopping him from babbling out more names, as soon as their eyes locked, Harry smiled at him. And just like that, Harry found the will to confess, he wasn’t sure where the courage came from, it just suddenly was there “You forgot one”
“Theo…”
“I just, I don’t know, I hate it when you do that”
“He’s always at the Greenhouse”
“Like…like a date?”
“You taste like strawberry ice cream. Did you eat it just now?”
He said, running out of there as quick as possible. Why did he insult him again? Moreover, why did he call him Harry? He ruined it all, Draco could not make it worse.
“Oh, okay” He nodded, turning his head to look at Harry. He raised his finger up, telling Harry to wait for him for a minute. Harry nodded and he turned back at Ernie, who still has that shy look on his face “What’s wrong?”
steady couple that never fight nor get bored of each other, they were the dream couple of their group.
“Understandable, since you locked him in the loo”
“I insist, it’s safer, and your friends would take some time to come here, I don’t want you to wait, it’s already midnight”
He finally let it out, collapsing on the ground softly, but Neville still held him in his arms, sitting down on the floor with him
since the first time they met him. Pansy has never liked him since the day Draco told her about him, Ginny said he hated their cats and
“I’m a designer, fashion designer” Draco said, looking around the room, he could sense that Harry was a modest person, based on his furniture “Do you live alone?”
“Yeah” Shortly after his answer, Draco found himself being wrapped by Potter’s strong arms again. His face rubbing against Draco’s back, the blond sighed, placing his hand on top of Potter’s “I’m sorry for snapping at you, I was…you know, I’m not the Draco you know”
Ron only got more tense, it was his and Blaise’s best friends, standing outside arguing “You-you just, grind yourself against that McLaggen jerk and-and you just—…”
“I know” Potter said after a moment, he let out a quiet breath and continued “It’s okay, you can tell me about it whenever you’re ready”
…” Pansy squeaked “Harry…is big though”
joined too!”
did it. And you made the chocolates yourself, that makes it
“The way she’s been gawking at Harry all night while we talked to him?” Hermione scoffed, stating that she clearly saw it “Can it be any more obvious?”
“He’s French, he’s…he’s nice”
“No, I’m sorry” Her laughter died down and she looked at him with a smile “I’m a lesbian”
“No, no! Harry! You must let me say something first! I mean, this is
“Oh” Draco said, something ached a bit inside him, it must be the breakfast he had “Friends, right, friends. Just friends”
Ginny. I don’t care who Hermione meets at the Ministry, I don’t want to go on blind dates again”
“That’s absurd, Pansy, that won’t be me”
“What does it look like?” Potter shrugged “I’m peeling shrimps for you, eat”
“Harry’s really just
“The threat” Pansy said “Hermione didn’t get any threat, it was just a plan to get you two to come with me and Hermione on our trip, because none of you made a move and we are all frustrated and all of us supported this idea and we all went for it, and honestly Robards wasn’t in it but I was actually glad he chose you two, Ron claimed he would but I wasn’t sure but then he
Pansy greeted him and leaned over to smack his arm “What are you doing here?”
“Yes” Harry couldn’t help it but giving Draco the biggest grin before spinning the blond around and pinned him on the bed
“I can vouch for that” Pansy whispered
, this is tailored” He pushed her hands off and sat back down on the chair “He actually complimented me today, said my robes looked good on me, brought out my eyes, and that I look
“I’ll bring you up” He spoke, and Potter spun around to stare at him with bright eyes, he beamed and waited for Draco to go up the stairs. It was quiet the way up, but he didn’t know what else to say.
Everything was upside down in this world, everyone was happy, they were in love, it was like a world where they all got what they desired. And that could also mean that the version of Draco here was also brought into
“Let’s go” Harry beamed, Apparating them both away right in the pub. One second after he was somewhere familiar
” He moaned while stroking on his own length, with only a few strokes his toes was curling, his body spasmed and he was shooting all over the wall. He felt absolutely drained, Draco clenched his entrance and Harry slammed in quicker, coming and filling Draco up, his voice emitting low growls as his body jerked behind the blond.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know” She bent down and whispered, covering Draco’s figures with her body while Hermione led Harry to his table, just a few tables away from Draco “Ron invited him and didn’t tell us, Ron also doesn’t remember you’d be here too”
“Please say the names I’ve given you out loud to find your partners” Luna said and everyone started speaking up at the same time
, Hermione and Pansy’s 5 years old daughter, she has black hair like Pansy but it’s long and curly like Hermione’s.
Seamus yelled “
“Now I think this is crazy” Blaise said while setting up his camera
I like you, a lot”
“Yes, you can, you’re stronger than you think” She pushed his hand away and tapped his shoulder “I’m sorry, but it’s something you two have to resolve on your own, it’s not impossible, Draco. You’re just too stubborn”
He said, opening the door and running out of the room as soon as possible. He ran, he ran like someone was after him, he didn’t stop until he reached the Slytherin Dungeon.
“Yeah” Harry heaved a deep sigh and looked at Draco “I’m sorry, it’s your birthday and I—…”
“Robards found out the location of this group of dark wizards and we need to bust them right there and then” Harry explained, his hand rubbing a small spot on his left arm
your bed?” Harry wiggled his eyebrows with a grin, making Draco laughed like a kid
’ in French
“Excuse me?”
“What?”
“I’m not sure”
here, but then he saw you, and left” Draco said, patting Neville’s shoulder softly and walked past him. He went into the middle of the dance floor, flooded with people and just started dancing, his hips swaying to the music, he wasn’t the
, I-I want to” Draco said and Potter slowly leaned down, he caught the blond in a soft and chaste kiss, Potter sucked on his bottom lip slowly, slithering his tongue inside when Draco gave him access, he arched into it and stood on his tiptoes, wanting to taste more
“No, no, I’m fine, I was just followed” Draco replied and looked back at the street before looking at Penelope again “What is going on?”
“Do we have to stay out here while we know what they’re doing in there?” Ron groaned, mumbling into his wine glass as Pansy glared at him and pinched his arm “
“You’re fucking me in a stall?
Draco rubbed his hands together, even with the warming charm, he still felt the cold around him, it wasn’t called the coldest day of the month for nothing. Draco’s thoughts were interrupted when he saw a shadow of someone coming in the hospital wing, he straightened his back and stood up on his feet, only to feel anxious when he realised who it was.
“I want to look nice” He pouted and sat down, joining them for breakfast and chatting. Draco’s mind was elsewhere, he couldn’t focus on their conversation at all.
“You’re reminiscing your first date with Blaise, aren’t you?” Pansy grinned when Ron blushed, she could read minds, he liked to think that because she always seem to know what others are thinking “And for Neville and Theo, I think they’re celebrating early today
“You have never said the word
“You think I’m going to believe that Harry Potter is dating you, Malfoy?” The guy smirked, Draco could already sense what he was going to say next as he balled his hands into fists “A
“No, just…looking forward to this” Draco said, tilting his head to the side and looking down at Harry “What are you thinking about?”
I also just had the fifth meeting with her for the past weeks and she’s
Harry snickered loudly when they got back to the party
He said and Harry started dipping a strawberry in the melted chocolate, he raised it and placed it on Draco’s chest. He swirled it all over his stomach, gliding over his hard buds, it was like he was trying to be a painter. Lastly, he placed two strawberries on each of Draco’s nipples, the blond chuckled out loud looking down at his chest
hate Potter?
“Can you bring Theo up to his dorm for me?” Draco said, rubbing his back “He, well, his boyfriend broke up with him, he’s all heartbroken and pissed, I want to bring him up myself but I’ve got Pansy too, she’s chugging up all kind of cocktails here” Draco said, tilting his head so Neville could look at her, who was already tipsy “You can just throw him on any bed in the dorm, don’t worry”
” Pansy cursed loudly and Draco realised the phone was on the couch and the girls couldn’t see anything “
just happen
“Well, maybe not too much” Pansy winked at him and started eating. The grip on Draco’s hand started loosening up as Potter beamed at him and let go so they both could eat. It wasn’t that bad…holding hands with him, Draco thought to himself, it was a crazy thing to even think about, but it was an unexpected realisation he had just now, and it was slightly nice.
“I know how you feel about Draco” Brandon turned off the tap and pulled out a handkerchief from his inside pocket to dry his hands
“Some charity event, I’m not really sure anymore” Ron shrugged, flopping down on the spot next to Harry and opening Harry’s computer that he had borrowed a few days ago “I just think of it as one more spot I get to do it with my husband”
“Do what? Seduce men? Now if you’re so disgusted with me doing that, then you should have just gone home, if—…” Draco stopped when he heard a small noise from one of the stalls in the restroom “Did you hear that?”
Draco muttered under his breath “
“Deep feelings that though I have tried to get rid of, hide it in me for years, but I just couldn’t, maybe it’s because I don’t truly want to get rid of it” He added, his hands left Draco’s face and rested back on the bed “If you’re going to leave again, I think I have to say that, er, I will miss you. I have missed you a lot, since you left, I mean, we were on great terms before that, and when we fucked, I, er, I was actually going to ask you out the next day. I didn’t know you were going to leave for Paris. And er, after you left, I did try to find you, but I saw you with another guy, so, I thought, I thought you already found someone else”
“Are you daft, Lucius?” Narcissa walked to the dining room while Lucius followed her “Our son has been talking about him nonstop, even when he’s a Healer, he’d tell us how he sees Potter every day. Didn’t you see it coming? Plus, there are four glasses on the counter, clothes on the floor, and our son’s wand along with Potter’s on the couch”
“Who?”
Harry
I won’t” The blond grunted, this guy has no sign of giving up and Draco has no idea what to do “Why are you so-…”
” Draco chuckled quietly and leaned in to kiss Harry, the Auror closed his eyes and sunk into the kiss. It felt like an absolute dream to finally kiss Draco, the softness of his lips, the taste of the champagne on Draco’s tongue, the small sounds the blond made every time Harry kissed him harder, it made Harry all fired up
“Stop” Harry said and stepped forward “I’m, er…I don’t like hearing that”
“Well, it was
“It won’t, trust me” Theo reassured him “Not because I have done it a lot, because I prepared already, and you
“Alright” He nodded and held the parchment tightly in his hand. He looked at Harry, who was standing in front of him. Draco stepped forward, he took Harry’s hand in his, smiling at him brightly and swinging their arms, walking forward like a couple
, they were definitely all taken aback “We have never seen you accepting anyone’s offer before”
Draco stopped in his tracks when he heard a familiar female voice behind him, it was the day after he apologised to Luna. Blaise was still tutoring Ron in the library, while Pansy complained about sorting books out with Hermione every day, Draco got his alone time to think a lot these days. He turned around and saw Ginny rushing to him in her Quidditch’s uniform
He waved at both of them and ran away while Ginny still has an annoyed look on her face
” Ginny pointed at Ron, whose hair was being ruffled by Blaise gently, she stuck her tongue out at her brother and leaned back on Luna lazily “
“Ah, so you’re worried Granger teaches him better?” Pansy snickered, kicking Blaise’s leg as he huffed annoyingly “Come on, tell us”
“Thank you” He said “Did you know everyone knows about your feelings for me?”
“You go tiger” Pansy gave him a lopsided smile and smacked his back before pushing him up to give a speech. Harry took a deep breath before speaking up
“I’m not sure he’ll agree, it’s like twenty years ago” Pansy said, sighing loudly before pulling out her Muggle phone out of her glittery purse “I’ll just try, I’m just not sure he’ll do it again, with his reputation now”
“Potter, I can feel your sweats. If you want, I can start walking now”
“So, ready for the cake tasting?” Draco looked up at Harry with a smile
“Rose, why don’t you go play with uncle Blaise? He can make you a quick dessert. Chocolate?” Ron whispered to the little girl and she nodded eagerly, squirming until Harry let her down on the ground and she ran as fast as she could to Blaise’s spot.
People were already standing in front of the one they wanted to kiss now, Seamus waving his wand to create a magical clock counting down to New Year. Hermione turned around and raised her hand, calling Harry to their spot, the Auror quickly strolled to their place and stood between the girls and Draco. Pansy cleared her throat and intertwined her hand with Hermione’s
Padma exclaimed when Seamus began acting like he was on a broom “
“Er, I was bitten” Potter said, sitting down on the bed near him and rolling up his sleeves, showing Draco his forearm “I think it might be infectious”
“Ready?” Blaise asked and Harry nodded, raising his arms a bit, the white snake was there, slithering around his left arm to across his shoulder and around his other arm. Draco watched as Harry posed with the snake, it wasn’t bad like Ron trying to pose with a naughty dragon or Smith posing with a wolf that kept sniffing his crotch. Harry…Harry was different, it was like…he has control over the snake
you should
who is this guy? Some…some lowlife, common guy? There are many fishes in the sea, Draco, maybe one fish is even swimming near you, you just don’t see it because the fish is being a scaredy-cat” Ron cut in and Harry couldn’t even believe his best mate just called him a scaredy-cat, Ron was waving his hands, seeking more words to say and nudging his husband’s arm as well “I mean, maybe you should cancel it”
He whispered and soon Goldstein was tugging on his robes
“Next, we will be attending a small chocolate candy making class for couples” The tour guide said to the whole group
“You know what to do, right?” Blaise smirked at him
a lot the previous night, Harry and Draco have woke up to find their friends sitting casually in the living room, Pansy was the one to break the silence first
“That’s—…”
like you, I have been, for a while now. And I made this, for you, and I know you probably don’t care, you have a bunch of gifts from others anyway. But, go big or go home right? I chose to go big. Anyway, that’s it, if you don’t want it, just give it back to me, I wouldn’t want it to go to waste, and er, if you’re uncomfortable with me liking you, with me being a Death Eater and all, just tell me, and I will ask Headmistress to assign me to another dorm” He said and fidgeted with his robes, his heart threatened to fly out of his chest. He closed his eyes and waited, but the only thing he heard was…
“Are you teasing me?” Harry mumbled at him, his eyes could burn Draco’s soul. The blond bit his lips and licked a stripe up Harry’s jawline
“What?”
“Did you just say you love me?”
“What if I tell you that I assign you the only task that I
“Are you going to announce it to the whole building?” Harry whispered “Stop yelling” He released his hand and stepped back “I tried, okay? It was just a plan, I didn’t tell anyone because I thought it was stupid. Well, Ron knows, because he saw me practiced proposing to Draco in my bathroom”
“So who is it?” Draco retreated his hand, his face fell and he looked like a hurt puppy “It’s bloody Goldstein, isn’t it? I noticed how you always mentioned his name in your Auror stories. Or is it Macmillan? I
“I punched a mirror”
“A pet name” She clarified “When they open their eyes, they’ll find their partner with the same name. And then the game starts, one person will perform an activity or mimic a person, and the other has to guest in one minute. The couple with the highest point will win. And I will be the judge”
“Shut up” Draco said “I didn’t do it because it was already humiliating for me, to think you’d ever like me back”
“Guys, what’s going on?” Draco asked, but Rose grabbed his hand and pulled him to the middle of the room, Pansy walked to her table and ignored Draco’s questions. The blond kept looking around, trying to find an answer, he was just as shocked as Harry was when he walked in here “Is this some kind of pranks?”
“Sorry, I had to say that so they can continue their date, they have been working all week, I don’t want to ruin their time together” Draco explained, he didn’t want to bother them, but he wasn’t sure he could stay alone in his house right now either. He still felt that scary, unsafe feeling in his chest, afraid that someone was behind him, he couldn’t forget it.
“I fucking love you” Blaise said while chuckling, his hand at the nape of Ron’s neck, pushing him close
office this morning, and I need it
“Do you, Draco M—Malfoy, do you…” Pansy choked up on her tears, who’d have thought she’d cry harder than Draco on his wedding day “Do you,
“Oh, and maybe do something with the bags under their eyes, they have a lot” Pansy mumbled “And also remember to put lotion on them”
“Last my arse” He folded his arms across his chest and frowned “I just really, really, really want to talk to him”
” Harry snickered while speaking “I spent the last two days preparing for this, I want to know what happened that night, it was hard because Ginny, Ron and Pansy were drunk, Theo and Neville looking at each other but none of them knew it, Blaise taking care of Ron, Hermione and Luna’s memories were the only useful sources I could use” He snorted “I even asked Hermione to cut her hair again. I want…I want it to be
“Say you’re not old” Harry told him, pushing his tongue in a bit but pulling out right away
“I forgive you” He looked up at her, astonished at her words, she was smiling at him, the same kind smile he had seen from the other world. She held his hand tightly and continued “It’s all in the past now, don’t worry”
” Pansy reached out to catch his arm but Theo flinched away
“Okay, I’m sorry, I lost it, alright?” Pansy rubbed her face on his shoulder and smacked his arm “But to be fair, there was nothing much, just a bunch of articles about Potter”
Draco yelped when Harry picked him up in one swift movement, his hands and legs immediately locked around the Auror’s body. He latched on Draco’s nipple and lapped at them, sensing Draco pushing back at him as he got them both in the kitchen where he placed Draco down on the long dining table. The blond supported himself on the wooden table but Harry still wouldn’t let him go. He bit teasingly on one of Draco’s nipple, fondling with the other as the blond let out a sudden moan. Harry trailed his tongue down Draco’s stomach, watching the blond let his head fell back, enjoying the sensation the lower Harry went “
someone else also wants to ask you out” Ron said slowly, carefully looking at Harry and tilting his head “Maybe that
“Oh-…oh yeah, it hurts a lot too” Ron managed to form the answer after a second, seemed like the redhead couldn’t think straight when he was next to Blaise “But it’s alright”
“You’re also old
“Of course I did great, what do you think?” He let her leaned her weight on him as they walked through the crowded hall “How about you? Did Millicent help?”
“Well, what will we do today first?” Potter asked.
This was it, Draco was so scared, he felt tears forming around the rim of his eyes, the man behind could be a creep, a thief, a rapist, or a killer, none of those sounded good. Draco feared for his life, he’s young, he has so many things to accomplish, he didn’t want to be in this situation. It has been another five minutes, he wondered why this man hasn’t made a move yet, but it was better than the man attacking him now. Draco rustled through his bag, trying to find at least
“Okay, remember, this is all of our effort put into one big gift for you two” Pansy said, leading Draco’s hand to keep walking. It was him and Harry’s anniversary, 22 years to be exact, their friends have surprised them by waking them up in the morning, covering their eyes and bringing them here “This took a lot of time”
“I think it’s romantic” Hermione added “My wife can’t handle sappiness even though she is sappy herself”
“Er, normal as always” Harry replied plainly, playing with the rim of his glass. During dinner, he got the seat opposite to Draco and Brandon, so he had to witness all their actions, which he wasn’t annoyed with, he just didn’t want to see it “Nothing much” Now they were sitting at the bar in the restaurant, and he has been trying to stop himself from drinking too much
“Hi” Harry greeted Pansy as soon as she opened the door, Hermione had called him for a emergency and asked him to babysit Rose, Harry had gladly accepted it, besides staying at home, babysitting Rose actually sounded better than anything he had done this week “I bought her a present”
Harry said, shaking his head “Sorry, I should think of more words to say. So, tell me about him”
Draco started laughing when Harry carried him up in his arms, spinning him around like a princess “
“No, you’re not” Harry said as they walked in the corridor “You’re still beautiful and sexy to me”
“See you at home” He said and hanged up the phone, he put it back in his bag and stilled himself a bit when he felt something, or rather,
“Now you’re just making this easy” Draco chuckled, biting his lip and sat back on Harry’s stomach, propping himself up on his knees and pulling his skirt up slowly “I forgot to ask, do you like this outfit?”
birthday, they have gone out on a date the next day, and the day after that and decided to move in together at the Grimmauld Place after five months being in a relationship. Four months later, Harry had decided to propose to Draco in the middle of their big fight, which stunned Draco for a few seconds before he burst into tears with a loud
Harry breathed out heavily and rested his hands on his knees, crouching down after running. Draco was breathing fast as well, he hasn’t run in ages.
“So soon?”
“What?”
“Stopping him is only going to backfire” She cupped his face and sighed “We have to be happy for him. We are, right?”
Draco said in frustration, he absolutely did not have feelings for Potter “Stop talking about Potter. Now, Pansy, listen, back to our previous topic, please tell Hermione to stop with the matchmaking,
“Hey” Potter called and Draco looked up, the Auror was opening the door halfway and was looking at the blond “Do you…will you want to, er, join our New Year party? I’m hosting it at my house tomorrow night, just close friends and families, well, close friends and the Weasley. And I was wondering if…if you’d like to come, you don’t have to though, I just think, if you want to, you’re welcome to come”
is how I thought of the idea” Pansy shrieked and sipped on her wine, she played with the rim of the glass and clicked her tongue “Shame how it got interrupted, stupid criminals”
makes him like Draco? Did
“Alright” Draco said and walked to the door after Hermione and Pansy have left “Sure you don’t want me to bring you home?”
“What about plan C?”
” He moaned with relief, it felt extraordinary, Potter’s hands were magical, that’s what Draco concluded from this trip, that’s it
daft”
“You’re blocking my view” He said, closing his eyes once again
, they still ended up being a couple right? Just a little bump on the road, still come out fine”
"I fucking hate this!" Both Ron and Hermione stopped their argument at Harry's sudden outburst, which may or may not have caused several of the lights to flicker. The brunet just scoffed. "Only I have the luck of having the most powerful fucking privacy ward, and having it fail in the most inconvenient way, and humongously public at that."
"Forgive me, my son," the woman said softly. "It's just that... seeing how you are with Scorpius... I had been afraid that he would live through the same rigid standards of your... father's family. But watching how you are with him, the way that your face just lights up at the sight of him, that is what brings tears of joy to my eyes."
literally, I'm afraid," he said with a smirk. "How does it feel, Mr. Malfoy, to be looking up at your superior?"
There, he said it. It had been gnawing in the back of his mind, but he had belatedly realized that Ginny had been happier when she was away at training, coming home to Harry with all sorts of stories and gossip about the Quidditch league. He hadn't really had to put words to the thoughts though, not until now that Ginny had brought up her manager's wishes again after so many months.
"Opportunities for sexual intercourse," the Healer supplied bluntly.
"Yes, I do," Potter said, then shrugged. "But I don't like the idea of having a sort of slave or servant, so I have Kreacher take care only of what I can't manage on my own. It works out pretty fine."
Inside was a simple white card, matching the plain parchment envelope. Draco took it and turned as pale as a ghost.
"Ah, just a little special brew that's been used with no fail for centuries… Worked like a charm, too, pun intended."
Harry got over his initial shock and moved closer to the fire. "Er...Are you alright?"
Harry noticed that Malfoy seemed to have a lot on his mind, though he felt like he knew why. "Did your mother want to be more hand-on with your, what was your term, child rearing?"
"What about James though?" Harry couldn't help but ask. "She's in Montreal now. She'll be back in a month, then she'll have to go to some other country again. I wasn't against it at first, Mione, but... is that the best she can do for Jamie?"
"That's all it said? No other telltale marks or hidden traces of anything?"
"Well after another quick owl exchange - and mate, let me just tell you how awful it is to have to write a seriously loaded message in the plainest terms - he told me that we could meet up at same place as before."
The Healer, patient as ever, finally chuckled. "Why don't you see for yourself?"
"Kind of?"
Harry shook his head and took her face gently in his hands. "This is a big deal, Ginny. I want it to be clear to you that I am not blaming you for anything. I don't think our problems are truly our fault. It's... a complicated mess... but I don't blame you. It's very important for me to tell you that."
"I suppose so..." Hermione considered, before jogging off to find the blond.
Did Harry want such a big affair? He had never thought it a possibility that he would become a father so soon, so it wasn't like he had much time to think about how he wanted to handle it. Yes, he wanted privacy. But he had also imagined his small, intimate family spending most days together, snuggled up in front of the fire and roasting marshmallows or drinking hot chocolate or what-have-you. Somehow, he never pictured spending his days with his son, working from home, and exchanging stories with his pseudo-wife over the Floo. He had privacy in mind, but not in the lonely way that his life had panned out to be so far.
Draco chuckled. "You know me so well," he admitted somewhat sheepishly. "Thanks, though."
"No," she replied, shaking her head almost imperceptibly. "Come to my personal suite."
"At least pretend to pay attention, Harry," Hermione hissed into his left ear.
In the ensuing muster of the Auror team, no one could tell that the calm and efficient exterior masked a whole other level of chaos within. Harry was a mix of fury and focus, his mind intent on doing nothing but finding Draco and punishing whoever took him.
Harry gaped at that. Of course it was highly involved! A woman physically had a foreign body growing inside of her for nine months! When Molly saw his expression, she shook her head.
"Hey, little man," Harry said, ruffling the boy's hair (currently a dark brown). "Didja miss me?"
tasted pretty good.
"What..."
"Of course, I doubted you, you git," Harry said, somewhat cheekily. "I think it goes against our very nature not to keep competing with each other."
When his mother reacted once again, he knew that it was indeed baby James that had him unbelievable happy, and that his face was reflecting it accurately. And knowing so made him smile at the thought, which obviously startled Narcissa even more.
"Well, then, how would you explain this entire affair?" Draco taunted. "I'm sure there was much preparation on your part. So much effort in the last few weeks. Months, even! My own family wouldn't go through so much trouble just to get my attention."
The baby insistently grabbed at his hand, pulling him closer, but he didn't mind.
Or at least Draco had said so earlier when their conversation turned once again to their biggest problem.
Potter looked at him with the same lazy smile on his face. "I'm the happiest I've ever been," he whispered. "I'm just trying to remind myself that it's all real."
"Fuck no!" he swore uncharacteristically. "Even my mother had to step in when all the other Healers were complaining about my ceaseless pacing and hovering. Not to mention all the choice adjectives I kept throwing at the staff," he reminisced thoughtfully. "I think I even succeeded at making one of the witches cry..."
Draco ground his teeth. "I wouldn't have, then," he said slowly, carefully. "But now, I'd like to thank you directly. And now, I really would like to know what it was you saw, and why you thought it wise to even side with me."
Narcissa sighed. "I meant that you have become too anxious, too...insecure about yourself."
"I am to please," said Malfoy, which made Harry laugh even more.
Astoria laughed, her voice tinkling like a bell at the theatrics of the Chosen One. "My dear Mister Potter, how gallant of you to grace our family with your presence," she answered with a bit of a smirk.
"Let's start with this: who ever said my name was Howe?" he asked.
"Malfoy," Ron said, "we need your help to figure out what the ingredients are, and what they could possibly be made into."
"Of course not," Draco answered. "The child's name will be given on the day of birth, as my mother sees fit."
Harry shook his head. "Hermione already tried to file for an exception to the Statute of Secrecy, something about revealing magical information to on a need-to-know basis if there's a familial relationship, so Andy can finally tell Ted's siblings what happened. But a committee told Mione that they still have to debate the merits of sharing such information since Ted had already passed away. They see no reason for his muggle relatives to be informed at all since there's technically no more familial link between Andy and the Tonks except for Teddy. And the muggles aren't interested in gaining custody of him. It's a whole mess, but at least the decision will be out soon."
Hermione nodded. "In the muggle world, researchers would sometimes tag animals, meaning they implant some sort of tracking or identification device. It's supposedly done in good will, for academic and ecological purposes, but then no one ever mentions how it could affect the animals for the rest of their lives. It's even worse in the case of mind mapping, because the top officials will have access to the mind maps of the Auror Corps. It's bordering close to invasion of privacy for them to have that much intel on your individual minds."
The admission, concise as it was, meant so much more to Harry, who knew that Draco would not have uttered such a statement of weakness if it weren't just the two of them.
: What about your other siblings?
"Everyone seems to be making my life a matter of public opinion-"
"Since it is dependent on your magical core, the interaction of the wards are obviously dependent on the interaction of the individual's core with yours."
Draco slapped him on the arm this time. "I thought you were supposed to treat your house guest with the utmost respect and deference."
Draco visibly took in a deep breath, which seemed to calm him. "Viable, yes. Mother did her research thoroughly, and she's been instructed in the Black family history since her childhood days. This particular one was the best option to provide complete protection against ill intent. It's not archaic or obsolete, just very limited to the Black line. The steps for the ritual are laid out very precisely to avoid any margin of error. The only reason it hasn't worked is if Scorpius' magic is blocked somehow. I can't - I have to protect him. The Fidelius isn't enough!"
: I'm sorry, what was that word again? Sigh-?
most certainly gives me enough incentive to never do this again," Draco retorted with a signature smirk.
There was Ginny, helping a laughing Malfoy and a frazzled Hermione in putting down their overexcited babies into the enlarged crib along with Albus. Hugo and James were being secured by Ron in the play pen in the center of the room, while Teddy harassed all of the grownups one by one with his boisterous giggles. The mood was infectious and in no time at all, the adults had settled into their routine of catching up while Kreacher busied himself in the kitchen.
"About the rather... unorthodox way you have been raising your son, or at least that is how she puts it." Narcissa's nostrils flared, which Draco took to mean that she was not in agreement. "She says you now spend more time with the child that going to the last couple of balls that she has organized. Once or twice, she has suggested that you have become slightly over-attached."
"Kingsley. Right." Harry shook his head. He had specifically told Kingsley NOT to tell Malfoy of his role in his freedom apart from being a witness at the trials. Oh well. "I told him-"
She raised her eyebrow. "And what's that supposed to mean?"
"Oh." With a wave, Ginny reset the Charm on the snow globe they kept in the room for that purpose. Immediately, their surroundings became noticeably cooler, and it only took a couple of minutes for Harry to calm James down. Harry settled himself, James still in tow, on the couch by the fire. Ginny slumped in after him, looking glum.
Perhaps the extended exposure to Draco Malfoy was just too drastic a change to their occasionally spotty Floo exchanges. But he wasn't complaining.
"So, Harry," inquired Mr. Weasley, "how does it feel?"
the dosage - but the victims were supposed to be put under the influence so they would fall for someone else." He flipped through several more sheets. "Yeah, that's right. The murder victims were only meant to be taken out of the picture, so the Eilerts' clients could pursue their actual targets - the people they planned to seduce and marry."
Weasley nodded. "It says here that rigorous magical testing has proven the cards to have been produced, processed, and sold exclusively in France. The parchment used has no Muggle derivatives to compromise the magical tests, and it's evident that the first card had never left French soil, which does narrow down our leads."
"What is it, Potter?" Malfoy asked, with concern in his voice. "Is it really something that you can't tell me?" Harry knew that this was his Malfoy pride. He wasn't being nosy, or unnecessarily intrusive. He was obviously aware of something, and goodness knows how long ago he began to have such suspicions. But he hadn't tried to give a rise out of Harry, had he? He didn't try to force it out of him, or blackmail him, or sneak around. He was just, honest-to-goodness, pissed off that he was being kept out of something.
The woody area behind the Burrow was a perfect place to play a Seeker's Game. After an hour of flying high and low, and showing off to each other with dives and feints, Harry and Ginny had finally landed in a grassy clearing and laid out their shrunken picnic. Ginny clutched the Snitch possessively, proud of having won it from Harry. As if reading her mind, Harry pouted.
"You're telling me Malfoy might be under the influence of the potion?" Ron asked in disbelief. "After all this time, he might be one of those victims we've been trying to help! What the fuck, mate! What are we supposed to do? Do you think he's already had enough to overdose?!"
Hermione opened her mouth, no doubt to give him a piece of her mind now that Harry was done, but she was interrupted by Ron's voice calling out to them from his study. "Sorry, you guys, I've got to make a couple more calls for Stone, I'll join you in a bit."
Ron smiled sheepishly. "Well, now that you think about it, I guess I panicked. But yeah, she did say she wasn't ready yet. I shouldn't have bolted- oh Harry sorry mate, I shouldn't have-"
"What of your responsibilities as a husband to Astoria? You still have to cater to her needs and whims."
...But the magical tests… and the wards… and the Black family magic failing… it couldn't
"Does this name seem familiar to you?" Ron asked, breaking Harry's reverie. The brunet looked at the ingredient his deputy was indicating with the tip of a quill.
"No, it was all real," Harry said, his tone slightly darker. "But yeah, we found a load of crazy stuff in the Department of Mysteries, so you must be in real deep to be working with them."
"'M not
He didn't say anything else for a while and Harry prompted him, wanting Ron to be able to confront it himself. "...and?"
"What is?"
"Indeed, Mr. Malfoy," the deep voice said assuringly. "Understand that your mother will continue under her probation to full term. Your case is quite different, you see. You have proven to be quite the 'good boy' over the last ten months, it seemed a shame if your efforts had gone unnoticed. Two more months of probation seem to be redundant given the service you have already rendered while under your sentence."
Harry stumbled back to bed and fell into his still-warm sheets. His drowsiness had returned, and he let himself drift off lazily. "Goodnight to you, too, Draco," he whispered to no one in particular, having already fallen asleep.
Harry brushed off Ron's sudden mood drop, trying to lighten it again. "I was surprised, but he owled me back the same day with a pretty straightforward agreement to help us in the case. Can't tell you enough how relieved I am," he added for good measure. "If he can't help us figure out that stupid potion, I might get desperate enough to bring Snape back to life."
"What if it was meant to end this way, though?" Harry suddenly suggested. "What if, we were meant to have a failed relationship in order to help both of us grow more on our own? Maybe we needed that to happen?"
"Careful, you'll squeeze him," Ginny said amusedly, which brought Harry's thoughts back down. He pulled away slowly, not even daring to breathe.
"Harry, Ginny, it's great to see you again!" Healer Rosewood greeted warmly. She had been hired as Harry's (and by extension, Ginny's) personal Healer, under the strictest of privacy wards but also within good terms of friendship. She had delivered James, Hugo and Rose, after all, which merited her much respect from Harry and the entire Weasley family.
"I-I used to get nightmares, have I told you that?"
"I was wrong, Draco, it is as simple as that."
Despite having had a rough few weeks, Harry had had no problem arranging her stay at Grimmauld Place, though she still admitted that she missed their old flat. Things were still a bit awkward between them, if Harry were being completely honest, but nothing that wholly derailed their friendship - that was one thing that they were both sure would last a lifetime. In the current circumstances, they had no choice anyway but to fully support each other as they entered yet another challenge.
“Close…?” Ron asked, trailing off so Harry could explain.
“Sit. There are things I want to discuss first.”
“H-Harry!” He said as tears streamed down his hot, red cheeks and he came across his own stomach.
“We have to get you cleaned up, darling. Don’t want to make more of a mess than we already have.”
“Exactly!”
Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
“That so?” Harry asks in disbelief, “go on then, I’m intrigued.”
Felix Felicis was fairly easy to make, so it shouldn’t take them too long. At least Harry hoped it wouldn’t. Neither himself nor Draco said a word as they mixed the ingredients together. Harry scooted closer as he watched Draco measure the eggshell, accidentally leaning too far and placing his hand on Draco’s thigh to steady himself.
“You have far too many articles of clothing on. Stand and strip for me. You don’t have to take your time, I’m too much interested in what’s underneath to have to wait.”
“You’re back.”
Ron gave Draco an odd look as he stopped him just outside the Gryffindor common room.
Harry turned to him, taking a mental picture of him tied up, covered in cum, and leaking cum. He then waved his hand and the green silk keeping Draco bound evaporated. He watched as Draco rubbed his wrists, soothing the red marks on them.
Draco let out a surprised gasp into Harry’s mouth as he hovered over the blonde boy. Harry pulled back slightly, running a hand through Draco’s hair and gripping it lightly, tugging his head back and leaning down to trail kisses down his neck.
Harry gave him a questioning look, to which Draco just smirked and stood. He untied his robe, taking it off and laying it neatly in the corner of the room.
Harry nodded as Ron took the word right out of his mouth.
“You still point out the obvious,” Harry retorts bitterly, “did you come here to watch me drink tea?”
Harry's face flushed as he knew what Draco wanted, "I want you,"
Harry came then, weakly pushing down to meet Ron, silently answering his question.
Ron thought for a moment before he whispered his question, “did that make him hot?” He asked, not sure how to phrase it.
He lifted his head, releasing Malfoy’s hands which fell to his sides. He pets one of his own hands through Draco’s hair, the other landing on his waist. Draco immediately leaned into the touch, grinding down almost unnoticeably onto Harry’s thigh.
“Before you go,” Harry quipped, a loud sound in the silent room, “I’d propose another game… Tomorrow?”
Before he could beg some more, Harry used the hand that was already in his hair to push Draco’s head into the pillows, affectively shutting him up as he picked up his pace. He could vaguely hear Draco’s muffled whimpers mixing with the harsh slapping of skin-on-skin.
Draco took that as motivation to keep going, picking up the other boy's legs and throwing them over his shoulders, effectively going deeper and making Harry mewl and moan.
“Now, now,” Draco said, scooting back into Ron’s arms in case Harry decided to choke him this time, “to be fair, that was supposed to go with the robe this morning.”
Draco could sense Harry's shyness, and he brushed it off by pulling the latter into him. He planted a soft kiss on Harry's plush lips, relishing in the way Harry gave into him, immediately opening his mouth and letting Draco slip his tongue inside.
Maybe not.
They gave her a reassuring look as they left, Draco being ahead of Harry for a short time. Once he rounded the corner Draco’s arm was tugged on, his body being pushed against the wall. His blue eyes fell on Potter’s green ones.
“Hey,” Harry piped up from the other side of Draco, “that’s not true!”
Ron gave him a suspicious look, to which he received a smug smirk and a wink. He sighed, watching as Draco slipped past the portrait into the Gryffindor rooms.
"You wish."
Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t have to for Draco to know, because right after he finished his sentence Harry was coming, hard.
Draco forced himself to open his eyes as Harry relentlessly kept his pace. He pulled out subtly, making Draco whine loudly at the loss.
That was no problem to Draco and he insisted that he’d take care of it. His way of taking care of it was waiting until the three of them were alone before climbing into Ron’s lap and kissing the breath out of him, doing nothing more than smirking and pulling Harry in for a kiss as well when he rushed over, asking what he was doing.
“Good morning darling,” Draco said sweetly as if Harry wasn’t clearly conveying that he could choke him at any moment, “sleep well this morning?”
“Sir, huh?” Harry asked, pulling on the bud now and reveling in the whimper that left Draco’s lips, “you must really want to touch me. You only call me sir when you give up all your deficiency.”
After he had taken his wand he followed the Slytherin to the front of the room where there was a space big enough for them to play this game.
“I’m not sure you can handle it, love,” Harry teased, grabbing a packet of lube from under one of the pillows and tearing it open with his teeth.
He looked up at Draco who already looked somewhat debauched.
When he returned, Harry was already asleep, Ron rubbing lazy patterns into his back. He handed the rag to Ron who gently turned Harry over, cleaning him up. Once done, he handed it back to Draco who threw it in the bin.
“I said,” Harry said, now directly into Draco’s ear, “what if I don’t?”
“Either… Both,” He decided.
The begging didn’t seem to be of any use, and Draco wasn’t the only one who seemed to notice. As he swatted Draco’s bum once, twice more, he noticed a slight tent in his boxers. He said nothing as he listened to Draco count, “eight, nine.”
Draco couldn’t form words as he was being filled and enveloped at the same time. He had never done anything like this and it felt amazing. He would never admit it but Harry was right, he didn’t think there was a chance for words at the moment.
Draco whimpered at that. Harry moved quickly, removing Draco’s clothes in the blink of an eye. In another his own clothes were off.
Harry heard it. It was a quick sound and he thought he could’ve imagined it. But, as he went to say something, Malfoy turned away, adjusting his towel and moving out of sight.
“Okay,” Ron agreed after a moment, “how are we going to do this?”
A nod of agreement.
He felt Harry tense up when he pulled them off of him. He could imagine that Harry didn’t think he was serious until this moment. He rubbed his thighs soothingly until Harry relaxed under his touch. He let Draco reach into his bedside drawer to grab the potion that served as lube in the wizarding world. (What? It wasn’t exactly his first time sneaking into the Gryffindor rooms.)
He pulled away slightly, only to look at Ron, “he doesn’t need more than two, he likes it a little rough.”
Before he knew he was clenching his fists his quill had snapped, earning a glare from the professor. He should have cared that he was on incredibly thin ice with getting kicked out right then and there, but as he watched the way Draco looked back and smirked at him with that proud smirk, he couldn’t be bothered.
“Well, if it’s that interesting to you, get him riled up.”
He stroked a soothing hand over Draco’s shoulder and asked him politely to turn around so he could see him. Draco got up on shaky legs and turned quite ungracefully, plopping back down into Harry’s lap.
