His stomach grumbles with emptiness. He isn’t fond of breakfast, of mornings in general, and today started way too early with the unexpected floo call at an ungodly hour. His head aches, likely the lack of sleep and food, but there is no time to sit down for something so mundane.
The neckband fits like a second skin. It’s the same midnight blue collar with little diamonds. When he’s done, he lifts Draco up and steps back to take it all in once more.
The plans for the next Picnic start about twelve seconds after the last pie is consumed. The children bustle around while the adults slowly drift off into food coma, when somebody - usually Molly - will bring up an idea what to change next time. It can be anything: place, time, activities, food.
Harry settles beside him, talking softly as he wipes away more dirt. It’s mostly nonsense, a way to distract himself from the many injuries that mar Malfoy’s body. His jumper is in tatters and only held together by wishful thinking. The knees of his black jeans are ripped, the skin beneath bloody and burned. Malfoy tries to avoid moving his right leg and whimpers when Harry tries to get a better look. One finger is missing a fingernail, and three fingers of his right hand are certainly broken, standing out at an odd angle.
The chicken is simmering in the pan next to the onions he slowly heats. It should be all ready in about fifteen and he hopes to Merlin Harry will be in time when he gets everything on the table. The caramelised onions only taste good if they’re fresh out of the pan. If they sit too long they lose their hearty taste.
Draco whimpers when the cold metal encases his balls on both sides, and he certainly feels the pressure around them as Harry fastens the bolts, but he has yet to experience the humbler fully. When everything is tightly in place, Harry lets go of both humbler and balls, and watches Draco’s reaction.
They’re still young, barely fifty, which means they didn’t even finish a third of their lives yet. In fact their parents were that one crazy generation that got kids as soon as they finished school. Back then everything was so unsafe and people clung to each other, finding comfort from the terrors of the first war.
The door opens without a hitch and swings open to reveal a dark hall. While the bedroom is dirty, it’s not overwhelmingly so. It’s more like a well lived-in room with an owner who is a bit lazy. The hallway is, in contrast, the epitome of dirt. Cobwebs are everywhere - there is a huge one that nearly covers the whole passage from wall to wall (Ron would have a heart attack), and the carpet is grey from all the dust. His steps are muffled and barely noticeable. Enormous patches of paint are missing from the walls, and where he can see wallpaper, further along, it’s peeling and moulding.
Last time it had been Draco, nearly breaking down under the pressure of eighteen hour work shifts, after the Prophet had released a series of articles describing how teenage wizards and witches liked to spend their time in foreign countries. All of them included some sort of getting high on certain potions ingredients and either flying brooms, playing tag by Apparating through the country or mock dueling. The following three weeks were filled with broken bones, splinched limbs and the tragic deaths of three witches that believed their Levitation Charms were enough to jump from the London Eye and get down like a feather. Not only was St. Mungo's full of injured teenagers (never mind the mass of irresponsible adults), but the Obliviators had to work overtime.
Wet noises drown out the singing on the stage, not that Harry would have paid any attention, but there’s something so wicked about receiving a blowjob while being in a fancy setting like an Opera House, it’s the actual reason he shoots his load without warning and almost unwillingly.
Harry finally remembers some of his education, transforming the bloody handkerchief into a disfigured cup. It looks hideous, but the crest survives, and it doesn't leak, so he counts it as a win. It takes forever to coax Malfoy to drink from it, but the water seems to help revive him a bit. When his grey eyes fixate on Harry, there’s recognition there.
It went all well until one day Harry asked him, why he didn’t write his stories down. They were fantastic and he was sure Draco would be able to pull of an amazing story, since writing wasn’t that hard. But he couldn’t. It didn’t feel right to express his silly ideas, make them real on paper. It was nice of Harry to indulge him, to support this childish pipe dream. As soon as the suggestion was out there, Draco found all the reasons why it was a bad thing to try and write about his fantasies.
He slowly sinks down on the settee, the pressure falling from him as the music washes away the nastiness that is St. Mungo’s.
Once they had an amazing Picnic in the middle of the night, while the Leonids showered them with wishes. Harry rarely experienced such a beautiful night. The downside, however, was soon clear. Every parent complained about hyperactive kids. Since they were awake at night, their sleeping schedules were completely off and according to Fleur and Hermione it took the better of two weeks to get back to normal.
Just as he steps outside, he feels a miniscule twinge in the back of his mind. It barely lasts a second and as he sits down, waiting for Harry to join him, it’s already forgotten.
Also, while I have read much and fantasized much, I have never been to a BDSM meeting or something similar. If there is anything clearly wrong with my description of Harry and Calliope and their "neglect" of Draco, please let me know. It does sound like something that can happen, depending on your relationship and your friends, but I can't be sure.
To their credit, they aren’t always like that. They had days when everything went fine, when conversation was easy, the food good and Harry felt just the same around them like he did with his other friends. But the situation is always fragile and a wrong word can set Pansy off on one of her rants that end with the accusation that Harry set the hat on fire in an act of revenge, because Pansy tried to give him to Voldemort. Which is ridiculous because if Harry wanted revenge, he wouldn’t destroy a perfectly good hat. And why had she worn the hat in the first place?
It’s settled, then, no reason to delay the inevitable. The walk through the Forbidden Forest seems both to last forever and be the shortest walk Harry ever had. They don’t talk, don’t need to, because Harry feels their well-wishes in his very core. He’s brimming with their love, so full that all the bad thoughts leave his mind. When they breach the premise of Voldemort’s camp, he doesn’t feel the dementors. He slips through them, easy like breathing.
For now, they’re making out like teenagers, kissing and biting at each other, small pecks and entangled tongues. People are milling around, talking, and laughing, but Harry only registers the soft lips that willingly part for him, for soft moans and whimpers, a hand in his hair.
Like Harry would be gay and actually marry such scum like Malfoy. It’s crazy to think anybody could willingly marry this snake. Rage sweeps through him, and he does conjure the knife just as planned to cut off the offending appendage.
They sip their drinks in silence, but it’s not uncomfortable. Harry thinks it’s a great trait in any relationship when two can enjoy silence between them. Talking is overrated. His Galleon vibrates in his jeans pocket and he fishes for it, putting it on the table.
“So, what do you want to do this evening? I don’t have to be in before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.”
It might not be Harry's own bed, but he isn't worried. It happens from time to time that he stumbles into a different bed - once memorably he fell asleep next to Terry Boot, which ended with an epic cuddle fest. He blushes fiercely at the thought, glad he's obviously alone. He doesn't want to imagine what Ron would have to say, finding him in a strange bed, beet red. His mate has developed quite the mouth on him ever since he and Hermione broke up. Too many differences, she had said, and Harry could believe that. After the War, many things are different.
It’s the last Harry hears before he steps onto the clearing, facing Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and letting the ring fall between into the shadows, forgotten for all time.
Harry’s enjoying the warm, wet feeling around his soft cock. He would love to spend the bigger part of his life with Draco’s mouth wrapped around him, but he doesn’t get to indulge in this very often. Below them, there seems to be some kind of finale going on. There are many people on the stage and most of them sing something or other, so it’s an educated guess that there’s going to be a break soon.
A bell chimes somewhere in the back as he opens the door. Calliope has redecorated, again, and the walls are draped in red silk. The pillory in the corner, with its black wood, is a strong contrast, an immediate eyecatcher and he wonders how many of those she has sold since she made it the centerpiece of her shop.
“What’s the matter with you, Harry?” Hermione asks as he sits down at the Gryffindor table, picking a plate and loading it with scrambled eggs and bits of sausage and toast. He smiles at her.
“Me neither. We could eat and see what happens next? I was thinking about a nice Filet Mignon, some wine and a foot massage?”
It lasts for several minutes, all of which Harry is frantically wondering what he could do to help. His mind is blank, he can't even remember the simplest spell to stop nose bleeding, although he knows they learned one in their third week of first year. His fist clenches around his wand whenever a scream is especially bloodcurdling.
He remembers that day in their eight year, a stormy November morning. He walked the halls, still reeling under the PTSD from the war, feeling deeply wounded inside. Nobody seemed to understand him, seemed to acknowledge that fighting a madman since he was eleven, and dying in the end, even if he came back, had a lasting effect on one’s psyche. He tried to get better, even saw a Mind Healer regularly (they all did), but it wasn’t so easy, wasn’t over and done within weeks.
“Can you sit down with me? Maybe we can jog your memories.” His expression is pleading and needy and plain wrong in Harry’s opinion.
Fucking finally Draco takes him into his mouth, immediately starting the suction. It startles Harry into a deep moan, and he gets a cheeky look for his uncharacteristic sound. Which Draco is going to pay for later. For now, Harry lets him get away with it, too caught in the sensation of a skilled tongue lavishing his shaft. His glans is sensitive on the underside and it positively drives him mad when Draco uses the barest hint of teeth to tease him further. Tension is building deep inside his gut and it’s going to be a devastating orgasm once he finally reaches that peak.
“Remus, your son…” He chokes, unable to say more. But Lupin just smiles, the same that everyone else has given him, without lingering resentment that he is alive while they’re not. He only sees love, no matter who he looks at.
Draco is the Master of Blowjobs, courtesy of years and years of training. He remembers fondly that wild week some decades ago when they both trained how to deep-throat. Ever since, his husband’s mouth is like a black hole, sucking everything in with vigour. It’s an art form, really.
It’s the third day of waking up without Draco and his heart flutters pleasantly when he spots the new message from Draco.
He thinks about the little things that make him happy. Waking up beside Draco late on Sunday morning, wrapped up in each other and content with the world. Sitting at the breakfast table, just the two of them. Working in the garden behind their cottage, his fingernails crusted with mud and a huge smile splitting his face.
A moan brings Harry back to his favourite part of his birthday, the present. He has made himself one just before he left for work this morning and it’s time to open it. He smiles as he sips the whisky, looking at the tightly bound bundle right under a potted palm tree.
His voice now is guttural, broken, and so hoarse Harry’s throat hurts in sympathy. Malfoy tries to muffle his cries with his hands, and Harry sees blood, tears, and snot dripping from his fingers. It’s ugly and messy, and definitely not just a show. Not even Malfoy is that good an actor.
Harry pants with exhaustion when Draco collapses on his chest. Draco purrs like a kitten, little puffs that not only warm Harry’s skin but also his heart. His husband is the equivalent of a pet cat, all contradiction, sharp angles, soft curves and soft fur. He can be ferocious, deadly, but it’s all hidden beneath his tame appearance.
This time, it seems more important than ever since Harry is going to witness something special. They have never done this before and it took several years for Draco to allow it. Harry is nervous and he wants to pick just the right thing to wear, something that will speak of support and love and compassion. It’s stupid to want to express those things with clothes, but he is sure Draco would understand.
He picks up a crimson robe on his way out of the bedroom and conveniently finds his wand in one of the pockets. The hallway outside the room is dark and dusty, littered with scraps of faded wallpaper, broken furniture, and glass shards. The windows are boarded up, letting only the faintest rays of light inside, just enough so Harry doesn’t hurt himself on the debris.
Instead of soft touches, Harry slaps both tits, soft at first, but quickly warming to the task. It’s too dark to see properly, but he still sees the skin redden. Draco’s breath hitches, not prepared for a different sensation, but he’s practically melting when his masochistic side wins. He’s a slut for pain, soaking up even the little things Harry gives him, always eager for more. There’s not much to do in this setting, but he can up his game just a little more.
Harry should’ve known that Malfoy is a sneaky bastard. “I said ‘I’ll promise’. I never actually promised anything and you didn’t ask me for it.” His smile is smug, but it doesn’t carry the air of superiority he had in fourth or fifth year, so Harry doesn’t mind. Much.
He’s still wondering where he is or why he’s even here when the voice calls for him again. Despite the tiredness in his bones and the confusion he picks up the discarded crimson robes near the door and moves outside the bedroom.
A soft melody whispers through the air and stills Harry immediately. The song is beautiful and memories come to his mind: their first kiss, the first time Draco said ‘I love you’, their first day at the cottage, their wedding. The songs is about love, about forever, deep feelings that sometimes can’t be contained, and the pictures change. Harry sees their first time making love on his bed at Grimmauld Place, their first row and the following make-up sex, their passionate wedding night.
There are boots on his feet, heavy and sturdy, shimmering in the pale light. Dragonhide, his mind supplies, but he doesn't know how he knows. He's wearing black jeans that fit surprisingly well. There is a hole in the knee, but it doesn't come from prolonged use.
He shoves his cock into Draco’s mouth, immediately welcomed by an eager tongue and strong sucking, and he goes deepers, relentlessly fucking his cock into Draco’s throat, disregarding the fact that his harsh movements jostle the trapped bollocks.
He carefully mashes the potatoes with milk, butter, grated nutmeg and adds his secret ingredient: cinnamon. Harry always wants to know what it is that makes Draco’s mashed potatoes so special, but he withholds it every time. Not even the meanest torture - Harry tickling him until he can’t breathe - can pry it from his lips.
Malfoy finally seems to notice that he isn’t alone. His face lights up for a second before he must see Harry's expression.
Harry hooks the leash on him again and leads through into the darkness and behind the counter. He brushes something aside, likely a curtain, and suddenly, there is light. They step into a white-tiled, sterile-looking room with a medical chair, not unlike the one Hermione’s parents have at their dentist’s office. It smells clean, but there’s the slight sting of an antiseptic burning in Draco’s nose. He narrowly avoids sneezing as he takes in the different charts and pictures on the wall. Some of them are medical, but some are art shots.
It looks like King’s Cross, but it isn’t. Harry thinks he can hear trains in the distance, but all he sees is white. He’s calm, collected, and he thinks it’s pretty neat for a seventeen year-old who recently died. The thought floats away, like the vapour of a steam engine.
Draco shakes his head, then nods, then shakes it again. There’s a strangled “Please!”, then incoherent mumbling, just like Harry expected.
Leave it to Ron to be equally insightful and oblivious. Like Harry doesn’t know it isn’t like sixth year, doesn’t know Malfoy just likes to spend time with him. Like Harry actually claimed that Malfoy is doing something sinister and Harry just keeps an eye on him. Like they both aren’t a bit lonely in this castle full of couples. So he just shrugs and proceeds to peel an orange.
“Granger made these? It’s genius. No wonder we couldn’t catch Dumbledore’s Army,” Malfoy says, almost to himself. His fingers swipe over the letters, setting them all alight as a sign they are activated, before he does another round, turning them all off. “How do you send it?”
While Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star, Harry and Draco are fast asleep, dreaming of each other.
Working as a Healer, Draco has surrounded himself with flowers. His office looks like a tropical greenhouse: white-yellow plumeria and countless orchids, red poppies and white roses, all symbols of his work. Draco needs to surround himself in perfection and beauty, needs to remind himself of the sacrifices his job demands.
When he comes back with two glasses of champagne, his face is aflame with embarrassment, but his breathing is heavier. He’s an exhibitionistic slut, just like Harry likes to show him around for people to see. They don’t indulge in this kind of scene often, so it’s even more exciting.
After that they venture to unusual places quite often. They explore London, starting with the huge garden at Grimmauld Place, which is nice but not quite public enough, but the night is sticky warm as are their bodies and the shout with which Draco comes is loud enough to wake more than one straying neighborhood dog.
The door falls closed behind them, shutting out the stress of the hospital for a few, precious minutes.
It’s hard to have the Saviour of the Wizarding World as your husband, when you yourself are a low-life Death Eater with a Dark Mark to show. To this day there are still speculations if their marriage is just part of an elaborate scheme and that, maybe, he controls Harry’s mind with the Imperius Curse, nevermind that they’re married for decades and not even the Dark Lord could cast a spell strong enough to hold a single person for this long. Certainly Draco couldn’t. He’s good with any kind of spell, strong and able, but he could never muster enough meaning to make his Cruciatus Curse work, and he certainly was too weak-minded to control somebody.
It’s hard for Draco to accept that in some circles he’s just seen as an addendum. Nobody is disrespectful or rude, but there are rules that are followed to the “T”. It’s still strange and it doesn’t help that they agreed to all of it in the beginning and adjusted the rules over the years to both their liking.
The Opera House is a sight to behold, but Harry only has eyes for his husband. Draco looks at it with reverence, his face illuminated by bright blue lights. There are pictures projected on the usually white walls tonight, but neither pays any attention to what they are.
“For free. They melt every heart, trust me.” She winks at him, but he isn’t exactly sure why. Malfoy’s waiting for him by the door, his hands thankfully empty. He looks surprised when Harry dumps everything on him.
Draco remembers their first date - not the fancy restaurant they both hated or the paparazzi following them, demanding to know what the Saviour was doing with a disgusting Death Eater, but their chance meeting at Battersea Park in the wee hours of morning.
The first step is always the hardest, Draco knows. It’s all those what-ifs keeping him from doing it. What if he does it wrong? What if he forgets something? What if he can’t do it at all? What if the others will laugh at him? What if…?
Still, it’s the thoughtful things that get Draco every time. Like the snitch. During one of the many games in the orchard behind the Burrow, Draco finally managed the unthinkable - he caught the snitch before Harry could. He wanted to keep this memento but after the deafening cheers had died down it was nowhere to be found. Draco only saw it again at his wedding, when Harry put the ring on his finger. While it was the simple platinum band they agreed on, Draco's had rich golden ornaments and a small stone, equally golden. It was the snitch, worked into the metal in an intricate pattern that ultimately symbolised the wings. It was the inscription on the inside, however, that got to Draco “You caught my heart first”.
Harry isn’t a big fan of winter. It’s cold and dark and gloomy. When he was young, he was always freezing because the Dursleys couldn’t have been bothered to buy him a fitting jacket or some sturdy boots. It all changed when he finally got the money, his vaults full of shiny gold, and the first winter after the war he maybe had gone a bit overboard. He still owns three of the five different greatcoats he bought that day and more boots than he cares to count and while he is slightly embarrassed about it, the certainty to have clothes, no matter how harsh the weather, doesn’t allow him to feel bad.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts like a bitch, his muscles scream at him like he just ran a marathon, and his throat is parched like he hasn't had anything to drink in eons. Despite all that he's relatively comfortable. He isn't in his own bed in the eighth year dorm, but the mattress is soft and the blankets warm. Through the curtains falls soft, dim light, typical for a winter day in Scotland.
Something rustles behind him, but when he looks back, Malfoy is still muffled up, following Harry’s lead. He doesn’t have a destination, so he just walks, pretending to do some window shopping, while he wonders what he should do. The rustle follows him, but he never sees anything suspicious and Malfoy doesn’t talk. They wander the length of the village, finding themselves opposite the Shrieking Shack. It’s almost dark when Harry stops and swirls around, tired of the continued silence.
The silence between them is uncomfortable for the first time. Harry shuffles his trainers over the stony ground, willing Malfoy to say something, to set this right, whatever this is.
Mrs Weasley demanding of Draco to leave the Burrow and never come back ended in harsh sobs and ugly tears when Harry left with him.
It’s maybe selfish of him, but all his life he waited for something, somebody. He waited for somebody to save him from the Dursleys, he waited for something magical to happen. He waited for Quirrel to take the stone, for Sirius to take him home, waited to see Draco again, waited for Voldemort to finally kill him. This time, people are waiting for him. This time he can choose where or when he’s going.
The whole day has been about first steps, about rising upon their innermost doubts, beating insecurities, about showing the world they’re meant to be together. Everyone had been against them.
For a few years they developed a taste for morally questionable places. But having sex in a graveyard was nothing compared to a quicky behind a tree at the Weasley Orchard, mere metres away from an enthusiastic Molly, picking apples, chatting to Arthur about another grandchild on the way.
Sorry for the non-existent smut, but if I would get started, you'd be easily reading 7k, which are a bit much for this ;)
“It’s alright, Steph. Thank you,” Malfoy says nonchalantly, dismissing her. She takes the opportunity, obviously glad to escape, and leaves. He smiles pleasantly at Harry, like he did nothing wrong, and maybe he didn’t, but the doubt is there now, poisoning Harry’s thoughts. Was everything just an elaborate distraction from Malfoy’s plans? He doesn’t know.
There have been many first steps, many first times and they mastered them. Still, Draco’s stomach flutters nervously as he nods, sensing Harry needs more confirmation than his weary eyes can give.
Someone is calling him, so Harry peels the sheets from his body and scoots over to the edge of the curtains. His muscles scream in agony, but the pain feels pure, just like after an intense Quidditch practice. Or several of them. His brain thrums away in his skull, but that pain is also manageable. Only, when he puts his feet to the ground, everything is wrong.
They were lying in bed, exhausted after a day of intense play, sweaty and relaxed like never before. Draco was breathing heavily, having done most of the work, small rivulets of sweat running down his temple. He looked positively delicious and despite his bone deep satisfaction, Harry felt a faint stirring in his groin. How couldn’t he, with this naughty angel right beside him. He glanced at the endless legs, the concave belly, dusky nipples, the whole picture only slightly disturbed by a criss-cross of scars that he still couldn’t look at too long without feeling guilty.
They’re both riding the fence of excitement and frustration, and it’s probably the best feeling in the world. It’s a pity when the bell finally announces that the second act is soon to begin. With a sigh Harry pushes Draco back to his feet, hands ready to steady him. He’s wobbly on his feet, the situation not helped by the unfamiliar heels.
A door creaks ominously, revealing a bathroom. As he gets up, everything feels odd for a moment, but he can’t see why, and he doesn’t linger on the thought. Although he realises now that he isn’t in any dorm, isn’t sure if he’s even at Hogwarts, he isn’t worried.
“It’s lovely of you to finally come to visit me. I’ve been dying to get your opinion on my new plaything,” she says, without greeting Draco and only meaning for Harry to hear.
It took an obscene amount of money to secure the box only for them (they’re usually shared), but the money’s worth it as they sit down in the first row with a perfect view of the stage. The lights are already out and it doesn’t take long for the orchestra to assemble.
He opens the parcel still in Draco’s hands and carefully lifts the contents out of the box. He has inspected it in the shop with Calliope, so this is just for show. Draco isn’t allowed to look and his hands tremble slightly, even though the parcel isn’t heavy.
It’s a short walk until he’s standing in a parlour. The room must have been a sight to behold in previous days, but it’s just as dismal as the hallway. The only interesting thing is fresh drops of blood leading him further on.
“I’m gonna turn you around, and you’re gonna hold onto the banister and look at the box over there.”
“Yeah, it’s me,” he answers. It’s odd to hear his first name spoken so softly, and not that hateful “Potter”. It's too intimate, a thought that makes his skin crawl in discomfort. Being intimate with the likes of Malfoy isn’t something he wants to imagine.
The timeframe that is important is the developement of Draco's headaches (I hope you noticed by now and aren't surprised). It will lead to a conclusion and give us the opening for the much longer, much darker 'verse I am planning.
The last week before the Holidays passes in a rush. There’s more homework, more papers, more everything, but it doesn’t bother Harry. He’s taken to stopping by the library for an hour or two, escaping the couples in the common room that are enacting goodbye scenes at every opportunity, even though they still have a few days before the train takes them back home. Everywhere he looks, someone is making out or softly crying in desperation over the forced separation, but since it’s for a good and pure reason, he doesn’t mind it much. He's still annoyed, because everyone seems to have someone.
“Harry told me he wanted to give you something special for your birthday and told me about your wish to get your nipples pierced. While you both are in a safe, sane, and consensual relationship, this isn’t something we can do without your explicit consent and me explaining what it will entail. Please sit down and let’s talk.”
Malfoys hands fly over the letters, the glow softly reflecting in his white face. His fingers are fast and Harry can’t follow them all, helpless when he sees him tapping the middle three times to send it to every other coin. A few seconds pass, then Harry hears the choked exhale of someone reading the message, followed by a few snickers. Over the crowd he hears Ron’s enraged “How dare he?” and Hermione’s frantic tries to shush him, to not make a scene. Malfoy slides the Galleon back over the table.
Harry notices they’re both wearing basically the same clothes, a black jumper, black jeans, and dragonhide boots. There’s probably a crimson robe somewhere around here, too. It’s his first question.
He doesn’t want that questionable honour, not with what it cost him to gather all three. He thinks of his parents, thinks of Sirius and Dumbledore. He thinks of Dobby. They all protected him, but what for? So he can go further, just a few steps and get slaughtered like a lamb. But no, Harry reminds himself, it’s not about death. It’s about sacrifices, the ones that every loved one in his life made. The one that he needs to make, to save his own loved ones. They don’t know that it’s his destiny to die, but they count on him to end this madness, to bring peace to the Wizarding world.
Malfoy is deep in thought, staring at nothing, and Harry feels compelled to at least give it a try and engage him in a conversation.
They weathered many storms together to be were they are now. Which changes nothing of the fact that Draco is alone in the shower wanting nothing more than Harry to be there with him.
He nods, satisfied with Kreacher’s work, and waits for Draco to catch up. His dragon pants heavily, sweat coating his alabaster skin, but his hard-on is still there, still dripping, so Harry knows he enjoys himself. He bumps into Harry’s leg, startled by the sudden stop, but not gone enough to forget his place. He keeps his eyes on the ground, relieved for the short break. Not for long.
As he finally gets home from another draining shift, plagued by an equally draining headache, the wireless is already humming, slow and muted, in the den. It’s barely audible from where he stands, and he watches the heartwarming scene in front of him.
Once the vomit stops, Malfoy falls still. He’s still breathing, but it’s shallow. His face is a mess of grime, tracks of tears breaking thick lines of blood. He looks eerily young like this, eyes closed, his wrinkles smoothed by his unconsciousness. It’s odd to combine the memory of Malfoy in sixth year with this adult version. There are so many similarities, but so many differences, too.
It takes another ten minutes before Draco stops in front of the shelf, finally admitting to his interest. His face is flushed, but it’s different now. It’s lust, plain and simple and Harry feels himself harden at the sight.
“You can decide either way, my boy.” Dumbledore looks at him with the familiar knowing twinkle in his eyes. “Sometimes the painful way is the most rewarding, sometimes life rewards us with a simple ending. I can neither advise one or the other. I can only promise you, that no matter which way you choose, the end will always be the same.”
Each of them can cook and they’re both doing fine on their own. But every time they are cooking together, it ends in a bloody mess. Draco pinches his nose, slowly massaging his painfully pulsing eyes with his thumb and forefinger. It’s one of those days, when the light thrashes spikes of agony through his skull and every sound sends violent vibrations in his brain.
It only occurs to him what real darkness means when something crashes into his head, rendering him unconscious.
He pulls the dress up, bunching it against his hips, exposing himself. The panties bulge around his cock. It’s the cock cage, but Harry is sure it’s quite uncomfortable by now, suppressing an impressive hard-on. He pulls the panties down, slowly, inch by inch, stopping when the cage is visible. The way Draco’s member presses against the confines looks painful, but he’s getting off on it too, he can tell.
Draco takes Harry’s hand in his, and they kiss, slow and chaste, for the first time in a very long time. They hold hands as they board the train, a journey they can finally make together.
He is used to the eyes that immediately zero in on him, but apart from the weeks just after the school year started, the other students and people in Hogsmeade are fairly used to him now. Some smile at him, but they are all occupied with each other, sharing drinks and stories and just being social. Hermione waves him over, which is a bit embarrassing, because she nearly topples out of her chair, and he waves back, telling her he will come over soon. He gets a Butterbeer and a shot of Firewhisky, because he is an adult and he rarely indulges in alcohol, and scans the room. All the tables are packed with people, couples, and friends of couples. The teachers sit on their own in the corner by the Christmas tree. Hermione waves again and Harry sighs. But just as he starts his way over, his eyes catch an empty table - or almost empty.
Granted, Harry really is the philistine Draco always accused him of, so he has no idea what opera they’re hearing, nor does he care, since it’s almost time for the part that he gets to enjoy his present. He barely pays attention as a bloke, dressed in feathers, begins to sing. The words are foreign, hard but melodic, and Harry thinks he’s heard that language before, but it’s just an afterthought.
It isn’t the right time of the year for a prolonged walk on the beach or visiting the zoo. Draco grows more desperate with every passing day and the headaches don’t help at all. It’s hard to think with the stress of work and the constant pain in his skull.
“And new jeans and shoes. And if you’re already there, maybe a whole new set of jumpers and trousers - not those atrocious denim abominations.” Malfoy puts his wand away and ticks his fingers as if making a list.
As he watches Malfoy sleep, he can recall the deep-seated hatred he felt for the longest time, the bewilderment when the git refused to identify him at Malfoy Manor. Those memories seem even farther away, like so many things happened between then and now; it’s all washed out. Harry wonders just how close they work together when thinking about their school days feels almost nostalgic.
Malfoy convulses for another minute, his nerve endings fired up enough that they don’t immediately realise the hurt is gone. He begins to sob, his cries muffled, but clearly there. Harry's chest swells in accomplishment until soft, pathetic whispers reach his ear.
Through the rush of blood in his ears, he hears faint music, a crescendo of sound and light that explodes the same time as he empties himself into Draco.
Despite all the extravaganzas that happened over the years, Harry likes the simple ones. He is the happiest when they all meet at the Burrow and enjoy Molly’s home-cooked meat pies and the best treacle tart on Earth.
“Can I see?” Malfoy breaks the silence at last, looking intently at the coin. Harry slides it over for him to inspect, trusting he won’t mess with it. He has to start putting his trust somewhere.
He pulls the quilt higher, wrapping it around them like a cocoon and sighs in contentment. He tries to keep his eyes open, but they won’t obey him.
Sure enough, when he wakes up a the next morning, the bed is cold again, but another note is waiting for him.
He suffers through those evenings, glad when they finally stayed long enough to alleviate Draco’s conscience, and gets home, emotionally exhausted and sometimes even physically injured. Alright, maybe he exaggerates a bit, but there had been one time, when Pansy had poked him with an actually hat needle (what is it with her obsession with hats) and he bled onto the white tablecloth. Needless to say Blaise made fun of him for that incident for the next three meetings.
He slowly pulls away, letting Draco sink back on all fours, before he stands and conjures a leather leash, matching the colour of the collar. He hooks it in the small silver-ring on the front and pulls gently, catching Draco’s attention through the haze of stimulation.
Harry vanishes through the Floo with one last, lingering and sweet kiss, leaving Draco behind with a painful half-erection and barely reigned in impatience for the week to be over.
It’s primal, raw, a Veela mating dance, without the finesse of a professional dancer, but even more intoxicating.
The matter is settled when Harry puts a hand on his shoulder. It’s just a suggestion, he can back out any time he likes, but Draco loves it when his husband takes charge.
Harry thinks for a while. His thoughts are scattered, but simple. He can go ‘back’ or he can go ‘forth’. He doesn’t know what ‘back’ means, doesn’t know where ‘forth’ will take him. When he thinks of ‘back’, there is a slight pang, a pain so delicate and yet deep, that he can’t breathe for a moment. When he thinks of ‘forth’ there is only calm and warmth and the distinct knowledge that something, someone is waiting for him.
What makes him feel even better is that his husband, filthy rich since his birth, never judges him for it. Of course, Draco snorts when they tidy up the wardrobes, putting away the summer clothes to make room for their winter collection. He always looks at the three coats, still immaculate and slightly out of fashion, but despite all his snark, he never jokes about it. Their school days are long over and ever since it started, ever since they got to know each other so well, he refrains from teasing Harry for his misshapen childhood.
It’s the strangest double date they ever had. Pansy is almost tame, shooting her poisonous barbs at those who really deserve it, namely impatient patients and crude criminals. Blaise recounts his day at the office, and serves them perfectly made spag bol, followed by chocolate lava cake. It’s perfect and Harry enjoys every minute, something he hasn’t thought possible after the hat incident.
It was the first time he said it, but Harry will never forget it, and until this day it’s his Patronus memory.
Over the last few months their feud died down. They both have seen enough violence during the war and lost their taste for mindless rivalry. Malfoy keeps to himself, somewhat isolated from the Slytherins, but they don’t actively avoid him. He just seems more content being alone. Harry can relate to that.
A loud gurgle breaks the silence. His hand comes up to his stomach and he realises he hasn’t eaten in forever. He can’t remember the last time, but it isn’t a surprise considering he also can’t remember growing up past his school days. Something catches his attention, an insistent blinking in the corner of his left eye, and he follows it to find a fully equipped kitchen. The blinking turns out to be an oven lamp, signaling that the baking is now done. It’s the same oven that Aunt Petunia has in her kitchen and it’s absolutely out of place. This house feels like a Wizarding place.
He shuffles forward a bit, then presses Draco’s face into his arse. He doesn’t need to say it out loud, and Draco immediately sets to work. Harry loves his talented tongue and mouth and he gives himself over to the feeling of both of them working his hole.
It’s a tricky matter, tempting Draco to let go of his unyielding control over the creature. While the Veela is an inseparable part of him, he hates giving up his body. They never talk about why that is, but Harry knows it had been Voldemort who woke the Veela, and had even witnessed some of the things that had been done to Draco while being inside Voldemort’s head.
There are fairy lights, some of them Muggle since the Wizarding community opened up and slowly adapted, but most of them are made of real fairies who are flittering around, drenching everything in bright red and green and gold. It’s still a whole month until Christmas, but Harry is in a decidedly festive mood. Just this morning, he had a taste of the first gingerbread of the season and it was spicy and tasty and perfect.
He’s stopped mumbling and instead watches every move, flinching whenever Harry moves too fast or outside his line of vision. It’s painful to watch, this kind of helplessness.
“This house is - was the hideout of a very dangerous necromancer. You and I, we work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, although we aren’t partners or even work for the same division. I am a Cursebreaker, you are an Auror. This necromancer was said to be the next Dark Lord, so everyone tried to catch him. Still took us six months to finally pinpoint his location. We followed him to this house. You and I, we wanted to wait for reinforcement, but Croaker, the Head of the Department of Mysteries, was adamant we go in immediately, arrest the necromancer and destroy any artifacts we could find. He pulled rank on us, so we had to obey him. We all knew it was a huge mistake, but he didn’t care. He just wanted to get one over Head Auror Robarts. They’re always fighting…
He remembers the War and all the trauma it caused, but it feels equally long ago and recent. He remembers the decaying body of Voldemort, crumbling into a pile of stinking skin and bones after the magic that held it together was gone. He remembers the stomach-turning stench, the disgusting colours. But his memory is muted, dim, like an old Muggle film in sepia. He can’t tell if he was alone or surrounded by people or even where he was when it happened.
Walpurgis Night paints it all in shadows, only allowing the ghosts to linger. Instead of laughter, the Manor is now a place of tears and crippling sadness. Everyone is dead and long forgotten and the pain squeezes Draco's chest painfully.
The fabrics are softer and seem more sturdy. Some of them are infused with magic for better fit or longer durability. He has self-cooling shirts for hot summers, and auto-warming socks for the Scottish winters.
“You want to come, Dragon? You want to show these people what a slut you are? Maybe I should strip you and fuck you on that table, invite other people to use your mouth so your screams won’t be too loud?”
“It’s not your fault,” Draco says, but that only makes the tears come faster. “They would have killed me anyway. My life was over the second the Dark Lord knew of our connection. I was living on borrowed time when they caught you.” His hand lifts from Harry’s shoulder and begins to pet his hair. It feels more like a soft breeze than actual fingers, but it’s soothing nonetheless.
Harry watches as he stops mid-movement, recognising the mistake he just made. He’s well aware every movement will hurt, but if he wants to go anywhere, Draco needs to make very, very small moves. He learns that lesson quickly, as he shuffles behind Harry, stopping every so often to relieve his bollocks. Harry gladly gives him the time, because he knows Draco hasn’t thought about the struggle that is waiting for him, and he waits with anticipation for the moment he realises that their bedroom is on the second floor and he will have to climb the stairs in this state.
The night is cold, but the stars shine bright above Ladies Pond and their bench is unoccupied when they get there. All the time Draco spent racking his brain what to do pays off when he sees Harry’s eyes light up in recognition. They settle under the blankets, enjoying a quiet night, just the two of them, and when the sun comes up, they share a single perfect kiss.
"So, what went wrong?" Harry asks because it's obvious things don't go according to plan. Malfoy's injuries are a testament to that.
“I saw you with Malfoy,” Ron says between two bites of kidney pie. Half-chewed pieces of meat spill out between his words and Hermione chokes. Harry raises one eyebrow in an imitation of the mentioned Malfoy, but he chooses not to comment. If he doesn’t make a big deal out of it, maybe the others won’t either. He should know better.
This year is more calm and laid-back than the years before. The children are all grown up now, and with Rose and Roxanne still at the beginning of their pregnancies it will be some time before the flurry of crying babies and soiled nappies will start again.
With a start he realises it is, indeed, an angel and his very own. He has never seen Draco’s Veela but he couldn’t have imagined a better place or a better time. The sunset is the perfect canvas to highlight the beauty of the creature that is his husband. His torso is naked, but the cold doesn’t seem to faze Draco as he draws closer and begins to dance.
Anyway, I had the feeling it was all too cheery and relationships aren't like that. So I felt I needed to write something more realistic ("The more I read, the more I think you are processing our relationship," my fiance says. What a surprise!).
And while the Veela still demands his attention from time to time, the hurt fades over the years, leaving him content, happily surrounded by his family.
The moan is louder, coming right from inside the door and Harry is pleased. He has been afraid the long hours he had to spend at the office would kill the mood, but apparently all is well. He just stands there for a few minutes, listening, going over his plan for the evening. Everything is prepared and he is ready to get this show on the road.
Ron nods, like he understands completely, but the wary expression in his eyes belies the motion. “So you think he’s up to something?” he asks finally, before he cuts another huge piece of pie and crams it into his mouth. Hermione lets her cutlery clatter onto the table and gets up, huffing in disgust, before she leaves the Great Hall, probably heading for the library.
Something is itching in the back of his mind, and it isn’t a headache, which is new and refreshing these days. It still bugs him for several days, before a tiny and innocent fleece blanket finally breaks the stubborn bubble of cluelessness.
He reaches the stairs long before his dragon and checks for the adjustments. Instead of their normal staircase, there are many more, albeit flatter, steps; the staircase magically expanded to accommodate the changes.
Milo is clinging to Harry’s neck, refusing to let go, and he hasn’t felt his left hand for some minutes now, as Mila has it in a powerful grip. They are just two of five children they rescued from a cult of necromancers, willing to sacrifice them on the upcoming Solstice ĺnight.
“Good, I want you to show me,” Harry demands, a little cold, but only to suppress his own excitement. He has strict rules, not only for his sub, but for himself. Never showing his cards until the end is one of them, and he revels in the desperation Draco sometimes shows because it’s hard to get a reaction out of Harry.
The snow is drenched in colours, but Harry just has eyes for the fading light. He knows it’s almost time, and he’s torn between waiting and just enjoying the quiet winter afternoon. It doesn’t take long for him to get giddy, his left leg bouncing with excitement and nervousness.
It had been one of the most interesting if not saddest days of his life and it was the beginning of their relationship. It was soon after that Harry had to justify himself and his blossoming relationship with Draco for the first time.
Draco nods eagerly. He doesn’t know what will happen, but he knows Harry has some special things planned for them, and taking the potions will surely make it even more special. He will still read the instructions and decide only then what he will do, but he trusts his husband to have chosen something that is worth his time.
“It’s a bondage horse, in case you were wondering. This is the compact form, just the body without any extras. The wood is Amboyna Burl, giving you that extra kick. Powerful and energetic, but needs a hard hand. In contrast, the leather is simple cowhide, soft, and easy to maintain. The wood is powerful enough to infuse the cowhide with its properties, so it would be overkill to use magical leather.”
When they arrive in their box, they’re still breathless. Harry doesn’t give them time to take a breather, loses his suit jacket and pulls Draco down on his lap again, this time pushing the dress aside so he can touch without fabric in the way.
But of course, Harry is. He steps behind Draco, pulling his arms behind his back. The position forces Draco to bear down onto the cushion, grinding his weight more firmly into the horse.
Some decades ago they even tested it with twins, back when sick medical experiments were allowed and encouraged, and while they fit all criteria, they weren’t able to conceive, thank Merlin for that. It means that it’s more likely another Dark Lord rises, creates a horde of Horcruxes and claims immortality than finding a perfect pair.
Tonight isn’t about extreme pain, but Draco doesn’t know that. Harry knows he loves this kind of insecurity; it gives him a thrill.
A rustle disturbs the quiet evening and his wings unfold. Harry stares at him in awe, like he sees them for the first time. It’s cute and a bit embarrassing, the way his eyes sparkle. The Veela basks in the awestruck attention and spreads his wings even wider, showing off perfect white feathers flecked with the last remnants of light.
And, despite being together for Merlin-knows-how-long, the Veela still drives him mad with want and desire. Although Harry thinks he must be immune to its allure by now, he still catches himself doing questionable things trying to get its attention.
I was like "I want to do a reaaaally short one, because sometimes everything is said and done in a few words" and well, I think it fit perfectly.
The silver chain of the leash tinkles softly as Harry attaches it to Draco’s leather collar. A thrill rushes through him at being dragged around like a naughty Crup. Harry knows what public displays do to him, and they often engage in such scenes. He fondly remembers their evening at Hyde Park a few years back.
Also, I'm interested in a long term beta reader, if one of you is interested. ;) Until the next time!
Beyond, there is an overgrown garden, but the trees look all wrong. They’re wound around themselves like they suffered incredible pain and tried to shield themselves from it. Some of the trees even seem to have faces, contorted in agony. Dean has made them all watch Muggle horror films, and the feeling that Harry is trapped in one gets stronger with each passing second. There are pieces of evidence that something is very wrong, the least his totally changed body.
They hissed at him angrily, accusing him of taking advantage of Draco, who couldn’t defend himself in a world that hated him. Who had no other choice but to stay with the Saviour, who only got his job because of Harry’s name and would lose it as soon as he dared to leave. It was all nonsense, of course, but even Pansy and Blaise seemed convinced. What did it say about them all, when even Draco’s closest friends didn’t believe in them.
Harry acquires some samples - being the Chosen One is useful sometimes, but only for something as simple as free reject chocolate. He presents Malfoy his spoils and just nods at the unspoken question. The hand that snatches some small pieces of a destroyed Chocolate Frog is shaking lightly, but Harry doesn’t know if it’s some kind of misplaced awe or just the first signs of low blood sugar. He decides on excitement when he sees Malfoy closing his eyes in utter bliss as the chocolate melts on his tongue. He’s sure he can hear a soft groan, even though nobody else can.
He barely makes it out of the fireplace when he is assaulted by the intense smell of roasting meat and freshly chopped garlic. It’s odd, since they never eat at any of their houses. Pansy and Blaise meet them at the chosen restaurant, ten minutes after Draco and Harry arrive, since it’s fashionable to be always the last one to arrive. They have it down to an artform, and are always punctual on the second, and Harry suspects more than witchcraft behind it. Judging from the evil twinkle in Pansy’s eyes whenever he admits that they were exactly ten minutes late, not a second earlier or later, she seems to be in league with demons or the devil.
Draco lights up immediately. Although he isn’t fixated on material things, not like he was when they were in school, he likes getting things, especially when Harry chooses them for him. He steps up to the mantle, only to sink into a perfect curtsy, immaculate, and still and waiting.
They soon decide to spent the last weekend before the break in Hogsmeade, again. Harry thinks it’s nice that they both stay over the Holidays, since the castle will be nearly empty. They won’t need to find excuses for why they spend so much time together. Ron still thinks Harry thinks Malfoy is up to something. He spends every breakfast pointing out how nice Malfoy has been in the last months, how he doesn’t pick fights anymore, and that this is evidence enough that something's wrong. Hermione, in turn, doesn’t say a thing, but she looks at Harry in a way that tells him she knows something he doesn’t. It isn’t her usual know-it-all look, but something softer. Sometimes she looks at him, snorts and shakes her head, like he’s the biggest idiot in the room, which is a feat considering they’re in the Great Hall.
For now, however, Harry has slipped on his dominant personality, brooking no argument. And he wants to open his present, to unravel the delicious package and ravage the core. He frees the hands, Draco will need them soon.
It always annoyed Draco, the constant noise in the background of his life, but he couldn’t resent Harry’s passion when he only just learned to life after his own rules. It took some time, but eventually he got used to it, and even developed his own taste.
Like today. Draco is the only Healer experienced enough to treat the little girl that came onto the ward this morning. Her parents have taken care of her for a long time, but her condition unexpectedly turned worse and now her life is on knife’s edge. Nobody seems to know what spell hit her and reversing such a thing is almost impossible, but the parents were willing to try as soon as they realised their daughter would likely die without proper care.
His left hand fiddles with the ring on his right thumb. It’s made of silver, in a fashion that Harry wouldn’t willingly wear, but it has been there since he woke up, and he’s reluctant to take it off. It’s just a small movement in the corner of his eyes, but it’s enough to catch his attention. As Malfoy puts the cup away, Harry sees a copy of the ring on his right thumb, too.
“There’s nothing going on. We’re just spending some time together. You know, like normal people. Talking. Nothing more.”
Draco is filthy when he finally gets home after twelve hours of sick people. While he is usually working on the fourth floor with long-term spell damage victims, whenever there is an epidemic, he is helping out. Winters are filled with sick children waiting to get their Pepper-Up, summers with irresponsible adults suffering heat strokes.
There are voices coming from the kitchen and it makes Harry instantly suspicious. There should only be one voice - and Draco isn’t prone to monologuing. He stops dead in his tracks when he reaches kitchen.
Their farewell is sweet and steamy, softly murmured words and naughty sex on the kitchen table between the Prophet and strawberry jam.
Harry loves his birthday. True, it took almost two decades before he developed a taste for it, but now he can’t get enough. He loves the cakes especially made for this occasion; he loves the scent of fresh flowers that will flood his house and his office. He loves the feast Mrs Weasley dishes up every year; the home cooked meals, the treacle tart snitches; the biscuits drenched in colourful icing, the firewhiskey served late after dinner. He loves meeting his friends; his extended family, being free of the madness that is the Auror Office, relaxing in his favourite armchair with mundane conversation. But most of all, Harry loves his presents.
Draco knows it’s still a long way before he’s forgiven and he thinks some people never will. His name is ruined, not that he cares much for it, but it still causes some of his patients and visitors to frown at him and demand a different Healer to treat them or their relatives. He can understand their reservations, but it’s still frustrating, and some days it outright hurts him down to the core.
Draco is nervous, a state he finds himself in quite often. Anxiety is his trusted companion since the war, and sometimes it peaks so high that his hands shake and his breath comes in short, painful puffs. Fortunately, today it isn’t so bad.
At Hogwarts it was much of the same. Scheming Slytherins didn’t have much time to sit down and enjoy Celestina Warbeck, or whatever other nonsense was on.
“That’ll just complicate things, but it’s no surprise,” Malfoy says. He tries to get up again but doesn’t have much luck this time either. He seems weaker, like Harry’s memory loss sucked a good portion of energy out of him.
In hindsight Draco is glad that Harry had been away in Poland on some Auror conference and hadn’t noticed Draco’s relapse in old habits. But those Muggles… he still shudders in disgust, thinking about them. He has never seen more hatred, never heard more vile insults outside the war that weren’t directed at himself. Hermione and him had only been able to obtain what they needed with a mix of force and well-placed blackmail, and they both agreed to never mention to a living soul what length they went.
“It’s alright, Harry. I’d rather see him grow up, but I know he will live in a better world than we ever had. He will be loved and taken care of, and that’s all I could wish for.”
“Well, I remembered how to transfigure something into a cup, but not much else. No.” Harry shakes his head.
“I guess I am. Although I can’t remember since when you’d call me Harry. Or the actual year. Or anything else,” he says snidely, waiting for a melodramatic fit. Hopes for it, really, because it would be the only normal thing he’s encountered all day.
It’s Dumbledore’s voice, and the person looks like him, but for a split second Harry sees something else. A shadowy figure, draped in a dark cloak, looking unbelievable old and oddly kind. Just like the thought before, the image vanishes. He smiles as he sees his old mentor again.
He doesn’t need to count the beat in his head, doesn’t need to watch his feet. Everything falls into place.
Harry can see how desperate he is, his dick hard and dripping onto the stairs, flushed red with need. They long since abandoned cock rings, as Draco has learned to never come without permission, and it must be quite urgent for him to speak up now. He’s probably seconds away from coming.
They fall silent again, while Malfoy drinks more water and Harry contemplates all he’s heard. At least people know they’re in trouble and try to rescue them. And it’s Ron and Hermione, the two people Harry can rely on most in this world.
It’s hard to stay silent right now. Because he wants to try the horse, even though he can’t imagine how exactly it would work. But that’s the beauty of it because, in this role, he doesn’t have to imagine. He just has to let himself be led by his Dom. So he waits for Harry to decide and shivers in excitement when, finally, Harry turns and unhooks the leash, a delighted glint in his eyes.
The next week happens in a blur. Harry does everything like he normally would, getting up before the others to enjoy a long, hot shower with some additional pleasure, rolling his eyes at the antics of Ron and Hermione, Neville and Luna, Ernie MacMillan and Dennis Creevey, or every other lovey-dovey couple. He goes to his classes, does his homework, eats in the Great Hall, and learns some more after supper, so he can get a good result in his NEWTs.
However, there are still things Draco can’t forgive himself. Letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Getting Dumbledore killed. Watching the Dark Lord murder people without raising a finger. Watching Bellatrix torture Hermione. He shudders when he thinks about each and every mistake he did during the war. Sometimes he wakes in the middle of the night, the screams of countless victims in his ears.
“I know it’s been a long time and I’m sorry I didn’t bring Harry with me. I know you deserve to meet him, but I’m not ready. He’s too precious to wallow with us in the dark.”
The Glamour falls from him at the snap of Harry’s fingers, exposing their true identities. At the same time, he hears the lock on the shop door click. They’re alone here, there’s no need to hide anymore.
Harry swallows when he takes in the picture. Draco’s lips are on the same level as his crotch, and Harry’s dick perks with interest at the picture. His blond hair, usually straight, is wavy and pulled into a messy ponytail, a few bangs framing his face. It invites Harry to run his hands through it, grabbing it, and force Draco to just take it when he fucks his mouth. He barely suppresses a moan at the idea, but he can’t start the festivities before they have officially begun. Regretfully. It’s tempting to just call it all off and just stay at home in their dungeon.
It hadn’t even been his fault Pansy’s hat caught fire the first time they met, that one was on Draco, but ever since he has to suffer the consequences. Which means Pansy will be a cold-hearted bitch and Blaise will make fun of him the whole time.
Diagon Alley is unsurprisingly empty. In contrast to Muggles, Wizards hate the oppressing summer heat and many shops are already closed up for the day. Flourish and Blotts is dark, as well as the branch of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes since George and Ron have decided to take some time off to be with their families. Eeylops is still open due to the fact that the owls need to be fed daily anyway, so they keep it open throughout the whole year. Gringotts, of course, never closes - the Goblins hate the summer since everyone gets lazy in the sunshine, but closing up equals lost money, and this, the Goblins despise even more.
Small nicks are littering Malfoy’s body soon enough. They paint a fascinating pattern across his chest and down his arms. Harry pays special attention to the hand-shaped bruises on Malfoy’s hips, tracing them with the tip of the knife for a lasting image.
He looks so serious, counting out everything Harry needs to buy, that Harry can’t help but ask: “And why would I need so many new clothes? The jeans are perfectly fine!”
They both moan obscenely when his mouth closes over a sensitive nipple. It’s hard and gets even harder as he sucks fervently, eliciting groans and whimpers that are music to his ears. His tongue plays with the ring, pulling at it teasingly, and he feels the burst of precome through his dress shirt.
It happened often when he was fresh out of his apprenticeship: people refusing to be treated by him because he was Draco Malfoy, son of a war criminal and Death Eater himself. It’s why he was transferred to the fourth floor. People in a coma didn’t complain about who treated them. The families, of course, were another matter, but a formidable success, finally waking up a war victim of a prolonged Imperius curse, helped him get through some of those thick skulls.
Finally, Harry is allowed to see his birthday present. Without the dress, they seem bigger, but they’re still not much. Draco’s nipples are standing up, golden hoops glittering in the faint light. He pushes his chest up enticingly, and Harry doesn’t need more invitation.
It isn't actually my fault it took so long to update. My fiance pestered me every day if I have something new for him to correct (he does a quick grammer/spelling check) and I always told him that I hadn't anything finished. So when the day came and I actually had the chapter, I told him right away, but he didn't have time to read it. And the next day I told him again, but still he had no time. And then again and again and again and now we're here.
The voice in his head tells him it’s Malfoy’s blood, that he’s hurt and easy prey. Maybe not as satisfying as if he was uninjured, but enough to quench the bloodthirst that has built in Harry’s veins. His stomach turns in anticipation. With his added height and his bulky muscles he isn’t a weak, malnourished eleven-year-old but a serious predator.
He watches as Draco makes his slow way up, the lead again dangling from his collar and hindering his movements even more. He nearly loses his balance as his hands get tangled up with the soft leather, and the scene is accompanied by moans of intense pain.
He doesn’t get it. Instead, Malfoy sighs, like the burden on his shoulders just doubled. He doesn’t seem surprised in the least.
There's no mirror in here, but Harry’s had enough of self-discovery for the moment, so he leaves without any more explorations. The light has changed since he left the bedroom and now he can see more details. The room is dusty and almost empty. There is only the bed and a nightstand, but no light. The window glass is tinted with grime. There are definitely no house elves here.
At Harry’s nod he pulls out his wand - it’s the Elder Wand, Harry notices - and murmurs something unintelligibly. As soon as he’s done, a familiar whistle echoes through the halls of King’s Cross. Harry’s heard it enough times to know that the Hogwarts Express is about to leave in a few minutes.
The day couldn’t have been more horrible, more devastating, and it still isn’t over. Harry is grimy and sweaty, the evidence of today’s carnage splattered on his robes, but the crimson fabric hides most of the blood. Just as well, because the children are traumatised enough and don’t need to see more of that horrorshow that is just another Tuesday at the office.
They both burst out with laughter and from then on they really hit it off. They avoid talking about the war, naturally, but they talk about everything else. They complain about those ridiculous couples everywhere, about being sick of the sound of smooching and flirting, the overly-sweet things that make their teeth rot. It’s embarrassing listening to them.
The Annual Weasley Picnic is probably the most stressful day of the year - and definitely the best. Harry loves the manic anticipation of his adopted family.
He still blinks owlishly when he’s pulled forward, strong arms closing around him, unforgiving but infinitely gentle. Draco murmurs sweet nothings in his ear, stroking through his hair, oblivious to the grime and dirt.
Sex is an important part of their relationship. Harry fondly remembers the times when they couldn't be bothered to leave the bedroom, content to be wrapped up in each other. Over the years those days got less, naturally, but they still try to find some alone time every now and then.
He is appreciated by his colleagues, has published a number of scientific articles that granted him the respect of other Healers around the world and is frequently consulted about dark curses. He helped countless patients, but still some refuse. It hurts more than Draco likes to admit, but there’s nothing he can do about it.
He opens his eyes when he feels something break in his mind, causing even more pain. His body begs him to pass out, but a painless oblivion isn’t meant for Draco. Instead he looks up to find cold, crimson eyes and a malicious, but very satisfied smile.
“Don’t worry, Dragon, I made it easier for you. See, those are not our usual stairs. If you make it half-way up, I might even have a reward for you.”
It isn’t unusual for wizards and witches to wait a few more years - decades - before procreating. It’s something they have to be sure about, and most people just want to live their life first before being responsible for a child.
He tugs harder on the leash, wanting, needing to get started. Draco hates being led like a dog and Harry has dressed him up like one more than once, but today it’s just for the fun of it. He feels the reluctance in the way Draco moves, and as he looks down, he sees the blush covering the usually white neck. His dragon blushes so beautifully, not only do his cheeks heat up, but his whole upper body. It’s a nice contrast to his milky skin and even after all these years, Harry can’t get enough of it.
His mouth still tastes like crap, but at least the heaving subsided significantly. Draco drops on the couch in their den and snaps his fingers to make the room dark. His magic is unstable at the best of times ever since he has more pain filled days than not, and he’s surprised when the curtains close without causing an incident. He has no idea what time it is, other than it’s day. Did he just get off his shift at St. Mungo’s? Or is he due in a few minutes? It’s all fuzzy in his head, laced with the thorns of agony.
As always, if you find any horrendous mistakes, please let me know. I will correct those mistakes I see after a few days and a little distance, but hmn007 and me hopefully managed to erase them all beforehand.
It comes as a total surprise when the boy is lifted from his arm and given to another of Draco’s colleagues. Harry blinks, having missed the last few minutes and he’s suddenly alone with Draco. He tries to sort his thoughts, to maybe say something, but nothing will come out of his exhausted mind.
“I know it’s not the same, but I charmed the room after the meadow we went for your initiation. Can you feel it?” And Draco can. The magic settles round him, soothes his aching head and awakens the Veela.
He chuckles darkly, and Harry doesn’t follow the thought. They both haven’t mentioned the war and it’s better to let the topic sleep, anyway. Better not to wake those horrid memories. Harry isn’t even sure if Malfoy knows he was connected to Voldemort and saw everything.
Their next kiss is the complete opposite. It’s brutal and forceful, aggressive and so hot, Harry has to suppress his own moan. It would be unwise to show his obvious desire so early into the game. He has made Draco wait, he can do his own sweet time of waiting.
It’s rare for Draco to top outside of his Veela’s heats, but that night, he took Harry again and again and again and in the afterglow Harry finally pulled out the small black ring box and proposed.
“Because you wouldn’t spend time with him if you didn’t think he was.” It comes out as something else entirely, more grunts and moans, but they’ve known each other long enough that Ron understands his sleep-drunken ramblings and Harry is fluent in meal-speech. He thinks about the answer to that, if it’s worth the fight that will inevitably follow, and decides to just shrug. He doesn’t really have anything else. It’s nice to spend time with Malfoy, because, once you know him, he’s a decent bloke. He’s fun to be around, he knows a lot of things other than pureblood crap, and when they went to Spintwitches Sporting Supplies, he didn’t complain once when Harry took almost an hour to compare one pair of Seeker gloves with another. He even gave some helpful advice - it paid off to talk to another Seeker. Ron never had the patience to discuss matters of wearing comfort and the difference between Thestral leather and normal pig leather.
Before the evening is over, the only moans he will hear are ones of exhaustion and he likes both equally fine. But he knows his lover needs a bit of comfort right now. It isn’t easy to lie on the floor for hours, sexually frustrated, being kept in the game with no possibility of relief.
But there is something in the air, something that makes him almost giddy. It could be the spirit of Christmas, which is coming closer with every day, but Harry doesn’t think so. While he’s learned to enjoy Christmas, it’s still nothing that makes him especially excited or gives him sleepless nights. He’s planned on staying at the castle, where he’s sure he can enjoy some quiet days, even if Molly is writing every day to change his mind. He loves his family, he really does, but this year he just doesn’t feel like celebrating much. Maybe it’s the lingering trauma of the war, or maybe Harry is just one of those people who can be content by themselves in the company of silence.
“You did good,” he praises his sub, his thumb wiping away one of the tears. “You did really good, Draco. I’m proud of you. Now, I think I promised to spare you the stairs and you earned it.”
Harry swallows heavily, tears flowing anew, and he can’t help but feel small and hopeless at this moment. He’s about to die, and his only company are the shades of his family and friends. He feels small, powerless, can’t stop the question that comes out of his quaking lips.
Calliope’s shop is one of a kind. It’s located in a back alley of Diagon and has a huge variety of products, both Muggle and wizard alike. There are normal spreader bars or those that can be manipulated with a simple spell. Crimson feather ticklers are in the same shelf as Quick-Tickling Quills, much like the Quick-Quotes Quills. They look for the best places to stimulate all on their own, while you still have both hands free to do something else. Their magic, however, fades quick enough, a lesson Harry and Draco learned after a weekend of fun that ended in an unforgettable laughing fit when the quill wouldn’t stop and had to be destroyed.
The days in the force are long and vicious, blood, death and despair his companions with barely a ray of hope. But Harry has a rule and in his endless years as an Auror, he never strayed from it, no matter how horrible the day.
Draco tries to wriggle out of them without much success, although not for lack of trying. The dress interferes with his jerky movements.
The last week had been exhausting and filled with endless hours of gruesome Auror work. It's a difficult case of human trafficking and the tension that was mounting up all week finally collapsed tonight in a explosion of robes and pants, aggressive kisses and finger-shaped bruises. They both had surely needed it.
Calliope is waiting for them; they have a private session since neither of them wants anything of this in the Prophet. They don’t do this very often. Sometimes Harry just orders things by owl, but today they’re looking for something special.
Harry lets his hands slide over the black metal of the humbler. It was a hard decision which one to pick, since there were so many different ones to choose from, but with a bit of help from Calliope he settled on a plain model. Black, smooth metal, curved like a double s-letter, nothing else. He could have picked something archaic or something vicious-looking, a humbler combined with manacles or fitted with a cage, but he doesn’t need all that. Instead he has requested a series of runes he can change for different purposes. They are carved delicately into the metal, glowing faintly silver in their default setting. They’re for later though, for their first time he wants to take it slow.
A whimper draws him to an expensive-looking couch (a faint voice insists that it's a chaise longue). The green velvet is faded with age, but the gold embroidery gleams in the light almost preternaturally. The pattern is intricate, reminding Harry of the snakes in Myrtle's bathroom, strangely alive for something inanimate. The whimper comes from behind the couch. The fact that it's Harry's own name doesn't register once he sees who cowers there.
Draco would never tell anybody, but he listens to his husband’s voice so often, he can recite the stories in his dreams.
Finally at home, Draco saw Harry’s stag waiting, telling him he would be alone for the rest of the day after an important case had come up. He doesn’t like to be alone, especially not after those demanding days at work, but there isn’t much he can do. Except have a shower to get rid of the hospital stench.
“Sounds like a good plan to me,” Harry agrees enthusiastically and rushes out of the bathroom to get dressed.
It’s not necessary to lock Draco up while he’s alone, but it gives them both a thrill to know that there is only one key and only at one person’s disposal, and it’s not Draco. Despite a recently shattering orgasm, his cock tries to rise at the pictures that form in his head.
“Draco, up you go,” he says, low and dangerous. It only quickens Draco’s heartbeat, and he nearly stumbles over his own feet, so eager to comply.
It was almost by chance that Draco found out that changing to his more primal side soothes the pain for a few days. It also makes him more needy and clingy afterwards, which is why he doesn’t let it out as much as he needs. He only gives into the urge when the pain becomes unbearable, like today, when he woke up with a fierce pounding in his skull. He knows he should see a Healer, headaches this severe and often aren’t common or healthy. But Healers are the worst patients and it’s not like his colleagues would know what is wrong with him.
Draco’s cock is red and wet and swollen. It looks good enough to eat, but this is about Harry, not his lusty dragon. He can finally fulfill his wish, though, and he doesn’t waste time and pushes both straps down Draco’s shoulder. They fall away easily and the dress slips down to his hips.
“Is it like you imagined?” Draco asks, shyly looking down. The heels make him taller than Harry, but his posture is already submissive and he appears smaller, more elegant.
As their lips meet and golden wings close around them like a cocoon of warmth and everlasting love, the sun finally vanishes behind the horizon.
But Draco remembers the day he found out Harry had a disgusting addiction to cinnamon in his coffee and the awkwardness that ensued after the “confession”. Or that one time Draco was so deep in thought that he unexpectedly meowed, and Harry replied, equally confused and intrigued.
“I don’t know.” And he doesn’t, but he also doesn’t care. Sometimes you don’t have to question everything.
He still remembers Molly’s stunned expression, a tell-tale sign she knew how to read his present, but despite her short nod of acknowledgement, she hadn’t made it easy for Draco in the beginning.
“No,” he says, shaking his head, his voice soft and understanding, like Harry’s question isn’t weak and childish. “It’s easy, like going to sleep after a long day.”
And Harry lets himself go, just for a moment, when nothing can reach him inside the safe cocoon that are his husband’s arms.
The deafening clap of thunder interrupts Draco quite suddenly, but he isn’t ready to let it go so fast. Suddenly everything is clear in his mind. With a flick of his wrist he summons some pergament and a self-inking quill. Despite the hammering in his head the words flow out of him, filling page after page as time flies by.
“I’d recommend this one, upper right corner. The grip is firm and has an additional Sticking Charm, to prevent it from slipping, the leather is Abraxan. This one doesn’t have any extras, it’s suited for beginners. If you’re both comfortable, you can upgrade to a more advanced model. Those are similar to the Quick-Tickling Quill, finding the best - or worst - places to give the maximum stimulation and react to individual safe words,” Calliope says, her expression knowing. She’s seen Draco's ritual often enough, stalking the premise until he circles in on the thing he wants.
It’s time to change what’s been going on for months now. Time to stop hurting his family, his friends.
“Oops, sorry,” he says, although they both know he isn’t sorry at all. He leans forward, catching some of the blood with his right thumb. The silver ring gets bloody as well, but it only fills him with satisfaction. He smears the blood over Malfoy’s plump lower lip, pushing and prodding until the split opens again and deepens, causing even more blood. It’s an obscene and violent lipstick, and Harry thinks smugly that it looks good on such a pathetic poof.
They talk Quidditch for some minutes. The Harpies are from another world this season, slaughtering the other teams effortlessly. Ginny on the trainer bench seems to be the best thing that could happen to them and only Merlin knows what will happen next season, when they are all well-practiced.
Harry’s right hand finally settles on his throat, above the leather collar, and he squeezes lightly, just enough to let Draco know who’s in charge of the situation. He’s practically melting into Harry’s broad chest, wishing they were alone and could explore the situation more. The discomfort from sitting on the horse is overshadowed by the rush of lust in his veins.
It’s those memories that keep him sane when he’s faced with death and malice and all the nastiness that still won’t leave his life. And Harry wouldn’t have it any other way.
Suddenly chairs scrape on the floor, signalling that the lesson is over. They scatter apart, and only now Harry becomes aware of how close they’ve come during their short conversation. It’s almost intimate, like they are actual friends putting their heads together to share secrets. He catches Malfoy’s gaze, like he wants to say something and Harry leans back, closing the gap between them. It’s hard to hear him over the rustle of parchment and chattering students, and Malfoy doesn’t make it easier, almost whispering. “If you really want to buy a new jumper, we could meet tomorrow in Hogsmeade. In all honesty, Potter, you really look like you could use some help. I’ll even promise not to be too overbearing.”
“Of course,” Draco says, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, escorting his boyfriend into death. “I would have gone anywhere with you, Harry, forever.”
The room before him is dark, but in the silence of the house every harsh breath and whimper is amplified. Harry has finally found his target. The solid layer of dust makes him almost silent as he approaches, wand at ready. He’s contemplating which hex to use first. There are some deliciously wicked. Curses that peel away parts of the skin - not enough to incapacitate someone but painful enough to make them suffer. Hexes that slash only a few layers of skin and flesh but leave important blood vessels intact. The Cruciatus Curse, basic but effective. He could simply conjure a knife and do everything with his bare hands in any case.
“Dragon,” Harry says and has to try a few times to get Draco’s attention. He stops his thrusts when it’s obvious that Draco is too far gone.
When he went to Hogwarts those fantasies slowly faded into the background. Draco had a House to rule, top grades to get and a certain boy to harass. It all demanded his full attention and there was very rarely the right occasion to visit his old playgrounds.
Of course the war is seared to his brain. He will never forget that moment of stunned silence, right after the Patronus crashed Bill and Fleur's wedding and only a few breaths before panic made them run from the scene.
Grey eyes snap up to him, but they’re not as sharp and calculating as Harry remembers. There’s pain there, making them dull and glazed over. It makes him ache in return, somewhere in a corner of his heart that he wants to rip out immediately after he registers it. It feels wrong to have this reaction to Draco Malfoy, but Harry can’t help it. The house is seriously messing with his mind.
The day he met Draco again was the first day of spring, the first day the sky over London cleared up that year. The first day of the rest of his life, so to speak.
Harry, who has been silent so far, steps forward to run his hands over the horse. Whenever they scene he’s more of a silent type, calm, and measured. He gets into dirty talk enough, but outside of this, he only talks to give precise and simple orders. They’re complete opposites whenever they get kinky. While Harry usually likes to talk, his dominant persona doesn’t. In contrast, Draco can barely keep his mouth shut once they get things going.
“I know,” Malfoy sighs, a desperate and tired sound. “I’ll try to explain as much as I can, maybe it’ll help?”
He needs to start and take charge of himself again. Healing starts with wanting to get better, he tells his own patients so often, most of the long-term residents of the ward fling them back at him with a smirk.
The headaches get worse with every passing month, so bad he sometimes can barely keep his eyes open. On those days, light, no matter how subdued, sends piercing spikes through his brain and makes him sick. He refuses to give into the pain, however; he endured much worse during the war.
Sometimes he is embarrassed by how much he needs and craves this, how much he loves being at his husband’s mercy. That he gets off on pain and humiliation. He’s a slut for rough sex, for degradation or any form of debasement, and he’s the luckiest bloke alive to have a partner that is equally into those things, eager to explore the depth of perversion.
George showing off the crater of his ear, waving around painful memories of Fred to guilt him into breaking up. Harry is still furious with him, despite many apologies and years behind them.
His husband is still sitting straight, almost unnaturally even for him, like he’s waiting to be called every second now. The dress is tight enough to give a hint of what’s hiding underneath, and Harry knows exactly who’s going to fetch them another round of champagne.
It’s all worth in the end, when he sees the little twinkle in Harry’s eyes, the only sign that despite the endless questions and the fretful politicians. Draco knows his husband likes to do his duty and a successful gala is a job well done.
As soon as they get up from their chairs all eyes turn to them. The room quiets almost immediately before hushed murmurs erupt like Fiendfyre all around them, but Harry and Draco brave them as they step around the long table, making their way to the huge empty space in the middle of the room.
“That said, you don’t look too fresh either, so why don’t you lay down for a bit. It will be some time before dinner is ready.”
He tries, but a yelp lets Harry know that the humbler does its work. Draco’s balls are pulled tightly away from his body, held in place by the humbler. Whenever he moves too much - and even the smallest movement is enough - his balls are pulled even farther away. It hurts, plain and simple, an ideal device to ensure only small movements and absolute obedience.
They’re both propped up in fancy garden chairs, courtesy of Draco, who insisted on making them as comfortable as possible. His husband is the biggest mother hen Harry knows, which says a lot, since Molly is serious competition to him, but, being a Healer, Draco knows all the horrible things that can possibly happen. Not that they will or ever did. It’s just extreme precaution that Draco can’t seem to let go.
Harry cards his hands through Draco’s hair, slow and soft as not to wake him. They’re watching Star Wars - Draco’s choice, because he is fascinated with the concept of traveling through space. Despite his obvious interest it took all of thirty minutes before his eyes closed and the soft, regular puffs of breath tell Harry that his husband is asleep.
His good mood isn’t even soured when he messes his potion and it slowly burns a hole through his best jumper before he can get it off. The cauldron is lost, but thankfully someone reacts quickly and vanishes the mess before it can do more damage.
Harry winces at his rudeness. For a second he actually forgot who he’s talking to and that Malfoy is a ticking time bomb on the best of days. Today doesn’t even seem like a bad day, but like the worst day ever. To his surprise, the git only chuckles lightly.
Hours seem to pass by, and Malfoy doesn’t even twitch. It gets boring fast, with nothing to do. He’s surrounded by books, but can’t read. There’s a whole house to explore but he doesn’t want to leave Malfoy alone, a strange sense of duty is keeping him rooted. All he can do is watch the gnarled trees outside. There is no sun, only a homogenous grey sky, an ugly colour devoid of any nuances. There are no leaves flying around, although the trees are whipping in the wind. It’s oddly rhythmical, like the dance of damned souls, luring his mind away from the situation.
He is suddenly bent over, a strong arm supporting his back and then Harry kisses him chastely, the solid press of dry lips against Draco’s own. It’s a promise for tonight, when they will be finally alone, but also for a future together.
is famously strong - they open up to something that seems to be an entrance hall. He’s on top of an impressive staircase that leads down to the ground storey. He sees a huge window that reaches from the bottom to right under the ceiling, equally grimy, but still good enough to see through.
“You know, being Pansy’s gay best friend doesn’t always have its perks. Just last week she got a delivery from France. She pulled me out of Arithmancy, claiming she had something life-threatening to tell me, so Vector let me go. Probably thought the Dark Lord was back with all the ruckus Pansy was making. Anyway, she dragged me to the girl’s dorm only to show me the lingerie she got and ask me which one was the most sexy on her so she could wear it for her date. I had to scrub my eyeballs with Mulpepper’s, but I’m afraid the pictures are seared into my brain.”
There are boots on his feet, heavy and sturdy, shimmering in the pale light. Dragonhide, his mind supplies, but he doesn't know how he knows. He's wearing black jeans that fit surprisingly well. There is a hole in the knee, but it doesn't come from prolonged use.
Draco crawls to the fireplace, too weak to stand properly and summons the Floo powder, silently thanking Merlin for not spilling it or accidentally setting the den on fire.
“Draco, be a dear and get us some drinks. Something light, we want to keep a clear head for the second act.” It’s a promise and they both know it.
When they started dating, Draco thought he needed to buy Harry’s affection. He isn’t proud of it and still cringes in embarrassment when he remembers some of the things he spent his money on. It had taken a stern lecture from Hermione to make him stop, and ever since, she is his confidant whenever he wants to give Harry something important.
More steps echo through the silent forest, and for the first time in years Harry sees his parents again. They hold each other’s hands, identical smiles on their faces, as they step beside Draco. His mother only has eyes for him, but his father puts his other hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco is about to follow when a short but sharp twinge flashes through his skull. It's over in seconds, gives him the feeling of an impending headache that will last for hours. It never actually happens, but Draco is sick of the strange pressure in his skull, never really hurting but also never going away anymore.
So Harry walked the halls, trying to find something to soothe his wounded mind - or at least distract him for a few hours. That day it happened in the form of suppressed sobs, coming from an empty classroom to his left.
“Ha ha,” he replies to the silent challenge, but the longer he thinks about it, the more he can see it is actually funny. Back in fourth year it hadn’t been, not even remotely, when he’d had to fight for his life and the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs had made it their mission to make it even more miserable. But now, after the war, after everything, he can see it as a simple prank, maybe a bit out of line, but not vicious. Not the work of a Death Eater in training, but the doings of a school boy.
“It’s time, Harry,” she says, putting her arms around him, a final hug until they see each other again. It probably won’t be long. “You have been so brave all your life, we are so proud of you. Your father and I loved you from the moment you came into our world, and we will always love you, until the end of times. We couldn’t have wished for a better son.”
His gaze never leaves Draco, not when he pulls off his socks and especially not when he steps out of his pants. Draco swallows with effort, his mouth suddenly dry. His body is reacting like they are still eighteen and not thirty one, his hard-on quick and surprisingly persistent. Sex wasn’t on his agenda, but Draco won’t complain.
Quick end notes: I consulted a "How to" for the nipple piercings. While there is no graphic description, there are some things taken from that guide. In the Muggle world, nipple piercings take about 3 to 6 months to heal (can be up to 12), but that wouldn't have worked with the story and we are in the Wizarding world anyway.
The snitch opens at the press of his lips, just like Harry thought it would. Inside is a familiar ring, small and almost unremarkable if not for the deep gauge left by the sword. The third Hallow, completing the collection and making Harry the Master of Death.
“Anyway, we got sucked in through the door. When I woke up, you were gone. I wandered the halls and found our necromancer - he is dead. I was relieved at first until I realised what he had done before his death.
Malfoy looks at him then, letting his hands fall down, horrified: “Merlin Potter, you look like a heathen! Or like, stuck in Muggle America! You are a public person, you need to maintain a certain standard. Think about what Rita Skeeter would say!” He opens his eyes wide in sarcastic outrage.
They haven’t been to the park since they met there all those years ago, but Draco finds the way easily.
He thanks the clerk, working out the details of delivering everything to Hogwarts, before he turns and says: “Now that we’re done, how about we do something I like?” Malfoy laughs softly, untypically, and just nods, holding the door open for Harry as they leave.
He tries to scream, but his throat is locked up, his body paralysed and his nerve endings fried by the unimaginable torture.
Malfoy’s jumper is torn, separated by what looks like claw marks. There are shallow wounds visible underneath, crisscrossed by old scars. They’re the marks left by Sectumsempra, Harry realises, and that feeling of satisfaction wells up in him again. It’s something he can’t understand; the curse was probably the worst thing he’s ever done. And yet.
But he hates the galas the Ministry holds. They just want to show off their golden boy, their Saviour, and it doesn’t matter if Harry actually likes to be there. His presence is required, since he is not only the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice but also an invaluable asset to the DMLE. It’s bad enough that he has to hold endless speeches about things better left unsaid, ripping the barely healed wounds of the war open again and again. No, the worst thing is that: as Harry’s husband, Draco needs to attend every single one of them.
“Tell me, love, how wet are you? Shall I see for myself? See what a slut you are? Would it bother you that people can watch everything we’re doing? Knowing you, it turns you on even more. I bet you’re desperate to come, aren’t you? What would you do so I’d let you come right here, where everyone can see it? You want to, don’t you?” He’s rambling a bit, but his husband doesn’t seem to care.
Usually Draco likes to dress up. It’s ingrained in the Malfoy blood, the need to present himself, the sense what to wear on what occasion, the impeccable manners that surely aren’t the result of hours and hours of a wasted childhood.
And how can he not, when his husband is the epitome of sex, with his slender built, his soft alabaster skin, his perfect lips that can snarl and smile and suck? With his hands that look so delicate, yet are so strong that they can lift him up and move him around (all within the reasonable time of three seconds, but still)?
He takes in the different ornaments, some are centuries old and some were only acquired over the last few years. There’s clutter everywhere, but they both agree they love it as tacky as it can get. An angel in a colourful crochet dress winks at him, wings flapping in excitement. The ornaments have seen their fair share of special traditions and are getting naughty themselves.
It might not be Harry's own bed, but he isn't worried. It happens from time to time that he stumbles into a different one. He blushes fiercely, glad he's obviously alone. He doesn't want to imagine what Ron would have to say, finding him in a strange bed, beet red. His mate has developed quite the mouth on him ever since he and Hermione broke up. Too many differences, she had said, and Harry could believe that. After the War, many things are different.
There’s silence afterward, except for their heavy breathing. Harry has barely time to open his eyes, when the clapping starts, just a trickle at first before it’s evolving into standing ovations. He’s confused for a second before he realises they managed to finish in time with the opera, and people are cheering on the orchestra and singers.
He brings the dripping fabric to Malfoy’s face, carefully rubbing at the different traces of body fluids. There’s a literal layer of grime, and once it’s gone, Harry flinches. Underneath the filth, Malfoy is deadly pale and littered with bruises.
The prompt really gave me trouble and it took the better part of a week to know what I wanted to write...
Draco’s eyes glow with elation. Harry would like to ravish him right here at their table, but it’s not the time yet. Soon, though. He smiles when Captain Sullivan signals him that they’re about to dock in a few minutes. Time to get this show on the road.
There are other things: the almost manic sarcasm, that badly hides Draco's self-deprecation. He likes to tell people he's their superior, better, stronger, more intelligent. More beautiful. He is, Harry knows, their family knows, their friends. The only one who doesn't know is Draco and he only tells people how much better he is to offend them, not because he means it. To himself, he always seems to be the stupid sixteen year old who did the wrong choices for the right reasons. He never progressed past the self-hatred.
Her blue eyes twinkle with mischief as she tells him that someone is waiting for his consultation at examination room 4.
Another special thanks goes out to the husband (for the regulars: yes, we finally did it), who did his duty and played living puppet whenever I needed to check certain positions, hands and stuff. We both don't have any experience with very small breasts, so hopefully it's not too unrealistic.
Draco turns just in time to see Harry step forward, oblivious to the tomatoes rolling around, crushing one with a squishy sound, seeds, juice and pulp splattering everywhere. He looks confused, his eyes clearly asking why there are tomatoes on the floor, but it doesn’t help the mess that slowly conquers the formerly pristine kitchen.
For all the foreplay they’ve enjoyed this evening, the initial penetration is rushed and artless. Harry uses short but brutal stabs to fuck Draco open enough, then plunges in, burying himself to the hilt. Even the panties aren’t enough to muffle Draco’s scream. Sharp fingernails bite into Harry’s shoulder and both legs wrap around his hips, gravity allowing Draco to sink even further on his cock. The first thrust sends the hair tie flying into the audience, never to be seen again.
Sirius gives him a smile. He looks younger, more content than ever. He looks like moments before he fell through the veil, strong, powerful, capable. So full of himself and of life.
To emphasise his words, Harry pulls at the nipple piercing again, pulling the tit as long as it goes before letting it snap back. It earns him another shudder and an audible moan. Harry pulls the panties out of Draco’s mouth, now completely ruined, and he doesn’t care who hears them. There’s another Portkey ready to take them home as soon as the opera ends.
This is the last chapter of this work. It was meant to be a writing exercise, you know, writing every day about 100 to 1000 words. I thought it was a good idea because I tend to overthink things alot and wanted to make myself just go with the flow, just write away. It's why I don't have this beta read, but merely proof-read by my fiance, and was going lightly on the editing afterwards. It's basically still a raw draft, but it's okay for me and I think some of you enjoyed it.
“potter stinks” glows red and unforgiving back at him. He looks at it, outraged, before he looks back at Malfoy. Despite the words, he doesn’t look malicious. More like playful. Like it really is just a joke, not some insult to start a fight. He grins softly and it transforms his whole face. Instead of looking sharp and pointed, pale and unhealthy, the slight smile gives his face something round that soothes the angles of his cheekbones and his nose. His grey eyes glitter with mirth, almost erasing the slight bruises under them that speak of some sleepless nights. His hair shimmers golden in the warm light of the pub.
“Dragon, you remember our audience from the bar? That bloke that couldn’t get enough of you? You liked how he watched our every move, didn’t you?”
There are potatoes and roast beef, pumpkin juice and pie, carottes râpées, small quiches, madeleines and tarte tatins, treacle tart, custard-filled pastries and other delicious things Harry can’t be bothered to name. With a family as big as theirs, there are influences from all over the world and it reflects on their meals. On the far side is something Romanian. Harry can’t remember the name but he knows Draco will gorge himself with it.
It’s close to winter, almost too cold to visit Battersea Park again, but Draco’s Warming Charms are strong and they acquired more blankets over the years. He packs a basket with some morsels - the wine and chocolate from Tesco actually make an appearance - and off they go.
This year, they are very basic. While the food is on tables, everyone is seated on blankets in the grass, holding onto their plates or simply enjoying the sun.
“It’s alright, Harry.” A ghostly hand settles on his shoulder, firm but not, and Harry finally understands Beedle’s tale. The dead can’t come back, they are always caught in the veil, neither here nor there, as long as the stone calls to them. He’s aware he’s crying, trying to muffle his sobs in case the enemy is near, but he can barely bring himself to care. Not when his love comes to him from beyond the veil, trying to comfort him on his own last journey.
Ron and Hermione are long gone when Draco yawns and stretches his arms, the picture of a graceful if lazy cat. They are still on the sofa in the sitting room; Harry hasn’t dared to move, content with watching his husband’s slumber.
Eventually, Draco pulls the dress up until his panties are revealed. Harry smirks - they’re the exact same colour as the dress with little rhinestones. His husband, the fashion queen.
As he looks through his crimson robe, he finds a bundle with bread rolls, a lot of lint, and a handkerchief. It isn’t his, Harry is pretty sure, because the fabric is soft and stark white, embroidered with a stylised crest: the antlers of a stag encompass three long, colourful feathers. It’s a pity to use it, but it’s the only thing at hand.
It wiggles back and forth in an almost hypnotic rhythm and Harry sees the enchanted buttplug at work. He has set the sequence before he left, when to vibrate and when to thrust and just now it slowly pushes back and forth, changing the angle every so often, eliciting a moan when it hits that special spot inside his wriggling lover.
Harry shudders. He isn’t easily fazed by dirt and finds it even comforting to know that he doesn’t have to clean up as soon as he sees a grain of dust, but this is too much, even for him.
If he would give into his primal urges, he would barely be inside, his wings free and his mate always by his side. It’s almost worth it for the amount of time they would spend connected to each other, fucking like rabbits, only stopping to pop out one half-blood after the other.
Do you know how hard it is working with my fiance? He messes with the words on purpose, because he thinks he's so funny (he is -.-). And then I have to correct it and it's soooo hard.
“I want you to take this potion while I’m gone. It shouldn’t take longer than a week, so I left you seven doses. There are instructions inside the box. I want you to read them and decide if you are willing to take them. When I’m back I’m going to take you out. That is not dependent on you taking the potions, but it will be more fun if you do.”
The Manor lays dark and lifeless behind him as he reaches the crest of the hill. The sun already touches the snow-covered trees of the forest below, a play of red, orange, yellow and purple firing up the sky. It’s peaceful, despite the dark history weighing on the land.
The blindfold is damp, soaked by tears of frustration and it conjures a smile on Harry’s face. All these years and he can still elicit this kind of reaction with a bit of prolonged foreplay. But he doesn’t need the blindfold now, and he pulls it away.
Buried under his favourite woollen blanket, his thought drift off to a sunnier place with palms and a soft breeze ruffling his hair. Fergus greets him, explaining that Princess Lillian misses her golden circlet and they need Draco’s help to retrieve it.
When they’re out, he’s is immaculate, not one hair out of place, his clothes impeccable. Since they’re together Draco has gained some weight, not much, just enough to smooth out his pointy face. Secretly he likes Draco more like this. Harry loved him when they were fresh out of school and he loves him even more now, years later.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts like a bitch, his muscles scream at him like he’s just run a marathon, and his throat is parched like he hasn't had anything to drink in days. Despite all that, he's relatively comfortable. He isn't in his own bed in the eighth year dorm, but the mattress is soft and the blankets warm. Through the curtains falls soft, dim light typical for a winter day in Scotland.
Needless to say that, while he wouldn't embarrass himself in front of all people by crying his eyes out, Draco soon excused himself from the mass of well wishers to quietly break down in a bathroom. Of course, Harry found him and that had been even more embarrassing than a crying fit in front of everyone.
He’s never been so calm, so serene. Systematically his mind separates itself from the burden of living: he doesn’t feel his legs moving or the twigs that crack under his heel. He doesn’t feel his heart beating away, or his breath catching in his throat. He only feels the light touches on his arm and shoulders. He only feels Draco’s hand in his.
A strap of the leather harness prevents the plug from falling out and it obscenely dents when the plug goes back only to plunge back in a second later. Another moan goes straight to Harry’s groin and he feels himself harden. The feeling is familiar, the anticipation rising, but he denies himself for just a few more minutes.
