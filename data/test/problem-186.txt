Draco turns away. His eyes straying to the window above the sink overlooking the albino peacocks. He can’t deny the tug in his gut for Potter. The man is ridiculously handsome… kind… generous… he puts so much effort into Scorpius. A small twinge of hope blossoms and he thinks that maybe – just maybe Harry
“Mr. Harry?” Scorpius looks up excitedly and jumps up and down pulling on Draco’s jumper. “Can we see Mr. Harry today, mom? Please, please, pleeeaaseee!!”
“Uh-huh,” He can practically see Scorpius nodding. “They will. They keep him warm. Grandma and Grandpa say his heart is too cold… it’s-,”
“But-,”
love her gossip. “Tell me everything!” She clasps her hands together.
Unconsciously, he reaches up and brushes a few strands out of Harry’s eyes. “Honestly, Potter.”
“No.” His resolute tone has Harry snapping his mouth shut. Scorpius holds up his wrist revealing a metal cuff. “I did somefing I’m not supposed to. I switched them.”
His name across the back is untidy and messy and it’s only his last name. He frowns. It couldn’t be, could it?
There’s a long tense silence and Blaise shifts uncomfortably across from him. “Dray, it’s different now.” He murmurs. “I realize how stupid I’ve been-,”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I did
if you think the Bulgaria stands a chance against Ireland!”
“Shhh…” Harry holds his head to his neck and runs his fingers through his hair. “It’s okay. Draco, I promise it’s okay.”
Malfoy glances at Harry and blushes. “I don’t think so, darling. Mr. Potter is very busy.”
Malfoys. Mal. Foys. You really want to pretend what I’m wearing doesn’t matter?”
Draco blushes. “I think it tastes better that way. Besides, if Scorpius brings a muggle friend over from school, I have to make sure I don’t get caught doing wizard things.”
“Were you trying to kill yourself?”
He flounders. Fuck, they didn’t plan for this. “I-,”
Harry jumps off the desk. “Right, right. I’ll be on my way.”
He rips open his drawer again and rummages for a scrap of parchment and a quill. He writes a rather long letter to Slughorn and details all of Draco’s symptoms and some of Harry’s theories, of course leaving out the blonde’s name, and heads to the reception desk with the Auror’s Owl, Heliador. He sends off the letter and tucks the case folder under his arm and heads to The Curse Breaker’s floor.
“Mr. Malfoy?” A curse breaker, presumably Roger Griffin pokes his head out from the door.
Draco’s heart is thumping wildly in his chest. “Meaning?”
Draco often wonders how he gets himself into these situations. He likes to think that despite the war, he’s been a good man, a good father, a good friend, a good citizen. He takes another blow to the face and his head spins all over again.
He sways and Potter steadies him. “Come on, Malfoy. Let me help you inside.” He grabs Draco’s arm and throws it over his shoulder wrapping a warm calloused hand on Draco’s waist.
Scorpius gives him a proud look. “Because he does mom things.” He holds out his hand to count them off. “He tucks me in at night and reads me stories, he kisses my owies, he fixes my hair and makes me wear fancy clothes, he gives me snacks and he gives me baths… and he’s pretty.”
His face screws up and he hunches forward, crumpling in Harry’s embrace because what the actual fuck is happening right now? He feels tears pool at the corners of his eyes and let’s out a small sob. In an instant, Harry has him turned around and removes the mug and spoon from his hands and wraps him in an even tighter frontal hug. “Harry. I-I don’t know what’s come over me – I – I’m sorry. I can’t stop crying.”
Okay so that’s not entirely fair, it
When they arrive at the Manor, Scorpius is quick to grab Teddy’s hand and introduce him to Narcissa and Lucius. When he spots Andromeda, he hides slightly behind Teddy when he spots her, and Harry is quick to scoop him up and attach him to his hip. “Andromeda, this is my best friend, Scorpius.”
Merlin his voice sounds so weak. He feels another pain and he groans dropping his forehead to Potter’s chest. “Fuck. Let’s get you to St. Mungo’s.”
He glances over at Harry, only to find him watching the same scene. “Thank you for this, Potter – Harry.” He smiles warmly at his son. “Scorpius doesn’t really get to experience a lot in the wizarding world, and for him to get to be with some of his family that loves and accepts him… I just-,” His throat tightens and he looks down at his skates. “Thank you.” He whispers.
Well, whatever it is, he’s sure to find out at dinner. Hopefully, it’s interesting. He runs a hand through his hair, slightly musing it.
He winces down in pain, the hard cement floor digging into his skin. Fuck, Scorpius. He feebly reaches for the cuff around his wrist and pulls it to his chest. He’s leaving his son fatherless, but maybe it’s better this way. He shivers and his body drops ten degrees again.
Ron lets out a snort. “Please, mate. You were glued to your celly and you had googoo eyes for him all night when you did the face call.”
sound like Blaise wants to help Draco with… whatever is going on.
Quintin nods. “Yeah I thought -,”
Harry nearly drops the Prophet he’s holding up because –
He disappears into the other room leaving Draco and Potter alone. “This is um-,”
Neville starts talking to him animatedly about his position as the new Herbology Professor at Hogwarts. As he continues talking, Dean, Seamus and Ron trickle into the Cantina. Ron laments about how terrible Hermione’s second pregnancy is going –
Scorpius gives him a serious look and brings a hand to his forehead in a solute. “Aye Aye Captain Mom!” He glances at Harry and gives him a little nudge with his elbow. “You gotsa do it to!” He says out of the corner of his mouth.
Draco froze.
He can tell Potter is talking loudly above a bar, but probably also so McLaggen can hear him – which is seeming to work as Cormac looks on in surprise.
His godson snorts. “Are you kidding? He
“Zabini, mate you’re absolutely
“I have a bone to pick with you.” Harry’s frown deepens.
“Harry Potter?”
“Well let’s start with breakfast. Let me wash my hands, and Scorpius you go wash up too.”
Scorp rubs his face on Harry’s chest. “Thank you, Mr. Harry.” He sets Scorpius on his knee, his back against his chest and grabs the book.
Scorpius nods against him, and a throat clearing catches their attention. A tall lean doctor with strawberry blonde hair adjusts his glasses as he looks over his clipboard. “Hello, Mr. Malfoy. Can I have a word with you in private?” He looks up.
He’s going to absolutely kill Pansy. Tax accountants are every bit as boring as Draco feared. He quietly unlocks the door to his small two story brownstone flat. He flicks his gaze up to the too loud ticking clock and frowns. Merlin, you know it’s a bad date when you’re home by ten. He quietly toes off his shoes, and hangs up his thick coat.
“You want me to ice skate?” He chuckles nervously. “I-I’ve never skated before.”
and grabs a mug from the cupboard. Harry Potter is in his fucking kitchen, making waffles. He keeps his back to Harry, busying himself in the fridge searching for creamer. He’s standing at the counter, the silence between the two of them… comfortable when he feels too arms wrap around his middle and a forehead rest on his shoulder. He tenses instantly, clutching the mug in one hand, the handle of the stirring spoon in the other. He holds his breath.
Draco’s phone chimes and he welcomes the brief distraction. “Just a sec-,” He stalls as he pulls out his phone and tries to make the immediate text in front of him seem important. He nearly breaks his concentrated façade when he sees a picture of him standing beside Dean, clearly trying to be as tall as he can, despite being almost a full head smaller. He’s holding his arm out next to Dean’s.
“Hello Miss Vera!” Scorpius smiles at the plump brunette woman standing behind the counter.
He clears his throat and blushes furiously, the image of a perfect Draco Malfoy seared into his brain. “N-nothing. Nothing it’s fine.”
Merlin, he’s being so petty right now. He hears voices coming from the Slytherin’s office and he stutters to a stop. Should he turn back now? He doesn’t want to be rude, but maybe someone being in there will make this quick. He puts his hand on the doorknob and freezes, his heart leaping to his throat.
“Careful now.” He hears Harry help Scorpius off whatever he’s standing on and he can hear the small child reaching for utensils. “Mr. Harry? What’s the opposite of friends?”
Draco swallows nervously and Harry presses his shoulder against him comfortingly. “Thank you, Aunt Andromeda.”
Blaise starts to speak, but Lucius interrupts him, his voice cool and collected as ever.
Draco flares up red at his son’s curious gaze and clears his throat. “Yes, we’re fine!”
Draco falls asleep to the rise and fall of Harry’s chest and the calloused fingers running through his scalp.
Draco cocks an eyebrow. “Potter, I don’t live there anymore. I have a flat a few blocks from here.”
“Mr. Harry!” The small blonde crumples and rushes forward, wrapping his body around Harry and breaking out into an immediate sob. He’s babbling incoherently and gasping for air.
She frowns. “It’s good to see you too Draco, but – tell my why Blaise was pitching a fit in my living room on Saturday night.” She huffs impatiently. “Scoot back, I’m coming through.” He sighs and throws himself in an arm chair casting a wordless warming charm. Pansy appears a moment later in an immaculate cream turtle neck dress stopping just above her knees. She’s got high boots on over a pair of patterned tights. She throws herself in the chair beside him and tucks back a chunk of her short black hair. “So spill, Draco honey. What happened?”
Blaise hums as he hands Harry the sheet. “I find that I prefer for people not to…
Theo lets out a loud laugh catching Harry’s attention again. “Merlin, how the hell did you talk him into that?”
And that brings him to problem number two. He really needs to figure out what’s going on with Draco and if he’s cursed, well – Blaise is the right person to ask.
He cocks an eyebrow.
Damn, does Draco wish he could hear that…
“Hey Scorpius,” The kid opens the book and looks back up at Harry.
He moves back to the manor after that, not wanting to inconvenience Pansy any longer, but acknowledging that he needs help. She does protest profusely.
Lucius cocks an eyebrow. “Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter having lunch?” He lets out a thoughtful hum. “Hell must be freezing over.” He follows Harry to the door, grabbing his coat off the rack. “Perfect for me. I prefer the cold.”
Scorpius has his parents, all his friends.
It’s during Scorpius’ first birthday – a small affair involving his parents and his friends - that his mother intervenes.
She shrugs and looks away. “You were still trying to piece yourself back together, and we didn’t want to say anything to remind you of – well everything.” He sits back on the couch trying to process her words. “Harry, he sent me a gift – that knitted blanket that Rose always has a death grip on. And just the other day well… I-I guess you mentioned something to him about how I’m still feeling ill and he concocted a morning sickness potion - it’s why I feel so much better.” There’s a long drawn out pause before she adds, “I’m just saying. Draco really is different. It wouldn’t be impossible for you to fall in love with him. And it’s unfair to say you haven’t known each other long enough. I mean - you’ve been obsessed with each other for over a decade.”
“Actually, I thought something of
The phone rings a second later and Scorpius reaches out pressing the screen when Potter’s face appears in frame. Draco’s heart thuds. He can see him and Scorpius a dark blur in the setting sunlight. He grabs his wand and illuminates their faces with a quick lumos. “Mr. Harry!” Scorpius squeals.
to love and be loved. He’s always been good at potions.
“Or something.” She mutters. “What do you want? Other than taking my darling best friend Draco Malfoy from behind-,”
would look better on you.”
There’s a light chuckle on speaker and he relaxes a bit. “
He’s checking himself in the mirror and can’t help but agree. He’s wearing an emerald green sweater with a Slytherin house symbol on the front that’s slightly too big and has him rolling up the sleeves at the wrists. Merlin, he drowns in everything he puts on. He’s got a pair of gray heathered chinos and a black pair of snow boots. There’s a chime at the floo and Scorpius lets out an excited squeal.
“Fuck you’re cold.” Harry pulls Draco up by his wrists and envelopes him in a tight hug. He lets out a hiss and Draco knows it’s probably like hugging an ice cube. He threads one hand in Draco’s hair and pulls him flush against him. “Care to tell me what’s going on?” He murmurs in his ear.
They continue small talk to the outskirts of the park and Draco’s eyes widen. It’s been quite awhile since he’s been to the park, at least four months or so and he had no idea it could like this. There are white round lights strung up between the trees and little stalls scattered around with sweet treats and vendors. There’s a live band playing on a small stage and a manmade ice skating rink. He lets out a small gasp, Christmas music flooding his ears.
“What about you?”
He thinks bitterly. He pushes open the door to the sitting room rubbing tiredly at his eyes. “Honestly Pansy, I appreciate the effort, but good Merlin, I didn’t realize how fucking boring muggle jobs are. Who knew handling money was every bit as boring as it sounds? Merlin, if I had known that dating was going to be this horrible, I would have just become a monk or something.” He spits sarcastically. He turns around and tosses off his waist coat on the chair sighing heavily. “I don’t know how deep you are into the wine, Pans, but pour me a glass, would you?”
“Boring.” Harry finishes. He fishes out his wand conjuring a menu catalog. “Let’s get something to eat then.”
Harry frowns and a twinge of jealousy hits his gut.
He frowns as he stirs the concoction in front of him. He’s already made the mistake of trying to live a normal life walking through Diagon Alley, only to get his arse beaten within an inch of his life. Thank Merlin he didn’t’ have Scorpius with him.
The two boys let out small giggles and he fights his own smile when he sees Scorpius laugh into his hand. Teddy smirks. “Harry’s quite the gentleman, dontcha think?”
gonna hurt your mom.” He grabs Scorpius underneath the arms and sets him on his lap to get a proper look at him. “And I
Malfoy. He shivers involuntarily against the cold sweeping through his veins and he shakes his head.
Draco chuckles, not bothering to fight the smile on his cheeks. “Very, Scorpius.” He reaches down and taps him on the tip of his nose. “Are you excited to meet your cousin Teddy?”
Potter laughs. “Why did you just have a salad?”
It's a short chapter, but I wanted to get something out there before their playdate next chapter (:
Draco Malfoy has never been a fan of conflict. He prefers to stay on the outside, maybe poke the beast, but ultimately he lets others fight his battles. Hell, if he’s honest with himself – his one and only confrontation he set out to do alone - he failed.
Harry’s stomach drops. “What are you talking about Scorp?”
Of course, he did. Harry fiddles with his Gryffindor ring on his middle finger. Because he’s bloody perfect, and kind, and sweet, and beautiful, and unfairly sexy –
He swallows and takes a sip of his coffee. “Yeah, yeah, yeah…” He finishes the last bite of his donut and tosses the napkin in the trashcan before jumping up on Blaise’s desk. “So, you figure out that curse for me, yet?”
He leans back in his chair. “No, it’s not that… I just – I’ve been at it for almost ten years now, you know? Can’t help but feel like maybe I need something a little less…
The truth is, no one will ever want to be with a death eater. He’s unlovable. And quite possibly doesn’t know how to love. He pulls his knees up to his chest. He wishes he didn’t feel this way. Wishes he didn’t
“McLaggen?” Seamus asks around a mouthful of chips. “It’s funny that you mentioned him. I had lunch with him a couple weeks ago. He’s getting divorced, did you know?”
There’s a tense pause.
In a moment there’s a crack in the air, and a sudden wave of magic nearly punches the breath out of Draco.
His mouth drops. “I- what? Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Potter.”
Draco laughs and pulls Scorpius away holding his cheeks in return. “I’m okay.” He bumps their foreheads together. “Did you have fun with grandma and grandpa?”
would appreciate a good seeker.”
Dean shrugs. “Didn’t seem to broken up about it though. In fact, Seamus says he uses it as a started to catch dates.”
He shakes his head. “No, no.” He clears his throat and strides to the desk. “I’m actually looking for Blaise – ah Zabini.”
Part of Potter’s resolve breaks and he surges forward. For a second, Draco’s positive that he’s going to kiss him, but then Harry is pulling the blonde, flush against his side and wrapping an arm around him. Draco’s head drops to Harry’s shoulder and he tenses up. Harry’s hand is running through Draco’s locks and the opposite one taking his hand in his and running his thumbs against his knuckles.
Harry’s checks his reflection several times. He’s kept his look casual – Hermione always reminds him that it suits him best. He’s wearing a black Hogwarts Alumni shirt with a small crest sitting over his heart and the back reads Gryffindor in maroon. He’s layered it with a navy and gray checkered flannel and a zip up hoodie thrown over that. He’s got on light denim jeans with a few sporadic holes in them, finishing off his look with a pair of navy slip on Vans. He tosses back his hair – it might be time to get a haircut – and adjust his square rimmed glasses. He’s been wearing the pair for the past few years, but he can’t help but miss the round frames… just slightly.
He reaches for Harry’s hand and gives it a firm tug. “I wanna show you stuff!”
“Please call me Narcissa.” She smiles warmly and he returns it.
Scorpius hesitates before flashing Potter a smile and letting out a small squeal giggling into Draco’s side. Potter sits back, throwing his head back in laughter. “He’s adorable and Merlin, he looks just like you. I have to ask though, why does he call you mom?”
“Oh!” Seamus jumps and wobbles on his stool. “In fact you’ll never believe who he’s trying to shag right now!” He leans forward, and Harry thinks the man might be slightly more intoxicated than he let on. “Draco Malfoy!” He jumps in his seat and nearly falls.
“Yes, he is.” He glances down at his watch. “I should probably get him home.” He grunts as he stands, pushing in his chair with one hand.
him now.” And fuck, Draco’s stomach is filled with golden snitches that he’s pretty sure are trying to fly out of his mouth. “And I will do everything in my power to protect you guys.”
He stares at his phone because really it’s been like six minutes and that’s just a rude amount of time to make someone wait for a text message.
“My what manners!” Andromeda swoons taking his small hand. “You raised him well, Draco.”
His first night in the manor, as he holds Scorpius to his chest, arms squeezing just a bit harder – his heart breaks again. He thinks about what Potter said – how horrible it is to grow up without parents. He doesn’t want that for Scorpius, doesn’t want him to feel empty… abandoned and he vows right then and there to love his son as hard as much as he possibly can.
“I – uh –,” He sees Harry’s confidence slip for a second and he finds himself answering with an abrupt, “Yes.”
When he thinks about coming home at night… Scorpius wrapping his frame around his legs in a bug hug. Teddy rushing down the stairs, home from Hogwarts…
Scorpius.” He shrugs. “I think you should go for it.”
She concedes. “Fair point. Lucius is quite the snob. Wand some outfits then. Let me see them.” He goes through a few before she finally settles on a charcoal gray Henley that accents his physique and a pair of black fitted jeans. She has him find his best and cleanest pair of trainers, that have just a pop of red in them. “What about your hair, Potter? As a stylist – I have to be honest, it drives me absolutely mad. Run a brush through it or something.”
It’s tense at first… uncomfortable, but his parents are…
Draco lounging in a comfy armchair with a book in his lap.
Draco places his hands on Scorpius’ cheeks, bringing their forehead together. “Yes, I am. Everything will be fine.”
The walls are painted a stone gray and besides a few black filing cabinets, the black desk he’s sitting on and one black waiting chair the office is cold and uninviting. “Nice office…” He mutters against the rim of his disposable coffee cup.
Scorpius has his arms wrapped around Harry’s own and he’s looking up at him with silver questioning eyes. “What’s up Scorp?”
Harry’s blood runs cold and he barely registers that they’re moving to a booth for Seamus’ safety according to Dean.
” He sees a look of shock cross Potter’s face but doesn’t have time to elaborate any further before the side door opens and a small blur comes rushing towards him.
Draco can only nod and decides to maybe finish his burger a little more –
He groans.
“Are you still going on about him?”
Draco smooths out his crisp shirt, the warm air from the fire place warming his skin. “Yes well – probably a good call, Potter.” He grimaces. “I’ve known Goyle a long time. A Goyle emergency could be anything from spelling something for him to some weird sexual act.”
– he’s in the kitchen in the manor cooking Scorpius breakfast when his vision blacks and he faints, body hitting the floor. He distantly hears Scorpius call his name, his mother scream and he feels… numb.
“Hey Scorpius,” He looks up at Harry with watery eyes. “I’d love to go to the bookstore with you guys.” He glances at his watch. “I really should be going. Can you owl me the details, Malfoy?”
Draco swallows a lump in his throat. “It’s complicated.”
“Were you and my mom friends at Hogwarts?”
Harry shoulders him. “Shut up, Malfoy. Do you want help or not?”
“Draco-,” He starts to stand and the blonde holds out a hand to stop him.
can help
Draco sits on the couch across from him, smirking. “Mother’s a doterr. She’s not going to let you leave until she’s positive you’ve had enough to eat and enough tea to fight the cold.”
She throws her head back and laughs slapping lightly on his arm. She looks up and catches Draco, “Oh hello again, Mr. Malfoy. Did you have another appointment today?”
“Walking?” Draco sets Scorpius down, kneeling down and buttoning up his son’s peacoat. “From here?” He rises to his feet and is surprised when he sees Harry standing behind him, his own black peacoat held open for him. He fights a blush and clears his throat, sliding into his winter coat. “Thank you, Harry.”
it’s ready. It’s cold in the small bottle in his hand and he clenches it tightly, a small flicker of doubt.
He shrugs. “I like it. I also like that he calls you mom. It’s sort of cute.” Draco looks down to hide his blush. “Anyway, you need any help?”
“Including giving mom hugs?”
Hermione pulls away and adjusts his messy hair. “Oh Harry,” She sighs and she moves away, letting out a small groan as she sits back in her chair. “You shouldn’t be so oblivious. You and Malfoy have obviously had something between you all these years.”
He puts the phone back on his ear.
Harry meets his gaze, a confident smirk on his face. “Wouldn’t dream of it, Malfoy.”
Harry grumpily stuffs his phone into his pocket.
“Yeah! But-,” He gives Draco a shy look. “I don’t think my mom did.” He can hear Harry’s booming laughter on the other side of the line and he rolls his eyes. He practically melts though when he hears Scorpius join in. The sound of the two of them laughing together is just… perfect. “Can we see you tonight, Mr. Harry?”
my weekend.” He places his elbows on the table and folds his hands together. “Of course, you know that.” He winks.
Malfoy stands up straight and clears his throat. “Right then. I’ll be done at twelve. Scorp wanted to show you around for a bit and then we’ll grab lunch. Sound good?”
Draco eyes the already full coffee pot –
” He whispers.
“Hm?”
He sighs. “Darling, we have to get home and get you cleaned up first. You’re filthy! Then we’ll have dinner-,”
“Of course.” Malfoy flashes him a quick smile before turning back to Scorpius. “Go with grandma and grandpa, darling. It’ll only take a second.” Scorpius looks hesitant and he gives him a little tap on the nose. “Go on.”
“He should have been home by now.”
“Mom!” Scorpius comes running back and throws himself in Draco’s lap. “Grandpa and I fed the peacocks. I-,” He notices Potter and his eyes widen. He quickly scrambles and sits himself tucked into Draco’s side, eyeing Potter out of the corner of his eye.
“Scorp?”
Draco’s heart is thudding in his chest, the feeling raw and uncomfortable because this is exactly why he froze it over in the first place. His skin feels eerily cold and he hopes to any higher power that he doesn’t pass out in front of McLaggen. He’d rather die than let the boring bloke play hero for him.
He nods. “Yeah, it’s close to the bookstore and to Scorp’s muggle school.” He shrugs and readjusts the small child. “And we can always use the floo network to get to and from Diagon, the daycare and the manor.”
Scorp’s voice rings in his ears and he clenches his jaw.
“I don’t wanna go yet,” Scorpius crosses his arms and pouts. “And I’m
“Yes sir!” Scorpius salutes excitedly.
Draco nods and a moment later he feels the same pull at his navel, spiraling until a second later his feet hit the doorstep outside the manor. He pulls out of Potter’s grasp and smooths out his clothes. “Thank you, Potter.”
She raises a perfectly plucked eyebrow. “Honestly Draco, I’ve perfected lying to the opposite sex and I can tell that you’re lying to me. So tell me what happened.” Draco looks down at his hands folded in his lap. “The way Blaise says it, he wanted to get back together with you and you said no.”
A margarita plops down in front of him and Neville takes a generous sip. “Long day at work. The kids at the school are already checked out. It’s hard to want to learn when Christmas is around the corner you know?” He chuckles, “Reminds me of when we were there…”
He hesitantly returns the smile. “Okay.” He sighs and runs a hand through his messy hair. “Alright, I better go. I’ve gotta do some Christmas shopping in Diagon Alley.”
The rest of their lunch goes with small talk about work, Scorpius, Draco, marriage and fuck it’s weird to hear Lucius talk so beautifully about his wife.
“We get to see Mr. Harry today! We get to see Mr. Harry today!” Scorpius is walking away from his muggle kindergarten, one hand clasped in Draco’s and the other swinging his small backpack beside him. “Are you excited, mom?”
Scorpius nods and looks at Malfoy who’s currently talking to an older woman behind the counter. “Yes, he’s very pretty. Mr. McLaggen thinks so.”
Harry flashes them a cocky grin. “No. But I think
“You too!” The man takes a seat next to Draco.
There’s a tense moment of silence as it takes a second to register to the other three men before they’re throwing out congratulations and an indignant-
“I-,” Draco flounders. “I squeezed it too hard-,”
He unfurls the letter.
“Sorry Cormac, you were saying.”
“Morning Harry. You’re… chipper.” He comments as he throws himself in a dining chair.
He lets out a laugh and eyes the text apprehensively.
“Harry…”
Blaise gives him a pleading look. “But, Dray. I can be there for you-,”
“Oh like you were five years ago?” He snaps and crosses his arms looking away. “Scorpius and I don’t need that kind of instability in our lives.”
“Um. Just a second.” He shoots off one last text to Potter. “So, um, how are you?”
Harry cocks an eyebrow, his heart thudding his chest. “Obviously?”
Harry doesn’t even acknowledge him leave because
“It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”
It’s about a fifteen minute walk from Draco’s flat to the park they’re going to. Teddy and Scorpius are walking side by side, the older boy bent down talking animatedly to the small blonde. Draco insisted on beanie and gloves for the both of them.
Draco splutters slightly. “Oh – ah – I really should get Scorp home-,”
“How long ago?”
Draco looks up and rolls his eyes. “Merlin, you’re such a Gryffindor. Must you always play hero?”
“Draco?” He snaps his gaze to Harry. The brunette gently removes the beer from his grip and takes his hands. “Breathe,” He squeezes. “Come on.” Draco nods and they let out a few breaths in and out together. “There we go.” He rubs a thumb over the inside of Draco’s wrist. “I lost you there for a second. Are you alright?”
“Yes well.” She fidgets, the way she does when she has bad news for him and his heart drops. “He sort of apologized to me.”
He taps the side of his phone absentmindedly before adding,
He clenches his fists above the bedsheets. “Five years ago.”
Harry cocks an eyebrow. “Wondering what?”
“I can physically feel you getting colder.” He still hasn’t lifted his head and Draco can’t decide if he likes the feel of Harry’s warm breath on his back or if he wants to be as far the fuck away from it as he can be.
He snaps his eyes open meeting a strong chiseled chest beneath a maroon jumper. He slowly lifts his gaze up and meets the eyes of a familiar pair of shockingly green eyes and a pair of black square rimmed glasses. His first thought is a faint feeling of disappointment at the loss of round metal glasses. “P-Potter?”
If Blaise already knows about Draco, and Harry starts asking questions – even if he’s as tactful and hypothetical as he can be, the bloke will certainly catch on that Harry is talking about Draco and just feels like it will be…
“Ron had to swing by his place and drop off dinner for Hermione. She’s having a rough pregnancy this time.” He chuckles. “I’m actually surprised she’s letting Ron out, you know?” He sips at his beer. “You’re here early.”
Fuck he
how long it’s been since he’s been on a fucking date. He checks his reflection one more time – simple white button up, steel gray waist coat and a pair of form fitting black pants. He shifts on his feet, frowning slightly.
Draco lets Harry’s warmth consume him as he’s pressed against his chest on a dirty alley floor before his eyes slip shut and the exhaustion settles in.
“Wh-What happened?” His voice is hoarse and he swallows thickly. His mother, bless her, conjures a glass of water which he guzzles gratefully. He hears a small beep and he realizes he’s in St. Mungo’s.
. His mother is all too thrilled to have Scorpius in the house.
“Yes sir!” He says dutifully. There’s some more movement which must be Harry searching for something through his cupboards before Socrpius speaks again. “Mr. Harry?”
The other man snorts. “What are you a little Death Eater buddy of his?”
He takes a deep bracing breath as he enters the Curse Breaking Department at the Ministry. He scans the room and notices that thankfully no one is in the waiting room. The same witch from yesterday is sitting behind a desk and a stocky tanned, bloke with – yup that is quite literally bulging muscles – is leaning over it saying something flirty by the looks of it.
Draco rolls his eyes and feels himself warm slightly at the sound of Potter calling him love. “Alright, we’ll be on our way. Let me say a quick goodbye to Cormac.”
this afternoon. He pushes the thought as far away as he can and flashes him a smile. “Malfoy.”
“Yes.” He checks the box with a quill.
He hears Scorpius yell excitedly beside him. “Mom! It’s beautiful!”
as possible, but he’s heard he’s got cousins – Scorpius and Draco you know…” His heart flutters at the mention of Draco’s name. “Teddy would like to meet them, and I – I’d like to reconnect with Cissy. I know it’s a lot to ask Harry but-,”
“Are you kidding?!” He stands up and begins pacing the room, running his hand through his hair. “How can you say that? He was so terrible to you – to Ron – to everyone-,”
A moment later, Draco is staring at a way too close up version of Dean, Seamus, Ron and Neville. They blink several times at each other.
Draco’s throat runs dry and he’s saved the chance to respond when a waiter clears their dishes. He clears his throat. “Um. Thank you for lunch.”
Well if it wasn’t obvious where the posh way that Draco carries himself comes from, it is now. “If my son hasn’t shared what’s going on with you. I will not disrespect him by going against his wishes as well.” Harry deflates. “However,” He places his glass back on the table. “I also know you’re the only one who can save my son.”
But an hour later when they’re curled up on a couch by a warm fire place in the coffee shop next door, Draco can’t bring himself to care. It’s near Scorp’s bed time and he’s curled in Harry’s lap, head resting on  his chest, his eyes drooping slightly and Teddy has taken splendidly to Draco, sitting beside him, resting his head on his shoulder discussing potions - and fuck does it twist in a wonderful way in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
“It’s complicated.” He swallows thickly. “You’ll just have to trust me. I need some time to myself. Teddy is at Andromeda’s this weekend.” He lets a smile cross his face. “I think she’s trying to soak up as much time with him as she can before he starts Hogwarts.”
“I wanna talk to him! I wanna talk to him!” Draco scoops up Scorpius and places him on his hip continuing to walk down the park and towards the nearest floo.
time, right?”
Draco nods against his neck and gathers himself together because he probably only has a moment to piece it together before Scorpius returns. Harry pulls him away to look at him and runs his thumbs across Draco’s cheeks, wiping the remainder of his tears. “I want you to tell me when you’re ready.” He pauses, hands grasping Draco’s shoulders. “Can I ask why you won’t?”
He hastily folds the parchment back up and stuffs it in his desk. “Shut up.” He neutralizes his expression. “Let me write back and I’ll take a break and we can sit for tea.”
Harry smirks. “I’m going to ignore whatever the hell is going on between you two, and just thank you guys for the advice.”
She gives him a small hug. “Any time, Harry. Come back soon.” Lucius nods to him as Narcissa loops her arm through his and sweeps him into the house with her, leaving Malfoy and Scorpius at the doorstep with him. Harry squats down and taps Scorpius on the nose. “Thank you, Scorp.” He lifts up the small tentacula succulent. “This is the
“Fuck…” He scrubs a hand down his face. He stops at the bottom of the stairs and sighs heavily. He freezes when he hears voices coming from the kitchen. Scorpius squeals excitedly, making a bunch of movement in the kitchen. He stops at the end of the hall, when a deeper voice catches his attention.
1. There are iphones. Just let there be iphones even if the timeline isn't exact.
“Okay, mom!” He leaps excitedly off Draco’s lap.
“Can I go play?” He points to the playground and Draco nods. “Yes, but stay where I can see you.” He reaches into his pocket and clasps a small bracelet around Scorp’s wrist. It’s one of his own inventions – something that alerts him if Scorpius is afraid or if he strays too far away.
Potter sets down his tea cup. “Don’t even get me started.”
Blaise’s voice interrupts their conversation. “What the actual fuck is happening right now?” He drops into his chair. “You guys are – are joking – or – like – why aren’t you murdering each other right now?”
He freezes and sits up.
Merlin, did Teddy hope so.
Malfoy flushes and turns away. “I just – I just mean you helped me back today, that can’t be easy.” He clears his throat. “Yes, well – about that. Thank you… for earlier.” He runs a hand through his blonde locks and Harry tracks the movement – remembering how the strands felt on his fingertips as he held back Malfoy’s hair.
Scorpius gives him a proud look and pats his fist to his chest. “I growed it myself.” He declares, giving a smug look that is spitting image of Draco Malfoy.
Draco’s heart thuds anxiously. “Make sure to check that it’s Harry, Scorpius!” He thinks about the last time a deranged ministry employee abused his power and flooed into Draco’s flat trying to kill him. He thanks every higher power that Scorpius was at the Manor. He freezes the hand that’s combing through his hair as the reality settles in. He’ll always be seen as a death eater. He’ll always be a social outcast and he hates how much it affects Scorpius’ life. He always knew he’d be alone, but fuck for Scorpius –
“Sit, dear.” She gives him a reassuring smile. “Scorpius is alright. It’s
“Um – yeah,” Draco turns down the heat and starts washing his hands. “I’m cooking dinner, gimme a sec to wash my hands.”
He nods once and holds a bundle of ice skates by the laces in his right hand. “Ice skating.”
“Yes, I’m
Draco smiles to himself as he continues pouring drinks. “Yes, Scorp absolutely adores the man.”
to. He just has to see the curse breaker and –
Lucius shrugs unapologetically. “I won’t pretend we’re not stubborn and proud.”
“And um-,” He snaps his gaze back to Hermoine. “Not just me, but to everyone.” She clears her throat. “He wrote letters to Ron, and Neville and the Weasleys as well. Even Ginny.”
There’s a longer moment of silence and Draco fumbles in his head for a way to explain what just happened when suddenly his stomach lets out a loud rumble. Harry cocks an eyebrow in his direction. “Didn’t you just have dinner?”
Draco clears his throat and removes his hands from Harry’s, instantly missing the warmth. “Yes, I’m – I’m alright. I’m sorry.”
Draco swallows. “What’s that?” His voice cracks but he doesn’t bother to clear his throat because he’s not sure what’s going on and he’s not sure whether he loves it or hates it.
He furrows his eyebrows. “What do you mean?”
“Potter. I-I didn’t expect you.” He smooths out his tie and clears his throat. “Thank you – I was just,” He stiffly gestures to the blonde sitting primly in his chair. “-discussing something with Mr. Malfoy here.”
Harry’s not exactly his number one fan right now. He huffs indignantly and rises to his feet. Maybe he won’t be in his office and he can just drop the damn thing on his desk and be on his way. He scrubs his hands down his face and sighs before flopping back into his chair.
Pansy is oddly quiet and he flicks his gaze up to see a torn expression on her face. Her voice drops significantly and if Harry wasn’t giving his undivided attention to them then he wouldn’t have caught it. “Because he doesn’t have much time, Theo.” Nott looks down solemnly. “Even though he has impossibly high standards – tall (
Draco sits back and furrows his brow. “Of course.” Scorpius casts a furtive glance at Harry before jumping off the couch and out the side door.
Merlin, this makes him nostalgic. That’s kind of fucked up, isn’t it?”
Harry Potter likes to think he’s brave. He’s confident. He’s the embodiment of Gryffindor.
“This?”
He wonders if it had been better to force things to work with Eric. He should have stayed with him. Gone home with him. Introduced him Scorpius.
Draco chuckles lightly. “Alright, come along.”
A sharp pain stabs his chest and his whole body grows cold. He drops to his hands and knees gasping for breath because suddenly it feels like he’s drowning in cold water. He’s trembling, teeth chattering because he’s so fucking cold. Distantly he hears Scorpius call to him from downstairs and his voice is enough to will him to use the dresser to heave himself up to his feet.
Harry scowls. “I did.”
Draco smiles. “Well, I guess you’ll have to come over for dinner sometime then, won’t you?”
The brunette in front of him lets out a choked sob. “When I saw you – I thought, I though -,” Any resolve Harry has breaks and he surges forward pulling Draco into his lap and his head against his chest. He feels his heart racing and Draco’s eyes widen. He pulls away to study Draco and runs a hand through his blonde locks. “I’m so sorry I didn’t get to you sooner.”
Draco lets out a breath and looks down, suddenly finding himself in a deep maroon Gryffindor quidditch shirt that sits much looser on his frame. It’s comfortable, worn in just the right way and so soft… Draco cocks an eyebrow, with a confidence that he is totally faking. “Thought something from Gryffindor would look better on me?”

Malfoy pushing back Scorpius’ platinum locks affectionately. “Yes, Scorp?”
The text back comes quick again.
Draco ruffles his hair and lifts him up to his hip, kissing the top of his head softly. “Something smells lovely. Would that be your doing?”
“Harry James Potter! How dare you?”
He groans and runs a hand through it. “This is just what it does, Pansy. I can’t help it.”
Harry flushes and rubs the back of his neck. “Ah-um,”
Draco gives the young which behind the counter a light smile. “Thank you… and-,” He taps his index finger on the reception desk twice before continuing. “Do you happen to know the curse breaker I’ll be seeing?”
Draco mutters a small protest and pulls out of Potter’s grasp. “No. No hospital. I’ll be-,”
He tries on an assortment of outfits, Scorpius’ commentary both hilarious and oddly helpful.
“Multiple times.” Harry scowls and Draco
The door closes behind the doctor and Draco sags. Stupid twenty-three year old heart broken Draco just
He presses his phone against his chest and gives Cormac and apologetic look. “Sorry about that. We really should be going.”
He chuckles.
Merlin, he wonders if he was this dramatic as a child. A voice in his head sounding surprisingly a lot like Potters responds with a
“Mother…” He warns.
Ron shrugs. “With the look he was giving you through the celly, mate… I think it’s safe to say that he definitely doesn’t hate you too.”
“It was nothing. Plus,” He shrugs and holds up the plant and the sandwiches. “I got food and a plant. I think we’re even.” They share a light laugh, and Merlin does Harry want to hear Malfoy’s breathy laugh again. He hesitates, but he’s curious by nature and a deep pit in his stomach just
“Oh? You live close by?”
Draco can’t help the goofy grin on his face because Merlin, it makes him so happy to see Scorpius so proud of himself. “You ready, Draco?” Harry steps out onto the ice and skates around to face Draco, reaching a hand out. “Do you trust me?”
“Stop it, Blaise.” He turns his nose up. “I’m not asking for help. I’ll be fine figuring this out on my own.”
“Don’t touch, Potter. That’s for brunch.”
Harry smiles confidently. “To ice skate? Nah.” He shakes his head and pats the small blonde’s knee. “Plus, Teddy is gonna help you, and Teddy here is a pro!”
But no. Draco is nothing. He works at a muggle/wizard bookstore, runs an at home apothecary to hide the Malfoy name… he was on the wrong side of the war. There’s no way someone like Harry fucking Potter could –
Harry huffs and sits back in his chair. “How can I save someone if I don’t know what’s wrong?”
“Hello Harry,” She points her wand upstairs. “Teddy is packing his things right now, he’ll be down in a second.” She sits back in her kitchen chair and closes her magazine. “How are you, dear? Enjoy your weekend?” He thinks about Malfoy framed perfectly in the light from the window in bookstore, his hand tossing back his curtain of blonde hair and his silver eyes gleaming in the afternoon sun. “Apparently good, judging by the look on your face.”
When Lucius finds the four of them in a tight huddle, his panic subsides and he spends the rest of brunch shooting knowing looks at Harry finally acknowledging that if anyone can save his son – it’s going to be Harry fucking Potter.
“Yes, he already wants to see you again.”
Scorpius looks at him before mimicking Teddy’s pose. It’s hard to take him seriously in his brown chinos, his checkered button up and pale blue bowtie and navy suspenders, but Merlin does he look so cute scowling down at Draco and Harry. “What do we have here?” He repeats.
A lull of quiet passes between the two of them and Potter gives him a small smile. “It seems like you’re doing well.”
Ron gapes.
, you are. Go ahead, Blaise’s office is at the end of the hall.” He nods in the direction and winks. “Have fun.”
Draco grimaces. “-awkward?” He provides helpfully.
Lucius clears his throat. “So Potter, um – what do you think of Bulgaria this year? They’ll be without Viktor Krum for the first time in over a decade.”
Harry stares and reads the phone number on the parchment. Draco Malfoy has a fucking cell phone. He immediately grabs his phone and shoots off a text message before heading off to the bar.
couch, casually drinking a beer while he watches – he frowns – some kind of cheesy Christmas special.. He realizes his mouth is open and he snaps it shut, clearing his throat feeling suddenly very exposed without his waist coat. “Um – I – where’s Pansy?”
Of course trying to get to Draco bloody Malfoy would be difficult.
Draco practically melts at the admission.
Teddy stands up in his skates and helps Scorpius to his feet. “You bet! Started skating when I was your age! Ready to get on the ice, bud?”
Draco Malfoy hooked up with a lowly Ravenclaw?”
Harry rises to his toes and whispers conspiratorially in the blonde’s ear. “Magic.”
Ron cocks an eyebrow. “Are you dating a muggle? Is that who’s got all your attention in that box? What’s she like? Is she hot?”
Harry spun back and forth on his chair as he read his letter and couldn’t help but slightly preen at the fact that Lucius was impressed by him. He stopped spinning. Well, Merlin, if that wasn’t so fucked up wanting
Of course, a deeper level of himself knows that he deserves this – knows that this is justified. He gets what’s meant to come to him. There’s a warm sensation on his face and he distantly acknowledges that he must be bleeding from not only his nose but some sort of legion on his forehead. His heart clenches and he feels himself grow colder, near freezing.
Draco snaps his gaze forward and oh for fuck’s sake, they’re gonna hit the back wall. Draco closes his eyes tightly and suddenly he’s wrapped in Harry’s arms and spun around colliding with Harry’s chest as the Gryffindor’s back thuds against the wall and he lets out a sharp grunt. Draco looks up and Harry winces slightly. “Oh dammit, Potter are you okay?” The blonde starts to pull away and slips causing Harry to pull him close again.
“Okay!” Scorpius throws his hands up excitedly as they exit the room.
His face shoots up. Mother fucking –
wish Scorpius didn’t teach you that.”
He huffs. “Dreadful.” He admits.
Five years later, December 1
I think I'm literally so dead set on Lucius' redemption arc just because of Jason Isaacs
Teddy and Scorpius rush through the door. “Are you?” Teddy looks hopeful. “Thank Merlin, Harry can’t cook.”
He opens the door, the magic yielding to Draco’s appearance. His mother’s voice floats in from the kitchen. “Draco dear, is that you?” She emerges from the kitchen smiling gently. “I’ve prepared tea and biscuits. I want to hear all about-,” She stops and let’s go of the tray suspending it in the air before rushing over. She glances at Potter before turning to Draco. “What happened? Are you alright? Is it-,”
He hears Harry’s melodic laugh on the other line.
His eyes flutter open and he takes in his surroundings. Blaring white walls, sunshine seeping through the open window. He squints against the light and lets out a groan.
Someone was careful to keep out the word date.
“What?!” He jumps. “Of course not! I have Scorpius – I’d never – why would you ask that?”
Pansy seems to shrug as she picks at one of her false nails. “I don’t know. Draco seems to not want to go down that road again, and I don’t blame him.” Seeming to find no imperfections in her nails, she resumes her coffee. “Can’t really see Blaise playing a father figure role, can you?” She snorts. “Can you imagine him going to Scorpius’ muggle school for silly little plays and weird muggle sports game?”
“You have a plan then?”
“Harry?”
to love and be loved. Didn’t want that warm feeling of affection. He wiggles his bare toes, slightly numb from the cold and it hits him.
It takes two weeks to brew, and he works tirelessly – hiding the concoction in his room. Finally, on December 1
The four of them in a tight huddle, and Draco feels himself warming slightly, the cold drifting a way.
after this one is born.” Harry chuckles affectionately, glancing at the clock above his fireplace for the fifth time. “You know, if you’d like me to leave, you can just tell me. You have somewhere to be?” She asks coyly.
“Pansy… I know.” He swallows thickly and rises to his feet, her hand slipping away. “I want to do my best for Scorpius, but I can’t – I can’t trust Blaise.” He walks to the table where his potions are set up and turns around leaning against it. “Pansy, I need someone who’s in it for me
“Surprised they make a
“Shhh. Just watch Tim Allen turn into the Santa Claus.”
Oh he wants to play that game, does he? Draco cocks an eyebrow and sips his coffee, pulling it close to his chest. “A forgotten shirt from a
“Teddy…” Harry warns.
He showed up on Pansy Parkinson’s doorstep, a single duffle bag in his hand and without missing a beat, she invited him in. Slowly his friends filtered back into his life and Pansy helped him piece himself back together. It was three months into living with Pansy that he saw Astoria Greengrass. She was beautiful – long legs, dark hair, tanned skin. She looked immaculate sitting with a delicate drink in her hand on Pansy’s couch.
It takes a good half hour for Draco to feel a little more confident, only slipping occasionally. The breeze bites at his nose and ears, but Draco still feels happy and warm beside Potter. He’s skating freely now, and Harry’s arm is at his side, no longer worried about Draco falling – although he nearly does when he realizes that their hands are interlaced and they’ve skated a few rounds around the rink. His cheeks dust pink and he decides not to say anything. A moment of silence lapses and he watches Scorpius let go of Teddy’s hand and begin skating on his own.
There’s a slightly breathless laugh. “Sort of the opposite actually. Here let me take this.” There’s a sizzling sound and Draco can only assume that Harry’s dumped the batter into a waffle maker. “Where are the glasses Scorpius?”
Theo shakes his head. “Um. Hey Potter?”
to freeze his fucking heart. Just fucking fantastic. He runs a hand through his dirty hair. His mother is definitely not gonna take this well. And Scorpius – he feels a pang in his chest. He drops his face in his hands. He knows his mom and dad would never let anything bad happen to Scorp, but… he thinks about ten years ago.
Ravenclaw shirt.”
He jumps when his phone chimes and glances at the screen barely registering the-
Draco bites his lip to keep from smiling. Pansy clears her throat, and he clutches the parchment in his hand, jumping at the sound. Pansy sets the tray down and gives him a knowing smirk. “And who, pray tell, is that letter from. I
Lucius trails in from the side door as well and hangs his coat on the rack by the front door. “He definitely kept grandpa on his feet. Draco, how was-?” Lucius halts when he locks eyes with Potter.
He squeezes his eyes tightly and takes a breath. “Alright, I’ll have my mother watch him.” He gently pulls away and follows in Mr. Griffin.
And for the first time in his life, Draco Malfoy’s heart broke. With five years in Azkaban, he had plenty of time to think about what a horrible father he had. He grew angry at his father for treating him so poorly. Bitter at his mother for letting it happen. So, when the three of them were released, he didn’t return to the manor.
Harry’s heart drops into the pit of his stomach because that… he can’t change…
Draco runs his hand through Scorp’s blonde locks affectionately. “Sorry. Scorpius is shy around strangers.”
Harry smiles. He likes that Draco actually pays attention to these things.
He hears Hermione’s quill stop and he looks up. “Harry, what’s really going on?”
Harry nods seriously. “Yes. She’s going to take good care of you, okay?” He rises to his feet and places the cuff on his wrist. It burns his skin and vibrates violently.
Draco sighs heavily suddenly wracked with guilt. He should probably put a stop to this. He reaches for the door and freezes when Harry speaks again. “Scorpius your mom is – well he’s the - he’s the smartest wizard I know. Scorpius, your mom was a scared kid who made a lot of stupid decisions.” Draco closes his eyes tightly, because – isn’t that the fucking truth? “But so was I.” His eyes snap open. “Your mom is – Scorpius your mom is….
A quick patter of light footsteps grabs their attention and Scorpius appears at Malfoy’s side, tugging on his jumper. “Um – mom?”
“Mr. Harry. Why are you adding
“If you could just have a seat right here, Mr. Malfoy, and the curse breaker will call you back shortly.”
There’s a long silence and he can hear Scorpius moving about his room, more than likely making his bed. “Why can’t you tell me the truth?”
Harry hums on the other line.
“I think he might adore you.” She leans her hip against the kitchen counter. “I mean he’s putting up with your father for Merlin’s sake.”
He sits up. “Scorpius. Where’s Scorpius? Was I attacked?”
like yourself do his own paperwork. The Great Harry Potter, reduced to menial tasks.” He crosses an ankle to his knee and leans further into his seat.
“Why are you so fucking cold?” He distantly hears his mother run to grab her wand. He uses his own wand to carefully remove the shards of glass from his hands. “Sorry, this might sting a bit.” When the glass is removed, he sanitizes the wounds and pulls bandages from his wand to wrap around his hand.
He watches Scorpius plop down in the sand.
The brunette rubs the back of his neck shyly. “Really, it was no trouble Mrs. Malfoy. I probably should get going…”
Draco shifts himself into frame. “Hi.” He smiles.
Harry nods very seriously. “Of course.” And Scorpius runs away.
Harry furrows his eyebrows and sets the book on the table beside the couch. “
“Blaise.” Draco slides out of his seat and shoots him a hard look. “Leave it alone.” He pulls a few galleons from his pocket and tosses them on the table. “Thank you for having lunch with me.”
All too soon, Scorpius is fidgeting in his clothes wearing a pair of black jeans and a pair of black snow boots. Much to Draco’s dismay, Scorp is heavily into cats and Christmas and he’s excitedly donning a deep forest green sweater with a cat on it that says ‘Meowy Christmas’. There are white snowflakes dotted all over the sweater. He hangs up Scorpius’ winter coat by the door. “Alright Scorpius, I’m going to get ready.”
He winces. “Merlin. Rough night or something?”
Draco hums thoughtfully, messily texting back with one hand.
The parchment crumples slightly in Harry’s grasp as he clenches it tighter.
Seemingly satisfied, she sits back in her seat. “Exactly.” She gives Theo a mischievous look. “Which is why, I’ve bullied Draco into going out on a few dates.”
Scorpius smiles proudly. “Me and Mr. Harry.”
He starts down the stairs, running a hand through his slightly damp hair. Shit, Scorpius is gonna be so disappointed when he explains how horrible his date went.
Draco takes a deep bracing breath. He’s been putting this off for far too long. He’s going to need to find someone or some sort of – counter curse to get rid of this and if he – if he can’t… he needs to set up a back up plan for Scorpius. Yes, his parents would be more than willing to take care of Scorp, but –
Harry taps at Sirius’s ring with his index finger. “But – what if that’s not enough? What if I’m not enough? Just me. Just Harry. I know he’s Malfoy, but he’s also-,”
They choose a sandwich shop down the street and spend a pleasant lunch hour catching up. Most of their discussion revolves around Scorpius, the kindergartener more than happy to fill Potter in. He learns that Scorpius attends a muggle school three days a week and a wizard daycare the other two days.
course. Potter even went as far as getting his parents sentences reduced as well. It’s something in Potter’s testimony that rattles his bones.
Scorpius pouts, his bottom lip quivering. “But-,” And Jesus Christ, there’s no way Harry’s gonna say no to that adorable little face.
“M-Mr. Mc-,” He frowns. “You mean Cormac?”
Harry shifts and he pushes around his food. “Do you think he’d go for me?”
He takes his seat in the uncomfortable waiting chair. He picks up a Witch Weekly, flipping through the pages disinterestedly. He really should have brought a book.
He smirks and the line cuts out, Draco’s heart warming with affection. He starts for the kitchen and then stutters to a halt. His chest has never felt this way. He genuinely feels…
Harry takes them through a back entry and exit to and from the Ministry, made specifically for Harry to inconspicuously come and go as he pleases. Once they leave, he apparates them to a safe point and makes his way to a muggle Italian restaurant. Lucius looks mildly uncomfortable and is content to let Harry take the lead. When they’re finally seated, waters in front of them Harry clasps his hands and leans on the table.
He shakes his head. “It’s nothing, Hermione – I’m just – looking for a change I guess is all. I’m just tired.” He amends. He slides his chair back and rises to his feet. “I really should get going anyway.”
Harry smirks and rubs the back of his neck bashfully. “I – uh – hi.”
Lucius scoffs and takes a sip of water.
“Are you-,” His lip trembles slightly. “Are you going to be nice to my mom?”
Draco smiles and watches him leave. The doctor pulls up a chair and the blonde schools his features.
Harry groans and buries his head in Draco’s hair. “Teddy…” He mumbles.
Quintin throws himself in the chair across from Blaise’s desk and flashes a teasing smirk. “You also didn’t tell me you were seeing that hot little blonde again.” Harry cocks an eyebrow and looks at Blaise.
“Yay!” Scorpius holds the too large phone to his ear. “Hi Mr. Harry!”
He smiles tentatively at the receptionist at the CB office, giving her a quick salute before striding back to Blaise’s office.
“Up here! I’ll get the plates.”
His brow is furrowed as he looks through a menu. “I’m thinking burgers from that new place that just opened up in Diagon Alley – Diagon Burgers.” He taps the items he wants and hands the menu to Draco. “What do you want?”
Harry groans and shifts his body, pushing Draco forward. The blonde catches himself on one hand by Harry’s head, his face hovering inches above his. “I’m fine.” Harry mumbles. He reaches out and tucks a loose strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Are you okay?”
Lucius groans.
“No,” He rubs the back of his neck shyly. “It was quite pleasant actually.”
“Ah…” Harry smirks and stares at the empty bottle. “Back to Potter, are we?” He mumbles. He shakes his head and turns his gaze, fully to Draco. “It’s alright. You don’t have to tell me right now.” He smiles, and Draco is briefly blindsided by it. “But you will eventually. I know it.” Draco opens his mouth to speak and Harry just shakes his head, still smiling. “Right now, let’s forget about it. I know it’s bothering you – trust me I know what it looks like when someone feels helpless, like the weight of the world sits heavy on your shoulders – so for right now – whatever it is, Draco…” His voice drops to a whisper and he reaches out tugging Draco closer to him. “-right now, forget about it. And let me comfort you.”
When he’s finally sitting at the stool, he’s tapping his index finger impatiently. It’s 4:28pm, they’re regular Taco Tuesday night at a wizard Cantina. Harry smiles at the laughing crowd, and the patrons on the dance floor. Merlin, he’s grateful that Diagon Alley has been so diverse recently. He’s here early, everyone else is there around five, but –
She gives him a firm hug. “Be safe, okay?”
He pushes that thought down.
The boys burst into a fit of laughter and Draco feels himself warm at his son’s smile. Harry clear his throat and gestures to the front door. “Shall we?”
He stops walking and holds the phone to his son in his arms. “Mr. Harry wants to talk to you.”
He thinks about last night…
“You let me go on and on about Ireland that day at tea and didn’t bother to tell me you owned the team!” Lucius lets out a boisterous and extremely out of character laugh and Harry fumbles indignantly. “I mean to tell you at brunch the other day, but what the actual hell, Lucius?!” He lets out a light laugh.
And it’s that surge of protectiveness that causes a fondness to blossom in Harry’s chest for his former worst enemy, Lucius Malfoy. He opens the door, effectively cutting off any protest Blaise was about to start, a small swagger in his step because fuck yeah. Lucius just put this arrogant SOB in his place.
“I’ll get it! I’ll get it!”
The raven rubs the back of his neck bashfully. “Actually, Teddy and I live on the other side of the park.” He nods his head in the direction their headed. “About a thirty minute walk past the park and you’d be there.”
,” He shoots Harry a pointed look. “-in my office.”
“It’s alright.” He hands Draco back his beer.
Scorpius beams. “Thank you for letting us see you, Mr. Harry.”
Teddy grabs Scorp’s hand. “Excellent! Then when you two have finished snogging, Scorpius and I would like some hot cocoa.”
“It’s okay. Mom just needs to get warmed up.” He puts his small hand in Draco’s and winces slightly at the freezing temperature. Draco tries to withdraw but Scorpius gives him a hard look and fuck does Draco wish he could blame that look on someone other than himself. He lets his son lead him to the fire and once he’s close enough to the flames, he feels himself start to warm. When his limbs reawaken, he scoops up Scorpius and holds him on his hip, the small child wrapping his arms tightly around his neck.
Draco genuinely loves his job as a mail order potion apothecary, but he finds himself a little stir crazy. He’d love to have a job as an actual Potions Master at Hogwarts, or even just a potions expert at the ministry or in Diagon Alley, but-
Harry’s face darkens and he tsks. “You mean to tell me
He clears his throat to fight back a laugh sending one single text back.
This is what wizards did in their early twenties, right? Laugh. Drink. Hook up.
As Harry shifts on the doorstep he can’t help but feel like this is top three of the weirdest days of his life. In fact, fighting Voldemort was definitely more normal than this. At least that had been predetermined before his birth, but having tea and sandwiches with the Malfoys on a Friday afternoon…
“Hi!” They both look down at Scorpius before letting out a huff of laughter. Right. Focus. He’s here for Scorpius. He’s beaming up at them with a bright excited smile on his face.
“Harry, I – I have something I need to tell you.”
Harry beams. “Ready to go, Malfoy boys?”
“Yes.” Lucius snaps his gaze to Harry. “I can’t – I can’t quite explain it. It’s happening so fast but I – I’m going to save him, Mr. Malfoy. You can bet your life on it.”
“Harry…” She chides. “You’ve been so distant lately and you’ve missed the monthly Weasley dinner for like six months. What’s going on?”
Harry furrows his eyebrows. “What are you talking about? Switched what?”
“Scorpius told me to make sure to hug you this morning.” He murmurs, lips brushing against Draco’s shoulder blade. “He says it’s a matter of life or death.” There’s no humor when he says it and Draco is so scared that he
His son squeezes his cheeks and forces Draco’s attention back to him. “He was here when I woke up. Asleep on the couch. I thought you were still away.” His eyes look glassy but he smiles anyway. “Mr. Harry said we should cook you breakfast. He says you were home… early.” He gives Draco and accusatory look and Draco just rolls his eyes.
He opens the door to see Andromeda flicking her wand, washing dishes and having them put themselves away. She sitting at the kitchen table thumbing through Witch Weekly. There’s a cup of tea in front of her and she’s munching on some flakey biscuits. “Hello Andy,” They hug and she sets herself back in her chair.
Someone recognizes him. Blaise and Draco tend to avoid overpopulated areas – places where the ex death eater could get recognized, but they figured a Thursday around lunch time wouldn’t be so crowded.
He cocks an eyebrow. “You know, I’m home now. Cormac isn’t here.”
Draco frowns. “I missed him too.” He feels a twinge of guilt about leaving Scorpius for the evening and selfishly trying to find love. His frown deepens, well if he’s honest he’s technically
That sounds familiar… there’s no way he’d be at the Ministry, but that’s most definitely –
The curse breaker sits in his desk, an ankle crossed over the opposite knee and fingers interlaced behind his head. “The hot blonde?” He chuckles. “Sorry mate, you’re gonna have to be a bit more
He watches his father unclench his fist and let out a long sigh. “Potter in my fucking sitting room.” He murmurs in disbelief.
He looks up from his phone. “Yes, dear?”
Harry frowns.
If Draco had more time maybe –
Harry’s smile turns lopsided and warm.
Harry grabs his beer and takes a chug, swallowing hard. “It’s not a muggle. Stop asking about it. What were you saying?”
That's right. Two chapters. Two days. I've been inspired. This one's a filler. Sorry guys. I acknowledge that it's very OOC for Lucius Malfoy, but I like to think that he deserves a little redemption. I also picture him as more of a like - Hades from Disney's Hercules villain - humorous, slightly evil.
Pansy’s heels click against the hardwood floor and she hugs him from behind. “Oh, Draco…” She sighs. “Let me make us some tea and we can talk while you work.”
He feels warm.
“Right.” He takes a deep breath. “Alright then Potter, let’s get this over with. I owe you… my thanks for keeping me out of Azkaban.” He clears his throat. “So… um… thanks…” Potter’s still glaring and Lucius shifts. “I’ll uh – I’ll go see if your mother needs any help.”
Draco almost dies at breakfast and fights the confusing feeling of relief when Harry leaves around lunchtime and also a small pang of wishing he’d stay forever.
Harry takes a deep breath and opens the door, the small tinkling above him causing both Malfoys to snap their gaze up.
Harry smiles gently. “Had some emergency with Goyle.” He shrugs. “If I’m honest, I was afraid to ask, plus – I’m happy to hang out with Scorp.”
“Potter it’s almost 10pm, and you want to order take out right now?”
Shit. Is. Heating. Up.
Draco blushes furiously and turns his nose up. “And if I do?”
Draco knows he’s pacing and knows he’s slightly obsessing, but he can’t help it. Merlin only
Andromeda gasps. “Are you joking?”
Draco is…dating…?
Harry’s head lifts up, his voice clear in Draco’s ear. “You’re not a coward.” He says vehemently. “You are one of the bravest men I know.” There’s a pause. “I know you knew who I was back at the Manor. You could have easily turned me in… but you chose not to.” His arms tighten around his waist, and he drops his head back to Draco’s shoulder. “Draco,” Goosebumps break across the blonde’s skin at the sound of his name on Harry’s lips. “You are so brave.”
Scorpius shrugs. “I just know Steven says since his mom and dad aren’t married anymore, Mr. McLaggen has been talking about how pretty my mom is.” Scorpius nods seriously and looks at Harry. “Don’t you think my mom is beautiful, Mr. Harry?”
He’ll be quick. Drop the folder on his desk, sneeze on something and leave. And if Blaise is there – well even better, he’ll just sneeze on Blaise.
He can’t quite decide if that should frustrate him or if he should feel relieved.
He follows his mom into the kitchen, helping her set up for brunch. He’s pouring champagne into flutes of orange juice when she clears her throat. “So, you and Harry arriving together at the Manor… this is the –
When the green flames subside, it reveals a wide eyed and soot covered Scorpius. Harry cocks an eyebrow “Scorpius?”
– I’m hoping he’ll drop his standards a bit.”
Scorpius removes the cuff and holds it out to Harry. “This will tell you where he is. Mom says it’ll apparate him straight to me when I’m in trouble.”
“Father…” Draco stands slowly and holds out a hand and places himself between Lucius and Potter. He gives Lucius a knowing look and the older wizard slumps in defeat.
“Do you even know-,” Potter gives him a pointed look and he snaps his mouth shut. “Oh, right. Of course.” He murmurs. “Look, I don’t-,” He glances at his watch knowing it’s close to 1:30 and he’s already later than he’s promised Scorp. He pushes at his magic and it feebly responds. He meets Potter’s eyes. “Thank you.”
Is that-?
The address Malfoy gives him is one for a small bookstore. In fact, Harry is pretty sure he’s passed the place a few times. It takes him fifteen minutes to get there and he stands outside the door, peeking in. It’s gloomy and chilly so the bookstore is relatively empty. Right at the check counter he sees Malfoy, typing away at the computer in front of him and Scorpius is sitting on the counter, legs swinging as he thumbs through a picture book.
He sighs. “I mean, I haven’t
“Are you serious?” The older woman studies him and he smiles happily at her. It’s nice having a mother and a grandmother figure in his life for Teddy.
“Err- Scorpius and I were just leaving, ah – dear.”
Harry straightens up and nods. “Oh right!” He gives Malfoy a serious look. “Aye aye Captain Mom!”
Theo drops his forehead to the table and groans. “The problem with Draco is that he’s so fucking stubborn. He’d probably fall in love and not even know or acknowledge it.”
He finds the agreed upon park bench and sits down, Scorp shifting impatiently beside him. “Mama?”
He’s released from St. Mungo’s on a cold day mid-November. He’s sitting in a chair in his room, he can hear his mother singing a lullaby to Scorpius in the other room and he’s grateful for her. The reality of his break up settles in his chest.
He huffs, too nervous to be embarrassed. “I don’t know what to wear to a Malfoy brunch.” He waves a hand in front of the camera, briefly concerned it froze.
“Mom makes me wear this.” He shoves his arm closer to Harry. “It tells him when I get too far away or when I’m scared.” His eyes pool with tears. “Mr. Harry. It’s hot and it’s rumbling. He’s scared! I know ‘cause that’s what it did to my dad when grandpa’s peacock chased me. I tried to tell Miss Pansy but – but,” he lets out a choked sob. “She didn’t believe me. It’s so hot, Mr. Harry! He’s really scared!” He throws himself back in Harry’s arms and rubs his face in his chest, muffling his voice. “You promised you’d protect him, Mr. Harry. You promised you’d keep my mom safe.”
Draco scowled and turned away. “If I wanted you to know, Potter – than I would.” He snapped.
The doctor waves his wand and the clipboard disappears. “Mr. Malfoy, a freezing curse placed on the heart is usually used for two reasons. One, and the most common is to freeze your own heart to find love. If someone’s affection for you is strong enough to warm your heart, the curse is broken. Two would be for someone to take their own life. They brew enough of the potion and continue drinking it until their heart freezes to a stop.” There’s a long silence and the doctor gives him a calculating look. “I’m afraid that because you’ve taken only a small amount, and your heart has not been warmed in five years – the potion is beginning to work at an accelerated rate.”
“He is?”
.” Harry gets up and starts to shoulder on his coat. “Hey – uh Ron,” He shuts the office door behind them. “Do you happen to know what Cormac McLaggen has been up to lately?”
“You do?”
What did Scorpius say again? Oh right!
“Just wondering.” He replies mysteriously as he nonchalantly takes a bite of his bacon.
That’s definitely not Pansy’s voice.
“Comes with the territory. I am Gryffindor after all.”
“Hm?”
Draco huffs indignantly. “Yes, but I had a stupid salad.”
He knows that voice. He shuts the magazine and uncrosses his legs, looking up to see beautiful perfect Blaise Zabini looking down at him. He’s wearing a crisp navy blue suit with a deep forest green tie and a white button up. He’s got a matching pocket square and glimmering silver cuff links, his slacks form fitting and his brown dress shoes as pristine as ever.
He takes a deep breath before glancing at the address. He was surprised when Malfoy sent it to him at how close it was to Grimmuald place. He exits the building, the spell wards popping up and hiding its location. He starts the short walk, just a few blocks away.
And it’s only when Draco is nearly finished with his burger, that Harry ruins their pleasant evening.
Knocking back a few more drinks, laughing with his friends, bumping into Astoria in the hallway, pressing her against the wall – warm hands on him… it felt
“Scorpius-,”
His son leaps off the couch. “Let me help!”
“Scorpius, can you hand me the blueberries?”
God, this was so fucked up. But damn was Draco so happy. “Me and Scorp will be there. I’ll call my mum to iron out the details.” A thought strikes him and he boldly asks, “Do you want to come over beforehand? So um – so Scorp and Teddy can hang out for a bit, and we can just go to the Manor together?”
“Merlin, I looked like a bloody moron.” He bemoans and rolls his eyes. “Must all the Malfoys play stupid mind games.”
He sighs heavily and reads over the profile that Pansy sent to him yesterday.
Scorp. Blaise isn’t-,” He turns away. “That’s just not him.”
to know. “And Scorpius is great.” He adds casually. “If um, if he calls you mom why-,”
“I’d give it one month before your heart stops.” The Doctor mutters a spell to his wand. “I’m recommending you to see a curse breaker at the ministry. I’ll set you an appointment for tomorrow morning.” He rises to his feet.
He sets his phone down because – seriously, he should probably get back to work.
He shifts uncomfortably, accidentally pulling his phone away from his chest.
Lucius just scoffs and rolls his eyes. “You’re the savior of the wizarding world. I’m sure you’ll figure it out.” There’s a moment of hesitation, which has Malfoy’s eyes scanning the restaurant. “You-,” He clears his throat. “You are trying to figure it out, correct?”
Harry chuckles, eyes sympathetic. “Been there.” He winces slightly and clears his throat before scooting over on the couch. “You – uh – wanna talk about it?” He pats the couch beside him.
Harry looks up and watches Malfoy. He can see his profile, his platinum hair glowing off the sunlight, hair falling in his face… The woman in front of him says something and the blonde throws his head back and a melody of laughter hits Harry’s ears – and Merlin if it isn’t something so beautiful… “Yeah,” He answers wistfully. “Your mom
Harry smirks.
Yeah, he’d still commit crime for this burger.
Merlin, Draco feels so gone for this stupid man.
He hears Ron again.
“Yes!” Scorpius declares pulling away. “Mom needs hugs to stay warm” He slips from Harry’s grip and into Draco’s, one arm around Draco’s neck and the other one open in an invitation to Teddy. The boy looks to Harry cautiously before coming forward.
Malfoy snorts. “Oh come now, Potter. We both know you’re
He looks away. He thinks about the way Draco looks at Scorpius, about his hair haloed against the afternoon light from the window in the bookstore. He thinks about pink dusting his cheeks when he’s embarrassed, thinks about the silver gray eyes swarming with emotion…
Narcissa grabs the containers from Draco’s hand. “Come along, Draco. Help me set the table.”
Draco swallows thickly. “Yes, I’m – I’ m fine.”
Well.
The tall dark wizard throws his head back and laughs. “Bulgaria’s seeker is still a strong player. I thought you of all people
He also learns that Blaise has been working on cracking cases for the Auror’s office. Blaise pushes away his finished steak. “It’s been difficult. I often times find myself bringing work home with me. It’s not exactly how I like to
I won’t let anyone hurt your mom again.” His heart clenches at the thought of anyone hurting Malfoy and he holds his rival’s son harder. “I’ll protect you guys.”
“Oh, ‘Mione. It isn’t like that.” He reaches out and gives her a tentative pat on the shoulder. When she doesn’t bite his head off, he takes a step forward and envelopes her in a gentle hug. “I was just helping Malfoy out, okay?”
“Touch him again and I won’t bother using a spell. I’ll transfigure into a fucking wolf and tear you limb from limb.”
Draco passes his fingers through Scorp’s hair. “I kind of have to be with him in my life, you know?”
Hermione frowns. “Are you coming to dinner at Molly’s tonight?”
Goyle gives a halfhearted solute. “Anytime, mate. Go get ‘em.”
He can detect an irritated tilt to Blaise’s voice.
He takes off the oven mitts and pulls the blueberry muffins out and begins fanning them off before grabbing the second tray and sliding them in the oven. He hears Scorpius direct Harry to the kitchen. Potter comes into the door just as Draco slides the tray in and straightens up his stance. “Harry.”
“Draco…” Pansy reaches out and takes one of his hands. “I understand, but -,” She bites her lip, tears stinging the corners of her eyes. “Blaise told me what’s happening. She pulls her armchair closer and places a hand on his chest and gasps. “Draco your chest is so cold.” She chokes back a sob and he closes his eyes tightly looking away.
When he hangs up, he sees a text from Pansy.
For one blissful night he felt
She huffs impatiently. “Okay… maybe when you were kids, but can you honestly tell me that it’s hatred now?”
Their aprons are gone, and they’ve just finished packing the last of the pastries – Harry’s at the sink washing his hands and Draco calls out for the kids to come down. “Hey, Potter. Hand me the – shit!” Draco takes a step forward, the bottom of his shoe slipping on spilled raw egg causing him to launch forward. Harry’s arms wrap around him and his back hits the floor, Draco sprawled out above him. They both groan and Harry sits back on his knees, straddling Harry’s waist. “Fuck! Harry, are you okay?”
dark (
He frowns and clears his throat, relaxing against the pillows. “Why?”
“Draco?” He turns his head noticing his mother slumped in a chair. When she locks eyes with him and straightens up. “Oh Draco!” She reaches out and grips his hand gently. “You’re awake.”
Quintin laughs. “You scoundrel! I knew you were sleeping with him. No, I’m talking about the one from like five years ago. You were super secretive about it. Pale skin… platinum hair… the Death Eater – fuck what was his name again?”
how much it bothers him because if he didn’t know any better, he’d say Harry fucking Potter sounds jealous. “Could be worse.” He adds taking another sip of his coffee. “Could have been a Hufflepuff,” He snorts. “Or a Gryffindor.”
“Hermione, should you really be up this late?” It’s nearing eleven and Hermione is curled up on Harry’s couch, absently watching a Christmas special.
He takes a deep breath, pushing through the pain. He’s cold, he’s so
“The absolute strongest. He’s so brave, Scorpius and with your mom’s permission, I’ll tell you all about it when you get older.” And Draco’s heart leaps to his throat because that sounds like Harry’s not going anywhere. “Your mom makes me feel -,” There’s a hitch in his voice and he clears his throat. “I may not have liked your mom when we were kids Scorpius, but I
And for the third time Draco’s heart breaks.
fancies you. Scorp says he gets moony eyes over you.” He takes a sloppy gulp from his orange juice. “You should probably ask him out sooner rather than later. Draco’s kinda hot, he probably gets asked out all the time.”
He glances up to see Pansy Parkinson walking beside Theodore Nott with fresh cups of coffee in their hands, taking a seat at an empty table nearby. Theo grunts and sets his briefcase down. “So you think Blaise is the answer for Draco’s problem?”
“Right, right… let me get that for you.” He starts rummaging through the drawers and Harry glances around the room, sipping idly on his coffee.
“Yes.” He murmurs.
They learned right off the bat that the more physical contact Draco had, the warmer he felt. He gives Scorp a grateful kiss on the side of his head and smiles at Harry, readjusting his son on his hip. “Hello Harry.” Harry seems to want to press on what happened, but he shifts his gaze to the boy standing beside him. “And you must be Teddy.” He holds out his hand. “Draco Malfoy. Pleasure to meet you cousin.”
He blushes and turns away to hide his smile. “Nothing like that just-,” He faces her trying to seem impassive. “Had lunch with an old friend.” That’s mostly the truth, right?
“Okaaaay,” Harry takes a quick swig of his beer. “Changing the subject,
“Can I ask you a question?” Scorpius nods. “Why do you call Draco your mom?”
It wasn’t until nine months later when the universe decided Draco Malfoy could use a quick slap in the face - when Astoria showed up on Pansy’s doorstep, a baby in her arm with pale skin and shocking blonde hair.
His phone vibrates and he’s shocked to find it’s not a message at all but a – a fucking picture.
“Draco?” He looks up and sees McLaggen smirking down at him. Draco hastily gets to his feet.
Merlin, fuck his actual life right now.
“If this maybe has anything to do with my handsome cousin, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco takes a bite and moans. “Oh my Merlin, Potter this burger…” He groans. “I would commit crime for this burger.” He takes another bite and notes that Harry is oddly quiet. His eyes flick up and Harry’s staring at him, his own burger suspended in front of his mouth. Draco swallows the bite in his mouth and Harry tracks the movement. He’s staring at Draco, a hungry look in his eyes that has the blonde baffled. If he’s so hungry, why is he just holding his burger? It’s not like he can eat, Draco –
“Who is it?”
Theo takes a generous sip of his coffee. “Do you think he still refuses to date anyone but purebloods?”
He pales.
is a curse breaker. He falls back against the pillows.
“Thank you, ‘Mione.”
Draco shifts his weight, gripping his arm tightly. “Err -,” Why is talking about this with Harry so difficult? It’s not like they’re –
And then it happens.
Harry bumps his nose with Draco’s and steps away, giving him a quick scan. “There. You look so much better in something Gryffindor.”
“Thanks, Harry.” He whispers.
Teddy smirks. “Didn’t I tell ya, Scorp? Pretty wicked, right? Have you ever been ice skating before?”
He’s suddenly self conscious about his appearance. He’s thrown on a black fitted turtle neck and a pair of light gray chinos. His hair is in slight disarray – due to Scorpius throwing a minor tantrum before he left – and he’s wearing a simple pair of black and white Chuck Taylors. He tosses the magazine to the side table and stands to his feet smoothing out his turtle neck before extending a hand. “It’s good to see you again. It’s been awhile, hasn’t it?”
Eventually, Draco’s pulled Scorpius onto his lap and the small five year old has his arms curled into his chest and he’s sleeping soundly against his chest. “I work part time at the muggle/wizard book store to help Vera out and I work in an apothecary out of my flat.”
Teddy is standing beside them, a look of worry on his face. “Miss Cissy said she’ll be right in. um – can I – can I help?” He eyes Draco’s wound warily.
“Right. Sorry,” Harry shakes his head and turns away. “I spaced out for a second.” He clears his throat. “So I take it you like the burger?”
“Ow! Hermione, come on!” He holds his hands over his head protectively. “Ron why did you have to tell her?”
The blonde eases back on his bench and watches Teddy guide his son out on the ice. Scorpius fumbles for a second and places one hand against the wall and the other has a death grip in one of Teddy’s hands. Harry sits down beside him and holds out a pair of sleek black ice skates. “So? What do you say?”
He learns that Theo is apprenticing with Ollivander.
“I’m fine.” He loosens his grip on Draco. “Are you alright?”
He scowls. “Exactly, I’m going to the
His phone buzzes and he pulls it out of his pocket seeing Draco’s name light up his screen.
Draco looks up at them and shoots them a dreamy smile. “Come on you two! Let’s grab a bite to eat.” Harry scoops up Scorpius and puts him on his shoulders causing the child to squeal excitedly. When they reach the counter, Harry bends his knees as Scorpius reaches out to Malfoy. The blonde rests his son on his hip and smiles at Scorpius. “Did you have fun with Mr. Potter?”
Draco can’t break anymore than he already has. He drinks the small bottle in one gulp. Draco Lucius Malfoy freezes his heart from everyone around him.
She mutes the TV and sits up straight. “You are? You mean Draco, right?”
“Hey!” Harry admonishes. “Shut up and go play.” Scorpius squeals and Teddy chuckles as they rush out of the room and up a flight of stairs. Draco chuckles and turns back to the counter to begin working on his scones. Harry pushes up off the wall and stands beside him. “What are you making?” He reaches out to poke at one of the fresh warm muffles, and Draco swiftly swats his hand away. “Ow! Why?”
“Potter, I hardly think having burgers this late at night is proper.”
A mental picture of a young Malfoy pops in his head and he blushes. “Yeah, sometimes I miss it, and sometimes-,” He holds his beer, poised at his lips and a mental picture of kissing Draco Malfoy sitting by the lake pops into his head and he smiles. “-sometimes I wish I had done things differently.”
He groans and stumbles forward off the curb tweaking his ankle and falling forward. Before his face hits the concrete he feels a pair of strong arms wrap around him. “Woah, are you alright?” The voice is low, warm and comforting… “Wait a minute…
“Miss me, darling?”
Draco leans forward and Harry places a hand on his chest to stop him. “Teddy will make sure he’s okay. I promise.” He leans forward a bit and adds, “Plus I’ve put a balancing charm on his skates like I did for Teddy when he was learning.”
Harry shifts in his seat uncomfortably as he stares down at the small report on his desk. He’s relieved that it’s finally over – that stupid fucking cursed rubber duck.
pregnant, it’s impossible to get a good night’s sleep.” She props her feet up on his table. “Besides, Ron gets you for drinks every Tuesday. I should be allowed to have you once a week too. He can watch the child –
That’s the last straw for Harry. He slides out of his chair and walks purposefully over to their table. “Hello.” He offers casually before spinning around a free chair and taking a seat, arms crossed on the back of the chair.
“Scorpius!” Draco calls. The small blonde looks up, eyes wide. “Come on, dear. We ought to go.”
“I take it Draco told you then?” He asks, an amused smirk on his face.
Draco leans down. “Yes, darling?”
“I-I don’t know what to tell you.” He whispers.
“Harry?” His voice cracks and that seems to snap the chosen one back into reality.
Lucius frowns. “I have no idea what my son sees in you. You get on my every last nerve with this stupid hero complex.” It’s said without malice and Harry lets out a laugh.
In the end, it was Snape that killed Dumbledore.
Draco nods and says through gritted teeth, “Don’t you dare fucking let go, Potter.”
Draco nods against him. “Of course I’m okay.”
He winces as he straightens up. “It’s nothing. Really, it’s nothing. I need to,” He takes a deep breath. “I need to go back to the manor.” He’s suddenly aware of Potter’s grip on his bicep. “I need to apparate-,”
“Have lunch with me. Come to my office – tomorrow – it’s a half day so we can have a long lunch.”
Blaise shakes his hand. “You’re quite right – two years maybe?” He releases his hand and furrows his eyebrows in thought. “Pansy’s birthday, I think. How are you, Draco? What are you doing here?”
The reply comes quick.
He learns that Draco’s parents have plenty of money left in the Malfoy accounts to avoid working and travel instead.
Teddy laughs. “No way. I love Draco
Dean and Seamus shift uncomfortably in their seats, casting each other furtive glances and Harry ignores it, pulling out his phone again.
best friend grandma Andy.”
Harry scowls. “Oh, be quiet, Ted. I’m just eager is all.” His phone chimes and he nearly jumps out of his chair.
Augh. Someone send me art of a beautifully handsome Blaise <3
” Ron’s sharp tone snaps him out of drooling over Malfoy. He flips his phone, screen down on the bar counter and snaps his gaze to find four pairs of eyes staring at him incredulously. “There you are, mate.” Ron chuckles. “Lost you for a second there.” He nods. “Whatcha got on that cellyphone?”
Draco snorts. “Come on Blaise…” He sighs heavily and slouches deeper into the armchair. “Pansy, I can’t - I can’t go down that road again.”
Andromeda is suddenly quiet and she looks away, hesitating. “Harry?”
Harry shrugs. “I dunno. I haven’t thought about it.”
“Yeah.” She frowns. “He’s always on that muggle cell phone of his, and he’s always smiling. He seems lighter than he used to be, but at the pace Draco moves – Merlin knows if he’ll ever make a move.”
, athletic (
“Draco!” His mother surges forward and he drops the shards of glass to the floor. He’s gasping for breath, that feeling of drowning in freezing cold water again…
“Draco. I’m going to find out either way. I’m head of the Curse Breaker office. They send me a report of all cases. I’m the only one who can determine the severity. You might as well tell me yourself.”
Perhaps a cup of tea or something will help warm his bones enough to push through this feeling. He changes out of his clothes from the night before, putting on a worn Ravenclaw Alumni shirt, curtesy of one of his ex – well – on and off again fuck buddies, and a pair of fitted cotton sweatpants that gather at the ankles. He rinses out his hair, brushes his teeth and splashes water on his face.
It rings aggressively and he answers it quickly. “Um – hello?” Talking on phones was still so awkward.
Draco blushes furiously as he sets the oven mitts down. “Oh ha, ha, Potter. We’ll see who’s laughing when you have a taste. I’m kind of an amazing baker.”
“Yes, mom.” He tugs on Harry’s hand again. “Let me show you books!”
Harry is smirking at him. “Draco.” He leans against the wall. “Nice apron.”
Harry snorts. “Such a Slytherin to be so unfucking grateful.” Draco straightens out and Harry winces slightly.
“Say, Draco?” He looks over at Cormac. The broader man is giving him an appraising look and he plasters on what Draco imagines he intends to be a sultry look. “Fancy grabbing dinner?”
A throat clears and they snap their gaze to the doorway. Teddy’s got his arms crossed, a knowing smirk on his face. “What do we have here?”
Somewhere deep in their potions library is a spell to freeze a heart. Keep it from
Draco pulls away to look at him swallowing thickly. “I-,”
Ron frowns. “I’m not letting this slide, we’re gonna circle back to this.” He nods behind him. “I was trying to get your attention cause Seamus and Dean say they need to tell us something.”
They spend the next hour catching up with each other. He learns that Greg and Pansy have been hooking up for the better part of six months now.
