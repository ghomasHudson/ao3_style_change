"Yup," he heard Vampire say with a yawn.
He began his lesson with rather conspiratory theories and in a silent moment, as DR. Devork was turned to the blackboard to write you could her Drace mutter something like “He’s not that hot.”
She immediately blushed and turned her gaze away from her
Shed ben in the forest with crabb and coyle and then suddetly she wuz here, in another timeline?! Smh. But how?
They all split up and headed to their different classes; Ryan doing a short visit at the infirmary.
„What wuz it 4?",Dumbsedork asked.
„Hm, I mean kissing Hermine and now arguing with him?!“
Did she ay this out loud? Did Dawn know off her thought and feeltings?
She sighed.
"Interesting, and guess who attendz it 2?" Hermin sat down on the other sit of de table sothey facced each otter.
Hermoine wondered if Neville also had recognized this hesitation of Ryan, althpough he didnt knew her so well.
“YOU COULD SUMMON THE AVATAR HERE?!”
Dawn looked at her.
„I was more thinkin of us getin problems with the ministry of magic… we already are in big trouble if anyone finds out about the mutated vegetables.“, Snape explained. „We should go searchung for the missing students.“
Alright, alright, so what is that you demand to be catched upon?
"Yeah,its so loud here," Hermoine answered and they began to stack somefood on ther plates.
Hermine reached out 4 rons arm and they brought a little space between them and the boys.
_Even not your so good  friends enony, vampiro and draci?‘‘
„Gaaaaaaah“ Ryan threw her head back.
„Stop dos", he said. „Accio razor!"
„Why so grumpy?“, said the girl next to the first bich, lookin exactly da same as the first girl, just with blue lips. „You#re back in your hell-jole of a skull, wasn#t it whut u wanted?“
„But-“
“Ryan what’s wrong?”, he asked and set up again, although his painkillers wore off and it hurt a lot to move.
“Well…. Uhhh.”, he stopped, thinkin about ryan. But apparently she didnt want to talk to hm anymore, maybe he wasnt fancy enough enymore, now that h cudnt play quiddisch. But was she really that superficial? She didnt seem the tyoe actually and she was very cold towards him as he was playing his jockrole.
They both hadn#t to go to aany lessons for the next two ours, but both felt like they couldnt standkdis slice for the next 2 hours.
They heard her crying.
it was pitch black inside the forest, the small light of the lamp didnt help much, as they stumbled over roots and sticks ans stones.
It was cool outside as the girls headed out to the Quidditvh-field. Hermine and Ryan wore their Slytherin-Accesoires; Hermine wore black jeans with a glossy print snake pattern and a Shirt with a big S on the front which was twined around by a snake, a long black knitted jacket and her black coat and a green scarf; Ryan wore a simple ripped grey jeans and a Slytherin-hoodie with the houses emblem on the front, a vest over it , a plain black fluffy beanie and black plateau boots.
“Nerds.”, one of them said.
There were waiting Professor Snape, Dumblegork, Ebonu, Draco, Neville,Ryan, Crab and Goyle and some other students they didnt know.
Neville smiled and immeditely griaced his face in pain.
He looked at her from the corner of his eyes and smiled.
„Yeah...“, he looked at her, still not 100% convinced, but he just shrugged and went with her 2 the great hall.
„So...“ Ebony began and looked att Sathan. „Are you some sort of background character or…?“
Her heart raced, did he believe her lie?
Hermoine changed into a black jogging-pants and a bleached old, a little torn grey band shirt, You cpuldnt read the logo or see the motif anymore,but it was an old shirt from Arch Enemy, originally showing the words never foreget, never forgive in black on the front.
“Dr, Devorak?” Anger rose up inside of him, he could feel his face getting hot. “A teacher?”
„Especially Lucyus Malfoy will not be happy to hear his son is declared lost for now.“, said Severus wh had just been appearing in the rom.
„You-“, she began, but actuall4 didnt know whot to say.
They sat on each theyr beds, quiet.
But Dumbledore didn't answer, he couldn't because a student ran in and yelled: „Vampire Potter has was attacked by de leek!"
After this bitch had arrived everything at this scool had turned strangeand unusual – Vampire acted strange, as well as Draco!
They looked at each otha surprized and folloe'wed her silently toBumbleborks bureau.
They hadnt talked or even looked at each other when they went upstairs intheir room, finally having some free space of their, beloved butannoying girlfriend.
She wore a black dress with a turtleneck and black overknee-boots. Hershort cut black hair shimmered in the dimmed light of the common roomas well as her long moon-earrings. She put on her glasses and yawned.
„Maybe it had to watchem have sex and it flew because it was so awkward!, Hermoine hissedand Ryan almost fell off the bed laughing.
Vampire layed in a bed, smeared with blood and a big wound in the face and on the chest.
„Its a fucking leek!! A murderous leek!" Hermina laughed.
During the whole dinner time, Neville was sunk in his thoughts.
"Good, this applies to all of you", he said to the others. "Now let's begin... Potions and Magic Past(r)ies. It's an art to be able to bake and brew perfect magical foods and, on the other hand, very difficult. It requests concentration, practice and interest. To hook your attention from the very beginning we will begin with something you all may now – Bubbleblubbs."
„That‘s nit what I meant, it just came so….sudden and everything seems to...crash smehow...“
Neville let out a loud sigh and sunk back onto the bed.
Whot did he men?
“Sweety, I’m glad you’re excited.”, Jordan said slimingly as he wirled her around to look at him. With a quick move she escaped his grip and stumbled a few steps backwards into the infirmary.
Hewent to classes, as the normal school-programm continued as if nothinhappened. He entered the classroom for
„Ya know im sorry 4 kissin u.“, Draco said.
She smirked, this was one of Hogwarts secrets no outsider would ever be able to discover or use.
„No,Ebony, NO!" Vampire shoulder.
The guy looked at same silently for a couple of seconds and screamed „Sparkle!“, then he turned int2 a bat and disappeared into the darkness, so they could not c him anympore.
Neville stepped to the winow and looked around (
„Oh no I dont mean sleep with me! More like, sleep next to--“
„Dont you dare hitting him.“, Vampire reülied.
They had been walkin through the woods 4 some hours now and nothin else had happened, raco and Vampire, silently hold hands and Rin and Hermine treid to avoid lookin @each otter, folliwing the boyzz.
“But he’s kinda cute tho.”, Tina said, blushing. She wore a short dark blue velvet dress that Jinx had suggested to try out.
Hermoine wore black shorts and a simple black shirt and a necklace with an ouija-board planchette. [
„We should go.“, she said again and headed in the direction they had come from.
Both were unable to sleep, although eboby wasnt there to complain aboutthe world as she always did the last times. She was in a girls room,because the teachers did not allow a mixxed girl-boy room inHigwarts.
Ryan braided har long hair, staring n the insides of her close.
„Honey, you really should listen in muggle-studies, we just talked about it last week!“, Tia said, slightly frustrated, Jinx couldn#t even answer because she was shook to da core because - Tina had called her honey.
2Wait, where are the two idiots?“, he asked and they looked around.
„I understand, you always were more a special type, not alone in clothin'", Ryangrinned. „Hey, did ya hear whos the new teacher here at schol?"
She picked it from he branch and a letter apperead magically in her hands as she held the necklace.
"Oh Hermine is that you?", Ron, eh- Diablo, asked.
She wore a dark-red lacedress with matching lacquered high heels. Her black eyeliner framedher dark-green eyes and her long natural-red curls fell over herback.
The next mourning was sunny but cloudy at the same tim.
„Thanks you helped my sis!" she said and kissed him on the cheek (leaving behind a black lip-print on the cheek). She then turned to her sister agsin.
„Oh no, it‘s not appropriate for a girl and a boy to share a rom here.“
Ryan still stared draco down, who just nodded and urried to his seat in the last rows.
Ryan and Hermoine went to a classroom.
Drace stared into the darkness, feelin completely numb.
„Ebony," Vampires aid so quietly that she didnt even hear him. He shook his head, hedidnt even knew what had happened, Ebony brew this potion on her own,he didnt knew the ingredents or what she had done at all. Thismorning she just said she wanted to show him sumthin and they went tothe Glasshouse outside.
"Not sure yet,"Herione answered and they both looked at the front again, it wasdead-silent, everybody seemed frozen and not sure what to do.
Ron looked at them from the end of the second row, slightly enviouos.
"Professer>Dumbledork!!11#", she screamed and ran to the front.
In another Room of the Slyherin tower, Vampire lyed awake in his bed,strarring at the ceiling of his rom and Drake lying in the bed nextto Vampires, staring out of the windows.
“Oh my goth you’re s0 hot!”, some student said into the confused and depressing silence and cut him off.
So they went 2 history class, but weren#t quite interested in the subject. Hermoine thought about viktor krum all the time, she was worried about Ryan.
Ryan stepped out of the door, she had wished a shortcut to the infirmary and the room of requirements helped her get there.
Neville and some others begann attacking the leeks before they could hurt the piknicking students who were running away and try to fleed.
“He… hes just like the others.”
But first things first - (a very late) Happy New Year!
Hermino also hanged her cloothing into a black knee-shprt dress with aswingong skirt and bones all ova it, also with a v-nack but not asdeep as ryans. Black matte pumps (18cm and plateauoo) to completethe look.
„Draco, listen, I know u luv him, an you sure do 2. Just because youre insecure or because youre both changing does not mean that youre not meant 2 be 2getha.“, she looked at him, seeing that he believed hr.
They hadnt been able to find the leek and did not find a way out of the forest.
„Sure he's this magician with this factory for magic-sweets and things."
„YUP.", Ebony pouted.
Needless 2 say that they didnt go to their rooms seperate, but that Hermine went with Ron to his rom.
"Ya hera her scream!" she begann laughing. "Nobody was ever able tomake her explode like this in the past years."
“Yeass.>”, Izora sput aut  and managed to smile a litle, her heart still pounding, she fe like having a heart attakc.
“Nevertheless, f he…. Liked… me he wouldnt let her,….”, Ryan murmured, nearly letting the tears fall from her heart.
“Kinda.” Hermoine nodded, she wore black and white striped shorts with suspenders on them and a black top, violet boots. Her hair was freshy dyed mint green. Somehow she liked to actually dye it more, than to use a spell to change the colour of her hair. Ryan had been really excited to help her for she didn’t knew this was a thing at all, because Ryan wasn’t a muggle born as Hermoine.
Ryan didnt answer but smiled just vaguely - what was with this gurl???
„Neville!“, she said neverthelez and stood up sloly to go hug him.
The time after that flew past, till the end of the lesson.
The conversation uff the teacherss was rather unspectaclular. They wanted to send another squad to look 4 ebuny, but werent sure which students they culd send in the forest again.
' promise me you won't tel anyone‘‘
Hewas such such an asshole, both off tham!
, Izora thought, taking a short look at Dawn.
2 quite.
?!", Hermine asked hatfully.
He such an arrogant jock!, Ryan thought.
"Getta outta my wy1!!!!" screeched Ebony and they jumped on the side afraid.
"but... I dunno, it all sound a bi artsy-fartsy to me, ya kno?% which animal,you thingk yare, huh/?  I mean ya should know and nobody would ever consider himself as some deey or boring animal, would they?"
An awkward silence appeared and they both didnt kno were too look.
Ths cannt go on like dis, he thogut, locking out the windiw..
“I took a walk before class, I felt sick.”
„Ouch!“, she screemed and it dropped on the floor.
"Miss Dementia Raven Way, you're too late," Mr Wonka said. "Minus ten points for Slytherin."
„That‘s really sweet of you but I‘m good for now.“, she said.
It was so scary to be here.
“No, it’s alright, thank u 4 yer honestry.”
„Get the fuck outta my way and dont come near me!“, you could hear Ryan scream in the early mornin hour before the frst lesen.
She made her haair in a bun and slipped in an oversized black shirt with a white crescendmoon on da front, black ripped shorts, black knee socks and blacklaquer plateau boots. She put on dark violet lipstick, nearly balckbut glancing in the light with a ceratain shimmer of violet. Blackeyeliner and violet nails and long black earrings in form of acrescend moon too completed her look. She took her black leatherbasckpack from the door and hushed outside, hopping not to wake upher roommaze.
„Ah, yeah right i hat totally forgotten about it..“, Neville nodded. „But in this condition i wont be able 2 go anywhere.“
“Oh it’s you again.”, she heard one of the black haired prep-girls say. “Hermoines friend”
„Why is that btherin u? Don‘t u want me anymore just because I dont want to be a porrly written gothic-character anymore?“, Harry turned around and looked him straight in the eyes.
"IT RAN AWAY??" Mcgonogol shooted. "WTF?!?! "
(See the end of the chapter for
„I dont know, I felt responsible somehow.“ He didnt look @ drasco.
Fleur, still standing with Neville, looked at them rather uninterested.
„Thanks for helpin me. I thought u dont like me.“, he said.
"mine too," Vampire said. "Just as you are." He turned his hadtowards Draco and saw his green eyes shining in the dark. (romantican erotci bi guys moment *-*)
Vampire and Draco both wanted to say somthing but he interruptes them bywaving his hand.
„Yeah, and they also wanted to ask the beaux Batton-school to send someone, I think they also talked about this girl, whots her name – fleur beton?“, Ryan continued
„Yeah.",she said felling obviously uncomfortable. She didnt undastand why hewas now talking to her at alle. She noticed his slightky differentstyle of clothing, somethin had changed, he seemd different to hernow.
Ryan looked at him suoer annoyed for he had been talkin all the time for the last ten minutes. Even Neville, who was used to listen to people telling him uninteresting stuff, seemed annoyed.
“They’re clearilng flirting with him, arn’t they.”, sha asked her friends with a devilish twinkle in her eyes. “Bet neville will be interested in this.”
They headed to the great hall to eat diner.
"NOW WHAT?!" yielded McGoonagul.
„Whatcha mean?“ Draco looked at Ron hatefully.
She didnt know what time it was or how lng they had been in those damn woods.
They looked at each ther in silence, like a secret circle formed, whomst no one should ever know abaout.
After a long hour of searching and not findung them, they took a short break. They sat down on a fallen tree, it ws really cold out here and hermine freezed.
„What if they do not come back?“, McGoogle was worried.
„They were asked to help us, and for the fact that they are from another school, we may not take any egal action against them.‘
„I think we should totally make it a thing to hit im at least once in every of the following chapters, dint cha think?“, she corrected her glasses and smiled. She wore a shirt with dark ¾ sleeves and a white torso, pale blue jeans and black/hite sneakers and she looked super innocent.
McGonogalshook her head, but didnt respond.
Yours sincerely, BuriedPhoenix <3
„Draco, htink.“, she said, annoyed. „Think about it. You may think im cute or beautiful or whatsoever, but think about who u really love.“
Whot?“, askd nevill.
"BARBIE?!" Enoby shriekked, Vampire and Draco also looked at them with openmouths.
It was so awfull! Everything was shit! I mean, she hadn‘t been changin her clothes for like 2 days, she felt tired and annoyed  and draco and harry were nowhere near at all (she didnt want them around either, but she wanted to see ‚em so she could tel them to fuck off for leaving her).
The title has my immortal in it, what do you expect?
Dawn stil hat her ice fixed on her buok.
The lesson seemed as it wouldnt end to the girls, something was just odd about having classes when there was like a war goin on and they felt like floating in a constatnt state of danger.
She stood up and looked him right in the eye.
"You happy you came back?" Ryan asked, still starring a little blankly at her friend.
He didnt anse´wer, he just locked @her with his mud green eyes. (A/N mud green because of the bugs, as you maybe remember in twilight the vampires drinkin human blood had red eyes, the cullens who drank animal blood had golden eyes and bugs make eyes green just because :P)
She decided to quietly take her leave, because she wanted to avoid another confrontation, as she felt a hand on her shoulder .
Hello people of the world wide web,
The boy woth the black hair that also laied in the drt looked at her.
* what?:
While talking they passedthe big hall and made their way to the Slytherin-house.
The teachers nodded and hagrid went inside the forbidden frest.
They crossed the boatbatoaux girls.
He did not hear her scream at draco.
Y'all can think,of what happens next, so - yeah.
They all looked at each other, angry, and not convinced at all.
He heard about what happenedd to Vampire, but he couldnt bring himself to go to the infimrary to see how he was doing.
„Nothing.“, answered Ryan, shaking a little. „It‘s alright… will you ttend class already? Shouldnt you stay in the informarx a little longer?“
"Miss Raven Way!" Mr. Wonka said.
“He flirted with those bauxbatune girls, esspecially their biss-bitch fleur.”
„Longbottom got injurted but miss lightwood is altright.“
[1] A
(Black eyeliner Wednesday (or whatever day it is now))
„What?No, we cant put him in this danger, he still injured," McFooglesaid.
„Let's go to slep," Hermoineá said. „Lets talk about it tomorrow."
Hehehe...
„BOMBANU!"yielded vamoire and the door crashed open.
If they fond the leackh already?, she ough and turned to da site,
“Aight lets go.”; hermoine said, while dr devorak again tried to hold all the stuuff in his arms.
„What is it?“
Harry gt up first, witohoug a word he grabbed his bag and disappeared out of the room, heading to the librARY.
„Hey, draco? Aswer me?! WTF!=", he heard her scream, but didnt stop.
„Since youre living in this forest, do u know where the leek is or the leeks?“, Neville asked. „They are mutated and murder the students.“
"Whot?" Dumbledoor looked up as if he had been sleeping and was now awake. "Whoatswrong??"
No clue, huney, but here, have this-
„Do u want us to stay 4 a while or do u wont 2 try 2 sleep?§“
. He noticed that it was still pretty early, just a small group of girlsast in the room chatting.
„Hey."
Shes like from another world, he thought, yet not relly different from the others here.
„What did you put inthis potion?" asked Snape effervescing and hit his hands on thetable, his black cape flaunting over his shoulders [
A wicked smile passed Tinas lips and she merged into the darkness.
Harry and Draco also were still inside the forest and had a lot of time to talk and do… other things...(A/N: Talk to me; Like lovers do…. * playing here comes the rain again by eurythmicsTM©*))
"Hofw waff youf couf??"Ryan asked with food in her mouth.
He had a bleedin wound in on the head because he had been fallin on a stone, and another bleedin wound across his face whitch was from th leek.
The small razor blade flew out of ebonys hand through the room into vamires hand, cutting himself. „Fuck!" he screamed.
He leaned forward and kissed her passionately.
She lifted her gaze and now recognized the girls, they were te beauy ateon girls that bullied hermoine ealiers.
A glimming explosion tore booth off them 2 da ground, violet smoke hung in the air around them. They looked around cnfused, the time turner was shattered t ashes and wuz forgotten be4 they could search for him.
He blinked and looked at evony.
„All in all, yes, but she is so dumb and stupid, she would even make it worse," Dawn answered.
"Minus ten points for Slytherin," Mr Wonka just growled and turned to the cupboard again to write down the homework for next leson.
She wanted to answer, but a loud scream forced itself through the darkness off the knight.
She had told him these were protection-spells and he had believed her (beacause he had been emotionally unstabl and not the best student, as said).
„But why cant we like – restrain him within the schools rules??“ Isora crossed her arms.
Was this real?
It had felt so good to being hold in his arms but... it sure was just some sort of affect he just had. He would never have real feelins 4 her,he was a jock, he would hurt her, just as her ex. While Neville was thining about the whole ordeal Ryan picked up his wand, which he lost during the leek attack.
Hermione stood there in front of the door, waiting for Ryan and Dawn, whilst chatting with the black-haired Ravenclaw girl from her
He couldn't believe his eyes and turned around on his heel and left.
It was a pale guy – a vmpire- half bat half human, munching bugs he caught outta the air.
Fleurs grin grew wider.
“Yer late.” Ryan saif.
On top ef Hermoines case was also a cage, but a far smoller one, wth arat sittung in it. His Name was Karl and his left ear was black, buteverything else was white.
Izora leaned back on the dark-green velvet-couch, and sighed; she wore aband-shirt from
As he entered the rom (he taught a special class very early on wednesday mourning) he wore slim black leather pants, black laced up leatherboots, a white shirt with puffy sleeves and a blsck cloak, that floated elegantli as he swung it over the chair.  His shirt was… well...how do we put it...(to make yu feel the same cringe as the students)...well he unbottened it nearly completely to expose his mmuscular torso (with hair on it).
„Miss Callahan.“, said Professur Mcgonogal, who approached from tda back. „Plz pay attention to your choice of words, especially in front of our guests.“
„Was this the leak?“, Ron asked.
Ryan shivered.
„You seem even more depressed than ever! So why are you nit goffikanymore?", Eboy shouted behind him. „Do you want 2 tell me thatyou gothic-image was just fake?"
Less ho, she said. She betted he wuz insuffrABLE hen he wurz hungray.
“So whut, we ust wont gettaa caught.” Ebntu hopped of er ber and swung her ewand, changing her outfiz into a black lace corset with non-matching velvt skiirt, violet platea shoes, black fishnets and red striped legwarmers.
“Oh dr devorak, how nice seeing ou, is mr wonka not feeling well?”
They went uo to the hospital and looked inside the big room.
"Yeah maybe..," said Ryan thinkingly.
Hermoines outfit today was a black off the shouder roll top and black leather pants. She had her mint-green hair in a bun and wore earrings witch (goddit!) locked like silver snakes twining around a black agate stone. She wore black eyeliner and had painted dots under her eyes.
He let out a silent sigh and set his head ión his folded arms.
Needless to say that they just cuddled because they were 2 exhausted 4 anythin else todo.
Howwuld it go on ith the tree of them?
„MALFOY!" she screamed and slapped him.
„Try to remember thestuff you poured in it, kiddos, we need to know to maybe find out howwe can defeat the evil vegetable. And what did exactly happen? Maybewe can find out what is the plan of the leek."
„Were alr8.“. Ron answerd. „Butt we dunno where vampire and draco are or ryan and Neville or anyone else, wave lost 'em.“
„oh, its u, oh yeah... ill be fit in a couple of days again, hah.“, he said nervously. „Ryan is okay, she didnt get hurt. I think she fell asleep la while ago“
Every body knew the story of the strange vampire guy who didnt drink blood but eating bugs just like most of the regular bat.species actually do.
„Oh fuc t!“, she said. „Come, hurry, you need 2 get help“
It had felt so good, but... she wuz sure he doesnt mean it, she didnt want 2 be a number on the long list of gurlz he had been kissing or having sx with or somehting...
"Some of the students did experiments with the vegetables and now... and NOW...!" shescreamed and nearly suffocatet.
„Ron?“, she asked. „Watche mean?“
„Alright.“, said Satan as McGonogull floatet out of the room.
On the door of their room hung both their backpacks and bags.
"Wanna come over here?" Vampire asked flirtingly. "Cuddle?"
Hotlil green haired demon, he thought.
She just nodded quietlyy and went to the bathroom to change, although the thought of uniforms let her little goffik heart shrink.
Ebonty, she thought and squinted her eyes hatefully, dis little bitch, talking behind herback as soon as she had left for her exchange trimesters. They hadbeen close friends, by that time Hermine went by the Name B#loodyMary in Ebonys circle of friends.
“Wait!”
On the place where the hut had been there waz…. Nothin????
„How daru u? Dis lipstick is frum a top brand, u little brats couldnt even afford!“ the blue lipped whale said.
E/N: Very short chapter ahead.
They sat outside on a small ruin near the black lake, the sun slowly sat as they stared to the horizon.
„Devil darnit.“, she said and looked at  her book. „Hope I didnt damage it.“ She run her fingers across the cover, decided everything was alright and looked at ryan.
"Awww,do your lil friends have to fight for you," Hermoine grinned. "Youstart and they have to do the dirty work for you?"
Right?
„You know it‘s never easy to develop from a flat to a round character within a few chapters...“ Harry looked away.
„Eh... are you a new student?“, he asked and stood up. >He flipped his black hair back sexily, as he hod out his hand to help her up. He wore a black  IN THIS MOMENT-shirt with red print and blue ripped jeans.
We wish you a Happy New Year 2018 and hope you come back next year to visit us here again to see how the story's going on ;)
„Ron....“
He flew to her to help, she tripped over and the leek came closer and closer and she coul not stand up because she sprained her ancle.
She went past the Quidditch team, which came in from practicing, Neville talking to the others. He looked up as Ryan nearly flew down the stairs, he had heard her screaming.
„Ya know I was a boy-scout when I was younger.“, said Tom, the quiddith guy. „Iam super good in reading tracks, although im not sure how to find a leek in the dark, ya know? Haha.“
“What? For whom?” Why was he reacting like this, he was a mystery for himself. She wasn’t his girlfriend, well they got along good for a while, but… why did it hurt to hear thus?
Hermine sat down beside a Ravenclaw gurl with short black hair and sharp winged eyeliner.
"It was Ebony Ravenwayx and Vampire Potter!" MRS Sprout screamed, still nearly suffocating.
Ron left Ebony alone with herself and her thoughtss.
„I think u know... I mean why you were so angry at Darco... „
"Soladies n gentlemen, open your recipe-books at page 69"
“Not that you have clue what you’re talking about ayways, eh?”
He just turned to Ron again and didnt bother her at all.
„Are u a prep now?!" Etony gasped.
It was a wild ride between the story of the plague, the possible influence of the plague on the development of dark arts and alchemy, diverse herbs, goats, leeches and the fact that you can’t see your shadow in the dark.
Dr. Devorak flohnced into the room, today wearing a dark bloody red shirt, and a black, jeans, straghter than him.
Neville watched their retreating backs, a fluttering feeling in his heart,whitch left him confused. With one hand still on his cheek he whispered to noone in particular, "What the heck?"
With the easy of a thousand year old sul sh spoke some magic furmolas and their opponents didnt mention, tlll it was 2 late.
„Look att him.“, hissed hermina. „Look at thes egg-headed mushroom.“
Ryan couldnt talk but just point at the window, through witch now fell pale moonlight.
"Oh,do you already leave? Whot a pity," Ebony said sarcastically andlooked at them hatefully.
„Why did you even want to come with us, Vampire?“, asked hermine, because the rising tension between the boys annoyed her.
Ron gave Draco scathing glances, while carying the lamp.
So this was actually all that happened today.
She remembered the time they were close friends before he god influnced by all dispreppy-wannabae-gothick-stuff ebbubbu and her friends poisened thisschol with. Even Dumbledore, this ol fool, tried to be cool and fitin this gothic-stuff-thing, she thought, shacking her head.
„Ohyeah," Ryan said. „I had totally forgoten bout it."
Hello, People of the Internet!
Wadda happened today?
Itwas silent, Drako didnt answer him
“Come close to us one more time and I will tear your tongues and eyes out and let the ravens feast in them!”, Jinx yelled at them, as the fleet.s
Heroine saw him and looked as he came closer.
Ron put his arm around her shoulders and she moved closer 2 him.
All students, regardless of age or house, scurried across de floors,afraid of the murderouuus creature.
“Very quick, very good miss lightwood.”, Dr. devorak said while picking the stuff out of the air.
“Jack? No..Kay?”, one of them said, pointing to Ryan. “Some boys name right?”
So some of the leeks go up in flames or explode with scrieching,horrible noises.
„Maybe because youre always hanging out togetha,“ Hermoine said,
„Oh, no problem, if heres no room for her, she can stay wif me, my roommate changed skull so in my room is an empty bd.“
They waited for Hermine and Jinx who wanted to spy on the teachers who had a discussion in Dumbleborks room about how to deal with the leek, which was still at large.
She stood up of the couch to look outside the windu.
„Thanks, Ma'am.", Ron said, slightly emberrassed because he did not mean to ask it out soloud. Hermine could even see from her seat that he became a littlered on the cheecks.
„That#s true, Miss Lightwood.“
"Fuckin prep, shut up you bitvh!" Eboni hissed, but the Hufflepuff girl just shook her head silently and smirked at her knowingly.
„Did you know that in America everybody is allowed to have a gun and that many kids die because of school shootings?“ Tina looked at tham.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you to our first lesson about Sigils, their meaning, theirhistoire, how to use them. At the end of this course you all shouldbe able to create sigils for yourself, but first, some basics."
„Im sure he does, it is also a strange time 4 him at the moment and u should stick togetha instead of fighting.“
„Effin jock.“ Hermine continued.
“So is that a know?”
Ebony just nodded.
“Uuuuh, who  it? You know Im known at mah skull for being quite the amor!” Fleur laughed, a high pitched, fake laugh, that probably sounded friendly eand cheerish for other pebbles.
They headed to the grandstand and searched for a god pplayc to watch th match.
“No.” He swallowed, pressing his exelits shut.
He looked at her in shock as the time turner in her hand grew insanely hot.
„Hi.",she replied, not looking at him.
„Im not sure... I... saw you two kiss and...“ He shrugged. „I dont like the thought of u kissin him.“
„Whaddaya mean?“ he didnt look at hr, he exactly knew what she menat but dindt want to talk bout it.
„There was a screamin...thing!“, she stuttered as he helped her getting up.
The nw teacher was a doct0r, a really tall man with dark shaduws around his eyes, dark auburn, flouncy hair and of considerable stature.
Neville looked surprised, he didn't expect such a harsh answer from a girl.
What? Do you really think I rmember every little bit I tell in this risiculous story of this?
„Ebony should go she is the cause for all this," Izora said, sitting on Ryans bed.
„You dint remember? The strange violet smoke, and us fullin to the ground?“
Ryan looked after them, not sure what just happened.
Long story short: they ended up in the same rom.
“Oh wait! Letme guess!” Fleur exlamatet and looked thoughtful, shrinking her arms and planting a finger at er lips.
„Maybe.“ Hermine said, when suddenly the earth started shaking and ripped, a deep abyss opened and seperated the group.
"ya know it is something I just can tel you, b because e were so close friends before you were kidnapped and then went to beaux badtoes"
„But didn't you tell methis was Snafes subject?", she asked. „What does he do now?"
Ok, so to speed things up, of course Jinx was totally down for Tina, and we‘ll bring them toghetether, wahoo!
„What have we to do with this bithces problems? You want to put us all indanger just because of
"Styx ,go for flight, huh, Ryan said in the moment and went to the windowwith the cage. She opened it and Styx hopped out of it, stretched hiswings and flew away.
She cleared her throat and slapping on the back of her book.
"Nobody ever argued with me because of being late," she said aggressively.
“No, no, everythings fine.” He said, just in this moment everything fell down.
„Sh.“, Ryan said alarmed. „I think I heard somethin.“
She had been so tense and let out a shocked scream.
„Can't ya c?" Hermineasked and turned herself for her freind. „Not as boring as it wasb'fore i left huh?"
Hermione nodded
Dawn sat there reading
She t00k a l0ok over her sholder to c Fleur patting and gently touching Nevills arm, saying something like she should tak3 a look after her friends and she would come to see him later. The blonde girls gestures also were really flirty and… intimate?
“Are you thristy?”, She had heard (A/N I know it is rare she remembers school stuff or anything that has to do the slightest bit with education or facts, but somehow even this dumb nut has to contribute something to the story sometimes), so she heard that some Vampreez were sensitive to the moon-circle too, a little bit like werewolfes.
„I cant remember“ He squinted and shock his head.
But she didnt get a response (A/N: of course) .
„Damn.“, said professur mcgonogal at the end of the lesson. „Since miss ravebway is missin, the class is much mot´re quite and we somehow have a better work attitude here. Well so it also has its good side “ she looked around. „if anyone asks, i never said that.“
Everybody screamed and ran away and tried to escape the grandstand-tower whitch was falling together.
Love couldnt save people
She shivered again, she wuz wearin just a black ripped jeans, black boots, a blck shirt with a witchy prit on da front, black woolen cuffs and a wool coat, but she froze, it was gettin cooler because winter wuz ahead.
„Oh“, Ebony cut him off desperatly. „U know dumbledoor, hes a little pld and strange and forgetful sometimes...$
Behind them followed Dr. Devorak, slamming the door shut and pulling on his black leather gloves
Hermine was in front of the Hufflepuff tower, so he decided to go there.
„Kind of.“ He laughed and looked at her with his moss green eyes. He was so handsome and looked exactly like matthew lewis (if u dunno who he is, f*ck off (to look it up)).
"Shut up, Barbie," Ryan said and sticked out her tongue.
"What a bitch, whore, wanna-be.whatever!" Ebony screamed when she, drakiand Vampire left and went for a walk outside in the nightly mist. Shescreamed and shouted for quite a while, Vampire and Draco were silentand just listened to her bad rant. In the last times she justexploded like all five minutes and they were rally annoyed of hermoad de last weeks. The boys looked at each other quietly, wishingthey had some time for just themshelves (
The room cleared quite quickly, till only hermoine and ryan remained because their necxt class would be in the room next door
“BITCH, remember what I said in Chapter 17?” Tina looked displessed
"Wh...?? HOW!?"
The teachers told them to go in groußs of at least 3 persons and groupedthem as they thought it would work best – so: Ryan, Neville and aboy who they were told was also a member of the SlytherinQuidditch-team; Hermine, Ron and Draco as group two, Ebony and Crapand Goyle; and also the unknown others were grouoed in grops of 3.
Have fun with this new wonderful and grammatically correct chapter!
„Okay… I can understand but… I have a question...“
“C’mon.”
„I… I maybe should go...and get some rest...“, she said and wated to turn around.
They passed the group of goths near the door.
„Vampire!" she screamed, blod pouring outta her eyes. The red liquid dropped from her chin on her pink corset and short leather shorts.
“You better should tho, it’s not my job to reminded u off stuff you told not long ago”
Drama much? I'm done with my cup o'drama for today, how was your day so far?
"no, no, I really mean it, this goff stuff  got sorta wrong for me, I dunno, bit I really think I am an otherkin.*, he axpleined. "I mean hey, in this alternate potter-universe there are vampires and wrrewolfes, centrairusse and stuff, so why not being a reincarnation of an animal-soul in a humans body, huh?"
Mcgonogal stood up elegantlyy.
Ryan chuckled, today she wore just an oversized Icon for Hire-bandshirt and ripped shorts and a black leggins undernath and black docmartins shoues and black handcuffs. Her make u wuz also simle, just black eyeliner and blacklips tody.
Neither him nor ryan saw the sly smile on fluurs fac, as she disappeared into the hallway.
"One of the leeks MUTATED!" [
Hermoine and Ryan headed to their classes, they had all lessons together.
In the freetime it was only allowed to go to the house-common room, but not allowed to gooutside and sitt in the yard or hang around in the hallways.
Somehiw he felt weirs.
After a while they decided to go back to the schull, it had no sense to remain here.
Some giggled, which made him blush a little more, but he caught himself fast and straightened his back.
She turned too the side and leaned against a wall, he seemed not to notice her.
Good mournin.”. Ryan mumbled, seeing dr devorak baöancing diverse books and objects in his arms. “You need help?”
[2] eng.: fire precautions
„I could have defeated the olant easily just by myself, there was no need for u 2 hrelp.“, he said.
„Nevil, are u alright? Whot happnd?“, Hermine went inside the room and he was shocked for a short moment because he didnt expect anyone to be around.
Jordan tried to lay an arm aroud her but she ducked away.
So how do you guys think it will go on? Any characters you hope/ expect/ wish to have cameo appearences in the following chapters?
Although she cudnt make her way in peace, for Jordan was preying n her again.
„What happened?“, Ebony asked, rubbing her eyes because f th bright light that just ffaded toghetha with the violet smoke.
Enjoy the new chapter <3
She sighed and closed her eyes, smeared with black eyeliner, still walcin around.
And aso, nobody knew where she came from, not even herself.
Sje looed distressed, but he didn#t bother talkt ot her,
It wuz pitch bl4ck outside, the full moon wuz covered by cloudz and so all lied in a greyish light, even the stars locked pale and dusty.
„Oh Professur Mcgoogle.“, Satan said as thex entered the great hall and nearly bumped into the vice-principal.
The next day rose in the first glance of autumn.
But she didnt
Hermoine, Ryan, Tina and Jinx went outside, to spent time outside.
„I dont.“, she answered. „But as I said, I will forever be thankfull that u rescued ma sister.“
They walked over the dewy meadow.
[1] Great Grey Owl (lat. Strix nebulosa, documented as the worlds largest species of owl, by length. It can be found in the northern hemisphere, but can also be found in the eastern ans western hemispheres. This owl is also known by the names Phantom of the North, cinereous owl, spectral owl, Lapland Owl, spruce owl, bearded owl or sooty owl. / Media.
“Like a werewolf, urghhh.” the other one made vomiting voices as they ran away.
“Well, they looked like they got along were well the otter dya-…..” Fleur sounded innocent and she really fooled Neville. He felt ike he cudnst thing straight!
And Ryan had told Hermina every single bit about it.
Giggling they went off the other way.
He wanted to say sorry to hermoine, he had believed what ebony had said about her and had been really angry. He couldnt magine hermoine would have done this, and in the end it was not true too.
„I think this is the guys. WERE HERE!“, she screamed and headed in2 the way the voices came from.
“Ryan and Neville?” Jinx was puzzled. “What about them? Ryan doesnt particularly like quidditch… or sports...or guys like him...”
She wanted to hiss on them but was too exhausted and confused to say somethin, she held her head in her heands.
Before she could turn awayagain, Draco looked her in the eye.
„So what are we gonna do know?" McGoggle asked.
„We dont remember!",Vampire said rebelious and stacked his armsd. He wore a dark-greyMCR_shirt which was ripped and black jeans with a red pattern on it.
“h yeah bout that, mr wonka doesnt feel good and asked me to hold his lesson instead.” He slapped the pile off bocks, nearly knocking them ove again.
She was super cute and Jinx had such a huge crush on her, I can‘t even tell.
„You seem distracted, whot are you thinkin about?“, Ryan asked and flipped a flat stone over the lkes surface.
Ryan cut her off.
„Alright then, it is merely dawn, we should go.", Snapp said, just as thedoor flung open – it was Vampire!
„All this prep-emo-gothic-wathever fuck I dont care, I am ME, not what youor anyone else defines me ti be," he growled, and took out his bloody red contact lenses and put on his glasses.
He didn’t answer so she tock this as a ye.
Hermoine followed jinx and tina to the front row. Hermoine wore a black shirt with a white print that sai I do what I f*ckin want featuring a cat who hold up her middle fingers; red shorts and black overknee boots. She wore her mint-green hair short and had put on a burgundy-brown lipstick that was slightly darker than her shorts (her underwear: nonexistant probably, but that would be too nsfw, so lets say it‘s a grey sports bra and a red panty (diff colour from her short)).
She went to the room for the
Hermoine waited for an answer.
„It‘s no help, this is finite and pointless. Their love wll never change a bit...“ She pused. „But...what if...“ she tore her eycs. „What if they had never met? What if they never had the chance to fall in love…?“
He teachers decided to patroll at night to catch the leek.
Ryan wore black ripped jeans, a black crop top, a red leather jacket and dark grey leather boots.
Drip Drop, down the steps of old wooden staircase.
Afew minutes later the furst injured students came 2 the infirmary and he left, he couldnt stand too many people at the moment. He maneuvered through the crowd of talkin students which filled the floors and the Sytherin common room.
We hope you‘ll enjoy this (still quite short) chapter and maybe this‘ll bring you some joy, thanks for sticking with us through this story!
Of course that this bitch Hermoinie cam back, tht all er friends left her… but first of all that Vampire and Drago rejected her.
„We are, dont forget, I‘m Slytherins Seeker, if I can catch the golden snitch, I will find a way out of here.“, Harry answered.
„You‘re a jock.“, she said, wallked over to the bed and took off her goat and shoes. Then she looked up. „Watcha waitin‘ 4? Let‘s get to sleep.
But what was thsis?????
Neville swallowed. He knew they didnt get along well so…
“The fuck” someone muttered in the back.
„Have fun? WTF?“, Ryan whispered and all nodded in agreement.
Hermoine entered the room and took a seat next to Ryan.
„Thats not the point.", Snape answered from the shadows. „It is the factthat you are very skilled and we need you to solve the problem. Andsecondly this strengthens the sense of community in theSlytherin-house."
The enxt week had some surprises ready 4 the students of Hogworts.
Dumblebore nodded thinkingly.
“Oh this book is so stupid.”, Dawn closed it shut with a bored, jet dsgustad look on her face. “The guy is like oh should I tell her, should I ell her not that I love her, what will she thiiiiink, stupid hetero shit….”
„U know, I think u owe me a little more than this 4 rescuing ur sister.“
"what?* she turned around and looked at him, her long dark blue hair fallin over her shoulders.
“She touched his arm and laughed so stupidly, and he… he just let her….”
Tina and jinx sat next to hermoine and Ryan, they didnt have much tome chattin before class started.
]and could not bear to be with anyone. His rage brought him deep in the castle of Hogwarts. He hadnt realized it was getting dark outside and becoming late, until he found himself in a cold, dark floor, allsalone and two blood red glowing eyes staring at him out of the shadows.
She wore leggins with stars and skull on em and a dark loose fit burgundy shirt.
Thn he realized whot he just said.
„Why does it even bother u?“, Ron grumbled.
A bit shorter than usual...
„Lumos.“, Vampire said and the tip of his wand began glowing.
Wear your masks and stay safe guys <3
-class.
She looked up at him, his eyes looked back and forth between the blackboard and the cranky notes he took.
“No, it’s forbidden.”, satan said indefinitely.
„Its ok," dawn said in a quiet vouce. „He helped." She pointed at Nevolle.
"it is" he looked at her with a certain glance in this eyes.
„Gt outta my wy!!"Enobyshooted at some of the kids who ran ofer the floirs. She had beenlurkin at the door of the infirmary were Draco sat woth Vampire.
They walked through the door of the classroom, just a few other peepz sat around, beneath others Hermoine, Jinx and Harry and Draco and Ron.
„Oh Yeah? And why?“
Hermoine sat on the window seat, whictch was very wide so you could sit comfortable on it. She opened the windu and leaned black on the wall,a black fluffy pillow between her and the cold stone wall. She lither cigrette, looking outside the window, tracking the still fading sunlight.
“Sooooooo, Neville, I heard you were still singel, yeh?” Fleir blinked her eyelashed and looked at neville, who still had a few days in the infirmary. She took his hand.
Now she remembered! She went with ron to his rom because she wouldnt go alone to hers! And Ryan was in the infirmantry with Neville who had been attacked by a leek!
Oh my goth! Thank y'all für 400 hits already!!!
No, no, no.
"I think he doesnt get why you're angry at him," she said. "Althopugh theyre arrogant, we maybe should ssee the match tommorrow against Griffindork (< geddit??!)"
"Hey oh my goth were room-mates, yaaas!" Ryan shooted as thesy lookedat the plates on the doors to de berooms to find theirs. they enteredthe green.silver decorated bedroom in which their bags and all dastuff they brought with them was. Two big black ornamented casesstood on the end of the beds, one was Hermoine's, the other ons Ryan's.On top of Ryan's case was a cage with a Great Grey Owl [1] in it. Hisname was Styx.
"Pfffff," hissed Ryan, who obviously was enranged because she just thought of the quidick boys as pretentious, self-centered idiotss. "Who does he think he is?"
(See the end of the chapter for
But before Ryan could respond Neville by mentioning any of these thoughts, Hermoine, who had just looked at the three boys hateful,interrupted: "We'll see." She had recognized a certain look, a certain hesitation in Ryan's eyes, which she maybe even wasn't aware off herself.
Where did these thoughts come from all of a sudden?
Draci on the other side still sat on the bed in their room.
“You should go hunting then, or sneak into the kitchen and get a bloodbag.”
Outside a full moon hung low at the horizon.
„Ignitium!"Novell shouted and the leek catched fire and screames, but still continued following the girl. Neville jumped heroically from his broomstick and kicked the leek away be4 it could reach her. She fell on the ground and looked up-
And there, alone sat... Hermine.
„So u have some quiet days ahead of u.“, hermine said. „Comr ron, he needs his sleep and we do 2.“
Together they went to class.
She nearly had forgotten how tit felt to bee kissed, her last boyfriend had been a real asshole and head betroyed hr and since then she decided not 2 have a boyfriend anymore, this was 4 years ago now...
After a long discussion Ryan could convince her sister Dawn and her room-matte Izora to stay with them in their room in the slytherin tower.
Hermine chuckled.
“C’mon let’s go somewhere more fun.”, saud one of the blckhaierd girls and they somehow complimented and flirten Jordan out of the room.
Although he wuz da house-leader he didnt really kno how to act around people, especially girls. They always tried to come near him just because he wuz so powerful and a really outstandin magician. And da boys either thought he wuz gay or were afrid of him or thouht he was some sorta geek or somthn. So all in all he wasnt really popular, although he wuz da house leader and he didnt rely hav friends.
“”it da meddle of da night, we cant juzt go out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
„You saw it?“, Hermine asked, „Draco, I should just slap you again right away!“, she screamed.
„Ebiny, please, let us explin!" Draco said, knpcking at the sdoor.
The sun set at the time they walked thtrough the corridor and went up the stairs. Through the big victorian windows which framed the spiral staircase at one side they could see the big garden behind the Hogwarts castle.
„The bug-easting guy looked at them silently.
"I think that ould be a goof ideea, I mean we all could think about us and how we wannt it to go on...", Vampire thought and looket outta da windu. "I hope she undastand, bshe sh++has so many proböems at de moment..."
*a guinea pig?" She tolles her eys and lifted one bro "a cute fluffy lil gunea pug, i think it really suits you to be honest, fluffy red hair, a little fat and big, thoughtful eyes."
He nearly ran into Ryan, rushing down the hallway.
Dear followers and friends and literary interested people of the internet,
Of couurse...
“Easy, I said.” Tina smacked her on the arm.
„Wow, shes da top bitch boss“, Jinx said.
Satan wuz her roomate, an arrogant dude, who was full off himself, and looked down on her.
As she walked to the front entrance door but was stopped by – SATAN?????(A/N As we remember from my immortl the original Satan is Voldemorts younger self!)
Whose room wuz it? It was damn messy… and whos arm was that around her waist??
Actualy, most of the time they had been silent, an uneven silence that Draco hated but did not know how to end.
Ryan turned around and flung her arms around him.
“C#mon let me help too.”, Hermoine said and the three of them went off.
„You are so strange the fast days, what‘s wrong with you?“
If you feel offended by this, choke on a strap-on and fuck off.
Draco chuckled and got off his bed to lie down beisdes his friend.
Maybe this wuz just a fake time turner that didnt work, maybe it wuz a trap fro hermoine and she just wanted to wait until ebony uses it, just to laigh at her when it did not work….
He leaned forward and kissed her.
“Yeah, I have a strange feeling, considering this long recovery somehow,  maybe its nothing, but…. We should keep an eye to this ….”
It was still noon, the sun stood high in the sky and he headed to the hogwarts castle.
Neville nodded.
His shirt was covered in blood and his body was already frozen. He felt his heart calming. Body relaxing. Breath leaving his weary heart. He didn't have to worry about breathing another day. Not anymore. It's mild. It's smooth. The world was full of vibrant colours. The colours he brought into his life. Not only the red of his blood and the green of his eyes. Every colour of that moment in Amazon was dripping down on him. Colours started pouring down on him. Draco smiled softly. Finally he let go.
'I am with you!' he wrappped his hands around him, pulled him closer. Settled him between his legs and caged him in his arms. Then he watched the sunrise embracing Draco.
Malfoy wet his lips.
'Or what?'
He pulled one knee towards him and rested an elbow on it running his fingers through his hair. He didn't know if he should have prevented it or could have prevented it. All in all he dragged Potter in to this. He could have just come home. But he loved everything about it. every detail, every second of it. He loved everything about him.
Two hours later despite the disapproval of the St Mungos healers, he walks out of the hospital looking for Draco Malfoy. He lays unconscious in his room of Malfoy Manor. His face content but body covered in an ample amount of cuts and scrapes, yet healing, probably for whatever Narcissa  Malfoy has given him.
'Draco!'
All communication methods including owl delivery, floo and patronus do not work. Fear striking and making it clear that they are stuck in the house with enough of food for another two week only thanks to Dudley's irritating habit of hoarding food. In his haste of evacuating the house, has left all.
Harry loved watching him work.
The first day was thick. He found Potter thinking hard.
'What am I going to see?' he mumbles running his pale hands up and down the sides of his face.
She giggled.
'This is Drey, the love of my life.'
Harry bit his mounting desire to hold him but he knew he just coluld not. Not anymore.
After perceiving him adequately he points at the notebook with handwritten spells and drawings. 'Yours?'
Then he remembers the reality. His silver eyes staring wide and spellbound, glossy and mellow in sheer delight against the glass edges cutting and scraping. Draco beamed. Ran his long fingers through his black hair, fingertips brushing the scalp. Without white roses his mouth indulged in Harry's, touched, opened, wet, warm, mellow, and tarts and cigarettes. It was soft and smooth. Quiet and tranquil except for the delicate beat of a heart. Tastier than treacle tart and fresher than the summer air.
He ignored the staff at the ministry, made the conversation very short and sweet with anyone who reached him and straightaway went to see Kingsley. Kingsley went through the report and invited him to sit.
He was fine with his lonely evenings and quiet weekends. He would meet Ron and Hermione or the Weasleys but this haze of freedom and lonesome was fine too.
'Where is he Hermione?'
No one would rattle his chains. No one would trespass his boundary, climb over his high walls. He ignored everything under the sun and the moon and existed on his own.
'Are you happy with me?' Harry asked walking out of the exit.
Harry leaned against the closed door burying his face in his hands embracing every word he had said. Now his scar didn't hurt but his heart ached and he knew it was already cracked and bleeding inwardly and he was soaked in his own blood. He ached to tell him that it was him, it had always been him, him more than anything. He rubbed his chest breathing heavily. He had lived his life a motherless, loveless, ill-treated, yet he gave his everything to this cruel world. He died for this world. He masterd death. But he couldn't master love.
He'll be back.
The entire auror division saw the difference. First his smell changed. He started emitting an exclusive French perfume. Then his clothing changed. He started wearing T-shirts and pullovers of high quality material underneath his regular auror robes. Sometimes he wore leather jackets and leather gloves. Gradually his skin became radiant and attitude became jovial and peaceful.
Draco woke up the next day.
He forgot his bleeding nose and pulled the box out. He sat on the floor and opened it. He felt  weird on his face. His facial muscles were awkward. He knew he was smiling. A genuine smile was edging across his face after weeks.
'You need something Potter?' he spat his name colourlessly.
They would just look into each other's eyes and end up kissing violently, ripping each other's clothes off. They would have each other until thier bodies were sore and could hardly breath.
Neiher the researcheres nor Kingsley seemed to mind that the teamleader had stayed back as though it was quite normal.
He chuckled wrapping an arm around his body and pulling him to kiss the side of his sweaty forehead not minding an occasional neighbour passing by and said, 'You have no idea how much I....' he stopped.
'What?' he breathes in the last of the cigarette.
Malfoy braced and waited motionless and slowly looked up at Harry. Their eyes met. Harry gazed in to the grey eyes which were searching for meaning in his green and blinked perplexed. But he failed to say a word.
'Yeah? And why is that Malfoy?' Harry's stepped towards him, his tone became dangerously soft.
'If this magic was a person I would hold on to it, gladly be a prisoner.'
'Yeah I'm trying Weasley, I'm trying.' Malfoy's was shaking too and his voice was cracking.
'Hey! I didn't crucio you though,' Malfoy barked defensively and pulled Harry towards him and kissed.
'Oh the usual. Snogging and sucking and fucking!' Harry shot carelessly.
They had visited Malfoy Manor a few times and spent nights in Draco's room. Potter and mother had some unspoken clean bond that they would even have tea in the parlour talking for hours in quiet Saturday evenings while father and Draco talked in the drawing room. At first Potter did not like father much but they were very civil to each other and even talked at the dinner table. There had never been happier days in his life that his three favourite people were altogether having dinner.
'Two fingers?'
'No thanks Potter! I'm not rude but just forget what happened between us!'
He would hug him and rub his hands and cast a spell to warm him.
'Mother?' he exclaimed in utter astonishment, walked out and closed the door.
They would get a hot bath together and would sleep till late next day and Draco would stay up the next time too and if Potter got even late he would wait outside.
Potter took him to Godric's Hollow. To visit the Potters' grave. Draco placed the roses he had bought from a florist in London because he didn't want to used magic and make it easy.
He didn't say anything. His face became darker. He sighed and pushed his cup of coffee away.
'A special rescue mission. Tomorrow in Alaska!'
He watched Malfoy getting ready quietly. He didn't mind if Malfoy stayed the night because this silence and whatever they were having between them did not make him feel bad or awkward. It felt so raw and real to Harry. He had never felt this way. Never. Harry didn't have to pretend, to be nice or gentle. He didn't have to bother about, how Malfoy would feel or his judgment or any of such bullshit. He just let him have him his way and totally absorbed the joy.
'You are noble Harry Potter. I don't want you to do that for me. You risked your life before too. I'm not worth it,' he mumbled to Harry's shoulder cradling in his arms.
'Kreacher will be very happy to show you around the house and you can sleep in any room you want and...,' he pauses pulling him closer. 'My room is up there OK?'
'Your son is dying!' he gritted through controlled anger.
They ate whatever Narcissa Malfoy gave them wordlessly, cleaned themselves and ended up in the beautiful, majestic bedroom where Draco Malfoy had spent most of his comfortable childhood. Malfoy sat on his bed avoiding Harry's gaze knowing he was watchin him.
'It was a very good session.'
A few minutes later he stopped resting his head on his shoulder grabbing on to his shirt and breathing hard.
Draco couldn't watch him writhing in pain. He walked towards him, touched his hand slowly, knowing he himself was breaking too but tried to hold the falling pieces of the one man he had ever loved, chasing after him again and again, letting go of every truth he knew, hating him, loving him, falling in love with him more and more each day. Only him.
They woke up on the quiet Sunday morning, had a bath together. Harry wanted him in and Malfoy pinned him against the bathroom wall gleefully. They had sex in the bath. Pushing Harry to the marble wall Malfoy fucked him. Harry turned and found his hot mouth time to time and his warm hand on Harry's cock, with water running down them, moaning and grunting in sheer pleasure and pain they had each other. They sucked each other, stroked each other until they were dry. Both of them had never came that much in one day ever before. Their bodies sore and could barely walk. They lay naked side by side in the bed awhile.
Auror Harry Potter.'
'It's fine.' he removed his glasses, wiped his eyes on the back of his hands and kissed Draco's head.
They fought a war alongside him. They gave him a home. They gave him food. They gave him a family. Harry made the correct choice to be with those amazing lovely people. He was a good man.
'Drey, come here please!' Harry pulled him for a very intent kiss and kissed him with every energy he had remaining in his body.
'He was a badass but you are a big fat git. Spoilt brat.'
'Yes genius, you knocked.' he pulls up the trousers, buckles it ignoring the fact he watches.
'A team of researchers working in Peru missed their portkey. Can you please go there and help them with the work. They have to bring some stuff which they can't apparate with.'
Harry was on the verge of yelling and screaming at everything in the vicinity.
Harry counted four burnt cigarettes in an ashtray next to him and a muggle cigarette packet was also lying next to him. Harry thought of calling him but stalled watching him sleeping.
'I didn't expect you. You should have sent an owl. I could come.'
'It was not your job Potter,' head of the auror division examined Malfoy.
1 o'clock in the morning.
'What are you going to do?' she asked softly.
Draco obeyed. He felf his mouth on the back of his neck kissing, breathing him in, sucking. That mouth slowly went down the length of his body. He stoppped at the buttocks and kissed them. Kissed each buttock properly, cupped them, slowly parted them and kissed so intently in between. Licked and kissed deep and smooth longer than usual and Draco felt his rough fingers trembling slightly between his buttocks and his lips wet and quivering. Yet eventually his usual tantalizing rough approach came. Draco gasped breathlessly. They made love silently. He came in Draco once. He sucked Draco in an intolarable thirst. They went back to the bath and stroked each other kissing painfully. Draco threw him against the wall and shagged long and deep and then sucked him till he was breathless. They came back into the room. Dried themselves, kissed wildly and stroked again and again. They had never reached that many orgasms in one day. They fell asleep in each other's arms.
'Scared Potter?'
It was more of a caress. Five smooth fingers and the palm properly and unnecessarilly touched his skin. Did Malfoy touch his arm? Harry tried to catch his gaze but he avoided Harry's eyes looking away at the colourful sky. His expression was strange. That malicious grin had vanished from his face. It's filled with mild mischievous satisfaction.
'What sort of a question is that?' he smiled softly.
'It's ok. You can foget what I said,' Malfoy continued to avoid his glowering green gaze.
Harry took his quill and entered a note,
Their sofa.
You must have loved Sirius a lot?'
'Like Sirius is not a git!'
With his scent.
But it's over now.
'Why are you doing this to me? Stop acting like an attention seeking prat!' Harry would ask hugging him and and trying to warm him.
Malfoy stood up and turned taking in a large gulp of smoke. He was extremely cool and maintained his calm and Harry knew he just wanted to provoke him.
But it wasn't over.
But he flatly detested Ginny.
'You are late!' he would grumble to his shoulder.
Harry smiles.
But Harry could not deny that mounting preasure he was feeling was fear. He was scared.
'Oh!' He let Draco condition his hair and relaxed.
And he had to tell her. She had to know. Harry knew she would understand. She fought a war alongside him and she grew up with him. Besides Harry knew she already knew this. But he had to confess this because that was the truth.
Those beautiful honest green eyes. They were big and shining in the summer sunlight. Brave brave Harry Potter, who didn't have a home, who got ill treated by filthy muggles, who lived by the grace of Dumbledore and the Weasleys, who died to save the world once, who was ready to die with Draco, who loved Draco.
He didn't ask Draco anything. He simply placed his head on Draco's chest and rested. Then he raised his head gazed in to Draco's eyes and kissed his forhead. Twice and three times, sweeping his silky hair back, running his fingers through it, kissed his cheecks, whispered that he really loved that moment.
'Can I drink some water?' he asked politely.
Harry put the book aside, took off his glasses and kissed him back thoroughly stroking his hair gently. He was happy. He was happpy with this family. No more dreams haunting him. No more fears.
First Harry hit the climax in his hands and wet all over the sofa gasping and moaning loudly. In a while Malfoy released his ecstacy in Harry hugging him. He placed a prominent kiss between his shoulder blades and rested his head agaist the back of his neck. Then he released Harry and sat on the floor leaning agaist the seat of the sofa, running his hand through his hair while Harry turned lying on his back. They spent a few long minutes in pin drop silence.
Harry breathed pulling him towards him by his hand, taking his mouth in his but the next second he pulled away breathing hard. Harry felt those rosy lips parted at the touch of his. The tip of his tongue had touched his lips. Did he kiss back? The sweet sensation still lingering in his mouth. He looked at his face glowing in pink and gold, lips slightly apart asking for more, breathing hard that Harry couldn't resist.
'Your fiance is dead!' he assured.
He sat on the bed, drank some water to calm himself. He knew he was going crazy but he could not brush off the compelling need to touch the sleeping man next to him and make sure he was not dead. He watched him sleeping for awhile and ran his hand down his back caressing softly.
Then Malfoy rose to his feet snatching his shirt and walked away, 'Weasley!'
'Unlike you Potter, I know better and I'm smart enough not to use wands in this country. We are standing on a volcano,' he casually ignored Harry's boiling tember.
'That's why you love me?'
'Please drop by when you have time.' George let go of Malfoy's hands and Malfoy nodded smiling back.
Then on one beautiful Sunday morning when Harry was reading the newspaper in the living room of Grimmauld place running his fingers through the sleek white blond hair of Draco Malfoy who was resting his head on Harry's lap, and Kreacher was doing many a task near them now very much used to this behaviour, who loved spending the Sunday morning with them, Harry chuckled softly.
Five cigaretts were burnt. It's two o'clock in the morning. He had fallen asleep on the doorstep. Again. He had to finish a report. He did not have time to sleep anymore. He coud make a cup of cappuccino from the machine. He had learnt it from Potter. He had learnt to use the cappuccino machine and the washing machine but not the cooking appliances.
It happened two months before, at the Eiffle Tower. He was on his knees and Draco pulled him up.
'Oh the number of times I fantasized having you here!'
'What did  you do to him?' Ron asked in an undertone.
He demands now anxiety surging and swirling.
Harry died inside to hold him and stop him but watched helplessly when he walked away.
Curled on the floor.
Harry went for a walk in the Royal Mile Old Town and ate from a muggle cafe. For some reason he imagined if Malfoy was with him. He would grumble but it would be nice to walk in the city with him. Do some shopping and kiss him in daylight. The thought made him happy.
Just one step forward and hold that pale hand, and he will be in his arms and Harry knew he would yield. It would be one blissful spring dawn to kiss his mouth, taste him, touch his body, make love to him, lay by his side and wake up next to him. Him, him, him and more him.
Harry doesn't know where it started. He doesn't know where it was dragging them. He knows only that he needs him. There was no choice there.
'Morning...! What do you want for breakfast?'
'Fine!' Harry threw away his wand and stepped towards him. Malfoy simply loved it. He waited with an evil mirth on his pale grey eyes now on fire by the evening sunlight and still he wouldn't stop taunting Harry.
Kreacher disappears leaving the two men in the room in thick silence. Draco seems strangely satisfied but Harry fuming with anger.
After finishing his day's work he went outside. He smoked more. He coughed more. Perhaps he would dream him.
Draco went on, 'I needed you every day....! I gave you my hand...! But you rejected. So why now...? Not because you care for me. Because it will make you feel good..... ! Make you feel less guilty!' he shot in sheer hatred and walked as far away as he could from him and added, 'You don't have to feel guilty. You owe me nothing.'
'Like I'm gonna listen to you Potter! I heard you broke up with the Weasley bitch.' he glared at Harry taunting him more.
He was feeling cold. So cold and hungry. He hadn't eaten anything since yesterday afternoon. Pansy Parkinson had dragged him by force to  her place in the morning and he had to eat whatever she had given him. She invited him to stay for awhile but he came home. Draco wanted to stay at home. Potter's home. His home.
It would hurt him, scrape his heart, burn him.
'I don't do relationships!' he would point-blankly say.
He always waited by the doorstep because the silence was so loud in the house at night. And it was unbearably cold inside. At night it's hard.
He would feel his lips on his hair and open his eyes.
Draco woke up at five o' clock in the evening.
'Actually I have!' he observes the shirt, leans against the wall and smells it inadvertently.
Malfoy's charm dragged you two out of the window. Then you remained in the air for a minute or so fighting against the magic and then fell off.'
Draco felt the warmth. The beating heart he loved to feel all his life. He's on fire. He's on fire with his weeping cracked bleeding heart beneath him. Draco nodded. 'I know...!' he whispered. He buried his face in Harry's chest and sank in to his knees hugging his body.
Two days later the auror division received a memo about a special lecture on 'Ancient Curses' would be delivered by agent Malfoy from the special research team the ministry had hired.
Harry knew the rooms of Malfoy Manor were enchanted to be sound proof so he didn't mind him yelling.
He sat on the flat stone where he had sat and smoked when Potter barged into his life, and watched the missed sunrise.
Draco loved Potter's job and knew he was best at it but they had always argued and yelled at each other regarding risky tasks he always accepted. Potter was a true Gryffindor who was blindly brave and, well Draco thought very stupid.
However, it happened again and again. But Malfoy kept his distance.
He knew he needed more. He could still smell him and taste him in his mouth. He loved it but he had to forget it. Perhaps a bath and a smoke would do the trick to cast it away.
She gazed through his eyes very sharply and said very coldly, 'I've heard that you don't let anyone in the house. You always talk to them outside the house and never invite them in. May I come in?' she demanded quietly.
'Oh no! We knew it since the third year of Hogwarts.'
He's not my boyfriend Dudley and it's not a curse. Where is Malfoy?'
'You got into my mind again!' Harry steps forward, stands right in front of him searching for his gaze.
'Tell me!'
However there were somedays in which Harry would get a foot massage from him and also a hot water bath. Harry always fell half asleep in the hot tub between his legs leaning against him while he shampooed his hair and washed him.
'Stand up! Stand up! Are you fucking crazy...? Yes...! Yes...! Now stand up..! Please!' He pulled him to stand up. They kissed. A few tourists clapped. He had given him an Alexandrite gemstone ring. Glistering with colours. They came home, spent hours kissing and embraced in each other's arms.
He removed the ring and placed it on the dressing table.
'I promise!' he rested his head on Harry's chest and fell a sleep.
On his way back he thought of changing the hair style. Perhaps a different look. When he was getting off Potter's ridiculous 1069 Ford Mustang Mach 1, their immediate neighbour Silvia and her seven year old daughter came out of their house and saw him.
Having followed Kingsley's instructions Harry apparated outside the street of houses and walked towards a beatiful small detached brown tiled house with white walls and a solar panel. It was a peaceful neighbourhood he had selected to live. This was different from Privet Drive. People smiled with Harry and  children were riding bicycles on the street and British cars were parked infront of the houses. There were two muggle racing bikes parked infront of his house and he was sitting on the front porch on the steps fallen asleep leaning agaist the railing.
'What's happening to him?' Harry tried to calm himself but he knew he was shivering slighty.
Potter pushed him on to the bed and settled on him kissing him and his whole body. Draco loved the weight on him, he loved the worrior, the saviour on him pinning him to the bed not letting go, imprisoning him caging him, owning him.
'You are late.'
'Oh it's so funny Potter, the whore failed to satisfy your needs.'
Potter always grumbled waking up but quickly yielded or sometimes pulled Draco like a hungry wolf.
'Those who are interested in dark arts learn about these things and invent spells and potions we don't even know about. Especially ancient Mayans were very famous for their potions and their  medicinal chocolate,' he went on colourlessly reminding Harry strongly of Professor Snape but all the aurors listened and took notes attentively.
'Can he?'
'Let's go home!'
Malfoy wore his pants and found the belt and saw Harry watching him but did not mind at all.
'I tore it!'
That crippling unending agony dragged him to the Malfoy Manor the night before his wedding day. Narcissa Malfoy, without uttering a single word called her son and walked away leaving them alone. Draco opened the door of his room and stood aside letting him in.
When Goerge had walked in to the ministry Harry grabbed hold of Malfoy and apparated at his doorstep in Edinburg.
'I'm glad you are happy with him Harry,' George said.
'He said you needed to rest a little. Come home and how are you going to eat today?' she examined the clean kitchen which had not been used for weeks.
'Are you serious?' Harry kissed his cheek now a little pink.
He nods watching Harry taking the pancakes, spreading butter and syrup and cutting a piece. Then he grabs his hand and eats without a warning.
Harry shook him desperately, hugging and kissing him. 'Baby please don't do this! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!' He shook him hard, and felt his heart horrified. His heart was beating and he was breathing but he didn't wake up.
'I know you love to go home and relax but I really need a favour.' Kingsley smiled apologetically.
Potter usually came home by seven o'clock on a regular day. On a moonlit summer night they would go out for a walk. On an occasional Friday night Potter would drag him to a fancy muggle restaurant either to meet a muggle detective friend of him or for fine dining. Potter didn't like fine dining much but he was an old school family man. He loved taking him on dates, bying him little gifts and introducing him to his friends.
Potter would do some work at the dining table or he would sleep in an armchair. Draco always woke him and took him to bed or he woud sit on the floor and sleep on his lap.
Holding him, cradling him in his arms whispering to him every love he could think of Harry realized exactly how much pain Severus Snape had had suffered.
But he came home and smoked without even looking at the flag.
Harry  brought dying Draco Malfoy to Scotland to the Stonehenge. Hermione had marked a circle and while Ron frowned the whole time she performed the dark magic from the grimoir.
'He's a romantic don't you think? I've seen him watching the sky and the sunrise smoking on his  own,' another witch giggled to which the young wizards wooed.
'We can't apparate. You, I and Weasley need blood replenishment. Tell Granger to go fetch mother. She'll do it.
'Fred and I even had a bet on who woud top!' George winked at Harry sretching against his seat.
Harry didn't have even him for him. His everything was with him in that room in Malfoy Manor, right now. He was a changed man. Because the pain changes you.
Ron gaped horrorstruck but Hermione nodded hugging Harry and crying.
They waited without a word for a few minutes. Malfoy went away into the house and brought some books and gave them to Hermione.
"George? Hey, George! What are you doing here? What's the time?'
Harry took him home. He wanted to take him out on a date to say so many things. To ask so many things but he simply brought him home.
Malfoy never asked why he was given only Auror Harry Potter but another.
However, Harry knew he couldn't distract him again the same way the next day so he didn't try. He just followed Malfoy with no permission into the sealed room. Malfoy didn't object. Perhaps he thought it was Kingsley's orders and got on with his work.
His fiance is dead.
George didn't say anything. He listened thoughtfully and sighed. They spent a few silent moments gazing into the night.
'He's not coming!'
'DON'T KILL HIM!'
The sky was bright blue. The sun was blazing over the mountain peaks but it was raining. The tropical rain was hammering on every green and rocky mountain, on the dead city. On him.
Contrary to his signature smugness he keeps working without a break, and he refuses help whenever being offered saying it's all the calculation and logic he ought to work on to figure the magic out to which Harry can't help but beamed with genuine joy when the latter had placed an egg sandwich to accompany the mug of coffee infront of him.
'Because the magic upgraded!' he lets the smoke leave his lungs enjoying the pleasure. 'There are loopholes in this magic which allowed communication and Elf apparation at first but it upgraded.' He tilts his head looking sideways at Harry.
Malfoy sighed and said in an undertone to Harry's greatest pleasure, 'Yes Mother,' and drank his coffee in silence.
'What's wrong with you?' he felt Potter shaking him.
But Hermione was watching him sympathetically. Harry had no other option. He knew he had only her. He knew she would not let him down no matter what. She never did. She never will.
Harry looked around the lving room mesmerized. It was the signature of Malfoy. It was spotless clean and nothing was out of place. Harry chuckled softly.
He spent the rest of the night trying to forget the headache.
'OK!' Harry pulls out his wand and without a warning locks the doors and casts a sealing charm around them.
Then he waits, all eyes on his bare body, well-formed abs and tight muscles on his chest, the  result of serious auror training, clean dark hair wet from the recent shower lining down towards the crotch getting thicker.
He saw Silvia's jaw drop in utter horror but the girl screamed gleefully.
'Then what are you witing for? Just do it. Tell me I'll do it.' he yelled in utter desparation.
She hugged him and then she held Harry's hand in both her hands. 'Once again Harry Potter. You did it once again.' Then she nodded at Hermione and Ron.
'Stop calling them that?' said Harry through gritted teeth forgetting to ignore anymore.
'Ok.... ! What do you want?' he let Draco shampoo his hair.
Draco felt something was breaking in him. He was vulnerable and bare in Potter's arms. It was not that he had just fallen in love with Potter. He had always loved him. Draco had never loved anyone else. Potter was his every love. He finally accepted that he had no way out of it.
The lecture started at 5 o' clock in the evening and lasted for three hours at a stretch.
Harry gasped for the feeling of lube spreading over his open and then his soft fingers over it. He rubbed his thumb and forefinger over the hole two three times and pressed one finger and then two in to it going in and out while wrapping his other hand around Harry's belly and holding him firm. He reached out and held his cock again with all his fingers wrapping it properly and stated stroking until Harry caught the rhythm again and fell completely in his control. He urged Harry to spread and tried to make the hole wider to enter. Harry moaned desperately and Malfoy thrust his cock slowly. It went in half and the second time it went in fully that Harry winced for the sudden force of pain and then ultimate pleasure. Malfoy conitued to stroke Harry's cock while his cock fucked hard. Harry was lost in the pleasure and the pain totally trapped in his arch-enemy's arms. He moaned loudly and desperately and Malfoy fucked him with no mercy. Eventually he stopped kissing Harry, stopped caressing his back, he stroked wildly while moving in and out jerking hard and gasping loudly.
'Why can't she ask George or Ron?' he put his wand away and gritted his teeth.
He cast every spell he knew to wake him but still he wouldn't wake.
He turned with a sinking heart when he heard Kingsley's voice behind him.
Harry summoned it.
'Use a concealer!'
He caught Harry's green gaze and blinked twice. Harry watched how beautifully his pupils dilated and his skin flushed and his pretty lips parted. Harry dropped his bag and caught his face in his hands and kissed him forcefully. He didn't object. On the other hand he wrapped his hands around Harry's body and pulled him towards him kissing him back.
'Yes Mrs Malfoy, Im sorry I didn't stop him,' he said apologetically.
Draco didn't need anything else. He wanted to shut down all the doors and protect this moment in his black and white bedroom. He felt Potter was falling asleep totally forgotten his duty. He didn't want to wake him up. He didn't want him to leave.
Harry bit back his strange desire. He breathed in the smell of his prefume, his hair, his shirt, his mint cigarette, his mint breath gazing at his eyes and his mouth.
'Where's your elf?'
Malfoy's long pale fingers were lightly wrapped around Harry's forearm. For a fraction of a second Harry felt a velvet smoothness touching the skin of his arm.
'How many times have I told you not to stay outside? Come in! And stop smoking will you?'
He went to see mother and father. Hugged father resting his head on his shoulder. He stroked Draco's hair and said many doting words and promised to buy him anything he wanted. But Draco came home and shut himself up.
'Drey, why don't you come for dinner with us tonigh? Bret wanted me to tell you.'
And Kreacher did not pay the slightest attention to them, carried on cleaning the many things in the living room vaccuming the dust and keeping several things in perfect order.
8 o'clock in the morning-
Despite a mild scar on the forehead he appears quite well and radiant after staying at home a mother's boy. He acts his usual Malfoyish snobbish manner eager for the document refusing any refreshment stating his eagerness to leave.
The cupboard under the stairs....
Mother went back making him promise to come home to Malfoy Manor.
He appears dark and grim quite suddenly collecting his stuff and throwing them in a paper bag. Then he lights the last cigarette and meditates becoming paler and sadder moment after moment checking the time.
Potter dragged him towards his laptop and showed him the muggle beauty products and a wizards' website that sold some witch beauty products online. He ordered concealer and foundation for him which worked properly hiding his paleness and the dark circles.
His touch was all over him and the sweet sensation didn't let him sleep. His scent was still in his hair and on his skin mixed with the many lotion and cologne he had used in the morning. Draco loved his natural scent. Though Potter used whatever supermarket shampoo or cologne he smelt so natural and fresh and Draco loved it.
'You sick bastard!' he muttered.
He pulled down his pants. Watched his naked body in pure adorarion. 'I wanted you like this in my bed, and I wanked thinking of this moment right here.' he kissed his cheek and whispered to his ear.
Later in the night he came home and managed to wash away the colours, somewhat and continued his black and white.
'Nnnn..... no...!'
He kneels between his legs, his cottony touch cupping his face and rests his forehead against his not meeting the eyes.
Of his life.
Harry was happy. He had never been happier. They came a long way through thick and thin. With all the ups and downs, falling in love more and more, Harry built his cathedral with the love of his live. They had everything. Harry had everything. Most of all Harry had him. Harry had him in his house, walking barefoot, shirtless, in his life, clinging to him, crawling into his arms, bickering, yelling, fighting, fucking, kissing and holding on.
'Because we are in this together you moron! Kingsley would kill me if I went alone.'
'You mind?' he mutters more to himself than to the intruder.
'What's the drawing?' Harry sits next to him peeping into the drawing. The writings and symbols, unable to be comprehended but not interested also, yet very eager to see his side profile right next to him, waxy and radiant after his morning shower. Wet hair tied up lose, water dripping on his shirt, glued to his pale skin underneath.
'Will you walk away from me one day?' he smiled sadly.
Harry didn't answer.
Hermione accepted the books and nodded sniffing softly.
'Again?' Potter asked joyously wrappping his fingers around Draco's. Draco grew instantly in his hand. They found each other's warm tongues and started tasting and dancing breathlessly. They stroked each other  for another couple of long moments. They came in each other's hands, Draco awhile after Potter both of them worn out and quite dry.
And Potter would use the bath first while Draco tidied their bedroom and then Potter would prepare breakfast while Draco washed himself. Potter left for work early and Draco cleaned everything spotless before he started his work because living with Potter was like living with a real life Quidditch player. He would drop his towel and cloak and shirt and T-shirt and everything everywhere. Mrs Weasley once said he always waited till the last minute to do the laundry. After the usual cleaning is done Draco would start his work. He didn't have to report to work everyday and usually prepared his research reports at home or in a library.
Draco turned to look at his eyes.
Draco's face lightens up with a strange smile. He walks towards the sofa and drops himself next to Harry. 'It's like obsessive love.' He toes off his shoes and pulls a barefoot up the sofa towards him resting his head on the back rest and smiles to the gaudy chandelier Dudely has replaced which was very Aunt Petunish. 'You know Potter?'
Malfoy placed his hand on Harry's forehead.
He nods again and removes Harry's glasses and sees through his gaze.
'Mother!'
'Hmmm!' Goerge waited till he finished eating the second sandwich. 'I remeber you telling me that though it was hard on me, Fred's in a better place, away from all these crap, and I should be happy about it,' he said quietly tooking at the stars.
'Potter is dead,' he said to the man in the mirror.
'Yeah?' Malfoy pulled Harry towards him and both of them tumbled on the floor kissing heavily.
His neatly combed long hair got up on a messy bun. Started playing like a child and staring unnecessarily at Harry when he is not looking. Adding on to his usual irritating attitude he occasionally acted his homely pampered manner, demanding food, mostly complaining of hunger.
Perhaps Draco should try ordering for himself.
Draco felt his lips being touched by his mouth moist and fesh but he just remained immobilized.
He knew he was shaking in sever pain and tears ran down his closed eyes. He felt blood being removed from his beating heart and he opened his eyes despite the throbbing pain. A stream of blood was going in to Malfoy's heart. Despite the murdering pain in his chest he turnd to look at him. He was not shaking now and his wound on the chest was healing on it's own. In spite of the burning pain in his body Harry's heart swell in massive joy and he smiled in peace.
He coughed. Drank water and coughed more. He ignored the headache. He was shivering with coldness. He summoned Potter's woolen sweatshirt and wore it. He was so hungry but he couldn't eat. He stayed curled up on the floor of their living room.
They told mother and father, Pansy Parkinson, Ron and Hermione and George.
Draco watched his calm, relaxed stance after the climax for a while. Potter slowly opened his eyes to see Draco applying lube on his cock and on his hole. He let him watch him fingering him slowly. They smiled at each other, he asked for a kiss, they kissed, he said Draco was irresistible and was the sex icon in Hogwarts. Draco told him that he had fanatasized fucking him a lot in this bed. He told him how his cock had ached to fuck his only love! He entered slowly and fucked him. He moved in and out slow and deep. He saw Potter was hard again.
'Didn't you miss them?'
'Granger, I don't think Potter will ever stop his shit habbit of blind decision making and he will always risk his life with or without me. Please read these grimoirs but don't let anyone know you have these and be kind enough to return them in one piece.'
Then he walked to the door and locked it as though not letting him out tonight.
Not even a muscle moved in Narcissa's face.
Harry has been thinking for an hour sitting on Dudley's brand-new sofa smoking one of Draco's remaining three cigarettes. He has retired to study his notes in the dining table while Harry dwells on his childhood memories, deep dark miseries, painful moments, love and loss and cupboard under the stairs.
"Mate are you mental? It's dark magic. You are a ministry worker.' Ron barked thunderstruck.
'Pick it up!' Harry snarled gesturing at the wand he had thrown way.
George smiled. 'And then you said that you didn't want to sugarcoat that  but it would hurt me more and more if I didn't let go. And you also said that I needed to move on.'
'And then you said that you never could move on. That there was no such thing. You said that you would just change. You would rebuild yourself from the broken pieces and you would reform.' Draco did not smile. He finished eating the sandwich peacefully and cleaned himself with a simple cleaning spell.
How maliciously these vibrant colours painted their lives seven years that Draco totally forgot that black and white.
He walked, bare foot, to the pantry and drank water. Harry loved to see his long white feet on his floor, in the pantry, him, shirtless, his beautiful body, no fat, toned muscles, holding his belt, hair ruffled, skin very pink, drinking water from his kitchen. Harry loved that moment. He loved Malfoy in his house, walking, getting dressed, just existing. Even if he didn't say anything he loved him there in his house.
Harry laughed, 'You two...!' he couldn't stop admiring the twins even more. 'Well I kissed him first and I won him in the end but he fucked me first!'
World around him is unusually quiet except for her voice and heavy breathing of another. Other than a mild headache Harry feels quite well. He wakes up fully. The silence and the mild blue light and the smell of the antiseptic cleaners divulge that he is in the hospital. Hermione is beaming but Dudley has the most screwed and regretful expression Harry has ever seen.
He felt calm. He coughed. The chill was strangely comfortable though he was shivering. His nose started bleeding again. He held the badge and  leaned agaist the railing. He had tried enough. He was tired. His heart was tired. Tired of trying to let go. It doesn't matter what people say.  His heart cannot beat anymore without him. His heart ached. His soul ached. He closed his eyes and the world became so colourful.
He thought if he stayed in the house, he would go crazy. Finally he got out of the house and went to the library, met his team members and discussed the work.
At the end of the session Malfoy was extremely tired but spent another hour answering all the questions and talking to those who had reached him.
Malfoy quickly became friends with the Weasleys and Hermione too. He was perfectly fine with Ron and Hermione and even had dinners with them, spent whole evenings discussing Quidditch with Ron, and discussing ancient runes and the relationship between divination and erithmancy with Hermione.
His wand ready and fingers shaking. He cast the two spells, the latter, the Reductor curse smashing everything, pieces of glass scattering around them shooting in every direction as shining diamonds in the rising dawn outside while  many things in the room fall and fly. He stuffs his wand in his pocket and wraps his hands around Harry avoiding his gaze.
Potter likes this place. He loves this place. He had been here before alone. Perhaps to feel that kiss. To feel Draco in his arms.
Draco woke up to the knock on the door.
'This is the second time he did this Weasley and you let it happen. You let him fly in that burning room for me and you didn't stop.'
But he was too late. The next day Malfoy got an owl from Kingsley regarding an old spell book suspected to be containing ancient Scottish voodoo ritual and dark spells which Mrs Malfoy had not known about and Malfoy accepted.
'I'll do it!'
They spent the whole glamorous morning in the magestic living room now gleaming thanks to Kreacher's renovation and cleaning, in silence listening to each other's breathing or Kreacher's working.
Potter brought dawn to life. Summertime and butterflies and all the colours. In his arms, in his warmth, in his smell, listening to his brave heart, it was alway the golden colourful beautiful dawn to Draco.
It was amazing that sweet vanilla sensation of his smooth fingers working graciously on his cock and his hot breath on his neck. He enjoyed his lips, tongue, kissing and his teeth biting into the skin and again kiss sucking hard. Harry gasped in pain but strained his neck giving him more to kiss. He kissed more moving up and down the side of his neck, neckline face and forehead while his hand moved wonderfully.
“Draco, do you really think it’s a clever move to annoy me this early in the mornin!?”
“Can’t sleep?”
„Sure.“, he said, a little bit of blood pouring out from a small wound on his lips.
„Ladies, I know about his shameful behavior, I cant send him back, neither can I take any action against him.
He was so friendly and open to those girls who were obviously flirting with him. Why didn’t he tell them to stop? That he already had feelings for someone… for her…?
„I think they went missing.“ she answered. „ Dumbledore also had no idea about you arriving so...“ She looked at Ebony. „We‘re sorry, but we found some old school unifrms for Slytherin for u to wear.“
Tears were streaming down her face as she ran off, Neville shouted something, but she didn’t hear it, she didn’t want to hear it, to hear excuses and lies.
it is time for a new chapter of My Immortal - My sweet Unvalentine! Woohoo!
Draco b4r3li wantd 2 lock at vamp- Harrie.
“Oh, dear, I’m not talking about “boys like him”, but about the boss-jock himself...”, Tina pointed out, adjustung her glasses. “He isn’t so bad btw, its mostly acting I think, but we’re going off tipoc, aint we? Iwas just thinkin, he had this accident… and… his broken bones heal so fuckin slowly”
„Ok so I know he‘s my ex#s (Jordans( best friend, but didn‘t he try to date you when the durmstrang bois were here because of the trimagical tournment?“, Ryan asked and hermine nodded.
The boys were deadly silent, just as the rest of the forest.
“Alright, yall can go now.”
Nobody expected her to be in another dimension at all – except one.
„Isnt the Quidditch match tomorrow?" Dawn asked thinkingly.
They hugged and intensified their kiss.
“Oooh, another handsome boi.”, the other black haired one said and pranced over too Jordan. She linked her arm with his and looked up at him as if he was the hero of a bad anime.
She pushed him away and looked at him, saw the ook in his face and kissed him again.
„Huuuuuuh.“, she sighed after the classes. „Finally this didnt even want to end, I wish the goblins we talked about had smashed my heed so i wouldnt have to listen to this stuff anymore. „
All students left the room, also the gothic-trio. Ebons was so pissed,she didnt say a word for the rest of the day.
Snape growled somethingunintelligible, but it sounded an awful lot like „you stupid little fuck", and Dumbledore nodded as if he could understand her [
Ryan looked at Jordan, who layed on the floor, without moving, and nodded slowly.
W'Leavingher, just why??
Night sunk over the castle of Hogawarts and after making nasty remarks about ebony and the booyz, some time of thinking and finally deciding to go watch the quidditch match tomottor after school, Hermoine and Ryan went to bed.
„And being arrogant about it, if you put it like that.“, she hissed.
He looked at the maurauders map, which he had gotten from vampire a few days bef4.
„Huh...“, he sighed. „You must think im a total jock, good for nuthin but quidditch and looking good.“
Something wuz wroong.
______________________________________________________________
„Come, let#s go.“, said Hermoine t Jinx and followed, Jinx just nodded and followed slowly.
She culdnt help, but also smile.
„How are u?“, she mubbled, pressing herself aganst him.
But love couldnt turn people around.
But as soon as she had left Ebonty chatted about her in the whole school what a whore sheallegedly was and that Ebony never thought she was even goff enoughto be her friend. She also told some people that Hermine tried tosteal her boyfriend dRAKKE away and Ebony fought her and that thishad been the cause for her leavung.
We hope y'all are well and are staying safe!
Viktor Krumm and a friend arrived in the crack of dawn the next moornun.
A phony laugh creeped to her sfrom behind, one that many other people would ve found appealing, cute and heartwarm1ng.
Hermine changed into her overzized JINJER-band shirt an long black leggins for sleeping, Ryan and her sister pit on black leggins and Humavoid-Shirts (different ones though, they had them from the consert they had been see in togetha). Izora changed into a grey shorts and a In This Moment-shirt.
„Alright.“, said ron. „We also should get some sleep, for we have a long train ride tomorrow.“
Then, suddenly she heard that scriechin noise again, witch had woken her up, she looked around in the nfirmary, but there was nothing but shaduwz and mere light.
„I could ask u the same“, she said loudly, so some stupid unimportant hogwarts students looked around. She looked at him. „Satan?“
„And why are you so dirty:“
Ryans black laquer boots were already covered in mud, she wore a black leggins and a black chiffon-vokuhila top and a fluffy waist-length jacket. Hermione also wore a black leggins, black demonia-damned-boots, a black longsleeve-top and a black leather skirt with a wide belt with silver spikes on it.
"Eboffby?"sha asked chweing some caramelized carrots.
"Ohmy-" she began gasping
“You rmember I said we were going to beat up Jordan every chapter from now on, respectively chapter 17?”
Hermine and Ryan sat in their room after class and laughed their asses off.
„Dont call us kiddos, u wanker!" she hissed and drew her hair over her shoulder. She worea black corset with pink bats on it, a short black skirt, pinkfishnets and black combo boots. The black cuffs on her arms had redlace on both ends and in her hair she had severus [
„I tried talkin to he, ya know?" Draco said and sat down on his bed, grapping his pusheen-plush-cat. He wore a black ripped shirt and agrey jeans, his black eyeliner was smeard and formed a dark shadow under his eyes. [E/N: *cough*Panda*cough*] „I think she didnt understand what I wannet to tell'er. I dunno, I got de impresion dad I dunno her anymore, she has changed so musch...."
So we came to Chapter 5 at the end of the year, thanks to all who read our
"I think your time as the teachers-favourite are over," she said, not even looking AT THE ahockt goffik-grl next to her, taking her cape and her books, straightening out her glasses and leaving.
Ryan screamed when a leek jumped out of the shadows and attacked them.
Mc Gonogoal sighed.  „Why can#t there be like one normal school year.“
Oh, and he wore a light grey shirt and dark grey jeans and ...uh...pfff...uhm… lets say dark blue sneakers, ok?
„Its not the time 2 discuuss this.“
Ryan just squinted her ies in anger.
Why was he such a pain in the ass to talk 2?, she thought.
"I just got the impression that Ebonys time as "the admired one" is over," Hermoine grinned as they passed and took a short look ova her shoulda to c if dey were still watvhing them. They did. And she flipped her long, green curled hair over her shoulder and made a waving gestre, so they could see her long black nails with silver crosses on them, except the ring finger, dis ona was even longer and sharp and silver with a big skull in da middle.
“Hm… I KOed him quite  fast actually.” Tina looked at him with squinted eyes. “That was no fun.”
Ryan began tidying a little bit and hung clothes into her wardrobe. Becuse it was a little cold already she pot on black knee-socks, which made her look cute but also very gothic.
Ebony raised one eyebro, and he sighed.
„Alright then," Snape said, „So we need to analyse the final product to find out what wasinside."
"I also think shes annoying, just complaining and hating agsinstHermoine," Vampire said and shook his head. "Se has to get overthe fact that she isnt the inly hot gal at hogwarts anymore."
Ryan waited in the infantry, but soon fell asleep on the couch.
„?" Draco looked at him surprised.
Enjoyyy!
„I think muggles may also have problems, just different from ours.“, Tina said thinkingly.
She drew some floral patterns in the back of her book, whilst the sun crawled over thehorizon.
„Miss Lightwood and Longottom are in the hopital.“, Dumblegork said. „The others arent back jet, oh and tom, this quodditch gux, he died because of the leek.
Again he looked in the mirror, yeah he looked more like his old self now....
Then, suddenly, there was a strange noise in the ear and then, the mutated leek broke through the grandstand of the teachers!
After just a few minutes the Griffindumps team was in the lead with 6:4.
)," Mr Wonka explained. "You know it's a some sort of funny, pink, marshmallow flavoured, small cupcake –but now you will learn how to make them yourselves. The basic recipeis also used for some other magical bakery goods as well and so this is the perfect thing to start with."
„What the hell did theeydo to this poor vegetable!" Ryan chuckled.
“Ya know, I been thinkin about ryan and this quidditch-dude… eh...”
“Easy, easy, dear.”, Tina placed a hend on Jincsxs shoulder.
it's been a while, but we're not dead (yet).
„Whot?“, Hermine shoutet. „And what about Ryan and Nebille?“
„Maybe youre right.“ He shrugged insecure.
They headed to the Glasshouse when the sun faded into night and strange noises came outof the forbidden forest.s
„What are you doing ere?“, they asked each otter simultanously-
You could hear silent eating noises and a shrieking voice in the backsideoutside in the gatresden; obwusly Enony.
Heblew out the air.
It wuz in da meddle oft he nigt.
“Hey you know, the more you tell me to go, the more I want you..”, he tried to grab her wrist but she swirled around and stepped through a door that suddenly appeared. Jordan looked at the wall amazed, the door ws already gone again,
Hermione looked up and saw him, he saw a small smile flit across her lipsbefore sh turned away again.
They were all flattened as they left the room.
Draco wandererd throught the floors, alone, still with his plushie in his arm.
Whilst Ebony faced a new reality, things in the normal timeline got worse.
Not that you get me wrogn, he had friends, but they seemed not be soclose as Hermine and Ryan to him, he thought.
„This, Mr. Weasley, means that during the creation of a sigil you must focus on what you want to achievewith it. For example when you draw a sigil forprotection, you must concentrate and focus on what you want toprotect and maybe from whom."
„But Professur, thy harrassed hermoine.“, Jinx said.
And how better to show a mudblod her place then to destroy her friends in a pityful place like this….
She went down the hallway which was filledn with gloomy light now in the morning.
"The food is quite good, but id rather eat at our room, you have to tellme what you did over da hollydays," Ryan mumbled, eating chocolatecookis with choco-spiders on em.
„Stupid preps," she thought by herself, seein al dose hipstas and wannabe goffs in front of her.
Hermine stayed quiet and Ryan flipped another stone over the water.
“No.”, she said with croaked voice, tears filling her eyes.
If Ryan was interested in him? Or did Hermoine maybe just made this Hestitaion up in her mind and it weads really nuthin''?
Hermoine sighed, not answering.
What happened to Vampire/ Harry?
Bloodbloodblood, was everything going through his mint at the moment.
Neville may be jock, but he had never been dishonest with her.
A loud unidentified noise crashed through the silence – it was a leek!
He didn’t even dare to blink now, he couldn’t think that anybody could find this sexy or even mildly interesting.
„Who‘s brain?“, asked a voice behind them, t‘wuz Neville, still an arm in a bandage and holding a crutch with the other hand.
She could hear satan breathing, sleeping.
Crap, Goyle and Neville wanted to cheat after them, when Neville saw a Hufflepuff girl getting attacked by a leek.
„I suggest you should listen to your girlfriend, but I also suggest you shoud displacce this conversation for now, because its my turn in teaching.“, said Mcgonogul and entered the classroom.
„I meynt we could slee toghether in the bed.“ Neville looked at her a little shy, and incredibbly innocent.
„Whatever now, lets get in. „, said ryan and put an arm around tina shouder and went inside.
She nearly cried, she felt so safe with him, especially after the encounter a few minutes ago, she really had to hold back her sobs.
They went for zhe great hall where also all the otter (gettit??!) studentsheaddid. They passed the door and all over their head flew burningcandles, (so fuck Brandschutzmaßnahmen! [2]). They set down besides acouple of gothic boys and a gay couple that was soop cut kissing. Towards Hermin and Ryan sat Ebony,Drace and Vampirt.
Did he do somthin wrong?
„Hopefully they wont sen dus again, it was horrible.“, said Ryan.
‚GIRLFRIEND‘ Jinx thought, so loud, she thought everyone must have heard it (ANyou can imagine her inner state of mind as this emoji whose head explodes)
He was different.
Enonu just cried and slit her wrists.
„Oh… eh….“ Ebon< stuttered, sweating heavily, she had no idea, she didnt even know  what was goin on. „Eh… I#m a new student and they told me to go look for u soooooo it was more like a question, rather than a determination…...“
Ryan was wearing a long dark blue dress with white stars and moons printed on it, and because oft he deep neck she wore a black mesh-top underneath and above a thin black cardigan. She wore her black hair in braids which she had wrapped around a headband, and wore silver moon earrings and a silver nose ring. She had put on dark blue eyeliner to metch her dress
„Dat sexxy boi teaches the

„I wonder if the others already found smthin...“, Hermoine said lookin around in he darkness of the woods.
Not again.
„Fleur delacoure“, Hermoine sighed, still thinkin about viktor krum.
A lot of students walked around and looked at them confused.
„very helpful.“ Ebony said sarcastically.
Don’t lie, it was or at least it looked like you were enjoying yourself quite a bit - to make up for the missed chapter you can beat him up a secund time at the end off the cahtter, alright?
Harry and Draco avoided to look at each otter.
„C‘mon, let‘s sit in the first row.“, Tia said. „I‘m here to learn, not to lose around.“
Jinx and Tina, sitting next to each other, were rather distracted for their many (unintendet) touches, just slightly brushing their ellbows or fingers, sending shivers down their spines, making tina blush a little and giving her goos bumps.
She ran into her room and shut the door.
„What even is a gun anyway?“, said Jinx.
„So where do you know my name from?“, he asked again.
“How so?” Hermoine placed hurself on the bed, yeeting her hair in a bun.
Ebony hesitated, she wasnt used to getting backflash like this at all.
“Dea, do you wont me 2 leaf u alone? I’m sorry I had to tell u dis, but I just…. Wanted to be truthfoul to urs.”
She supprised a giggling, it seemed he had barelyy changed on the inside.
„Stop harrassing me, you freak!“
It must feel so fluffy…. Izora though, trying not to blush and not to let her mind wander off.
„He sais he wants 2 help, so he go gonna do help§, Dumbledoor saiys. „Nodiscussion, I#m the headmaster."
"ok what do you wanna tel me now? You wanna talk me you think you are an animal in a former life and are now in a wrong buddy??"
#ok so tell me what reincarnation you feel like, I won't say anyone a word because of good ol times.""
She squinted her eyes.
Hermoine's side of the room was a lot more minimalistic, well better to say it was just her wardrobe (there was not even as much clothing in it asin Ryan's wardrobe , there were diverse black and dark grey jeans,hoodies, jackets, t-shirts..), a mirror and two big shelves full of books and little things she collected (small figurines of phoenixes,wolves and so on, stones and crystals) Her shoes also did not stand inside her wardrobe, they were placed in a small extre-shelf between the window she sat on now and the first book-shelf. In those shelves were to find old magic books, novels, old anatomy and herbalism books, mostly because of the awesome detailed illustrations which could be fiut inside these. She had been thinkink of doing an arts class for drawing next trimestr so she could draw herbs and so for her own grimoire
„The holidays start tomorrow, or better we are allowed to drive home 4 four days because off the visit off the ministry of magic.“
„Maybe the leek just wants to kill her and searches for her and when webring Eboby to the leek he will nit kill other students anyore."the blonde said smirking.
(See the end of the chapter for
„You two imbeciles!"Snape screamed. „Why did you even do any experiments with stuff youdont know anything about?!"
„Are u okay?“, Ryan asked, fallin 2 her knees beside him.
He clenched his jaw.
“Fuck off!” Jinx and Hermoine had to hold back each other to not gu straight to the thorauht of tdesi girls.
„You dont need to!" the door swung open and Ebony looked at them depressively, „I hate you, how can yoiu think about leaving me?ME?" She shooted and ran away, tears of blood streaming outta her eys.
Hermine just took a short look at them but ignored their teasing and stupid bla.
„Miss Granger, Mr Weasley, please follow me and hurry," she said.
„Although his prsonality and behavior is...rather annoying and misogynist, I wont be abe to assist you in this matter.“
He wanted to continue, but just in thus moment Professur Mcgoogle rushedinto the classroom.
“Questions?”
"my fluffy guniea pig" she mumbled with a smile, as they were finished
Beneath the wardrobe stood Ryans dressing table, with an oval mirror framed with floral embellishments. The whole furniture was painted all black and was completely overloaded with Ryans make-up stuff, which was like over 20 differently shaded and coloured lipsticks (from dark red to dark violet to brown to black and white) and more stuff. Hermione didn't even know what it was all good for..
She could her Nevilles slightly breath in the dorkness, but verythin else was quiet quiet.
He hesitated... should he go and sit nesxt to her? Where was her friend?Would Ryan come to class or was she skipping it today?s
„So here we are.“, said Dumbledoor as they reached the forest. „Got toghether in ur grups and then – have fun“ He flung his arms in the air.
„Yes, me and other Professors should go and search for the beast at night", Snape said.
Ebontx yscreamed in pain, depression and fear.
„Dat true," Izora said, leaning forward over the railing.
Or was it a trick??
„C’mon who doesnt want to learn everything about stuff that was so long ago that not even our 400-year old ghost teacher has actully witnessed it), she said.
Huh, it was always a pleasure to watch her read, Isora though, sideeying her friend , to not be too obvius.
„Does your change mean… you‘re gonna leave me too?“ Draco looked up and Harry breathed in.
„Oh, expensive does not equate having good taste.“ Jinx raised her eyebrows and the girl gasped angrily.
They walked through the darkness, following the screams until they found each otter agasin.
„Hey Ryan, whats wrong?“, she asked as Ryan sat down next to them“
“Yer awae?”
She couldnt help but laugh.
The other black haired followed and they were flirty and giggling and everything.
she didnt want to cry beacusse of a guy again,
In the golden hour the magic of Hogwarts could be felt strongly, good and evil magic...
For an definitely anser.
„I knew I heard a familiar voice.“, said a voice from behind.
Ryan shock her hat.
Ryan ihaled and wanted to shout at him again, when he just tilted forward, because Tina hit him with her (very big and very heavy) book.
„Whats this?", hermine asked Ryan, she could see that Ryan was super-pissed and angry.#
"Whadduo?";vampire asked, "Are you also worried about ebony"
„What is wrong with u? First this scene with ebony and now you're so bitchy talkin 2 me?!2, Draco wuz angry and hurt.
He didnt even quite remember what he had done – he kissed hermin, yes, ut he didnt remember deciding to do so. All he had been doing or thinking was like sinkinkg into dust he couldnt quite penetrate the fog.
His thughts didnt calm down een at knight.
It wuz a weird situstation for the Quidditch-players because they culdnot help and didnt know whot to do.
“My name is Dr. Julian Devorak ..”
„We must do something, when the teachers don't do something we have to,"said Hermine. „It cant gog on like this."
red shorts, blacj fishnets and black laquer boots-.. She made a bun with her blonde hair with blue tips and then played a game on her mobile-phone.
„Alrighty",Dumblekork said shrugging.
„Whot does this mean?", Hermina could hear ron whisper-shouted, heraby meaning he just asked in adead-silent room.
They didn’t talk much since the had the argument and since ebonx disappeared.
„Wait, no, thats not the point!" Drace said, knoe'wing it was senseless.„We also tought it might be good 4 u because of all dis stuf fhappenin at de m...mo...moment!"
He thought he had lost her.
Well I’m the narrator so technicaly yeah, but we already have enough people lurking arpund and too many fandoms clash at this school.
The day wen by rather unspectecular.
She nodded and they treid finding them.
„What happened?!, screamed Neville who woke up shocked and hopped put of bed immedeately.
„So you go with Ron, Hermine and Draco, as you and Draco are a coupleright.", Dumbledor said.
“I will fucking ruin them!”, Jinxes teeth looked even more beasty than Ryans in the fading sunlight.
He stepped into the hallway and they watched him go away, his cloak floating with every move.
„Because we are no normal, boring, muggle school, Professor.“, Ryan said, grinning.
Draco nodded silently.
“You’re just like him.”
The boys were still sleepin when she woke up.
“Is that why you dress so slutty, to make up for your missing femininityy?”
„No.“, Prof. Mcgonogal winked her argument away. „As a teacher, i am still restraied by the headmasters orders...but you are not directly...“ She looked at them conspiratorilly. „So make sure I catch you stopping him, so there will be no consequences.“
Ryan wore an oversized plain black shirt, black overknees and black boots with a 6cm heel, she had some black hairties around her waist to make a bun later in class for potions & pastries.
#“Me? It wasn‘t me who threw a tantrum and demanded nt to be Vampire anymore!“, Draco cried.
They finally found toghether after the break.
Fleur culdnt hide her devilish smile, as she walked through the emptyy hallwas of this goddarned old school. This building had nothin compared to boatbatonx, this school felt old and weak, just like their haedmister.
What should she di know?
The arriving of Hermone reminded him what t had really meant to have friends, reL FRIENDS and to be oneself.
Satan looked at her as if she waz completely mad.
„Professur McGonogal“, Isora (A/N: Ryans sister, in case u forgot) yeeted the door to mcgoggles bureau open. „If this asshole of a durmstrang student will ever think of looking at my sister ever again I will-“
„Freak, who you call a freak huh? Look at you, bitch.“, he said annoyed and Ryan took a few steps back. Then, a smile  stumbled across his lips. „Now come here, we still have time to do you-know-whot before you have to attend your bring class…. Or I just make you skive, huh, whatcha say?“
„How long ill it take lupin to be here at hogwarts?“
„Oh fuck Vampire," he screamed." Call me Harry like a normal person!" [
It was yeard be4 Ryan attended Hogwarts taht he flew in2 the forest and hadnt be seen by anybody again...since now.
Hermine and Ron arrived at the school as the teachers ran outside to lock after them.
The wind shook the treetops and a strange feeling creeped on t  his baacxck.
The class laughed.
„But…..“ she looked around, all the other beds of the infirmry had no bedding on them, there were just the bare mattresses. „I dont want to sleep on the couch either...“
And what shed she do?
„Please if u know anything, tell us, it would help a lot. „Ryan explained. „Look at neville, the leek attacked him and injured him severely, the leek already killed students!“
The next day of course everybody at the school had already heard about this inzi-, insidun-, inzeden…- about what had happund.
„Yeah,I gotta same impresiion too...," Har- Vampre said thinkingly. He put on a red shirt, he also wore black jeans and dark grey sneaker.„Maybe the relationship beween us developd and we are just not meant for each other ya no?"
Ron looked at hiimself in the mirror and removed his thick black eyeliner. He didnt want to be friends with the gothic-clique anymore,it had been a phase and a really dumb one too.
Long time no see, we wish you all a late Happy New Year and  now you don't get just Chapter 8 but also Chapter 9 ;P
They begann unpacking their stuff and sorting it into the cupboardz andcapinets.
„Professor Dumblefork, what should we do? Who should we let go into the forest? It's a very dangerous task!"
Dawn and Izora wore normal clothing – Dawn a skater-dress with a universe-print, black leggins and black laquer combat boots, a violet long coat and fluffy ear-warmers; Izora wore a red shirt with „I hate people (and pants)" in white letters on the front, ripped denim blue jeans, red boots, a black beanie and a black coat, as well as her yellow-black-striped hufflepuff scarf (although hufflepuff didnt play today, but it was just so waaarm!111).
They kissed passionately and pne thing went to aother....
„Why did you react like this?“
“This is nothing you shuld say to a teacher.”, he muttered.
They were not the onlly onez who went to bedt really late.
„Whot do u mean?“, se asked, really confused.
?yeahs", he mumled
“...Ok….” Ryan sat down on her saet. She wore an asymetric dress with a high slit in the left, long sleeves &aturttleneck, black lipstick nd white eyliner today. Her long black hair shimmered in the morning light.
"Shut up Hermoine, youre just here for like one day and-", Droco began.
„We need to get into the forbidden forest and find out if there are more leeks or other mutatetd plants out there!" Mc Google said.
“So, chapter 18? And now? I didn’t get to hit him!”
“Aaaaaaah!”, they screached preppily and stupidtly as the both grew wolfs ears.
And first of was Ryan…
Izora froze, her haart droped 2 her stomck.
He was confused.
The girls laughted, a s-laughter in these dark times where every hope seemed senseless.
Herminee stood up of de bad, she had a course startung early whitch Ryan did not attend.
Tina stood there, still, leaving them to hiss and curse each other and slowly pulled out her wand.
Drace didnt recognize
But whot happened to drako and harry? And Evonty and Crapp and Groyle?
After a few minutes in silence, she suggested to get b4ck to the castle.
She sighed – so much.
It's been a while - now enjoy Chapter 11✨✨
„Oh god, not again!" screemed Ryan, as she and Hermine wanted to go upstairs to their classes. „That's enough!" she scriecked. „Iwill no longer let my little sister walk arounf anywere without me!"
„I wanted to have themosht bootiful flower of all class, i wanted it to be grwoing fastand be black like my goffik sol.", Enoby said. [
"Hey girls, what are ya up to?" Neville said with a charming smile,every other girl at this school would have melted, seeing that glance in his grey eyes..
All he could think about was Hermine and Draco kissing, which filled himwith a dark numb feeling.
“Well.. thut wuz awkwarrrrddddd.”, Jinx mumured; she wore her hair lue and in space buns, she wore shorts with studs on them, a black shirt that resembled a corset, blue fishnets, black botts, a fluffy black bag and nude lipstick (A/N keepin’ it classy ya know).
„I know, nevertheless, Im sorry but youre so beautiful and sexy.“, he siad flirtingly. „I dreamt about kissing u sonce u arrived here.“
„It was sooo exhausting,“, hermoine rolled her eyes. Of course back then he wuz older and somehow interesting, but… of course he wuz a taboo now that his best friend had hurt Ryan this badly....Nevertheless hermoine kept thinkingabout his trained body and his dark mysterious eyes….
Ryan sighed.
He locked at hur.
“W-!”, >Drace wanted to protest, but haerry hit him with a “Shut the fuck up!” and the docotr continued his lesson.
“What? Older men? I thought she felt something for me, how can she throw herself into his arms right away??”, Neville sounded enraged and Fleur had to hold back to not grin widely.
The dark knight went down on the castle, the girls were sleeping, but one of our other known beings was lying awake. [
They headed to the forbidden forest, the sun slowly sinkin to the horizon.
He growled but didnt answer, although he knew she wuz reight.
Because of the escaped mutant leek there now was a case of emergency and there were newsafetyy masures taken.#
It was Ryan, an old friend of Hermina. They kew each other since the timebefore Herminesfive-trimester long students-exchange at beaux-button. Ryan alsolooked just like da awsom tattoo-artist Ryan Ashley Malarkey,  and was as annoxed of thebeauxbaton-ladies as Hermine was. They got alng very well and wroteletters during the time of de exchage.
"C'mere Karl", she said and sat the little gyy on her shoulder.
„I know whot u mean but… character developement can sometimes be very drastic I mean… in the time when we were together with Ebiny there was so much anger and… I dont know it somehow bursted out if me...“
But… wasn‘t this all getiing too complicated? What if Jordan attacked Neville?
„CRAP! GOYLE!“ she screamed for quite a while, and walked in the direction she thought they had come from before they built their hut fr the night.
„What Why?“ she looked at him inser´cure.
„Which lord, this is england, here are a lot of lords“, Hermoine said dryly.
„What the fucking bloody hell is wrung with y'all?! What did appen 2 all mycool goff friends? Why are y'all acting weird?!"
Passing the door, Hermoine and Ryan began laughing mysteriously- and fullgave a high-five to each ther.
Severul students had been brutallie killed by the leek, at knight, in the shaduws.
The leek jumped to Ryan and she kicked it away, some parts of the leek were teared apart nd the leek was only half and had just one eye left, because the other eye sticked on ryans shoe.
"Crap," she thought, arming herself, because she thought he wpuld say something stupid andattacking her for yesterday when she and Ryan fought with ebonyy.
“So I woke u?”
„So…..“ Satan turned around. „Wha happened in front of the school entrance?“ He askked.
„Its okay, everythings alright.
His cheeks turned slightly red.
He flounced his hair at the end of the lessons
Hermine looked arund.
Crabbe and Goyle told everyone that Ebonu went missin in the woods, hagrid and some lesser known teacher went to search for her (the loss wouldn‘t be that great if they wouldnt come back, ya know?)
“Wait a sec, dr devork what are you even doing here? Your class is once a week, this is professtur wonka s class.”
Hetook a look at vampire, still sleepin.
The leek attacked again, this time neville.
She looked around in the small hut they had built before.
„He‘s such a douchebag, we‘re gonna fuck him up, if he ever tries anything ever again.“ Tina said. „We‘ll smear his brain on the dungeon walls, if neccessary.“
Ryan and Neville also tried to find the wy back home and came across a guy hanging headfirst from a treee.
„Why?!",Ron and Hermine, Ryan and Neville said at the same time.
She took off her fuzzy beanie and sat down on the windowsill.
“Oh, it’s not that gurl Riley, is it?”
Madam Pomfrey had found im/ hunted him drown  and brought him back t the infirmary, because he still had sme healing to do and needed to rest. They had agreed on meeting between the lessons, if posible… but she never had thought some girls could be in her way… well yes, he after all was the quidditch star….
He fainted.
Ryan aslo looked behind them, her eyes glass like, hate, but also fear and insecurity raging in the,
Not just that they still didnt kno how to deel with the leak, there were also rumors that they thought of closing down Slytherin( for it was the house with a bad aura), or even Hogwarts as a whole because it would become too dangerous. It wuz not cleer, if the mutation of the leeks may also spread to other plants – or creatures! The forbidden forest was widely known for bein dangerous and inhabiting mythical creatures, who knew whaot wood happen or whot this dark magic could create out of these already horrifying creatuerres!
“Sure.” She smiled widely and they sat byi to each otter.
„What‘s wrong?“, Neville asked, sensing something had happened.
Izoras heart pounded loedly in her chess.
Neville was confused.
Satan couldnt stahp staring a th4t strang3 gurl in the bed nxt to him. She seamed confused when thee met this day, but as sonn as theyd been alone she tried to seduce him or someh´thin? She tried tob e sexy in her school.unifurm or so and wuz like, soooo what do we do now???111!
„Sure, I wanted to save a little so I could grow more night-black plants.", Ebony answeredas if this had been the most stupid quession in de univers. [
"Hey, you wanna-be-goth or what?" Hermine heard Enony saying. "What a prep."
„Severus, it doesn'tpay!" he said. Today he was wearing a black shirt with whitesplatters all ver it because he thought that was a thing the youngkidz would think was cool. [A/N: None of the studentsor his collegues thought it was cool. He's the goddamn headmaster forF*cks sake!]
______________________________________________________________
Hermine and Jinx looked inside the room from outsie'de the window, they hided behind some bushes and used a spell to be able to hear what was said on the inside.
Hello, Lovers of the fine arts,
The trombones began playing and the Gryffindor-team flew in, accompanied by the loud cheers of the Griffondorks. Then the Slytherins flew in and the Slytherins cheered,
„Hello.“, she said, still confused how she ended up here and not in the mood for giving a moody answer.
„Whats si funny?“
Dawn (A/N Ryans sister) was beautoful, her silky black hair was short and shimmered in the light.
„Yeah.“
Nobody dared to sit on the empty seat between them, so on this seat and table were stored all the books and writing materials.
Drace froze and looked at hr s if she was  giant snake and he was mouse.
„What did just happn?!" she asked arrogantly and got up. „So he a prep now, huh?"
"do you know what an other kin is?" He asked nervously, cuttin her word off *it means you feel like an animal or a character, like you're born in a wrong, a human (or wizards) body'b
„No its important you get some rest to get your wounds healed….“ She couldnt lock him in the exe. It was an awkward situation 4 her, because of the kiss and all...
Our account is a save place for every member of the LGBTQAI+ community! We stand with you!
„As you wish, Miss Badass.“, Jinx winked at them and turned around as Tina arived their little round.
The scream had faded.
"Well ok," he said. "Yar right sheds gotta nice body but neverthelessEbiny is my only true love."
"Dont ya dare say "gofth" now you liddle bitch!" herminne grumbled.
At each step which was taken by the studentds, there was a certain hesitation, listening closely if there ere any suspicius noises.
Ryan looked back at him.
Ryan locked around, the infirmarx was gloomy and cold, she shivvered.
Today subject was about spells castet inside bakery goods as a liquid core. Mostly used for counter-curses and as medicine against certain poisons.
And this upsets you this much that you decided tointerrupt me?
„Whats wrong?" she asked, as he stopped and looked at her.
„Im gonna kill muself you funking bastards!" she screemed and theycould hear her search a razor or knife or somethin.
The nurse took care off nevills woonds.
As she looked around everythin looked as grey as before – she wondered how long she had been lying here. Ebony walked up the hill she had falen down from, still covered in dry leaves and dirt.
Tina wore arust coloured vintage dress withyellow boots, looking like the impersonalisation of a cottegecore dream. Jinx wore a red velvet dress with hood, the hood draped fluently over her blue wavy hair. She wore a koining red lipstick and rded fake lashes.
With unflinching courage he sat next to her.
„Lets search fr Izora and go back home!" Ryan said
"Yup," Hermione thought.
„Think about the one who u really wanna be with, think about Vampire.“
Where did he go?
He looked at her, surprised that she talked to him.
„But we cant wait one or two days for anybody to arrive, we need to find them NOW, before more things happen!“, Professur Mcgonogol said.
„Everyhing ok?“
Maybe he wuz just his imagination?
Out off the blu the marauderererers mab matriliezed and floppte in Tinas amred.
No problem, now go beat him, but lemme watch!
Neville didnt answer and just followed her, still concerned because of her reaction a few minutes ago.
She drew her pastel-mint-green, curled haer over her shuulder. Then she searched for her cigarettes in her big, black, fluffy-monster bag.She took out the little pack with green-neon-letters „Voldemint- menthol cigarettes" on it.
„Hey Drago," vampire said calmly. „maybe we should talk to Ebony, her behavoir has brought all of us in big danger."
“Probs.”
„Oh c whos dere?“, a girl looking like an goffik-instagram mua looked at them, doin a duckface with her inflated lips, painted in bright neon yellow. „It#s hermoine.“
the room filled with students from time to tim.
Ryan was so happy to c him and wonted to stand up and huck him, but caime to the conklusion that he m8t fall if she justbumped at him.
They searched for her a long time, and also found a way out of the forest by doing this.
“You can go, I’ll help here.
She didn’t mean anything to him...
„Soits decided.", he said. „Now we go!"
„Bom-“, he wanted to do a spell but the leek attacked him and he lost him wand.
a group of extras walked past them jabberin „The beauxbeton girls arrived this mornin, did cha c demß“ - „Yeah h m god, they so sexah and goffik“ „Dis url from tde trimagical tournament fleur is also here, also she f+ckin sucked at the tournament, despite bein one of da best“ (AN: it#s true and y‘all kno this)
They reminded silent.
Maybe he was just going insane, just as all the people here believed?
We hope you have all been well and stay safe during these crazy times!
He tilted his head a little.
She entered the class room.
He cpuld see one of the grandstands fall and some fleeing leeks which ran into the forbidden fprest. Draco gasped.
„What‘s wrong with me? I culd rather ask u they same!“, said Harry. „You are acting weird ately.“
"Whaddup?"she asked angrily. What was the fuckinh problem with this fuckingteacher?!!"!
Drace couldnt help but smirking at this stupid scenario, ebony doing siómething stupid and bringing every1 else in trouble 2.
„So,lets see if Neville will be as sure 4 success as last week," Ryan said, lowkey condescending. „I mean we always lose againstGriffindoor."
„Idiot.“, draco mumbled. „You shouldnt have done thiass, you should stay in the hospital.“
„Whot?“
„We‘ll never get outta here are we?“, asked Draco, freezing because it wuuz shady and dork in the furest.
" "alittle fat" was mean", he said pouting.
Hermoine still fixated the path they took with dark, hatred clouded eyes.
She nodded.
„oh yeah?“he said and looked around, barely lighting up thre dork with his wand.
Her eyes hurtet but now it becam bettar. The big hall in front of her was filled wit students. Talking, chating, whisparing end laugtehr came to her eir.
Hermoine laughed (A/N: of course mysteriously and dark, as it suits a proper goth character).
After Potions & Past(r)ies they went to Herbalism, after this there was History of Magic and after that one hour of old Runes and their Magic Meaning and an hour of Transformation.
Draco laughed silently depressed.
"I'm not sure, they brew some sort of potion and gave it to the plant and that leek grew veryfast and was really big and then it ran away!"
]. Her short mint-green hair was curled and her black boots had a spiderweb-pattern on it.
And then more leaks broke through the other grandstands and ran on the field. The grandstand of our Slytherin girls was so broken, it fell over!
“Do you nee help?”, Ryan looked at the new professor who clearly needed help
“Hey, sweetcheeks, where to?”
„That#s true.“, Ryan exclamation-mark.
Enjoy chapter 12✨✨
"Miss Raven Way, I don't care why or if your other teachers care if you're late or even check your attendance. But I do and every student has to be here on time, do you understand?"
He reached out his hand to help her up.
„Yes, I fink youre right...“, he answered. „So how bout u and Ron?“
“Well now I am.” His voice was dark and mysteroius and sexy and gothic and so on.
2No no don't tell them they're not even real friends to me, I just though stickin with them is not as worse than getting mobbed bay then.
There were made new passwords for the common-rooms of the houses (although it was pretty unlikely the leek could talk or something). [
Ryan froze and hermoine looked over her shoulder.
“Don’t you wanna come over?”, he murmured, seemingly embarrassed.
Ryan changed her clothing in a slytherin-green long dress (with a scalespattern on) with a slight schimmer and a deep v-neck, silver snakeearrings and long matte black nails.
„I know, and it is your total right to think of them as – as you said - superficial and phony bitches, nevertheless, please try to keep your attitude,“ Mcgockle said. „ there are many outsiders here at the moment, some of which I#m not sure are fond of our school and would love to use such disputes against us. Not to forget, we are in as state of emergency because of a goddamn leek.“
„Taht‘s going to be expensive… „ Dumbledoor mumbled.
.“, Ron added. „I think they went this way.“ he said and pointed somewhere in the dark.
„Hello students, fans, friends, and colleagues!"Dumblebore shpouted. „In these dark times we still want to have some fun! So We want to see a fair match – so let the better team be the winner!"
„Professur dumbledroe ordered to let them try freely, without restrains-“
“Hm, this new teacher… Dr. Dorf- no, Dr. Dings- eh….”
„Diablo!?"Ebony said, as he crossed her way. She even barely regocnized himbecauze he wuz wearin weird clothins. He had put on a blackVoldemint-Shirt (red letters), grey jeans and black sneakers. „ Ihavent seen ya 4 days! And what the hell are you wearing? Are you afucking prep now just like vampire? What is wrong with u boyz at themoment??"
„Do you still have something from this potion?" Snape asked-,
„I now she has no classes yet, i go gonna gether," Ryan turned around and stormed down the stairs to the Hufflepuff-tower. She wore a black oversized shirt which said „ont talk to me" in white letters on the front, black shorts that disappeared under her long shirt and black overknee-boots. On her hand she had a bracelet with rings on,it looked like skeleton-bones.
„The beauxbexton girls.“ Hermoine rolled her eyes. „They are so superficial and sooo phony.“
"Of course, she turned out to be ooretty sexy, not such an odd, boringcreature with fluffy har as she used to be before she left."
But he didnt..
She was an acceptable actress, as you may think. He believed her, and something sparked in him.
""Yeah!" said Vampire.
She had set her trap up as she was wandering through the woods with drace to find the otthers. Draco had no idea what she was doin, just as harry and ron he was just like under-average as a student and did not know even like half of the spells and curses that Hermoine did.
***TRIGGER WARNING: (sexual) harassment in the beginning of this chapter***
So many lies.
„It worked out I think.“, thought Hermine, „The trap I set up for her transported her back to the time she visited as she had to seduce  Voldxemort aka Satan. But this time she wont be able 2 come back...“
She opened her mouth, butt no werds came out.
"Yeah, you may know this from the Weasley's shop or Woods Sooper Dooper Shop (
„Yu cant go alone to your room, it far 2 dangerous.“, Neville said, holding her bag by slightly touching her arm.
She giggled nervously as Satan looked to da site.
“courde we Cn2
Night sunk over the castlle of hogworts and and everyone went to sleep,even Hermoine and Ryan, still with lotsa eating-stuff lyin around onall tables, nighststands and their cases which still stoodeverywhere around in the room.
“h mr malfloy, I think the young lady is reigt.” Dr devorak yeetet the rest of the stuff on the bog ol mahagoy table. “And your abilities can’t copete with hers, as I heard, so maybe be careful.”
Ebobby gasped and all of the people around looked at the fighting groupamazed.
“Ok, good point tho. O I’ll think I be ok if I go alne. Just a question, where is he?”
When they were in their room, Ryan changed in her Conquer-Divide-Bandshirt, which was wayy too big, because it was oversied-fit, and a black shorts for pyjamas.
"I cannt even tell, its so long ago I even bekked anxthing," Hermoine said quietly.
Ebony starred @ the ceiling off the roomba.
She didnt know what to say, she couldnt imagine what he wanted fro hernow--
„Stop bitchin around. „ said the blonde gurl, fleur dela beton.
Her girlsfriends also had alo have some aces up their sleeves, to sow discord and finally break this school, so they would finally shut thisdisgutstnag wohole down.
They got up. Ryan wore a black knotted blouse so one culd c her belly (which wuz of course super flat and trained, just because), she wore a dark anthrazit coloured jeans and black doc martens. She ore thick black eyeliner and long black lashes and some nude matte lipgloss. Hermoine wore a long black hoodie with an even longer red shirt underneath, black tighs and blck plateau boots, she wore her mint green hair in a bun and wore black eyeliner and dark brown lipstick on her lips.
Whot if… she was just another name on a list again?
She didnt replie, just took a short look at him, remaining silent.
„Fuck off Jordan“, she said, but he had already stepped near them (although viktor, who stood next to him, tried to hold him back) and put an arm around Ryan sshoulders.
„Cut it out already.“ Hermoine hissed, barely lookin @ her.
„No,my sister"!, yelled Ryan and tried to go back to find her, but it wuz impozzible to walk through the panicking crowd.
So thirsty-
„Disgusting.“, she hissed and walked away without even looking at him.
„Yeah I know, its been when I was like fourteen when...“
Tina and Jinx entered the broom behind harry, holding hands.
Draco shivered.
„So, I demand you not to brng any damage to the highly revered name of the house Slytherin; Mr. Riddle will show you everything and accompany you in your frst week of skull.“
He had been walking down the floors, not knowing where to go, because he hadbeen so angry about
Jinx nodded and Tina squeezed her hand.
In this exact Moment the door flew open and there was.... not Ebony but Professor Sproot.
Vampire didnt answer and just held him in his arms..
Snape wanted to hit Vampire, butDumblrdor intervened.
„So where are her suitcases?“, Satan asked Prof. Mcgonohul, who was still with them to make clear that this was an absolute exception.
We realized that we haven't posted anything this year yet. This chapter's been sitting in a folder for quite some time, but everything's so crazy right now, hence the lack of (literary-award-worthy) content.
“So, what happened?”
„It's the famous WillyWonka", Ryan said excited. „You know him?"
ok, Well played… so you wanna go hit him right now or wait till tomorrow? Do you need someone to help? Jinx? Hermoine? The Avatar?
„Yeah Slytherin!" Izora shouted depressingly happily.
Also: Black Lives Matter!
Some of them tried to flee and run back to the forbidden forest, where the camel from.
„Professor mcgongoal! If Jordan ever comes near me or my sister ever again I swear-!!!“, Ryan stormed through the open door, stopping confused, as she saw her sister.
„Oh no we have lost tehm!“, she said.
Hrmoine followed her and even Viktor just looked at his friend (who kneeled coughing on the ground) , shook his and left .,for he really asked himself why he wuz still friends with this asshole.
"No, Crako and Ron.".Hermine answred. "As if Ebiny would get up this early.."
She smirked to herself, it was not possible for anybody else to „fall“ into the other dimension because she set u the time turner and the letter-spell especially for Ebon<.
He dint want to scare her or hurt her...
And it was absolutely clear that Vampire and Draco had no idea about Ebony being such alying, condescending, egocentric piece of shit. Maybe they just didnot want to see her real self because thhey were in love. Maybe theyhoped their love could chage her into a betta persona.
What’s going on?
New companions, new enemies and alotta foreshadowing in this chapter
Ryan sat there seepin, but neville still sat in the darkness and seemed awake.
What did just happen?
He looked at her, confused.
„I remember ur photo hanging in hogwarts.“
"Assholes.", Ryan said. "They think they're sooo cool and sooo special." She shookher head. "Especially that lil whore Ebony, she fucks with likeevery boy who finds her attractive."
“What do you men?” Ryan didn’t lock @ her friend.
„Ron!“, Hermine screamed, but didnt get a response.
And what would that be? How dare you interrupt me?
Ron layed beside her, still sleepin.
„At least a day.“ Dumbledor nodded. „But he will be helpful even if the kidz find their way out before.“
In dark blue ink wuz to be read „This is a Time Turner. (A/N it turns time, if you couldn‘t tell) You can travel back in time what do you wish had never happened?“
They stood up and ebony did not know what to say, she just looked at themgoin away with lots of food on their plates.
Her eyes flew over the mass of students and hung by a smoll grupe of gothics. It was Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and her boyfriends Draco and Vampire.With them stuud Diablo, who shed better known as Ron, before hebeacame sorta weird cause of all this pseudo-goffic-satanist- things.
„Oh no.“ Stan answered. „I was pretty important in the first part, actually.“
„You are the ones we decided to go to the forbidden forest to search forthe leek- or the leeks- or what else.", Fumblrdoor said.
Later that night, as they were back in their room, Hermoine asked.
Fleur snapped with her fingers and the girls followed her away.
"Your teacher," he said. "Sit down now."
„Yeah its strange.", she said then.
Herminn couldnt remember Ryan beinn interested in any guy at dis schol evr...
Where could she be…?
„Sorry,you must feel strange now talkin 2 me.", he said, instantly fellinguncomfortable to, and curdsing himself for his dumb idea. Of couseshe didnt want 2 talk to him, she kissed drco and they were nofriends anymore. He had been hanging around with the gothic-cliqueand Ebonu, of course she disliked him too.
"Whats wrong?!" Enob looked questioningh at drako and harry.
„Ssssshhhhhh“, said Ryan. She acknowledged hermoines hate towards krum, just because he wuz da best frind of her (Ryans) ex-boyfriend,.
„Hexy, Vampire..," Drako said, he wanted to calm him down, his outrage would do nothing better and he knew that later vampire would besueper sorry.
She looked utside against.
„Because I didnt know either.“, Professur Mcgonoggal said. „Professur Dumdlekork didnt tell me anything, I also am afraid nothing is prepared for her.“ She shook her head.
The Hufflepuff girl beside her chuckled and shook her head.
The landholding of hogwortswas lying in the dork, wind blowing through the grass, so that it moved a little in the bare moonlight.
He mechanically walked on, til he was standing in the floor to the hufflepuff-tower.
„Whot, why??“, again simultaniouslyy they stared at her.
“Neat.”, she murmured. “Thank you.”
She tried to focus on the subject in class and the different ingeredients that should be used to achieve the right liquid.
Ryan rolled her eyes and helped him.
„Oh I am sorry, her majesty the queen of darkness is somuch more helpful than me, „he said hatefully.
“So will ya, or will ya just think abut it?”, Dawn muttrerde 2 hörself, without lookig up from her buk.
„Of course they told you to search 4 me, I‘m the Slytherin-house leader, I just wonder why they din‘t tell me...“
“No“ she shook her head.
“Nothing abut me is average.”, hehe whispered in his rustique, dark voice and a smirk on his lips.
He had a strange feeling that maybe all this was connected – hermino commin back, the leeches, ebonx disappering, the new teacher, all the students from other schools
„Areyou stupid?!!! Mcgonogull said. „You should stay at the infirmary,boy!"
“Hm, one of the goths?”
After haf an hour of searching she decided herself to wear a short black jumpsuit with a deep neckline on da back and goffik patches all over it. Pink fishnets with pearl in form of bats and little orsnge pumpkins and her beluved black bikerboots made it perfcct. She whore her hair in a bun with two long bloody needles stuck in (to maybe stick it into the eye of dis bitch hermina.... who knew?)
“Yull pay 4 dis you disgusting vampire bitches!”
„You can sleep in my bed.“, Neville said.
Helooked at her, slightly konfused because ha hed been lost in histhoughts, than he asked:
Ryan could hardly decide between still being angry and being grateful for neville being here.
It was the and of the lesson.
She looked at the letter and thught this was a joke at first. But then she thought about it – what did she wish had never happened?
At the end of ceremony all kinds of food apperad on da tables and allbegan eatin.
Ebubu chuckled, dis scull was so perv, in every possivle wasy. She thought about the time she, draci and vampirt cayme togetheas and all her teachers wantinh to fuck her and Lopiun and Snake takin Videos of her naked ans so in..
Ryan sighed, maybe there hadn’t been something between them-
"I knew someone had stolen things from my stock," Snape said and stood up heroically."Who are the students who fucked shit up?" [
„Better.“, he said, rising his hand careflully to pat her head.
His hunger neayl ate him laive, he felt like ablack hole had emerged into his stomuch.
„Why first row, ?“ Jinx whined but was already standing up. She wore a black v-neck cropped top with long sleeves witch had cut-outs on the soulders and thumb holes, light blue ripped shorts, black boots with heels, black nailpolish, a fuzzy backpack, dark burgundy lipstick and blac eyeliner (AN so any questions? Anything I didnt mention? Maybe her underwear? Black lace.)
The boys also covered their ears, the lamp exploded and ron threw the lamp away.
Jinx, on the opposite wore a blackshirt with a bolero on tp which had an iridescent green dragon scale pattern. And high waist black jeans and black demonia boots with a huge platform. Her nails were super long and also green and she wore green lipstick and blac eyeliner.
They told the teachers that she went missing and that they couldnt find her, after that the went to their dorm and sleeped for two days straight.
What happened?
Tina laughed. A beautiful, melodic laugh, that made Jinx feel warm and fuzzy inside, but the sincerity with ehch she had spoken somehow resonated with a strange feeling sh’s had for the past days too.
Whywas every1 leavin her know? Ebonu couldnt undastand. Why wasnt shethe admired one anymore?
Hermoine and Jinx sat in the fourth ro and were chattng, Harry and Draco sat in the third row, one empty seat between them, they didnt look at each otter and didnt talk; and Ron sat alone at the end of the second Row.
“Stop maing so much noise.”, Satan sneered annoyed and ebovys whole body flinched, it nearly hurt.
‚Okay so I thing I am a...." He sighed * a guinea  pig kin, i feel like a guniea pig
He saw how Draco hold on to her and pressed his pale lips onto hers.
An honest, happy smile.
“Its against the rules.”, he repetted, as his stomach gave a lout growl away.
He did not see her slapping him.
“Eh….”, Izora stuttrerd.
"And I dont have tot take your shit kiddo," Hermeoine interrupted."Let's go Ryan."
„So what do u want?“, she asked, a little nervous.
She scremed and fell down the sill.
She sobbed.
„It's called Cybergoth."Hermine explained. „All dis gurl on beaxbatonns were so lame withtheir gothik- or punk stuff lookalike."
You could see, how the professur clenched her teath.
Also Hermine and Ryan ran away, by this they lost Dawn and Izora!
„Thats very interesting.“, he said unenthusiastically, holding up the lamp so the could see more.
„But whos dis otta guy?“, hermoine asked. Ryan went silent, she couldnt confirm it fort hey coulddnt c his face yet, but she wuz afraid it wuz her ex-boxfriend Jordan.
Hermoine grinned silently, nomming a muffin with a little grey mouse made ofmarzipan on top.
„Why are yo sitting so far away from the board?“ Tina said loud, as Jinx waved them to come.
“This dickhead?”
Whoo, look who arose from the dead again!
Oh right, she remembered, she had used the time turner, of course nobody was here….so she just tried 2 find a way out – and oh wonder! She fount out of he forest!
to this point...♥
] pins withskulls and bats on them. Her black eyeloiner wuz smugded, as well asher blood red lipstick.
„The kidz are still missin‘“ Dumblefork said and walked around in his office, avoiding to walk on his own long white beard. „
„Im sorry.“, he said with a choked voice, nearly crying sexily.
“Yer early, where the fuck have ye been.”, Hermoine looked at her. She wore a black off-shoulder shirt, a green/black chequed skirt (slytherin pride tiches), black  overknee boots. Her mint curls dancing around her shoulders she looked at ryan, still waitung for an answer.
„Yes, he now teaches in the subject
„It was an accident,Professzr."; Vampirt said. „Im not sure whot was inside thisbrew, but the effect was nit the intended one."
The girls followed and looked tough the wndow inside the infantry.
*Foreshadowing! Of course this is going to happen in one way or another, because we want to create unnessesary drama, bitches!*
She looked at him again.
„That‘s true.“ Hagrid and his dog appeared in the dor. „I will go lock 4 them.“
When he arrived n his room he felt reieved for he wuz alone, nevertheless the room felt empty without his beloved boyfriend.
So what had it been that wke her app?
a new danger threatens the students of Hogwarts ....
“What?”, the flustered girl mumbled.
„Ist not acting weird to realize all this fake gothic-stuff is stupis.",he said and left.
„Dawn!"he heard a voice shouting and Ryan came from behind and flung her arms around the girl. „You okay? Ys? Are you hurt? What happened?You were suddenly gone, I couldnt find u!"
“Well and there’s also her ex, who tries to get near her again….”, Fleur cntinued, unbothered by Neville slowly loosing his temper.
is a textbook of magic,typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits and demons. Source: Wikipedia]
(he gets knocked out tho)
So Ryan, Neville and the boy from the quidditch theme – Tom- went on the left, Hermine, Ron, Draco and Harry went on the right and the other groups went anywhere else into the forest.
„No, it doesnt!" Vampire screamed angrily, Drago had never seen him dis angry eva be4. „I got in trouble bevause of U! All of the students are now in trouble because of U! Because u dont think, you diont think ov any1 else than yourself!"
"Alright, hope to see you there tomorrow," Neville said, still smirking, taking a last short look at Ryan before moving on.
After a few hours of unseccusfull searchin in the woods hagrid returned, it was already afternoon and because winter was ahead it was already gettin dark again.
„You go guuurl!“, Tina said pointing at Ryan with fingerguns (AN: yes, bear with me). Tina wore a light grey blouse and dark grey jeans with dusky pinnk coloured sneakers and a pendant with a white crystall. She had short street-mutt blond curly hair. She also hadfreckles and wuz all in all not goffik at all.
Ryan froze, she didn’t move an inch, completely different from Neville, he smiled and kept talking to her friendly. He din’t really react to her avances, but he also did nothing to stop her.
Se wasnt used to that,  normally everybody thot she wuz hit and wanted to date her, and here all thpse preps were trying to learn and get good grepes an such.
Hermione I have to tell you something", ron, eh, said as he woke up beside her and noticed she was also awake.
She was so angry and exectly knew who wuz to blame- B'loody Mary!
„Why do you know my name?“, the boy asked, now tkin a step back cause he was sorta confused.
„Yo, Ryan.", Herminesaid and turned to her friend.
„What‘s that got to do with? What are you even talking abaout?“, hissed Draco.
„C‘mon hon-“
„Whycant you just accept people withput judging them for clothing?"
“Minus five points.” Devorek turned around and squinted at Draco. “for Slytherin.
Whilst the little goth-group walked poutside, Hermoine and Ryan had changedin their pyjamas and sat on Ryans bed, eating all the stuff theybrought from the great hall with them. They had cookies (chocolate,vanilla, nut, nougat, bat-shaped ones, some with edible glitter on),all sort of pies – hearty meat pies (like calf pie, lentils pie,goulash pie, sheperds pie , pie with mushrooms, cheddar pies, potatopies) and sweet pies (ssuch as pumpkin pies, banana-chocolate pies,banoffee (banana and toffee) pie, Caramel-Apple Pie, raspberry pie,lime pie, lil vanilla-flavoured pies in mugs, nut pies etc), andmuffins and little cupcakes with all sort of decoration (e.g.vanilla-flavour with a white topping that looked lik a ghots,pumpkin-muffins, muffins with chocolate spiders on, some littlemuffins looking like day-of-the-dead-sugar skulls) etc etc etc pp.
„No,it is also my fault, I didnt stop her to do her strange experiment, Iwann help<.!"
Although Crap and Coyle were pretty funny guys and wanted to cheer her up, it didnt work.
Maybe he should talk about it with her but he didnt want to annoy her awy straight away.
"How do we want to tell her?", Draco asked helessly,
„What are we gonna do know
“I uhm, actually, there is somebdy I’m interested in, but Im not shore she feels the same...”
Also have a wonderful Halloween, we even get a full moon this Halloween🌕
"Oh yeah, just becauseof her super-short slutty skirts and the transparent shirts andcorsets shes wearing all the time. And then these cheap, uglyfishnets..." Ryan shook her head.
„Lumos.“, the others said and it became way less dark.
She hung different dresses in her wardrobe, a black one with a mermaid tail printed on it, beginning on the hips, but it was no normal booring mermaid tail, yt was designed like fishbones and looked very cool on her because of her long legs and perfect bod-. Next to this she hung her green slytherin dress. She also hung uo a short black dress with a corsage and with skulls and bones all over it, a black dress with an anatomicall heart on the chest and diverse other black,grey, red and dark bluu dresses with lace, prints and cutouts and stuff, Underneath all those dresses stood a black pair of high heels,some dark snikers (one violet pair with universe-pattern on it, agift from her little sister), diverse boots and a pair of sandals. She looked at the other part of her wardrobe, there were lying her jeans, shirts, tops and all.
He didnt even know she has a sisiter, at all he didnt knew much about the pther students, he was always very well focused on his own studying. [
* oh my demon what's your problem?" she rolled her eyes. „Don‘t go to be soppy now...“
They sat on the common room, where Ryan hissed at all the idiots who stared at the girls because they were hufflepuff.
It was… an interesting but not quite fulfilling lesson.
The leek jumped Tom in the neck and bit him, a fountain of blood poured out an splashed on the grund.
Dumbledoor( goddit) (← hah, gettit? Im so funnx if u seay somedng else stopflamingzz) stood n fornt of the audence and began talking stuff andthen Mrz Mcgonugul ccame with the magical hat and the kiddos weresorted in the houses. Whe finished, dumblidork talked about the newteacher willy vunko who began dis year with teaching and snape nowbeing teacher for dark-arts.
"My butt hurts," was Draco's first thought at the next morning, they hadforgotten to close the curtains and the light of the misty mourningfell through the windus. Vampireclinged on him and had his arms wrapped thightly around him. Heclosed his eyes again and took a deep breath in.
He silently followed her, feelin guilty and numb at the some tim.
He didn t lock @ rago and sat on the pposite direction of darve.
The students sat there in silence as he began to speak:
"I love you too," Draco blushed, but Vampire couldnt see.
Dawns lips were of a light pink-ish colour, which she detested, bt Izora thought it was cute. She had asked herself how it would feel to kiss these lips for a while now. Good for her, Dawn completely blended everythng ut while reading, so she didnt notice Izoras staring yet.
“Ah here he is, come follow me!”
„But hes so strange the last days maybe he does not love me anymore.“
Hermoine and Jinx gasped, the teachers all ran out to the infirmary.
„So you ran off.“
"Wo the fuck do you think you are, lil witch?" Drake spit. "Dont youever dare again talk to my bae like dis again!"
He put on a plain white shirt and dark grey jeans.
This moment took like forever.
„Yes it was, and being depressed is not „Gothic" or „cool" orsomething anybody wants to achieve.", Diablo/Ron said.
„Why did nobody tell me about a neq student?“
„I annoyed the nurse long enough to let me go.“, he said jockingly.
Oh yeah, now that you mention it...
And Ryan was just not interested in the great goblin war from 1624.
In the exact moment as he turned around the corner to hufflepuff-entrance to talk to hermina, he could see Drace kissing her.
„So we're even, huh?“, Ryan said jockingly as she helpd him 2 geddup.
It's nearly the end of pride month, so we‘d like to add at this point: Black Lives Matter and we stand with the LGBTQIA+ community <3
„You okay?" he asked and the girl nodded, shacking and nearly crying.
Hermoine and Ryan looked at each other blankly, a piece of bread fell down of Ryans fork.
A/N - E/N:
He went quiet.
He turned around and looked at her and she knew he was sirius.
She was so angry at him and wanted to know whot had happened-
"What a long long skull day," Ryan said, stretching after the transformation-lesson. Today they learned to transform magicily in to othr creastures like cats, wolfes and so on.
“WAITWAITWAIT” Tina ran around the corner, hastly arrenging her glasses. “We forgot something!”
„Me- what?“, he crossed his arms and looked t her dismissively.
The days passed.
Vampire in the man who had been yellin at Evony.
„We havent been talkin 2 each otha since u were back..."
“You alright?”
Draco didn't no whot to think at all.
Ryan woke up in the middle of the knight.
A strange noise had waken her up.
Ryan kicked it again bef4 the leek could hurt neville even more, the leek splattered into severul parts. <The parts withered bef4re their eyes and faded in2 black dust.
