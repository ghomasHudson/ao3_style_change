"To make sure they were strong enough to survive. We wouldn't want to reintroduce them to their parents and have them die shortly after."
"Apologies, but you must understand that only a while ago, he stood with Voldemort. This is quite a drastic change and we must make sure a crime hasn't been committed." For a moment, he seemed so genuine. It was as if he really wanted them both to be okay.
Harry was silent as he stared down at the page.
Draco read over the page and he smiled at the topic. Cuddling. The two main characters were cuddling. It was very sweet and cute, but Harry was acting as if he had seen something scandalous. At the very least, it was something he wasn’t used to. That’s when Draco began to wonder about how serious Harry’s previous relationships had gotten. It also made him question how much affection Harry had received in general. Everyone needs affection and physical touch. For a moment, he even wondered if Harry might be touch-starved.
The next morning, Hogwarts was filled with students once more. Amongst the chaos and reunions, a few packages arrived at breakfast.
"Well if I didn't know any better, I'd think it was a result of how pompous you are." Harry threw back. Never too flushed to insult Draco.
James thought his father’s fears were unfounded and not that serious. It’s like finding out a friend is scared of clowns and coercing them into watching a clip from a circus. His intentions were only to freak Harry out a bit, but it was all in good fun, so he thought it would be okay. He had no idea how serious it was.
Before that, there was a lot of sentiment. Goodbyes, promises to keep in contact, exchanges of contact information, hugs, and tears. People hugged and promises to keep in contact knowing that they would never write, knowing this was the last time they would intentionally speak or see each other, some knew they would never be broken apart from each other no matter how time or distance played it’s part, others were soon to be coworkers, and some were moving in together. There were some classmates that Harry hugged but never planned to contact again. His friends, he wasn’t worried about, he knew they’d never be broken apart, and he definitely wasn’t worried about never seeing Draco again.
“And then we can hex each other.” Harry concluded in a dreamy tone, as if he wanted nothing more than to hex Draco.
Draco looked away coyly and he sank down a little lower, pausing and wincing when Harry’s length had gone past what his fingers were able to prepare.
Draco smirked, “Oh, you’re rich too?” He sat beside Harry with an interested expression, “Tell me more about your money.”
Alex very quickly lost their allure and turned to sympathy. "Oh." They didn't quite know what to say. They knew Harry's story, everyone did, but it was hard to really imagine how a life like that can hurt a person. "Maybe touch is what you need. Even if it isn't with another person, you don't seem like the type to put on your best pants just to undress yourself."
"I'm hurt."
Even after the unpacked their problems, they kept talking. They talked about whatever.
“Dammit.”
He gave a soft smile. "Thank you for understanding. I really don't need a lot of time. Before February, I promise."
Hermione picked up a pair with silver lilies for charms. She eyed Harry's roses and offered the necklaces.
Draco blinked in surprise and turned to face Harry. "That's only two months away!" He seemed to think over the details before letting out a soft chuckle. "Sure. This spring, in Paris. I think that'll work."
A playful grin spread across Harry's face and demanded adventure. "Promise?" He wasn't giving this up.
There was no resistance. It was all too sweet. Too tempting.
Draco crossed his arms. “I think I’m going to sleep in the common room.”
“What else am I suppose to look at? I might as well enjoy how cute you are.” Harry winked, knowing Draco loved how he winked. He knew Draco loved everything about his eyes and he planned on never letting him live that down.
In it, the lawyer found poetry in his lover. His lover who moved with the power of the ocean, laughed with the folly of leaves in the breeze, stole the rays of the sun and wore them as a halo, and scorched his fingerprints into the flesh of everyone he met with the fire of his spirit. A lover the protagonist couldn't have. And suddenly, the ocean was stormy, the wind was a hurricane, the light was blinding, and the fire turned everything to ash. It was all too much and not enough, but whether he escaped the flame or burned forever, the protagonist knew he would never be satisfied.
It was hard and it hurt like hell, but after the summer had come and gone, things weren’t as bad as before. The people of that home showed their open wounds to each other.
Draco raised an eyebrow teasingly and looked Harry in his eyes as he took more in. He somehow managed to look as sly and arrogance as ever, even with a dick in his mouth. Something about the position they were in, the way Harry so easily cried out for Draco, the volume, the desperation, the trembling, something about it gave Draco a sense of power.
“This! What you always do. You go off and act like you have to be everyone’s savior, like you have to carry the weight of the world. I’m not a damsel in distress, Harry.”
Draco smirked and raised an eyebrow. "Are you going to blush every time I complement your cooking? Of course, that won't deter me, but you act as if you don't know you have a talent."
Harry rolled up the parchment and tied it with a string before sending it off to Shacklebolt.
He opened his mouth as if he was going to formulate a response, but nothing came out. He knew Draco was right. He knew that if he didn’t stop, I’d probably kill him. “I know that I should. I want to. The war is over. I need to rest.” He paused a moment, staring into the distance, zoning out a bit before returning and saying, “Just give me time. Then we can live our lives as coworkers at Hogwarts, hexing each other at Quidditch games, sending love letters, and growing old together.”
They laid down in Draco’s bed and Harry worked on a bit of homework that he had started while he was in the hospital wing, but never finished. He was already ahead in all his classes due to the amount of work he was able to get done in the days he was confined to a bed without anything better to do. He needed something to fill the time and homework was all he had.
He finished his sandwich in silence, watching Draco. Though it would be boring to most people, he thought it was pretty interesting. He started by looking over Draco's shoulder a while and reading it as Draco went along. The characters were wrapped up in a conversation that existed to establish the fact that they were both single and interested in men. The lawyer nursed a single glass of wine through the night while the photographer had a few glasses of whisky, but it's dulled effect showed a tolerance for alcohol. He followed along for a few paragraphs before Draco finally noticed him watching. He flushed pink and raised an eyebrow, "Having fun?"
Ron was paired with a boy from Hufflepuff and Harry saw Luna was paired with a Slytherin girl.
Hermione nodded and decided to make an attempt at changing the subject. She's noticed that Harry only ever wanted to talk about work or her life. He never spoke about himself. So she decided to check in on him. "And how have you been? Anything new, that isn't work related."
“Kissing.”
Harry took a few more deep breaths, and although it hurt some and was a bit uncomfortable, there was an undeniable excitement bubbling in him. He’d never felt so open yet so full before. He shifted his hips and let out a breathy moan at the thumb that circled his tip once more. The warm and still-lubed hand began to stroke him and pulled a gentle cry from his lips. He twisted and felt his body give in to the pleasure. “Bit deeper.” His voice was breathy and wanting.
Through their quips, they found that opposites attract quite well.
Pansy had always been a bit like him. Not very interested in blood, only caring about it because she was made to, and every aspect of her life was controlled by her parents. That’s why they were so close. They were the only ones that they could be honest to for all those years. Every time they questioned their parent’s beliefs, they went to each other and found that they weren’t the only one who didn’t understand or didn’t think it was right. It was the only real friendship Draco had. At first, their friendship had been predetermined, but on their own, they made it real. Draco considered Pansy to be one of the few good parts of his childhood.
them again, not after everything you've been through. All you can do is be who you are now."
Harry was writhing on the bed, he had no idea it would feel so good. He whined and shook, something he wasn’t used to doing, but he couldn’t stop himself now. His grip on the sheets tightened and his face ended up buried in his pillow, turned to the side so he could breathe. His hips pushed back onto Draco and sped up with the other’s tongue. Everything felt light and tingly, as if he could float away at any moment. He wasn’t sure when, but he’d somehow become incredibly sensitive to the other’s attentions.
Harry closed it and stayed on the front page, where the three Marauders; Moony, Padfoot, and Prongs, proudly presented the Marauder's Map. "Hey guys."
With that, their terror turned into an appreciation that bordered on obsession. They wanted to preserve the bubble that they existed in. So in their afternoon they became inseparable. Draco picked back up on his writing and Harry held him and watched from over his shoulder. His mouth was pressed to the blonde's shoulder and the body in his arms warmed him. Out of pure curiosity, he let a hand reach up to play with Draco's hair. It was soft and his fingers twirled around strands of hair. It was more like a scalp massage in that his fingertips slid through his hair and teased the strands.
Harry nodded in agreement, and just as he was about to speak, a letter flew in threw the mail slot. He went to pick up the letter and furrowed his eyebrows as he saw it was from Gringotts. "Gringotts." He commented to Hermione as he opened it and read it's contents. "Shit, it's about settling something with Draco." He hurried to grab his jacket.
Harry blushed and looked away. “When?”
Harry stared at Draco. Part of him wanted to just walk away and not deal with it, but that would solve nothing. He that there a moment and sighed. “I suppose killing can be traumatic. But I think numbness is ideal. I’d rather feel numb than feel bad about killing that monster.”
"Excellent. So excellent that it worked. Draco's my boyfriend now."
Draco considered both options and very quickly found that he had no preference. “I just want the bloody mark to be gone”
It seems Draco had forgotten about his cunning nature and skills in charming others to get what he wants. But now he had a plan. A sly and manipulative plan, but he was going to do whatever he had to do to make Harry want him as much more than a friend, and then, he would go in for the taking.
Harry furrowed his own and his cheeks went pink for the second time that morning. “What?”
Draco cracked a smile. “Oh, you’re shy?” He tilted his head. “How many times this week have you wanted to ask me to touch you, but didn’t because you were too shy?”
“Not at all, Parkinson. We only need to bring him in for questioning.” The Auror explained.
Pomfrey looked over and noticed Draco. “I trust you can handle Potter yourself.”
His father knew he was there but didn't speak a word to him. He came into the sitting room and saw him, looking sad and distressed. He only raised an eyebrow and left. Draco hated how satisfied Lucius probably was with the whole situation. He likely thought something terrible had happened to Draco and not the other way around. He wanted to lash out yet again, this time as his father, but he didn't. He hated himself when he was mad, he reminded himself too much of his father. He didn't want to be anything like that man.
“Draco.”
Harry went to put the letter in his room. It was one less thing for him to worry about and he was grateful.
Draco was only a few centimeters from being all the way in, when Harry winced once more. “I must admit, I’m impressed. You’re taking me so well, Harry. You’re doing so well.”
Harry whined and writhed at the statement, stroking Draco faster. “No, I wanna cum too! Please!” He was nearly sobbing out the words.
“A little bit.”
He took a deep and silent breath before speaking to no one in particular, “I like this place.”
Nobody asked why Harry and Draco missed the Halloween feast, everyone had an idea as to why, but as long as Harry was happy, nobody minded.
All in all, it was pretty obvious that their lives were going to be absolute hell if they didn’t set Draco and Harry up as soon as possible.
Draco ignored his words and shoved him into their dorm, closing and using a silent spell to lock the door.
"Yes, Harry, average for a woman. I've got ten on you." He bragged as he pulled the final item out of their bag of decorations: mistletoe.
He had hardly been aware of the shift, but everything felt so much better than before. Any discomfort was gone and he was overwhelmed by pleasure. He couldn’t stop himself from moving with Draco’s hips. He was greedy and needed more.
Draco smirked and sat up. “Alright then, what can I do to make you feel better?”
“Well don’t fall asleep now. It’s time for dinner.”
With no class, Harry and Draco stayed up even later than normal talking away. Harry helped Draco study important plants and potions, and Draco helped Harry work on his lesson plans.
“You were sweeping chimney’s together?”
They had spaghetti and while they ate, Draco finally said the words that had been resting in his mind for weeks now. "You have no civilities."
Draco smirked. “I’ve been told I’m quite talented with it.”
Harry tilted his head, “I think I would like that.”
He almost felt the need to mumble it to himself, just to have it be said. To say that he was hurt instead of sitting in it, as he had always done.
The next morning was spent in bed. They laid together and ended up drifting through various cuddling positions. Each of them hiding their morning wood and blissfully unaware of the other’s.
“You couldn’t have cleaned that up?”
Draco knew how much she loved them and decided to get them back for her. Of course it took a bit of asking a around, and a few threats, but he tracked them down in a matter of days. He had to get a bit creative with his threats as he could no longer use his father as a proxy. But he was a Malfoy, and that still meant something. Even with the fall of Voldemort, some family names still preserved their meaning as they didn’t rely entirely on a dark lord for their power. The Malfoys have a long history of power and manipulation, and though Draco is a very good person, some things don’t change. Especially when Draco is going after something he wants.
“Good.” He cracked a small smile. “You wouldn’t be you if you did.” He fell in love with Harry. Every part of Harry. Including the part that would put his life on the line to save others. Even if it was annoying and worrisome.
Harry’s throat constricting a bit as if his body didn’t want him to speak. He was so hurt and angry that it gave him a bit of a headache.
Draco raised an eyebrow and set his hand on the table, leaning over it to get in Harry’s face, though he wasn’t too close. “First of all, you aren’t allowed to do that above my jaw or below my thighs.” That alone shocked Harry and made his face go red. “Secondly, make a move like that again and you won’t be so virginal for much longer.”
Draco laughed once again and shook his head. “You’re like a nun, Harry. No wonder you’ve remained a virgin this long.”
“I have nightmares. Everyone dies, you die, Hermione, Sirius, McGonagall, my parents, fuck.” He covered his mouth a moment, closing his eyes as his throat closed up and burned from how much he wanted to cry. “Everyone dies. I kill someone. Something goes wrong. I’ve seen Hogwarts burn a thousand times, I’ve died a hundred times, I’ve seen and done things and sometimes I wake up and I can’t remember what really happened.”
He scanned the rest of the article. “What about Draco and Neville, they’re fifth and tenth?”
“I know. It’s hard. With Remus and Sirius, it felt like I had family. They were as good as blood. Not to say the Weasley’s weren’t, but they couldn’t tell me about my parents. I almost had them. Now I’m a godfather, I am to Teddy exactly what his father and Sirius were for me.”
“How could you possibly have known that?”
Draco looked over at him with a soft smile. “So, what’s this last thing you wanted to give me?”
Just as he finished getting it ready, Draco appeared in the Floo. He'd spent the day in Paris with Blaise. Although he was no longer the man his father had wanted him to be, had separated himself from the elite, and was satisfied with his life with Harry; he still loved to indulge himself in the same sins that once owned him. Foods with names that were impossible for most to pronounce, designer robes, social gatherings with a more tolerable high class, ogling fine men, and it gave him the chance to practice his French.
Running away from paparazzi with her son, laughing and hurrying along, she had never been so free.
“Because you’re working yourself to death on break.”
He would have woken up without distress if not for the final scene. Voldemort was right in his face, smiling. It wasn’t malicious but a genuine smile. Voldemort was honestly happy. He then commented, “Oh Potter, could it be that being a Horcrux had side effects? Could it be that you, the Boy Who Lived, might be just like me? Or maybe it has nothing to do with having part of my soul in you. Perhaps you’re a perfectly bad person on your own, perhaps you’re just like me. I do love the irony of it, Potter.”
Seamus immediately looked over at Dean and his cheeks went pink. He stared a moment and, lo and behold, the potion exploded.
He used the computers at the library to look over the properties the landlady owned. Some were in Muggle society, others were surprisingly close to Hogwarts. He looked at her properties in Scotland. He was interested in something fairly close to Hogwarts, but still a bit isolated as he wanted to have his own little piece of the world.
“I swear it.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, a bit surprised, “Oh, so you’re into blokes?” He thought Harry was only interested in girls. His comment about Harry bottoming was meant to only be a joke, but perhaps it was a bit more serious than he thought it was.
“How could you say such a thing! That’s so classless! I’m better than that, Harry.” Draco ended his statement with a huff before turning to pour more wine.
Genuine fear flashed in those green eyes, and he leaned back to avoid being hit; his pulse picking up as a temporary panic rushed through him. He tried to hide the fear with a small smile but Draco still saw it. For a moment he saw how familiar this situation was for Harry. He knew he had crossed a line.
“Is there a problem with Draco’s grades?”
“Looks like I’m spending Christmas at Hogwarts.” Draco sighed, “I don’t really know anyone who’s staying. With year seven being optional, and half of the school not showing up in the first place, it’s going to be barren.”
Alcohol made him strangely sleepy. When the initial buzz wore off, he was really tired. He crawled into bed and stripped himself before getting under the sheets. “Dracooo, come on. I’m the birthday boy so you have to do what I say. Come lay down with me.”
Harry let out a chuckle, at least they seemed friendly, “It’s Potter. Harry Potter.”
“Cedric was Hufflepuff Captain, Ginny is one of the best Chasers out there, Cho was a damn good Seeker, and I ogled the hell out of Viktor Krum.” He explained it all as if it was so simple and made perfect sense.
The blonde above him sat back and reached towards Harry’s zipper. “Is this okay?”
“As far as I knew, you were a young lesbian.”
“No, but they are. They look ridiculous.”
Hermione only grew more smug later on. Draco caught her and Ron between classes and asked them for a favor. He gave them twenty galleons and asked them to buy whatever Harry likes from Honeydukes, and to get as much of it as possible.
"I'm sorry if that was ..... maybe too much?"
Now he has to figure out how to make Harry feel better.
“I must admit, I’m quite impressed. What you did was so, strategic. You really should have been in Slytherin.”
He continued to please Draco, and let his other hand begin to roam. He cupped Draco’s cheek and stroked it with the pad of his thumb. His eyes went to the blonde’s pink and plump lips that were taking in and exhaling ragged breaths. He slid his thumb down to play with his lower lip. He drug Draco’s lower lip down and then let it fall back into place. Gorgeous.
Harry shrugged. “Because we weren’t doing anything. Usually we start flirting and kissing before I do anything, or you’ll just sort of pounce on me, but we were just sitting around and I was looking at you and thinking about you too much. I didn’t want to bother you.”
He knew he had no reason to be so scared and sad, but he was. He didn’t know what else to feel. Perhaps it was better to just let the emotions happen.
“Slytherin and Gryffindor.” McGonagall called out, two names floated before her, “Pansy Parkinson and Hermione Granger.”
Draco thought a moment, “Want my jumper?”
“And I forgive you. For all of it. I forgive it all. We were both children, both manipulated, helpless to what had been decided for us, and we were stupid. I know you probably don’t want or need my forgiveness, but here it is. Everything you did, it’s alright. I know my friends haven’t really said it, but they never really hated you either. And I know they forgive you too. Everything that happened before this year, it’s forgotten. It’s done.”
With each page he felt his chest hollow out like a wound, his heart dropped, his eyes burned, and his jaw ached with the desire to cry out. Everyone he lost, they were so innocent then. So carefree and childish. They were just children, they were his friends and family, and now they’ve been murdered. He never considered the fact that his parents and their friends started out as just a group of children. They were only children, then they grew up and decided to fight for what was right, and then they died for it. The journal was almost too much for him. He saw them as the children they once were. Pulling pranks, dating, wondering about the future, entirely unaware of the war that would kill them all. They were carefree, their only troubles being their classes. In those small hours, forever embalmed on paper, they were children. Playing Gobstones, Quidditch, Wizard's Chess, studying, joking, laughing, and smiling. They were just children.
Draco saw how nervous Harry was when he entered and tilted his head. “Are you that unhinged by the thought of relaxing?” If it genuinely made Harry uncomfortable, he would back off a bit.
“Dean. If you don’t fuck Seamus, I will.” That’s all Harry said. At that Dean grabbed Seamus and pulled him onto his lap. Dean wasn’t even sure what had come over him, all he knew was that Harry could not have Seamus. Seamus was a bit coy about it, but flattered nonetheless. They were both a bit embarrassed, but they were also overjoyed at knowing how the other felt.
Life in the hospital wing wasn’t that bad. Harry met some of Draco’s coworkers, got to see Draco out and about on the job, and he got to make three jokes about how Draco will have to assist him in the shower. Draco said he didn’t find the jokes to be amusing, but his blush said otherwise.
In the lobby, Crow managed to mumble to him that she could get two votes in, as she passed by, so it wouldn't look like they were communicating. She couldn't be seen as connected to Harry if she was to continue to influence the older members. Pansy didn't have that limitation and walked right up to him to tell him that she could definitely get in three votes from the younger four. Since he knew they were at least trying, he wrote a letter to Alex when he got home. He told him that Effie Crow and Pansy Parkinson were going to be revamping the failed St. Mungo's reform and that Daniel Greenwood was sponsoring it. He knew they would find it suspicious that the press knew about it before they announced it, but he didn't care too much about that. They deserved a reward for sticking to their word. It also prevented Crow, who Harry didn't trust as much, from backing out of the reform and leaving Pansy high and dry. He received a quick reply that the story would be out tomorrow, but likely a side article to the main one about Luther's trial.
So that’s what he did, he explored this new relationship. He explored and discovered for ten new chapters. It took ten chapters before he was absolutely worn out. He wrote until the very thought of writing became exhausting.
Harry chuckled as he entered their dorm. “That’s insane. I mean, I get it. I really do. I always thought he was kind of cute.”
“Cuddle up to someone? Like we did on the couch by the fireplace after I wrapped Teddy’s presents?” He reminded with a smirk.
That told Draco all he needed to know. “You just did." He said with a victorious grin. “If you didn’t like him, you would have denied the rumor. Which, by the way, doesn’t exist. I suspected you fancied him on my own, I see the way you look at him when you two talk.”
Harry decided not to comment when he realized a lot of the furniture was dark green. He honestly found it to be a bit adorable.
Harry’s friends were surprised to find him grinning and half-asleep.
Harry very quietly opened the door to his room, crept inside, and shut it without making a sound.
Harry only looked crushed. "N-No! No to both!" He couldn't believe they were seriously questioning him. He couldn't stand it when someone didn't believe him.
Draco groaned and shifted, not even opening his eyes. “I don’t care. I don’t want to get up.” He was too relaxed by the warmth of Harry’s body.
He hated mornings like this. Mornings where nothing could will him out of bed. He wished he had a reason to get up in the morning but there was nothing. Not when Draco wasn't there. Logically speaking, he had to eat and go to work, but it felt as if he didn't have a reason. He knew he had things to do that were important but for the life of him he couldn't get up and just to it. Even when his stomach began to growl and ache from hunger, he lay unmoved. Nothing could get him out of bed. Not even himself.
Harry rolled his eyes and settled in Draco’s arms. “Of course we’re dating. You lot have been waiting months for it and I’ve loved Draco since Christmas. Hell, it feels like we’ve been dating for months instead of two weeks. This was bound to happen.”
“I can’t help you taste delicious.” Harry threw out, entirely unsure of where this confidence came from. It somewhat alarmed him since he was usually never this confident about anything romantic or flirty, but here he was, calling Draco delicious.
I was almost done with this godforsaken Drarry smut, and then I set my phone down, drank some water, picked my phone back up, opened it, and my fucking browser refreshed.
Harry immediately tried to reach for Draco, but he couldn’t move his arms. The squeeze around him was marvelous, but he wanted Draco to enjoy it as much as he did. “I want to touch you.” His voice was soft, just as coy as Draco, and afraid of breaking the intoxicating atmosphere between them.
Rather than Narcissa crying, Draco was in tears now. “Thank you.” He mumbled.
The blonde looked a bit coy before finally getting it out. “Look, I know you said you wanted to wait, and I’m still okay with that, I’ll always be okay with that. But, uhm. If there ever was a night where you didn’t want to go to bed alone, just let me know.” He seemed to realize the potential sexual nature of his comment and gave a surprised expression before quickly adjusting his language. “Not to say that I’m offering anything of a sexual nature, I’m not. We don’t even have to cuddle or anything. Uhm. Well, not to say I’m
He bit his lip and watched Harry’s composure crumple under him. He then moved his hand to the band of Harry’s boxers. He raised an eyebrow, asking once more for permission.
“Too early. We don’t have to be anywhere till after lunch. Goodnight.”
Sixteen years of flirting and fucking, but Draco still had a way of using his body and words to turn Harry into a noisy mess in the bedroom. Thankfully, they remembered the silencing charm.
Cooking, nature, and chocolate. His only remedies.
Harry did this in every debate. He built his arguments, remained calm and reasonable, had a will to compromise, and pushed Wizengamot to get things done faster. Because of him, news came out of many laws being created and altered.
Draco felt like he was going to explode. He had Harry, his Harry, his sweet and innocent Harry, in his arms, humping his thigh, about to cum in his pants, moaning his name, all because of a spell Draco had cast. It was gorgeous.
Draco left to go read by the fire and Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map.
Harry turned to him and gave a weak smile. “Come here, James.” He opened his arms, but paused when he saw the book in his hands. “Oh. You read it, didn’t you?”
“Just my brothers, not Ginny?”
Soon, Harry was rolling his his hips back in time to Draco’s fingers. His hands were balled under his chest and kept him lifted a bit, his back remained arched and he found himself raising his hips higher as if his body wanted to bend over for Draco. He whined as he nearly found himself on his hands and knees, he was roughly halfway there but refused to get any closer to such a mortifying position. His hips moved quickly as he wanted more and more.
Harry didn’t respond, not wanting to admit Draco was right. Draco arched an eyebrow, taking the silence as a challenge. He couldn’t help he still had his competitive nature and it was still somewhat directed at Harry. He began digging his fingers in deeper and moving his hands lower. He was almost to the small of Harry’s back.
"Yes." He didn't let Draco get another word in. Harry leaned closer and felt the hands on his hips grow just a bit tighter. "You
“Oh come on, it’s better than wanking.”
Wizengamot was practically dead given that it was a Friday. Fridays are always tossups. They're either busy from early morning to evening with people rushing around, or they're practically dead without a soul in sight. The only reason Harry knew that Greenwood would be there was because he heard from a disgruntled lawyer that Greenwood had been putting off handing over a few files but that he was meant to do it today, meaning that Greenwood would be too rushed to put up an argument or to think twice about the task Harry would give him. Really, Harry had this planned for a while but wanted to wait until he knew Greenwood would be busy.
Monday evening he marched right into the hospital wing and went into Harry’s curtain. “Alright, I’m staying with you for the night.”
That explained quite a lot. “Have you used it recently to track me?”
As for Harry and Draco themselves, neither actually wanted Draco to leave. They had become good friends, even Charlie ended up befriending Draco. But their friendship hadn't come as easily as they would have hoped. Although Harry understood Draco's life, Draco knew nothing of Harry's. He only had an outsider's image of the golden boy in all his heroic glory, so he had no problem teasing Harry for his fame, like Snape used to. That only lasted three days before Harry snapped.
For as cold as it was, the birds still sang and the sun’s rays still felt warm. He smiled to himself and leaned his head back onto the tree he sat against, just breathing. For as in-control and confident he was in his work, it was nice to be able to slow down and relax.
“I was hoping to. I got you some candy from Honeydukes. Well, I gave Ron and Hermione the money to go get the candy for me.”
Draco gulped and his cheek went red. “Yes.” He said through gritted teeth.
He decided on gently shaking him. “Draco? Draco, you have to wake up. We’ll be late for class.”
Harry nodded and let her take him to the side of the lobby, by the wall.
Harry thought a moment, but for some reason his mind always went back to Draco. The most attractive person he knew, Draco. The person he always wants to be around, Draco. Someone he wouldn’t mind waking up to every day, Draco. Someone he trusts with all his secrets, Draco.
“I have. Our friendship, it-“ he cut himself off, sighing, “I’m not completely oblivious, I know something is there, I just don’t know what it is.”
Harry had become quite skilled at avoiding the mistletoe and found himself proud that he was “immune to pranks”. But James didn’t like that at all.
“It really was. I nearly laughed in your face the first time you call me that.”
That put him in a bit of shock. Mostly due to how confident Neville was in his answer.
“Draco, I fucked up. I – I should have given you a chance. I should have done more for you this year when I saw that you needed it, and I should have figured out what that spell did before I cast it,” he stepped slowly towards Draco, and let himself relax a little when he saw that the taller boy was not moving away, nor pointing his wand at Harry. In fact, he looked frozen in place. His grey eyes were searching in Harry’s green ones, for something, anything that could confirm that Harry had indeed no idea what the spell’s outcome might be when he had used it on him that day in the bathroom.
Draco Malfoy stood before him, his pale blonde hair – it was almost white, Harry could not help but notice – falling in front of his usually immaculate mercury-like orbs. His mouth was shaped in an afraid sneer, and his wand was raised. First, at Dumbledore when he had disarmed him, just a few moments ago, and now at Harry himself. The two boys stared at each other for painfully long seconds, their breathing tangled in an irregular mess, before Draco finally spoke.
You’re helpless, backed in a corner. I understand that. We both do,” he pointed to the older man to his right, “Voldemort broke you. But I – I can fix you.”
“How about when I asked for your friendship?” He spit out, his eyes back on Harry, but his wand still in place in front of the Headmaster. “How about when, so many times this year, I was silently crying out for help, and no one even gave me a second glance?”
“Following me around all year doesn’t mean you know me, Potter,” Draco sarcastically drawled, but Harry could still hear the fear in his voice.
Draco was almost shouting now, tears angrily falling down his cheeks. “
Draco’s traits changed from anger to confusion for half a second, but as soon as Harry blinked, his mask was back into place.
“Fix me?” Draco laughed humorlessly. He held eye contact with Harry then, and what he said next traveled all over his body like venom. “You broke me first.”
Draco’s shoulders slumped at the words, and he exhaled heavily in relief – as if something incredibly heavy had just been released from him. He then let his head fall on Harry’s chest, his hold on his saviour’s hand becoming even tighter. Harry’s arms immediately took hold of Draco’s fragile body, and he passed a hand through his almost white hair as he held him in his arms.
The night was cold. Wind blew painfully through Harry’s messy black locks, tears slowly gathering in his usually shiny emerald eyes – they were, in fact, not glistening at all on this night atop of the Astronomy Tower.
wanted to help. He could see how unwell Draco was. He was fairly certain that Dumbledore had noticed it, too. To be fair, anyone would be able to see how completely and utterly broken Malfoy –
What happened next was like a flash in front of Harry’s eyes. He saw Draco’s face regain its past anger, his traits mean and his breath heavy, before he heard a faint “Expelliarmus” and, suddenly, Harry was wandless. Draco had disarmed him.
“Get out of here, Potter,” his voice was trembling. Harry’s heart broke.
. Guilt washed over him like a cold shower.
“I do, though,” Harry took a step closer to Draco, and watched as the blonde boy’s eyes widened, and as he inevitably took a step back.
“Let me help you,” Harry said, taking a step further. This time, Draco did not move back. He stayed put, his gaze on Harry. Always on Harry.
Harry shook his head slowly, his eyes wide. It dawned upon him that Draco genuinely thought that he had no choice; he thought that the only road he could go down on was the one where he became a murderer. Harry also realized that, even with this horrific tattoo covering his arm, Draco did not believe in Voldemort. At least, not anymore. He was terrified of him and was acting on one sentiment and one sentiment only – family.
“Join us. We will protect you, and your parents. I promise. Just – don’t do this.
As the realization dawned upon him, his grip softened on Draco’s arm, but the gentle traces of his fingers made it clear that he did not intend on letting go. Instead, he lowered his hand to Draco’s, and intertwined their fingers, effectively trapping Draco’s wand in their embrace. He heard the other boy’s sharp intake of breath and could feel his own heart beating quickly. They had touched before, but not like this. Never like this.
“Don’t you understand?” Draco’s speech definitely betrayed the terror he felt then, and Harry could see tears slowly gathering in his eyes, making their silver shade shine in the moonlight, “I have to do this. I have to kill him,” his eyes traveled to Dumbledore once again, as if to make sure that the two men in the room knew who he was referring to, before settling back on Harry’s fragile figure, “or he’s going to kill me.”
The confusion and pain written on Harry’s face must have been apparent to Draco because he kept on speaking.
Draco’s mouth trembled slightly, a tear clearly sliding down his cheek. He nodded numbly, never once lowering the wand he was still pointing at Harry.
“Draco, this is not you.”
“I can’t change the past,” he continued, his tone apologetic, almost affectionate, “but I can do something about the future. You do not have to keep on living with him, Draco. You do not have to witness innocent people being tortured anymore. You do not have to become one of them. This mark on your arm, it is meaningless. Don’t let it define you,” Harry paused, taking in a shaky breath, before saying what he said next.
, he had stopped being Malfoy at some point this very year, Harry had realized that – was in that moment. He had been for months, really. Harry had noticed this as well. He had seen how lonely Draco had looked every time he stepped foot in the Great Hall, or in class, when he bothered to show up.
“You want to fix me, Potter? Now, when a war is approaching? Now, when I am about to end the life of someone you hold dear?” He glanced at Dumbledore, and shakily raised his wand back to him.
Harry did not want to “get out of here”. He wanted to be the Saviour, for once in his goddamn life. Draco’s saviour. If only the other boy would let him.
“No,” Harry breathed out, forcefully, shakily. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“I didn’t mean that. Deep down, you know that I know you. You know me, too.”
He could have stopped him any other way, but he found himself acquiring this desire and determination to get through to Draco and to verbally convince him not to become an assassin. And so, at this very moment, Harry realized that what he was currently doing was about saving Dumbledore as much as it was about saving Draco. It was about saving two people he cared about. Two people he loved.
Harry took a deep breath and gently lowered Draco’s arm, his eyes still piercing through his.
However, in that moment, Harry found himself wondering why he was taking this to heart. Yes, he was doing it to save Dumbledore – after all, he was the first guide that Harry had been given in this evil world – but he knew that there was more to it than that. He could have simply disarmed Draco earlier this evening, stunned him, petrified him,
Harry failed to hide his shock as he stared at his opponent with his mouth hanging open, and risked a look at his wand, which was now being held by Draco’s long and slim fingers.
He wanted to help. He
Harry was now close enough to touch him. He raised his arm tentatively, and, when he saw that Draco was merely watching his movements with shock and curiosity, with absolutely no intention to stop him, he gently placed his hand on the other boy’s wrist. Draco gasped softly, and Harry noticed as his hand came in contact with the smooth fabric of the black suit he was wearing that Draco was shaking. Quite fervently.
“You, and your parents,” Harry murmured softly, “is that correct?”
Harry’s breathing was now shallow, panicked. He remembered that sentence all too well. It was what he had told Draco all these years ago on the Hogwarts Express. Before they had even made it to the castle. Before his life even truly started. Before he even had the chance to
Harry took a deep breath and held eye contact with Draco. He had to do something about this. He had to stop this. He simply had to.
“How?”
“I’m sorry,” he choked out, his voice weak, but somehow taking up all the space in the almost empty Astronomy Tower.
Draco looked up at Harry and bit his lip. “Ooh, kinky.”
but n-“
The man before him turned a dark red and seemed momentarily speechless. He sputtered through a few meaningless syllables before finally saying, “You want to have sex with me, right now?” No one had ever been so forward with him before. He almost didn’t know what to do.
“Alright, the book was in the restricted section.”
They stayed there a few hours, griping about work and Wizard society. Harry wrote out the first two pages before needing a break. They spoke about Ron and his time training with the Aurors. The training program is two years, but with Ron’s experience, he was nearly halfway done. Two pages later and they were on about all the good their new Ministry department was going to do. It really was about time Wizarding society caught up in prosecuting abusers and taking better care of orphans. He got started on the second half while they bitched about Harry’s situation in being married off to Draco. They spoke about how things were civil, they had no problems, and they didn’t hate each other. He even brought up how he carried Draco to bed, and that he and Draco were on a first-name basis.
That got some soft giggles and muffled laughs from around their group. Something about sex turned them into dumb twelve year olds.
Harry blushes darkly and squirmed. “Don’t look at it! Draco, that’s embarrassing. Come on.”
Then again, Bill and Percy were much older than Ron, and felt they were ready for parenthood.
Draco, on the other hand, had spent the last two hours with his mum.
"I look phenomenal in green, Potter. I thought Hogwarts would have taught you that."
“Yes. When I was a child, I was mostly ignored. I wasn’t exposed to a lot of conversation so I was late developing. Because of that, I couldn’t talk until I was four. Meanwhile, there are four year olds who can do math and are bilingual. All babies have such a potential for genius, it’s the job of the adults to teach them how to use it.”
Harry suggested a radio station aloud and the radio turned to it. Draco gave the name of a specific Muggle song and the radio started to play it. Harry tried doing the same thing but with a song by a wizard band, and it yielded the same result. They looked at each other, somewhat amazed.
He threw his head back and bucked his hips quickly, thrusting into his own fist as fast as he could. He was helpless to pleasure. He needed it, he craved it, he had to have it. His body shook and his free hand clawed at the floor for purchase. Moans and whines tumbled out of his mouth as he panted from the growing heat.
“You’re pretty cool for a baby.” Harry joked, Teddy didn’t understand because he’s a baby, but he giggled anyways.
Harry found himself agreeing. “I know. I just want to get the conversation over with and have everything go back to the way it was. I don’t like these empty spaces in-between.”
“It’s fine, let’s just move on.”
Around the same time, Luna and Rolf were traveling the world with their first son as Magizoologists, Ron was a prominent Auror, Hermione was on the way to becoming the youngest Minister for Magic in history, Neville was apprenticing to eventually run the Herbology department at Hogwarts, and the kids idolized Pansy as a wizard cop who puts away bad people.
“Why not fill it with what brings you joy?”
Draco took it and drank most of it. He then used his magic to check on Harry’s ribs again. “That three week period is looking more like a week and a half now. Technically I did that lot longer than I was suppose to. I only should have done it about thirty seconds.”
Harry didn’t know what overcame him, but he felt his cheeks burn from the complement. “Oh? Uhm, thank you.” He looked as if he had no idea how to respond to a compliment.
Harry quickly nodded. “Yes ma’am, thank you.” When he left, there was a noticeable spring in his step.
Draco nodded and he moved to sit right next to Harry while still keeping a comfortable distance, just in case. “I know we both said we want to keep our pants on, and that’s still true for me. Instead of deciding whether or not we want to do something,” he trailed off a moment, trying to find the right word, but he didn’t. So he started his sentence over. “Rather than deciding how far we go, we could start off small, make sure we’re comfortable with everything, slowly do more, and just do whatever feels right. So, maybe we could go back to kissing, and if you feel okay with my lips moving down to your neck ..... they might. Does that sound okay?”
“Well you’re impeccable at it.” He said before taking a deep breath. “Alright, you’ve driven me out of bed. Move your head so I can get up.”
Dean immediately agreed, “They’re gorgeous. I still haven’t decided if they’re more blue than green or vice verse. I think it’s mostly blue with a little green hue. He also has those lovely specs of brown near his pupil, it’s beautiful.”
“Of course I do! I can see what’s right in front of me, Potter. Now go on before you miss your train back.”
The blonde unwrapped the palm-sized gift to find a box containing silver cufflinks with little snake heads on them. He let out a laugh. “Because I’m Slytherin?”
“My mother’s journal.”
think it was you. Either that or they just want to bully you a bit. Still, they want to see you cleared.” He explained before they stepped into a Floo and Harry was taken to the Auror’s office.
Harry turned the water on and climbed in. For the first time in a year, he didn’t immediately start scrubbing. He turned around and let the warm water wash over him. He spent a few minutes relishing in the warmth before he actually began to clean himself up. It felt so nice to be able to take his time. He washed himself and let his hands roam, no harsh scrubbing to hurry and get the job done. After only two minutes he became painfully aware that if he didn’t stop he was going to turn himself on, but he didn’t care. He treated himself to delicate hands and sweet touches. He hadn’t had such privacy in years.
Draco tasted it and found it to be phenomenal. “Harry, this is amazing!”
“That’s a bet you’d lose.” Draco challenged.
Luna frowned, also tired of their pining. Four years of it really wore everyone down. “We’ve told them before that their feelings are mutual, but they’re doubtful and insecure.”
“Seriously?”
On his way to his first class, he still hadn’t figured it out. But he felt a rush of hope when he saw Ron and Hermione. “Granger! Weasley!” He called out, still unsure if he could call them by their first names.
"Right, and how did you find their parents?"
Harry looked away, staring at the floor. He was silent for a moment and then confessed. “At first, I wanted them to love me. I wanted so badly to have a family. But I guess one day I gave up. I was given old ratty clothes to wear, all too big. I was made to cook and clean every day, if I burnt something on accident then that was my meal for the day, and sometimes I was able to sneak scraps. But eating wasn’t always worth what would happen to me if I didn’t cook right. I would go days without food. I was a punching bag to my cousin. My uncle never hit me, but his words hurt me more than any hand could. My aunt, I never knew what she was going to do. She was creative.” Harry tilted his head, his expression became unreadable.
- - - - -
The Head Warlock was in shock. “Let’s take a ten-minute recess. We will return with our verdict.”
McGonagall was shocked, not because he referred to her as Minnie, but because that’s exactly what James did all those years ago.
Charlie told him all about dragons, George showed him a few prototypes for new products at his shop, Hermione spoke briefly with him about politics, Ron made his usual jokes about he and Harry being married before him, and Percy seemed a bit hesitant to talk to him. Percy never made it past the expected pleasantries and Draco didn't push him. He didn't expect to be completely accepted by everyone and was okay with the fact. If anything, the acceptance he was shown came as a surprise.
Harry and Draco both take steps towards their future careers, they also push Dean and Seamus together.
Normally the explosion would elicit a laugh from Harry. But this time, it was different. He flinched and thought of Fred.
“It’s a day where everyone gets presents!”
“I prefer gentleman of the night, and the sun’s down. My time to shine, Potter. One more quip out of you and you’ll find yourself quite helpless.” He pulled out his wand and cast a temporary silencing charm on the room. It would last for the night.
They nodded and took a deep breath, trying to push their concern aside. "Alright, what have you got for me?"
Draco’s jaw dropped from such treatment. No lover had ever dared to treat him as anything less than a prince due to his old reputation. But now, someone was rough with him, someone put up a fight, and he loved every bit of it. “Fuck.” Was all he could say in return. Everything felt so much hotter and a hand reached down to undo his own pants. His legs frantically moved to kick them down and into the floor before he returned to his desperate rutting.
They both turned to shoot him a look. Narcissa upset and Draco furious.
Harry didn’t know who the three were. He had no idea that the three of them were on the verge of tears with Nymphadora and Lily, describing to the two what Harry was telling them.
Harry goes looking for a house and casually brings Draco along. They also have a discussion about sex and Draco’s thighs.
Luna is gentle and intelligent, but being touched without any warning makes her instinctively pull out her wand. She doesn’t want to go back into the dungeon.
Harry couldn’t help but to notice how focused Draco was. His eyelids were low, his eyebrows were furrowed, his lower lip was trapped between his teeth, his hands were quick and his fingers elegantly fluttered around with the wrappings. Harry was entranced by how beautiful Draco was. Something about his face when he was concentrated was lovely.
She wrote Draco after receiving a letter from Harry Potter, asking her if she was interested in a position. Neither of them could believe he wanted her there, but lo and behold, he greeted her with a nervous smile the first day Wizengamot was called.
“And this is? Harry, you look like all you do is laze about, drink, and fool around.”
Draco gave a lazy smirk and watched a moment, suddenly very awake. Harry’s back was arched and his hips were slow and steady. The sights and sounds made Draco shift around, suddenly uncomfortable in his pants. He watched Harry furrowing his eyebrows, lips parted, with his hands gripping his pillow.
“I could tell you weren’t very invested in the interview you just gave.”
“I’d put money on you having a kink for my poshness.”
Draco smirked down at him. “I’m honored to have helped you discover your kink. But if you’ll excuse me, I need my hands free, so.” He pulled out his wand and cast a spell Harry didn’t recognize.
When the names for Secret Santa were drawn and the clock hit twelve, they stayed a while longer before everyone headed home. It had been a long and fun day that made Draco feel a bit at-home around the Weasleys.
“It’s fine.” Harry said as he slowly turned back to look Draco in the eye. “It’s alright. Let’s just focus on what comes first. We need to get a tree and decorations.” He opened his mouth to say something else, but came to a small realization. "Oh, I suppose that would be a bit tricky, yea? The paparazzi would likely see us, they'll take pictures and have questions."
"I suppose we are."
“Okay, fine, I do. Just keep that thing to yourself. I don’t want to go to dinner with a boner.”
Harry found himself at a loss. He was throbbing and he could feel precum leaking out of himself. “Need any help?” He offered, wanting to speed things along. He was only seconds away from moving to touch himself.
“Fine with me. Only makes it easier for me to bugger your arse la-“
The blonde was nearly a complete mess and it had only been a few minutes. He didn’t think Harry would know to touch him, but he was thankful that he did. He finally felt that magical spot inside of him being rubbed and he bounced vigorously, a small smile spreading on his face. It was overwhelming to have pleasure spread throughout his lower half. He felt as if he was already getting close to the edge. “Harry, oh! Touch me more! Faster!” He was chasing the feeling of an orgasm. It had been a while since he had another man inside of him and he didn’t realize how much he missed it until then. His breaths were more erratic as Harry obeyed and stroked him even faster. He hadn’t been this satisfied in years.
The blonde was on the floor with three dragons staring him down. He was momentarily afraid. The dragons crowded around him, sniffing at him as he turned his head to the side and tilted it back. He was uncomfortable, but didn’t complain.
“You couldn’t have realistically expected that to work.”
“Of course he does. Stop doubting yourself, you’ll both be happier if one of you just makes a move.”
He played with Draco’s lips a moment before leaning down to kiss the boy. It was a soft and sweet kiss, but it took away Draco’s ability to hide his sounds with panting. He was forced to let out a whine against Harry’s lips.
Harry looked up with a mischief in his eyes that the world hadn't seen since his father gleamed with it, a mischief that only a Potter could pull off. "Certainly that imagination of yours could give you a few ideas." His confidence was entirely misplaced. He wore it as if he had years of experience but he was only high on lechery. He moved to straddle Draco's lap with a small grin. "It's my turn." Though he was a virgin, he wasn't clueless. He's walked in on Lavender and Ron doing things more times than he'd like to admit. Not to mention, between a room of five boys, a lot of talk went around, and Dean happened to have a streak of being more detailed than anyone would have liked.
Draco saw a tear fall from Harry's face and it brought a smile to his. He didn't like the idea of hurting Harry, but it felt good.
A shiver went through Harry and he looked up again. “I-I don’t think I can do this.” His voice was heavy with something and it made the blonde grin.
The blonde’s jaw dropped and he squinted his eyes. “You’re going to regret this.” He took Harry’s door and ate it.
Draco turned to look at him, sitting sideways on the lap. "Now?"
Draco looked absolutely dumbfounded at the explanation. His lips parted in shock and he looked at Harry with such a loving expression. “Have you any idea how much that means to me?”
“To trade. We melt Galleons, trade it for cheap silver in the Muggle economy, melt the silver, have it minted into Sickles, and trade the Sickles for Galleons.” Perhaps he was going into detail with it.
Draco entered and raised an eyebrow. “Meet Teddy?”
She and Draco said their goodbyes before she took the Floo home.
Harry let out a soft whine but didn't protest.
Are Harry and Draco friends now? Friends and roommates.
Harry was also learning more and more about the Wizarding world. Little things he hadn’t quite picked up on but might need to know. Like where the hell house elves come from. As far as he knew, they just sort of appeared in people’s houses and worked there for some reason. It was strange to him.
“For being there for me. Last night was a lot better than usual.”
His eyes opened and he squirmed a bit to fight off the excitement that lurched from his lower stomach. He wasn't going to let that take him over, not now.
It was McGonagall.
Draco wanted to be what Harry needed. He wanted to be there if Harry wanted to talk, hold him if he wanted to cry, make him laugh if he wanted to be cheered up, and he would talk all night if Harry wanted a distraction. But he didn’t know how to say it.
“Fine.”
She stepped back and opened the door more for him to enter.
“It isn’t pornography.” Draco defended with a small laugh. “It’s called erotica.”
“Yet I’m the one with a real job.” Draco teased.
“Fucking finally!” Ron nearly shouted.
Even in their late twenties, as two grown adults, finally married to each other; their childish rivalries would never really be set aside. But now it was genuinely in good fun. Though that doesn’t change the fact that they were both wrong. Pansy proposed in November and their wedding is set for June.
Harry chuckled to himself, “You’re good at this. Pomfrey might like you so much that she’ll hire you.”
"Getting to that novel, I see." Harry joked before being immediately shushed.
They pulled away again and Harry was about to speak, but Draco's eyes flickered to his forehead. He brushed back the wild hair that covered it and cracked a smile. "Did you know your scar's been healing?"
“I have a good feeling about all this. By the end of the break I’ll have a boyfriend, I know it.”
Harry’s blush spread and he looked away, silently putting sprinkles on his gingerbread house. He was so embarrassed yet so flattered. It was hard for him to even begin to explain the way he felt because he’s never felt this way before. It was so new and exciting. Draco wanted him. Draco physically wanted him, and cared about him, and was interested in him on an emotional level. His lips parted as words hung but never would form. He searched for them as his hands stilled, too focused inside of his mind to bother with the physical world.
"What about Paris? I know you love it there."
The letters flew out, waiting for the two when they would get home. He also sent off the evidence about the financial fraud to the Aurors that Greenwood had suggested. Even if it wasn't necessary, even if some of them voted for Pawk's bill, he didn't want the crimes of the Voldemort-era to go unpunished.
Draco's smile turned into a grin as he nodded. "Exactly."
Harry thought a moment about Draco being a father. He thought it was sweet that Draco wanted kids. “Do you want a child of your own or do you just want an heir?”
“Kinky.”
“Oh, remember that spellbook of sex magic I mentioned I had looked through? Blaise bought me my own copy for my birthday.” He said with a wide grin.
Harry rolled his eyes and put his towel away. He laid down on his own bed and Draco turned to look at him with a huff.
Harry’s jaw dropped. He stared at Draco for a moment, frozen. The air was knocked from his lungs and no words came from his parted lips. He eventually broke through his bout of speechlessness. “I can’t believe you just said that.” His voice was softer, hollow. He couldn’t even begin to formulate a response beyond that. He didn’t know what to say, let alone how to process his own emotions. It was like being hit with cold water. There was only shock, and just a hint of betrayal.
“Harry, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Only do this if it's what you want.” Draco didn’t want to discourage Harry, but he also didn’t want Harry feeling like he had to.
Seamus and Dean high fived, Harry silently thanked the jar because maybe, Seamus and Dean will finally get together.
Dean and Seamus revealed they wanted to work in the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Harry personally believed they should also consider marriage, adopting two kids and three dogs. But whatever.
He felt his heart break a little. Even if Lucius didn’t make the best decisions, that was still his father. He knew his father wasn’t above murder, but he didn’t think it was possible that he could kill his own wife. He wasn’t sure what to believe, but he wanted his mother to be safe.
“You heard me last night? All of it?”
In their room, Draco’s bed was closest to the bathroom. He had just sat down on it when he heard Harry’s chilling words. His blood ran cold and he froze, wondering what could possibly be going on in the bathroom.
Ron’s jaw dropped and then his expression slowly changed to a mix of concern and horror, “I haven’t seen you smile since Christmas.” He spoke softly, but it was loud enough that everyone heard it.
Draco beamed, “Thank you so much!” He hadn’t expected it to go so well. He expected to be sent away with some explanation as to why he can’t learn the trade.
His mother always intended to fall in love, but they were caught in the middle option.
In the middle of it all was a baby with teal blue hair and big brown eyes. His face was a spitting image of Remus. He was laying on his stomach, looking around at his toys, occasionally picking one up and shaking or chewing it.
“How?” Harry giggled as if he were twelve and anything involving a dick was hilarious.
He usually didn’t fantasize when he got off, he just did it as quickly and quietly as possible. He never took the time to enjoy it. But now that his crush has entered his mind, his brain focused on it.
“Oh fuck.” The small noise slipped out as his back lifted into a little arch from the building pleasure between his legs. It wasn’t as relaxing as it once was, it was heavy. It was the foundation on which he would build his peak. His body stretched and twisted, lifting his shirt and exposing himself even more under the duvet. He bucked his hips at the feeling it gave him and decided not to think too much on how much he enjoyed it, rather, he let the shivers and gasps run through him. His hand was slightly damp from all that leaked out of him, coaxed by sordid joy.
“Firstly, I have never been interested in women. Secondly, you thought I was cute?” This definitely wasn’t how Draco expected the conversation would go. He never would have thought Harry would go and say something like that.
Harry grinned. “It is.”
Harry hesitated a moment, still a bit shy. But after his orgasm he was in the mood to be close to someone. He relented and laid down. He rested his head on Draco’s chest and laid his body between the blonde’s legs. He closed his eyes and he let Draco wrap his warm arms around him.
Harry’s eyes slowly widened as he realized what that meant. “So all the stuff that Voldemort got from his Death Eaters ..... I now own? Because I killed him?”
There was a pause.
Harry grinned to himself and looked away. “I think I might be falling in love with you.”
Draco’s night in Harry’s bed was anything but peaceful.
“I’ve been stressed ever since I was given away to the Dursley’s. Being stressed and vigilant is what kept me alive my entire life. I already finished reading the restricted section of the library so I don’t have that. I suppose I could delve into my future lesson plans for when I teach, but I'm almost finished. If I dive into it then I might finish it all in a day or two. I suppose I could try getting ahead in my classes, but if I get too far ahead of the lectures then I could run out of classwork.” Harry pondered his dilemma aloud.
Draco could feel Harry harden under him. “Tell me about how I’m right and I’ll consider stopping before you’re throbbing in your pants.” He wanted to hear how desperate Harry was for mercy. All his life he never really got the upper-hand over Harry. Now he had it in the most delicious way possible. He couldn’t help but to relish in what he has.
“I’ll get a bed ready.” He walked over to a bed in the back corner. He couldn't believe that Harry was actually dumb enough to go and do something like that. But given his  track record, he really wasn't too surprised. He fixed the sheets and pulled back the blankets so Harry could be laid down.
Harry rolled his eyes from where he sat, hunched over his plate, shoving noodles into his mouth. "I can't say I've ever care for them." Although he was sloppy, he wasn't a slob and he certainly wasn't messy. He kept his face and the table clean.
Draco got him a few new toys and some cups made for toddlers. Teddy was quite excited to have new cups. He immediately asked for some juice for his new cup.
He wrote his book, invited friends over, went to a few of their houses via Floo, but rarely ever left home. So long as his attacker was still out there, the world was no longer safe. He didn’t mean for it to so drastically effect him and he felt as if he were overreacting. He shouldn’t feel unsafe. Not with Harry by his side and not when he’s already been targeted. Astoria seems to have moved on with her life, but Draco hadn’t.
“Well I was at first, then I started taking Draco’s.” He said it so casually, as if it was perfectly normal to borrow his friend's jumpers all the time.
The girl let out a laugh. It had been accepted by the school that even though Draco and Harry are friends, they’ll always insult the hell out of each other. If anything it was a bit funny.
Draco, meanwhile, was amused by the shift in Harry's mannerisms. He was suddenly very shy, quiet, but happy. He bit his lip as his own smile spread across his face. He was overjoyed to have Harry in his arms and to be able to see how much the other enjoyed it. Harry's smile, adverted eyes, soft grip, and slightly off-beat footwork was all because of him. Harry was happy because of him. His happiness came from Draco. The feeling was overwhelming. Excitement and nerves bubbled up in his chest as he brought Harry along in their dance, finally taking the lead. In his newfound bout of confidence, he decided to tease a bit. "What ever happened to that Gryffindor bravery?"
“And I’m inspired.” Harry finished it for him. “I’m inspired by your beauty. You’re so beautiful Draco, you are now and you always will be, I suspect you’ll only grow more charming with age. I only wish to see you when your smile gives you laughter lines and when your eyes are wise with age. You’ll still be so beautiful, Draco. So beautiful and warm.”
They spoke a while longer before Harry finally went to pay and walked back home. He had a small smile on his face from seeing his friends. He decided he would sent them a letter later to see how they were doing.
Luna said she wanted to be a Magizoologist. She also wanted to travel the world and see what magical creatures hadn’t been discovered yet.
Cassiopeia only shrugged. “Maybe. What we’re really trying to focus on is getting our own names out there. We need something that isn’t too risky, but will give us some acclaim.” She spoke as if she was thinking heavily on the subject, making her younger brother nod and add, “Something that wouldn’t be difficult to get through, either.”
“Goodness, why so many clothes?” Andromeda asked.
The train ride back was excited and bubbly. Everyone talking about when their jobs and internships began, plans for the future, and of course, promises of when they would hang out again.
Draco was shocked but quickly stood up straight and wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders. It was typically himself that initiated things like this. Having Harry take the lead was a very pleasant surprise.
"Then what?" The blonde nearly snorted. "Someone from a desert?"
Harry bit his lip and let out shaky moan from the shivers that rushed down his spine to meet the dense and growing pleasure that rested between his legs. “Oh, lover.” His voice dropped into something low and rough. The hand in Draco’s hair gave him a tug and forced him to raise up a bit as Harry turned to nearly growl his words right into the blonde’s ear. “Once the epitome of grace and snide. I love the way you fall apart.”
He furrowed his eyebrows, slowly able to identify most of them. He and Harry’s lives had always been intertwined, and thus, he was present for many of them. “I’m so sorry to have marked you in such a terrible way. You shouldn’t have to wear them and be made to remember.”
But their moment didn’t last long as Draco began taking his lover in.
“No, this is bloody perfect.” He ground his hips in a circle and shook as his back arched, a wave of pleasure buzzed through his body. “Get comfy. I’m going to be here for a while.” He smirked as soft breaths began leaving him. They were slow and steady, the predecessor to panting. A soft smile graced his face. It had only begun, yet everything was so sweet.
“Ooh, say that again. But this time, spit on me.” At this point, Harry wasn’t completely sure if his speak of a degrading kink was just a joke, or if there was a little truth to it.
He smiled when he saw his mother, rushing over and hugging her. She hugged him back, she seemed happy even though she didn’t smile. It was in her eyes. He knew to look for her feelings there as she’d always been a bit hardened.
Harry nervously sent the approved article back and they knew that within the next few hours, the paper would be mass produced and sent out.
Harry was hardly paying attention to their interaction until Pansy threw out her comments. “What?” His voice was strangely hollow, as if someone had punched him in the gut.
Harry blinked at the question, still on the verge of hyperventilating. “Uh, b-blue?” He somehow wasn’t sure if that was the right answer.
“Harry, when one experiences honey, multiple senses are involved. Sight, smell, touch, sound, and taste. It floods your senses and overwhelms you. I’ve had it all with you. But unfortunately, I haven’t tasted you yet.” He described it in the same posh way someone would describe an experience with a fine wine.
Harry groaned and put his forehead against the table, too embarrassed to look at anyone.
Being a godfather, hearing something like that meant the world to Harry. He was glad to know he was doing a good job and that it was getting noticed. He didn’t need approval. But it helped with his confidence in what he was doing. He knew nothing about raising a child. Not even from his own experience of being one. He never had a real childhood and he was never really raised. He was guessing and hoping for the best with Teddy, and it wasn’t easy. But it comforted him greatly to know that even to an outsider, he wasn’t doing bad.
Just like his father, Teddy loved chocolate. So the cake was just that. A chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. He was very exciting.
Draco took on a confused expression. “Wait, what about you? What are you used to?”
Harry nodded. “Right then. A Christmas tree, gingerbread house, biscuits, mistletoe, lights, and music. Perhaps we should start there.”
“Well, what are your plans for the holidays, then? Christmas is next month and I can’t imagine you intend to return to the Manor.”
Dean looked confused, but nodded.
“Virgin.” Draco scoffed. “Always got an excuse, Potter. I really should make it worse for you because I know you won’t do anything about your problem.”
Draco couldn't stop a smile from creeping onto his face. "Ah, then his concerns are valid. I am quite the charmer, and I've already marked you as my own. Just give it a few more weeks and you'll never leave my bed again."
Hermione, Ron, and Pansy were already there and playing with Teddy when they arrived. Teddy wasn’t shy in the slightest and he loved meeting new people. Neville arrives a few minutes later, followed by Narcissa, Blaise, then Dean and Seamus.
“Draco.” Harry whined. He could feel the way his cheeks parted due to the position. He almost felt like he was flashing Draco, it was obscene and embarrassing.
There was a mixed reaction. Everyone looked as shocked as Arthur; besides George, Ron, and Harry; who had no clue what “right of conquest” meant. Although Harry was developing a sense of dread about it, as most eyes in the room went to him, giving looks of sympathy and sorrow.
“I’m tired, I don’t want to move.”
Draco’s eyes widened and he froze a moment before he busted out laughing. “Potter, you whore!”
"And your parents don't have to know. Not now, at least. Who you talk to at a little Ministry party is hardly their concern."
He wordlessly pulled out the flower from behind his back and handed it to Draco.
“I’ve been told dishevelment is part of my charm.”
“But I didn’t.” He pointed out.
"Want me to stop?" His hand stilled in Draco's hair.
Blaise gave him a very subtle high-five as they walked into the restaurant.
As he was laying down to go to sleep, Harry realized that he would finally consider he and Draco to be friends. It had been rough, but maybe that’s what they needed to turn around and get along.
Harry let a playful smirk take over his face. “So. How will you survive a night without me?”
side." Just to comfort him and know that there were no hard feelings for the perceived insult.
Harry cracked a smile, “I think I liked you better when you thought I was just a commoner.”
He took his time to explore Harry's skin. He ran his fingers over each muscle, curve, and scar that Harry had to offer. His fingertips left a trail of sparks and flickers that threatened to set Harry on fire. But with each sinful touch, Harry's body craved the flame more and more. By the time Draco’s hands reached his hips, Harry was flushed and burning with desire.
“Lovely accent too. I was never around many Irishmen growing up, so I never realized how attractive it sounds.”
He stared at his father in shock. “To whom?” He felt his fear melt away, replaced by the fiery passion of rage. “This can’t be legal!”
Draco scoffed and looked bewildered at the idea. “Why would he take me? We may be married, but it’s only a social arrangement.”
Harry went back home with a lot on his mind. He took the Floo and found Draco sitting on the couch, reading a novel that Harry hadn’t seen before.
Draco smirked. “No. When I get you back, you’ll be begging for me to touch you.” His smirk became a grin as he glanced over to his book. “I just might pull something out of there to do it.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, “You lot seem to know quite a bit about my parents and their friends. How did you all know each other?” He figured now would be as good a time as any to pop the question.
Harry gave a nod and followed him to the lobby where there were a couple Floos. “If none of you think that I was the one responsible then why do you have to clear me as a suspect?” Not that he knew everything about the law, but it didn’t sound as if he was really a suspect.
“I teach DADA.” He repeated as if he was reminding himself. He still wasn’t sure what he was meant to do with the information, but it gave him something to focus on.
, flirt with
His satisfied expression fell when he remembered tomorrow was the day of the big Yule Ball at the Ministry. He knew for a fact that Draco wouldn't have forgotten that. Of course, Harry had no problem with Draco flirting with him in public. The more he thought about it, the more amusing it became. He smiled to himself and pulled out his parchment, working again.
He knew Draco was planning on having a little gathering with his mother and his friends. But beyond that, he had no idea what to do for him. All he knew what that he would do everything he could to make the day as special as possible. But first, he had to make it through his exams.
Now Harry’s cheeks went red. “Draco.” He whined.
“Teddy!” Harry called out and Teddy quickly looked over.
“Better I put it there than in other people’s business, unlike you.” Harry obviously didn’t mean what he said with any rude intentions, it was how they joked around.
“Perhaps we have.” Harry agreed softly. He looked up at Draco and silently opened his arms. He wasn’t good at asking for physical affection. He wasn’t good at asking for anything because he was so used to being told no. He was used to being berated for even asking.
Deep green eyes turned playful and sinister. The eye contact was killing Draco. Harry’s eyes were so pretty. Maybe the innocence of it, maybe it was the confidence, but something about it made Draco shiver.
Draco couldn’t help but to give a soft smile as he lifted up and held Harry’s cock, keeping it aimed as he slowly sank down on it.
Pansy suggested they break into their room and leave rose petals and condoms everywhere. That was only a joke. She later followed up with a serious suggestion that they expose their feelings for each other while they’re both present. Pansy’s second idea was met with support, it would be the most blunt and simple solution. But there was still a bit of hesitation as the group wanted Seamus and Dean to get together on their own.
Maybe this is who he was now. Or perhaps, who he had always been. War changes people, but so does abuse. Perhaps there were certain cruelties he had always been capable of, but never needed to commit until now. Almost ruining a marriage, nothing. Destroying careers and reputations, meaningless. Manipulating people, insignificant. Sending a man to Azkaban solely to be petty, whatever. He realized that it all meant nothing to him and it never would mean anything. If he wasn’t going to feel bad on his own then he gave up trying. He accepted it. This was part of him now and he was over it. After all, he had better things to worry about.
"I won't, I promise." He said this under the assumption that the man would be caught in a few days, or perhaps a week. Really, his social life had never fluttered as much as it did now. He wrote regular letters to Seamus, met up with Pansy every week, and went to Paris to see Blaise every few days. He’d never been so happy with his social life.
Draco wasn't stupid. He knew how politics worked. Though he did give some credit to the fact that most people wouldn't say no to Harry Potter and that Wizengamot is largely newbies, he knew that getting support would take a lot more than that. He was also aware that Harry had a streak of breaking and bending rules. Something told him there was more to it, but he didn't want to push Harry to share. Instead, he only nodded. "That's nice of you."
McGonagall was staring at the list of new students with a sad smile. She went through the names until she reached one that she hadn’t said in years. “James Potter.”
Neville glanced over and said, “We’d better not have another Seamus and Dean situation.”
“Ow! What was that for?”
When Seamus finally left, Draco found himself alone in the house for the third day in a row. Though his mother and friends often visited him, and he always had his evenings with Harry, he was growing bored. Not even his book would satiate him given that it was all he really had to do. He had read all of his, written until he tired himself, and listened to Harry's muggle music until he had some songs memorized. In three short days of being in lockdown, he felt like he was losing his mind. He knew the consequences of going out, but he honestly was wondering how likely it would be that the attacker would consider Hogsmeade over Diagon Alley. He also wondered if Paris might be safe. After all, his comment to the journalist was the only time he had really been seen by the public in Paris. Perhaps he could spend an afternoon with Blaise.
Harry shifted a bit. It was very strange that his magic wasn’t working, and Draco’s calm demeanor somehow made him even more anxious.
Draco let out a chuckle, “Strange. I’ve never known you to surrender before.” He honesty didn’t think it would be that easy.
Harry only glanced at him and laughed. "You know you're strong enough to push her off. Just give her a little nudge."
100 Kudos! Thank you so much to everyone who has read my story. It's something I had been thinking about for a while but never felt confident in writing. I didn't expect it to get so popular, but I'm so thankful for it! I hope you continue to enjoy it because this is the most fun I've ever had writing a fic!
“Stupid.” Teddy repeated.
- - - - -
Draco looked at the pillow and then at Harry. “You’re getting new glasses as soon as possible.” He demanded.
“Well. Alright then.” Was all Harry could say to that.
“Eight.”
Draco tilted his head. “Well that explains why you just smiled and walked away. It really threw me off.”
Draco, on the other hand, was having a loud and exciting Christmas afternoon. He met Pansy and his mother in Paris, since it was agreed that they would spend the afternoon with Blaise and his mother. They gossiped and laughed as if it were still the good old days, before the war had even happened. Blaise’s mother had also gotten a new boyfriend that they assumed would end up dead shortly after writing Blaise’s mother into his will, as all her other boyfriends and husbands had. It was a terrible business, but nobody really commented on it. It was as if they were in a silent agreement to pretend it wasn’t happening. But she spoke about this one differently. As if she was genuinely interested in him and not his money. Blaise had also met him, which was unusual. Blaise typically would have no opinion of them, but now, he spoke very highly of the man and seemed to get along with him.
“Really? I thought you two were just friends.”
“I have more money than you.” Harry mumbled, rolling his eyes.
When mail came in the Great Hall, Harry watched his Howler settle in front of Draco.
She held the rosebud in her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. Harry felt his necklace heat up, warming him. A smile spread across his face while Hermione just looked a bit confused.
Harry gave a nod and softly thanked her.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Come on, then. Let’s make it.”
His orgasm crashed into him and he whined feverishly, desperate little noises coming at the end of every exhale, uncontrollable. A fruitless confession of his vices and satisfactions. He kneeled in the shaking thrill that washed over him, feeling himself shoot into Harry. He was almost embarrassed by how hard he came. It knocked him off his balance and he found himself fallen on Harry’s body, which still trembled under him.
Now Draco couldn’t stop the few tears that fell from his eyes. He wasn’t crying, but he was overflowing with emotion. “I believe you. I do. If you say you’ll be alright, then I trust that. But that won’t stop me from wanting something better for you.” He knew there wasn’t much he could do. His mother didn’t want any more drama or scandals. He knew she wanted a simple life from now on. She wanted to live quietly and die in peace. He wouldn’t do anything to sabotage that for her. But he would still do what he could. “Andromeda still lives in her old house. You should write her a letter sometime. I know she’d like to hear from you. She cares about you. She asks about you. She wants you to be happy too.” He paused a moment and wiped his eyes. “You both have lost so much. I think talking to each other would make you both a lot happier. You both deserve that much, at least.”
Harry frowned, “Were we really that bad?” He knew they were a bit obvious, but he didn’t think it was that bad.
He spent the next two hours studying Herbology with Neville and Seamus. Then another two studying Potions with Luna and Hermione.
“But you’re tired.” Draco countered. He didn’t want Harry to get him off while he was so out of it.
a revolution, Pawk. War isn't the end of it. It all comes down to politics. It
Harry and Hermione made their way to the front and began presented the department outline. It did not yet involve the laws. This vote was only on whether or not the department would be created.
Everyone watched them hug. It confused some students who turned to glance at Draco’s abandoned spot at the Slytherin table. There, they noticed the scrubs at Draco’s seat and found the moment to be heartwarming.
threatened to ride me. You did literally all of this.”
He looked up into the mirror and let out a gasp, nearly falling back as what greeted him.
So Draco handed over the book, and waited for a reaction.
Harry was visibly uncomfortable from the information he received. But he understood. “Alright. I’ll keep a few things. A few small things.”
Harry closed his eyes and smiled through his tears. “I knew it. Oh, I knew it.” He whimpered out his words and started to calm down from his outburst. He was relieved and rapturous to know it was them.
Harry let out a surprised laugh, “Did you?”
Of all possible responses, Harry actually let out a gasp and quickly moved his feet to keep up with Draco's more experienced movements. It only took a few turns for Draco to see how thrown-off Harry was, and he slowed the dance. "Better?"
In the end, they had a gorgeous looking risotto ready. It was full of vegetables, sausages, and a few spices. Of course, the dish wasn’t typically spicy, but Harry loved it that way. Still, given that he didn’t know Draco’s tastes, he eased up on the spice and especially the cheese. He only added a little bit since he knew Draco still ate it. He mixed it all together and set the pot on the cooker while Ron pulled out the dishware to make himself a bowl.
“You’re so wrong.”
Draco turned pink and licked his lips, looking away. “Oh.” He wasn’t used to this. Usually, when a man liked him, it was either for his looks or money. Harry had money, and apparently he didn’t even know how good Draco looked until now. So what was left but Draco. Just Draco, and who he was as a person. His heart skipped a beat and he took a sip of wine to try to calm himself.
Malfoy snorted, and rolled his eyes, "I'll give you the short one, Pansy." He smirked. Harry thought for a minute, then nodded.
"Why are you living here? Malfoy stop being so vague!" Harry practically whined, he wasn't sure what it was but something about the blonde Slytherin made him act childish. Luna looked up and blinked at him owlishly.
they were related on his father's side (and Luna had insisted that
"Dammit, Draco, I want to see the pictures." Pansy stomped her foot on the ground, similarly to a toddler throwing a tantrum. Just then Narcissa walked into the foyer.
Draco didn't see Potter again at Luna's flat, but he did see the Weaselette (although they were now on a first-name basis seeing as he lived with her girlfriend) very frequently, and she thoroughly enjoyed updating Draco on Potter's well being, for some reason. After living with Luna for quite some time (which Draco actually thought it did him some good being exposed to so much positive energy but he would never say such a thing) he had just about given up on the job search for being a tattooist, when Luna offered him a job at her parlor. He readily accepted, and they had both wondered why they hadn't come up with this solution in the first place. After a few months of working at The Inkubus, Draco had enough to live on his own and was about to go looking for flats, when Luna and Ginny bought a flat together and Draco just took Luna's old flat.
Harry had tried a few tattoo parlors both in the wizarding world and in the muggle world, and he eventually found The Inkubus; a tattoo parlor in muggle London, run by wizards and witches. He had gotten the majority of his tattoos there, and had become great friends with the staff, he even recommended it to his friends that showed interest in getting tattoos. To top it all off, Luna owned the place; after she had apprenticed under the old owner, when he retired he left it in her care.
drawings, and just had to stop by and see them for ourselves." At this Narcissa's face brightened, and she clasped her hands together.
"I'm living here for the time being." Malfoy said, as he entered the kitchen, Luna was standing over the sink mixing something in a pot that sat within.
"Oh! Thank you Draco!" She smiled, then stood on her toes and gave him a kiss on the cheek, "I'll just grab my coat and we'll be on our way." She grabbed a coat from a giraffe-shaped coat stand in the corner of the room and held her arm out to Harry. Which he took and led her from the kitchen and out the flat.
Harry had scheduled an appointment for a new tattoo, a small 9¾  behind his right ear. He entered the shop expecting Luna to greet him and get him ready for his appointment, but when he entered Malfoy sat behind the receptionist's desk. The bell over the door chimed as the door slowly closed behind Harry, Malfoy looked up from the book he was reading and smirked.
"Good to see you mate, for a minute Pansy and I thought you had fled the wizarding world to go  live in the woods and make potions." Blaise joked.
"I just never thought that
The first tattoo Draco ever designed was one for Pansy, it was a sprig of purple hyacinth on her left thigh- meaning remorse or regret. After hers turned out so well, Pansy practically forced Draco to get a tattoo himself. Draco decided he'd just get something to cover up the Dark Mark on his arm, he decided on yellow and white daffodils threaded throughout the mark. He chose daffodils because they represent new beginnings, and another name for them is the narcissus flower. He thought he'd just cover up the Mark and be done, but once he got his first tattoo he was spurred to get more.
Living with Luna had made Draco see far too many people from school for his liking. The worst of the many visitors to Luna's (
Designing tattoos eventually led Draco to applying for a job at a muggle tattoo parlor; and, with proper training, he became one of the most skilled artists in the shop. Eventually earning enough to rent a flat nearby, he moved out of the manor, and shortly afterwards his Aunt Andromeda and her grandson Teddy moved in with his mother. The sisters had decided that their family had been separated for long enough.
The, his mother began to invite friends over to view his artwork, he had begun to progress from just pencil and charcoal sketches to painted pieces. When Pansy had heard they were having guests over to view Draco's work, she had barged in the following day.
"No, Ginny knows. And Draco's my cousin, what does she have to be concerned about?" Luna looked up at him.
for Merlin's sake.
For the first year or so after the trials, he stayed at the manor with his mother, sorting through everything left behind by the ministry. Seeing what was good to keep and what they didn't need so they could sell it, and rebuild some of the Malfoy funds. In the little free time they had, Narcissa worked on her garden, making it larger and better than before; Draco helped too, at times, although most of his time in the gardens with his mother was spent sitting on a bench with a sketchpad, drawing her as she worked. After some time, his drawings had become quite good, and very realistic, Narcissa started hanging up the drawings all around the manor, much to Draco's embarrassment.
"Yes! He did an exquisite one on both Ginny and I's backs, we'll have to show you sometime. We got them matching on our anniversary." Luna prattled off. Malfoy handed him his receipt.
"Hello Potter, it's been a while... hasn't it?" Malfoy said, cooly. Eyeing Harry with an air of indifference. Harry was almost at a loss for words- almost.
"Oh." Was all Harry could manage before they apparated to Diagon Alley.
s) flat had to be Harry Potter. Draco didn't know what he was expecting when Luna told him that Potter would be coming over, but he certainly didn't expect the tall, dark, and handsome Potter that stood on their front step. Draco could see tattoos covering him where his skin wasn't clothed, he had finally grown into his body and was
Harry had knocked on the door, checking his watch quickly to make sure he wasn't too early. He was supposed to pick her up so they could go and meet Hermione and Ron for tea in Diagon Alley. He heard some scuffling inside and then Luna called "Can you get it?" Harry didn't know if that was directed at him until the door opened and he was met face to face with Draco Malfoy. He looked just as thin as ever, but in a healthy sort of way not in the sickly thin way he had been, he looked more sleek and elegant than he had in his Hogwarts days, his hair was slightly longer than before and had parted it so his fringe hung over his right eye. He tucked his fringe behind his ear and gave Harry a once over.
"The pompous idiot I used to be got a lot of people killed, Pansy." Draco's face fell, as he spoke softly. Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, Blaise laid a gentle hand on Draco's shoulder.
busy, dealing with his fame and fan clubs." Even though Harry couldn't see Malfoy, he knew that he had rolled his eyes.
"Do you want the short answer or the long one?" Malfoy smirked and he pulled out a stool and sat next to Potter and started sketching, with an occasional glance at the file.
"He needed somewhere to live while he looks for a new flat, so I offered my spare bedroom." She smiled, then looked between them. "Harry would you help me? I'm making food for the owls that deliver the post, but it seems more soup then solid." She lifted the pot and he heard it slosh.
"How did you get about tattooing, anyways Malfoy?" Harry suddenly asked, his curious nature getting the better of him.
"Makes sense." He said simply, "But do you want to elaborate?"
"You're getting a nine and three quarters tattoo? What are you a child?" Malfoy asked smugly.
"I'm not amazing, I just do it to spend time with mother, and besides what else am I supposed to do all day?" Draco, walked over to a bench that was on the side of the room and sat down, Pansy and Blaise followed him.
"Oh! Harry! Hello! Are you finished already? How did Draco do?" She smiled at him as she came to inspect his bandaging. Malfoy had turned around and started punching things in on their cash register.
"Should I warn Ginny that you're giving a room to Malfoy and kissing him on the cheek? I reckon that's something your girlfriend should know." He said as they walked to the apparation point. Luna smiled again, with a dreamy look on her face.
Potter.
"As enticing as that sounds, I stayed here with mother." Draco said, finally shrugging Pansy off of him.
"So we meet again Potter." He said, looking Harry up and down.
Then Potter walked through the doors of The Inkubus, and Draco was rejuvenated.
After Narcissa had left Pansy lunged at Draco, and enveloped him in a hug. "Dray! I've missed you so much!" She squealed. Draco chuckled lightly, Blaise clapped a hand on his back.
"Oh, yes, forgive me. Sometimes I forget that the boy who lived is
"Don't pretend to be humble Dray, it doesn't work for you. I miss the pompous idiot you used to be." Pansy nudged his shoulder.
"Relax, Potter. I'm not going to hex you," Malfoy looked down at the pen and paper in his hands with a smirk, "not even sure how I'd go about doing that. I have to sketch the idea to make sure you like it, no need to jump every three seconds. C'mon, Potter, if I hexed you I'd lose my job." Malfoy smiled, it was easygoing, different from his smirks and forced smiles from Hogwarts.
"Yeah, erm, it has Malfoy." He said, and a brief silence ensued.
"Hello Narcissa," Pansy smiled at her, "we had heard about our dear Draco's
"Hello Pansy, Blaise, it's lovely to see you again, it's been a long time hasn't it?" Draco said sarcastically, Pansy just rolled her eyes and Blaise shot him a grin.
After their first meeting after the war, Harry avoided going to Luna's flat, that was until he was invited to Luna
"What I mean is: what are you doing in Luna's flat, Malfoy?" Harry said, following Malfoy as he walked through the house.
Draco worked at the muggle tattoo parlor for quite some time, until one day a girl came in and insisted that she get a tattoo that matched his Mark. He knew the girl didn't understand the severity behind the symbol and the hate it meant, but he still refused her. She complained to the owner of the parlor, and that had been that. Draco was fired. He had never experienced such a thing in his life, and the only thing he could equate it to was Harry Potter refusing to shake his hand.
"Yeah," Harry spoke absentmindedly, gazing at the intricate flowers woven throughout the Mark, "you designed it?" He looked up at Malfoy in awe. A faint blush was dusted across Malfoy's face, and he just nodded. He drew a few more lines on the page, then rested the pen behind his ear.
"So, here's the sketch I drew up. In the file all it says is a nine and three quarters tattoo, and before Luna left she said you generally like your tattoos simple, so I just drew the sign from the station." Malfoy spoke, turning the sketchpad around for Harry to look at.
Harry followed Malfoy as he walked back out to the lobby, Harry waited in front of the desk while Malfoy rummaged around behind, putting Harry's file away. His mind began to drift again when the bell over the door chimed and Luna bustled in.
"Poetic Potter," Malfoy said, before realizing he sounded harsh, "that wasn't meant to sound rude, my tattoos have meaning too," he smiled and pointed at the flowers covering his Mark,"these are daffodils, also known as the Narcissus flower, so it sort of has a dual meaning for me, these flowers represent new beginnings, but also since my mother's name is Narcissa, I thought it was fitting."
"It's like you've never been tattooed before, Potter." Malfoy grumbled as Harry moved to sit in the chair, he turned back towards the file.
Draco was getting his life back on track, he had fallen into a steady rhythm of working Monday through Saturday, tea with his family on Thursday, and he usually went out for pints with Pansy and Blaise and sometimes Luna and Ginny on Fridays. He loved his flat, which still had a touch of Luna-ness about it, but now was sleeker and more modernized as per Draco's taste. He inked his body with more flowers, usually only trusting Luna to do it, and he even considered getting a pet to keep him company at home. He was becoming complacent, loving his life and routine but wanting something more.
