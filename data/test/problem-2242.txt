Warm fingers wrapped around his own and the man's eyes softened as he murmured, "See that you don't. You can't miss the practice tomorrow if you want to play professionally."
"Have you even seen him? He looks like a beast." Draco grits his teeth together. He doesn't want to hear all this again.
"Let's have breakfast, eh?" Harry murmured "It's my turn to prepare. Just wait for a few minutes on the table."
Blaise was right though because if he wasn't over reacting, clearly someone would say something. He couldn't just up and go and snap at them. They were her family and who was he to judge how they behaved with each other.
"You stopped looking at me. Even at the burrow, you won't stay in my presence. So I stopped trying. I'm sorry. I should have tried harder. It would have been easier for you that way." She says.
." Weasley snapped at him. Draco jumped in surprise although Potter didn't as much as blink an eye. Black only shook his head.
"He hasn't moved on. You know he hasn't." Harry cut her off again, "He just won't forgive me. He refuses to talk to me. I love him, Hermione. I can't move on. He didn't send the divorce papers."
"Do you think I am blind or perhaps you think I am dumb? I can clearly see that you are trying to please me with these things. Since when are you terrified that I would leave you?" Harry removed his plate and placed his hands on the table.
He cast a spell very discreetly to keep their conversation away from prying ears and could not help himself from mumbling very softly "I wish that you would not be so angry Draco."
"I'll go and bring him back." These were Harriet's first words and uncle Severus wasn't surprised that she had gotten straight to the point. Jameson was five years younger to her and William was a child. That left her because uncle Severus would have to ascend the throne in father's absence.
"YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE NEEDED IT BUT I WANTED YOU TO BE BLOODY HAPPY. WHY SHOULDN'T I WANT TO MAKE MY HUSBAND HAPPY." Harry screamed, trying to explain his feelings to Draco. Of course, Draco twisted his words all over again.
"I will punish her. I will get her thrown into Azkaban." Harry snarled at the ceiling and the other inhabitants agreed with him, all except Draco.
Harry knew that Draco was scared that Harry would not like how Draco looked because Draco still had scars on his body. The area around his nipples was scarred by the cigarette marks and his back and chest held the old scars of whip or stick or whatever those sick bastards used.
"Where's he?" He says. Petunia finds herself at a loss of words. She stares speechlessly at little Harry Potter.
He received no response to that and yelled again "I am sure you don't need my protection now that you are angry with me."
Harry opens his mouth to say something but Ron's sudden "Ahem" stops him. There is a warning in Ron's eyes and his back is too stiff. Some heads turn in their direction. Ginny breaks the tension by standing and declaring, "I am finished too. Harry, I'll come with you."
The other man smirks before answering, "Maybe you can ask him that is if we do manage to find them. I still think that this search is entirely pointless."
"Draco." He murmured desperately and Draco moved. Before Harry even knew what was happening, Draco had moved close to him and was kissing him urgently. His hands were on Harry's cheeks and Harry's eyes shot wide open as they met Draco's.
Harry stopped just after closing the gate. Albus didn't. He continued walking towards the door of his house, Malfoy leaning on him.
"You know how he gets when he is angry, Ron. We can't loose Malfoy. He wants Malfoy to be an example for-"
"How are you, Granger? How is everything going?" Draco asked nonchalantly. However, Granger was so busy in her papers that she didn't even notice. Blaise stared at him, his brows raised.
"I am not lying." Draco started and Harry clenched his hand and slammed his fist on the slap "I SAID SHUT UP." And Merlin, Harry's hands were red and he murmured "You will get hurt. Stop this madness Harry. "
She sat there, her legs crossed, looking small and lost. She was just ten year old and he wanted to kill Vernon Dursley but that would be a mercy. He would not give the bastard such and easy death. The man would pay.
"Draco. No. You can't." He said and as he had expected Draco cringed and jumped up so suddenly that Harry could just stare. His silver eyes held panic and Harry stood up slowly. There was no point in disturbing Draco's mind any more.
However, the man might simply refuse to help Albus if Albus doesn't answer. Dad has gone to France on some head auror business and will return after a week. This might be the only chance Albus has to view his memories. This also might be the only opportunity to ask around about Draco's memories too. Mr. Zabini is Draco's closest friend after Mrs. Parkinson-Nott who simply asked him to stay away from it.
"I tried to talk to you about him. But you didn't listen to me." Ginny continues. With a jerk, Harry realizes that he had scolded Ginny very harshly when she had attempted to talk to him about Draco.
"Actually, this pose is perfect. I want to show everyone that your family loves you a lot and that there's still hope for orphans like you till kind hearted people like Weasleys exist," Creevy muttered, placing the camera in front of his eyes.
With trembling hands, Harry opens the door. He knows not to believe what he hasn't witnessed with his own eyes. But the evidence of Draco's infidelity is glaring at him for Draco is not just with Seamus. Marcus Flint is with them too. They are standing in various states of undress.
"You have to understand one thing Draco. Rape-" Harry stopped speaking and then breathed hard. It came down to it. He was as bad as those bastards. Just because Draco pushed him off and nothing happened it didn't mean that nothing could have happened.
After a silence of sound three minutes, Draco spoke " I want to thank both of you for bearing with this insanity. We don't know what we would do without you. I want to move on now. I have decided something and want to tell this decision to everyone. Expect my owl tomorrow." Harry was astonished but he was still angry with Draco so he kept his eyes closed.
"Shhhhh. Are you off your rocker? We can't tell anyone about it. He trusted us with the information. Shut up and keep searching. He is injured and should be somewhere close by." Weasley growls.
"I pranked Professa Snape aunty." The child whispers as if sharing a secret, her green eyes wide and impossibly mischievous.
Ginny doesn't say anything so he follows Albus out of the house, knowing that this is a wild goose chase. But, he had promised uncle Harry and father that he'll always take care of Albus, that he'll never leave him alone and it happens that he loves Albus and does want to find them. They have been exchanging letters with them ever since they disappeared and he wants to meet both of them in person.
"Shhhh. Sleep. Soon it will be fine. I am taking you to your bedroom. Shhhh." It's almost like he is hypnotizing Harry. The last thing that he hears is Aunt Petunia's gasp and pained scream.
"We received a letter. The writer had written their name in the opposite order." He spoke and Draco stared at Harry before muttering, "Why did you not tell me about your suspicions earlier?"
His son looks desperately at him. Harry places his index finger on his lips and Albus nods. Harry heads towards the trembling girl. She is blonde and has straight, waist-length hair.
"Aunt Petunia hated me for being Lily's child and for having magic. Vernon hated magic altogether and Dudley was too bull-headed to think anything by himself."
Everyone except Sirius had decided to return. Lucius, Narcissa, Remus and Severus were returning a day before them. Severus and Remus had decided to live at Spinners end and teach at Hogwarts. Hermione and Ron had decided to return after a while. Lucius and Narcissa had decided to live at the Manor.
"I should never have left Draco with you. I should have taken him away when I had the chance. You destroyed his life. I HATE YOU SO-" Severus shouted and released himself from Draco's hold because Draco was busy gaping furiously at Granger standing in front of him with crossed arms.
"Tessa has this look in her eyes at times." He said and Harry's fury flared and so did his magic. Their cups trembled and so did the windows. Their eyes met and Harry was the one who broke the silence "Why did you not owl me earlier? This is a delicate issue."
The hypocrisy of these people astounded him. A decade back, they had fawned over Harry and had cursed him to a place where his soul had been shattered into million pieces and today when he was successful, they were welcoming him with both arms.
Draco swallowed and looked as Harry lay down and opened his arms to welcome Draco. He went willingly in them, not questioning Harry or his decision.
The word had just slipped his mouth when Draco punched him, stopping any words from slipping his mouth "Shut up. Don't say such things."
Draco looked at his husband before continuing "I think that you had hated my spying or sneaking on you because you had always been sneaked upon. I should have not done that. I am sorry."
Blinky popped out of nowhere and murmured, "Blinky will check the door, Masters." and then disappeared again.
"It's okay. Harry, why are you crying?" Draco asked and he ignored the way his own voice broke. No he was not crying. He was not a child. He ignored everyone around him. It was not difficult considering that they had gone silent. Everyone except Harry was silent. Though, when one heard carefully, Granger's sobbing could be heard very clearly.
Draco's heart raced and swelled with love when he saw love in Harry's eyes. They were green and exquisite and Draco wanted to drown in them.
Draco keeps on staring at the ceiling. The room is boring with dull walls, an old dresser and a bed and an attached bathroom. But it's better than azkaban and the streets. Draco doesn't know how much time has passed since he came- maybe ten minutes- fifteen. Potter has not come yet. There are no house elves and Draco is hungry and thirsty. What's he supposed to do now?
Finally, when there was only Potter with him in the room beside Pansy and Blaise, he spoke up, "What's going on, Potter?"
"Can I just -" Potter cuts off, his right hand carding through his hair helplessly, "I want to comfort you. Can I?"
"Mr. Potter, I-" The boy starts calmly. He stops and clears his throat before continuing, "I wanted to say that - that sometimes people change with time. Sometimes, you need to take a leap of faith to actually believe that they have changed."
Harry said and looked at him again after placing his cup on the table. Draco had frozen from shock on his chair.
"You most certainly won't." The words were firmly spoken but didn't belong to uncle Severus who had in fact opened his mouth to say something akin to this. They belonged to her aunt Sierra. Mom was still crying. It was painful to watch. But, there was no time to console mother.
"You can send Narcissa to Godric's Hollow too." Harry murmurs and Snape looks at her, "Yes I can but I think that she might be able to help at Hogwarts. She had been practicing as a healer before the Dark lord came back. Granger is only starting so she can look after Draco but she can't look after more complicated injuries."
"Draco, hullo." Draco grimaced. Weasley had taken to calling him by his first name and he spoke so politely that Draco could not help but revert back.
"Go and consume this- this poison, for all I care. Go to fucking hell. Just leave me fucking alone and keep your fucking minions on a fucking leash." Draco yelled at him and Harry sneered back "They are my friends. I won't ask them to stay away."
"Hmmm. Love you too. Goodnight. Don't forget your promise." Harry whispered and placed his face on Draco's shoulders.
"What's the matter?" He asked, worried about Harry's behaviour. Harry did not answer which escalated his worry. "Harry, what is the matter? Will you tell me?"
He can't cry. He needs to be strong for her. A few hours of someone's insanity have destroyed Draco's life... his life.
Draco simply nodded and accioed his trousers before putting them on. After that Harry opened the door and led them to the sitting room. Granger and Weasley were sitting quietly and he ignored Weasley completely. He couldn't bear to look at the man at all.
"It's all your fault." Narcissa hisses, tears flowing down her cheeks. Her eyes are red-rimmed and she has been crying for a while now, "You didn't even tell me that he asked you if he could court our daughter, that he wants to marry Draco."
Severus wants to say many things to her. He wants to get Potter checked for curses but all he can do is stare speechlessly at her.
"Mister," Malfoy insisted and Harry bent down, picking Scorpius in his arms. Of course, Malfoy protested but he was just so weak that he couldn't even stand up before limping.
"Hand- me- what? I am your husband. My clothes are not hand me downs." Draco answered, totally stunned. He wondered about the reason of such a strong reaction from Harry. He also wondered why he felt so good when he called Harry his husband. He had wanted to end their marriage after all and it would be better for Harry if he found someone else.
"Do you even like chinese food?" Scorpius asks James, amused. He knows that James isn't a big fan of chinese food.
"But, you like dad." James argues bitterly and looks away "He's married and is thirty nine and loves your father and you still like him."
They had helped Dudley to find a list of buyers for there existing property. They had also helped him in renting an apartment in Hogsmeade.
Skeeter stares at him, her eyes wide with disbelief before whispering, "So you're saying that you deflected from you-know-who's cause because little Harry Potter is fond of the white peacocks and gardens of the Malfoy manor?"
"I don't think that it will come to begging. Pack quickly. I am taking you to order's headquarter." Severus mutters and leans back before closing his eyes.
"Of course, I would try to avenge you. Of course, I would try to kill them. It will be upto you to stop me." Harry muttered, his lips touching Draco's and Draco moaned when Harry sucked the lower lip.
Lucius blinks a couple of times to ensure that this isn't a dream. When he's sure, he looks at the pouting faces of the two five year olds and nods, "Yes. Yes. Go ahead."
"Hex me if you feel uncomfortable and I don't back off." He murmurs softly and she breaths deeply before nodding.
"Albus." Ginny starts. Her eyes are soft as she looks at her son, "I really don't know where Harry is. We weren't on speaking terms."
Granger's and Weasley's divorce that had occurred two years ago had come as a shock to everyone. Draco, however, who had witnessed and envied the golden trio and their strong friendship had been absolutely stunned when they had divorced and given the statement that their relationship had died twelve years ago. They had lived together for their children.
Had it been minutes or seconds or hours since Harry had fallen. The time did not matter. Nothing mattered other than the fact that life was slowly seeping out of Harry and Draco could do nothing except stare at his unconscious face.
"DRACO. DRACO. WHAT IS HAPPENING? SNAP OUT OF IT." The voice shouted and his eyes shot open. Harry's face was close to his and he hugged the man desperately and tightly. Harry's essence was so pure that it always soothed him. Belatedly, he realized that tears were flowing down his eyes.
Potter moves closer to his table and stands behind the chair, placing her hands on the headrest before asking quietly, "Have you ever thought what will happen if Ariana is a veela."
A moment later they bid him goodbye and leave. He noticed them talking to Scorpia too. When Hermione hugged her, the kid's shoulders relaxed and her lips twitched in a very small smile.
Draco huffed and pushed Harry away with gentle hands and continued, looking at Dudley now, "Now on with it. Where is Vernon Dursley? I have already sent a word to the muggle policemen. They will come and take Tessa's statement and take him away. We will take you to Hogsmeade. You can live on rent over there until you find a suitable place to live in. You can sell this house and convert the money into Galleons."
"Draco, no matter what-" He stopped because tears had gathered in his eyes again. His vision was blurred as he continued, "It does not matter who does it Draco. You have to back off if you don't want to."
"Yes. Please come in Ms. Malfoy." He says after a few seconds. His voice is overly sweet and his eyes are gleaming with something Draco can't place. The office is quite spacious and beautiful. Behind Potter's chair, there is a large window that is currently covered by blue curtains. The walls are painted cream and the furniture consists of a table and a few chairs.
"He is sedated. Do not worry. We will wait until Draco returns." Dudley stopped at this and looked at Harry expectantly. Harry looked at him flabbergasted.
Draco was not healing at all. At this rate, he would have to take Draco to a professional mind healer and he knew that Draco would never agree to that.
"Come on in. I'll call the Weasleys over and we'll have Treacle tart and cakes and you'll finally understand that no-one hates you." He says and she gapes at him in shock.
He pulled back and Draco looked at him "I am dirty. Please don't - You don't understand. They - they - so many- please."
"Everyone needs to go to the staff room immediately. We will conduct all our meetings there," Draco said. The elder Weasleys stood up and left. They didn't say anything and didn't meet his eyes which proved at least one thing. They knew what was happening and were still supporting it. Charlie was standing against the wall in the corner of the room. His arms were crossed.
Scorpius closes the door slowly and pushes his hands inside his pockets before walking towards the kitchen. He has taken only a few steps when a voice stops him in his tracks.
Whatever Granger said went unheard because Draco's whole world was falling apart around him. What was the use of money when Harry would not be alive to enjoy it with him? In his shock, he forgot that he had decided to let Harry go. He had not known that Harry had been serious when he had spoken of dying.
"Fault!" Albus exclaimed, his eyes going wide in surprise, "It's not a bad thing to help others, dad. You said so."
Had he been so self-centred? Why had he never spoken to Draco about it? It was obvious that Draco needed to speak to someone. Burying the memories won't get rid of them. Draco would have to talk about them eventually. Harry knew nothing at all.
"Visit us after throwing them in Azkaban Weasley, Granger." Draco murmurs and embraces Harry. They apparate to their home. Finally it's over.
The child turns to look at Snape and says, "I tow -uh- to-l-d you, uncle Severus." and then, "Pwease give me that letter and the bag."
He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco and sighed when he felt Draco bury his face in his neck again.
Vernon sighs and stands up to open the door. Petunia doesn't look at him. She keeps on staring at the sky. When they were small, they used to climb trees and sit on the branches and play together and then Lily realized that she was a witch and Petunia wasn't and everything changed.
"No. In fact, the first thing we should do is paying a visit to Vernon Dursley. He needs to be thrown in prison." Draco answered and Harry turned to look at him.
"Uncle Draco." Tessa's soft voice brought him out of his tortured musings and his eyes shot wide open. Belatedly, he realized that his hands were trembling and were clenched hard enough to bruise his palms. His teeth were gritting and Tessa continued "I did not let him. Magic always helped. Pansy used to encourage him and I hated her so much. She wanted to bind my magic and hurt me. I never understood why."
"I am not a coward." Draco gritted his teeth angrily and narrowed his eyes and Harry continued bluntly "The Draco asshole Malfoy I had known in Hogwarts would have stopped at nothing to destroy them. You have been hiding here for the past decade like a coward."
She sniffs and wipes her eyes but tears keep on falling relentlessly down her cheeks and all the while Lily's son's green eyes stare at her just like Lily used to do when Petunia cried.
"I can take care of myself Potter." Draco mutters haughtily, attempting to lighten his mood but fails. The terror is still there and Harry closes his eyes and turns around. Draco wishes he could empathize with him. he wishes he could know what Harry was feeling right at this moment but he doesn't think he can understand it completely.
"Harry." Draco's soft voice reached him but he did not turn around. He just kept on gazing out. "Harry." Draco spoke again and this time, Harry heard something akin to desperation in his voice. Finally, he turned around and almost stumbled when he saw Draco's eyes. His eyes were shining and he was out of breath. It seemed that he had run all the way to his room. Something had changed and Harry wondered what it was.
"Look, both of you are my fathers and it was my mistake for being an ignorant fool. Past is past and I have move- moved on. Mostly." Draco's stammer at the end gave him away and his father whispered softly "You can't even look at me. You can't even say it and you want me to believe it, Draco." Father spoke and Draco stayed quiet, looking at Severus with shame in his eyes. "Look at me Draco." Father said and Draco shook his head.
Harry just looked at her quietly and then turned to look at Lucius again who was leaning against the door now. Draco's hands were visible now and the skin was still peeled from there. It had become better since yesterday but it was no where near healed.
"Hello." He replied, turning his face a bit to acknowledge the red head. It was difficult since Harry was resting in his lap so he turned back to his Harry staring.
These words rang in his mind over and over and he turned to look at Draco. Draco was not sleeping. His eyes were open and tired as if he had not slept at all.
Just a minute back Harry and he had hugged them and now – now they did not even exist. Was it too much to want children, Harry's and his children? He hugged himself sadly and visualized his kids's laughing faces again.
He looked up and found Draco looking at him with raised eyebrows "Are you sure? I thought it irritated you."
"I would tell you that you're merely obsessed with him and I would also tell you to stop obsessing over a man you know nothing about but it would be fruitless." Dad snaps angrily at him.
From the corner of his eyes, he peaked to check whether mum dad had left but they were still their and he couldn't control himself from looking into Harry's eyes desperately. He was ashamed of himself and though father said that they weren't, he knew that he would never be able to look them in their eyes.
Draco's eyes nearly bulge out of their sockets and jaw drops ungracefully. Severus knew that Potter was alive. Draco remembers seeing him at Potter's funeral. No one was sure if the coffin even consisted of Potter's body. The only ones who could have known were Severus and Sirius and no one dared to ask them. Both were extremely temperamental. Granger and Weasley were there as well.
"NO." They yelled at him and he continued "Bygones are bygones and I have moved on." Of course, his fingers trembled on Severus's shoulder and he averted his gaze.
Harry took his lips inside his to deepen the kiss and Draco felt like coming home. The kiss became passionate and Harry turned his face the other way to get proper access. It was like Harry was devouring him and Draco hugged Harry tightly.
Draco turns around to close the door. But when she turns back around, she finds Mr. Potter gazing peculiarly at her. As soon as their eyes meet, the man blinks and smiles.
He wanted to shrug his clothes off and bury his cock between Harry's buttocks. He wanted to kiss Harry's shoulders and leave love bites on them. He wanted to feel Harry all around him. He wanted taste each and every part of his husband's body but he was still not ready yet.
"I apologize." Albus simply replies. He wonders what dad would say if he knew about Albus's crush on this man. Will he dislike Albus even more or will he simply disown Albus. Albus thinks that dad will chose the latter.
"When did they monopolise me? When did they snatch me away from you?" He whispered and gently took his wand away from his hand and kept it back in his pocket. Of course, Hermione had to intervene.
Of course, Draco stopped to investigate. He was the head auror after all and Creevy needed to be stopped if he was harassing civilians.
She tried hard not to break down and wore a thigh-length jacket over her gown before walking out of the house. Vernon was sitting in the sitting room, watching T.V. and Dudley was reading a book, sitting on a chair, his elbows on the dining table. He was writing something in a notebook and was also doing some calculations. She didn't understand how Vernon and Dudley had gotten accustomed to the smell and she headed towards the door and then walked out.
Harry nods quietly. It's all very unreal. He can live in the near constant fear of being attacked by Voldemort but he can't live through this. He can't live knowing that Draco was betraying him all along. There has to be some kind of explanation of this, something that Harry is missing. It makes no sense.
Draco looked at him, his eyes startled and Harry took another long breath. He was not a teenager. He should have had a better control over his hormones. Draco trusted him. It was difficult to say this but he had to. He had brought this upon himself.
"Tell me who did what? Tell me Draco. For Merlin's sake, tell me." Harry pleaded and looked into his eyes, his hands in Draco's.
Harriet breathed, his hands shaking in frustration, "I know that you're somehow behind everything that's happened in the past few days."
"Hermione. I asked Ron to stay away for some days. Draco is not comfortable and we have not spoken yet." Harry snarled and Draco's eyebrows rose higher. Harry was disturbed but he was never so disturbed. The fact that he had not risen up to even open the door was evidence that Harry had changed a lot. "Please leave. I will owl you when Draco is ready. You should have owled before arriving. This is no way to-" Draco interrupted because Harry was snarling which was not good. "Harry, it's fine. Calm down. Wait in the sitting room, Granger. We will be out in a couple of minutes."
He wants to stop thinking rationally. His body wants what it wants. He loves her with his heart and soul. He has wanted her for a long time. But then again, this is only the body of the girl he fell in love with. He wonders if Draco is even alive inside this body. Maybe Riddle took Draco's soul with him. Maybe Harry lost after all, for this victory, in which he doesn't have Draco with him, is empty.
His eyebrows rose in surprise when he saw Lucius standing there, his wand on the floor. This time his eyes were not unreadable. Far from it, they were clearly showing his guilt, his remorse and Harry closed his eyes again. What was the point now? His guilt would not change anything.
"Draco, listen to me." Harry whispered as he sat up and his voice broke. He had never imagined that he will have to say these things. But it was necessary. He loved Draco, no matter what he had done the last night. He had never loved anyone as he loved Draco and thank god, Draco had punched him before things had gotten out of hand.
She knocked gently on the door because she still couldn't believe that Harry was dead. Maybe, he was sleeping and had urinated in his bed.
It was nice to have Draco beside him. Harry craved so much for Draco that he would fall a thousand times if it meant that Draco would sit with him. He did what he wanted and turned towards Draco and looked at him.
"You're the only connection he has with Lily." Snape mutters, "We're doing our best but you know the most about his mother. Maybe you could talk to him- of course, after you are done with grieving."
He directs them towards the fireplace. They take a complete minute to notice Scorpia and when they do, they freeze but it lasts only for a minute.
"Honestly, Harry, when have I asked you to be formal with me?" Granger snapped at him and all of a sudden she was all professional and turned to speak to her husband "Please remain here Ron. We will return and then talk. Do not enter the room in any circumstances."
Kreahcer trembling figure came in and the elf was pulling his ears. He asked, a bit startled "What happened?"
"I don't miss her. She chose her freakishness over me and it killed her and I-" Her voice breaks at the end and so she shuts up. She doesn't miss Lily. Lily was a freak and one of those freaks took her death.
She nodded slowly and backed off "Okay, Harry, as you wish." Harry had his eyes glued on Draco who was now looking everywhere around his house. Hermione left his house quietly, closing the door behind her and he did not look back.
"I have no words." Severus whispers and finally Lucius looks at him before whispering, "He threatened to kill our entire family including you if I don't take her to him."
While, Harry and Draco were making plans of a happy future, miles away, in Britain, a red headed woman was making her own plans with her old accomplices. He had dared to snatch her Harry away from her, cursing her with a life without her love. While she rotted in Britain with bloody Neville, he was leading a happy married life.
"I- does she know it?" Harry asks and Hermione shakes her head, "No. She doesn't. I didn't have the heart to tell her. If she starts vomiting or feels anything different, ask her to take the pregnancy test."
"I have not been able to contact him. Even I am wondering about his whereabouts. He is not at his home in France." Remus replied after clearing his throat.
Albus is bringing his girlfriend after dinner. Apparently, it's a surprise for everyone. He hasn't told even Ginny. Harry is the first one to know. Harry wonders why that is. As such, his kids are closer to him then Ginny which is understandable since Ginny is out of country for most of the year for her matches. They stay with him during holidays. Still it's quite fishy. Albus seemed really nervous when he told about it to Harry. Lily was grinning whereas James was just rolling his eyes affectionately. Both Lily and James made it clear that they won't judge Albus for the choice of his partner and it seemed that they already knew who it was.
"IT IS YOUR FAULT. YOU LEFT ME AND THEN THE MEMORIES WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE." Harry screamed at the top of his voice and Draco crawled out of the bed.
Their peace was disturbed by a soft tapping on the window and Draco yawned "Open the window, Harry."
"Truth was on your side, Draco. Once people would have known that you were a spy, that you had to suffer through Cruciatus multiple times to retrieve information, they would have protested and even now you could do so. Fudge is the undersecretary to Kingsley and Kingsley is a fair man. You could uncover the past and get them punished but you want to hide in a hole. You are a coward, just like your asshole of a father, who got you marked. Your mother loves you, yes, but then she did nothing to protect you, to prevent your marking. That's what you are. A bunch of cowards. I had thought that my Draco is a brave man, that he will fight against the injustice but you vanished and then I thought that my Draco is a optimistic man, he will find some way to earn, even if it is a muggle way, but you let them take benefit of your vulnerability. I had thought that my Draco would never let anyone manipulate him but you did. Then when we got separated and when we were reunited, I had thought that my Draco would never accept defeat and try to die. He will rise and show everyone that no one can destroy him but you did. You are not my Draco anymore. You are a coward and a broken and a defeated man. My Draco would have done everything to find the culprits and get them punished. He would have compelled the whole ministry to beg for his mercy." Harry stopped for a minute to take a deep breath. He was panting and Draco was completely speechless. He stared at Harry, his mouth open in shock. He couldn't really deny anything and he could just stare in shock as Harry barked at him, his voice rude and furious, "You are a thief. You stole my Draco from me and hid him somewhere I can never find him again. Though I love you, I would always despise you for taking my Draco away from me."
A loud sound of the foot hitting wood startled her and she started walking towards the cupboard where Harry's corpse was supposed to be rotting for a decade. It almost felt like there were ghosts in the house. It was smelling so much. She wanted to cry. She wanted to scream. She wanted to close her eyes. But, she did nothing of the sort. She only kept walking. She was not a witch and couldn't turn a cupboard into a wall. She couldn't because she wasn't magical and if being magical entailed becoming a murderer then she didn't want magic at all.
Harry held him silently. Words were not required. Harry understood Draco's pain. He understood and he wiped his own tears. Draco had still emerged out of everything completely unscathed and Harry was proud of his husband for being strong.
He stops and then adds as an after thought, "Don't try to help anyone. You are not in a state to help. If you do wish to help, you could provide any healing potions that you have brewed or you can brew to Hogwarts infirmary. Your mother is helping at the infirmary too."
Harry unzipped Draco's trousers and Draco placed his hand on Harry's shoulders. Harry could clearly hear his raging heart beats.
Taken aback, potions master Draco stumbled. His face became red. Draco had searched his dragon for years and mother had told him just last month that she had found it in her wardrobe and he had taken a huge risk by assuming that the man in front of him was also searching for the lost toy. It was worth it though because Draco took advantage of the potion master's embarrassment and opened the door and after a last glance at Harry Potter who was torn between laughing and gaping, he took the step out and closed the door behind him and was utterly, utterly relieved to find himself in his own room. Blaise was sitting on his bed, playing chess with Pansy.
"Yes, Master" Kreacher, muttered and Harry noticed that the stupid elf was happy to be ordered by Draco.
Last Harry heard of Draco was when she married Theodore Nott straight after graduating. Completely unlike what Harry had thought, she quit her studies and soon after she gave birth to a baby girl.
"Draco." He speaks her first name which comes as a surprise to her. The name doesn't sound unfamiliar on his lips, as if he has saying it for ages, though she has never heard him say it, "We don't have time. I- listen. I have this portkey."
Their eyes met, Harry's soft and his must have been a bit panicked because Harry whispered, his lips brushing Draco's "You flinched. Did you think that I was going to hurt you just because you placed your thoughts in front of me?"
"I AM SORRY FOR THAT." Father stands and glares at me with pained eyes, "THAT WAS MY MISTAKE. HE WAS PUNISHING YOU FOR THAT. His insanity made him forget everything. He was just a small fragment of his soul, a damaged fragment. He had no memories, no morality, no humanity, no goals. His only goal was to destroy everything and I am so-" Father's voice breaks as he settles down again, "-sorry that you paid for my mistake. I couldn't retrieve the prophecy. I wanted to, if only to protect you from his wrath."
"Okay," came the answer and Draco heard heels clicking on the floor and he did not turn around to stare at her. He did not. Pansy looked at him, surprised at his restraint.
Her eyes become damp and his heart goes out to her. She is in so much pain but atleast she is still alive behind all that darkness.
She looked at him, tears streaking down her pale cheeks "Lily would never forgive me. My god. What did I do? I am so sorry. I starved you and Vernon-. My god. She will never forgive me."
Severus breaths slowly and deeply and looks at Black. She is staring at him, her eyes blank. If Severus had expected some kind of accusation or threatening, he was sorely wrong. All he received was utterly unreadable eyes.
"Skipping around the house, singing merry tunes for the past four days." Harry mocked him, his eyes clearly dark now, "La La La La La. Draco is burning. La la la-"
"I have already told you that I did what I did because I wanted to - not because Albus asked me to or because I saw Lily in you or because I had to pay Potter's debt off. I did it because I wanted to but you still continue-"
Who would understand this better than Snape or Sirius who could have saved his parents if they had arrived a few minutes early.
"An eye for an eye makes the world blind Harry." Draco whispered and Harry pursed his lips before speaking "Its better that the world in which a person is forced to sell his soul, his dignity to earn bread and butter ceases to exist. The people whom you are trying to protect destroyed you and they deserve to be destroyed. I will find them and I will make them pay. They are lucky that I am not Tom Riddle. I would not do what they did, at least. I am not a monster. I just want justice and justice, I will get, one way or another. Actually, I think that they should consider themselves lucky that you are strong. You would not let me kill them. They should thank you and they will thank you, Draco. Mark my words."
However, Draco refuses to let Harry live in peace. When Harry is not in the gryffindor tower, he is being followed by Draco. By the time sun sets, Harry starts feeling that his life has become hell.
"You don't have to answer that. I'm sorry, dad. I'll just leave." Albus murmurs and walks out. He's followed by mom who looks tired and irritated but doesn't snap at him.
"We will leave this place then. It's not worth living. We can't live in muggle London until all the remaining death eaters are caught and sentenced."
She finishes her speech and then starts laughing. Draco smirks when Ginny's own brothers cast incarcarous on her and her eyes widen in shock. Suddenly, her entire family is standing in front of her, their wands pointed at her and she glares venomously at everyone.
Harry nodded and looked at his breakfast. Draco tried to control his breath because it felt that his throat was closing and his heart was beating too fast. British delegates were arriving and one of them could be his past client. He closed his eyes and covered his ears with his palms to keep the words and images out but they won't leave him alone.
He punched the wall in frustration. Draco did not want to step even a foot out of this place. For the millionth time, he cursed the bastards who had led to all this, to seven pits of hell.
His smile falls and jaw drops in shock when a familiar figure heads towards him. Her head is bowed and she is dressed in a red gown that accentuates her curves. Red danglers are donning her ears and even her nails are painted red. Her hair is as blonde and straight as it was in school.
"Firstly Harry is gay and secondly you accused Draco of wanting to hurt his husband. What else did you expect, eh?" Ron snapped at his wife and she muttered "All right then, men. They are lots of men, back in Britain who would want to marry Harry who would behave like decent human beings instead of animals."
The green eyed child becomes silent at Sirius's argument. It's very interesting to watch Harry think about another excuse. His eyes narrow in intense concentration for just a moment before he focuses back on Sirius.
"You – we should have seen a healer. I am such a stupid git. I should have asked you." Harry mumbled, alarmed when he finally noticed the damage. He had removed the concealing charms from his legs too and yes their were scars on his inner thighs as well. It was horrifying, infuriating and saddening that Harry had never bothered to ask Draco about the scars and he had never felt so very guilty in his life.
Two hours later, Severus finds himself, sitting with Black in his study. He had counted upon Black to deny but the woman had to go and agree to it. Only Lupin was against it and so the man had refused point blank to be even present. Severus agreed with the wolf.
Draco would have laughed aloud but all of a sudden, he was feeling an urge to clean his body thoroughly. He was feeling filth and grime all over himself and he answered bitterly "Just mind your own business, will you?"
She is always upto something, always on the move. The only time she is quiet is when she is sleeping and that happens only at night.
They believed what they wanted to. They saw what they wanted to. No-body dared to look beneath the surface. Maybe Dumbledore knew but then he just cared for the greater good. They believe that Riddle is dead. Voldemort is dead for sure but Riddle is very much alive. No-one knows that Riddle and Voldemort were two different beings and she was the one who had inadvertently helped Riddle. Lucius Malfoy was the one who started initiated everything. He used her innocence and love for himself and pushed her inside a pit so deep that she doesn't think she will ever get out of it.
James cuts him off with a calm, "- trained. I'm well trained. Dad was very paranoid when we were young."
"I - we were so inhumane to you Harry. You are my cousin, for gods sake and I despise myself for what I did. I told her a bit about how we treated you and she rarely ever speaks to me and on the top of everything she is a witch and I have no experience with it." Dudley stopped at this and looked at him earnestly "I can not begin to tell you how thankful I am to you."
"How do you know so much about his mind Draco?" The headmaster in question asks her, "Also was it you who had sent that potion to me. It removed the curse from my hand. I always thought that it was Severus."
"We scold him a little and take his toys away for some time. We give him more homework but that's it," Narcissa answered.
"None of your business." He answers coolly, "You've no right to pry into head auror Potter's memories."
Presently, Harry was in the library reading some books on duelling and Draco was in his room napping before lunch. He was glad that Harry had decided to open his own Duelling academy.
The small boy sits in front of her. Petunia's eyes flicker towards the blank faces of a blonde family standing behind Snape. They must be the Malfoys Lily ranted so much about.
When he had been little, he had dreamt that his relatives will be proud of him someday and it was as if a dream had come true.
His glass almost fell from his hands and Hermione and Ron gasped in astonishment because three familiar faces came towards them. He had stayed away from everyone for the past decade and so had his best friends. The reason was very simple. Weasley family and their school friends did not support their decision.
"Your father is an idiot. I asked him for his permission to date you. I wanted his blessings because I knew you would never go against his wishes and he refused. Had he accepted my request, this would never have happened. Now I don't know what to do. I can't see your pain but I can't heal it and I can't make it go away. " He doesn't know why he is confessing all this. Of course she won't believe him. Her own father betrayed her and Harry had merely been her nemesis.
"Draco." He whispers after sitting on the edge of the bed. She doesn't wake up. Instead, she starts shaking all over.
Slowly, Draco pulled back and breathed hard a few times, trying to gather himself. His eyes were desperate and completely mad and Harry did not know the reason. He wished he had spoken Draco about it.
"You forgot to hide it." Albus replies honestly because it's impossible to lie to dad. Dad always knows when you're lying and he hates being lied to.
"Get out of my room." He murmurs slowly and she snarls viciously, "Don't look at me like that Potter."
Draco stared at the spot Harry had just stood on wondering about the man. Each and every gesture of his dripped his love for Draco.
"Might as well call Granger." Draco sniggered, "Potter can't as much as breathe without her permission."
Draco had expected them to shout or scowl atleast but they did not utter a word, choosing to nod instead.
He stands beside it and flicks his hand. Suddenly their double bed transforms into two single beds and Draco is too stunned to even ask anything.
"Sometimes, when I am bathing. Sometimes when I close my eyes to sleep." Draco replied and Harry spoke "You could sleep with me, if you want."
She got out of her bed and tip toed towards her door. It won't do to alert the enemy that she had woken, that is, if someone
Harry has been trying to avoid thinking about what he saw ever since he stepped out of his bathroom but now Draco is sitting with him and Harry can practically imagine what must have happened after he left. Suddenly, the room seems too small and Harry can't breathe.
Lucius froze. His face became blank although his eyes betrayed his fear. Voldemort had always known that Lucius would never let Draco follow in his footsteps. So, it wasn't a surprise when the man said, "He's only a child, my lord. He doesn't mean to insult you."
What she does next is completely a shock. People like to romanticise everything which is why he thinks they like to believe that a veela shows her wings to her mate only. This he knows because Lily was a veela and veelas do not show their wings to just anyone because they know that a veela's wings are priceless potions ingredients. He has always been quite sure that Potter doesn't know that her mother was a veela. She had never seemed to like Delacour much which is why Potter's wings take him by surprise. They're magnificent and but then it's hardly a surprise. He eyes are hard and her lips are pinched in a straight line. Severus can imagine how hard it must have been for her to do this considering the fact that he's a potions master and was once a trained auror.
Harry was about to speak but Neville beat him to it "Malfoy, look, you should not create a scene over here. We can talk at your place."
That was the moment, he looked at the house. It was an absolute mess with clothes scattered all over the sitting room and it seemed that Harry had not got it cleaned at all.
"My daughter." She moans and slumps on the floor on her knees, sobbing frantically, "Draco. My daughter. Please save my daughter."
He tries to sleep but sleep eludes him. Draco's words replay over and over again in his mind, tormenting him to no end. The person he had been in love with had never existed. He doesn't know when the hours pass and sun rises. Morning dawns and sunlights streams inside through the windows and Harry finds himself still staring at the ceiling.
He knelt down weakly and hugged Draco from behind. "I am so sorry Draco. I am sorry for being late."
There it was. This was what Harry had been missing. Draco's eyes burned with fury and he hands clenched into fists.
This was the third time when Draco just stared at Harry in utter shock, standing in the middle of the room with the invitation in his hands. It was not Harry's fault because Draco did insult Harry by spying on him. Not even once, did Harry say so. He looked at him with apologetic eyes and Draco finally snapped at him "I am sorry for spying on you. Why are you not asking me to apologise too."
Mom's and uncle Severus's head snapped towards her. Aunt Sierra wasn't there at the moment. Nor was uncle Remus. She walked in and closed the door behind her before placing her wand and sword back. Mom was crying. Her hands were covering her face and her shoulders were quivering.
"Forgive me for wanting to love my husband Draco." Harry murmured, his voice low and controlled and his eyes boring into Draco's alarmed ones.
None of them noticed Harry until he raised his voice to get the way cleared for him. Ten years had elapsed and he had not forgiven Britain.
"Your cousin?" He asked and Harry nodded. He opened it quickly because Harry was eyeing it rather murderously.
To say that he was sad would be an understatement. He had not eaten anything even after Narcissa's requests. He had started respecting his wife during his sentence. She had been the only one with him and had not accused him even once.
Harry nodded and turned around to look at the gathered crowd. He spoke strongly "Kindly return to enjoying the party and give Draco and his family some privacy." He avoided his godparents who simply squeezed his shoulders and left him with a mumbled "Please meet us when you can find some time."
Harry covers his mouth and stifles his gasp and backs off quickly. Horrified to find that his eyes are damp, he heads towards his room wishing that Ron has slept. He stumbles a bit and takes support of the wall.
"Hello, mini Draco." Zabini grumbles. Scorpius stares at him. This is the first time Zabini has spoken directly with him. Zabini always avoids talking to Scorpius.
"Are you mad at me, uncle Severus? I read that book you gave to me." Harry asks, his face tilted up and his small hand still wrapped around Severus's larger one.
He hands over a bracelet to her. It's a simple bracelet. She puts it on her wrists and stares at him expectantly.
Suddenly, Harry is standing right next to Draco. Draco jumps in surprise. One minute he wasn't there and the other minute he was.
"I do trust you." Draco whispered and Harry stood up "You would tell me if you trusted me." Draco was about to stand but Harry snapped at him "Do eat your breakfast, Draco. You are already weak. I am coming with you, all right. Make of this what you wish."
"I told him that I was sorry and I begged him to help me. I begged him, though I had already tasted betrayal at his hands. I had no other alternative. He betrayed me again. He fucked me hard and rough and then he slapped me and gave me some money, saying that it was all I was worth. He had promised that he would get me some job if I let him fuck me. I had no other choice. No- other choice-" Harry felt tears well in his eyes and looked at Ron. Ron's eyes were wild and his face was completely white.
"It's not about scars. I don't have scars." She says in a small voice and tries to take her hand back. Albus holds it tightly.
Harriet did not reply. She kept on walking and took the right turn that led them straight to the staff room and then she stopped beside the door. She could not outrightly for their help without being forced to answer their questions but she could let them help her this way. She heard Zabini mutter that he would sit with the Weasleys. She stifled the urge to laugh. Zabini was a bi and she knew what his smirk meant and as amused as she was, she kept her face impassive. It became easier as the days passed by.
"Useless tantrums, my ruddy arse. You are my husband and I have a complete right to be here. I AM NOT LEAVING." Harry shouted and Draco shouted right back at me "GET OUT. I HAVE A MEETING TO ATTEND. You have no bloody right to ruin my meeting."
He had just placed one foot on the stair when his whole world just revolved around him.  His foot slipped and then everything just turned black.
"We are going out to shop today." The words have just escaped his mouth and Harriet is already jumping up and down in excitement.
Harry looked irritated but did not say anything to that instead of huffing " I wonder if you are channeling Dumbledore. Talking in riddles like him. "
"It's important." She says and he breathes again before gritting his teeth. He won't send her away not because he believes her but because she is Lily's daughter and as she is growing, she is starting to look like a carbon copy of her mother.
"The weather is quite nice Harry. Let's go to that garden today. It's quite beautiful outside. Ron and Draco have never seen it before." Hermione murmurs, her brown eyes warm and wet.
His voice broke off again when Harry knelt on his knees and started licking the whip marks on his stomach and legs with his tongue.
Harry nods and then speaks up softly, "You have the burning desire to sleep next to me. Are you sure?"
He hissed after a few seconds "I owled them so many times. I owled the whole weasley family and Longbottom sans Weasley, Granger and – and well, someone else. The replies that I got said that I deserved whatever I was getting. Tell me. How does a seventeen year old boy deserve to become a prostitute just because he does not have enough money?"
"Sirius." He whispered again and Sirius blinked before looking at him with an innocent smile, murmuring, "I was actually thinking of staying over here for a few days. I tried to rent an apartment but the good ones were not available."
Scorpius did look sick. Harry realised with a jerk that Malfoy was begging him - that he was a beggar. He studied the man's face and couldn't see any deception.
Draco turned to look at him and he almost staggered because Draco's face was red with fury. His silver eyes were burning and he was looking absolutely murderous.
Licking his lips, he cautiously touched Draco's shoulder with his fingers and waited for the man to snap at him. The reaction that he received was shocking. All of a sudden Draco turned around and jumped in his arms. Harry was surprised but wrapped his arms around Draco's waist willingly. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry as well and started sobbing in his neck.
"Fourteen years too late," She snorted bitterly before looking back at her papers. He frowned, staring at Blaise who was frowning too. Pansy was having her breakfast quietly, her novel spread open beside her plate.
"Eat a little. I will ask the elves to bring our dinner here." He presses softly and she looks at him.
"Then don't get caught. Anyways, I am giving you a portkey. As soon as you are alone with Draco tomorrow morning, activate it and it will take you straight to The three broomsticks. Do it tomorrow otherwise I am -"
Draco looks carefully at Severus. His eyes are slightly worried and Draco has a feeling that Severus is trying to say something, something that he isn't saying directly.
"Harry. Are you awake?" Harry yawned and opened his eyes sleepily "Now I am." Draco wanted to smile at Harry's pout. In some matters, Harry will never change. He was not a morning person and hated to be woken up early. Draco opened the curtains and asked "Will you come to the dining room for breakfast or should I bring it here?"
"I know, my son, that many a time in the past, I accused of being weak and I take my words back. You are the strongest person I have known, stronger than Albus Dumbledore himself. Dumbledore lost his sister and you tried to keep us alive and we know that it was the only reason you accepted the mark. You suffered those couple of years because of our sins, Draco. We were weak and could not see the true face of the dark lord. You saw it and bent your principles for our sake. Britain did not treat you like a human being and you are still serving them even if from a distance. A girl came to thank you today because your potions treated her magic and limping. A couple thanked us for giving birth to you. They say that your potion enabled them to have a child. Everyone is saying that I am lucky to have you as my son and I am lucky Draco. I am so lucky. Don't think that I do not know who is paying rent to our landlord or who is paying for our luxuries so that we can live in peace."
"I can't let you drown yourself in alcohol, Harry. That's just- how- how can you expect me to let you die?" She replied and abruptly stood up "I am sorry but you are forcing me to take the matters in my hands. I have let it go long enough. You would disapprove but you can disapprove all you want. I don't care."
"But you are my husband and you have a right to-" Draco whispered, his eyes on Harry's and Harry couldn't control a lone tear from slipping from his eye now. How should he tell Draco that he had to be cautious of the only man he loved, the only man he trusted.
"That is your headache, not mine. Theo has refused to play any part in this now and has vanished. Pansy is helping but Malfoy won't listen to her. He knows about her now. She is hiding. You are the only one who can do this."
"He's right." Aunt Sierra says, "Harriet, you haven't seen a harem. The Potters never had one. But I have and I know what goes inside those walls. It's a gilded cage and Lucius- he's James's age. It's disgusting."
"Headmaster Dumbledore, Malfoy says that we are not in our dimension anymore," Harriet says, finally turning to look at Dumbledore, "Surely, he's mistaken?"
"Potter, we talked about this." Snape murmurs and Harry breathes deeply, taking his fragrance in. His mouth waters.
"Yes Harry. You are going to start obsessing over Malfoy again, aren't you?" Hermione continues where her husband stops. She is irritated as well.
"Your game is over and if you want to live, you will come quietly with us." It is Ron who says it and Draco mutters, "It was quite impossible to believe that you were behind all this. All those years, when you pretended to be my friend, you were actually just biding your time."
Draco holds his breath, knowing that they're at a distance of only two feet. Any moment, they will turn around the corner and find him and then they will either kill him or take him to Burbage.
"I am so very sorry for making you think that I have a right to force myself upon you." Harry stopped because next came the words that were most difficult to utter but had to be said. Draco had to understand.
"Thank you Kreacher. You may go now." Harry said, already accoing his clothes to get ready as the elf bowed and vanished away.
Draco remains seated for a few minutes. He's sure that Severus will talk to Potter before leaving. He's curious and so he gets up and tiptoes towards the door.
"Where are the keys, Potter?" He asked. Harry wondered why the other man insisted on using his last name after all these years.
In the matter of seconds, Blinky had brought two buckets full of water and they poured the water on Draco's head. Draco screamed and cried and moaned and begged them to stop. Harry was trying to control himself. It was hard but he was trying.
Perhaps, he would make Draco realize that no one except him would be able to tolerate Harry's eccentricities and insecurities.
Harry would never let him go. He deserved to have a man who would be capable of giving every kind of happiness to him. But Harry would never agree, as long as Draco was alive. Harry deserved better.
Severus and Black are quiet and even Draco's quiet. He's only staring at Harry. Lucius wants to ask his son about his supposed hatred for 'stupid Potter' and 'stupid Potter's stupid green eyes'.
That was when he felt it. He felt Draco's magic enveloping him and he felt his legs lift and wrap around Draco's hips. Harry was shocked and turned on. Draco was bloody powerful and he was hard for Draco.
"Did you get her checked up by a healer after feeding her the potion?" Draco asked, still facing away from the man.
"I mean it Draco. Just stay out of Potter's way and go to sleep. You need rest." This being said, Severus stands up and heads back towards the door.
He stared at her and blinked hard and stared some more, trying to understand why his long lost best friend would try to harm anyone in this manner.
"This isn't about Ginny. It was her decision. She has her reasons. It's about Harry and the fact that you're the only one who can do this." Weasley mutters in an irritated voice.
"Ends justify the means. I just have to do this. Why don't you understand?" Potter exclaims. She seems desperate.
It was so bloody clear that Draco was trying to please him. The kiss was good and Harry loved every minute of it. It was not forced. Draco loved him and loved kissing him but right now Harry knew that fear was as much as the reason of this kiss as was desire. Draco's eyelids lowered and he changed his angle to get a better access to Harry's mouth and Harry started hating himself.
Harry hugged him back and when Draco pulled back, Harry's eyes were calm "I will have tea if you don't mind. I have not eaten anything so it would be nice to have something to eat as well."
"She is so unlike the Draco Malfoy we studied with. Something doesn't seem right. I tried to provoke her on multiple occasions but she won't break and then she simply started avoiding us. She started behaving as if we didn't exist at all. So we backed off. Nott is a powerful man and we didn't want to mess with him. Hermione was still studying and I had just opened my academy. We couldn't risk it and you were already so depressed that you won't talk to anyone." Ron finishes. He is frowning.
"Mr. Potter-Malfoy, you are way out of the line." Lucius spoke, looking into his eyes, his eyes still blank and unreadable.
"Harry, please. Be quiet." It was Narcissa who said this and Harry looked at before turning back to Lucius and continuing in a hard voice, "You are lucky that you have Draco as a son. He accomplished everything he wished. If you have any shame, you will come inside with your wife in fifteen minutes and talk to him. Why were you not here as soon as you got the news of this incident. Where were you? Everyone arrived except both of you and Sirius."
Each word that he uttered ignited the fire of revenge inside him. He vowed to find the real culprits and pay them.
"Harry, I want to go to that ministry function with you. It is day after tomorrow." Draco blurted and Merlin only knew why those words slipped his mouth but they did and Harry yawned "Okay. We are going shopping tomorrow after I have set everything in the duelling academy I want to start. I have no robes at all. I borrowed from Ron whenever I needed them."
Draco tried again when Harry did not speak "Should I bring something? Tea and biscuits, perhaps?" but Harry just shook his head again.
Draco continued, looking at the woman "I hid them well. I applied glamours and applied some cream when they hurt. I had painkillers. I never sought professional help."
"Maybe, we can do this later. I have some work," Potter said politely and this was the moment Draco reached the door of the great hall. He stood there and watched as Fred laughed before looking at Potter with a smile, "Awww, please, Harriet, let the poor bloke take the pictures."
"It doesn't matter right now and anyways he's no longer fit to be a king. He shouldn't have let his guard down. He should have known that our enemy is waiting for just a small chance. He risked everything because of some affair with you that he just imagined mom having." Harriet said and then closed her eyes.
Abruptly, Harry's voice became soft and dangerous "Do you know how it feels to watch your love, your life hang himself to death Draco? You don't because I have never attempted it. I also have my demons and I used to drink to forget them. The fear that someone would sneak inside my bath has never left me. The fear that someone might unlock my door and attempt to undress me has never left me but I stopped drinking because you did not want me to. I tried to find the strength to get over it in you, YOU BLOODY COWARD." Draco flinched when Harry shouted "YOU ARE MY LIFE, MY EVERYTHING. WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T TRUST ANYONE EXCEPT YOU. I NEVER HAVE AND I NEVER WILL."
"How can I help you?" The man -father said, his eyes narrowed sharply. Of course, he was noticing their resemblance now. After all, Draco looked a lot like his father.
After taking a couple of long breaths, he stood and climbed the stairs. He opened Draco's door a bit and peaked inside. Draco was already inside the blankets, though Harry knew that he was awake. Sighing, he closed the room and walked towards his own room. Five minutes later, he was in his bed, tossing and turning. He knew that he would not get much sleep anyways. He needed Draco beside him. Nevertheless he tried and closed his eyes to atleast try to have some sleep.
"You might be pregnant. Hermione asked me to look out for symptoms." He murmurs and Draco's heart sinks. She can't be pregnant with his child... NO!
After opening the front door, Harry summoned his biggest umbrella and walked down the path that his front garden had and out of the main gate and there, beside the dustbin were sitting two people - a child and a man and both had blonde hair. Their heads were bent and they were eating a dirty burger that they had obviously taken out of his dustbin. They were soaked.
Draco blinked hard to avoid the images that ran amok in his mind now. Brown eyes stared nervously at him. He would never forget them and he'll also never forget the humiliation he had suffered at this man's hands that night.
"I know you're there, you horrible woman," he sneered, annoyed and she revealed herself, pulling the blasted cloak off of her. She was wearing a scowl on her face but her cheekbones were slightly red. Her eyes were impossibly green and those denims fit her. She looked much better in muggle clothes.
Harry was looking at him and he walked towards the man's bed. Harry made space for him and he sat down beside Harry. For a few minutes, they just looked at each other.
"Aunt Petunia." He said and Dudley whispered "She has not spoken word since we uncovered dad's sins. This is the first time she has said a word."
It was Hermione who finally knocked on Harry's door. She smiled when she saw them together. She must have realized the truth when she saw Draco's eyes because her eyes shined and her lips upturned in a smile. Behind her, Ron breathed in relief and Harry wondered when they had started reading Draco so well. He wondered if Draco was surprised as well. He pulled back and saw Draco's eyebrows raised and realized that Draco was surprised as well.
After they separated and Harry finally realized his mistake, he wrote to Black, Lupin and him. Though he forgave Harry, Black and Lupin didn't, not completely atleast.
Snape thinks that it's because of her jealousy that she stayed away from Lily and maybe it was in the starting but she learned to live with it and at the end, she only wanted to reconcile with her sister. She was only afraid that Lily would never talk to her or forgive her and it's just that-
"Scorpius." Albus calls and the blonde looks at him and smiles lazily before asking, "What happened?"
"All this because I refused you to make love to me." Draco whispers. He isn't asking. He is damn sure that this is the reason.
Ten minutes had elapsed and he still couldn't think of anything. His tortured eyes turned towards the lone window of his lab and a third option came to his mind. There was only one way, only one.
"He might appear subdued to you but he is not. You are the only one in the whole world who can control his temper. You are the only one who can understand him. He is scared of losing you and does not want you to see his temper. " Severus answered and Harry cut him off " Their is something he is hiding. "
"I am going to give them a show, Tom. If you hadn't captured Draco, if you hadn't done what you did, I would have had mercy on you. I had originally planned to just cut your head off. Clean and simple. But now... I am going to make it messy and I am going to torture you till your last breath. You can reveal yourself Draco." the last words are muttered without even looking away from a very shocked and terrified looking dark lord.
"They did not monopolise me. They did not snatch me away from you, Draco." Harry whispered, keeping very still.
"We forced you to cook when you were small. Many a time, you burnt your little hands and I never paid attention to the fact that you needed comfort." She spoke and Harry stared at her and Dudley again. the man was looking silently at the table, looking lost and upset and aunt continued "Vernon said that Tessa knows everything and she does not trust anyone in this house at all. She does not speak to anyone because she thinks that we will hurt her like we hurt you."
Perhaps he expected Draco to pull away but Draco did not, even though his eyes welled by the sudden sting. Harry had bitten hard and he could taste his own blood. Abruptly Harry pulled and and eyed his lip and then he did the most surprising thing. His eyes softened a bit and he licked the blood.
"Do you trust her?" Draco asked and Harry nodded. "Will you remain with me during the check up?" Harry nodded again and Draco asked the last question "Will Weasley have to stay in the room as well?"
"I entered their house and called them. When no one answered, I just walked into their room. They were not there and the bathroom was open. I had never thought that-. Hermione they were naked and that's not why I am shaken. Draco accused me of fucking him. He accused me of betraying him. He said that I promised him a job if he let me fuck him and did not fulfil my promise. He says that he apologised to me and I did not listen to him, that I gave him cigarette burns. He says that he has hidden this secret from Harry because he did not want to lose Harry, because I am Harry's best friend. He says that I, along with you and someone else did something and that he begged me to help him but I abused him. Who could it be? He is still in trauma and I don't understand how he tolerated my presence of be was... was abused my me." Ron was staring at her with wide and concerned eyes.
"It's Potions Master Malfoy for you, Albus." Mr. Zabini says harshly. His eyes are steeled and his body is stiff with tension as he continues, "Do you even know the meaning of love. This is not love. What you are doing - wait a minute-"
"I should have backed off damnit, why don't you understand this?" Harry mutters, his hands on Draco's shoulders and his eyes still shining.
He shifted and lay on Harry's body, placing his chin on his chest and looking into his eyes. He bit Harry's cheeks lovingly and continued "I am afraid that you would do something illegal to avenge me. I know that you won't leave me."
He sniffs once and then looks at her, smiling softly, "Go to sleep. My room is the next one. Feel free to call me if you need anything."
Harry pulled back and Draco moaned from the loss of contact. But Harry unbuttoned his robe with gentle fingers and Draco shivered again. All the while Harry looked into his eyes and Draco's gaze did not waver. A second later his robe was on the floor and so was Harry's.
"I will send everyone away if you want but you have to understand that they need to know about this if Riddle is alive. We literally know nothing." He murmurs and waits for her response.
Snape smells nice although nowhere close to Malfoy but Harry is desperate. He doesn't wish to go to hunt.
Lucius stares at the gobsmacked face of his oldest friend. As far as Lucius knows, Severus has no child. Then -
"Say something," she murmurs, her wings stiff behind her back. Her entire frame is stiff as if she's planning to flee at a moment's notice.
"Castles do not get angry. Hogwarts is not sentient," Lavender muttered, confused, "Maybe, someone had tampered with the wards."
When Draco watches the door open and Ron enter with Fred and George, Draco barely stops himself from sighing in relief. They tip toe towards them, indicating the waiters and owner to stay quiet. By the time, Ron pokes his wand on Sirius's back, the game is over. Draco points his hands towards the man and stands up.
Draco's eyes widened in shock when he heard Harry's heartfelt words. He said softly "You were not the only one at fault. You have your own ghosts of past, Harry and I did not try to know. I was so engrossed in myself that I did not talk to you about you at all."
He would do anything to see Draco's eyes unclouded and happy for once. He would do anything to get rid of Draco's demons, to heal Draco but healing was a long and slow process and he would be patient with Draco. He repeated again "I do. I love you. I just want you to share with me. Tell me. What happened? Tell me everything. I just want you to relieve yourself off those demons. You know that I love you, don't you?"
He apparated and Ginny was left mumbling to herself that Harry loved her and would never hurt her, not when she had loved him even after marrying Neville.
Draco's eyes were full of desire and glee but there was a fake blush on his face as he faced Sirius. Harry's eyebrows rose in surprise when he saw Sirius's face. His hands were somewhere near his crotch but his face was white and his eyes were fearful.
"One word more and I will throw you out of this house. The only reason I have tolerated you is that you are his best friend and have supported him throughout his life. I respect you but you will not interfere between me and my husband." Draco whispered, glaring at Hermione and she muttered defensively "The divorce papers-"
They were moving photographs and Draco was bleeding and screaming hoarse in each of them. He was being fucked bareback in one of them and in one he was being fucked by a knife, Blood was trickling down his legs and his eyes welled.
It was a few minutes later that Draco finally relaxed and pulled a bit, keeping his ashamed eyes averted. However Harry held his chin in his hands and pulled it to face Draco's eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes and was about to throw it away when Harry spoke "Hey. What is it? It has ministry seal on it."
He held Harry's shoulder and Harry turned around, a smile on his face, longing gone. He wanted to hide it from Draco but Draco knew now. However, he did not say anything except "I have brought snacks. Where are Granger and Weasley?"
Draco nodded silently and replied "Take some rest. I will ask Kreacher to clean your night clothes and get tea and something to eat with it ready for you.
"It's-" Aunt Sierra cleared her throat and looked at Harriet with red cheeks, "It's not a sacrifice. I love him."
Harry took a step back, surprised. Malfoy did not recognise him which was absolutely absurd. Malfoy detested him - like really detested him and that hatred had only increased after Harry had defeated Voldemort.
"I have been trying to gain your trust. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to write in my blood that I love you, that I won't leave you, no matter what happens." Harry continued and Draco blinked hard.
'. Albus pours the contents in the pensieve with a sigh and inserts his head inside the silver memories.
"Hmmm." Draco answered while opening Harry's wardrobe to clean it. It was an absolute mess. He gathered the clothes in a pile to get them washed and started casting cleaning charms on the shelves.
"Mr. Mawfoy, I want to see your white peacocks and gardens." Little Harry says with a small pout of his own.
It was very obvious that Draco was uncomfortable and did not want this to continue but he also knew that he couldn't stop. Draco needed to stop Harry. Draco needed to realize that he did not have to rush, that he could set the pace and so Harry smiled and nodded.
"Okay. We will see you tomorrow mate." Ron murmurs and Hermione continues softly, "I will tell Narcissa that she is here. I will bring her tomorrow morning. I think she needs her mother."
"Stay in your limits Petunia. You don't want me turn your husband and son into elephants that they are. If I realize that you hit her, I-"
"I am tired." Draco whispered, looking deep into Harry's eyes. Harry nodded and spoke "Let me unlock the wards and you can take rest. You can talk to me about anything. I hope you know this."
"We'll keep him out of your way. Please, forgive him. He is only seven," Narcissa murmured, her eyes defiant, unlike her husband's terrified ones. It was more of an order than a request. Voldemort had no doubt that Narcissa was as mad as Bellatrix and their elder sister who ran off with a muggle. Madness ran in the blood of Blacks. He won't be surprised at all if she stood up and pointed a wand at his throat right now.
"Why did you do it, you brat?" He snaps at her and she grins, "Aunt Siri says that you look cute when you are startled."
"I was afraid. It's okay. It's past and I will never meet him again so it's fine. " Harry said and Draco argued " I will pay your uncle a visit though. "
"Want you so much. Want to tie your hands and ravish you. " Draco murmured and Harry's cock twitched.
Even though Narcissa's eyes watered and her cheeks stained with tears, her hands never stopped. She went on applying the ointment on Draco's neck and chest and hands. Then she kept the ointment on the bedside before getting up.
Why couldn't she mind her own business for once? What did she think he was upto now? In fact, he should be the one following her around, what with her strange behaviour. Why did she want to get back so desperately because Blaise was right, wasn't he? She didn't really have any job and her family was in the castle then why?
"His manor is warded. It's not a child's play. The horcruxes are destroyed but he is very powerful. He will need only a minute to call death eaters. You will need help. If he kills you, then no-one will be able to save Draco. He will turn her into a slave. He will destroy her. Do you want that?" Snape asks, his dark eyes boring into Harry's. His hands are digging in Harry's shoulders, compelling him to listen to the man. Harry realizes that he is breathing hard and that he is angry. He also realizes that his fingers are trembling.
Father finished his speech and Draco watched him walk down the dais. He was amazed because father's eyes were shining and he could read father very well. Before he could even attempt to do anything, people started clapping their hands and surrounded him. He heard Harry whisper in his ears "I am going to talk to your parents." He nodded and spoke to the press and people who surrounded him. Some of them thanked him and some of them wanted to purchase some potions from him. He gave his card to some and autographs to others.
Those people who fucked him ruthlessly and without preparation, who called him a cunt, a whore, a worthless, good for nothing slut went to there home, slept with there wives, played with there children.
He turned to look at Hermione. She stared at him, stunned for a couple of seconds before clearing his throat "Unfortunately, this is true but I am never biased with my patients, Harry. Believe me, I have realized my mistake as far as Draco is concerned. I will turn around Draco and you can just shift your trousers a bit so that I can check your hip area and when I will check your legs, I will cover your hips. I will cover your legs when I check your back and chest. I will wear gloves so you don't not need to worry. Harry can sit with you and hold your hands if that will comfort you."
"Hello, little girl." He said and Draco followed his example, kissing her right one and murmuring "Hello. Tessa."
However then Pansy murmurs, "Aguamenti" and a stream of cold water starts falling over his head. He screams and sits up, completely drenched in cold water. Blaise is leant against the wall, smirking at him, his arms crossed over his chest. Pansy is seated on Blaise's bed, examining the nails of her left hand, while her wand is in her right one.
After a silence of five minutes, Draco turned towards Harry and buried his face in his shoulders because Hermione was right. She was looking at Harry and he whispered, feeling grateful that she was trying to help "She is right. You need to heal. Do not feel sorry." They needed a healer's perspective.
"What area is affected?" Granger asked professionally and Draco's cheeks tinged red. Harry answered for him "His hips, inner thighs and legs."
Harry's lips interrupted his apology. Harry pressed Draco's hips and Draco moaned in Harry's mouth when their groins rubbed.
His evening plans with Ginny are ruined by the detention she has with professor McGonagal. So, Harry finds himself sitting across Ron and Hermione. Fire is burning in the fireplace. It's warm.
Lucius opens his mouth to deny the request because they don't allow anyone except Draco in the gardens. But then the green-eyed child steps away from Severus and stands in front of him. Lucius stares at him, expecting him to throw a fit like his son does. But the child only stands in front of Lucius with his hands joined in front of his legs and his eyes huge and very very green.
"Come closer Ms. Malfoy." He says and Draco obliges him. She stops when she is standing close to him. She is standing too close for comfort but she has no other choice.
"Yes." Draco snapped at the man. What were they not telling him. This case was not the sole reason for calling Draco back.
Finally Harry opened his eyes and blinked sleepily. Their eyes locked and Draco felt very possessive and protective for Harry all of a sudden.
"HARRRYYY." He shouted but got no answer so he tried again "Harry get up. You are kidding are you not? I know that I fucked up and I am sorry." He shook Harry's chest and whispered frantically "Harry please. Harry. I am so sorry. I will never repeat it again." But Harry did not answer. He lay their like a rag doll.
Half an hour later, they are ready and Draco presses a soft kiss on Harry's mouth before looking into his startled eyes quietly. He is actually relieved that they will be sleeping on separate beds until he wants otherwise and he is astonished that Harry actually decided to do this. He kisses Harry's forehead softly and embraces him.
Draco turned around and smiled at Harry. His smile faltered when he saw Harry's eyes. They were narrowed and they were burning. Something had happened and Harry was angry and Draco froze.
The door opens and it takes a moment to control his mounting fury because it's Potter and she is the last person he wants to see right now. She might be Hogwarts' most loved professor but she's still as annoying and reckless as she was ten years ago. He wants to yell at her for the simple reason that he is angry but he knows that he mustn't. There is no dark lord to hide behind now. There is no justification to snap at the woman now, especially since she is no longer his student. She is a colleague now.
This scene never fails to astound Sirius. That James's five year old child would bring a proud man like Severus to his knees is as surprising as it was when Harry had turned three and Severus had asked for the boy's permission for marrying Sirius.
Draco was still in pain and Harry had his ghosts which showed themselves sometimes through his nightmares but they had time and they would fight all their demons together.
"No, you don't. You go out with me because I'm more like dad than Albus." James says quietly, desperately.
Harry hugged him, cradling his face on his shoulders and Draco went willingly, trying to find peace in Harry's soft arms. It helped, if only a bit, to ease his pain.
Sirius had levitated James's body and placed it near Lily's and had sat beside the corpses with Harry in his arms. Severus had come few moments later and together they had buried Harry's parents and raised Harry. Remus had disappeared soon after the funeral. He had said that he couldn't look at Harry and not remember James and Lily.
"Bye, aunt Petunia. Bye, everyone," the seven year old boy's voice sharp enough that Voldemort who was hidden behind a tree that was just a bit away from the house heard the words clearly.
"I will call a couple of house elves from The Malfoy Manor to clean the washrooms. I could call them to clean the complete house if you like." Draco spoke and Harry denied "No. I would rather we do it ourselves so that we can throw the useless things away and so that we can change the furniture that we do not like. They can do the bathrooms though."
After a pause of a second or two, Draco continued disdainfully, "Where is Potter? As we all know, he's well known for taking rash decisions and getting people in danger, if my memory serves right. I would rather have a partner who's not the finest but but can follow my orders instead of one who hasn't taken a single prudent decision in his entire life."
"I can't be sure. All I know is that we are-" Draco paused when he heard voices. They were nearing the great hall. Headmaster's office was on the second floor and Draco was sure that he would want to call upon a meeting after Draco told him exactly what he had seen.
He takes her lower lip between his lips and sucks it. He tries to be as gentle as he can though the urge to pin her hands above her head is so strong that he almost does it - almost.
"Listen," she started, swallowing, "You will think that I'm mad but when I slept yesterday, it was 23rd August 2019 and you were five. It should be 24th August
"We are done." Harry says, takes a deep breath and continues in a hoarse voice, "You still have my protection but we're done."
"They did. You chose them over me. You always cancelled our dates for them. It was like I was not even important for you. You did not love me." Draco replied softly, his eyes still on Harry's chest.
"As if it needs to be said. I know that you won't. Okay I will sleep in your room. Just wake me up if you need help." Draco crossed his arms and Harry nodded "Thank you." Before lying on the bed to sleep again "I am sleeping. Good night."
Over the next week they fall into a rhythm or rather Draco does. Harry tries to bring her out of it. Try as he might, he can't.
"Honestly Draco, since when have you cared for opinions of others. I love you and you love me and rest of the world does not matter. I do not care about them." Harry replied and Draco glared at him "You did. You said that I insult you by spying on you and you wanted me to stop."
He just closed the fireplace off after taking the bloody portkey. It was in the shape of a coin and Sirius placed it on his table before laying down on the bed to go to sleep.
Only a second has passed although it seems that several hours have elapsed. She is on the verge of fleeing away. She is only a child and from what Albus told him, she is in trouble and he saved the world once. He can save a child even if she has the eyes of the man he hated and killed.
He walked very slowly towards the bed and crawled upon it. After straddling Draco's legs, he unbuttoned Draco's trousers and then unzipped them. That was when Draco choked out "Stop. Stop. Please." And looked at him.
"Yes." He says, not just because his son'll benefit from this but because he really wants everyone to know how wonderful and intelligent this child is. It's difficult to decide whether he would land in Gryffindor or in Slytherin.
"I missed you so much Draco. Please come back. Please. I need you so badly. Everything is just so-" Harry's voice broke and Draco felt a lump in his throat. Why was love so strange? Harry's pain hurt him so much "-so empty with you. Everything is over. My duelling career, my life. I don't want anybody except you. I don't desire anything but your presence Draco. Please come back. What is the point of earning money if I don't have you with me?  I am sorry for being immature. I am sorry for not understanding you. I am sorry for not caring enough."
"Draco-" Harry was about to explain but everything happened too fast. Draco was beside him within a second and Ron and Hermione backed off a bit. Harry did not have to wonder the cause of their backing off for long because the next thing Draco did was shout "You bloody bigots, you bastards, you have the audacity to come in front of me when I warned you at the last ministry event."
"It doesn't matter. I just want you to be well. Are you well?" He says. He is not making it up. This is the only thing he wishes. He just wants her to be happy and well.
"Yes," She said blandly, her eyes cold and hard as she gazed at Blaise and then at Draco. She did not look at Pansy who was ignoring the entire conversation. This was something she did because she did not want to get involved with anything related to the golden trio. She said that they just attracted trouble.
Draco wanted to kill Weasley. He wanted to finish him off so that he would never be able to destroy him again, so that he can never snatch Harry away from him.
"Tell me." She murmured. Half an hour had elapsed since he had left for Harry's house. What could go wrong in half an hour? Finally Ron started, his hand on her's.
Harry apparates in front of his house in Godric's hollow and takes a long breath. Finally, he is home. He has been trying to escape the media and the general wizarding population for the past two hours. He knocks on the door and Hermione opens it. Her red-rimmed eyes suggest that she has been crying for a long time.
"Potter." Snape snaps at him and Harry ignores the man. He ignores everyone in the room or in the house. He walks towards Sirius's room. He is sure that his godfather is still sleeping. He knocks it before entering. To his surprise, Sirius is having breakfast with Remus.
He sighs on realizing that it's after curfew. The castle is huge and devoid of the only person Harry is still attending this school for. Were it not for Draco, he would have fled away from this mess, this unending war between right and wrong. His parents died long back and took Harry's childhood with them. He never knew them and he will never know them. The people he does know don't care enough for him. Sirius prioritized revenge over Harry. Remus didn't care enough to come out of his shell and look for Harry and Snape decided to believe what he wanted to.
"Shhhh. Don't shout." The voice belongs to Weasley. They are in their late thirties and one would think that Weasley would finally bury the hatchet but one would be wrong because Weasley will continue despising Draco even after he dies.
On the other hand, Harry was prioritising Draco's past struggles to his and Draco was looking subdued and his eyes were distant and had a little terror in them.
It was Harry who broke the uncomfortable silence "Ummm, we can just see another healer. Hermione will be biased with your case, Draco. She has never been fond of you."
Harry was busy brooding about his friends's strange reactions but Draco was not. He noticed that Sirius was still outside the door, listening and Hermione was trying to convey something to him through her eyes. Ron's eyes were not angry. They were just sad though his face was red as he shouted loudly, "Let's leave them Hermione. They are assholes and I do not want to see their faces anymore."
"He will understand. Half of the population hated him for having that scar on his face and the other half fawned over him. He is not like others. Talk to him. You have to talk to someone." Albus insists.
"Take your time. Please trust me. I will never despise you. I love you. will you trust me not to despise you at least? "
It took only five minutes to reach the park. It was beautiful and quite large with jogging grounds and swings for children and ample of space for working out. After doing a few stretching exercises, he started jogging and while he jogged, he looked back on the past. If there was one good decision that father took, it was making Severus his godfather. After leaving
She hopes she gets a role in his upcoming movie. The audition starts in ten minutes. She was so nervous that she arrived an entire hour early. What little money mom gave her before father asked her to leave is running out. Acting wasn't her first choice of work but she only just graduated a year ago and was pursuing her potions mastery when father kicked her out. She needs money to study and has no source of income. This was the first thing that came to her mind. This is her seventh audition and she is frightened. James Potter detests father. She is afraid he will reject her as soon as his eyes fall upon her. She wishes she could just apologize for whatever father did to hurt him and she would if she knew what it was that father really did.
All Draco could do was stare at Harry for the next couple of seconds. Harry's wrist started bleeding profusely.
"I tried to repress your magic and never knew that Dudley was a wizard as well. I hated a child, an innocent child and god punished me through my own son and granddaughter." She spoke and fell on his knees. Finally, Harry came out of his shocked stupor and cast a quick reparo through a flick of his hand. The cup, as good as new, flew on the table and Harry walked towards his aunt.
"I want to help you-" Harry started and Draco cut him off "I want you to take rest. I will wake you up. Please sleep."
"Ah!," Lucius said, frowning at him whereas Narcissa leaned back, his eyes very cautious and narrowed. His lips were pressed in a thin line.
"Look at me like you usually do." She mutters sharply and he still doesn't understand. He is looking at her like he always does.
"Do you want to have dinner out today? It has been a while." Harry asked and a shiver crawled up Draco's spine. He did not answer because he did not want to refuse but he couldn't accept going out just yet. The risk was very big.
Draco sneered, "I bet he cheated. That man is all muscle and no brain. I bet Ginevra and Granger were fed up of his stupidity. He wouldn't have lasted a day in school without Granger's or Dumbledore's help."
Harriet was suddenly turned around with two firm hands on her shoulders. She came face to face with uncle Severus.
"And now, Draco." Harry spoke very softly. Draco had been quiet so far because Harry had been right. But now, he was worried so he tried to walk towards Harry "Harry, what-"
Harry doesn't answer. He simply looks at Draco for a few minutes before pulling away and getting out of the bed.
"I don't understand. What's happening? Are they blind? I mean- atleast Granger used to have brains. Longbottoms, Finnigans, Smiths, Weasleys and so many others have started addressing him as their lord and Potter's here, hiding while another war is brewing, thanks to Burbage." Draco's voice is almost frantic by the time he finishes and Severus only looks at him with his annoyingly cool eyes and a raised eyebrow.
"Ah! But I do need to bother him." She mutters and settles on the sofa, "Blaise! Look who has come to meet us."
Harry woke up before Draco the following day and blinked a couple of times before wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. After a couple of minutes, he opened his eyes and sat up. With a jolt, he reminisced everything that had happened the previous night. Instantly, shame overcame him and he stared at the opposite wall.
He knew that he would go insane without Harry. As he saw Harry's blood around them, he already felt his sanity slipping.
"It wasn't me. I- it must have been someone else polyjuiced as me." He stutters but his body is trembling and his eyes are still terrified.
"Save me the bullshit, Mrs. Malfoy. I am anyways leaving. Go and talk to your coward of a son." Draco practically jumped in shock when Harry barked at him, "Have some decency to dress properly in front of your parents at least. You are not a bloody child."
He placed the tray on the table and sat beside him. This surprised Draco. In the past, Harry used to sit across him.
"Draco. You know that I love you more than anyone else. I won't leave you, no matter what." He whispered soothingly and Draco turned around finally to look at him. His eyes were desperate and he was silent. Harry looked into his silver eyes and realized another thing that had confused him for the past few days. Draco needed constant reassurances that Harry won't leave him, that Harry loved him and now when he looked into his husband's soft but desperate eyes, he understood the depth of that insecurity. If Draco needed a reassurance, Harry would say it again. He would say it hundred times, if required, if it gave Draco even an ounce of peace.
"I know," said Scorpius, sitting beside him on the front bench of the classroom, "We can't do anything about it."
"Draco. Please. He will leave and I want you to stop." It was Harry who had whispered this. Harry who was tolerating his madness, though he deserved better. Harry was so sweet and patient and loved him so much.
"Hermione." Draco whispered and Hermione's wand pointed at him as she snarled, "I am sure you have fed all this crap to him. He would never think so about Ginny."
Only when he was standing directly in front of his useless relatives, did he cross his arms and start speaking "You pathetic excuse for a father. You do not deserve to have a daughter or a cousin. You do not deserve anything. Yet your daughter is sitting beside you. She is disgusted with you because you didn't do a thing to save Harry and then you did not even notice that your daughter was being tortured. She has bloody lived in a constant terror. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT IS IT TO LIVE IN FEAR THAT ONE DAY SOMEONE MIGHT-" Draco stopped over here and started breathing heard. His chest was heaving and his hands were trembling slightly.
"Hey, Malfoy. Wait." Scorpius looks towards his side to find James Potter heading in his direction. He his dressed in dark blue denims and a white shirt and his hair is as messy as Mr. Potter's. Most of the people say that Albus is the one who resembles Mr. Potter the most. However, Scorpius thinks otherwise. James Potter is more like his father then Albus. He's just a bit misunderstood.
Yes, he had planned to let Harry go but Harry did not want to go and they were finally starting to understand each other.
"Malfoy." A blank voice calls him and turns Draco's world upside down because the voice belongs to Harry sodding Potter who's supposed to be dead. He doesn't know what actually happened. Unlike Draco, Potter became an auror straight after graduating. Everyone was very tight-lipped and even Skeeter didn't publish anything useful. All that the general population including Draco knew was that Potter had lost control over his magic during an assignment and had blown an entire village. It was a small village but the explosion had led to deaths of several muggles and had gravely injured many others. Somehow, his partner had escaped unscathed. Draco doesn't remember who Potter's partner was. Consequently, Potter's wand was snapped and he was banished from wizarding world. It had happened a decade ago.
"Draco, I am sorry." Father says. The man has the audacity to say sorry as if three words can eliminate her filth, her shame, her pain.
Harry whistles as he walks inside the building. He is happy that he has finally decided not to become an actor. It's nice to not be confused for once. He heads straight towards dad's office, ignoring the secretary's soft, "An audition is going on."
After five minutes, he heard a mumbled "I hear voices and feel hands all over me sometimes." And he froze. It was so difficult to control his urge to take Draco in his arms and to never let him go. This was crucial because Draco had never shared this with him. He needed Draco to trust him so he nodded "When do you feel them?" He ensured that his voice was blank. Draco would react very negatively to sympathy or pity or to anything akin to it.
His eyes darkened with fury and fear and he hissed, "Leave me alone. I will have no hand in all this anymore. I had never wanted to help you. You brainwashed me. You-"
She couldn't breathe properly. It was like everything stank - the carpet, curtains, furniture and even her clothes.
"Of course not, Draco." Harry spoke, wrapping Draco in his arms. "You will never have to do anything that gives you pain or tortures you. You can count on me. I will always give priority to your welfare."
After a few moments, James sighs and turns his face back towards Scorpius. People often say that Albus's eyes are exactly like Mr. Potter's. However, where Mr. Potter's and James's eyes are emerald green, Albus's eyes are a darker shade of green.
" Mate she is right. Don't tell us if your don't wish to but we have to talk if you and Malfoy are resorting to killing yourself now. " Ron said and someone knocked the door which prevented them from saying anything else.
"Harry." For a few moments, he was confused as to who would call his name. The voice was not recognizable at all. He turned around and his cup almost fell from his hand when he saw his aunt Petunia standing at a few feet from him. He turned to look at Dudley but the man was literally gaping at his mum.
Harry just stared at the man incredulously "I will just order more. You are wasting your bloody time." He mocked and Draco looked at him with his eyes narrowed.
"I was only trying to find a bathroom that would open. Does that relieve your mind, oh girl-who-lived-to-be-nuisance," he snapped at her.
"She is done, isn't she dad?" He asks sharply. Dad is a good man and he would never take advantage of someone and Harry trusts him implicitly but right now he just has a very strong feeling.
Unable to sleep he sat straight on the bed and accioed his potion books. A knock on the door startled him and he spoke "Enter."
"No. Please have mercy. Please." Tracey Davis, an seventh year Slytherin pleads as she is dragged by a couple of blank faced aurors. Her hands are secured by handcuffs and she is crying. She is literally crying. Tears are sliding down her cheeks as she screams and cries loudly to be spared because she hasn't done anything wrong. Harriet follows them, hidden underneath her cloak. They are not alone. Oh no. There are professors and other students. They are just standing there, staring at her being dragged away. The only crime she has committed is that she is a veela.
