I know I’m gaping like a fish out of water, do I care? Yes. Can I move my face muscles to change that? No, I’m too shocked.
Draco froze. “No.”
“Yeah, so we went mad looking for the damn thing all around Diagon Alley because it was sold-out everywhere and then we finally found it and she went on and on for weeks about the quality and the sustainability of the brand and the texture of the thing or something else. In short, she loved it.”
“It’s just …  I heard some noise coming from your apartment a-and I … I wanted to know if everything was alright?” he tried.
There is no mistaking his expression, I’ve seen it before, on the face of my past lovers, it’s heat, hunger, desire. It’s undisguised want, pure lust.
He lost himself in the recounting of the actions, momentarily forgetting about the noisy man next door, when-
“Tell me, Marchbanks,” inquired Draco with a slight smile “saved any cat from a tree lately? Helped old ladies cross the street? Found the socks missing from the washing machine? No… wait, don’t tell me, you chased away the monsters under the bed of London’s children.” The smirk Draco was sporting was borderline evil and was only encouraged by Marchbanks’ angry blush.
Malfoy’s attention went back to the football match, but Harry’s stayed on Malfoy.
Malfoy must have known that arguing with Harry when he wanted something was a losing battle and with a reluctant sigh, answered his question.
Just as I say this, Py, probably cross by the lack of pets from Potter, sways his fluffy tail in the air, smacking Potter right in the face and then walks away towards the kitchen.
I raise an eyebrow “Yes, but how do you know that?”
Just when Draco thought someone would have to break the silence and the mounting tension in the room, the doors to the bullpen opened to let in none other than Hermione Granger-Weasley, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic, whose office was at the end of the corridor, right after the Auror Department. She was wearing the black robes of the Wizengamot, the soft fabric hugging her small frame, enhancing her gentle curves. Her hair, which had been so unruly during her school years, had been pulled up and tied in a severe bun on top of her head, light makeup on her face completed the look. All in all, Hermione Granger-Weasley gave out an air of importance and power and everyone in the Ministry knew she was a formidable woman.
He looks good when he laughs. I find myself smiling at the sight and I immediately blush. Merlin I’m so easily embarrassed by my own actions.
They lay embraced in bed for a bit, both thinking at the life that they were leaving and the one they were going to start, back where everything had begun, but this time on the same side, with no prejudice, no hate, no war or house colours.
Unable to keep the serious expressions while talking about shagging behind tapestry-covered alcoves any longer they both burst out laughing and kept laughing until they had tears streaming down their cheeks, at which point they managed to stop and take in huge gulps of much needed air.
As we kiss, I push my hips down, rubbing Potter’s hardness against my crack and he moans into my mouth, I swallow the sound and start grinding on him. My cock jerks, newly interested and I move with more vigour against Potter’s body, binging our erections together and feeling them glide on each other. The first touch of our arousals has us both gasping, but it’s not enough. After Potter’s skilful rimming and fingering, I’m deliciously stretched, but disturbingly empty. Luckily for me, there’s a simple solution to my affliction.
He raised a perfectly manicured eyebrow and smirked at Robards.
Harry happily obliged, curious to see what Draco had in store for him.
Without breaking the kiss, Harry moved to straddle Draco, the other man made a sound of agreement and brought his arms around Harry’s waist while Harry used his to start undoing Draco’s shirt buttons. He needed more contact. He needed the man out of his clothes.
Let me know in the comments what you think of this story. Did you like it? Do you think that writing in first person added something to the story? Would you like to read more about it or should I end it here?
I frown. “That rag? No thank you. Why?”
Draco did the same thing Harry had done to him before, starting from Harry’s neck and going downwards, leaving behind wet traces of saliva and dark love-bites. He paid special attention to Harry’s Horcrux scar and the jagged line the second killing curse had left just above his heart.
Harry felt his cock twitch and start to fill again, which shocked him a bit, so soon after the previous mind-blowing orgasm, he usually needed more time to recover, but this was Draco Malfoy and months of sexual frustration needed to be relieved.
Draco kissed him for a few moments before murmuring “Turn around” against Harry’s lips.
I run a hand through his sweaty dark hair and he leans into the touch like a snuggly cat, eyes closed and lips parted in a contented sigh.
“Merlin Draco, I’m going to cum. God Draco!”
Potter suddenly pushes me away, but just enough to look me in the eyes, I take in his appearance, his blown pupils, flushed skin, dishevelled hair, ragged breathing. He’s so fucking hot.
Harry didn’t realize he’d started crying until he felt Draco’s hand on his face, wiping down salty water from his cheeks. He started sobbing and Draco placed his arms around Harry’s torso, holding tight. Harry didn’t deserve to be comforted, he should have been rejected, insulted, cursed back for what he had done, instead, Draco was trying to soothe him, reassuring him that everything was alright with light caresses and soft kisses. His mouth voiced words of acceptance and forgiveness, helping to ease Harry’s burden.
Potter stands next to my queen-sized bed and I am amazed by how at ease he looks in my room.
Satisfied with his work, Harry made his way down Draco’s abdomen, placing kisses along the silvery scars littering his skin in crisscross patterns.
We land in my living room and we are greeted by my fucker of a cat hissing at us.
Draco’s cock was flushed a pretty pink, with the head an angry red, it was about as long as Harry’s, but slimmer and slightly curved to the right. It was beautiful and Harry’s to worship.
Both Draco and Harry had been restless, they knew that if they could get inside, the information they would gather could be essential to closing the case, and they had hardly managed to keep their covers and not barge in wands blazing.
There he was, usual snarky Malfoy. Harry couldn’t help but grin, though he must have looked stupid in that moment. He didn’t care.
“Say what? The truth?” he challenged. “Because we all know it’s the truth. Your actions have brought not only your best Auror, but the best Auror the DMLE has seen in probably centuries, to resign because he couldn’t stand your overbearing and frankly too strict application of the rules.
“Ah yes. Well you see, the wards were first implemented in the Middle Ages, when the new building of the Ministry was built, they had originally meant to place them only around the holding cells and the courtrooms, basically where criminals were supposed to be wandering the Ministry, but after one too many escapes in which a felon had gotten hold of a wand and made a run for freedom, they decided to completely engulf the Ministry in a bubble of anti-apparition wards. You can find more about the story in the library, check the book
“Use your words
Draco started blabbering when about half of his cock was in Harry’s mouth, it was a jumble of curses, high-pitched moans, half-sobs and gasps and Harry absolutely loved it, but it wasn’t enough.
They stayed in a heap on the floor as they both caught their breaths and when Draco looked up at his fiancé, he smiled at the goofy and sated smile he was sporting.
And his lips are touching the place where mine were, just moments ago, I try not to swoon.
The fact that Harry had decided to quit now, in May, just gave them more time to relax and Draco was more than happy to close this chapter of his life and start a new one.
It had been just after a very dangerous raid, they had both almost been killed and had barely managed to get a hold of the situation before it could degenerate further. They had been both covered in bruises, cuts and blood and had collapsed on Potter’s couch to rest for a bit before tending to their injuries. Harry had turned to look at Draco, making sure that the blond wasn’t in urgent need of care.
When my neck is thoroughly littered in what I know tomorrow will be a ton of purple bruises, Potter starts descending along my body, biting at my collarbones and then paying attention to my nipples. Potter’s mouth is hot and wet on my heated skin and his tongue licks and circles my right nipple while his hand plays with the left one. I throw my head back on the pillow and moan as he closes his mouth around the pebbled skin and sucks.
As he went down, he paid special attention to Draco’s nipples, making the man shudder with soft kisses and moan with bites and licks. He went on only when each nipple was hard and glistening with saliva.
“God Draco.”
“Yes.”
The first time Harry had seen the scars it had been maybe a year before they’d started dating. Back from a particularly gruesome raid, they had decided to spend the night drinking and trying to forget the horrible things they had witnessed. Back at Harry’s place Draco had taken a shower to get rid of the grime of the workday and had foolishly forgotten to bring a change of clothes with him, which was why a few minutes later he’d walked into Harry’s bedroom with a towel wrapped around his hips, asking for something he could borrow.
He looked up to meet dazed grey eyes, shining with affection and encouragement.
“But Malfoy, we need you here! You are not as negligent as Potter is, you know the rules and you follow them if Potter doesn’t force you not to.” Robards was pleading now, which Draco would have enjoyed greatly in any other occasion.
It’s not usually this visible, in the months immediately after snake-face’s death, the mark faded to a thin white scar that almost totally blends with my unusually pale complexion, but under the strobe lights of the club, the glossy scar tissue is put in stark contrast to the smooth skin of my forearm. The muggles like it, they think it’s ‘dope’ whatever that might mean. I’m not exactly ashamed of it, not anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I still hate everything it represents, but if aging has thought me anything, is that you need to learn to live with your mistakes, if you don’t want them to be your demise. Still, the first time a bloke started licking it, I freaked out and ran for the hills, I’m still not completely comfortable with having attention brought to it, I usually try to keep it covered, I never go out with my arms bare, except for the club, here it’s too hot for long sleeves or jackets, unfortunately, it’s also the place where it stands out the most. Nothing I can do about it though, glamours are useless against a scar made with dark magic, only dark magic can counter dark magic, and I’ve sworn I’ll never ever use it again in my life. The mark is a punishment, a constant reminder of who I’ve been and who I want, no, need to be, it’ll stay with me until the end.
“Beer?”
And Merlin, I want him to.
your clothes?” I manage to bit out eventually.
Harry yanked him upwards and crushed their lips together, slipping his tongue in the other man’s mouth and tasting himself.
God I’m reminiscing. Yep, I’m a sad drunk, though I’m not drunk yet, I’ve only had one drink in the hour I’ve been here, it usually takes me at least four to start with the melancholy, today it must be a mix of alcohol, tiredness and my usual gloomy aura, not a great combination if you ask me, not that you would.
The room filled with chuckles as Marchbanks scowled. Draco oh so loved getting back at him for all the times he’d snitched on them to their boss.
His expression darkens “Don’t you dare. That ass is mine.” He states with such conviction that my hole clenches on its own at being so possessively claimed.
As soon as we’re inside the door, Potter slams it shut and pushes me against it, my back hits the door hard, but I don’t feel any pain as I’m too focused on Potter, his mouth on mine, his hands holding me still, one of his thighs between my legs, rubbing against my hardness in the most delicious way.
Coming in contact with the past so suddenly and especially this way, is a shock to my system, my brain stops working for several moments trying to get around to what my eyes are seeing. I must stay stuck in the loop for a while, because the next time my eyes focus, they are still trapped in place by vibrant green eyes, but these eyes are bigger and much,
Why am I in a muggle gay club? Easy, Pansy fucking Parkinson.
After the war he had vowed to change his views on blood purity and all that racist bullshit and he was fairly proud to say that he had been successful, but although he didn’t have the same beliefs about muggles and muggleborns that had been instilled in him since infancy anymore, all his mannerisms had stayed, sarcasm and snide remarks were still part of his defence mechanisms and he could admit that sometimes he still found himself unconsciously slipping in that fabricated persona he had inhabited for most of his life, though the insults and derogatory terms weren’t there anymore.
He felt Harry gradually relax as he spoke, the tension in his back ebbing away as he leaned against Draco’s chest.
Yes, Draco could confirm or deny each and every rumor about Harry, because he knew him that well and he knew that Harry, given the chance, would make the best Head Auror history had ever seen.
Normally, the case would have been handled by a couple of Senior Aurors, but after the media coverage that had heavily implied that the Ministry wasn’t doing enough and had sent the public into panic and the Heads of the Departments into a tizzy, Gawain Robards, current Head Auror, had decided to assign the case to his two Deputy Heads.
I still can’t believe I’m talking to Harry Potter.
But still, here I am, sitting in a club, staring at people dancing and having fun while wallowing in my misery. It’s not like I don’t have options, I’ve noticed at least six guys looking at me with hungry eyes, but they all had something wrong. Too short, too pale, too blond, to skinny, … you get the idea.
“Thanks Malfoy.” He smirked back at the lust-filled look he received from the blond. “I guess I won’t need it anymore, will I?” there was a mischievous spark behind those bottle green eyes and Draco knew he was going to do something dramatic.
“Why Py?” he asks between coos at the cat.
He didn’t wait for a response from Draco before wrapping his arms around the blond and apparating them directly on their bed. Draco yelped at the squeezing sensation but any complaint got lost in the moans he let out as Harry worked his magic on him.
“And again and again.” Agreed Draco.
I shake my head. “It’s not irony Potter, it’s insanity. You can have, well, everyone really, you’re Harry fucking Potter, there must be someone for you in the magical world, someone you won’t have to hide a side of yourself from.”
Forcing his throat to relax, he slowly descended on the considerable length, while one of his hands came up to fondle Harry’s balls and perineum.
“If you must know, I was watching football, nothing dangerous for you to run in and save the day.” He said tersely, moving to close the door, but Harry’s foot stopped it from moving.
“Why are you?”
“Harry stop, I was teasing. You didn’t do anything that I didn’t approve of, on the contrary, you gave me the chance to finally tell Robards what I think of his leadership and his treatment of us. It was quite amusing to see him pale dramatically when he understood that he’d lost both Deputy Heads and you should have seen his face when I took out the ring. Just priceless.”
I sit up, ending all contacts between our bodies, but just long enough to position my ass directly above Potter’s erection, which I take in my hand and point at my hole. Potter’s hand on my waist stops me and I look at him in silent question, a wave of his hand and my insides shudder after a well placed lubricating charm. I shiver at the slightly cold feeling, but I smile at him gratefully, trying not to blush too much and drool at the casual display of wandless magic.
I watch as his mouth drops open and his eyes widen.
Much too soon he found himself on the verge of coming, Draco right behind him, judging from the quickening in his breath and the faltering of his thrusts.
This night has been one of the best of my life and I owe it to Pansy for making me go out.
He had been so used to his Sectumsempra scars that he hadn’t even thought about them when he’d decided to walk around shirtless, they were part of him as much as his mark was or any other scar he had acquired on the job, they told the story of who he was, mistakes and all, a boy who had started on the wrong path but had managed to turn around and make a fine man out of himself, he was proud of his scars in a way, they reminded him of just how far he had come from the scared and helpless boy who had tried to crucio an innocent student in a bathroom.
The night after the raid, Harry had looked at Draco with the same soft smile, eyes filled with love.
?” he asked with innocent eyes.
“But, isn’t she the manager of a cosmetic brand?”
“Potter.” yes, much better. “What are you doing here?”
I hum. “She did, I think her exact words were ‘
“You know what?” he said almost colloquially “Don’t bother with second chances.”
Harry bent down to trace each white line with his mouth, kissing, licking, biting, slowly washing away years of guilt and pain and replacing them with love.
“I bet you’ll be happy to get rid of the Death Eater, won’t you Robards?”
“If you are not an Auror anymore, Potter” Robarts seemed to have found his voice again “you are not allowed to use a wand in the DMLE. As per
Harry stood up, placed his hands on either side of Draco’s face and leaned over, whispering in his ear.
Harry shrugged and smiled.
Meanwhile, in the other room, a football match had ended, but no one had noticed, another kind of night match had taken place, one far more pleasurable and possibly the start of something special.
So here I am, because Pansy Parkinson is not a witch you want to disappoint. Ever. I learnt that the hard way, I’m not keen on repeating the experience.
When he felt Draco’s tongue on his hole, massaging the tight pucker with precise licks and soft kisses, Harry buried his face in the pillow as his arms gave way, swallowing the moan that had threatened to escape.
I snort at Potter’s inability to maintain minimal information about makeup.
Wrong move.
I deepthroat him for as long as I can, the spasms of my throat massaging Potter’s cock as his pubes tickle my nose, I use one hand to fondle his balls, earning a curse from Potter. When I feel almost light-headed from lack of oxygen and tears start to appear at the corners of my eyes, I look up at Potter and swallow one last time around his member, it’s enough to undo him completely and he comes down my throat with a yell.
They had done a good job too, Draco, being the resident potions expert, had provided quite a lot of insights on possible base locations and new treatments for the coma patients and Harry, always the most practical one, had led multiple successful raids, collecting substantial evidence and arresting a few minor dealers.
Both Draco and Harry had been removed from the serial murders they had been investigating and had been ordered to focus entirely on the potions case. They had been a bit miffed about it, in their opinion, people getting killed should have the priority over illegal drugs, and removing both Deputy Head Aurors from an active case of that relevance didn’t seem like a good move, but they couldn’t contradict a direct order from their boss, so they had left their files to another pair of Aurors and had gotten to work.
Robards bristled. “
“You’re absolutely right Hermione, as always, we’ll be there and we’ll bring dessert.” Draco stated without even having to look at Harry to know that he was nodding along with his words, both men dutifully chastised.
Harry would do something exceptionally risky, like running without backup in the middle of a fight, and successfully carry out his mission, only to come back to Headquarters and having to hear the hour-long dressing-down the Head Auror always bestowed upon him about regulations, code of conduct and proper behaviour.
In the years after the war, Malfoy had lost most of his pointiness, developing into a mask of aristocratic beauty with high cheekbones, sharp grey eyes with pale lashes a mile long and prefect rosy plump lips. The almost feminine appearance was completed by long pale blond hair that Malfoy had let grow past his shoulders and that he usually kept tied in a high bun on top of his head, Harry presumed it was to keep the strands out of his eyes while he worked. Now though, it was draped loosely on his shoulders, enclosing his face in a golden halo, making him look even more ethereal than usual. And ok, Harry may have exaggerated a bit and his perception of Malfoy may have been a bit biased by the big ass crush he had on the blond, but he was still inside his own mind and, although his Occlumency hadn’t improved much during the years, there was no one there to test his shields. Or at least, he hoped Malfoy didn’t choose that moment to snoop inside his head and take a look around because that would be awkward for the both of them.
Draco felt the moment Harry’s control started to slip and with renewed vigour bobbed his head and sucked harder until Harry came with a shout, filling Draco’s throat and then he crumpled, boneless, to the floor.
“Harry do you smell something burning?”
A few months prior, just when they were trying to decide what to do with their careers, since they’d chosen to leave the Aurors, they had talked about it with Hermione and the next day they had received a letter with the unmistakeable Hogwarts crest. Apparently the DADA and Potions professors were due to retire after the summer and McGonagall was in dire need of fresh blood to shape the young minds of Britain’s wizarding children.
When they had reached the site though, they had been met with a large warehouse full of activity, much more than expected for a simple brewing station. They had observed for a while, noticing some of their known suspects enter and exit the warehouse at regular intervals, carrying heavy-looking crates inside and then leaving the property.
“Do you think I haven’t tried?” he laughs “Merlin I’ve tried and tried and tried, no one wants me, they want Harry Potter, the hero, the Auror, the one on the magazines. I’m not that person, I don’t want to be with someone who looks at me and sees
Harry hadn’t seemed to be of the same opinion, as he had been about to hand Draco some of his clothes he had frozen on the spot and had gone white as a sheet, before breaking in an apologizing blabbering mess with tears streaming down his eyes. Draco had hugged and held him until he’d calmed down and had told him that whatever had happened between them in the past was just that, the past and that he had forgiven Harry for his mistake and didn’t and would never hold it against him. He had explained to Harry how the scars where a reminder of who he had been and what he should strive to be.
The rest of the Aurors had still to go back to their jobs and Draco took the opportunity to get a bit of revenge on Robards for all those hours of useless reprimands, it was his turn now.
Putting on his slippers and trying to ignore the chorus of
Harry looked at his hand holding his holly wand, shrugged and with a wide arc of his arm, threw the wand at Draco, who plucked it deftly out of the air, showing that his seeker reflexes were still very much intact.
And despite all your meddling, Potter still came out victorious, he earned every bit of fame he has, he deserved to be
“Potter.” He said, earning everyone’s attention as he slowly twirled the holly wand between his fingers. “You forgot your uniform.” He smirked and with a flick of his wrist the deep red uniform unbuttoned itself and lifted from Harry’s body, floating mid-air in front of him. Nobody missed the fact that Draco had used Harry’s wand and it had worked perfectly.
Since they worked together, their success rate was the same, but they knew that they each contributed to different sides of the job, which was fine by them, since they both got to do what they liked best.
And…I’m lost in my head again. Great, Potter must think I’ve lost the plot, but when I look at him he’s still looking at
Potter, the angel that he is, doesn’t push me to start moving, instead, he rubs his hands up and down my thighs, easing the tension that has gathered there during my descent. I wish all lovers were this considerate with their partners.
The question takes me completely off-guard, would I do what? Did he say something else while I was studying his body? Gosh, this habit of getting lost in my thoughts is gonna be a problem someday.
Harry grinned. “We were.” He emphasized the
“Holy fucking shit Potter! Where the fuck did you learn to do that?!” Draco exclaimed, but Harry smirked without offering an answer. Draco wasn’t expecting one anyway.
But it wasn’t enough.
I look back at his cock, now glistening with my saliva and I lick my lips before taking him back in my mouth, I slowly slide down his length, progressively relaxing my throat and, when I feel the tip hitting the back of my throat, I ignore my gag reflex and push down, letting him slip into my throat, swallowing around him.
He knocked sharply on the door, trying to make as much noise as possible. He didn’t hear anything from the other side, if the previous sounds were anything to go by, it would take a while for someone to be decent enough to open the door. He settled on waiting.
Potter gives me a real full smile, I squirm a bit against the counter, he shouldn’t be allowed to smile like that, it’s doing strange things to my stomach.
He berated himself for letting Harry get worked up in the first place, he, more than anyone, knew how much Harry was terrified of disappointing others and making mistakes. Draco had been outraged the first time Harry had told him about his family and the way they’d treated him and only two very green and pleading eyes had stopped him from tracking down those assholes and show them what freaks were actually like. Draco had worked hard to change his misconceptions about muggles and had come to the realization that there were good and bad people in both the wizarding and the muggle world, but he shouldn’t generalize and hate all muggles just because they didn’t have magic. But those muggles, oh Draco had never wanted to hurt someone so badly in his life, they had completely and utterly destroyed Harry, they had made him believe that he was worth nothing, that he was useless and a freak and a monster and no one would ever love him. They had never showed him kindness and affection, leaving him touch-starved and alone. It was no surprise to Draco, after discovering all that, that Harry always threw himself head first in every dangerous situation If you’re told since the beginning that your life isn’t worth living, sometime during those years you start to believe it yourself, and when faced with the choice of risking your life to save someone else’s, it’s rather easy to discard your safety, since you think so little of yourself in the first place.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and the next moment he felt the head of Draco’s cock push against his still fairly tight hole and slowly slip inside.
Draco moved languidly up and down the length in his mouth, paying special attention to the throbbing vein on the underside and teasing the slit every time he came up for air.
“You really think that I would happily continue working for you, after how you treated my partner?”
Everyone stood shocked as Robards talked, they all knew that he hadn’t liked Harry from the beginning, but it was undeniable that Harry was a great Auror.
He groaned and turned off the now useless distraction provided by the wireless. It wasn’t like this was a novelty for him, it happened regularly. One night a week, almost every week, his usually quiet neighbour decided to break the peace and have a bit of fun, which wasn’t a bad thing per se. Unfortunately, it also reminded Harry of his own less-than-exciting social life.
I nod.
That left muggles and Harry supposed they were enough, for one-night stands. The idea of entering a relationship with a muggle though, wasn’t something Harry particularly thought about, for multiple reasons, but mostly because he didn’t want to have to hide himself and magic was a big part of his life, from his job to his friends and adoptive family.
Malfoy looked like he didn’t care either way what Harry thought.
Harry scratched the back of his neck trying to find something to say that wouldn’t make him look like a complete idiot.
“COME ON! YES!”
“The one and only.”
Potter’s eyebrows scrunch up in confusion, it’s now that I notice a few fine lines on his forehead and around his eyes, he must frown a lot.
business, you listen and do as she says.
Potter doesn’t seem to mind though, which is nice, when I zone out with Pansy, she usually slaps me to make me come back to reality, not nice.
When all of Potter’s hard length is deep inside me, I take a second to breathe and get accustomed to the size. I’m not a virgin by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s been a while since I’ve been rammed by a cock this big and I’d like to still be able to walk tomorrow, even with a limp.
“Apparated through multiple layers of anti-apparition wards?” he smirked “Yes, he did.”
Green orbs widen fractionally and I see his dick jump a little as he groans.
gay club.
Exactly. You take out your tightest pair of jeans, (the ones that make your arse look like it’s a fucking sculpture), wear the short-sleeved black t-shirt that hugs your lean frame, outlining all you lightly-defined muscles and style your hair in that ‘just shagged, but ready for more’ look that you know that, combined with a thin line of black eyeliner around your grey eyes, will make heads turn left and right.
Over the years though, they had come to the silent agreement that the reckless and frankly stupidly heroic gestures were left to Harry, while Draco followed him, covering his back and cursing all the way. It worked and they were both happy with it, their bosses, not so much, which was why Draco found himself in this position in the first place, facing a wordless Robards, waiting for an answer he knew he would not get.
As he felt his orgasm fast approaching he tried to warn Draco tugging at his hair, but Draco only increased his efforts, hollowing his cheeks and taking in his mouth as much of Harry’s cock as he could fit.
The pout disappeared in an instant and Draco’s pupils dilated so much the black swallowed any trace of grey left.
Py walks past me without a second glance and starts sniffing Potter’s feet and legs, normally I would stop him, but Potter’s face is too good to do anything about it. He looks torn between fear and wonder, do animals usually snob him that he’s so happy to have the attention of one?
“Please.” I moan helplessly.
“So…”
Draco started eagerly sucking on Harry’s member as if it was a delicious popsicle in a hot summer day and Harry was soon reduced to a whining puddle of goo. His hands were gripping the sheets, trying to stay away from Draco’s head, but then he thought,
Without giving Malfoy any more time to rethink his decision, Harry quickly entered the other man’s apartment and in three strides he was in the living room.
Draco watched as every Auror in the bullpen listened to his every word, he really enjoyed speaking to an audience, it was second nature for him to hold the undivided attention of a room, which coupled with a healthy dose of love for teaching, made him an excellent lecturer.
“Fuck!” is all I manage to say as he literally devours me, his tongue teasing my rim and then slipping inside, massaging my walls and making me squirm in pleasure.
“Yes! Merlin Potter yes! I like it!” Draco shouted and Harry grinned widely.
We lay in silence for a few minutes, basking in the afterglow of a glorious orgasm, until the cooling sweat on my skin and the come leaking out of my ass start to be too uncomfortable and I move slightly to reach my wand on the nightstand and cast a cleaning charm over the both of us and the sheets. I’m rewarded with a satisfied hum from Potter and I feel his arms tug me back in place, moving my body until he’s spooning me and I’m safely enclosed in his arms, his soft breaths caressing my neck as he falls asleep.
Potter still doesn’t answer, which is unnerving, I haven’t seen the git in years and out of all places, I find him in a muggle gay club.
The most powerful wizard of our time, so powerful that he managed to slice through layers of centuries-old wards
“You’re not a Death Eater.”
That obviously hadn’t deterred Harry in the slightest and he had tried to purposefully plan random encounters in the elevator and outside their doors, he had even found a plausible excuse at work to go down to level nine and look for him in the Department of Mysteries, but that had been a failure, seen as he had had no idea how to even travel through the countless unnamed corridors of the Department to find the Potions division.
He laughs.
“My mark says otherwise.”
The poorly brewed draughts had been replaced by innovative concoctions that ranged from hallucinogenic substances to barely safe sleeping draughts, some of which had sent several people into a coma, though there hadn’t been any casualties, yet.
He would miss the uniform, he had worked so hard to earn it, but reality wasn’t as good as his expectations had been before starting the training, and he wouldn’t keep working without Harry anyway.
“So the next time I have the chance to catch another gangster, killer or dark Lord, what should I do, wait for the bloody paperwork to be signed and risk the criminal getting free?” he asked incredulously.
“You really think that I was
Potter groans behind my back and I smirk.
“Of course I remember them, I spent a whole night in fourth year making every single one of them.”
and suddenly everything makes sense.
He saw several Aurors flinch at Voldemort’s name, it was eleven years after the end of the war and the disgusting being still managed to terrorize people.
Harry grinned and with another wave of his hand the sheets were cleaned and moved to cover them.
I step forward and I press all of me against all of him, he’s not much shorter than me, our bodies align almost perfectly and I feel his sculpted chest against mine, his defined abs against my relatively flat stomach and
“They wanted to send you in Azkaban and you don’t see anything wrong with that?”
Malfoy groaned “What now Potter.”
I stay awake for a little while more, thinking.
Harry looked around the room, almost like he was trying to impress every detail in his memory, having apparently gotten his fill, he turned one last time to Draco, gave a small nod and a smile and, turning on his feet he disapparated with a loud crack.
Potter says it with such certainty that I almost believe him.
He unpinned his badge from his uniform and threw it on the nearest desk, the low thud filling the room along with some gasps.
“Hasn’t bothered you before, has it?” he asks smirking as I blush lightly.
Draco, on the other hand, was a good duellist and could hold his own, but would never be as good as Harry, he wasn’t as fast and his reflexes not as quick, not to mention that his own sense of self-preservation would never allow him to pull some of the stunts he had seen Harry dive in without a second thought during the years. He wasn’t a coward, but not reckless either, if things had been done according to him in the past, their solved cases would probably be a lot less, granted, the number of injuries and hospital-stays would decrease exponentially too, but was it worth it? Harry didn’t think so, and Draco was inclined to agree, he knew he would take a broken arm if it meant another criminal behind bars, he just didn’t purposefully look for the most dangerous route if he could find another way with time. Harry wasn’t as patient or mindful about his well-being to wait, which had been the subject of a lot of their first arguments, when they were still getting used to each other.
At that, both of Draco’s eyebrows rose in surprise, before his face hardened. “And why, pray tell, would you be interested in what I do inside the confines of my own home?” Draco asked defensively.
“I have no problem whatsoever with you watching football Malfoy.” He said.
He scoffed, the haughty Malfoy mask slipping into place effortlessly despite Draco not having had a need for it in recent times.
“That I do.” He acknowledged with a loving smile.
“What exactly is going on here Harry?” she asked in a polite tone, though the command behind her question was clear.
How are you going to justify that you tried to hold him back from
“Fucking finally.” He growled as he launched himself at the other man, crushing their lips together in a messy, raw battle of lips, tongues and teeth.
Potter’s hand halts his movement as he turns to look at me, incredulous, still bent down though, which is nice. “You called your cat Grumpy?”
He breathed on it like he had done before, only now the effect was enhanced and Draco hissed when the warm air reached the sensitive skin.
“By the way Potter” Draco’s voice suddenly interrupted the silence “The next time you want to find me in the Department of Mysteries, try asking the walls, they’re very good at giving directions.”
I’m too far gone to even understand what I’ve just said, but it seems to kick-start Potter into action and, in a flash, my knees are pushed against my chest and a warm, wet tongue is probing at my hole.
He leaned in kissing Draco’s lips softly and when they separated they were both wearing goofy smiles.
It’s my turn to be amused. “And since when do you care?”
He had to forcibly stop himself from staring any more than he had already done and concentrate on the now pissed off man in front of him.
“Potter” he sneered “Head Auror Robards wants to see you in his office, he looks quite mad.” The asshole was grinning and Draco wanted to punch the teeth out of his mouth so much his fists were hitching.
Back at the Ministry they had gone straight to their shared office and now here they were, sighing and sinking comfortably in their chairs.
I roll my eyes. “Do you really think that Pansy has the Potions skills to invent and brew a concoction that has Granger talking about it for months?”
“I know.” Draco replied smugly. Harry suppressed a grin of his own.
“You stink Potter.” Answered Draco with a sneer. What once would have had Harry ready to fight in a heartbeat, now only elicited a soft chuckle from the brunet, too used to his partner’s antics to take offence.
“That was amazing Draco.” Said Harry between deep breaths to calm his racing heart.
“What’s relevant right now though, is what came from those actions, the Wizengamot of that time implemented the laws according to the new requirements, but those laws only state that
I step out of my trousers and turn around, walking back to the bed with swaying hips. Potter’s eyes don’t leave the tent in my boxers and he licks his lips, making my cock twitch in excitement.
“Maybe, maybe not. There’s a fine line between love and hate after all, it is entirely possible that I had a huge crush on you and my closeted brain just couldn’t accept it.”
The gang, that the press had named
“Pansy Parkinson made you come here?” Potter clarifies.
That was proven when Harry raised a single eyebrow. “Is that so?”
They stood together for a while, it could have been hours, but probably was only minutes, breathing together and just feeling each other. When Draco deemed the impending crisis averted, he turned Harry in his arms and placed the softest kiss on his lips, moving then back to look him in the eyes, arms coming up to cradle the back of his head.
Every restraint they had, snapped when they saw all three presumed heads of the operations exit a muggle limousine and stroll inside the building.
“Oh, I believe I can think of a thing or two, in fact, why don’t I show you?” he said and started making his way down Harry’s neck, kissing, biting and soothing all the way to his Adam’s apple and back.
He slid closer to Draco’s body and, when the man didn’t make any move to push him away, he curled on Draco’s side, placing his head on Draco’s chest. An arm came to rest on his shoulder keeping him close and Harry let out a contented sigh.
“God Draco. That was… wow.”
Draco moved away to retrieve something from his bedside table and Harry was left admiring the man’s body. He hadn’t expected those sharp clothes to be hiding so many muscles, but Draco’s form was impeccable, he wasn’t bulky, but he had managed to maintain his lithe seeker build from Quidditch training, with a compact layer of muscles all over his body. He was slender, but he radiated power, like he could still kill you with just a touch.
Not wasting any time he had thrown himself in Harry’s arms, snogging the living daylights out of him and then some. When they had finally separated to get some much needed air, Draco had smiled fondly at Harry.
That’s
He didn’t want to wait for people like Marchbanks to catch on though, that would take forever.
It’s not the first time I’ve seen him laughing, I used to watch him in school, having fun with his merry band of Gryffindors, but this is the first time he’s ever laughed in my company.
“Enough.” he managed to bit out through moans and curses.
After months of pining after his neighbour and listening to him vehemently expressing his impassivity towards him once a week, Harry had had enough.
After the war, while Draco had been at a loss for what to do and had eventually decided to join the corps to try and redeem his name, Harry had done the same for the opposite reason, his name was already valued the highest it could, but Harry hadn’t felt like he had earned anything that had come to him and that had stung. There had been rumors around the Ministry about how he had been allowed to join the training program even without the necessary qualifications because the Minister himself had vouched for him, everyone had expected him to fail, to show that he was not all that good. But Harry had been. He had not only been good, he had been great. He had aced the training, finishing top of the class and had showed, time and again, that he had gotten there because he deserved to be there.
“You were thinking? Merlin save us.”
When my rim is loose enough, I feel a finger join the wet muscle and I let out a broken cry, I grip my sheets so hard that my knuckles turn even whiter than usual, I’m not sure how much more I can take of this sweet torture.
“Doesn’t matter, do it again.” He instructed.
Draco cited as he got out of his uniform and placed it on a nearby desk along with his badge.
Harry leaned back to observe the masterpiece that was Draco Malfoy, half naked and panting in front of him.
When he turned to look back at Robards, he saw only confusion there.
“Happy now?” he asked Robards in a tone that clearly said he didn’t care one bit about the other man’s happiness.
He groans when I take him out of his trousers, his cock is beautiful, long and thick, neatly trimmed dark pubes surround the base, the head is flushed a dark red and there’s a small bead of glistening precum at the tip, it’s warm and hard in my hand and I want to taste it so bad. I give it a couple of strokes just to get a feel of it, Merlin I can’t wait to have it inside me.
“Yes please.” He took the drink gratefully.
“Thank you.” He says gratefully, I guess that giving Granger an outlet for her obsession will ease the pressure on Potter, who definitely doesn’t know shit about makeup.
“Fuck.” Potter hisses as one of his hands grabs my hair, I moan at the slight pain and he shivers.
I have to say that I was a bit unsure about writing in first person when I first thought of this story, but I like the outcome very much and I'll  likely write like this more in the future.
He turned the TV on, trying to drown out the noise, he mindlessly flipped through the channels, there was a cooking show, a sitcom, a reality and a football match, nothing that really held his attention. He decided to check if there was a Quidditch match on the wireless, though hearing matches was nowhere close to watching them and it got boring after a while. Nevertheless, he settled for a rerun of the latest Harpies game, at least he would have something to talk about with Ginny the next time he’d see her.
“POTTER!” he shouted.
In the ten years they had been partners, they had worked tirelessly on their cases, becoming the best team in the Department, their solve rate had been the highest in the last century and they had rapidly climbed the hierarchy from Junior Aurors to Seniors and eventually, since the quality of their work and the efficacy of their partnership had been indisputable, they had become Deputy Heads.
The fight had been strenuous, they had been heavily outnumbered, but most of the brewers had been easily dealt with, leaving only the bosses and their security. Harry and Draco had taken on two or more duels at the same time to allow the rookies the chance to deal with the less experienced fighters and they had finally managed to incapacitate everyone just as the backup started to arrive.
He couldn’t help his reaction at his boss’ words, he laughed. A full belly laugh that left him gasping for air and fall right back into a fit of giggles.
“It tastes amazing to.” confirmed Draco as he moved to bite at his right arse cheek, hard enough to almost break the skin and definitely leaving a mark.
One thing you learned when working with Robards was that he hated any kind of disrespect, insubordination was not taken lightly, most of all if coming from those he should be grooming to take his place sometime in the future. Slamming his door was a certain way to provoke his ire and Draco didn’t even want to know what Harry had said to him before slamming the door, nothing good judging from their boss’ expression.
“Absolutely darling.”
The first time they had been intimate, Harry had slowly divested Draco and then had proceeded to trace each and every scar with his fingers lips and tongue, his own way of apologizing and finally accepting his actions. When he’d finished they’d both had tears shining in their eyes, but they had smiled lovingly at each other and Draco had pulled Harry up to share a long and passionate kiss, both saying with actions what they couldn’t with words. From that day on, the attention Harry paid to his scars was just another way of showing Draco his love, and Draco cherished every time.
He didn’t say.
He looks around as if expecting her to step out of the crowd, which of course she doesn’t, she’s at home probably getting woken up by her screaming baby daughter Lisa at the moment. That girl, my goddaughter, is such a delight, but she has some powerful lungs for such a tiny body.
It would be both a fresh start and the continuation of the beautiful journey they had begun when they had become friends then lovers and more.
“I guess it would be a disservice to wizardkind if I didn’t lend my extensive knowledge to shape the next generation of witches and wizards…” he pondered.
Potter stares at the cat warily, I chuckle, he may be a little shit, but he’s harmless.
“You suffocated Potter and oppressed him so much he couldn’t stand it anymore, and for what? A bit of rule-bending here and there?
I nod, because I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do.
He licks his lips and I follow the movement with my eyes, then go back to staring into the green pools that are being progressively swallowed by black.
Harry hummed and tightened his grip in Draco’s hair as Draco fell to his knees and started mouthing at the denim covering Harry’s half hard cock.
“Good? It was more than good, it was magic a fourth year shouldn’t be able to do, well apart from Hermione, but she’s not a good example of the average student. The charms on those badges where beyond OWLs level, I spent days researching them in the library, Pansy thought I had gone mad in my quest to antagonize you.”
“Please what love?”
“I … uhm …er”
It was exhilarating and addictive, kissing Draco Malfoy was the best feeling Harry had ever experienced.
Draco rolled his eyes, honestly, how could you be that dumb? He pondered again how this man even got into Auror training without having the basic ability of reading between the lines of a very simple statement.
Finished with his inspection, Py turns to me, meows and starts rubbing his body on Potter’s legs. I guess I have his approval.
I roll my eyes at him, he may be a Balinese, which are supposed to be affectionate, but the beast is an asshole, though I suppose I am too and that’s why I still haven’t gotten rid of him.
When they stopped for lack of air, they stared in each other’s eyes.
“YES! YES! YES!”
I push at his shoulder until his back in on the bed and I straddle his hips, bending down to kiss him. His warm mouth welcomes my tongue and I explore the delicious cavern with no hurry, letting my tongue slide against his palate, teeth and finally, curving around Potter’s tongue in a sensual battle where no one wins nor loses.
Draco let out a strangled shout, his body tensing trying to keep control for a little while more, but when Harry moaned around his length, any plan went right out the window and he came with a sob, his lover’s name on his lips.
“Merlin Harry.” Draco moaned.
It was then that he saw them, thin white lines criss-crossing Draco’s torso from neck to waistline. He froze on the spot, mind going back to that day in the bathroom, pools of blood on the floor, on his hands, soaking his clothes. A word. A single word had been enough to cause a disaster, the single most stupid thing Harry had ever done in his life, and that was saying something.
Why a muggle gay club?
He fondled his ring lovingly, remembering the night Harry had proposed to him.
I notice that I’m not the only one staring at him and he cannot have missed all the stares, he either doesn’t care, or he’s attracting the crowd on purpose, seeing as it’s two in the morning, I’d go for the latter, which is perfect because my groin has become quite interested in the various scenarios my mind has conjured while watching him.
club.
Potter seems angry, did I say something wrong?
He’s tall, but not towering over the crowd, the jeans hugging his legs leave nothing to the imagination, lean calves, strong thighs and that arse, oh God that arse, that mouth-watering goodness should be illegal to carry around, I stare at it for a while and then go back to my inspection and Merlin, that’s even better. He’s wearing a tank-top that shows all the muscles in his back ripple as he dances, thick bare arms thrown in the air casually as he sways to the beat. The only thing I can see of his head is a mop of sweaty black curls that reach his shoulders and glisten under the strobe lights.
“Uhm?”
“Wow.” Breathed Harry when he managed lucid thought and speech again.
“– why did you need Pansy Parkinson to tell you to get laid?”
Harry scrambled to find an answer that wouldn’t sound completely stupid and at the same time calm the blond man.
“You’re wearing too many clothes.” I say instead, motioning to Potter’s jeans and shoes.
It was amazing what effect a single word could have on Draco, as the man writhed before him, Harry vowed to find out every single one of Draco’s weaknesses and used them to make him squirm with pleasure.
“Show off.” Draco murmured at his display of magical prowess, but he was only teasing, as confirmed by the half-smile on his lips.
Either way, Draco knew it was a matter of minutes before someone would come knocking on their door to inform them that Robards wanted to see one or both of them.
Making sure to keep his touch light enough to tease but not enough to give any real pleasure, he slowly slid down the foreskin to uncover the spongy head.
.” He said indignantly, even as he snuggled deeper under the covers and pressed himself more against Harry.
Harry worked better in the outside world, practical work was his specialty, he also knew how to talk to people, a skill that Draco had never acquired. Oh, he could charm a full room if he needed to, but he was shit at dealing with the victims, he lacked the empathy necessary to really reach them, while Harry seemed to do so effortlessly.
“Well…” Harry flashed him with a positively Slytherin smirk. “I was thinking… we’ll be back at Hogwarts and, as you pointed out earlier, we’ve got time to make up for. We’ll have an invisibility cloak, the Marauder’s Map and no curfew, maybe we’ll find a few empty classrooms, we could explore the secret passages…” his tone had become more and more huskier as he spoke and Draco found himself short of breath. “You know, there are some alcoves and corners we could find useful…”
Malfoy didn’t seemed fazed by Harry’s clumsy excuse for conversation and didn’t bother answering.
Grey eyes widened fractionally as they took in the figure at the door, Harry knew he must have looked a fright, rumpled white t-shirt stained with an unidentified substance that might have been either ketchup or blood, grey cotton shorts and fluffy bunny slippers, a gift from Teddy for his birthday. Not the attire he had wanted the man he’d been salivating after for months to see him in, but in the spur of the moment he hadn’t thought about his own appearance, he’d been too focused on stopping whatever Malfoy was doing.
“I-I just wanted to know what you were doing tonight.” Harry replied. Which wasn’t far from the truth.
He doesn’t expect it when I roughly grab his hair and tilt his head backwards, crushing my lips on his, but he recovers from the shock quickly and responds to my kiss with fervent passion, matching me bite for bite, sliding his tongue against mine and tasting himself in my mouth.
It tasted of beer, but to Harry it was the best flavour in the world. The kiss was rough, months of longing and pining concentrated in one moment, it was a war, it was a dance, it was the merging of two opposite forces colliding to create something new, something that was neither of them and that, somehow, contained them both.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry murmured against Draco’s shoulder, once he’d calmed down and the tears had stopped flowing.
“Then I suggest you get on with i-”
Harry hadn’t uttered a word, but was slowly turning his head, eyes scanning the room. When they found Draco’s they stopped and waited, a question in his eyes that only Draco could read.
Potter nods “Yeah that, she had me and Ron run around to find it because she had read that her products weren’t made by house-elves and she’s still going strong about her campaign for elves rights and she wanted to try the thing.”
I shudder at the thought of what could have happened if Pansy had found me even just a week later, I was about ready to give up and sell myself at the first offer I got. I know, not ideal, but I was broke, alone and hopeless, my dignity had left around the end of my fifth year of school so it’s not like I had any more to lose. Thankfully, I haven’t had to discover just how low the bar can get.
They both fell on the bed, sweaty and blissed-out. For a few minutes the only noise to be heard was that of their ragged breathing as they tried to get their hearts under control and recover from the exertion and heart-shattering orgasms.
He leans back against the counter and surveys the room. “Wizards don’t want you, I don’t want them.”
“Fuck.” Potter groans as I start sliding down and, when his cock hits my prostate, I let out a loud yelp and start moving faster, grinding my hips in a circular motion that has me seeing stars and Potter losing control. He suddenly snaps his hips up as I come down to meet him and we moan in unison. The pain is now long gone, there’s only incredible pleasure and I can’t get enough of it. I remove my hands from Potter’s chest and place them behind my back, gaining more leverage to raise my hips as Potter pistons in and out of me, nailing my prostate with every single thrust.
Draco shook his head. “God, we were such idiots.”
I don’t know if Pansy’s right, I mean, sex is great, I love sex, but I don’t know if it’s a good enough distraction from my problems. There’s no harm in trying though and if it doesn’t help, it’ll still be sex, which is never a bad thing.
I tease Potter and he blushes, I lick my lips. “Easier to unwrap.”
After the realization that they were both been used again as pawns in a power ploy, they had decided to push past their differences, try to start anew and make the Heads regret the day they had decided to screw them over.
“What did you mean then?” asked Draco perplexed.
Holding Harry tight to make him feel that he wasn’t alone was a major contributor in helping him calm down, so Draco tightened his arms in an almost vice-like grip and felt Harry’s heartbeat against his chest slow down to match his.
“That’s illegal.”
“Shut up.” He protested weakly.
“Great. Can I go back to the match now?” he asked and, without waiting for an answer he started to close the door, but Harry’s foot was still blocking it.
Neither Harry nor Draco were in the condition to go on with the teasing any longer and Harry didn’t waste time in engulfing the head of Draco’s cock in his mouth. Draco’s hands flew to Harry’s hair, gripping the raven strands and holding tightly as he let out a loud moan.
I’m not usually picky about my one-nights, but today I somehow find myself rejecting each and every offer on the base that they don’t reach some standard I wasn’t even aware I had in the first place. I’ve had my fair share of lovers in the years after the war, all of them muggles, of course, and I’ve never had a problem with choosing which fortunate lad to take home.
club.
Harry tried not to let his gaze linger too much on the man’s Adam’s apple as he swallowed another sip of his beer, but it was like he wasn’t in control of his body anymore. His eyes remained glued to the sight, no matter how hard he tried to look away, there was always something new they discovered. A small scar on the chin, a freckle on the nose, a thin line around his mouth that indicated that these days Malfoy smiled a lot more than he used to in school. It was mesmerizing.
failed a single mission in ten years of service, you tried to stop him from doing his job at the best of his abilities?
Harry was also the best at understanding the motives behind people’s actions, Draco never bothered with them, to him the mystery was solved when the evidence pointed to the culprit, he didn’t need to know the reasons, his job was solving the puzzle, but Harry always insisted on knowing the drive behind the action and was the best at getting confessions from difficult suspects because he took the time to understand them. Draco, on the other hand, made always sure to have a foolproof case, leaving a signed confession a bonus, but not essential.
As my eyelids get heavy and I feel my body slip into the realm of beatific unconsciousness, my mind asks one final question.
This time Harry was definitely blushing, but he was also smiling.
“A BIT?!”
“You were a bit obsessed weren’t you?” and Draco could feel the smug grin even if he couldn’t see it.
“I didn’t.” he grits out.
When they had gotten engaged they had set the date of the wedding for the August of two years after, leaving them both time to organize everything and sort out their jobs, they had eventually decided to hand in their resignations in June and enjoy the summer together, free of responsibilities, besides making the final touches to the wedding.
Harry turned in his arms, giving him a confused gaze.
Hermione heaved a huge sigh of relief and grinned.
Robards seemed to remember that this was supposed to be his Department.
let him go.” He repeated to reinforce the concept and saw Robards gulp.
Once his heart didn’t seem to be on the verge of jumping out of his body anymore, Harry was able to take stock of the situation, the wet puddle of cum under his stomach and the sweat on his whole body were quite uncomfortable, but he was too tired to even consider getting up to get cleaned up. He concentrated very hard on what he wanted and waved his hand, his wand was still in his apartment since he hadn’t foreseen the need for it when he’d decided to bother his neighbour. His wandless cleaning charms weren’t perfect, but they sufficed. He did one for Draco too, because the man didn’t seem to be eager to get up either.
“Are you serious?”
“People have a long memory.” I shrug, it’s a fate I have accepted, I don’t have a place among wizards anymore, that’s fine, I deserve it.
“Malfoy, what the hell does that have to do with anything?”
He heard a sharp intake of breath behind him and he knew he wasn’t the only one who had a body to admire. Of course Harry knew he was good-looking, the hordes of fans constantly trying to get his autograph on his pictures and the award for most-eligible bachelor he received every year from Witch Weekly were clear indicators. Plus, he wasn’t blind, he could recognize beauty in others, he did in himself too. All the years of Auror training had helped him develop a shape of which he was proud, the scrawny build he had had in school was nowhere to be found, replaced instead by wide shoulders, strong arms and thighs and a slim waist, not to mention the round butt he had one day looked in the mirror and found filling his jeans, that had been a welcomed surprise, result of countless squats and runs up and down flights of stairs during his job.
Harry felt a shiver run through his body at Draco’s words and his cock made a weak but valiant effort to stir again.
“Of course my name is nowhere near Pansy’s company, if it was, she would never sell anything. Who would buy something created by a Death Eater?”
I keep stimulating him for a while, attacking alternatively one nipple and the other, while with my mouth I switch between teasing licks, hard sucking and fast moving up and down Potter’s magnificent cock. All throughout, Potter keeps grunting, groaning and moaning and the sounds go straight to my own member, which has been left unattended and is now painfully hard and pushing against my zipper.
“I should be rotting in Azkaban, Potter. That’s what they wanted.”
“Those are our written resignations, we were actually planning to hand them in next month, but you gave us a valid reason to do so now, so thank you.”
“Because I want you to fuck me.”
It wasn’t that Harry was a hermit or didn’t like to go out and have fun, he was an Auror, he met people every day, people that wouldn’t think twice about engaging in a particular kind of fun with him. That was the problem though, wasn’t it? He could have a line of adoring fans ready to sleep with him, if he just said the word, but did he want that? No.
Draco saw the conflicted look on Robards face and wondered, not for the first time, how that man had reached such an important position if he didn’t even know how to conceal his emotions, not that it was difficult to follow Robards’ train of thought.
Harry had calmed down considerably during Robards’ ranting, but Draco knew that calmness didn’t equal compliance.
“Because that would mean that we’ve been two massive blockheads pining for each other while trying to make our lives hell for all that time. I can’t abide that, all those years wasted antagonizing you while I could have spent the hours snogging you in empty classrooms and secret corridors.”
“You can say that.” Was Draco’s reply as he rolled off of Harry and settled on his back next to him.
Our lips are connected, but our bodies are too far apart, I need to feel more of him.
“No, but it will make it harder for you to fuck me into the mattress.” I say looking him straight in the eyes.
Harry didn’t stand a chance, he felt the tell-tale tingle at the base of his spine and his balls tightened against his body, the next second he was spilling down Draco’s throat as the man swallowed down every drop of Harry’s cum.
“Anyways, now you know why I’m here. Why are you?” I ask, because he hasn’t answered and I’m curious and eager to divert the conversation towards more light-hearted themes.
, his erection right next to mine.
Cute.
Still, the man’s body and intelligence weren’t what drew Harry in, it was his complete and utter indifference towards Harry’s hero status. It was refreshing to have someone who didn’t see him as the distorted figure everyone but his closest friends believed him to be.
Today is different and I don’t know why, then I see
“You work for Parkinson?” Potter says surprised.
“Move and don’t hold back.”
Ever since the apartment next to his had gotten a new tenant a year ago, Harry had been able to think of little else. He was sure that whatever supernatural force controlled his life was playing a prank on him. Here he was, the most beautiful man Harry had ever laid eyes on, waltzing through the doors of his building one sunny day, ready to turn Harry’s life on his axis. He was as perfect as human beings could be, he was a wizard and a very skilled one at that, Harry had discovered, after asking around the Ministry and finding out that the man was one of the lead Potions researchers in the Unspeakable division. He obviously wasn’t supposed to know that, but his name held much more weight than the general public knew, especially inside the walls of the Ministry and confidential information was not something that applied to him, much to Hermione’s annoyance and Ron’s amusement every time Harry managed to retrieve a crucial piece of information she had spent days, if not weeks, trying to obtain.
“So, you are the inventor of an entire line of cosmetics, which means you’re awfully smart, you’re hot as fuck, hence you don’t have trouble finding a partner if you want one,–”
I wiggle my butt a bit, but he doesn’t move and doesn’t break eye contact.
Potter groans “GREAT. She’ll have me and Ron look for it as soon as it’s out and won’t stop talking about it until next spring.”
“Well, he was a Christmas present from Pansy five years ago and, even as a kitten, he looked like this, all fluffy with the grumpiest face I had ever seen on an animal, he reminded me of my grandfather Abraxas, who used to scowl and frown a lot in my youth. I didn’t want to call him Abraxas, so I called him Grumpy.”
In this case his pureblood upbringing turned out to be useful as he looked down at Robards with contempt and annoyance written all over his face.
I sigh, he really wants me to say it, doesn’t he?
Now, what you could try to argue, was that Potter wasn’t supposed to apparate out of here because he couldn’t use his wand in the DMLE, but as demonstrated by this” and he twirled the holly wand before their eyes “Potter did not, in fact, use any wand, so he technically hasn’t broken any law.” He concluded with a wry grin.
“Uh?”
He looks at me confused “Pansy Parkinson?”
“You know that was not what I was talking about.” Scoffed Harry.
“Actually,” interrupted Draco, adopting the same tone he use when lecturing the trainees “Potter hasn’t done anything illegal-”
because of paperwork and protocol?”
As the red tinge on his cheeks deepened, the Auror turned around and angrily stomped away.
It’s my turn to scrunch my eyebrows in confusion. “No. I thought it a reasonable punishment, just like everyone else.”
They both put down their bottles without breaking eye contact, then Malfoy raised an eyebrow as if to ask ‘Well, what are you waiting for?’ and Harry lost any semblance of control.
Have a good read. <3 G.
Harry shivered at hearing his name said with such fondness. He raised his head to look into stormy grey eyes.
The next time they’d stopped, it had been Harry who broke the kiss, just enough to summon a box from his room. The small black box had sailed through the air and landed in Harry’s open palm. Making quick work of the lid, Harry had presented Draco with the ring with a hopeful look in his eyes. Draco had stared mesmerized at the ring, taking it out of the box and placing it on his finger, where it had sat like it had been there his whole life. From that day on, Draco had always carried it on himself, in a hidden pocket at work, flaunting it in front of their friends when they got together.
Harry grunted in response, it was the same thing every time.
I throw my head back on the pillow, all strength having left my body, Potter’s tongue inside me is to die for. The man certainly knows how to work it and I’m the lucky recipient of his skills.
It was smiling that he shouted the address to Grimmauld Place and stepped into the green flames, and he was still smiling when he stepped out of the fireplace into the living room of his and Harry’s home.
“Fuck Malfoy, you can’t say things like that.”
Suddenly the prospect of going back to Hogwarts was much more appealing to Draco.
By the time Potter has three fingers inside me, I’m a blabbering sobbing mess, begging for Merlin knows what. Potter looks at me and he must see that I’m on the verge of complete and utter destruction, because he crooks his fingers and stabs my prostate spot on. The stimulation is too much, he must have teased and pleasured me for almost an hour now and I’ve reached my limit, I come with a shattered wail all over my stomach and Potter keeps abusing my prostate as my body shudders, prolonging the sweet, sweet agony.
Draco smirked “Oh you will, I’m not finished with you yet, not by a long shot.”
Draco smirked, it was time to change to subject. He leaned in, bringing his mouth to Harry’s ear.
I grip the hem of his tank top and tug it up, making my intention clear and he helps me in removing the garment.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Good to know that you’re still as inarticulate as ever, but if you don’t get to the point in the next five seconds, I’ll magically slam the door shut, with or without your foot there.”
“If you were one of the hypothetical men, would you consent to the use of Veritaserum?”
Listen here Potter, you might be a good Auror but you DON’T make the rules! You are NOT above the law and you are NOT in any kind of position to do whatever you want without consequences!” he was panting by now, an incensed look in his eyes.
“No, you didn’t and you saved my life. I’ll always be thankful for that.” I say truthfully.
Robards laughed. “Of course it is Potter. You are not a God, you cannot act without thinking! You are not as good as you think you are and you are not going to become Head Auror with that attitude, in fact, as far as I’m concerned, you are not going to become Head Auror, period. I don’t know what Kingsley sees in you, you are just an overrated child with too much fame and not enough control!”
“Please
Now Potter is all grown up, his shoulder have broadened, his muscles are way more defined, his thighs look like they could crush me and I would gladly let them.
“Er … Hullo Malfoy.”
If anyone had expected the stern woman to start on one of her famous lectures, they had been sorely mistaken.
At least now, the weekly outbursts coming from the other side of Harry’s living room wall were explained. Harry found that he didn’t mind in the slightest that Malfoy wasn’t doing anything more than watching TV, as selfish as that was.
“Your ass looks delicious Potter.” Draco said in a lust-filled voice.
You see, when you work for Pansy and she not-so-subtly, instead rather directly, makes you notice that you are too tired lately and that your frustration is harming
Draco wasn’t a fool, he knew perfectly well that most of the Department still distrusted him and only a few had been able to look past his mistakes and see the real Draco. He was also aware that his position as Deputy Head Auror, although he was more than qualified for the role, had been mostly due to Kingsley promoting Harry and subsequently having had to promote Draco as well in order to not split their successful partnership. But Draco had worked hard and he was good, very good, maybe not as brave or magically powerful as Harry, but he was smart and resourceful, he was an asset in the Department for his combined knowledge of Dark Arts and Potions, making him one of the prime consultants in every major case, not to mention that he wasn’t half bad at offensive and defensive magic, he was more than able to hold his own in a duel, which he had demonstrated several times in the past.
To his surprise not two seconds after, the door was swiftly opened and Harry found himself staring at a completely dressed and slightly annoyed Draco Malfoy.
I give him the
The whole Department knew that Marchbanks was a mediocre Auror at best, he was teased even by the rookies, some of which, Draco had to admit, were better than him and had every right to do so.
I think my eyes roll back into my skull, but I can’t be sure since they were already closed.
“You don’t read the Prophet, do you?”
Having said everything that needed saying, he turned on the balls of his feet and, facing his office, he summoned everything inside, putting all of his and Harry’s belongings, except for a couple of parchment scrolls, in a conjured box, which he then shrunk down and placed in the pocket of his trousers. He then placed Harry’s wand in his thigh holster, next to his own wand.
Potter’s shoulders relax and he even smiles a bit. I try not to stare too long at his lips, I’m not sure I manage.
All in all, that man is edible and I very much would like to taste him.
Harry smiled sheepishly “Well, yes.”
Harry traced the line of Draco’s cock with his mouth a couple of times before moving away. Draco made a sound of protest and Harry chuckled.
Their relationship had started in much the same way almost three years prior, one night Harry had taken a curse meant for Draco, but had stubbornly refused to go to the hospital and Draco, being just as stubborn, had insisted on heling his wounds himself, which had resulted in Harry sprawled on the couch with newly healed patches of skin and Draco collapsed beside him, exhausted from both their previous work and the healing. Harry had turned to Draco with a soft smile and Draco had lost himself in the green orbs that had seemed to look directly into his soul. Their first kiss had started gentle and caring, both men careful of the other’s delicate condition, but had quickly become heated and passionate as the men got to know each other all over again by taste and touch.
“P-please t-touch me.” I stutter out as my movements falter.
When Harry reached the end of the last scar, Draco was panting, aching for relief, his throbbing cock leaking a steady stream of precum that gathered on his stomach. Harry, sensing that he had reached his limits, didn’t waste any time in descending a bit more along the bed and engulfing his cock in the wet hot cavern of his mouth.
Shocked silence was left in the room.
“Potter?”
He stares at the remnants of the dark mark with inscrutable eyes.
Potter’s hand reaches out, wraps tightly around my neglected cock and starts stroking in time with Potter’s thrusts.
placing a hand on Draco’s cheek, his thumb gently caressing a cheekbone. “But we’re not anymore, we won’t waste any more time.”
He steadfastly ignored the voice in his head that told him that he knew exactly why he wasn’t looking forward to another empty encounter in the dark hallways of a club and that the reason had nothing to do with the unbelievably fit man next door. Of course, he could try to argue with his brain, but it was always a futile attempt.
“Potter meet Py.” I say as I motion to the beast on the couch. “Py, meet Potter.” I add completely unnecessarily, since Py isn’t even remotely interested in what I have to say 99 percent of the time I speak to him.
On the one hand, getting rid of Draco would please a lot of people in the Department, not to mention in the whole Ministry and the Wizarding World in general. The bad publicity that having a former Death Eater among the ranks had brought, had been balanced out by the advantages, yes, but it didn’t mean that people liked it. They were more than happy to endure his presence if it meant that they could use his abilities in their own games, but Draco knew perfectly well that not being outright hostile was nothing close to being accepting.
“What now?” he bit out.
As Draco left his office, he took notice of the situation. Harry was angrily pacing the middle of the circular space, the others giving him a wide berth while watching from the sidelines, they knew they were in for some kind of confrontation and were waiting for the ball to drop.
Draco dropped into his seat with an exhausted sigh, on the other side of the office, Harry mirrored him.
Nimble fingers made short work of belt and flies, leaving only the thin silk of Draco’s boxers between Harry and his destination.
That wasn’t to say that Draco forgot about his own pleasure, and he was reminded of that by his painful erection pressing against the stiff material of the Auror-approved trousers he insisted on wearing, contrary to Harry who just put on whatever he found first, which was usually jeans, not that Draco could fault him that, when they made his arse look so delectable hugged by the denim.
“Good.”
“Aaah…Yes! Please please please!” I shout as I feel my cock get impossibly hard and then I’m coming with a shout of Potter’s name, splashing come all over his hand and chest, simultaneously clenching around Potter’s cock and making him moan as he coats my insides with his come. The feeling of the warm seed filling me makes me spasm more and some more come dribbles out my slit. I fall against Potter’s chest as all strength leaves me and Potter wraps an arm around my back, steadying me as tremors finish running through our bodies and we catch our breath.
A man who literally gave his life to save the world and in return got scorn and reproachful remarks from people who shouldn’t even have been here.” He gave a pointed glance at Marchbanks.
I nod. “The concealer was a big hit last year, if she liked that, she’ll probably go ecstatic with the one that’s going to come out at the end of this year.
“But that’s illegal.” Intervened Marchbanks “Head Auror Robards, we have to do something, Potter can’t just break the law like that, especially here!”
“Shit Malfoy, you’re so tight.” Potter gasps between thrusts and I’d like to answer him, but what comes out of my mouth is a jumble of curses and mewls that makes no sense.
Harry groaned and his hips moved forward, trying to get more friction on the now fully erected cock. Draco smirked.
“Ironic isn’t it?”
I roll my eyes. “It’s not my money they wanted.”
He placed himself on his hands and knees, this way Draco would have clear view of what Harry could offer.
