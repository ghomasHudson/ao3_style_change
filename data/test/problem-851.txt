For one thing, Harry isn’t blond. For another, he hasn’t been able to stick out a job at the Ministry. And most of all, he’s not that kind of person, all rough and biting and hot, like Malfoy is.
He’s overwhelmed at the sight of it. It’s everything he remembered, maybe more. He wants to lick it, to suck it into his mouth, to take it in his hand alongside his own and wank them until Harry is begging to come.
“I’ll need to figure that out. Focusing exercises. Some casting. Spending time outside the void. A bit of experimenting, probably.”
Blaise is off to – joy of joys – the year’s first meeting of the Slug Club, going to rub elbows with precious Saint Potter and his ilk. He leaves Goyle, Nott, and Pansy as my only companions. No need to wait for today’s entry, seeing as one can’t read, one won’t stop reading, and the last is preoccupied with figuring out how to drape school robes to her best advantage.
Draco folded his arms over his chest and smiled thinly. “That might be the smartest question you’ve asked yet.”
Then he looks up. Draco looks half-hypnotised, dilated pupils focused entirely on Harry. His jaw is slack, his chest rising and falling, the hint of a flush beginning to cross his pale skin. Harry moans at the sight of it and Draco’s trembling hips snap forward, his hands twisting in Harry’s hair as he pushes himself deeper.
“Of course they are. Estella’s been raised to prize status above all else. She can never reciprocate his affection.”
The details of her rant elude me. I just recall a torrential, furious questioning. Did I think it should be that easy for me? Didn’t I know how hard she’s had to work? Do I think she likes getting on her knees for every member of Dumbledore’s Army? Do I think she wanted to get stuffed by every soldier for the light, just to avoid getting spit on in the hallways? Didn’t I realise I should be on my knees begging for her after everything she’s had to give up to revive her reputation? That I didn’t deserve her, let alone Potter? Why should she help me, when I’m too poor a Slytherin to realise she was using me to knock him down a peg for putting her through all this in the first place?
“And then to enter the Great Hall.” He sighed, a bit dreamily. “To become part of one of four great houses, to join a lineage that has bound us together for a millennia? The honour of that!”
Malfoy’s back was framed by the reeds, and his outline grew smaller and smaller as he returned to his clinic, until all Harry could see was a figure on the path, and then nothing at all.
“Yes, well, they’ll believe it, you see.” Pansy replaced her frown with a thin smile. “And it got us the side of the house with the conservatory and the rose garden.”
It wasn’t stillness. Potter kissed like he fought, surging forward and weaving back. Like he played Quidditch, with his whole body, gasping and rolling his hips. His fingers were curious and nimble. His mouth was voracious. His fingernails raised gooseflesh up Draco’s sides and sent his blood surging downwards.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “What’s the difference? Did they explain what the implants are meant to be? Give you any literature on the procedure?”
Potter turned to him, his back to the door, his arms folded, and with a stubborn look the likes of which Draco hadn’t seen since their sixth year. “What are we supposed to do here? Got some rotting feed you want me to revive?”
“Actually.” Harry stopped to accept the glass of water. He took a sip. “Thank you. Actually, I was looking for you.”
And then I did it again. Told him. That yes, I did – do – hate charity. Am just in it for appearances.
“I didn’t—“ Draco hesitated, willing himself to be as honest as Harry had been. “Well. I did mean to make light of it, but not to belittle it. I do hope you realise that I support your recovery, and if you talk to Granger or whoever else again and you need that backing, I would—will—do it regardless of the windows, or anything else.”
“And you are unable to protect him?” Draco raised his eyebrows, folded his arms, and waited for Robards to, hopefully, walk into it.
“And her son.” He resists the urge to shiver under Draco’s scrutiny, only letting out a breath when Draco turns towards the back.
“Yes. The ritual.” Composing himself, Draco shook his head and blinked. “We need to bisect Slytherin’s mark. Usually you’d stand on the center of it and face the sinks, but there are two of us. You still need to face the sinks, but may not want to stay standing the whole time, so it’s best if you’d kneel, facing the sinks.”
Draco’s confusion must be showing; Potter leans back, arms crossed over his chest, and sighs. “You left.”
runs a bit speculating on the relationship between Potter and Jordan. The writers in F and L object minimally when instructed to reassign their best photographers from Potter to the Weird Sister’s album release. Draco checks every single wizarding periodical for further insinuations about him and Potter. There aren’t any. It means he’s done his job. He should be pleased.
Draco knows if it’s come to this it won’t be long and fuck, he’s ready, so ready. “I’m gonna come,” he warns, and Harry nods and hums and kneads the bulge of his cock under his palm. Draco threads both hands through the wild mess of Harry’s hair to hold him still, and Harry moans at the feeling, and Draco’s bollocks are so tight they ache. He can feel sparks of pleasure moving up through his thighs and he digs into Harry’s scalp and comes with a shout.
The only way out was the most obvious one, and he had the sinking feeling it was too obvious for Malfoy to have missed it. “What about the Muggle entrance?”
Of course, Malfoy ordered the escargot and a foie gras starter before turning his attention back to Quidditch.
“That was…fuck.” He blinks and props himself up. “That was so fucking good, I had no idea, no idea at all, but your cock…Merlin, your fucking cock.” He collapses back on to the bed.
, for defence, on her left wrist, twisted and splayed out away from her body. The man, the same rune reversed, for danger, on his right wrist, the only part of him left reaching for his sister.
Draco bucks into him with a throaty groan. Potter doesn’t back away. He hums his approval and meets Draco’s hips. He raises one knee to steady himself, braces a hand against the cupboard, and opens his throat. They establish a rhythm, Draco fucking Potter’s face and Potter urging him on with a flick of his tongue. Potter’s fingertips dig into his arse to pull him closer until Draco is gripping Potter’s mad, flyaway hair and chanting, “I’m gonna come, fuck Potter, I’m gonna shoot down your throat, fuck, you’re gonna taste me for days, fuck, fuck, yeah, like that,” and Potter still doesn’t pull away. He smiles around Draco’s cock and buries his nose in the blond curls at Draco’s base and hums and sucks until Draco comes, gasping for air and yelling for Merlin. Potter sits back and waits until he catches Draco’s eye, pointedly swallows, and grins up at him looking so fucking
Harry bends forward and the tip of Harry’s tongue skates over Draco’s clothed erection so lightly he can barely feel it. He comes up with a hungry smile. “Think I just need you to remind me.”
Draco drove into him, seating himself so deeply that Harry could feel the cool metal of the top of his cock ring against his arse.
Harry is just a little bit taken aback at the intensity of his ire. “Christ, Malfoy. I just was hoping it would be easy, okay? That I remembered more than I thought I did. Looks like it’ll just be a little more looking than I expected.”
“Fuck me.” Harry reached between his legs to grab Draco’s cock, lining it up and stroking it slowly. “Come inside me.”
“Merlin,” Draco repeated. “The magic that he did today was perfectly serviceable, some of it advanced. Expecto Patronum, Lumos, Finite Incantatem. All at the level I would expect from a well-trained Auror. But if it’s been that long, he shouldn’t have been able to do that.”
It’s when he pulls up, just barely, out of the kiss, that he looks down and realises Harry’s not just asking to be tasted, but devoured.
This morning is no exception. Draco gives hearty approval to a set in which Gwenog Jones is using a table for a dancefloor and Dai Llewellyn as a pole at Firewhisky Mist. He vetoes ones of Mrs Zabini, wand out, “wooing” one of the lesser Muggle royals poolside at Shoreditch House, but gives Higsbee permission to print Oliver Wood stumbling drunk from the Fourth Broomstick with an arm around the girl Weasley. Good for circulation; Wood’s star may be fading, but Weasley’s isn’t.
The art wasn’t much better. In one room, canvases with big blocks of colour. In another, a geometric mishmash that he could make neither heads nor tails of, except to say that it came off as vaguely aggressive. In another, a collection of bulbous sculptures that left him feeling unsure as to whether he was meant to be relaxed or afraid. In another, pictures of a man covered in black latex crawling across a bench with a whip in his mouth, then lying across the rough-hewn plank languorously, and Harry was on to the next room before he could feel anything he’d quite like to avoid feeling while sharing a building with Malfoy.
That fucking Hallows charm was hanging from her fingers. She’d knocked the circle at its centre totally out of alignment so the sheets were dusted with a fine white powder, though clearly an adequate amount had reached its final destination.
“Very well.” Draco spells the chair away from the desk. Higsbee takes the hint, dropping into it, accepting the water, and looking marginally less terrified when Draco takes his own seat across the desk.
Free mornings were such a novelty that Draco wasn’t sure what to do with his. Before his mornings had been devoted to Potter’s care they’d been spent in his lab or office, bent over wood samples or parchment or the occasional computer, though once he discovered the solitaire feature he’d decided any advantages with regard to organising data and editing papers were outweighed by the focused simplicity of a good self-inking quill. Any potentially lazy mornings he could remember had been occupied with sleepy shags or hair of the dog. He didn’t like feeling at such a loose end. His fingers itched for something to do. He missed his work, and while the Manor library was perfectly respectable, it didn’t have his books, or his view of the Panthéon.
Draco knew the time had come to leave, but his feet held him there a moment longer. Or perhaps it was the sudden awareness that he’d have a lot to consider once he left the room.
Potter shook his head. Was it that Potter didn’t want to admit to having been briefed, Draco wondered, or that Potter wouldn’t deign to speak to him?
You feel a jolt. Not in your chest. It’s low down, it’s in your cock, and it’s not how this was meant to go (spells or fists or not at all, but not…) but it’s there and he’s here, now, in front of you, with his brow raised and his lips quirked and it’s clear, it’s so clear.
“It’s not a problem.” Potter grit his teeth. The leaf didn’t so much as wobble. “I was out of line.”
Draco gaped. “You want to give up the Elder Wand, and all of your magical powers, and your job, and your friends. That’s not any sort of a problem for you.”
“Exactly.” He slides the piece of parchment across the counter. His address is written across it in clear print.
He tilts his head to meet Draco’s fingers as they come to card through his hair. “Good. Take me in your mouth.”
Harry spent the next several days looking up. He jumped every time he saw a bird, had to stop himself running for the hearth every time a log popped in the fireplace. Which made the event itself almost anticlimactic.
“Well,” he finally began. He straightened up; he hadn’t realised he’d started slouching. “I agree, clearly.” His voice sounded too sharp even to his own ears.
He pulls out his best parchment and quill and sets to writing out the sort of formal invitation he was trained for.
Okay, maybe the “fuck” wasn’t quite in line with the mission, but he was fairly certain it was still an improvement.
“Does our blood predict our skill? Does it determine our morality? Our intelligence? The contribution we make? What we give of ourselves in service to the whole?” Harry lowered his head, turning away from the bench so the press, and Draco, could see a bittersweet smile cross his face before he looked back to the Wizengamot.
In the mirrors, Malfoy was reflected back to him at a million different angles. In some ways he seemed to be fractured into a million splinters of Malfoy. Malfoy’s ear in one mirror. Malfoy’s elbow in another. The lights glinted off Malfoy’s white-blond hair and refracted into thousands of astigmatic stars, replicating themselves until they disappeared into the illusory horizon. Sometimes he looked like the boy Harry had hated. Sometimes he looked like a stranger. Sometimes he looked so familiar that being surrounded by him felt something like normal, felt like going back to a former home, however beloved or hated, and knowing how to find every light and avoid every creaky stair, even in the pitch black middle of the night.
He steps through the doorframe, displaying a level of queasiness that’s become familiar to Draco of late. “Sir, you needed something?”
“No.” He did laugh now, taking half a step back and spreading his arms. “Take your best shot. I won’t stop you.”
“Those aren’t all leaves.“ Draco crouched next to him and rustled the pile in front of him, pulling out a softened, browning apple. “This is a Roundway Magnum Bonum. Native to Wiltshire. Green and red flushed, quite crisp. When they're harvested they keep well, but they do this when they fall on the ground or into leaves, turn brown and get soft. It’s the moisture” He stood, holding the fruit out to Potter, who took it. “They start to ferment, too. Had a light harvest and a break in the paddock fence in the same year once and wound up with half a dozen drunk Thestrals.”
"Auror Potter?" He barely managed it. He'd become practised, over the years, at reading his own tone, and he could tell he was barely managing to cover the sudden wave of emotion.
After a moment she nodded and Draco saw her say, “Okay.” She looked at Harry questioningly. “What else?” Draco thought he saw.
, Malfoy,” and when the tension began to pool at the base of his spine, and when Potter half-screamed as he arched his back and spilled over Draco’s fingers and onto the plate glass, clenching his arse so Draco couldn’t do anything but follow him over… all of it, any of it, was enough.
Phillips has set up an array of devices while Robards and Proudfoot trade cordialities with the woman from R&D and congratulate Draco on his work. Harry shifts his weight from foot to foot, responding when spoken to, trying not to be too obvious in examining the strained note behind Draco’s thanks.
And with a much gentler click than Draco had managed, Potter opens and closes the door, and is gone.
He lies back against the pillow and wills himself to keep his hands about the covers. He closes his eyes and thinks of Malfoy’s biceps, his calves, the long lines of his torso when he’s arching into Harry’s mouth. Thinks of the taste of him. The fullness that will finally come when Malfoy’s skin is blossoming red between his lips.
The mirror confirmed it: another burn. It hadn’t scorched his clothes this time, but gone straight through to his skin. It wasn’t blistering, but the skin was red and tender.
As he ran a hand up Potter’s front, Draco lowered his mouth to the back of his neck, nipping at the skin and squeezing a nipple between his fingers.
As if I would, at this sight. His eyes are glazed, he’s glistening with sweat, I can feel his cock twitching in my mouth.
“Pansy.” Draco, feeling far more wrong-footed than he thought he ought to, set his saucer on the edge of the table. “I can’t imagine it’s escaped your notice that this is still, as you’ve said, my ancestral home.”
Draco shook his head and smacked it back against the leather. “So they stuck it in the Department of Mysteries, because obviously if Death Eaters and school children could get in, that’s the safest place for it.”
He leaned forward to study them. The twins were exactly as Harry had seen them, as Turner had found them, laid out in the street almost parallel to one another, except that their bodies were so twisted they no longer looked anything like straight lines. The mother—the Mediwitch—and her daughter, the Knockturn shopkeeper, were slumped on opposite sides of Diagon Alley, the mother with vacant eyes open and staring upwards, head tilted back against a store front and her blonde hair stuck to the glass with her own dried blood. And on her forearm,
The next few are clearer. Much clearer. Two men, caught in a passionate – well, embrace might be a bit generous.
It takes him a moment to parse Potter’s question. Of course it’s best to move on. They can’t spend the rest of the day standing in a field of liquor bottles, and any other possible meanings are patently absurd.
It takes at least a minute before Harry comes back to himself, before he winces and stops touching himself and collapses to Draco’s side. “Fuck.”
They stay on the floor for the next dance, and the one after, and they are short of breath, laughing in each other’s arms, after a fourth.
It felt like the kind of thought he couldn’t afford to turn over too carefully. “It’s not the same thing, and anyway—”
His lip was swelling. He was rolling it between his teeth and shifting his weight back and forth, and I loved it. Love it. Love him, and told him so.
It felt a lot like end of term. Knee deep in robes, tripping over his trunk, popping out of his bedroom for input from Pansy… it all felt so familiar. And through it all, Draco moved about his rooms in a haze. He’d taken things out and put them back many times over without accomplishing anything. At last, for something to do, he’d pulled a row of his work robes out of the wardrobe and set to work trying to fold them.
It’s so late that it’s technically the twenty-ninth day after the Battle of Hogwarts when Harry breaks his own
Harry wondered if he’d got stuck in a gallery or fallen through the looking glass. Maybe all those mirrors had really been the latter, and this was some sort of upside-down world where only unimaginably fantastical things were allowed to happen.
The book was right in front of him, but Draco wasn’t ready for it. Not yet. He knew just enough, he thought, to figure out what the Aurors knew. To put the pieces together.
Fuck. Harry’s stomach drops. He’s been so wrapped up in figuring out what to do about the bell that he hadn’t heard anything. Or maybe Draco’s just really quiet. Come to think of it, he
“Blibbering Humdingers are just as ferocious under the right circumstances. Though they do manage to fly in a straight line”—she leaned in conspiratorially—“which is more than I can say for Justin Finch-Fletchley and Pansy Parkinson at the moment.”
Draco laughed again, grasping at the fleeting straws of post-orgasmic relaxation. “Agreed.” He tucked himself into his pants and zipped his jeans over them. “Must’ve been an O on your cocksucking NEWTs.”
He breathes in deep and lets it out again, willing himself to stay cool in every sense of the word. He pushes himself forward again, remembering to tuck his knees, rolling into nothingness and hoping his momentum will be enough. He can feel the cloak begin to catch on his shoe and pushes himself through the turn even more quickly, righting himself before he can stumble.
Out that door you know it’s cold and damp and when you walk through it you find it’s hushed and hard, too. You don’t like hard. There’s too much hard out there. You come here for easy.
Pansy was right when she said I need someone who understands that world. It may be out of vogue right now, but the old families never lose their place for long. To let Potter deprive me of that is a mistake I’d spend the rest of my life paying for. To give that all away for a youthful infatuation – foolish at best.
“No. I tried, I really did. I mean, I knew he was an arse at first, but then I got to know him, and he’s really good at his job, and he’s funny even though he probably wouldn’t say so, and he can be kind to people, even though most people probably don't know that, and he understands things. The war, I mean. He really understands it, and what it’s like after. And I thought maybe we were getting on a bit better, that he was opening up some. And I thought after we –” Potter stops abruptly. “Um.”
“Thank you,” Draco said. He gripped the glass and took as slow a sip as he could get away with. “I appreciate that. And if I may be candid, I’ve enjoyed working with you for the same reasons. I haven’t had to lie to you, or hide things. Or, I have in the past, in the war, but not in ages. You value honesty. I think you did then, too, even if I never had the chance to know it. It’s meaningful, that. Not everyone does. And I hope you’ll keep being honest with me.”
“No, true, but I’ve had my fair share.” He laughs again. “You know, in Defense once, Sirius defeated my boggart by turning it from a moon into an appallingly accurate estimation of Professor Flitwick’s ghostly bum.”
There was no reason for Draco to help with them. Just a bunch of old family photos, most likely, and Potter would want privacy for those. As is quite reasonable. It’s rude for Draco to be curious about what Potter would have looked like as a small child or what he did with his friends, or who else might appear prominently in the photos next to him, their arms around one another.
Draco went faster, and faster still, felt his balls tighten as he hit the back of Potter’s mouth and pulled out again over that glorious fucking tongue. Always, Potter took him, and when he looked down to see Potter leaning forward, when he felt Potter’s nails rake over his hip, it was almost too much. And then it was, tension gathering in his legs and pooling in his spine until he couldn’t, didn’t want to, keep it back any longer. He tugged Potter’s hair as a warning, as the sort of basic manners that didn’t desert a gentleman even in moments of abandon, but Potter either didn’t notice or didn’t care. He hummed, and hollowed his cheeks, and his eyelids fluttered as Draco shot down his throat with a shouted expletive.
Galder’s face fell “Galder is sorry, Master, Galder is not knowing. We is all in the kitchen during big dinners. Mistress Pansy and Master Greg is not having ice in their rooms before dinner and they is after, but Galder is not knowing when.”
Again. I drive into him, he arches and grabs my arse and lets out one of those beautiful, unearthly, moans. And again, and again. I’m sweating too, now, can feel it as our bodies slide together, but no power on this earth could stop me from pounding into this unbelievable arse.
One of the benefits of living—staying, Draco reminded himself—at Malfoy Manor was that even after so many years he knew it like the back of his hand.
“I hope,” Draco tried, not especially pleased to find nervousness fighting sadness for chest territory, “that it was okay for you, as well.”
Draco glanced at the mobile, kept his reports firmly in hand, walked around Potter, and took a seat in his office chair.
Harry takes a step closer. He doesn’t get any further before his alleyway companion turns to look at him.
But Pansy prevailed, and now it’s a regular thing. Draco knows the next step is Granger and Weasley, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t dreading it, and not in the “useful fear” sort of way. But when Harry first raised the question, he didn’t say, “eventually.” He said “I’m a bit worried,” and, “dinner, first Thursday of next month?”
Robards chewed his lip. “I’ll keep you updated on everything that happens from now on. You have my word, Erin. I don’t want to sow distrust between us.”
Draco felt his heartbeat speed up. Panic. He couldn’t breath. His throat had closed up, Luke was before him, but he looked so much like Draco’s father-
Harry nodded, and started opening cabinets haphazardly. He supposed he should give Draco space. It wasn’t exactly like they were
“I won’t, don’t worry. I’ll just say I think Hermione’s right about moving out or something, and we’ll start looking for places.”
“You Gryffindors always career head first into battle. There are other ways to fight, you know. They’re just a little trickier to coordinate.”
“Narcissa Malfoy was not a completely good person. No one is. But she was kind, and I think that matters quite significantly.”
They began to approach the rock that Azkaban was perched on. It was surrounded by a thin mist, and the air seemed to be getting colder.
Yeah. That should be easy enough. Just convince them that he'd suddenly had a change of heart, and moving out was a good idea. Not suspicious at all.
They didn’t need to elaborate. The dreams were common, and they both knew what the other had gone through, what the other was still going through. It wasn’t a matter of saying, “I’m sorry, that’s awful,” it was simply a mutual understanding.
Draco glanced around. Most of the senior aurors had put on a facade of confidence, but the trainees all had the same expression of terror.
“It still hurts. All the time. I guess I just… push it away.” Harry pulled her towards him, and she sobbed into his shoulder. “We all have different ways of dealing with things, Hermione. It doesn’t make you weaker.”
Draco noticed that one of the Aurors slipped outside after them, too, leaning against the wall next to the front door.
"Mother," he said, and there was a moment before both of them seemed to break and move towards each other.
Andromeda raised an eyebrow, but didn’t question him further. “Well, good to see a familiar face. Let’s get inside now, shall we?”
Harry undid the clasp as Draco turned to look at him, and their eyes met. Harry wondered for a moment why he had never noticed how many different colours were in his eyes.
“Uh, what should I do…?” Pansy asked slowly. “I don’t work at the Ministry. I’d probably be more of a hindrance than a help.”
“Because it’s way better than wizarding ones. Wizards don’t even have any gay bars that I know of, anyway. And it’s not like we’re here to make friends, Draco.”
“Alright, boys, I’m afraid we’ve got the dullest assignment - Malfoy, did you bring all the journals you had?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Stop being so dramatic. I came here to get laid.” Her eyes scanned the bar, and found a suitable subject. She gestured to the bartender.
Harry didn’t really know why, but he hadn’t even asked Robards if he could take time off. Hermione was right. He would probably say yes. But...
“Oi, you lovebirds going to join us?” George teased. Harry blushed, and Ginny rolled her eyes. They sat next to Ron and Hermione, and got started on the food.
Either he had happened to meet another wizard at a non-descript Muggle bar, or this man was a stalker.
The scene inside was brutal. Both Rex and Max’s bodies lay almost indistinguishable from each other on the ground, covered in blood and torn apart. They hadn’t just been killed with Avada Kedavra. They had been practically torn apart.
“Oh, hiya Harry! Hermione too! Good to see you both - I’m not sure if everyone’s decent, hold on-” he turned to call back into the apartment. “BOYS! HARRY AND HERMIONE’RE HERE! Right, come on in, then.”
“It’s alright, Draco.” There was no malice, or even hurt in Ivan’s tone. “I saw you talking with your colleague. It’s not fair to expect you to go out with me when you are in love with someone else.”
Draco jumped, and turned around to the window. An owl was tapping on it from outside. He took a deep breath to calm his heartbeat, and opened the window.
“Anyway. Thanks, Harry. I think Mum and Dad are going to sell the house now, and… well, everything’s going to be a lot easier.”
“You’re welcome, Harry.” She broke away from the hug, and looked directly into his eyes. “I’ll always be here for you. You know that, right?”
"Great take it out- oh, fuck-" she had tried to open a packet of peas, only for it to spill everywhere.
Harry paused. He opened his mouth to speak, closed it when nothing came out, took a deep breath, and managed to speak. “I’m sorry for… you know. Shouting at you. I know you were genuinely trying to help, and I shouldn’t have said what I said.”
A paper plane soared next to them, and gently prodded Robards in the head. He frowned, and opened it, then frowned some more. “Sorry, boys, I’ve got to attend to this - Potter, can I trust you to, er… keep everything in order?” He gave Harry a meaningful look, unsubtly glancing towards Malfoy.
Two large, curving staircases were at the back of the room, leading up to a landing with a second set of large doors leading to the rest of the house. To their left, the living room, and to their right, the dining room, with kitchen and scullery hidden behind it.
Potter shrugged. “I just suddenly remembered the Triwizard Tournament, and how I’ve been pretty good at summoning spells since then, and I figured you would have a few old brooms in a shed somewhere.”
Draco stood there for a whole longer, before quietly folding the letter back up, and sliding it into the envelope.
Inside the cells, Harry thought he recognised some of the faces, but it was difficult to tell. They were all cowered in the corners of their cells, or pacing up and down, their faces thin and withered.
Kingsley wrapped up the lesson soon after that, and they headed home. Hermione was still living with her parents in London, but Ron and Harry apparated back to the Burrow with Mr Weasley.
Her eyes widened. “Fuck, I’m so sorry - I’ve just been getting takeout, I haven’t cooked since Ron left-”
He sighed, tapping his fingers impatiently. It was only 10:17, and he was already going insane. How was he supposed to do nothing for two whole days?
Potter pulled out of the dive milliseconds before he would have crashed, perfectly executing the move. Draco didn't do so badly himself, dismounting his broom elegantly.
“Harry,” Granger said as they walked in and he went over to her, starting a whispered conversation. Draco stood at the edge of the group. He looked around and spotted Weasley standing slightly aside from Granger, looking distinctly downtrodden.
“Yeah. He said I’m not my father, and that I chose to help people, and that makes me a good person.”
Harry tried to think of an appropriate response, but it felt like his brain was wading through hardening concrete.
Harry knew it was a dangerous distance to apparate, but he didn’t care. He felt the breath being squeezed out of his lungs as he, Draco and all their belongings contorted to land inside Amyra’s house.
She sighed, and looked away from him. "I'm struggling too, Harry. I love you. At least, I think I do. But I'm not so sure if you love me anymore."
“I put it on the whole apartment, not just him. Means I can play my music loudly without number 9 complaining.”
“...asked Potter to report back to me regularly on Malfoy’s actions,” Robards was saying, “I’d like you to do the same, Granger. I’m not saying that he can’t be trusted, but with everything going on right now… well, it’s better to be safe than sorry.”
They apparated into the entrance hall of the Ministry, and quickly made their way up to the Auror offices. As Robards had said, a group of Aurors was already there, waiting.
“Well, I… Robards came to me and said you’d applied. He asked for my judgement. I told him you weren’t, you know. Evil.”
“Will you check up on Blaise? We should stay in touch so we know how it’s going on his end,” Harry said.
Draco jerked upright from where he had been bent over the journals. “Uh, yeah,” he called back to Pansy.
He didn't want to tell Potter that the reason he couldn't cast one wasn't because the spell was too difficult. Maybe he was arrogant, but Draco was a good wizard.
“Fred,” Harry said, his voice cracking. Hermione moved to stand next to him, and squeezed his hand. “You?”
She stopped in front of a cell. "Here's Narcissa Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy is in the high security zone."
"I'm not as fucking useless as you think I am, Hermione. It's not like your relationship is going any better than mine anyway. Don't use this as an excuse not to talk to Ron because you're 'too busy helping me'. I can handle my own fucking life, okay?"
However, none of them had done their N.E.W.Ts. Even the students who had (almost) completed their seventh year hadn’t written exams.
“Listen, you might not believe me - most people didn’t - but I really had nothing to do with my parents. I despised them. I never met any of their friends, or talked to anyone they tried to introduce me to. I was in Slytherin, but I stayed away from the Death Eater wannabes. I had nothing to do with these attacks, I promise you. But,” she said, and paused, her eyes landing on Draco, “my parents kept journals. I got everything after they died; I’m their only child. I haven’t read all of the journals. The parts I did read made me sick. But you’re welcome to have a look at them. Maybe it’ll help you. I don’t know.”
They walked down a quaint, cobbled road for a few more minutes before arriving at a small cottage house. It looked like the opposite kind of place that one would expect to find dark magic and Muggle killings.
“I used to be,” Draco said, and he pulled up his sleeve, revealing the Dark Mark tattooed onto his skin.
Hermione shook her head. “It’s not enough, Harry. That letter doesn’t explicitly say that they framed him. And I doubt people are going to trust Malfoy rather than two of our best Aurors - most people don’t think he should have even been exonerated, let alone allowed to be an Auror.”
“No problem.” Harry left her room, closing the door behind him, and checked his phone. Nothing. He had messaged Draco the previous day, asking him to meet them at the Ministry at 8, but there was no response.
“I’ll go,” Draco said suddenly, surprising Harry. Draco blushed when the three of them looked at him expectantly. “I mean, I don’t mind doing it alone. I know the place better than anyone else. I lived there, after all.”
Harry nodded. “Well, actually he was framed…” He explained the whole story, starting with the funeral. Hermione looked down at the floor the entire time, and Ron looked everywhere in the room except in her direction.
“Yeah. I’m tired of his shit too. I’m so sick of them acting like the war isn’t over, acting like their parents are going to come home and everything will go back to how it used to be.”
Draco pulled a large, ornate, golden key from his pocket. “Just a lock, Potter. I suppose you’ve heard of one of those before?”
“Don’t even think about reaching for your wands. I’ll have stupefied you before you can even get it out your pocket.”
He rolled his eyes as the golden fucking trio walked into the elevator. Hermione said, “Good morning, Draco.” Business as usual. Ron gave him an awkward nod. Potter opened his mouth, frowned, and settled for a strange half-smile.
“Do you remember when my parents kicked me out, and for like, a month, I pretended that I was happy about it, because I’d hated them anyway, and I was glad they’d kicked me out because I was gonna leave anyway.”
* [from the Harry Potter wiki page]: "Crouch and his parents hatched a plot under which Crouch's mother would take his place in Azkaban, using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise herself. She died and was buried in Azkaban, with the result that the wizarding world believed that Crouch himself was dead."
"Uh," he said, but before he could continue, a gruff voice from behind him said, "Who is it, Rex?" And a short, stocky man with red hair and beard walked up behind him, putting a hand on his shoulder.
“Stay, boy. We’ll get out of here soon,” Draco told Leo. He barked happily, and licked Draco’s hand. Draco couldn’t help but smile.
“Shut up, you know I’m right. And now, you get the number of this dude who just so happens to have had his hometown destroyed by your father. Maybe Freud had a point.”
He knocked on her door, loudly. "Amyra?" He called, and he heard Padfoot bark. "Amyra!" He knocked again. After a few more seconds, the door swung open, and Amyra stood there in a dressing gown.
Robards accuses Draco and his mother of doing something similar to what Barty Crouch Jr did to escape Azkaban. Barty Crouch Jr. in the movies was played by David Tennant, and David Tennant also played Hamlet, so the chapter title is part of a quote from Hamlet: "Thou know'st 'tis common; all lives must die, / Passing through nature to eternity."
“Right. You’re just looking for anything talking about the ‘Purists’, or similar terrorist-type organisations. Got it?”
After a couple of stomach churning minutes in the lift, they stepped out into the corridor leading to the Auror offices, and Harry practically sprinted to the end of it, bursting into Robards’ office, breathing heavily.
Usually, aurors were chosen by a much more rigorous screening process. Only those with the highest marks - generally Outstanding in almost all subjects, and definitely nothing below an Exceeds Expectations, were chosen for training. Then, they were put into the auror academy for two years and trained before they took a final exam, with written, and practical elements, as well as a psychological screening, to finally become an auror.
"Well, I…" Harry trailed off, unable to think of an excuse. He wasn't even sure why he hadn't told her.
Pansy threw her hands in the air. “Fine. Fine! But if we get caught, you’re dealing with all the consequences. And if he puts so much as
He unlocked his owl’s cage, and attached the letter to her leg, before opening the window and sending her off.
“Hmm, let me think. The Purists… Purists, Purists, Purists. Oh! I remember… But I’m not going to tell you, after you’ve been so rude to me.”
“I- I- God, Harry, how do you do it?” She sobbed, burying her face in her hands, “How do you stay so strong all the time? Doesn’t- doesn’t it still hurt?”
“Before we get down to business, I just wanted to say good work for the past ten days, Potter. I know everything’s rather rushed at the moment, but you are handling it very well.”
"Malfoy. Have you finished your reports yet?" Hermione stood over him, looking distinctly annoyed that she had been designated the task of speaking to him.
"I know. I'm sorry. I wish we could - really, I do. But… I have to try twice as hard at work just for them to trust me. They all think I'm plotting something. It's a miracle I even got in, I have no idea how it happened. If I do even one thing out of line, I'm screwed."
It was a fairly short broom ride to the venue for the funeral, but Harry still regretted choosing to go by broom when he realised that if his hair was messy before, it was an owl’s nest once he got off the broom.
“Oh, Freud. Sigmund Freud. He was this Muggle dude that said we’re all either attracted to people who look like our parents, or look like the opposite of our parents. He was a bit of a twat, really.”
Rex shook his head. “Sorry, but as I said, I’ve been living as a muggle. Haven’t spoken to another wizard in years.”
He looked over, and Potter made eye contact with him. Neither of them had the usual look of mutual dislike, however. They both seemed to understand that the situation called for that to be put aside.
“We… we went to see Narcissa first, and we found out… Lucius had tried to escape, and take Narcissa with him, but she refused, and he- he hit her. Then we saw Lucius, and he kept taunting Malfoy, and I think Malfoy just… snapped.”
“I’m terribly sorry to interrupt, but we have to investigate this body,” Robards said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the coffin.
He was vaguely aware of other people entering the room and seating themselves on the rows of seats around the room, and of someone speaking, and then Robards’ voice slipped into his mind again.
Draco turned, to see the Auror that had followed them out of the house pointing her wand at him. They all froze.
“It’s not like the place is booby-trapped, or anything.  My parents might have been evil, but they weren’t insane.”
But, everyone who had fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and had finished school had been given an opportunity to be an auror, if they wished. Most people had said yes.
“So, as I said, all hands on deck. You all know your assignments. We’re not in the field unless we get some more, er, bad news. Malfoy, Potter, with me. Dismissed.”
“May we come in?” Robards said, “we’re from the Ministry of Magic. We have a couple of questions if you don’t mind?”
Harry scowled, and looked out the window. It was a bright, sunny day, and they were all holed up in Harry’s room. He had called them there to tell them about everything that had happened on his trip.
He heard a door softly click open, and soft footsteps started to grow louder. He could just make out Potter’s figure walking towards the front door.
(there's a bit in this chapter that might not make sense if you don't remember exactly what happens in the books, so i've marked it with an asterisk, and there'll be an explanation at the bottom of the chapter)
'The gang' had devolved to just the three of them. Draco, Blaise and Pansy. Crabbe and Goyle had begun to separate themselves even before the Battle, and most of the other people who hung out with them had only done it for status.
“No, I should have listened to you,” Harry said, leaning against the wall of the corridor. “Well, I guess we can only hope that Robards does the investigation properly.”
“Uncle Dwaco,” Teddy said, grinning broadly. His shock of blue hair suddenly began to change to silvery blond.
“Don’t mind the hair, he’s in a habit of doing it to everyone he sees.” There was a loud beeping noise from the kitchen. Andromeda swore loudly. “Won’t be a minute,” she said, sweeping her long, curly grey hair into a bun before bustling off to the kitchen.
“Listen, Harry…” She sighed, and sat down next to him on the bed. “I think I’m going to break up with Ron.”
“Are you rested?” Robards asked, and then without waiting for a response, “Good. Now, we’ve prepared the Veritaserum, so the trial is nearly over. Come on.”
“Yeah, but… Maybe they were as clueless to what was in the safe as we are. They could have just tried to stop us as a precaution, you know? Or they could even have done it to throw us off course. I mean, if they really didn’t want us to get it, why only send two people? And why only let the people retrieve it as we were doing it? They’ve had plenty of time to do it before now.”
He materialised in the auror office, where Kingsley stood, along with most of the other aurors. He joined the group.
They tumbled out of one of the fireplaces in the Ministry, Harry barely taking time to brush himself off before walking as fast as he could towards the lifts, Hermione close behind.
“It’s, uh, it’s nice,” Harry said, noncommittally. He didn’t know the first thing about finding an apartment.
The door opened next to her, and the other Aurors filed out, Draco’s mother’s body floating behind them. They all had their wands out, too.
“Where is she?” Harry said immediately, the sound of his voice and the apparition making Robards, Ron and Hermione jump.
Despite his initial surprise, he was very relieved that Andromeda was there too. He had been dreading standing around a bunch of Draco’s family and friends, who all no doubt hated him, with no one to talk to.
A silvery-blue stag billowed out from the tip of his wand, dancing around them for a few seconds before walking on the surface of the water next to them, keeping perfect pace with the boat.
Harry frowned, but didn’t want to fight, so shrugged. “Yeah.” He took her trunk and they walked inside.
She shook her head. “No. I asked Dean, and apparently he’s just stayed in his room since it happened.”
A large, shaggy dog bounded into the room and collided with Draco. He yelped, and was pushed onto the floor by the dog, which proceeded to lick his face.
Draco gathered up enough strength for a withering look in Potter’s direction, and flicked the light switch.
They had also travelled to Hungary, in maybe fifth or sixth year, also for his father’s work. And - if Draco remembered correctly - they had been near the border, and Draco’s father had disappeared for a few days for work, leaving him and his mother to sightsee-
Harry smiled, and took her hand. He had offered to pay, or at least contribute, as soon as Ginny had started talking about surgery, but as he had expected, the Weasleys had declined.
“I… I guess I haven’t been doing the greatest, at the moment,” Malfoy said, and Harry could tell he was deliberately avoiding eye contact.
Draco stared at Robards. He had been handcuffed to a chair in one of the smaller trial rooms in the Ministry, and left there alone for what felt like hours before Robards and Elarena finally came to speak to him.
Rex nodded, grimacing. “Ah. I see why you’d be comin’ te me, then.” He sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Listen, I never knew what my parents was doin’. When they got taken to Azkaban an’ all, my aunt came an’ told me all that’d happened. I lived with her a few years, ‘til I was eighteen, then I came back to the farm.” He looked down at his hands. “After what they did… I swore I’d never use magic again. I settled down ‘ere, met my husband, and put all of those awful things behind me.”
it’s about doing the right thing.” Harry stood up, his eyes lighting up. “And we can ask Dean, Seamus and Neville for help, too. All the old DA crowd who became Aurors!”
“Hey!” She grinned, walking towards them, lugging her trunk behind her. Harry didn’t move for a couple seconds, debating the socially acceptable thing to do, and then moved forwards.
His laughter was hysterical, filling the room with a cold, malicious sound. Harry felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up.
He felt the familiar feeling of his air being pushed out of his lungs, and his whole body being compressed, before the feeling stopped, and he opened his eyes.
Harry almost jumped at the use of his first name. He looked around, and Draco was looking at him almost pleadingly.
After a few seconds of discomfort, they opened their eyes inside the clinically clean entrance hall of St Mungos.
“Come in, come in,” she said, ushering him inside. “Sorry about the mess, I left Teddy alone while I was cooking, and, well…” she gestured at the many other toy dragons strewn across the floor.
"I mean, I…" Harry felt like whatever he said would be the wrong thing to say. He opted for the truth. "I, uh, yeah."
Harry and Draco did so, not making eye contact. Harry glanced over at Malfoy, seeing his Nimbus 2001. It seemed like a lifetime ago that Malfoy's dad had bought Nimbus 2001s for the entire Slytherin team, before losing to Gryffindor anyway. Harry smiled, letting out a quiet chuckle.
“I…” she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. “I have to face my fears someday.” Her voice was shaking.
He wasn’t sure why he had expected it to look different - all the bushes and trees were enchanted  to self-prune, and the house itself was stuffed with enough preservation magic to last a century, but still.
Draco paused. Harry tried, unsuccessfully, to decipher his expression. “Yes, Potter. I got your message.”
Potter stepped forward, and looked at the tag around the dog’s neck. “Leo,” he said, and patted the dog, “he’s a St Bernard.”
Doing nothing at all was worse, he decided, because then he was alone with his thoughts. And since he’d kept himself insanely busy for the last week, he had a lot of thoughts to catch up on. Most of them were unpleasant.
Harry looked over at Hermione, who was clenching her fists - he could tell she was angry about the house elf, but was managing to restrain herself.
“Yeah, and I can’t cook. We know this.” She gestured to the counter, where ten more packets of ramen were in a pile.
The air was silent except for the occasional sound of an owl. Draco could practically hear the sound of Harry stewing on something that was bothering him.
“I’m so happy for you Draco,” she said, as they walked towards the coffee room. “After everything, you deserve happiness.”
He had been injured countless times since they were kids, but this had been the worst since the war. He couldn’t imagine his life without Harry.
Draco looked at the baby again and hesitantly took a step forward. He took the chance to observe his cousin. The baby’s hair was neon but changed to a white-blond colour as soon as Draco stepped forward. His hair colour, Draco realised belatedly as he felt his eyes widen in surprise.
went together, showing their support for each other as a house. Ara lead them, standing at their head.
Dudley looked at her incredulously. "Knowing the weird shite that you get yourself into," he said, "You're probably part of them."
The weaslette raised her shot in the air. “I’ll do it,” she grinned maniacally at Potter. “You really shouldn’t have put dye in my shampoo Harry,” she said shaking her head at him. “I hope you’ll enjoy spilling your secrets.”
“Esteemed members of the wizengamot,” she called out, her wand pressing gently at her throat, “We are gathered here today to witness the trial of Draco Lucius Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy, do you consent to be interrogated under Veritaserum?”
Ron had held that record until he quit training to join George as a businessman at the shop a few months earlier, and the mantle had been passed down to Harry, who held the title proudly. They were a close bunch and casual touching was nothing out of the ordinary for them.
Harry came to the living room a few minutes later, flopping onto one of the plush armchairs that they kept in their living rooms.
Draco could see the bandaging around his torso. He knew that the cuts must have been healed over by now and that the bandages were just to keep him steady, but he still worried.
"I told you to stay away from me," he growled.  Ara could tell that he was trying to sound menacing, but the wetness in his voice ruined the effect.
“Today is certainly a day of surprises,” Draco said, still surprised. “I don’t even know what to say, Harry.”
It had taken a while for him to realize that home was a feeling, not a place. He had found his home. In the crowded meetings of the department that he was head of, in the occasional lectures he gave at Hogwarts.
“On second thoughts, there’s only fifteen minutes left. You guys can leave, just be ten minutes early for class next week. Arianna, stay behind please.”
Like using Accio to summon a knife through someone’s body, or using wingardium leviosa to levitate a heavy mass to crush someone.
It was a white plaster, stuck over the side of his hip. Draco couldn’t see what was under it and ran a finger over it lightly, the material scratchy.
There were bad nights, though. When she woke up with a gasp, heart pounding, she sat up and switched on the small lamp next to her and read until her eyes burned, too scared to go back to sleep. But there was Draco, knocking on her door and slipping in, taking the book from her and reading to her softly until she fell asleep against him.
The traditions never stopped. They all went to the burrow on Sundays, as many people as possible coming along with their kids. On Thursdays, Ara's friends all came to their place for dinner, some of them with toddlers in their arms.
Ara exhaled through her nose. "You raised me like a pig for slaughter. You criticize everything that I am as if you are a saint. You overlook the safety of the Slytherin students. You have tried to manipulate me again, and again. By your answer, I am assuming that you will take me along with you."
Lily shook her head. “She saw Al yesterday when he came here for you. He told her that it wasn’t safe for any of us to return.” Draco relaxed when he realized that they were talking about Arianna.
The Dark Lord was skilled in torture, so much so that when he was done with you, you would long for something as sweet as pain, beg for something as merciful as death.
A few hours later found him leaning tiredly against the porcelain wall in the medium-sized bathroom that he and Longbottom shared.
When the Hogwarts letters came, they both decided not to go. Draco chose to complete his studies at home. Ara took Kingsley's offer and joined the Aurors.
When Snape's drawling voice filled the Great Hall, demanding to reveal Aralynn, Ara pushed herself forward. But in this version, Pansy Parkinson was the first one to stand next to her, glaring defiantly up at their headmaster. Slowly, the upper years of all the houses broke away to protect the younger years in a show of solidarity that Hogwarts had never seen before. But none of them stood in front of her, no. She had Pansy and Ginny on either side of her and an army of students at her back. She wouldn't let anyone else stand in her way.
She was friends with Astoria, they had both worked at the creature regulation department together in their early twenties. They had drifted apart when they transferred departments a few years later but became friends again when their children became close.
When they first started training, it had taken all of five minutes of watching Harry and Draco duel in a simulation to pair them up indefinitely.
And when she went back to Number 4, her belongings were kept in her room. The Dursleys saw her off at King's Cross, but it was only Dudley who she hugged.
When they escaped on a dragon, hastily casting drying charms as they changed, Ara spoke, Hufflepuff's cup burning her hip from where she'd shoved it into her waistband as they left.
Draco had seen outside memories of him and Harry dueling, and he had to admit, they made a stunning pair to watch. Harry's raw power in magic and Draco's fleet-footed grace were unmatched among the trainees.
This was the worst Harry had ever been injured, though. He had taken a sectumsemptra to the chest while protecting Draco. They had anticipated a dangerous stakeout for the high priority smuggling case that they had been assigned a week prior.
" she added at Daphne's gleeful expression. "No, you aren't allowed to tell anyone. It's not a big deal," she said, lips quirking up at the scowl Draco directed at her.
Harry, who hadn’t grown up with money, still felt slightly uncomfortable when people spent money on him.
Ara slowly walked backward, closing the door in front of her and reapplying the wards with a distracted wave of her hand. Ginny looked at them questioningly but Ara shook her head mutely, dragging both of them to the next empty compartment. She sat down on its floor.
Potter walked towards Draco’s group of people, who were still sitting on the ground. “You guys will duel next week. For today I want you guys to take out your textbooks or notebooks and make note of today’s lesson. Next week will be more intense, so I hope you guys come prepared.”
"I've got to go to the prefect's compartment," she said apologetically to Ginny and Luna. Ron and Hermione had left a few minutes ago, but Ara was reluctant to leave.
Ron still carried basilisk fangs with him in a pocket in his wand holster. Hermione reached her hands into her pockets every few minutes and rolled her fingers around what Ara knew was Dittany. Blaise winced whenever he heard a loud noise, his hands coming up to cover his ears as he closed his eyes and counted to ten.
She was nervous for Hogwarts, sure. But she was also excited. All her older cousins had gone to Hogwarts before her. She, Hugo, and Lissa were the only ones left. She was the third youngest of the Weasley clan, Hugo, and Lissa being the only ones younger than her.
Draco was a senior auror, Ron was one of the main co-owners of one of the most successful businesses in Britain, and Hermione was Minister of Magic.
Draco was impressed as he watched Potter change stances and wand grips as he explained them, his daughter firing off spells every time he changed position, perfectly coordinated with each other.
Draco gripped Harry’s hip to stop himself from falling and felt plaster under his hands. He froze, tilting his head further downwards and pushing Harry’s waistband down until he could see what his hand came in contact with.
“You aided numerous death eaters when they wanted to enter Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry,” she said, “Were you still a student when this happened?”
“Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Potter,” the interrogator said, and Potter nodded at her before walking back up to his seat, footsteps echoing in the silence of the courtroom. She looked at Draco before speaking. “The wizengamot shall keep in mind Mr. Potter’s testimony in the matter of Draco Malfoy. The court will now discuss Mr. Malfoy’s punishment for his crimes.”
With one glance to his mother and her sister, he followed Potter, awkwardly shoving his hands into his pockets. He opened his mouth to say something but he didn’t know what to say.
“At least two. I was always lonely in the manor, and even though any child of ours would never grow up lonely,” he inclined his head at the many children and pregnant women of their family, “I still think it’ll be nice.”
He had ended up looking down by the end of his speech, not sure how she would react, so he was startled when he looked up to see her less than a foot away from him.
Ara held her hand up sheepishly and willed her ring to become visible. "So you know how Sirius Black was friends with my parents? He's also my godfather, which makes me his heir by magic."
Potter stood in front of the class, taking in all of them with his eyes before clasping his hands together.
Draco kept to himself and his few friends for the most part. He had aided in the torture of enough of his classmates that everyday conversation was
“But I can tell you what I know. She was ridiculously clumsy for someone who was an auror. She could have changed her appearance to make her the most beautiful woman on earth, but she wanted to make people laugh so she changed her features to match her inside.”
The first of September was always sentimental for their family. For Harry and Draco, it was symbolic.
She sniffed delicately, in an obvious imitation of her Pansy. “You better. I’ll talk to you next week Uncle Draco.”
Ara had spoken to them, and given Dudley a pass from her Department so that his family could enter Diagon Alley without her.
Draco sighed exasperatedly as he and Harry entered the corridor where the kitchens were. He reached a finger out and ticked the pear, which Draco still found weird even after two years of knowing about the entrance.
The months flew by, and soon Ara was done with training, having taken the accelerated program. She left early in the morning, often only pausing to kiss Draco and ruffle Teddy's hair before she was out of the door. Draco passed his newt's with all outstandings, and he joined a Potion's program for young people who wanted to pursue a mastery. When June rolled around, Ara and Sirius spoke up over breakfast.
They looked startlingly like Harry at the moment, with light brown skin and dark hair, eyes shifting between green and amber every few minutes.
Harry had written the exams for both of them as well, just because he had enough of constantly fighting crime and wanted to do some research and detective work as well. Both the auror and the ID had a reasonable amount of detective and research work, so he would be okay with getting in either.
Draco felt a sudden rush of affection for the man sitting next to him. He reached over and put his hands on top of Harry's, not trusting himself to speak.
Ara often sat quietly in the lab where Draco brewed on her days off. The twins were at preschool now, and both she and Draco would be turning thirty soon. "Do you ever wonder what would have happened if I hadn't confronted you in fifth year?" she asked one day. It was almost exactly a year from when she accepted the Head Auror position.
The mist took the shape of a small bird before disappearing, to find his mother and aunt, he assumed. That was strange, Draco mused, last he heard, Potter’s Patronus took the shape of a stag.
“Ginny told me that she doesn’t want to turn into a bridezilla like Hermione is. When I get married, I’m just going to elope.”
“I know she would have liked it if I was there but I just got a new case, and-” Harry paused, turning to Draco. “Wait,
Scorpius scoffed lightly but leaned forward and hugged him anyway, long arms looping around his shoulders. "You mean subordinates to order around?"
"Can I use one of those pensieve thingies to see the look on his face too?" Dudley asked her in July.
A month into the holidays she and Ginny decided to meet up in muggle London. Ron and the twins came with her, and she took them around muggle London. In return, they took her to the Burrow the week after.
The next day, Granger caught up to her when she was walking to charms. "Thank you for coming to see me yesterday," she said nervously. "Why do you call me Granger?"
A few minutes Potter came out of his shower with only a towel wrapped around his waist and Draco pointedly looked the other way while Potter got dressed. He heard Potter walking and deemed it safe to look back up, grabbing another pamphlet from the side table.
It was crazy for her to think about it. She would be one of the last of her numerous cousins to go until the next generation of kids were born. They were split up among all the houses, the Weasley clan.
Ron had brought Rose in to say goodbye to Astoria, and she had held Scorpius’s hand as her parents left to the room outside. Their children shared an extremely close bond, and Rose had been Scorpius’s major source of comfort after Astoria had passed away a few days later.
Draco flushed, and Ara grabbed Sirius in a headlock, both of them toppling to the floor in the process. Sirius' elbow pressed into her side as they fell down.
He had often felt restless and fidgety and ended up in the hospital more than he was comfortable with.
If the first kiss made him feel warmth, then this one made heat start to pool in his stomach. Pretty inappropriate for the situation, but completely out of his control. Not when Harry kissed him like
Draco knew that Harry would never let Teddy feel unloved. It wasn’t hard to realize that all of these feelings stemmed from the approaching anniversary of the war.
Draco had expected as much and put down the asphodel that he had been powdering for their potion to listen to him.
Scorpius stood up. "Wait, you're actually going to search for him? Harry Potter? He hasn't been seen in Magical Britain since I started at Hogwarts. What makes you think he'll come to help us out?"
"Good," he said, folding his hands on top of the table. "Now I won't lie to either of you, the situation doesn't look good for any of us. It is necessary that we all work together. I trust you both to place differences aside and work together."
A few minutes later, he and his mother stood up and he realized that Potter was still standing there, politely looking in the opposite direction for their reunion.
The head boy told her that Malfoy had turned down the prefect's position, and Dumbledore had given it to Blaise instead.
He didn't turn around when Draco walked in but he could see the way that Harry’s shoulders stiffened when he undoubtedly heard his footsteps.
They landed in their joint office that they had been using since they were assigned each other as partners a year earlier, and rushed to the Head Auror’s office for debriefing.
They stopped in front of his room. “I’ll owl Andromeda and Narcissa. Let them know that you’re coming, yeah?” Harry asked, rubbing the back of his neck.
. For more than just betraying her parents. He had slept in the same bed as Ron for so long and Ara didn't trust him at all.
All the furniture had been pushed back to the walls so they could sit down comfortably on the carpet to play. Potter sat on the ground, leaning against the sofa, effortlessly smiling and talking to Luna and the weaslette, who he had casually slung an arm around.
Now that their eldest daughter had left, he felt a sort of wistful nostalgia that he felt whenever he noticed one of his kids, nieces, or nephews looking older.
Harry grinned down at her; all tiredness wiped away from his face as he lifted his niece in all but blood up in the air. He twirled her around, and set her down on the ground, bending down to her height.
Molly would Graduate this year, and then it was Dominique, Rose, and then Louis two years after that.
“You told me all of that,” Harry said, long used to Draco’s antics. “And I know Mione wouldn’t let us go somewhere where gay sex is illegal,”
"I have never felt that much fear in my life. I've lived with Dark Lords and been under that curse myself," Harry flinched slightly, "But I have never, ever been that terrified. Fuck, Harry, I don't know what I would have done if you didn't make it." He scrubbed a hand over his face.
She saw a few students look nervous and added. "For anyone whose gender doesn't match their sex assigned at birth, you may stay in your preferred dormitory. For anyone non-binary, we have a gender-neutral dorm further down from the girl's dorms. We're here for you. First and second years may leave. Be in the common room by 7.30 am sharp."
And so they days passed. The next morning at breakfast Ara flipped eggs at the stove while Draco diced vegetables, and Andromeda fed Teddy.
“At least one, maybe two or three,” Harry answered. “Not for another year, though. I want to soak up every moment of bliss that we can get.”
When the last of them had been chased away, Ara made sure to scream a -"Coward!" at Snape's back. He did what he had to, but that didn't mean Ara forgave him.
Harry groaned. "Shut up, we have a stakeout tomorrow with the trainees and I can't go in like this. They look up to us, and I'd like to keep it that way, so
Potter shot her a dry look. “Because I’m her father, Maria. I’m not allowed to be her defence master.” Potter’s words confirmed Draco’s doubts. He held a dual mastery in Dueling and Defence.
The conversation had flowed freely after that, with Harry talking about Dobby, and Draco talking about his mother’s new charity that she was running from her home.
Harry took a deep breath before starting. “They were called the marauders. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. I’m sure you know who wormtail was,” he added.
By the time they had finished eating and were walking back to the rooms, it was early morning, the light slowly overtaking the darkness of the sky.
"Yes, actually," Ara said. "Malfoy, address the students after dinner, about what we discussed. I won't be there, so I'm trusting you to handle the students." She and the prefects had discussed over lunch that they would teach the students as per the previous year's defence curriculum, holding lessons for the entire year group once a week. That way, they could cover a year group for every day of the week.
When she woke up, cool dirt of the forest against her cheek, It was another daughter of the Blacks kneeling over her. "Draco," Narcissa had said urgently. "Is he alive?" When Ara breathed back an affirmative, the dark rejoiced at her death- because she did die. They just didn't know that she had come back.
that Draco had to laugh, pulling Harry up to his full height and resting his forehead on his shoulder.
Potter looked much older, with grey scattered throughout his hair and older features. He looked healthy and strong compared to the skinny, fidgety looking man who had left Britain Twenty-five years prior. His daughter looked a lot like the fiery redheaded Weasley that Draco remembered briefly greeting in the world cup that Hermione and Ron had gotten him tickets to a few years ago.
"I'm offended that you even need to think that, you tosser. You say that like we haven't been living together since we were nineteen," he said, grabbing the milk carton and putting it on the counter.
Draco’s lips tipped up in a smirk, leaning even closer, the tip of his nose touching Harry’s hip. He exhaled softly and knew Harry could feel it by the way he stiffened.
Percy's daughter, Molly, had been made prefect, and Cassy was well on her way to becoming Quidditch captain in her next year. She and Cory had aggressively lobbed a bludger at a student who said that Cassy couldn't play as well as the rest of the teammates because she was a girl, and Ara and Draco grinned at each other in the Quidditch stands.
Hermione was holding Dominique, Draco’s first godchild, as she spoke to Luna, who was pregnant and had started to show a short while ago.
Besides, if Hermione knew that he knew about Harry’s tattoo and didn’t tell her, she would be really,
It was excruciating, but Harry meant the world to Draco. He was going to be there in whatever way that Harry needed him.
"He loves you, you know," Draco nearly choked on his tea. Pansy's dark eyes glinted at him in amusement.
He only came two or three times, and Draco had been in his room the whole time, choosing to not confront him. Potter had a way of bringing out the worst in Draco. He had accompanied Draco's aunt for those times, and other than thanking him for testifying for him at the trials and saving him from the fire, they hadn't exchanged more than a few words of polite greeting.
She said something and he grinned widely at her, tugging affectionately at the ends of her bright red hair.
Draco noticed that his voice had taken on an American accent, with only a hint of British in some of his vowels. Well, Potter had lived in the United States for longer than he had lived in Britain, so Draco supposed that made sense.
Harry and Draco had been sitting in comfortable silence for nearly half an hour. It was nearing 2 in the morning, and Draco was sure that they would regret staying up so late when classes started, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
Harry had been with him every step of the way, and they had only grown closer when Ron had left training. He was beyond grateful to have Harry as a best friend and a roommate, though he did notice that he and Harry acted a little differently than the rest of their friends did together.
“I can practically hear your thoughts, Harry,” he opened his eyes to look at the man who was quickly becoming his closest friend. “You know you’re supposed to talk to someone when you don’t feel good.”
"Nicked it from his clothes. I'm doing it too. Since she's your cousin, I'm assuming you're polyjuicing into her right? I'll turn into Draco."
Harry winced as someone jostled his side, pushing past him to rush to the shower rooms. He tenderly touched his fingers to the left side of his abdomen, looking slightly startled when they came back bloody.
She still received the cloak, but she wasn't alone during Christmas. A brown-haired boy by the name of Theo Nott from her year had also stayed back. They spoke to each other in front of the fire that night, and so Ara felt no urge to go out and explore at night.
The faded grey of the dark mark stood out stark against the pale skin of his forearm. Scorpius' eyes widened slightly, taking in the sight in front of him. Draco kept his mark covered for the most part, and Scorpius hadn’t seen much of it, even though Draco had raised him. Draco looked up at his son.
He waited outside Gringotts for her, and when she came out (Heiress' ring on her right ring finger and pockets full of galleons), he bowed deeply, garnering them a few strange looks from people walking past.
Draco hoisted himself onto the counter and cracked the eggs, discarding the eggshells and beating the eggs in the bowl.
Potter nodded at him and waved his wand in the air, muttering the incantation for the Patronus charm and silvery mist formed from the end of his wand. He cleared his throat, “To Andromeda Tonks, we’re ready to leave, can you meet us at the doorway where we first came through from?”
She itched to do the same to the minster when he didn't believe her, but Sirius was shaking with barely concealed rage next to her, and she had had enough drama for one night. She wanted a dreamless sleep potion and at least twelve hours of sleep.
There was the entire Weasley clan, along with Hermione’s and the other Weasley Spouses and their parents.
"Drop the act," she walked a few steps closer and he looked down, turning back to the sink- away from her.
Harry and his mother were listed for Draco, though he had never been in a life-threatening situation after starting fieldwork, or a situation where they had needed to be called in to make decisions for him when he couldn’t.
Draco secretly hoped that both of them would end up in the same department. If they were, they were bound to be partners and there was no one else Draco would trust to have his back in a dangerous situation.
Ara pulled her into a one-armed hug. "You really are the brightest witch of your age," she said proudly. Ron nodded in agreement, the tips of his ears turning red as Hermione smiled at him.
After they had finished their antics, Harry had plopped down next to Draco, kissing him quickly before digging into his breakfast. It had been their first Valentine’s day together.
"Theo," Blaise murmured. He was always the calmer of the four of them. "You know you can tell us anything."
All of them went through the same training for the first year, and the last two would be specializing and shadowing senior members of the department they chose or were assigned to.
“Taking into account Mr. Potter’s testimony, we conclude that Mr. Malfoy will be under house arrest until September 1st, after which he will assist with the reparations in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and then attend the school to complete his education. He will report to the ministry once every two months until September 1999.”
Throughout all those years, the fresh air and flying had been one of the few things that calmed him down, that brought him peace. The wind whipping through his hair had brought back treasured memories of a golden childhood.
The hit-wizards got the most action. They were always at the ministry’s beck and call, and their work was mostly capturing criminals, rescuing people when they were in sudden danger, breaking up duels and fights in the public, that kind of work.
They had argued a bit about it, but Harry had insisted that Draco was his best friend and wouldn't take any rent, especially since he owned the building. This had been their compromise.
He knew what he had to do. “Granger,” he said. “I know I sent you that letter apologizing for everything I have ever done to you.” For once, he was thankful for the influence of alcohol, so he could say what had been bothering him for a while now.
"Professor," he called out. "I can't cut my ingredients or skin my shrivelfig until my arm heals." Ara barely refrained from scoffing. Malfoy's arm had been slashed by a hippogriff, but everyone knew it was healed by now.
Blaise clenched his jaw, something that would have gone unnoticed to most people, but Ara had shared a common room with him for six years. She raised an eyebrow at him questioningly. Blaise withdrew his hand from his pocket, and in his hand were a few white-blond hairs. Ara's breath hitched.
“Where are the parents?” He murmured, discreetly slipping some Wheezes pranks into the pocket of her robes as he released her.
Arianna nodded, thanking him once again before walking out, nearly stepping on Draco’s foot as she exited the room. Potter looked at the area Draco was standing at, brows furrowed. Draco felt a pang of nervousness in his stomach, uttering a wandless notice-me-not charm.
Draco closed the book he had been reading on Nicholas Flamel’s life. “Then you shouldn’t have bet on it, whatever the consequence is.”
Draco suppressed a shiver at the and he could almost feel Harry's smugness, but neither of them commented on it because of the seriousness of the situation.
But then she thought of Malfoy's cool lips against her knuckles and the way Blaise's shirt hiked up when he reached up and the way Theo's forearms flexed when he turned the pages of a book.
As he grew older, the white slowly started to shift to grey. The days of running through wildflowers turned to walking regally down the halls of school, sneering at those he thought below him.
It was only after she left that he picked it up. It was a picture of him and Lily, from when they were kids. A small note was attached to it, in Ara's handwriting.
Draco smiled into the kiss. He opened his mouth to say something but the roaring of the floo interrupted him.
He saw Kingsley Shaklebolt, who, Draco had heard, been made acting minister in the aftermath of the war and a young blonde who he didn’t recognize at the head of the courtroom.
When the letters came, she took Dudley with her to Diagon alley on the knight bus that Tracy had told her about. He was just as amazed by the colour and life as she had been her first time there.
When he went to the safe house, his mother had noticed, but without professional training, she didn’t know how she could help him.
He realized that he was staring and quickly diverted his attention to the two sisters, who were still quietly looking at each other, neither making the first move.
“I got this one two weeks ago,” it was the head of a stag, with lilies interwoven among them. He turned his arm back and pulled on his shirt. Draco looked pointedly in the opposite direction.
“You realize these things when you spend enough time with someone. You don’t know the little things about your parents, because no one ever told you. They glorify the dead, Harry. You don’t know their faults because everyone wants to have a perfect image of them in your mind. Teddy has you to tell him about Professor Lupin and my cousin.”
Harry smiled at their old instructor, “It’s Potter-Malfoy now.” Draco couldn’t help the wide smile that took over his face.  “And thank you, it means a lot.”
went for a movie with that muggle you were chatting up in that coffee shop. Was that when you got it?"
All the professors that had taught them, their DMLE instructors, Harry’s ID trainer, and defense master from when he had been an apprentice in the eighth year, Cassandra Reyes, his partner, and Althea, Harry’s ex-girlfriend from a few years ago.
Potter suddenly looked up. “I’ll send my Patronus to Narcissa and Andromeda,” he said, taking his wand out of its holster on his wrist. “Do you have any questions about traveling back, or your father’s trial tomorrow?”
The house-elf didn't visit her in the middle of their dinner, because she was sitting at the table with the Dursleys, in her nicest clothes. She was polite and smiled prettily, instantly placing herself in the Mason's good books. If there was anything that Slytherin had taught her, it was about using any means necessary to get what you wanted.
"Ara-" Daphne protested. "You moped around for a week when you realised she had a girlfriend. You doodled her name in your books. You said you would never love anyone else again after speaking to her thrice. If this
“Second-year Harry and Draco would have had an aneurysm if they saw this,” Harry muttered as they walked towards the dessert table, Draco’s arm curling around his waist as he spoke.
"We'll protect him, Draco. Don't worry about his safety." Scorpius made a weak noise of protest, and Draco held a hand up to him and turned around fully to meet Ron's eyes.
Ara sneered but plucked a few strands of her hair out. She added it to the vial and watched as the polyjuice in it turned molten silver.
The eighth-year students were put in dorms with two people per dorm. He didn’t know who had chosen the pairings, or what their basis was, but he and Longbottom had been put down to share. All things considered; Longbottom wasn’t a terrible roommate.
Draco hadn’t known what to say for that. He returned to powdering the asphodel. He added it to the potion, watching it turn a navy-blue colour, before turning back to Harry.
needed to explain Teddy's lack of control of his hair colour, and Harry decided that it was godfather's duty.
, Draco thought. Homosexuality wasn’t condemned in the wizarding world the way he heard it was in the muggle world, but some of the more traditional purebloods and muggle-borns were against it. And Draco was
However, when they started the physical unit of DMLE training, it had paid off and Harry easily jumped to the top of the class.
Apparently, she was rich, and she was a lot more famous than she thought. "You can claim your heirship to the black line when you're thirteen, Miss Potter," was what the goblins had told her. Aralynn hadn't known that she had a godfather, but after the strange week that she had, she wasn't surprised.
Someone wolf-whistled, running their finger over Harry's naked side, before slinging a towel over their shoulder and going to the shower, laughing.
After the war, Draco hadn't spoken to Ron and Hermione until Scorpius and Rose's first year at Hogwarts, after their children became best friends. The then-kids had pestered their parents to go over to each other’s houses for
The occupants of the room felt his magic flare out and settle down sealing the bond. He held up his wand. “Lumos.” Potter's magic felt comfortable and familiar, like sitting in front of a fire or being caught in the wind while flying.
There was no point in sitting there, the darkness would only remind him of those nights in the common room when his façade had almost slipped. When he ignored the calls of the students younger than him who only wanted acknowledgment from the Slytherin’s Dark Prince.
"When I saw you thereafter you were hit with the curse," he said, swallowing, refusing to look at Harry.
She focused her attention on the leaves under Dudley's feet and they turned to ash. She grinned at him. "It's a fun party trick."
But then Professor Lupin transformed, and the dementors came. Ara saw the wolf chase them away, and knew that she would get there somehow. She held no delusions of her parents coming to save her. She would have to do it herself, like every other time she was in danger.
His wife had looked so frail on the bed, face gaunt with her hair hanging thin and lank around her, so unlike the regal, intelligent woman that Draco had married.
Harry deepened the kiss, wrapping his arms around Draco and pulling him closer. Draco wasn’t used to tilting his head upwards while kissing Harry. Harry broke off the kiss, and Draco could feel less tension in him than when they had started.
It wasn't like they hadn't ever been in an uncomfortable sexual situation though, there had been a couple of bar nights with their friends where they had drunkenly made out. Those two or three times, they had been drunk enough that Draco wasn't sure if Harry remembered, but he had vague memories of it being the best snogs of his life.
for all you've done to my family and I," she said. "But, you’re all right, Malfoy,” she said, the corners of her lips lifting up slightly in what was almost a smile.
“It’s your legacy, both of you.” He pointed his wand at the sheet and winked at them. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
All four departments worked closely together, and their teams usually consisted of two people from each department
Draco had written the exams for the auror department the past month, along with the investigative department exam the month before that,
Draco slung his robe over his left arm and walked out of the hospital room, not daring to look back.
the whole wizarding world turning on him multiple times and still counting on him, to facing dragons, to watching Cedric Diggory die.
Potter stood at the head of the room; arms clasped behind his back as his daughter placed their bags in the corner of the room.
A few years earlier he would have sneered and tried to pry his arms from their grips, drawling about how
“I’ll join you in a moment, Susan, I’ll get some coffee for both of us.” He answered, looking at Harry, and the way his shoulders were still tensed.
Teddy laughed, “If it makes you feel any better, I can give Aster and Lissa the talk when the time comes,”
Teddy had hugged her tight before boarding, Marauder's map in his pocket and a spark in his eyes. "I'll make you proud."
Ara remembered how it felt to fly with the Weasleys at the burrow and joined the quidditch tryouts. She easily took the spot of the seeker and was only mildly annoyed when she found out that Malfoy was a chaser.
He turned to leave when a thought occurred to him. “I saw another one while undressing him before the blood stuck.”
Draco hung his robes on a hook and set his phone to charge on the table. He grabbed his mug and sat next to Harry, scowling.
She loved her parents so much. She felt tears prickling at the corner of her eyes at the thought of not seeing them until Christmas, but she refused to let them fall. She wanted this day to be happy.
"They are." she agreed again. "Remember the Horcruxes I told you about? That my godfather's brother wrote a letter about? There are more. We're going to hunt them down."
His cousin, Teddy, grinned at Draco and he realised that his eyes were the same shade as Potter’s. “He changes to match whoever he’s near,” Potter explained. Teddy pulled at Potter’s T-shirt at the shoulder, exposing more of the tattoo. It was a bird’s wing.
From those days when he quietly pulled his black leather gloves on, turning around and ignoring the pleas of help from the muggle-born students, only to return a few hours later, appearance glamoured, bringing food from the kitchens. He would hold a black-gloved finger up to his lips, smiling comfortingly at the kids and winking at them before leaving.
Draco had no idea that the weaslette was dating his cousin. For fucks sake, he didn’t even know that she and Potter weren’t an item. He turned his eyes on her accusingly and she stared blankly back at him and shrugged, lifting a delicate shoulder. “You never asked.” Was all she said.
“Okay, guys!” Granger was perched on one of the tables, with her wand in the air. She looked slightly tipsy, her dark cheeks flushed and her eyes glassy from the firewhiskeys that she had consumed.
Harry looked up at him and shot him a look. “I think Ginny tried that During the holidays, she has a bottle. It did absolutely
The first time, he hadn’t wanted to go, because he didn’t think he deserved to be there along with the rest of the war heroes. Pansy had all but dragged him there, threatening him with bloody murder if he didn’t show up.
“We already got them fitted, we just need to make sure they tailored them correctly. I’ll be gone an hour tops. Don’t finish the food please.”
Here, as Ara sat on the stool in front of the school, there had been no blond boy offering her his hand in friendship. There was only a hat that saw into her head and saw a thirst to prove herself. "Where you'll make your true friends," the hat had said, and so when it opened its mouth, the name of the house of serpents was the one that was screamed out.
He shot out of bed, cradling his aching head with one head and pushing his blankets aside with the other. He filled his bedside glass with water and drank, nearly crying from relief when he saw a vial of hangover potion on the table next to his wand.
Ara smiled gratefully at Luna, slipping her map back into the bag. "What would I do without you, Luna?"
Ara just flipped him off, shrinking Draco's bags and pulling him to her room. She paused in front of the door. "Do you want the next one or the one across from me?" she asked loudly enough that Sirius heard her, grinning when she heard his guffaws.
"Excellent, Potter." Snape praised quietly as he handed out schedules. "I want you, Draco, and Adrian in my rooms with a copy of all your lists an hour before dinner."
He was walking up to the floor above when he saw Potter. Well, bumped into Potter was more like it. Potter had clearly come from some form of physical exercise; he was wearing muggle sweatpants and had a light sheen of sweat on his forehead.
At first, Draco thought he was talking about his year on the run. But when he surfed through his memories of younger Harry, he remembered him always coming to school at the start of every year looking skinnier and paler than he did before.
However, there was a little redheaded girl. "Are you a first-year?" the little girl asked hesitantly as Ara stood in front of the train. There was a group of people with identical red hair, all talking over each other a few feet away.
“I can tell you those things about my mother. Mother always smoothes her robes down when she feels nervous. She frowns while brushing her hair because she doesn’t like the way it looks when it’s down. She doesn’t like apple juice because it makes her teeth feel funny. She has a bad habit of leaving her scarves everywhere. I can tell you those things about you too,” he continued.
And when Ara fought the skinniest member of their group, she pulled his hair and kneed him in the stomach and punched his nose. She
"Whatever, Potter.” He snarked, “Just make sure to buy some eggs or I'm locking you out of the wards until you return with them. We’ve been surviving on rabbit food for the past three days, for fucks sake."
“It’ll take a lot of time to forgive you,” she said, and he was stunned that he was being given a chance at all. “But we were all children caught up in a war that we shouldn’t have had to fight in. You weren’t born into the anti-Voldemort side or raised with an open mind,” she continued, and he was suddenly reminded of Potter’s words in the courtroom all those months ago.
She smiled at him and put a photo face down on his desk. "I found this in an old photo album. Have a good night, professor."
They were wearing color-coordinated robes that Draco had picked out, a blend of muggle and magical styles. Their rings were simple, engraved, with a small jewel.
Draco always thought that Harry looked like a startling combination of his parents and Sirius when he rode a motorbike or grew out his facial hair.
“How many do you want one day?” Draco asked, gently tugging Harry to a loveseat nearby for them to sit.
It reminded him of when he was younger and had just started training. It had taken top of the year grades for him to be let in DMLE training, and he had come home exhausted, bruised, and sick every day for four months until he moved in with Harry and he made him get some professional help for his eating problem.
Draco saw what looked like a line on Harry's side, and he swatted Harry's hand away before he could let his shirt fall back down, lifting the hem higher. When he saw what it was, he sighed. Not an uncommon reaction while dealing with Harry.
She clasped her hands tightly together. "Stay alive," was all she said. Ara laughed. "You know me, Aunt Petunia. I don't die easily." no other words were said but Ara caught a smile before her aunt left.
"One calm Halloween," Ara groaned to Ginny as they ran the grounds together in the morning. It was a habit that Ara had carried from her runs with Dudley, and Ginny was happy to accompany her. "That's all I ask for."
When Draco had turned away any heavy food, Harry had given him some simple foods. He passed it over with a knowing look with no pity in his eyes.
There were a few titters of laughter as they left, and only the prefects were left. Ara pulled a sheaf of papers and a few quills from her pocket. "To the fireplace? It's more comfortable and we may be here for a while." They all sat in a circle and drafting lists and reforms until the early hours of the morning. They may have had different family allegiances, but this was a school. They
When her name came out of the goblet, she had a whole house backing her. Her house knew her and knew that she would never have entered on purpose. Of course, some people doubted her honesty. But they were Slytherins, and no matter what happened, they supported each other until the very end.
Harry had been missing from breakfast and dinner every day for the past week, along with both Weasley siblings during dinner.
She visited Godric's hollow too, still a shrine from decades past. She left flowers at her parent's graves and visited Remus' and Tonks' with Teddy, Andromeda, and Sirius.
He often woke up from nightmares gasping and screaming, grateful that he had put silencing wards on his curtains. His stomach growled and he felt hunger pains but he had gotten good enough at ignoring them that they didn’t bother him anymore.
“Hermione,” he said without preamble when she picked up. “He’s extremely happy here. I saw the lesson. I don’t think I can bring myself to tell him to come.”
It had been wonderful, days spent lazily making out in the bedroom of the villa, swimming in the clear waters of the sea, sightseeing and touring the area.
"Very well Mr. Malfoy. Miss. Potter," Snape said reluctantly. "Help Malfoy. Granger, you're with Longbottom."
The training program had been rewritten after the war when they realized how much more the trainees needed to know before going out into the field. They had added in more theory, more hand to hand combat lessons, and added in another department.
She cast a cutting curse at the stomach of a death Eater in the Quidditch world cup. She saw him reaching for Ginny and didn't feel any regret as he fell bleeding to the ground.
Though he was making fun of him. Harry felt happy because Draco was gaining back some of his old snark and confidence, just without any of the bite.
He was beyond thankful that at twenty, he was finally living comfortably, working with something he loved, and being able to eat a healthy amount of food for his age and amount of exercise.
“So that’s how you stalked everyone, Potter?” he retorted, raising his arms in a sweeping gesture. “Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived to stalk people.”
When Aunt Marge came over for a week, Ara stayed with the Weasleys. She played Quidditch with Ginny, chess with Ron, and pranked the twins. She spoke to Percy about studies, Bill about Runes, and asked Charlie about Norberta. It was a happy week of food and learning, and lazy days spent sprawled under the sun.
Draco watched Scorpius discretely shoot a warming spell at his and Draco's mugs of coffee. Draco smiled gratefully at his son, both of them patiently waiting for Ron and Hermione to finish.
A few random questions and duelling demonstrations later, Lily Potter gestured for half of the class to get up, and they followed her to the other side of the room. Draco remained seated on the floor.
Mrs. Weasley threw a party for them, and the three prefects all tilted their heads together and smiled. Hermione stood in the middle of her two best friends, Ron's pale skin standing out from Ara and Hermione's darker skin tones.
"You may be a bloody fantastic cook, but we will never beat Ron in cake baking," He admitted, somewhat grudgingly.
Their compromise was that they would take two holidays a year; one with their family, and one with just the two of them.
"Infiltrating the ministry?" Tracy asked like it was a completely normal thing to do at 3 AM. "Do you want me to wake the other girls up so that we can talk about it after?"
He saw Harry circling the target, a Twenty-something-year-old. Harry was talking to him in low tones and Draco couldn’t hear what he was saying, but his expression was clear enough.
So she stunned him and conjured ropes to bind him to the wall of the shack. "So the little rat doesn't transform," she spat. And then to Sirius- "If your story doesn’t check out, I'll kill you with my bare hands."
She watched as Ron, Fred, George, Hermione, Blaise, and Fleur slowly transformed into her. She ran a hand through her hair. Ara had cut her hair to her chin a few weeks ago, anticipating that it would be hard to manage her usual longer hair on the run. "You better be transfiguring their clothes," she snapped at Moody.
Instead, he picked at the food once a day and completely ignored it the other two mealtimes. It had gotten bad enough that he felt uncomfortable with food in his stomach, as he’d realized on reopening day during the feast.
She gave her speech, and got them out. She had never been hugged so tight as Draco did when he was released. He looked ragged and tired, skinnier than she ever remembered him being.
Besides, the git had saved his life and testified for him and his mother, the least he could do was not sneer at him.
Her parents were standing outside watching her, her father’s arm around Dad’s waist and Dad’s hand on Lissa’s shoulder.
Draco smiled, though Harry couldn’t see him. “Of course not, Potter. God forbid someone should prevent the chosen one from eating his food. The world shall perish.”
Bellatrix’s was her raw power in curses, his mother’s was able to cast a variety of non-verbal spells in quick succession.
Arianna Nott raised her hand. Potter’s daughter gestured for her to speak, and Arianna stood up. “Your duelling styles are pretty similar. Are you following in Professor Potter’s footsteps with a Duelling Mastery and competitions?”
Ara felt a pang of longing in her stomach, but she pushed it away and nodded. "You two," she said to Ron and Hermione. "Will you be under the cloak?"
Draco had a similar picture with Pansy, only in a club. Harry had taken one look at the picture and commented about how Draco looked like a
And when he yelled in ager and they duelled, both of their spells glowing green like her eyes (she didn't want him disarmed, she wanted him
He waved her off. "I'm done sitting idle. And the rest of our classmates can run the resistance here."
“I’m sure you know that your Father and I didn’t have the most pleasant Hogwarts experience,” he said, running a thumb over her cheek. “But for both of us, it was always home. I only hope that you can find the same in it.”
“I accept your apology, even though I don’t think I deserve one,” Draco didn’t know what else to say.
The meeting went smoothly, with the head students handing out a form for each house's prefects to fill out for prefect rounds and such. She took the ones for her year. "I'll speak to the head of the Juniors," she told the sixth and seventh year Slytherin prefects. "It's Astoria, so we should be able to work out an effective system."
Harry kicked at a pebble and it rolled down into the water. He waited until the ripples had disappeared until he spoke. “It’s scary how easily you read me sometimes,” was all he said.
He took one look at them and turned around, miming gagging. “Gross, Harry. No one wants to see their godfather snogging their uncle in the kitchen. I’m turning back around now, and if you guys are still sucking face then I’m turning around and going to Aunt Hermione’s place.”
Ara spelled the door open, easily taking down the notice-me-not and repelling spells on the door with a wave of her hand. Draco and Theo may have better grades than her, but her senses were more attuned to magic than theirs were.
Harry’s eyes had tuned suspiciously watery after he said that, and Draco turned back to the potion, stirring it four times clockwise, and seven times counter-clockwise, before he heard Harry speak.
Ginny was making aggressive waving motions with her arms as she spoke to Angelina, who had one arm resting on her heavily pregnant stomach.
A lot of students had been missing from the great hall lately, with the one-year anniversary of the battle coming up.
"Draco," she said. "I know it isn't your fault. I won't be returning next year but there's a chance that we will meet and I need you to know that no matter what happens, I know your heart is in the right place."
He saw Potter and the weaslette clink glasses and throw back the shots, grinning at the cheers of their classmates in their drunken fervor.
He was kneeling in the sand, holding a small black box, Draco could see a flash of white from his teeth as Harry grinned up at him.
Teddy came to their house to visit a few hours after they had dropped all the kids off to the station.
He reached Harry’s room and stood in the doorway. He could see Harry in the room, sitting up, with pillows propped up behind him, staring out of the windows.
They pulled apart, foreheads resting together. “Don't think we aren't talking about the tattoo,” Draco muttered, pressing his thumb just above Harry's hip where he knew the tattoo was. Harry shivered slightly.
Draco had only seen red bangs when he came across her a few days ago two days prior. Her hair had been tucked into a cap, so when she pulled her cap off to reveal the shaved sides of her head and the black tips of the rest of her hair in the auditorium, Draco was certainly surprised. On closer inspection, Draco noticed a nose piercing too.
She liked Theo; he was smart and kind, and she felt an instant kinship to him when he confessed that his abusive relatives were why he didn't want to go home.
“I know Hermione chose the location.” He said. Draco stopped moving his fingers, looking tiredly up at Harry.
Both he and Draco hadn’t changed much with age. A few wrinkles there and some gray hairs scattered in was all Harry got. Draco had prominent laugh lines around his eyes, but his hair was just as blond as the day they had gotten married.
She thought of Ginny's freckles and Pansy's smile and the warmth it caused in her stomach. "I think so," she said.
“She changed her hair color as often as possible, but she usually cycled back to bright pink because she liked the way it felt. Most people are surprised by this one, but she loved the Beatles, a muggle band, and
“I would love to continue this hug fest,” her father continued. “But we don’t want to miss the train, do we? I’ll get Lissa ready and you finish packing,”
Both of them looked at her in alarm. "Yeah," she said bitterly. "He's the reason my parents are dead."
Draco felt a pang in his chest. “The combined forces of my mother, Aunt Andromeda, and Mrs. Weasley will be devastated.”
Draco pulled his feet up, resting his elbow on his knee. “How is Scorpius?” he asked, but he knew that Hermione heard the reluctant agreement in his voice.
Mischief managed; he had heard stories of the marauders, first from Harry, then from his mother, though she was a few years older than they had been in school.
"I doubt you'll need them," Dudley said as they circled each other. "I'm surprised John recovered from your attack,"
“After all these years, you still try to flatten your hair with your bare hands? You’re dumber than I thought then Harry.” Draco smirked.
The beeping of a monitor brought Draco back to his senses, and he felt Harry's hand move slightly, as he got up, groaning.
Potter laughed; a hearty, warm sound. “I’m bisexual, not gay.” He said, “And let’s just say that people weren’t picky about gender at the reserve.”
He hadn’t seen the horrors of the castle in their seventh year, and Seamus didn’t understand how Potter had nightmares of the castle when he wasn’t present in its worst state.
Potter gave him a funny look before answering him. “I’m a wizard, Malfoy, I’ll just send her a Patronus.”
He remembered Potter and Finnegan getting into a fight the second time. Potter hadn’t been in the castle the previous year and not many people knew what exactly he was doing to aide in the war, only that it was of immense importance and it left the trio with horrifying nightmares and panic attacks.
There were a couple of Harry and Teddy, one with Draco holding Teddy for the first time on his first birthday, one with Harry and his mother smiling that was clearly taken at some kind of Gala when neither of them was looking.
Grimmauld place was large and comfortable, now that it had been completely renovated. Once Draco had moved in, they had converted the large basement space into a training area, to practice what they learned in DMLE training.
“We’ll be there in a minute Harry, you can take Teddy back to your place, he needs to be fed. I’ll meet you there in an hour.”
It wasn’t long before she hugged all her numerous Aunts and Uncles, Teddy, her parents, and sister. She climbed the Hogwarts express, Daisy and Hugo hot on her heels, and paused to look out of the window of the train.
I could not comprehend a world where he didn’t exist. But now I'm in one. So for all of you, I will say some of the things I learned from him. It is our choices that define us. And what is most relevant now- happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if one remembers to switch on the light. To keep his memory alive, we must fight for a good cause. He once told me that with great power, comes great responsibility. We are magical blooded, and power floods through our veins. And we all have a responsibility right now. To fight for our cause- the one he died protecting." She raised her wand, and a tendril of light flew out of it. "To Albus Percival Wolfric Brian Dumbledore."
“You can ask about the tattoo, you know. We’ve talked about the war, for fucks sake. Why should this be any harder?”
"Ara and I are taking a portkey over to the states for a few days," Sirius said. Narcissa raised an eyebrow, and Ara continued. "Milli's over in the US, and she says there's a march going on called the pride march."
On the worst nights, one of them would lay their heads on the other’s shoulder desperately needing someone to hold on to.
"I think I may move into them," Luna whispered, looking down at her hands. "The gender-neutral dorms." Ara moved so that her head was on Luna's shoulder. Other than Ron, Luna was the tallest of them in the carriage. "That's great," Ara said softly. "Terry Boot from Ravenclaw said that they were moving into them too, so you'll have company."
Instead, he took a flight to Massachusetts and would take a portkey to an area near Ilvermorny where Potter lived. Ron and Hermione had given him the general location, but they had sworn an oath not to reveal the specific location, so he would have to do some following to find that out.
“Uncle Harry, Uncle Draco!” Victoire ran up to them squealing, clutching what looked like a stuffed dragon in her arms.
One of the Aurors, a sturdy looking woman, took a vial of veritaserum and came towards him. She grabbed his chin with rough hands and Draco opened his mouth for the potion to be poured into. He swallowed the potion, already feeling slightly light-headed as he lowered his occlumency shields and felt the liquid slide down his throat. He licked his dry lips, ignoring the bitter aftertaste left by the potion.
And when Hagrid carried her to the grounds the same way he brought her to priver drive (The beginning is the end) there were still screams of outrage. Only this time, there were hundreds of Slytherins too, wands in the air as they screamed for justice for the death of their leader.
He was banned from flying until the end of the school year. Standing outside and letting the wind caress his face, making his hair fly around, was the closest he could get to that feeling of euphoria.
When he reached his arm out for a truce in June the previous year, he had just wanted to end their now pointless rivalry, wanting to finally have a stress-free year.
Draco hummed non committedly, leaning back onto his hands and closing his eyes, letting the wind wash through his hair. The beginning of spring was upon them, he could feel it.
Draco broke apart from his parents, and when he came closer it was both of them that reached for each other. Ara pressed her face into the crook of his neck. She could feel his ribs poking through his shirt, and both of them were injured and covered in dirt. Ara didn’t' care.
He had woken up an hour ago, seemingly for no reason. He hadn’t had a nightmare in three days, which was probably his longest yet.
He saw that what he thought was a tattoo of a wing was actually a huge phoenix that covered most of his upper back and had names written in it in small cursive ink. The head of the phoenix turned itself to Draco’s direction and he heard himself make a small gasping noise.
And so when the sorting hat was placed on Ginny's head, all it saw was determination. She would be different. "SLYTHERIN," it shouted out, and Aralynn Potter, who was making a name for herself in Slytherin with her defense work and quick tongue, was the first to clap.
His daughter waved at the crowd, pulling her scarf and cap off. A couple of students waved back, clearly recognizing her.
“Sure,” he had laughed, “Tell that to all the photos on the walls. Don’t even try to pretend that you don’t have a framed photo of all of us in your room.”
Not sensing any other objection, he poured the contents of the vial into the pensive next to him and a silvery screen rose and images started playing one after the other in quick succession.
Uncle Blaise and Uncle Charlie had never married, choosing to devote themselves to their respective careers instead. Uncle Blaise was Lissa’s godfather.
Ara laughed. "Let them sleep, but I'm calling a house meeting afterward. Tell Malfoy to gather the prefects before breakfast."
Ara stood up, gently pushing him off of her. She kissed him one last time, closing her eyes as his hands cupped her face. "Good luck," he said, and she left.
Draco laughed incredulously. "Me? What makes you think that he would ever listen to me? He would probably shut the door in my face. And the ministry needs me here, I can't leave."
Draco shifted his gaze to the tattoo and exhaled in disbelief. “Oh,” He said, looking back up to Harry, who was still looking down at him.
Until he mentioned being okay with getting married a few months ago, Harry had known Draco had been slightly uncomfortable with the idea of getting married.
Draco just shucked off his outer robes and gestured to the side, asking Harry to move. Harry scooted over complyingly, and Draco laid down next to him, staring at the ceiling. He could feel Harry looking at him, but didn’t say anything about it.
That evening, as they sat in the kitchen of shell cottage, Ara held up a strand of curly black hair. "It's hers." she rasped.
Luna nodded. "The nargles seem to agree. The number of them around your head has decreased quite drastically."
"Eleven inches, Holly and phoenix feather," didn't change. Neither did, "That phoenix gave one other feather, Miss. Potter."
As soon as he reached the room, he threw floo powder into the fireplace and waited for an answer. A few agonizing seconds later, Genevieve’s face came into view.
Today, as he walked through the ministry a few days later, he saw his hand getting a few looks, but no one approached him.
Ara smiled lightly. "Even if she does, how is it any of my business. Not all of us are nosy little twats like you, Malfoy."
Three weeks later at the train station, the barrier was sealed shut when Ron, Ginny, and Aralynn tried to enter the last of the loud clan who had travelled to the stationto try and pass through. But when Ron Weasley tried to suggest taking the car, Ara rolled her eyes.
They left the room thirty minutes later, not expecting all their friends to be standing outside waiting for them.
Harry laughed, scrubbing a hand over his face as he leaned against Draco. His face was tired, but Draco had never seen such a content look on his face before.
He looked expectantly at her, but she just waved him off, cutting into her pastry. “I’ll still be here when you come back gushing and squealing. Just go Draco.”
After he had arrived at the house assigned to him and his mother for the duration of their house arrests, an auror had read out the terms of their sentence. As soon as he had left, the first thing Draco had done after scrubbing himself raw was to grab a pair of scissors and snip the ends of his hair until the strands just brushed his forehead. He looked a lot more like his own person this way. Longer hair brought attention to the similar features he and his father shared. Shorter hair made him feel lighter, almost as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
She received a low score from Dumbledore, but the excellent scores from the other judges and the constipated look on her headmaster's made it
Aster had been waiting for this day for years, ever since Teddy had told her about Hogwarts when she was a toddler. It was one of her earliest memories. Teddy had been a fourth-year Hufflepuff.
“Hmm,” Potter said. “We’ll talk about it at home.” They shared a look and his daughter’s shoulders relaxed.  “I spoke to Hermione today and she says it isn’t safe for you, Al, or Anna to leave. I didn’t realize that you had already spoken to her.”
before speaking. “Draco Malfoy may have been guilty of your listed crimes, but you neglect to mention all the good that he has done and that he was forced into all of his crimes, with the threat of his mother’s death hanging over him if he failed.”
Draco had only spoken to Sirius’ portrait a few times. When they moved in, and he had all but interrogated him, and on a few occasions, he walked in when Harry was talking to him.
That one was probably his favourite, and they kept it framed over their mantelpiece as a reminder of how far they had come since their first meeting in Madam Malkins nearly a decade ago.
Ara exhaled in relief at seeing him. He was safe. "I took my ring off, Sirius. He sent me a message. He said he had you in the ministry, and he would only spare you if I came over and handed myself over." She narrowed her eyes at him. "Tell me something that only Sirius would know."
If it wasn't clear in the chapter, Lily+ Narcissa= Lissa, and Aster was named for the Evans and Black family traditions, a flower and a star.
He knew Harry had wanted kids, and as Harry stood back up, sighing contentedly as Draco kissed his temple, he knew it was something that would be in their future.
Draco had been overjoyed, of course, but her nagging kept him up at night. "Fuck, Draco. I fought a basilisk and infiltrated the ministry. How can I become a parent?" "The Dragon just wanted to escape at that time, it seemed like a good idea-"
Their living room was covered in photos, of Draco and his parents when they were younger, and one with Harry and his parents when he was a baby.
When Hermione Granger was crying in the bathroom, Ara went alone. She knew what it was like to not have friends. She sat outside while the other girl spoke softly from inside the stall.
“I joined the Death eaters because my father wanted me. I never fully knew what being a death eater entailed, and I never wanted to hurt so many people.”
She had been in the forest with Luna and the thestrals in a rare moment of peace when she looked at the marauder's map. She saw Draco's dot alone in the seventh-floor bathroom, and when she looked at it in another ten minutes, he was still there, pacing in front of the sinks.
"Tonks gave birth," Remus said, his normally pale skin flushed with happiness. "We named him Teddy, and his hair is already changing colour. Ara, you'll be godmother, right?"
? Draco didn’t realize he had spoken out loud until Potter turned his head back to him and sat down properly, this time with a shirt in his hand.
Ara laughed. "You're not short, Mione. Ron and I are just tall." And it was true. Ara had grown taller than Sirius (who wasn't very tall to begin with) and was only a few inches shorter than Ron and Blaise. She made a point of Ruffling her godfather's hair every time she saw him, just to annoy him.
He would remember laughing giddily as Harry had rested their foreheads together, his arms resting around Draco’s shoulders and tangling in the hair at the nape of his neck.
Harry had huffed in frustration, adjusting the flame below the cauldron, leaving it to simmer for a few minutes.
After they had finished their first dance, Draco had looked over the crowd properly for the first time.
Snape cast the curse, and Ara watched in mute horror as the most powerful wizard in Britain fell to the ground, dying even before his body hit the floor.
, but he decided to keep his mouth shut and let himself be bound to the chair, Aurors stiffly standing on either side of him.
Victoire had been in Ravenclaw and Dominique had been quick to follow in the footsteps of her older sister.
Draco smiled softly at him, a smile that no one but Harry had seen. He walked out, only pausing at the doorway.
Draco walked quickly through the hallways, carefully staying out of anyone’s way and keeping his head down.
Draco had had only one or two short-lived flings. Not many people were eager to begin a relationship with someone who was branded by a criminal.
"Bloody hell," Dudley said. They sat on a bench near their house, close enough that they were encased by the wards, but not so far the someone in their house could hear them.
She visited a small shop next to the alley, bought a few pairs of comfortable clothes and shoes that fit her, and took it to be altered to grow magically along with her.
Draco scoffed. “Oh, I don’t know? Maybe because she’s sick of walking into your office to see us making out?”
When she was seven, her teachers wanted to put her in an accelerated program. But the Dursley's wouldn't pay for it, so she stayed in her regular class. She grew up unwanted and unloved but determined to prove herself.
been there. As an enemy, as my best friend, as my auror partner. As my boyfriend. You’ve always been there in whatever capacity I’ve needed you. Now, I need someone to spend the rest of my life with, as a husband,”
“Fine, fine. His schedule doesn’t change much every year. He usually takes class for the one hour before lunch and two hours in the evening for his senior-most students in duelling season and alternates year groups and houses each day. His office and the duelling auditorium are in the wing the furthest to the East. Arianna takes his class; he has her batch tomorrow at Eleven. His daughter graduated last year, and she works there as an apprentice.”
"I like being in the middle of change," she answered, sighing in contentment as Draco's hands massaged her scalp.
Ara looked at him. She looked at his tired eyes and set jaw. "Edit my Arithmancy essays every week and I'll agree."
His parents thought that she used some freakish compulsion on him, but he assured them that she hadn't.
. Draco certainly hadn’t, and while they were sweet together, he had no interest in learning either. “Spill, mate. You never told us you were bent, give us all the juicy details.”
Draco looked at his hand hesitantly before surprising himself by taking it. Potter’s hand was rougher and larger compared to his thin hand, and his skin was a few shades darker. “I agree, Potter. My mother seems to have taken a liking to you as well, so we’ll probably see each other more often than you think.” At least that hadn’t sounded snide, Draco thought.
“Sure,” she sat down in front of the fireplace, long dark hair in a braid over her shoulder. “Ask away.”
Harry shrugged, reaching to close the door behind him, toeing off the loafers that Draco had forced him to buy.
As he walked the streets of the magical sector, he passed a young woman that looked startlingly like a young Ginevra Weasley, so he assumed he was in the right place.
She waved them off at the train, sharing a knowing look with Ron and Hermione as they sent Hugo off for his last year. Rose had already graduated and was touring with the Winbourne wasps as their reserve chaser.
The entered to room, and Harry nodded in greeting through the one-way glass, Cassandra, Harry’s partner, locking the man’s handcuffs in.
"I expected you to be taller," she said, recognizing him as her Godfather's younger brother. "Where are we?"
Draco took this time to observe him. He looked much healthier than he had during the battle, but that was expected. He was wearing outer wizarding robes and Draco could see a flash of red near his neck, which disappeared almost immediately. The bright lights and veritaserum must have been playing tricks on him.
The tip of his want lit up and he put the light out and secured the wand back into the holster on his wrist calmly as if he hadn’t just cast an oath that could have easily taken away his magic.
Now, under the DMLE, there were four sub-departments; the hit-wizards, the Aurors, the investigative department or the ID, and the guards.
She laughed, and Draco’s chest tightened. “Resembled him? We were taught by him, Uncle Draco. He’s Senior Duelling Professor. Taught me everything I know about Duelling.”
It felt like no time had passed before Harry’s volleys grew erratic. A little faster or slower than he probably would’ve intended, or a bit off course. But when Draco looked up, the sun had moved towards the horizon, enough to be noticeable. Instead of sending the ball back, he Summoned it and caught it in his hands.
She looked towards the door, then back to Draco, and spoke through gritted teeth. “Then if you’ll excuse me, I can see myself out.”
He wasn’t waiting more than a minute. They stumbled toward the beach together, stopping for a grope or two but otherwise determined and deliberate about their intended destination. Draco held out his arm as soon as they were out of view and Apparated them both to the foyer.
“Three weeks to give you one magically stable Harry Potter with the Elder Wand stuck in his leg, or there’ll be Muggle-born genocide and starving orphans?”
She spoke first. From what Draco could overhear, it was to elaborate on her apology, that yes, she had meant to protect him but that wasn’t any excuse, she should’ve known better, should have remembered how capable he was instead of getting caught up in her work. Harry tried to stop her more than once, to minimise, to explain away. To Draco’s great surprise, she didn’t let him. And for all that he looked perplexed, unsure of how to respond to her insistence, he didn’t look upset by it or, as she went on, as though there was anything he really wanted to say.
Harry wants to hide. Of all the questions, he has to blurt one of the few he had quite intentionally decided to avoid. He knew the kiss might’ve scrambled his mind a bit, but now he’s got to persevere or look like an even bigger idiot. “I just mean, you must have some good stories.”
At least, for all that being a Malfoy had turned out to be a bit of an albatross, the social training still came in rather handy.
Harry laughs, warm and genuine. “Bunch of old-timers like us showing up in potions? Think they might notice, Nev.”
Like Draco’s weekend. Thoroughly ruined. Not that he had plans as such, with Goyle in Azkaban and Pansy doing her community service at a residential school for Squibs (the thought of which had given Draco every incentive to do a superlative job with his own assignment even before he realised its merits) and Blaise and Nott ignoring everyone who hadn’t come through entirely unscathed. It's pretty much down to reading, avoiding his mother, and very politely asking their house-elves-cum-unionised-home-service-staff to bring tea. Aside from a new novel it was about as interesting as watching grass grow, but it was clean and quiet. No bells, no yelling, no rotting fruit or mysteriously stained pants or bloody
The office is bigger than he’d expected. Almost vast. It’s got floor to ceiling shelves with an astonishing array of whirring, beeping, blipping devices that jump and shake and rattle neighbouring boxes.
Croaker spoke first. “Unless he’s perfectly fine, either immediately after the surgery or after a short rehabilitation.”
Those words would’ve been sweeter than treacle in any other instance, but this. “You told them,” I repeated, hoping the shock wasn’t too evident.
That’s one of the major problems with owls, he decides. Like the Royal bloody Mail’s Signed For, with extra pecking.
“Oh.” Harry scratches his head. “Right, yeah. Sorry. Let me just…” He trails off and points at the hallway.
“Figure of speech.” Draco raised his eyes to the ceiling in a silent prayer for patience. As he looked back down, it slid into a grin. “Unless you’re into that kind of thing.”
And then it hits him. There wasn’t a no anywhere in there. Draco’s no Gryffindor, but Harry was almost sorted Slytherin. Maybe it was because he was hosting a sliver of dark lord but whatever, he’ll take it.
“It’s fine,” Draco said. “You don’t have to go. You shouldn’t, on my account. That was insensitive of me, and rude. I’m sorry.”
“No,” Harry sighed. “Or not only. I suppose it might feel simpler if it was, though. Everything else is stickier. Is it better to leave, or to stay and fight to be who I want to be, where I want to be?”
“You will not do this.” Malfoy’s voice was a knife. “You will not come in here and start throwing your fists around. You will not destroy the building. You will not destroy the art. Listen or don’t, agree or don’t. I have worked too long and too hard to let your bullheaded barbarity destroy any of it.”
“Always a do-gooder, weren’t you, Potter?” Lucius interjected with just the faintest hint of bitterness.
Draco, who sat next to him without comment, good or bad, and spoke to him and to everyone else at the table, and who didn’t move any closer, but also didn’t move further away. Draco, who laughed with his friends and listened intently to everyone and offered to refill glasses and helped clear up and remained inscrutable through three courses and easily four times as many topics of conversation.
“Yes.” Draco resisted the urge to bring the conversation back around, if in no small part to see where Potter was going.
"Please, Potter. I'm cashmere, you're..." he trailed off, gesturing up and down with his glass, gin threatening to slosh over the edge. "Jeans and plain white t-shirts."
“Harry,” Draco ducked his head to try to catch Harry’s eye. He was intensely relieved when he was able. “Harry, it’s okay. It was just a momentary thing. No damage. And even if there had been, a bit of Dittany and it would’ve been fine.”
But even if the interest was mutual, it was untenable. Draco was leaving. Harry was Harry, his patient; and Harry Potter, Chosen One and Saviour; and Harry Potter, famous Auror; and Potter, his schoolboy enemy. The history between them, and the drama that would explode around them, made it untenable. Draco would return to France, to a life he’d finally been able to make to suit himself, first and foremost. Harry would go back to being Harry Potter. There was a logical end to all of it
When his hand grasps your neck, you know this was his plan. When he starts to push you down, you go, and then feel the beat through your knees. His cock’s in your face and you feel the bass through your shins when you slip your mouth around him.
Hand against the wall for support, he turned his back to the bedroom and moved towards the kitchen. The drawings were undisturbed. He felt as though his heart might pound through his chest. Malfoy, knowing this, knowing all of this, drawing it so lovingly— He thought if he moved, he might vomit.
He only realised he’d stopped breathing when his head began to pound. He backed away, then, gripping his wand tight between his fingers. He scrambled to the hearth and, looking over his shoulder for movement, whispered Ron’s name into the Floo.
“For Salazar’s sake.” Draco sighed heavily. “I was actually joking about your lack of mental acuity. Unless it takes this long for the blood to return to your brain?”
Their rough breathing filled the room but neither spoke until, beginning to soften, Malfoy withdrew from Harry’s arse and Harry felt a warm trickle of come flow over his bollocks.
Still, Draco had not the slightest inkling of anything other than his own mounting nausea. They’d discovered a pattern, a serial killer’s pattern, and it required calling Draco into a heavily warded conference room with the heads of the DMLE’s two most important departments and one of their star Aurors.
“Not just for the blind item. Though I will concede that it was, perhaps, not especially mature or appropriate.”
He gasped when Harry tugged on his belt, but if Harry noticed—which, from his smile, Draco thought he had—he wasn’t deterred. He pulled it open and made quick work of Draco’s flies. He tugged. “Up?”
He’s heavy and warm against my palm, and he responds in spite of himself. His mouth falls open before his knees do. He breathes deeply, and the tension in his legs falls away. When I lean forward, he lets me in. First to nip at the inside of his knee, then to trail kisses up his thigh, until he’s spread open well enough for me to mouth at his bollocks. It’s something he loves, and something the circumstances of our encounters doesn’t often permit.
Potter has the good sense to snap his jaw shut. His good sense has never been extensive enough to get him any further.
“I believe introductions are in order.” Mill paused for a split second. Draco could see her scrambling to sort out rank, and loved her all the more when she continued. “Doctor Malfoy, I don’t believe you’ve had the pleasure of meeting Head Unspeakable Croaker or Head Auror Robards.”
“I thought… I don’t know if you do this…” Harry exhaled shakily. “I don’t even know how to ask, apparently. Just,” he tried, “what I was saying before, about trust, and wanting to know what this was like with a man, and I don’t think you’d hurt me, I think you’d make it good, so, if we, or would you— Could we do it the other way around?”
I kissed him again, pushing him back until I was straddling him, able to kiss his neck and follow the trail of his jawline, to feel him arch up towards me. I wedged my knees between his, then, and pushed his legs apart, rolling my hips into his erection, feeling his moan as much as I heard it. He began to buck up into me, seeking the friction of our bodies together.
We both got ready for bed. A different sort of anticipation. Changing into pyjamas with our backs to each other, folding my shirt while I could hear him throw his over the back of a nearby chair. Hearing him turn down the sheets and slip under them while I was still setting my shoes next to my trunk.
Turning towards the taps and away from Harry, Draco huffed, “Yes, it’s entirely likely that either Granger or I left something out just for fun. Since this isn’t especially important to either of us.”
“Come for me,” Draco whispered again. “Want to feel you come.” He bent to press a kiss to Harry’s mouth and felt a moan against his lips, felt Harry arch again, felt him spill over Draco’s fingers. He gripped the sheets, his eyes fluttering shut and his mouth half-open, until he relaxed, suddenly and utterly.
Ron found him, standing there, and it was only then that he realised he wasn’t in anything more than his pants. Even still, Ron’s surprise registered before his state of undress.
At the very front, the reception desk sat facing the door. It was curved, like a C, and though it had sat empty for most of the night Harry imagined an eager young staffer might sit there and welcome all of Malfoy’s rich, famous patrons.
A rousing chorus came from the bench in such a wave that Draco thought he might smell their collective breath across the room.
“Didn’t think so.” I lick a strip up the underside of his shaft. He whines so beautifully. I wonder how he’d sound begging.
She slipped the key to the Manor’s front gates into her robes, nestling it into her cleaving, snug below the fucking Hallows. “Isn’t that right, Draco?”
Harry’s shin guards drag against the bedding. His boots are probably staining Draco’s robes. But the feel of cool leather against his sides more than compensates as Harry comes into place over him, bracing himself against the headboard.
Draco felt the urge to sag against something. Mirrors were not conducive. He held himself straight. “I want to try. If I had known what I know now, who I know now, I never would’ve believed any of it. If I had known what Muggles were capable of—the good things, not just the destruction—it never would’ve made sense. It would have seemed ridiculous when my father said what he did, or when the—when other people did. I could never believe that now. They amaze me.”
“It’s their colours!” Harry grinned a bit sheepishly. “And once we came up with the first two, there was a theme to uphold.”
Galder popped into the room looking thoroughly frantic, and with his tea towel dripping water on the floor.
“It was,” Draco answered. “I’d had my mother’s, so not as strange as I imagine it would be to come from not having one at all. But it was.”
Harry sits back, his skin glowing with the hint of exertion, and Draco takes his time looking at the trail of hair that gets thicker as it approaches his waistband.
Before Harry could finish, Malfoy stopped and turned to him, fixing him with such a fierce glare that Harry couldn’t go on.
“That’s the thing, isn’t it? It could be a door, or a window, or a face. And if it’s a door, it could be a door to anywhere. It’s what you make of it.”
Tables are lined up, edge to edge, for yards. Tall ones, short ones, tiny round ones, huge rectangular ones that could fit half a Hogwarts house. Wood and metal and glass and some odd Muggle materials that Draco’s never bothered to learn the names of. They are among the biggest challenges to Draco’s organisational system. Sorting them by size, shape, and material would be most logical, but moving them endlessly to make space for new arrivals rather defeats the point vis-à-vis efficiency. Draco has, reluctantly, settled for sorting them by arrival date, newest closest to the front. At least it will serve Potter well.
“The list,” Potter huffed, “is on the phone.” He let a hint of smugness tug at the corners of his mouth. “It’s charmed.”
These games might be palatable if Potter knew what he was doing, if there was any logic or consistency. If Draco could trust it was a game at all. That, at least, would be familiar terrain, but this –
“No small thing,” Blaise insisted. “It continues to be exceptionally lovely. And with an exceptionally well-stocked bar. Shall we?” He held out an arm to Pansy, who took it with an exaggerated bow, leaving Draco and Millie to follow them into the line.
I knew I’d found it when he sank down further, taking my finger in to the base and issuing a groan that left me even closer to incoherence. His stomach shook and he canted his hips for more.
He thought of Chloé next, and winced. He’d left her in charge of three of his doctoral students, all of them elbow deep in dragon heartstring, wood samples, and anatomy models. She was the type to get so excited about a breakthrough that she’d eventually come through unannounced. Last time she’d had Luc in tow. They’d found Draco fast asleep halfway under a snoring Frenchman, and it still hadn’t stopped her from reporting her latest findings.
Potter drew a long breath and picked at the side of his nail. “I would be able to go to this round of balls and things though, right? And it would be over quickly?”
Harry hugs the parchment to his chest. “Oh, yeah? How about borrowing? You think the Wizengamot could handle that?”
“We could, but frankly the details of the case don’t make enough sense for me to make an unqualified recommendation.”
“Hiding in the presence of Gryffindors? Really, Draco, must you fulfill only the worst parts of the Slytherin reputation?”
Again, Potter was sitting quietly, reading, and gently put the book down and rose to shake Draco’s hand when he entered. Aside from pleasantries, and an odd tendency on Potter’s part to look past Draco’s shoulder as though waiting patiently for more people to arrive, he seemed perfectly content to wait for further instruction.
“No, indeed.” He rose and shook hands with each in turn, getting a constipated-looking smile from Croaker and a grim smile from Robards on top of two aggressively firm handshakes.
“We’ve discussed this endlessly, darling. For good reason,” Pansy added, forestalling Draco’s complaint. “After everything…it won’t ever be enough, and that’s no reason not to do what one can to make amends. Besides which, being mortgaged up to the eyeballs is practically its own aristocratic tradition, and doing it for this is a fair sight better than Quintis Selwyn’s attempt to sell the Ministry on Muggle locomotion, or Temperance Urquart’s quest to clone Snidgets.”
Draco looked at Harry, and at Harry looking back at him, and didn’t know how long it would take to begin to know what his questions even were. He did know he still wanted to reach across the table and take Harry’s hand. And some part of him wanted to reach across the table and take more than that. He took a deep breath. Exhaled. “How many more courses are there?”
“I will go before the Wizengamot,” Potter read, “and see about restoring a portion of the reparations they took after Voldemort’s defeat.”
“Enough!” Draco yelled, popping over the seatback and glaring fiercely. “You know perfectly well my father’s arse is neither this pert nor this firm, and I’ll thank you to keep the details to yourself.”
Blaise took a bite of spinach and chewed quite thoroughly before he answered. “Yes. Some of it has to do with the war.” He gave Pansy a sympathetic look. She drained her glass in response, and Blaise continued. “I stayed far enough out of it, I suppose, house affiliation aside. Some of it is the last name, more associated with scandal than anything else. Never knew that would be an advantage. Some of it—” He ducked his head and sighed. “Some of it is to do with my looks, I’m told. As lovely as my clients may be—” He looked towards Pansy again, this time with a tiny smile, in response to which she refilled her glass “—some of them aren’t able to make public appearances. In those cases, when they need someone to serve as the public face of the project, they find mine useful.”
“Okay.” Draco walks forward on his knees and takes the tube from Harry. It’s his favourite kind. He wonders if Harry’s remembered that, too.
They brought the whole Hogwarts contingent back to the Ministry and set us up two to a Thestral for the ride back to school – we can all see them now, of course, which makes them quite a bit easier to use for this sort of thing – and Longbottom had the acuity to realise he needed to come up with an urgent reasons to switch with me once he was assigned to ride with Potter. I was meant to share with Hannah Abbott, who has a perfectly sweet little waist; I’m sure he didn’t mind riding back to school with his arms wrapped around it too terribly much.
Padma grinned and disappeared around the corner to her office, and with shaky fingers, Harry unrolled the letter. He recognised the handwriting instantly, though the Titchwell stationary had been replaced with something more formal.
“It’s not that. And I know why you were suddenly so keen on getting our own place.” He didn’t look at Harry. “Ginny told me before she told you. About Mum and Dad paying for her surgery and all.”
Harry shot up in bed as his alarm started beeping, his heart hammering against his chest. He took a few deep breaths, and switched his alarm off, before getting out of bed and putting clothes on.
Avoiding as much of the blood as possible, Draco stepped around the bodies and moved to the next room.
He turned around, feeling a blush rise to his already warm cheeks, and walked over to the couch, sitting down before holding his head in his hands.
“There are records of all the meetings, as well as the address of the place of our meetings, back at Malfoy Manor. They’re in a safe in the master bedroom.”
my computer is currently broken, and i  d e s p i s e  writing on my phone so i did this on my mom's laptop, just means updates are gonna be even slower than usual :/ also exams are soon so. i am supposedly studying
"We are in the more rural parts of Essex, approaching a farm belonging to Rexell Parkinson," Robards responded, "which you would know if you had read your briefing."
Draco sighed and flopped down on the couch. “I’d hardly call it a vacation. But the short version is: my dad’s still an asshole, someone nearly died, Potter’s girlfriend broke up with him, and my boss has set Potter and Granger to spy on me because he thinks I’m still a Death Eater.”
“Oh, I don’t know…” Hermione bit her lip. Ron kept his arms folded, staring at her. “You know what? Fine. Let’s just go with this one.” She moved her eyes away from Ron.
Draco was wearing a black button up with silver patterns tucked into black jeans. He pushed his fringe back, feeling very self-conscious. It was one thing for Pansy to tell him he looked good in their apartment, but actually being out in public was a whole different story.
Then, Robards glanced at Elarena, who nodded. He pulled out his wand, pointed it at Draco, and muttered something that Draco was just able to hear.
“They look fine, Draco,” Pansy sighed, applying lipstick, “better than fine. Great. Fantastic. Fabulous.”
“About school. The way we treated you. Draco is too. I don’t know if he’s said anything, he’s terrible at expressing emotions.”
“So, to what do we owe the pleasure?” Seamus asked, “Unless you’re just here to see our lovely faces, o’course.”
Malfoy was just scared. There was no way he was still a Death Eater. He was just a kid who wanted to see his parents again, unless… unless he was a really good actor-
Robards reached into his robe and pulled out a card. “Well, if you think of anything, don’t hesitate to send an owl. Er, not that you use owls… well, I’m sure you can make a plan.”
“He didn’t do anything. Why did they… he didn’t do anything.” Tears started to stream down her face.
The crowd dispersed, and Draco followed Granger and Potter over to where Robards was standing. They were quickly joined by Goldstein.
Harry held onto her every word. He still felt such a strong sense of longing for every bit of information about his father, Sirius and Remus.
Draco walked over and took it from him. “This looks promising.” He walked over to a smaller cabinet in the corner of the room. “This is locked.”
He walked out of her ward, feeling almost dazed. The Weasleys all stood up as he came out the door, but he walked past, not knowing what to say to any of them.
“Yes, of course. Ms Collins, we can’t disclose too much detail, but there have been some attacks on Muggles recently that suggest the activity of those who were associated with You Know Who. Given the history of your parents, we wanted to know if you knew anything about these attacks?”
Robards nodded curtly. “Alright, thank you, Rex. I’m sorry to have bothered you with all this. I just have one more question - can you think of anyone who could have been involved in this?”
"Hello?" He said, looking inquisitively at them. His eyes roamed over Robards, Draco, and then widened when they reached Potter.
Draco felt as though he was dreaming. He almost felt as though he was floating, observing the scene, but not corporeal.
They all turned on the spot, and had the air sucked out of their lungs as they were crushed and squeezed through space.
“Ron, just listen to your mother, please,” Mr Weasley said, giving him a look that begged him not to make Molly mad.
“If anyone but a member of my family did that, they would be hexed,” Draco said coldly, and stepped into the front lawn.
He opened the cupboards, looking for some kind of snack. The contents consisted of a tin of crushed tomatoes, a packet of rice and an almost empty packet of crackers. Harry frowned, took the crackers, and moved onto the fridge.
“Then we definitely need you here. This will be our safehouse - if Andromeda is alright with it - and we need someone who can reliably heal. We don’t know how much fighting we’ll be doing.”
Harry nodded. “Listen, I’m still your best mate, right? You can talk to me, or ask me to come over, or whatever.”
“That’s not what- I don’t want to- nevermind. I’m just going to…” he looked around, his face flushed red. “I’m not hungry.” He walked into his bedroom.
Draco opened his eyes blearily, and looked out of the cell he was being kept in to see Robards and Elarena standing outside.
“But, she also helped a lot of people. I can’t speak on behalf of others, but she helped me, at least. I don’t know where I would be without her. I can’t imagine the person I would have become if I was only raised by my father. She saved me both from him and his influence.”
this was a long one :) anyways, i've just started my last year of high school so this year is gonna be pretty hectic. i'm going to try and keep updates as regular as possible, but once i'll be writing exams in may, mocks in around september and then finals in november so around then i won't be posting much. i'm hoping to finish the fanfic this year though, so we'll see what happens!
“Yes, yes, I’m, fine - don’t worry about me,” she said, the smile forcing its way even further up her cheeks.
“Mr Potter, yes. We’ll let you know as soon as she wakes up, but for now she is in a stable condition.”
His breath caught in his throat as he looked out onto the passageway. A thick layer of dust coated everything, but it was
