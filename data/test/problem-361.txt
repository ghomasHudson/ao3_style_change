Pansy demanded, excitement sparkling in her eyes now.
There was more, Remus could feel it, but Severus wouldn’t volunteer any further details by himself as he knew him.
Harry didn’t answer. He had half a mind to just get up and leave again, but willed himself to stay seated. Better to get this over with.
be so impolite as to let Harry pay for him.
Remus just nodded. He’d make an exception in this case and just accept whatever she’d done. He didn’t need to know. All he cared about was that they got what they deserved.
Snape frowned. Ungrateful bastard.
“It’s not an issue if you don’t have enough cash, mother can give you one of her checks and you just write your name into it,” Draco reassured him, and Harry relaxed marginally.
He snorted. “No, Hermione, I didn’t go to the Slytherin dorms. In case you’ve forgotten, I have a room in Raven’s quarters.”
Startled, he pulled himself out of his thoughts and looked at her, asking, “What?”
Ron kept grumbling right up to the moment when the door to the Potions classroom opened and Slughorn waltzed out, standing at the door as they all filed inside and greeting Harry with annoyingly exaggerated enthusiasm. The classroom was already foggy with steam and Harry saw several cauldrons with finished potions standing on their desks. He recognised them all; Polyjuice, Amortentia, Felix Felicis, and Veritaserum. Severus had taught Draco and him how to brew all of them perfectly.
“A rune-bound, wandless…form?” he asked hesitantly. Harry had told him about those so-called healing forms he’d found, but he had no experience at all in that area and had assumed that it would require a much more advanced understanding of healing than Harry currently possessed.
“I am not happy about it either,” said Severus gently.
“One moment, Mr Potter, I will give you the official record of your complete inheritances. All it takes is a signature and a drop of your blood on the official documents to formalise your acceptance of the position as the head of house Black.”
“Sirius?! Sirius could’ve been my father?”
“If I ever have bombshells to drop again, I’ll warn you,” Harry promised.
Most Gryffindors gained fame through winning some battle, waging some war or similarly bold and brave deeds. Ravenclaws tended to be scholars, famous for breakthroughs in magical theory or wand-lore or something like that. Not all of them, mind; there was one in particular, Henry Moretz, who became famous for defending a village from a beast by drawing its attention to himself until the villagers could flee, which was a rather Gryffindor move in Harry’s opinion. Hufflepuff had mostly produced healers and philanthropists, but even from the house that valued kindness had come some bad ones.
They stayed silent until their robes were fitted and paid for and they were out on the street again. Harry steeled himself for their questions as an uncomfortable silence stretched between them.
His face twisted into a scowl. Merlin, what had he done? He’d been so focused on how much he hated James Potter that he’d completely ignored that the boy was just a child, like any other.
He stayed in the restroom for another minute, carefully slipping his Slytherin mask back on, the mask his friends knew him with. Then he opened the door and finally made his way back to his compartment.
“Grading?” he asked, as he closed the door behind him. Severus nodded and gestured for him to sit in an armchair that Remus thought he’d seen in one of the second floor bedrooms before.
Almost as surprising as Harry’s sudden willingness to interact with Severus was the apparent ceasefire between him and Draco. The boys still seemed to avoid each other, both spending most of their days in their respective rooms—or wherever else Harry disappeared to sometimes, although those episodes were usually very short now—but they‘d stopped hexing each other when they thought nobody was looking. Whatever had prompted their newfound civility towards each other, Severus wasn’t going to risk their peace by questioning it, and he knew that Remus felt much the same despite their curiosity.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter and as always thanks for reading! <3
already
“Alright, alright, let’s go shopping then if you’re so excited about it. I should’ve figured, really, given how perfectly styled you always prance around.”
Draco grabbed his chin and forced Harry to look at him. “Hey. It’s not like I don’t
“Indeed! Horace has agreed to return to Hogwarts,” he announced proudly.
Draco nodded with a heavy sigh. “I knew what I was in for, didn’t I? Might as well get it over with all the apologies I have to make.”
Severus’ eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t seen them fight in teams before, not even all in the beginning when Draco had first joined. He eyed Remus, who gave him a small shrug as if to say “Why not?”
“What, no! That’s not what I meant. Yes, wine, please.”
“You obviously can’t go to any of your Slytherin friends, since most of them are connected to Death Eaters somehow; the Dark Lord would find you in no time and there’d be no getting out of it then.”
To Draco’s surprise, Theo disagreed. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that. Don’t you remember how big that club was last year already? Rumour has it Potter taught
Within barely fifteen minutes, they had changed into their flying gear and were ready to go. Remus apparated them to a forest that looked suspiciously similar to the one where the World Cup had been two years prior. Indeed, he confirmed Draco’s thoughts just a moment later, explaining that the Muggle-repelling magic still lingered, which made it easy to double up on the charms and thus make it near-impossible for them to be detected. He even produced a practice-Snitch and a rather battered looking Quaffle and transfigured three large tree branches into makeshift goal-hoops before settling down on a conjured chair with a book as Draco and Harry took to the air.
“Yeah, wonderful, we just got to our dorm.”
He began to recall memories to entertain himself, some recent, but most from his time at Hogwarts. James and Sirius bickering. McGonagall berating them for one of their pranks. Working on the Marauder’s Map. He was just sinking into the comfort of his own mind, when a knock sounded on his door.
Seeing that he was no longer needed, Severus turned to go, looking forward to finally getting some rest, when Albus stopped him. “One moment, Severus, I must speak with you.”
“I wouldn’t worry too much about that, the boy has proven himself quite capable of sneaking around the castle.”
“Perhaps seven thirty,” said Harry. “I want to get to the room a bit earlier to prepare, but I do appreciate dinner.”
“And here I thought you didn’t like all the bustle in the house since Phlegm arrived,” Ginny shot back.
“The laziest.”
“Good,” Harry said, smiling. “Do you mind if I summon a book to read a little? With all the cleaning out I haven’t really had the time.”
“But Potter gets special treatment because he’s the
It would be a long night. Full moon nights always were for him, but at least this time it would be long because of boredom, not because of the irrepressible urge to hunt and kill.
“I used to wait until midnight the night before my birthday to make a wish, because that’s when I was by myself, away from the Dursleys. I told Ron about it once and ever since then people usually sent my birthday presents to arrive around midnight, so the Dursleys wouldn’t notice. It’s turned into somewhat of a tradition, though I guess this year there won’t be anything since everyone is coming here tomorrow.”
Severus nodded and Harry turned his attention to the deep gashes in his chest. As he lifted his wand, Severus’ hand closed around his wrist, tugging at it.
In reality, he wasn’t sure how the Dark Lord would react if he didn’t show up until after the potion was done. An hour was a lot, especially during times in which the Dark Lord knew that Severus had no permanent responsibilities at Hogwarts. He could get away with a lot during term, but far less over summer, when the Dark Lord expected him to be at his disposal at all times, like any other Death Eater.
Harry’s lesson had begun at seven. Surely it couldn’t take much longer, right? They had agreed to meet at nine on the assumption that two hours were already longer than a regular double-period class. Draco then had assumed that Harry would most likely be done early. He’d been wrong.
“He wasn’t ready, that doesn’t count,” Harry replied dismissively.
” he asked, his voice tight.
“And what makes you so sure of that?” Moody parried.
“Ron, maybe we should—” Hermione began, but Ron interrupted her.
“Of course!” Severus hissed suddenly.
“It’s Sunday, Draco,” Harry said, then halted suddenly. “Are the shops even going to be open on Sunday?”
Harry kissed him again and Draco relished it. He wasn’t sure how they’d gotten across the room, but suddenly he felt the back of his legs hitting the bed, and before he could regain his balance, Harry had pushed him further backwards, and he landed on his back, Harry following suit on top of him. A small spike of anxiety shot through Draco, momentarily piercing the cloud of swirling emotions and lust surrounding his mind. As natural as this felt, it was the first time Draco ever kissed a man. Technically, it was the first time Draco ever kissed anyone he was actually attracted to, given that Pansy definitely didn’t fall into that category.
“Our lesson
“Thanks for the book, mate,” said Ron, holding Harry’s new copy of
Severus gave a small nod and followed Albus into the empty corridor.
“Alright,” Sn—
“Not extensively, but the basics. I gained some interest in it during my N.E.W.T.s, although I focused rather on the potions-related aspect of it. You can do amazing things with healing potions, some far more effective than spells. Admittedly, they often lack the flexibility of precisely cast spells, especially against curses that don’t respond to healing magic itself in the first place.”
Harry snorted. Of course the press would spin a ridiculous story like that. Then he sobered suddenly. It was a ridiculous story, except that this time they weren’t entirely wrong. The prophecy
He nodded again. “Yes, it’d be best if she left the Manor as soon as possible.”
“It’s all very hazy, but I think I remember that form Harry cast, he was leaning over me. And I remember him talking, his voice. At some point I think he called my name.”
It was a start, Harry supposed. He nodded, and decided to let the argument go. Time would tell whether they kept their word.
Harry gave her a bewildered smile and a mumbled “Thank you,” and he was glad when she turned her attention to Remus instead of him.
“Oooh, tell me
“According to Da—” He broke off and glanced around with mild panic rising in him. “I’ve heard he relies mostly on the textbook,” he corrected himself. Had anyone heard that slip-up?
(See the end of the chapter for
So sorry to leave you hanging with such a cliffhanger, please don't kill me.
They’d survived the first day of term, and it hadn’t even been that bad. They’d be alright.
“You’re different,” she said finally, leaning back in her armchair.
It felt odd, sitting here with them like this, after the solid routine he’d established for himself at Grimmauld Place. Not that he hadn’t ever had a solid routine at the Manor, but those routines had been born out of etiquette. Looking back, it all felt forced compared to the groggy, yet easy mornings with Harry. A hot shower followed by breakfast with his mother, Severus and Remus, each of them sitting in the same spot every time.
“Lily Evans and I were involved during our time at Hogwarts. Right before her wedding, she visited me to say goodbye.”
say he was destined to kill Voldemort. A familiar sensation of dread was gripping him, as memories from the Ministry threatened to overwhelm him.
“You deserved it,” she said innocently, “for being a shitty friend to Harry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s also what everyone said about Severus being my father. How can we be sure? What if we are related in some twisted way? What if he’s like, I don’t know, Dad’s grandfather or something? Dad told me that he never met his grandparents, his mother was not on good terms with them. It’s not impossible.”
“Gods, no.”
Cedric’s face flashed before his eyes, making his chest feel even tighter.
They hadn’t gone any further than that first night, not really, and while Draco was more than happy with Harry’s hands frequently wandering under his shirt, he hadn’t tried touching Harry again for fear of a similar reaction as that time. Still, he couldn’t deny that he
Harry lifted his head to give Draco a questioning look. “Dear?”
Severus shook his head, as if trying to snap himself out of his stupor, and quickly said, “Nothing, I was merely surprised. What do you mean by ‘it would do my hair some good’?”
The castle’s magic resisted him for barely more than a few seconds before it yielded, and with it the stone wall he had been aiming his wand at. A large, wooden door formed and promptly swung open, revealing a bathroom made predominantly of soapstone, with a large bathtub, separate shower and two sinks, as well as several mirrors. It resembled the prefects bathroom, especially the multiple taps lining the tub.
to each other! Can we be friendly with each other in public at least?”
“I thought you didn’t remember,” he hissed.
Harry smiled widely and immediately plunged his arm into the basket, pulling it out a moment later with a snake coiled around it. He made a series of hissing noises at the snake and laughed softly at Sirona’s hissed response.
Draco’s mother put a hand on his knee, her posture still exuding perfect calmness and poise. He forced himself to straighten, emulating his mother’s air of serenity, as he had done so many times at countless social events his father had hosted at the Manor. If nothing else, he had perfect manners, perfect self-control. He resisted the urge to draw his own wand. Harry wouldn’t let them attack him. He wouldn’t. Draco was so tense he could almost feel his muscles vibrate, his heart pounding in his throat.
How on earth was that possible? And how could an inheritance be disputed? He looked over at Harry, who seemed equally shell-shocked, although there was a storm of emotions in his eyes. Hesitantly, Draco reached out to touch his shoulder, which caused Harry to snap his green eyes to Draco’s. It looked like he was holding back tears.
“What the hell?” he mumbled, slightly shocked.
Harry didn’t know what to do with that. Would he still have loved him if he’d known he was someone else’s child? If he was
People had to believe that he had no idea who his real father was, which meant that he had to keep up the act of mourning the loss of James Potter as his father figure, even though he’d gotten over that quite thoroughly by now. Of course, there was always a risk he might screw up. A tell, a voice crack, something that would clue people in, and though they had a contingency plan Harry hoped it never came to that.
“Of course, but as you are surely aware, Voldemort is not entirely sane these days. He has episodes of madness and I believe it reasonable to assume that his defences are at least weakened, if not non-existent during these episodes.” He fixed his eyes on Harry over the golden rim of his glasses. “I am sure you understand how valuable such insight into Voldemort’s mind and plans could be.”
Draco nodded. “See you there, then.”
“Harry! Since when can you do wordless magic?” asked Ron, looking stunned.
Harry shrugged. “Not much, to be honest. I know it’s unique to each person.”
“You alright?” Draco asked lightly, putting his robes on the counter next to Harry’s purchase.
“It’s so weird to hear you talk about the Malfoys so casually,” said Ron.
“Yep,” replied Harry with an enthusiastic nod.
Lupin eventually saved him from his never ending thought spiral. “How about you stay here for now, Severus? There are plenty of rooms that are still free. I doubt that Harry will be ready to talk before tomorrow if he hasn’t reemerged by now.” He sighed heavily. “And I’ll talk to him. I’ll tell him how close you and Lily were. He’ll come around.”
His eyes followed Harry as the boy left, leaving the door open behind him. All things considered, that had gone much better than expected.
They both stood motionless for an instant, then shared a slightly disbelieving glance before simultaneously letting out a shaky laugh.
Soft steps sounded from the staircase, before halting again abruptly.
Harry chuckled softly and shook his head. “No, I was waiting for someone to be
Not that they had kept to cuddles all day. The memory of Draco’s smooth skin against his made Harry shiver slightly. And now it would all be taken from him.
“Of course you’d blame it all on them, because I am apparently incapable of forming my own opinions in your mind,” he spat, anger shooting through him. “News flash; neither of them make any choices for me, nor do they try to — unlike you two, they actually trust my judgement. I’ve said it several times already, but I’ll say it one last time: I trust them. Severus is my father, Draco is my partner, and I consider Narcissa family as much as I consider Remus family. They are important to me, and I won’t stand for you insulting them at every turn. Our history may be complicated, but there is more to them as people than their well-practiced masks for the public.”
Instead, he watched the reactions on the faces of the audience. Many of them looked scared, particularly the younger years, but some wore expressions of grim determination or even hints of enthusiasm. Remus noted that even the seventh year students had come, apparently willing to learn from Harry despite technically being a year ahead of him. For a moment, he wondered how many of them were here simply to get a look at the Chosen One, and whether Harry had considered that aspect when he’d decided to continue the DA. Remus knew the stares and the gossip bothered him, but had he anticipated it to this extent? Would he even have realised that he’d give any groupies the perfect opportunity to come gawking?
Snape looked like he was in pain, scrunching up his face in annoyance while shaking his head. At a flick of Snape’s wand, the curtains flew closed, muffling Walburga’s screams. “I suppose we can skip the introductions then,” he drawled. “Narcissa is a guest of the Order, there’s no reason to point your wand at her.”
a Slytherin. Ron’s house-prejudices were rather intense, now that Harry thought about it, bordering on problematic.
Severus waited until he’d taken ten slow breaths, then he followed.
“Da— You mean
“Which brings us back to the reason why I sent them away in the first place.” Narcissa looked over at Severus. “What happened yesterday?”
“But—”
And then Draco’s part got longer (and smuttier) than expected, but if I had shifted that to the next chapter it would’ve been too short and I didn’t want to artificially stretch it either. I guess we're just at 6-10k chapters now, oh well.
to bridge the gap between them, that much was clear. Still, Harry couldn’t get his long-honed paranoia to stay completely quiet. Offering gifts as a method of manipulation wasn’t a particularly novel trick, even though Severus had explicitly claimed that Harry owed him nothing for it the thought was planted in Harry’s mind now. The knowledge that Severus had done something for him, so he ought to do something in return. It was infuriating, because he
Harry frowned, thinking back to the Triwizard Tournament and Cedric, then thinking of Cho.
“I know, me too,” Harry replied softly, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist to pull him close.
“It’s linked to another one, a counterpart so to speak,” Harry explained. “If you write in one of them and activate the Protean charm, whatever you’ve written immediately appears in the counterpart, the receiving one chimes, and the ink in the sending one changes colour.”
Draco just nodded, stepping closer to Harry and nuzzling into his neck. Harry felt some of his tension drain out of him as he leaned into the touch with a sigh. Odd, how Draco Malfoy of all people would be the one who could make him relax with a simple touch. He suppressed the urge to laugh.
She frowned but didn’t argue further.
Severus nodded, a stab of guilt going through him.
“I— I don’t know, I just wanted it to stop, to stop thinking about it, to stop remembering it. I— It felt like I shouted, but inside my head. And then it was suddenly quiet, like
Harry nodded.
Draco cut himself off before he could finish that thought. No use in entertaining impossible pipe-dreams.
Harry tried to fight the tears welling up in his eyes, but it was pointless. He felt like every feeling of loneliness, pain and abandonment was being wrenched out of his chest, until it was all drained from him, until there was none of the cold left, but plenty of space for warmth. Narcissa gave his shoulder a comforting squeeze, as Remus tightened his arms around him even further. He could feel Draco at his side, rubbing soothing circles on his back as he cried.
“I know
replied, stepping aside to let him pass.
As always I hope you enjoyed it! God I wish Ao3 had a messaging function, cause your comments always make me so happy, I wanna continue those conversations :D
Harry grinned and put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him into his side. Butterflies filled Draco’s stomach again as he leaned against Harry, placing his hand on Harry’s thigh. Casual. Because this was just how things were and they had nothing to hide.
“I’ll tell the Weasleys and Hermione,” he insisted, unwilling to dwell on the confusing feelings rising in him.
Eventually, Harry pulled back, resting his forehead against Draco’s.
He shook his head in exasperation. That woman.
get used to kissing Draco. When they finally broke apart again, they were both panting slightly, and Draco gave him a devilish smirk.
Remus stood back and watched as Harry demonstrated the spell, gave a quick explanation and then went off to form groups, always pairing a couple of younger with some older students and mixing houses wildly. The first groups were already starting when he was barely half done.
He cleaned up his work station the way Severus had taught them. There was a distinct logic to it—Harry hadn’t dared to question it then and by now it was a habit—and he found that he was faster than even Hermione. As he waited for her and Ron to finish, he watched the Slytherins across the room. Pansy was keeping up a steady stream of chatter which seemed to pearl right off Blaise and Draco, while Theodore Nott had his head lowered and seemed utterly focused on packing his things. According to Draco, Theo had spoken up for him and the DA.
Last night, Harry had crossed that invisible line when he’d put Draco on his back, kissed a trail down his torso and without warning put his lips on Draco’s cock. The memory alone had Draco almost coming in his pants. Of course, the universe couldn’t let Draco have nice things and they’d been rudely interrupted by Remus, knocking on their door to remind them to be ready by nine, before Harry’s mouth had a chance to get properly acquainted with Draco’s private parts. After he’d left again, Harry hadn’t resumed his earlier course of action much to Draco’s dismay. Not that it hadn’t been enjoyable—gods, it had been; it always was—but now that Harry had crossed that line, a whole world of fantasies had suddenly shifted into reach and Draco couldn’t get it out of his head anymore. Most of all, he wanted to get his own mouth onto Harry.
“Listen, Draco, I have a solution to your issue. I have a place for you to go to over the summer. It has excellent protection, far better even than if you went to France—it’s frankly the only sensible option, as far as I can see.”
Severus recoiled, slamming his shields up harder, but it was too late. He had already seen, had already caught the tail end of the memory, holding it, dragging it back up through all of Severus’ defences and replaying it in full. Severus pushed down his fear, continuously reinforcing his other shields. He couldn’t let him see anything else. He couldn’t let him see— He just couldn’t.
“You won’t do him any favours by running off on a vengeance trip,“ Narcissa insisted.
Minerva looked shocked. “I can’t believe you’re so calm about this. This could change everything! The prophecy— It might not even be about Harry in the first place! It is rather specific regarding parentage. Does this not concern you at all, Albus?”
“I’m afraid that’s a pointless discussion to have with him,” Draco cut in and Harry looked down at the Slytherin in surprise.
“Harry! You shouldn’t be using those spells!”
reason—why he’d avoided to let things go any further between them. The fear of Draco’s reaction, of him being disgusted by Harry, of him changing his mind about them because of it. Now that Draco knew, now that he had seen, Harry’s desire to
The twins were probably not going to question Harry’s choices, they rarely did, and the same went for Ginny. They might think it strange, but would ultimately trust Harry’s judgement. But explaining to Ron that Draco was not, in fact, a slimy git and a bully, but actually a rather wonderful person? He had no idea how to even get him to listen. Hermione might be slightly more understanding, but considering her personal history with Draco, even that was debatable. And then there was the history between the Weasley family and the Malfoy family as a whole. True, that animosity had come first and foremost from Lucius Malfoy, but Draco had perpetuated it, and Harry wasn’t sure how easily Mr Weasley would forget about such a feud.
“Don’t be a baby,” said Hermione. “I’m sure you can borrow one, or look into one of ours.”
Severus nodded. He’d had the same thought. While he didn’t believe that Harry was in immediate danger from Albus, it was clear that the headmaster was not exactly careful with which situations he let Harry walk into.
When Narcissa announced that lunch would be ready in just about an hour, Severus decided to go take a shower and put on some proper clothes. He couldn’t simply stay in his pyjamas all day, no matter how tired he still felt.
“Draco,
Harry took his time to pull on the robes, hoping incessantly that Draco would already be done by the time he went back out. He lingered so long that he was only half-surprised when the sound of a curtain being pulled back announced someone entering his cubicle.
“This isn’t working, we need a Healer! We have to bring him to St. Mungos,” said Remus, sounding rather frantic, and bringing Harry’s focus back to Severus.
with an unknown curse swirling around you? What if it had latched onto Harry? You know how impulsive he is,
Overall, time passed peacefully, pleasantly and productively. After finalising the two notebooks for Draco and himself, Harry had crafted a similar thing to communicate with Severus—this time in form of a simple small scroll on which messages erased themselves after they’d been answered. He had offered to make two more for Remus and Narcissa, but Remus had only smiled and reminded him of Sirius’ mirror, while Narcissa insisted on regular letters from him when he went back to school instead. For the first time in his life, Harry almost wished summer wouldn’t end so soon, his usual desperation to return to Hogwarts replaced with the longing to stay here with his family. With Draco.
He bottled the finished shampoo and sealed it. Severus was still staring at him disbelievingly.
He had gotten through a little over half of it when the door opened and Remus walked in.
“How— How is he?” Severus finally asked, after a few seconds of silence.
Harry unpacked package after package, revealing several books, a knitted jumper with a big H on it, a variety of products from the twins’ shop, and new Quidditch gloves. A book on defence magic, along with a shrinkable practice dummy that could be set up in the garden, turned out to be from Remus, which meant they were through the Weasley-part of the gift pile. The numerous packages from Draco’s mother were next, and Draco was as curious as Harry as the latter tore into the paper to reveal…more clothing?
Not the route Harry would’ve taken, but he supposed it did the trick. Neville was staring at him slack-jawed, and even Luna put down her magazine with a shocked expression, which was a real rarity from Luna. There weren’t many things that could faze her.
“What if we run into someone we know?” he asked, eyes wide.
A mixture of triumph and satisfaction welled up in Harry. So he’d been right.
Ron gaped at him and Hermione’s eyebrows rose almost all the way to her hairline, but Harry’s attention was on Draco’s reaction. Sure, he had spent every night here since their shopping trip, and most of his clothes and toiletries had found their way into Harry’s closet and bathroom, but they had never explicitly agreed that Draco had fully moved in here.
“Severus,” said Narcissa, giving him a polite smile, “I owe you a great debt for this. I am eternally grateful for your help.”
He extended a hand towards Draco to help him up. The Slytherin groaned, but took it and let Harry pull him off the bed. They brushed their teeth quickly and Harry went back to the bedroom so Draco could take his shower. It still made no sense to him how anyone could opt to shower in the evening instead of in the morning. If Harry didn’t get his morning shower he was useless for hours.
“Is it always this bad?” he asked into the silence of the dining room.
“Very well,” said Narcissa. “I shall speak with him. Is there a way to contact him safely?”
“You fancied me since third year?”
They lapsed into silence and Harry snuggled closer into Draco’s embrace. Perhaps a locking charm hadn’t been the worst idea after all.
father!
“Sorry, love,” said Draco as he closed the door and sauntered over to Harry, giving him a kiss as he sat down next to him. “So, what can’t be a coincidence?”
Harry suppressed a sigh and answered, “Because a regular Protego doesn’t always do the trick. Some curses can break through a rigid shield like that, in which case you’d have to adjust it to give it some flexibility.”
Draco took one of Harry’s hands and pressed it to his chest. Suddenly, it was easy to match his own breathing to Draco’s, as he felt Draco’s heart beat under his fingers. Slowly, the world became clearer again, and Harry recognised Grimmauld Place.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek to snap out of his thoughts. Narcissa was casting stasis charms over Severus’ wounds, slowing the bleeding only marginally. Harry hurried to her side, wanting to help, but she shook her head.
“Draco, I love it,” Harry interrupted, smiling brightly now. Setting the box aside, he leaned towards Draco and captured his lips in a kiss.
He was saved by his mother announcing that it was time for Harry to unpack his presents. That got everyone’s attention, and anyone standing or sitting in another part of the room joined the main seating area again. Almost nobody still sat in their original seat, in fact, only Severus, Remus and the twins had not moved at all. It reinforced the feeling of a much more relaxed atmosphere than before.
He chuckled, then set to penning a similar letter for Ron, with less academics and more Quidditch talk. When he was done, he could join Draco on the couch for all of five minutes before Narcissa’s chiming charm called them down for breakfast.
Narcissa smiled, saying, “I’m certain they won’t simply abandon you, judging from all I’ve heard about them. They clearly care for you, they wouldn’t just
“We talked about this; I don’t think I ever really hated you,” argued Draco.
If there had been any doubt left, that the removal of Lily’s charms had affected far more than Harry’s appearance, it was most definitely gone now. The formerly rather academically disinterested boy was absorbing information like a sponge now. And he wasn’t half bad at potions either, although Severus was grudgingly forced to admit that he probably never had been that bad at it in the first place and the main explanation for his subpar performance in the subject so far was a combination of his own bias and sabotage by the Slytherins.
Anger flared in Draco’s gut again and he tightened his arms further.
Also, naturally, the prophecy is taken verbatim from the books and is obviously not mine in any way.
With Remus momentarily lost in thought, the conversation at the table turned towards the shopping trip in Diagon Alley—Harry was stubbornly ignoring Severus again—and soon enough, the boys excused themselves, disappearing upstairs in Harry’s room. Remus watched them go, idly rolling his glass back and forth on the table.
“I will,” he promised, stirring the mixture in his cauldron. “I hope Harry won’t try to avoid me once we’re back at the castle, that would complicate things.”
“Only identical twins achieve a fully white bond,” replied Narcissa evenly. “Regular siblings reach approximately the same match as parents and their children.”
“That well?”
When Harry finally approached the Slytherins, Remus could practically feel the tension in the room rise. He wasn’t the only one watching that particular interaction.
For a while, these individual conversations continued. At some point, Fleur left her seat next to Bill and shooed Mr Weasley out of his, as the discussion about the wedding cake got more heated. To Draco’s surprise, Mr Weasley did not take Fleur’s vacated spot, but instead walked right up to the empty armchair next to Draco’s mother’s seat and struck up a quiet conversation with her. Across the room, Mrs Weasley lifted an eyebrow at her husband, but otherwise nobody reacted. Draco tried to pick up enough of his mother’s conversation to understand what they were talking about, but it proved an impossible endeavour while simultaneously keeping up with the twins. He was so preoccupied, he barely registered Granger calling Harry’s name before Harry was already getting up, brushing Draco’s shoulder for the briefest moment as he went to take Fleur’s empty seat.
“Oh please, Harry, do call me Molly. It’s high time we left the formalities behind,” Molly interrupted, and Severus had to smother a laugh. Of course she would offer Harry to call her Molly
Romilda frowned properly this time, and Harry lost the last bit of his self-control and dissolved into laughter, Neville and Luna joining in, while Ginny just grinned at the dumbfounded group of girls. Unfortunately, his outburst had Romilda turn her gaze on him, and after a second her eyes widened. There were two audible gasps as realisation hit the other two girls, but Romilda had already replaced her surprise with a dazzling smile aimed at Harry.
Resigned, he buried his head in the pillow again, his mind caught in a loop of replaying the scene in the hallway and berating himself for it. It felt like mere minutes later when another knock sounds on his door.
And then there was that little detail of how much Potter’s exterior had changed all of a sudden. Potter’s new face had completely thrown him off balance. Not that Draco would ever admit it, but Potter had always been stupidly attractive—even in his weird ill-fitted Muggle clothes—but now? Downright ridiculous. Even the slightly longer, jet-black hair that came down to his jaw in loose waves suited him.
“As if you would have refused her in my place,” Ron accused.
Severus conjured a shield, barely in time to block Harry’s first attack. No hesitation there, alright then. Keeping up his shield, Severus fired three different jinxes at his son, all aimed at different angles, but Harry deflected them—still not raising a shield of his own, but rather aiming weak spells directly at Severus’ incoming attacks. It was not a strategy that he was likely to use in a real fight, but it admittedly allowed him to preserve his strength better than a permanent shield would have.
asked Ron, his face scrunching up as if he was in pain.
Twenty minutes later, the front door of Grimmauld Place closed behind the last Weasley and Harry let out a relieved sigh. No matter how much he loved them all, that had been exhausting.
“It can’t be,” Mrs Weasley said, an expression of pure shock on her face.
Inside, Dumbledore was lying on one couch apparently asleep, Severus was slumped on the other, his face buried in his hands. His head snapped up at the sound of the door opening, regarding them with wary eyes.
Barely ten minutes later, they walked into the dining room for breakfast, where Draco’s mother immediately pulled Harry into a hug to wish him a happy birthday. They settled down at the table and before long, Remus and Severus entered, also extending birthday wishes as they took their seats.
Remus poked his head into the room and informed them that the Weasleys were about to leave, so Ron and Hermione should gather their things. Relieved he jumped off the couch, pulling Draco up with him. He ignored Hermione’s pointed looks as best as he could as they headed downstairs and he began to make his round of goodbyes. When it was Hermione’s turn, she merely said that they would talk about this next time, but let it go otherwise. He knew her well enough to understand that as an additional birthday gift.
“It happens occasionally.” Harry gave him a firm kiss, then pulled away completely, picking up his Invisibility Cloak. Draco bit back a needy sound at the loss of contact.
“Yeah, right,” Harry scoffed.
room.”
Draco smiled and summoned his quill. He hesitated for a moment, unsure how to answer. Harry hadn’t bothered with the usual formalities of a letter, so maybe Draco shouldn’t either. Maybe he should try to treat it like an ordinary conversation, just…written. The idea suddenly felt rather odd.
Narcissa. Disbelievingly, Harry checked his watch: Half past seven. He must’ve missed the chime that usually called everyone for dinner. He’d been lying around moping for more than four hours.
He flipped them over in one smooth motion, his mouth still laving down Draco’s throat towards his chest. Long, delicate fingers tangled in his hair, tugging just hard enough to make him hiss slightly. Still trailing kisses down Draco’s pale torso, he glanced up at his boyfriend’s face and the sight nearly took his breath away again. How could anyone be
The fucking prophecy. Voldemort. The atrium flickered before his inner eye, glass shards on the floor, spells ricocheting off the walls.
“Yes, because I don’t think Sirius would’ve hated Harry even if he’d found out he’s
Snape gave the Malfoys a pointed look.
“Took more than you can handle, Potter?”
“You don’t sound too enthused.”
Harry didn’t respond. He hadn’t ever thought about asking Pomfrey about it, but it sounded so logical now. They sat silently for a long moment, before Draco spoke up.
“It’s only because I know how you fight now,” Harry replied with a shrug, then pointed his wand at Remus and murmured a healing spell.
Severus gave him an incredulous look. “You brew your own shampoo?”
He’d see them again soon. Both of them.
Harry furrowed his brows, and for a moment he didn’t get what Draco meant. Then understanding kicked in. Severus was a Death Eater spy, if Voldemort heard even the slightest rumour that Harry might be his son, he would either demand that Severus bring Harry to him or loose trust in Severus immediately, potentially using him to get to Harry or even killing him on the spot. No, there was absolutely no way that their father-son relation could become public knowledge. For some reason, Harry felt a twinge of regret at that.
Remus fired a chain of curses at him, followed by another rock and then a second series of offensive spells. Harry caught the first attack only barely and didn’t manage to fully evade the rock, hissing sharply as it hit him in the shoulder. The second wave of spells broke his hastily thrown up shield, but
“Severus! You’re awake,” she exclaimed, ushering him to sit down before drawing her wand and checking him over. A mother through and through. “You must be starving, we’ve put some breakfast away for you because we weren’t sure when you’d wake.”
“Yeah?” Harry purred, nuzzling into Draco’s neck and nipping at his ear. “What’s so bad about that?”
“Draco,” he gasped, trying to focus on getting the confirmation he needed before he completely lost himself. “Can—”
Drawing in another gulp of air, Harry nodded. This was fine.
Severus turned to look at him.
Albus seemed unperturbed. “Yes, I’m afraid it looks like Lily was indeed unfaithful. As to who the father is, I can only speculate. By all means, if you have a guess do speak out. It should be no trouble at all to confirm or deny whether a specific person is or isn’t Harry’s father. All it takes is to look at their magical signatures.”
He carefully counted six strands of Asian Dragon hair and dropped them into his cauldron, which made the concoction inside glow brightly for a few seconds.
I gotta write more Weasley-twins content, I remembered how much I love them during this chapter.
“What’s that supposed to mean? How can you not know?”
To his horror, George gave him a contemplative look and nodded. “We should probably talk about that eventually, yes.”
Harry nodded, his expression still full of joy after his relationship with Draco appeared to have been accepted—or at least not too openly disapproved of—by most of the Weasleys. Severus left quickly and went upstairs into his lab, where he’d hidden the basket that he had picked up earlier in the day. He tried to calm his nerves. If Harry hated it, he’d simply get him something else, he only wished that he didn’t have to do this in front of quite so many people.
Draco looked like he was about to dash upstairs, but Harry held him back. He wordlessly conjured his Patronus, causing Draco’s jaw to drop.
“I need you to tell me the incantation, otherwise I have to go look for worse-suited alternatives which could take ages.”
Draco looked anxious and Harry reached out to him reflexively, running a soothing hand up his arm.
But the main reason for Harry’s astonishment was the right side of the room. While there was still plenty of open space to practice in the left half, the right half of the room was covered in a fully formed landscape. Uneven, earthy ground with several trees, stumps, big and small rocks, and even a narrow stream of water that originated from what looked like a slightly elevated cave. It was
“I think Harry will be able to forgive you, if you change your behaviour.”
“Why don’t you sit down, Harry? Here,” said Remus, holding out a small piece of chocolate.
Hermione looked aghast at the very idea of relying on Harry’s memory of adjusted instructions rather than the book. He didn’t press the point further and they reached the Great Hall and ate their dinner in silence.
She glanced at the new door to the former side-room, much larger than the previous one, and asked smilingly, “Redecorating?”
Before he knew what was happening, Potter was back on his feet and up in Draco’s face. He couldn’t even take a breath to snap something nasty when his back already hit the wall hard. Potter had his fists in Draco’s robes and he was so
Draco had to resist the urge to do something very stupid.
Harry didn’t respond and simply walked over to his room. He didn’t have the nerves to deal with petty taunts now.
Harry regarded him thoughtfully.
They were asleep within seconds.
“And yet you didn’t agree with the boy when he said that his mother would’ve never—”
“Why don’t you just summon Kreacher?” asked Draco.
Draco came running back into the room, several vials of potions hovering before him, and joined the table next to Harry. Without so much as a second of hesitation, Harry snatched a blue potion he knew to be labelled Blood-Replenisher and poured it into Severus’ mouth, making him swallow with a charm. Immediately, the blood spilling from the chest wounds increased.
all summer. It’s unhealthy to be so stuck up over extended periods of time.”
The words were breathless and Harry smirked up at the Slytherin, his lips still around Draco’s nipple. “Harry, please, I need to touch you,
“Sir, I meant to ask you something,” he began. “Would it be possible to make the DA an official club? If war is at our doorstep, some extra defence training can’t hurt, right?”
Resolutely, Remus pushed himself out of the water, pulled the plug from the drain and showered the bubbles off his skin. Best not to think about it.
, but it definitely wasn’t,” Draco explained, looking somewhat irritated. “It was wandless magic, bound with runes he drew onto your chest, and quite a powerful spell—”
Minerva’s tone was gentle, but it unnerved Severus all the same. He didn’t want to think about Lily. She was gone, no good came from dragging up these memories.
“Probably not,” she replied.
Harry gave a satisfied nod at the cowed crowd. “Good, now that that’s cleared up, let’s move on to that demonstration I promised.” He turned to Remus with a slight smirk. “What do you think, Remus, duelling floor or natural terrain?”
right now. “Pick whichever room you want.”
Remus laughed. He couldn’t fault the boy for being preoccupied upon finding out that his presumed father had accepted him as a surrogate son, despite knowing who his actual father was, whom he despised.
“I know this is a rather difficult situation for you, but can we at least talk about this?” he asked gently, eyes pleading.
“I expected…more. I expected you to be angry—”
“Alright, you can come along if I ever ‘run into danger like a Gryffindor’ again, okay?”
“Remus! Come in, I’ve got to tell you something,” Harry said, pulling Remus over to the sitting area enthusiastically.
“I don’t follow,” he said in a much milder tone than before. “Why would it be your fault? If anything it would be my fault. I shouldn’t have asked her to keep secrets.”
Harry gave him a heartbreakingly sad smile then and Draco’s insides twisted painfully, his chest constricting. Echoes of Harry’s story about his relatives reverberated through Draco’s mind, and suddenly it all clicked into place.
Draco had meanwhile recovered enough from Harry’s announcement to give Ron his signature Malfoy-eyebrow and drawled, “Yes, Ronald, this is my room. Problem?”
It hadn’t been too long ago that Pansy had insisted that she was entirely heterosexual, now here they were with her unashamedly thirsting over potential pretty girls somewhere in Italy. He was glad to see that his friend had gotten over her anxiety of coming out—and her family had taken it well it seemed.
A tense silence settled over the room.
Draco felt an unreasonable surge of jealousy at that and he hoped to Merlin it didn’t show on his face. How could he be jealous of someone who had
But circumstances were cruel and as a result, Harry would look ten years older again as soon as he opened his eyes, set his jaw and readied himself to face another day. It really wasn’t fair.
He tapped the message with his wand to send it and the ink turned from black to sapphire blue. Draco summoned a piece of parchment from his desk and, using the notebook as an underlay, started to write his usual letter to his mother to let her know that he had arrived safely. He’d barely gotten one paragraph down when the notebook gave a soft chime.
“Well not anymore apparently,” replied Harry, pulling back a little. “I— I thought so, too, you know? I thought we were getting somewhere, and I wanted to talk to him about it today. About— About being a family. But I was wrong.” He scoffed bitterly. “Of course I was wrong. It was naïve of me to believe we could actually get over years of hatred for each other. The only reason he was so civil until now was because he felt like he had to. Yesterday he saw that the Weasleys won’t abandon me, which means he can leave me with them without feeling guilty. Gods, I am such an idiot for ever believing he could want me.”
Both Narcissa and Remus gave him annoyingly soft smiles, and he stood more abruptly than would’ve been necessary. Draco sneered at him as he ended his spell and sat back down at the table, while Harry moved to stand in front of Snape, whose core was still pulsing in front of him.
“Draco—”
He felt a hand on his and looked up at Remus.
He smirked.
Draco wanted him so badly. But it would never be possible, so it was better to avoid thinking of it at all, even as he secretly—so secretly he even convinced himself that there was nothing—worried his way through third year during which Potter was apparently hunted by a mass murderer, immediately followed by the goddamn Triwizard Tournament which Potter
Harry flinched. He had successfully avoided to think about how he felt so far, and he grimaced at her for putting him on the spot like that. She didn’t relent.
Harry laughed, and the sound finally unraveled the tight knot in Draco’s chest.
“Because that was her argument! ‘Mr Potter is continuing Potions as well. If he can keep up, you can as well.’”
Draco gasped, his mouth falling open in shock.
“It’s my birthday on Wednesday,” Harry began carefully, “and I was hoping to see Hermione and the Weasleys.”
“If that’s what you want, too? I— I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed—”
Draco’s face blanched.
Severus closed his eyes and shuddered as memories flooded his senses. His nerve-endings were tingling, a hollow echo of the Cruciatus he’d endured. He steeled himself to relive it all, but before he could even take a breath, Narcissa spoke up.
“You know—” Weasley’s voice dropped too low to understand, but Severus was fairly sure he was talking about him. About the fact that he was Harry’s father. Because that was something that had to be talked about, something to be discussed.
Potter didn’t hex him. Instead, he set his jaw angrily and tried to shove Draco out of the way. Prepared this time, Draco managed to push him back into the kitchen. When it came to physical strength, they had always been quite evenly matched—if Draco wasn’t taken by surprise that is. Draco could only hope that all those changes Potter had gone through didn’t include a sudden increase in muscle tone.
Neville was still staring at him quite intently and Harry sighed. The sooner he told them, the sooner they’d get used to it.
“Draco,” he choked out, and he knew that he sounded desperate. He didn’t particularly care, though, not when Draco looked at him as if was about to devour him whole. Then a smirk spread on Draco’s lips, just as one finger dipped ever so slightly below the waistband.
“Other spells I created? As I said, I invented all sorts of spells, so yes.”
Letting go of Harry, he turned to the journals and picked up the one Harry hadn’t written into yet. It was an elegant thing with thick pages, bound in smooth black leather. His fingers brushed over something cold at the back of it and he curiously turned it over. A silver plaque was embedded in the leather, displaying three letters:
At first, Harry had been mostly caught up on worries about Sirius’ hypothetical reaction to it all. Remus couldn’t blame him. The grief of Sirius’ death was still so fresh, it was hard to separate it from everything else that was going on. He himself still found it hard to breathe at times, remembering the nights spent with Sirius in this—his room. It wasn’t as bad as he’d expected it to be, which left him feeling an odd mix of relief and guilt. He had lost Sirius before, along with James and Lily and Peter, all of them at once. He had grieved them all, even though Peter hadn’t deserved it as he now knew. He had grieved Sirius, despite believing him to be a traitor at the time, he’d grieved him as if he had died. He had, in a way.
“Never,” Harry readily agreed, and Remus finally left, pulling the door shut behind him.
intentions?”
“This is stupid.”
Albus’ words from three nights ago came back to him. Yes, he’d known Lily well. Better than anyone else, certainly better than
“And I meant that, but circumstances have changed,” sighed Harry.
“My turn?” he asked with a grin. He moved to switch their positions, but Harry held him back and shook his head. Draco frowned.
He shook his head and handed her the parchment Albus had written the address on.
“Thank you, Severus,” Albus said, his eyes twinkling merrily.
Harry sighed. “People can’t know about us.”
“At least they will listen to you,” said Minerva.
“I knew you were a Death Eater. I figured you’d have done quite a few reprehensible things. Of course I’d rather you hadn’t told him, I’m definitely not happy about it, but even if you hadn’t, if the prophecy is true it wouldn’t have changed a thing, right? Chances are he would have come after me—or after Neville, I suppose—eventually, for whatever reason. It takes more than that for me to
“You’re confident enough in those speculations to show them to me,” Harry countered.
“Healing form, got it from a book,” Harry murmured, his words slurring together slightly.
Narcissa looked up, her light blue eyes laden with emotion. She smiled a little as she replied, “Every single time. When Draco left for his first year, I could barely do anything all day. I told myself it would get better, that I would get used to it, but I never did. Every year it’s like giving a part of me away. Two, this time.” Her eyes filled with concern then. “How are you holding up on your first day of staying behind?”
It took Harry a second to focus his vision. When it cleared, he found Draco’s eyes glazed over with lust. His breath caught at the thought that
“No, my lord, the old man has made no progress with rallying forces to oppose you. Even with the Ministry now acknowledging your return, his efforts to gather supporters against you are futile.”
True enough, the snake had slithered under Harry’s clothes, and Severus could only assume that she settled either around his arm or his chest to stay out of sight. At Grimmauld Place, Harry had usually carried her around his neck, but that’d be too obvious for the Great Hall.
“True, but it’s frustrating all the same. You know how I feel about the moods and whims of teenagers.”
“Draco, darling, you have to eat,” Narcissa urged gently.
“That’s good to hear,” Remus said with a soft smile. There were a few beats of silence.
Another nod.
But Draco said none of that, keeping his eyes glued to his plate instead. Harry sighed and squeezed his arm.
Harry just shook his head disbelievingly, looking back at the scroll in his hands.
“To you? I distinctly recall you refusing to participate in this wager because, and I quote, ‘Potter isn’t worth two seconds of your attention’. Granted, that was a long time ago, but—”
“Of course, don’t worry, Remus!”
Harry’s expression darkened and he felt irritation bubble up again in his gut.
Usually, his position would ensure his safety. He was too valuable to risk losing, but in this state the Dark Lord wouldn’t care, wouldn’t even consider Severus’ strategic value before shooting whatever curse first came to mind at him.
“Let’s just be glad it all turned out alright,” he said, as he pulled a bar of chocolate from his pocket, broke off a piece and began to nibble on it. “Will you have to report this to Albus?”
The hallway was completely silent. For a moment he wondered where the hell everyone had gone. On second thought, though, he decided he didn’t care, so long as they weren’t between him and his room.
“I hope so. But there are other things I’m afraid he won’t forgive so easily.”
“Vulnera Sanentur, three times,” Harry surmised, getting a confirmative nod from Severus.
Remus smiled widely and Severus found himself staring. Had he always smiled like that? How had he never noticed?
hoping it would provide more introductory information. He wasn’t disappointed.
As always I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading <3
Severus cast another glance over at Sirona to make sure that the snake was settled safely out of the way before turning towards the door to the little side-room in his quarters. He hadn’t really ever worked with the castle’s magic before, except when he’d originally set up the wards around his rooms. It was a strange sort of magic, one that he wasn’t familiar with at all.
Only once Severus’ scent had finally faded almost completely did Remus’ mortification catch up with him. Severus had seen him
“You loved her,” Harry repeated with a hint of scepticism in his tone.
“Inprecatio Expurgo!”
“Who is he?” asked Neville, staring at his note in confusion.
“Chocolate?”
“How about we test that?” Severus’ voice dripped with danger.
“I’m fine, what is it?”
“No,” Harry refused. “I won’t accept that it has to be this way, there has to be a solution to it.”
to cuddle, it bordered on witchcraft. One more unfairly perfect thing about him to add to Draco’s list—a list that was getting decidedly too long.
Harry’s hips jerked again, and Draco freed his hand to still them. Green eyes opened to look down at him, black pupils almost swallowing the entire iris. He winked and Harry groaned, letting his head fall back, eyes closing again.
“This was delicious, thank you,” said Harry eventually, as he finished the last bit of food on his plate. Narcissa smiled.
towards him. He felt like he’d been thrown into some sort of alternate universe, where absolutely nothing made sense anymore.
“Remus of course. Harry was planning to approach you after the feast if I recall correctly. Remus already agreed to it.”
“I’ll miss you,” he whispered, stealing another kiss.
“Touch me,” gasped Draco.
Harry gave a relieved nod as she stood up and cleared away the cups. “Er— If you need anything,” he began, but she shook her head, smiling.
Remus shrugged, taking a casual step closer to him, then another. He heard Severus’ heart react, which only encouraged his own to accelerate as well.
Harry nodded and followed his example. For a moment, they both watched the potion simmer quietly. Harry’s thoughts wandered back to Severus. Why had Voldemort called for his followers? Death Eater meetings before lunch time couldn’t be a good sign.
“Sorry,” they mumbled, and Harry gave them a gracious nod. He didn’t want to fight with them, he just wished they could accept that he was capable of making his own decisions.
Harry Potter’s head was throbbing. He sat up with a groan and rubbed his temples, keeping his eyes squeezed shut. He reached blindly for his glasses but only grasped at air. Confused, he opened his eyes to a dark room. He wasn’t in his dorm.
Harry still couldn’t look at him.
He buried his face in his hands with a groan and nodded.
For a moment, there was total silence in the kitchen.
Remus gave him a reproving look. “It’s not that easy.”
“Actually, you’re right,” Severus interrupted him. “It appears this is your concern.”
Harry stared at her, confused. Hadn’t Snape told her? Did she really not know why he’d changed?
“Draco,” Harry said softly, a smile that could’ve charmed a Dementor on his face.
Harry crossed his arms and considered the spell. It seemed straightforward enough, no doubt, and he generally trusted Narcissa’s word—however the hell he’d gotten to that point—but it wasn’t a definitive yes-or-no answer. What if the differences to the bond were subtle? What if the link between unrelated people would glow almost equally as bright? Would he be able to tell the difference?
don’t hate me anymore, they still do and they still have good reasons.”
Minerva gave him a suffering look and took another sip of firewhisky. He laughed.
“Well, there’s more than one facet to this. The first one has very little to do with any particular student personally, but is a question of reputation. I am well-known to favour pure-blooded Slytherins, while bullying half-bloods and muggle-borns from other houses. This reputation was deliberately built for over a decade, so that when the Dark Lord returned, as Albus always insisted he would, my loyalty to his ideals would not be questioned. It gives me no pleasure to snub talented students, and I’ve always made sure that end-term and end-of-year exams were graded fairly. The second is more personal. I admit that I’ve held biases against various students in your class in particular, that were founded upon personal grudges. While Mr Longbottom, for example, has certainly earned some of my disapproval through his subpar performance in my classroom, the reason why I was especially harsh with him is that the prophecy could’ve applied to him as well. Had the Dark Lord chosen Longbottom instead of you, Lily would’ve lived, and for that I resented him. That he was alive when she wasn’t.”
“Thank you,” he replied quietly, feeling somewhat uncomfortable with her fussing.
Harry was about to protest, when Severus’ arm came to rest around his shoulders again, pulling him into a proper hug this time.
Draco nodded silently. Finally, Severus turned back to Harry, and Harry felt a complicated mix of emotions well up in him. This was goodbye, in a way. They’d see each other in only a few hours at the welcoming feast, but just like his relationship with Draco, his connection to Severus had to stay secret. They were back to hating each other, at least in public. No more quick conversations on the stairs, no more easy banter—Severus wouldn’t even be able to call him Harry anymore. He felt a lump form in his throat and swallowed hard.
Draco furrowed his brows as he scanned Harry’s face. He looked exhausted.
Draco laughed. Yes, definitely his favourite Weasleys.
She gave him a scrutinising look then, grey-blue eyes boring into him.
“Don’t be silly, Draco, I’m paying of course,” his mother declared with a slight eye-roll.
He wasn’t as bothered by it as he’d expected himself to be. Instead, he had written her a three page letter explaining as well as he could how the wandless healing forms worked, which had successfully distracted Hermione from her irritation—at least judging from the next letter, but who knew with Hermione.
It was too much.
It gave Harry plenty to think about. He continued to interrogate Draco about how life in Slytherin was, and for the first time since his sorting Harry wondered whether he’d made the right choice to ask the hat for Gryffindor. Slytherin seemed to have so much more…camaraderie. How ironic.
“You didn’t have a shield,” Severus interrupted.
“It’s fine,” Harry interrupted. “You can stay, sir.”
His initials. He looked up at Harry and his face must’ve betrayed his astonishment because Harry just gave him a sheepish smile and lifted the other notebook, showing him the matching golden plaque with the initials
was undeniably handsome; all slender, lean muscle and unrealistically pale skin. Harry’s gaze wandered upwards over Draco’s neck to his face.
ever since he’d learnt about him and Draco, but for a good while he had been able to tell himself that they were obviously taking it slow and that he had plenty of time. For some inexplicable reason though, things had changed after Harry’s birthday. Drastically.
When he turned to Draco, Severus’ expression softened infinitesimally, the change too subtle for anyone else to notice.
“Slytherin? How the hell did that happen?” he asked. Harry gave him a sheepish smile.
Simple enough, Harry would think of something—he had plenty of experience with getting into trouble after all. He had just stowed the scroll away again after sending the message, when another knock came from the door.
“Yeah, because he feels like he has to. He
Dumbledore nodded, his smile giving way to an impersonal expression. “There are several things entailed in our meetings, but in this first one we must address an organisational matter before we can begin. As you have surely deduced at the welcoming feast, I approve of your choice of supervisor for the DA. We must, however, still decide on a time and place for these meetings to take place. Would you happen to have any suggestions?”
She frowned at him, but the plea in his face must have convinced her, because she eventually nodded with a sigh. “If you say so, Harry. But I truly believe that he feels the same way as you, he’s just—”
“Oh, hey there Neville, I didn’t see you. Why are you on the floor?” Harry asked curiously.
Harry laughed softly, and it soothed Remus down to the core. Without even a trace of fear in his eyes, his cub snuggled into him as if he was nothing but a big dog, rather than a monster.
He didn’t answer when she bid him goodbye and only looked up once he heard the door fall shut behind her.
“Professor Moody said it in fourth year,” she shot back angrily.
He put the speech away.
“I think we shouldn’t tell them anything yet,” he said slowly. “We’ll do it eventually, of course, I don’t want us having to hide forever. But for now I kinda want to have this—us—just to ourselves for a bit. They’ll just bother us with questions or tell us we can’t close our doors if we tell them.” He smiled and gave Harry a slow kiss. “I just got you, I don’t want to let others throw in their opinions on us just yet. I want you to myself for a while.”
Harry suppressed a snort and merely nodded, keeping his face neutral. He wondered how Dumbledore would react if he knew how familiar Harry was getting with wandless magic. Everyday spells came naturally to him now, so much so that he had to pay active heed to using his wand for them in public.
“Or you could duel me,” said Severus casually.
He stared at her in astonishment for a moment. How had she timed that so well? She couldn’t possibly have known when he’d wake up.
“You’re quite right, Severus, we must understand the situation before we can allow it to become public knowledge. I’m afraid Harry can not return to the safety of his mother’s blood protection this summer. He’d undoubtedly be watched, even as he remains protected, and the change would be immediately reported back to Voldemort. No, he must remain hidden.”
“I cannot hope to defeat Albus Dumbledore one-on-one,” Severus argued quietly, hoping incessantly that the Dark Lord wouldn’t actually give him an order he’d be forced to refuse—which would indeed blow his cover as a spy.
Remus gave him a surprised look, then his expression turned thoughtful. “Your eyesight must’ve been affected by Lily’s charms,” he mused and Harry’s breath caught.
For a moment, Severus wondered whether he should be stricter with Harry about that. Was he supposed to keep the boys in check, prevent them from fooling around too much? As soon as the thought had formed, a laugh rose in his throat and he shook his head.
“Remus, we’ll see each other once the DA supervision begins. Draco,” Severus continued, turning to clap Draco on the shoulder, “we’ll see each other soon enough. Don’t let your guard down, never forget that there could be a spy among your friends.”
Harry didn’t think, probably wouldn’t have been able to think if he had tried, he just moved. His first instinct was to dash to the front door, get out of the house and to safety. But the hallway was wrong, the front door wasn’t where it was supposed to be. Cupboard then, even if that meant being locked in—no, wait, he had a room now, didn’t he? But the cupboard wasn’t there either, and the stairs were in the wrong place. The ringing in his ears was getting louder and his lungs were burning.
Opening the tap for his bath, he eyed the various oils and bubble bath options lined on the shelf. They were leftovers from Sirius. A memory of the two of them in this bathtub flashed through his mind, and he blushed, before quickly smothering the thought. It wouldn’t do to get himself all riled up with no way to properly get rid of that energy again. It was always worse around the full moon. Like the animal in him was pushing its urges onto him. Although admittedly, it had led to rather mind-blowing sex in the past.
“Yes, I did, it just wasn’t a Protego,” Harry insisted. “Anyway, your spells hit my shield and bounced—I simply timed my own attack to pass my shield at the exact moment yours bounced, so it would look like yours turned around rather than deflected.”
She returned it with a wink and declared, “People like us have to stick together.”
“Hermione wanted to know—”
“He refused to say,” replied Harry, slowly calming down, “but I’m guessing it’s more than combat spells.”
“I didn’t, actually,” said Harry. “I stayed at Grwml— What the—? Grnmpl— Oh for gods’ sake, that stupid Fidelius! I stayed with Remus, at a safe-house of a sort, which I can not name out loud right now because I am not Secret Keeper.”
“Is there a counter-spell?”
at the very least to have them, right?
watch your mouth, Malfoy,” he said, the threat clear in his voice.
Their wands buzzed and they jumped, focusing on the potion again. Draco checked Severus’ instructions twice, before stirring the potion once counter-clockwise.
Harry fell back into the cushions with an exasperated sigh.
Remus nodded. It was delightfully simple when she put it that way. His loyalty was with Harry now.
Blaise snorted lightly and tipped his head in acknowledgement.
“I know how you feel,” sighed Severus, absent-mindedly stirring his potion. “It won’t be easy to pretend to hate him, to treat him as I did before, but it’s a necessity. Nobody can find out that he is my son. Frankly I was already unhappy about telling the
It took a moment before Harry answered, “I’m worried about what it means. My connection to him is bad enough, but at least that could be explained with my scar — even if we don’t know
“Merlin, you nearly gave me a heart attack!” Harry complained.
There was a pause before Remus spoke again. “You don’t want to talk about it, I get it. I’ve told Severus to give you time and he respects that. But you have to eat something eventually, and your Occlumency lessons are still important. Do you think you can at least come down for that?”
“—and the smaller wounds practically stopped bleeding. Harry then tried another healing charm, the same that hadn’t had any effect before, and the cuts closed without any issue. So, we started healing those smaller ones first, because we were able to now, but the bigger ones on your chest were still bleeding quite badly. You woke up at that point, so Harry asked you what curse the Dark Lord used and whether there was a counter-curse.” Narcissa swallowed and cast a hesitant glance at Harry. “I told him then that I might have seen the curse before, and that it might be your own spell. After some prodding you managed to give him the incantation for the counter-curse and Harry healed you up. After that, Remus and I gave you a couple of potions, including Dreamless Sleep, and started to clean all the blood off. Then I brought you to bed and let you sleep, and here we are now.”
—in his mind. For two years he’d built and enjoyed a relationship with James’ best friend who had accepted him like a son. And now, within barely more than a week, he’d lost Sirius, learnt that the man he’d loved as a father—even if only in memory—was
Severus watched him go. Suddenly noticing that he was staring, he shook himself and turned towards the basement. The bottle of firewhisky was retrieved quickly, and he was already on his way back to the drawing room when a familiar voice made him freeze in place on the stairs.
Severus opened his mouth, but his words were too quiet to understand. Harry leaned closer, barely catching the whispered incantation.
trust him?”
Draco glanced at Harry, as if asking for permission. Harry sighed and nodded, better to get it over with. Draco turned back towards Severus with a rather murderous expression.
“Have I missed something?” Severus drawled, looking around the room.
Harry practically shouted.
“Oh, no need to worry, please follow me,” the goblin replied promptly, gesturing for them to follow him into a secluded little booth, where he called for Burgock. “This young gentleman need access to his vault without his key, would you perform the necessary identification and then show them to their vaults? I must take care of Lady Malfoy in the meantime.”
Severus looked up at him, furrowing his brows in confusion.
“That’s not the point, though. The point is, I do understand why you want to go up there, truly I do. You’re worried, I understand that, but please, Draco, think for a second. Do you really think Harry would appreciate you potentially interrupting a private conversation? Do you think he appreciates you being so openly afraid of someone he respects so deeply? Not that I don’t share your concern—as much as I like Remus, lycanthropy is not a thing to be taken lightly. But Harry trusts him and we shouldn’t question that. You can’t force him to leave Remus if he doesn’t want to.”
If only he knew how right he was. There were quite a few serious conversations the two of them would have to have eventually, quite a few apologies to be made and history to be sorted out. But now was not the time for that, so Draco didn’t respond, opting for round twenty five—or something around that, Draco had lost track—of snogging instead.
“Then you have to try again, you have to tell him,” she urged, but Harry pulled back his hand at once.

“Fine, later.”
“—such a house. I thought this was a Black estate,” said Malfoy.
. We haven’t had those lessons downstairs in weeks, another thing he reversed back to how it was before.”
“Yes, I did, just not those in the book. D— My tutor said the book is awfully outdated.”
“You’re on, I say Samhain at the very latest,” said Minerva, straightening in her seat as she composed herself again. “But enough of teenage romance; how are you enjoying your new position?”
“Tracey is probably already holed up in our dorm with some dusty old book, and Daphne—” Pansy hesitated and looked around. “I have no idea where Daphne went, she was with us during the feast.” She frowned for a moment, then shrugged and said, “Oh well, she knows where to find us.”
with that knowledge, despite Remus’ efforts to shut those thoughts down. Severus could be as gay as it got, it made no difference if the man was behaving the way he currently was.
“Put your wand away, Ron, please. I know this is a lot to take in, but let me explain. Just— Sit down and hear me out, alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, Remus,” he said quietly.
The expression was uncomfortably familiar and so convincing it felt like being doused with ice water.
“You mean that by learning Legilimency, I’d be able to access
“Did I tell you to cease practising?” Severus’ voice had risen to a half-shout.
, Draco mused, as their lips moved against each other in slow, languid motions.
your fault that Sirius died. I know it isn’t, Dumbledore knows it isn’t, everyone knows it isn’t. It is not your fault. Can you believe me when I tell you that?”
“How’s the
“What was that all about? I thought you and M—”
Whenever he came across Potter, though, his boredom fell away. While it was slow-going, he could see that Potter’s self-control was wavering.
Only when Ernie Macmillan asked about Felix Felicis did Harry’s interest in the lesson return. The golden potion took six months to brew, which made it one of the few they had not actually practiced at Grimmauld Place. Perhaps Slughorn wasn’t as useless as Severus had implied if he could brew Felix Felicis.
“On the contrary, you see, Potter, I have functional eyes and they show me that something’s wrong with your face. Now if you don’t mind, back off so I don’t have to suffer it anymore.”
“Come on, let’s get you something to eat, it’ll help.” Remus tugged on his arm gently.
He put his ladle down with a grin. His Drought of Living Death was perfect and he knew it; as did Hermione, judging by her put-out expression.
He walked around his desk and unexpectedly sat down in the second chair next to Harry’s, turning it to face him directly. Harry quickly turned his own chair to match.
“Oh,” Draco breathed, eyes wide as Harry moved to straddle him.
“I mean, yeah,” he eventually managed, still captivated by green irises.
Draco stared at him, unsure how to react. Harry breathed deeply a few times, then he continued.
“You did all this for
He felt a wave of anxiety well up inside him, as he snuck into the bathroom to quickly brush his teeth—just for good measure. The more contrary voices inside his head were getting louder now. It probably didn’t mean anything, there had just been so much tension between them.
Draco’s words were so unexpected that Harry loosened his grip on Draco’s hands in his surprise, and Draco promptly took advantage of it, pushing him onto his back, straddling him again and grinding down once, hard. It knocked the breath right out of Harry’s lungs.
Once they arrived back in their room the realisation that
Still laughing, Harry raised his hands in capitulation. He added, “I do need a codename for you, though. For when I’m talking to Ron and Hermione—I can’t very well call you Dad, and if people hear me talk about you using your name there will be too many questions in no time.”
Severus scowled. “The basic mastery of a skill does not qualify you to instruct other students. I suggest you remember your place, Mr Potter.”
“It is, Potter inherited it from his godfather.”
Staring out of his windows into the clear depths of the lake, he went through possible scenarios—until a delightfully simple solution came to him. He picked up his quill.
Best to get used to being alone again.
Draco glanced at the clock. Again. Time was going in slow-motion it seemed. He felt like he was waiting for hours already, but the minutes just stretched into eternity.
But Draco apparently didn’t need words, as he slowly edged closer to the bed, carefully keeping his distance. Remus smiled inwardly at how much courage it must cost Draco to even enter the room, all for Harry. He nudged the bedcover trapped under them with his snout, flicking his eyes to Harry again. Draco understood. With a whispered spell, he conjured another blanket, before cautiously creeping closer until he was able to cover Harry with it. He looked like he was about to hurry away, when Harry let out a soft sigh, snuggling into the blanket and deeper into Remus’ side, as a smile spread on his sleeping face. Draco froze, his face speaking louder than any words ever could.
“I would be delighted,” he said happily, and Severus smothered a groan.
It was Harry who saved them all, living up to his heroic reputation, by casually asking the twins how their business was going, which had Fred—at least Draco thought that was Fred—immediately launching into a detailed account of everything they’d been experimenting with. Draco had to admit that it sounded rather impressive, despite some of their products being decidedly absurd. Apparently they had even acquired a shop space at Diagon Alley and were preparing to open their doors within the week. To his relief, he noticed that other conversations had started up as well, with Bill talking to Remus and Severus—Draco thought he heard something about tricky curses—and Charlie seemingly interrogating the Weaslette about something that had her cheeks flaming and throwing nervous glances at her father, who was quite obviously listening in. Fleur had roped Mrs Weasley into a discussion about a cake, and Draco quickly realised that they were debating a wedding—seemingly Fleur’s own. To a Weasley. Draco shuddered at the thought. Oh well, whatever made her happy.
He hesitated, not knowing how to put it so it wouldn’t sound too shocking. After a few seconds of struggling, he shot a helpless look at Ginny, who gave him a smirk in return.
It didn’t take long until he felt his orgasm build. Harry broke their kiss to suck on his neck instead, making Draco gasp.
“That’s our business,” Romilda retorted curtly.
“You know, Harry, I think from now on we’ll just
Remus laughed. “As I said, I’m not entirely sure. I know that I’m attracted to you, that much is obvious I believe. I’d even dare to say that I like you, but there’s a fine line between friendship and romantic feelings. Sirius has been gone for not even two full months; I’d be lying if I told you that I am completely over losing him—again.” His eyes had turned incredibly sad as he spoke, and Severus felt a wave of affection for him. Remus blinked and seemed to come back to himself, then he looked back at Severus and asked, “What are
“Now he’s gone, because of me.” Harry’s chest felt hollow again. He wanted to throw something.
“Harry?” Draco whispered, as if speaking too loud would set off something terrible.
Harry swallowed and shook his head.
“Now, with the organisational part taken care of, let’s focus on the core purpose of these lessons. In truth, only half of it will truly be educational in the traditional sense — the other half, while it can certainly also be described as educational, is of a more informational nature.”
with her. I’ve moved on, but she will always have a place in my heart.”
A smile spread on Remus’ face, and that hungry glint flickered in his eyes again. Then he seemed to rein himself in again as he said, “I don’t think Harry should know about it, in that case. He might not understand this type of arrangement, and I’m not sure what he’d think if his guardian and his father suddenly started to— Well, you know.”
“I mean has he spoken to you about the…task he’s given me?”
He glanced over at Narcissa and murmured, “Thank you.”
how sexy it is to see you talk to a snake.”
Harry felt a lump form in his throat. For some reason, he wanted to tell Draco everything, but at the same time he wasn’t sure he could. He
“I’ll see you soon,” Draco whispered so quietly Severus barely caught it.
“I was wondering whether I could join your demonstration of the Wolfsbane potion, you mentioned it at breakfast,” Draco said smoothly, flashing Severus his best winning smile.
As the feeling of contentment ebbed away, his brain caught up on what exactly she’d said. “How did that conversation remind you of Harry’s relatives?”
As the half-hour break between second and third period came to an end, Hermione left for Arithmancy, leaving Ron and Harry behind to work on their Defence homework. While it was fairly simple for Harry after spending all summer training, Ron kept up a steady stream of complaints about the complexity of the assignment.
“Right,” Harry said. “I suppose I should explain a couple of things.”
“Dude, what the—”
“‘Alright’ he says,” mocked Harry with an eye-roll. “Those grades are amazing! I
“You’re not hurt?” asked Harry, ignoring Severus’ bewildered look as he walked around him once, checking him over.
“You said the salve is only for non-magical scars. It won’t work on these, don’t waste it,” explained Harry.
In front of the drawing room, he paused. The door was open and the room seemed…empty? Had he seriously missed Potter going upstairs in those two minutes he’d been down in the kitchen?
“Oh no, soon won’t cut it I’m afraid,” Remus objected. “I might have, well, heard them. This morning. It’s possible that we’re already too late, but if we wait any longer we’re guaranteed to be too late.”
Harry suggested one more round, but Remus refused, claiming that Harry had to watch his strength more carefully.
And sure enough, only two days later Potter broke. Draco didn’t even do much. He simply bumped into Potter’s side as he tried to get past Draco down the stairs, but instead of arrogant indifference, this time Potter reacted, shoving Draco back with considerably more force than he’d expected.
“Hm? What? Sorry,” he apologised, realising that she was looking at him expectantly.
Then, finally, Blaise hummed thoughtfully, twirling his glass to make the liquor swap back and forth. “Maybe Theo has a point, it couldn’t hurt to get some extra practice. We are nearing our N.E.W.T.s after all.”
Severus nodded, but his expression was the opposite of hopeful.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. “Yeah, I’d appreciate your help. We can look together.”
“Severus, Severus,” the Dark Lord said, almost mockingly, shaking his head. “Whatever is wrong with you today? You’re usually so…attentive. What is distracting you? Legilimens!”
“I just— Never mind.”
Draco furrowed his brows at that and shook his head.
“I like your hair.”
young gentleman at a Dragon resort. She refused to tell Draco his name, however, and eventually he gave up and let her continue, only listening with one ear, his thoughts drifting back to Harry.
“That’s Cousin Gia,” Blaise laughed. “She sings, too. She kept telling me that she almost joined a travelling group of performers instead of going to work for the MMI.”
, also known as a prism viper,” Severus explained. “Prism vipers have several magical abilities, one of them being rudimentary healing. Their skin is used in a variety of healing potions, some of which require fresh scales. Furthermore, its venom can be used in certain potions as well, although far fewer than the skin. This one is still practically a baby, so it—”
“I should’ve known you’d show up,” Severus drawled, but his tone was belied by the hint of a grin tugging on his lips.
The man just kept piercing him with black glittering eyes, and Harry resigned. “I got distracted a lot. Noises in the house, wind, flimmers in front of my eyes, just sensory stuff. And my thoughts kept drifting off, but I tried to refocus on breathing again when I noticed.” He trailed off, not wanting to go into details about where his mind went.
I did post a few smaller stories, though, if you want to check those out.
Harry immediately sought another kiss, but Draco pulled away, scooting up on the bed until he had his back propped against the leather headboard. He patted the mattress beside him and opened his arms for Harry to crawl into.
We’re nearing the end of Part 1 (Summer), and Part 2 (Hogwarts) will bring some changes with it, mostly in regard to POV frequency, so be warned about that.
“Lady Malfoy, a pleasure to welcome you to our halls again. How may we assist you?”
Protean charm is way beyond that, especially with all those modifications you claim to have added—the ink changing colour, the chiming—hell, even the privacy charm on this is N.E.W.T. level!”
“How dare you try to forcefully breach my privacy?” snapped Severus, looking angry.
“Yes, yes, I just— I was distracted,” Draco answered, blushing slightly.
barely attended any. But you haven’t missed much, or at least nothing encouraging—I’m sure Remus told you all about it.”
“Naturally,” Severus scoffed.
“Harry?” Remus voice was accompanied by a firm knock on the door.
It clicked. Peverell. Slytherin.
“I think I had an unfair advantage,” Harry said quickly, looking abashed. “The spell, it felt similar to some healing forms I’ve tried. So, I tried to shape my magic in the same way and, well, it worked.” He shrugged. “Lots of people could probably do it if they knew how.”
He didn’t have time to dwell on the thought, though, since Potter had closed the door and was now coming up behind him, sneaking an arm around Draco’s waist again and pressing soft kisses to the back of his neck. For the at-least-twelfth time since finding Potter in the kitchen, Draco
“No, you don’t understand,” Severus insisted. “Whoever this is, even though I am loath to admit it, they’re likely to be in Slytherin house. They will share your common room, Draco, perhaps even your dormitory. If your relationship becomes public, you will immediately become the golden ticket to Harry. You’d be a target, whether that be because you’re seen as a traitor or to use you to get to Harry—you’d be a target either way. Even as your Head of House I can not guarantee your safety around the clock.”
“I’d like to see you try,
“So,” she said, folding her hands on the table, “now that we’re talking openly: Would you care to explain yourself?”
Though the boy did look remarkably like Black, now that he gave Potter’s new face a closer look, he mostly saw Lily. Lily’s nose, Lily’s lips. Potter’s hair was even darker now than it had been before, but marginally less messy. His cheekbones were slightly more pronounced, his jaw a little stronger. He looked less boyish, more like a man. He was still recognisable, but barely, as if he’d gone through another round of puberty within a single night. He also looked extremely pale; likely the result of the ordeal he’d just been through.
isn’t venomous yet, or at least not lethally so. Nevertheless, I have prepared several vials of anti-venom, for the unlikely scenario that you might ever need it. From what I’ve heard they’re loyal creatures if treated right, and I thought she might be a useful companion—especially given your ability to actually talk to snakes.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, Sirius did a thorough job with remodelling. Narcissa isn’t half bad at it either, we’ve been going through the rest of the bedrooms on the second floor. Two are already done, so technically we could even house guests.”
“Fuck,” he gasped, his vision going blurry.
After a few beats of silence, Harry noticed how much calmer he felt. He couldn’t help but smile. To be surrounded by supportive people sure was something he could get used to.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” said Pansy, throwing her arms up in exasperation. “Draco, help me!”
” whined Draco.
“No!” Harry cried. “It can’t be him, you’re all insane!”
After Draco was gone, Severus summoned his Patronus once more, sending it to Narcissa with the message to meet him at Spinner’s End—his childhood home. Pocketing his wand, he grabbed some Floo powder, threw it into the fire and spun away.
“You better,” grinned George as they returned to the main room of the shop. “Still seeing your Slytherin?”
“Of course,” replied Remus, before following the Weasleys upstairs.
Remus deflated a little, and Severus couldn’t help but agree with the sentiment. Having Remus back at Hogwarts sounded like a brilliant idea.
“In that case I shall announce the club during tonight’s feast,” said Albus, his usual small smile returning to his lips. “Has Harry decided on a new name for it? Dumbledore’s Army is hardly appropriate.”
“Then we’ll talk to Severus about—”
Ginny bristled, put the round little bottle she’d been holding back onto the shelf and snapped, “None of your business!”
“Ah, I’m sure you will receive them soon,” Albus said smiling.
—house.
“Yes, sir,” Harry repeated. “But, sir— If I am as bad at Legilimency as I am at Occlumency, this could take me all year to learn.”
“Unfortunately, my new residence comes at the price of having an opening into Hogwarts and an assassin for that fool Dumbledore. But perhaps you could be tasked with this. Yes, I think that’s what we shall do.”
“Harry look at me, please! Harry!”
his father, but instead his father was the man they’d hated most, meaning they would’ve hated Harry, too.
—we’re in a classroom,” Draco gasped, even as his hands sank into Harry’s hair. “The door isn’t even locked!”
Draco gave a small chuckle. “You’re welcome,” he replied, and Harry pressed another soft kiss to his lips. For a moment they just looked at each other and Draco was already losing himself again in those green eyes, when an incredulous cry ripped through the air, making them jump apart.
He considered his options—all of them were lies, of course, but which one to choose? He went for the most obvious one, and the one most likely to get Pansy to drop it.

Weasley family, too many mouths that could accidentally let something slip. I promised him to treat his friends more fairly, but ironically the same can’t go for him. At least giving him detention for everything he does will allow me to see him without anyone getting suspicious.”
“So who’s your father then?” Draco cut in, earning himself a stern look from his mother.
Then Severus face softened and he nodded. “Yes, you can.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “As I said, if you prefer to trust the book rather than my tutor—”
“Wow,” Hermione breathed. “I didn’t realise Draco was
“I— If I can do anything for you, all you have to do is ask. I— I’m not sure what you need. Narcissa insisted you needed time to calm down, but looking at you now I don’t see anger. I suppose that should be a good thing, but I’m worried about you, cub. I want to help you, but I don’t know what to do. You don’t have to deal with this all by yourself. You don’t have to deal with anything by yourself ever again.” Remus let out a breath and fiddled with his shirt awkwardly. “I suppose I’ll leave you alone for now. But if you need me, please, come to me.”
“I am bound to the Malfoy family by marriage, Draco is bound to them by blood. The head of the Malfoy family, currently that would be Lucius, wears the family signum ring—it is imbued with blood-magic that can find any member of the family, wherever they are.”
“You have to be careful,” Severus admonished sternly. “Outside of these wards or the Hogwarts wards you are never safe, you can not let your guard down for even a second.”
“Yeah, we will.”
“Our new Potions Professor,” answered Harry, biting back an annoyed groan. “Guess we don’t really have a choice. Come on, Neville.”
“Stay with me, Harry,” Draco ordered, and Harry focused on those silver eyes again. “Breathe with me, alright? In…and out. In…and out.”
Suddenly, a silver wolf bounded into Severus’ quarters, interrupting his pacing. Lupin’s Patronus floated in front of his desk for a moment, before it began to speak.
In Occlumency, he’d learnt to spread his magic around his mind, forming a shield. It was diffuse and broad. But this wasn’t Occlumency. It was the opposite. Occlumency was defensive, passive; but this, this was an attack, it was active. And while Harry knew nothing of being passive, he had a whole lot of experience taking action. He smiled inwardly.
“Are we still going to have DA meetings this year, Harry?” he asked, and Luna stilled immediately, gazing at Harry with those ridiculously large eyes of hers.
“They suit you very well,” Draco’s mother commented approvingly. “How about you try on the next set, while Draco and I look for some more styles and colours you might appreciate?”
Since I completed my outline, I’ve been jumping back and forth between scenes, so my consistent head start is dwindling and I want it back.
He felt uneasy. Did he even want to know?
The voices died down immediately. Keeping his face as neutral as possible, Severus quickly placed the basket on the coffee table in front of Harry, who eyed it curiously. When he shot a questioning glance at him, Severus gestured for him to open it as he sat back down next to Remus. He held his breath as Harry reached out and flipped the basket open. Harry’s eyes widened and Draco sucked in a sharp breath.
Hermione was indeed waiting for them, pacing somewhat agitatedly.
—so his mind provided him with seemingly pure randomness instead. Every noise alerted him, every movement in the air made him twitch in anticipation of
Mrs Malfoy plastered another smile on her face and nodded eagerly. “Thank you so much, aunt Walburga! Now, how can I move your frame?”
at that time. I have no idea who she was friends with or who she’d have slept with.”
Until last night.
“What? Narcissa, you’re
A wave of relief crashed into him and he lifted his head to grin at the others. Their expressions were probably the most comical thing possible given the circumstances. All three of them were gaping at him, frozen. Harry was tempted to ask why, but a sudden groan from Severus brought his attention back to the man on the table and spurred Narcissa and Remus back into action. Draco returned to Harry’s side, looking at him anxiously, as Harry continued to work down Severus’ right arm before moving on to the sides of his torso. The spell was working now for these comparably small cuts, but the bigger wounds were still bleeding. At a look from Harry, Draco, who was the only one among them who didn’t know any healing spells at all, resumed reinforcing the stasis charms on those to give them time to deal with the rest first.
“Of course not,” Harry spat, surprising Severus with how much contempt was apparent in his tone, “giving satisfying answers isn’t your style. You prefer to keep people in the dark, convinced that you know best, that they will play along nicely like puppets on strings because they have no other choice; because you don’t give them one by not telling them anything. I’ve had enough of your secrets, either you start talking
“Yeah, third year.”
“Should we check on Harry?” he eventually asked cautiously, unable to focus on revenge any longer as his worry grew.
“Thanks, mate,” Harry said cheerfully.
is and he might be
“You couldn’t have been sure of that when you arrived here. Why didn’t you call for me instead of showing up
During their
“Okay?” he said slowly. Perhaps it was best to just let the subject go if it irritated Hermione and Ginny so much.
He shook his head indignantly, downed his glass of firewhisky and refilled it promptly. “Ridiculous,” he muttered under his breath.
“I guess I could’ve found out about Severus being my father much earlier, if I’d just forgotten my Gringotts key, because it said his name right there on that scroll. Wait—”
Severus was vaguely aware that he’d sunk to his knees again when the pain subsided for a little while. Through a hazy veil, he heard the Dark Lord dismiss the largest part of his followers, before turning back to him. This wouldn’t end well, he could feel it already.
“No, Potter, Lucius is a Death Eater. Narcissa never showed any interest in joining the Dark Lord. Now that Lucius is gone, she took the opportunity to get away. Dumbledore granted her sanctuary.”
“Do you have so little faith in me? Yes, it works,” he replied, getting a little uncomfortable under her scrutiny.
For now, though, Harry’s mind was occupied entirely by the feeling of those ridiculously soft lips on his, every movement sending jolts of heat down his spine, pooling in his abdomen in a tight ball that he fought to ignore. Draco’s eyes were dark when they finally broke apart, burning with an intensity Harry knew by now but it still made his breath hitch.
Relief washed over Harry, glad that her reaction hadn’t been condescending. Draco stared at his mother, incredulous.
“Yeah, that’s cool. I, uh, I like it,” he says in such an unusually soft tone Draco could melt.
Whaaaaaat, two chapters in one day? Yes, yes indeed, because NaNo is making me write 1666 words a day and I wrote two full chapters last night, meaning I get to update twice as well.
After a short while, however, the amount of people wanting to move on grew, and only a handful of second years split off to the side for more help with Expelliarmus. Harry gave the next spell to learn and made his way over to the little group, when Remus stopped him.
“Nonsense, Draco is right. You deserve your own wardrobe that fits you, and it should be properly stocked. After all, you’re now the Lord Black
“I’ll kill them,” he whispered, as he held Harry close to his chest. “I’ll find them and fucking kill them.”
“Of course, sir, I’ll let him know.”
“Wicked, mate,” Ron breathed.
Harry flinched violently and suddenly he couldn’t breathe, the edges of his vision began to blur and his heart was racing. Shouts were echoing in his ears, way too familiar, like they were etched deeply into his brain, repeating one word over and over. Instinctively, he shied away, trying to evade the strike that was bound to follow. Everything was blurry now and his ears were ringing. The man was still shouting.
Once more, chattering filled the hall, except now it was clear that the predominant sentiment was excitement instead of apprehension. Albus waited patiently for the students to calm down before he went on.
As always I hope you enjoyed it and thanks for reading <3
“I could ask the same of you, but seeing as you’ve deemed the rest of us unworthy of dining with the Chosen One, I suppose the answer is obvious.”
“You can say that again,” Draco quipped back, smothering a smirk.
too.”
a fifteen year old boy whose family so far has neglected to provide proper attire for. I am rectifying that negligence. Consider it a parental gift, or consider it a thank you for sharing your house with us, whichever makes you feel better.”
“I did, but he’s currently preoccupied by a heated discussion with Seamus about football and I didn’t fancy listening to them yell at each other the entire ride. I’ll go by his compartment again later, see if he’s intellectually available again.”
Snape visibly relaxed.
“He was an Auror.”
Harry continued, “That’s probably when we’ll have to split into different groups according to skill-level. Younger, less experienced students will probably continue working on defensive spells and tactics; I won’t deny anyone who wants to try their hand at higher level spells, but I also won’t spend entire sessions on them trying to do magic their body and core simply aren’t ready for.”
Harry took another sip of his butterbeer and let her get over her indignation in her own time. Ron glanced back and forth between them as if he was unsure whether to say anything or not.
“So,” she concluded, “your main worry is Severus.”
“Fine,” Harry replied, picking up his half-eaten sandwich again.
