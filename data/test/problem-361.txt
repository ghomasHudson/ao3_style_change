After work, Draco would come home and observe that Potter had found some other way to improve his home that he hadn’t even realized was a problem until Potter had fixed it up. Always, Potter would have some kind of fruit or snack waiting for him. Draco would insist on sharing the food while sharing their days, and then Draco would help prepare dinner. Otherwise, he felt a bit too much like he had hired the Boy Who Lived to be his live-in maid.
at him. Harry returned the smile, slammed his eyes downward, and then unintentionally repeated the whole cycle again a few minutes later when his eyes naturally drifted upwards again. The worst part was, he couldn’t even think of a good subject for small talk. After a short stint about the weather, Harry found himself in a conversation topic desert, his natural awkwardness amplified ever more by his discomfort at the whole situation. Draco was the loquacious one, the one who could easily grease the wheels of social convention. Needless to say, Harry was not eager to face any other meals without his husband at his side.
when Harry called him by his first name. Closer, like something new, different from their shared antagonisms of the past.
Harry smiled through gritted teeth anyway. She probably didn’t even realize her compliment was backhanded and truly “admired” him for—he mentally checked his notes—having a job.
“Harry, these are incredible. You really have a way of capturing mood and emotion on the page. These…” Draco swallowed, traced the line of his neck in one of the sketches, and did not say aloud,
“Well it wouldn’t be just you. The whole point is to ensure the synchronization system works, so I would be taking a dose as well! If I’ve calculated properly, if the doses are removed from the master batch within two minutes of each other, they will work in tandem with each other. So when dispensing for sales, you have to be sure to decant with at least two minutes between doses.”
Harry laughed uncomfortably, his eyes shifting wildly across the table to try and find a distraction before this thread of conversation could go any further. This wasn’t the first time Narcissa had made that joke, and each time he feared for his safety as the heir to the Sleekeazy Potion formula and husband to the son of, ahem,
As Harry explained his acronym crisis, Draco decanted a teaspoon of the potion into two separate vials and handed one to Harry. They stared at one another in the eye, and then Draco raised his vial and tossed it back, yelling “YOLO!” As Harry stared, he smirked and said, “That stands for ‘You Only Live Once.’”
Eventually, Draco pulled back and guided Harry to the tub, helping him to lower himself into it. Harry then watched his boyfriend grab an item from the mess of hair- and skincare products on his side of the sink and bring it over. He crouched down to show Harry what it was.
Which led to point number two: under no circumstances could Harry wake Draco to protect Harry from his parents’ social niceties. Not only had his husband personally threatened him, but Harry also could not in good conscience rouse Draco from his sorely needed sleep. He had, after all, borne the brunt of the traveling fiasco yesterday. When Harry had held it, the Squirmy Wormy Cataclysmal Clematis would whine and, well, squirm madly. For some reason, it had settled more calmly—though not truly calmed—in Draco’s arms, and so Draco had had to contend with its purring and fussing the entire 18 hours.
Draco approved, and showed it by summoning his own fork and tucking into the plate between them. “Where did you even find Asian pears?” he pondered aloud. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen them before.”
Potter still looked like a deer in the headlights. Draco grabbed his hand and tugged him over to the corner that had apparently become block city. As Teddy began to bash blocks against each other, he leaned towards Potter’s ear, hissing, “Now tell me what is going on. I leave for
“I run a company that acts as a consultant to the Ministry’s Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and specializes in invasive species control. As the wixen world has become increasingly globalized—” Harry held back from his usual explanation that it was solely Magical Britain that was suddenly realizing that a whole world existed outside of its own arse and was unfortunately approaching globalization with an air of colonialism  “—there has been a proportional increase in the unwanted spread of plants and animals native to the Isles to places
Point number three was really the cincher of the whole deal: under no circumstances could Harry deny his hunger any longer. They hadn’t had time to eat at all yesterday, given that it was already taking far too long to transport the fucking mass of vines. Now, Harry was so famished that his stomach had decided to start a constant audible grumble concert. Harry was vaguely certain the growls were to the tune of A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.
Harry’s form, blurred by the frosted glass, shrugged. “There’s only one entrance and exit, and you don’t keep your wand on you in there so you can’t Disapparate on me. It seemed like a good choice. Anyway, tell me what it is so we can go back to normal.”
. “Knew it already,” he said succinctly in that Greg way of his. “Was thinking over dinner. I know someone. He talks more. Could keep up with the little one.”
Gingerly, he got to his feet to examine his surroundings. The gardens at Malfoy Manor had always been spectacular, so much so that it was understood in Pureblood circles to be the best of all Manor gardens. In recent days, though, Longbottom Manor’s gardens had been generating quite a stir. Mother had been going out of her mind trying to visit so she could update her gardens accordingly, but Augusta Longbottom was crafty and vicious and figured her out every time. Still, Draco thought the Malfoy gardens were splendid regardless of how they compared to the Longbottom gardens.
As if in contrast to his thoughts, the dinner plates disappeared and plates with globes of spun sugar encasing suspended tiny treacle tarts manifested. Harry’s was distinctly larger than either of his parents-in-law, which was absolutely tragic because Harry
“No, but—” Draco stopped abruptly, then began pacing. “Hm. Alright, I’ll sign Scorpius up for piano lessons, which
During their rehearsal time, Harry would chat in between numbers. Since Draco often needed to rest his voice, it turned into Harry talking about himself.
“And what, you decided that a three-year old should have free reign of the flat? For god’s sake, Potter, who is the adult here, you or him?”
Three months in, Harry did not corner Draco in the shower. Instead, he initiated a conversation with Draco while the two of them were in the living room after dinner. Draco was similarly shocked about the whole thing anyway, despite not being naked and wet.
Draco learned to move around Harry in the kitchen, learned Harry’s habits and likes. He knew that Harry didn’t care for green peppers but loved courgettes. He knew that Harry habitually left the light on in the bathroom before going to bed and would rush out a minute after closing his door to turn it off. He knew Harry looked fantastic in royal purple but balked at the flashy color, choosing for neutral blues, greens, and greys instead. He knew that Harry often hummed tunelessly when he was distracted. He knew that Harry moved restlessly even when he was sitting still.
Harry stopped short. “Hmmmm, the comedic potential of that last one outweighs pretty much all the other cons of what you just said.” His lips cracked into a huge smile. In spite of the whole ring-down-the-drain situation, the back-and-forth banter had reminded him that it wasn’t the ring that was important, it was Draco and the fact that the love of his life had proposed to him tonight. “Alright, I’m sold.”
Harry sank into the armchair warily, his hair dripping slightly. He grimaced as his wet hair dripped onto his bare neck and arms. Draco cast a mild Drying Charm at him, just strong enough to impart a warm and fuzzy feeling without frizzing up Harry's curls, and got a small smile for his troubles.
He knew a lot of things about Harry, and it was only in reflecting on how many things he knew about him that Draco learned something new about himself: he maybe had a tiny bit of a crush on Harry Potter.
“I’m sorry, Scorpius, but I don’t know any other songs. Mr. Potter and I would have to practice more together.”
Draco did not snoop because he had grown to be the kind of person who didn’t. But Merlin and Circe and several other minor deities, did he want to know what was in that book.
It should be noted that giraffes could technically swim, albeit poorly. The same could be said for the relationship between Draco and Harry’s friends. They simply had not yet found common ground, and not for lack of trying. Still, it was clear that Weasley and Granger and Draco were all trying their best on Harry’s behalf, and at some point that effort would pay off.
—” Harry made a horrendous attempt at mimicking Draco’s accent “—why you’ve been avoiding me for the past week?”
lessons, fearful of perpetuating his father’s cycle of rich kid tutelage. It seemed that Scorpius’s rambunctious nature had been a cry of boredom though, or something relating to it. Now that he had a focus that he enjoyed, Draco found that Scorpius was much calmer and easier to manage. It
“So, Potter. Tell me about your day.” Okay. Okay. He could come back from this. It wasn’t the end of the world. But Merlin on a beach ball, what a lame way to start a conversation! He’d be lucky if Potter didn’t laugh him out of his own house.
Harry huffed out a laugh. “You’re trans, yeah? Like Luna.” He finished the repairs and sat back up in his seat.
Dudley Dursley, boyfriend to Gregory Goyle, sat immobile on the couch as Scorpius fluttered around him, adding more and more ribbons and bows and lacy things that Draco hadn’t even known he possessed. There were smears of paint all over Dursley and the couch and the walls.
In an instant, the wonderfully water-repellent feathers that had been keeping him buoyant disappeared, and human Draco crashed into the pond much the same as Potter had moments earlier. He yelped in dismay
(Years later, after he made friends with Blaise Zabini, Draco realized that there were other reasons to do with Lucius’s displeasure of Mr. Armstrong.)
“Beside the point, really. Children learn quickly.” He glanced at Potter, who appeared to be having an apoplexy. “Oh, I suppose we could hire the piano teacher to be the accompanist if we needed to.”
Harry examined the cylinder of sweet potato uncertainly. Fondant? Wasn’t that some kind of icing? Was there a cake or something under there?
“Well, if you’d said you were ace, I was going to map out what your do’s and don’ts were, what you were comfortable with, stuff like that. If not, I thought we’d probably do, er,
“Daddy!” Scorpius dropped his armful of craft supplies and came crashing into Draco’s knees, wrapping him into a warm hug. Draco felt a little of his dismay at the mess melt away in the face of how adorable and loving his son was. “Yeah, I was good! Really good! Mr. Dursley said so!”
you, isn’t it? Wait, that means you got your Animagus transformation! That’s great! Should’ve known you’d be a goose, though, you prat.” Potter was laughing now, his eyes lit up in that way they did when he was properly smiling. It was so lovely and reminiscent of the feelings that human Draco had for Potter that his transformation suddenly reverted.
The pieces started slamming into place. Draco had figured out he was some flavor of aromantic long ago. It seemed that his specific variety included developing crushes on friends named Harry Potter.
Draco sobered and leaned in closer, which was a feat. “Harry Potter, will you do me the great honor of marrying me?”
“Drop the thing in the water already, Harry!” Draco insisted, grabbing Harry’s hand that wasn’t holding the bath bomb.
“Did you know,” Harry said conversationally, “that you sound a lot more Victorian when you’re nervous? Is that a posh aristocrat thing?”
“Hang on a moment, I think you’re onto something there!” Celine sat up straight and dragged parchment closer to her. “We’d have to modify the base recipe, but maybe we can add other hairs and market it as a party potion that would turn the consumer into a randomly generated mix of features of the donors. Surprise your friends! Surprise yourself!” Her quill flew across the page, calculating the changes that would need to be made. “Here, what do you think?”
Draco moved behind Harry and rubbed Harry’s shoulders. “I don’t believe that. Look, you’re all knotted up here.” His skillful fingers massaged Harry’s shoulders for a while. “Wow, that’s a big knot.”
Harry ran a triple check that all the settings were proper and the locomotive spells were all in order. That took a grand total of two minutes. Harry patted himself on the back for a job well done. He’d earned his paycheck in 0.35% of the time he was scheduled to work!
Due to the setup of the room, Harry sat on the sofa next to Draco with the bowl of popcorn between them. As the film progressed, they would inevitably gravitate towards the food until the bowl was empty, at which point they were close enough that their elbows were touching. Occasionally, Harry would begin nodding off (Draco seriously had
“Yes, darling, you were telling me about how your yeast friends started foaming so you dumped flour on them.”
Harry’s cheeks flamed. “I thought you might enjoy watching a film together, but you’ve been sort of busy recently…”
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, kissing the base of Harry’s neck contentedly and squeezing his arse rhythmically. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to.”
wanted without any of those pesky limitations that Muggles had to suffer through. Turning his head to the window once more, he took a deep breath.
. It was like being at Hogwarts again and having to go to the Great Hall for meals. There was no way Harry could eat quickly and then excuse himself.
“You’re getting ahead of yourself. You don’t even know if it works yet, and you’re thinking about sales?”
. How was he supposed to navigate social cues if the Malfoys Sr. kept subverting them while simultaneously expecting them? His Potter training hadn’t prepared him for this!
Harry accented his enthusiastic desire with a sharp upward thrust. Draco firmly shoved him down by the hips.
Draco sighed heavily. He supposed there were two options here: 1) continue living together and pretend everything was normal or 2) set Harry up with a place of his own somewhere else. His heart squeezed painfully at that second possibility. He didn’t want Harry to leave! Better to suffer in silence than to suffer Harry’s absence.
Potter was next to him, an identical drumset set up. “Good, good, just like that!” Potter enthused, apparently heedless of the nonsensical banging that Scorpius was engaged in. “Now try this out!” He picked up his drumsticks and tapped out a rhythm that sounded like miniature explosions. Draco supposed he could appreciate that there
Draco didn’t stand a chance. The pleasure building within him reached a sudden crest, His fingers squeezed tight on Harry’s and his back arched, and then his cock was pulsing come despite being untouched. Even as Draco’s arse clenched down in ecstasy, he noticed Harry’s hips shaking, his thrusts taking on an erratic rhythm. Draco looked up, and his eyes were half-closed, lip caught between his teeth in an expression Draco knew very well.
Harry resumed licking with fervor. In this new position, he could also use his hands more freely to ramp up Draco’s desire. When Draco felt Harry’s fingers brushing his lower lips more insistently than before, he shifted his hips forward encouragingly. “Not too deep,” he murmured.
“Yes, and it was horrifying. Your mother looked me in the eye and suggested I had slept in late because of the good dicking skills and Very Large and Long seduction tool you inherited from your father, then started hinting unsubtly at grandchildren!”
Harry increased his sucking, and his tongue flicked back and forth rapidly across Draco’s dick. With a strangled cry, Draco’s entire body clenched as he fell over the edge. Wave after wave of pleasure crested through him, and through it all, Harry did not pause, his ministrations amplifying the intensity even further. Draco pressed him close, panting heavily through it. He hoped Harry could feel the fervent love radiating off of Draco right now.
That was what Draco repeated to himself as he quickly showed Potter where relevant items were and the address to pick up Scorpius from day school. And then he was off to his work at the experimental potions lab, and the rest was left to fate.
Harry usually made it about two-thirds of the way through a film before getting sleepy. Draco took to keeping a throw blanket on the back of the couch so that when Harry’s head landed on his shoulder, he could wandlessly flick the blanket to cover Harry. Sometimes he found himself fighting the mysterious urge to wrap his arm around Harry’s back and draw him into a more comfortable,
“Lucius, did you do something new with your hair?” Harry asked dutifully. He made sure to lean forward slightly and widen his eyes to sell the acting. “It looks especially, er, luscious tonight.”
Lucius politely ignored Harry’s anxiety flaring and continued, “That all being said, I’m not quite certain I understand exactly what it is you do. If you could remind me?”
That had been seven hours ago, according to the fumbled Tempus charm Harry cast. In other words, the gaping maw that seemed to have replaced his stomach would have to be addressed without Draco. Harry’s stomach grumbled on cue, whining for attention since he hadn’t fed it anything at all the past day.
Harry looked at Draco incredulously. “Could you repeat that? I could have sworn you’d managed to outdo your usual insane ideas by a hundred miles, but that seems a bit extreme even for you.”
time frame? Are we working against a deadline I don’t know about?” Potter piped up, a bemused expression on his face.
“Oh, you’ve got a good grocery right over there in the village! I found it when I went exploring yesterday.”
“I’m afraid it is.” Draco bowed his head. “I’m… I may have a bit of a… I harbor romantic feelings for you!”
As Potter tucked in, Draco began talking. “As I said, I’ve got a house that’s doing no one any good for eight or more hours every day. You’re welcome to live in it and make it more… lived-in. I will provide a daily stipend for you to make it feel less like I’m keeping you prisoner in my own home.”
Life with Harry as a boyfriend was surprisingly similar to life with Harry as a housemate. The two of them still chatted over sliced fruit, cooked dinner together, watched telly every evening, and went on outings when Draco decided Harry needed new clothes. However, in addition to these, the level of cuddling, snuggling, handholding, and kisses had dramatically increased. Draco found these changes acceptable.
Scorpius loved his piano lessons, which Draco was relieved to see. He’d been afraid of enrolling Scorpius in
“EEK!” Harry screamed. Whether that was a response to the sudden cold in the bathroom when Draco opened the door or to Draco’s presence in the room while he was naked and vulnerable, Draco hoped rather vengefully that he enjoyed the payback.
, the miserable sod whom no one remembered existed, unable to wander away from his post because he was responsible for conducting a train that drove itself and ran on magic.
something. Preferably that viney bastard. Why did we get into the business of Magical Species control again? Did you Imperius me?”
Slowly, sensually, Harry began to strip, all the while staring at the scenery outside and imagining that
Draco, who had been having a very nice fantasy of napping, jolted back to reality. “What? Oh, it’s no trouble, really. That is, and I hope you’ll take no offense at this, I don’t think you’re the right fit for Scorpius’s babysitter. But I’m sure you did your best.” Really, he wasn’t all
Draco found that he felt no remorse for the near-disaster. In fact, a part of him was rather delighted at the thought of wrecking that bookcase. It belonged to his father. Why should his father get to decide the rules of the house? Who said that bookcases had to stand?
The next day off he had, he broached the topic. “Harry,” he said around a mouthful of honeydew. “Have you bought anything for yourself with the money I give you?”
He’d worked hard to overcome the jeering after the war. It had taken introspection and ingratiating himself to more people than he cared to remember, in the hopes that one of them would invest in him and recommend him to others. Worth the effort, in the end, though at the time Draco hadn’t been certain.
Draco felt that he was hyperventilating and, curiously, was fighting the urge to go over and give Potter a large hug and show him the large bedroom he had now in Draco’s house. “I’m sure it was,” he said in a strangled voice. “Do you… you do know you don’t
There was a lull of silence in which Draco mentally berated himself for his failure at conversational arts.
. There was no other word for it. Harry grinned and pushed one of Draco’s legs higher, spreading him impossibly wider and allowing the dildo to slam into his prostate on every thrust. Draco’s cock was leaking profusely, and he reached down to grab it, brainless with pleasure. Harry’s hand caught it and tangled their fingers together.
Draco snorted. “Are you seriously asking me if that was good? Harry, that was the best damn fucking I’ve ever had.” He paused, thinking. “Though I don’t think I could handle this often. That was
On seeing his father start to dance, Scorpius leapt up with a cry and grabbed onto his leg, twirling and jumping. Potter was laughing as well, easily taking over Scorpius’s kick drum duties and following Draco’s improvised lines.
“Yeah.” Harry looked away, clearly embarrassed by his art. “It’s something I got into recently in Ron and Hermione’s flat with no job or anything to do all day. You don’t need much to doodle, and Hermione’s always got bits of paper or parchment lying around. They’re probably not any good…”
An odd choking sound emitted from Draco’s right. With a start, Draco realized that Greg was trying not to
Who said that children were bad for relationships? Draco secretly ordered Teddy an enormous plushie and told Harry he should bring the kid round more often.
“Nothing wrong with being a Hufflepuff,” Harry replied, his lips quirking up. He popped another section of croissant into his mouth. “Okay.”
Draco waved a hand impatiently. “Oh, just your standard Mood Stabiliser potion. Hormones and such, you know, so the side effect isn’t that surprising.”
As expected, a steady stream of children wandered in and out of his cabin. They were mostly first years exploring, though there were the odd few upper years who hadn’t known before that there
Lovegood encouraged him to try out different things and follow the whimsies of his heart. Left with no better option, Harry had taken that advice fully and totally.
Draco waved the fork impatiently. “Potter, do sit down and calm yourself. You’ve done nothing wrong, and in fact you’ve vastly improved many things without my needing to tell you. So. Thank you. Now come and eat this fruit.”
Harry waved a hand impatiently, a gesture Draco recognized as one of his own. “Breaking up is both for friends and lovers. That’s all semantics anyway. I’m telling you I don’t
“—I never knew banshees had such nice bods, either.” Harry waggled his eyebrows meaningfully, but Draco didn’t see for long because he was now walloping Harry with a pillow, which in turn caused Harry to pick up his own pillow and give back as good as he got.
Draco quickly nipped the ribbon off the statue’s neck; the swan surely didn’t deserve such a beautiful accessory. Then, he put his shockingly strong neck muscles to work. He dragged the stone swan all the way to the orchard and left it lying disgracefully on its side in a cluster of trees.
“Now now, Harry, I’ll give you what you want but you have to be good for me, okay?” He sweetened the deal with a few more languid strokes.
the Isles, where they wreak havoc on the local ecosystems. My company is an alternative to the mindless destruction of invasive species. The Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures consults us to remove those species in question and restore them to their native habitats.”
“Sure,” Harry agreed easily. He sliced into his last pancake and brought it to his lips. Draco watched syrup ooze down and drip onto his plate before tearing his eyes away, heart pounding. What was
Harry looked up from where he was casting Reparo on the dishware. The croissants hovered, having been saved from a dirty demise by Harry’s quick reflexes. “I was just kidding, Draco, chill. Did you really believe I’d think that?”
“Sure, why not.” Harry figured, once a Gryffindor, always a Gryffindor, also known as “OAGAAG”. Somehow, it wasn’t catching on among his friends. Something easier to say like “You live one time and that’s it” would work better, but that came out to “YLOTATI”, which wasn’t much shorter or simpler. He definitely needed to think more about this.
Draco tensed up, about to come, and that was when Harry pulled back, resisting Draco’s instinctive attempts to keep him down.
In the kitchen, he found the hero of his home improvements cutting up fruit. He stared for a moment in surprise, long enough that the subject of his attention noticed his presence and looked up.
He swung his feet over the edge of the bed, chugged three glasses of Aguamenti-ed water, then got dressed so he felt a bit more like a human being. As he opened the door, the clinking sounds of tableware wafting up the corridor suddenly imparted three facts onto his brain.
“Oh, er, hi,” Harry Potter, hero of the wizarding world, said. “I thought it might be nice for you to have a snack when you got back from work. I hope you like Asian pears?”
“He forgot the Containment Shields over the Polyjuice when decanting, and his eyelashes are dangerously loose, it seems.”
like they were written by someone trying to let him down gently, but if that were the case, why didn’t Harry want to spend the evenings with Draco?
Something in his heart eased at the thought that it was no longer just him and Scorpius against the world.
There was a moment of comfortable silence as the two stood, basking in the simple joy of holding each other.
Harry laughed easily with his husband, knowing full well that despite the occasional demanding hours, Draco loved the business they had built together as consultants for the Ministry. That being said, it still left them the question of how they would get from Longbottom Manor to the home the two of them had built in Hogsmeade. “We could Floo, maybe?”
Which also made Harry wonder… “How was the ring floating? I thought it was a water-activated Winguardium Leviosa, but if it were, the ring would have floated when it fell in the water.”
things involving your mouth, and how I have to stop because I don’t know if it’s rude to fantasize about a friend. So I might just keep talking about how I’d very much like to take you on a date, if you’d let me.” Those bright green eyes glanced up, gazing directly into Draco’s. “So those are all the things that
Draco made a face even though Pansy couldn’t see him from the other side of the phone. He graciously ignored her comments about his supposedly-unreasonable-but-in-reality-perfectly-valid number of complaints about his flatmate and replied, “Yes, I’m walking up to the door now. Make sure to tell me all about this newest one.”
It turned out that picnicking as a goose was just as pleasurable. Draco pecked at the green apples and, when he had had his fill, amused himself by rolling them into the pond. He had just pushed the eleventh one down the slope when he heard a voice: Potter was here!
“That’s not what that’s about, you heathen!” Draco shot back, and then he laughed nervously. “But no, I know very well you’re not interested in that particular tradition. I was referring to, well, marriage—whoa!” Draco stumbled back as Harry launched himself into Draco’s arms.
Harry took a deep breath and reminded himself he’d been Sorted Gryffindor back in the day. The feelings of courage and bravery that had welled within his eleven-year old self on his Sorting day tiptoed in weakly, crawling out of the box of other notions Harry had discarded after determining that the Hogwarts house system was separatist bullshit. Armed with a loose collection of vague bravado and mostly anxious trepidation, Harry slipped out of Draco’s bedroom and descended to the dining room.
parents now. Even if I don’t agree with everything he says, your dad’s still your dad and your mum’s still your mum. It wouldn’t be fair if we never spent time with them, and you know they’d love to have us there.”
Now it really felt like he was positioned before a huge picture window, a looking glass for horny people to view the object of their desire: Harry’s naked body. At least, that was the fantasy he told himself as he picked up the smallest of the dildos on the table and slicked it up with lube. It was very thin, but Harry found it easier to stretch his hole with these rather than his fingers because of the angle.
It was hardly the harmonious melody that Draco’s parents had hoped for him to create when they signed him up for lessons, but Draco couldn’t remember having this much fun since… well, since he’d had those lessons as a child.
Potter shrugged. “I thought it might be fun to teach him things he could get interested in around his home.”
Not that Harry complained much anymore, ever since he’d accidentally happened on a pastime that actually held his attention throughout the entire duration of the train ride.
“We simply wanted to make sure you were enjoying your meal. We love having you here, Harry dear,” Narcissa stated.
Harry looked at him closely, then backed off with a sigh. “Okay.” He sank into the nearest couch. “I’m just worried, you know? Look, it feels weird to say this out loud, but I consider you a close friend, and I don’t want anything to ruin that.”
, I’ve invented a new potion. One that is meant to ramp up sexual tension between the people who drink it and therefore heighten the pleasure between the two—or more—participants.”
“I think you and I can both agree that I could have done loads better,” Dursley chuckled. “It’s just, ah, growing up I didn’t exactly have the best example of how to be proper ‘round a child, in a discipline kind of way, you know? I was never told off for misbehaving, and then my parents...” he trailed off, biting his lip. “Well, they went the other extreme when it came to my younger cousin that was staying with us. I didn’t want to get anywhere
“My sisters were probably at Andromeda’s hanging out with Tonks,” Harry replied. “Wait, you went to my parents’ house? Because you didn’t think I’d eat with yours?”
while waving colorful streamers and blaring party poppers. The loudness of his mental celebration prevented him from questioning why Dursley might know another magical person besides his boyfriend Greg, and also why Greg hadn’t mentioned this person previously. “Have him come by in the morning tomorrow, same time as you did today, if he’s willing. Tell him money isn’t an issue.”
As he was enjoying a particularly good suck, Draco felt one of Harry’s fingers questing at his arse, the tip slick with lube that he’d wordlessly and wandlessly conjured because Draco’s boyfriend was an overachiever like that. He tilted his hips up obligingly, letting Harry’s finger plunder his hole and begin to stretch it.
He remembered when Harry had stayed after Scorpius was asleep and the two of them had talked late into the night. Draco found himself spilling secrets and deep thoughts he’d never voiced aloud to Harry. When Harry didn’t ridicule him and, in fact, responded with secret thoughts of his own, Draco knew the universe had shifted, because now he lived in a world where Harry Potter was Draco Malfoy’s best friend.
He left the room, hearing tittering murmurs about “young love” as he gently guided the door closed behind him. When he was certain it was shut, he took off sprinting down the hall to Draco’s room. He flung the door open and skidded inside, throwing himself into the sheets to snuggle into his...absent husband?
“Or on the ace spectrum? I realize this is probably a conversation we should have had earlier, but I wasn’t really thinking of it at the time.”
Harry’s lips quirk up. “I might mention how sometimes I just look at you and my heart starts beating faster. I might even start talking about how much I think about your lips. It’s hard not to watch them, when you’re doing vocals. And then I start thinking about
the professional, out of the two of them. His bakery was fairly successful too, so he presumably knew the best of the best techniques.
Understandably, it took Draco a while to recognize that he’d been bamboozled into expanding his social circle. He’d initially dismissed the increase in people around his house as being solely for Scorpius. It wasn’t until the fifth time when the four of them settled in the living room with drinks and dessert after Scorpius was already in bed that Draco realized he had a
friends. “It’s hard for a guy not to feel like he’s being hidden away, you know!” Harry huffed in annoyance.
Draco didn’t know how to react. “I… this is very different from what I imagined you were feeling given how you’ve been acting this past week.”
For instance: should Draco avoid brushing by Harry in the kitchen now? Should he avoid spending time alone in a room with Harry? Maybe Harry would be able to
Draco’s heart was pounding so fast it sounded like one of Harry’s drumrolls. Somehow, he managed to find his voice and say, “That’s a lot of things that might happen. Why don’t I tell you something that
In the warm sunlight streaming through the windows, the sweet taste of pears still lingering on his tongue, and the sounds of laughter in the air, Draco was glad he’d found Potter.
Hot water rained down on Draco, sending steam billowing through the bathroom as a long silence stretched out. Draco didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t confess, could he? There was the power imbalance still, and if he did it now he’d be talking about feelings while wet and naked.
When Draco left in the mornings, Potter would also rise and give him a homemade lunch before he stepped out the door to Apparate in. His bleary eyes made it clear that Draco’s departure time was earlier than he would choose to be up. Draco tried telling him that he didn’t need to put himself through the effort and he could order a sandwich as he normally did, but Potter always waved him off.
hit) a particularly high note, and that was the breaking point. Draco stepped into the room and shouted, “Enough!”
Draco offers Harry a solution that starts with “Felix” and ends with “Felicis” to an ongoing struggle in their sex life. Hey, it’s not like his prostate has a well-lit sign pointing it out! There’s nothing wrong with needing a little help!
Draco stood, shaking imaginary wrinkles from his robes. “It would be a travesty to allow you to continue to wear those, they offend my sensibilities. Hence, I will guide you in selecting style and fit.”
“Yes, yes,” Harry sighed, long accustomed to this particular rant of Draco’s after six years of working with him as the shopkeeper who sold Draco’s potions.
It took no time at all before both of them were naked. The skin on skin contact aroused Draco to no end. No matter that they’d been together for three years or the number of times they’d had sex; Draco still felt his blood heat every time he felt Harry’s body pressed up against him. He showed his appreciation with wandering, greedy hands, squeezing Harry’s arms, his chest, his sides, his arse, his thighs.
It made Draco feel as if his heart were about to squeeze into oblivion. He didn’t need to hear Harry’s reply; he could see the truth of Harry’s feelings right there on the page.
And then Harry walked in from the door to the garden. He blushed brightly, hands whipping behind his back. “Good morning, Draco.”
“Because I, for one, would very much like it if you meant that.” He took a deep breath. “I might tell you about how I think of you every night after I leave. I might tell you that I miss being here, miss the way this place feels more like home than anywhere I’ve stayed except Hogwarts, and that I even miss Scorpius’s tendency to find monsters
He let his fingers continue trailing upward, stroking over his belly and then rubbing roughly over his nipples. Shivers of excitement ran down his body as he resolutely did not touch his cock, envisioning the imaginary crowd refusing him that pleasure and forcing him to focus instead on how good the rest of his body could feel. He swept his hands all over his body, running his arms up and down his arms, his neck, his waist, his thighs. Goosebumps trailed in the wake of his fingers, and his cock leaked a steady drip of precome into his navel.
Goose Draco had no such concerns. Goose Draco now heard Potter rustling around, checking on the rare breeds of magical plants and perceived him as another target of his goosely world domination.
He’d developed a skill set that included playing drumset, common plant identification, the basics of trumpet, crocheting stuffed animals, breakdancing, competitive weightlifting, street style skateboarding, masonry, haberdashery, 90s telly, cobbling, field hockey, and, apparently, babysitting. Draco wasn’t sure what half of those things were, but he could appreciate the sheer number of things that Harry was now half-versed in.
The vibrating on his own dick intensified with the force of his thrusts, as it was meant to do. Draco bit his lip, the pleasure beginning to tip over in his brain. He reached down and grabbed Harry’s erection with a slippery hand, rubbing it erratically as he continued fucking Harry hard and fast.
Harry started playing a jazzy beat, the same one he’d been playing when Draco had walked in that very first day. But now Scorpius was coming in, only playing simple chords but doing them well. And Draco sang, having the time of his life in their private concert. The audience consisted only of Greg and Dudley, and the performance was far from perfect.
Draco nodded, already dreading the thought of drafting a classified in the Daily Prophet, or, heaven forbid, the Quibbler. He shuddered internally. Who knew what kind of applicants he’d attract advertising in the Quibbler? “Thank you anyway—“
Draco laughed, but as the seconds ticked by and Potter didn’t show any signs that he’d been joking, Draco stopped laughing. “What do you mean? You’re the hero of the wizarding world. Aren’t people showering you with adulations?”
It had been four years since Draco had asked him out. Four years of emotional highs and lows and everything in between. Harry was over the moon that he’d found a partner who was so incredibly perfect for him. Their reconnection after the war had started with a spark that kindled into a slow-burning inferno as the two of them built their relationship anew, from former rivals to enemies to friends to lovers.
of Harry’s head landing on Draco’s shoulder made him jerk, waking Harry who scooted back abruptly, face red. Draco immediately mourned the loss of Harry’s warm weight on his shoulder and resolved to react less strongly next time.
The mixed messages were messing mightily with Draco’s mind. Did Harry reciprocate his feelings? Or was he just being considerate and felt awkward about the whole thing? And what about that last thing he’d said before he ran off after Draco’s confession? The notes didn’t
. Why did they just assign things new names so they didn’t have to pretend they were eating what poor people ate?
Opening the door revealed 1) an impossibly messy flat and 2) a blurry projectile that knocked the wind out of him.
But they had made it in the end, depositing the Squirmy Wormy Cataclysmal Clematis into Neville’s eager hands at noon the following day (or was it the same day? Time zones were the worst). Then, Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and declared, “If I have to Apparate or Portkey one more time I will
Scorpius’s significantly calmer behavior aside—though Draco would never downplay the relief he felt at returning home and finding the walls absent of blueberry jam, flour, or lacy ribbons— the change that felt more momentous was the addition of Harry Potter to his daily life.
After dinner, Harry sat with Draco but excused himself from watching telly, saying he wanted to go to bed early. Draco felt a pang at the loss of his company for the evening but readily agreed.
“What?” Draco breathed. His head swivelled up and he finally looked at Harry’s face, which was currently cherry red.
(He conveniently decided to ignore the albino peacocks that used to occupy the grounds. Father had gotten rid of them after one pecked him in the arse anyway.)
Lucius interrupted Harry’s train of thought before his brain could continue waxing poetic about potatoes. “Son, we just want you to know that we never want you or Draco to feel pressured into having children on our behalf.”
Potter’s mouth was hanging open as well, but that changed as his lips quirked up into a smirk. “I don’t think it is,” he commented. “You see,
To say nothing of how he felt when it was just him and Harry! Those flaming bright green eyes, the bird’s nest of midnight strands he called hair, his smooth brown skin and the way it wrapped around his muscles… Draco’s cheeks pinked just remembering how he’d been staring so intently at Harry’s arms as he played drums that he’d missed his entrance.
Harry stood on his arrival, hands clasped together in front of him, face downcast. “I’m sorry about ambushing you again. That was probably out of line.”
love heirs, but since your marriage, we’ve been making an effort to be better than our forebears. Additionally, the fertility treatments I had to go through to bear Draco were—”
“Alright.” Draco did so and heard several rustling sounds before Harry told him it was okay to turn back around.
Scorpius took off running, quickly saw Draco, and changed direction to dash full tilt into Draco’s knees. “Welcome home, Daddy!”
a conductor and wanted to see. Harry greeted them all with a smile and a tip of his hat. He didn’t technically have a uniform and didn’t
“I want to visit,” Harry stated firmly. “Cosmic Concoctions is important to you, and if you don’t have friends to introduce me to, you can introduce me to your workplace.”
Potter snorted in mirth. “Serves you right!” He reached forwards and adjusted the lacy green bow around Draco’s neck to fit him better. Those same hands then drifted down to rest intentionally casually on Draco’s shoulders.
Draco took a deep breath and exhaled slowly before doing as Harry said, which struck Harry as a bit odd. He mentally parsed through his words in case he’d said something that could be construed as a dirty joke, but if Draco was reacting that way to the words “put it in” then he was more sexually frustrated than was possible given how often the two of them fucked.
“If you’re sure,” Draco said casually, though his eyes betrayed his pleased reaction at Harry volunteering to spend time with his family.
Harry took a deep breath and went on. “My whole life, I’ve been lacking in people taking care of me. Before the war, definitely, and since the war, not really. My friends, the Weasleys… it always felt like I was intruding. Not like home. Here?” He gestured broadly across the entire room. “Here feels like home. I feel like you support me, and I am not only perfectly fine that way, I
on Jenkins, not replace him—and I’ll get to refining the recipe and terrifying the twits in the lab into doing their jobs properly.
He searched all around the house and finally discovered his son and Potter outside in the backyard examining leaves on the trees.
The combination of these three key points meant that Harry was going to have to go down and endure a course meal with his in-laws
Harry had been ecstatic at the time, and he still was. It was just that Draco had yet to propose and Harry was driving himself mad trying to figure out how and when the man was going to do it.
Harry grinned rakishly and clasped both of Draco’s hands, pressing them to the mattress. At the same time, he leaned forward, tilting Draco’s hips up so he could pound Draco’s arse more effectively, still hitting his prostate unerringly with every thrust.
“Oh, I know. I don’t mind if it’s my own choice.” Potter finally turned so Draco could see his face. “You’re giving me money and a place to stay and I don’t have a job. I’m happy to do some simple cooking or cleaning or whatever.”
Harry squawked at first, but his protests were token as evidenced by how readily he let Draco steer him over to the sofa.
Harry’s mouth stretched into a wide smile, and then Draco leaned in and made all those things he’d just said come true.
In response, Harry jerked his hips upward. Draco moved back accordingly, laughing. “Now now, sweet thing, use your words. I’ll take such good care of you, but you have to tell me what it is you want.”
“Now Harry, not all of us are gifted with the talent of locating prostates, particularly so when one is using a prosthesis and does not possess a prostate of one’s own,” Draco placated.
"Okay." Draco took a deep breath. "I apologize for making you uncomfortable by disclosing my unfortunate feelings to you. I've started looking into arrangements such that you can keep this house. I'll trouble you to allow me to stay here while I search for a new residence. In the meantime, I can set up arrangements to continue payments—"
“Apology unnecessary, but accepted,” Draco replied briskly. He sank into the sofa and flapped his hand at Harry until he sat in the armchair. “Now, speaking of which, I have to apologize to you.”
The front door swung open, and Draco almost fell over backwards at the level of noise that spilled out. The cacophony was indescribable. Thuds, bumps, bangs, crashes—all of that and more was emitting from Draco’s home.
Harry (as he’d firmly insisted Draco call him, to the point of ignoring him if he said “Potter”) had made a point of being the most exemplary babysitter Draco could imagine. Draco could find no fault with him, and he was therefore forced to keep Harry around—or so he told himself when his brain started rebelling at the idea that he was becoming friends with Harry Potter. Draco found himself looking forward to coming home these days, and not just so he could spend time with his son. No, he specifically looked forward to coming home to enjoy Harry’s company.
“I am going to sleep for the next 92 hours,” Draco announced. His eyes were closed, and Harry marveled anew at the blonde sweep of his eyelashes and the fine bones of his face. His husband was surely the most beautiful man in the entire world. While it was more fun to spend time with his awake husband than an asleep husband, Harry had a special appreciation for how beautiful Draco was in repose.
Draco groaned. “Did you even hear me?” He leaned back in the sofa now, casting his eyes to the ceiling.
He knelt on the tub floor and peered into the drain. It was astonishingly bright inside because the myriad of water-activated Lumos charms had also washed down the drain with the water. That meant it was also immediately clear that there was no ring visible within the short distance of drain before the pipe bent.
Harry sat his bare arse into his conductor’s chair and leaned back, spreading his legs and hooking them over the armrests. The position left his lower half obscenely exposed. There was something about all that sunlight and outdoors rushing past while he was naked that made Harry’s heart race with arousal. He ran his fingers slowly up the sensitive inner part of his thighs, picturing faceless masses peering in to get a closer look at his straining erection and hole.
The words ‘ruin that’ seemed to form a dagger that pierced straight through Draco’s heart. Surely trying to introduce something so awkward as a date would ruin their friendship? “Oh, of course—“ Draco began.
“My day?” Draco stared blankly before it occurred to him: Potter was, quite possibly, also interested in learning more about Draco himself! Bless all the gods! He wouldn’t have to carry the effort himself! “I had quite a normal day. Sorting out orders, reviewing the books, supervising the brewing. The dunderheads who work in my labs needed a reminder, as they do most days, of the necessity for competence in brewing for my shop. I cannot even fathom what they are learning in Hogwarts these days. Today, one of them almost managed to add an ingredient to the brew that would have impregnated everyone in the room with Filoxenic Fern spores!”
, Potter—” Oh, Draco was really annoyed now, if the ‘Potter’ was coming out “—because the potion may or may not
All of his old friends were gone, having fled the country after the war. All, that is, except for one. Draco was loath to ask anything of him, given all he had done to him in their school years, but he was really left with no choice. He couldn’t have just
Just in time, too, because here came Narcissa. She paused at the chair and scrutinized the scene before her. “Darling?” she questioned.
“So you’re saying you’re going to give me a place to live and money every day because you’re… lonely?”
They ended up in the back workroom where Celine handed Draco a thick folder as well as a mug of tea. She didn’t even spare a glance for Harry. Draco knew that she wouldn’t unless Draco brought him up specifically.
Draco hadn’t even known Greg was dating. Now he felt like an arse. Had Greg told him before and he’d forgotten? Had Greg been keeping the boyfriend a secret? Had Greg not felt safe telling him he
Draco inhaled deeply, then exhaled. “Everything is okay. This is not unfixable. It’s a—a minor setback, that’s all. That’s all right. Not everything has to be perfect. In fifty years we’ll look back and remember this as just a funny memory.” He sounded like he was trying—and failing—to convince himself.
Over a truly decadent meal (Draco would definitely be going back to the Elf Eatery, because some of the staff are as talented as high-level chefs) Potter had provided a steady stream of chatter but also lapsed into silence at odd times. It made Draco want to prod, made him want to unravel Potter’s secrets and see his brain spread out like a map. That was probably a weird desire, but Draco was fairly sure there were no Legilimens nearby who would call him out on it.
Oh sweet Merlin’s baggy bellbottom trousers, he had a crush, didn’t he? A crush on Harry Potter, nonetheless!
Draco thought it over. He rather liked this Potter, or he thought he did, and he would certainly appreciate the chance to get to know him better so he could decide if he liked him or not. “A commitment to friends.”
“Excellent. And you—“ here, Draco turned his regal pointing finger onto Potter “—you will add offbeats and fills. Now, from the top. One, two, three, four—!”
feel about the matter, the problem is that you rely on me for your basic living necessities! If, and I mean
Angling his hips up, Draco began thrusting deep. On the third try, he was rewarded by Harry’s exultant cry. He paused, gathering his strength, and then pounded into Harry just there. Harry was writhing underneath him, his hands clutching at Draco’s arms, moaning so loudly Draco was mildly afraid someone would call for the Aurors. His fingers dug deeper into Harry’s hips, holding him in place so Draco could fuck him deeply.
“Okay, maybe not then.” Harry chewed his lip in thought. “How about staying at your parents’ place? It’s not so far from here. We could fly.” To strengthen his argument, Harry pulled their brooms from his pocket and Unshrunk them. They had been planning to fly in the first place, but the Squirmy Wormy Cataclysmal Clematis turned out to have a fear of heights and had uttered a very alarming shriek whenever they lifted it off the ground.
Harry choked on his last mouthful of potato, which was a complete waste because now his last bite was ruined. Three house elves winked into being behind the Malfoys, but he held up his hand as the coughing subsided, then sipped some water. When he felt he could speak without hacking up a lung, he looked up and said, “Thank you for telling me. I’m er, honored by your considerations, Mister—I mean, Father.”
They passed several minutes in silence, simply holding each other and listening to the sounds of the other’s breathing. Then Harry said, “Can I come with you to your work sometime?”
Potter was muttering to himself as he counted the number of petals on each Many-Petaled Pelargonia to ensure that the soil acidity was adequate. It was a meticulous task, since Malfoy Manor had many Many-Petaled Pelargonia. It was therefore no difficulty to creep up slowly behind Potter on webbed feet and, when he was within biting distance of Potter’s arse, let out a loud
Draco turned and surveyed the now-chaotic library. There wasn’t much else for him to accomplish here. He turned his beady eyes to the large picture window that overlooked Mother’s garden. Naturally, oh so naturally, his eyes shifted to the large ornamental globe that lay just to the side of it.
Number one: it was dinnertime, and dinnertime at Malfoy Manor was An Affair. At Potter Place, dinner was a casual thing. You were still expected to show up because family time was family time, but James and Lily had a simple small wooden table near the kitchen at which regular dinners would be held. Sometimes Sundar, the Potter kitchen house elf, would cook, and sometimes Lily would cook, directing James like a sous chef, because she missed the feeling of creating a meal, and sometimes James would cook for as long as it took someone to find and stop him from burning down the kitchen.The banquet dining table in the next room was only for holidays and rarely saw any use (for food, anyway).
The globe went sailing out the window. Draco came tumbling out after it, flapping his wings haphazardly as he attempted to take flight. Unfortunately, it seemed that the secrets of flight were not programmed into Draco’s Animagus instincts. He fell tail over neck all the way down until he made contact with the Cushioning Calpurnias his mother had planted when he was a toddler to protect him. Draco had scoffed at the notion that he might ever topple out the third story windows. Now, he was immeasurably glad for their presence.
Harry had charged in, intent on saving him, and the pigeons had decided that the sandwich in his hand was also fair game and began attacking him as well, and the both of them had had to chuck their belongings and make a run to the nearest alley together. Draco was the one who’d grabbed Harry’s arm and Apparated them both to the Potions lab where he was apprenticing.
“But I do know one bloke who might work out,” Dursley continued. “He’s magic, and I think he can keep up with Scorpius without letting him get away with behaving however he likes. And he’s not busy, either. I’m fairly sure he doesn’t have a job or work or anything. I can er, ring him up?”
When Harry finally could no longer stand it, he let just one finger stroke up the side of his erection, teasing at the glans. He had to let out an involuntary moan at the sensation, his eyes narrowing even as he continued staring at the scenery rushing past him.
Harry moved in with Draco and, once Draco had completed his apprenticeship, followed Draco to work every morning except on the days he had Mind Healing sessions. He’d still had no idea what to do with his life, which was when Draco asked if he’d mind being the storefront that would sell Draco’s potions.
Draco returned home the next evening with a buzzing in his stomach. He’d tried to dismiss it to no avail. What had he gotten himself into? Spending extensive time with Potter was not going to go well, he just knew it.
Harry poked at the delicate cubes of crab arranged atop a bed of circular apple and cucumber slices. Exactly eight leaves of mint and cress and five bright marigold petals were scattered across the top.
“One: it may have escaped your notice but I’m no longer a schoolboy and therefore am subject to change. Two, you haven’t given me any reasons to treat you like I did back then. You’ve changed too, can’t you understand that I have as well?”
The problem was, knowing you liked someone romantically meant that every interaction you had with them from then on was subject to major overthinking.
about, Harry had the word “Yes” on the tip of his tongue so he could get through the public spectacle as fast as possible—
When Draco finally pounced on him, he punished Harry by sitting on top of him and kissing him, long and hot and intense—and then tickling him mercilessly. The ensuing tickle fight launched another round of running around the house chasing each other, though this time when Harry sat triumphantly atop Draco, the fight morphed into a makeout session.
Potter visibly relaxed, and Draco could no longer contain himself. He burst out laughing, which apparently shocked Potter enough that he fell out of his seat.
Whereas the previous disaster had been blueberry jam, today it was flour. Draco hadn’t been certain this much flour existed in all of London, and yet here it was in his neat townhome.
Draco couldn’t help it, he had to look away to say this. “I am. Interested, that is. I’d thought you might be, that is to say, I didn’t want to push you too fast into anything...bodily… I… I…” Draco’s words left him, and all that was left were actions. He stood and crossed over to Harry, grasping his hands and leaning in for a kiss hungrier than what he usually allowed himself to show.
Draco glanced at Potter curiously. “These aren’t herbology lessons; I don’t know how to identify these kinds of plants.”
So that was fine, Harry still had his career to think about. But Ron had decided to help out at Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, and Hermione had left for Australia and decided to move there permanently, which led to Ron
The memory of Harry demonstrating fluid movements only to be followed by Draco and Scorpius attempting to “pop” and “lock” made Draco’s lips rise in an involuntary smile. He couldn’t have imagined this kind of life half a year ago, before Harry’d come into his and Scorpius’s lives. In fact, Draco realized now that somewhere in the months of Harry being a constant presence in his home, Draco had become deeply emotionally entwined with the man.
, causing Harry to moan loudly. The resulting vibrations felt delicious on Draco’s cock, so Draco continued pulling at the strands intermittently and enjoying the blowjob.
“Okay,” Harry said, with lips that were distinctly redder than they had been five minutes ago. “What if one of us Vanishes that portion of pipe while the other Winguardium Leviosas the ring up and out?”
“Huh,” Harry said eloquently. Draco couldn’t believe his heart had made him yearn for this man. “As for the… other thing. I don’t really see why that’s such a big issue that you think I’d have to leave because of it? I mean, sure, if you thought I didn’t like you, but surely you know that I like you enough to respect your feelings?”
Draco accepted one last comforting pat and then stood, moving to the drain. “Alright, you said you didn’t see it in here?” He mimicked Harry from minutes earlier, peering into the drain that was still glowing, albeit much dimmer than before as the residual water dissipated.
“Okay!” Scorpius beamed and turned to Potter. “Mr. Potter, will you come over and practice with Daddy so we can play music together and dance?”
And then he brought out from his room the book that Draco had never seen the contents of, the one he worked away at every evening and snapped shut when Draco bade him good night. Now, Harry was standing by the sofa, opening the book, and shoving it beneath Draco’s nose.
He’d been convinced that the first fancy restaurant Draco took him to after their discussion would be it. All through the multiple courses, Harry had chewed carefully so as to avoid accidentally biting down into hard metal jewelry or worse, choking on it. He was focused so hard on chewing carefully, in fact, that before he knew it he’d eaten almost all the courses and didn’t remember a single one. Instead of a ring in his dessert, though, he’d found a pair of amethyst cufflinks thoughtfully and artfully (and most importantly,
Out of the corner of his eye, behind Lucius and Narcissa, Harry suddenly spotted a house elf coalesce into existence. Zippy, if he wasn’t mistaken, frantically made eye contact with him and mimed bowing multiple times, then raised a hand to his mouth as if eating soup. Harry mimicked him instinctively, sweeping into a medium bow while saying, “It would be my, er, honor to join you for dinner this night.”
“No!” Draco shouted. The sound startled both him and Harry, but Draco didn’t care. He couldn’t let Harry leave, he had to take care of him, if Harry left no one would care for him and Draco could have no one to care for! “No,” he said again, more quietly this time. “Really, you’re not being a bother or a problem at all. It’s me.”
“Harry!” Draco pulled his husband back into his arms. After a moment, he mumbled, “I concede that point.”
It was this tub that Draco made a beeline for. He turned on the faucets to begin filling it and then moved over to Harry’s side. The next several minutes were a pleasant blur as the two of them kissed, tongues leisurely swiping at each other and hands roaming, removing clothing as if they had all the time in the world (which they kind of did because the tub was huge and accordingly took lots of time to fill).
“Ah, sweet potato fondants! The elves must have known you were here. This is a new recipe I had at Estelle Rosier’s dinner party the other day and have been raving about ever since. Do be sure to try it, dear.” Narcissa smiled warmly at him to emphasize how very kind and welcoming she was.
“I know the whole Pureblood traditions thing can be a bit of a touchy subject with you, but I was wondering if...you would want that.”
Draco fucked him through it, his hand maintaining pressure on Harry’s cock even as come spurted out, streaking Harry’s belly and chest. His eyes were affixed to Harry’s expression of contented, fading arousal, etching everything into his memory. The combination of that and the insistent vibrations on his dick sent Draco into his second orgasm.
Predictably, the conversation about Harry’s work ended up shifting to topics concerning Lucius and Narcissa’s life. Harry supposed he couldn’t blame them; most people, let alone rich socialites, simply didn’t think wrangling invasive plants was very exciting. Still, it was disheartening to think that as much as they
Harry froze. Draco took the opportunity to reposition. He straddled Harry’s face, knees on either side of his head, and buried his fingers in Harry’s soft, curly hair. Then, he pulled Harry’s head right where he wanted him to go.
Celine nodded grimly. “All of them. Our Polyjuice stock for the month is now zero, unless our customers want to transform into one soon-to-be-unemployed and
“I’m reasonably certain it works on animals, anyway. Oh don’t look at me like that, of course I didn’t try it until I thought it worked already. Those mice had the time of their little mouse lives.”
“If we start this, you should know that I’m a selfish bastard and I don’t let go easily,” Draco warned.
, not ten years ago, you dolt. I find it hard to believe that a man who networked his way into owning a chain of three successful potion shops has no friends.”
Harry simply smiled and kissed his husband. The two of them mounted their brooms and flew the short distance to Malfoy Manor. As expected, Lucius and Narcissa were overjoyed by the surprise visit as well as understanding of the circumstances that had led to it.
“I’m not actually sure,” Draco responded. “I think the Manor house elves usually did any kind of repair work, and they’re all dispersed now to wherever the fuck Mother and Father ran, so they’re not an option.” He paused. “Do you think the plumber will be attractive?”
Draco leaned in close, his hands never stopping their ministrations. “So beautiful, Harry. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you. I’ll make you feel so good. Do you want me to fuck you, Harry?”
feel bad,” Draco sniped. “Look, there’s no reason to feel bad about this. It’s understandable that you have trouble with it, it’s not like you can see anything down there.”
After catching up on his work, Draco usually read a book or worked out for about an hour. Just before he retired to his room for the night, Draco would cross over to Potter’s armchair and silently hand him a Featherweight sack containing 50 galleons. Potter would always snap his journal shut and then look up and accept the bag with a smile, shrinking and pocketing it.
These thoughts flashed through his bird mind in less than a second, and then Draco was lunging forward, his neck extending powerfully as he gripped the handle on the side of the bookcase. He flapped his wings wildly as he pulled and pulled and
Stepping into the house, Draco hung up his outer robe and removed his shoes. The hardwood floors had been waxed today, he noted absently. Despite the mirror shine, his socked feet didn’t slip at all thanks to the thoughtful Anti-Slip Charms cast at the same time. Vases of greenery and floral arrangements lined the hallways. They were also a recent addition and imparted a sense of spring and rejuvenation to Draco’s work-weary soul.
Speaking of which, Harry checked the time and realized he was in the clear. He stood and announced, “Father, Mother, thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality. If you’ll excuse me, I’m just going to go check on Draco.”
His brazenness startled a true laugh out of Draco. Fifty Galleons was over twice what the average person would earn in one day, and it seemed Potter knew it. Well, it’s not like Draco
“Well. Thanks. Anyway, what I wanted to show you was here.” He flipped to a page and turned the book around.
“I feel like I should reliably be able to find an anatomic structure in your arse that doesn’t move!” Harry yelped.
Draco clapped his hands over his mouth. Or rather, he tried to, but instead he just knocked his bill painfully with one of his huge white wings.
The pattern continued for five days. Draco would discover new flowers and a note every time he opened his lunch, and then at nighttime Harry would run off to be by himself instead of being with Draco.
“Greg, I really appreciate your being here, but I think Scorpius’s energy might be a bit much for you,” Draco said delicately as Greg prepared to leave, tying on his boots in the foyer. “You’re always welcome to come round for a visit, of course, but do you happen to know anyone else who could take over the childcare part?”
It had now been two months since they started dating. Harry had invited his friends over to Draco’s house, Draco had been to Harry’s friends’ flat, and the four of them got along swimmingly.
“No, he already did that one. At least the two are related, so the Wit Sharpening Potion could be salvaged. Come on, you think he would mess up twice in the same way?” Celine coughed. “Not that I would put it past him.”
“What could he have possibly done in the past sixteen hours to escalate him to the firing level already?” Draco asked, amused as well as apprehensive. He sipped at his tea and leaned back against the desk in preparation for what was sure to be a wild tale. Jenkins had been on probation since his first hour as a lab tech. How he’d managed to scrape through the interview and initial brewing test was the current hot mystery at the shop.
He ran his fingers up from the thick hair on Harry’s thighs, tracing it back to the happy trail and skimming his fingers up and up as it widened into Harry’s blanket of chest hair, his palms rubbing over the scars below Harry’s nipples as his thumbs stroked over the nipples themselves. Harry groaned and swept his hands over Draco’s body too, his hot mouth leaving sucking kisses that marked Draco’s skin bright red.
Even the imbeciles in his labs couldn’t bring down Draco’s mood. He’d been tempted to fire them to amplify his cheer even more, but Harry had convinced him not to. Draco suspected that his benevolent motivation actually lay in his enjoyment of the tales of their blunders that Draco told him every day.
Scorpius declared the meal “very scrumptious” and then scampered off to draw a picture, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
She stood and strode to the back, not even sparing a glance to see if Draco followed, which of course he did. Celine Trinh was one scary woman, and anyone who looked down on her for being a Squib would soon find out that she didn’t need to be able to cast spells to put the fear of the Veil in them.
The house was quiet but for Scorpius’s occasional giggles. Draco followed the sound until he came to the living room, where he stopped short.
“Who said you could stop sucking?” Draco demanded, shoving Harry’s face back onto his cock. Harry let himself be driven down without complaint, mouth working eagerly as his finger continued brushing Draco’s prostate maddeningly again and again.
