“I don’t know, Harry.  How much of your self identity came from having your Father’s hair, your Mother’s eyes, Voldemort’s scar?”
“Yes. The therapy that has been treating him to this point is no longer effective.  There is another treatment that we’re exploring, but it won’t cure him.”
“I told you I’d keep you safe,” Draco said, his voice still sounding formal and tight.
“No, Scorpius, it’s not fixed.  The only way that we currently have to fix the problem would be through a bone marrow transplant.  That means, that we would find someone who has blood that would work well with yours.  We would take out a bit of the inside of one of their bones, and we would put that material, called marrow, into you.  This bone marrow would then help teach your blood to start producing all of the right things that your body needs.”
Draco’s stomach churns, and he feels a drop of cold sweat trickle down his temple.  He allows himself, just for a second, to imagine his life, as it is now, with no Potter.  No tousle-haired menace, dropping by with a sweet, or a book he thought Draco might like.  No invitations to go flying.  No more green eyes watching him closely.  No more pub nights, where Harry would oh-so-casually manipulate the people sitting next to Draco so that he could take their place.  No more owls in the middle of the night reminding Draco to ‘drink a glass of water, proper hydration is very important’.  No more
Watching Cass’ face as she spotted Diagon Alley for the first time was one of the most glorious experiences of Draco’s life.  She was quiet as they approached the Leaky Cauldron, her big, bright eyes darting around to take everything in.  As Draco raised his wand to the bricks and the archway opened, her face alit with wonder.  She followed Astoria and Scorpius in a daze looking as though she wanted to see everything all at once.  Draco remembered seeing a small boy in a robes shop, his face wearing the same expression.
“Did it what?  Open the lines of communication?  Of course not.  I left well enough alone.”
She looks at him for a very long time.  Finally, she admits, “No, not all.  About a third.  It’s a direct petition to Mother Magic, and if you fail in your petition, she’ll take the magic anyway, and then refuse to help you.”
During her explanation, Scorpius’ tears had abated some, and he was starting to listen to his sister’s story.  She smiled down at him, and he took her hand.  He sat up and whispered something in her ear.  Cass nodded, and said, “I can understand that.  It’s not me that you need to ask, though.  Are you ready to tell your mum what’s wrong?”
Harry’s smile is luminous.  “And what I learned most of all, Draco, was that I can live a life on my own.  A good life.  But I’d rather live one with you in it.”  His smile falters as he scrutinizes Draco’s expression.  “If you’d have me.”
“I dunno why she ended up at Ron and Hermione’s…Merlin was it only yesterday?  Feels like longer.  She was furious when she found me there.  Screamed at Ron and Hermione, made Rose cry.”
“Yeah,” I agree, taking a sip from my glass.  “Oh, that wine is nice.  I seem to have misplaced a large portion of my memory.”
“Yeah.  He was really angry with me, and you know how Draco reacts with unexpected information.  I swear, I didn’t try to set him up, I’m just trying to be fair to everyone, but it seems like I can’t help but keep fucking it all up.”
He regards me with a strange look on his face.  “You have money,” he replies.
“Am I that different?” I ask.
He remembers his parents, how they watched, sad, but proud as he readied himself to die.  He wonders if they’d be proud now.  For a moment, he thinks about summoning the stone, getting a chance to ask them, but then he thinks of the Mirror of Erised, and he realizes that if he has a chance to bring his parents back, he’ll never want to let them go.  He wonders whether that would be any different than what he’s been doing in the years since the war.
As though expecting punishment, Harry cautiously emerged, his back hunched.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.  “I didn’t know that would happen.”
“Fuck it all,” Draco pronounces soundly.  “I don’t give a toss.  Well, I do, obviously, I’m fucking devastated.  But you know what?  It’s nothing compared to what I’ve gone through the past six weeks.”
The results, were, if anything, more discouraging than they were three days ago.  Harry was five years old, even though he was terribly malnourished, and his body bore traces of some suspicious injuries.  Nothing especially ominous, but a dislocated shoulder, and a large scar on his belly, which the scans helpfully pointed out were from a badly ruptured appendix.  He was in the fourth percentile for height and weight, which was supported by the fact that he was still tiny.  Draco didn’t spend a lot of time with five-year-olds, but even he could see that Harry was smaller than he ought to be.
“Thanks, and please call me Harry.”  He followed a bouncy Violet and a sedate, but genial Mr. Powers into the kitchen, and gratefully accepted a cup of coffee.  He smiled delightedly at the cup as it was presented to him.
“In order to do so, I’d like to cast a spell that will allow me to enter your mind and view your memories,” he continues, looking defensive, as though I’m going to get offended.
Finally, unable to bear the lingering silence, and the vitality slipping away from Harry, Draco said, “Harry, what can I do for you?”
“I think we’ve talked enough,” Draco says.  Harry nods, and stands, and is about to turn towards the door.  Draco feels a grin stretch across his face, and says, “so you’d better hurry up and kiss me, you shameless flirt.”
When Scorpius was dressed in his (blue) robes, Cass gave him a hug.  “That was good, Score.”
“I’m sorry.  Would you like me to take you there?  Do you have a family?”
“Cassiopeia Narcissa Potter, I love you with every single fibre of my being.  I can truly say that each decision I’ve made since I learned that you existed has been made with your welfare in mind.  There is nothing that I wouldn’t sacrifice for you, and no matter what happens in the future, I will love you ceaselessly, for every moment of the rest of my life.”
“Will Grand-Mère be there?”
me, so I sorted myself out, mostly.”
I suspect that old me would be so incensed at how the recent turns of circumstance have affected Draco’s family, that I’d be tirelessly doing…something, to try to fix it.  Instead, I lay on the floor on the other side of Draco.  Scorpius, tucked under his opposite arm, has drifted off to sleep.  “I don’t think I want my memories back,” I say.
“You were,” I assure her.  She’s little, but lanky, all arms and legs, and she clambers up into the bed.  I am, belatedly, exceedingly grateful to my last night’s self, who managed to throw on a pair of jogging pants before I fell asleep.
“Tricky minx.  She’s cast disillusionment wards.”  George grinned, and Draco wondered what it would have been like to have had someone like him for a brother.  He didn’t seem too concerned about the whole situation, but Draco supposed that one took these sort of things in stride when one was friends with Harry.  With a quick wave of his wand, the wards dropped, and a tiny shack, almost identical to the Burrow, but in miniature, appeared before them.
“Mum will kill you if you try that with Rose,” Weasley cautioned, and Granger tsked in annoyance at him.  “Rose is our baby,” Weasley confided.  “I expect she’s close to Harry’s age.”
“Why not?”
Harry nodded approvingly.  “What’s yours?” Cass asked.
Before long, Harry was making wobbly strides around the rink, but was already getting frustrated.  “How long before I can go fast?”
“You should have gotten clothes that fit you,” Scorpius said indignantly.  Harry was about to answer, but Scorpius continued, “Can you come to my party?  It’s Saturday.”
“No.”
“Yes,” Draco said slowly, summoning a thick volume from his bookshelf.  Before long, they were immersed in theory, bouncing ideas excitedly off one another.  It was…it was fun, Draco realized.
“No, I am.  I-“
“Sorry mate, try to keep up.  When you screw up, you get to take shite from your friends until it’s someone else’s turn.”
Scorpius did so, still watching Harry.  His posture had relaxed some, but he was still wary.
“What’s that?” Draco wondered, taking a sip of the excellent coffee he’d bought at the Muggle shop with the unrealistically beautiful mermaid on its sign.
Papa thought about this for a moment, and said, “I don’t see why not.  It’s Sunday, and I know that the family usually all gets together for Sunday dinner.  Would you like me to see if you could go?”
“I could see that.  Well, I’m not sure if it will make you feel better, but maybe something happened that made Harry realize he needed to address some things.  It might be good for him.”
“I’m not sure.”
“No, Dad, it wasn’t like that,” Cass said, her eyes filling for real.
“I want to stay here a bit longer.”
“Yes.  But I’m the one who left them, so it’s my own fault if it happens.”
“Different how?”
The conversation moves on to Pureblood funeral rituals, and so Harry, the attention diverted from him, has a chance to exchange a look with Ron.  Ron’s face is deceptively mild-looking, but his eyes have always been his tell.
He pulled out his wand, and spelled them both still before grabbing a recording orb from his pocket.  “Investigator Harry James Potter,” he said clearly after charming the recorder to begin.  “Called to investigate accidental magic at 2 Squire’s Mount, Hampstead.  Subject identified as Malcolm Sanders.  On scene is also two adults, assumed to be Malcolm’s parents.  Evidence of a recently extinguished unplanned fire, as well as evidence of mistreatment of the subject.  As abuse is suspected, Investigator Potter, utilizing Statute 4.7.3 of the Magical Child Protection Act is prepared to perform legilimency on Mr. and Mrs. Sanders.”
“Yeah.  Cut me loose?”
“Sure,” Ron agreed easily, and Hermione followed Draco down to the lab.
“Could you make the amulet in the shape of a wolf?”
I wink at him.  “I seem to have a lot of free time on my hands, and Gringotts is one of about four places I know how to find.”
“You may stay,” Draco said.  “But it’s important that you don’t touch anything without asking.  Can you do that?”  A nod.  Harry walked over to a corner of the lab, and sat on the floor, watching Draco, who was examining the results of the diagnostics.  “Hermione,” he said, keeping his voice light, “come take a look?”
“Kreacher will be making breakfast, and coffee,” he enthuses.
“Mmhmm,” she said, from the depths of the heavy wool.  “Auntie Min isn’t just here for a visit.  She’s bringing change.”
The house elf popped into the room.  “Yes Master Draco?”
“Maybe this was a mistake,” Harry muttered.  He looked wretched, and Draco felt a burst of sympathy.
“Always the self-sacrificing Gryffindor.”
“‘M fine,” Draco had whispered.  He sat on the couch, carefully, as though he might break, and Harry had felt another stab of concern that Draco was truly ill.  “Need to talk to you.”
“For today, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, and we’ll mostly just watch the situation for the next little while.”
“No t’anks,” he said softly.
“How much do you know about your Mother’s condition?” he asked.
“No, Draco, not tonight.  We don’t need to talk.  Just come to bed.”
It takes Harry less than an hour to speak to Minerva, pack, and Apparate to the gates of Malfoy Manor.  A house elf ushers him into a drawing room.  Draco sits at a wide desk, writing something on a long parchment.  He’s wearing his glasses, something that Harry knows he only does when he’s too tired to perform the vision correction spell.  He looks exhausted.  His face is grey, and his expression empty.  “Draco,” Harry says softly.
“What?  Cass, that one didn’t even make sense!”  Cass had been pestering Harry to make her wand for the better part of a year.  Despite his reply that wizarding children in his family received their wand on their eleventh birthday, the subject was revisited.  Often.
Some time later, when they’d recovered from their reacquaintance and were pleasantly enjoying the afterglow, Draco grabbed some blankets and led Harry out to the patio.  They sat on a deck chair, Harry nestled in Draco’s lap while he petted his hair.
“Can’t!”
“If…um…if I’m
Now, as around the table he was gaped at in horror, Draco struggled to right himself.
“I’m sure I don’t know,” I reply.  “I’m probably the worst person to ask, really.  But I can’t imagine that the person we’ve invested the most trust in should be allowed to continue leading us.  Not after he’s turned a blind eye to the unfair suffering of children in Dark-aligned families.  And the Department of Mysteries needs an overhauling.  We can’t allow that sort of power to go unchecked.”
, his mind chanted.
So resolved, I stand and make my way upstairs.  Draco is in Scorpius’ room, releasing multi-coloured bubbles from his wand.  The baby is entranced, and when one pops around his poking finger, he laughs, huge belly laughs that make Draco laugh too.  Fleetingly, I wonder if my parents did the same for me, and then just as quickly, I dismiss it.  It doesn’t matter if they did.  I could dwell in the past, or I could
“I like it here,” Harry demurred, but he was tense.
“How dare you!” Cass could feel her magic rising up around her.  For a tiny moment, she considered doing what Dad had shown her.  Take a breath, feel it dissipate.  Count your breaths.  Stay in the moment.  Then, she thought about her Dad, all alone and feeling like he wasn’t a good enough Dad, and she welcomed the way the magic completely overwhelmed her.  As the squeezy, awful feeling of disapparation rippled through her body, she unleashed every part of herself to embrace it.
“I need to go with Papa.  It’s important.”
He considered writing a letter to Draco, but was unable to find anything to say.  There
“And without your memory loss, you’d still be with Ginny.  Now you have Draco.”
Harry’s smile was lovely, Draco noticed absently.  It blossomed across his face, leaving behind an enchanting flush.  “I like hearing that,” he admitted.
“I just need to take care of something before we leave,” Draco said.  “Astoria, a moment?”
“We won’t laugh at you, Harry.  We’re both here to help you.”
“That’s why he isn’t a Malfoy?”
“No.  No,” Draco insisted.
He gasped a breath, and when that seemed to work, he tried another.  “Daddy?”  Cass grabbed his hand, looking very young, and very frightened.
“Mmm.” Harry’s declaration is barely acknowledged as his bedmate snuggles in, places freezing cold feet against Harry’s calves, causing him to laugh and wriggle.  Harry nibbles an ear, runs a loving hand over a nipple.  The body beneath his hand stiffens.
Scorpius wasn’t far behind.  His face was red with heat and exertion of dragging his trunk, and he was already pulling his Slytherin robes over his head. “Darlings,” Draco said, as he was immediately squeezed into a tight hug from his daughter, then his son.
“Yes, I can imagine you must be.”
“Dennis?”  Harry asks, his head tilted to the side questioningly.
“He smelled funny.”
“But don’t you want to find someone to spend your life with?”
“You didn’t do anything to make me leave you, Harry.”
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?”
“Hi Draco,” Harry said softly, and his eyes barely flickered to meet Draco’s before they flitted away.
“You’ve got the same look that Harry used to get sometimes,” she said.  “He found it a little overwhelming, despite how much he loved us all, and usually, he and I would go outside and sit in the tree swing.  Would you like to do that with me now?”
, Draco decided.  “I just wonder whether anyone has been parenting her?  You know, she’s so independent, and takes care of herself and all.  Just what have you been doing all this time, if not raising our daughter?”
Narcissa laughed.  “They know that they’ve elves, darling.  And yes, sometimes they do help me, especially when I’m doing something particularly difficult, but I greatly enjoy working with my own hands.  Perhaps you’d like to join me some day, and I can show you how to plant a garden of your own.”  The worshipful gaze that Harry returned was answer enough.
“Does it matter?  Either way, it’s an impossible position for me.  Either I admit that I’m her parent, and the press goes insane about a male pregnancy, and our past relationship, and my family doesn’t get a moment of peace, or I don’t admit it, and Cass thinks I’m ashamed of her.  You’ve set me up, Potter.  I can’t possibly win.”  Harry looked carefully at his eyes.  There wasn’t a trace of the warmth they’d once shown him.  It wasn’t that he’d hoped for anything better.  No, that wasn’t true.  A stupid, innocent part of Harry had hoped that this would have gone better.  He felt a familiar pang of disappointment.  It was just like each birthday, each Christmas, when he’d been growing up.  Hoping that this year, his family might remember him, only to be reminded that he didn’t matter after all.
Sarah’s eyes lit up.  “The carrot one?”  Harry grinned.  She opened it, and took an enormous bite, moaning in delight.  “Are you sure you’re not into women?”
“Were you embarrassed?”
The incongruence of being called ‘Mr. Malfoy’ by someone whose nappies Draco had changed, well, nearly changed, struck him.  “Why don’t you call me Draco,” he invited.  Harry nodded.  Draco plunged on, a little desperately.  “Do you remember that I cast a spell on you a few days ago?”  Another nod.  “I’m going to do the same thing now.”
“You too.  You’ve stayed out of trouble, I see.” He smiles indulgently at me.
“You were mad,” she replied simply.
“Oh, no, actually…” Cass looked at Draco a little desperately.
The memory dissolves into the next one.  A taller Hermione and a still-small Harry chase Ron, who’s dragged by a dog underneath a tree that’s going absolutely mad.  Why would anyone keep a tree like that around children?  Draco and I follow the memory through a filthy tunnel and into a dilapidated house.  We watch a scene unfold with a man who looks nearly feral, a shabby looking fellow in Professor’s robes, a tall, oily-looking man in black, and a rat who turns into a man.  Draco quickly explains who everyone is, but confesses he had no idea that the events had occurred.  The man who Draco identifies as Sirius Black (not looking nearly as hot as in his picture), points his wand at the rat-man, who I learn was responsible for Voldemort finding my parents.  Small Harry stands in front of the wand, pleads mercy on the rat’s behalf, explaining that he wants Sirius to be freed, that his parents wouldn’t have wanted Remus and Sirius to murder him.  His face shines with a passion I can’t really understand, but there’s no denying his sincerity.  Have I felt anything approaching such fervency in all of the times I’ve remembered?  I ignore the small Harry, pleading for the life of his parents’ betrayers, and think.  In the Department of Mysteries?  Did I care enough about protecting Draco’s son?  Of course not, I realize.  I didn’t know the child, and barely knew Draco.  But, I knew my parents even less, and the miasma of emotions on that child’s face, hurt and loss coupled with righteousness and desire to do what was right…I know intrinsically that I’ve not felt anything so complex since awaking in St. Mungo’s.
“Oh yes.  I’ve taken over editorial duties for the Quibbler.  It’s very rewarding.  You’d be shocked how few people know about the dangers of Nargles.”
“Could I see your bedroom?” Harry asked guilelessly.  Draco started a little, wishing with everything in him that an adult Harry was asking the questions for very different reasons, but, since that were about as likely as Draco deciding to breed Hippogriffs, he merely nodded, and gave his mother a bow, before leading Harry from the room.
“Dad?  Daddy?  It wasn’t like you’re thinking,” Cass said, a little panicked.
“How silly of me,” Narcissa said in return, her lips curving into a wider smile.  “May I?”  Draco passed Harry over to her, and, although he uttered a little grunt of complaint, Harry allowed Draco’s Mother to hold him.
“Watch out for Ginevra, will you?  Keep him safe,” Draco said, and both of them ignored the way his voice broke on the last word.  Hermione nodded, and blew him a kiss, and then disappeared in a whoosh of green flames.
That hurt, and Draco had to take a moment to grieve, just a moment, even as something niggled at the back of his mind at the mention of his wand, before he said, “I’m sure you’ve seen what your Dad is like when he decides on something.  The way his eyes are filled with fire.  After all of those years where I’d been desperate for his attention, once I had it…I wasn’t sure what to do with it.  It was intense, and I was still so immature.  But of course, it was inevitable that I would fall in love with him.”
“I’m fine, Potter.”  He can barely get the words past his lips.  All he wants is to be alone in his humiliation.
“No.”
Despite his efforts, Harry’s voice shook a little, as he said, “It wasn’t that you didn’t want us.  You didn’t want
Draco felt a hand on his arm.  It was Cass.  “I’m going to sit next to Scorpius, okay Papa?” Her voice was calm, but loud enough that Scorpius could hear him over his sobs.
“I know.”  He twists on his heel, and disapparates with a pop, leaving me standing in the doorway, unable to contain the enormous grin that’s spread across my face.
“But it would be a hollow promise, and I can’t do that.  The Magical world isn’t perfect, just like the non-magical one.  Violet is a wonderful little girl, who has abilities that few others do, but just like every other person alive, she’ll face challenges, and hardship.  I can’t promise that accepting her magic will inoculate her from all pain and suffering.  Besides,” he said, lightly touching her arm,  “you’re focusing on the wrong thing.  This isn’t about you giving permission for Violet to have magic.  She already does.  This is about you accepting her, just as she is.”
“But he didn’t hate you?  After the three dates?”
“Hi there.  Apparently, I’m to see the Minister,” I say.
I wave my hand impatiently.  “Start at the beginning.  Maybe at the bit where you thought I was becoming a Dark Lord.”
along with his magic, but I'm sure he's got plenty more in this giant house.
“Well, it’s not a date, really, but essentially, those things are true.”
Neither spoke for some time.  Draco sat, his shame and dismay weighing him down, willing to do anything, to give up his magic for a chance at changing the outcome.  He couldn’t look at Harry, and sat inspecting the crooked finger on his left hand.  He’d broken it during a particularly spirited disagreement with a member of an opposing team.  It still ached when it rained.  Draco wished it was raining now.  Any pain would be welcome to distract him from the dull torment in his chest.  He’d fucked things up so spectacularly.
Mill sighs.  “It’s not that.  It just isn’t easy.  Your lot doesn’t really like anyone who was in Slytherin House, and so we don’t really socialize outside work. It’s just too awkward.”
“So I assume we’re quite serious?”
“So what’s your other idea?”
I shake my head.  Draco says, “He was the father of psychoanalysis.   His theory was that the unconscious mind governs behaviour to a greater degree than people suspect.”  Hermione looks surprised, and he says, “I
“Well, I very much hope that’s true.  Even if it doesn’t work out that way, we’re so lucky to meet you.  I assume you’re still in primary school?”
She’d refused to speak to him, and said that if he came through to the Burrow, she’d go somewhere else.  She was going to her Dad, whether anyone helped her or not.  Draco had begged Molly, tears streaming down his face, to let him through, but she’d extended her hand through the flames and patted his hand.  “Draco, dear,” she’d said.  “I know how worried you are, but I’ve raised seven children, not including Harry.  She needs a little space, and she needs to see that her Dad is okay.  Let me get Hermione for you, and you can discuss arrangements.”
Draco gave his daughter a kiss on the top of the head, and said, “Harry, thank you again for this.”
“Yeah.” Harry’s voice was breathy, and his tongue darted out to moisten dry lips.  Maybe Draco wasn’t the other one remembering.  Draco blushed, let his hair fall into his eyes and concentrated on tying his lace.  “It’s tight.”  Merlin, was Harry trying to wind him up?
He casts a look at Pansy, and continues, “But we were very lucky, in comparison.  The Ministry was eager to ensure that there was never another Dark Lord, and so the punishments that had been given to Death Eaters didn’t seem enough.  Soon, they started targeting their children, putting them all on probation, but making it impossible for them to survive.”  I’m starting to feel impatient.  I know all of this.
“Potter, how is it that things like this seem to just happen to you?”  The words are a bit derisive, but he obviously finds it funny, and, I hope, charming?  As I regard him thoughtfully, I conclude, with regret, maybe not the second thing.
“I’m sorry that I did that in front of you.  I think he said something that I took personally.”
“Me?  Why would he want to kill me?  If I was a baby, I didn’t even know any of this Muggle stuff.”
“Harry.  No.”
“Draco,” Hermione said, “you can’t call him ‘Potter’.  He’s just a baby.  It will confuse him.”
“I need a cuddle.”  Her face looked young, unsure, suddenly.  Harry opened his arms, and she climbed into his lap. Harry had never really grown beyond sixth year, and his inadequate nutrition as a child meant that he’d remained thin, despite his best efforts.  Cass was tall for her age, and so she felt all arms and legs as she wriggled to get comfortable.  Harry stroked her curls, and she buried her face into his jumper.
“Oh, come on, Draco, it’s obvious that’s how you see me.  You’ve seen me that way since we met on the train on the way to Hogwarts.  Too uncultured to pick the right friends, too stupid to do anything other than succeed accidentally.  All brawn, no brain, right?  It’s stupid, but it’s one of the reasons I like you.”
“Sit.”  It was awkward, and not the effusive welcome Draco would have liked, but Harry also hadn’t thrust his jumper through the flames at him.  Draco perched uneasily on the sofa, his body tight and stiff.  There was an ocean of throw pillows on the sofa, making it difficult to get comfortable.  Draco wriggled a little, trying to surreptitiously rearrange the ones wedged behind his lower back.  Harry soon returned with two jam jars filled with liquid.  Thank fuck, it wasn’t orange.  Taking a sip, Draco realized that it was Firewhiskey, and the familiar bite made his throat sore.  And his heart sore.
Harry bit his lip for a moment, and then said, “Yes.  I did owe him that, and I made the foolish decision to ignore his due.  It’s indefensible, really, but I was a twenty year old man who had a fairly abnormal childhood.  In hindsight, I realize that the choice I made was quite immature and unfair, but I thought I was doing the right thing at the time.”
“Well, we’ve only been here, in this room.  I wanted to make sure that anyone who had a right to know about Cass didn’t learn about her from the newspaper.  In fact, I’m hoping to meet with a PR rep tonight to manage things.  Is there anything specific you do or don’t want us to say?”
Finite.
“I’m fine, Harry, thanks,” she grumps, and I manage not to roll my eyes.  “Yes, I have a law degree, but I’m still finishing my articling.”
“When I stumbled from the visitor’s lounge, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I wanted to curl up and cry.  I couldn’t return to Harry, not after I’d given up on him to obey my Father.  I returned to the Manor, wrote him a note.  I told myself that Harry had been too good for me anyway, that he deserved better than someone like me.  I reminded myself that family was everything for a Malfoy.  It took me nearly two full days to return to Harry.  I stepped out of the floo, and he was there, looking so beautiful, and so hopeful.”
Draco had never truly atoned for his actions during the war.  Whether under coercion or not, he had taken the Dark Mark, and he had let Death Eaters into the castle the night Dumbledore died.  He’d also been a despicable little shit during school, and had childishly and selfishly baited Harry, over and over again.  Moreover, though, he’d swallowed the teachings of his Father: That muggleborns were filth, that he, as one of the Sacred Twenty-eight was superior to others, that Voldemort’s plans were the only way to right the balance in the Wizarding World.  Harry’s upbringing had been different than his, granted, but he’d always been strong enough to do the right thing, even at the cost of his life, his friends, his soul.  Draco hadn’t sacrificed enough, despite what he’d thought he was doing by leaving Britain.  This was his opportunity to set things right.
This happens sometimes, though, so he simply snuggles in tighter and tries to warm the cold body.  Finally though, a deep voice in the darkness, sounding as though the world has ended.  “My father has set a date.”
“How should I know?  I don’t even know what love feels like.”
“I’m good Astoria.”
Ron grinned.  “Will you have him call you Uncle Malfoy?”
**********************************************
The pissy, hurt part of Harry wants to suggest he go ask Astoria to help him with his loneliness, but he doesn’t.  This isn’t Draco’s fault anymore than it’s his.
Hermione gave him a sharp look.  “What postcard?”
I blink at him for a moment.  “So I have nearly two million Galleons in my vault?”
“We’re fully booked,” he says, his face
“You ruined me for anyone else, and you want to tell me it’s complicated?  Fuck you, Draco.”
Everyone looks at me for a minute, but I don’t bother to explain.  I really hate that guy, though.
“Oh,” I say.  That sounds…terrible, actually.  “Well, I suppose with things as they are, we should both think about what happens next,” I say.
“Because you can’t,” she snaps.  “You’re too emotional, you don’t think things through!”
together.  When her dad was admitted to a live-in program in an outplacement facility of Janus Thickey, (Xenophilius’ war-related trauma being too much for the man to deal with), Harry spent nearly a month sleeping on her couch, so she hadn’t had to sleep in an empty house.  He’d helped her tend to the Dirigible Plums, and painted walls with her, and made her childhood home her own. Luna has changed, since the war.  Where once she was gentle, with a head in the clouds, she’s now much more direct.  She’s harder, with a keen intolerance for bullshit, and Harry finally understands why she sorted Ravenclaw. Happily married to Rolf Scamander, she is heavily pregnant with twins, and falls prey to the tendency of coupled-up friends to try to force Harry to find someone.
“Yeah, I understand,” Harry said.  “I do.  I can tell you that you’re blameless all day, and that’s still not going to stop you from beating yourself up.  Daniel was…”. She went rigid at the name.  His throat closed for a moment, and swallowed hard.  “We’re always going to remember him, yeah?  And we’re going to use that memory to do our best with all the kids we meet going forward.  But you can’t burn yourself out, otherwise, who will be there for the next one?”
!  Since when do we come into the office on the weekends?  You’re going to raise the bar, set unnecessarily high standards,” Harry teased, settling into her guest chair.
“Yeah.  I’m going to tell ‘Mione.”
“I’m fine,” Draco says.  “Busy.”
“Alright,” he says.
“Thanks,” Harry said, placing a kiss on the top of her head.  “Do you think we should go and reassure Severus and Minerva that neither of us is going to expire in misery?”
Miriam continued, “You’re here today for two reasons.  Firstly, Harry thinks that it’s important for you to know what progress he’s made, which is considerable.  He’s worked very hard during his time here, and I know that he’s excited to share that with you.  Secondly, in the course of his treatment, Harry has uncovered a number of themes that he’s been struggling with, and he’s been working hard to name those themes, and identify what barriers they present for him.”
“Okay,” she said uncertainly.  She took hold of the wand, and gave it a tentative wave.  Silver and gold sparks shot from the tip.  Madame Lefebvre clapped her hands.
Draco appeared to think this over.  He knew it was all true, and hadn’t truly considered saying no, despite his protests. He knew exactly what he owed Potter.  “Fine,” he sighed.  “I’ll keep whatever sordid secrets the Chosen One is hiding.”
“Well, it is my school. Do you really think, young man, that after the amount of times you nearly met your demise on school grounds that I wouldn’t have updated the wards to notify me of a late night visitor?”
“You didn’t get it wrong, though.  Draco, do you have any doubt how much I care about Harry’s well-being?”  Draco shook his head.  “And do you think that if I had even the slightest reservations, I’d risk administering this potion?  Harry is fine, even if he is a baby.  There’s no downside to waiting and doing more research, if the situation warranted it.  But it doesn’t.  The reversal potion is perfect.  The ratios are correct.  It’s time to administer the first dose.”
The letter said nothing, and Harry considered a post-script, but what could he say?
“It was,” he replied simply.  After all these years, his guilt and sorrow hadn’t fully abated.  It sat in his belly like a stone.  At times, he could forget about it, but, on days like these, when he was reminded of what he’d done, what he’d lost, it was heavy and foreign.  He’d tried so hard to avoid asking, but, unable to resist, he finally said, “Do you speak to him, ever?”
“Maybe,” Harry said.  “He used to be the sort of person who got mad right away and later, but we’re older now.”
Harry is sure he’s going mad.  He wants to go to Luna, to scream at her for disturbing the peace he’d found after the war.
The last memory is very short.  It’s Ron and Hermione’s house, in one of the bedrooms that I don’t recall.  It’s clearly a nursery, and old Harry is sitting in a rocking chair, holding a much younger Rose Weasley in his arms.  Her eyes are open, and wide, locked with his as he gazes down at her.  His expression is another complex one, but he's clearly very moved at the sight of what has been a long-awaited member of the family.  There’s something fierce in the way that old Harry regards her, as though the merest hint of a danger would prompt him to slay monsters on her behalf.
“Dunno, I walked into a wicked jinx the moment I flooed through,” Draco whispered back.
“Oh dear,” I say lamely, but if nothing else, my non-answer helps her to remember that I don’t have the backstory.  So she supplies it:  Pansy Parkinson was a Slytherin, like Mill, but unlike her, hadn’t belonged to a neutral family.  Her parents were convicted Death Eaters, and after the war, Pansy, as well as a number of others, had been vilified by society for their actions during the war, which were deemed ‘bad, but not Azkaban bad’.  Finding a job had been difficult, and they’d all been placed on indefinite probation, which required them to check in with a probation officer monthly.  It had been especially difficult for Pansy, who had ‘shouted out something unfortunate’ during the final battle. I’m desperately curious to know what sort of thing would be off limits to yell out during a war, but Mill moves on before I can ask.
“Good game, Malfoy,” The goalie yelled after him as he and Harry left.  Draco raised an arm in acknowledgement, but didn’t turn around.
“It’s not,” Harry added.  “When I was nearly your age, I accidentally apparated to the top of the school roof.  It caused all sorts of trouble.”
“If I don’t, who else will?”
“But Ca-ass,”  They looked at one another challengingly, both grinning.  The moment held, before she impatiently flicked her head, tossed the curl back to join the others.  Harry thought gleefully of the wand that was sitting in his workshop, locked carefully in a cabinet.  In truth, he’d made Cass’ wand the first time she performed magic, and it had been waiting for her ever since.  Harry was planning to give it to her on her tenth birthday in October.  He had never been more excited to present a wand to a young witch.  As they sat, Harry’s mind moved on to homework, and packing lunch, and the finicky length of Alder that was sitting on his workbench, confounding him.
“Stop talking so loud,” she whispers back, summoning her beaded handbag, which is looking a little threadbare these days.  “Accio hangover potions,” she whispers into its depths, and the bottles clank cheerfully  as they zoom into her hand.
“I don’t!” Harry said, a little stung.
“That’s a good question, Scorpius, and one that I’m here to help you work out.  I don’t have the right answer, not right this minute, but I promise that I’ll help you sort things out.  For now, the important thing is to make sure that you get better.”
It’s so much worse that it was Luna who cut him open and exposed him for all to see.  Kind, intuitive Luna, who had to have known that she would hurt him.  He knows, that in the light of day, he’ll be able to see that her intentions were good, that it was an act of love, an attempt to shake him out of whatever pattern she thinks he needs to break.  He knows that one day he will admit that a gentler attempt would have been too easy for him to ignore.  But tonight, when he sits alone, his arse growing colder on the stone floor, he’s too heartbroken to focus on anything other than how much he wishes for his parents.
Draco felt his stomach bottom out, and knew that he had paled.  “I wasn’t aware of that, Aunt.  It seems that Harry doesn’t seem to be aware of it either.”
“What’s roofies?”
“I’m afraid,” he admitted.  “I hurt them when I left.  I didn’t say goodbye, just ran away.  I’m afraid that they won’t forgive me.”
“What are you doing here?”
“You won’t.” Pansy’s voice was hard.  “You’ll stay and you’ll drink your fucking gin, and Ronald will have some fucking gin too, and we’ll have a good time, because this is Liquor fucking Potluck, and it only has one rule.”
“You don’t listen,” Scorpius wailed.
, you know?  Like he’d tell me about you and him in a tent during the war, fighting over which one of you had to eat tinned sardines, but he’d never say why you were in a tent in the first place, and whether he was scared, or anything.”
“No, that’s fine, cheri.  I have some things to take care of.  I’ll give you my email address later, and you can share it with your Dad.  He’ll email me directly if he needs anything.”  Cass struggled to remember the word for how Papa was being.  Evasive.  Any doubt she’d had that she was overreacting disappeared.  Something was wrong.
Cass played unapologetically dirty in her quest to capture the snitch.  She took advantage of her small frame to duck in and out of her fathers, often forcing them to pull up suddenly to avoid crashing into her.  At one point, Draco’s heart nearly stopped as she overbalanced.  He sped in her direction, only to watch as she righted herself, ducked nimbly around him with a wink, and snatched the snitch that was hovering behind his head.
“I only say that when you refuse to use a handkerchief,” Draco protested.
At the international floo, he entertained a fantasy of Harry running in before he left, making a desperate declaration, and begging Draco to stay.  It didn’t happen, and by nightfall, he was in a hotel on King Street, watching the traffic zoom by.
“I may have embellished,” I say, and George grins at me.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then let’s arrange it so that you can.”
“That’s a hard question to answer, Harry,” Draco said honestly.  “It’s confusing, because you, right now, in this time, are actually twenty-two years old, even if your body and your mind are currently just seven.  Within a couple of weeks, you’ll be back to being twenty-two, and in the time between now and then, I can promise you that you will be completely safe.”
“No, you git, I’m serious.  What if there was something going on at the Ministry that someone was trying to cover up?  And they blew away my memories to keep me from going public?”
“Oh.  I don’t think I knew that.  Or if I did, I’d forgotten.”
“I have,” Draco says simply.  “I would give anything to have him come back safely.”
Harry had watched the exchange with curious, wary eyes, and when Kreacher had disappeared back to Grimmauld place, Harry examined Draco from behind a slice of toast that he was nibbling.  “You clean a lot,” he remarked.
Harry awkwardly raises a hand in a lame sort of wave.  “Hi,” he says, unable to meet anyone’s eyes.  “I know that you all have a lot you probably want to say to me, and I have some unsaid stuff as well, but this isn’t the time.  We’re here for Draco, and no matter what we’re feeling about the past few months, it can wait.  Okay?”  He hates the way his voice wavers, hates the way he feels as though he might fall apart.  His emotions are far too close to the surface right now, and he knows that if someone pushes him, he’ll flee again, and it will likely be the last time he sees them.
“Hi,” I say.
Dashing upstairs to the shower, Draco completed the speediest, and most thorough cleansing of his life.  Hoping against hope, he donned his lucky boxers, hoping that the presumption didn’t jinx him.  He added the only pair of jeans that fit him properly, and a touchably soft dove-grey kangaroo hoody.  Standing in front of the mirror, patting his hair in place, Draco was aware of a thrumming plea resounding through his chest.  Oh please, oh please don’t let this be awful.  Please don’t break my heart any more than it’s already been broken, Harry.  Please want me again. Recognizing that any further delay would result in his chickening out, he made his way to the floo and fire-called Harry.
“It’s fine,” Harry sighs.  “I know that they don’t mean to make me feel that way, and it’s not their fault I do.”
Miriam was watching Harry closely.  “Harry?”
Besides, I’m nowhere near ready to talk to Hermione.  Despite the fact that I’ve tried not to consider it at all, my thoughts have returned to her periodically.  I recognize that her intentions were good, and her actions were stupid, and isn’t that basically the story of my own life?  But.  She made a decision, one that affected my life, without telling me.  It’s possible that someday, I might forgive her, and maybe someday after that, I might be friendly with her.  But someday is a long way away, and I have no intention of rushing it.
“Don’t say that.  You’re my family.”
“Oh, baby,” Harry burst into relieved tears.  “You’re awake.  Oh thank Merlin.  I’m so happy to hear your voice again.”
Harry rolled his eyes, and said, “Auntie Min is coming next week.”
“Draco.”  His Mother’s voice was weaker than it used to be.
Violet’s face fell, and Harry quickly reminded her he’d be back to visit soon, and that there was a support and social group that the Powers family could join to meet other families who were new to magic.  Reluctantly, Violet disappeared up the stairs to get ready for her lesson.  “Mr. Powers,” Harry said quietly.
“Draco, I’m not with Ginny anymore.  I’m gay.  Of course you wouldn’t have known that, and I can see how this would have seemed like some sort of elaborate setup, but it’s not.  I can’t tell you why I was so closeted before, but…I have no interest in hiding who I am.  Not anymore.  I just want a nice life.”
Harry’s heart stutters for a moment, but he recovers quickly, and says, “I’m very sorry to hear that, sir.  My condolences.  I know that you knew each other.”
“Harry seems good,” Hermione said with a smile.  “I think he’s enjoying his second childhood.”
“We broke up,” I say, trying to keep my voice neutral, and downplay things.
By eight that night, Harry had barely spoken a word, and hadn’t left Cass’ beside, not even for a second.  Draco wondered that he hadn’t wet the bed, but he understood.  Scorpius had been disappointed that his sister hadn’t awoken, and was petulant and cranky before he finally dropped off to sleep.  Astoria kissed them all soundly, and said she’d return in the morning.
I can tell the look on my face is pained.  “I…No…I’m not, not exactly.  I mean, it doesn’t sound like something I’d love.  Everything that my friends are telling me about myself, I think I might be sort of terrible at it.”
“Ginny?  Marlin, Draco, are you thick?  You know I’m gay.  Why in the name of Circe’s saggy left tit would I end up with Ginny?”
“What’s it like, having a tutor?  I went to a normal Muggle school at home.”
“I’m sorry.  I’m trespassing, I know I shouldn’t be here.”
“He’s a symbol of the Light.  With his endorsement, we would gain public support of any initiative that was required.”
“Harry, what’s wrong?  You’re all sweaty, and you look like you’ve just gotten terrible news.”
“No, no!”  Scorpius let out an ear-splitting shriek that had Astoria and Draco both cringing.
“Your day will come soon,” Draco said.  His eyes met Harry’s, and he scanned anxiously to see what conclusions he could draw of Harry’s emotional state.
“Why does this matter so much?”
Unexpectedly, she grins.  “Well, Draco Malfoy gave you a weird feeling every single year at Hogwarts, and look where you are now.”
“So was I.”
“If you want someone to listen,” Hermione offered.  She’d conjured some bright yellow birds, and they were flying just out of Harry’s reach.  He was laughing, and trying to catch one.  As Draco looked on, he stared at his feet for a moment, then looked back at the birds.  He bounced on his heels, but, when that didn’t have the desired effect, his brow wrinkled, and he levitated off the ground a few inches, just enough to snatch one of the birds out of the air.
“You didn’t know.”
Harry was laughing.  “Sorry, Draco, I don’t know where they put the brakes on these.”  His face was so close to Draco’s and Draco couldn’t stop staring into those laughing green eyes.  Again, Draco realized how stupid he’d been to leave Harry.  He’d regret it forever.  Harry’s laughter abruptly died as his gaze intensified.  Draco could see that Harry was staring at his lips.  In a different life, one where Draco hadn’t been so stupid, they’d be kissing right now, and laughing, and it would be something that Draco would remember. Except somehow Harry hadn’t gotten the message, and he was drawing closer.  Draco’s breath caught and for a moment he thought he’d die if Harry kissed him.  Then he thought he’d die if Harry didn’t.  Either way, he was completely fucked.  The touch of Harry’s lips to Draco’s was delicate and sweet.  Draco was terrified to move too quickly, lest he scare Harry away.
“I am.”  It had never come up before in their sessions, and, before Hermione, he’d never told anyone. His Father would be horrified.  But, his Father was locked in Azkaban.  Lucius had made so many terrible choices, and had put Draco and his Mother in danger.
“Ginger, Mister Harry Potter, sir.”
Harry was just as small as he’d been four years ago.  Draco easily carried him, bridal-style up the stairs and paused.  He didn’t know where his room was.  Everyone who lived here was, presumably, passed out or sicking up into a plant.  Well, Draco thought, there was a perfectly good couch in the sitting room.  He laid Harry out on the sofa and stopped to consider his next move. He could leave him here, of course, cover him with a blanket and get home and forget that this terrible night had ever happened.
And I’m surprised at how nice it is.  Ron’s gotten over being upset about Ginny, and about Malfoy, and he doesn’t even say ‘I told you so’.  He seems steadfastly in my corner, and, when it’s him and I on our own, I understand why he’s my best friend.  As we say goodbye, Ron wraps a big, bearlike arm around me.  “Don’t worry about Malfoy,” he says.  “If he’s too stupid to see what a top bloke you are, it’s his loss.”
Stir craziness sets in after a few hours.  I debate calling Kreacher back, but he’s not the best conversationalist, and a quick poke around confirms that I haven’t any alcohol in my flat.  I need a drink, and I need to be distracted from the unpleasantness.  I shower and dress, and find myself at the apparation point in Diagon before an hour has passed.  The Leaky Cauldron is right there, and I can’t be bothered to try to find a different pub.  This one has drink, I’m certain, and that will do for now.
Harry doesn’t answer.  He stands, hands stuffed into the pockets of his too-large jeans.  Draco registers that he’s back to wearing the worn-out, enormous clothes that he used to wear, before Pansy took hold of him, and convinced him that he was too rich, and too pretty to wear rags anymore.  His thick sweater looks hand-knit, and a little shabby, as though he’s worn it many times.  A Weasley sweater.  Harry once told him that the sweaters were the first thing he’d ever worn that made him feel good about himself.  Loved.  Draco had made a snide comment, but he’d remembered it, just, he can finally admit, like he’s listened to and remembered every other thing Harry’s told him.
It was nearly Christmas time when Lara looked up at him expectantly and said, “Well then, Draco, I wanted to discuss something with you.”
“Is it true that you can talk to snakes?”
“I don’t have any feelings.  Except anger, I suppose.”
The next few years are a halcyon blur of weddings, and babies, helping people move into new houses, and more parties than Harry can count.  The group gets together at least once a month and it’s a more wholesome affair these days, lunch, not dinner, with children running through the garden of whomever is hosting, and the inevitable Quidditch match that follows is far less bloodthirsty than it was.  Harry has taken over from Madame Hooch as Flying Instructor at Hogwarts, and so he’s mostly exempted from hosting, so long as he convinces the Hogwarts elves to supply him with some sort of dessert.  Harry loves teaching flying and refereeing Quidditch, and he loves his friends, and he’s now Godfather to five separate children, whom he spoil rotten.  It’s a much fuller life than he ever dreamed of, back when he was a small boy in a small cupboard.  He’s content.
“Kreacher?” Draco called blearily into the ether.
I can’t help but spend a delightful moment considering, in lurid detail, what other weaknesses he has, but I pinch myself on the leg, and drag my eyes away from his lips.  “Do you want to order the wine?  In fact, would you mind ordering for me?  I haven’t a clue what I’d like.”
That night, whether it’s in poor taste or not, they go to a Muggle dance club, and under the flashing lights, with the bass thumping deep in their chests, they jump and writhe and Harry watches as the lights turn Draco’s white-blonde hair pink and blue and he thinks that might be alright.
“So when did we become friends?” Harry asked bluntly.  Draco flinched.
Hoping that I’ll finally get some movement on the wanker that removed my memories, I get ready for bed and, as I lay in bed, waiting for sleep to claim me, I only think of Draco a little bit.
“Will you be able to do your job?”
“‘Mione!”  Harry launched himself, as best he could, into her arms.  She held him tight, and then gripped him by the arms and thrust him away from herself.
“We don’t need your pity, Potter,” Draco said.  Harry looked up.  Draco’s face was in the same mocking expression that he used to carry back in school, but Harry was older now, and had seen more faces and more expressions.  Draco was feeling vulnerable, and scared for his son.
“I’m afraid so,” Draco said.  They shared an uneasy look, and the awkward silence extended a bit, before Draco said, “If you feel like you’d like to, I don’t know, talk, or get drunk or something…I know your best mate isn’t really available for that right now.”
“Potter, you’re thinking too loudly.”
“Vi, leave Harry be for a second.  I’ve brought your notebooks.  Maybe you can make a list of useful things for Harry.”
“We?  Where are you living these days?”
“I see.”
“Yes.”  The hawk is still soaring in the sky, and we watch it in silence for a while.  “Did you know, Mister Potter, that Draco’s favourite story, as a child, was the story of the Enchanted Ring?  Do you know that one?”
“Sorry, but yes, it’s probably better.”
“Now why would I want to do that, Potter?”
Draco holds out his hands, palms up, as if to say, ‘what did you expect?’.  Blaise continues, “You know, we all thought that you were playing some sort of long, drawn-out game.  Otherwise, why would you keep him on the hook for so long?”
end game?  You haven’t told Ron about this, so what will you do if you find out you’re right?”
“You did?” Harry asked, cursing how vulnerable his voice sounded.
“Am not,” Scorpius wept.  Enormous tears were rolling down his plump little cheeks, and Draco knelt beside him.
to him, Draco felt as if he were coming apart at the seams.  It was going to be so much harder when Harry was big again, and remembered why he hated Draco.  But maybe it was a kindness, he thought, to let a lonely boy believe that he had a best friend who was taking care of him.  Draco wasn’t sure which one of them he was referring to.
“No, darling, I have my own flat,” Astoria said.  “I thought I’d bring Scorpius with me, give the two of you some time on your own.”
“But Harry, I don’t think that it’s safe to go away on your own.”
“Fix him?  I didn’t do this,” Draco protested.
“Can you ask her if she’s heard from my Dad?”
Kingsley.
“It’s not bad,” he admits.  “Subtle enough, but not allegations that the Ministry can avoid.  Especially…” he trails off and I look more closely at him.
“Well, yes, but for different reasons.  He’s going to be awfully upset with me when he learns that I didn’t tell him about you.  He deserves better than to find out by reading tomorrow’s Daily Prophet.”
“Oh Merlin.  I promised Cass that I’d take her places, show her things.  I guess that will have a wait a bit.”
“Oh?”  Draco was only half-listening, the conversation with Andromeda replaying itself over and over.
As they come down from their orgasms, Harry weeps into Draco’s shoulder.  Draco pets Harry’s head, and wonders bleakly, of all that he’s done, if this is the worst atrocity he’s ever committed against another human being.
“I’m not sure.  Draco left as soon as he’d read the letter.  I don’t know what he thinks.”
Cass thought for a moment.  “Four,” she said.
Harry seemed to have become more aware of the conversation.  “Oh no,” he said.  “Molly’s going to hate me.”
Since then, any time that things had gotten tough, he’d find his way to Luna’s and they’d listen to Nina Simone.  He put the record on now, thanking Merlin yet again that Luna had agreed to go through the training to become a foster parent, and that her home was open to children who needed her boundless kindness.
She seems pretty certain, and it did seem inconsistent with everything I know about her so far, but there’s still a small twinge of instinct that pinches my gut.  “I suppose you’re right,” I finally say, and Luna beams at me, glad to have settled things.  If they’re not totally settled, well, I suppose that’s my fault.
During all of this, Draco puts one foot in front of the other.  He works, he awaits the full moon, he works more.  He allows himself to be dragged out to pub night, and only Hermione’s face shows the same dread and fear that his does.  He thinks about Harry.  He misses Harry.  He allows himself to acknowledge that he’s deeply, irrevocably, in hands-sweating, mouth-drying, foolish love for Harry Potter.  He bargains with the Gods, begs them, that, if they just return Harry to him, he’ll never let the silly bastard doubt for a second how loved he is.  He panics, the entire day before the full moon, and his heart only properly beats when the owl arrives.
“The hyper-vigilance, the obsession.  Darling, you have to let it go.  It wasn’t your fault.”
“Missed you,” Harry says sleepily, wrapping around his bed partner like a limpet, burying his nose into that beloved neck.
And Lara seemed to decide to poke that particular Hippogriff later, because she moved the conversation smoothly along to Draco’s compulsions.  Draco was surprised to realize that he really hadn’t been indulging them much over the past week, but he figured that potion-making and all the arithmancy, and taking care of Harry had used up a lot of his normal compulsion time.
“I get that.  I’m sorry I brought it up.”
“I know,” Harry says.
Harry fucks him slow this time, his cock plunging in, inch by excruciating inch.  His eyes never leave Draco’s and Harry thinks he may lose himself inside the sea-storm depths of Draco’s gaze.  He makes love to Draco with everything he has, and when he spends himself inside him, leaves behind traces of his heart.  His orgasm triggers tears, which Harry quickly swipes away so Draco doesn’t see.
“That’s the part that I can’t seem to cope with.  I’m losing my lover and my best friend all at the same time.  I’m so lonely.”
Scorpius was the first to wake up, rubbing his eyes with little fists, and then immediately starting to cry.  “Daddy,” he wailed.
He wasn’t sure how long he sat there.  Minerva came in at one point, asking if he’d like tea, or something to eat, but he shook his head.  She stood helplessly for a moment, as though trying to think of what to say to comfort him, but evidently came up empty, and left him alone with his thoughts.
“No!” Draco doesn’t mean to shout, but he’s desperate, frantic.  “You can’t do this.  You can’t let me worry like this.  If you’ve ever cared about me at all, Harry, please.  Please don’t leave me to wonder for the rest of my life.”
His face is grey, and lined, and his hair is like something I’ve never seen.  I imagine he’s been pulling at it.  At the sight of me, he dissolves into tears, and despite my feeling about crying, I hurry to his side.  “Draco,” I say, pulling him close.  He weeps into my neck, harsh, barking sobs that seem to go on forever while I stand, awkwardly patting his back.  He gains control of himself eventually, however, and produces a handkerchief which he uses to mop his face.  He looks over at Pansy, and his expression hardens.  “Pans, I told you not to.”
Harry takes to conjuring his Patronus. The stag stomps around the spare room, tossing his be-antlered head.  Harry tells it things.  Tells it how Draco’s eyes looked the first time he kissed him.  Tells him how, after the trials were over, he and Draco had been on a fund-raising committee together, they’d finally laid their animosity to rest.  How they’d started meeting for coffee, for pints, for dinner, and one night, for fire whiskey in Harry’s living room.  How they’d gotten spectacularly drunk and after some all-too-obvious maneuvering, had found themselves sitting close on the sofa.  How Draco had told him he’d always wanted to know something.  How Harry had whispered “What’s that?” and how Draco had leaned over, and captured his lips.
“Hello, Grand-Père,” she said gently.
“Do you think that Hermione knows that you’re feeling this way?”
“Dad.”
“That’s kind of you.  Thanks for coming to say hello.  I hope you have a good day.”  He takes her elbow gently, and escorts her to the door, opening it with a flourish, and bowing her onto the step.
“You did?”
“Just Harry,” he muttered, and with a firm grip on her arm, steered her toward the stairs.  Once back in the lounge, with Mr. Sanders sputtering angrily, he pointed unwaveringly at the sofa.  “Sit down,” he said.  Mrs. Sanders opened her mouth, but clearly saw something about the set of his jaw, and sat quietly.
The house elves, bless them, arrived with a tray, and soon, Cass and Scorpius were settled by the fire with their game and hot chocolate, and the adults were sitting with tea.  Draco looked as though he’d been hit in the stomach with a bludger.  His eyes never left his daughter.  He watched her as though he could drink up every moment of her life, everything he’d missed out on.
The earless wonder sits me down on a squashy sofa and says, with not a little bit of mischief in his voice, “So, Harry, tell me everything.”
“Sometimes, but my Papa says I’m braver than a dragon.”
“He is,” Snape replies.  Harry nods, planning.  He’ll need to speak to Minerva, arrange for time off.  He’s just considering whether to Apparate or Floo when Snape speaks again.  “I take it that you’re not allowing your current disagreements with your friends to prevent you from contacting Draco?”
“I do.  It will be good for her.  And I want him to meet her.  I’m just afraid I’ll lose her.”
“Potter, what the fuck?”
“Thank you for the offer, truly.  But I don’t go out, really, and never without Cass.”
Kreacher stalks off to sulkily bang pots and pans in the kitchen.  “Dinner won’t be long,” I say.  “Want to sit?”
I consider this.  She’s not looking at me as though we’re friends, but she also doesn’t seem like she’s about to kill me, or take more of my memories.  “I don’t know,” I say eventually.  “Why do you want me to?”
“Well, just one.”
Draco had never enjoyed hurting other people.  (Teasing them, yes, finding ways to feel a bit superior, obviously.)  The war had stripped him bare of any desire to exert such tendencies on another living thing.  His actions during the last crazy days of Voldemort’s rule had been full of cowardice, and had begun to change the way that he’d looked at others.  Escaping with his life had seemed such a gift that Draco had vowed, sitting in the barely-recognizable rubble of the Great Hall, to be a force for good, and if not that, to never allow someone else to hurt by his actions.  Which is why it hurt so much to have destroyed Harry as he did.  Especially Harry, who had such a capacity for love, and was so deserving of a life that was full of the adoration he deserved.  To learn that his actions hadn’t nudged Harry toward his family, his wife-and-three-kids that Draco felt he deserved…well, it hurt.
“Malfoy, it’s Harry Potter.”
When they flooed in, Draco felt the wash of familiar magic as the house recognized him as Lord of the Manor.  He instinctively strengthened the wards, and cast a spell of his own devising to banish any germs, then cast a quick cleansing spell on Harry and himself.  Harry grinned up at him as the magic tingled on his skin.  Then he looked around in wonder.  “You grew up here?”
“Six.  Nice little kid.  Hexed a classmate who was being a bully.”
Draco nodded.  “Mostly, yes.  There are some treatments that will effectively teach Scorpius’ blood to create the proper proportion of blood cells, and that will greatly extend his life expectancy.”
“All ready Cass?”
, and brought him back here where I could stop the cycle.”
“So you’re okay?”
“I want to suck you,” Draco whispered into Harry’s mouth.  “I want to taste you.”  Harry’s answering gasp was all the invitation he needed.  Draco fumbled with Harry’s flies, and when Harry’s cock sprang free from his pants, Draco wanted to weep.  “So beautiful, Harry.  Can I?”
He stares, open-mouthed, at the man smiling at him.  Finally, when he can’t bear the silence any more, he croaks, “Are you real?”
“You think his relatives starved him?”  Draco was horrified.
“Yes, imagine,” Draco said, feeling a bubble of hysterical laughter rise inside him.  He impatiently shoved it down, and continued.  “Anyhow, the Dark Wizard ordered your parents to stand aside, said he’d spare them if they allowed him to get to you.  Your parents refused, and he…well, he killed them both, I’m afraid.”
“Harry, please.  Stay away from him.”
It was nearing lunchtime when a call came in:
“Because you want to get to know Cass better,” Harry said stupidly.
“Yeah, but you call me Mill.”
“Do you think you’ll sleep?”  She nodded, and so Draco tucked the blankets snugly around her.  “May I kiss you goodnight?”  Another nod.  Draco spelled the lights low, refreshed the glass of water by her bed, and left her to rest.
Harry nodded, walking to the window and watching the traffic, and beyond it, the lake.  Draco handed him a bottle, uncapping one for himself.  Then he waited.   Whatever Harry was here to say, Draco was going to give him a chance to say it.
“He made me a better person.”
As he stepped aside to let the Malfoy family in, he took a moment to feast on the sight of Draco.  He was still beautiful after ten years.  He’d put on more muscle, and he was wearing his hair shorter, shaved underneath, with a bit of floppy length on top.  Harry had told himself that he’d imagined how grey his eyes were, but they were even more stunning than he recalled.    The handshake they exchanged was awkward, but Harry still felt weak at the touch of Draco’s long, slim fingers.  His hand was chilly, and for a split second, he remembered how they had once felt, touching his overheated skin.
Draco looked accusingly at Harry, who tried his best to look innocent, raising his hands in an ‘I swear this line of conversation has nothing to do with me’ gesture.  “Yes, Scorpius, I actually did know that,” Draco said with dignity.
“Okay, sweetheart,” he soothes.  “I want you to go to the Burrow and find Ron.  You do what you need to, and when you can, come.”
“Do you suppose he speaks French?” Draco’s mother asked.  “I could swear he is saying ‘Foi’, which, of course you know, darling, is the original pronunciation of our name.  Malfoi.  I think he’s trying to say your name.”
“You embarrassed me!”  Her voice rose as she continued, “You didn’t have to say that stuff in front of everyone.”
When his Mother, having mercifully refused tea, left via the floo, Draco returned to his lab, and conjured another rat.  Several hours later, he had three dead rats, and was no closer to a solution.  His head bowed in frustration, he threw the stirring rod he’d been using to test the viscosity of his latest failure, and stomped upstairs.  He was surprised to find Hermione sitting with Harry on his sofa, reading to him.  “What are you reading?”
“You realize that I’m not exactly impartial?”  I nod.  Draco steps to the pensieve and removes Hermione’s memories before raising his wand to his forehead and extracting a silvery strand, which he places in the basin.  “Come,” he says gently.
“It won’t.”
“Do you want some company, until you fall asleep?”
“What did he do with Kreacher when he moved to Canada, do you know?”
Draco tried to smile, but it fell terribly short.
“If you were only interested in dating me because you thought I was still like that, I understand.”  I get up and head to the floo.
“Alright,” I say slowly, as I take that in.
When he arrived at the address he’d been provided, balloons adorned the gate and the front of the house.  He could hear raised voices in the backyard.  Something told Harry that this would be a birthday party that the Powers family would remember for some time.  He opened the gate, and slowly made his way towards the backyard.  As he peeked around the corner, he assessed the situation with a keen eye.  Several of the children were crying, and one woman appeared to be in hysterics.  A man was shouting at another man and woman who huddled together, their arms wrapped around a little girl.
“How do you think that she’d explain it, Hermione?  Don’t mind me, Mum, I’m just brewing Harry’s illegal love potion.”
“Granger.”
“I understand.  Let’s focus on the physical priorities first then, and we can reassess.  As I mentioned, when you arrived here, you weren’t terribly healthy, and my team and I have been working to help with that.  How are you feeling right now?”
“So now you can understand why I need your help.  It’s actually a good thing that you’re still close to Draco.  I don’t want him or his family hurt by this.  We’re only here because Cass wants to donate bone marrow to Scorpius.  I need you to make sure that we’re protecting them, and Cass.”
“Please call me Astoria.  Scorpius, can you come say hello to Cass?”
“So you’re not doing it because of me?  Because I was upset earlier?”
“Harry, what’s wrong?  Are you sick?  Is it too cold?  Do you want to go inside?”  Draco was concerned.  The wards on the Manor were really very good, but it wasn’t unheard of that some remnant Death Eater had somehow snuck in and confunded Harry while Draco hadn’t been paying attention.
Turning away from the crypt, he noticed a cluster of people standing behind him.  Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Granger and Weasley, Longbottom and Abbot, Lovegood and her nutty father.  And Harry, standing resplendent in a set of black dress robes, his hair uncharacteristically sedate.  His resolve faltered a little at the look in Harry’s eyes, but he bit his bottom lip and regained control.
“Tell me,” Astoria said mildly, summoning the gin.
“Yes.  I told him that I thought we must be.  Because I’m here staying with him.  I’m going to try really hard though.  I’ll be an even better friend this time, Draco’s mum.”
And that was why, the next morning, Draco found himself in a set of carefully tailored robes, standing by the breakfast table next to a weeping Scorpius.  Draco’s son almost never cried, even when being subjected to the most painful medical procedures.  Today, however, his grey eyes looked at Draco pleadingly, and his bottom lip trembled.
Harry felt a roaring in his ears, as though the room were suddenly filled with a violent wind.  “Oh Cass, no.  That’s not how it is.”
“Yes,” they say in unison.
“Vi, it’s fine.  Harry has wards, remember?”  I must be still looking panicked, because she assures me, “At our house, we have to check the owls for hexes and jinxes before we let them in.”
“Maybe,” Draco said, not convinced.
“Yes,” Hermione says.  “I just don’t want you to do anything drastic.  You’ve experienced a bit of trauma, and we don’t know how long before you’re feeling more like yourself.”
Unexpectedly, Draco grinned at her.  “I’ll have you know that a Malfoy is never unnatural.  Ethereally beautiful, certainly.”
“I know,” I say.  And I do.  These two have, I’m told, been my mates through all sorts of stuff, and from the way that everyone clams up every time someone mentions school, or the war, or that guy Voldermord, it must have been bad.  But there’s something that isn’t adding up.  “I do trust you, honestly.  And I’m grateful to have you taking care of me, and I expect I’m being a royal pain in your arse while you’re doing it.  But, it doesn’t sound like anyone knows how long it’s going to be until I’m fixed, and I can’t very well sit around here with you as my nanny until then, right?  I’m going to have to figure some things out on my own, aren’t I?”
He crouched in front of Mr. Sanders and made eye contact, intoning “Legilimens”.  His Occlumency remained absolute crap, but Harry had been surprised, after being declared Horcrux-free that he was a better than fair Legilimens.  With surgical accuracy, Harry sliced through Mr. Sanders’ mind until he found the images he was looking for.  He exited the man’s mind, not taking any particular care to avoid causing him a headache.
“So how can I help you?”
“Of course,” John replied.
Harry stilled.  When Cass was little, and wasn’t able to talk about the things that were bothering her, he’d started to ask her to score her feelings out of ten.  One meant that she was contented and coping well, ten meant that she needed cuddles and ice cream, and for Harry to protect her from the world.  She’d never asked him the question in return.  “I’m fine, Cass, truly.”
“Honestly, Potter, I don’t think you thought about this at all.  This is what I hated the most about when we were together!  Nothing is ever simple with you.”
“Kingsley knows about this?” I ask.
“Do you?  I thought you were wealthy.”
The last photo in the album is one of me, and I look at it for a long time.  I’m absolutely filthy, for one thing, my denims ripped and one thin shoulder peeking out of my jumper.  My hair looks mad, but it seems that’s a fairly common occurrence.  I’m not looking at the camera, my attention captured by something behind the photographer, but I look…haunted.  I’m just a kid, but my expression is ancient, weary.  There’s smoke in the background, and I suddenly just know that this is taken after the last battle of the war.  Wondering again who would lay the fate of the world on the skinny shoulders of a seventeen year old kid, I close the album, and, with nothing better to do, I go to bed.
“Harry, I-”
“That’s right.”
“Draco?”  My voice is croaky.
“Yeah.  He has a baby, but he doesn’t have a wife.  It was a surrogate. Sort of.  He wasn’t lying to me.”
Draco was a little surprised, but nodded, and led Cass up the stairs to Scorpius’ large, bright bedroom.  Scorpius was full-on tantruming, and a lack of intervention now would result in a sulky, obstinate child for the rest of the day.  “What’s this, then?”  He kept his voice light and curious.
She let her head relax on his shoulder for a moment, and then put her hands on either side of his face and kissed his forehead.  “You are the best,” she said.  “Why haven’t you let me marry you again?”
“I’m good, Harry”
Maybe it does, but it sounds cold.  “And does your child-”
“That’s fine.  I just want you to say it out loud.”
Draco still comes by often.  He laughs until tears stream down his face when Harry tells him about Peachley’s failed seduction.  Harry is annoyed.  “I suppose you’re some sort of heartbreaker,” he says grumpily.
“You’re telling me.  Bring Violet along then.  We’ll sort out dinner, and she can play with Kreacher or something.”
Harry laughed.  “You don’t read the Prophet?”
Harry knew instantly what she meant.  It had been a few days after the war, and, overwhelmed by everything, Harry had walked from the Burrow over to Luna’s house.  She had made him tea, and held his hand, and rested her head on his shoulder, and for the first time in what felt like months, Harry had felt like he could take a full breath.  She’d been playing music, and when the song changed, Harry had bolted upright.  “What is this song?”
Harry raised his eyebrows.  It wasn’t uncommon for a child to perform a simple charm, something like levitation, summoning, or the odd notice-me-not, but a child who performed aggressive magic on another person was fairly rare.  It could be that the child simply had higher than average magical levels, but it also could be that he was being hurt in some way.  Harry didn't waste any time.  He dispatched the Obliviation Squad, and apparated to the coordinates.
“Did you experience any especially difficult situations?”
Draco fled, to his lab, where things were predictable, and safe. He placed his head on the cool marble of the worktable, and counted his breaths.  Eventually, the trembling ceased, and his breathing was more stable.  He considered, for a moment, firecalling Lara, but ever since their last session together, he’d felt unable to ask for her help.  She didn’t approve of what he was doing, and so he had to deal with the consequences himself.  That he wasn’t sure how to deal with said consequences made little difference.  The jangly, unsettled feeling roiling through his belly increased.  He was alone, and he had to somehow deal with the stupid choices he was making, the danger he was exposing innocent people to…
that bloke, Harry.  We know you better than anyone else does, and you’ve never said anything that would have us suspect this.  And Malfoy is about the last person in the world that I could see you getting off with.  You
“Harry,” she said.  “I want you to know that I support whatever decision you choose to make.”
“I expect so, as it’s Draco’s home.  Cass?  Could you try, as a favour to me, to give him another shot?”
His throat is tight, and his eyes prickle as he meets her eyes.  “Thank you, Minerva, truly.”
“Why is a known Dark Wizard working in a position of authority within our only financial institution?”
“Oh.  Right.  It’s simple.  I’ve been cursed.  You are a curse wrecker.  I need you to wreck me.”  I watch his eyes dilate at the innuendo, but he schools his expression again.
Harry tried not to let the hurt show on his face.  “I suppose you made the right decision all those years ago, then.”  He stood up.  “I’m very sorry to cut this short, but I’m starting to feel a little under the weather.  Astoria, if you don’t mind owling me when you’ve made an appointment for Cass to see Scorpius’ Healer?  We will make ourselves available whenever is convenient.”
“It’s not…I don’t…” Draco stammered weakly.
“We’re just a floo away if you need anything.”  Hermione wrapped her arms around Harry, who stiffened and gasped, but, just as she was about to pull away, leaned into the hug with a little sigh. Draco’s eyes caught Hermione’s anguished look.  It was like he’d never been hugged before.  “See you later, darling,” she said, her voice a little thick, as she kissed Harry’s forehead.
“I know that, but you had no obligation to prioritize anyone in my family.  Especially after…”
“Lord Harry Potter, Order of Merlin First Class.”  Five heads whip around to look at her, and her face is furious, immovable.
“Yes, Mother”
“That’s what I’m here for, Harry.”
“Fuck you,” he whispers, and then he’s running, ignoring the way Hermione calls his name, and the fact that Teddy, always sensitive to the emotions of others, is crying.  He runs until he reaches his quarters, and he wards the doors behind him.  As he sinks to the floor just inside the door, he struggles to get his breathing under control.  His hands shake, and he clenches them, feels the way his fingernails bite into his palms.  He sits there for hours, unmoving.  He wishes he could cry, but the sense of betrayal is too raw for tears.
“What should I bring?”  Draco knew better than to argue too forcefully.  Pansy had extended an olive branch, and if Draco spurned her graciousness, he’d be giving up his friendships forever.  Draco already had enough enemies without adding a house full of rabid Slytherins.
“Nice to see you, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said politely.
“It is,” Peter agreed.  “I was wondering if I could thank you a bit more personally.  Could I take you for dinner?”
“Nah, not my style, really.”  Harry grinned at Draco, and for a moment, the breath caught in Draco’s throat.  He was so beautiful.
He’s breathing fast, his cheeks pink, tiny drops of sweat beading on his forehead.  I’m so hard, and I can feel the orgasm building, starting from my toes and rippling through my legs.  I frantically rut against him, and he lets out the most delicious little whimper I’ve ever heard.  “Close,” he gasps, and I nod, the ability to speak having vanished.  “Harry,” he says, throwing his head back onto the pillow.  I feel his cock pulsing, the warm gush of his come against our bellies, and I helplessly follow him over the edge.  I’m losing feeling in my arms, and I carefully lever myself onto the bed next to him, trying desperately to get my breathing under control.  I feel as though my bones have gone to jelly.  I’m too spent to even look at him, and I stare at the ceiling, wondering how I didn’t figure this out earlier.  He clumsily grabs my hand, raises it in the air weakly and croaks, “Yay.”
“Are you?”
“Dad.  Invisibility cloak?”
“Yes,” I finally reply, when she doesn’t elaborate.
“I have to notify his parent,” Harry said.  “Can you possibly wait to rennervate him until his Father gets here?  I think he’ll be less scared.”
Lara lost her temper a little.  “He
“I don’t understand.  What aren’t you telling me?”
“Well, no of course not, with your memory loss and all.  Needless to say, the corruption runs deep.  Absolute power, you know.”
Kreacher looked gobsmacked.  In order to forestall a vigorous bout of self-punishment, Draco said hastily, “Thank you Kreacher, we’re fine.  No need to punish yourself, just go back to Grimmauld for a bit.  Get things tidied up for Master Harry when he returns.”
“Of course it’s understandable, Mister Potter.”  Harry felt a tug on his sleeve, and faintly registered the fact that he’d stood up.  “There’s no denying your integrity and moral fibre.  Is it true that you didn’t want your daughter to be raised by a Death Eater?”
“Draco, could you stop apologizing?  I understand.  You don’t need to keep beating yourself up.”
“I’m brave when it comes to risking my life to save people.  I’m absolutely chicken when it comes to this sort of thing.  I’m…I’m emotionally stunted, Draco.  It’s not that I don’t want to reach out to other people.  It’s that I have absolutely no fucking idea how.”
“Sweetheart, I wouldn’t have said anything if you hadn’t asked me a very personal question about my thoughts.  We’ve talked about this before.  Your abilities give you an unfair advantage over other people.  It’s very rude to share something you’ve learned at the breakfast table.”
“The cake is apple cinnamon, and the icing is caramel,” he says, his voice a bit proud.  Draco loves apple, and his sweet tooth was legendary amongst his housemates.  It’s a perfect choice.  “There’s a surprise inside.”
“Of course, Harry, whatever you need.  I’ll walk you down there myself.”
The ceremony goes perfectly, and Ron and Pansy accept their godparent roles delightedly.  Harry is beaming throughout, and, if his eyes aren’t on Scorpius, they’re on Draco, full of love, and pride, and a happiness that Draco can’t get enough of seeing.
His Mother’s banker and lawyer were there as well.  Draco thanked them for coming, made an appointment to sort out her estate the following morning, and then moved on to Harry and his friends.  “Thank you all for coming,” he said quietly.  “It means a great deal.”
“Of course,” Madame said with a smile.  “It does not yet have a core.  You are know a little something about wandmaking, though, to have asked.”
“You want to be the Saviour.”
“It’s important?”
“Sometimes.  And I get nosebleeds.  Papa says they’re
Some time later, I awaken in a completely different room.  I sit up, but as my brain tries to catalogue the memories that have been poured into my system, I flop backwards.
“Oh, I understand.  Well, Cass is really independent, and she’s excellent at self-regulation.  She makes her own decisions when it comes to sleep, and she does all of her…you know…self-care stuff.  I always pop in at night to say goodnight, but-”
that,” I say.  “Did I seem to like it?”
was one mess Draco was particularly happy to evade.  His lab was restored, more or less, and Draco was busy scrubbing the floors of the decontamination shower with a Muggle bottle of bleach, when Weasley arrived.
“Cleaning,” Draco muttered.  Potter had awakened a half hour earlier, and Draco had left him floating, but cast a bubblehead charm to protect his tiny lungs from bleach fumes.  The baby was entranced by the shield, and was poking his fingers at it with wide eyes.
now, urging him that something was wrong.  “I’m here to help you, I promise, and you, or your Papa, won’t be punished for accidental magic.”
“Do you suppose that it was his way of trying to open up the lines of communication?”
“Harry,” Draco said, completely moved.  “This is absolutely wonderful.  Thank you.”
“Last night.  He’s a curse breaker, did you know?  He’s agreed to help me try to figure this out.”
“I think that when I died, the part of me that was really human died too.  I think I might be just a shell of a half person, whose body hasn’t caught up with his soul,” Harry says.
“I doubt it,” Draco said, “these potions are delicate, and take ages.  They have to be stewed under moonlight for some time.  I don’t think that a shed that someone uses often would work.  It has to be somewhere that she can leave it without raising suspicion, and honestly, I don’t see this being possible in anything other than a proper lab.”
She nods, and steps backwards to let me in.  Ron and Rose are playing exploding snap, but he just grins approvingly and waves us into the kitchen.  I can hear him telling her that Uncle Harry will play with them after they get the boring grownup stuff out of the way.  This must be par for the course, because she doesn’t complain at all.
Oh shit.  Come on brain, think of something.  “Jeez, Draco, no!  I’m not joking about it, I swear.  I know that you’re not entirely straight because you seemed to like it when I licked your neck at a gay club not a week ago.  And I’m not making fun of it, because
It was awkward, but Draco knew better than to stay where he wasn’t wanted.  With a heavy heart, he flooed home.  For another agonizing night, he sat quietly in his Mother’s room, listening to her breathing and cursing his traitorous mind for remembering a warm thigh next to his own.
“Smith is that creepy bloke we saw today, right?”
“Harry?  Are you ready to start to name some of the themes that have guided your behaviour over your life, and how they prevent you from achieving your goals?”
“Don’t call me that,” Draco said sulkily.  “Can you call me Uncle Malfoy?”
“I had an aunt,” Draco said, conversationally, “and she wasn’t very nice to me.  Horrible, actually.”
“Yes. Yes, that’s…yes.” Harry said, and took Draco’s hand, leading him to the back door, holding the puppy with his other arm.
“Yes,” Draco said weakly.  “And, thank you?”  He didn’t mean for it to come out like a question, but he wasn’t sure how to take back the way his inflection rose, and so, with some additional awkwardness, Pritchard bundled herself off through the floo, and Draco busied himself with cleaning all the surfaces she’d touched.  The next several Aurors came and went without any declarations of shame at their earlier treatment, and Draco had nearly begun to hope that his day would pass without any further awkwardness.
“Master does not need to be concerning himself,” Kreacher said.  Harry’s brow wrinkled.  He was definitely hiding something.
“I suppose.”
Draco swallowed.  “Yes, that makes sense.”
“Six,” Harry said.  “I’m going to miss you something awful.  But I’m so proud of you, and so excited.  Besides, you’ll have Auntie Min and Uncle Professor to keep you in line.”
“Mrs. Weasley-Granger,” Draco said, his smile feeling tight around the edges, “thank you for meeting us on such short notice.”
“Stay alert,” a bunch of voices chorused.
I laugh.  “Forgive me, but having all of your memories wiped out makes you a bit less inclined to invite hostile strangers into your sitting room.  Who are you exactly?”
“I am,” Harry confirms.  “It’s nice to meet you.”
“I know, sweet one, and I’m sorry, but I need to go and help a kid.  I’m sure that Mum will help you with your divination,” Harry said, prompting a look from Hermione that promised future retribution.
“Maybe more than friends?” Harry asked, and Draco flushed, looking away.  “Draco, I’m sorry.  I reacted badly because my feelings were hurt, and then I felt stupid, and then all that stuff with Ginny’s trial happened, and I didn’t know how to apologize.”
“Yes, of course,” the healer said.  Draco joyfully went to floo call the relatives, and Minerva.  Astoria beamed and said she’d be back at the hospital within the hour.   As he closed the floo connection, Draco found himself feeling optimistic.  His children were okay.  They’d find out if the bone marrow was doing its job, and Scorpius would be safe.  He and Harry would figure things out, and he was certain that he’d be allowed to see Cass.  It was going to be fine.
“So you think that Hermione took my ability to love?” I can’t help but sound sneering.
He blinks at me a bit, and then huffs in annoyance.  “Fine.  Seven tonight.  I’ll owl you the address.”
“No!” Draco was shouting now.  “No!  Damnit, Lara, this isn’t to settle a score, or to gain favour from those who hold political sway.  For once in my life, I want to be proud that I did the difficult thing, that I chose the
Harry smiled.  “She is.”  He turned to look at her.  “You knew, didn’t you?”
a pub, not works in, but yes.  You’re a lucky fellow.”
“So you’re like Violet, then.  You had someone turn up in your backyard when you’d done something impossible?”
“You smell of someone else,” he growls.
“Yes, it would,” Harry said, his voice taking on a steely tone.  “I’m good at my job, Hermione, and, despite the fact that my suspicions back then were
“Oh, brilliant,” Ron said, “Well, I’m off.”
“He’s much more pleasant like this,” Harry said, and Draco admired his dimples as he grinned.  “That’s probably the nicest conversation I’ve ever had with your dad.  Probably the nicest one
He became aware of a warm hand on his arm, a breath close to his ear.  “Draco?”
“It’s sixth year all over again.  You two never can leave well enough alone.”
Minor: Cassiopeia Narcissa Potter
“I don’t know.”

“Take care, Draco.”
“You didn’t want anyone with you, after…”
the people we loved.”  She’s looking at him, and he nods, still watching the people on the street below, walking along as if today were normal, and completely unaware that the world sometimes ends in tiny increments, soul by soul, body by body.
“Tell me?”
“Yeah, I suppose.  I seem to have banged it up.”
“Yes, really.  Do you suppose we should get your your broom today, so that you have something to look forward to?”
The laugh huffs out of me without my permission.  Draco continues, “It doesn’t matter, though.  That’s the past, and there’s no point in revisiting it.  I’m interested in you now, Harry.”
“Verituserum’s working,” she says decisively, and then, as an aside to Bright,  “You bastard.”
Hermione pops her head in. “Hullo Harry, Hullo Kreacher.”
, more like connections.”
“It’s okay,” Harry said.  “You’re allowed for right now, okay?”
“I told him that I had had an epiphany while he was in the shop, and could I buy him a drink to tell him about it.”
“I’m okay,” she said immediately, and that was when Harry knew that she wasn’t.  Cass was an exuberant child, who was prone to fits of drama over trifles, but when she was actually hurt or upset, she adamantly insisted that she was fine.
Narcissa suddenly looked incredibly sad, and Harry’s forehead wrinkled in concern.  “Don’t you think I understand a little bit about doing a very wrong thing because you feel you have no other options?”
“Thank you Mrs. Malfoy, you too.  I like to be called Cass.”
“As you wish, My Lord,” she says.  I can’t help but grin at her.  She’s allowed to come visit me in my cabin in the woods.
, that Harry had kept the revelation to himself.
“Understand?  Easy.  Going against your marriage contract means that you lose your family.  If I had a family, I wouldn’t do anything to lose that.  I’d never ask you to.”
“I expect so,” Draco answered.  He didn’t mention that the conditions of Narcissa’s house arrest allowed her two visits to Draco a week, so she was unlikely to be anywhere else.
He hugged her then, tightly, and her shoulders hitched once before she buried her face into his neck.  “You good, Dray?”
“Draco,” Astoria said, her voice ice cold.  “First impressions won’t be made again after you’re no longer in a strop.”
“Hullo Neville.”
“And?”
“You have an appointment with him, and you don’t know what he does here?”
“Ugh,” Draco shuddered.
“To earn my keep,” Harry said, giving Draco a look that suggested he was simple for not understanding.
“Thank heavens,” I say, charmed.  “Quick, tell me three useful things.”
“Potter, Weasley,” Draco replied.  He directed Weasley to the chair, and began to prepare to administer the vaccination onto Weasley’s freckled neck when he caught a flash of crimson robes out of the corner of his eye.  “Don’t touch that,” he said sharply, and Potter yanked his hand back so quickly that he stumbled backward into a rack of vials that were cooling.  The rack fell to the ground with an almighty clatter, and a series of brightly coloured vials hit the floor.  Most of them had already been spelled unbreakable, but the blood thickening potion, which was still cooling, and an earlier batch of inflammation reducer that had to cure under the a full moon, hadn’t.  Draco watched, his thoughts detached, as the vials shattered, and the potion spattered all over Potter.
is trying except for you.  Your wife, your mum, all of Dad’s friends, even Scorpius is trying to make me feel welcome.  You need to choose between me and your temper tantrum, ‘cause you can’t have both.  Now, where’s my brother?”
“Oh, pardon me,” he says haughtily.  “I’m busy running a business, you know.”
“Alright,” Draco said, “but remember…”
After their meals, the waiter brought coffee, and dessert, and Draco noticed that Harry was watching him carefully.  “I’d like to ask you for something,” he said finally.
“Well, if we could brew Polyjuice in a bathroom, I’m sure she could find a way,” Hermione said, as if thinking to herself.  Draco had many follow up questions to that statement, but resolved to get answers later.  “She couldn’t be sneaking back to Hogwarts.  Do you think she was renting a space?”
“Sit down,” Harry growled, his voice uncharacteristically cool.  “I have questions.”
“Do you ever feel like you’re on the edges?” Luna says suddenly.
The Ministry is deserted at this time of night.  The night watchman stands as though he’s going to question us, but catches sight of Hermione, and nods acknowledgement.  The lift takes us to level nine, and Hermione exits through the doors the moment they open.  By the time we’ve all filed out, she’s sprinting down the halls.  Draco hauls arse after her, and the three of us pursue.  Ron looks decidedly uncomfortable as we approach a black door at the end of the hall, but at my questioning shrug, he just grimaces, and follows Draco and Hermione.  It’s even creepier as we reach a circular room with twelve doors.  Hermione narrows her eyes and confidently hauls one of them open.  We follow her inside, and Ron finally pipes up.  “What room is this one, ‘Mione?”
“Well,” I point out, “isn’t that telling you something?  How many people do you know who fight like that and don’t have
“I am alive,” Harry says, “for now.”
“Yeah, me too.”
“Merlin, I hope not,” Harry said with feeling.
She grins at me.  “It’s fine, Harry.”  She seems to be watching me, so I busy myself with looking at the photograph on her desk.  It’s a muddy-brown dog, who seems to have two tails that wave so hard they’re a blur.
“Thank you,” Draco said fervently.  “We’ll just come back then.  Scorpius, let’s go down to the canteen and-”
Draco felt like crying.
Harry smiled.  “Cass?  How does that sound?”
She looked at him delightedly.  “Hi Scorpius.  I bet that lots of people tell you that you look like your daddy.”
“You overheard?”
“I think it’s clear that you want to.  What I’m more interested in is why you want to so much.”
Harry nodded.  “Primarily, I have post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a reaction to living through a traumatic circumstance.  As you know, there are a few traumatic events that I’ve experienced, and so in my situation, it’s a bit difficult to narrow down when it originated for me.  Because of that, I’ve overdeveloped a few coping methods-”  Miriam made a little sound, and Harry’s mouth quirked.  “I’ve overdeveloped a number of avoidance behaviours,” he corrected, “which allowed me to continue to function for quite a while without experiencing many overt symptoms.”  He looked at Miriam, who beamed like a proud parent.  He took a breath, and continued, “The breakdown I experienced after I left England occurred, likely because I didn’t have access to the outlet for my avoidance behaviours, and I had to confront the trauma directly.”
“I’ve never tried one before,” he answered guilelessly.  “It’s so much better than a cot in a cupboard.”
“Hit and kick!”
“I’m actually rather impressed,” Draco answers, and for a moment they exchange a grin that’s just a little wobbly on the edges.  “Will you teach me the duplicating charm sometime?”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, tried in vain to wrap his legs around him too, but learned that it was difficult to do so while standing up. They tumbled to the ground, and Draco decided that it was a good a place as any, so he methodically stripped Harry bare and kissed every inch of his body.  Twice.
Later, as they parted at the apparation point, Harry reached for Draco.  His arms encircled him, and with his chest held close against Harry’s he felt like he was in the exact place he was meant to be, for the first time in his life.  The gentle press of Harry’s lips against his felt like a promise, one that Draco would do anything to ensure was kept.
“Did something a bit unusual happen here this evening?”
“Pans, I’ve told you.  I’ve been living like a Muggle for the past four years.  It’s difficult to be inconspicuous with an owl, and the hotels I stay in aren’t part of the floo network.”
Harry nodded.  “Not a great first impression.  He says he’s going to sue me for custody and damages.”
“I…Merlin, this is hard.  I’ve missed you.”
Draco gently touched his arm.  “You good, Harry?”
“He thought that he might be.  We never discussed it again, and then when he and Ginny reconciled after V-Voldemort died, I figured he was just confused, and that he’d decided that he was straight after all.  But he changed so much, Draco.  When we were camping, he told me that the idea of being intimate with Ginny was repulsive to him.  He couldn’t imagine sex with any woman, but Ginny specifically…he thought of her like a younger sister.”
The minute he’s gone, Grace turns to Draco.  “You’re a nutter,” she says.
“That bitch,” Draco said lowly, and Ron looked for a moment like he might take offence, but he shrugged instead.
“Just the details, the Department of Mysteries.”
Scorpius scoffed.  “You don’t get taller just because your birthday comes!”
“I do,” Draco replied.  “The staff there is inclusive, and Scorpius has been happy there.  Maybe a little less happy this year.  He's had more conflict, he's come home with stories of mean children occasionally.  Once he told me that the Head Teacher didn't like him.  I'm not sure how much of it is normal for his age, versus actual issues.  His teacher says he does well, though.”
“Bleh, stop doing social worker talk,” Ron said, making Harry laugh.
She flushes.  “Yes, okay.  I thought it was just some sort of…” she waves her hand vaguely, “trauma thing.  And…” her face suddenly burns brighter red, and she looks away.  “And, you usually only come when you take me from behind.”
“Ah shite,” I say.  “This bloke probably doesn’t know that my memory’s gone.  Now he’ll think I’m ignoring him.”
Harry sighed again, and summoned parchment and a self-inking quill.  Minerva excused herself, and even Severus left the portrait, leaving behind some wary-looking sheep.
Cass allowed that if he
Finally, checks completed, he put on a pair of sleep pants, and fell into bed.  He soon regretted his wistful benevolence, allowing Harry to remain sleeping in his crib.  He’d only just drifted off to sleep when an earsplitting shriek tore through the air.  On his feet in an instant, wand at the ready, Draco looked wildly around his room, but saw nothing out of place.  The monitoring charms that Ron had cast on Harry started pinging urgently then, and he remembered, in a flash, who was sharing his house.  He ran into the nursery, and found nothing awry, save a small child, on his knees in his crib, screaming at the top of his lungs.  “Mama,” Harry wailed.  “Mama, Mama.”
“Not hungry, Papa!”
Harry looked at Astoria gratefully.  He wanted to help her smooth things over, ease the way for Cass and Scorpius, but he knew that anything he said right now would incite Draco to further rage.  It was distracting, having Draco treat him the way he had in school, when Harry remembered them getting past it all. Cass, as usual, sensed his unease, and came over to climb into his lap.  As her fingers found the cuff of his button down, she said, “Astoria, can you tell me more about whether or not I can help Scorpius?”
He shrugs.  “It’s possible.”
Draco set him to work chopping potions ingredients one afternoon.  Harry cheerfully said, “This is way more fun than making stew,” and applied himself with a diligence that Draco had never seen at Hogwarts.  Draco wondered whether Harry would have been as abysmal at potions if Snape hadn’t been so hard on him.  From what he could see, Harry blossomed like a flower under the faintest of praise.  When Draco corrected the way he was holding his knife, then said, “Good,” when his technique improved, Harry had given Draco one of those slow smiles and Draco had had to hold the edge of the table, his heart hurt so much for this child.
“Of course,” Harry’s mouth felt as though it was filled with sand.
.  It had been a strange little twist of fate that had led him to his chosen career.  He’d been walking through Diagon Alley, having popped into the shop to say hello to Ron and George, when Harry had gotten the impression he was being followed.  A surreptitious look behind him confirmed that a photographer was dogging his path.  Harry had begun to lose the last vestiges of his patience with the Prophet.  How many pictures did they need of him going to a shop or drinking a pint?  In desperation, he’d ducked into the first shop door he saw.
“Where’s Teddy?” Harry asked eagerly.
“A bit. He’s just always been there.  And now that he isn’t, it feels strange.  I’m okay, though.”
Despite not having any tears left to cry, his body shakes with sobs.  When arms surround him, he tries to fight them off, and only stops struggling when he sees a flash of green that he’d know anywhere.  He stills.  “Draco.”
From the hallway, George said, “Yeah?”
He looks startled.  “Like what?”
“What?” Ginny looks a bit insulted.  Whoops.  Damnit.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice sounded strained.
“Oh,” I say.  “I hadn’t thought about that.  Sorry, Hermione, never mind.  Don’t stretch yourself too thin.”  She looks terribly guilty, sitting wretchedly wringing her hands.  “Anyway,” I say, “speaking of the curse, Draco said-”
“I have no idea.  Fear?  Intimidation?  The hissing?”
“And sometimes,” he says, “we’d sit out here, and hex the peacocks when they came too close.”  Harry laughs, a little horrified, but wholly amused at the idea of two snotty Pure-bloods doing something as undignified as casting spells on birds.  “You don’t understand,” Draco protests, when he sees the look on Harry’s face.  “They were absolutely vicious, and they’d chase me and bite me when I was small.  I was terrified of them, but my father loved them, doted on them as though they were kittens.  We had to keep our efforts secret of course, Father would have been furious if he’d caught us, but Mother knew how much they scared me, and she wanted me to feel safe, so she taught me how to scare them away.  She always wanted to keep me safe…” Draco’s voice trails off then, and Harry hears the intake of breath.  He puts his arms around Draco, and allows him to cry.  He’s nearly silent in his weeping, but his lean body trembles.  Harry recasts the warming charm three more times, while Draco cries, and sometimes talks.
It’s just nearing dinnertime, and so the pub’s mostly empty.  I sit at the bar, and a woman who looks around my own age smiles in greeting.  She’s pleasant looking, with an open, cheerful face, and wide-set blue eyes.  Her hair is plaited down her back.  “Hi Harry!”
“I’m fine.”  Cass sat next to her grandfather and took his hand.
?  Oh Merlin, Draco, honestly?”  Andromeda snorted.
“Direct from Canada, a case of their finest export.”  Draco pulled a box from his pocket and with a  quick wave of his wand, enlarged it.  He set the case of beer onto the counter and patted it with a fond smile. He’d become enamoured of the stronger beer in Canada, and was hopeful that this would buy him a few moments of peace, enough time to sneak back upstairs to the floo and escape.  The She-Weasel was giving him hateful glares across the kitchen.  Draco fearfully remembered her Bat-Bogey hex, and tensed.  Honestly though, she’d
“Scorpius needs a bone marrow transfusion.  That’s where they find someone who has similar characteristics, and they extract a little bit of the inside of one of their bones.  When they put that marrow inside Scorpius, he has a very good chance of getting better,” Minerva said.
“No.  Maybe.  I’ve never…”
When they were standing in the yard, the puppy curiously snuffling around in the snow, Draco cast a warming charm on them both and looked at Harry seriously.  “So, I think you like him.  It was okay, that I did this?”
Apologies to anyone named Wendell.  I don't think it's a weak name, Harry does.  Flame him, not me.
“I don’t know, Draco!” She’s shouting now, and standing, her feet wide apart in a combative stance.  “He’s the hero, isn’t he?  Why the fuck are you shagging the Chosen One if not to swoop in and save the day?”
“You should be, Harry.  If it doesn’t sound too condescending, I’m proud of you too.”  It was true.  Harry had worked hard over the previous five months.  Draco had continued to attend some of his therapy sessions, and Cass had attended some as well.  The sessions were difficult, as Harry exorcised his pain, and rebuilt his foundations.  When Hedwig House had pronounced him capable of living independently, he’d found a flat near Draco’s house, and had focused on continuing to heal while being confronted with reminders of his past.  As with everything he committed to, however, Harry was dedicated, and he had made incredible strides on rebuilding his relationship with his daughter, with the Weasleys, and with Draco.
When his body had finished changing, Draco wanted nothing more than to run away.  That was, frankly, the most terrifying experience he’d ever lived through.  More terrifying, even, than the sight of the adult Potter’s still body being carried back from the Forbidden Forest (Draco didn’t bother exploring why he still called the adult version Potter, while the child remained Harry) and the notion that he’d failed, and the Dark Lord had won.  Somehow, this tiny child under Draco’s care, still and unbreathing, was so much worse.  Draco’s breath was coming in painful gasps and his entire body trembled.  Hermione took one look at him, and at Harry’s tiny form, and said, “Draco, go.  I’ll get him into some bigger clothes, and we’ll see you soon to cast the diagnostics.”
His only scheduled appointment was a follow up with the Powers family.  Harry apparated to the same alley as before, and presently, found himself knocking on their front door.  Violet flung the door open.  “Mr. Harry,” she beamed.  “You came back!”
, but you would have loved Cass from the moment you knew about her.  I was so afraid that you’d take her from me.  I’d already lost you, and yes, I know that I fell too hard, got too comfortable, but I was heartbroken.  And the idea that I’d give birth to this child, this little person who I already loved and you’d take her away too...”  Despite what he'd told himself earlier, of the fantasy world he'd constructed about how he and Draco would raise Cass together, he knew that this was a time to be completely honest.  If he had any hope of Draco understanding why he'd kept their daughter a secret, he needed to bare his neck, confess his weaknesses.
“I suspected.  Never knew for sure.”
Breakfast goes smoothly, with Kreacher plying me with more food than I think I could consume in a week.  I learn that he doesn’t actually live here, and also that I apparently own another house.  Why I’m living in the most boring flat known to man while I own an entire house, I have no idea.  It’s bound to be more exciting than this one.
Later, after Cass had gone to bed, Harry heard a little voice say, “Dad?”
“And then,” he continued, unaware of Draco’s ruminition,  “I thought I’d gotten the hang of things…Cass wasn’t sticking stuff up her nose anymore, and she finally stopped fucking
“I take it you haven’t told anyone?”
“I do, thank you.  Do you know if Draco is at the Manor?”  Draco moved into London immediately after getting his NEWTs, but if his Mother needed him, he would have gone home.
Harry’s eyes darkened. “You wish, Malfoy.”
“That doesn’t make any sense,” Draco spits.  “Without a conscience, without something driving us to a higher state of behaviour, we’d all be baseless animals.”
Draco puts his arm around me.  “I think that we should do this in one of the spare suites.  I expect that you’ll need some time to recover from having your memories restored so quickly, so this way we won’t have to levitate you anywhere.”
“Nope.  And I could get fired, or maybe sent to Azkaban.  But if I can get her to tell me who she’s getting the potions from, or where she hides them, I could get the evidence, and then get Hermione to memory charm the illegal stuff away from me and Gin.”
“That’s pretty far-fetched, Harry.”
“Your Grand-Mère wants me to go see her.”
a granddaughter.  Your name might be Potter, but you’ll always be a Weasley too.”
“That he’ll figure it out on his own?”  Hermione nodded.  “Very Slytherin of you, Granger.”
“Well, yes, I suppose.  But he was the one who gave information to the Prophet in fourth year, and that
Harry heard a noise, and it was as though a separate, detached part of his brain was registering it.  Noises didn’t matter anymore.  Darkness mattered, and Blanket, and Safe.  Harry absently registered the sound of talking, and frowned.  He didn’t like when he heard voices.  They made him cry, and Harry wasn’t allowed to cry.  He burrowed deeper into Blanket, making sure that his head was covered.  It wouldn’t be long before the voices would go away.  They always did, just like the shadows that descended on him with angry, sucking mouths, and the red eyes that lurked in the corner.  He waited patiently, but the voices kept making noises.
“True.  Do you have any questions?  Do you want to talk about anything?”
Harry wasn’t going out at all, he knew.  Despite the fact that he was nearly back to his normal appearance, they had been keeping his presence secret, to evade Ginevra’s attention.  And Draco also knew that Harry hadn’t been left alone, not once, since he’d de-aged in the first place.
“Yes?”
“I keep getting into trouble.  I’m trying so hard to be good, and Papa is trying hard too, but if I get into trouble, then maybe someone will think that he’s not a good Papa,” Scorpius explained, clearly having trouble explaining his fear.
Lucius nodded and bowed low, before spying Scorpius and Cass, and headed in their direction quickly, saying, “Draco!  Bring your friend and we’ll go visit the peacocks!”
being mean.  Like, it makes her feel superior or something.”
“Kreacher!  No!  It’s Mill, my partner at work.  I don’t really fancy girls that way.”
“No, Tori, it’s really not.”
“Yes,” Draco said, hoping that something enormous would fall on the house and kill him dead so that he wouldn’t have this conversation.  “Well.”
Papa looked even sadder.  “Because your Dad is the most forgiving person I’ve ever met.  He always saw the best in people.  We can talk more about that after, but I’m trying to explain something about your Dad, and it’s important that you understand this.”
“Thanks.  I don’t know how I ended up here last night.  I’m sorry.”
He was further surprised when the short message inside was from Harry, not Hermione.
“And more recently.  Think of the last time that you saw him, before this happened.”
“This is mad.  We’re never going to be able to see things the same way.  If you insist on believing that you didn’t take the coward’s way out, I don’t really think we have much to talk about.”
“I’ll try, Cass,” he said, and sighed.  “The thing you need to know about Harry Potter, is that I have been fascinated by him for as long as I can remember. When I was small, every child in our World knew his name.  Whether he was a hero or a menace depended greatly on what side your parents fought on.  You know about Voldemort?”
We make our way through the newspapers, and Draco says, “Oh, Luna’s left a note for you.”
Draco’s mum smiled.  “Thank you, Harry, that’s a lovely thing to say.”
The snake is watching the process with interest.  “I like this one.  She’s angry a lot.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Weasley, it’s lovely to see you as well.  Merry Christmas,” Draco said, instinctively falling back on the manners that had been drilled into him since he could speak.
“Master isn’t concerned, Kreacher, just curious.  Master certainly wouldn’t want to have to order you to explain what’s going on.”
“I don’t need your help,” Harry mumbles, but it’s more out of reflex than anything else.
The little owl seemed to have known that Draco would have a return missive, because he hopped excitedly from one surface to another as Draco wrote, and twittered noisily as Draco fastened the parchment to his leg.  As he disappeared through the window, Draco thought about what it would be like to experience his own adolescence again, and he hoped that Harry would be alright.
, he thought.  He was home most of the day, and Cass would eagerly help care for one.  He resolved to look up animal shelters after Minerva had returned to Scotland.
“Nah,” I say.  “I don’t think that’s fair to Ginny.  Also, I imagine your Mum is pretty narked off at me.”
Violet’s mother finally spoke.  “This doesn’t make any sense.  I think you should leave.”
sure, and he was tired of avoiding it.  “It isn’t your fault that I fell in love with you.”
did.”
The tiny figure illuminated by the hallway light didn’t move.  Harry crouched down beside the mattress.  “Are you hurt at all?”
There’s a naming ceremony for Pansy’s son next week, and Harry doesn’t know what to do.  “Think they’ll notice if I don’t come?”
to one another, each never requiring an answer from the other about what they were saying.  Still, Ron and Hermione's petty squabbling, which seemed as natural as Quidditch at Hogwarts, seemed to have become further entrenched as they aged.
My skin goes prickly, and a strange ache causes my stomach to lurch.  “Mill, that’s…”
Apparently, this is the best possible way to break the ice.  She regales me with tales of Reginald the Crup, and we pass the time quite pleasantly until an impossibly deep voice says through the closed door, “Agnes, is Potter here?”
“Scorpius,” Draco said stiffly, uncomfortable.  Harry wasn’t sure whether it was a warning to Scorpius about being presumptuous, or a preference that Harry Potter stay far away from Draco's family.
“How does this concern me?”
“Hi Dad,” Cass was shy around him now, and the tentative note in her voice caused Harry’s smile to wobble a little.
He was looking down at Hank again, and a single tear slid down his cheek and landed on the fuzzy head before Harry pressed his lips together and scrubbed a hand over his face.  “Keep going, Harry,” Miriam said gently.
“I don’t think it’s stupid,” Draco said, after some consideration.  “But I don’t think there’s any sort of scorekeeping like that.”
-Peach
His face crumbles.  “I knew that the people who were threatening me were involved with the Ministry, but I never knew who, and I didn’t think they’d be so blatant about what they were doing.  I never dreamed that they’d take Scorpius and when they did, I never thought they’d take him to the Ministry.  I thought that it was someone who was acting of their own volition, someone who was taking things into their own hands.  I can’t believe that this is all officially sanctioned.”
“I’m sorry that I’ve been so awful.”
“Have you been happy, in the life you picked?”
Harry’s eyes widened a fraction.  “I’ll be fine.  Just go about your…work.”  The Conservatory had once housed a number of rattan loungers, and Harry spotted one in the corner, along with all of the scraggly plants.  He dragged it from the pile, and threw himself on it.
“Middle of the night.” The voice is quiet, even though there’s nobody here to wake.  Kreacher likely has been secreted away in his disgusting hidey hole for hours.  It’s just them.
“No she won’t,” Hermione said firmly.  “You’re the victim, here.  She’ll understand, Harry.  You’ll see.”
“This is work too, Kreacher.  You’re helping make Violet feel welcomed, and letting Mill and I talk.  You’re fine, okay?”
“Alright,” Hermione said presently, changing the subject gracefully, “there must be a few ingredients that are common to all love potions, right?”
.  He remembers how tired he was, how his mind raced with Snape’s memories, of Dumbledore’s manipulations, of the gut-wrenching fear that if this didn’t work, that the only people left in the word that he loved would die.
“You look like you feel a bit twitchy, and I figured that you might not realize that running helps you when you’re like this.”  Now that he mentions it, I do feel like my nerve endings are buzzing.  Maybe there is something to having people who know you this well.
“You did, actually,” Draco said, uncertain why he was bringing it up, but wanting Harry to know how much his mum loved him.  “You had a Mother who loved you very much.”
“I’m sorry, Daddy,” Cass threw her arms around Harry’s neck.
He escaped to the shower then, and stood under the steaming water with his head against the tile.  It was there, behind a silencing charm, that he finally gave way to the the wailing, grieving animal that had taken up residence inside of him.  He cried until the water went cold, and even then, as he turned off the faucet and sunk to the cool floor, his tears fell unchecked.  For a single, childish moment, he longed for his father.  His father, who, after finally being released from Azkaban wasn’t really himself any longer, and could certainly do nothing to help fix Draco’s child.  Then, he towelled himself off, and went to check on Scorpius again.
I shrug.  “Dunno, really.  The healers say my Magical Core is fine, but I can’t really remember much.  Anything from before that I could do wandlessly and silently, I remember, but all of the incantations and wand movements are gone completely.”
“Astoria!”
“Your mama loved you very much, Harry,” Draco whispered.  “She wishes she was here with you, and your dada too.”
“You’re very different.  Not just your choices,” she protests when I open my mouth to protest.  “Something more fundamental than that.”
Draco laughs.  “He is, if he’s still the same as he was in school.”
His glare in return is filthy.  I wonder briefly if she's calling him a bastard for the kidnapping or the sandwich.
“What if one of us had a child with someone else?” Astoria’s voice was impassive.  “It takes each of us to provide the faulty genetic factors, correct?”
“I think,” Draco said slowly, thinking, “that I have been about as happy as your Dad has been.  So there is the sad story of Draco and Harry.  Did I upset you?”
“Alright,” Draco replied, pouring another cup of tea.  “So, a long time ago, there was a really Dark Wizard, who didn’t like Muggles at all.  He thought that those who had magic were better than those who didn’t.  And he thought that those who were Muggleborn,” he paused here and registered Harry’s look of confusion, “Those who were born magical, but from Muggle parents, weren’t as good as children born of two ‘pure’ wizards.”
“Draco fought with
So he’s surprised when, at a picnic that he’s managed to convince Minerva to allow him to host at Hogwarts, Luna sits next to him expectantly.  He’d been, as had become his custom, sitting off to one side, watching his friends and family playing in and around the Black Lake.  The squid is delighted to have the company, and it waves a lazy tentacle in the direction of George and Charlie, who are launching off of one another’s shoulders and cannonballing under the surface.  The children are running around screaming.  Molly is fussing over the picnic baskets, which, Harry knows, have been stocked with never-ending food, coming directly from the kitchens.  Teddy is aloft the new broom Harry bought him, tentatively trying to do a loop.  Luna’s gaze is uncharacteristically sharp, and instantly Harry knows what’s coming.  “Luna,” he says warningly.
“No, don’t want to meet him like this.  ‘M pathetic.”  I sit, realizing that my life, objectively, is shit.  “Orphan,” I say at one point. “No family whatsoever.”
We sit, awkwardly clutching our teacups.  Only Ron, lured in by the cakes that accompanied the tea, is working his way through the tray like it’s a vocation.  The atmosphere is tense.  How do you begin a conversation with your best friend about why she obliviated you to prevent you from becoming a Dark Lord?  I settle on, “Explain.”
Their game was interrupted by the sound of applause on the ground.  Draco looked down to see that a collection of Weasleys had assembled while they were playing, who were cheering Cass’ success.  Cass flew down to her waiting fans, stopping just short of the ground, and leaping into Ron’s arms.  Harry and Draco stayed, hovering, watching it all.  “She loves them,” Draco observed bemusedly, watching as Cass hugged each Weasley in turn.  “She’s only just met them.”
“Wait.  She actually gave you the potion?”
Hermione’s face lit up when she saw him.  “Harry! What a nice surprise.”
Mill’s laugh fills the lift, as she pushes the button for the ninth floor.  “You’re Harry Potter, you gobshite.  Of course he wants to make sure the Saviour is well, especially since he got hurt on the job.”
“I don’t even know where to begin.  Those two potions couldn’t possibly have de-aged him in this way.  He needs to go to St. Mungo’s, Weasley.  They’ll sort him out.  I’m happy to provide my formulas, and any potion residue that remains.”
“No?” Draco raised an eyebrow.  “So you think that you can kiss me goodnight and then fall asleep silently?”
Harry laughed, and it was so joyful that Draco’s heart leapt.  He hadn’t heard Harry laugh like that since he’d been a baby.  “You got that, huh?  I honestly don’t know what possessed me to send that.  I was rummaging around an antique store in Brighton, and I saw it, and it made me laugh, and I was missing you, so I just sent it out to see what you would do.”
“Dray?” Her voice is unexpectedly soft.  “Darling?”
The air outside is cool, compared to the stifling heat of the dance floor.  I lean against the bricks, my eyes half closed, the too-strong drink making my senses blur.  He stands in front of me, his legs wide, knees surrounding mine.  He presses close, his cock hard against my groin.  The friction is bliss.  He kisses me, but he’s too enthusiastic, all tongue and spit, and alcohol breath.  I push him backwards a little.  “Why don’t you put that mouth to use somewhere else?”
“So then, your so-called ‘best friend’ plucked her way through your brain, obliviating memories at random in the hopes that she’d make you a better figurehead for the Ministry,” Draco says, glaring with full heat at Hermione.
“Of course, darling.  I noticed that you’ve been holding the baby.  That seems like an awful lot of progress.”
He blew his whistle, and the girls retook their seats.  “That was excellent.  I like how clearly you all spoke.  Alright, if somebody puts their hands on you, what do we do?”
But then he’d never
I know that I have to hear the rest of Hermione’s story, but I keep putting it off, insisting that we check on Scorpius, and go feed (fucking) Wendell, and coerce him into writing a sick note to his boss at the Ministry to buy us some time.  Eventually though, with the note owled off to the Department of Mysteries, and Scorpius fed and put back to bed, there’s nothing further to occupy us, and I’ve run out of excuses.
“I don’t know if Hermione and I are going to make it,” he blurted out, and then looked panicked, as though saying the words had made it a reality.
“I left for Canada that night,” Draco finished.  “The first few months were terrible.  I had a job in a concession stand at a hockey arena.  Every night when I finished working, I’d go back to the dismal hotel I was renting, and try to convince myself not to write you.  I wanted to die.  Most nights I drank myself stupid, trying to forget the way your eyes stared up at me, like I mattered.”
“No wonder I was so fucked up!”
“You’re welcome,” Draco replied.  As the door shut firmly behind Harry, Hank edged closer to Draco, who was looking at Miriam with wide eyes.  “That…was excruciating.”
Hermione laughed and laughed.  Her serious face completely transformed and Draco watched, entranced.  “Say what you will about Harry, but I don’t think that him being lucky is accurate, strictly speaking.”
The journey to the Auror offices doesn’t take long, but I don’t say much on the walk.  I’m deep in thought.  My intuition is telling me that there’s more to the story than Kingsley’s letting on.  As we arrive at the large, open concept office that houses the Auror Corps, I immediately notice something.  There are young people working here, but there are also a lot of people who are older than me.  Surely there’s someone who’s more suitable amongst these experienced people.  At twenty-five, I can’t possibly be the most qualified candidate.  Also, I can’t imagine why I’d want to do this.  Surely I deserve a quiet life after all the shite I went through.  Can’t someone else stabilize the world?
He wrapped Cass into a tight hug, and whispered something into her ear.  She looked at him, bit her lip, and nodded, and then he kissed her forehead.  Again, Draco felt completely excluded, and a bit ashamed that he’d handled this situation all wrong.  Again. “Have a nice couple of days,” Harry said.  “I’ll see you on Friday.”
“What is it?” Draco asked, the moment he’d shut the door behind them.  Hermione gave him a guilty look.  “Out with it, Granger.  Don’t think I didn’t notice that you nearly bit my head off when I suggested asking Ginevra.”
He was absently cleaning his sink for the third time that day when he had a thought.  Suppose she wasn’t buying the potion pre-made, but was brewing it herself?  Draco knew that Ashwinder eggs were a restricted substance, and since they were certainly what had caused Harry’s reaction, he was absolutely sure that they’d been used in the potion.  He quickly scribbled a note, and cast a quick
Hermione continues, “The ego develops as a sort of mediator between the id and the real world. It is the decision-making component of personality. It’s the factor that helps us postpone gratification when it isn’t appropriate.”
Cass waited.  Here’s the part where her Dad would ask her if she was doing okay.  If she was lonely.  What her number was.  But of course, Papa didn’t know about the numbers.  And, it seemed, that fancy people like the Malfoys didn’t talk much about feelings.  Rather than wait around for him to figure it out, she decided to fix things for herself.  “I’m a bit lonely for my Dad.  And since I can’t see him, I was hoping I could see someone who loved him.”  This seemed to make Papa look sad, but Cass was getting tired of trying to figure out what was going on with these people who never seemed to say what they were feeling.  “Could I visit my Auntie Hermione?”
“Oh, yeah?”
“Git!” Ron bellows.
“You’re lucky you aren’t going to this stupid thing, mate,” Ron says, through a sandwich as he emerges from the kitchen, Rosie perched in one arm.  Hermione slaps his arm and he says, “What?  It’s going to be bloody awful.”
They stopped at the broom shop first.  Draco needed a new broom servicing kit, and as he picked it out, he noticed Scorpius looking longingly at the training brooms.  Draco glanced at Astoria, and she winked at him.  “I was thinking,” Draco said conversationally, drawing up next to his small son, “once you get your transplant, there’s no reason not to learn how to fly.”
“No, I wouldn’t imagine so.  I think that quite a lot of the time, you wear battling wear.  Dragonhide pants, spellproof vest, that sort of thing.  These are used for when you have meetings, to be in court, or at ceremonies.”
Auntie Hermione hesitated.  “I’m not sure, honestly.  I know that he loves you more than anyone, and if he’s not able to be here with you, it means that things aren’t great.” Cass was glad that she was being honest.  If she’d said something like ‘I’m sure he’s fine’, Cass wouldn’t have believed her.
“Alright.  I studied with the Doctor who’s running the trial.  I can have his file and bloodwork sent over today, and get you an answer quite soon.  If he’s approved, though, the process to gain Ministry approval can take quite a while.  They seem to be chronically understaffed in that Department.”
“And you’re his mummy, so he will always come back to you.  That's what I'd do if I had a mum, and Draco's the smartest person in the whole world, so that's what he'd do too.”
The longer he tried to ignore it, the more his sixth sense clamoured for attention.  This was different from his normal compulsive impulses.  Finally, unable to ignore it, Draco grabbed some floo powder, and readied himself to throw it into the flames.  He stood there for a minute, uncertain how to make his body obey his mind.  The two factions warred for a while, and, desperate to do something, Draco stomped away from the floo and to the shelf where he kept clean phials.  His breaths tearing his throat, he stood there, utterly furious with himself for his inaction.  The anger rose and peaked in him until, with a crash, the phials shattered, spraying the lab with glass.
“What are you implying, Hermione?”
“I’ll have you know I didn’t dress him, that was Kreacher.   It would be helpful if we could get any information on what Potter’s been taking, though,” Draco answered.  “Are you sure we can’t ask your sister if she has any ideas?”
There’s been something that’s been nagging at me for a while, and I’m having no luck in figuring it out on my own.  Despite her strangeness, Luna seems inherently trustworthy, so I decide to confide in her.  “Luna, I think Hermione might be caught up in this stuff at the Ministry.”
“How do you explain the hair, then?”
“Power-mad maniac,” I say.  “Stomped around England with a bunch of deluded followers who wreaked havoc.  Listened to some mad bint spouting nonsense in a bar and declared me his nemesis.”
“Alright, darling.  We’ll move on.  Anyhow, I’ve been sent as an emissary.  My housemates and I will forgive you your misgivings if you come to Liquor Potluck tomorrow night at eight.”
“Tactical operations…like out in the field?” I ask eagerly.
“Harry.” His face is so sad that I stand, and almost reach out to him when I remember.  He broke up with me.  He might not want me to touch him at all. I stand a little awkwardly.  Maybe he’s here to to ask me to leave.  “I know we have things we need to talk about," he says.  "We need to sort out, Merlin...everything, but I’m honestly so exhausted that I just can’t right now.”
“You’re a git, Draco.”
“Yeah.  Not bad.  Cass, how was your test?  Arithmancy, right?”
“It’s okay, Pippy,” Draco said absently, “I understand.”
Harry pushes his glasses up on his nose and sighs.  “I’m not really good at explaining stuff, but I’ll try.  Everyone has moved on, since the war.  Figured out what they wanted to do, started dating people.  Growing up.  And I just…couldn’t.  I couldn’t let go of stuff, and so I couldn’t fathom how I might try to live a proper life.”
But, I realize, I’ve reached the end of my patience.  I don’t think that I’ve been much more than a pawn, all along.  Certainly, to hear of the way Dumbledore used me, I fell into my role without much reluctance, as an impressionable eleven year old.  And then, fresh from a War, a War during which I willingly walked to my death, Kingsley and his Ministry must have seen me as ripe for the picking.  With a quick apology to my former self, who will no doubt be furious with what I’ve done with his life, I say, “Minister, I’ve a number of things to do today, and I’m certain you’re a busy man as well.  Shall we get straight to the heart of the matter?”
.  “You don’t know what I can do.  I will be going home today.  You can’t stop me.”
“Thanks, and I may, if needed, but it might not be a bad idea to see if I can go it on my own a bit.”  In truth, I need some alone time.  I can tell instinctively that these two love me, and are the sort of people who would help me bury a body…for all I know, they have done, but their energy is a bit intense.  I want to sit in a quiet room, drink something smoky that burns its way down my throat, and be alone with my thoughts.  Also, wank, but they don’t need to know that either.
I sleep soundly, and when I startle awake I find a set of big brown eyes staring at me.  They belong to Rose, who I’m told is my Goddaughter, and I’m just a bit unnerved at having been stared awake.  “I was being quiet,” she says defensively, and I can’t help but grin.
“Of course I’m sure.  It sounds like it sucked, from start to finish, and I don’t want any more things blindsiding me.  Right now.  You, and you,” Harry looked at Draco.  “Tell me everything.”
her, but Mum said that I had to invite her, but she was calling my friend Steven a bad name, and I told her to stop, but she pushed me over.”
I smile into his lips.  “I’d like that.  I have some things to do about the baby Death Eaters, but I should be able to fit it in.”
“Yes, good.  We’re going to yell, ‘Don’t touch me!’  And when we get away, we’re going to run for help.  What if they don’t stop touching us?  What then?”
“I won’t let them take her.”
Harry gaped at him for just a second, before remembering who he was speaking with, and promptly closing his mouth.  He gave Snape a nod, almost a bow, and went upstairs to bed.
“You’re braver than I am, Scorpius,” Harry said, and Scorpius beamed up at his Father.
Andromeda laughed outright.  “Nice?  I’m not certain that there’s anything nice about maintaining the Black family legacy.  Or the Malfoy one, for that matter.”
Cass nodded.  “He said he fell in love with your face when you found your wand.”
“Hello, sir,” I say.  “Your daughter has been sharing all your trade secrets with me.”
“Harry,” Mill smiles at me, and it’s a sad one, one that doesn’t transform her face like it usually does.  “I don’t think that you get just how cruel Slytherin House was.  To Gryffindors, and to any Muggleborn student.  To you, especially.  We were part of an organization intended to spy on the other houses during fifth year, and in our seventh year, Death Eaters were in control of the school.  They used students to administer discipline.”
“And has the distance given you any insight?”
"Not exactly."
if it were Pansy.  Besides, her privacy is the last piece of dignity that she has left.”
I think for a moment.  I see the way the sun shone through his hair as he flew, the way he looked at his son with reverence, the way that he looked at
To my horror, her eyes fill with tears.  I start to panic a little, but she swallows hard, stands, and comes around the table to wrap her arms around me.  She gives good hugs, and says into my ear, “I love you, Harry.”
“Yes.  Well, we have four months until Robards plans to step down.  We could put you into intensive training, I suppose.  Maybe send you to Hogwarts to get you back up to speed on your magic, then get you in with the Auror Training Squad…” he’s clearly thinking out loud.
“Yes, I have great respect for the tradition the Ollivander family created.  Not only have they sold some of the finest wands, they have also trained many gifted wandsmasters.”
Draco is sleeping next to me, and purple smudges underneath his lashes suggest he’s been sleeping poorly.  Careful not to disturb him, I edge out from under the covers, and perch on the windowsill.  Alone, and coherent, I survey myself.  My memories seem to have slotted themselves back into order.  I remember a dusty cupboard, ‘You’re a wizard, Harry’, Phoenix, and basilisk, and Sectumsempra, and a skinny ex-convict, and a lonely walk through a forest, and a train station.  I remember how fighting a troll means best friends, and that bossiness can mean care, and jealousy can mean being valued.
“He’s awfully strange and I couldn’t fathom making small talk with him, so I sent him home,” Draco answered.
“Well, I’m not dealing with this, Weasley.  Good luck.  Don’t forget to pick him up some nappies on your way to Mungo’s, lest he wee all over you.”
“And you just let him go?  You let him think that we don’t want him?  You let me think he didn’t want me?”  Cass was furious.  How could she be left out of something so important?
Astoria was around, often, and on more than one occasion, Cass entered a room, only to see Astoria and Papa speaking in low tones, with serious faces, only to abruptly stop talking and paste tense smiles on their faces when they saw her.
Ron gave him a sudden wide smile.  “Thanks, Malfoy, you’re alright.  I’ll take you up on that when things are less mental.  Anyhow, about Ginny…I’ve spoken to Kingsley about the whole situation.  We go back a bit, and he’s a good friend of Harry’s, so I figure we can trust him.  Plus, he was an Auror for years, so he knows how it goes.  Kings said that without some more proof, we don’t have any chance of getting Ginny taken into custody.  I’ve got two ideas, and they’re both absolutely mad.  I was wondering if you could give me your opinion.”
“Yes,” he says, and then immediately afterwards, “I don’t know.”
“Yes you bloody were!” Ron shouts, and I’m a bit surprised, to be honest.  Ron seems so laid back that this seems out of character, and I’m wondering if he’s a homophobe.  That’s disappointing.  But then I remember that this bloke is that girl’s, Jenny or whatever, sister, and, alright, I suppose he’s a right to be annoyed.
I lay him onto the bed, gently, and ruck his jumper up over his ribs, revealing a taut, flat stomach, with just a smattering of dark blond hair leading to his waistband.  I pepper gentle, open mouthed kisses on his ribs, plunge my tongue into his belly button, push his jumper up higher and suck one of his pink nipples.  My tongue dances across his clavicle, and, desperate for better access to more skin, I pull his jumper up, over his head.  Draco’s arms lift above him and he helps me to remove his shirt.  For a moment, I simply kneel beside him, looking at his pale, beautiful torso laid out for me like a feast.  “You’re exquisite,” I whisper, and he shudders, his wide grey eyes locked to mine.
