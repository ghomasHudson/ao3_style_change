"Is it true?" Neville whispered as he bend his head towards the group. "Did you manage to get Malfoy kicked out of school?" His eyes were glistening by utter excitement.
The wood crackled under his boots. Here and there it seemed a little bit slippery, and right before reaching the open entrance Harry almost lost his balance.
Shut it – Draco mouthed as he tried to keep his lips from curling. Harry nodded deeply, closing his eyes as he waited for the noise to ease down. After a minute or two, everything seemed to be clear again. Carried away in some kind of trance, Harry got pulled away from it once Draco removed his finger; pulling him up to join. "Where have you been?" Harry whispered; eager to kiss him. Draco partially dodged, colleting a kiss on the corner of his mouth with a smile.
'You dirty piece of shit, just blow me.'
"What happened this time?" Harry sighed as he dropped down next to Ginny. He didn't mean to offend any.
Harry lowered his pass, slowly nearing a stand, and frowned his brows by utter confusion. "Just tell me what you want from me, Malfoy. School has only just started, and you decided to contact me."
"Shh," Draco comfortably hushed as he sat down on the same bed. He drew his fingers down the sides of Harry's face, pressing his forehead against his as he held him close. "We can't," he continued with an comforting voice.
"Are you taking a piss?" Harry snarled. "Again?" He threw his head in his neck, scoffing, and turned his back on him. It felt like Draco was playing a game. What did he want from him? What were they doing anyway? He thought they were finally done with this bullshit, putting blame on each other for whatever the fuck they were doing. It became tempting to use the Obliviate spell, if not on himself.
"Come. It's too risky here."
Draco threw a glance down at him now, his eyes spitting fire as his entire head got red like a tomato by now – mostly all because of feeling incredibly shy and embarrassed.
"Ginny," Neville gasped once he made his way. Ginny fled from Harry's escape, dropping her body into Neville's arms now. Longbottom took her in, throwing Harry a pensive look before he spoke. "I think it might be better for you to leave, Harry."
Draco widened his eyes, cocking his head, frowning after. It was only then that he finally realized how something bumped against the bare skin of his abdomen.
"Shut up, you're scaring him."
"-Thanks."
"Sounds like a clever plan to me." He bit his lower lip, looking at the boy in silence before he decided to clear him out a bit. "It's evidence."
"About them hooking up?"
"Draco," Harry gasped as he took his hand. A noise came from Snape's office, causing Draco to kneel down swiftly – dragging Harry to the side behind the bookcase. His slim index finger pushed against Harry's lips; the touch of the blonde creating a pleasant raise in his heartbeat.
Draco scoffed, turning his face to have a few outside – watching the owls drift by. "You're not the victim here, Harry. You were killing me. Who's the enemy now?"
While everyone remained busy changing clothes and face painting each other with fake blood, Harry remained calm and alone in the corner of the Gryffindor common room. Hermione decided for them to dress up in a Victorian style with dashes of muggily-peeks to it, just for shits and giggles. Ronald seemed delighted by her ideas. The brown suit would match perfectly, along with wooden oak mask – making him look wise and mischievous, to his taste. Hermione, on the other hand, thought he looked silly. But since their love was tough enough as it was, she decided to leave him be and keep his stupid mask. Harry thought of keeping it plain simple. A normal black mask attached to a stick, so he didn't have to look as silly all the time – or take off his glasses. A masquerade ball. How fun it would be.
"Professor Dumbledore?" Harry called as he turned up his speed. "Professor?" He called once more, wiggling between the students that ruined his sight - as if a force didn't want them to catch up. "Professor! Professor Dumbledore!?" Harry was no longer walking. Right now he was running - pushing people to the sides as he watched Dumbledore vanish around the corner. "Professor, Wait!"
"Didn't think you would spot me."
"-Or you," Harry added rather serious. The blonde batted his eyes, squeezing his hand while a pensive expression drew along his face.
Harry shrugged – unsure to open his mouth, surprised how Hermione seemed to have forgotten the way he busted them the other night.
Hermione nearly rolled her eyes, and pulled him along at his robe, apparently not accepting the nonsense.
"You guys abandoned me, and for what?"
It had been months since Harry faced Draco. That special meeting caused some serious damage to Harry's brain, and he couldn't afford his school to suffer by it. He had more important things to put his focus to. For example, finishing many essays he'd been piling up over the weeks. Obviously he saw him once a while, at school whenever they had class together, but they never spoke – not that they ever did much. Now school was about to start again, his head became more fuzzy every minute. Malfoy haunted him in his dreams. Causing Harry to see things that weren't really there. Obscure thinking. Not quite pleasant.
Harry scoffed nervously and glanced at professor Snape who'd been listening all along and appeared to show a new kind of emotion: pity.
"I want you to touch me," Draco hissed between his teeth – feeling Harry's hands rushing along the edges of his back. "I want to finally feel you."
"I've had a rough night, really. I reckon you all know." All three nodded in silence, though Luna granted him a friendly smile. "Of course... Well, that."
Draco didn't answer. He simply flicked his tongue across his front teeth, and stared at his feet. It was obvious he was ashamed for his bruises. His father beat him to shit, and Harry wondered if this was the actual first time. "That's sick," Harry continued, scratching the back of his head. He expected Lucius to be a difficult father, but not like this. He always presumed him as a coward, and his mother as overly protective. Basically, he thought they were just a couple of spoiled brats. Draco in particular. And there he stood; the blonde, skinny Slytherin student – comparable to a smashed potato.
"Excited?" Ginny blushed as she took Hedwig's cage for a help.
Harry's legs didn't seem to understand the normal way of walking – his mind suffering from constant disruptions causing him to stop every time in a while. On his way walking past the Great Hall he interfered with various friends – leaving their concerns about Harry's disturbing appearance (tired and dirty). He scattered them away. Nothing seemed to matter. Not to him. No longer.
Draco pulled back his head so he could stare down at Harry's face, and titled his head as this twinkle appeared in his eyes.
"There you go. Wasn't that hard, now was it."
"I want to feel you," Harry suddenly squeezed out after some seconds – breathing into the blonde's ear.
"Believe what you want to believe, Potter."
"Shit," Harry hissed – closing his eyes, hooking his thumbs along the edges of Draco's pants. Are we really going to do this?
Snape raised his brows, surprised and thrilled by Harry's eager to know.
"I want you," Harry stuttered – pulling Draco's roots before he pushed up his hips, allowing Draco to get a glimpse of his physical state. Draco buried his face in his neck, biting his skin before he rubbed tight against his trousers; gasping as he closed his eyes.
Harry bit his lower lip, his forehead covered in sweat while his body stuttered. Looking up at his companion, he pulled him up close – crushing his lips firmly onto his, wanting to take him whole. He would no longer wait. His body was covered in sweat, and his muscles were aching by desire. He wanted to have him. He wanted to share his first experiences with his blonde enemy, and he wanted to cover him whole in cum.
"Harry," he started, kind as ever. "Dear boy. I know."
'You're an ass, Potter. Wait until my father hears about this.'
After having about an hour spend in his dorms, reading the advanced potion book to be at least a bit of productive, he decided to go on for a run again. Hermione and Ron were still out of sight. His fellow Gryffindors were scattered around the castle, reading, chatting, laughing and whatnot – but no piece for him. Not only did the found it hard to play of joy – knowing his two best friends were nacking on the other side of the door – but also was his head filled with questions. Where was Draco? Why did he have to leave? What was going on between them? His textbook remained resting under his elbow – his head leaning into his palm. He was daydreaming. There was nothing to put him to his homework right now. He sighed deeply, slamming the book close with great effort as he got up from his chair. There was one small opportunity of finding Draco, if he was still around. And that would be the room of requirements, where he could remain hidden and undisturbed. Great exhaustion hit him as he made his first steps. Seamus waved at him, showing his care as he stumbled; yet Harry waved it away. Smiling gratefully, he made his way towards the door. His feet were heavy – almost swollen it seemed, and for a moment he considered going to sleep already. After a slow turn, scanning the common room, seeing all those pretty faces having fun, he decided not to go to bed just yet. Not because he was afraid he would be held awake by the noise, but also because he wanted to find the same joy as they did. Wondering where his "former" friends would be, he made his leave.
Draco couldn't finish his sentence. Harry already placed his lips upon the skin just above his bellybutton, and a stream of warm shivers ran down his spine. His lower lip began to tremble immediately, and he gazed down – almost squeezing his eyes entirely shut by nervousness.
"You ruined me," Draco almost shouted as he clenched his fists. "You made me feel like utter shit!"
Harry placed his wand on the floor, lifting his arms once more before he kicked it away as well – leaving himself defenceless. "Feel any better now?"
"Like you actually care," Draco smirked. "He minds everything." Harry couldn't keep himself from smirking too, and buried his lips in Draco his neck as well– sucking his skin softly while making his way down. Draco sank his fingertips into Harry his back, scratching his nails over his skin until red, slightly burning stripes revealed themselves in the shuttering light of the reflecting candles that illuminated at the entrance. Harry clenched his teeth now, trying not to groan as soon as Draco pressed his teeth into the skin of his chest, and he opened his eyes on a crack to gaze at his body – just realizing how hot he looked while wearing his tie but no shirt. He gasped now, sheaving his hand into the back pockets from Draco his pants, and couldn't keep himself from squeezing his ass. A gasp came from Draco's throat, and he threw his head in his neck, not being able to hold back a moan now as soon as Harry started to move the tip of his tongue along his bare chest.
"Come for me," Draco groaned – their foreheads touching. Harry looked up at him, his eyes merely opened; his body trembling under his touch, his nails digging down into Draco's back. "I will," Harry managed to stuttered as he blew his load – his cum covering the both of them. Draco kissed him, biting down his lower lip until he bled, and he came; their shimmering, porcelain bodies sticking together.
"Makes you irresponsible." Draco scoffed. "I am the chosen one. Me! Yet you get the credit."
They drove the entire way through the hills with their eyes heavy. Though Ron tried his upper best to impress the blonde, only a couple of giggles managed to escape the girl's throat before she left to meet her friends a few cabins away. Hermione was reading, her eyebrows wrinkled like they were used to whenever she was concentrated – and Ron fell asleep as soon as he neatly planted his head against the window.
"I slept fine," the blonde replied, showing off his gums – no longer wielding the innocence of a child. "Did you?"
Draco hopped away in a rush once Snape released him from his deadly hands. His back was covered in cold sweat, and if he could, he would've vanished from school right away. He wanted to leave. Leave Hogwarts, leave his family. For a single second he wished to change his life for another's. A muggleborn even. Rubbing his arms he thought of those who touched him there. Harry, sleeping against him that night in the room of requirements. His hands were sweaty, and yet if he could, he would've done it all over again. He was crying. His hair was a mess, and his shirt stuck to his sweaty back – leaving him uncomfortable, cold and itchy. Running down the stone steps to reach the Slytherin common room, he cursed under his breath – pulling the roots of his hair. No matter, as a prayer being heard, someone stood waiting down the entrance – sad and defeated. Small.
"Dude." Harry gave him a punch. "Stop swooning."
"Just a few more days, Harry," Ron comforted him, nuzzling himself under his fine sheets. "You're not really talkative, Harry. Are you okay?"
"Can I have this dance?"
"There must be some way, right?" Harry looked at the both of them in fear. "I mean, you've said it before. With the Voldemort... There must be some-"
Harry clenched his teeth as he loosened his tie, opening the first button of his shirt after. He snorted as well. The alcohol was draining his energy. "What are we looking for?" In some large steps he stood next to Draco behind the desk, and sank through his knees as well to look at the drawer just like Draco did.
Harry pulled back slightly questioning now – searching for Draco his eyes as he snorted.
Ron didn't respond, probably way too chicken to tell his friend about his love for her. Ridiculous, really, since it had been obvious for quite some time now. Ron bowed his head, ashamed – knowing he knew too.
Harry shoved his hands over the wooden floor now, piling up all the buttons by this, and as soon as he held them all in one hand, he turned – while still crouching – toward the desk, seeing how Draco leaned against the desk basically in front of him. Without getting up, Harry placed the buttons on the desk – not ripping his eyes from the blonde's appearance just yet. It might have looked frightening a bit. Draco frowned, though he still lightly smiled, and tilted his head as he gazed down at Harry now, wondering what he was doing.
"It was Malfoy," he stated.
"No," Draco replied sharply as he turned his back. "Good luck with finding your way back up that chimney, Santa." And he vanished outside, joining his father to make Mister Borgin crap himself.
"Snape has his custody while he's at school. I bet he told him." Her eyes widened. "Don't tell me you have anything to do with that!"
'Did mommy never tell you it's rude to touch other their stuff without asking, Potter?'
Harry looked up at the ceiling – only now noticing he'd lost his glasses along the way. "Dunno," he answered, "did you sleep well?"
"Fuck off," Draco scowled – his fist hitting the wooden wall behind him. "I'm so fucking done with your bullshit. Why you? You aren't special. Yes, you survived, but in return you allowed your friends to die. That's not legendary. It's fucking selfish, and I'm done with the praising."
Grabbing his blouse and cardigan, he rushed himself towards the exit. Leaving Malfoy for "dead". He wished to see the looks on his fellow student's faces. If anyone had been celebrating his absence – Draco Malfoy clearly not being one of them – he was ready to cut it off now. Making his way towards his dorms – trying his best to stay unseen for as many as he could – he quickly changed to a new shirt, leaving his cardigan to rest on his bed. Malfoy's smell still lingered around him – and the cardigan wearing him would enlarge it. Dizzy by his scent, he wobbled towards the great hall – ready to meet his mates.
"I don't understand," Harry muttered as his eyes went heavy.
"What are you implying? What do you mean?"
Snape looked outside the windows in silence. This lasted for about ten seconds before he finally replied without turning.
Draco frowned as he moved back a bit, trying to ignore the taste of Harry's blood on his tongue, and apparently pretended to hate him again because of the way he tried to change his expression so rapidly at seeing him. As if he just realized it was actually Harry Potter he'd been kissing, and not some girl from the same house as he was in. 'What?'
"This is the hide out," Harry remarked once he walked further. "I've been here before, once. Don't bother to ask me, I don't remember."
At that very moment Harry tripped - losing his glasses, his view turning black. For a couple of seconds it felt like he could no longer breathe. His ears were deafened. He drew his hands along the floor, reaching for his glasses - gasping in panic as soon as he found them, realizing something took a hold of him.
Harry took a shower later that evening. His nose was a mess, having his third nosebleed today, but he couldn't bother – knowing the weather was awfully unpleasant. His head hurt all afternoon, and the burning sensation caused his lips to tingle, and Malfoy his words crept through his mind like a snake he was. You ruined me, it echoed through the bathroom – as if the walls could speak, and the water transported the sound waves. His voice low, and vibrating through every limp. Brushing his flattened hand through his sleeky, wetted hair, he pursed his lips as his back touched the cold tiles behind him. His eyes were closed. Thinking about his upcoming year, he frowned his brows – his body shuddering by the cold. Hermione told him to take a break after looking rather pale all day. Hardly ever freely to find her ideas most useful, he finally felt righteous to say so. Taking a shower allowed his muscles to find some ease, and to clear his mind from unwanted fantasies about his white-haired fellow student. His vision blurry, and his ears overwhelmed, he brushed his fingers down his lips – finding a pleasant taste on his tongue. Though he hardly allowed dirty fantasies to trail through his head, he sighed at a recognizable scent – matching Draco's skin.
"Oh, good, getting impatient there Potter. I see..."
Ginny got up, knocking over her cup of tea. "I saw you with him! Stop playing me!" Her eyes burned with tears, turning Harry's heart heavy.
"It's your burden," Draco replied surprisingly clam – though his teeth were on edge. "I simply hope they'll see what kind of fraud you are."
"How comes?"
'Fuck,' Draco cursed – but not because he didn't liked it. That was after all what it was all about. He liked it way too much than he actually should.
"I like it," she continued. "It looks sexy on you."
"I said GO!" Harry growled as he jumped up, grabbing his wand to point it at the bed. Harry fell to his knees, grabbing the edge of his bed as he cried – knowing no one was there.
Once their kiss made it to an end, they both stumbled back – the backs of their hands brushing along their lips, wiping off each other's saliva. Draco looked at him, his eyes spitting fire – as if Harry was to blame, and he didn't like it. Harry avoided any eye contact. Though their kiss was short but firm, he felt rather ashamed – no matter the sweetness of Draco's lips, and the secret desire for more.
"Tell me, Harry," Dumbledore started as he folded his hands. "What has been going on lately?"
"I said: take it off."
Harry bit the inside of his lip, shaking his head - his eyes hurting. Flinching once he saw a group of students walking closer from a distance. Draco turned his head - only a bit - to get a glimpse from within the corners of his eyes and slowly stepped back as he touched the bark of the tree he'd been lingering in.
Draco scoffed, merely offended, and leaned against the wall while looking at his partner in crime.
"I'm perfectly fine," Harry replied after he sighed. He threw her a look. "Don't you have to study?"
Harry strongly avoided any eye contact. He didn't know why, but it seemed for the best. He could already sense the tension between the two of them. "That was a mistake," Harry muttered. "Only to mock you."
"Fuck," he moaned, arching his back. "M-... Malfoy, I'm..."
"Rather suspicious, no? My father needs me at his meetings. I can't escape that."
The both of them ended at the entrance of professor Dumbledore's office without sharing another word. Once their presence was accepted they led themselves in - Snape deciding to linger near the doorway, gesturing Harry to go further in. Professor Dumbledore stood at the pensieve. He held his eyes closed as he slightly leaned over - looking up once Snape had introduced the both of them with his penetrating voice.
"Fuck you," Harry cursed as he kicked with his feet. "Get off of me."
"Always," Harry replied – shoving his glass away to lean onto the table at last. He sighted.
"And you, Ginny? Found a lover?"
'Calm your tits,' Harry grinned. 'now enjoy...'
Harry covered his face as chunks of stone clattered through the hall, and he fell to his knees as he heard someone approaching – heels rattling against the cobblestone floor. Harry cried, looking down at his hands in shock – his body shivering by fear. The person approaching him in rapid speed appeared to be Professor Snape, as if he was destined to be seen by the worst teacher at school.
An unlit cauldron sat in the center of the altar. A ceremonial athame knife rested on the left and to the right Andromeda had placed her wand; oak, firm with a core for unicorn hair. Five unlit candles framed the table.
Sheryl laughed, the tension had left her shoulders. Slapping Draco on the back, she exclaimed, “Hari cub, I like your man. When you are both of age come share a pint with me. First round’s on me.”
The first rotation they asked for acceptance, with the second rotation they asked to be protected, and for the third they asked to be cleansed.
I found out what Fluffy was. Fluffy is a Cerberus, a giant three headed dog.
The giant snake slowly raised its head to peer up at Harry. It tilted its head almost like a puppy, flicking its tongue out inquizetly. Harry was startled the boa hadn't bothered to move when the others were near, just when it was alone with Harry.
Harry had to go up against Terence Higgs as Seeker. I didn't know much about him, but standing next to Harry he seemed huge. I didn't care about the game only I only wanted to watch Harry flying. He's a natural. I saw the moment he honed in on the snitch. The problem was so did Higgs. Then Marcus Flint interfered, and cost Slytherin's penalty points.
To the Minister of Magic, Chief Warlock, and the Esteem Members of the Wizengamot,
Draco wrinkled his brow. He knew that Hari felt uncomfortable in formal dress robes, like the funeral they went to today, but Hari did look stunning. So he thought he could get Hari to dress up once more today. For old friends, like Alice and Sheryl. "So, I don't see any problem with getting dressed up and getting drunk after the day I had."
He didn't know whose the baby was, and as long as it wasn't Potter's secret love child with Weaslette Draco would even admit that the baby was adorable, too. Even if Potter was practicing hair color treatments on it. Then he blinked long and hard when the baby's hair sudden changed from bright turquoise to soft lavender. '
"Fine, the gamekeeper," Draco audibly fought down a snarl. "or professor" Draco relented, "would be wrong by current definitions. He was referring to the "just-one-drop rule", which is a double-edged sword, I guess you can say. Just one drop of muggle blood taints you. But the definition has broadened."
“Not anymore”, Draco growled, because 'hey he only just presented he cannot be expected to control his instincts'. “You are dismissed”. If he was a little testy, it’s because his rut isn’t going to be over for another twenty-four hours. Their plan was forced to move up a whole day, but his mother was always one who thought on her feet.
So readers, how about it. Throw out a few ideas you would like to see happen, and I'll fit them in. Sound good?
Draco was sitting on the couch, both legs curled in for comfort, while Hari sat stretched out on the floor between the couch and coffee table. Draco had to reach over Hari to get to the depleting bottles of alcohol. Draco went to reach for the last of the firewhiskey, missing it completely. Hari in his own drunken state, found this immensely funny.
Hari had believed that Dudley wasn't the sharpest drill bit in his uncles tool chest, but he knew what "school" and "classmate" meant when it referred to Hari.
“Ha, Potter you have a special named after you, you must be a regular then.” Turning to Sheryl, trying to spare Hari the pointless argument, “Ma’am, I’ll have the Harry Potter Special, please.”
“It’s not that, I…” Hari tried. Draco took a breath through his nose and let it out his mouth. He tried to gentle his touch as he grabbed Hari’s arm to guide him to sit down in an armchair. He kneeled at Hari’s feet and pulled up his sleeve to show Hari his arm. Freshly healed, with the old scars crisscrossing the Dark Mark. “I wasn’t trying to kill myself, earlier. I know how you feel about death. Certain feelings just swim to the surface sometimes and it’s something I do to stop the itch… I was thinking…” He let out a humorless laugh.
On the inside Draco was cursing himself. His alpha just had to have the taste of the forbidden and his body was paying the price. The moment he pressed his lips against Harry's a slight tingling sensation started at the point of contact, then as he deepened the kiss, the tingling intensified to an icy hot burn, forcing him to relinquish his hold. His lips blue with cold, the forbidden taste of snow on his tongue. Draco wiped at his lips trying to hide the color, as he shivered as icy shards raced through his blood, his libido instantly died, and his alpha dragon immediately backed down in defeat. Embarrassed at his actions and wanting a quick retreat, be brushed passed Harry, but not before remembering he was supposed to thank Harry for inviting them to live at Grimmauld Place. Hoarsely getting out his thanks, he fled up the two steps to the patio terrace.
and short black and white leather striped mini skirt. An ermine mock neck cape draped over the manikin that would hover over his shoulder blades, leaving a strip of skin showing on his front and teased in the back.
Hari and Draco sped through the streets of London on a black motorbike, dipping and swerving around heavy traffic that would make any Quidditch star proud.  It was not even one o’clock in the afternoon and the two teens had only one destination in mind; lunch. Hari promised Draco excellent food at his favorite Muggle restaurant. Hari was very nervous about bringing Draco Malfoy to his favorite place to eat, because well he was Malfoy after all. He probably would be a prat anywhere he went. So he tried to warn Draco ahead of time, by requesting a few things of him. The first being he didn’t say negative to the waitstaff, secondly he didn’t gawk or give nasty looks to the waitstaff or the customers, and thirdly he requested Draco not, under any circumstances, tell the owner that Hari called him a princess in such a derogatory way. Draco being his old vexing self, said he couldn’t, more like wouldn’t make any promises, because he was visiting a Muggle establishment; after all, what if he got food poisoning? Hari’s response; “You’ll likely get food poisoning if you kept it up.”
"You are so going to regret this conversation tomorrow, Dray. Guaranteed. Okay, I'll make all your decisions for now on. The first one getting you to bed. Now put one foot in front of the other. Stand up."
The vast majority of the time it just got him in trouble, like today. But sometimes it was helpful, like the vase his cousin had broken while infamously "Harry hunting", he found in the attic while spring cleaning two summers ago, whole once more. Or the numerous times his broken bones mended and his bruises disappeared after a particular nasty beating.
And guess what?
And so breathing in the waking morning, he let out a deep tense releasing breath.
Hari chuckled, "Maybe just the middle name then." Hari decided.

As Andromeda left, she glanced up, but Draco and Hari were already absorbed in Teddy. Hari was trying to get Draco to change the nappy. Draco was having none of it. “And have him wee on me, again Hari? I think not.” Draco exclaimed loudly.
But when Draco glanced up, the look he gave Hari was nothing short of a predator on the hunt and Hari was the prey. He smirked, “Like what you see?” He asked with a rasp to his voice. So saying, Draco grabbed Hari’s hand in his hair, securing him there as he swooped down to pop the head back in his mouth.
Draco apparated onto the stoop and they entered. A shadow moved out of the shadow of the drawing room. Narcissa was waiting for them with toe tapping, arms crossed irritation on her face. It visibly turned to confusion and then resign. With a sigh she said, "Just get to bed."
“San Francisco?” Dudley asked, referring to yet another city in America with a high LGBTQ community. Instead of a cuff to the back of the head that earned him a ruffling of the blond hair on Dudley’s head.
"I didn't know I was dating such a romantic." Hari grumbled. "We celebrated Litha with his family."
She had to consult the Book again and see if it gave her any clues as to were he might have turned up. Then...
“My laces.” He exclaimed, as he ducked out of his mother’s light touch on his shoulder. Then he took advantage of the crowd of patrons and travelers wanting the barkeep's attention for rooms or food or ale. He didn’t expect the push of the crowd, but he managed to get to the door opposite the wixen entrance.
“Okay, Teddy. My name is...Draco!” Draco said, deepening his voice, and moving the puppet around in a stiff box position.
“Do you swear to respect  the wizarding traditions of the two Houses, to the best of your abilities?” Andromeda asked.
Reaching the fourth floor landing, Hari was able to stumble Draco into his room. He was glad that Draco's room was right next to the stairs, and so they didn't have to take the long trek down the hall.
Draco thought as he continued his agonizing and delightful exploration of Hari's body with just his fingertips.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn't worried about the man's gruff nature, even with the scowl, Harry could see the ready laugh lines around the mouth and eyes. The expression so much different than his aunt, uncle, and cousin's.
A hand on Draco's jaw drew his gaze down to stare into Hari's emerald eyes, though glass stained with splatters of dried tears. "May I see them? Your scars?"
The final notes faded away, and Harry’s voice broke off at the end on a sob. When will the tears end? There was a creaking noise behind him and a soft unfamiliar voice speaking to him from behind.
Schooling his expression into a solom mask, he said "Nothing, nothing..."
“Is that all his letter says, then?” Hari inquired. Draco tilted the parchment so they both could read the surprisingly brief letter together:
Draco's eyes sprung open, "Try? Try what?”
The five of them looked on at the bright fire in the middle of their lawn. The sound of insects, and crackling wood filled the air. In their own private sanctuary, they could not hear or see evidence of the Muggle World.
He was once more in his cupboard, his reprieve at the zoo a short lived one. He heard his aunt talking frantically on the phone from the kitchen. Pacing, but prevented from moving very far due to being tethered to the wall. She sounded pissed. Not just livid, but drunk as well. This cannot be good. Aunt Petunia has never drunk out of control like this.
“Fine,” he mumbled. “But I better not see any more blue body parts, You hear!?” Hari said scrambling up, but hesitated.
Dear journal,
A beautiful tale fitting a beautiful dragon.
The music stopped, the lights dimmed then flashed twice. The DJ got on the mic, "Welcome, welcome fellow Broncos, to Yas! Night!"
“Yes! Wait. What?” Draco was so ready to accept whatever idea Hari’s brain jumped to that he was completely thrown by the unfamiliar term—“boyfriend’s shirt?”
"The name's Trout." The grey man says.
Draco could see that Hari was apprehensive about being outside the restaurant, and his nervousness was making him nervous. Hari was so happy to show Draco this place earlier.
“I don’t really care where we go, as long as you give me a chance. Please!”
Draco didn’t dare go higher. He didn’t know how high the enchantment went, and he didn’t want to be spotted from the air by those metal flying machines, or below by the occasional passerby. Not that he believed many Muggles were out during this predawn hour.
“Somehow, I forgot how depressing this place is.” Hari whispered as he rested his brow against the filthy wall unthinkably. Draco followed Hari.
"What is the meaning of his Harry, why am I barred from entry?" Kingsley booming voice came from the fireplace.
He remembered Hari shyly trying on each and every one of these clothes for Draco’s appraisal. He remembered Hari’s flush of pleasure at Draco's open stares.
If it wasn't the Weasley's, then who is abusing Harry Potter? Harry should be the most cherished person in the whole wizarding world, but someone at "home" is abusing him.
Once Hari left with Draco, Narcissa entered the room. “Minerva always said they were the worst kind of Muggles imaginable.” Andromeda told her sister. Narcissa stood with one hand over her mouth and tears glistening in her eyes. Even with being the Chosen One, Narcissa never knew the extent of the abuse that Hari had gone through in his life.
“Go on.” Narcissa prompted.
Hari seeing that Bill wasn’t looking at him but over his shoulder at Draco, who he believed with no doubt was silently taunting him. He’ll lay into Draco later. Bill was his friend, he wasn’t going break all ties with him over something that he very much wanted to keep in the past. It was time to drill his point home. Snapped his fingers in Bills face to get his attention once more. “Again what about Teddy, doesn’t he deserve a bit of normalcy, doesn’t he deserve to have a family? Remus made me Teddy’s godfather, which makes him my family. Narcissa and Draco Malfoy are Teddy’s only other living relatives beside his grandmother. They are his family. They have every right to be in his life as I.” Hari leaned heavily on this guilt card. He had to put an end to this; all Malfoy’s are evil, nonsense. Bills anger was slowly dispersing, Hari could see that, but he had let Bill know that he didn’t want to hear any more of this argument. So he’d address all points.
Lost in Draco’s heat, he lifted his hips off the bed. His cock disappeared deeper into Draco’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat with no resistance.
Draco suddenly grinned wickedly, “It’s no worries. After all, it’s not like my dick froze off.”
The owner/employee sighed through his nose, his hand coming up to his face to rub beneath amber eyes that had dark circles beneath. "Come on in." The stranger said in that raspy deep voice of his. As he turned, Harry could see a slight peppering of gray mixed into his hair, so light you could only catch it in the right light.
There was a wetness there Hari couldn’t explain.
"I've never had to question my blood status." Draco said sharply sitting up, resting one ankle beneath the knee of the other on his side. Hari sat up cross legged a look of frustration on his face. "Half-breeds are different than a creatures inheritance. They cannot glamour or hide or suppress their creatures appearance at all. While, I and others like my family, can." Draco let out a long breath through his nose to stop his rising ire. He rubbed a frustrated hand through his hair.
“Oh, I must show you, it's magnifique.” Then she called for Dot. The tiny fashionista of a house-elf popped into view, dust whooshing into the air causing Draco to sneeze. “Dot, go to the floo in the parlour and create a connection between this fireplace and that one.” Dot popped away with a happy squeal of her own.
“Considering, that’s the direction I want our relationship to go? No, I don’t mind.”
Sheryl broke into a peels of laughter. "Not everyone has too if its not their thing, cub." Hari scowled. At Hari's put out expression, Draco smirked. Drag might not be his thing, but he looked amazing tonight.
“Is there other holidays you miss out on?” Hari said.
At Draco’s confused frown, Narcissa sighed. “If you want to be more affectionate in your courtship with Hari, as I well know you will be, you’ll have to ask his permission. Test the water’s. Ask for a kiss, to hold his hand, to put your arms around him. He’ll need to ask as well. With consent, these things are not out of the realms of possibility while he is still under eighteen. Sex is still off the table, you know.”
Mr. Dudley called over a worker, a pimply faced redhead teen out of his league. He kept rifling through a pamphlet stammering and finally getting on the radio to call maintenance and a supervisor at the enraged purple faced man screaming in his face, making threats.
"What what, Potter?" Draco said quietly between clenched teeth.
Draco was in a stupor, with the last breath of her testimony Narcissa was pleading with the Juriors, not for herself but for him. He didn’t dare look up afraid of what he’d see in the Wizengamot. Would they be in awe, as he was? Would they be disapproving, as if it was Draco’s plan for his mother to speak on his behalf? Draco definitely did not have his Malfoy face on as he clenched his fists shackled to the arms of his chair, head bowed and eyes tightly shut trying to stay the tears that drenched his cheeks.
Looking up through a fringe of pale strands, Draco shrugged while answering. "Fine. Drained mostly. Empty. Honestly, I don't know why I reacted that way. I witnessed him get Kissed. You weren't there. He was acting crazy, shouting, ranting, alive, then... gone. He was just gone. And I was relieved. The man who abused me, us, my mother and I couldn't hurt us. And...and it was his fault for all of it. For being on the wrong side, for forcing this," Draco held up his Marked arm. "...on me."
The mood in the room was completely changed. The hostility was gone between Draco and Bill. Bill was a bit wary of Draco’s intentions. He had a feeling that Hari could be too naïve about somethings, especially Draco’s apparent attraction to him.
Harry, Granger, and Longbottom were caught out of bed last night and also had to serve detention with me.    Of all the people to be stuck with, why was Longbottom even serving detention with us. He wasn't even in on the whole baby dragon business. What was he doing out of bed?
Stay Awesome!
All their nagging and worried looks didn’t reassure him in the least. As if he didn’t have enough to worry about. He had no problem getting ill-timed erections, it was finding the relief that came to be the problem. It was easier to wither the flower than gather the pollen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hari heard the sound of the Floo in the other room.
“Boyfriend?” Draco tried for casual, his heart racing.
Returning to Sheryl’s Place brought back a lot of unexpected emotions. The first time Hari visited this side of London, he was secretly in awe of the place and the boldness of the people who walked around in broad daylight. It was the first time that Hari was ever allowed to venture outside Little Whinging, Surrey, so he was in awe of a lot of sights that day. His Uncle Vernon, of whom he and his cousin Dudley were accompanying on a business venture, didn’t feel the same way. In fact, when they passed the neighborhood, they gave that side of the street a large hearth.
At noon they offered a portion of their food and blessed the day they lived in. Nothing fancy. It was a mellow day, near perfect with white puffy clouds instead of the dreary gray ski he was used to. Not too cold.

"Why I never heard of a man willingly offer to change a dirty diaper before. Alright then, but don't say I didn't give you amp reason to back out." She giggled like a school girl as she carefully explained to Harry how to change his godson's dirty diaper. And Harry listened very carefully, as if he was learning a very dangerous spell in school.
Something has to be done.
“No Bernard, Hari won. Just discovered I’ve been spelling the cubs name wrong all this time, is all.” Sheryl called back over her broad muscular shoulders, not bother turning away from the task.
(See the end of the chapter for
. It only goes back, five, maybe six generations. Who knows what level of 'purity' go beyond that. Because of this, we don't know who the ancestor was that first introduced creature's blood, but look here."
Harry hesitated a moment before answering, "Dudley." It was the first name that came to mind.
Hari's hair was not the usual unruly mop. Instead, the hair was brushed smooth and shiny, and slightly mussed as he pulled over a silk slip of some kind over his hair that danced with the florescent lights.
Victor Hugo once said "History has its truth, and so has legend. Legendary truth is of another nature than historical truth. Legendary truth is invention whose result is reality. Furthermore, history and legend have the same goal; to depict eternal man beneath momentary man."
"Yes," Blaise drawled out. "Draco is a real hero, but I have to go now. Living in the Muggle world keeps mother and I safe from anti-Death Eaters but I don't stay out in the stench of public too long. Besides, that weird pixie girl with spikey blue streaked hair has been hovering on the outskirts of the privacy bubble. I think she recognizes one of us."
Draco smiled uneasily at Teddy, who seemed to stare right through him. “He doesn’t seem to know what to think of me, he keeps staring.”
“Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, you will not be serving a life sentence in Azkaban. It is clear that you have a flair for escaping justice, so instead this courtroom has taken your own testimony into account, you will be subjected to the Dementors kiss, an act worse than death, active immediately.” The double doors at the end of the chamber opened, and a Dementor bookended by two full Patronuses, one eagle and one dove.
The topic he was about to broach with Hari was
” You cocky son of a bitch. You know and yet you…"
However, Hari clearly didn't know about the creature inheritance, which means he would not be able to enter into a proper courtship until Hari's eighteenth birthday. If he presents as anything other than beta, telling him would be a moot point, because then his own creatures’ blood would reveal itself. Or if he is simply beta, by that point, the
Did he imagine the sound? The sound came again. Draco rolled again, eyes swirling with colors absorbing the black pupils of his eyes, and a growl erupted from his throat.
"BOY!" Her husband scream from the upstairs bedroom that shook the floorboards. Before she heard the sound of his heavy tread on the ceiling.
Draco jammed his pointer and middle finger into Potter’s hole to the last knuckle, ruthlessly. Potter’s back arched off the wet tiles, breathing in on a breathless scream, “huh-ahg!” Draco pulled his fingers out again, before just as with his tongue, jabbed them in as hard and far as he could. Potter was groaning and whimpering in protest, “nnh, ugg, no, no!” Draco opened and closed his fingers, scissoring his fingers around, before curling them, searching, searching…
Hari was impressed by the cleanliness of Hari’s room, remembering the earlier state it had been in just this morning.
“Hari, here dreamt Draco was a...dragon?” Narcissa sat her bundle down with a clatter on the table, one hand raised to her mouth in astoundment.
"Up! Get Up! Now!" BANG. BANG. BANG. Harry was startled awake by his aunt Petunia's shrill voice. He stared groggily up at the underside of the stairs from the tiny cott in the tiny broom cupboard. As far as he knew he lived under these stairs for nearly ten years, ever since the death of his parents in a fatal car crash.
"What du yeh mean, naw 'ere?" Hagrid asked a dark thundercloud darkening his face.
***Hari’s Flashback Age 7***
So entranced were both Hari and Draco by each other; unconsciously, they were drawn together like opposite charged magnets until they were inches apart.
"I believe you Andromeda, Mrs. Malfoy saved my life. I believe people can change some, not completely, but some. It takes a lot to change a lifetime of prejustice." Harry confessed. "I want to save your sister and nephew, but what can I do?"
“I should think you’d be used to it by now.” Hari scoffed, glancing over his shoulder. Candice had joined her fellow associate at the cash register. They huddled closer together, whispering with eyes on them. They flipped their hair, straightened their clothes, and thrust out their chest flirtatiously. Hari frowned at their display and glance up to note Draco also had eyes on the birds. His frown deepened.
"I understand that the bank has issued an eviction notice for the residence of this property. On two separate occasion an employee of the bank has stopped by only to be informed by the neighbors that the owners had left in a hurry in the middle of the night. Now my partner and I are escorting a locksmith and this bank employee to change the locks on all the doors. Unless you can give me proof of residence this instance we will have to ask you to leave or arrest you for illegal squatting."
It was the messy haired Muggle again.
"What feelings?" Sirius said in confusion.
Harry goes to the zoo.
The two Malfoy's, mother and son, stood slightly apart from the cortège of mourners gathered in the early dawn on the seventh of May. It has only been six days since the Battle of Hogwarts ended and the families of the dead gathered to pay their final respects of two young lives ended too soon. The first grave was that of Vincent Crabbe, the pine box being lowered into the earth, empty; the remains of his body unrecognizable amongst the ashes and carnage wrought by fiendfyre. The second grave was of Gregory Goyle who committed suicide the following day.
"When I was seven, I wanted a book from Flourish & Blotts. It was a very popular children's illustrated book that everyone I knew was talking about it. It was about the most famous wizarding child.
Mildly insulted, Hari came up with a flippy come back, "would you rather sleep on the same floor as you mommy?" Just to spite him. Draco only huffed and grumbled. "in a much smaller and cramped living space?' That quieted Draco up really quick. Satisfied with Draco's response. Hari explained, "This was the easier solution I could come up with, you wouldn't want your mother or aunt to have to walk up all these flights of stairs would you?"
Draco held his breath.
After paying fourteen galleons for both his and his mother’s wands, he waited for Hari to find out if his old wand could be repaired. Mr. Ollivander explained that the core’s magic was lost forever, “Although the Elder Wand was indeed able to repair your wand, the magic is no longer there as Fawkes burnt his final 100 yearlong cycle and passed into the Realm of the Gods for good. You see, the Phoenix has a unique bond with their feathers and that is why when they die, so too does the magic of its feathers. I am sorry Mr. Potter you’ll need a new wand.”
"Mad," Draco supplied.
Andromeda walked to Hari and Draco, Narcissa close behind. “What was that you tossed into the bonfire, corbeau?”
“Narcissa?” Draco was thoroughly confused, ‘first name basis, did the Prosecutor know his mother?’
Wrapping a towel around his own hips and another hanging off his neck, Draco stepped to the sink vanity to apply skin lotion to his face, and scented drying powder to his skin, and sleekeazy hair potion in his hair. Before he was done, Hari was already stepping out of the shower, skin a rosy pink over tanned skin. He had the same wrinkled towel from the floor as before he got in. He stepped up to the other sink that shared the same vanity, still dripping wet. Draco stood momentarily transfixed as water droplets ran over tanned skin speckled with white scars over his torso.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Draco didn’t hesitate. He adjusted his body, relaxed his throat and jaw, and took it.
The orgasm hit like a sucker punch in Hari’s solar plexus. His release was so sudden, he couldn’t warn Draco if he wanted to. His bullocks tightened and rose high against his body; his cock swelled and exploded.
“You wouldn’t.” Sirius said, but his voice was edged with panic.
“Now Draco, don’t act like a prepubescent boy. We took precaution; it would have been disastrous, if I fell pregnant while at Hogwarts, after all. I could have been expelled or my families name tarnished. The Malfoy’s could have called off the wedding; the legitimacy of any children at stake if they thought I didn’t come to the wedding beds a virgin. ”
“You honestly think I’ll be invited back, after what I’ve done?” Draco asked incredulously.
Hari didn’t mind the new company he kept, Sheryl like the mama bear she claimed to be, kept the predators at bay. Every now and then she let a few harmless flirts try their luck at catching the teen’s eye. The boy clearly wasn't interested, but still she teased, and he waved the comments off good naturedly, until the day he didn’t and never returned.
There was just too many parallels with Draco and Narcissa wand cores being brothers and Hari's and Lily's wand being brothers.
A ways of away, or at least he hoped it was he stumbled past a alley and his shirt was yanked once more by the collar. At this rate his shirt would be stretched past
Stepping up off the street, Harry watched as magically 11 and 13 Grimmauld Place were shoved out of the way and a five story townhouse, with soot covered brick walls, and moth eaten curtains appeared out of thin air.
“I don’t think Slytherin-ness has anything to do with it. It was the best idea she could think of, but now...they might be stuck forgetting their daughter altogether.”
At the bar, a woman, no doubt a hag, ordered raw liver delivered to her room.
All around this chaos and madness
Hari’s Muggle relatives were both physically and mentally abusive to him. It is not such a far stretch to assume they berated him, as well. Suddenly Hari’s awkward demeanor, modesty, and lack self-worth made sense. Draco wanted to track down those no-good-Muggles and crush their bodies as they’ve tried to crush his Hari’s spirit.
Draco now looked apprehensively at his arch nemesis, the albino peacock, Earl. Many people would have believed it was Harry Potter, but no. He sighed in defeat. He really couldn't deny his mother this one happiness. So, he complied with her wishes, only getting pecked thrice in the processes.
A chuckle was the immediate response. “Hari I wanted to talk.”
Hari was impressed and as such felt equally challenged to do the same. Zipping around the yard, zig-zagging around trees and shooting straight up into the air and diving in a spiral. When he zipped around Draco’s stunned form and braked hard causing him to whip around in a half circle before breaking mid-flight.
Suddenly Hari had enough, “Why do you look a gift horse in the mouth?”
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
"Hmm...I used that salve fifth year." He said flashing his
"Ss...sor...sorry Dray!" Hari stammered out as he rushed out of the bathroom, embarrassed and grateful that he hadn't had to go number two or did something undignified, like fart.
Hari leaned into him excitedly. "That was good, right Draco?"
Hari slowed to a stop, serving around an older black gentleman in his green station wagon, to squeeze onto the sidewalk, reserved parking for motorbikes and scooters, and a block away from the Leaky Cauldron. Hari put a hand on Draco’s shoulder briefly to stop him from walking onward. “Look Mal…Draco, I gain enough unwanted attention as is with the whole war thing,” Hari flipped off his fame as if saving the world was no big deal, “and I’d rather not go in their without my cloak, but I know they are very hostile towards you.” Hari seemed to be struggling with himself.  He held out some type of silken cloak. Draco raised one eyebrow at the odd offerings. “Take my cloak and if we get separated meet me at Ollivander’s”
"But surely, Narcissa didn't marry your father until after she presented--
Vernon, had only screamed red faced, "Drop the boy off at an orphanage, I cannot be expected to feed another mouth in this house!". He then left for work.
Ginny, now...was brilliant; like a firecracker, bold and bright. She took Gryffindor to their win of the House cup. She soothed the wild beast in his chest sixth year. They had so much history. And being with her was comfortable and...that was all. He realized now that he could only ever see her as a friend and little sister, Ron’s if not his own.
He gave the garment an experimental sniff before recoiling with a grimace on his face. Throwing down the offensive piece of clothing, Hari looked around at the mess of his room. The contents of his school trunk were sprawled around the room, mostly junk, including old and forgotten school supplies such as books, crumpled parchment, broken quill tips, shattered inkwells, and empty chocolate frog boxes. Considering Hari’s trunk wasn't multi-compartmental and he’d never used any shrinking charms, it was difficult to believe how much junk—he meant stuff—had actually fit in it.
"Ssh...ssh, its alright Teddy Bear, its alright!" Miracles of miracles, Teddy quieted down, curious of the stranger holding him. Only a month old, Teddy was colorblind still, and had no control of the color his eyes or hair changed. spit bubbles emerging, Teddy's hair was now a deep fuschia color, and eyes a sickly pink-eye color.
“Clothes.” Hari said with a shrug. “And what did you all add to the bonfire.”
"No, no, he's participating in a Duel Championships and besides, he needs to finish his lesson plans. I'll send Hagrid, I can grant him temporarily use of magic while looking for the dear lost boy; after all, I am Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot."
Hari didn’t respond, but Draco could feel the tense muscles of Hari’s back and smell the faint taint of fear on Hari’s skin. “Are you breaking up with me, then?”
"Understandable officer, I am the nephew of the residence of this home. The homeowners did not "flee in the middle of the night" as neighbors reported, but they had a redeye flight they needed to catch. They went on a family trip around Europe and while on vacation, there was an accident. A car accident, and the homeowner Edward Tonks his daughter Nymphadora, and her husband Remus Lupin all died due to their fatal injuries. Andromeda, the Widow, was severely injured as well and has only just made it home with her month old grandson. I am here now to help her settle her affairs, we have only been here a few nights, and have not got around to answering the post and ringing the bank to pay bills."
Hari blinked opened his eyes, to the night illuminated by the light of the quarter moon, and the red glow of the fire. He felt different, as if he was connected to the earth beneath his feet, and the townhouse behind him. He realized he could feel the wards and all the inhabitants. He felt the connection the House-elves had to House of Black and its master; him.
"RUN!!!!" All attempts at being quiet as an angry roar seemed to shake Draco to the core. They ran.
In the middle, Hari carefully folded the clothes that he thought he’d keep. These were the nicest he owned, but Hari highly doubted Draco would consider them 'date worthy' clothes. “
“Yeah, he’s also an arsehole. But he grows on you, kinda like mold” Hari said with a shrug.
"Is there a question in there somewhere?" Draco said with a snooty upturn of his nose.
this...How? His thoughts were incoherent and fading away, as he scrambled trying to think of a solution to save their lives.
"Now for both your hair. C'iemone had a lot to work with Hari.' Arlys was explaining to Sheryl. "The poor boy only had one hair product. I'll be sending him home with shampoos and conditioners, along with a pamphlet on how to treat curly hair like his. Now that we got the tangles and cut away the dead ends we can style it."
Rubbing the back of his neck shyly, Harry laughed nervously. "The Sorting Hat actually told me that twice, but the Sword of Gryffindor disagrees. Awe, I wasn't lying I came here to help, well actually I came here to ask you something"
“Asssclepiusss, what isss Massstersss name?” the snake inquired with a hiss and inquiring flick of its forked tongue and Harry realized he was speaking parseltongue.
Draco's mouth was pinched in pain, face ashen, and his startled eyes were red and swollen. Hari noticed Draco uselessly try to pull a long white sleeve down his arm. Hari's eyes widened at the sight of blood seeping through the sleeve ineffectually concealing a cut.
Draco stood up, he was just as tall as Bill, but didn’t have as much bulk to his muscles, and didn’t need a mane to intimidate; his creature inheritance making him tall, slim, and lithe. Pupils turned to slits and then seem to vanish as they blended into his pearlescent irises of swirling grey. He growled, clicking his tongue as gas built up in his esophagus, fire burned gold against white scales at his throat.
Hari was just beginning to think that he would have to use the
Officer Sanderson scowled as he looked back at the door he just came from. Just now his partner was out there rousing some serial homeless person from loitering and panhandling in front of a shoe shop across the way. He didn't always agree with the laws, but he had to enforce them. He tried to get them help, into a shelter, or rehab, off the streets into housing units. But there was only so much he could do.
“I DID NOT KILL YOU!” knees going weak and body feeling the emotional exhaustion dragging Harry down, Harry sinks to the ground, dust everywhere in the air and on his ragged thread worm clothes. He sat in the entrance and cried all the tears he was never allowed to cry while an abused, starved, and neglected child at the Dursley’s, or at school because Gryffindors are brave, or at the funerals of his dead friends from the Second Wizarding War just days before.
“You... letting me read your journal,” Hari replied.
"What was Ollivander saying about your wand core?"
Stepping up to the fireplace, Harry contemplated using Draco Malfoy's Hawthorn with Unicorn hair wand or simply use the powder on the top of the mantle. Harry decided that floo powder might be interesting. "What do I say to the floo network?" Harry inquired.
Hari was not expecting that reaction. Suddenly, Hari's look of earnest, changed to confusion, then hurt, then anger. He was just ready to stagger up on drunken legs when Draco draped his full weight over Hari knocking him to the floor. His glasses tipped off his head not that his eyesight wasn't already blurry. Hari turned around, using one forearm to try and knock Draco off him, while the other supporting his weight on the floor. "Hey, Draco..." He gritted out.
to contend with. It was fun sneaking past patrols and finding secluded corridors to enjoy ourselves.”
Cho wrinkled her nose, saying, "That's excessively rude. You won't get away with that back in the wizarding world." Blaise only chortled.
Narcissa cleared her throat, “Dot, I need you to clear out as many multi-compartment trunks as possible, and only pack mine and Draco’s clothes and any items of necessity, hygiene, and beauty products. Kocoa, I need for you find any valuables my late husband bought me, any jewelry I bought or brought with me into our marriage, any loose gold or other currency lying around, and empty the safe in all offices.” Narcissa stopped pondering what items to take and which items to take. But her son took those thoughts out of her head.
"Your cousin?" Draco feinted surprise. "I didn't know that this was your cousin so tell me Dodley."
"Me! You could have trusted me! I would have taken him. Not left him in the cold November night on their doorstep." Minerva broke down on a sob.
A Time-Turner would be great about now.
. He nearly ripped my ear off, Hari!” Draco fumed more when he caught the look of mirth in Hari’s eyes.
"Pup, what are you saying? You don’t have to do anything. It’s not like he expected a reply, I mean you were with Cho and then Ginny. He knows this. He is probably just messing with you." Sirius said imploringly.
Once more, Hari sighed in resignation. “Alright, what do I have to do?”
Hari groaned. "Please don't make me regret this Mama Bear. Draco wanted to come.” He grossed. “Nothing too over the top, please?" He begged.
Dear Journal,
“I’ll surprise you then.” Draco smiled. “So what do you do with a baby anyway at this age, does he play?”
"You two have a curfew?"
“Not that side.” Draco said when he saw Hari’s hand reach for the side of the wardrobe that held clothing he’d never worn before. They wouldn’t smell like Draco at all. His scent had to be on Hari. It would mark him and claim him so everyone else would know that Hari Potter belonged to him.
"Welcome, Mr. Potter. It is a great honor to have the great savior in my humble bank." Harry was confused, was the female goblin being sarcastic, or was she leading him into some type of sense of security before locking him underground for him to starve to death, perhaps become a ghost to haunt the underground walls of Gringotts. His imagination was going wild with possibilities, he tried to whirl his attention back to the very serious matter at hand.
, which prevents Wizardkind from discussing or revealing their physical manifestation of their creatures’ inheritance to Muggles or outside the family bloodline or legal guardianship rights. If his aunt was on the Sanctioned Muggle list, his aunt could have informed him. But if she never told Hari that he was a wizard then it was highly unlikely she also told him he may not be entirely wizard either. This left it to his Godfather, Sirius Black, to inform him of that fact before his eighteenth birthday.
“Not if you or I ask permission and gain consent first.” Draco says, squeezing Hari harder.
Draco Malfoy once admired everything about his father. He envied the power and influence his father had in the all circles of wizarding society, in the Ministry of Magic, the Wizengamot, pure-blood circles, and in the Dark Market. His father always taught him, he was better than everyone else; he was a wizard and better than muggles, he was a pure-blood, which accounted for his prestigious breeding, and he was rich, which sure as hell was better than being poor. He was taught that anyone who wasn’t like him was less and he couldn’t associate with any of them, pre-Hogwarts days. This was why his father wanted him to enroll in Durmstrang Institute of Magical Learning, only rich Pure-bloods were permitted to attend, he would have continued to learn the Dark Arts unimpeded, and he would not be forced to associate with anyone his father didn’t approve of.
Andromeda laughed long and hard. “She helped. Baking comes easy to me. We…” She emphasized the pronoun by pointing back and forth between her and her sister. “Followed a recipe book.”
Narcissa recognized him first, “Minister, thank you!”
She rushed to her own office not caring if the the Portraits saw her running and reported it to that manipulative old coot. She changed directions. She would ask Severus for help. She owed it to the boy's father, her favorite pupil to make sure he was safe. And Severus had a life debt to cash in, plus if he even cared for the boy's mother, he might do it despite his feelings towards the father.
"Well then, I get to ask anything of you." Draco said wiggling his eyebrow.
Draco sniffed out any occupants, kicked in one stall and snarled "out," to the only occupant. The man pulled up his trousers with a squeak and hurried out the room. No doubt going to get the bouncer. They had just enough time, Draco thought to get through with a pesky Hufflepuff.
Hari Potter. His father absolutely forbade it. After his first ever canning he received by his father, his mother had snuck into his bedchamber after dark, woke him up and presented him with three gifts; the first being the journal that only he could open, the second being a multi-compartment trunk, and thirdly his first child's story about Hari Potter. From then on he secretly collected any book, or article clipping and hid them away in the trunk and journal. For three years he didn't know what the boy hero looked like, only rumors of the lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Then suddenly the world was abuzz with chatter about the boy, being seen in the company of a giant at Diagon Alley. And blurry pictures were published of this scrawny starved looking twig of a boy in rags, and glasses too big for his face and broken. His collection of images grew bigger and bigger until his journal was bursting at the seams.
"I've been dying to get him to go to the club, but he always has excuses.
“Why we wait, why don't you tell me all about that school of yours? Hari's always on about it being like a home." Sheryl asked.
She sat back, clasped her fingers together over her belly, and said "You Mr. Harry Potter have had a great disservice done to. The vault you are aware of, vault 687, is a simple trust vault set in place by your parents, granted to you when you turned eleven, for school supplies and other miscellaneous purchases, it was essentially an allouence that would have come to you, anyway. It is in fact, not your entire inheritance. According to your father's will, you should have been made full benefactor of the Potters' vault, vault 704, as the last living male descendants of the House of Potter. entirely upon your seventeenth birthday, and a trustee watched over you wealth until you came of age. Your third vault was inherited from Sirius Black, vault 711."
According to my calculations that would be...who am I kidding? I am not doing the math. I am not going to even pretend I am good at math!
Andromeda also had a coughing fit over her tea, Teddy beginning to whimper at being jostled. She quickly tried to shoosh him.
The peace was suddenly broken by a loud crash from the next room, then the unmistakable sound of her six year old son's sobbing.
In the garden, unaware of the argument going on just beyond the south facing brick wall next to the shed; the object of their discussion was relaxing in the early morning sun, spread out on the large green lawn. The last two weeks he had been kept busy cleaning out the rest of the rooms, awaiting the arrival of the Malfoy's. He wasn't about to present a filthy house to the Malfoy's to live in and like hell was he going to give Draco Malfoy the opportunity to sneer at him.
The gesture was small, but made him happy. Slytherin's just do not go out like that. The house is all about loyalty. Sure, we stab each other in the back, figuratively for years, but even we would not have let that stand.
Stay awesome, stay safe!
Hari pulled him back down and Draco allowed it. He pouted internally. It was too good to be true. "Ah...no that won't be necessary." Hari said, his cheeks burning red. "Just can I see your hand, maybe...and your tail can be out."
"How much do you remember from last night?" Hari asked.
"Hari? Where are we going?" He mumbled barely clearing his toes over each step. They tripped and stumbled into the hall on the next landing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco made it down in about thirty-five minutes. It was the bare minimum he allowed himself to primp and preen in the mirror to look presentable. Hari was once more at the stove top, the house-elves fluttering around him. Aunt Andromeda was feeding Teddy a bottle, and his mother was primly drinking tea and reading the morning paper. He was nervous about what their reaction would be when he told them Hari and he were dating.
"Teddy and Mrs. Tonks here, at Grimmauld Place?" Harry could barely recall anything about Andromeda Tonks, having only met her twice in person, he only remembered that she shared an unfavorable family resemblance to her older sister Bellatrix Lestrange. "But Kreacher, hang on. Mrs. Tonks has her own home, whose to say she even wants to live here with us?"
"Are we early? Where is everyone?" Hari asked worriedly. He felt Draco flinch beside him. When Hari looked he found the uncrackable Malfoy mask in place. He wasn't going to get any answers to his questions on that front. He turned to look at Andromeda and Narcissa.
"Like or dislike is not an issue here, Andromeda. He is a teenager, same as I, his thoughts and actions influenced by the people around him. He grew up in a house raised on prejustice pure-blood beliefs. I bet he hasn't even visited the muggle world, let alone be allowed to form his own opinion with parents like that."
He wasn’t laughing now. In fact his skin was turning blue from the chill, his teeth chattered, and he shivered all over.
"You heard my new Queening, let us begin!" Sheryl clapped her hands and laughed merrily. Draco found himself whisked away from Hari's side. His world spun as he was plopped down in a salon chair and spun to face the mirror. "No peeking at each other until you are both done." Sheryl said, but Draco could not see anything of Hari two chairs down and surrounded by people ready to pamper him.
Scratch that, Dumbledore was playing favoritism again, towards those Gryffindor's. One hundred and fifty points for each of the trio and then only ten points for poor Longbottom for standing up to your friends.
"If I go for one, then I would be expected to testify for all. I don't want to be in out in public anymore than I have to. Here." He said as he handed over the letter he prepared in advance, just in case the Minister of Magic came through.
"Sorted?"
He smiled, it was barely eight o'clock in the morning he noted, by the grandfather clock in the corner, and his day was already looking bright.
Harry heard what Kreacher said, and his mind whirled with possible reasons and solutions.
Draco had other ideas.
"He's gone, Dray. Never coming back. I've made sure of that. I'd know if he still lived." And with that said, rubbing his old lightning bolt scar absently, Hari deciding to ignore the confrontation for now. It wasn't worth it anymore. Hari changed the subject. "So, the kitchen. The Laundry. Boiler room. Cold storage. The pantry. The wine cellar. Kreacher's den. And the second Floo entry point." Hari said, ending each sentence with a point of a finger.  Draco was not interested in this area he referred to as the servants domain. Other than checking out the content of the wine cellar, Hari had a feeling the Malfoy's would leave this area alone.
"I'm alright, I'm alright. Just forgot you spoke parseltongue and it gave me a bad moment, tis all." Draco managed to get out.
, the rational part of his brain explained.
. No matter how he tried to rationalize to his alpha self that mate-claiming a minor was not only illegal but impossible with the ice-blood, there was still that voice in the back of his mind, his dragon self, his alpha self, whispering
"later?" Hari asked with a tilt of his head.
“I trust you,” Draco said as he clipped the straps together and swung his leg behind Hari. “I’ll have a word with Sirius later, though.” He muttered under his breath.
"Officer Sanderson." Nik said tiredly. He had been working overtime, waking up early to get the bakes done to be sold and made a profit by himself. Deep lines showed on his face, many from laughter but recently from signs of age. Grey peppered his tawny hair. He had forgotten to shave, and stubble darkened his cheeks and chin.
Blood spurted from his head and torso, like being cut by a sword. With hardly a cry, Draco collapsed back to the wet, and bloody floor, his blood mixing with Potters, floating like crimson flowers. Draco’s hand scrambled at his blood-soaked chest, scarcely believing his eyes. ‘Harry Potter had cast Dark Magic!’
When he began drunken cussing, and stumbling away, Harry followed him. Peering behind a garbage bin He found the bum had made a nice, if smelly makeshift tent out of coats, blankets, and boxes beneath a fire escape in the shadows.
check it out!
Hari didn’t say anything else, but he didn’t relax either. After the zenith moon ritual and blood-adoption, Hari was considered a Black by rights, the Master of the house, and now...family.
"Yes, but your mother didn't slip me tongue during her kiss." Hari bantered back.
“Exactly,” Kreacher squeaked, “he had a godson, as do you.”
"I DON"T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE!"
Harry didn't realize he had been drawing attention to himself. Piers noticed him talking, nudged Dudley.
"Wasn't sure if my owl would find you, or if you were receiving letters, and if you would even show up if you did." Blaise said.
"You used the last of the dittany last night."
-----
As the music began to play, Queen Daenerys slowly rose from her perch along with the lyrics. The crowd was defining.
“I don’t see…” And Harry trailed off, because he did see. At eye level, the banister carved into an intricate serpent. Its body had moved, until its head was extended horizontally towards Harry, its tongue flicked in and out questioningly. Harry’s eyes widened and his voice croaked a little as he liked his lips and spoke, “What’s your name?”
“What happened to your snowy owl? I used to see you with her all the time at Hogwarts, even without receiving or sending owls. I haven’t seen her at all...”Draco trailed off at Hari’s look of devastation.
Relaxing back in his chair, but never slouching-Malfoy-s don’t slouch, Draco looked at Hari with hooded eyes tapping his newly acquired vault key to his bottom lip.Hari’s birthday was coming right around the corner. In a little over a month's time. He had plenty of time to woo his beautiful innocent boyfriend. Something that Draco was looking forward to. A wicked smirk bloomed on Draco’s face as he watched Hari lick up sticky juices from the apple slices he currently munched on. Draco unconsciously mirrored the move.
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
Narcissa grumbled something along the lines of, “stupid blood-traitors, not teaching their children the proper ways of magic.” Draco hushed his mother, listening more intently.
Draco actually looked a bit hurt. "Blaise is one of my true friends, Hari. I am not expecting him to double cross me, or try to hurt me." Draco was already slipping out of the rest of his dress robes. He was bare chested and barefoot, his hair tousled from sleep and Hari playing with it.
'What's with that look, is there something your not saying?" Blaise leaned into Draco's personal space and Draco nocked his hand off his shoulder.
The first Auror went to follow the two Malfoy’s before the second one gripped his shoulder and shook his head. They’ve been dismissed, the Malfoy's were no longer their concern, they had reports to make. With a crack, they disapperated away in a swirl of scarlet.
After they ate, Draco accioed his Nimbus 2001 from the quidditch shed and traded turns flying around the yard, doing aerial tricks to impress Hari.
"Sirius I got to talk to you. It's important". Hari staged whispered.
"It's how muggles communicate. A pager is a little black box, usually, that you could send little written messages to quickly."
“But what?” Hari demanded. Draco did not like that tone of voice.
them as best I am able. I've only been able to follow them during daylight hours. I need to study, I need to sleep. My grades haven't fallen, but I've been distracted. I still haven't beat Granger yet. Father was not happy with my third quarter grades. So I've cracked down on the books to try to outsmart that Mud-blood.
“It’s just that…I don’t know you.” Hari shrugged uncomfortable. Draco reached across the table hesitantly; Hari looked up at him inquisitively before nodding his consent and took Draco’s hand in his.
"But I...I don't hate the idea...I think he isn't lying, but I can't be sure," Hari mumbled.
Hari had a particularly sour look on his face. "Then you better hide what she is, then. Don't say anything about going to school in Scotland, less Aunt Petunia catches on or worse, Uncle Vernon."
Tipping back his horn tipped head, he let out a jet of red fire that seemed to melt the sky.
“How are you doing, Hari?” Draco’s hot breath breathed against the outer shell of Hari’s ear.
Hermione Granger
echoed through his head.
Hari didn’t. he really didn’t. What he did want was a glimpse at Draco's alleged journal of him in hopes of clearing up this confusion. Because, before tonight Hari had always believed that Draco hated him as a child, but now he is saying the complete opposite. So, he had to get his hands on that journal.
Hari throbbed, his balls ached, and a ball of heat bubbled at his core. He didn’t know how long he would last-- how long the dream would last. He pushed it out of his mind.
Obviously that didn’t happen, which leaves Draco in a bind. He couldn’t go through with a proper courtship without Hari knowing of Draco’s dragon inheritance. As part of a hundred year old tradition,
"Can you bend your fingers, at all?"  Hari said in a strangled voice.
"You broke my board. You're going to pay for that!" He snarled centimeters from his face. The hand not currently wrinkling his shirt, raised in a face. If Draco could go any paler, he would.
I     t’s not expedient at all. It’ll take weeks for this letter to reach you. Oh, Harry, I hope you are all right and at least you’ve managed to clean out one bedroom by now and aren’t sleeping on the floor in the parlour.
“Yes, 12 solid inches made of Holly with a Dragon Heartstring core. The Heartstring belonged to an anc-“ He trailed off looking at Hari, with a look of comprehension in his eyes. Draco closed his eyes, resigned to the truth. Hari Potter didn’t know about creatures’ blood, Ollivander not being able to talk about an ancestor of his, an actual dragon, had donated the heartstrings to Ollivander to make wand cores for the Black’s. “I have those exact perimeters, but to see if they suit, that’s the issue. Let’s see here…” Draco looked up to see Ollivander absently scratching his goatee. Mr. Ollivander smiled as he went through wands one after another, before settling on a very similar 9 ¾ inch rigid Holly with Dragon Heartstring core. It had an Ivory handle with a green emerald center, and elaborate black pearls embroidered into the hilt of the wand. Draco was pleased to note that it was exactly to his mother’s tastes.
"We go to school together, which you already know. Going on eight years, now. It seems like a lifetime ago when we met in Madams Mankins, getting fitted for our ro-uniforms." Draco relented.
Trout was a graying man. Literally, everything about him was gray from his beard to his trench coat. It was quickly assessed that he was also homeless. He slept beneath a pile of old blankets, a torn blue tarp, and milk crates.
Draco stopped wolf whistling, but continued to make appreciated noises at the show. Draco critiqued Hari’s choices now and again, or rejection some of Hari’s choices out right, or compromising on others.
"Don't give me any lip, Dragon, and listen carefully. You are in pre-rut, which means its not at its strongest yet. As long as there is no one of
Taken aback at Draco’s anger, Hari recoiled a little. “The flying gear is broken since we crashed landed in the marshes outside the Burrow and the invisibility booster is busted, too. We can’t fly around Muggle London for all the world to see.”
Hari moved to Draco’s other side, looking sideways at Draco for approval when his hand moved towards a hanger. Draco only nodded and continued searching. Hari let out a breath and pawed through Draco’s clothes. His eyes widened, and his mouth opened softly in wonderment. His hands slowed down to pet the soft material beneath his hand.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
The third letter was delivered by a gold breasted owl, the likes of which Hari had never seen before with a heart shaped face of pale pink, and while the underbelly and underwings were white, the outer feathers could rival the colour of the dawning sun with bright orange, bronze, and champagne feathers. Draco raised his eyebrow at the beautiful poised bird before him. Thinking it was for him, he reached for the letter but the owl hopped out of reach. So the letter was for Hari. Draco shrugged nonchalant, trying to act like he wasn’t curious at what the letter said, but Hari could sense that Draco’s eagerness nearly had him vibrating with anticipation.
Draco wrinkled his nose, “The Dusk Time Ritual during Litha is for purging ourselves of past things that caused us pain and difficulty. To unburden our conscience to make way for the future.”
"We've already had our second date." Draco said confidently.
can hear you.” Draco responded with a sneer. Bill appeared to swell up in size back stiff he reached for his wand, but Hari caught his wrist with Seeker reflexes. Bill paused from unleashing his attack, stunned. Hari not only stood between a wizard’s wand and his opponent. He stepped between two alphas about to do battle over territory rights. Bill as the intruder and Draco the one doing the defending.
“Not a problem, Potter.” Draco spat out, not wanting to reveal how close he came to losing control in there. “Honestly, how could you freeze up like that? Destroyer of the Greatest Dark Lord of all time, the wizarding world’s savior…ha!”
Andromeda and Narcissa who paused in their mad chatter, looked over at the exchange. Andromeda looked on in approval, taking delight in the exchange, not noticing at first the tension building within her nephew. Narcissa on the other hand, was well intune with her son's moods, saw the tense shoulders and panicked look and went to her son's rescue. Speaking in rapid fire French, "Mon Dragon,
Something moved beneath Narcissa's hand on the banister as she peered up and the railing to see Hari and her son slowly climb the stairs. She yelped and moved her hand back startled. Asclepius, slithered on by. She was lucky he hadn't decided to bite her to get her attention. She heard hissing coming from Hari, no doubt conversing with the wooden snake fixture.
“I’ll try to restrain myself.” He swallowed.

Stalks his prey in the night
As the afternoon wore on, Harry worried more and more for his bodily safety. They already saw the birds, the monkeys, and the feline exhibit, in which a bird pooped on Dudleys shoes, the monkeys kept displaying their big pink buts to Piers, and the lions slept in their cool caves and refused to come out. Dudley and Piers were getting bored of the animals. And when they got bored they fell back on their favorite past time. Beating up on Harry.
Draco raised his hand as he professed, “Godson.” To which Hari’s jaw dropped.
The first sales associate urged silently.
Andromeda turned from the altar, not with a knife, but a simple sewing needle. Hari let out a sigh of relief.
No joke: I finally posted chapter 1 in the companion story, Pulling Strings, Behind the Scenes.
This new sensation was entirely different than before. Harry felt a different sensation along his whole body. As if cool air played against wet skin, goosebumps erupted across his body and his hair on his arms stood on end. Then as if a gentle breeze suddenly gusted through his cupboard, his bangs moved to reveal his lightning bolt shaped scar. He didn't open his eyes until he heard the sound of a brass chain sliding against wood.
"I'll be waiting for you at home. Go protect and serve, and teach your trainee partner to be kind and respectful to all civilians, not just the clean ones!" He hollard, not at all kidding. Nik knew what it was like to be homeless, before this uniformed officer, reached out his hand and his heart.
Draco’s alpha was still a juvenile, he was just recently presented, and he wouldn’t be able to control his base urges. If he was rejected he would leave on his own accord. His alpha would be too possessive, too uncontrollable to stay near him and not inadvertently hurt him. If Hari really only wanted to be his friend, could Draco be satisfied with just being near him? Or, he could risk rejection and confess.
Draco snickered at the sight of his usual poised and proper mother. Narcissa walked over to Draco’s side, tisked at the smudge of grime on her son’s shoulder, and pulled out a pristine white handkerchief. Ignoring her own appearance, she fussed over Draco, all the while chatting cheerily with her sister about past memories.
"They're tone deaf too, that's where you get it from." C'iemone says.
"The third page includes the Potters' vault, it collects interest and royalties from multiple investments over the past centuries that keep filling the coffers. You are seventeen and can now review and withdraw whatever moneys you wish to. Your own investment you made in '96 with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes is just a small portion of the investments, Potters' over the centuries have contributed to the coffers. For instance two well known healing potions was invented by your ancestor, Linfred, invented Skell-gro and pepperup potion, while your own grandfather, Fleamont, invented the  magical Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion with slogan, '
Hari’s breath caught at the sight of the Muggle envelope with achingly familiar, small tight handwriting addressed to him. Hari knew instantly who the letter was from.
But his uncle didn't believe him. Neither did his aunt. They seemed to think he had dangerous ideas.
"Eighteen." Draco replied smoothly. "Do you want to check my I.D.?"
"That canna be. Harry would neva do such a thin, yeh got it wrong." Hagrid sputtered. "How could yeh let a lil' boy run out like tha. Dumbledore trusted yeh..."
He usually wakes up early enough to sit back in his pillows with a cup of hot tea with raspberry jam, or if he is feeling particularly indulgent, hot chocolate. While he enjoys his hot beverage he usually writes in his journal. This mornings hangover, being no exception. Head pounding he reached for his journal that he usually keeps beneath the pillow next to his head, feeling nothing there, he opens his eyes in confusion. Peering beneath the pillow, nothing. He lifts the other twelve pillows, still nothing. Hanging his head over the side of the bed, nope not there. Feeling by the baseboard; nothing. In a panic, Draco scrambles out of bed to fling the duvet back.
"Now cubs! This is C'iemone and this is Arlys." C'iemone and Arlys both wore blue, but their costumes could not be more opposite than night and day.
"We could leave him in the car." She suggested.
“…That’s what you meant when you said not good enough…Draco,” Hari let out a bark of laughter. “I’m not that great a catch, alright.” Draco looked at Hari and snorted.
McGonagall didn't believe Harry, but I did.
He opened the door and was immediately blinded by the light from outside. The light would attract attention, so he barreled out the door stumbling into an even greater crowd of Muggles than he expected. The noise was far greater, too. Nearly blinded, and disoriented Draco stumbled as far from the door of the Leaky as possible before tripping and losing his balance. He fell to his knees in the gutter. Suddenly, his arm was tugged up and he was pulled to his feet and away just in time for a metal beast to zip past, Draco felt the slipstream of the beast trying to pull him along, but the firm grip on his arm kept him grounded.
“This place has changed so much in the short time we’ve stayed here.” Draco heard the sound of Hari’s voice.
"Ah geez Ollie, I didn't mean to put your establishment or your daughter in danger. His license only lying for a little over a month.
Draco's eyes, gray rimmed in dark lashes looked deep into Harry's eyes. Carefully as to assess his reaction, Draco bent his head, kissing first one cheek, then the other. Pausing to stare once more into eyes a startling green. Harry's pink, moist looking lips were parted in silent surprise. Taking the uninvited, Draco grasped Harry's chin between pointer and thumb as his lips captured Harry's in a gentle but firm kiss. Swirling his tongue around Harry's once on the departure, he stepped back shivering and brushed passed Harry on his way to the open patio doors, wiping his lips with the back of his hand. As he passed, he whispered in Harry's ear, "Thanks, Potter."
Harry choked on his grief as he thought about his godfather, ‘His life was wasted…his death was pointless…Sirius!’ Harry’s right hand was clenched into a white knuckled fist at his side, his left hand rising to his face, and his shoulders shook. ‘It’s my entire fault you’ve died… Merlin you were only, what? 36 years old? If I hadn’t been so reckless…If I had taken those Occlumency lessons seriously, I would have known it was a trap…maybe…’
Harry put on a particular mullish expression.
Potter snarled, “You wish, Malfoy” as he threw his head back, neck contorted as he bucked his hips, trying to dislodge Draco from astride, but only succeeding in nocking Draco forward onto all fours, face only inches from his own. Draco inched forward, only to have Potter twist his head to the side. Draco was unimpeded, though and swiped his tongue across the gash at Potter’s temple, causing him to hiss between teeth clenched tight. Draco then buried his nose in Potter’s throat. Breathed in the smell of fresh snow, a scent of one unpresented, forbidden.
Draco was mortified. Hari on the other hand was really enjoying Draco's discomfort "...or propositioning me to go to bed with you?"
" Harry exclaimed loudly, before looking around frantically. He saw people staring, whispering, and pointing. Worse, he saw his aunt and uncle standing near by. His uncles face purple, and his aunts face bone white.
Shaking the memory, he turned on the hot water in the shower. He smiled as he stepped into the steam filled shower stall, signing as the hot water fell over his tense shoulders and down his back. He relaxed as he let the water fall around him, rinsinsing his body of sweat and dried cum.
"You're not allowed to use mm, maa, magic outside of school." Dudley stuttered.
Embarrassed at being caught, Draco fidgeted. "Um...yeah, sorry."
"Get a move on. I want you to finish the bacon. And I want everything to be absolutely perfect for my Dudderkins birthday." She gushed.
Officer Paul Sanderson opened the door and stepped into the heat of the bakery, just in time to see a black messy head streak through the archway in the backroom and a slamming of a heavy door in the distance.  He looked curiously at the baker, Nik.
"That's nice!" Hari and Draco chorused.
"Not all the Malfoy's. Just Narcissa and Draco. Lucius can suffer the Dementor's kiss, he has already escaped justice twice now."
After Andromeda and Narcissa left, they stood in silence and still dripping cold mud. It would be an easy thing to vanish the mud from most of their attire but Draco figured a warm bath would warm his body and cleanse his body after a stressful day away from Grimmauld Place. Stepping out of muddy trainers, the teens looked at each other, neither really wanting to leave each other’s company, but too awkward with each other still to voice this.
“And I won’t be if you keep insulting me or my friends, either.” Hari said in all seriousness. Draco’s confidence waned a bit.
Checking to make sure there weren't any look - a - loo outside, he cautiously began undressing before the floor mirror. Whipping his white, blonde hair out of his face in annoyance, he wrestled with the jumper as best he could without stretching the thin, soft material. His first attempt had his head going through the chest hole.
Draco rested his sweaty brow against the cool windowsill and just breathes in the scent of cool predawn air. The garden looked eerie beautiful in the dark, shadows cast from all directions, the only source of light coming from the faint light of the stars. He looked up into the dark sky smiling ryling. The constellation he was named after was just visible in the northwest. His mother told him that when he was born on the fifth of June at one o'clock in the morning, his father as per his mother's insistence, had looked up into the night sky and picked out the constellation dead center of the sky.
“Cissy?” Andromeda set her tea aside to take her sister’s cold hands in hers. The cold fingers began to tremble upon her warm touch.
Slytherin's won every year for the past six years in House-points and Quidditch, Dumbledore is playing favoritism towards the Golden trio.
Then here come Harry bloody Potter, riding a Centaur of all creatures, with its upper body that of a man with white blond hair and soft sapphire eyes, and his body was that of a Palomino horse. He said his name was Firenze.
“Sheryl, no!” Hari shouted mortified. “It’s…it’s not like that. He’s just a…a friend.” Draco winced on the inside at being firmly placed in the friend zone.
supporters were still out there, are still out there. Who could I trust to keep him safe."
It was the perfect plan, I gloat to my fellow Slytherin’s that I am purposefully going to stand Harry up and alert Filch of the rumor of the duel, (I didn’t) and then I sneak out to see him in private. That would have worked if I could have shaken my goons fast enough. By the time I made it to the clock tower it was already chiming the midnight hour. What’s more, Filch was there. Filch didn’t see me, but Peeves did. He was already hollering about students being out of bed. How did I miss Harry?
"It was with your mother and aunt!" Hari exclaimed loudly from his own imprisonment in his chair.
“And where is here, exactly?” Draco asked as he looked across the way to where Hari pointed. He felt his jaw drop in wonderment.  Towering over head was the sight of two majestic metal wings sweeping out as if in flight.
Draco choked on air as his mother smothered a snicker. “I wonder how, dear son?” She whispered conspicuously to Draco.
“Stop!” Draco called desperately. “We are getting off topic. Let me finish, because once I stop talking you may want to rethink those...thoughts.”
pink-red blooms. The tall willowy blonde in powder blue dress robes looked around in awe at the magical garden that appeared out of nowhere from a back alley in London. She said something over her shoulder, presumably to her son, Draco who still stood out of sight, but the wind caught the words and blew them out of Harry's ear shot. She gathered a bunch of fabric to step over a circular ledge onto the gravel pathway when she saw Harry sitting in the grass.
------
"Not hardly, Andromeda. we didn't get along at all. I am sorry, I actually forgot he was related to you. Narcissa Malfoy is your sister then?"
“Draco, what’s going on?” Hari stammered out
£1=$1.27 (roughly)
“The third time, Lucius was to lead a group of Death Eaters, undetected into the Department of Mysteries to set up an ambush, while Voldemort used our connection to lure me out of the Castle. He realized our minds were linked together through this scar when I informed the Order members that Voldemort was after something in the Department of Mysteries. Dumbledore sent Order members to guard what I believed at the time was a weapon. I was later able to use this same connection to save Mr. Weasley’s life when he was attacked protecting the weapon.” Bill’s eyes widened in realization at this information, while Dumbledore never told them everything, Bill was finally getting some unanswered questions. This was the changing point in the war. Draco on the other hand, was hearing all this for the first time from Hari’s lips paying close attention to the words that sealed his fate.
Draco listened to the sound of footsteps heading towards the door, then pause, before changing direction and heading back towards him. He felt a tapping on his shoulder and Hari breath in his ear, “It’s locked.”
Hari sighed as they approached the Lord and Lady Mausoleum on the vast Malfoy estate. Upon arrival at Malfoy Manor, Hari was shocked to see the burnt out husk that remained of the once elegant and resplendent Manor.
She glanced between the two teens before her, one gold tipped finger over her lip, the other hand tapping nails against her outer thigh in thought. A sly grin grew across her lips. Batting her gold flacked eyelashes, she teased. "Ah, my sweet Marry-Alice. You brought two new queenlings to moonlight with us."
"What of course, not..." Sirius tried to interject.
------
Hari often waved off unwanted advances, taking none of them serious. In the wizarding world many people flocked to his side because he was famous, but had nothing to offer in the Muggle world.  So he took none of the advances seriously, figuring they were either teasing him or using him as practice to flirt. What Hari couldn’t see about himself was that he was an enigma to hopeful suitors; silent and withdrawn at times, but when drawn out of his shell was witty, and his laugh always came out a bit startled, as if surprised that he could laugh.
"Harry." Nik smiled and pushed over the plate of steaming breakfast Harry had in days that wasn't stolen from a side-car vendur, swiped off someones discarded plate, or from the trash.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, the Wizengamot has come to a consensus,” Draco couldn’t believe such a quick verdict was made after only a reading of a letter. Well almost, Bloody Saint Potter always got his way. Still he waited with halted breath, “all criminal charges have been dropped, you were a minor forced to take the Dark Mark under duress, you are free to go home.” The shackles around Draco’s wrists clanked to the floor, Draco stood up in a daze absently rubbing his wrists.
Harry mustered all his courage and scrambled on the bar stool, his feet dangling, unable to reach the foot rest attached below the lip of the bar. He didn't let that deter him, he sat swinging his feet instead.
Going red in the face, Hari kept quiet. A press of a hand on his shoulder had him looking up as Draco leaned over to peck his lips. Hari caught off guard only froze as his tea was stolen and a laughing Draco took a sip as he settled beside him at the table.
01 April 2018
Hari looked up at Draco’s face, guiltily snatching his hand away. “Ah, I don’t know where to start.”
The seed burst into flames but instead of turning to ash, a tiny green seedling emerged from the crack. Narcissa levitated the seedling into the cauldron.
Sickles = ~£1
Hari was tipsy, if not drunk, leaned over and said honestly. "Seventeen, but I'm not drinking." He then swved his club soda in the air and ruined the effect by giggling.
Well, Harry has had enough of public events and paparazzi.
His mother. Dot got his mother.
"Prongslet that is an odd nickname to give someone." Andromeda mussed as she flicked her wand again. "Here you try, Harry love."
"You'll have to explain that one later."
"You may find yourself down the rabbit hole tonight, Draco. But you're neither the Red nor White Queen, as glamourous as you are. No, only the Black Queen will do." Sheryl practically vibrated out of her skin.
"This is all very interesting, Draco, but what does this have to do with pure-blood factions?" Hari said, taking the book back. He would have to compare names to the images that appear on the tapestry later, because he wasn't going to remember all that.
"Your son, snuck into the exhibit, most likely on a dare. The snake got out, the door closed and locked the boys inside. There is simply no other logical, rational explanation for how the snake got out and the boys locked in." The policeman said.
Stay Awesome!
The rush of magic that left Harry’s body in a tidal wave made his legs buckled beneath him.
Drool. Laughing lightly, Hari returned to Draco's room.
For the second time that day, Draco thought Hari was perfect. Except he wasn't. Draco could see, even through pink hued lovestruck lenses and drunken inhibition that the boy he loved was scarred.
doing here?” He practically hissed. Draco’s dragon had superior hearing and heard every word. His alpha was always on guard around Hari, so when unfamiliar alpha stepped through the Floo, he stood up from his spot at the table.
“You should fire your private tutor, they have done you a disservice."
"Make it move!" Dudley demanded snottily to his father. Uncle Vernon in turn huffed out a breath beneath his massive mustache, rapping his own knuckles against the glass and then said very loudly, "MOVE!"
Harry killed Voldemort; he hunted and killed each of his soul fragments, and then killed Voldemort. Or did Voldemort Kill himself? Harry never casted the Killing Curse during the war, only disarmed. Twice; Voldemort’s curse was rebounded against himself and twice Harry survived the Killing Curse. ‘Neither shall live while the other survives.’ The problem was, Harry didn’t want to survive this last time. He was the last Horcrux; the last fragmented soul of Voldemort lived on inside himself. In order for Voldemort to be killed, Harry had to die first. Harry had enough of standing to the side while everyone around him died. He took comfort in knowing he was going to die. Have Voldemort kill his own last soul fragment, and then Harry was going to let someone else finish him off. Harry didn’t want to kill, only disarm so someone else could kill. Harry was faced with a new conundrum; he lived when all he wanted to do was die.
“Good choice, sir. Can’t say I ever had any myself Master, but ol’ Kreacher here, fine education in what Spirits to bring to the party. Hard stuff here, and Wines and Champagnes in the cellar.” Never mind that Kreacher was no longer that crinkly old and smelly house-elf, but rejuvenated and young looking. ‘He would probably never get over talking like an old man, er elf’.

“You had me in a marriage contract with Daphne Greengrass?” Draco asked astounded.
-----
Intrigued at the idea of another surprise, she patted Harry's cheek absentmindedly murmured, "Call me Narcissa" and walked the rest of the the way through the grass, not bothering with the pathway. Smiling Harry was looking over his shoulder at Narcissa and didn't see Draco emerge around the shed he hid behind when shockingly, his mother ran to embrace Hary on the lawn.
Draco looked intently at Hari wanting to know the answer to his question asked in jest, “so, what did you dream?”
"In the last century, no direct ancestors in my father's line were Muggle. But go further back...the lines blur a little. Malfoy's had to adapt to their environment when the family moved from France to Britain. When more and more squibs popped up in the lines, the families knew they had to branch out. Still, the ideas of keeping the lineage pure within the families is prominent in pure-blood society. But the exclusive list of pure-blood families was always a point of pride for my father, but the list was not complete."
He was first to recover, blinking the spots furiously from his sight. He looked up at the assailant. "Finch-Fletchley!" Draco cried incomprehensibly.
Please comment below!
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
"Hi Fleur, thank you for all you have done for me, this last year." Harry replied before turning his attention to the paperwork at hand.
It was everything else that bewildered him. Hari thought necessity had made him a minimalist. He’d lived in a cupboard for the first half of his life after all, and the second was spent living out of his trunk and travelling back and forth from Scotland to Surrey before going on the run just last year. But the amount of stuff scattered over every surface clearly argued to the contrary.
Hari owns Sirius's flying motorcycle so I see Draco riding behind, no side-cart for him.
Draco looked at the first open drawing he made of Hari. He selfishly wanted to keep it for himself. “Not this one, It’s not very good.” Draco decided. “Besides, I am sure the young heir Black would not want such an unflattering animatis sketch of himself falling on his face over and over again.” Draco jokes.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy! Get off the ground right this instance. Stop playing in the mud like a toddler, you are eighteen years old. Act Like it…” And so the scolding continued.
Draco gasped at the tingling sensation beneath his skin. Warmth slowly radiated up his arm, heat intensifying as his magic was forced from his core to the open wound. He was mesmerised as his skin began to knit back together before his very eyes.
He lifted his Nimbus 2001 that had been discarded on the steps earlier. Draco was about to make a big leap of faith. He needed courage when he usually had none, so the only times he felt truly confident was when he was flying.
Andromeda and Narcissa had been sitting down for after supper drinks in the parlor when they suddenly overheard a commotion from an open window.
Hari thought of the kitchen as his private safe haven, even Kreacher knew not to interrupt him when he was on a cooking spree.
"Rut! Pre-rut." Draco grumbled, suddenly not liking the attention he was getting now from Hari. He sat up at a rustling he heard at his door. On silent hinges the swung open and Kreacher, elected currier for letters, let an owl in.
"I'll go with you. Send a response." Hari said, already getting up.
With an almost shy shrug of the shoulders, Hari tried for casual, “So yeah…ah…if you want to be friends…I guess we could…uh…try at being friends.”
For that, Hari chuckled, "I don't know, sleepyhead. Let me have my arm back and we'll both know." Hari said amused. Yawning hugely he complied. Shifting down further on his chest and allowed Hari's arms to escape its pin.
"Mother!" He hissed embarrassed, but her words did manage to calm his nerves.
“And you’d think that I’d find his mannerism offensive. He’s loud, stubborn, foul mouthed, and sarcastic in this sort of sassy way. Don’t forget he dresses absolutely horribly.”
“If she can’t put their own memories back in their head, perhaps she could use her memories of them as a family together. But then, there would be gaps in their memories and a mind healer would have to be used to bridge those missing memories.”
Where else could he go? He sure as hell wasn’t going back to the Dursley’s. Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley could all go to hell in a hand-basket. A simple handshake and a flippant comment by Dudley, “I don’t think you’re a waste of Space,” does not make a house a home in Harry’s book. What did Dumbledore think he was doing, “as long as you can call your aunts house home…” ‘Bullshite!’
Harry thought as he was stuffed in the back of uncle Vernon's new patent leather car beside the rat nosed Piers and Fat Dudley. Before they left, his uncle had pulled him aside to growl in his face.
spell, or allow Kreacher to once more appearate master to the drawing room."
“DRACO!” Hari yelled. He flipped the broom around and looked desperately beneath him. Gripping the handle tightly he was about to dive, when something large and white streaked up from beneath him, the wind having him check his trajectory. A sound he hadn’t heard since the breakout of Gringotts filled his ears. A deafening roar.
"On that page, you will notice that I have personally signed and notarized your vault net worth for just your trust account. It is not linked to any investments, and doesn't collect interest as your other two vaults do. The only other items of worth in there is your birth certificate and some journals by your parents you may like to look through. There is a lot of power in knowing who you are."  He'd better take a look at his birth certificate, then hadn't he.  'Did his aunt and uncle even have a birth certificate for him? Did Dumbledore give them one. How did he even register for primary school?'

study, for he could finally stop referring to everything as Sirius's, and look over the contents of the trunk. He pulled out a stuffed lion plush, and a soft baby blanket with gold snitches zooming around. Were these his when he was a baby? In any case he wanted to give them to Teddy.
Dudley withdrew his hand reluctantly. He went to snag a cool ranch crisp when Cho slapped his hand and scolded him about his diet. "Right, cheers." He said with a longing look at the pile of crisps.
Narcissa looked up at her son and saw the silent tears, the watery laugh that escaped his trembling lips involuntarily. That was when she seemingly pulled herself together. She pulled herself into the strong, proud witch her inner dragon demanded she become. She produced a handkerchief out of thin air and as the loving mother she would always be, no matter how old or far away they moved; lovingly wiped her son’s eyes. “Now, now dragon, stop crying. I didn’t raise a Hufflepuff.”
“Your gold is not welcome here. How are we to believe it isn’t counterfeit leprechaun gold after all?” Horrid red hair and teeth said.
Draco was stunned, he never thought to be having a drunk conversation with Hari Potter like this. Brain scrambling and heart racing he tried to play it off. "Why Potter," Draco said taking the last sip of his drink to his lip, before pouring himself another tumbler. "if you wanted to see me naked, all you had to do was ask." Draco really couldn't bring himself to show Hari the scars on the lower half of his body.
, and sprint across it running over drinks right and left to jump down in front of Hari first and pump his hand and chattered wildly at him.
Mr. Ollivander was pleased, he grinned so much. The words he spoke were almost a bubbly as the ones floating around the wand shop. One of the witches shrieked when a particularly large and wet soapy bubble popped right above her head, flattening her yellow hair. Revenge was best served soapy. “11 1/2 inches long, willow with Horned Snake Horn core. Beautifully crafted, may I add? The jewel in the center is actually one from the head of the Horned Snake.”
"You're Alleycat. Wirely and mean, black mangy hair and bright green cat eyes. Alleycat." Trout says with conviction. "I've had eyes on you, seen you about, stealing, sleeping, running from the pigs now and then."
The walls of the long hallway were lit with poorly dusted gas lamps, to show peeling wallpaper, and carpets worn thin.
'Yes, us plebeians own trinkets as high class as combs. If you like, I'll go find it and shove it up your arse. Though, I don't think it'll be pleasant, I carved it from rat bones."
What was worse, was his mother knew his every desire, had seen it develop from infatuation, to crush, to lust, and now as an alpha fighting his every desire during pre-rut.
"You're a Parselmouth?" Draco said quite dumbly. He could see for himself Alleycat was one. The giant snake and hissing obviously giving it away.
“Yes. I, too would like not to be mobbed. Once was plenty enough, as is. Shall we go?” Draco headed towards the front door, faintly curious to see what the townhouse looked like from the sidewalk.
In the last week Harry went to five funerals with the new Minister of Magic, and old friend, Kingsley Shacklebolt, thinks it would be good press for him to go to even more.
“We will be right with you, Mr. Hari Potter, sir.” One of them responded, before quickly turning her gaze to Draco. “I am sorry, you’ll have to take your business elsewhere, and we have more urgent matters to attend to.” One of the cousins, Draco didn’t bother asking for an introduction, focused her eyes on Hari. Hari’s eyes widened incredulously as she winked suggestively at Hari.
Harry barely containing an eye-roll as he sat by and watched the crazy unfold.
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
From then on, Hari visited Sheryl’s Place as often as possible to escape the Dursley’s and enjoy a proper meal, in which he paid for in labor by cleaning dishes in the back and humming happy tunes for three to four hours. He vowed that one day he’d pay Sheryl back her compassion. He told Sheryl a little about himself, how he went to a boarding school in Scotland, paid for by some money left to him when his parents died. He stayed clear of talking about the wizarding world, filling in the blanks as best he could, and easily dodged questions he didn’t want to answer, like where the bruises came from, and where he lived. But he talked about his friends, and his least favorite class, 'Chemistry', and how he wanted to join 'law enforcement'.
“I mean, the statute of secrecy says we have to dress up as Muggles when in King’s Cross, but never in such plebeian clothes as I’ve seen you lot wear. I simply can’t be seen on a date with you wearing such… rags.” Draco continued searching through his clothes. It took him a moment to realize that Hari was no longer searching with him, and looking up, found himself meeting Hari’s furious green eyes.
Mon Mère sent me my favorite sweets as a present. A box of deluxe dark chocolate with just a sprinkle of sea salt. I had to hide them from Crabbe and Goyle. I know from experience that they would eat them all.
"Right, and these pure-blood's may also have different views on Muggles."
“But won’t getting rid of the Fidelius charm open up the house to unwanted guests, like press and my-uh- fans?” Hari grimmanced.
“You have a lot of explaining to do, young man. Disappearing like that on us. You had the girls and I worried something had happened to yeah, when you never returned.”
Hari and Draco are trapped inside the Leaky Cauldron by a mob of Hari's admirers. Draco’s alpha instincts are at war within his conscious. How will Draco react to the crowds in Diagon Alley, and later as Hari takes him out to lunch at Sheryl's Place.
Draco tried, He really did. But Hari was being too seductive and he was just sitting there eating. Hari had made one request and that was that they try to eat as a family. Breakfast the morning before was a failure. The second time was just as bad. Narcissa and Andromeda, Draco and Hari sat outside on the terrace patio having a simple lunch. Draco wasn't eating, he was simply drinking in the vision before him, tousled hair, quick toothed grin, and shining green eyes.
"You aren't here, Draco. It's just in my head. Leave me alone." Harry rubbed his eyes, wanting to leave the bed – yet the sheets got a hold of him.
What were they doing?
Harry ran with him. The blonde pulled his arm, yanking him from one place to another – full of joy, as if he didn't have any care in the world. Harry stumbled. The amount of speed was too much for his joints to handle right now, yet he couldn't allow himself to trip along the way. No one could see them. No one was supposed to know of them. And yet someone did. Ginny. The thoughts of her wandered around his head like radio waves, spinning his head for he claimed to see her standing in each and every corner as they ran. "Where are we going?" Harry called out of breath. His feet no longer seemed to move, for it felt like he was flying.
"Because I want to get to know you?"
The silhouette walked closer through the damp air – his white form falling down like a cloak.
"Your Father?" Harry replied almost baffled. "Proud? Ever? Look at yourself! Look at what he's done to you!"
Madam Pomfrey came waltzing in with her hands held high as she cried.
'What did you do to my suit!?' Draco sneered as he scowled. Harry took this perfect opportunity to scan him from head to toe, and titled his head after cocking it.
"Protect what? Me? Seeing you with Hermione doesn't do shit to me compared to everything that happened to me in the past. I'm actually quite happy for you even."
"Why did you come back?"
"Aren't you a little bit too old for that?" Harry raised his hand to cover his eyes - the sunlight forcing him to frown. Draco laughed in silence - the cap of his robe covering his forehead as if he didn't wish to be seen.
Harry looked him in the eye, startled, and did not reply. Snape, in the meantime, turned away as if he wished to mind his own business, and let them be.
"I never had a choice." Harry looked up at his white haired friend, and remarkably enough; smiled. "You do. You don't have to do this."
"See you later, Potter." Draco buttoned up his blouse, and made himself ready to leave – the gate crumbling in view.
Draco turned his back on him, biting the tip of his nails – cursing because his breath became short. "Shut your mouth." Grabbing the roots of his hair, he rushed towards the mirrored window. "You know nothing about me. I have no choice!"
"I want you," Draco answered. "Right here, right now."
"Let's deal with this," Harry breathed as he allowed his wand to slide down his sleeve into his hand. He quickly pointed at him, biting his tongue to keep himself from exploding. "Get up," he demanded. "Get up and grab your wand."
Dumbledore walked closer and put his hand onto Harry's shoulder as he tried to look him in the eye. He seemed worried.
"I got to go, though," the blonde muttered as he rapidly got up from the mattress – fetching his clothes in haste. "Professor Snape wishes to see me before noon."
It was obvious. Draco appeared from behind a corner, and seemed to be pretty beaten up. Harry cocked his head, surprised by his finding, and raised his brows – his question stuck to the back of his tongue.
Hari reached up for a hanger.
Hari chuckled awkwardly, “Well I was going to ask you out on a date, but I…um have nothing to wear.” Hari said embarrassed.
A little more than twenty minutes later, Draco wandered into the kitchen timidly, not knowing what to expect. He was dressed, hair shiny and slicked back out of his face in a neat ponytail, and skin smooth and glowed by the light of the gas lamps by the narrow staircase leading into the basement. Hari was behind the stove, busily preparing food. Draco's jaw dropped. He had never even seen a house-elf cook let alone a wizard. Hari glanced over his shoulder unimpressed at Draco. Before turning around with two plates in hand. Placing one plate in front of Draco, filled to the brim with eggs, sausage, and toast, and another in front of himself, Hari sat down in a chair directly across from Draco.
landing was the master bedroom that Andromeda claimed as her's and Teddy's. There of course, was a generously sized en suite bathroom. This room use to be Walburga's room and even the Hippogriff Buckbeak's at one time. Andromeda knew about the old occupants but never complained to Hari about it. Once Teddy was older he would have the smaller second bedroom on this floor as his nursery and bedroom. It was once the room Ron and he once shared.
"What were you saying about the Malfoy's?"
“Litha is celebrated outside, once the first ceremony is held, it is an outdoor celebration with another ritual at solar noon, dusk, and then the final ritual at the zenith moon.” Andromeda explained.
"'ello 'Arry, you're doing better, yes?"
With another chuckle of his own, Hari took the shirt he let fall to the floor. He had always been self-conscious about his physique, always comparing it to the older Quidditch players on the Gryffindor team or Cedric and Viktor during the Triwizard tournament. Draco was taller than him and had broader shoulders and a narrow waist, giving him the perfect ‘V’ shape. Hari was on the short side, scrawny, with a bony and scarred chest, and his torso was straight like a board with no definition like Draco’s. Hari was used to wearing clothes too large for his frame, but while Dudley’s swallowed him whole, Draco’s floated over his body and kind of draped comfortably loose over his skin.
It was only the first day of living with Hari Potter. What would the future bring for them? Draco thought as the heat built in intensity in his abdomen, in his throat, in his heart. He was losing a battle of wills between his alpha and its rut, and his consciousness.
Until something happened that would change his life forever. Harry couldn't explain what
Draco’s ears perked up as he caught a melodic sound on the wind. He strained his ears and eyes to try to find the source of the sound in the garden below. Shocked, Draco’s eyes widened. Hari’s lips were moving.
------
Only then did Draco let go of Hari’s hand and wrapped it around the shaft of Hari’s erect penis, mouth suctioned over the erect head,
As Draco gathered the numerous featherlite bags in each hand, Hari used the opportunity of free hands to pull out his willow wand to unlock the front door.  Another wave of the willow wand and bronze lamps tarnished green cast the long hallway in dim light.
“You will find” Ollivander spoke, “That who we decide are “respectable” has no effect on the wands choosing to who its partner shall be. The wand chooses the wizard, always, silly chit. We merely provide the venue. Mr. Malfoy is welcome here. A wand shall choose him, or not. If that were to occur, then I shall recommend him to another wandmaker. No wizard shall ever be turned away.” His milky silver eyes starred dead into his nieces’ eyes. “Remember that Sasha, Natalia.” He said mildly as he scooted around them to the front counter.
“It’s rude to point, and if you must know…” Draco sniffed. “Yes.” He admitted haughty, as if daring Hari to say more. Hari’s eyes glinted.
“Yes it is the hereditary curse that keeps adult witches and wizards from preying on underage kids and is the reason why you always pull away when things get intense between us. I can’t wait until my birthday, so I don’t have to stop at the good part.”
"I'm so signed your name on the next round, Hari." Alice chimed in from snuggling on Sheryl's other side.
"Secondly, the item you took was a dark artifact that was actually corrupting the magic of the ley lines that the bank was built on, when you removed it many of gringotts natural defences were strengthen as was the magic we goblins possess. I ensure you, breaking in to and getting away with stolen treasure will not be possible in the future, by anyone, let alone you again." The chieftess gave Harry a stern look, and Harry had no control of his facial muscles as he gave an impish smile in return, before grimacing.
, sweet and innocent, just waiting for some wolf to gobble him up. “You hungry, sugar? I’ll fix you up something real nice” Hari’s stomached took that moment to growl so loud that the shopkeeper hiding behind a rack of clothes concerned for her merchandise, laughed giving away her hiding place. Hari jumped and twirled not expecting the sound and not have seen the tiny woman.
“Circe, Hari…I didn’t mean that…I am not embarrassed to be seen in public with you.  No…It would be shameful for me, because it means I cannot provide adequately for you as a suitor. So…so…wear something of mine for now, let’s go shopping and you let me pick out your clothes.  I can’t afford extravagant things right now, so…it’s the least I can do.”
He wouldn't starve in his cupboard for once. Because Harry Potter could do magic. Yes. Magic.
He opened his mouth over the sweet tempo of Hari’s pulse point. Hot breath, moist lips, wet tongue. Hari shuddered and moaned as Draco licked and sucked a bruising hickey into Hari’s flesh. A visual mark, less permanent than the bite, but a clear declaration that Hari was his, nonetheless.
Draco had long since left Hari to potter around in the gardens alone, electing to take a hot soak in the tub and rinse his hair before the mud dried. Hari only gave a little shrug.  Hari couldn’t really fault Draco his vanity. Draco was used to a certain standard of living, having grown up pampered with the finer things of life. He knew Grimmauld Place was not as grand as the family Manor, and surprisingly Draco didn’t complain, much. Oh, he was still a snob. That Hari knew. But Hari also knew that Draco was trying to curve his ways. So, Hari curved his tongue in turn, and didn’t make the scathing retort he wanted to about his daily grooming ritual.
Many security measures are put in place to keep out would be thieves. For the lower security vaults a simple key is required. Medium security Vaults require a goblin to open the vault and if anyone other than a goblin tries to open the vault they would be sucked in. Higher security vaults require a goblin to open the door and may have a powerful creatures guarding the entrance, like Dragons or Sphinxes. They could also have a multitude of enchantments placed on the items inside the vaults, like the
On the
Harry shrugged, he wasn't going to argue, he can see the fairness of the goblins actions, it was all neatly and easily listed, and summarized at the bottom of the top document. As long as his friends didn't get punished for what was his idea anyway he was fine with however much he had to pay. Turning the page over, Harry nearly swallowed his tongue at the amount of galleons in millions listed in his vault. Ocean waves crashing into his eardrums was loud in his ears as he faintly hear the chieftess continue.
Hari sighed, “Okay a kiss on the lips in exchange for you letting me read your journal. I'll return it at breakfast."
“I call dibs on the brunette.” Her colleague called before she could as she dashed away from the counter, leaving her manning the helm to pout. The floor manager would kill them if they left the register unmanned.
“I so swear.” Hari said again gritting through the tightening and loosening of the magical bindings.
He clapped his hand and startled the four other occupants in the shop. He rushed around the counter, and eagerly turned the sign in the front from “vacant” to “occupied”. Mr. Ollivander only catered to one patron at a time, in this case three; Draco, Narcissa, and Hari. “Let’s start with your mother, I sense her magical signature on you, ooh a signet ring, quite fancy.” He said when Draco handed over the ring.
Especially, third and fourth year. He was a mess of teenage hormones and anxiety. His aversion of the topic didn’t help when he shared a dorm with four other curious boys. He wasn’t a prude in any definition of the word, but he felt like these topics should be private--something he simply never had.
“Do you acknowledge an heir?” Andromeda inquired with an eyebrow raised and half smile.
“Eh bien, maintenant tu sais. Now, to woo the stubborn git."
It was a bloody disaster. First the tight leather skirt restricted his movement, unlike Hogwarts lady's skirt uniform, he had to now unzip and try without the skirt on. Then he discovered that he couldn't stand and get the bloody things on. So sitting in lacy black nickers on a overturned crate, he rolled up the toe, slipped it on and pulled up mid thigh. Not daring to sigh in relief, he's heard Pans curse up a storm for tearing her stockings before, he proceeded to do the same with the other leg. Standing gingerly he tried to pull it higher but had to stop mid thigh. Once again he had to stop and think, before closing his eyes and accepting his fate. Grasping them around the waist, he tugged, and pulled, and stretched, even bleeding hopped to get the stockings up to his navel and snapped it in place. He was ashamed to realize he was out of breath and worried the others would hear him from outside. Panting slightly, he once more zipped up the skirt.
“Dear old grant-tante Walburga. Is she as awful as mother always said she was?” Draco asked. It took Hari a moment to wrap his head around the french word for great-aunt, but once he registered the question, he nodded his head with vigor.
"Mi casa es su casa." Alleycat says.
"So?" Hari asked.
is a powerful hereditary spell, or rather a curse that is effective against pedophiles, but not so much against teenage love. To get around it, all you have to do is…ask for consent”
“Hello cousin, Sirius.”
left Draco and Narcissa alone to
Draco Malfoy silently strode up the gravel paved walkway of the manor house he once considered home, but no more. The only reason he was there was because he needed to gather his possession, and settle his affairs before his creatures inheritance came in at midnight on his eighteenth birthday. It was only twilight of the day of the trial, which means he had exactly ten days. Only ten more days and then he will never have to step in this living hell ever again.
Hari’s tanned face blanched of colour, “That could happen?” He whispered hoarsely.
Hari fell back on his
"Who is it?" A growling voice shouted, hidden behind the closed door.
"Whew! Thanks, Mrs. Tonks. Sorry for the intrusion. I don't have much privacy these days, can't be too careful." He flicked the hood off his head, untied the string at his throat and swung the Invisibility Cloak off his shoulders. "May I hold 'em?" Harry asked holding out his arms to the swaddled and still wailing baby.
Will Hari find out about it, and when?
Draco took the opportunity to whisper in Hari’s ear. “Hari, love." Draco tried, "You have to know something.  The reason I pulled away was not because I didn’t want to go baby clothes shopping, but it was because I had too. I realize, now more than ever your ignorance of the wizarding world, but in our world there is something called
The sisters exchanged grim looks, before Andromeda answered. "My sister... sent out invitations to Lucius' colleagues and close family friends."
Draco wiggled one pale brow. Nodding Hari reached for the bag. Lassoing it around his head first, he tossed it into the fire, black bag crackling as it caught fire.
“Er, you didn’t poison this, or anything did you…you know to get back at me for casting the killing curse at you, and all?” Kreacher’s bat like ears flapped, his big eyes narrowed, and his large nose crinkled affronted. Before he could open his mouth to dignify that offense with a reply, Harry said in a rush, “never mind,” and swallowed the small amount of liquor in one gulp…and regretted it immediately.
This virus attacks your lungs, symptoms include a consistent cough and fever over 38°C/100°F.
Draco wasn't sleeping. He sat in the windowsill, moonlight casting over him with ethereal beauty. Light and shadows played across his face sketching cheekbones in sharp contrast. For the second time that day, Hari was enthralled by the sight of Draco Malfoy. His limbs were so long and elegant draped across each other. In adolescence he would have said Draco features were pointy; pointy nose, pointy chin, pointy ears. But know his features seem sharper. High cheekbones, a strong jawline and with high brows, gives Draco Malfoy an aristocratic look. The smug bastard would say, it’s all in the breading. His skin was flawless, pale and smooth, it glowed like alabaster in the moonlight, his hair gleamed like spun silver. Even his blasted feet where pretty; narrow feet, high arch, and long toes.
“Hey, kid. Stop. Which store did you come out of? Your parents need to keep a better eye on yuh, you could have gotten killed.” Draco was dragged to the other side of the Leaky Cauldron, this time a records shop, Draco could at least identify the vinyl disks on display.
Secondly, his relatives did not believe in magic. Magic did not exist. Period. Exclamation mark. End of discussion. The 'm' word was forbidden in his relatives house. Saying the 'm' word would earn Harry a one way trip to his cupboard.
Draco noticed that they were on the last flight of steps, and realized Hari hadn't mentioned which rooms either of them were sleeping in.
“There’s no problem, I’m paying.” Hari said, almost captivated by the direct stare Draco was giving him. Draco had never looked at him like that before. It was a look he imagined the Marauder’s gave each other; friendly challenges, dares, and mischievous fun.  Draco’s never directed that look at him before. He’s looked at him with loathing hatred, disgust, mockery, even pain and fear, but never as friends. It was new. Hari felt his own competitive nature rising. He knew he could finish within an hour, but he was curious about how far he could push Draco into eating.
Rushing from the kitchen she hurried to her son. Her tall and very wide son ran into Petunia's arms, burying his pudgy face into Petunia's nearly nonexistent bosom, wailing "Mummy."
charm.
Draco advanced up his body.
Harry was slumped against the door, breathing heavily. He looked up at Andromeda with a shy impish smile. Andromeda walked over, peeked out the pink crochet curtains, and watched the gentlemen depart in their muggle vehicles. She turned around and giving Harry a slow hand clap, highly impressed with his performance. "Well done Harry, love. You should have been put in Slytherin with that cunning act."
Harry does look amazing on a broom. He takes to a broom like a bird to the sky. He’s a natural. But his movements are so bold; he takes on the challenge like a true Gryffindor; with bravery. He flipped his broom in midair, catching the Remembrall right before it could crash through a window high within the East Tower. Potter was celebrating this awesome feat of bravery when Professor McGonagall came out onto the castle grounds.
I want to openly cheer for the Harry, but I am torn in two from what I want to do and what is expected of me. I am expected to cheer for Slytherin and show my house loyalty. Only Slytherin cheers for our team. The other three Houses will cheer for Gryffindor. Harry is Gryffindor. What is one silent voice in a sea of hundreds screaming fans? How I wish I were allowed to cheer him on as well.
“Okay Draco, here is the plan. Bill already withdrew gold from my vault, enough for everything we need and then some. That saves us a trip to Gringotts. Sometime soon we will need to sort out your gold issue. The Ministry still has not release their hold on your vault, but I intend to give you back possession of your gold, ‘cause it’s not mine. We go to Diagon Alley, I usually get swarmed so try to stay back, and the cloak won’t save you if a too eager witch bumps you. It’s not sound proof either. I’d recommend a silencing charm of some sort. Meet me at Ollivander’s.” Hari paused. “Draco?…Draco…Damn you, Malfoy. You prick.”
Be safe while I am gone. Blessed Yule, Harry.
"My godson is missing. He slipped out of the Leaky into the Muggle World." Minerva's mouth opened in a small 'o'. "He doesn't know his way, he has no money, and anything could happen."
And in her betrayal, Melusine gave a mighty shriek, transforming into an equally mighty alabaster dragon and flew away taking her two youngest children back to the wild with her, leaving the eldest with her husband.
“Oh, oh wait. I got this, run into certain death and survive? Or—ow!” Hari hit his arm none too gently.
"Sirius Black, my cousin, was your godfather." Andromeda asked as she gave a tiny flick of her wand and said, "Pack" the drawers and wardrobe opened to allow for the escape of dozens of clothes items to zoom around, fold and pack themselves in multiple compartment chests, and spare suitcases.
“Hari, when I took you shopping…” He began only to be interrupted by Hari.
Draco roared outrageously with laughter. Hari snickered after a moment of stunned surprise, and Teddy squealed in delight, his Hair turning a bright gumball pink.
Arlys giggled, "Its best be in your cups when the singing begins."
Hari appeared to be in deep thought with brows furrowed. He twisted the hand over with a slight twist of the wrist. Draco sweatdropped as he waited for Hari's response.
During these grievous times, we offer the highest respect and dignity to the dead and surviving family.
“Shove it.” Laughing, Hari flicked a finger across Draco’s right ear, before smoothing his hand through Draco’s hair and sat down to his left. "Narcissa suggested I make a sizable donation to a Ministry fundraiser to smooth their quill feathers."
Hari slipped into his room, letting out a relieved breath when he heard the click of the door shutting. What to do? He couldn’t deny that he was flattered by Draco’s confession. He didn't feel disgusted, about a boy confessing to him or that it was Draco Malfoy who did the confessing.
Hari’s whole body froze. Even in his limited experience, he knew to be wary of those words. “Talk? Talk about what?”
You are all so amazing and supportive. Thank you, Kamilia_Rosa for leaving my one thousandth one hundredth kudos. (1.1k kudos).
Draco retaliated by nipping with sharp teeth, drawing a drop of blood on Hari’s lips. He yelped and jumped back panting for much needed oxygen.
which smells like snow. As is, Hari smells like the outdoors, as he potters around in the garden often enough that these smells cling to him and he would bring these scents into the house. Draco had no doubt in his mind that Hari has creatures blood, how could he not being the scion of the Noble House of Potter, but it was unclear what he would present as. He just as easily present as beta, scion be damned. Only in Draco's wildest fantasies could Hari present as the rarest male omega, which would be a dream come true for any gay alpha like himself.
Draco didn't care about those scars, he strangely enough charisted those scars over the one his father gave him after one of his rare rage induced beatings. Hari wouldn't know about any of those."Well...Potter, I'm alive." Draco said. "I thought we moved passed this." With a sudden tired sigh, Draco listed his right elbow to cover his eyes as he leaned back into the couch.
It was Sheryl’s turn to stop the ridiculous interrogation. "Stop! It’s a legitimate religious practice and we won't make fun of the boys, I mean queenlings about it."
My godfather could be rather intimidating; even I try to avoid his wrath as much as possible. But I think he treats Potter rather unfairly. I mean, really? Why would a normal eleven year old wizard know, what adding powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood will do? I knew, but Severus was my private tutor and he had a fascination with lilies as long as I knew him. He was a bit unfair though, Potter was obviously taking notes, when Severus called him out for not paying attention.
Hari listened more intently than ever, his pulse racing. Hari felt momentarily affronted when Draco called him, loud, stubborn, foul mouthed, and sarcastic. The sting of the way he dressed already lessoned.
“Upon my sons sixteenth birthday, he was forced to take the Dark Mark, with an assignment to finish his initiation into the ranks. He was given two tasks to complete before he finished the school year. The first was to repair a Vanishing Cabinet somewhere in the school, to link it with its pair in a shop in Nocturne Ally; from there Death Eaters could then enter Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The second task was to kill the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. I was aware of both tasks.” Narcissa continued in a rush to implore the Wizengamot. “But my son is not evil, he is not a murderer. He couldn’t do it. I did everything in my power to make sure that Draco wouldn’t have to live with the stain of blood on his hands. I went to Severus Snape, Draco’s godfather.”
"Fine, but I will be up and listening. You need help controlling yourself, call ta mère."
Please give a HUGE round of applause to my beta reader, Q.
Harry thought as he poured his uncle some coffee.
With a red hair whip, the song was over and the crowd was still cheering. The song was really catchy and he knew if he didn't catch himself, he'd find himself humming the lyrics to himself later.
"Empress Suiko, singing Rupert Holmes,
This reminded him horribly of the time he had a similar incident whilst at Hogwarts. He had panicked and snuck into the shared toilet to rinse out the mess in the sink. He remembered thinking he’d be caught and hackled mercilessly by his dormmates. But he managed it without getting caught.
Draco, feeling Hari tense, looked up. Hari was no longer looking at the book, he was staring at Draco, or a part of Draco. Uncertain as to what Hari could have possibly been staring at, he glanced down at his bare feet.
as he was a full consenting adult and Hari was a minor still, but a month away from his full inheritance, if he had one.
Blaise's hard thin line was answer enough. Draco sighed looking away and around him for any sight of Hari. But he hadn't left the corner shop yet.
“For Merlin's sake, Potter, you won’t be allowed inside once the first ceremony has started; not even to use the loo.”
Hari nuzzled against Draco’s shoulder. “You, Draco Malfoy, never cease to amaze me with your wealth of useless and at times useful information.” He whispered against his neck.
He crunched eagerly into a crisp and tasted of oily corn crisps, salt, and fake cheese. They were addicting. After the first crisps, he ate another, and then a third.
Hari continued the tour from where he left out, with just Draco, Narcissa and little Teddy tagging along for the ride. He explained to Narcissa about the spectre and not being able to use the front door until the Curse Breaker could come by later that week to get rid of it, and explained the houses defences, including Ashur, and introducing them to the rest of the snakes in residence. When Hari spoke parseltongue, Draco was prepared for it this time. He noted the differences in cadence Hari had from the Dark Lord. Instead of cold and spine chilling, Hari's hissing was warm and caused a different type of tingle to go up his spine.
The kitchen was a cavernous room with a large fireplace at the far end and Iron pots and pans hanging from the ceiling, and a long wooden table sat in the middle of the room which served as the heart of the Order of the Phoenix meetings.
Many people would have said the Malfoy heir was a more youthful version of his father, Lucius Malfoy, but they would be wrong. Standing shoulder to shoulder as mother and son stood now, it was undeniable the likeness. They both shared the same aristocratic high brows, sharp cheekbones, with a pointy nose and chin.
"You!" The door swung open to reveal a purple faced man with a walrus sized mustache. The color drained away and the man was left with his mouth sputtering.
31 October 1991
"Sirius, no!"
"Won't you?" Sheryl chuckled. Draco scowled impressively with dark painted lips and narrowed eyes. He made a point to leave the nickers on the chair when he went behind the curtain.
Hari hid a gag at the look. He shifted his eyes to the-
I hope Slytherin wins. I hope Harry doesn't get hurt or die.
20 January 1992
Currently retching into a bucket, Harry couldn’t make out Kreacher muttering soothing nonsense, like “there-there, ‘ol Kreacher’s got Master Harry. All’s all right. Let all that poison leave your body. Kreacher’s going to make you better now.”
a home,’ Harry mussed as he waited for traffic to clear so he could reach the as of yet, nonexistent wrought iron gate surrounding the tiny steps leading to the front door of the townhouse.
Once inside Draco didn't have to hunch over. A grown wizard could have easily stood in here. Spacious it was, but Draco could still see that the walls were made of found or used blankets and tarps, cushions stood as the only furniture, beside overturned milk crates and cardboard boxes. An area was designated for sleeping with lumpy blankets and a few chicken feather stuffed pillows with feathers sticking out here and there. Tin cans and glass jars with food floating inside was the only indication of a kitchen area. There was even a tea kettle battered and dented.
“Goodness no, Corbeau. Not just because you are my cousin’s godson. We are related by marriage a few generation’s back. Tante Dorea married into the Potter line, so that makes her your arrière-grand-tante, great-great aunt.” Narcissa supplied.
“Master Harry be destroying Mistresses things, filthy half-breed master be ruinses the house” Kreacher croaked out. Twirling on his heels, head cocked, teeth bared, and wand raised in his right hand, Harry saw Kreacher standing on the first landing of the grand stairwell directly across from the front door. On the wall meeting the stairs, shrunken house-elf heads were mounted on the wall on plaques.
------
Draco groaned, remembering what was to happen next. Hari looked uneasily before the three relatives. “Wh...what is it?”
Perfectly ordinary. Yes, that's what her and her family were. And she wouldn't have it any other way. So, after reading the letter she, scoffed and promptly threw it in the rubbish bin and went about tending to her own month old son, Dudley. In her opinion, her son was the perfect cherub, with chubby cheeks and golden curls.
The first shop Hari decided to enter, Draco nearly baulked at the sheer amount of sleeveless thin cotton shirts and blue denim trousers with ripped knees. It wasn’t to his taste at all. Draco wouldn’t be caught dead wearing such grunge Muggle clothing.  “Look Draco I need more casual clothes for everyday use. Everything I own is old, hand me down, and washed out. Let’s go in and look around. We’ll try somethings on and you can make the final decision, alright?” Hari pleaded giving Draco a crooked smile and batting his gorgeous green eyes up at him. Draco sighed and opened the door for Hari.
"Pollycocks. Ey know the lad lives 'ere. Dropped em off 'ere, ten years ago."
"No, Hari is waiting for me." Narcissa stared at her stubborn son. He had a wild, desperate look to his eyes. He wouldn't budge on this, she knew.
"I am sorry, your mother had to go through with all that." Hari squeezed his hand in sympathy. Draco retaliated by snuggling into Hari's side, wrapping arms, legs, and tail around Hari.
"People would say my father, but I would like to think sometimes I look like my mother." Draco responded hoarsely.
“I’m sorry. Kreacher, I’m sorry!” Harry sobbed into the faded carpet at Kreacher’s feet. Only standing at three feet tall, he could only just see over the top of Harry’s bowed head. Kreacher was patting his distraught master shoulder.
When the war is over
"And Salazar Slytherin's Locket, and the Lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw" The Chieftess added helpfully.
. Once more he resumed pacing in tight circles.
Saturday at midnight at the top of the Astronomy tower. Okay, so I was getting attached to the little Ridgeback, now the length of my torso. It grew so much with MY aid. But now, she will be going to Romania with people who could properly take care of it.
"You say allegedly. What do you mean?" Hari asked.
Hari stopped by the shed, banging both fists overhead and bowing his head.
He then underlined the word kiss.
Draco shuddered at that thought;
. Hari had a point, but the rest of the world didn’t feel the same. He felt it was his duty to inform Hari of this fact; it would be a long uphill battle with the public, otherwise. Already, people are outraged that Draco didn’t at least get a lifetime in Azkaban for his crimes.
Making his way into the kitchen earlier than arranged, he paused at the entrance in surprise, letting the door to the stairs swing quietly closed behind him. Andromeda was already up with a fussing Teddy in her arms, warmed bottle to his squirming mouth.
Hari slotted his knee between Draco's and his hard cock rubbed against his blessed-and cursed limp own. Hari moaned as he began fronting against Draco. Draco groaned at the filling. Although his extremities were going numb, he enjoyed to intimacy.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Harry watched in mild fascination as the tomcat grabbed the scruff of the molly with sharp teeth, and mounted her furry back. They both growled and yowled, and the tomcat humped her vigorously before letting her up. The molly then began rolling around on the ground, got up and tried to streak away, but the tomcat was on her again, pinning her down. The process starting all over again. Then another Tom made it into the alley.
Can't help feeling nothing more than sadness
Do you think the animal portrayed on each of the Founders house crest represents a Patronus or an animagus?
When I refused his friendship during first year he set out to make us rivals, and did everything in his power to humiliate my friends and I. He would taunt and ridiculed my closest friends and me; making fun of how poor Ronald Weasley was or call Hermione Granger "Mudblood". He ridiculed my looks, my clothes, my grades, called me Scarhead, taunted me about my dead parents, or took advantage of how Dementors affected me. He would try to sabotage my potions assignments, cause me to lose House points or recieve detention. He made ridiculously badges during the Triwizard Tournament, leaking false information to the press, and attempted to hexed me behind my back on one occasion. He got me suspended from Quidditch during fifth year, and nearly got me expelled once or twice. However, petty school boy rivalries and bullying does not make a very good Death Eater.
"Your sloshed, Dray. Absolutely wasted!" Hari giggled.
“Gay? I am aware."
, they spoke of was their nickname for him.
"It's drag..." Hari said uncomfortably.
Hari stood for only a moment, stunned silent, wet hair dripping into startled wide green eyes, and glasses barely perched on his nose. Draco waited a heartbeat, then another, thinking perhaps he took the jest too far and Hari might be angry, then…
Harry pushed around aunt Petunia, who overbalanced and tumbled sideways to the floor still stuck in that position. Taking her purse off the side table near the fridge, he ruffled through her wallet. He heard a muffled shout behind him. He turned to face his aunt, to hear muffled sounds coming from her snarling unmoving lips. Shuddering, he continued with his mission-pilfering money from his aunts purse.
Draco's pre-rut is 'cumming' to a close and he feels absolutely disgusting covered in sweat and dried cum. Plus, I promised one reader a shower scene. Enjoy.
"We'll have to take him."
While Draco was struggling with his costume in the make shift dressing room, Hari was getting dressed out here with the assistance of C'iemone and Sheryl.
"This is my study. And I do mean mine. You can pass through to get to the garden but if I catch you in here uninvited, I will curse your bollocks off." Draco gulped inaudible, knowing that that could very well be a possibility as Draco did not yet have a wand. Hari turned around and smiled to himself, knowing that that threat was perhaps an empty one, but perhaps the warning might give him some privacy. "If you want to pass through, you must knock three times before opening the door, and you have sixty seconds to get to the outside, before you get a nasty shock that might leaving you pissing your pants." This was not an empty threat, as he requested this defence added on by Bill Weasley. When Draco sped up his pace, Hari laughed at him. "It is not active when I am in here." Draco frowned at him.
Hi guys and gals,
Does he really not know the answers, or is he shy?
“If you sssay ssso.” Was the snake laughing at him? Harry couldn’t be sure, but it seemed as if the snake was patronizing him.
Warning: Child abuse!
“Lovely, but I don’t think Draco can eat as much as I.” Draco was stumped. How could a restaurant stay in business if it gave away its food for free?
With a frustrated huff he said, "Never mind." He decided to use his newly acquired healing skills instead. Pulling up the blood-soaked sleeve, Hari revealed the self-inflicted cut. Draco flinched but didn't complain.
Hari's throat tightened as memories of sixth year swam into mind, Draco sprawled on the bathroom floor with blood soaking through clothes and floating in inch high water around him. Hari's eyes prickled with tears. "I'm sorry." He choked out once.
"You have to be lying." Hari said in drunken disbelief. He didn't know why he said it. Hari could tell that Draco wasn't lying.
“But Master Harry Potter, Sirs, we are in Grimmauld Place, yours study. Kreacher emphasized this with a firm head nod, big wing ears flapping humorously.
The witch with big yellow hair and abnormally large white nails saw Hari and dug said nails into the other witches arm, causing her to yelp. When Horrid red hair saw him in turn, they squawked and squealed over each other, and no doubt would have clambered over the counter if it wasn’t for Hari’s quick lifting of a halting hand.
It is indeed a dragon egg. From the shape and size of the egg, female. Mon Mère says, female eggs are always larger. It can barely fit in the oaf giant paws. They egg was black so my first instinct was a Ridgeback, but I hadn't been studying up on dragonology like Mon Mère, so I couldn't' be sure. But then it hatched, and it's a Norwegian Ridgeback.
Her scales were so flaky and itchy. Dragons do not shed their skin like reptiles, the mother has to burn them off. So when I had the all clear, I took my dragonhide gloves from my potion kit, and used them to place her in the hearth. If I had a more controlled environment, I would use
It's the thrill of the fight
"Hmmn...?"
Hari’s heart rate sped up. Draco’s said it. He’s said it before. …
"What do you mean? You're a wizard..."
"Thanks, Sheryl. Your table's ready for you. Ollie's coming over after second set, he says, if your still here."  Emmet says, sweeping his hand out towards the awaited booth.
"Sorry ma'am!" A stranger stammered out as he realized his close call with a baby. "are you okay?"
It took a moment for Draco to recognize the person in the mirror. He had to restrain himself from asking an asinine question as, 'is that me?'
“You’re used the past tense. You’re father’s dead then?” At Draco’s affirmative, Sheryl says. “It’s a hard lode to bare, crushing under the weight of your father’s expectation. But…” Sheryl sucked on her teeth. “It’s deadweight now, drop it.”
Draco had a sudden urge to capture this moment. Draco hadn’t mastered many silent spells during sixth years, too focussed on his doomed mission to assassinate Dumbledore, but one that saved him many troubles hiding from the other death eaters, carnivorous werewolves, and Voldemort’s snake, Nagini while in the Manor, was the summoning charm.
Hari seemed to be lost in the movement of the song. He wasn't particularly moving farther than a foot away from Draco at any one time, sometimes his hands around Draco's neck or on his hips. Although Draco had no idea how this was considered 'dancing' he had plenty of training in the formal ballroom dances. Sometimes Hari would grab his hand swing out and twirl beneath it if the mood struck, this was completely different than his training. Hari's body moving with hip pops and shoulder and arm shimmies.
"Where are your parents, Harry?" Nik asked kindly.
Draco frowned, "What?" Blaise pointed his chin across the way.
------
"I wouldn't say that, no. I have very fond memories with my sisters visiting here. The parties were not always such a bore. No from what I remember, there is a drawing room and secluded library for guests. Not as fine as the Black's family library, but nice all the same. And you of course know of the dining room for Order meetings, I know that much from Nymphadora's briefings, that girl was born to be an Auror I tell you." Andromeda's voice held fond laughter, despite the short amount of time it's been since her daughters death.
Draco planned on following Sheryl's rules explicitly. Firstly by not leaving Hari's side. Secondly by not allowing anyone to dance with Hari. He did this by pulling his lip up and snarling at a particularly pushy douche who tried getting in between he and Hari. Yeah, Hari wouldn't be going off with any strangers or accepting strange drinks that could have been poisoned with any type of substance.
Feeling chastised, Hari mumbled a hasty. “Sorry.”
Ooo, your kisses
"Hey, I didn't lose to a Hufflepuff, I lost to a Dementor who was trying to suck out my soul. And if I remember correctly, you dressed up as a Dementor, during one of my matches trying to sabatosh the game." Hari shot back.
“Not to the rest of the wizarding world, I’m not. This mark…” Draco rolled up his cuffs to reveal the mark. “…marks me guilty in the eyes of every witch and wizard in and out of the UK. Diagon Alley proves it. I am as visible to the world as you are. The Hero and the Villain. I can see the tabloids now. Being with me, it will taint you.” He turned his head away in shame as a high blush bloomed on his cheeks. His hand scratched in aggravation at his newly healed scars. Hari pulled Draco down to sit next to him, clutching his hands in a vice like grip.
"Yes this? Where did you get this injury from?"
That was two years ago, and now Sheryl stood in the exact same position waiting for the slightly older teen, nonetheless skinny with a mop of black unruly hair, to look at her. The tiny bruised teen had wiggled his way into her heart, and when he never returned after that outburst, Sheryl was worried something had happened to him, but she didn’t know where he lived, or how to get in contact with him. The only thing he knew was the tiny underweight and abused teen went to some private school in Scotland. But that wasn’t until September and it had only been July. Maybe his friends had come got him early? That was what she told herself.
Kreacher shuddered at the thought as he helped clean up Harry.
Additional security measures were put in place at the beginning of the Second Wizarding War when it became Headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix, by Albus Dumbledore.

Narcissa searched her son’s eyes and saw his resolve. “Perhaps I’ll have a talk with Hari as well.” She mussed, patting his face as his eyes widened with horror.
I suspect I'll be caned again. I don't want to return home for winter break. Father forbade me from staying, insisting to spend the quality family time for the Holidays. We do not even celebrate Christmas at the Manor. Instead we celebrate Yuletide for the winter solstice.
Her eyes laughed in merriment as she glanced between the two teens. A smile bloomed wickedly on her face. “You two certainly had fun on your date.” She crowed.
A familiar chuckle had Hari opening his eyes. Lips grazed over his pulsepoint. It wasn’t a dragon that loomed over him, but Draco. Draco who had him caged between his arms and an unseen barrier.
“I’ve already accepted the challenge. You’re paying, right?” When Hari nodded, he continued “Then what is the problem?”
Hari suddenly remembered, all the times Draco pulled away and the distinct time this afternoon where Draco poked Hari’s chest hard to make a point.
“Gentiment, madame, do not insult my mother again. I have known Hari since he was eleven years old. I know better than most that his attention is not gained by force. I won’t force him if that is what you mean."
"I'm sorry ma'am...uh...Chieftess, don't I just have the one vault?" Harry timidly spoke up, not wanting to invoke the goblin's chieftess wrath.
Draco wasn't listening though."That's a great idea. You make all the best decisions. I make the worse choices." Draco slumped a bit more, but then perked back up, nearly jostling Hari over the railing. "I know, you should make all my decisions for me."
with a deep V neck that hugged his body from neck to shin in alternative shades of soft beige linin. The jade scarabs collar necklace sat heavily over his shoulders. Sans Sheryl's icepick heels, Hari's golden sandals were laced up to nearly his shins.
"So that would be...that would be...thirty..." Dudley struggled with the math.
Draco was only a step behind Hari when they entered the dim lit pub, and did not expect to plow into him when he came to an abrupt halt once they crossed the threshold. Draco’s first instinctual thoughts were;
Please take my testimony into account and give Narcissa Malfoy née Black and Draco Lucius Malfoy the freedom they deserve. Their crimes, if any committed during the war was not so severe as to earn them even a year in Azkaban.
I do not have children, but I have my two wonderful niece (turns 3yo in May) and nephew (turns 1yo this month) who I love dearly, and take up much of my time playing and babysitting.
Harry thought bitterly to himself. But all Draco said was "fine."
"No! Well, er...yes, but I want you too. No that doesn't sound right." Harry was getting more and more flustered as he finally got down to trying to ask Andromeda to move in with him. Signing himself, and sitting back down in the cramped living room, peering in at Teddy before facing his quarry.
"Why are you asking me?" Hari asked. He knew Draco had his own friends. True, he hadn't seen them since May.
Draco's laughter was muffled against the pillows. "I will. Night Hari, love."
“Watch yourself, love.” Draco warns. “Eliana, is it?” Draco inquires. “That's a fitting name for a pretty girl like her. It means daughter of the sun.”
Draco presents as an alpha with his first rut and 'cums' into his creature inheritance. Is it any surprise about what creature that might be? No, no it's not. Is it any surprise about who Draco fantasizes about during his rut? Let's be honest here, you all came for the Drarry. This chapter does contain explicit rape/ non-con, but it's also only a dream.
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
"Merlin Balls, Potter!" Draco exclaimed loudly, voice echoing off the tiled walls, "Don't you have any decency. We share a bathroom, knock next time, won't cha?" Draco was flushed red, grateful that his back faced Hari.
"Soon enough, love." Draco said wiggling his eyebrow. Hari snorted. Pushing up from the table, he waved Alice toward as he and Draco followed her to the station.
Mon Mère told me a secret when she gave you to me. She said that it is okay to have friends, because I may be a Malfoy, but I am also her son, and an important member of the Ancient and Noble House of Black. One of the last legitimate heirs, too, no matter my name, the blood breads true.
meaning “Protect what is yours, because it does not belong to you if you cannot protect it.”
“What can this unworthy one do for Mistress Dowager Malfoy, and Master Malfoy?” Dot, the slanted eyed house-elf with polka dotted handkerchief tied around her ears, and red pillowcase tied in a strapless Hawaii style around her small body.
To keep them out, Harry would need some kind of barrier that would allow for him to open the windows at one point without them getting in. Remembering some of the spells used while hiding from snatchers, Harry cast first,
Intrigued Harry turned to the introduction and began to read.
Hari didn't even glance at Draco as he hurried into the bathroom, with just a towel slung over narrow hips. Draco stared fixedly ahead trying not to look at the tempting morsale at his mercy. He couldn't help but see from his peripheral vision, Hari's toned caffs, narrow hip bones covered by a white towel, and spiny vertebrae as he bent down to place his own clean clothes besides Draco's on the bench to the left of the tub, before stepping around the tub to turn on the spray in the shower behind fogged glass. Dropping the towel at his feet as he stepped beneath the spray.
“You don’t need her.” Draco blurted out angrily.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco throbbed. With every pulse of his rapidly beating heart, his hot and aching cock grew longer and thicker between his thighs. His pheromones rose, wafting in the air. He felt heavy in the air, hot and pungent like the black smoke of a fueled fire.
Blaise came out of his stumper to hug Draco enthusiastically, thumping him on his back.
"And I'm looking forward to the bottle of Chardonnay and a foot massage for Marry-Alice after I get out of these heels, but I expect all of us to have fun before then" Sheryl scolded.
Draco pointed a finger at his mother, “You’d think that…anyone at Hogwarts would say we hated each other. We fought constantly, I tried to get him into trouble many times, and I took every opportunity to make a fool out of him, but…”
It is for these protections, that Harry Potter found himself standing across the street of 12 Grimmauld Place nervously fidgeting with his hair, glasses, or raggedy clothes. It has only been two weeks since the Battle of Hogwarts, two weeks since Harry Potter killed Voldemort, two weeks since the Second Wizarding War has ended, and only two weeks since Harry Potter was hailed;
Also:
"Er...no Mrs..." Andromeda lifted her eyebrow impressively at him, "er...Andromeda, then." He ended on a long suffering sigh.
“Hari, I love you but you are not the brightest
How could one moment, one decision, one action define a person's whole life, or end it? How different were their lives from my own? I spent over a year trying to get inside the mind of a madman, trying understand him in order to kill him. I couldn't help but think that our lives were so similar and yet our actions, thoughts, and our choices were so different. How did we end up choosing the sides we did? What circumstances brought us to that moment in time, where we faced off as enemies instead of standing as allies. My mother sacrificed her life in saving mine. I remain alive today, to write this letter, because of another mother who chose to go against her own believes in order to save her son, and in doing so, saved my life as well. I owe her a life debt, but she also deserves a second chance. Not everyone deserves them, and some receive too many only to squander them.
Alice came out the ladies room to join them. She was dressed in a long, curve fitting, yellow and black striped sweater dress with tiny blue veined wings on her back. One the top of her head was a crown of yellow buttercups.
Draco’s face went carefully blank. He quickly took his hand away. His brain had taken a direct dive into the gutter. His dragon was salivating in his head and biting at the bit. He shuddered.
“Disowned?” She asked Draco taking a guess that he might have been so if he came out to his parents. Well-to-do Heterosexual father’s would rather disinherit their children and save face in the community rather than admit they have a homosexual child. She would no. When she graduated culinary school and opened Sheryl’s Place, she sent a letter to her baby sister with an airline ticket. It wasn’t her sister who came. John Mason was furious that he left the United States. After finding out his whereabouts, he hopped on the first redeye flight to confront his wayward son. Finding his prodigal son in drag was not what he expected. Her father cursed her out, calling her all kinds of derogatory and homophobic words, and finally ended with “You are not a child of God, and neither are you mine.” Sheryl expected the response, but back then she wasn’t as confident in herself as she is now. It hurt.
It was Draco. Draco is a dragon. It clicked. He dreamt this. A version of this anyway.
I am into champagne
Dear Journal,
Hari's protection. A sappy smile must have appeared on his face for Blaise paused in his talk.
Hari smiled then. He moved one of his arms to pillow behind his head, and kept the other anchored around Draco. He let his nose graze over soft, silky, hair. He planted a soft kiss on Draco's scalp and settled back. Draco let out a whine, "Cheat!"
“Did she keep their memories, or just
I did the sensible thing and ran. I thought Harry was right behind me. I guess not. I wanted to kick myself. Why didn't I push him ahead of me when we ran.
