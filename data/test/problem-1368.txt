It was a cold morning the grounds where fully covered in snow from the night before, and Draco had dragged himself out of his warm bed with great effort, it was only two days left and midterms where officially over. Hermione was beaming when he got to the great hall that morning, the stress of exams she had been carrying for the past couple of weeks had vanished and managed to turn her into a completely different person. She greeted Draco, wide smile and cheery voice, like she was determined to have the best day of her life, Draco could only wonder where she got her energy that early in the morning, he just groaned and took a sit.
Draco quickly scribbled a note on a piece of paper he found lying around and send the owl on her way. Then jumped out the window again on the old broom. it appeared to be getting strangely tired, if a broom getting tired was a thing that could happen. He flew to the hospital wing and peaked at the window. As if clockwork Hermione walked through the door panicked look on her face with Weasley limping but conscious hanging of her arm. That was enough for Draco who took off again and flew to McGonagall’s office.
The feast was grand as always, and Slytherin took the house cup. Draco encouraged his friends to cheer in the spirit of companionship or something stupid like that. He laughed the entire time and Hermione made him swear he would write during the summer, he thought it was unlikely but he would certainly try, and after that it was done, and he was in his dorm packing the last of his robes and scarfs into his trunk, full to the brim in crimson red, it didn’t look strange anymore.
“Professor, its Harry, the stone, and he went in all alone and it be dead, he thinks Snape is involved, and the dark lord and -- and -- and" he said frantically,
‘perfect another Weasley’ Draco thought to himself as he saw the Gryffindor prefect waiting for them by the door of the great hall after the feast was over. His head was still spinning and he barely heard anything anyone was saying, he only kind of managed to hear the password to the common room. Before he made his way up to his new dorm room finally, where his trunk was already set next to a bed, the green color of the Malfoy emblem on it made him sick. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go, and worst of all he was now sharing a dorm with, Potter, a Weasley and 3 others who Draco had not bothered to learn the name of at the moment.
“They are just rumors at the end of the day, right?” pansy said. It had been going around that Draco was friends with Potter Granger and Weasley. Draco had wanted to maintain the idea that they were merely on cordial terms in fear of his father. He was almost sure that he had already heard about the company Draco know frequented, and this worried him.
‘What did a stupid hat know anyway’ Draco thought to himself, he was still struggling to breathe, he didn’t know what to do. So, he just sat at the end of the table and tried to avoid all eye contact. He could feel all eyes burning on him.
“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Mistry grows more –” Draco was lost again on his own thoughts swearing something had just moved around at the back of the shop. Suddenly seeing the had perched on top of the fire place twitch.
“Excuse him Hagrid, he’s intolerable when he gets in a mood,” Hermione interrupted him with a sneer, Draco resisted the urge to hex her just out of propriety. he instead settled for looking at her furiously. At least he noted his discontent with the situation was shared with Weasley who was starting to look really green. Hagrid didn’t care.
It was all the Draco needed one interaction with Potter had been enough for him to decide it wasn’t worth making friends with him anyway. If he preferred to hang out with weasels let him. Finally the professor called out his name and he made his way confidently to the stool, the hat was placed over his head completely covering his eyes, when suddenly a voice resonated inside his head,
“Are you, all right?” said the centaur with a voice so deep it echoed on the threes around them, it helped Harry to his feet.
“I bet Flamel asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it,” Hermione said
“Just looking to find out who Flamel is you know,” Harry continued with a smirk. Hagrid just looked annoyed at them and looked like we had wanted to reprimand them but decided against it
“Right then, now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks” the half giant said, Draco could only think to himself ‘bloody wonderful’ as they followed Hagrid into the edge of the forest. The tall trees quickly surrounded them and he could catch a glimpse of the full moon between the deep net of branches that intertwined over his head.
(taken directly from the text: some dialog in the broom scene you probably recognize, a couple Peeves lines, and Hermione's iconic Line)
Weasley moved forward and the white queen attacked. She struck him hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor. Shaking Harry did his move and just like that the door at the end of the room sung open. Ron still lied unconscious on the floor.
“Not fully, from what I can tell he’s basically living of anything that he can, he’s not really capable of doing anything on his own” Draco explained.
(Taken verbatim for the text for this chapter are, Seamus's line in the great hall, and a couple of Hagrid's lines from the hut scene.)
“MR MALFOY WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING!!” she screamed opening the window, Draco just tumbled inside plummeting onto her floor.
“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up,” She shouted as all the students took their places next to a broom, “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!” and so they all did.
“it’s not Snape I’m telling you,” Draco interrupted, the rest of them just sort of ignored his comment as they often did when he tried to argue they were wrong. The four of them keep taking about the stone in whispers almost all the way up till diner time. Draco argued with Weasley about how ridiculous his ideas of what he would do if he had the stone where. To him buying a quidditch team, or a house were the least of the practical uses in his opinion.
“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” his father said, pulling Draco back to reality. “You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,” his father said taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket “I have a few items at home, well, I’m sure you understand” handing Mr. Borgin the list.
“okay, okay enough, down to business” she said. “we demand all the details of your recent adventure” she said, Blaise nodded and Draco again began his story for what felt like the million time.
blue fames shoot out of her wand catching onto Snape’s robe. She pushed Draco and they retreated into a corner far away. They sat against a wood beam, Draco then heard a yelp and knew Snape had realized he was on fire. “see” Draco immediately pointed at Potter still unstable in his broom. They saw confusion in the professors stands. Everyone pushing out of the way. professor McGonagall, sprout and Quirrell where pushed over by the sudden confusion. In that instant Potter was finally able to gain control of his broom.
As the clock stroke eleven the  four of them found themselves nervously pacing on the common room waiting for the final students to go up to bed.
“What if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” he said unable to keep the fear out of his voice. Hagrid just ignored his comment again, and it made Draco’s blood boil. the man simply kept talking
“I got lost” Harry whispered. He was covered in dust and his glasses where broken. “I was with the Weasley’s and they had me use Floo and I never had used it before and --  I don’t know why but I ended up here” potter whispered and Draco thought it was too much of a strange story to be made up.
They had gotten almost nothing but Lockhart books of what they came for but Draco didn’t dare ask his father anything with that look of anger on his face still as he apparated them back home.
Granger was nowhere to be seen when Draco entered the great hall, and he made his way to the Slytherin table as Halloween was one of the holidays where the students were allowed to share with other houses. He sat next to pansy who asked if he had heard that Granger had apparently been crying all day in a bathroom and questioned whether it was his fault. Not wanting to say that he actually wanted to defend her, he instead said proudly it was, and to his surprise lying to pansy made him feel a strange guilt. Draco keep scanning the hall with his eyes for any sight of Granger but the banquet was just about to begin and still no sing of her. The food suddenly materialized before him, strangely after a few months at the school it was starting to feel a little less exiting each time.
“Stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's LeviOsa, not LeviosAR!” Draco heard Granger screech at Weasley in exasperation. He smirked.
Eventually Draco had turned to the hobby of impatiently waiting for the arrival of his Hogwarts letter to at least have something to do and start skimming the books for the new term. So, when the brawny owl from Hogwarts fluttered to his window one evening he found himself snatching the letter and ripping the red was seal eagerly, he tossed away the usual address to catch the train on September first and skimmed over the book list perplexed.
“Mr. Malfoy” Harry muttered. “I – thank you for leading me all the way here but I better head off now Mrs. Weasley must be terribly worried” Harry said.
“Harry Potter,” The great hall went completely silent, the hat took what felt like an eternity and finally screamed “GRYFFINDOR,”
“Idiot” he repeated and him and pansy giggled again as Longbottom was escorted out of the class, Snape once again took points off Gryffindor but Draco didn’t care.
“Sorry I didn’t mean put you on the spot,” she said as kept walking up a flight of stairs Draco simply nodded. “Worried about going home then?” she said.
Draco stepped outside, the cold air of the night hit his face, his cheeks flushed red and he pushed his hair back, he had not bothered to comb it that morning and it was looking very rattled but he didn’t really care. He wrapped his scarf around his face and made his way to his mother. She looked happy to see him, almost too much in a way Draco had never seen. It was then the first time it occurred to him that this was the longest time she had gone in her life without seeing him, and perhaps foolishly he hadn’t considered that it might be hard for her. His father on the other hand was nowhere to be seen, this was nothing unusual though, he didn’t really see his father that often even when he wasn’t at Hogwarts.
"TROOOOOOOLLL” he shouted “in the dungeon,” he said as he fainted in the middle of the corridor. Panic ensued, but Draco could only think about the fact Granger had no idea there was a loose troll in the castle. Draco’s ears where ringing he didn’t know what to do. He heard the blood pumping in his head.
"I can’t in good conscience put you in Slytherin, you will see I’m right with time you are for sure a “GRYFFINDOR,” the hat shouted, Draco couldn’t believe his ears. It could not be right.
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading,” She said plummeting the book on the table knocking of all the chess pisses that scoffed annoyedly at her
(taken from the text - again Hagrids lines, and snape cus every line he ever said It's Just iconic. :))
“A bit,” he replied as they made their way up, “it’s just I don’t know what it’s even going to be like” he muttered “I can’t help but feel like they might act strange, plus, my dad has not said anything about the hole troll incident thing yet but I’m sure he must know,” he continued. “I just hope they don’t, like, assume anything,” he said finally as they reached the second floor.
From the dogs to the keys and the potions, to Flamel and the stone and the forest. He didn’t notice when but McGonagall made him tea and listened to the story with patience. Once he was done she told him to wait for her there, and she left without another world.
“Swish and flick, “suddenly the room filled with noise, the words Wingardium leviosa where said over and over again.
“I believe so for now, I’m working on it father,” he said again hoping this didn’t sound like too much of a lie. Nonetheless, his relived his father appeared convinced.
“In your eyes,” Draco said thinking back to Granger, Potter and Weasley, Pansy must have figured out what he was thinking.
“look” Draco was confused. He took the binoculars from Hermione. he saw Snape looking directly at Harry , to his surprise, it did look like he was putting a curse, but Draco knew it could not be, he couldn’t look anymore, as Weasley sized the binoculars from him. \“I’m telling you Hermione it’s not him,” Draco argued. Weasley just asked in panic
he felt a bit like a stranger in his own home, and walked slowly up to his room with an odd caution as if he hadn’t lived in that house for the past 10 years. He opened the door to find everything almost exactly as he left it. The elves had probably gone in that morning and whipped the dust off his things. A box of chocolates was placed at the edge of his bed, a welcome gift from his mother. He felt a sigh of relief thinking at least he would not have to face his father that night and plummeted into his bed with his jacket still on. He was called down stairs for dinner a few minutes later. His mother sat with him but didn’t ask many questions, as she figured he was tired, which he was. He appreciated her silence ate and went back to his room, finally letting the exhaustion set in, he fell asleep almost as soon as he steeled under the familiar bed covers and wondered if he could take them with him to replace the uncomfortable Gryffindor ones.
“I didn’t say that!” he said laying down a cup of tea on the table and refrained from speaking the rest of the evening.
“I – I understand you are busy father no need to apologize,” Draco said unsure felling suddenly very out of his ground
“Yeah, yeah I will too swear!” said pansy. “and don’t forget to write, because you barely owl'd me during Christmas break Malfoy” she said.
Lunch passed as usual his father relaying some occurrence at the ministry and his mother listening intently and offering her perspective on the situation when proper. Although this might sound boring, Draco had loved to hear about his father’s job, investments, and business deals ever since he could remember, perhaps there where a lot of things about his father he didn't quite understand but he knew for sure he was extremely cunning and smartly gifted for his work.
“but it’s – it's illegal” said Ron, Hagrid ignored him. “Hagrid in two weeks he will be as big as the house”  Ron said again. Hagrid was clearly getting annoyed.
By the time Friday arrived, Draco had made absolutely no friends or progress none the less it was finally the day was his first potions class and he couldn't wait. Since he was young the world of potions fascinated him and though he knew it would not be an easy subject he was so excited to start learning more. He had read every book on the subject he was allowed and he was thrilled heading in. Not even having the class with Slytherin was going to damage his good mood. He was slowly getting more accustomed to his red and gold robes, that morning he didn’t even hesitate putting them on, so perhaps thing where actually looking up for Draco after all.
“how was work,” she asked, his father started pacing the room. He still hadn’t even directed a look to Draco.
“I - I’m glad you are okay to” he muttered but hoped she got that he actually really did mean it. He cleared his throat “I saw both of them, they said they’ll be fine” he said this time louder  “Potter might not wake up for a couple of days still”  he noticed saying potter felt strangely different,
“yeah it’s a lot,” harry said. Draco just nodded and looked out to the grounds, One of the benefits of Gryffindor was definitely the views, Draco thought to himself.
“Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked, after a while, Draco notices the note of panic in Potters voice with delight, he also noticed the fact that Potter was trying to make conversation because he was scared.
“Ah, yes,” Snape said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new --- celebrity,”  looking directly at Potter. Draco was already pleased, finally Potter getting treated like he deserved. “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” Snape began  “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. … I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” He said Draco was already bursting with anticipation at the thought for being able to do everything that Snape had just mentioned.
“she really does” he said before he could consciously hold back words. Surprisingly this go a laugh out of Potter and Weasley. Afterwards the awkwardness set in there was an uncomfortable silence
Apart form that the day was uneventful, with exams all gone they didn’t do much in class, all that was left was waiting till the grades where given that Friday. So Draco got to spend most of his time thinking about his theory, trying to understand all the pieces like it was a giant puzzle. Everything started to feel like a giant plan. Someone had to allow the specific dark forest detention for them to see the unicorns, Hagrid telling them specifically what they needed to know but making it look like he didn’t mean to, Harry getting the cloak for Christmas. It all just made sense, they had though they were investigating and actually finding stuff, but actually they were doing exactly what they were supposed to be.
“well, well, this must be Miss granger” his father said putting his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Draco has told me all about you – and your parents” his father said pointedly Draco cringed inwardly. “Muggels are they?”
Weasley took the lead as the best player by far among them and assigned them each a piece, and the game began. Thus, did the smashing. pieces of stone flew across the room every few minutes, the air filled with dust, and Weasley keep screaming commands to the pieces without hesitation. Draco understood the final play almost as the same time as potter did.
He avoided her in the corridors when he was with the Slytherin crowd but other than that they mostly passed all their time together. However, that was not the strangest turn of events, instead it was that even if he could not quite call them friends, him, Potter and Weasley now had friendly conversations at dinner time and discussed quidditch every so often. He had never disagreed more with someone than Weasley and his quidditch teams, but, it was fun to talk about the leagues with his house mates they even made bets on the upcoming matches. The animosity still was present but it was reduced more to playful competition on stupid things, like getting a better grade on an assignment, or winning a chess match, rather than the ‘hate your guts, hope you get expelled’ thing it was before.
“Apparently not if they are made by something magical, or well that’s what Pomfrey said” there was silence for a moment “how else am I supposed to show everyone that I survived again anyway” he said mockingly, Draco chuckled.
As the minutes passed, they all kept talking and shouting, Angelina scored again, they all cheered, still no sight of the snitch. It was almost 20 minutes into the match and still no sight of the snitch, Draco was looking around with Hagrid’s binoculars when a strange movement cough his eye. Potter was zigzagging through the air, his broom looked to be making violent swishing movements. It looked like it he had lost complete control. Draco pointed up
“What the hell Potter” he sat up annoyedly. instead of seeing Harry's face next to Granger though Harry was already quite far into sprint towards Hagrid’s hut.
“The Weasley’s” Draco ignored the quick disdain that brushed his father’s features probably undetectable to Harry . “Very well”
“Figured as much, I’ll owl for your books and cauldron tomorrow darling” she smiled knowingly and poured Draco a cup of tea.
“Maybe, I don’t know as I said Dumbledore is a funny man, I don’t think we will ever really know what he intended unless he wants us to know” Harry said simply,
“son, I’m so glad to see you” she said releasing him, he smiled. “your father couldn’t make it” she apologized. He ignored the comment
“This is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I if my father knew I was doing this, he’d —” Draco protested again he notices a note of panic in his own voice. Hagrid just looked at him strangely, it was rather hard to read the man’s face.
Flitch merely spared them a disgusted glare as he signed them to follow him. The four of them followed, Weasley notoriously dragging his feet slowly falling behind the group as to let everyone know he was not glad to be there. Hermione on the contrary walked with perfect posture just behind filtch as if that somehow would somehow make her look like a better student. They marched off across the dark grounds, the cold of the night making Draco wish he hadn’t been so stubborn and left his scarf back in the tower. He wondered what their punishment was going to be, it must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be so thrilled. Ahead, Draco recognized the lit windows of Hagrid’s hut and marked they were headed right to it, and wondered once more what in the hell their punishment was going to be. He was just hoping to do some lines or maybe clean a trashed room, but as they approached Hagrid’s hut he worried that they might be in for something much, much worse.
Finally, it was morning and he got up as early as he could. He didn’t want any unnecessary interactions. He showered and then took his uniform out of his trunk and started to put it on, the green and silver robes, and ties he had already brought with him reminded him of his failures.
This final comment seeming a little strange but Draco brushed it off as another one of his father’s attempt to keep a close eye on Dumbledore, or some attempt to make himself more important; even perhaps an excuse to be around in his life more. This though made him feel  warmth inside as he headed up the stairs to his bedroom for the night feeling exhausted, the conversation about the dark lord running over and over in his head, his father’s severe expression and hushed voice vivid in his mind.
“Its Devil’s Snare!” granger said, Draco had never heard that name before. definitely hadn’t been covered in their herbology lessons that year. He cursed himself for never doing any of the extra reading.
“Touch nothing, Draco.” His father turned back to say to him before walking inside. “— ah, Mr. Borgin.” His father said greeting the tiny old man perched behind the counter,
Both Draco and Potter in what seemed like synchrony decided to do something arguably very stupid and took up on a sprint towards the troll. Ron followed closely behind them, the troll disappeared out of view as it knocked down the door of the bathroom and made its way in. Draco lead the way as the trio followed the troll into the bathroom, what they saw when they were finally inside was Granger against the wall opposite to the door, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her knocking over doors and sinks on its way.
The car slowed down as the lines of tress gave way and the full manor came into view. The towering windows and dark exterior gave the manor and ominous look. It, never the less looked smaller that Draco remembered, yet equally as intimidating as before. It was a strange felling to be home. He looked up to his window the curtains where drawn shut. The car came to a halt right in front of the porch. The doors of the car flew open letting on the cold air of the night. Draco shivered and stepped out of the car. He walked slowly up the marvel stairs to the craved front door that sung open as soon as he approached.
“Harry! Draco!, are you, all right?” Hermione shouted, she was running toward them followed by Hagrid and Ron a few meters behind.
“Very much so Miss. Parkinson,” he teased back, they laughed little too loud and got a few stares. The nigh went by very slowly he stayed with pansy most of the time yet it was hard to make this event feel anything but stuffy and boring, after speeches and a very fancy meal, Draco was excused to go to his own bed.
Still he tried to push them away and eventually he was finally excused after and endless round of hellos. He sat by Pansy who had also finally managed to slip away from the grip of her own mother.
He approached the table. And discarded the easy ones, he didn’t need to read to now the far left one was a very common poison. The one in the middle was wine according to the first clue, and the next to the left, by that reasoning was another poison.
“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as per usual.
“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” said Snape with a peculiar, twisted smile “You want to be more careful, hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something” he added and walked away.
“Wait, Granger,” Draco said following her. “What the hell do you think you are doing,” Draco said crawling behind her, she was shorter and moved faster than him, he was struggling to keep up. “Granger” he kept shouting as they made their way to a steps of flimsy wood stairs leading up the professor’s benches.
He still avoided Potter and all the Gryffindor’s for that matter when he was with the Slytherin crowd, but it had gone down from hating each other to mostly playful competition. Even Finnegan and Thomas were a little more tolerable now days. He no longer ignored everyone when they had conversations at night or shared sweets but instead joined in. nevertheless the nagging voice in his head of his father scolding him remained present as ever, and every time he found himself laughing at something Granger or Dean said at dinner time, he remined himself who he was.
“Now you want to talk,” Draco said indignantly pansy didn’t answer but rather got to work on the potion and Draco followed suit.
Their foots steps echoed as they walked. They reached an old oak door, Draco heard the sound of light fluttering, almost wing like inside and they all drew their wands, as they pushed it open.
“how do you…” Draco couldn’t help himself the words came out before he could stop them. “you went through my things,” Draco yelled, anger begging to set in.
“yes, please have lunch fixed, in the meantime I’d like to talk to my son,” he said. His mother understating, left the room quietly and presumably headed for the kitchen leaving Draco and his father alone in the dark lounge room.
They got into an argument the next evening in the common room, an ugly one, when Potter said he ought to stop jinxing other students just because he could. Blood boiling, he proceeded to insult Potter ruthlessly which basically left them in no speaking terms and of course the weasel and Granger both took Potters side on the matter. So, by the time of the detention rolled around Draco had managed to piss of every single one of his friends and gotten himself screamed at by the Ravenclaw prefect for hexing a second years books to scream at her. Needless to say, his mood had not improved.
“He thinks this door is locked,” Potter whispered “we are going to be okay,” he said. When Weasley pulled on his sleeve
“Abut’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All right?” Hagrid and flitch exanged a few more words Draco was too busy panicking to catch.
“Can I see him?” he muttered, She stopped what she was doing and looked at him with clear pity on her eyes, Draco hated it, but he didn’t let it show he kept making sad eyes instead hoping he could get some compassion out of her. She finally gave in and nodded. He jumped to his feet instantly and followed her, Pomfrey was a tiny witch, so much so that Draco even at eleven was only a few centimeters shorter than her.
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore” Potter said, as Draco heard the name he had a sudden moment of clarity.
They had apparently been in some passageway bellow the castle, He flew all the way to the Gryffindor tower and climbed through a window on the common room as fast as he could, it must have been about 3 in the morning, and Hedwig was sitting in the window still it was almost like she had been waiting for him.
“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch’ Come on, dear.” Draco heard madam hooch  and hurry away to the hospital wing.
“let’s go,” he whispered to Hermione before they could get in trouble, and they ran down back to the Gryffindor stands, just in time to see Potter speeding directly towards the ground following the little snitch. Hermione covered his eyes, it looked like Potter was going to crash directly into the ground for a second.  Draco saw him clasp his hand to his mouth as he motioned to pull his broom, he thought was about to be sick, as he rolled onto the field. Potter then coughed and the snitch fell onto his hand.  He then started frantically waving the ball around. It took a second to sink in they had won!
From the text: Hagrid's explanations of the detention in the forest, (can you tell writing hagrid is not my favorite thing) and a bit of Firenze's lil speech about Voldemort)
“whatever, it's getting late, better get ready for the feast” she said. The sun was setting in the horizon over the great lake. Draco felt a little sting in his heart as he realized his first year at Hogwarts was almost officially over.
“I’m aware” his father said as they turned another corner finally the loud noise of diagonalley could be heard and the warm light of the sun returned slowly.
Later, on Christmas eve he had dinner with his family more as a formality that anything and although as grand as ever he could not help but feel a bit alone. As the evening drew to a close he laid in bed and he thought about what Potter and Weasley might be up to at Hogwarts and slightly smiled to himself knowing they were probably getting into trouble as he drifted into a quiet sleep on that winter night.
They talked for what felt like ages to Draco, until his mother finally interrupted letting his father know food was ready. they Both left the room and as soon as his parents were out of sight Draco let his shoulders relax and he slumped in the couch thinking bitterly that if it hadn’t been in Gryffindor he probably would have told his dad everything. His father could be distant and cold, and was annoyingly old fashioned in terms of manners, always reminding Draco of all the old pureblood customs he was supposed to uphold as the Malfoy heir, but he also always cared to listen to Draco, and Draco wanted nothing but to make him proud ever since he could remember. The pit in his stomach grew thinking about letting his father down even further when he found out for sure that Potter was indeed never going to be on their side. Or the fact that his father would never approve his growing friendship with Granger and surprisingly Weasley. Yet for the first time and almost despite what he had believed he didn’t feel and overwhelming urge to cut ties with them after having spoken to his father, he was sure he hadn’t done much wrong yet and wished in that moment he had someone other than his family around to talk to.
Ron was let out of the hospital the following morning. He still was limping a little, but doing his best to not show it,
“we have to tell McGonagall” said Hermione. Harry nodded and they both rushed to the table to speak with her. Draco couldn’t make out their conversation but the professor looked utterly horrified and quickly dismissed Potter and Granger.
“What on earth were you thinking of” said Professor McGonagall looking at them up and down she looked almost white with anger. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” she said. Draco just stared at the floor not knowing what to say he was completely out of ideas. Then to his surprise it was Granger who mustered up the courage to speak. “Please, Professor McGonagall” she said in almost a whisper and cleared her voice it was still shaky.
“We could send Norbert to him, Charlie can take care of him!” Harry suggested one evening in the middle of yet another endless discussion they were having about the god forsaken dragon, and so it was settled. after Hagrid finally agreed a plan was put in motion to get the stupid dragon finally out of their life’s and Draco could not be happier they had finally decided to get rid of the monstrosity. he even was glad to help with their stupid plan to get him off the grounds.
“alohomora,” Hermione said and the door clicked open, they pushed each other in and shut the door behind them.  Pressing against it to listen for movement. They heard peeves telling Filch it had all been a prank.
“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things friendship and bravery” she looked back at Draco directly now.
“They can’t expect you to just ignore everyone in your house and pretend that they don’t exits that would just be hell,” she said Draco wasn’t so sure, but he didn’t refute her.
The following week leading up to the new year’s felt equally as lonely as the last. he found himself more often fantasying about returning to the castle and wondering about what Potter and Weasley where up to. The days where excruciatingly long, and flying by himself on the cold of December had gotten very boring, trying to practice quidditch without anyone was quite tedious even with his new quidditch ball set that allowed him to play on his own and brand-new broom. The new year’s celebration was equally as boring as the Christmas one, except he couldn’t excuse himself early as the new year’s ball was held at the Xaley mansion and he couldn’t just run up to his room and hide. To make matters worse pansy hadn’t come at all, as this was a more exclusive meting as his father had put it and so he was forced to be ‘on his best behavior’ all night. As the fireworks went off above the vast French style garden of the Xaley state, he welcomed the year 1992 with very little excitement as all the grownups around him toasted his mother held his hand, and he wished only to be back in his own bed. He had always disliked the new years.
“it’s not like it was good tea,” Draco complained not even bothering to look up from his book, they both laughed.
“Potter” Draco whispered to Harry making and effort to stay behind so that his father would hear him. “I think it’s better if you go now” he whispered so only Harry could hear.
It was two of days before the big Malfoy Christmas celebration held every year at the manor, and Draco was excited to see his friends again he was starting to get lonely spending hours roaming the halls. That morning when Draco woke up the gardens where completely coated in snow for the first time that year. The white peacocks had been let out to roam freely in the garden, and the house elves where busy putting up the decorations in the back yard, it looked like a scene out of a Christmas card out his window. He was in a good mood, having finally managed to wear off the exhaustion of the term; he was felling energized and had even spend time in the library searching form Flamel. By lunch time he was still sitting in his pajama’s books splayed out across the floor. When his mother came in and let him know he better change; his father was arriving that afternoon. His face must have dropped on accident because she gave him an apologetic look and rushed out the room.
After this Harry finally managed to sneak away, and, Lockhart took his place as a line formed to being signing autographs. Draco was pushed again to the back of the store, and found himself face to face with Harry who looked miserable.
Then like a switch had flipped his face turned back to normal his features softening. Draco notices for the first time it was almost night out.
“Well then, but you father doesn’t need to know that” she said Draco smiled she felt a bit better having talked to pansy. “I’m glad,” she said, “you know I worry about you a lot,” she had stopped to face him in the middle of a corridor. She was still shorter than him and Draco teased her about it.
“MR. POTTER” she yelled at the crowd. Draco smiled to his friends and was satisfied as they took Potter away hopefully to expel him. The rest of the class was, well, boring madam hootch returned after a while and though the more inexperienced people the basics of flying. It was terribly boring to Draco, never the less his success in getting Potter in trouble had put him in a good mood that could not possibly be broken.
He got up with difficulty his legs were sore and his head throbbed in pain, McGonagall guided him but the walk was still painfully long, Once there he immediately collapsed into one of the beds. Madam Pomfrey arrived to his bedside a few minutes later, and quickly got to work. Draco promised himself he ought to learn whatever spell she had used to soothe the cramping on his neck in the future it was brilliant. After a few minutes he felt almost like new, except for the throbbing headache, she had given him a disgusting tasting potion for it, but, she said he would probably have to sleep it off anyway.
He looked at it for a second at him, and then to Draco’s surprise drained the bottle in one swift gulp and walked straight through the flames. Draco had no doubt it was the right bottle but he still breathed relived as he heard Harry’s foots steps hurrying away from behind the fire.
It was certainly a very calculated description of Harry, Enough to make his father question if Harry was who he hoped, but not enough so to give away he wasn’t. That was why Draco had neglected to mention Harry ’s fierce sense of loyalty and determination, or that he was hot headed and reckless and acted without thinking most of the time and had a knack for always being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also didn't mention he was quiet and shy and hated to be in the spotlight and didn’t eat when he was nervous about something. Or the he complained about homework all the time and had awful handwriting and his stuff was always messy and he mismatched his socks but always had his bed perfectly made or the fact that his clothes where always baggy and he whore the green Weasley sweater he had gotten for Christmas to bed every night. He neglected to mention everything that made him Harry.
“I don’t really know Hermione, he said something about death being the next adventure, it was strange, and then just kind of left” Potter said adjusting his glasses
“sorry,” he said and immediately looking up meeting his father’s ice blue eyes. “father, I am doing as told, as you might have heard, I’m keeping company with Harry Potter as we had agreed” he said as confidently as he could muster hoping it hadn’t sounded like he had practiced that exact sentence in his head for weeks.
“The dark – err I mean, you know who has had the information about how to get past fluffy for at least three or four weeks now and he hasn't done anything about it yet,” Draco rationalized. “Which must mean there is something else that he doesn’t know, or more likely, that he is too sacred to do anything as long as Dumbledore is here,”
She shifted on her chair, and fixed her hair carefully, Draco wasn’t quite sure what to do, she must have noticed him awkwardly standing by the couch and signaled so he sat I the chair opposite to her. She sighted, and started to fidget with her ring, as Draco knew she often did when she was nervous. They heard the front door open, and the *crack* of elves materializing and disappearing presumably to receive his dads coat or other belongings he might be carrying. A few moments later he stepped into the room Draco and his mother where in.
“Prefects,” he heard professor Dumbledore shout distantly “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!”
“err --- can´t have ya right now, sorry,” Hagrid said he sounded agitated. They heard a pot fall with a loud clatter of metal inside the hut.
It was knockturn alley, Draco had never been allowed before, but diligently followed his father to the dark alleyway.
“would you listen?” potter said annoyedly  “if he gets to the stone first he will definitively kill me later, but tonight I might have a chance to stop him, I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you can say is going to stop me, Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”
Ron pulled her by the arm in the split second, dragging her out of the way of the swinging club. The troll roared again and started to corner Ron and Hermione. Draco was running out of objects to throw when he saw Potter start to take speed, he leaped and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck. And for some reason decided the move would be to stick his wands up the troll’s nose. The troll didn’t seem to like this as he started swinging like crazy Potter was holding on for dear life. Draco suddenly had an idea
He heard their steps approaching in the stairs so he hurried and kept walking, trying to decide what to do. On one hand, he didn’t want to get in trouble, on the other hand, this was the perfect opportunity to hex Potter and make his life miserable for a couple of days, and Potter could not blame him without accidentally accusing himself too. As he was deciding what to do he heard their steps following him around the corners of the castle, he was deadly afraid of finding Flitch in every corner he turned, but was heading with intent to the trophy room. No one was ever there, perfect place for a little harmless fun.
By Friday he felt more relaxed, the stress from exams was gone and with Dumbledore at the school and no near death experiences in nearly two weeks he was feeling positive. That was of course until that night at the great hall when Dumbledore didn’t show up to dinner.
The three of the sat around the bed and he told them the whole story, how he had seen the stone In the mirror, and how Quirrell had taken off his turbant, and Draco didn’t know how Harry hadn’t just fainted on the stop, he though he probably would have. He of course did not say this out loud, Harry didn’t really go into much detail about how Quirrell was gone, and noticing he was uncomfortable just thinking about it none of them pressed him on the matter. He then told them a bit about the conversation he’d had with Dumbledore, and to Draco’s surprise he had gotten to a similar conclusion as him about the whole thing. He didn’t say anything about it, he would make sure to bring it up later.
“Hagrid -- what’s that?” Potter suddenly asked looking directly at the fire, a black metal cauldron hung over the flame, inside Draco could se the outline of a giant black egg. He knew immediately it was a dragon egg. Hagrid started fidgeting with his beard,
“That thing, is my dog,” Hagrid said maddened. “I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the --” he stopped himself.
Never the less as the weeks went by, Draco has started to grow strangely fond of Grangers presence around him. Yet the constant thought of his father’s voice in the back of his head kept him from really talking to her at all. Still, he had tried to let go a bit of the hostility at least. Nonetheless, she was still a Mudblood, and he still was constantly aware of this fact even if she seemed to keep up to him in terms of every assignment. He now constantly found himself repeating this fact and the monologues of his father, every time he even thought of actually giving her a chance to become his friend. Still he could never fully shake the thought away, and bring himself to just not care.
“We must be kilometers under the school” Hermione said as she landed next to Draco, looking up into the weird chamber they found themselves in.
Draco though about this, at least him and potter where on a similar page about it and he knew Harry was right. They were never going to know Dumbledore’s intentions about the whole thing unless he wanted them to know, and perhaps it was better that way. Perhaps it was also better not to plant too many doubts in Harry ’s mind, he didn’t seem bothered, and he didn’t think bringing up his theory of Dumbledore using the stone as bait to get Voldemort to the castle was a good idea. Plus, who knew, maybe Harry was right, and that part wasn’t part of Dumbledore’s plan, just everything that came after like Harry seemed to think. The conversation between them finished there and Draco went back to his novel, he didn’t notice when but Harry fell asleep almost immediately.
Time flew by, between assignments, and exam after exam, slowly the grounds got colder. It was a chilly mid-November morning, and the school was getting ready for the first quidditch match of the season.  The anticipation could be felt in the air as he walked into the great hall, Potter looked like he would be sick and so Draco of course took the opportunity to tease as he sat in front of him
Draco didn’t have time to think before Hermione had cast a full body biding jinx on the idiot and promptly apologized as they headed out to common room huddled under Harry ’s cloak It surpassingly was just about big enough fit the four of them comfortably under it.
He was sat by the fire skimming the pages of one of Hermione’s novels she'd brought from home, some story about knights and wizards. He was absentmindedly flicking the pages processing the events of the previous days. He kept replaying the conversation he had heard McGonagall and Dumbledore having outside the door on his mind over and over again, somehow convinced it must have been something important, when it suddenly hit him.
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Weasley said loudly “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends by now right?” he said again which received a laugh from Finnigan. Draco turned to look at Hermione, she quickly wiped the tear swelling in her eyes. “she’s a nightmare, honestly,” Weasley exclaimed loudly. Draco saw Granger take up speed and push past the group of boys.
“Well then, tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” The group gladly followed Hagrid as he picked up the two trees and started to drag them again.
“Off you go!” he snapped at them kicking the door open again letting in fresh air, "we don't need all this negativity on such a joyus occasion do we Norbet, out!"
“where are you going,” he heard Granger scream “its past ten you will get in trouble,” she heard her scream at him. But he couldn’t care less. He stepped out into the dark corridor and started to walk aimlessly. he was almost one floor below when he heard the portrait open again out came Granger followed a few seconds later by Potter and Weasley,
“fine, maybe not” he said letting the conversation die seeing he would never convince granger. She went back inside.
“It will probably be fine, It's jut a house,” pansy said to him probably for like the millionth time that year.
Draco felt like his soul had drop to his feet, ´the dark lord´ he had only ever heard stories, he let out a panicked sound.
“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding,”
Harry had instead wasted no time and was already lowering himself through the hole until he was hanging only by his fingertips, still no sign of the bottom.
of January he was back at platform nine and ¾ saying goodbye to his mother, his father nowhere to be seen. He was excited but at the same time it was bitter sweet, he was going to really miss his mom, but he could not wait to get back to friends and even classes after being alone in the dark manor. And so, he happily jumped onto the train and started to look for Hermione in every single compartment as the train slowly pulled out of king’s cross station.
“Friends again” pansy asked after the whole ordeal was over and they were leaving the points classroom
Hello, thank you for reading, this was mostly a prologue so it's super short, hope you like it, this is the first fic long fic, that post since I decided to delete all of my other fic, so do know that even the smallest comment will be super appreciated. Cheers.
The warmth of the summer sun wasn’t enough to make the endless cold hallways of Malfoy manor feel inviting.
“Yes, but he’s is not fully himself, he is less alive than a ghost, but alive none the less” Draco said without hesitation his voice coming out more confident that he felt. He couldn’t read his father’s expression, he detected a hint of fear, and maybe some surprise in his burrowed frown.
“HEY!” she yelled and slapped his hand. Draco kept walking and pansy soon cough up to him fixing her hair
"How the hell did you know that” Draco asked as he managed to stand up and wipe the dust off his shirt.
“Honestly I don’t know why we even hang out with that prat” he heard Potter loudly complain to Weasley as he made his way down stairs to where they were supposed to meet filtch. “he thinks his so posh and important, the Malfoy heir, all he is an arrogant arse” continued Potter loudly. “cursing the that girl, what has she ever done to him, typical snob picking on others if you ask me!”
“it’s mad, you all are jumping to conclusions,” Draco said they had had this discussion before he was sure it was not Snape. Hagrid dropped the teapot.
“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Weasley shot at her. She seamlessly lifted the feather up in the air. The whole ordeal radically improved Draco’s mood who enjoyed watching Weasley fume the rest of the class.
“I’m going to go guarantee my Slytherin pals that we will give them the defeat of the century, so, you better not let me down Potter,” Draco said pretending to be really mad, over exaggerating the expressions he typically used to show disdain.  Potter gave him a half smile as headed out of the great hall to find Pansy.
The rest of the weekend was slow, Potter was on edge since the forest. Draco noticed he had begun to wake up multiple times in the middle of the night. He heard him breathing heavily and sometimes even muttering incomprehensibly in his sleep before he jumped awake. He was constantly rubbing his forehead and complaining of a headache, but was somehow still managing to study for most of the time. Presumably to keep himself occupied and away from the thought that the dark lord himself might barge in at any minute and try to kill him. This knowledge of course wasn’t doing Draco any favors either, and between the stress of exams, the looming fear of a murderous mad man, and Potters anxiousness he found himself on edge as well.
Draco rushed out the dorm on Halloween morning he had overslept and he only had five minutes to rush to the charm’s classroom. To his dismay the last sit was next to Longbottom. He cursed his luck and reluctantly sat down. Draco’s mood however improved a little when Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly.
The common room was packed full of people when they arrived, but they all the same idea and just went straight to their dorms. They were about to part ways in the stair case, when Hermione, Draco and Potter spoke at the same time
Draco couldn’t shake the strange feeling that Snape could somehow read his mind. He spend the rest of the weekend as the last one. Half consumed by studying, half thinking about the fact that at any time he could encounter a murderous mad man that had it out for Potter, with whom he happened to spend most of his time with this days. He didn’t quite know how he had managed to make it through the rest of his finals, and frankly he didn’t know how Harry had managed it either. He looked more dreadful by the day and Draco knew by hearing him shifting around in his bed he had barely gotten any sleep all week.  It wouldn’t be a week more until they got all their marks back but Draco felt rather good and he hoped he could beat out Granger for top of the class, but by the looks of it would be a thought competition.
In the back of his mind though was still the worry of not having heard back from his father at all. sure, the weather this week hadn’t been the best, but the owl ought to have reached him by now right? He wondered. He had breakfast on his own as every day that week. It seemed at least the Gryffindor where good on respecting his distance, or perhaps they just didn’t want to be friends at all. Whatever the reason he was glad he could keep to himself without being pestered by the others.
“Oh, Harry dear – I was worried sick you could have been anywhere” she said almost smothering Harry in a hug and before he had a chance to speak seizing the glasses form his face and with a gentle tap of her wand giving them back as good as new, she apeared to be a little much in Draco's opinion, hadn’t even noticed Draco or his father.
This last got Granger and Weasley to shut up.  Potter was infuriated and Draco had just gotten all the confirmation he needed that Harry Potter was absolutely nothing like all the pureblood families in Britain had hoped. He would never be the ‘next dark lord’ Draco knew for sure then. He felt in that moment a strange courage overtake him and did something he never though he would.
Granger didn’t turn up for the next class, or the one after it, she wasn’t seen at lunch and Draco could not help but worry about her. She heard from one the Patil twins that she had been crying on the girl’s bathroom most of the day and just wanted to be left alone. Draco though about going to look for her but he brushed the thought off thinking it would be a strange thing to do considering they were not friends. So, till diner time he debated with himself on how to proceed. He went down to great hall for the Halloween celebration worry still in his mind and resulted that if Granger didn’t show after 20 minutes he would go look for her.
“Mr. Borgin, I think we are quite done here” his father said dryly and walked out the shop. His father looked at them both and guided Draco and Harry to the corner behind the shop.
“I can’t believe you Albus” he heard a muffled whisper at the other side of the door. “They are eleven years old” whispered the voice behind the door it sounded exasperated, Draco recognized it as professor McGonagall.
(The line alluding to harry knowing flitch is a squib refers to a scene from the book's where he get's detention and finds Filch's Kwikspell letters (a course designed to help adult witches and wizards brush up on their magical skills) of course harry didn't understand what the letters meant or why it matters that filch is a squib.)
The door flew open and Draco walked inside the dark classroom. it was cold and his foots steeps echoed. Snape was sorting through ingredients, as the door shut behind him.
Draco walked hesitantly back to the front of the shop, his father standing by the door already, Harry trailed after him. He saw a flash of confusion brush his father’s eyes followed by recognition. He saw Boring staring strangely.
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on he ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by something We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have to put it out of its misery.”
“just think about it” he said cutting her off  “the plant thing, was on a specific extra reading, everyone knows you are the only one that read does, and the flying keys it’s like that was made with Harry in mind, The chess set, out of all the things you could transfigure why a giant chess set if not for Weasley? and the potions riddle for me of course, don’t you think it’s weird?”
Friday evening exams results were finally posted and to Draco’s delight he had managed to beat out granger not only in potions but in charms and History of magic. She of course still got top of the class on everything else but he couldn’t really bring himself to be angry or envious about it, he surprised himself by even managing to be happy for her, even if he was a little disappointed he hadn’t managed to beat her out for the top spot.
“But who would want such a life?” Draco said out loud without intending too, the centaur still spared him no glances, he only looked at Harry,
“Malfoy, pst -- Malfoy” he turned around looking at the triangular cabinet behind him and wondered if it was some sort of spell. “Draco” he heard a whisper again, Draco though he was losing his mind it sounded like potter, but how could it be? “Malfoy it’s me” this time he was almost certain it was potter but it didn’t make sense.
The egg split open and the baby dragon flopped onto the table. It had long lanky wings crumpled up and covered in a sticky substance, a long nose with wide nostrils, and bright orange eyes.
was bursting with people almost all the way up to the exit and it didn’t take Draco long to figure out why. Countless advertisements parted on the windows informed that Gilderoy Lockhart himself was holding a signing. Draco’s father didn’t seem to pay any mind to the multitude and made his way into the book store. Inside Draco immediately spotted the unmistakable bunch of redheads near the front and instantly knew it was the Weasleys. One of the twins had spotted them and was pushing his way to the front to alert who he assumed was Molly Weasley. Who immediately turned red face and pushed back to the back of the book store.
“Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” Hagrid said and flitch finally left. “I got you lot out ‘a of Copyin’ lines!” Hagrid said cheerfully as is that was somehow wonderful news “What good’s that too anyone anyway? Yeh’ll do summat useful tonight!” he said cheerily, but none of them looked cheery at the announcement of Hagrid’s favor to get them out of what he must have thought as a very unpleasant detention. Draco understood his intention had been to help, assuming he probably felt guilty it was his fault they had landed in the position they were in, but he definitely wasn’t doing them any favors.
“not me, the twins wanted to prank you, and found your little letter, I would not have brought it up but you had to mention my family didn’t you,” Draco could tell Weasley was losing the confidence he was appearing to have. Never the less he was too angry to think rationally, so before his emotions could take a hold of him and make him do something he would regret he headed for the door.
“Oh, thank god!” she said when she saw him enter the room. She sprinted throwing herself into a hug, for a second Draco was comply taken off guard, it just turned awkward, Hermione must have felt it too because she immediately pulled away. Physical affection still made Draco uncomfortable.
“Before school Hagrid took a little package out of a vault,” “what was it?” Ron asked still stuffing his mouth with more food.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” suddenly a voice boomed form the inside of the store, Gilderoy Lockhart came into view. Draco felt again a weird twist in his stomach.
But there was one key difference, to Draco it didn’t seem like a distant event, but a thing of the present. He wasn’t as naïve as Weasley who regarded the war a something long gone. He knew first hand since he was little that the muffled conversations he had been hearing and the scary things they promised where real and were happening now. If he had learned one thing for sure from his family was that ambition for victory knew no bounds, and you needed it to win, He had absolutely no doubt Dumbledore knew it too.
“well- come on then,” he said the four made their way into the house, it was suffocating, and all the curtains where drawn shut. Hagrid quickly closed the door.
So, a few days later he found himself with the trio in the highest tower delivering a Norwegian ridgeback to a bunch of Drunk Romanian friends of Charlie Weasley that took the dragon with them in fits of giggles, thinking to himself he would never have been in this position at all if he had been in Slytherin. Draco had his sleeve accidentally burned off by the dragon and was in a mood as they made their way down the stair case of the astronomy tower cruising Potter and his stupid need to get into all sort of trouble. They reached the hall bellow and where just about to throw on the cloak as flitch turned a corner and caught them.
“I’m going to be just fine” he said confidently “And you two have to promise you will visit during the holidays” he said with a smile,
“Wait a sec,” he said going into the common room to grab his robes and came out a few moments later. They started walking downstairs.
“err.. I didn’t know if you were okay I was worried sick all day” she said, it shouldn’t have taken Draco by surprise that she had been worried about him after all they were friends but it still did. His father’s monologue about blood purity began to play somewhere in the back of his head, he pushed the though away immediately.
He quickly stuffed his mouth full of food, in a very inelegant way, and ran upstairs to change into robes. He put on some black robes, that would have been elegant if wore by any other wizards, but the Malfoys appreciated being well dressed for every occasion. His father most of all, he usually whore very elegant clothes even for mundane things like going shopping at diagon-ally. Ever since he was young his father would tell him that it was always best to let everyone know how important you were even without saying anything, and that first impressions where always key. Since he started at Hogwarts he had started to take this advice with a bit of weariness as his own experience had proved this was not always right, but he rather not think about that much. He slicked his hair back and made his way down stairs just in time, as Dobby apparated in the living room telling his mother the car was at the front gate, and then disappeared again.
“Would say the same to you,” Draco replied sitting down, the floor was almost frozen over, but since pansy didn’t look like she minded it much, he opted out of saying anything.
Sorry for the delay had a very busy couple of days but here is this weeks update! hope you enjoy and as always let me know what you think. (btw, still looking for a beta if anyone is intrested!)
“oh! but I’m so terribly sorry Miss Parkinson, I promise I will not let my narrowing avoidance of death on a weekly basis get between us again” he played up dramatically and promptly began roaring with laughter, Finally pansy sat across from him on the grass
Draco joined the Gryffindor’s at the stands. The rest of the first years had apparently spend the morning making a banner for Potter that read Potter
He still acted like his usual self-bothering other students and doing everything in his power to make Longbottom’s and Potters life’s misery. But Pansy often questioned why he had laid off on Granger when they saw each other on weekends. He didn’t really say it was because she was already being casted out by the other Gryffindor’s, and he felt kind of bad making her life misery too. He also didn’t say that she made him feel a little less alone in the time he could not see them. He instead said he hadn’t even noticed because she was irrelevant. He had an incline that Pansy had not fully bought his lie. But she kept quiet about it, she knew better than to question the matter further.
“yes Pans, as far as he knows everything is smooth sailing,  I'll tell him that I have Potter's trust, you know, just according to then plan,” he said reassuring her,
“at least I have any, all you have is your siblings and idiot Potter that can’t even do magic,” Ron got up pointing his want at Draco’s chin, Draco wasn’t intimidated at all.
"Yes master," he heard another 'pop' and the elf was gone, along with all his Slytherin robes. A few moments later new robes materialized in his suit case and he aversely put them on, red was certainly not his color.
“Confuse it!” Potter yelled desperately Draco without really thinking started picking scraps form the floor and swinging them with all his forces at the head of the troll and soon enough harry followed suit. They clearly didn’t think their next move through as the troll turned around and slowly started to approach them. Weasley made a run for the other side of the bathroom
“The philosophers stone” Harry murmured. before Firenze could say anything, they heard rapid foot steeps approaching. The silhouettes of Hagrid flowed by Weasley and Hermione appeared, Firenze instantly took off on a sprint disappearing behind the tress as Hermione's yells grew closer.
Although in that moment the significance of Draco’s actions in the forest didn’t even cross his mind, in years to come he would come to recognize that night as the night Harry and him had first come to trust each other.
“clearly not Potter,” he said hostility clear in his tone, then realizing he didn’t really have to be that mean he added “just overwhelmed,” as to not to be rude
Draco sat on the second row behind Granger, he saw as all the Slytherins take their places and noticed Pansy was staring at him. She hadn’t even talked to him the entire week and started angrily wondering if she was just looking at him with pity or if she wanted something else. He was pulled out of his thoughts by the sound of the door slamming shut.
Draco had barely managed to get some carrots in his plate when professor Quirrell barged running into the room.
“I mean I’m not one to immediately make assumptions, but no not even a chance I think,” Draco said he didn’t quite know if pansy looked disappointed or was just thinking about what to say.
“It was my best subject last year yes, but really, - I mean your son is better he got top of the class sir”  Harry said and Draco wished that he didn’t
“Weasley levitate on tree” he shouted, Weasley only nodded. “one, two tree … wingardium leviosa” they both yelled The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose into the air “let go on three” Draco instructed and dropped, with a crack, onto the trolls head making the creature sway on the spot and then fall flat on its face. Potter got up whipping his robes, he was out of breath. Draco was shaking and Hermione still stood in the corner of the room next to Weasley.
“Now tell me what happened,” she said calmly sitting across from him his mind was going a hundred miles an hour. He took a moment to breath and tried to collect himself and then he began to explain everything.
“Well that is your problem to deal with, figure it out Malfoy, in the meantime though I will help you write to your father,” Draco breathed relived and regained his composure.
“Took you long enough” Weasley said “it’s about to begin” his voice high, he was clearly very nervous. A few minutes of anxious waiting and chanting later and Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up into the air. The match began.
“so rude,” the lady said and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, into a sofa.
“Look its exams week and Dumbledore has an obligation to be here at all times until OWLS and NEWTS are finished, is a ministry rule or something,” Draco said recalling overhearing McGonagall talking about it to some 5
The hooded figure rapidly approached them, Draco’s head was going a million miles per hour, but somehow, he found the clarity of mind to cast red sparks and then did the only thing he would think of and quickly hurled Harry's arm over his shoulder helping him up. Or rather forcing him to get up, he put his hand around Harry's waist and started to run. Harry was wobbly and dizzy most of his weight fell on Draco making it nearly impossible to run. He was sure it was the end. Harry was sliding away from his grip. Then something jumped over his head, in that moment his knees gave out and he and Harry flopped, face first, onto the floor. With the little strength he had left he crawled backwards until he hit a tree trunk. He was dizzy. He saw what he could make out to be a centaur had scared the hooded figure away. The centaur approached him and Harry . He was sitting a few meters away from him, visibly disoriented.
“You know I’ve got you back Draco,” she said “your father just needs to believe that you are working in his stupid plan” she said, and of course she was right.
He was wearing baby blue robes that trailed elegantly behind him and unconsciously Draco moved forward to get a better look pushing into the clapping crowd as cameras flashed everywhere, Gilderoy smoothly and elegantly walked along the walls of books.
A few seconds later to Draco’s relive his voice came from bellow announcing it was a soft landing. The three of them jumped into the darkness just as the music stopped to play.
“Exactly, I don’ know why Harry ’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’t’ try an’ kill a student! yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel,”
Snape asked two more questions.  furthering embarrassing Potter and Draco again scribbled the answers on the side of his page and laughed delighted at Potter even if it cost his own house points. It was finally some good in Draco’s week. Potions lesson continued. Snape started to put all the students into pairs.
He sat there for what feel like an eternity, until he felt someone tap him on the back. he got of the stool, The hall was early quiet, his friends stared at him form the Slytherin table, there were no cheers like there had been for the other students just silence. He felt like the world was spinning around him.
