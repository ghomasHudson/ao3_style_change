The Shield was of remarkable craftsmanship; even an untrained eye could see that. Riddle could feel the vibrations of power that emanated from it, just waiting for its rightful owner to use.
The admission coming from Harry somehow warmed Draco better than the gloves he wore, though Harry’s mouth twisted in the semblance of having tasted a lemon.
I wondered how it had slipped into my tote bag in the first place. It certainly was not there this morning when I packed.
Harry pouted. “I thought I was being charming.”
It was a foolish idea, one that would get them killed as soon as he moved. Riddle seemed to read Draco’s thoughts, walking past him with a little smile.
Shacklebolt shook his head. “Those are too obvious. Riddle will know about them, especially given how close your father and he were.”
“You are an officious irritation,” Draco snapped. “And no, I’m not going to reveal any mention of this meeting – my academic and social reputation hang by a thread as they are.” He gave an internal shudder at the idea of the Daily Sun catching wind that Draco Malfoy, hated scion of a crime family – never mind that the Malfoys were ten generations of proper English gentry – bandying fanciful theories to MI6.
I remembered her giant beast of a cat, and smothered a laugh at the image of him sitting in Potter’s lap, purring as Potter petted him.
“Well … there is something.” I found myself telling Luna Lovegood, of all people, about my discovery of the book and Slytherin’s Grimoire. It sounded supremely laughable in the light of day.
“How is progress?”
“I bet. All this time, I had thought the librarian hated me because he lost someone in the War. Instead….” I was strangely relieved to know that. I was not at fault.
He was in sight of it when it suddenly turned.
“Mother!” When did my mother become bosom buddies with Potter, of all people? “Besides,” I said with a dignified air, “I ate my chips.”
“Well, our sex life was also … well, stagnant, so we visited a swinger’s club.”
The manager flinched visibly. “Yes, of course. I’ll go and report to my superiors. If you need anything, please don’t hesitate to call.” He left with more alacrity than Harry thought was required for the occasion.
“Then I’m coming with you,” Harry said. “You’re still injured. You’re not going anywhere without me.”
Potter nodded. “Yes. 12 Grimmauld Place. We’re back in London.”
“I have a permit for those,” Harry said quickly, catching Draco’s expression.
“Yes,” Potter said, catching my look. “I pushed Ginny to try. And I think her realization that I was more interested in Adam was the final straw.”
With an effort, Draco tore his eyes away from the Shield. “My father ….” How did he fit in this? Lucius Malfoy disdained any history that was not relevant to the glorification of his own ancestry. What did he know about Ancient Greece or cultural preservation?
“It’s not your fault,” Potter repeated.
“Let’s keep looking,” he said brusquely. “Let’s give it one more minute before we leave.”
I lingered in the anteroom for a while, giving my contact details to Potter’s assistant Dennis. I looked up at Potter’s closed office. I had accomplished what I came here to do, but there was a niggling sense of dissatisfaction in me.
“I don’t treat this as a game,” Draco said. Greyback’s leer, Dolohov with his gun pointed at Harry – they were like imprints of some horrible nightmare and yet they had been all too real. His heart was sore, like the blood was ready to burst from the fear. “But I know how important this is. And I didn’t want them to hurt you.”
She gave me a look as we left the Head Goblin’s office. When I opened my mouth, she gave me a little shake of the head to forestall me.
My blink concealed the depth of the earthquake his revelation created in me. That wasn’t in the papers. A million questions flooded my mind and I had to bite my tongue to prevent the torrent from spilling.
“Ah.” I never knew what to say in these situations. If it had been one of my friends, possibly I would have cracked a tasteless joke. But this was Potter, and I couldn’t do that. “My condolences.”
“It’s no problem.” In better times I would cavil at its condition, but right now ….  I shook my head. “You don’t live here?” I realized I knew so little about Potter. And yet, the short time we had spent together was like an eternity to me ….
“Well, warn a man next time,” Potter said, disgruntled. He settled back down. “And what is this ‘breakthrough’ of yours that almost gave me a heart attack?”
“I feel I should do the gentlemanly thing and offer you my jacket, but I’m kind of afraid you might think that I’m not letting you take care of yourself,” Harry said, with a slight note of amusement.
I didn’t ask why, though it’s a common belief that the stronger the blood ties, the more powerful the magic was.
“Why did you tell them that?” Harry demanded after she had checked us in with remarkable efficiency. He had paid with his credit card, me not having other currency except for great hubcaps of gold coins that would probably have sent her into a tizzy. We wanted to hide from wizards, not Muggles. I fingered the Galleons in my pocket. They were rather irritating to carry around. Maybe I should be like Harry and get some Muggle money.
“What, tracking down the provenance of historical artifacts? It’s part of my job, you know. At least this time I don’t have to fill out a pile of paperwork.” Draco eyed Harry thoughtfully. “But I also don’t have a secretary anymore either. Unless you want to volunteer?”
I rubbed my eyes blearily. So far – nothing. I knew it was early yet, but it was disheartening, particularly as I only had the faintest idea of what I should be looking for.
“We’ll be ready for them.” Harry put his hand over mine. Casually placed, it was warm and comforting. “Don’t worry. I’ll be with you. We can deal with whatever we find together.”
Instead, I allowed the chatter to wash over me. it was calming, to hear about my friends’ days. There were so few of us left. It was a relief, after the dramatic events of our youth, for our lives to turn out so mundane.
With a loud profanity, Potter deflected the Stunning spell and shot a jet of blue light at the cowled intruder. It hit his shield and vanished; the intruder was already reacting, flicking his wand at my coffee table. It rose and flew at us.
“No.” Hermione shot Ron a warning look. “My husband and I don’t mind.” She stood up. “Tea?”
He looked at her doubtfully. “You’re the more patient one. If you can’t handle him, how do you think I’ll be able to?”
“Blaise. So what brings you down here? Harry? Other than the obvious.” Harry’s name was purred.
“Don’t worry,” the man said. “You weren’t bad. I’m just more observant than most. Especially with good-looking men like yourself.” Teeth shone as the man held out his hand.
“Don’t be vulgar, Potter.” I blushed at the reminder. Potter was a good kisser. The way he teased and nipped and explored…. I shook my head. “Are you here to dissect your performance last night or what?”
“I can tell you how ugly your hair is,” I said. “Will that put you more at ease?”
“You’re not the only fence in London,” Harry said. “You’re good at what you do, obviously, and your connections give you an asset compared to the competition. But there’s no honor amongst thieves and greed overcomes any semblance of trust you may have built in your work.”
Draco didn’t fault them. Their families had known, and fought, for generations. Draco’s father habitually stymied the Weasley paterfamilias’s attempts to advance in the Civil Service, though from all accounts, Mr. Weasley was happy where he was. Draco in his more cynical moments thought his father was doing the Head Weasel a favor, consciously or not.
I knew in some quarters I would be considered a catch. I was decent-looking and independently wealthy. But somehow, Potter did not strike me as someone who sought that.
“I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.” I had long decided the way to enjoy Luna’s presence was to ignore the uncomfortable truths she was so fond of casually dropping. Then I was ashamed. That was no way to treat someone. And I had decided to put the coward who dodged the painful realities behind me. “It’s their loss,” I added awkwardly. “I like you and so does Harry. We’ll need to have dinner sometime, all four of us. How’s Rolf?”
“Like the Antikythera Mechanism?”
They spun around, Harry’s gun raised –
At least printed words couldn’t raise the decibel to enforce their point.
“I think I’m going to bring in my products from my flat,” I said. “Your shampoo is horrendous. Three-in-one? Seriously?”
“We’ll monitor the situation,” Shacklebolt said finally. “If your conjection is true, then it goes beyond what this agency can handle on its own.” He suddenly chuckled. “I suppose I should congratulate you on a job well done before I forget. After all, it isn’t every day that you pull a fourth of the city’s drug supply off the streets.”
“I don’t think that could have summoned a biscuit from the kitchen,” the Weasley said.
“You really should be neater about where you put your clothes, Potter,” Malfoy said as Harry climbed back onto the bed. “And why are you coming onto the bed?”
“I’m alright.” I had to keep saying it. If I said it enough times, I would believe it.
The Weasley, who had remained sitting quietly until now, spoke: “And what are we going to do after we find the Grimoire?” He gave me an unreadable look. “Are we just going to place it in a vault in Gringotts and let it gather dust? Or use it? What if we simply stop looking for it and destroy the Circle? Wouldn’t that solve all our problems?”
I wanted to scream, but I could not. The sound caught in my throat and withered as my world was reduced to crisp, charring skin –
“Last time?” Potter’s head swiveled towards us. “What last time?”
He touched the Shield. The gold heated under his fingers. It was smooth and worn, and Riddle had an image of the heroes of old holding it.
A man stood in the middle of my father’s study, his face concealed a hood. Unmistakable was the sense of power and threat radiating off him, like a rotting scent around a corpse. He cut a tall and powerful figure, and I was struck with a sense of déjà vu, like I had met him before somewhere.
Harry’s office was soundproofed, and Harry had drawn the curtains when he had taken Draco inside to shout at Draco. Yet there was always the danger of someone ignoring common courtesy and barging in.
“Yes. So the best plan right now is to go on the offensive and find Slytherin’s Grimoire before they find other Slytherin descendants who will be … more pliant.”
Harry winked at Draco. “You know I won’t.”
“What the fuck, Dolohov?” the shorter man muttered. “I thought Lucius’ brat was a nerd.”
“You’ll have to go first,” Draco said, hiding his embarrassment. He really needed to clear his head of Harry. “I want to see you and your knobby knees in breeches.”
Draco unpacked, stacking his laptop next to a small pile of books – a traveler’s account of Afghanistan, a book on Alexander the Great’s campaigns in the region, and a dog-eared copy of the Iliad.
Potter growled at me, a low, dangerous rumble that nevertheless set a low fire of desire burning. “I don’t make a game of kissing people, Malfoy.”
“Like that?” His voice came out a deep rumble that lit a pool of heat in my belly. He gave a little pull.
Harry didn’t need a computer analysis to tell him that. It was highly illegal for vehicles of any sort to disable their tracking and control chips. Even if this car was not carrying the drug runners they wanted, it was in fragrant breach of the law, and needed to be stopped and searched.
I growled. That would be hell to clean. Lightning exploded out of my wand. It sped along the lines of the hardwood tiles and through the air in jagged streaks. They struck the intruder in the chest and he dropped, his face frozen in surprise even as he attempted to block them.
He was of medium height and slender build, pale and blond and attractive in that cut-glass aristocratic way. He had the most striking pair of grey eyes that Harry had ever seen – the pair of grey eyes that had looked at Harry.
The librarian spat. “Like I ever tell you, Potter. You might’ve killed Voldemort, but the Circle is far older and stronger as a collective than him and his Death Eaters. Death Eaters — such a pretentious name. Appropriate for a pretender.”
And fell onto my floor. My legs hit the coffee table and the jarring impact caused me to grit my teeth in pain. The book – the coverless paperback, not the one in my vision – dropped onto the hardwood floor with a loud crack.
“How long did I sleep?” I asked, letting the sip of tea warm me. It was difficult to tell by looking out the window; we had arrived after the sun had already set. The streetlight had already turned on, washing the road outside with a soft glow. It was quiet, with nothing but parked cars and bikes.
“I’ll be sure to,” Draco said, laying out his suits. He could only hope he would have an opportunity to wear them again. “Where are you going?”
“The operative term is borrowed,” Draco said. “And it was returned in one piece, wasn’t it? And so are we.”
Then he went for the car park.
“Still trying to convince Draco here to consult for us,” she said. She eyed him. “Go on, tell him you think it’s a good idea.”
What was happening? With all his effort, Harry tapped his wand against his head, applying a light shock to knock out his biomech. Nothing.
“I’m so tired of all this blood,” I snapped. “And if you think kidnapping me will help change my mind, you’re sadly mistaken. You and your men attacked me, my home, my family. You can’t seriously think I’ll be willing to aid you after that.”
“No time to explain,” Harry said, grabbing Draco, and all but shoving his way inside. “You need to fortify the house. You know -- that one.”
But it was the legacy of his family, and Draco felt the weight of the responsibility. Not the money, but the Manor — it was his past, his heritage, and Draco knew his father would throw an apoplexy if anything happened to it.
She thinks I’m reluctant to share because I was unsure of my conclusions, I realized. Good. Let her think that. It would keep her from prying too much. No need to seek out trouble where none existed.
Harry had an unreadable expression. “You did all that just to warn me?”
“Draco! What’re you doing sitting on your table?”
A violent spasm shook me. No. Harry couldn’t be that stupid. I was not worth handing the Grimoire over for. He deliberately walked into a trap – for me.
Draco barely heard him. He was fixated on the Shield.
“Well,” Draco said. “Malfoy Manor has over an acre of grounds, including a forest, the main house, the gamekeeper’s cottage, the stable, and – the mausoleum!”
“You make it sound so easy,” Hermione said. “I would laugh, but I think you’ve proven yourself to be more than capable of it.”
“I don’t blame you,” Harry said, cutting off my rambling. “It was a mistake. You made it, you hopefully learned from it, and I think you rectified it pretty well. I heard you showed impressive reflexes and spell-casting. Where did you learn that spell you did? The Animwhatsit thingy?”
It was a pleasing image that stared back at Harry through the mist. Nothing too special, though Harry had had occasional lovers compliment his eyes and how he could never hide his emotions with such an expressive mouth. It was a bit of a joke whenever they told Harry that, given how Harry had to keep his partners hidden from prying eyes.
The rest of the dinner moved onto lighter subjects – we argued over who should have won the Quidditch World Cup two years ago, and I sought Potter’s view on Goyle and Millicent’s relationship. We ended with Potter, ever the gallant, walking me to my room.
“I was attacked today,” I said. “And my flat was broken into.”
“Oh?” There was a definite note of interest under Fletcher’s caution. “Easy work? Then why all this?”
“Yes, okay, but – is that blood?”
My father snorted. “And come up with trite insights about the Dark Arts are a product of our biases and prejudices of our community when we came up with this magic to defend ourselves? How we’re all secretly bent on oppressing Muggles when we’re just trying to defend our way of life?”
“Why should I trust you?” spat Fletcher. “You lured me under false pretenses, you bast – ow!” Harry had raised his arm warningly.
“What are you talking about?” he managed to get out. “What investigation? What money laundering?”
“I am better at tying ropes than neckties,” Harry acknowledged.
“He told the elf this morning that he wasn’t feeling well, so I had a tray sent up to his room,” my mother said.
“Hello, Lucius.” His voice was a blast of menace. “Telling our little secrets, I see.”
“Are you alright, sir?” the manager asked.
“It’s alright to be nervous,” she said. “Most first-timers are.”
I looked up at Harry, his body on top of me, pressing me down as to protect me from the explosion. I kissed him, hard and fierce.
“You smell nice,” he said, nuzzling my neck. His stubble tickled my skin. This was deeply intimate for two people who were supposed to be in a casual sexual relationship. Bu it was a pleasant sensation, being held by Harry, and I swallowed my objection.
Potter looked at me. I forced myself out of the daze.
It was a slow ride up; Draco watched the door, wary that it might slide open with an unsuspecting worker, walking in with bleary bloodshot eyes. Thankfully, no one did.
The man’s face puzzled. No one else paid them much attention, busy with their own tasks.
“It certainly sounds fantastical,” she said, “but I mean, the Founders were real people, and it’s completely possible that Slytherin had a Grimoire. Besides, there are plenty of things that people believe to be myths but are real. Like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.”
Riddle frowned. “That wasn’t part of our contract.”
“Harry’s right,” Hermione said. “I don’t know Malfoy, and I don’t trust him, but I trust that Harry hasn’t lost his judgement in people.” She studied Malfoy. “And reputation isn’t always accurate. But given how easily Malfoy had just found that information right now, I think if he means us harm, we wouldn’t be here. Would we?”
“We have ways to penetrate those shrouds,” Harry said, taken aback that Grey Eyes knew that. From Grey Eyes’ appearance, one couldn’t see anything apart from a rich socialite, albeit one that was stunningly handsome, like a work of filigreed silver. Harry certainly hadn’t expected the man to be so familiar with hovercars and their web-link components.
Silence.
That was what Bellatrix understood best: the ability of strength and terror to propel men to their best. She had entered his service with a rather memorable beginning, shooting a man point blank when he mistook her to be a secretary and asked her to bring him coffee.
Warming his hands with his mouth, he tried to concentrate. Fletcher had indeed done as Draco requested, and contacted Riddle and his group. There had been a scrap of paper with the address scrawled on it in surprisingly neat handwriting when Draco checked the post office box this morning.
A blond woman with an ethereal air waited for him at a table.
“Is that why you cut off all contact with me?”
“I remember one of the artifacts that disappeared later from the hoard while we were in Afghanistan,” Draco said. “You know, that hoard that was in Dolohov’s hideout. I can pretend to be a buyer after something of that kind. If my contact’s any good, he can get me in contact with Riddle’s organization.”
He narrowed his eyes. “You’re more impressive than you let on, Potter.” All traces of the amused geniality were gone. A lance of green light aimed at Harry, who dropped and rolled out of the way.
“We’ll take your deal,” Bellatrix said, breaking in. She silenced Dolohov with a hard expression. “You keep an eye on them. Encourage them to behave by shooting off someone’s kneecap if necessary.”
It was brighter in the cave, but just barely. Luminous blades of grass provided the source of light, lining up on the sides like a path that led – straight to the dais.
“You don’t need to worry about that,” Harry said, reaching around Draco’s waist. He pressed a gentle kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Not ever.”
“My work goes far beyond certifying their provenance and powers, though that’s a part of my job when no one else does. But my work is more examining the circumstances in which they’re created and looking more at the why. What values or attitudes resulted in these Objects being made, for example? That’s only for right now,” I added. “I’m not an archaeologist, but it’s intersecting with my studies.”
G-forces slammed into his chest. Harry gritted his teeth. He could hold on; his body augmentations allowed him to handle the additional compression that squeezed the air from his lungs, but it was still every bit as painful.
I gestured at Harry. “You call this well-handled?”
“It was. But thank you for being so protective of me. It’s nice to know that you’re always watching my back.”
“He’s well,” I said, a little miffed at my mother’s mocking. “I’m meeting up with him later with a couple of friends.”
Then they had waited all day at the site, hoping to see what happened.
Bellatrix narrowed her eyes. “Very well. I will come onboard. Dolohov, you stay and keep an eye on them.”
Covered in barnacles and surrounded by fishes, it was most definitely a ship. Around laid the broken shards of pottery, of the cracked and ruined amphora that carried olive oil and wine and whatever else the Greeks had to trade. There were also bronze and marble statues, glassware,
That was informative and only whetted my hunger for more. “Adulthood is like that,” I pointed out. “Disillusionment and compromises are what awaits us.”
She grinned back. “No thank. Save all of it for Draco later. We need to go back and check the damage. Do you want to come?”
Again, the man wondered at the strange workings of Fate. What twists had made the Malfoy boy, and not his father or his forebearers the critical piece to their plans? He wanted to laugh.
Then he followed Harry out.
“And the bathroom is down the hall to your left,” he concluded, rather lamely. He turned to leave.
“Just someone trying to save a few pounds where he can.” Draco pried his fingers from clawing at the armrest, sitting up slightly to the edge of his seat. A frisson of violence threaded the room. How suspicious Fletcher was, Draco wasn’t certain. Draco had to be prepared in case events took a turn for the worse.
I turned to face Harry. His eyes were wide and clear, with an earnestness that prompted me to forget everything.
The pillar sunk into the ground with a loud creak, revealing steps that led down into pitch black.
It would be easier if Draco knew what he was looking for, but he didn’t. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary, though there were more stacks of paper waiting for him to read.
“We can track him other than your typical cloak-and-dagger ways,” Draco said. “He deals in stolen artifacts and looted antiquities, doesn’t he? Well. I work for an auction house. I know … well … I know probably more than I should tell you, but there are ways to obtain those kinds of things for a very determined collector.”
It burned, going down the throat like liquid fire. “What is that?” Harry asked, his eyes watering. “Is that alcohol or detergent?”
Next to me, Harry stayed silent. It might have been a trick of the light, but his glasses looked fogged, the green of his eyes concealed behind them.
“What do you mean, ‘I need to make an appointment?’” I glared at the receptionist at the reception room of the Auror’s Office. I had Apparated to the Ministry as soon as I was sure the book was securely in the safe. My haste was not returned in kind: the woman at the front desk of the reception, a mousy haired witch in plain and shabby-looking black robes, told me that no officers were available.
I rolled my eyes. “Yes, sir.” I gave him a mock salute.
I remembered the vision I had of Slytherin setting the protection boundary around the Grimoire. “Even if the cave is easy to access, there’s still powerful enchantments guarding the place, most likely. When I touched the book-key, I saw Slytherin creating blue flames around the book.”
“I don’t know. We didn’t see who delivered it. It’s addressed to you, though. I reckon it might be a fan letter.”
“Not much, sir. Other than that Dolohov and Pettigrew seemed to have been distributing the supply both in City and Underground. Their agents were less secret when working Underground, which was how we caught wind of their operation to begin with.”
Harry had listened with a somber attentiveness when Draco explained Rosier’s conjectures. Just hearing himself out loud made Draco sound so foolish. But it was the only lead they had, and Draco had to admit it tied together all the loose ends neatly if – if – Draco suspended his disbelief.
It didn’t matter how he felt – Harry focused on the exhilaration soaring through his chest, the adrenalin that pumped through his veins. It was like a drug, one more potent and headier than anything the runners or dealers could come up with.
His words cut through the fog in my head. “Order? The Order of the Phoenix?”
My body pulsed with fear. The Manor had stronger protection than my little flat did. Ancient defensive enchantments guarded the home of the Malfoys for generations.
What was left of his world disintegrated in that flash. No matter how much Draco argued with his father, Lucius had been the bedrock of Draco’s universe. His father was the central reference point from which Draco based his life. Lucius’ approval or lack of – it was the North Star to how Draco guided his own choices. And now that was extinguished.
Struggling to keep my face as impassive as I could, I managed a “I see” with relative equanimity. “So you and the female Weasel – Weasley – are no longer an item.”
Draco nodded.
Bellatrix evidently thought so, too. “Shut up,” she snapped at him. “No wonder you’re reduced to an errand boy, if you can’t even handle this little bit of breeze.”
The Decoder, the boy called one of them. An apt, if unimaginative name. It would serve its purpose soon, unlocking the code which kept the secret of the Shield.
Thankfully, having Potter – and surprisingly, Granger and the Weasley – for company alleviated that itch of restlessness. They came every few days, ostensibly to provide updates on the search for Cross, though I was fairly certain their visits had a dual purpose in checking in on Potter. I enjoyed sniping at the Weasley, and Granger, despite her propensity to lecture, had surprisingly insightful comments into my work. I secretly resolved to update some of them with her suggested revisions in mind.
“Merlin, I’m starved.” I stole a chip from Goyle. The crisp salted potato melted in my mouth and I gave an audible sigh.
Scowling, Weasley went back up, returning a moment later with a pile of clothes.
“Draco, get out of here.” Harry’s voice was strained.
He went out of the room into the hallway, stopping when he reached a reasonably lit  area.
Draco distracted himself exploring the house. Though in a rather insalubrious area, it was large and spacious, with three storeys filled with rooms stuffed with collections from previous inhabitants.
“Should I bring in a tray for your and Master Potter, Master Draco?”
Unfortunately, Harry did. All too well.
But nothing happened. The hall remained empty; there was no one, not even a guard.
We stumbled through the grate back into my flat, almost knocking over the stand next to the fireplace. I poured a tumbler of the Macallan and myself some water as Blaise sat down on the couch.
I took it Potter did not read the social columns of the Prophet. “I was engaged a few years ago,” I said, somewhat reluctantly. Then I became angry at myself. Why should I be ashamed of that fact? Potter had a failed marriage under his belt; he had no grounds to judge. “To Astoria Greengrass. She’s a year younger than us.”
Hedwig, run a diagnostic on the security here, Harry thought. From outer appearance, that electronic lock seemed to be all there was to the manager’s vaunted “security”. Appearances were deceptive, however, especially when it came to surveillance.
I could not help but smile at that. “You’re right. Sorry. You’re taking me to meet your parents.”
He would know if there were interactions between the Death Eaters and an even more shadowy group that pulled the strings from behind. Or at least, be sensitive to whispers of it.
“Bellatrix,” he called out. “There’s something I need you to do for me.”
“The people down here have their own ways of keeping themselves hidden,” Goyle said. “But anyways, you can’t go around asking random people and expect to get any results.”
Harry slanted a look at Draco. “It’s quite narrow in there. Are you sure we’ll fit?”
“How do you think that works?” Harry asked, stripping to his waist. Draco averted his eyes. it wouldn’t do to get distracted now. They had enjoyed themselves on the plane; it was time for Draco to focus on business.
“How was your day?” Draco asked as they walked along the Embankment. Big Ben glowed in the background. They had neglected to discuss the niceties, Harry being too busy lecturing Draco on matters of safety and then that kiss at the office.
“Found anything?”
“No, no, it’s admirable to have so much passion.” I moved under the awning of one Noltie's Botanical Novelties. Luna followed. “Just working on a piece about druidic hexes. Though I’m a bit stuck at the moment.”
“Then we’ll kill you and your friends,” Bellatrix said. There was no inflection in her voice; she was simply stating a fact. “We have the resources to find this Decoder. We can hire teams and teams of divers. You’re only causing a momentary headache for us.”
“Same reason as our victim,” Hedwig said. “Overdose and node burnout.”
I usually made no such fuss: I viewed the ones who did with disdain, knowing that more often than not it had to do with a bullying assertion of power rather than desire to be acknowledged for their hard work. Yet with this librarian constantly hounding me, I felt it was only appropriate. Yesterday, he gave me grief for bringing too many ‘outside’ materials into the Reading Room, until I pointed to a man in the corner using one of those newfangled Muggle contraptions called a ‘laptop’.
“Understood, Finnegan.”
“I’ll bet.” Draco had a sudden vision of himself bound before Harry, Harry fisting his hair while Draco arched, exposing his neck to Harry.
“I hope you aren’t under the delusion that we’ll come quietly,” one of the intruders, the taller man, said, recovering. “You’re outnumbered by the two of us and I doubt an academic such as yourself would be able to force us to come with you.”
“I suspect it has to do with the age of the memory,” I said. “I haven’t dated it, but it came from a very old source, as old as the school, in fact. It …” I hesitated. Do I tell her? McGonagall was as trustworthy as anyone can be, but knowing the truth might put her in danger. Too many people had already been hurt because of this – because of me.
“Then they should have sent their own team to investigate,” Harry said. “Come on, let’s go back to the office.”
“Get back! Everyone get back!”
“I’m sure you’ll think of something,” she said.
I didn’t want the responsibility of dealing with this – this was why I selected the relatively dull path of the historian. I enjoyed learning about it, and occasionally teaching it, not make it. That was something for people like Saint Potter and his friends. They seemed to relish the spotlight, the glory of saving the world. I on the other hand, had no need to play the hero.
He didn’t succeed.
Theo gave Draco a sour look. “Who do you think I am? Besides, dealing in underground antiquities these days is not the payoff it once was. The trade’s been taken over by organized criminals. They’ll stiff you faster than any government. And at least you can challenge the governments in court.”
“Yes.” Draco was breathing hard. His arms and legs were sore, bruised from the struggle beforehand. Draco was sure he would look like a patchwork of colors come tomorrow morning. “You?”
Harry touched my arm lightly. “I won’t let anything happen to you. I promise. Oh. I have a gift for you.” He took out a small box of red sandalwood inlaid with silver.
“It went well,” Harry said. “Nothing particularly exciting. They had me going over reports from the listening posts all over the world.”
“Well, the house itself wasn’t offended, but –”
“I’m not sure, sir,” Finnegan said, and he did look puzzled, scratching his head like the very picture of confoundment. “I only received word that we needed to leave a few minutes ago.”
“Goethe was never my favorite,” Draco said. “And like I said, I’m only delaying. We can think of something. We have to. I’m not just going to surrender without a fight. But I’m also not willing to needlessly sacrifice myself when there still might be a way.”
Time slowed to a crawl. Draco’s vision tunneled until he saw only Harry. His legs propelled him forward, and Draco felt heat searing through his shoulder. It stayed, digging into and through his muscles.
The hostile crowd followed, the human wave crashing into the oblivious patrons. Harry didn’t spare a look back, his feet taking him quicker than his pursuers.
We kissed as the sun began its descent down the horizon.
I’m good at what I do, Hedwig said in a self-congratulatory tone. Besides, it wasn’t even that hard. All I needed to do was follow the breadcrumbs.
Draco ran his hand over them. Despite his logic, Draco hesitated. He knew it was all nonsense, but his heart still thumped. It was a ridiculous reaction – there wasn’t any information that these cards could convey that would be useful.
“The sound was coming from a room I had never been in before. That wasn’t the surprising part; Malfoy Manor is over a few acres. What was surprising was that there were so many men inside.”
“Did you want me to stand and watch your little presentation?”
I squeezed the tip, making a face at the pain. Blood coalesced into a droplet. I dipped my wand in it.
Potter responded better than I did, throwing up a shield; the blunt force of Cross’s spell hit it with an audible sound that reverberated, as deep as a gong.
“Well, the shield can be read as an interpretation for Homer’s thoughts on war. Or a microcosm of society. But some people think it is real. Fringe thinking and rather nutty, but then, we have people who refuses to accept the Earth is round.”
They glided through the murky depths, guided by the powerful headlights on the DPVs. Small fishes, sardines and mackerels and anchovies, swam close, attracted by the intruding brightness. The sun became a weak reflection as they dived deeper.
Unexpectedly, Potter smiled at the mention of my mother. “How is she? We corresponded a few times, but we lost touch recently.”
“The best plans are the simplest,” Harry intoned with mock solemnity and Draco had to chuckle.
Draco wanted to laugh but Harry was dead serious. Draco turned serious. This wasn’t a game – it was life or death, and it was very likely it would end in death.
Shacklebolt arrived a few minutes later. In contrast to the heavy body armor of the police, he and Dawlish both came in suits that looked to be well-ironed despite it being almost the crack of dawn. They had exchanged a few hushed words with the leader that Draco, however hard he strained, missed.
And then I smelled the sizzle of the steak. It was strong, almost to the point of being burnt.
They were in the hall now.
Harry scowled. But he pushed his way through to the bar, taking out his wallet and hailing the bartender –
Draco had a flash of himself and Harry, both in Regency costumes, kissing under the large oak on Manor grounds. It … wasn’t unpleasant.
“All right, sir?” It was Finnegan. He spoke into the concealed wristcomm. “The perimeter is secured.”
“Now you see why I like my job.” Draco grinned. “Do you want to grab some dinner?”
“No. But then, I’m not surprised. He was always good at hiding.”
Harry acted. He pointed at the wall with his wand. A white glow lit the chamber. A humming accompanied it, one that set my teeth on edge.
“Where is he?”
“I have pictures of the men who died after visiting here,” Harry said. “I was going to start by asking around if anyone had seen them, or know of anyone who had.”
“No, that’s fine. Draco and I will stay up in the front.”
Potter flicked his own wand, and within minutes, my flat was pristine.
“How are you feeling?” I asked.
“Yes.” Malfoy’s eyes glittered as though laughing as some private joke. “I would.”
But that dream was a wisp in the air now.
“Oh, he came here? Wouldn’t have expected that. Unspeakables usually are so boring. Though I guess even a boring man needs a thrill now and again.”
We did well today, didn’t we, Hedwig?
Riddle stood up. He wore all black and it was like watching a shadow unfurl. He walked to the window. Through it, the Millennium Eye spun, the spokes gleaming in the night, and a little farther, Big Ben and the House of Parliament. London spread out before him, a field of gems that was ready to be plucked.
But – “Thanks,” Draco said. He stared out at the ghostly figure of trees against the backdrop of faint lights. “For the ride.”
“I don’t want to talk about this,” I said, turning away sharply. I looked around my flat, at the lived-in messiness, the assorted knickknacks, the little affluent symbols of a comfortable existence. It was a facile appearance of a space for someone who seemingly had everything. “Not right now.”
So this was a military camp. Draco didn’t know what he had been expecting, but he didn’t have much of an opportunity to explore before he was rushed off to meet with the field officer. He would be briefed and prepare while this officer intercepted the meeting between buyer and seller.
“He’s right.” I kicked a pebble out of the way. “He’s not going to live forever. And then I’ll be the Malfoy. With all its attendant baggage. It’s not like there’s a cousin or a brother I could fob off the job to.”
Harry laughed. “What, afraid of a little dust, Draco?”
I looked at Harry. He looked at me with wide, hopeful eyes. Some might even call them naïve.
Because you were worried about a civilian getting hurt and the inquiry that follows? Or because you were worried about me getting hurt?
I reached instinctively for my wand, but the librarian had already smoothed his features into his usual irritation.
It hurt too much to acknowledge to himself that the Manor was no longer home. The fond memories of the place were tainted by the recriminations between his father and himself. The guilt at the anger Draco had at his father’s rejection added to the poison seeping from these walls like a miasma.
Draco stared out the window, at the frothing white crashing against what Homer called the wine-dark sea. He looked at his own glass of white wine, dry, a little sharp against the tongue. It was nothing like the waves below.
“Do you want a check? Or do you take credit?”
I stretched out on the bed, luxuriating in the additional space, feeling the knots in my muscles release. A satisfying pop sounded as I cracked my back.
Malfoy had an unreadable look on his face. “I see you don’t quite approve, Commander Potter.”
I forced myself to breathe. I needed to concentrate. I had no idea what that spell was, but judging by Potter’s convulsions, it didn’t do his body any good. But the fact that he was responding to it meant that it had not killed him right away.
“Yes.” All the signs fit. Harry knew it only too well. He had seen too many pictures and surveyed too many bodies not to be familiar.
Alright … if that’s the way you want to play it. Draco had no problem matching Harry’s tone with his own matter-of-fact manner. “Anywhere is fine. I’m not super picky at the moment.”
It made for chilling reading. The writer detailed their alleged links to various terrorist groups and acts all over Europe, as well as money-laundering, fraud, as well as theft of magical artifacts and tomb-robbing. I recognized some of those incidents: the recent break-in at the Avalon Conservatory at Glastonbury, for instance. The Ministry still had no idea who broke in. Nothing valuable was taken, or so they had told the Prophet, but among the items listed missing were a number of curios linked to the Dark Arts. I had incidentally been planning a trip to view them for a journal review.
“I heard that the Department of Mysteries’ SI models are the most advanced. Perhaps ours are just not good enough.”
I looked faintly at him. “Oh.” My mother had mentioned this place to me before. This must be the house my mother grew up in, before her family moved out to the country.
Riddle considered himself a warrior. Perhaps not so much in the literal sense, though in his younger days he wielded an entire range of weapons with proficiency. But he fought – against the decaying moral values of this world, against the degeneracy that the mixing of blood ultimately brings.
“I’m not just looking at regular historical artifacts, father,” I said. “I’m looking at Dark Objects.  They’re dangerous and needs careful handling.” As you very well know, I wanted to add.
“Forgive me if I’m more than a little suspicious of that reassurance, Commander Potter.” Up close, Goyle gave off a strong whiff of whiskey and dirt. Harry tried not to wrinkle his nose.
I assessed Harry from head to toe. “You look nice. Your hair’s in a relatively decent state for once.”
As it turned out, there were no doxies in the room, though I did find the silver boxes on the mantelpiece inscribed with Linear B to be fascinating. I had no idea what they were for, nor what the engravings said, but I resolved to take a closer look at them once this whole business was settled.
Bellatrix grinned, and Draco saw the mad woman in those eyes. “With pleasure.”
“Yes,” Potter intercepted the question. “I thought it would be the safest here. Not many people know about my connections to it, and many of the old protections the Order laid on the place are still extant.”
My father’s look of bad temper did not diminish. “You run entirely with the wrong crowds these days, Draco. First Potter and now Andromeda. Really – Andromeda? That bloody cow? Why can’t you become closer with the Greengrasses? You were engaged to their daughter once.”
We were out in the open moors again, en route to Godric’s Hollow. From there, we would Apparate back to London, where hopefully we would have the time and facilities to examine the Grimoire.
“I was thinking booby-traps,” Harry said dryly. “I’m not Ron. I can handle a few spiders.”
“So you’re saying that this hooded man had interacted with all of the deceased?” Malfoy asked. “And he was in disguise when he came into my club?”
Harry couldn’t really blame him. If the information that Malfoy had provided was accurate, then it was more likely that Ron and Hermione were involved in active rebellion against the Ministry.
Being forced to stay in the house did not agree with me, never mind that my entire flat could probably fit into Potter’s drawing room. For one, my flat was much newer and cleaner. And despite the valiant efforts of Kreacher, the house seemed to resist all efforts to spruce up its living condition beyond somewhat habitable.
They hadn’t even seen anything yet. Just algae on rocks and sea flowers, swaying gently in the current. There was a patch of seagrass that showed up ahead, a furry field dancing in a hypnotic motion.
Relief and exhaustion uncapped his natural reserve, and Draco burst out laughing. He used Finnegan’ s hand to haul himself upright. “It’s been an adventure, I have to admit that.”
“What’s wrong?” Potter looked at me.
“Kreacher!”
Harry Potter. Rank: Commander. Age: 25. Height: 5’10. Weight: 140 pounds. Hair: Black. Eyes: Green. Wand: Standard-Issue Ilex Phoenix Caliber.
“I suppose that’s high praise coming from the Weasel – Weasley,” I corrected hastily, before Harry could scold me. “You didn’t have to get me flowers, by the way. Plants hate me. I can barely keep alive a cactus.”
She had the grace to look slightly ashamed.
“What kind of light?” Riddle asked.
She picked it up. “It doesn’t look like much, does it? It’s heavy for such a small thing –”
Harry shared a look with Draco.
“Oh. Right.” I waved my wand, and the dishes flew to the sink. With another flick, they began to clean themselves. I shrugged at Potter. “I might be not much of a duelist, but my cleaning charms are pretty competent.”
Harry saw the wrist-prong lying by the side. He removed one of the cufflink that contained Hedwig’s Core and unbuttoned his cuff. It was a simple model compared to the ones in the Ministry office, but it was still far beyond the norm for home computers. Harry supposed the deceased did work at home often enough to justify this addition.
“Will you be issuing me a gun?” Draco asked, remembering Shacklebolt mentioning Draco’s ability to shoot.
I sat across from Potter, trying to ignore the irritated unsettledness in my stomach. Potter quirked an eyebrow at me as he settled in, thanking the house-elf who pulled out his chair for him.
“How was that, sir?” Finnegan asked, coming up to join Harry. “What did the Minister want?”
“Oh. We’re eating here?”
“Yes, I know that,” I snapped. “I study the Dark Arts for a living. I’m very aware of delayed onset curses.” I purposely neglected to mention that my focus was on the history of their use, not their use itself, and I had no idea how to identify one.
“Experimental model.” Malfoy looked upon Metis fondly. “It’s taken me five years to get her acclimated to having a body. They’re not just computer programs, you know, SIs. They’re intelligent and have a will of their own, even if they’re born of code.”
“Nice try.”
Theo greeted them onboard.
Almost, but not quite.
Harry recovered first. He maneuvered himself to the front of the car. There was a snick indicating the door was unlocked.
There were shouts accompanied with running footsteps. I tightened my hold on my wand, my nails biting into my palms. There was only a small window for the man to act; any longer and he’d bring the entire park on us. And the Ministry.
“Where’s Harry?” Draco asked instead. “Why are you out here instead of him?”
“Well – all of them. Apparently, you singlehandedly thwarted an assassination attempt on the Minister that involved a hovercar, a light stylus, and a bottle of champagne.”
To his own surprise, Draco found himself sitting beside Granger while they barreled down the narrow country road a few minutes later. It was much too late now to catch the train for London; Draco would check into the village in for the night and call a taxi to the station first thing in the morning.
Harry cut me off with another kiss, one even deeper than our previous. “Draco. Shut up.” He guided us to an alcove.
“Tired of having cold breakfast,” I said, fixing my eyes on a spot above his head. “Besides, I was awake and didn’t want to wallow in bed. Now would you please go put a shirt on?”
Draco hated how the image of Harry being injured – or worse – tore at him. He had tried to project the aloof confidence his father used to wear like a second skin, but he had a feeling it failed miserably. His hands twitched every so often during the meeting, and Draco was certain Harry had noticed.
Draco opened a few gifts that he repeatedly said were unnecessary and ate an enormous slice of cake. Draco thanked Mrs. Weasley for all she had done and then tried to convince her that he had eaten enough.
“Ok, Malfoy, help a co-worker out?”
“A few words on a disgusting napkin does not qualify as notes,” growled Draco as he approached Harry’s desk.
Harry cleared his throat. “I brought you some tea.”
Draco nodded, “I know I want to tell him. I just am not sure the best way to go about it.”
“Did you have a good birthday?” Harry asked.
Harry chuckled, “If we weren’t dating and going to celebrate with all our friends at the Burrow, how would you be celebrating your birthday?”
Draco sat alone at the bar sipping his Firewhisky while he was lost in thought. He was oblivious to the ruckus that was going on around him and didn’t even notice when the stool beside him became occupied. The sound of a throat clearing brought him back to the present. He looked over to see his second cousin smirking at him.
“What’s got you so down, little Malfoy?”
“You are such a git, Potter!” Draco spat. “I’m not your secretary. You know I’m only on filing duty because I got injured.”
“Luna’s a Ravenclaw, but I’m glad you had a good birthday. You know, it’s not over yet.”
“Four months? Why four months?” Draco asked, as he leaned back to look Harry in the eye.
As he stood in the doorway, he observed Draco sitting with his elbows on his desk and head in his hands.
“Can’t you just help a friend out?” Harry asked.
Harry moved to stand between Draco’s legs. “I haven’t been on a date in four months, Draco.”
Draco caught the barkeep’s attention and asked for a quill and parchment. The request got him a strange look, but the barkeep quickly returned with the requested items.
Jumping up from his chair and leaving his tea behind, Draco began to pace next to his desk. “Listen, Potter. I apologize for earlier. That was completely unprofessional. Yes, you did a shit job giving me notes from your case, but I shouldn’t have let it get personal. It’s none of my business what or whom you do outside of work.”
“Listen, I won’t pretend to know what you are talking about, but as someone who has disappointed their family plenty, I have one bit of advice. It’s okay to care about what your parents think, but at the end of the day you gotta make sure you aren’t disappointing yourself.”
“Well, that was weird,” Harry said to himself.
“Because that’s when you broke up with Charles,” Harry replied as he leaned forward and captured Draco’s lips with his own.
I always did appreciate that in a twisted sense. It's nice to have at least one person willing to see somebody who isn't the falsehood presented by the media. I realized I need to do the same for him.
He was having a much easier time than I was with this. Surely there was a better way to do this that didn't involve as much touching or staring.
We had been looking through random books for the rest of the class hour. Only having two classes a day was fantastic.
He stood in awe, his cheeks dusted rose and lips parted as his eyes scanned the buildings.
"Fine, I'll ignore it, but don't ask any more questions and please whatever you do. Don't. Tell. Anyone."
"What's that supposed to mean? Of course, you did. That's why we dated!"
Maybe Malfoy could help? He's smart, right? It's probably a potion and as much as I hate to admit it he's brilliant with those. That was a joke though, Malfoy would never do that for me. Although, it would be helping himself too, and isn't that an extremely Malfoy thing to do?
I remember wanting to stay in that room forever. I remember wanting to run after him, scream at him that I was wrong.
"So, are we good?"
Do you know what? I think the
I feel like I might just be able to pursue him on this one. Smilingly softly, I lean back and take a sip of my butterbeer.
I sent him a questioning look.
I sighed, hanging over the side of my bed upside down. I figured it was getting late and I'm not going to just avoid this. I cast a
I was snapped out of my thoughts when a large barn owl came through the window. I found it easier to leave the window open because I couldn't hear when the owls wanted to get in. I could only hear very loud sounds and even those often came out as muffled. The owl stuck out its leg and I gave it a treat so it would calm down. I open the letter and it read:
I felt like things had gone so fast, yet so slow, over these past weeks. I barely had time to even think about what was going on between us. What was going on between us?
My body had slumped into a state of shock, then the pieces clicked together. The fake smiles, the dark eyes, a room that appeared unused, and a scene, painted in moonlight, with a single person sitting in the woods night after night. How could I have been so stupid?
Draco caught my eye and I noticed my pace speed up just a little bit. I halted in front of the three of them, my friends stopped just behind that. We stood there just for a minute, I suddenly had nothing to say.
She shook her head and pointed at me, "You need me?" She nodded, "Well, alright, but you're going to have to write down what you want to say. Is that ok?"
Malfoy signed. Feeling my cheeks get warm,  I rolled my eyes, mentally cursing myself for breaking eye contact.
"I can't say here, in case someone hears us," I had taken to talking to Hermione instead of signing because it was honestly just easier, even if it felt weird.
I would like to clarify: My previous statements still stand, we did not have sex in the dorm room. Throughout this story, I'm afraid you will not read those scenes. Draco and I would prefer our private lives to stay just that, private. PSA over.
See, Ron has this temper problem, I think it's a Gryffindor thing. He's pretty self-conscious of his friends leaving him so I think he's still a bit rattled after what Ginny told him. I'll add that to one of the reasons why I will not be heading to the Burrow any time soon.
-------------
he rolled his eyes and gave me a look.
And with that, we were alone in the library, practicing sign language for the next few hours. We would occasionally laugh, or our conversations would sidetrack. Just two boys that couldn't sleep and somehow made a neutral agreement not to kill each other.
Just before the candle burned out, I noticed one last phrase in the journal.
I found that after a while it wasn't so bad. I was starting to get the hang of it and certain words were becoming very distinguishable. I would obviously need to test it out on more people than just Draco, but he was an option I definitely didn't mind.
I finally made it to the teacher hallway and wondered if it would be weird to just knock on his private quarters. In the end, I just went for it and knocked. After a few knocks you might have expected me to leave, but when have I been one to do that? So after muttered a quick
I smiled at him. He had a weird way of showing it, but he really did have emotions. Who knew Draco Malfoy was human under that mask?
I looked over to the Slytherin end of the table a lot. It felt oddly like sixth year. My friend's sent me questioning glances, but remained quiet.
The library is not a scary place.
He stuck his thumb towards the door of the library.
I didn't sit by Draco at lunch, but part of me wished I had. Nobody except Hermione could really hold a conversation with me. That isn't their fault, if anything it's mine for not being able to read lips. I've had too many people in life go out of their way to please me so I was glad to have this ounce of normalcy.
A little girl, no older than seven, walked up to me and tapped my calf. I felt bad, little kids are really hard to lip-read and don't know sign language most of the time. I found a piece of paper nearby.
I closed my arms around his waist and stroked his back while he calmed down. Quite honestly, I don't care what was in his dream so long as he's safe. I've never been more glad someone came to me for help.
It was a small crystal orb, with the night sky presented in the glass. The stars would change depending on the location of the magic, as well as the position of Earth. That way no matter where you were, it would always show the stars above. I figured that since it can be hard to see the stars, due to the fog, he might appreciate it.
I sat, bolt upright, and looked out of the drapes I had forgotten to close the previous night. Draco, being the heaviest sleeper ever, just rolled closed and put his cheek on my thigh. I would have thought the notion sweet, had Ron not been staring me down the whole time.
I was shaken out of my trance by a tap on the shoulder.
-----------------
He stared at it with anger in his eyes. I could see the physical pain that
Draco and I fight, all healthy relationships get in arguments occasionally, but we are far more mature now.  I only wanted to add this note because I care about you, and don't want you to use this argument as something that is ok in a relationship. This situation was not good on either of us.
I pulled the curtains away from the bed. I did not expect to have a person fall at my feet, but you see something new every day. After Seamus rolled off the bed, I reached out a hand and helped him up.
We walked down the side-streets, he was so caught up in the beauty of urban life that we didn't need to talk. Our silence said more than words ever could.
I remember when Ron asked me who I did fancy, I simply thought of all the girls I was friends with and picked one. There was no real attachment. The images that popped into my head were just a coincidence.
Then the professor came into the classroom and as she set up I noticed his face contort and his chest become slow and heavy.
I felt him slip something into my pocket.
He started.
I was this close to strangling him. If he insisted on taking the most boring classes this school had to offer I would only fight back with the ones I knew he didn't like.
--------------
The sun had set.
------------------
"Then you stop avoiding mine!"
He nodded,
Before they could do too much damage I cast a quick
Draco grabbed ahold of my hand, "
"You know," I turned back towards her, "I think I will."
I teased, he glared at me in return.
He signed, before taking the necklace out of my hands. He muttered a quick incantation, and the snitch began to grow. The cord morphed into the outer wings of the ball, and it began to fly around Draco's hand.
I didn't want to pity him because I couldn't stand being pitied myself. I could however sympathize. I knew firsthand what it was like to be pushed into something you're not, something bigger than you are. I understand how taxing that can be on your body and mind, how it changes you as a person. I know the feeling of the rumors and remarks behind your back. More than anything I knew what it was like to grow up with a sad excuse of a family. I too felt outcasted by my own flesh and blood.
His face brightened.
I need him now, even if I don't fully understand it.
He stepped close, I could feel his breath on my cheek. "Are you?" he hushed. I didn't respond. "I'll go under one condition."
She agreed and I handed her the small piece of looseleaf.
--------------
"Then you have nothing to worry about." I pointed towards his arm and let go of his chin.
I find myself finding new ways to fall for this man every day.
I smiled, "
I had a striped red jumper and a plain green one laid on my bed. They both looked fine, but I just couldn't decide. Ron tapped my shoulder.
I watched his lip quiver slightly. I don't' think his sign language has ever been this sloppy.
I sent him a funny look and he just shoved the stuff into my hands.
"Why don't you read it for yourself..." He placed two fingers on his temple and fell back onto the bed with a visual sigh.
I looked over and saw Draco with his back to the line, he had been packaging the same box for just a little too long. I tapped him on the shoulder, and as he turned around I noticed he had his wand in his hand. It was shoved up his sleeve in less than a second.
Tripping and catching yourself on my arms.
Draco looked up from his battered copy of
Man, that would have sounded cooler if I had studied my signs more.
When I reached the door I found it was already open. I closed the door behind me and took in the familiar room. There were still portraits all over the room. Two of them I noticed immediately and it took all my willpower, not to breakdown.
What I found strange was that once the light was gone from where it had been, there was still a faint glow. I tried to find the source only to see a small torch in the distance, floating mid-air. It was attached to a hand, but that nad had nobody.
That made sense. I have no clue what could cause that kind of emotional epiphany, but I'm not sure if I want to find out.
I had become attached. I knew what I wanted, I can only hope he felt the same.
didn't want to take that class.
He shook his head sleepily and pulled me down so his cheek was on my chest. I felt his legs entangle with mine, and in that second, I couldn't imagine how I had lived without this.
He shoved the vial into my hands. "
Draco bent down and took the laces in his hands. Very quickly he tied them and then stood up. My breath hitched slightly, remembered my thoughts from earlier. He was awfully close.
I made it out alive, but I wasn't truly living. I've never felt so alone in my life. At least when I lived with the Dursley's I hadn't had the experience of feeling accepted and welcomed. I've said many times that Hogwarts is my first real home and that couldn't be more true. Throughout everything and everybody, every challenge, and snide remark, every dark wizard and light, I still had people on my side that knew what I was going through.
"Believe me so am I." I saw the three snakes up ahead, perched by the back entrance to town. I waved to them, only Draco waved back. "See," I chuckled nervously, "they're all fine."
The only time I had ever seen someone use an
"Keep it. It has a charm similar to the catalogs in the library, so it shouldn't run out of pages." He gathered his things and reached a hand out for me to take.
She may have looked a little concerned.
When I made it to the dorm half the people were either studying or in the common room. Ron on the other hand was reading the last issue of
------------
I sighed,
It was then I realized again, just how broken he probably was. I doubt many people had given him that offer, much less he take them up on it.
Ok, so let's ignore the fact that he's a guy because that doesn't really matter at the moment. He's been really nice these past two months, but does that makeup for everything he's done in the past? It seemed so petty to say no to that when I had been equally bad to him.
I tapped his shoulder, "Uh, you ok?" I ask while looking at his pile.
He signed while looking at the two shirts.
I wasn't sure what I wanted to see on the other side, but this was much more beautiful than I could have imagined. In the center of this clearing there lay and small blue flower. Obviously magical, yet still so enchanting, like I would never need anything else again.
Resting a hand on her shoulder she flinched, "Hey Gin, you have a minute?"
"You sound guilty," I stated with recognition seeping into my tone.
Draco signed, a little too slowly. He struggled out of the bed, but his leg caught the covers and he fell to the ground. In end, he pulled everything off the bed. And by everything, I mean everything.
The perfect fit.
"I just said, I never said I was. While we're on the topic, who was it you actually cheated on me with?"
She rolled her eyes and tightened her cloak around her neck.
What do you mean?
I wish I could have heard his footsteps, then it would have been a thousand times easier to find him. I wasn't particularly worried about him having the book. Perhaps he would just let me borrow it, or maybe he knew where the other ones were?
I noticed the long red hair out of the corner of my eye. Ginny looked smug like she was finally going to get back at me for something I didn't do, well sort of.
On the one hand, I had been dreaming of this moment since I was struck with that damn spell on the battlefield. On the other hand, Draco needed this much more than I did. At first, I couldn't figure out why, but then I realized the sheer privilege I have over him.
The question was more rhetorical if nothing, but I still nodded dumbly.
He nodded towards the doors and a loud crash was heard a few halls down. The battle was in full swing.
I'm the insufferable one?
I sat down across from him, he was engrossed in an old Shakespeare novel. I took the book you of his hands.
He looked a little hurt.
Ok, so I have come to a very bad conclusion.
He was lying through his teeth... hands? I don't know, anyways. He didn't feel like he could tell me. The strangest thing was, I felt hurt. I wanted to move past this hatred. How could we do that if he didn't loosen up a bit?
I wince at both Ron's bluntness and 'Minone's attempt to hide the present situation. I knew it was hard on Ron as well, he loved Ginny and to see her upset because of me probably hurt. She didn't seem to care about me at the time so I didn't see the problem when I did it. I still feel guilty about it, now that I've had time to think, and I also knew I should have done it long before the war started. It wasn't fair on her to make her date someone that wasn't present for the majority of their relationship. The things she said after, the things she admitted to... it left us both sore. I don't think we could ever come to an agreement after that. I was too harsh, she was damaged and I should have stayed even if it would have hurt me. I hadn't cared about myself for years why did it matter
Entering the common room felt nice. I could have slept by the fire if people wouldn't have judged me. We walked up to the boys' dorms and there were two rooms. About ten boys in each room. One of the dorms was entirely made up of Ravenclaws so we both knew we were put into the second.
Draco seemed to mutter something that was obviously a curse. After a quick cleaning charm and hastily put on robes, he moved to me.
He stood swiftly, moving directly in front of me.
I walked down the full shelves to the back where we normally sat. The moonlight was filtering through the thin, silk curtains on the windows causing a glow around the room. I saw the warm tint fade into view and I knew Draco had beat me here. He did love the library.
I woke up like any other morning. Ron rolled me onto the floor, I bruised my hip, and Draco was just a teeny-tiny bit kinder to me.
Standing up again, I sent him a confused look. He shrugged, grabbed the first novel in sight, walked past me, and sat at a table.
I walked over to a little island that was filled with different sweets and pastries, all packaged nicely. I knew coming here that Draco wouldn't be able to buy anything, so I made sure to bring some of my leftover money stash from when I lived with the Dursleys. It wasn't much, only about 15 pounds, or so.
—————
His eyes narrowed in response.
"No, it probably won't even go anywhere so nobody needs to know."
"You have such a way with words," I reached across the space and wiped a stray tear from his eye as he let out a weak laugh.
He nodded in acknowledgement, but I'm not really sure he understood.
And then, we were alone again. Normally I hate other people dictating my life without me, but I wish nothing more than for someone else to make this decision instead.
She wasn't wrong, but I still felt a bit offended on behalf of my friend.
---------------
A figure tapped my shoulder, I had grown so used to it that I didn't even jump this time. I turned to see Draco, pointy and pale, yet stunningly himself.
"Yeah, hang on." I walked over to him and tossed it next to him. He opened it to write and I turned around to get into pajamas.
Draco unlaced his hand from mine and pushed open the large double doors. The first thing I noticed was that the room was empty, save the nurse and Mr A. We approached them swiftly.
"It's just... I don't know what I-," he chuckled at my embarrassment.
Every time the sparks.
His eyes fluttered for a brief second and he breathed, slowly.
He made move to leave the library and I let him go. He took the torch with him so that he could find his way back. He wasn't allowed to use his wand in the corridors, some strange part of his probation.
His breath evened out, and I stroked his hair until I was certain he was asleep. I wish I could have stayed awake to watch his sleep (I'm not a creep I swear!), but I too was feeling tired.
The man was taller than I was, probably not quite up to Malfoy. He had sandy grey hair and extremely dark eyes. After the war, I knew to grow wary of everyone, but I had no reason to be with him. I would have known if he was a Death Eater because I had been forced to go to almost every trial that was held, including Malfoy's. He could be one of the ones that have yet to be caught, but polyjuice and glamors were very risky after what happened in fourth year. I decided he would be fine for now. Innocent until proven guilty.
I looked over at Draco to see him crouched down by the lowest books, something about magical first aid. His hair fell into his eyes and I had the strange urge to brush it away for him. He must have noticed me staring because he looked over and quirked an eyebrow.
When we separated, he leaned back on his hand and reached towards me with a similar package. His was much more elegantly wrapped than mine, and I almost felt bad about ripping it apart. Almost.
I'll have to talk to them about that later.
"Who made you realize it? You must have had someone on the side for you to figure it out!"
I didn't even go the dinner that night because I was so hung up on the note. So when I first read it nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be there. He wanted to help me investigate my newest problem and who was I to deny some support?
I backed away fast like I had been burned. I ran over to Draco and grabbed his forearm. He looked confused and upset at being taken from his discovery but didn't question it. I ran faster than I would have thought possible.
I really don't get the hype of the library, but for some reason, people think it's the perfect place to meet.
I smiled, "Yeah, something like that." He snorted and captured my lips again, this time I was prepared.
I watched as the clock on the wall of the infirmary ticked the passing seconds. A chill passed through be before I replied, "
she pointed to me, "
The Dark Mark was a very taboo subject in the Wizarding World. Several people that had it were allowed to walk free. Draco being one, though he was still on probation. Snape was given a few different awards for his death, claiming it as a noble sacrifice. Most, however, were in Azkaban.
I hadn't realized how late it was. It was around midnight by my watch's time. I was out past curfew, again.
He smiled towards her, "Please don't take too long," Ron nodded in agreement from a meter away.
"Are you mad? You pull me along only to leave me for a whole year and then announce you've gone off to kill yourself!? How dare you! Fred's gone and you decide now's the perfect time to leave. Did you ever care about me or was I just a distraction in sixth year?" She was getting progressively angrier and I was grateful nobody was around to hear us over the loud noise echoing in the Hall.
Alright, so I was a little (a lot) more awkward now than I was a few weeks ago, but can you blame me.
When I got back to the common room I was somewhat surprised to see Ron and Hermione sprawled out across the floor, books surrounding them.
"I know." He met my eyes, they were such a piercing grey it was hard to look away. My eyes did, however, wander to a little lower. "I didn't say anything either, Harry."
The conversation continued, but my mind was stalled. For some reason, "friends" had stung.
My life had become so routine, in fact, that I was unable to see anyway that something could interfere.
Part of me wanted to be involved in their conversation, the other part didn't want to talk to anyone ever again. After Neville had tried to include me and Hermione had to explain I felt even worse. Maybe he could take my place with them. It could have been him. I've never been more thankful it wasn't. Never in my life would I wish that fate on somebody else. He had already gone through enough and my problems never seemed that big compared to other people's.
He grabbed onto my hand and bicep, maybe a bit tighter than necessary.
He laughed,
" His eyebrows scrunched inward and he looked me dead in the eyes.
Hogsmede didn't go nearly as planned.
He tends to get angry and leave situations that feed into these thoughts, I knew he would come around though. I still couldn't help but be furious with Ginny. The worst part is, there's really not much I could do about it.
He jumped slightly, I guess he didn't actually expect me to be awake. He shook his head, but slowly it turned into a nod. What I would give to read his mind right now...
and grinned.
-----------------
Both boys had managed to corner Draco and he was entirely helpless. When you can't hear not only do you not know when an ambush may happen, you also don't know what they're ambushing you with so you can cast the proper countercurse.
The class went by smoothly, save the strange looks from my friends that Draco and I didn't hex each other to pieces.
We only had two classes a day with a lunch break in between. I'm pretty sure Hermione convinced McGonagall to let her take more, but I never asked.
He grabbed my wrists and lowered my hands.
I knew it was rare for people here to hate me, especially after fifth year and before fourth. I became more self-aware in my time alone, that didn't mean I had to like it, but thinking didn't change anything. If Malfoy could show the world that even I wasn't perfect, then he would have those Slytherins wrapped around his finger.
he walked out of the dorm leaving me in stunned silence.
After what could have been an eternity, my sense of time would forever be screwed up, he pulled away. We didn't move from the strange tangle we found ourselves in and just stated at each other.
They were impossible to miss. The family consisted of a single mother with about five little kids tugging on the hem of her skirt, leaning against a wall, or just sitting next to her to keep warm.
Mr A smiled for the first time, his teeth razor sharp. "
"Well... I don't really need any girl advice." I could see the gears turning in her head, her mouth forming a small "O".
She caught my eye before going to my side, "And Potter, call me Pansy.
I shook my head because I had no clue. We both went off to find the tenth book. Finally,
She tapped her chin and stuck a book in her back.
We walked around the large department store for a little over an hour. Draco wanted to investigate everything he had never seen before. While I had seen most of the items to store carried, I was intrigued nonetheless.
My hand was cramped once I had finished. I passed the book to Draco for him to read.
She laid a hand on my shoulder,
Ron and Hermione both nodded slightly at the remark but decided to remain quiet. This was exceeding awkward.
I carefully removed the hood and stood in shock. It was Mr. A, and he appeared to be sleeping. That must be why his room seemed barely used, but it didn't explain why he slept out here in the first place.
Draco had his head buried in his book. It was getting late so I thought it would be best to head to the dorms and get some work done.
She nodded, "Yes, and if you tell anybody about it, I'll tell the whole school about you."
" I commented with wide eyes.
I responded hastily. Quickly throwing my things into my bag, I waved to the teacher as Mr. A whispered something to her and she got the class's attention again.
Hermione scolded with her arms akimbo.
"No, nothing like that." I had no clue how to start this conversation. "I think I might... I don't know Hermione. I need therapy or something at this point."
I also had decided to leave Mr. A alone for the time being. I was really enjoying talking to Draco and searching the library for just one other book we could use that I didn't want to ruin that. He also had given me no further reasons so be worried, so I'll just let him give the books up on his own time.
I picked up a book on wizarding politics for Hermione and went to pay for it.
I slowly opened the curtains to my bed and peeked out. It's so hard being deaf at night, I feel a hundred times more likely to wake everyone up. I tried my best to be quiet as my eyes adjusted to the light.
He turned around,
His eyes widened, why hadn't we thought of that yet?
I gave him a smirk.
Draco's eyes widened and he edged closer. "
On the map, I found Draco on the third-floor on his way to DADA, our first class of the day. What made me nervous was he wasn't alone. I broke off into a sprint with Ron close behind.
, I entered his living space.
It's no secret that a lot of people hate Smith and it's not like he ever liked me so it was a fair game. They both, however, were in the DA, so when I saw them using the spells I taught them outside of class I would have been proud. This was not that case.
We had settled into the aisle farthest back of the Library. A small can was flickering in between us casting a soft hue on Draco's face. It was times like these that I wish I had full use of my senses. I miss the loud sounds of silence.
One thing I love about sign language is that all you need is eye contact and a nice view of their hands. Meaning, people couldn't listen in and we didn't have to be close.
As Hermione read that she mentioned something to Ron and he just shook his head. Probably something that didn't concern me. Some part of my mind thought that maybe that's exactly the reason they didn't want me to know.
It was perfectly ok if other people were, that didn't affect me. It did, however, affect me if I was the one being attracted to that.
----------------------
I smiled, "Anytime."
"Yeah, no problem." He wasn't allowed to use his wand in the hallway no matter what. We talked about it in one of our meetings.
she snapped her head at Seamus, who was sitting next to her. After a small verbal lashing, by the looks of it, she turned back.
He remained silent. (well he always was technically silent, but that's beside the point)
We still hadn't added every core class, but we were probably fine. The only cores left were Herbology and History of Magic. I could only take so much of Professor Binns's goblins and if I wasn't deaf I was pretty sure the Mandrakes would ensure I would never hear again. I didn't really like Muggle Studies, considering I was raised by them and there were about ten other classes that sounded better, but if it pissed Malfoy off it was worth it.
Inside the small box was a necklace. The cord was made of braided leather, and it held a charm that exactly resembled a Golden Snitch.
peeking out of the top of his herbology textbook.
she leaned over and pecked Blaise on the cheek,  "We'll be back soon."
He took out his wand and conjured up some parchment and quill. I offered to write, but he claimed my "chicken scratch" would be impossible for McGonagall to read and we would be stuck with Hagrid for every class cleaning up after the Thestrals. He wrote down potions first and I almost screamed at him, of course, he wouldn't have heard it. "
The order of the beds goes as follows (front to back):
Way back in sixth year, I had been going through a strange period in my life. I had finally understood what it meant to truly fancy someone. The problem was it was never who I wanted it to be.
Finally, the lump in my throat dissipated. I signed and spoke at the same time,
The late November air burned my cheek as I stepped out of the castle and into the dimming night.
Chuckling, I replied,
Towards the end, he caught my stare, and again I felt that unfamiliar heat in my face. Probably embarrassment.
Oh please, like you are able to talk.
Well, that was a relief. I'm not as upset as I thought I would be that he read that. It's just one less person who has to find out and he should know at some point.
That was all I needed to make my choice. I couldn't leave somebody in a very similar position to me to attend a school full of people who would hate his every move. I wouldn't allow the pettiness of others to damage the already very crumbled soul of Draco Malfoy. I needed to make amends, I needed to at least not be a complete arse to him when we went back. Whether or not he decided to do the same was up to him. I didn't even know if he was coming back. I, for one, know I wasn't one to hold a grudge, him on the other hand not so much.
," he gave a small smile. Wow, he looked good in the dim lighting.
I really wish I had paid more attention to Herbology. I nodded dumbly and watched him walk closer to the plant.
I felt my heart rate soften as he smiled back. When did I become so mushy?
why didn't his friends say anything? "
We split up at the gate, I sighed at the loss of his hand in mine, but I needed to be alone for this. Christmas was fast approaching, only about three weeks away, and I hadn't gotten Draco a present yet.
Like I said before, I am not gay.
He pointed to the small paper bag I had just purchased.
Hermione gave me a hard glare.
Even that was gone
I handed it back and they both leaned in to read it. Hermione scooted closer to him and Ron slyly took her unused hand into his.
Maybe things wouldn't be so bad after all.
"Wait until people find out. They'll hate you, you know that right?" I was about to take my leave just then. "If I see you again, I won't let you control me with this. Goodbye Gin."
His eyes darkened, and his body slouched.
He stood up and walked to the entrance.
to get word of some new rumors about my love life. Which, by the way, there isn't one.
I opened my arms towards him, waving his body forward. He seemed so unsure of himself in that moment, but his pride lost his inner battle. He crashed onto me, wrapping his arms around my neck so tight I could hardly breathe. If there was any way to die, this wouldn't be so bad.
"I'm sorry Harry. I can't be with you anymore after I tell you this. It wouldn't be right."
The walk back to our dorms was silent and tense. Silent because we couldn't hear, and tense because we had to agree on something. I'm not sure there is much in life I've siding with Draco Malfoy on, but then again I never really knew him. He has changed and it's easy to tell. I feel he doesn't want to admit it though. That's why Pansy was hesitant to explain.
she signed with a straight face.
what that mission was.
One last time.
He picked up a piping bag of white buttercream and placed it down again. "
Well, you might want to spread the word faster. I mean, we know you didn't leave school last night, but some people think otherwise.
With a large heave, I managed to pull myself away from the comfort of my own bed. The only relief I could find was the fact that even though I was going to see Draco, didn't mean I was going to tell him.
Hermione signs quickly.
"Can you feel that?" He nodded his head. "Concentrate, breathe with the beat," we were so close it was almost impossible for him not to see what I said.
It was Draco, he appeared to have been watching our encounter.
Draco was never there. He was in the background in the war, almost like he had disappeared, only to show up when we had forgotten his existence. He was hardly ever at the battle, there are no memories with him like the others. Years ago I would have said this made him a coward, but I am forever thankful that he wasn't there.
Fun? "
I had mulled it over for the past week and I really thought I could escape it. Turns out the more you run from your feelings, the more they take you over.
had been checked out. I sat down and leaned against the shelves. We had been searching for over an hour and came out completely empty-handed.
"Knock, knock," I wrapped the bedpost twice. Dean popped out of the covers, the blush wasn't super noticeable on his complexion, but it was obviously there.
It was then he remembered why he was here in the first place. I don't think the Ministry of Magic would be too kind on an ex- Death Eater ranting about how evil muggles were. "
Draco leaned in closer, I could feel his breath on my face. "You sure?" Oh. My. Merlin. This was really happening, did my heart always beat this fast?
I crossed my arms over my chest and heaved a heavy sigh. This was going nowhere.
When Mr A returned he seemed noticeably more distraught.
charm and hit my head on the ground.
He turned around to find a park bench.
Now, dear readers, I hope this situation has not upset you to much. Writing this scene, looking back, I realize I should have done things very differently. It was very difficult to relive this moment, which is why I will leave out some of the less glamorous moments in this chapter.
by none other than Ron Weasley.
I know Mcgonagall said we should both have a "hearing capable" person by us, but we kinda threw that out the window pretty quickly. She nodded goodbye and I made my way to the Headmistress's office.
I now had another reason to add to the growing list of why I should make amends with him. I needed to be kinder. He hadn't done anything this time, which was unusual. Normally he started everything we had a spat about. I realized it was probably for appearances and to show how much power he held over the Slytherins.
I started, "That was-"
I motioned, closing the curtain shut and casting a soft
Again just like the last morning, the dorms were practically empty except for three people. Ron soon left again, without a word.
The forest left a lingering chill on my skin. I shivered, both from the memory and cold.
"Like what you see then?" He mouthed, very clear within the close proximity.
People looked over to us as we walked in. It must have seemed weird for us not to be yelling at one another. That's the thing with this whole predicament. It didn't make it into the papers. Ever since I had managed to shut up the Daily Prophet after the war, they didn't write as much petty gossip. I sometimes wish they had, it would be a lot easier than having to tell everybody. It did feel nice though to be in control of this personal side of me. I wondered if that's how Draco felt too?
I looked over to Draco. He had a strange look in his eye, but in the end, just shrugged.
He yanked me to a stop and I could see why. His mouth had fallen open, "
Draco and I agreed to give each other our Christmas presents on New Year's Eve. It was his turn to come up with a date idea, so I was intrigued when I received his note the previous day.
He looked back at me aghast as I packed up my stuff and fled the Dining Hall.
Is it bad that sometimes I don't want a cure? I know it's horribly selfish, but I like that we can really only communicate with each other. I get scared to lose that when we find the cure. Its something special, something only we understand.
He cast something that turned out to be a
Oh, so he was laughing at my stupidity not my signing.
she gave me the side-eye,
Here is why I think that list is becoming a problem based on the past few weeks.
From that moment on I remember one thing only. The feel of his lips on mine.
she huffed, crossing her arms over her chest.
Before I knew it, the candle was blown out, and I felt someone grab my hand. Draco pulled me towards the back room of the library with only a wand for light. If I wasn't aware that the book registry was in there I might have been slightly concerned.
with that lovely note he whisked out of the bathroom.
clear. I wished we could be a bit more progressive, but how can we if we still are proactively living in the middle ages. With these thoughts and some glares and stares from my dormmates, I hopped into bed and closed the curtains tight.
I cut him off with a shimmering stag kneeling by his feet. He yelped, but then calmly composed himself as though nothing happened.
He waved us over to the small couch in the center of the room.
------------
He nodded then seemed to gain some confidence. We crossed the barrier of bushes.
His gaze drifted to the floor below, he picked at the hem of his trousers. "
He was reading a note as he walked, kinda careless if you ask me. Oh, it was Ginny's note.
He shot me a look that said I was going onto dangerous territory.
"What?" He said lightly.
He held the door open and motioned for us to leave.
I jumped when I felt the tap on my shoulder. Hermione stood there, arms akimbo, waiting for me to say something.
he retorted.
He rolled his eyes and leaned forward on the table,
One thing I absolutely hate about sign language is that they have to look at you to see it. He had turned his head, forcing the conversation to end. I didn't want him to get the wrong idea.
"So, that's all I was. Someone to fool around with." Her face was laced with more anger and mock hurt.
I signed back, laughing at his confused look I walked away from him and back into the chilly London air.
-----------------------
Draco and I walked down to the kitchens that morning for a more private breakfast. When we entered there was immediately a swarm of tiny house-elves at our feet. Some hid a little from Draco, but others were just excited for some new faces.
I started,
I figured we could be friends and probably would have been years ago if we had both phrased that initially meeting differently. So, maybe this was the time to fully put that aside. Let's face it, I had a great time last night and he wasn't at all how I was used to seeing him. I wondered if that was due to the fact we finally didn't have a real motive to kill each other or he was allowed to put down his Maly Mask for the first time ever.
I nodded my head and we walked over to the book catalog. The library book catalog wasn't on a computer, we didn't have those and I've never had to use one in the first place so I wouldn't be much help. It was multiple tables set to spin with a turn of a handle. The tables each had huge books on them, probably magicked to hold more than it shows. We each wrote down a list of all the books that could possibly help us. I went to find them and Hermione went in another direction.
He waved me over, tired as I may have been Ron was still my best friend.
She quickly explained to Ron who had tuned out our signing and was looking over at something. Maybe someone?
On closer inspection I noticed a dark clump leaning against a tree. I walked up to it and noticed that it was just a person wearing a cloak.
Ron whispered something to Hermione that I obviously couldn't catch. I have to ask Draco how he does that because this is getting annoying.
But she couldn't understand what was going through my head the year we had gotten together. I was going through a tough time and she was right in away. She was more of a distraction or an experiment. I felt sick at the thought of using her like that.
Then I thought of it, the perfect idea.
I signed, though my hands were still sticky.
"Only if you make it out alive," I breathed. I wasn't sure what was happening, my stomach twisted.
He signed lazily.
to think about.
Maybe my "Emotional Epiphany" wasn't so bad. I could get used to this, and I had a strong feeling I was going to.
He really had changed. No name-calling, finishing my sentence, and telling me where he would be so we could figure this out? Yup, definitely changed.
"Yeah mate, she's gonna be a mess. I don't know what's been going on this year, but she seems really shifty whenever someone brings you up. Try the Great Hall by... she might still be there."
he signed matter-of-factly.
to end a note is when they really,
------------------------
He seemed to struggle between rolling his eyes and being grateful. He just squeezed my hand and dropped them to his side, never letting go.
------------------------
I dreamt of dark eyes, sign language, yelling redheads, and soft blonde hair.
It was nice being with him. He was the only person at the moment who could truly make me forget about the war. All of my other friends carried so much baggage, and I am constantly reminded of their worn faces of battle.
I felt the heat to my cheeks, "
"You're a git Malfoy!" I called after him. I don't know how loud it was, but he wouldn't be able to hear it anyways.
Overall, I think yesterday could have gone much worse so I was in high hopes on my way down to the library that night.
Mr. A signed as the rest of the class looked to where Draco had gone.
--------------
We ended up having a gingerbread house competition. Draco is the literal definition of a perfectionist, but without knowing how to use his hands to make it, he failed epically. Mine was no beauty either, but even he couldn't deny that I won.
I returned the small smile,
She let out a small snort,
He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. Slowly his lips moved, forming the familiar words that fell silent on our ears. A thin strand of silver drew out of his wand, yet nothing more came.
I signed.
"I never said anything like that!" I really felt backed into a corner here. Why couldn't we go back to who she cheated on me with?
So, is it true?
That liar. I know for a fact that one of the whole reasons we meet is for him to avoid sleeping. He never elaborated on that.
I woke up by being shaken out of bed by none other than Ron Weasley. When I fell, I sat up and checked the time. Great, I had slept through breakfast. I looked over to the bed next to mine and saw the familiar head of blonde hair was also asleep. That's another I've noticed. If you don't have sounds to wake you up, you sleep for extremely long amounts of time.
"What do you mean guilty?" Her eyes were no longer glued to mine.
I saw the fatherly twinkle in Dumbledore's eyes, slightly masked by the magical paint. The second face was one that had been the temporary headmaster the year I wasn't present. Snape seemed less cold now like he wasn't holding in a thousand secrets. I wish I had known him like that instead of the rude potions professor that failed my every assignment. If only he had seen my mother in me instead of my father.
I flushed, not knowing how to explain I was using the map on him.
They did that annoying thing that couples do where they seem to be talking without moving their mouths. They can talk all they want, I wouldn't be able to understand.
he drawled, glancing at my shoes.
Classes had gone into full swing, so it was hard to find a time to hang out with Ron and Hermione. I hate being a third-wheel to them. I've grow to understand that if we don't have free time that I should just let them be when we finally do.
I smirked. He obviously didn't like that. If there was one person who hated Divination as much as Hermione, it was Malfoy.
Taking his hand, I lead him out into the area outside of Hogsmede. After taking a portkey out of my pocket, Draco pulls back.
"Takes one to know one Harry. " She said with a smirk.
I thought about what he said as he sent me a funny look.
It was a little before midnight. The library windows were dark and our small torchlight casted a warm hue across the shelves.
When our feet his solid ground I was able to fully take in where we landed.
When I found him he was in a surprisingly different state than last time. He looked slightly more put together than he had been in the last few weeks. He looked like the Draco from two years ago.
I found Draco sitting by the famous Oak Tree, which really isn't that famous because I didn't know it existed, on a blanket set up for a picnic. I felt a smile settle onto my face as he glanced up from his latest read,
I signed, motioning him towards my side of the room. I patted a spot on my bed for him to sit.
has grown on me.
It wasn't until we got into the Great Hall that I actually regretted coming back. I pushed the doors open with Ron and Hermione behind me. I wouldn't have noticed the chatter of the room dying if they hadn't all been looking right at me. Suddenly I thought maybe going in first wasn't a good idea. Maybe going back to Hogwarts hadn't been a good idea.
He walked away from the teachers' corridor and we headed back towards the library.
He stared back at me blankly.
I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow.
"Fine," I sat on the bed next to her. Placing my elbows on my knees I let out an exasperated sigh. "I don't know how to say this because I'm not even sure what I need to tell you."
I don't know how that's possible, but it didn't really matter at the moment. We just needed to know why he had those books and how to get them from him.
Draco reached out and put his hand on my upper arm. "I think I do know what. Is it- um can I?"
---------------
At that, he made a move to get up and stand. When his right knee buckled he let out a sigh and put his head against the wall. Ron tried to hide his sniggering with the back of his hand.
She kneeled over her brother with many of the other Weasleys. Some, like Ron, were trying to push it away and finish the Battle first. Ginny could barely move.
I laughed at his expression,
Nothing
he scoffed, but remained interested,
"So-"
The lights were off which wasn't strange because it was night. I yelled his name a few times, still nothing. I wouldn't give up though. I went to his bedroom and opened it. The bed was empty, in fact, it looked unused. The covers had dust on them and there wasn't a single wrinkle in them.
I knew he was talking about the liquid I held tightly in my fist, but as the doors shut behind him, I couldn't help but think that wasn't what he was talking about at all.
He groaned,
In hindsight, the latter was what I should have done. Instead, for the first time, I felt like a coward. I was such a coward. There was him, who I had wedged into my life, and now I was letting him go. I can't believe how stupid I was.
"Do you think we'll ever find a cure?" His hands snapped me out of my daze. Honestly, sometimes when I'm with him I forget I'm deaf. It's like speaking with someone from a totally different country, you forget not everyone communicates the same.
We left the Hall and I took out my map. Ron gave me a strange look and I thought it best that now if he needed to ask a question I wouldn't be able to understand it.
He let out a snort.
causing me to take both of their wands and their hair to turn into brightly colored flowers. I refused to use spells that would actually cause them harm, I wouldn't feel much better than them. In their shock, they ran away leaving the three of us in the hallway.
After word got out that Ginny and I broke up, all that they talked about was, "Why would they ruin something that was meant to be?" and "Foul play in the lastest Potter relationship!" and, my personal favorite, "Harry Potter has been Imperiused by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named from the dead, and here's proof!"
She walked in between Draco and me, slipped both her hands into our pockets.
Draco had been targeted greatly for being the only Death Eater to walk out on probation. Most didn't take too kindly to this, but luckily Hogwarts has been able to hold some of the more unsavoury opinions from being unleashed. He had already been attacked at least once, who would be there to help him once school was out? With a disability like ours, it only enlarges the target on our backs.
Madam Prince was the same old lady I had always known. Now, she couldn't get mad at me for being "too loud" and even if she did I wouldn't be able to hear it. I wasn't quite sure how she survived the war, maybe she wasn't there. She sat behind a small desk in the corner, papers littering the top of it. Her and Hermione started up a conversation. After a minute, it was cut short and Hermione looked anything but pleased.
"I want to kill that reporter," I said, squeezing my eyes shut.
It wasn't very long, I was kinda thankful for that. One can only handle so much at a time. He still had that protective aura about him, like he was holding my life-force delicately in his hands. I melted into his touch.
Finally, that damn handshake was renewed.
The next morning I ended up on the floor
He chuckled, handing me a sandwich.
I really don't deserve friends like her.
I slid on the green one and Draco turned back to his bed.
his eyes roamed anywhere but us.
I need to go to sleep, preferably for the rest of eternity.
He got over it and let out "
As I made my move towards the table I made sure to take note of who was there. I saw almost everybody seated casually. Then I took a double-take. Draco was gone. This normally wouldn't have bothered me, (ok yes it would have, but we won't talk about my strange "Malfoy Curiosity™") but when your sworn nemesis for seven years is all of a sudden not a stuck-up git for one night, you tend to reevaluate how you really feel towards them.
Draco came stumbling into the noisy bustle of activity and had a slight scowl on his face after tripping over a House Elf. We locked eyes, and his face softened greatly.
I went out to see Hagrid once over the past weeks. He hasn't changed much, but I do miss his voice. It was so unique and the book did nothing with his scratchy handwriting. I mention a few of the things that had been on my mind, not saying any names. Hagrid has always been a sort of therapist when I needed it. He's a great listener.
In recent events, we have found a fantastic addition to the saga that is Harry Potter. Previously we have delved into Potter's mysterious love-life as well as his connections with on Ex-Death-Eater, Draco Malfoy. What if I were to tell you that both may not be as distant as we may have thought?
I was slightly offended,
When I made it to the Great Hall for breakfast something was off.
I was fully aware of how hard it would be to be back in that school and also trying to get an education without hearing was less than ideal. I was positive that the teachers knew of my situation, but for once in my life, I didn't want to be alone in this. I needed someone there who had gone through what I had. My friends put up with me and went along with everything, but they didn't have the same pain and pressure I did. Malfoy would have to do for now.
I let go and walk around so he can see my signs.
The first feeling was shock. I wasn't stiff like I thought I would be, not that I thought about this happening often. He tilted his head to the side in order to give me more room and I complied.
Hermione replied.
I took my wand back out and muttered an
I looked back at him as he settled in. He had the audacity to wink.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So you are then!"
-----------
He put the parchment back on the table and whisked out of the library. Why was he so difficult? I watched him close the doors and my head dropped to the table.
He leaned in fast, capturing my mouth in his. I guess Madam Pomfrey will have to wait a bit.
Draco sat on the bed nearby and patted the spot beside him. I settled in next to him.
Parkinson chimed in. At least they agreed on something? Even if that was to be as far away from each other as possible.
"What do you mean?" The air had deflated from my chest. I've always loved Ginny even if it wasn't the way she expected me to.
I had no clue what to get him. I know he appreciated getting gifts, but I wanted mine to be special. God, I sound so cliche, but then again so is romance.
Ron quite visibly cringed, his emotions going haywire. His eyes locked to mine, showing an intensity I didn't know existed.
She sent me a knowing look. She obviously got something I didn't.
Once were had made it out the door, he turned and signed, "We're going to hide away today. No sense worrying over something we can't help. I'll fake being sick, and you just get your little trio to cover for you. Simple and much less stress."
I read the note over Draco's shoulder. There's no way that only ten cans were enough for that family. I sent him a look, he only replied with a knowing smile.
Come on mate, you know I of all people am not Homophobic. Also, I think you're lying. I really do want to believe Ron, that you were with them, but I don't know. I am still curious as to what you and dean talked about.
Draco motioned the same sign back to her and she wrapped her arms around his knees. As she skipped away, Draco turned towards me. "
We hadn't told anybody those thoughts.
"Go with her," and he was gone too.
Well, that was true I guess. Breaking into the same quarter two days in a row was not my ideal way to get to know the new guy, but when have I ever been ideal.
--------------
The plan for the day was to meet up with Zambini and Parkinson at Hogsmede. Draco and I really wanted them to get along so we were going to split off into groups of two, one of each. It would also give us an opportunity to sort things out without our friends being suspicious.
Hermione tapped her foot at the bottom of the stairs in the entrance hall.
He fell into step with me, our knuckles brushing.
They had already read the article by the time I found them before breakfast. The plan was that Draco had been sick with a mild case of dragon pox for the past day, and I was with them last night, so there would have been no way for the story to be true.
He looked up and for the first time, I saw a truly unguarded expression on his face. He seemed so vulnerable writing about things he used to have to hide. I can't imagine how it would be to not even be able to think about Muggles. I was raised the complete opposite of Draco.
I knew Draco could tell me first, that is if he did like me back which is a very small probability, but his bravery was hard to come by. I was supposed to be the outgoing one and even this was too much for me. Voldemort was a walk in the park compared to this. (Maybe not, but you get the point)
He peaked out of the curtains surrounding us. I watched as he nimbly crept out of the bed and waved me forward.
He placed a hand over his heart and mocked hurt. Glad to see he's back to usual.
Trust me his sign is getting better. Well, maybe not but, he's getting there.
He sent a genuine smile, a rare feature on his face.
Parkinson grabbed my upper arm harshly, "
After a quick glance down at the Daily Prophet, I looked back at him. "What is this for?"
Malfoy signed. I nodded my head.
he sat back in his seat crossing his arms,
I replied. I looked over to the small basket next to us and peeked inside. He couldn't cook much, but I could help but melt at his efforts. Two bacon sandwiches, pumpkin juice, and finger cakes; a perfect dinner.
I had never wanted to stay in bed more than right now. Sadly, life is not so kind.
It was then I realized my utter stupidity. I had a map!
Rolled my eyes, I signed in retort, "
All previous thoughts went out the window after my brief encounter with Mr.A and McGonagall. Once our classes were dropped off I booked it down the corridor. No, I have no clue where he was going, but it couldn't have been far right?
I was still in fairly good shape from the War, so I made it there in about a minute.
so they weren't rumors after all. They had to be true, though it's not like I could outright ask him. Maybe later he would tell me, and maybe he didn't quite know yet.
She pointed over to the corner of the room, to a bed with the curtains closed.
Draco mouthed?
He shook his head,
fast. I put my head down on the table and sighed. This was not the day I thought I would have. Classes started tomorrow, meaning Hermione wouldn't be as much help even if she said otherwise. Ron had proven to be pissed with me and unless I tell him the real reason Ginny and I broke up it would probably stay that way. There was no one else I could go to, so I guess it was up to me to find this cure.
I choked a little before realized I didn't actually have to say anything.
The storefront looked absolutely dazzling at night though. The gold hues that radiated off of its corner lights and the large sign that loomed above us made me feel dizzy. I was rushed with enthusiasm.
he motioned while poking his wand into my shoulder. Still feeling groggy I didn't argue.
Then I saw that one letter. A small
He smirked and then liked some frosting off his finger. He was going to be the death of me. I think Voldemort would be rather jealous of that.
I sat back on the floor facing his bed, resting against my own. He got up without a word, grabbed some clothes, and went into the bathroom. I decided to do the same and get dressed for the day. Once the door was open I couldn't help but laugh. If I had been sorted into Slytherin first year this wouldn't be a strange sight. Malfoy had a mirror levitating beside him, a toothbrush in one hand, and a hairbrush in the other. He got rid of the toothbrush soon after and was so fixated on his hair he didn't notice me slip in to brush my teeth. After he was done he looked over to me and jumped a few inches into the air. I rinsed my mouth and started up laughing again.
I tapped my chin,
Zacharias Smith and Terry Boot aren't a typical pair of friends, but I guess lots of people are trying to make new friendships after the war.
He loosed up and I was able to hold it, pulling his arm towards me. Carefully, I rolled up the cuff and saw the black ink fade into view. He looked away from it, so I used my other hand to move his chin towards me.
He really should be more careful about who he writes that kind of thing too. what if I left it on my dresser and Ron or, worse, Zacharias saw it?
So I leave you with this, if the world wants to ignore my favorite part of this story and turn it's back on the less gory aspects of life then so be it. I will tell my own story no matter what people think, because how can I lose something when I have nothing left to give?
"Are you saying that I've been dating a Homosexual for the past two years?" she retorted, getting louder.
That was a lie, of course, I wanted him around.
Ron interjected.
I wondered if Draco and I were friends now? I had fun last night just having somebody to talk to. He didn't look at me as the savior everyone else did. It was refreshing to have something not completely tarnished by the war. We could still be just as snarky with one another as always, even if it didn't have as much behind it. Would Draco want to be friends though?
Draco moved over to my side, the others caught in an awkward stance.
I was
"Actually, I talked to them on the train before school started." They both looked at me skeptically, "What? I walked into the wrong compartment and bam! They knew sign language, of course, I had some questions."
Almost immediately, Mr. A appeared in the doorway.
Draco stayed close to my side, I could tell he was terrified. It was way too dim to talk, so I had lots of time to think.
Ron stood and signed messily,
I thought more about Malfoy. What would happen if I had taken his hand? Would I be where I am now? Would I have been able to beat Voldemort? I knew I would have been in Slytherin if I had trusted him instead of Ron. It may have even taken less time if I had them on my side. Hermione might be smart, but she's kinda the only Gryffindor like that. They would understand the war more than we did. A lot of their parents were Death Eaters and would have had helpful information. Getting that information from the snakes is the hard part.
We both huffed and glared at each other. This was going great if I do say so myself.
Over time I would learn to deal with the status, the fame, whatever you'd like to call it. Throughout all of this, I would still disagree. For how can I be a savior if I couldn't even save myself.
The first sign was right before the teacher walked in and his leg started shaking rapidly. I thought it was just a small tic so I let it slide. Then he was twirling his quill and biting the inside of his cheek. I had no clue what was making him so nervous.
"Hey, Ron! You haven't seen Ginny anywhere. I need to tell her too."
damn it I thought I had him.
I walked her to the door, "Oh yeah, and who's that?"
He shook his head and pointed to his chest. He definitely wasn't breathing anymore.
I had just finished telling Ron and Hermione I was going out into the forest. As they walked away, Hermione crying into Ron's shoulder, I yelled for him.
I probably looked stupid. Why would we ask a sign interpreter for a book?
I stared at him, and he shifted slightly, looking awkward. I had honestly thought was a really good student, one of the best actually. He was no Hermione, but- "That's it!"
I yanked the book back and wrote quickly, The paper? No, of course not.
because I had made sure to teach all of my friends how to say that. I handed it over.
I looked out the window and fell asleep with the very low rumble to the train below me. Soon we would be back at Hogwarts.
she said the last sentence with extreme sincerity in her eyes, so I begrudgingly agreed.
He signed the word
"What did you need to ask?" We walked towards a small bookshop, I'll probably get Hermione's gift here.
I pecked his cheek quickly before detaching my hand. Walking away I realized that this was still going to be a rough meal, even without Draco insight.
I sighed, scrubbing my face as I sat down and leaned against the shelves.
My heart stopped pounding. The clock stopped ticking. It had all froze.
to Hermione and ran after him.
I had expected a touching moment. On of those sappy romantic things where she cried and kissed me goodbye. I was somewhat relieved when she didn't, but I would have taken that over what came.
He was close enough now I could make out the words forming on his lips. "So, about this mystery dinner..."
-------------
I noticed a few of the beds already had the curtains closed. It didn't slip my mind that Draco's was one of them. I set the potion down on the table between our beds, hoping that by morning it would be gone. I hoped he got the hint.
At the same time, Ron slowly fingerspells out
I rolled my eyes,
"Suspected what?"
He sent a small smile.
Snow crunched under my feet as I walked towards the Three Broomsticks. My breath curled around my face, and I let out a soft smile. It was only three days until Christmas, my personal favourite holiday.
“Well, Draco-” Draco’s head shot up as he looked at Harry when he heard his first name. “The thing is,” Harry paused to make sure he had Draco’s attention. “Saturday is Ron and Hermione’s engagement party and I as their best friend stupidly volunteered to throw the party in their honor. So this week I have been busy finalizing plans with the decorator, the caterer, and the DJ. I guess all those people just happen to be blokes and we just happen to meet at The Leaky.”
“Now, now why don’t you head outside and join everyone for your party.”
“Seems like it’s something you’re not looking forward to,” Sirius said as he motioned to the barkeep for another round of drinks.
“So, Draco, why exactly were you so interested in my love life?”
Draco raised one eyebrow.
“Right. I suppose I could owl him,” the blond suggested.
“Thank you, Molly.”
Harry stood up and walked to stand in front of Draco. Draco shifted nervously.
“Actually, I’d prefer if you did the opening tonight.”
“Well, I’m sorry we are taking you away from something so exciting,” Harry laughed as he wrapped his hand around Draco’s wrist and tugged him towards the fireplace. “Now let’s head to the Burrow. You can’t be late for your own birthday party.”
“Oh, don’t act like you haven’t enjoyed every other time we’ve gone over there. You can’t even pretend you don’t like them anymore.”
“Happy birthday, Draco!” Hermione shouted.
Taking another sip from his glass, Draco shook his head. “Nothing. Just thinking about something I have to do.”
Draco tossed the napkin onto Harry’s desk. “We are not friends, Potter! We merely work in the same department because fate is cruel.”
“You know what, I actually did. Even if I was surrounded by Gryffindors,” Draco smiled.
“Well, I figured since the great Draco Malfoy would be completing the case records I would be covered.”
The librarian hustled over, an expression of annoyed distaste on his face.
Harry fixed a smile on his face.
Blaise fairly swooned with mirth. “Really? You’re taking Potter to dinner with your parents? How’d you manage that? Do you have him under an Imperius? Or are you under an Imperius?”
“You don’t mind being chased all over the country and randomly attacked by bibliophiles?” I could not tear my gaze away from him. The intensity locked me in place. All I could see was Potter’s face – his eyes, his nose, the crinkle of his mouth….
“There’s an old family legend that it was used as a hideout during the Civil War,” Draco said. “And that there’s a secret trapdoor that led to a shelter under the building.”
My mouth dried. I had an urge to touch the Grimoire, to turn it over and go over it page by page.
He stirred now, as if his dreams were not entirely pleasant. But that was no surprise – this boy who made a mockery of all that the man held sacred. The man’s hand flexed, and he longed to hold a pillow over the Malfoy boy’s face until the body stilled.
Draco snorted. “I doubt it. It’ll be archaeological and historical coup, but it’s not like it’s new books of the Bible.”
“Can we tract them?” Harry asked.
I made a face at them. “Interesting choice of décor … I guess this is where Aunt Bella got her bad sense of style from.”
Malfoy … the name rang a bell, but it escaped Harry where he had heard of it. Harry managed a polite nod to the man, who regarded him coolly.
With a loud rustle, the book flipped open. Words began to appear slowly, as if an invisible hand had begun writing. It moved at a glacial pace. I restrained myself from shaking it. It would probably get offended and slam shut again.
Shacklebolt’s analysts had done a good job. They had digitized and organized Lucius’ papers in any way Draco could think of: alphabetically (beginning with the opening line on each), chronologically, and thematically (though Draco rather imagined they all shared the overall premise of Lucius’s disgruntlement at the world).
Potter was staring. He had the dazed look of someone used to a hard pallet waking up in a luxury suite.
I was also terrified at what would await me when I did open it. Not so much because it might threaten bodily injury, but because of its contents. All this power in my hands … I was curious to lay my eyes on it. It tempted me; I remembered that flash of covetousness when I saw the blue flames – I wanted that power for myself.
“Thank you, Draco, for that most helpful explanation,” Riddle said with heavy irony. “A simple answer would have sufficed.”
“Before that, we need to break the protection spell on it that prevents those who aren’t Slytherin descendants from interacting with it,” I said. “These types of blood concealments usually are very tricky. The key probably won’t work with a Pensieve until we remove it.”
“Draco ….” Harry’s voice was hesitant.
“Not if I have to.” Malfoy tapped a button. “I was looking through the facts of what happened again, and I managed to have Metis scour the recordings from the Underground.” He considered. “Well, what little we got from the surrounding cameras. They’re not as extensive as the ones you lot have, and a lot lower quality, but workable still.”
“It’s not so easy to break into my mind this time, Malfoy,” the librarian’s taunting voice sliced through. “I was unprepared last time. Try to invade my mind again and you’ll find yourself a dribbling vegetable.”
A sudden screech lanced through Harry’s head. He clapped his hands to his ears, trying to muffle out the sound.
I grinned. He had looked so good writhing under me as I bit that exact spot –
His face cut by the wind, Harry ducked and weaved, trying to get through the cars to his target.
There were two figures standing in front of us, talking. I gestured for Harry to be quiet, straining my ears to hear what they were saying.
I had never been more than a proficient duelist; the past ten years of peace and sedentary lifestyle dulled my instincts and reaction time even more. I knew I should Disapparate and seek help. Flight, not fight.
He writhed, his legs coming to wrap around Harry’s waist. He was hard now. They were both hard, the pace of their movements quickening in tandem.
I turned my watering eyes away. … Strange … I never encountered anything like this. Maybe I should go to the Curse-Breakers. After, they specialized in cracking enchantments like these. And what if there was an actual curse on this? I did not relish that idea….
“Slytherin? THE Slytherin?”
“You know of it?” Potter leaned in, looking at my father intently. “Have you seen it?”
Harry didn’t waste any time. He grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him out of the room. Draco felt a pang at seeing the Shield rolling to a halt near Dolohov’s prone body. The primal urge to survive overcame his longing to take the Shield with them. That, and a healthy tug from Harry.
My excitement overwhelmed me. I couldn’t sit here any longer. I rose from the table and packed my belongings. I had materials regarding Slytherin at home. Not to mention, this cave was stifling my intellectual potential, though I should thank the librarian for inadvertently pointing me on the right direction.
“I remember.” Harry hid a smile behind his water. “It would have been next to the definition of “prat” in the dictionary.”
“Oh.” Potter fell back, disappointed. “But I take it you know about the links the Circle has with it.”
“You have me,” Draco replied without thinking. He flushed. “I mean – I don’t know what I can do, but –”
It was not housekeeping.
“Of course I do, Potter,” my father said with a touch of his old asperity. “Which is why I assume that this isn’t a frivolous request. What’s all this about?”
Blaise laughed. “Same at you.”
The bed sagged as Potter sat. His eyes were lit with concern. “You don’t need to pretend to be okay, Draco. What you just experienced – it’s horrible and –”
