One saving grace was that Narcissa Malfoy had expatriated to France after the war, as she could no longer stand being in Malfoy Manor. Her former home held too many memories of happier times before the name Malfoy had become disgraced and despised and her husband had been carted off in magical restraints to Azkaban.
Before long Ron strolled into the parlor and greeted Harry with a warm smile. “Hello, mate! Seems like we haven’t seen each other in ages.  Hermione’s the lucky one, seeing you at the Ministry every day.”
“You could say that,” Draco replied.  “I went to Edinburgh on my lunch break.  Astoria and I decided to get a divorce.”
She continued, “One of the things Muggles are better at is healing psychological and emotional wounds.  Wizards and witches tend to be control freaks.  We think we can just wave a wand to solve every problem.  That doesn’t work well for emotional pain.”
Harry gave him a startled look.  “Well, only if you would rather be there than here,” Harry replied.  “Truth be told, I have been enjoying your company, Draco.  Since you’ve been here, I haven’t felt as lonely as I did before, rattling around in this huge house all by myself.  You’re welcome to stay as long as you’d like.”
In that moment Harry decided to be brave.  He thought about Keith’s slightly mocking question, “Scarier than facing Voldemort?”  Yes, Harry had faced many much scarier situations in his life.  So he said, “I talked to Keith about my feelings for you, Draco.”
“So you talked after he touched your hair,” Keith reflected, “but you didn’t feel resolved after that talk.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry,” Hermione huffed. “Of course we’ll do it! How could you possibly have any doubt?  Seriously, I can’t believe you sometimes.”
“Let me explain Ms. Lancaster’s presence,” Dr. Mathey began.  “When I provide services to wizards and witches, I find it helpful to enlist the assistance of a psychological technician who has magical abilities. Ms. Lancaster is a witch whom I have personally trained to assist with my magical clients.  Her role will be to ensure your safety in our sessions, especially when we are using magical interventions to effect healing.  Mr. Potter, do you have any questions about Ms. Lancaster’s role?”
Harry smiled and said, “Thanks, Ron. You’ve been my best mate forever.  You and my boyfriend have to get along.” Ron grunted his reply.
Ron laughed heartily. “Yeah, can you imagine Hermione back in the day being as powerful as she is now? It was bad enough that she ran circles around us on our OWLs.”
“Good, it's a deal,” Harry said with a smile.  He picked up his wand then and cast a tergeo spell to clean up the sofa.
Of course Harry never expected or wanted Malfoy to thank him for mounting a defense at his trial.  That was not in the realm of possibility and would have made Harry extremely uncomfortable.  Even though there were so many things about Malfoy that Harry couldn’t abide, the Gryffindor couldn’t help but feel some compassion for the git.  A startling realization that had come to Harry a few years ago was that, if he had to choose between being Lucius Malfoy’s son and living with the Dursleys, he would choose the latter in a heartbeat. That awareness led him to reflect on what Draco’s life had been like.  Maybe as bad as or possibly even worse than his own had been?
Hermione smiled kindly at Draco and said, “Of course, Draco.  I forgave you a long time ago.  And I know you’re not the same person you were back at Hogwarts because if you were, Harry wouldn’t have fallen in love with you.  He said as much last time he was here.”  She laughed then, and that drew a smile from Draco.
The last task the wizards had to accomplish that day was to deal with the cellar, where prisoners of the Dark Lord had been held during the Second Wizarding War.  This room held painful memories for both Harry and Draco, but they were determined to illuminate the dark space and dispel all distressing memories. The first thing Harry did upon entering the cellar was to cast a Fenestrato spell, creating windows at the tops of all four cellar walls.  As the light streamed in, the atmosphere in the room was instantly transformed, immediately feeling less ominous and depressing.  Harry and Draco continued to cast spells and charms, brightening up the cellar with color, life, and light.   When they had finished, they looked at each other and smiled.
Before Harry left the therapy office, Hilda cast a Stamina charm and brought him a cup of calming draught.  Harry thanked her for casting the charm and accepted the draught with gratitude.
“Of course not,” she said with a sly grin. “Besides Potter would probably faint if you did thank him.”
“They’re all great, thanks for asking,” Harry replied.  “Of course the divorce was hard on James.  Albus and Lily are too young to really understand that Ginny and I are divorced.  I already felt bad about being a lousy husband, and then knowing how much our breakup hurt James, well, I never felt such intense guilt before.”
As soon as Harry apparated in the drawing room of Malfoy Manor, he looked around to see who else was in attendance and immediately felt ill at ease.  He expected that he was persona non grata to many of the pureblood wizards who had allied themselves with the Dark Lord during the Second Wizarding War.  Draco, however, came to his rescue right away, extending his hand and saying, “Harry, thank you so much for coming.  Please come say hello to my mother.”
Hilda then said, “It was a real pleasure meeting you, Harry, and I look forward to working with you.  We wizards and witches need to work on our ability to heal mental and emotional wounds.  That’s why I’m so grateful for the opportunity to work with and learn from Keith.  I suspect today may have been a bit challenging for you, remembering and recounting painful episodes in your life.  With your permission I’d like to cast a Stamina charm to help restore your emotional energy.  Would that be OK?”
Harry then began siphoning memories into the pensieve.  When he was finished, the wizards and witch began viewing Harry’s memory of the last moments of the Triwizard Tournament during Draco’s and Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts.  They watched Harry searching the maze for the Triwizard Cup and saw him save Cedric from Viktor Krum’s Cruciatus curse.  They watched how Harry and Cedric found the cup after teaming up to stun the giant spider that had attacked Cedric.
By this time Harry’s spirit had lightened sufficiently to tease Draco.  He said, “Does that mean you won’t sneer at me anymore and say, ‘Scared, Potter?’”
During the last two weeks of July, Harry and Draco were busy getting ready for the arrival of Scorpius.  At breakfast one morning Harry raised with Draco the possibility of temporarily relocating to Malfoy Manor.
“I do,” Harry replied. “And if you absolutely hate it at my place we can always come up with an alternate plan.”
Harry released a torrent of words.  “Why did you have to be so mean to me? I know my dad and his friends bullied you, but I’m not my dad.  I was just a kid trying to survive. You loved my mom.  Couldn’t you be kind to her son?  My life would have been so much easier if you had treated me with kindness instead of cruelty. Do you know how scared I was of you for so long?  How awful I would feel after you sneered at me, mocked me, criticized me, and accused me of all kinds of misdeeds?”
After running his fingers through Harry's hair, Draco makes a number of choices. Some of the actions he takes are conscious, others are unconscious.
Astoria gave each attendee a white lily.  As Draco and Narcissa led the procession past the tomb, each guest placed a lily in front of Lucius’s final resting place.
“Really,” Ron said, shaking his head. “Will wonders never cease. You and Malfoy, friends.”  He continued to shake his head.
“Of course, Harry,” Keith said, “this is your time.  We can talk about whatever you want.  So what’s on your mind?”
During one session Harry focused on distressing interactions he had with Severus Snape while at Hogwarts.  Even though Harry had come to admire the Half-Blood Prince, even choosing “Severus” as his younger son’s middle name, he was haunted by his former Potions professor’s looks of contempt and disdain, not to mention the cold and angry insults and accusations he had frequently hurled at Harry.
Meanwhile, Harry lay awake recalling the feeling of Draco’s hand in his hair. He had been tempted to throw himself at Draco and pull him into a passionate kiss, but of course he couldn’t do that.  Harry knew he had to proceed very cautiously.  The risk of getting hurt was huge. Maybe Draco was just feeling overly emotional after the intense therapy session today.  Maybe viewing Harry’s memory had elicited a strong desire in Draco to comfort and protect Harry, and that’s why he was running his fingers through Harry’s hair.  That was something a parent did to soothe a child, right? It couldn’t have come from any romantic or sexual impulses, could it?  It didn’t matter anyway because Draco was married, and no way would Harry get involved with a married wizard.  He ruminated about this for hours before finally falling into a restless sleep.
Harry talks to Hermione, Ron and Draco about his pensieve work in therapy and asks if they are willing to view some of his memories.
Hilda then proceeded to describe to Keith what she had witnessed.  Keith then guided Harry to do some healing work, which included naming his emotions and giving full expression to them.  Afterwards they discussed several additional options.  Keith suggested sharing some of his painful memories with one or two trusted friends so that Harry could receive additional support and affirmation.
“Let me make a few inquiries,” Hermione replied. “It’s important that you connect with a psychologist who’s an expert in treating trauma.  Also someone who won’t be star-struck by you, like ‘OMG, my client is the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived!’”
Draco then thought about how it had felt to hold Harry close, pressing their bodies together.  He imagined them in a tight embrace, kissing.  He started to get hard.  He pictured Harry stripped down to his boxers and then imagined himself touching Harry’s half-naked body.  His pulse started racing and his breath quickened.  At that point Draco began to touch himself as he let his imagination run wild, producing image after image of himself pleasuring every inch of Harry’s body with his mouth and hands. Draco reached his climax spurting jizz all over his naked chest.  Casting a tergeo spell to clean himself up, he thought, “I am so screwed.”
Since the conversation in which Harry had come out to Draco, the wizards had not talked again about Harry’s sexual orientation.  Draco did wonder, however, about Harry’s love life.  He had talked about a one-year relationship with a gay wizard named Eoin.  Did Harry have other gay lovers? Did he continue to visit the Walloping Wand, looking for sexual partners? And what about his experience with women? Had he been intimate with any women other than Ginevra Weasley?
Harry was deeply touched by Hilda’s reaction.  Few people knew of the pain Harry had suffered at the hands of the amoral former Hogwarts High Inquisitor.  Harry had testified at Umbridge’s trial, describing in detail the pain she had inflicted on him, and he had received many expressions of sympathy.  But this was the first time, seeing and hearing Hilda’s reaction, that Harry felt another person really understood how horrific those sessions with Umbridge had been.
“Yeah, it would still be hard, but not nearly as hard as admitting that I’m in love with him,” Harry replied.
“You’re welcome, Harry,” Draco replied. “I wanted to ease your pain and wasn’t sure what to do,” he admitted.
“It was a good start,” Draco admitted.  “I feel more ready now to meet the rest of your adopted family.”
Those who were invited to attend Lucius’s funeral were, for the most part, pureblood wizards and witches who shared his political views.  Narcissa had returned for the funeral but did not plan to stay long.  Astoria had come from Scotland with Scorpius and planned to return to Edinburgh right after the funeral.  Several of Draco’s friends from Hogwarts were there, including Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, and Pike, his former Quidditch teammate.
After the last person had spoken, the time had come for Lucius’s interment. Several wizards and witches raised their wands to cast a complex combination of spells.  A flash of blinding light filled the drawing room, accompanied by a loud crack.  The flash of light instantaneously vanished and Lucius’s coffin had disappeared.
He said, “Ginny and I decided that James, Albus and Lily were better off staying with their mum in Whimple, rather than shuttling them back and forth between Whimple and London.  That way they get to enjoy the wide open spaces of the countryside, which they are now accustomed to, as well as the proximity to their grandparents whom they love.”
Sensing Harry’s confusion, Hermione clarified, “I’m speaking as a friend, not as a boss now.  Your work is impeccable, always has been.  You’re a brilliant Auror and your team respects you.”
“Together? What do you mean ‘together’?  I know you’re still living together.”  Hermione asked with a puzzled look.
As word got around the British community of wizards and witches that Harry and Draco were now a gay couple, the wizards attracted even more attention than before.  The magical tabloids ran sensational stories about the relationship between the Boy Who Lived and the former Death Eater, and Harry and Draco had to lay low for a while to avoid the publicity.  But they had each other for support, as well as a sense of humor about it all, which helped them to survive whatever life threw their way.
“Oh, c’mon Hermione,” Harry said with a chuckle.  “I wouldn’t have survived without you and Ron watching my back. Think of all the times we worked together to deal with completely impossible situations.  The three of us were a team, and we fought the good fight.  Besides, if you had been any more powerful back then, you’d have been intolerable.”
Peering into the pensieve, Harry and Hilda watched Harry’s memory of Vernon and Petunia berating him.  Breathing heavily, Harry started describing the scene, “I’m five years old. They’re screaming at me. They’re screaming and screaming.  That I’m useless and good for nothing.  That I don’t deserve all the kindness they’ve shown me.  That my parents were horrible people who deserved to die.  That it was a shame I didn’t die with them.”
“So, we’ll have to figure out what to do next,” Draco said softly. “I think we can come up with an arrangement that’s acceptable to both of us regarding division of property and custody of Scorpius.”
Malfoy was able to disapparate from Malfoy Manor without attracting any attention. He made his way from the lobby of the Ministry to Potter’s office.  He was surprised to find not only Potter, but also Granger, waiting for him.
Although Draco was loath to admit it, he was grateful for Harry’s and Hermione’s help.  The plan they devised enabled him not only to get away from the media circus but also to escape, if only temporarily, the profusion of memories at the manor that triggered waves of grief about his father’s death.  Draco could not bring himself to acknowledge it, but he was also touched by Harry’s and Hermione’s concern about his property.  He had not expected them to dispatch a team of aurors to ensure that no harm would come to the manor.
Keith interjected then.  He said, “Harry, can you tell us what it was like to have Hermione and Ron view your memory and share their responses with you?”
At that moment Hermione and Ron entered the parlor.  Hermione rushed over and gave both wizards a warm welcome.  She hugged one, then the other, giving each a gentle kiss on the cheek.  “So glad this worked out for you two.”
“No worries,” Ms. Gunn replied.  “Dr. Mathey will review the forms and, if he needs additional information, he’ll be sure to ask you.”  Harry nodded and said, “Thank you.”
Draco’s mouth opened in surprise. “Oh!” was all he could manage, followed by several beats of deafening silence.  Eventually he said, “But you fathered three children, so you can’t be all that gay.”
“Well, now I’m intrigued,” Ron said with a smile.  “So, Hermione said that you invited Malfoy to stay with you after his dad’s suicide.  That was kind of you.  Don’t think I would have been so kind to the git after all the things he did to you.”
“Is there anything you could tell Draco about your feelings that would feel less risky than saying ‘I’m in love with you’?” Keith asked.
“Let me think about that, OK?” Astoria replied. “I won’t take long, just a day or so and I’ll get back to you.  Please feel free to apparate here at any time.  I will let Isabella and the house-elves know that you will be coming more frequently in the next few weeks. We have a lot to figure out.”
This was a topic about which Draco could speak enthusiastically and at length.  After explaining his custody arrangement with Astoria, he said that Scorpius would come to live with the wizard couple soon and the three of them would live at Malfoy Manor for three months.  He described the changes that he and Harry had made to the manor.  He produced a wizard photo of Scorpius in which the six-year-old was sharing his knowledge of magical creatures.
“It sounds like what happened to me and Ginny,” Harry said. “We stopped talking and drifted apart. It hurt.  I’m sorry it happened to you and Astoria.  On the outside you looked like you were made for each other.”
“That’s a good insight, Harry,” Keith said.  “Why don’t we embark on some grief work then? You get to choose the focus and the pace of the work.  Do you have an idea of where and how you’d like to start?”
Draco was astonished.  The Chosen One had just disclosed to him that he’s gay.  Draco was shocked not only by Harry’s sexual orientation but also by Harry’s willingness to come out to his former enemy, the old rival who had used every possible device to make Harry’s life miserable.  Harry’s honest declaration indicated either that he trusted Draco or that he felt invulnerable to the homophobia that was rampant in the magical community.  Maybe both. Whatever the case might be Draco was impressed.
Harry decided to talk to Draco the following day after work.  After dinner the two wizards retired to the drawing room and settled comfortably in overstuffed chairs in front of the fireplace. Harry decided to take the plunge. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you, Draco,” he said. Draco looked up inquiringly at Harry.  This wasn’t how Harry usually started their conversations.
“I have been seeing a Muggle psychologist for almost two months now,” Harry said. Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise.  He inclined his head, waiting for Harry to continue.
Harry nodded.  “Yes, we’re working with a pensieve.  I siphon memories and then we work through them.  It’s hard to describe how the process works, but the healing seems to be the result of facing the pain directly in the presence of caring and supportive people, and giving honest expression to the thoughts and feelings that come up.”
“So think more about those two in-between options, Harry,” Keith advised. “You always get to decide what to do. And only you can know whether it’s the right decision.”
Draco felt a wave of anxiety rising in him.  He took a moment before asking, “How do you think they’ll take the news that you’re in a relationship with a Malfoy?”
Harry and Draco visit Malfoy Manor to prepare for the arrival of Scorpius, and visit with Hermione and Ron at Grangeley.
Harry was surprised, to say the least. Having grown up in an abusive home with relatives who absolutely hated magic and hated him because he was a wizard, he had a hard time imagining a world in which Muggles accepted magic.  But he knew Hermione was brilliant and was playing the long game. She was a visionary and always had her eyes on the prize—a peaceful world in which everyone lived in harmony and was treated with respect.  Thinking about his friend’s vision, Harry felt love and admiration for her. Hermione was one of a kind.
That evening Kreacher and Roody served the wizards a delicious supper of roast chicken, boiled potatoes, peas and cauliflower.  After eating their fill Harry and Draco retired to the drawing room, as was their custom.  Acknowledging that viewing Harry’s memory earlier that day had been emotionally draining, Harry and Draco fortified themselves with glasses of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky.  They also agreed that listening to music would be soothing and decided to listen to a Celestina Warbeck concert on the Wizarding Wireless Network.
During mid to late summer the wizards also visited the Burrows.  Hermione and Ron had paved the way for a cordial reception at the Weasley homestead.  Molly and Arthur extended a warm welcome to Harry, Draco, and Scorpius.  Draco was surprised and grateful that the Weasleys accepted him and his son with open arms.  He had not expected them to be so hospitable and kind to someone named Malfoy.  Molly prepared a large feast for them, and Arthur expressed an avid interest in Draco’s work in the Department of Magical Artefacts at the Ministry.
Ron’s eyes widened in surprise. “So, what about his company do you enjoy?” he asked, clearly having a hard time believing there would be anything enjoyable about Malfoy’s company.
After the ceremony, Draco approached Harry and said, “Thank you for being here today. Your presence has been comforting.  Will you stay and visit with Scorpius and me for a while? It would mean a lot to me.”
Harry gave this question some thought before responding.  “I guess I could tell him that I really enjoy his company, and that I’d like him to stay at my place indefinitely,” Harry said.
“Yes,” Harry replied between mouthfuls of delicious pub style chicken curry.  “I read the materials and found the information on Experiential Trauma Therapy especially interesting.  Of all the approaches, that sounded the most promising to me.  But I was wondering how the procedures might be adjusted for a client who’s a wizard.”
“Of course,” Astoria said, smiling and extending her hand. “How could I ever forget the famous Harry Potter?”
Draco has moved into Harry's home at 12 Grimmauld Place.  The two men share personal information about their marriages.
At his next therapy session Harry asked Keith if he could take a break from the trauma work and talk about something else that had been on his mind.
Keith then ensured that Harry, Draco and Hilda felt comfortable ending the session.  Hilda brought in cups of calming draught for everyone, including Keith, after which she cast a Stamina charm.  After finishing their cups of the draught, Harry and Draco disapparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place.
Harry closed his eyes and thought for a bit.  He then looked at Keith and said, “I suppose I could say that I have feelings for him and understand that he doesn’t reciprocate those feelings, which is fine, and I will of course respect his boundaries and want him to stay at my place.”
Harry arrived for his second therapy appointment with Dr. Mathey and Ms. Lancaster.  Since his first session he had thought about what “little t traumas” he wanted to start working on.  Even though it might not be considered a minor trauma in another person’s life, Harry thought he would start with his childhood abuse at the home of the Dursleys.  Given the many and intense traumatic experiences in Harry’s life, what he had suffered living with the Dursleys, while extremely unpleasant, was at least not life-threatening.  Moreover, it had all happened so long ago.  These days Harry tended to think of his painful childhood experiences as bad dreams that disappeared upon awakening.
Harry grinned and said, “Yeah, at the Dursleys—that’s my aunt and uncle’s surname—I never knew if and when I’d get to eat again, so I got into the habit of keeping a small stash of food, whenever I could get my hands on it.”
“How shall we tell Scorpius?” Draco asked. “I’m not ready to tell him this moment, but we do need to explain things to him soon.  Do you want us to tell him together or separately?”
Harry frowned in concentration, siphoning childhood memories into the bowl, which started to fill with a gaseous liquid.  After a few minutes, Keith said, “I believe that is sufficient for now, Harry.  Thank you.”
Harry had hired a team of wizards and witches, skilled in the magical restoration of fine art, to add the names of younger Black family descendants to the tapestry, including Draco, Scorpius, and Teddy.  The restoration team was also tasked with adding back to the tapestry the names of disowned family members, including Sirius Black and Andromeda Tonks; an untrained eye could not tell that those names had ever been removed.
The wizards’ love for each other grew stronger and deeper with each passing day.  Every night after tucking Scorpius in for the night and reading the little wizard a bedtime story, Harry and Draco would snuggle together in the drawing room, reflecting on how lucky they were to have fallen in love with each other.  And every night before going to sleep, Harry would kiss Draco and say, "I love you, Malfoy." And Draco would reply, "I love you back, Potter."
“It’s all settled,” Draco replied.  He proceeded to give Harry the details about the arrangements to which he and Astoria had agreed.  He also told Harry about his time with Scorpius that afternoon.  Harry smiled when he heard about Scorpius’s fascination with magical beasts.  “He’ll go far, that boy will,” Harry said.
“We haven’t been happy for a long time, Astoria,” Draco said with a sigh. “I suppose that I came to the sudden realization that I don’t see us ever getting back together again, and we’ve been dragging it on, postponing the inevitable.  It became clear to me that it’s never going to work.  I mean, you’ve been living here in Edinburgh for more than four months now, and in all that time we have hardly spoken to each other except to exchange a few pleasantries when I drop in to see Scorpius.  And to be brutally honest, I haven’t missed you, so that tells me something.”
When lunchtime came, Draco apparated right at the front door of the Edinburgh house belonging to Astoria’s Aunt Isabella.   It was a stunning five-bedroom stone house in the Blacket Conservation Area of Edinburgh, with a slated roof and five large case windows facing the street.  Draco realized that he was arriving unannounced.  He knocked loudly on the door.  He was greeted by Timsy, one of Isabella’s house-elves.
Within a couple of days Harry had scheduled a visit to Grangeley.  After suppertime on a beautiful evening in mid July he apparated in the parlor of Ron’s and Hermione’s lovely home.  The couple were seated comfortably on the sofa, awaiting his arrival.  After hugs were exchange, Harry sat down in a plush chair facing his best friends.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” Pansy ventured, “having been voted the most skeptical Slytherin in our class, but don’t you think you’re being a bit too cynical?  Mightn’t Potter have defended you because he believed it was the right thing to do and not because he’d benefit from it?  After all, he did catch a lot of heat afterwards.  Accusations of being a traitor to the cause, even getting death threats from some nut cases, if you can believe the Daily Prophet.”
“Uncle Harry!” the children exclaimed, running up to Harry the moment he apparated.  He grabbed them both in a group hug, kissing each child on the side of the head.  “My favorite godchildren,” Harry said with a big smile. “How I’ve missed you!”  He reached into his pocket and pulled out two boxes of chocolate frogs, giving one to each child.  Their eyes widened with delight.
Harry nodded and continued.  “Recently I revisited a particularly difficult memory.  When Hilda viewed the memory in the pensieve, it affected her deeply.  Her reaction and subsequent words to me were healing.  Keith then suggested it might benefit my healing process for some close friends to view some of my painful memories and share their reactions with me.  I was reluctant to ask you because it’s not exactly a pleasant business.  I didn’t want to subject you to any more distress than I already have through the years.  And I certainly don’t want you to feel obligated.  It’s perfectly fine if you’d rather not.”
“Greetings, Master Draco,” Timsy said. “Please do come in.  Timsy will inform Astoria and Scorpius that you have arrived.”
Harry said, “I think I have been avoiding the pain for too long.  One sign is that recently I have had recurring dreams about people who have died.  I wake up feeling intensely sad, then try to shake it off as quickly as I can and get on with my day.  I think my dreams are trying to tell me that I need to allow myself to grieve more.”
Ensconced in his bedroom Draco continued to think about what had just happened.  He stripped off all his clothes and lay on his bed, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep for a while.  He found himself luxuriating in the sensual feeling of being naked on top of his silver satin sheets.  He wondered what it would be like to take things further with Harry.  He imagined them kissing.  The image didn’t bother him.  Instead it intrigued him. What would it be like to kiss Harry?
There were a million questions Draco wanted to ask Harry.  “So are you still on good terms with the Weasleys?  It looks like you and Granger are still good friends.”
Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how Draco wept while viewing his memory of Cedric Diggory’s murder.  And how Draco had hugged him, saying he loved and admired him.  Harry recalled how he felt with the Slytherin’s arms around him—comforted and safe.  And how his heart leapt when Draco said he loved him.  Also echoing in Harry’s mind were Draco’s words, “I’m here for you now.”
“I think it’s going to be hard sharing custody with Astoria,” Draco said with a sigh.  “I miss Scorpius so much. I should have seen him today, but I was too broken up after ending things with Astoria.  I have to go back and see him tomorrow or the next day.”
Harry took her hand and returned her smile.  “Astoria, lovely to see you again,” he said.  He was struck by her arresting beauty—her luscious dark hair, porcelain skin, and lovely, serene expression.  Harry was then distracted by a tug on his pant leg.  Looking down he saw Scorpius and crouched down so that they were face to face.  “Hello, little wizard,” Harry said, “what’s your name?”
Right at half two, a nicely dressed gentleman wearing a navy blue blazer over tan slacks entered the waiting room.  He appeared to be in his mid 40s.  He was average height, about 175 centimeters tall, good looking, with light brown hair and blue eyes. He approached Harry and said, “Mr. Potter?”
“Yes,” Hilda replied, “I just need a moment.”  She closed her eyes and took a minute or two to compose herself.  She then said, “I was initially tempted to cast a soothing charm and to rush out and bring us all cups of calming draught.  But then I realized that it would be better not to blunt our responses to Harry’s memory before sharing those responses.”
Harry said, “Yes, do let’s try to address each other by our first names.  If we use surnames, it’ll feel like we never left Hogwarts.”  He smiled to himself, thinking about the other less complimentary names he and Draco had for each other.
Keith asked gently, “Can you be upfront with Draco about your hunch that he can help with this particular memory, as well as your concern that it might be triggering for him?”
During his next session, Harry did more pensieve work, this time focused on the torture he experienced at the hands of Dolores Umbridge.  That sociopathic witch was now serving a life sentence in Azkaban for her crimes during the Second Wizarding War.  After Harry had siphoned memories of his torture sessions with Umbridge, he and Hilda viewed the memories.  Hilda gasped in horror as she watched Umbridge compel Harry to write “I must not tell lies” with the Black Quill.  She cringed and teared up when she saw the blood rising to the surface of Harry’s hand as he wrote each letter in that disgusting sentence.
Hermione looked at the photograph fondly and exclaimed, “What an adorable little wizard.  And obviously very smart.”  Draco beamed with pride.
They walked in companionable silence to the Leaky Cauldron and found a secluded table in a quiet corner.  The after-work crowd had not yet descended on the tavern.  Harry ordered a pint, and Draco ordered a double-shot of Firewhisky.
Harry immediately dispatched his owl Iphigenia to Draco with a letter expressing his condolences.  He worried that Draco might not believe, let alone appreciate, an expression of sympathy from him, but that couldn’t deter him.  It was the right thing to do.  And so Harry wrote from the heart, telling Draco how sorry he was for his loss.
After visiting with Ron and Hermione for a couple of hours, Harry hugged his friends goodbye and disapparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place.
“Well, I had an idea.  My friend Draco has expressed willingness to view some of my memories, like Ron and Hermione did last time.  I was thinking about asking Draco to view my memory of witnessing the death of a person I cared about.  I can’t explain it, but I have this strong feeling that Draco is the one person who can help me deal with that memory.  I don’t know exactly why.  A big reservation I have, however, is that Draco’s father died not long ago, and I don’t want my memory to trigger his own grief about his father’s death.”
What Draco couldn’t abide about Harry since day one was his self-righteous attitude.  Refusing to shake Draco’s hand just because he had made a disparaging remark about the Weasels.  The Malfoys were among the wealthiest and most illustrious pureblood wizarding families and were accustomed to being admired and envied.  Of course they looked down on lower-class families like the Weasels. Of course they were better than half-bloods and mudbloods. Just because Potter was The Boy Who Lived didn’t give him the right to reject Draco Malfoy’s offer of friendship.  That scarhead should have felt honored when Draco extended his hand to him, especially since Potter wasn’t pureblood himself.  Instead, he showed Draco up in front of everybody. That was unforgiveable.
Harry felt exposed, as if Keith had recognized a fundamental aspect of Harry’s character and shone a bright light on it.  Although he had been a team player in many situations, he often played a central role and felt that he had sole responsibility for the team’s success.  Prime examples included his position as Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and his leadership role in Dumbledore’s army.
“Shut the fuck up!” Harry yelled. “You are the useless, good for nothing ones.  You are the ones who deserve to die.  You are both horrible and cruel.  My mum and dad were brilliant, loving people.  Voldemort should have killed you, not them!”  Harry then broke down in tears, shaking all over.
“I do want to get to know the Weasleys, I really do, but I’m pretty nervous about it,” Draco admitted.  “I haven’t exactly been the nicest to them over the years.”
“Draco, I can’t thank you enough for what you did today,” Harry said after they had apparated back at 12 Grimmauld Place.  “You don’t know how much you helped, how much comfort you gave me.”
After Lucius Malfoy's suicide, a horde of reporters descends on Malfoy Manor. Harry and Hermione help Draco develop an action plan.
“Very good, Master Draco,” Timsy said, “Timsy will do as you asked.  Please follow me and make yourself comfortable in the parlor.”  Draco followed the house-elf and seated himself in a comfortable chair.
Draco was silent for several moments, considering the suggestion.  He then said, “I like the idea, Harry, but are you sure? Do you really want to live in Wiltshire?  I know you love London.”
Harry was incandescently happy, scarcely believing that the wizard he had fantasized about for so long was actually his lover now.  Hardly able to contain his excitement, Harry would walk around beaming and humming happy tunes to himself.  Several of his Ministry colleagues observed that the Head Auror appeared especially energetic and upbeat lately.  Hermione even commented that Harry looked like he had been hit with a cheering charm.
“No worries, Draco,” Harry said with a laugh.  “I’m not picking up any foul odor from you.  In fact, I quite like the smell of your cologne.”  Draco blushed.
“So what’s up, Harry?” Ron asked.  “You told ‘Mione you had something important to talk to us about.”
“First, I’d like to assure you that we won’t be doing anything dangerous in our sessions,” she began.  “I know too that you are a powerful wizard and unlikely to require any protection from me.  That said, in trauma treatment we use magical tools like the pensieve, Boggarts, and even the Mirror of Erised.  If the magical client experiences difficulty when we use those tools, it helps to have another witch or wizard standing by to lend a hand.  My role is that of a monitor, to ensure that everything is progressing as it should and that you do not experience excessive distress.  If anything magical starts to go even slightly awry, I use my magic to set things right.  Dr. Mathey, in spite of his many gifts, cannot cast the spells, charms, and incantations to prevent magic from causing harm.  That's where I come in."
Harry and Draco chose the bedroom they would share, as well as the bedroom that would be Scorpius’s.  They cast a few charms, including Herbivicus and Colovaria, to enliven and brighten up the rooms.  Although all evidence of dark magic had been removed from Malfoy Manor by the Ministry after the Second Wizarding War, there were several objects remaining in the mansion that conjured painful memories for Draco.  With Harry’s help, Draco decided which objects to vanish with an Evanesco spell and which objects to transport to be stored in an unused room in 12 Grimmauld Place.
Harry smiled happily. “I’m glad you think so, and I hope in time you will consider them your friends too.”
“Yes, Ron,” Harry said indulgently. “That’s his name, and he calls me Harry, most of the time at least.”
Harry reflects on his relationship with Draco.  He also considers Dr. Mathey's suggestion to share some of his painful memories with supportive friends.
“I think I’d like to answer the question, if I may,” Ms. Lancaster said, to which Dr. Mathey nodded in assent.
He siphoned another memory into the pensieve, a memory of his aunt denying him food, banishing him to the cupboard under the stairs when he was ravenously hungry.
Grinning at Harry, Draco said, “Harry, you’re so very lucky to have such good-looking godchildren.  Shall we give them their present now?”
“Of course I’ll view the memory with you, Harry,” Draco said. “And no worries about my grief about my dad.  I think I’m coping with that pretty well.”
“Well, maybe,” Ron said, “but I don’t think I’d be so quick to forgive.  Anyway, I assume he’s back at the manor now.”
“Ah, yes, Mr. Potter,” Ms. Gunn said with a smile.  “I see you have an appointment at half two.  Thanks for arriving a few minutes early.  There are a few forms I need you to fill out.”  She handed Harry a pen and a clipboard attached to which were several sheets of paper.  Harry wondered whether Ms. Gunn was aware of magic at all and, if so, whether she knew that Dr. Mathey provided therapy to wizards and witches.
“Pleased to meet you,” Harry said, following Dr. Mathey down a short corridor and into a spacious office.  When Harry and Dr. Mathey entered the room, a middle-aged woman wearing a smart business suit rose from the chair she had been sitting in.  She smiled warmly at Harry.
The shock on Ron’s face was plain as print. “Really?” he exclaimed. “You’re enjoying Malfoy’s company?!”
Keith and Hilda smiled back at Harry.  “Excellent work today, Harry,” Keith said.  “You may find yourself experiencing strong emotions after today’s session.  Some emotions may be very positive, for example, feeling empowered and gratified, but other emotions may be more difficult, such as strong feelings of grief or anger.  I encourage you to engage in some good self-care between now and our next session.  Also to connect with friends and family members whom you trust, people who can provide emotional support and affirmation.  You did a lot of hard work today in therapy, so take good care of yourself, OK?”
“I never considered that before,” Harry admitted.  “It makes sense, but I hate grieving--it hurts too goddamn much.”
Draco, who had been looking with intense fondness at the exchange between Harry and Scorpius, said, “There will be time later, Scorpius, for you to ask Mr. Potter additional questions, but now we have some business to attend to.”
Following the eulogy, several people stood and shared sentiments in Lucius’s honor.  Draco spoke from the heart about how he loved his father, in spite of Lucius’s faults, and about the important life lessons Lucius had taught him.  Harry was surprised that Draco had referred to Lucius’s faults, and he teared up hearing Draco’s heartfelt testimony.
Since Draco’s trial it seemed as though the two men had tacitly agreed to a ceasefire.  Harry observed that Draco no longer sneered or rolled his eyes at him but would simply give him a curt nod when they passed each other at work or in public.  Harry would nod back.  But on rare occasions, especially when Draco was feeling particularly happy about something, he would verbally greet Harry, saying “Potter” and bowing his head slightly.  At those times Harry would respond, “Hello, Malfoy.”  Harry noticed that he preferred the verbal greetings to the silent head nods.
After moving into Malfoy Manor at the beginning of August, Harry, Draco, and Scorpius visited Devon a few times so that Draco and Scorpius could meet Harry’s children.  In a private conversation Harry had explained to Ginny that he and Draco were now a couple.  Her initial reaction was similar to her brother’s—shock and disbelief—but she eventually came around and treated Draco with civility.  Harry hoped that eventually she would act more warmly towards his lover.
Draco and Astoria decided to talk to Scorpius together about the new arrangement.  A precocious six-year-old little wizard, he listened intently to his parents’ words.  Draco and Astoria explained that they had done a lot of thinking and talking and decided that Astoria would continue living in Edinburgh with Aunt Isabella, and Draco would continue living in London with Harry Potter.  They assured Scorpius that they both loved him very much and both parents wanted to be with him, so they decided to share him.  So Scorpius would continue to live with his mother for now, and later in the summer he would go live with his father in London.  Draco and Astoria further explained that each parent would visit regularly when Scorpius was with the other parent.  If Scorpius was confused or distressed by the news, he did not show it.  Perhaps he had become accustomed to living in Edinburgh with Astoria, and having Draco visit from time to time, so it didn’t seem like much of a change.
“Very much,” Harry said.  “I’ve been plagued by all kinds of demons since childhood, and then I went through so many horrible things before and during the Second Wizarding War.  My sessions with Keith and Hilda are helping me sort out a lot of my past.”
“I know, Ron,” Harry said in a conciliatory tone. “But for my sake please give Draco a chance.  He’s not the same person he was at Hogwarts.  If he were, I wouldn’t have fallen in love with him.  And he’s sorry for things he did and said in the past.  I know he is.  I need my friends and family to accept him and to support our relationship.  So please try for my sake?”
Draco could only surmise that many witches and not a few gay wizards would find The Chosen One exceedingly appealing.  He imagined that quite a few people had thrown themselves at Harry over the years.  And Draco had to admit that Harry had matured into a very handsome wizard.  Despite his small stature, he had a commanding presence; people took notice when he entered a room, and not just because he was the famous Harry Potter.  Harry had an attractive build—he was slender and fit.  In the privacy of their shared home Draco had seen Harry with only his boxers on and had noted his muscular and wiry build.  Draco also thought that Harry had a handsome face—his emerald eyes were penetratingly beautiful, and his entire face lit up when he smiled.
“Well, I needed to do it,” Draco said. “I have owed them an apology for years. It was weighing on me—a debt that had to be paid.  And they were so gracious.  Your friends are awesome, Harry.”
Harry clutched onto Draco and cried into his shoulder. Draco kept whispering in Harry’s ear.  “I could see how much you loved and admired Cedric, Harry, and even though I viewed your memory I can’t imagine the kind of pain you experienced.  I’m awestruck, Harry, by how brave you were, how much strength and integrity you had, and you were just a kid.  I wish I had known back then how incredible you were.  The love and admiration you had for Cedric—well that’s how I feel towards you now.”
Harry and Hermione enjoy take-out curry at Harry's place. They talk more about psychotherapy for Harry and reach some decisions.
Harry replied, “You didn’t make me feel uncomfortable, Draco.  I just don’t know what’s happening here.  Is it the firewhisky?”
He entered the door of a fashionable-looking row house and found himself in a nicely decorated waiting area.  He approached the reception desk behind which sat a pretty young woman, whose name, according to the silver name plate on her desk, was Nicola Gunn.  Harry introduced himself to Ms. Gunn tentatively, “Hello, I’m Harry Potter here to see Dr. Mathey?”
Although many years had passed since their Hogwarts days, neither Harry nor Draco could easily forget the anger and hatred they had once felt and expressed towards each other.  Their relationship immediately following the Second Wizarding War could be described as an uneasy truce.
”Minister,” Draco greeted Hermione formally.  He didn’t know what to make of her presence and so thought it best to remain silent after greeting her.
There was significant trauma that the three Gryffindors had already shared, and Harry didn’t want to subject Hermione and Ron to taking on more of his trauma.  He remembered the time when Ron and his brothers flew the Muggle car to rescue him from the Dursleys.  He recalled hearing Ron’s voice break when he exclaimed to Molly Weasley, “But mum, they were starving him!”  Ron couldn’t bear seeing Harry in pain. Harry also recalled the tears in Hermione’s eyes when she enumerated the many painful experiences Harry had endured.  Harry knew his friends were strong and would be more than willing to witness his painful memories, but he couldn’t ask it of them.
Before long Draco announced the beginning of the service.  The attendees took their seats facing Lucius’s coffin.  Pansy’s father, Perseus Parkinson, gave the eulogy.  He spoke with eloquence and passion, praising Lucius’s accomplishments and celebrating his dedication to the preservation of magical culture.  Harry read between the lines and understood that Mr. Parkinson meant the preservation of pureblood magical culture.  But this was not the time or place to express his indignation.
“What you did was perfect,” Harry said. “You did ease my pain, and I’m forever grateful.  If there’s anything I can ever do to help you out, all you have to do is ask.”
“Very well then, Harry,” Dr. Mathey said with a kind smile. “Then I must insist you call me ‘Keith.’”
Draco immediately removed his hand from the top of Harry’s head.  Again Harry said, “Draco? What’s going on?”
After a few beats Draco said, “Sorry, Harry.  I – I just felt the need to touch you.  Didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
“This was really great, Harry. I so enjoy spending time with you,” Hermione said. “Come have supper with Ron and me and the kids soon.”  She gave him a goodbye hug, and then disapparated.
Harry sighed and said, “It may be a little rough at first, but I know they’ll come around.  They’re good, fair-minded people.  Once they get to know you, they’ll come to love you as I do.”
“Well, then, why don’t we begin?” Keith said.  Placing the pensieve directly in front of Harry, he said, “Now if you can start siphoning memories about your time at the Dursleys into the pensieve . . . try to focus on memories in which you are interacting with the Dursleys, but for the time being try to avoid any memories that are too painful, too distressing.”
“It’s not surprising when you think about it, Pansy,” Draco complained to his long-time Slytherin friend.  “Potter gets to play the virtuous, all-forgiving Savior of the Wizarding World, defending his arch-nemesis, the disgusting Death-Eater, Draco Malfoy.  It’s another example of his huge Messianic complex.”
It shouldn’t have come as a surprise to Draco that he felt so at home at 12 Grimmauld Place.  It was, after all, the ancestral home of the Black family and Draco had Black blood running through his veins.  He could trace his maternal ancestry on the tapestry of the Black family tree in the drawing room.  He was astonished to see his name on the tree, as well as the names of his son Scorpius and his cousin Edward “Teddy” Lupin.
After Harry appeared slightly more sorted, Keith asked, “Is that enough for today, Harry, or would you like to do some more work?  We have enough time for another memory, I believe.”
Harry roared with laughter. The Gryffindors finished their curry dinner and chatted for a while longer, but soon it was time for Hermione to go home and put Rose and Hugo to bed.
Keith shared his perspective with Harry, saying, “There is often the unreasonable expectation that we grieve quickly and move on.  I expect that is true not just of the British Muggle culture but also of the British magical culture.  The idea that time heals all wounds, and something is wrong with us if we’re still grieving after a lot of time has passed.   But that perspective isn’t helpful to someone who’s grieving.”
Harry smiled then.  “Ginny has been an absolute gem.  The first few years of our marriage I suppose were happy enough.  There was a honeymoon period right after we tied the knot.  We had three beautiful children in quick succession.  But eventually we couldn’t deny that there was something missing for both of us.  After the first few years of marriage we were both miserable for different reasons.  Ginny recognized before I did that we weren’t right for each other.  She admitted to me that she had an adolescent crush on The Boy Who Lived and didn’t really know the real me before we married.  She discovered that the real Harry Potter had psychic scars and emotional wounds and could be quite moody.  Which was antithetical to Ginny’s light, vibrant, and upbeat personality. And then I went and fell in love with someone else.”
Both Harry and Draco were aware that Ron had called him “Draco” and not “Malfoy” for the very first time.
Harry could tell that Ron was a little less welcoming than his wife but was making an effort.  He greeted Harry with a handshake and a one-armed hug, then extended his hand to Draco and said, “Welcome, Malfoy, it’s been a while.  Heard you been keeping my good mate company.  How’s life?”
“Yes,” Draco said. “They do sound like remarkable people.”  He had been raised to believe that the Weasleys were an inferior wizarding family.  He was experiencing a high level of cognitive dissonance. The kindness and love the Weasleys had shown Harry sounded so wonderful, in contrast to the cold, forbidding, and judgmental attitude with which the Malfoys treated everyone, including their own family members.  Draco’s mind was reeling, and he realized that he needed a break from this conversation.  He need time by himself to reflect.
Draco started to weep when he saw how Cedric and Harry had argued, each of them claiming that the other deserved to win the tournament, and how they eventually agreed to claim the victory as a team.  Never before had he witnessed two teenagers exhibiting that much integrity, generosity and sportsmanship.  In that moment Draco glimpsed what his own relationship with Harry might have been like back then, and he was overcome by a feeling of sadness.
“Yes, I’m sure we can come to an agreement, Draco,” Astoria said, sounding a bit sad.  “We were always civil with each other. I can’t imagine that will change now.”
Harry’s and Draco’s emotional and sexual relationship evolved quickly after their first sexual encounter.  Within a week the wizards no longer felt awkward or shy about expressing physical affection towards each other.  As they grew more familiar with each other’s bodies, the satisfaction and excitement they derived from their sexual intimacy intensified.  Both wizards wanted to give as much pleasure to each other as possible and were more than willing to explore magical and non-magical means to achieve that end.
After his last therapy session, Harry thought about Dr. Keith Mathey’s suggestion that he share some of his painful memories with one or two close friends.  Initially he considered Hermione and Ron, who had been his closest friends for many years.  He felt some hesitancy, however, and knew he needed to figure out why.  He realized, after some reflection, that he was protecting them.  Hermione and Ron had already witnessed first-hand so many traumatic experiences in his life.
Harry tensed up then and started yelling.  Hilda cast a quick soundproofing charm to ensure that his voice wouldn’t reach therapists and clients in adjacent offices.
“I told him that I have strong feelings for you and that I am attracted to you,” Harry said looking away from Draco.  “I told him that I was afraid to tell you because I didn’t want to lose your friendship.  I told him that I want you to stay with me here and it’s OK if you don’t feel the same way about me.  I don’t want to lose what we have.”  Harry was looking down at his feet.
Harry took a deep breath and said, “Well, it’s about my relationship with Draco.  I’ve been feeling confused about it and, frankly, obsessing a bit.” He proceeded to provide Keith with pertinent details about his marriage to Ginny, coming to terms with being gay, his affair with Eoin, and the history of his relationship with Draco.
Harry looked thoughtful and then said, “We have great conversations.  He’s very smart.  He's a deep thinker who is well-informed about so many things.  I learn a lot from talking to him.”
Harry and Draco apparated a short distance from the therapy center and walked in companionable silence to Dr. Mathey’s office.   Having not been in Muggle London for some time, Draco was looking around, drinking in all the sights and sounds.  It was his very first time in a Muggle therapy office, and he was fascinated by all the Muggle objects, including the décor and the technology.  He had entered a different culture, and everything looked so new and different to the pureblood wizard.
Harry realized then that Draco didn’t want to feel indebted to him, and so he said, “Please, Draco, it will make my life so much easier if you’ll come to my place.  It doesn’t have to be for long, just until this insanity quiets down a bit.  If you stay at the manor, I will have to figure out how to deal with the disruption there, which means assigning several aurors to keep the peace.  Once the tabloids know that you are no longer at the manor, the reporters will disperse.  And once that happens you can go back home.”
Hermione grabbed Ron’s hand as she viewed Harry’s memory.  “Oh, Harry,” she whispered, “how horrible.  I knew it was bad, but I didn’t know how bad.”
After supper Hermione instructed Hugo and Rose to attend to their studies.  Harry thought how challenging it would be to have a mother who had received Outstanding grades on all her Ordinary Wizarding Levels.  He imagined that Hermione would expect her children to be as studious and as academically gifted as she was.
After greetings were exchanged, Hermione suggested that before supper they all sit out on the patio to enjoy the garden and the gorgeous summer weather.  Hermione brought out goblets of delicious elf-made wine.  It was a picture-perfect midsummer day, the garden was a riot of color and fragrance, and the three Gryffindors began to feel very relaxed and peaceful.  Draco, however, was unable to relax, feeling tense and ashamed about things he said and did in the past to his hosts.
Draco’s eyes widened in shock. “Oh my god, Harry. I’m so sorry, I had no idea.” In a flash of awareness he said, “That’s why you always carried food around with you at Hogwarts! I always thought that was so odd. It all makes sense now.”
After they disapparated from the Leaky Cauldron and were back at 12 Grimmauld Place, they talked about custody arrangements.  Draco asked Harry about the custody agreement he had with Ginny.  Harry explained that Ginny and their children were living in Whimple in Devon, not far from the Weasley family home in Ottery St. Catchpole.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco said, looking intently into Harry’s emerald eyes.  “You’re a good friend.”
Draco laughed then, a little bitterly.  “Yes, two good-looking purebloods.  A match made in heaven.  My parents were so happy when we got engaged.  Looking back I see we got married because we were expected to.  But we never had any chemistry.  It was almost like living with a stranger—we were always so civil, so polite to each other, like an emotionless business arrangement.  But we both fell in love with Scorpius when he came along.  He bonded us for a while but that just wasn’t enough for us to last.  And now we’re going to have to figure out how to share custody.”
As he reflected on his past relationships, Draco realized that for the first time in his life he now had the opportunity to enjoy a real friendship, based on warmth, good humor, honesty, and caring.  And that friendship was with Harry Potter, of all people.  He realized too how much he valued his connection with Harry.  He now had a sense of what it would be like to have a true friend, someone you could confide in, someone you admired, someone whom you wanted to help and support.  He recalled how Harry had talked to Scorpius at Lucius’s funeral, and how Draco had welled up with affection watching them interact.
Draco was surprised that Potter had that kind of insight into what he went through during the war.  He had ambivalent feelings about Potter’s defense of his actions.  He was enormously relieved to have been spared the horrors of Azkaban, thanks largely to Potter’s intercession.  He also had to admit that his sentence was remarkably light compared to the penalties applied to other Death Eaters.  It certainly didn’t hurt to have the support of the wizard who was celebrated for defeating the Dark Lord.  However, Draco could not relinquish his distrust of Potter and would often ascribe ignoble motives to his seemingly altruistic behavior.
“Harry, I know that many wizards and witches look down on all things Muggle,” Hermione said with a sigh.  “But the fact of the matter is that Muggles are good at a lot of things that we magical folk don’t excel at.  I should know, given that both my parents are Muggles.”
The wizards were getting ready for Albus Potter’s birthday on August 27.  Harry, Draco, and Scorpius had been comfortably ensconced in Malfoy Manor since the beginning of August, enjoying the beauty of the English countryside in midsummer.  Scorpius loved living with his two dads, who doted on him and took turns keeping him engaged in fun and educational activities.  Draco loved watching Harry and Scorpius interact. He would gaze fondly at his lover and his son as Harry enchanted Scorpius with tales about his encounters with magical beasts, and Scorpius would listen enrapt and wide-eyed.
Although Harry’s relationship with Draco Malfoy had improved considerably since the end of the Second Wizarding War, no one would describe the two men as friends.  They continued to circle around each other cautiously.  While both men recognized that they were no longer bitter rivals, neither Harry nor Draco felt ready to relax his guard in the other’s presence.  It was as though each was expecting the other to shoot off a stinging hex at any moment.  They continued to address each other as “Potter” and “Malfoy,” the use of surnames not only being familiar and safe, but also reflecting the brittle nature of their relationship.
“Of course,” Harry replied. “It would be awesome to have the little wizard around.  Maybe someday he can meet my Albus.  I think they’re about the same age.”
Draco was astonished by the offer.  “That’s kind of you, Harry, but I couldn’t inconvenience you like that,” Draco said softly.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco replied, “you saved my butt at my trial and kept me from being sentenced to Azkaban.  I think I could be repaying that debt for the rest of my life.”
Harry travels to central London to have his first appointment with the Muggle psychologist, Dr. Keith Mathey.
Harry, Draco and Hilda wept profusely when they viewed Peter Pettigrew murder Cedric with Voldemort’s wand in the Little Hangleton graveyard.  Draco gasped in astonishment when he saw Cedric’s shadow emerge from Voldemort’s wand and watched Harry transport Cedric’s body and the Triwizard Cup back to Hogwarts. The tears were streaming down the faces of the wizards and witch as they watched Harry cling to Cedric's body, crying and screaming.
Harry pondered for a moment and then said, “I don’t mind at all, Draco.  After Voldemort killed my parents, my mother’s sister and her husband took me in.  But they were never kind to me, in fact they abused me.  They kept me in a tiny cupboard under the stairs and essentially made me their servant.  They also withheld food from me, so I was always starving.”
When he was done expressing his anger at Petunia, Hilda again touched him gently and offered him the cup of calming draught.  Harry took the cup and sipped from it.  He then smiled at Keith and Hilda and said, “That was hard, but amazing. I feel so much lighter now.”
“No,” Draco admitted, “although that may have given me the courage to do it, but I’ve been wanting to touch you for a while now.”
Draco reflected for a moment and then said, “Pansy is the first person that comes to mind.  She’ll probably be cool with it, if a little surprised.  Astoria and Scorpius, of course.  Scorpius already loves you, and I expect Astoria will be amused by this development. I don’t imagine that Blaise will react well.  But Pike will react better than Blaise.  I dread telling my mother--she won’t react well, I can guarantee. You’re probably close to her worst nightmare—a half-blood gay wizard.  The only thing worse would be a total mudblood gay wizard or a Muggle.”
“No, he’s still at 12 Grimmauld Place.  Actually I’m rather enjoying his company.  He was thinking about returning to the manor, but I encouraged him to stay.”
Ron took a deep breath and said grudgingly, “Well, so long as he makes you happy, then he can’t be all bad.  But this is going to take a lot of getting used to.”
“But how can I see a Muggle psychologist when I won’t be able to talk about our magical world at all? As if I could say, ‘Well, you see, I’m a wizard, and there was this horribly evil wizard named Voldemort, who had these cruel followers called ‘Death Eaters,’ and I had to destroy all these horcruxes he created, but then I learned I was a horcrux myself.  And after that I died, well only a part of me died, and …”
“OK, Harry, look away from the pensieve now,” Keith whispered. “Close your eyes.  Imagine yourself back in the scene, but now you are an adult, witnessing the Dursleys screaming at this helpless little boy who has tragically lost his parents.  What will you do and say to help that little boy?  Don’t hold back, let it out.”
“Don’t be,” Draco said.  “We’d been postponing the inevitable.  Remember when you asked me a while ago if I missed her? And I said no? Well, she hasn’t been missing me either and that speaks volumes about our relationship.  We haven’t been affectionate to each other or had a meaningful conversation in years.  What’s the point in being married then?”
The next morning the wizards were a little shy with each other.  Harry continued to ruminate about what Draco might be thinking and feeling, and Draco was acutely aware that last night he had pleasured himself fantasizing about sex with Harry.  Each man was relieved that the other man did not refer to what had happened the night before. As usual they breakfasted together and then disapparated for the Ministry of Magic, where they headed their separate ways.
Draco was deeply moved by Harry’s request.  Did Harry really consider him a trusted friend? The thought induced a feeling of euphoria in him.  Without missing a beat, Draco said, “Of course I’ll do it, Harry.  I feel very honored that you asked.”
Draco thought about the prospect of returning to the manor, besieged by throngs of unfriendly faces.  Staying at 12 Grimmauld Place would certainly be preferable to trying to cope with the rabble at the manor.  And yet he was reluctant to increase his debt to Potter.  “I don’t know,” he said, “I appreciate the offer, really I do, but I don’t like the idea of putting you out.”
At his next therapy session, Harry talked to Dr. Mathey and Ms. Lancaster about his readiness to do some grief work.  In less than 30 years Harry had experienced so many tragic losses.  Many of his loved ones had been violently killed—his parents, Sirius, Remus, Nymphadora, Fred . . .  the list went on and on.  Harry told Keith and Hilda that he hadn’t coped very well with these losses and he knew he had a lot of “unfinished business” regarding death.
On a warm evening in late May, Harry apparated at Grangeley, Hermione’s and Ron’s country cottage in Kent.  He had spoken to Hermione at the Ministry a few days earlier, explaining that he wanted to discuss a personal matter with the couple.  Hermione suggested that he pop over to Grangeley for supper so that he could also see his godchildren, Hugo and Rose.
Harry felt the healing power of Draco’s words wash over him.  He continued to cry into Draco’s shoulder but a sense of comfort began to moderate his feelings of grief and despair. It made sense to him now why he had wanted so much for Draco to view this particular memory.  He had known on an intuitive level that Draco could and would provide the comfort he needed.
Harry abruptly stood up, walked over to Draco, extending his hand and pulling him up from his chair.  Leading Draco to the sofa, Harry pushed him down onto it and climbed on top of him.  Crashing his lips into Draco’s, he kissed him passionately, urgently, releasing the intense longing that had been building inside him for so long.  Draco leaned into the kiss, exploring Harry’s mouth with his lips and tongue, reveling in the hardness of Harry’s body on top of him and drinking in his sweet scent, a mélange of sandalwood and lavender.
Harry took a deep breath before responding.  “We got married too young,” he said. “I think Ginny was in love with an image in her head of who I was, and not who I actually am.  She was in love with “The Boy Who Lived,” not Harry the complicated, difficult person.  And I was desperate for stability after the war, just wanting to settle down and live a comfortable, predictable life.  I thought Ginny could provide that.  We soon discovered that our pieces didn’t fit together too well.  But probably the most important reason we divorced is that I’m gay.”
The time soon came to tell others about their relationship status.  One evening when Harry and Draco were lying in bed, Harry said, “I think it’s time for me to tell my friends and family about our relationship. You’re so important to me, as are they.  I want you to get to know them, and for them to get to know you.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, “I truly believe it’s better to give than receive.  Besides this doesn’t have to be a one-time occurrence, unless you want it to be.”
“Well, it got me wondering,” Harry said, “if the Muggle psychologist and I could engage in a process similar to what Remus and I did years ago.  Like if I can encounter my demons, metaphorically speaking, and have an actual experience of fighting back or putting them in their place or banishing them for good.  And I think it would be good if I can employ all my resources, magical and non-magical, to the endeavor.”
“I believe whole-heartedly that you did not deserve the way he treated you,” Hilda said.  Keith nodded in agreement.  Harry smiled and said, “Thank you.”
If one looks closely enough, one might notice that slight changes in the relationship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have occurred since the end of the Second Wizarding War.
Harry and Draco's relationship continues to develop.  Harry visits Hermione and Ron and tells them about his new relationship status.
Harry laughed easily.  “Well, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that I’m bisexual, but the fact of the matter is that I prefer men to women.  It took me a while to admit that to myself.”
“OK, that sounds fair, Harry,” was all he was able to manage.  Then, realizing that he needed time and space by himself, he said, “Maybe we can share a goodnight hug then?”
“Hello, Draco,” Hermione said, “And please call me Hermione. No need for formality after all these years.  I am sorry for your loss.”
“So, here’s what I suggest,” Keith said.  “Let’s meet again next week at the same time.  For homework, I’d like you to think of some less painful, less serious traumatic experiences we could start working on.  In my business we sometimes use the terms “little t traumas” and “big T traumas” to distinguish between less severe and more severe traumatic experiences.  So try to come up with a list of “little t traumas” in your life that we can start working on, OK?”
“OK! Thank you, Uncle Harry, thank you, Draco!” the children shouted and ran upstairs with the game.
While Harry was in his therapy session, Draco was in Edinburgh negotiating with Astoria.  After considerable discussion they agreed to a shared custody arrangement whereby Scorpius would spend three months with each parent.  During the three-month period, the other parent would visit on a regular basis.  They agreed that Scorpius would stay with Astoria in Edinburgh through the end of July and begin a three-month stay with Draco starting at the beginning of August.  The couple had also come to an agreement on how they would divide communal property.  Astoria planned to claim what belonged to her from Malfoy Manor and teleport it to Edinburgh within the next three weeks.
Harry nodded.  “That sounds good to me,” he said, adding with a smile, “I don’t want to get overwhelmed either.”
“I will, Keith, and thank you,” Harry replied.  Looking at Hilda, he said, "Thank you too, Hilda. I am grateful for your support."
Harry took a long pause, and it was clear to Draco that he was going back in his mind to an earlier time.   Draco was sitting on the edge of his seat, anxious to hear more.  Eventually Harry continued, “I started frequenting The Walloping Wand, the gay bar in Diagon Alley.  In Auror training I had learned some transfiguration spells so I was able to disguise myself enough to be unrecognizable.  I was petrified that someone would discover that the Head Auror of the Ministry of Magic, the Boy Who Lived, was gay.  At the Walloping Wand I met a gay wizard named Eoin. We hit it off, one thing led to another, and we ended up having a year-long affair.”
Harry kept telling himself, “Don’t fuck up this friendship.” He resolved to keep his strong feelings for Draco in check, all the while continuing to treat the other wizard with kindness and affection.  He couldn’t in good conscience distance emotionally from Draco just because he was attracted to him.  No, Harry would not refrain from expressing appreciation to Draco for his friendship and emotional support.  But perhaps he could control his impulses to admire Draco’s long, lithe, and surprisingly strong body.
“Yes, it does hurt,” Keith agreed.  “Unfortunately the pain is unavoidable.  It’s particularly difficult when someone has died by violence.  The emotions are so complex, intense and frightening—sadness, anger, rage, impotence, desire for vengeance.  So, of course it’s natural and normal to avoid those difficult emotions and sometimes we have to give ourselves a break from them.  That’s why self-care and social support are so important when we’re doing intensive grief work.”
“Intense,” Harry replied. “Until I started speaking, I didn’t realize how much I had repressed and denied about my relationship with Snape.  It surprises me now that I named my son Albus Severus, seeing how much anger I harbored for the way Snape treated me all those years.  I suppose that when Albus was born I was focused more on Snape’s work as a double agent during the war and how he protected me, rather than on how badly he treated me at Hogwarts.”
“Well, I kept that a secret from everyone, even you and Ron,” Harry admitted. “I was ashamed of being so scared, especially when the Slytherins made fun of me after that horrible experience on the Hogwarts Express.”
“Of course I have a Muggle phone!” Harry huffed. “How could the Head Auror not have a Muggle phone? Nowadays you can’t do good field work without one. I’ll have you know that I have the latest iPhone.”
“I’m sorry to barge in on you like this, Astoria,” Draco said, “but I had an urgent need to talk to you about our marriage.”
The party spent the rest of the evening enjoying excellent food, delicious elf-wine, and fluid, friendly conversation.  After Harry and Draco had thanked their hosts, bid them farewell, and apparated back at 12 Grimmauld Place, they pronounced the visit pleasant and successful.
Harry pretended to deliberate for a moment, while the children stared at him expectantly.  Then he smiled and produced a Muggle game called “Gnomes at Night.”  He figured that they probably already owned most of the magical games and toys available at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, so a Muggle game was a safe bet.
Harry looked thoughtful before replying, “Ron was very mad at me for a while. He felt betrayed.  Not just because Ginny and I were getting a divorce, but mostly because he was my best friend and he didn’t know I was gay.  He thought I kept it from him, which I suppose I did, but only because I was oblivious or in denial myself.  Ron eventually came around after we had a long heart-to-heart.”
Hermione looked across her desk at her childhood friend, now a handsome man in his late 20s.  Compassion for Harry welled up inside her.
Harry knew that in that moment his relationship with Draco had gone to the next level.  This frightened him not a little. It would be so easy to fall in love with the stunning Slytherin with his beautiful white blond hair and silver eyes.  And that wouldn’t do at all. Even though Draco and Astoria were currently separated, they were still married, and all the evidence suggested that Draco was straight.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said. “I’m definitely up for more. And next time I want to give as well as receive.”
Narcissa was all politeness.  “Mr. Potter.  Thank you for coming.  It means a great deal to Draco and me.”
Harry pondered for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think I can talk to him about it.  If Draco and I agree to go ahead, I’ll call and give you a heads-up.”
“Well, as I was reading through the material, I thought about the Boggart work I did with Remus Lupin at Hogwarts.  You can think of that as an Experiential therapy technique for wizards and witches.  You have the experience of encountering the thing you most dread, and you use a Riddikulus incantation to change it into something harmless.  Follow?”
“Of course, Harry,” Ron said. “Since it means that much to you.  I’ll do whatever it takes to like the git.”
And for the first time in his life Draco thought that the notion of soulmates might not be such hogwash after all.  Looking back on their Hogwarts days, Draco reflected that their obsessive dislike of each other years ago had, in a very odd way, foreshadowed their strong love for each other now.   He could not imagine a life for himself that did not include an intense relationship with Harry Potter.
Yes, Harry was a catch, not only because he was physically attractive, but also because he was strong, brave, and kind.  No longer the pompous, selfish, bigoted Slytherin he had once been, Draco was now able to acknowledge that he had been the beneficiary of Harry’s strength, bravery, and kindness on many occasions since his trial.  And for this he was grateful.
The topic of potions was a prime example.  It was Harry’s least favorite subject at Hogwarts, but he found himself intrigued and impressed by how much Draco knew about potions.  And Draco made the subject fascinating.  Harry thought that if Draco had been the Potions master at Hogwarts instead of Snape, Harry would have really enjoyed the class and learned so much more.
“Let me think about it, Keith,” Harry said.  “I can see how it might be helpful, but at this point I’m not sure who I’d want to view some of these painful memories.”
“Truth be told, not as much as I miss Scorpius,” Draco replied. “Things were tense between Astoria and me for quite some time.  We were under a lot of stress what with father’s incarceration, mother’s departure for Paris, my trial.  Mother never approved of Astoria—political differences, you know—and Astoria was angry at me for not standing up for her more.  The thing is that I know my mother. If I had stood up for Astoria, that would have increased mother’s resentment towards her.  Looking back, I think we stayed together as long as we did because of Scorpius.”
She stood up from her chair.  Draco rose too and pulled her into a hug.  Tears welled up in Draco’s eyes and a single tear rolled down Astoria’s cheek.  “Goodbye, Draco,” she said. “Goodbye, Astoria,” Draco replied before he broke away from the hug and disapparated.
Harry understood what Draco meant about “political differences” between Narcissa and Astoria.  Narcissa was a pureblood bigot; Astoria was not.  Apparently Narcissa disapproved of Astoria’s tolerance of non-pureblood wizards and witches.  Harry knew he would have gotten along much better with Astoria than with Narcissa.
“Mate, you are the strongest wizard who ever lived!” Ron exclaimed. “I can’t believe everything you survived when you were just a kid. I don’t tell you often enough that you are completely awesome.”
Keith brought out a beautiful stone bowl carved with runes.  He said, “Harry, this pensieve is intended only for your therapy.  It will contain only the memories you siphon into it while in therapy.  At the conclusion of your therapy, you will have three options.  The first option is to take the pensieve with you to do as you please.  The second option is to entrust us to safeguard it, and I can provide details about how that is accomplished.  The third option is to destroy the pensieve.   No need to decide now, and we will have plenty of opportunity to discuss these options further.  While you are in therapy, the pensieve will remain here under lock and key and safeguarded by several protective enchantments.  Do you have any questions?”
It was decided that Draco and Harry would apparate at Malfoy Manor to select clothes and whatever other personal effects Draco required and teleport these belongings to 12 Grimmauld Place.  While at the manor, they would also inform Draco’s house elf Roody that his services would be required at Harry’s residence until further notice.  Draco insisted that his owl, Hellebora, not be transported via a spell.  Instead he would instruct Hellebora to fly to 12 Grimmauld Place and attend him there for the duration of his stay.
“What do you think that would look like, Harry?” Keith asked gently.  “What words would you like Professor Snape to say back to you?  Can you pretend to be him, responding to what you just told him?”
Hermione laughed out loud.  “Honestly, Harry,” she exclaimed. “But seriously, I think there’s a psychologist who could fit the bill.  His name is Keith Mathey and his understanding of magic is impressive, probably because he has a close relative who is a witch or wizard.  Dr. Mathey comes highly recommended by the staff at St. Mungo’s.  I’ve heard that he is one of the very few Muggles who have been invited to speak to hospital staff about mental and emotional health.  He has also collaborated with magical healers on some difficult cases, and surprisingly the healers expressed appreciation for Dr. Mathey’s assistance."
Since moving into 12 Grimmauld Place, Draco found, to his surprise, that he rather enjoyed Harry’s company.  The two wizards had quite naturally fallen into a comfortable rhythm, often enjoying breakfast together at home before apparating together at the Ministry of Magic for a day of work.  After work they might go for a pint at the Leaky Cauldron, or just head back to the Black ancestral home for a delicious supper prepared by Kreacher and Roody.  The two house-elves seemed to be working together harmoniously and had come to regard both Harry and Draco as their wizard masters.
Harry nodded and said, “Maybe you can ask Astoria if it’s OK for Scorpius to come stay with us for a while.  Would you like that?”
“So, I have been seeing Keith and Hilda for almost two months now,” Harry said, “and I seem to be making good progress.  We have been using a pensieve to retrieve, view, and work through some of my painful past memories.  It has been a difficult but rewarding process.”
“I like him,” Harry began tentatively.  “I like him a lot.  We’ve gotten so close in the last couple of months, and I love having him around.  And I’m sexually attracted to him.  I can’t stop thinking about him.  But he’s straight, which sucks.  So I have worked hard to keep my feelings for him in check.  But then the night after my last therapy session, we were sitting in the drawing room drinking firewhisky and he ran his fingers through my hair.  And that freaked me out.”
“Yes,” Harry replied, “but let’s wait until after supper, OK? It’s a bit complicated, so maybe the three of us can have a quiet sit-down after we eat.”
Harry did feel more energized after Hilda cast the charm.  After saying farewell to Keith and Hilda, he left their office with a bounce in his step.  He felt hopeful about the therapy work he had just begun.  He decided not to take Muggle transportation home, instead choosing to apparate in his living room at 12 Grimmauld Place.
Harry continued, “Draco, I asked Hermione to join us because I thought she could help us figure out how to deal with the “media circus,” as you so aptly described it in your message to me.  I assume the circus has already descended on Malfoy Manor?”
Harry continued to make good progress in his therapy sessions with Keith and Hilda.  Starting in August he began working through his grief about losing Remus, Tonks and Sirius.  This was difficult and painful work, but Harry was nothing if not courageous and tackled it head on.  He knew that eventually he would have to address his terrifying near death experiences, but he knew that Keith would guide him towards that point gradually and with sensitivity.  Harry also knew that Draco would provide whatever emotional support he required.
Then Draco announced, “Let us now proceed to the garden and pay our respects at my father’s tomb.”  Taking his mother’s hand, Draco led the procession into the beautiful garden surrounding the manor.  The assembly walked to a secluded corner of the garden where an impressive tomb stood, the name Lucius Malfoy and the image of a serpent emblazoned in silver on the stunning Carrara marble surface.
However, Parkinson’s words continued to resonate in Draco’s mind.  Was he being unfair to Potter?  Was it so hard to believe that Potter’s motives were pure? Despite what his enemies thought, Draco did possess a bit of self-awareness and wasn’t completely devoid of conscience. In spite of the fact that Lucius, Draco's father, was a classic narcissist and  had done everything in his power to prevent Draco from developing either self-awareness or a conscience.  The sole purpose of Draco's existence was to bring honor to Lucius.  Draco had no need of self-awareness; he need only be aware of Lucius’s needs and wants.  Nor did he need a conscience.  That would only prevent Draco from carrying out Lucius’s commands.  But now that Lucius was incarcerated, his influence on Draco was waning.
For the first time in his life Draco really understood the bond that Harry shared with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, and he realized that throughout his life he had desperately yearned to share that kind of bond with at least one other person.  All the despicable behavior of his youth had been an ineffective defense against the pain of loneliness.  He now knew that he wanted more than anything to be close friends with Harry Potter.
Draco’s face lit up at the possibility. “I would love that, Harry,” he said. “Are you sure that would be OK?”
Draco chimed in then and said, “Scorpius, this is the man I was telling you about.  Harry Potter, remember?”
Harry then thought about Draco and concluded immediately that it would be too much to ask.  Draco had recently suffered so much disruption in his life.  His father committed suicide, he hosted his father’s funeral less than two weeks ago, he was separated from his wife and son, and he was living with Harry, far away from his family estate.  Harry realized that he could not ask Draco to witness his painful memories either.
“I know,” Harry said, “but they’re forgiving people.  Maybe if you find a way to say you’re sorry for things you said or did in the past, that would help.  Think about it, OK?”
Harry meets with Dr. Keith Mathey and Ms. Hilda Lancaster for the second time.  Using a pensieve he retrieves and works through some memories of childhood abuse.
Hermione, Ron and Harry retired to the parlor after supper, and the time had come for Harry to talk to his best friends about the pensieve work he had been doing in therapy.  He started out by explaining how his therapy sessions had been going with Dr. Mathey and his assistant, Ms. Lancaster, who was both a psychological technician and a witch.  Harry explained Ms. Lancaster’s role in his therapy sessions.
“I think maybe a calming draught will help,” Hilda said.  She rose and left, returning soon with a cup of the potion.  Harry accepted the proffered drink gratefully.
Harry realized that he had become quite fond of Draco.  He was extremely intelligent and inquisitive, well informed on a wide range of topics, and an excellent conversationalist.  Harry found that, no matter what he and Draco talked about, the conversation was stimulating and informative.  Harry was impressed by Draco’s breadth of and thirst for knowledge.  Although Harry admired Hermione’s brilliance, he often found her to be a bit pedantic.  On the other hand, he could listen to Draco speak for hours on any topic he was passionate about—the discourse was bound to be exciting and entertaining.
Harry expressed his understanding with a nod, and Keith continued.  “Grief isn’t the problem.  Grief reflects how important a relationship is to us.  The more important the relationship, the deeper the grief.  I’d like you to think of your grief as honoring the relationships you are grieving, honoring the people you lost.  Think about how to grieve well, acknowledging what you have lost and expressing the feelings associated with that loss.  The goal is to grieve well, as opposed to not grieving at all.”
Harry said goodbye to Astoria and Scorpius and then followed Draco to greet other guests.  He had several cordial conversations with the Slytherins—Pansy and Pike were quite friendly, while Blaise was a bit standoffish.
After closing the office door, Dr. Mathey made the introductions.  “Mr. Potter, please meet my associate Ms. Hilda Lancaster.  Hilda, please meet Mr. Harry Potter.”  Harry and Ms. Lancaster exchanged polite greetings.
During his next several therapy sessions, Harry continued to do pensieve work with the help of Keith and Hilda.  They agreed that for the time being he would focus on painful experiences that were not life-threatening.  Only after he was feeling more resolved about those experiences would they proceed to address Harry’s “big T traumas.”
“Well, definitely not full disclosure,” Harry said.  “I’d have to go with one of the in-between ones. I’ll just go crazy if I say and do nothing.
At that moment Hermione called them into supper and shouted up the stairs to Rose and Hugo.  The food was plentiful and delicious.  Harry caught up on the latest news of the Weasley extended family.  George’s business, Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley, was doing very well.  George continued to invent new products that would appeal to his youthful clientele. The latest most popular item was the Elf Hat, which transformed the wearer’s face into that of a house-elf.  What people found most amusing was that the wearer somehow remained identifiable in spite of looking like a house-elf from the neck up.  Arthur and Molly were enjoying their retirement years, especially appreciating the additional time to be doting grandparents.  Hermione and Ron grumbled a bit about how Ron’s parents constantly spoiled Hugo and Rose.  Harry commiserated, saying that his own children were always less pliable after spending time with Arthur and Molly.
After siphoning several memories of his encounters with Professor Snape into the pensieve, Harry and Hilda viewed the memories, after which Harry began to describe them to Keith and reflect on his relationship with the professor who he always believed hated him.   Keith encouraged Harry to imagine that he was talking directly to Snape.  “What do you want to say to him, Harry?”
Now, however, it had become impossible for Draco to stay in the manor with the hordes of obnoxious reporters skulking about. Not to mention the gloating wizards and witches who, overcome with schadenfreude, descended on the manor in the hopes of seeing a grieving Draco.  Invisibility spells, potions and incantations could not prevent the intruders from violating Draco’s boundaries, at least not for any extended period of time.   He needed help from the Ministry--Potter and Granger were in the best position to provide that help.
