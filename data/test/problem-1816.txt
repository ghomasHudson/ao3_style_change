In fact, only Luna seemed unaffected by the heat, having advised everyone to ‘think cool and it will be so’. Draco had thought Susan would strangle Luna at that point and suspected the only reason she hadn’t was because she looked ready to pass out from the heat. Justin had taken off his hat and was waving it about to try and cool her face and neck.
Where Draco and Harry begin to fall for each other and Draco is that much closer to finding his cure.
Thankfully, he realised it was futile to argue and sat down across from her at the kitchen table, beginning to tell her what he knew so far.
“That’s what you said when she said she was applying to McGonagall for permission for us to take driving lessons and look how that turned out.” Draco could remember the cocky assurance falling from Blaise’s face when they were told McGonagall was more than happy for them to go careening around the grounds in Muggle death machines.
“More,” murmured Draco, as he finally settled himself on top of Harry’s lap and ground down, his cock reaching full hardness after mere seconds of clothed contact with Harry’s arousal.
love, like family. You know?” Her lip began to tremble as the thought that Harry might not be on the same page, sniffing. “You do know, don’t you?”
He shuffled around on his chair and looked around the Great Hall, taking in all the changes that had been made over the summer. The main change was that there were no longer any houses. All the house tables had been replaced with seven circular ones, one for each year, with the aim that everyone would be able to see and speak to their peers without hindrance. The house banners were also missing, replaced with large tapestries showing colourful scenes from wizarding history. It looked nothing like the Hogwarts he had grown to know and love.
I have been in love with you for so long, probably for longer than I dare to admit.
“I—I guess you just needed an in—incentive.” Draco gasped as Harry leaned forwards and sucked greedily on one of his nipples. “Oh Circe! Fuck, Harry…the spells. Can you—”
know who he was after all, and yet was still being kind to him. “I’m Healer Greyson. Try not to worry; I’m just going to perform some diagnostic spells upon you, and we’ll go from there. There’s a good lad.”
It had been seven days since Malfoy had caused a scene in the middle of the court yard. Everywhere he went, Harry heard varying versions of what had happened, with one group of first years actually daring to ask him if it were true that he had had sex with the Giant Squid and was now expecting baby squids.. It was madness, and it was showing no signs of stopping any time soon.
Harry pulled the cork from the bottle of wine Hermione had brought and poured them both a generous glass. Something told him they would both need a decent boost to get through the sheer weirdness that was to be this evening. He handed Hermione her glass with a wink and a sly grin, hoping it came across as sexy and not just creepy, and took a large sip, noticing that Hermione was doing the same.
“No, think about it,” he insisted, his eyes unusually bright. “The last time the room was used, as far as we know, was with the Fiendfyre.”
Abruptly, Draco pulled back from the kiss and heaved himself off Harry’s lap. However, before Harry could form any words, Draco pulled him to his feet and began to pull him towards the stairs. Harry, desperate for another taste of Draco’s mouth, allowed himself to be led. Just as Harry placed his foot on the bottom step, the floorboard creaked shrilly, jerking Harry out of his lust-fuelled haze. He tugged his hand out of Draco’s grasp and stepped back, trying to put as much distance between them as possible.
"Well, she tried. In all honesty, it looked like she was trying to dance out a tapeworm. And now," he screeched in a manner that would have made Lavender proud, "she wants me to fucking massage her so she's all bendy for me when we fuck! This is just going too far. She's not backing down at all!"
“Oh, it’s another clue!” Before anyone could do anything further, Luna scooped the rope up and placed it gently on her lap. “I’ll keep it safe for now, just in case.”
He found himself inevitably thinking back to when he was sitting in the parlour looking at a medical report from the family Healer. Narcissa had told him that Draco had allowed her to call the Healer when he was throwing up constantly every morning, seemingly without a cause. However, when the Healer announced that Draco was pregnant and proceeded to give a full report on the status of his condition, Draco apparently clammed up, all but threw the Healer into the Floo, and had refused to discuss the situation ever since. She’d only found out about Harry being the father when Draco had gone on a two-day bender, and she had stumbled across Draco’s journal while searching his room for clues to his whereabouts.
"Pretty hot to me," Blaise said with a wink.
“That’s it! Harry, you were being a bit horrible to Malfoy and then the door wouldn’t open. Maybe you've got to apologise!”
I’ll be waiting on your reply, which you WILL NOT SEND UNTIL YOU’VE THOUGHT IT THROUGH!
“Oh, it’s you, is it? Wha’ can I do fer you, Malfoy? Well? Wha’s the matter? Kneazle got yer tongue?”
“Potter, kindly remove your pet from my person.”
“So, I do believe you owe me the rest of your Sorting story. Why did you ask to be placed in Gryffindor?”
"It's only down the hallway. I think we can manage." He took her arm in his and marched towards the door. "Besides, we're taking a long lunch."
“What was it Ron said? Oh yeah,
“Damned right,” agreed Ron as Theo, Blaise and Justin nodded in agreement. “Pass me a bottle, would you?”
"Not as dire! Did you see what she did?" Harry screamed, wrapping himself around Draco like an anchor. "She touched my knee, Draco!"
“I don’t need luck,” he grumbled, tucking his now buttoned shirt into his trousers. “I need a fucking filter so I don’t make this worse.”
“I just never thought that you would be seeing those you lost too. You miss him?”
At least ten minutes later, Draco finally emerged, dressed in loose pyjama pants and a short-sleeved t-shirt. His feet were bare, and his hair was still wet, and he rubbed a fluffy white towel over the wet locks as he walked. Draco sat on the bed crossed legged and slowly began to comb out his hair. Then, once it was hanging in a damp straight curtain to his chin, he gathered it up into a small bun on top of his head, securing it with an elastic.
“I just— That’s not the point! The point is, why was he there if he doesn’t need to be?”
"Yeah, just keep doing what you're doing," Blaise assured her. "You won't have to have sex, just a little more flirting and then I bet we win."
Harry watched Pansy walk away in search of Draco, followed by Theo and Blaise, both looking very grim.
"Just went down the wrong way is all. So, how about those Cannons?"
“The others were too rigid, though.” Draco thought back to when they had tried ground marble. The vibrations from the resultant explosion had caused several of Severus’ shelves to shatter. He peeled off his gloves and goggles and cast quick, but adequate, Cleaning Charms to rectify the mess he’d made. Once the room was put to rights, he began to scoop his notes and books into his bag, his fingers struggling to fix the lid back onto his ink pot, barely managing to stifle a yawn. “I’ll do some more reading after finishing my homework. There needs to be something…maybe sandstone?”
As if hailed by the ruckus, Harry appeared in the doorway clutching a bundle of packages, flanked by Weasley and Granger, all three looking extremely concerned. To be honest, Draco couldn’t blame them, what with Pansy and Ginny clawing at him and Blaise to get at each other, Ginny’s eyes overflowing with tears.
“I just—I was sick of everything I loved being taken away from me. My parents, my home, even my reputation, and then I found Atlantis, and I just loved him so much. He was mine, and then we came here, and suddenly I felt like I was losing him. I just couldn’t lose anything else. I don’t expect you to understand.”
Adults indeed. They were eighteen! Draco was no more an adult than McGonagall was a spring chicken. What the eighth year basically consisted of was a jumble of students, all suffering from different degrees of PTSD, trying their best to sink or swim together. Some were coping better than others, of course. Granger seemed to be in her element, her nose in a book and back at the top of the class. Blaise had resumed his whorish ways, seemingly determined to double the notches on his bedpost by the end of the year. Greg appeared fine, but he wasn’t, that much was obvious. He barely slept, barely spoke, barely ate. He’d taken to following Draco around more than usual and Draco, for once, didn’t mind. They seemed to embrace each other’s company, and neither one felt inclined to push the other.
“No!” screeched Draco suddenly, his eyes shining with angry tears. “Please just fucking leave me alone. It’s the least you could do.”
“Whatever, Potter.” Malfoy used his Seeker skills to hook his pinkie around Atlantis’ tail and took a step away from Harry and Treacle. “Come along, Atlantis.”
Draco lifted his eyes from the mocking note and began to survey the other students sitting at the eighth year table. They were all chatting with each other, eating their breakfasts, and one or two were even scribbling last-minute additions to unfinished homework assignments. No one looked suspicious or smug or inordinately interested in his mail. He scanned the other house tables for clues, but no one was paying him one lick of attention! Unable to cope with the idea that someone was in that hall laughing at his confusion, he quickly grabbed the letter and his bag and strode out of the room, careful to keep his head high the entire way. He needed to check on the ducklings before class anyway.
Harry strode out of the alley he’d just apparated to and crossed the street towards
not doing anything, it’s
Draco watches as Harry greets each individual duckling, taking care to pet and coo over Pavoa as she recovers from yet another near-death experience.
“What?” challenged Harry, trying not to laugh at Malfoy’s obvious distress. “I love treacle tarts, and I love her. I think it suits her just fine.”
“You looked at Hagrid’s?” asked Harry, unable to hide his astonishment.
With that, Harry led Draco upstairs and set about giving him a reason to let Harry love him for the rest of their lives.
“No, you were harassing. Ron has a point, though. If you want to be an Auror, you’ll need to pay more attention to what’s actually going on around you and not just what you want to see.”
“Why not?” argued Draco stubbornly.
“I’m not sure how things were done in your household, Draco, but I was taught we look with our eyes, not our hands.” Draco chanced a look at his godfather and was relieved to find he was smiling in amusement. “What were you looking at, anyway? Ah, unicorn tears. Yes, very rare, but not strong enough in terms of healing properties to meet our requirements.
“Sorry,” murmured Draco, his eyes fixed on the carpet, “I was just looking…”
Draco stood at the window in his room — their room, and looked out at the snow covering the grounds. It looked like it was going to be a white Christmas after all. The ceremony had been small; “Family only,” McGonagall had advised. His mother had looked beautiful in her ice blue robes, the white fur trimming the edges making her look like a fairy-tale snow queen. Molly Weasley had been there for Potter, her red hair frizzing haphazardly from under her midnight-blue hat. She had sniffed the entire way through the ceremony as if it were a wake and not a bonding. He and Potter had locked eyes and joined hands in resignation as the magic of the bonding fizzled through them both, stripping away their freedom to choose.  As the final ribbons of light wrapped around them and dimmed, so did Draco’s dreams of getting married and having an heir. When thought about that way, Draco supposed it may well have been a wake.
“I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
“What was you?”
Harry looked up just in time to catch Hermione’s wounded expression and flashed a grateful smile at his friend. No doubt Ron would be paying for that later on.
Before he knew it, the bell was sounding the end of the torture and the beginning of dinner. Draco couldn’t wait to leave the disaster of the lesson behind. Unfortunately, the class as a whole seemed to feel the same way, and the doorway was one seething mass of students trying to force their way through. At least Greg had waited on him, and Draco didn’t complain as the boy proceeded to roughly shove people out of their way.
When Harry merely continued to glare, Ron continued.
At that moment, Harry, Neville, and Draco arrived at the table, armed with several bottles of wine and seven glasses. Just as they were sorting out who was having white and who was having red, Pansy and Ron plonked themselves down into the two remaining chairs, both looking rather pleased with themselves.
“Hold my what?” asked Malfoy, turning back towards Harry looking supremely alarmed.
“I can’t find Atlantis. He’s bloody pregnant and ready to pop, and I can’t find him! He needs to eat, Potter. Come on, you need to help me look.”
“I assure you that it is indeed possible.” Narcissa’s voice was calm and steady, which helped Harry wrap his aching brain around the concept. “Rare, but possible.”
“Then why is he down at the lake in the pouring rain?”
Harry's words seemed to jerk Draco out of the petulant tantrum he had been indulging in and he grumpily ran his eyes over Harry critically. "Have you had your tank and things checked out? If you run out of air, I'm not giving you mine."
Harry strode over and peered at the note, barely managing to contain the growl that was rumbling within his chest.
Because, I swear to fucking Merlin and Morgana, if you ever hurt me like that again, I swear I’ll hex your balls off. You got that?
"Guys," groaned Neville, sounding like he was in pain, "don't you think this is getting a bit out of hand?"
?” demanded Harry, scandalised. “Some friends you guys are! You never see things from my point of view, do you?”
“Promise me that you won’t regret me.”
“Yes,” Harry interrupted. “We have no reason to stay bonded anymore. As Draco said, we can go on with our lives as if none of this ever happened.”
Draco realised his hands were shaking and folded his arms across his chest, grateful he was wearing robes with sleeves that fell past his wrists. He just needed to hold it together until Granger got the bloody door opened.
“Harry—”
"But I'm his best friend," Pansy said, and she almost cringed at the sound of the whine in her own voice. "He's meant to have told me already, and by his own choice! Not because I caught him out."
Hermione looked them over. "What're you two so happy about?"
“Yes Draco, as my date.” Harry’s fingers are twisting in his jumper, showing just how nervous he is, and it’s what gives Draco the courage to answer.
Harry placed the last of his school books on the desk in the corner of his room and heaved a tired sigh. Finally, after an hour of fussing around, he’d managed to unpack his things. Usually, he would just leave everything in his trunk, but he didn’t think he could cope with the inevitable lecture from Hermione that it would earn him.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy! I swear to Salazar if you don’t open this door I’ll blast it open!”
"What the bloody hell would you know, Potter? When was the last time you came by the library anyway?" Harry narrowed his eyes in annoyance. It's not like he just sat around on his butt all day, every day, and anyway, being a chef was much more stressful than being a poncy librarian!
“I need some of your hair, blood, and tears. Your magical essence is my missing ingredient; it's been balancing my core, remember?”
“And sexual orientation.” smiled Harry, warming to their theme. “They should know the options.”
“You know, they’re not going to want to be separated in a hurry, and it really will take two parents to look after...how many is it...twenty two babies?”
The tension fell off Neville's face, and he relaxed. "So, now you know." He sounded almost relieved, which was crazy, because why wasn't Neville shocked?
Harry watched as Draco processed the information he had just been hit with, his face changing from shock to surprise and, finally resting in amazed delight.
Orion got mad. He said that when he hired me, he thought that it would be easy to get in my bed. That I was just being unreasonably coy; that I have no reason to refuse him. He’s had enough of me now. I thought he was going to fire me and kick me out, but it’s worse than that. It turns out that he has been making me brew illegal potions. I noticed there was something odd with the dosage and the ingredients, but I trusted him. Salazar, was I wrong…
Mostly, people wanted to thank him for winning the war, but one slightly odd guy—who he vaguely remembered as a Ravenclaw—nudged him surreptitiously and thanked him for his stance on pizza toppings in an interview a few weeks ago. Apparently, it had settled some lifelong debate the man had been having with his wife. Although Ron had looked at the guy like he was certifiable, Harry had felt his whole mood lighten considerably from the strange encounter.
However, before Harry could respond, Miss Bumble began to address the class once again.
“You know, the baby.”
"Ok, but only a few inches," she agreed, folding her waistband in on itself until her calf-length pencil skirt was finally sitting above her knee and the slit hit her mid-thigh. "Right. I'm going back in. But I swear, if he tries to get me into bed, I'll murder him
where the point should have been.
From there, Harry moved to Draco’s left arm, lifting it by the wrist to look at the Dark Mark and the tattoo Draco had added there mere weeks after the war had ended. The tattoo artist Draco had found had worked wonders, turning the abhorrent mark into something positive, almost beautiful.  The mark itself was still intact, if a little faded, but the head of the snake at the bottom of the skull had been elongated, transformed into the nub of a raven’s feather. The topmost section of the feather broke off into several small ravens, all flying free towards the edge of his arm.
I’m sure it was because of the bond. The Healers said that it was stable enough for us to live apart, but that the pull might be stronger once we met again. I think we both underestimated how bloody strong it would be. It felt like an elastic band that got pulled and pulled until it snapped in our faces last night. I’m also blaming the wine
He raised his eyebrows, muttering under his breath. "I don't doubt it."
He scrunched up his list into a ball, threw the parchment at the wall, and downed the rest of his drink. There was nothing else to do but accept that, for whatever reason, Malfoy was helping the ducklings. What’s more, he obviously didn’t want anyone to know about it, sneaking around and keeping them in a secluded area by the lake. Almost as if he didn’t want anything nice about himself to get out and ruin his murderous, cowardly reputation. Malfoy would probably be ridiculously embarrassed if anyone found out, actually.
“Now, boys. Less swearing and shouting, please! Mr Malfoy, please mind your mirrors and indicators,” The squat, balding instructor with bad breath said, his voice as bland as his face.
“Potter, you need to come,” Malfoy’s whispered words were loud and clear.
“I do not!”
When the door actually appeared, he half expected the handle to be red hot, the Fiendfyre still burning away inside for all eternity, much like his guilt. Except, when he reached out his hand and touched the brass handle, the metal was cool. Soothing.
Hermione closed the door quietly behind her and looked helplessly around the hall.
“Well, a celebratory drink is certainly in order. And Treacle certainly thinks that Malfoy men are a good catch. Maybe I should take a leaf out of her book?”
"Let's just say I have a few thoughts of my own about handling your...wand."
“You’re not, are you? You’ve not even listened to a thing we’ve said at all.” Pansy’s accusation fell flat and Draco couldn’t find it within himself to care.
“Cute? They won’t be cute! They’ll be hard work and lots of stress because Atlantis is basically a single parent now, are you happy with yourself?”
“Helpful,” grumbled Draco, as he reached over and snagged a drink from one of the bottles of Firewhisky. If he was going to be stuck in here, he might as well join them in their drinking.
"Relax. I turned your alarm off. You're far too stressed out so I called both our bosses and got us a couple of weeks of emergency time off work."
“Why?” both Harry and Malfoy demanded at the exact same time.
Draco looks sharply at Harry, searching his face for any hints of this being some kind of sick joke. “As a date?” The very words make Draco’s heart thud in his chest so aggressively he wouldn’t be surprised if he had a heart attack.
“What is it with you and ducks?”
“I don’t want to, Harry. This…this isn’t how I thought my first time would be.”
“This!” Draco practically yelled the word, as he strode over to the head of his bed and snatched up the offending item, brandishing it at Neville angrily. “I’m on about
“I’m fine, Ronnnald!” She dragged the word out as she wrapped her arms around Ron’s neck and attempted to pull him down for a kiss. “I love your freckles, especially the ones on your bum.”
“Draco? What the— My head is killing me!” Draco smiled at the unsuspecting Gryffindor and helped him sit up, pressing the phial into Harry’s hands as he did so.
Harry looked at Hermione, who kept opening her mouth as if trying to speak. Her face was pale with red splotches and Harry found himself checking her over in concern.
“Potter!”
*****
“I was wanting to discuss my project with you. I know what I want to do, and I’ve been researching it in the library as much as I can, but I’m not sure how to actually do it…”
Draco waggled his eyebrows, making Harry burst into laughter. This may be a ridiculous crusade, but if it was important to Draco, then Harry would do it. The wand stuff was just an added bonus.
“I picked you up a few things since you weren’t feeling up to Hogsmeade. I’m going to make sure they all don’t kill each other. I won’t be long.”
Draco’s chest was tighter than it had ever been before. The feeling had begun when he’d received the Hogwarts five-year reunion invitation, and it doubled in intensity when Pansy and Blaise had descended upon him. Waving their matching invitations in his face, they demanded they all go to represent Slytherin House in style.
He watched her as she gave him one last look before turning on her heel and walking away, her footsteps fading as she went.
“He’s awake! Quickly, get the Healer!” The urgent whisper wasn’t a voice he recognised, but that didn’t mean much. There weren’t many people from before around any more, most of them either dead or having fled the country.
Draco stared resolutely out the window. If he ignored them, they would have to give up eventually. As if reading his thoughts, Pansy yelled shrilly from the other side of the door.
“I don’t know. I got it after the trials. I’d been passing a tattoo parlour and it just felt right.” Harry looked just as on edge as he felt. “Why did you get it around the mark?”
“So what? I can be stubborn all I bloody want!”
“This…” Harry flapped his hand for a moment between them, “…doesn’t need to be bad.”
But I’m done being a coward.
“What do you think, Scarhead?” growled Draco, as he leaned into Harry and caught his lips in a searing kiss.
“I’m serious, Harry. You should go to the school counsellor McGonagall set up. She’s really good. Honestly, this isn’t healthy.”
Warily, he reached out, opened the envelope, and pulled out a large postcard with a cluster of ducklings on the front, all moving and flapping their wings as Draco stared in horror at the moving scene. He turned the postcard over and there, in the middle of the card in bright green letters, was the threatening assurance, “
I’m so sorry about last night. I’m sorry for leaving this morning when you were still asleep (by the way, you were drooling on your pillow). I’m sorry for kissing you and for…the other stuff we did. Salazar, this is so embarrassing!
"Thanks a lot, Nev." Hermione scowled, not impressed with Neville's tone in the least. She stepped carefully over to the kitchen and picked up a bottle of wine and two glasses. "Right, wish me luck."
“Well, excuse
“Of course. I’m not Longbottom,” drawled Draco, rolling his eyes in mock exacerbation. He reached into his bag and pulled out a large clump of parchment. Sighing, he plopped himself down at his workstation and began to flip through the pages, his eyes moving frantically from side to side and he scanned the information he’d managed to gather so far.
“What the actual fuck, Malfoy?”
Harry was silent, waiting for an actual answer to his question. After a moment, his patience was rewarded.
“Mother, please don’t get your hopes up.”
“Spoilsport,” intoned Draco, sounding thoroughly unimpressed.
Even he had to admit Malfoy quite likely wasn’t doing any of these things with the ducklings. In fact, loath as he was to award Malfoy any kind of positive attribute, he seemed to be helping them. Caring for them. He’d definitely been building an enclosure of sorts for them. Yes, the mother was missing, but that could be innocent.
“Please,” begged Draco, the liberal coating of the cool lube making him ache for Harry’s cock. He reached between them to position himself over Harry’s swollen head, bewilderment filling him as Harry pulled his hand away.
I’ve counted your eyelashes, the freckles on your cheeks, all the hidden tiny moles on your neck. I could trace the shape of your scar with my eyes shut.

“You were being stubborn—”
“It’s sentient, you know, like the castle, and the room’s magic must be picking up on something we’re not really aware of ourselves.”
“No, Draco. This isn’t right.” Harry asserted, his voice strained with frustration.
movements alone in my room, I found myself thinking of you." Oh Godric, what was he even saying? He felt so
“How’d you figure that one?” asked Potter, his voice curious despite the accusation.
“An interesting choice, it is definitely the more promising of the two in terms of panacea, but it’s also the more temperamental of the two.”
, exactly?"
“Ron, please let’s just—”
My bladder is killing me and I’ve just had to cast a freshening charm on my breath because I can’t brush my teeth, but I am not going to move from this bed until you open your eyes. Then I’m going to smile at you and tell you “good morning, my love.”
“Yeah, Potter, just say sorry,” Draco taunted, unable to help himself. “You don’t even have to mean it.”
“You almost missed the Quidditch match!”
“Other stuff?” Draco found himself chuckling darkly at Harry’s attempt of playing down the situation. “Sure, talk about
“I reckon you’re righ’. They’re abandoned, and likely not by choice neither. There’s hawks here ‘bouts and the mother would’ve been easy pickin’s given how tired she musta been.”
Harry groaned in resignation, knowing that whatever was going on in the cubicle wasn't going to be pretty. He lifted his right hand and held it over the lock, his mouth tugging into a slight smile at his wandless magic. He’d been able to do it for a while, but it still never ceased to amaze him each time he used it.
“Snitches and brooms, Potter? Aren’t you meant to be past the phase of novelty pants?”
“Sure, you can sit. It’s not like we’re not about to get a lot more up close and personal than this in a bit.” It would have been funny if it weren’t for the bitterness practically dripping from Harry’s tone. Draco lifted his mouth in a muted smile and placed his clothes on top of the dresser before padding over to sit on the bed, his wand in hand.
“Don’t do it, mate.”
Less than a second after their lips met, a large fizzle of static blasted through the room, much like the aftershocks of a Muggle bomb. Then, before anyone could react with more than surprised gasps, the door to the room emitted a loud click and swung wide open, revealing the darkened corridor beyond.
“You, okay? I noticed you! You’re smart and resourceful. You look after abandoned ducklings, for Merlin’s sake! And you’re fucking gorgeous! How did I never notice it before?”
“Harry—”
“Fuck! Malfoy!”
Malfoy’s words cut through anything else he could have possibly said, leaving him naked in the Slytherin’s wrath.
A few minutes later, Neville had sorted his precious plant and settled himself on the couch with a steaming cup of coffee and the latest issue of Herbology Weekly. He turned to the advice column and chortled to himself at the problem some old woman was having with her rare Amourous Tentacula — apparently it kept smacking her visitors on the bottom at the most inopportune moments! He eagerly read on to the expert's response, curious as to what they could possibly advise her to do when he became aware of...noises...coming from Harry's bedroom.
“It’s just so different.”
“You didn’t do anything?” parroted Ginny in disbelief. “You’re the reason everyone’s so bloody miserable!”
.’ Great!” sighed Draco irritably, “
“Wow, Potter,” snarled Draco from behind him, and Harry felt his heart drop down to his very bare feet. “That moving speech you gave me about seeing where this went didn’t last long, did it?”
“Yes, you said it was urgent?” His voice wavered slightly, betraying his nerves, and he found himself hoping that Narcissa hadn’t picked up on it.
Draco’s voice held a hint of curiosity under the blatant scorn, prompting Harry to look his old nemesis in the eye.
Unease morphed into suspicion as he took in just how nervous, almost ill, his old rival looked. Abruptly, as if aware he was being observed, Malfoy slunk out of his corner, his eyes downcast.
Draco
“I’m fine, Kreacher. I’ll grab something later on at work,” assured Harry, not in the mood to have yet another argument about his breakfast habits.
“Sounds good to me,” replied Harry, pulling Draco down for a quick, but thorough, kiss before letting him go. “Although you might want to change your jumper.” Harry’s amusement was clear and Draco quickly looked at himself, barely suppressing a snort when he realised he was wearing Harry’s latest Weasley jumper, the scarlet and gold ‘H’ looking particularly vibrant on a background of forest green.
he thought,
It was kind of wonderful, really. Two of his best friends, together. And Harry had been really happy lately. Everyone had just sort of assumed it was from the stress relief of the vacation at first and then hadn't considered when it'd continued.
Blaise grinned. "The palest naked arse in London that I can, unfortunately, identify from seven years of living in a dormitory, and it wasn't alone."
condition even though I told you I didn’t want anyone to know about it!”
“I’m not going to lock you in,” Harry informed him quietly. “I’ll send food up to you until you decide you want to come down and join me, alright?”
“Sure,” shrugged Ron, sensing victory, “if that’s what you want.”
He stared at the ducklings a little longer, then seemed to slowly come to his senses. He picked himself up off the grass and lifted the rapidly dampening box. After drying the box and making it more comfortable with leaves and grass, Draco cancelled the shield charm around the nest and began to levitate the ducklings, one at a time, into the box, counting as he went to make sure he didn’t leave anyone behind. Lastly, he cast warming and silencing charms on the box — he had a Death Eater reputation to uphold after all — and then got to work.
“You have to admit she has a point, mate.”
"Same here, if I do say so myself." He forced himself to leer at her, running his eyes over her bare calves and bulging chest. Merlin, what
“I don’t want you to be with me because you feel you have to, or because you don’t have any other options and you’re lonely.”
"Then maybe I should give you some more practical, one-to-one, private tuition. We could work on the best way to handle your wand and maybe more."
"All over your legs? Wouldn't your trousers protect you from that? Where were you, anyway?"
Apparently, Granger’s threat was worse than it sounded, because Potter actually paled and faced Draco, his mouth still holding stubbornly onto his annoyance.
I’m not sure what I want to say here, so you’re going to have to forgive the rambling. I’m sure I’ll get to the point, whatever that is, soon enough.
Harry had never been more thankful for the waterproof quality of the invisibility cloak as he knelt in the tall grass, although he found himself wishing it also came with a heating charm. He’d been standing, but the shock of what he found Malfoy doing was enough to drop him to his knees. Harry couldn’t help but thank Godric for the howling wind, otherwise Malfoy would have heard his shocked gasp for sure. If it weren’t for that, Malfoy would have known he was there. He tugged the cloak tighter around his icy limbs and squinted through the rain at the strange sight before him.
“What’s your project on anyway?” Draco craned his neck around to look suspiciously at him. “What? It’s a valid question? You’re always working on it every chance you get.”
“Then it would only need to be a temporary bond?” The idea of being forced into bonding with anyone, even his supposed soulmate, made Draco want to throw up.
“Indeed.”
“Maybe the apology wasn’t enough,” Ron mused, taking a quick swig of the bottle and then passing it back to Seamus.
“Uh-huh.” Harry looked amused nonetheless as he turned the page and scanned the contents before carrying on. “Oh goodie,
So, yeah. You’re welcome. You break my heart into smithereens and I get you out of prison. Sounds like a fair trade, right?
“Draco— Shit, you’re freezing! Look, let’s just get you off this floor and then we can talk about the other stuff.”
“You are not. You were never a proper one and you know it. If there was an award for the worst Death Eater ever, then you would have won it hands down.”
Blaise chuckled out his agreement, but Neville shook his head. "No, he doesn't, but Pansy does, and I'm so bloody tired of secrets, so this is great."
child.”
Draco stayed with his arms wrapped around his mother for several long moments, unwilling to let her go just yet. It was surely hopeless, but he would talk to Severus before hanging up his wand and picking out a casket.
“Only one way to find out,” advised Ron, his attention still firmly on his notes.
“I need you to understand these stipulations, Mr Malfoy, and verbally express your wish to proceed before we can move forwards.”
, and looked at Draco in desperation.
Which reminds me, thanks for the tea bags! You’d think I’d remember to pick some up, but now I don’t have to. As a thank you, I mentioned to Neville that you’re a tea enthusiast, and he’s agreed to send you samples of the organic teas he’s been growing lately. They’re really nice!
"And why not?" she prompted, finally determined to get the truth out once and for all.
“What? There’s no way I’m the only one who’d be up for it— ooph!”
“Will you join me for breakfast tomorrow?”
He double-checked the car was in park and unclipped his safety belt thing, pleased to note that when he exited the car, his legs were much more stable than the other two’s. To be fair, Potter didn’t look that bad, just pissed off. The instructor, however, looked like he needed a stiff drink or three.
By the way, your sleep routine sounds mental. Luna tried to convince me to take cold showers to keep the Wrackspurts at bay and I obviously ignored her. I can’t believe you did what she suggested! Last week she told me to dye my hair pink to avoid Nifflers’ attacks - as if I had anything worth stealing.
), so Draco had put on Sticky Fingers by the Rolling Stones, one of his favourite albums. Harry, of course, had noted once again that Draco was indulging in Muggle culture, but Draco simply shrugged in answer, before adding that recently he had had a lot more respect for Muggles than before. Understandably, Harry opted not to comment any further. It was too close to those murky war years that they tended to avoid.
The library, however, proved to be as useless as he had always suspected. Not one book on ducklings, or any type of premature waterfowl at all! He’d searched for ages, and then, sick of the looks he was drawing from the students gathered there, he cracked and asked Pince for help. A hissed complaint at the elderly librarian at her insufficient collection, a quick run-in with Potter, and he was off, jogging towards the last place he’d ever thought he would visit on campus, and towards the only source of animal-related information he could think of.
“Bugger off,” groaned Draco after a moment. “I don’t want you in here.”
“Draco, please, you shouldn’t get yourself worked up. It can’t be good for the baby.”
He’d looked over at Harry’s sleep-relaxed face and couldn’t help a bitter-sweet smile as he reached out and gently traced the indent on the bridge of his nose from where his glasses rested for most of the day. He’d always known this couldn’t last forever, that even without the potion, Harry would one day be free to do what he liked, so long as he met up with Draco for his ‘duties’ every once in a while. Maybe only once a year. The pang of loss from that thought shot through Draco like a red-hot poker, and he was forced to bite down hard on his bottom lip to stop himself gasping in pain. As the feeling ebbed, Draco felt his eyes begin to sting with tiredness and unshed tears, and he rolled into Harry, snuggling his nose into the crease in Harry’s neck, refusing to surrender to the lull of sleep. There wasn’t long until these moments stopped, and he was damned if he was going to miss a second more than he had to.
Draco returns to Hogwarts and his illness progresses.
“Well, whatever it is, it can’t be worse than this.”
“Thought you could use something to keep your energy up,” explained Harry, leaning in for a light kiss which turned deeper in the blink of an eye.
“I don’t hate you either, but that’s hardly a scene from An Affair To Remember!”
Harry watched as Draco pulled the suite door closed behind them and made sure it was locked, before heading off alongside Harry to the elevator. "I bet twenty quid that I see more barracuda than you do."
“Tell me about it.” Draco had briefly considered that option, until they had informed them both that the consummation had to take place without any impairments or magical aids. A shiver suddenly worked its way down his spine, forcing him to try and disguise the shudder as a haughty sniff. However, one look at Harry’s concerned frown told him that he hadn’t managed it.
“You know what?” Draco walked past Harry, his trousers fastened low on his hips. “Fuck this, and fuck you, too.”
“Yeah,” agreed Seamus, waving the bottle at Harry, “see? Perspective.”
"Harry? What—"
Malfoy turned to face him just as Harry got to him, bringing them face to face.
“Okay,” sighed Harry, trying to get his thoughts in order, “start at the beginning.”
“What? You thought what, Harry?”
“What is it?” Harry pulled the stopper and gave it a quick sniff, pulling away with an unimpressed grimace at the unfortunate odour. Draco just smiled encouragingly, forcing down the sickening thought that once Harry drank the antidote, he would leave again.
“Hey, who’s your friend?” asked Harry, grinning at the sight of the two pets floating about each other.
It was driving me insane, Harry.
He climbed into his side of the bed and pulled the heavy quilt over his weary body. Harry wouldn’t be long and then they could talk. Draco found himself thinking of all the things he needed to say, as if he were preparing for some grand speech. After several long minutes, Draco’s eyes began to flutter closed. As his breathing began to even out, he couldn’t help but think how fitting it was that he would be left, used and alone, on what was essentially his wedding night, Harry’s note still clutched in his hand.
“We aren’t doing anything to Draco; we’re trying to get Harry to come back to the party,” explained Hermione wearily. “He’s doing his Draco thing again.”
"Stop! Stop! Oh god, he's my best friend, and I kiss that man sometimes. Don't go any further!" She turned on Neville. "How long have you known?"
Draco’s reply was lost as Harry ghosted the tip of his middle finger across his hole, causing Draco to arch and clench his arse muscles.
"Harry, Draco, you, and you," he said in a trembling voice, pointing back and forth between the two of them, "and rash, and weekend, and… and…"
“Erm, you were horny?” asked Harry, suddenly feeling like he was on thin ice.
you tell me that I don’t have it in me to forgive you. How
It had been several weeks since Harry had had his first breakthrough with Draco. Now that he was eating and sleeping much better, Draco was looking much healthier. It had taken some wheedling, but Harry had managed to get him to agree to see a Healer and take his prenatal potions every day, although he endured it with a sour attitude each time. His personality was slowly emerging, and Harry found himself living for the days when Draco was in the mood to argue with him. Draco had reverted to calling him the old taunts, but they had lost their edge, and Harry fancied there was even an undertone of affection in them.
He looked at Malfoy and was surprised to see his own rage reflected in the man’s face. Harry remembered how desperate he’d been when Sirius died, asking Nearly-Headless Nick if his godfather could possibly be a ghost, and the feeling of utter despair and loneliness when he realised Sirius was truly gone. If anyone had a reason to be pissed, it was Harry, or even Ron. The thought of Ron’s face at seeing Fred again, even in ghost form, solidified Harry’s resolve. If Malfoy wanted a fight, then Harry would give it to him.
“Is it— Can I touch them?”
“I swear, if you don’t get that…that thing off my bed and out of my sight this second—”
He walked away, his shoulders hunched under the weight of the crowd staring, Malfoy yelled his final parting words.
“Later, maybe.” Draco threw the powder into the fire and stepped into the flames. “Don’t wait up, Mother. Later, Scarhead. Diagon Alley!”
“What do you want me to say, Harry?” Draco sighed heavily, wishing it were already tomorrow. “It’s not that big of a deal. What is death? I mean, really? There are worse things.”
“Draco, her name’s Ginny. It’s not hard to say you know. Also, I don’t care who she’s with. I only care who you’re with. I’m not saying this stuff because I’m lonely or feel obligated. I’m saying it because, unbelievably, I’ve fallen in love with you. Hard.”
It only took a few minutes before they had a whole strategy ironed out. Harry was going to flirt with Hermione until she broke, and Draco was going to flirt with each and every random person who called him for a date. Once they had sworn a reluctant Neville to secrecy, they all headed back to the table, taking turns pausing along the way so as to not appear as if they'd been plotting together in the loo.
“Yes, my son Draco is pregnant.” She confirmed slowly, like she was explaining an obvious concept to a young child.
After the longest ten seconds of her life in which Harry just stared at her, he finally began to lean in until their lips were finally touching and, Oh-Holy-Mother-Of-Merlin, Harry was kissing her! Okay, it was closed-mouthed — talk about small mercies — but his lips were on hers, all warm and thin not just a friendly peck, and it was wrong, wrong, wrong!
“Ok, so the options,” began Healer Greyson, “are as follows. One — we make you as comfortable as possible with Pain-Relieving Potions for the remainder of your active life. We would also make plans for when you need to begin palliative care, which would be the last month or so of your illness.” The grip his mother had on his hand was verging on painful, and he used the pain to keep himself grounded. This was nothing he hadn’t expected and he wouldn’t allow himself to get emotional and maudlin. “Two — we perform an experimental spell. It’s still in its testing stages, but it’s developed for this kind of core sickness.”
“Well, maybe it’s not meant to be taken literally. Anyone here particularly decent at floral language?” Blaise asked, his voice slow with tedium.
“I can assure you I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.” Pansy’s tone was cold, each syllable bleeding absolute fury.
"Well, I mean, it's me. And I'm a guy. And Harry's—"
I’m done hiding.
I wish I could start all over again and not make the same stupid mistakes.
“What other way could there be? What other hope is there?” The words were muffled against his neck, but he heard them as clearly as if his mother had shouted them.
“See you later, Draco.” Blaise patted Draco briefly on the arm and walked confidently out of the room. “I think I’ll go check on little Red.”
“Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Mr Potter,” she began gently, “would you like some tea?”
Draco stifled a glance at Harry and instead, cast a glare at Pansy.
Potter had taken the news about as well as Draco had predicted he would and was currently being calmed down by the matron and McGonagall in the small hospital wing office. The yelled protests were that much louder thanks to the silence in which he found himself sitting, his mother looking at him in something akin to apprehension. At the moment, Potter was currently ranting about “How convenient that I’m the only person who can help the git?” and raving that “It’s some last-ditch ploy to save his shot reputation. How can you believe anything he says?” Draco closed his eyes and leaned back against the pillows, doing his best to shut the whole situation out. His mother kept huffing each time she disagreed with something Potter yelled, which was frequently. How he longed to tell her to go home, or go have a cup of tea, or even to just breathe quietly.
They’re knocking on the door. The Aurors are here.
He skirted the edge of the hall until he reached the entrance doors and slipped through them, seemingly invisible to the crowds of people milling around like locusts. He had no destination in mind at first, at least he didn’t
"What's up?" asked Harry, appearing in the kitchen doorway.
“Wait—how do you know who Nathaniel Hawthorne is?”
“Don’t tell me when to worry, Potter.” He glared at Harry so fiercely, he was suddenly very thankful that looks couldn’t kill. “Hand it over. Now.”
“Please, let me take care of you?” Harry could hear his tone was veering dangerously close to begging, but he found it hard to care. He didn’t know precisely why he needed to do this, just that it was what he was meant to do. He was built to look after Draco.
would say about it.
“If we get stuck?” repeated Pansy, looking at Luna as though she couldn’t believe this girl really existed. “How much more stuck could we get?”
Blaise pushed the door open and froze, but luckily, or unluckily, she considered later, she was short enough to see beneath his arm.
It had been three days since his underwear had been charmed to quack and it didn’t look as if the fowl-related attacks were likely to stop any time soon. Every morning brought taunting mail informing him that someone within the castle knew about the ducklings. Even if he skipped breakfast, the owls seemed to find him. The one that morning had actually arrived as he was sitting playing with the ducklings in the enclosure. It had been a ridiculous postcard again, this time with a cartoon duck on the front with the caption “Birds of a feather must stick together!” On the other side was the usual scrawled note demanding “
Christmas had been the most dour affair Draco had ever been privy to, and he’d had the Dark Lord living in his house for a year. The majority of students had left for the holidays, as had Weasley and Granger, thank Merlin! The only thing worse than having to spend Christmas at Hogwarts was having to spend Christmas at Hogwarts with Harry’s friends.
Draco wasn’t sure how long he stood in the middle of their room —
“Well, that’s just— You guys are just so far off the mark.”
“You can do that though, can’t you?” Draco struggled to keep his voice steady. He knew more than most what it felt like to be lost and helpless.
Draco stepped away from Harry and placed his hand on the banister, but before he could place his foot on the bottom step, Harry pulled him back around to face him, mere centimetres separating them both.
using Harry’s urine in a bloody potion!”
Malfoy gave the door another tug, but the door was decidedly locked.
“Oh shut it, Weasley.” Draco fought to keep his tone even. He wished he’d never bothered to open the door in the first place. “She came looking for Harry, and then she and Pansy started on each other. I didn’t actually do anything!”
think you're handsome," she cooed, leaning dangerously close to Harry, causing him to fumble his way out of his chair to his feet.
“Don’t be daft, they’re not going to expel Harry Potter, are they?”
“There are just some things ducklings shouldn’t have to see.” Draco smiles as Harry realises what he’s implying. “How about we spend a little more time with the ducklings — I’ve got to feed them anyway — and then we can relocate to my room? Longbottom is at Abbot’s tonight, I believe. We could…talk or something.”
I’ve never wished so much for a time-turner.
However, Luna just shrugged, completely unaffected by his ire. She plucked a flower from the bunch next to her feet and began to fix it into her braid, humming tunelessly to herself as she worked.
"How long?" He managed to get out, still unable to say the words out loud.
“Teddy, my godson, got them for me, and I like them,” Potter said with a smile, unaffected by Draco’s light teasing.
“Well, shit.”
Only just realising they had company, the brunette pulled his mouth off Draco with an audible pop and turned his horrified gaze upon Harry.
“Now, Mr Potter— Harry, you must be wondering why I asked you here,” she observed.
“You don’t have to as long as I do.”
As for your abysmal organisation of tea bags, I find it absolutely barbaric. Who on earth drinks camomile in the morning?! Mind you, the fact that you insist on putting three spoonfuls of sugar in your tea is outrageous enough. Besides, what you call “anal” is simply civilised organisation of breakfast beverages, thank you very much. Some of us have standards.
“What else, Draco?”
“At what cost?” Draco frowned and lifted his head from Harry’s shoulder. “Look at us now. Sure it was fun, but what the fuck happens now? Are we going to skip out of here holding hands and singing songs? I highly doubt it.”
"Harry? Why the bloody fuck did you let me sleep so damned late!"
“Now, now, everyone! Attention, if you please!” Miss Bumble was smiling around at the class, seemingly unaffected by the number of unamused faces glaring back at her. “We will head out to the Quidditch pitch, where the practical side of this lesson has been set up for us.
The knowledge that Potter had tattoos had Draco’s heart racing, and at that moment he knew he’d give all his gold in Gringott’s to see them. He flicked his eyes at Harry’s forearm, remembering seeing a flash of something there earlier on. Unfortunately, Harry had his hands in his pockets, his forearm hidden from view. Unwilling to trust his voice, he nodded at Potter and quirked an eyebrow in response.
“It’s for the best, Draco. You need to look after yourself and the eh—”
“Yeah, I got pretty much the same advice from Blaise, except his was more along the vein of, ‘
I thought I was being sensible. I thought you would never be interested in me that way; that if you found out about my feelings, I would just lose you forever. Having you as a friend is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I couldn’t face giving up what we had.
Malfoy, all pale skin and grey eyes, was standing alone in a corner next to the bar.
Harry scrunched his eyes up at the morning light and threw an arm over his face in an attempt to block it out. He wasn’t sure which was worse, his hangover or the acrid taste in his mouth. This was why he shouldn’t drink, he thought to himself, as he tried to coax himself into going to the toilet before his bladder exploded. Another reason why he should drink was the weird dreams it gave him. He’d dreamt that he pulled Malfoy at a bar and shagged him in his living room! And, as if that wasn’t bad enough, he’d then shagged him in his bed for a good portion of the night before they both had passed out. He gave a feeble chuckle that turned into a wheeze as more details of the dream came back to him. It was fucking weird. For one, he didn’t think Draco was gay, and there wasn’t enough booze on Earth to make him shag that twat.
At Pansy’s words, Harry gave Draco a harsh shove away from him and yanked up his boxers.
Harry had to agree with that. The babies couldn’t have been more than an inch long each, making them look dwarfed by their parents' foot-long bodies.
Once midnight had finally chimed, they shared a relieved toast to a better year, both aware of the ridiculousness of that statement, and got into bed, ready for the obligatory sex. Draco had lain on his side this time, his leg hiked up as Harry diligently did his duty from behind him. Once they were spent, lying in the dark, almost asleep, Harry initiated their whispered conversation.
Draco could see from Harry’s expression that Ginny had gone too far, something that Granger also seemed to pick up on.
my Harry!"
“You know what? Bugger off, Malfoy.”
"Yes, very nice. Harry will likely crumble at the sight of your tits and long legs. Congratulations."
Orion is gone now. He’s reporting me to the Aurors as I write these last few words to you.
The bell signifying the end of Muggle Studies class rang out, and Draco felt almost shaky with relief. The woman was actually talking about a class field trip as a practical test now that they were finishing up Muggle transportation. Outside in the corridor, Blaise was waiting on him, leaning casually against the wall as more than a few passing students openly ogled him. To be fair, Blaise
“The baby. Of course, the baby,” repeated Draco in a near whisper. He glared at Harry and lurched to his feet, swaying precariously before managing to catch his balance. “That’s all you fucking care about, isn’t it?” continued Draco, his voice steadily rising now, “the filthy Potter spawn that’s fucking up my life! Well, screw you and screw the baby.”
— so much leaning!"
“Really?” smiled Draco, his eyebrows raised slightly in surprise. “You’d really dance with a Death Eater at the Hogwarts five-year reunion?”
"We had a breakthrough at the shop today. Finally sorted out the issues with the Mini Spellomatic," explained Ron, grinning happily as he poured himself a large glass of white wine.
“I still don’t see what a rope and flowers have to do with me and Mal— Draco.”
He went to take a sip of coffee, carefully trying to keep his hand steady as he lifted the cup. He only got it halfway to his lips before he lost control of his hand, the dark liquid sloshing over the rim as he hastily lowered it back to the table. He hissed in frustration and kept his eyes firmly upon the table in front of him. He had no desire to see people staring at him, some in concern, others in glee.
into each other’s mouths as they kissed and writhed, until Harry was finally lying between Draco’s thighs, his cock embedded balls deep inside of him. This time, as they moved together, it was something more than fucking. Something positive. This time, afterwards, they stay wrapped around each other, pressing soft kisses to each other’s lips, necks, jawlines.
P.S If you’re up for dinner at mine, feel free to suggest food. I’m sick of Italian (thanks to Ron), so I’m happy for new ideas.
“Harry...” Draco could hear the pleading in his voice, but for the life of him he didn’t know what he was pleading for.
Luckily, the whole welcome situation wasn’t drawn out. A brief shaking of hands, a random hug from one Susan Bones, and he was allowed to progress from the entry hall into the Great Hall, trying not to set fire to the name tag one of the ‘Puffs had pressed onto his chest. As if people would take one look at his blond hair and pale skin and not know exactly who he was.
"Sorry about that, guys. Just a bit of a dodgy stomach from lunch." Harry grinned at everyone around the table as he dropped into his seat before leaning into Hermione, his voice dropping an octave. "I feel much better now, though, thanks to you being so
“You’re putting me off!”
“How do you know it won’t?”
to put it back for them!" He lifted his head to look beseechingly at Harry. "If I don't do something, anything, then I'm going to end up on the six o'clock news for murdering all the library patrons by bashing them to death with the biggest and heaviest book in the library''.
“What? Draco, what is it?”
“It’s not what you think. We were just— it was the heat!” Harry jumped to his feet as he babbled, snatching his clothes from the floor in panic. He was so painfully aware of everyone staring at them, at the sheer amount of bare skin on display between himself and Draco, that he couldn’t think straight. Panic was building inside him, like a swarm of hornets had taken up residence inside his brain.
“For fuck sake, Potter,” exclaimed Malfoy, his face flushing an attractive pink despite his obvious fury. “I don't want to fuck you, you blithering imbecile. I want you to come and retrieve your sexually deviant pet who has taken it upon herself to break into my room and harass Atlantis.”
“Where’re you going? Draco, talk to me.” Harry sounded so worried, and it was the blatant concern oozing from the Gryffindor that caused Draco to slow down for a moment.
“Really, mate? You’re going to ask why?” asked Ron, raising his eyebrows.
Harry felt a surge of gratitude swirl through him towards Pansy, as she swiftly silenced Theo’s disturbing ramblings with a sharp jab from her elbow. However, before he could thank her, Susan coughed loudly, bringing his attention back to the furious Hufflepuff—a sight he hadn’t seen since the Triwizard Tournament.
The sound of skin slapping and lube squelching filled the room amidst the groans and pants and
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing, Potter?” Draco shudders at the sound of his own voice, the snarl curling around his words in a way they haven’t done in months.
Once her top half was decent, she quickly rolled her skirt back down to the proper length and grinned goofily at the room at large. She had to admit that once the shock had worn off, Harry and Draco made a pretty amazing looking couple.
“The heat?” repeated Hermione sceptically. “The heat made you guys strip and snog?”
*****
“I wouldn’t know.”
Malfoy, who Harry had identified as the owner of the voice, was now punctuating each word he yelled with a thump on the door. Worried he would soon have to deal with the entire floor and not just an irate Malfoy, Harry got to his feet and wrenched the door open.
Almost instantly, a current of magic fizzled through his body, warming him from his chest outwards, the rush making him feel slightly lightheaded. So much like the fizzle of energy he had felt during the Bonding ceremony. So much like the way it felt when Harry had come undone inside of him.
“You can see why she did it,” Hermione said, obviously thinking out loud. “The new system, I mean. A lot happened at Hogwarts, and I think she just wants to give everyone a fresh start, regardless of values, blood status, or any of that rot.”
"Nope," his voice was clipped and overly cheerful. "I'm too busy with work for a relationship, you know me."
“What benefit would come from finding my core twin? I don’t see how that would help my situation at all.” The whole plan seemed to lack any common sense and Draco wasn’t about to embark on a harebrained scheme, even under extenuating circumstances!
“No, that’s not what I meant. It’s just, I know you’re grateful for the help, but I don't want you confusing gratitude with something more.”
Harry leaned against the corridor wall and watched Malfoy until he’d disappeared around the corner. Something was up, that much was clear, and the first thing Harry was going to do was have a look in the Magical Creatures section for clues.
Sure enough, Harry was back within minutes, sighing about their mates being a bunch of idiots, but that all of them were still more or less in one piece. The fluttering inside Draco’s chest had turned furious, like a caged bird desperate to escape. He stared at Harry, unable to look anywhere else except into those confused emerald pools. Harry looked so unsure as if he were scared of saying or doing the wrong thing. Without realising he’d made the decision to move, Draco suddenly had his arms around Harry and was kissing him with a desperation he had never felt before. Harry responded immediately, kissing Draco back with enthusiasm.
I’m a coward, I know.
"That's right!" Hermione nodded indignantly, lifting her boobs inside her bra to boost her cleavage. "If they had just told the truth, then none of this would be happening."
“It’s wherever I am,” explained Harry, his voice low, almost hypnotic. “Maybe one day, I’ll have an actual place, but for now it’s enough.”
Harry realises that everything that happens has some kind of link back to Draco. That he can’t stop looking for his name on the map, for his face in a crowd. Sometimes in the shower, he finds himself thinking of those pearly white teeth worrying the pink plump lip and feels himself yearn for something he never knew was there, certainly something he had never felt with Cho or Ginny, and in the end, he’s forced to take himself in hand and stroke away the tension and confusion until he comes, his hand sticky and his arm tired. He thinks of Draco in the shower and wonders if he feels the same way about Harry. He realises, finally, that somewhere along the way, he’s fallen in love with the git.
“Like I said, she’s different.”
*****
for putting in all this hard work.”
“Checking out where Malfoy’s going,” he mumbled, scanning the map for the git’s name, doing his best to ignore the collective groans from his friends and the muffled Muffiliato Hermione quickly cast around them. “Ah! He’s at the lake!” He looked up at his friends triumphantly, his enthusiasm dimming slightly when met with two very unimpressed expressions. “What?”
important to me. Please?”
“Of course, I left! You basically told me you’d been working on some secret cure so you could get to live your life free from me. And I get it, I do. You’ve always felt like you had no choice. I get why the cure was important to you. But it hurt, Draco. Merlin, did it hurt! I was angry, but I miss you more than anything.”
“Fuck, off, Harry.”
"Well, it was either that or listen to you singing the blues for the next while, so really it was a completely selfish move!"
*****
He quickly checked he had his cloak on him, forced his notes and books back into his bag and slung it on his shoulder. He shot a final glare at his so-called friends and, map in hand, hurried down towards the lake.
“To live. I feel like we’ve just been sleepwalking through this whole thing, and I don’t want to live like that. If we’re together, then I want it to be more. I want us both to be as happy as we can be. Otherwise, what was the point in winning the war?”
, and not for the fact that I can give you a child.”
“You found ‘em, Malfoy. I reckon they’re your responsibility now. Just don' take 'em inside. They're wild creatures an' need ter stay outside. Yeh'll need ter sort 'em an enclosure o' some kind. If yeh need anythin’, you know where to find me.”
no wind.” Harry chewed his lip and looked at Malfoy, who was looking around himself as if a ghoul with ill intent was about to pop out and yell ‘boo’ at him.
